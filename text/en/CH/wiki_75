<doc id="1033537" wikidata="Q7805520" url="?curid=1033537" title="Timed out">
<text>Timed out is a method of dismissal in the sport of cricket. It occurs when an incoming batter is not ready to play within a given amount of time of the previous batter being either dismissed or retired. This is one case of a &#x27;diamond&#x27; or &#x27;platinum&#x27; duck, as the player is out without having faced a ball. The first and so far the only batter in international cricket to be dismissed by this method is Angelo Mathews, playing against Bangladesh in the ICC Men&#x27;s Cricket World Cup 2023. The purpose of the law is to ensure there are no unnecessary delays to the game. It is easily avoided, and it is very unusual for a batter to get out &#x27;timed out&#x27;. , there have been no instances of this type of dismissal in Test cricket, a single instance in one day international cricket, and six instances in first-class cricket as a whole. The first batter in Twenty20 International cricket to be dismissed by this method is Godfred Bakiweyem against Sierra Leone in the 2023 Africa Cricket Association Africa T20 Cup.

==Background== 

&quot;Timed Out&quot; as a specific method of dismissal was added to the Laws in the 1980 code. It provided two minutes for the incoming batter to &quot;step on to the field of play&quot;. In the 2000 code, this was revised to three minutes for the batter to &quot;be in position to take guard or for his partner to be ready to receive the next ball&quot;. However, the first printed Laws of cricket, in 1775, already required the umpires &quot;To allow Two Minutes for each Man to come in when one is out&quot;.

In 1919, Sussex cricketer Harold Heygate was given out by the umpire Alfred Street as &quot;timed out&quot; in a first-class County Championship match with Somerset at Taunton. MCC, then in charge of the Laws, later ruled that the umpire was correct in ending the Sussex innings when Heygate failed to appear within two minutes, but that the batter should be marked as &quot;absent&quot;, which is how it appears in the 1920 edition of Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack. Under present rules, Heygate would have been recorded as &quot;absent hurt&quot;, and this is how his innings is now recorded in CricketArchive. The match ended in a tie.

==Current Law==
Law 40 of the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot; provides that an incoming batter must be in position to receive the ball or for their partner to be ready to receive the next ball within a given amount of time of the fall of the previous wicket or the previous batsman retiring. If not, the incoming batter will be given out, timed out, on appeal.

The amount of time given for the incoming batter to be ready varies depending on the match playing conditions. The default period of time defined in Law 40 is 3 minutes, but this is amended to 2 minutes for Test cricket and one day international cricket. Twenty20 cricket shortens the period of time even further to 90 seconds, and an on-field dugout is often provided in this format (in a similar manner to some other team sports such as association football and rugby) to enable incoming batters to make their way to the wicket immediately when a wicket falls to avoid being timed out. The umpires cannot rule on any appeal for timed out until someone takes the field of play.

The &quot;incoming batter&quot; may be any batter who has not yet batted. There is no prescribed batting order in cricket, i.e. the team does not have to come out to bat in any specific order even if one has been published. Until one batter has set foot on the field the batting captain may pick any player who has not yet batted who, when they appear on the field, may then be given out on appeal. Knowing that a better batter will shortly be able to take the field, the captain can therefore sacrifice onto the field
their worst remaining batter (colloquially the &quot;No. 11&quot;) or one who is present injured, even one who previously retired hurt.

Whether or not an appeal for timed out is made, if the delay in which no batter comes to the wicket extends beyond the prescribed minutes, an &quot;extended delay&quot; is judged and the umpires follow the procedure in Law 16.3 with a view to award the match to the opposing team. They will discuss the situation together, make contact with the Captain of the team who are refusing to play and can award the game to the bowling side. 

If no remaining not out players are able to take the field (e.g. through absence, injury or illness, or suspension or ejection as a result of a players&#x27; conduct offence) then none is given out &quot;timed out&quot;; instead the innings is to be considered as completed and &quot;absent ill/injured/hurt&quot; (or retired in the event of a players&#x27; conduct offence) is noted next to all remaining players&#x27; names as appropriate.

==Dismissals==
===Test cricket matches===

No batter has been dismissed timed out in Test cricket as of November 2023, but there are some notable incidents where a batter could have potentially been dismissed in this manner:

# During the third Test at Cape Town&#x27;s Newlands Cricket Ground of the 2006–2007 series between India and South Africa, India quickly lost two opening batters at the start of their second innings. Sachin Tendulkar was listed as the fourth batter, but as he had been replaced as a fielder for 18 minutes at the end of South Africa&#x27;s first innings, he was ineligible to bat in India&#x27;s second innings until another 18 minutes had expired from its commencement. After confusion in the Indian dressing room about Tendulkar&#x27;s ineligibility resulting in a six-minute delay, Sourav Ganguly came in as the next batter. South African captain Graeme Smith did not appeal for a &quot;timed out&quot; dismissal of the incoming batter as the Umpires had told him it would not be entertained due to confusing information given by the match referee regarding Tendulkar&#x27;s short suspension, and Ganguly was allowed to commence his innings.
# During the second Test in the 2023 Ashes series, Australian player Nathan Lyon suffered a severe calf injury while fielding that prevented him from moving at a normal pace. During the Australian second innings he decided to take his place as the final batter and to avoid the potential for England to appeal and have him dismissed by a time out, Lyon moved closer to the field than the Australian players pavilion so he could hobble onto the ground within the time limit. He avoided being timed out, scoring 4 runs before he was dismissed.

=== One Day International (ODI) matches===
#The only player in any form of international cricket to be dismissed by being timed out is Sri Lankan Angelo Mathews in a group stage match against Bangladesh during the 2023 Cricket World Cup in Delhi on 6th November. During this match, Mathews was adjudged to have been timed out after Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan appealed and indicated Mathews had arrived late to the crease since the fall of the last wicket of previous batter Sadeera Samarawickrama. The incident unfolded during the 25th over of the Sri Lankan batting innings. The appeal caused confusion on the field with Mathews and Shakib caught on the camera in a heated exchange over the timed out debate. Mathews tried to convince both Shakib and on field umpires that he arrived to the crease a bit late due to his helmet strap breaking. Mathews had tightened his helmet which caused the chin strap to break. He then sought a replacement helmet, causing him to not be ready to face the first ball within the time limit. Shakib refused to withdraw the appeal and Mathews even showed his dissent towards the decision of on field umpires Richard Illingworth and Marais Erasmus. Shakib complained that Mathews was not ready to face his first delivery within the two minutes as per the competition rules. It was later reported that the two minutes time limit had already elapsed before the helmet strap was broken. This occurred when there was an issue with Mathews&#x27; helmet strap after he came onto the pitch, and the time he took waiting for a replacement meant he was in violation of law 40.1.1 that &quot;After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless time has been called, be ready to receive the ball, or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within 3 minutes of the dismissal or retirement&quot;. However, the ICC tournament condition which during ICC-sanctioned tournament rules supersede the MCC laws that state the new batter must face their first ball within 2 minutes of the previous batter being dismissed rather than 3. The Bangladesh team decided to uphold their appeal for timed out, and so Mathews was forced to leave the field. Thus, Mathews became the first player in any international cricket match to be dismissed without taking part in a delivery.

===First-class cricket===
# Andrew Jordaan – Eastern Province v Transvaal at Port Elizabeth in 1987–88 – Not out overnight, Jordaan was prevented from reaching the ground by flooded roads the following day.
# Hemulal Yadav – Tripura v Orissa at Cuttack in 1997–98 – Yadav was in conversation with his team manager on the boundary and did not attempt to reach the crease.
# Vasbert Drakes – Border v Free State at East London in 2002 – Drakes was still on his way to the match by aeroplane from his native West Indies when he was due to bat.
# AJ Harris – Nottinghamshire v Durham UCCE at Nottingham in 2003 – Harris was suffering from a groin strain and took too long to walk to the crease and was given out on appeal.
# Ryan Austin – Combined Campuses and Colleges v Windward Islands at Kingstown, St Vincent in 2013–14 – Austin, the number 11 batter, failed to reach the crease in the requisite amount of time.
# Charles Kunje – Matabeleland Tuskers v Mountaineers at Bulawayo in 2017-18.

<doc id="1033540" wikidata="Q1141487" url="?curid=1033540" title="Nissan Patrol">
<text>The is a series of off-road vehicles and full-size SUVs manufactured by Nissan in Japan since 1951 and sold throughout the world. It is Nissan&#x27;s longest running series of models.

The Patrol has been available as either a short-wheelbase (SWB) three-door or a long-wheelbase (LWB) five-door chassis since 1951. The LWB version has been offered in pickup truck and cab chassis variants. Between 1988 and 1994, Ford Australia marketed the Patrol as the Ford Maverick. In some European countries, such as Spain, the Patrol was marketed by Ebro as the Ebro Patrol. In 1980 in Japan, it was rebadged and alternately sold at Nissan Prince Store locations as the Nissan Safari. 

The Patrol has traditionally competed with the Toyota Land Cruiser in most world markets and is available in Australia, Central and South America, South Africa, parts of Southeast Asia, and Western Europe, as well as Iran and the Middle East. For the 2011 model year, it was made available in North America as the upscale Infiniti QX56 (later renamed as Infiniti QX80), the first time that a Patrol-based vehicle had been sold in North America since 1969, and for the 2017 model year, it would be offered in that market as the Nissan Armada.


== First generation (4W60; 1951) ==
In September 1951, the 4W60 was introduced exclusively to Japanese Nissan dealerships. The overall styling was similar to the Willys Jeep. The 4W60 used the 3.7 L Nissan NAK engine from the Nissan 290 bus, but with part-time four-wheel drive and a four-speed manual transmission. The grille had a pressed-steel Nissan badge. A 4W70 Carrier-based wagon was available.

The 4W61 was introduced in August 1955; it changed the grille (with some chrome bars), a one-piece windshield that sits further back when folded, chrome strips on the hood, and unequally sized seats (passenger&#x27;s side is wider than the driver&#x27;s). The other big change was the engine. The 4W61 was powered by the new 3.7 L Nissan NB engine, producing , and later was powered by the 4.0 L Nissan NC engine. The grille badge was chrome and red and said &quot;NISSAN&quot;.

In October 1958, the 4W65 Patrol replaced the 4W61. The 4W65 changed the grille, which now had all chrome bars and redesigned front fenders and hood. A &quot;NISSAN&quot; badge was on the grille and &quot;Patrol&quot; badges were added on the sides of the hood. An eight-seater hardtop wagon, the WG4W65, was added. The short-lived 4W66 Patrol was introduced in December 1956, powered by the 4.0 L P engine. The 4W66 was discontinued in June 1960. A wagon version of the 4W66 was called the Carrier, from 1956 to 1959.

=== 4W70 series ===
The Nissan 4W70 Carrier was introduced in 1950 based on the Dodge M37. The 4W70 used the M37&#x27;s chassis, but the 4W60 Patrol&#x27;s drivetrain. The grille was narrower and the front fenders changed. The 4W72 was introduced in 1955 (the 4W71 designation was skipped) with changes to the hood, grille, and headlights. Power increased to 105 hp due to the new Nissan NC engine. Modifications again to the hood, fenders, and grille and an increase in power to led to the 4W73, introduced in 1959 and powered by the Nissan P engine.


== Second generation (60; 1959–1980) ==
The soft-top Nissan Patrol 60 (two-door; wheelbase) and G60 (two-door; wheelbase) were first sold in Australia in 1960. Left-hand drive L60/GL60 models were sold outside of Australia.

Canadian and American customers could get Patrols only from 1962 until 1969. Patrols were sold through Datsun dealerships, making it the only Nissan-badged vehicle sold in the US until the early 1980s, when the Datsun marque was phased out (barring a small test batch of about 100 Nissan Cedrics that was also exported to the US in the early 60s). An extra-long wheelbase version, the H60, was also available.

The 4WD Nissan Patrol 60 series was produced in short, medium, and long wheelbase versions. It had a manual transmission type-F3B83L at first with three and later with four speeds, and a two-speed transfer case with part-time four-wheel drive. The motor was the P engine, a inline overhead-valve six-cylinder, featuring bathtub-shaped combustion chambers and a fully balanced seven-bearing crank shaft. With two doors in front and one at the back and four seats (driver and companion in front, two parallel back seats), the extra-long wheelbase version (the H60) was available with eight-passenger capacity.

In 1963, the KG60 (and KGL60) hard-top models were introduced.

Nissan Australia claimed that the 60 series Patrol was the first vehicle to drive across the Simpson Desert in Australia, and built much publicity around the 50th anniversary of the event, including a re-enactment with a similar vehicle ending on 21 July 2012 to publicise the impending release of their new-generation Y62.


=== Jonga ===
Beginning around 1969, the Indian Army&#x27;s Vehicle Factory Jabalpur began assembling the quarter-ton Nissan Patrol as the Jonga, along with the Nissan 4W73. The name as per Indian army records is an acronym for Jabalpur Ordinance aNd Guncarriage Assembly. Both the Nissan vehicles were fitted with the same engines and shared many parts. The Jonga was briefly sold to civilian customers with a 4.0-litre Hino diesel engine in 1996, but demand was low, due to an uncompetitive price, as well as unappealing looks. Less than 200 units were sold. The Jonga served faithfully until the late 1990s, when it was replaced by the lighter Mahindra and Mahindra MM550. Auctioned ex-Army Jongas, stretched and converted to people carriers, still serve in some rural areas of India.

== Third generation (160; 1980) ==


The 160 series was introduced in 1980 to replace the 60 series. In Australia, these are sold as the MQ Patrol. In 1980, the available engines were the L28, P40, and SD33. All models were available with a four-speed manual transmission, while a three-speed automatic was optional on long-wheelbase vehicles fitted with the L28 engine. All 160 series Patrols came with a two-speed offset transfer case, which featured a 1:1 high gear and a low gear.

All models had leaf-spring suspension. The SD33 vehicles feature 24-volt electronics. Different trim options and colors were available, with options including vinyl or carpet floors and blue or brown interior trim. Air conditioning and power steering were available on deluxe models.

The front differential in all models was C200. In Australia, the standard rear differential was the H233. Some versions featured limited slip differentials. A heavy-duty model rear differential was used in some pickup trucks and P40-engined wagons. This was the H260 model differential. In European markets, where less onerous off-road use was expected, the light-duty C200 rear differential was installed in some vehicles.

In 1983, the MQ was updated as MK Patrol, but this does not appear on any Nissan literature or service manuals. Nissan parts dealers do not recognise these initials. Updates included a revised front end with rectangular headlights and an upgraded front suspension. The four-speed gearbox was revised and a fifth gear was added for most models. The four-speed was still used in some lower specificationed units, presumably to run out stock. A high roof (&quot;Super Roof&quot;) version of the wagon was added at the same time along with the SD33T turbo-diesel option. With , the turbodiesel can reach .

The naturally aspirated SD33 diesel engine was updated at this time. Revisions included the use of three piston rings instead of five, piston oil squirters, and a spin-on oil filter instead of a paper cartridge type. In Australia and some other parts of the world, the SD33-engined Patrols were revised to standard 12-volt electronics. To accommodate the turbodiesel&#x27;s extra power, these models featured a larger clutch (270 versus 240 mm) and larger oil cooler (five rows versus three) than the naturally aspirated version.

These were the last Patrols to carry the Datsun brand; in line with the rest of the Nissan lineup, the Patrol lost its Datsun branding in 1984 in most markets.

=== Spanish production ===
Nissan acquired a 35.85% stake in Motor Ibérica in 1980, which was increased to 54.68% in 1982. In early 1983, the first Spanish-made Nissan Patrol left the plant in Zona Franca, near Barcelona. The first year&#x27;s production, planned to be 4,000 to 5000 cars, was earmarked for Spain and Portugal. Exports were to follow during 1984. Nissan Ibérica-built Patrols originally received a Spanish-made Perkins MD27 four-cylinder diesel engine and Spanish transmission to meet local content regulations. Later on, this was replaced by the Nissan-built A428 (also referred to as the A4.28), which was a version of the Perkins MD27 bored out by for a displacement. The A428 evolved into the turbocharged A428T and then the A428II. Later yet, the six-cylinder RD28 and the RD28T replaced the old Perkins derivatives in Spanish-made cars.

=== 260 (1986–1993) ===
The 260 series was a facelifted version of the Spanish-built 160 (easily spotted by the rectangular headlamps) sold in Europe and available in SWB and LWB with L28, SD33, RD28 and RD28T engines. The SD-engined version, at least in the UK market, had a 24-volt electrical system. Nissan helped Nissan Ibérica amortize plant investments. The 260 Patrol later received a facelift with a new grille similar to that of the Y60 series which succeeded this generation elsewhere. Spanish production continued until 1994 for export and until 2002 for the Spanish domestic market.
== Fourth generation (Y60; 1989) ==
The Y60 was radically different mechanically from its predecessors, as it was the first Patrol with coil-spring suspension, increasing comfort and improving rough-ground handling. All Y60 Patrols had a three-link live axle suspension set-up at the front, with all wagons (SWB, LWB, and SWB LW) adopting a five-link set-up at the rear. The utility model was available with both a leaf-spring rear axle, and from 1994 onwards, a choice of the same coil-spring rear axle as the wagons. Sway bars were included on both front and rear coil-spring live axles. Power steering was standard. Some wagon models had front and rear disc brakes, while the utility retained rear drum brakes. The introduction of a synchromesh on reverse gear was another improvement.

The alternative model codes of GR and GQ were applied to right-hand and left-hand drive models, respectively.

Most models had a rear limited slip differential and some variants had a vacuum or electric solenoid-operated manual rear differential lock. A rear sway bar release mechanism appeared on some models. Some Y60s had a power take-off-driven front-mounted winch, with an in-cab control lever to the right of the gearstick.

The Patrol was also branded as Safari in Japan, depending on which Japanese dealership was offering it – Safari at Nissan Prince Shop and Patrol at Nissan Bluebird Shop. The Safari was available with an optional 24V electrical system, instead of the standard 12V. This was the first series that placed the exterior dimensions in the higher tax bracket for the wider exterior measurement as defined in Japanese Government dimension regulations and the larger engines added a higher road tax obligation for Japanese owners.

The TD42 and TB42 were available with either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic gearbox. The RD28T and the RB30 offered only a five-speed manual.

Trim levels in Australia included:
* DX with manual mirrors, no central locking, vinyl interior, optional AC, manual locking hubs
* RX (from 1995) with electric mirrors, central locking, carpet interior, AC, manual locking hubs
* ST with electric windows, electric mirrors, central locking, carpet interior, AC, automatic locking hubs
* Ti (from late 1989) was equipped with an electronic fuel-injected engine, electric windows, electric mirrors, central locking, velour and carpet interior, rear AC, seven-speaker sound system, alloy three-spoke wheels, and automatic locking hubs. It had a high roof design with sunroof until 1991. Leather and woodgrain trim was made standard in 1992 with the Series 2.

Several dealer-fitted accessories were available, including sunroofs, roof racks, tow bars, driving lights, cargo barriers, and side steps. The TD42 was available with an optional Safari turbocharger at some Australian dealers.

Trim levels in Europe varied by country. These include designations such as SLX, LX, LW, and many others in France. Finnish Patrols came standard with two batteries. LW (1996–1997) featured a lightweight body, reducing the weight by and a special smaller body (). These were produced only for extreme off-road championships. The engine and chassis remained the same.

Two major updates came in Australia, one in 1992 (GQ Series 2), and one in 1995 (minor facelift). The most notable changes in 1992 were the introduction of fuel-injection on the TB42 motor, EGR valve and oil cooler on the RD28T, new seats, new trim, sound deadening, and side intrusion bars. Other 1992 Series 2 refinements included a revised transmission and suspension, and introducing bigger brakes, bigger wheels, and the standardization of limited slip differentials and auto-freewheeling hubs. This update included new seats, trim, and side intrusion bars.

In 1991, the rear indicators, tail lights, and brake lights were relocated to the bumper from the body to meet Australian Design Rules, but they remained unchanged in European versions. In 1994, another set of indicators was placed on the front quarter panel.

In August 1993, the TD42 was lightened to reduce fuel consumption and increase maximum engine speed. This had the side effect of weakening the engine. The original engine can be identified by its silver rocker cover, whereas the lightened engine featured a black rocker cover. The RD28T got some extra changes, moving the vacuum pump from behind the alternator to the top of the engine. Driver-side airbags appeared in some European models.

Changes in 1995 featured a minor facelift, with a redesigned front grille and the RX model entering Australia. Known weaknesses included vibrations from the front end (largely fixed under warranty), cracking hinges on the rear door (due to the spare tyre&#x27;s weight), and rust on rear window frames. The RD28T and TB42 engines suffered from head gasket issues when driven with a heavy foot. European five-speed gearboxes suffered from bearing failures in fifth gear at high mileages. However, the TD42 was highly reliable, as long as it received proper cooling. Patrols are known for their strong axles and good limited slip differential (when so equipped).

All wagons had a 100-liter main fuel tank with the utility having a 100-liter tank and the option of a 100-liter second tank.
=== Engine specifications ===

== Fifth generation (Y61; 1997) ==

Y61 models first appeared in December 1997, available in 4.5- and 4.8-litre petrol, 2.8-, 3.0-, and 4.2-litre turbo-diesel and 4.2-litre turbo-diesel intercooler variants. The alternative model codes of GR and GU were applied to left- and right-hand drive models, respectively.

The drivetrain was changed in this model, including larger CVs and less synchros in the manual gearboxes. The differential housings were widened to fall inline with the new body shape, but centers remained the same (H233 and H260). Some petrol wagons received a coil version of the H260 differential.

Comfort levels were increased over GQ, especially in the seating and NVH areas.

===GU IV onwards===
For the 2005 model year a significant facelift model was released, with new headlights, box flares on each guard and larger tail lights. The troubles that plagued the ZD30 diesel around the variable turbo geometry were resolved by this refresh.

That same year, Nissan stopped selling the Safari in Japan due to poor sales. Nissan also made a two-door pickup version of the Y61 series available as cab chassis and with a style side tray in some markets. The Pickup entered production at the Nissan Shatai plant in April 2011. Although a new generation Patrol/Safari was launched, this Y61 series was kept in production until 2022 for users who required a more rugged, simpler vehicle.

Its TB48DE engine is very popular among the tuning community in the Middle East, especially in the UAE. The TB48DE engine is easily modifiable and is shown to be able to handle over for several sand hills and sand drag challenges in the region.

As of 2014, Nissan discontinued the fifth generation model worldwide, except for South Africa, the Middle East, Paraguay, Haiti, Philippines, Nepal, Bolivia, Sri Lanka, and some African and Eastern European countries where the 4x4 competed against the Toyota Land Cruiser (J70). In Australia, the Y61 was sold until 2016, alongside the Y62.

Several special edition trims have been also been released in respective regions where the Y61 was and are currently being sold, of which some of them are The Presidential edition and 4XPRO edition (Philippines), The Legend edition (Philippines, South Africa and Australia), The &#x27;Special&#x27; Super Safari edition (Middle East), The Falcon edition (Middle East), Gazelle, Gazelle Storm and Gazelle X editions (Middle East).

The Y61 was still being produced for and used by United Nations agencies across different countries as well as some military branches and government sectors. They are mainly being used as security escorts vehicles, chief personnel carriers and off pavement patrol units. Production finally ended in 2023, and the model listing has been removed from official Nissan websites as of 2024.
== Sixth generation (Y62; 2010) ==

The all-new, sixth generation, Y62 series Nissan Patrol was launched on 13 February 2010 in Abu Dhabi. A luxury version (Z62) was sold as the Infiniti QX56 from 2010 (the first time that a Patrol-based vehicle had been sold in North America since 1969), which was later renamed the Infiniti QX80 in 2013. The Y62 was introduced in North America under the Armada nameplate in 2016, for the 2017 model year. It was presented as a replacement for the Titan-based first generation Nissan Armada (WA60).

As of 2017, the Y62 is powered by either a / 4.0-litre VQ40DE V6 engine for the entry level XE and SE trims or a more powerful / 5.6-litre VK56VD V8 engine for the upper level trims. The NISMO edition uses a tuned version of the 5.6-litre V8 producing 28 additional horsepower. Prior to the introduction of the 4.0-litre V6, a lower output / 5.6-litre VK56DE V8 was designated for the entry level trims.

As of 2017, all models come with a 7-speed automatic transmission although Nissan previously offered a 5-speed automatic and also a 6-speed manual for the entry level trim. A variable 4×4 mode package allows switching between four drive modes: sand, on-road, rock and snow. A Hydraulic Body Motion Control System is available. An electronic-locking rear differential, hill start and hill descent control, as well as lane-departure warning, computer assisted braking and stability control. The Infiniti version launched in the United States in 2010, the first Patrol sold there since the 60 series. The Nissan Patrol launched in Australia in early 2013.

The Nissan Patrol is offered in various different trim levels in the Middle East: XE, SE, SE-Platinum City, LE, LE-Titanium, LE-Platinum City and NISMO Edition. In Australia the Ti and Ti-L trim levels are offered.

=== Facelift ===
In June 2014, a minor facelift arrived, with revised tail lights with red elements present, globe housings and built-in LED headlights. A new tan interior was added and new sets of wheels.

Nissan introduced a limited-run Patrol Black Special Edition in 200 units. These cars offer several enhancements such as red seats, chrome detailing and a black matte exterior paint scheme.

The Patrol received a more significant, second facelift in 2019. Changes include a new front bumper featuring a deeper apron and a traditional round housing. The vehicle will be equipped with Nissan&#x27;s Intelligent Mobility driver-assistance features like lane keeping assist, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking for front and rear, rear cross traffic alert, and blind spot monitoring.

In December 2021, the 70th Anniversary was launched in the Middle East. It features a honeycomb grille and the interior gets a 12.3-inch infotainment screen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity along with new 10.1-inch rear entertainment screens.

=== Patrol Desert Edition ===
The Desert Edition comes with the 400 hp 5.6-litre (5552cc) engine, manually-adjusted cloth seats, navigation and regular suspension instead of the hydraulic body-control system.

=== Patrol Nismo ===
On launching the Nismo brand in the Middle East, the Nissan Patrol Nismo was introduced at the launch event in Dubai along with the GT-R Nismo and 370Z Nismo. Unlike the standard Patrol, the Nismo version comes with (5.6-litre) V8 with engine tuned by Nissan&#x27;s Takumi craftsmen. The suspensions is upgraded with Bilstein shocks and fitted with 22-inch forged-alloy wheels.

The facelifted Patrol Nismo was revealed on 31 March 2021.

== Seventh generation (Y63; 2024) ==
The Y63 series Patrol was unveiled in Abu Dhabi on 3 September 2024. Two V6 engine options were initially available: a naturally aspirated, 3.8-litre unit or a more powerful, twin-turbocharged 3.5-litre engine. It went on sale in the Middle East on 1 November 2024. Trims offered for the Middle Eastern market includes XE, SE, SE Titanium, SE Platinum City, LE, LE Titanium and LE Platinum City.

<doc id="1033543" wikidata="Q719611" url="?curid=1033543" title="Cambridge Bay">
<text>Cambridge Bay (Inuinnaqtun: Inuktitut: ; 2021 population 1,760; population centre 1,403) is a hamlet located on Victoria Island in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut, Canada. It is the largest of the two, Ulukhaktok in the Northwest Territories is the other, settlements on Victoria Island. Cambridge Bay is named for Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, while the traditional Inuinnaqtun name for the area is (old orthography) or (new orthography) meaning &quot;good fishing place&quot;.

The traditional language of the area is Inuinnaqtun and is written using the Latin alphabet rather than the syllabics of the Inuktitut writing system. Like Kugluktuk, Bathurst Inlet and Umingmaktok, syllabics are rarely seen and used mainly by the Government of Nunavut.

Cambridge Bay is the largest stop for passenger and research vessels traversing the Arctic Ocean&#x27;s Northwest Passage, a disputed area which the Government of Canada claims are Canadian Internal Waters, while other nations state they are either territorial waters or international waters.

== History ==
===Pre-history===

The first known people to occupy the area were the Pre-Dorset people, somewhere around 1800 BCE, about 4,000 years ago, and were seal and caribou hunters. The next group to enter the area were a Paleo-Eskimo peoples known as the Dorset, who arrived approximately 500 CE. They were the first known people to have fished for the Arctic char. The last of the Paleo-Eskimo people, who appeared here about 800 CE, were the &quot;Tuniit&quot;, and evidence of their living quarters can be seen close to Cambridge Bay. The Tuniit, who were known to the Inuit as giants, were taller and stronger than the Inuit, but were easily scared off.

The next group to arrive were the Thule people, ancestors of the modern Inuit, who arrived in the area around 1250 CE from present day Alaska. The Thule people built food caches and stone houses in the area and were noted for their sophisticated tools. Although there is no positive evidence it is suspected that the Thule may have interacted with the Tuniit.

About 500 years ago, around 1500 CE, the modern Inuit made an appearance. Like the Thule they made use of caches, hunted caribou and fished for char. They also hunted seal from the ice in winter and returned to the land in spring. They were also known to make use of &quot;inukhuk&quot; and built &quot;igluit&quot;. Although they had no collective name, the various groups of Inuit that made use of native copper for tools have since become known as Copper Inuit and are the same people that Vilhjalmur Stefansson called the Blond Eskimos. The main groups that lived or interacted in the Cambridge Bay area were the Ekalluktogmiut (Iqaluktuurmiutat or Ikaluktuurmiut), Ahiagmiut (Ahiarmiut), the Killinirmuit and the Umingmuktogmiut.

===European history===

The first Europeans to reach Cambridge Bay were overland Arctic explorers led by Thomas Simpson in 1839; they were searching for the Northwest Passage and had crossed the sea ice on foot. Another overland expedition led by John Rae reached Cambridge Bay in 1851, and the first ship to reach the bay was HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot; under Richard Collinson who wintered there in 18521853. Both Rae and Collinson were searching for Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition. Collinson&#x27;s ship came from the west, having entered the Canadian Arctic via the Bering Strait. This was the furthest east any large ship travelled from the Bering Strait until Henry Larsen&#x27;s west–east sailing of the Northwest Passage aboard &quot;St. Roch&quot; in 1941.

Cambridge Bay was the site of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) outposts established during the 1920s. Although at this point most Inuit would have continued the traditional lifestyle, and only visited the area rather than live there permanently. The HBC opened a post here in 1921, later than in most places, and built at the site now called the &quot;old town&quot;.

In 1925 the HBC purchased the historic ship &quot;Maud&quot;, which they renamed the &quot;Baymaud&quot;, from the creditors of Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen. The ship sailed to the Arctic in 1926 but it became stuck in the winter ice at Cambridge Bay. The &quot;Maud&quot; was later anchored near the shore and used for various purposes, including the first ever radio weather reports from the Arctic coast. In 1930 the ship sank and, although some material was removed at the time, the ship remained visible for 86 years. A Norwegian plan to salvage the ship and return it to Norway, though initially denied an export permit, was granted on appeal, and was to be carried out in 2014 but was delayed to 2015 due to ice conditions preventing the arrival of salvage equipment until late in the open water season. The planned salvage of 2015 was also delayed, however during the summer of 2016 the &quot;Maud&quot; was raised and prepared for return to Norway during the summer of 2017, where she will be displayed at a museum in Vollen, Asker.

===Post-WW2===
In 1947, following World War II, the Cambridge Bay LORAN Tower was built near the previous location of Cambridge Bay. The construction of the LORAN tower involved hiring Inuit who, after the tower was complete, remained in the area. The tower was demolished 5 August 2014.
In 1954 construction was completed on the Roman Catholic Church. The church, Cambridge Bay&#x27;s first, was constructed from local material using seal oil and sand as mortar, and was used for services until the 1960s. On 27 April 2006, a large portion of the church, which had been designated a heritage site by the Hamlet Council, was destroyed by a fire which the RCMP said was deliberate.

A Distant Early Warning Line site was established in 1955 and about 200 Inuit were hired to help in the construction. The military presence and the services and economy this represented acted as a magnet for Inuit who had previously used the area as a temporary site for meeting, hunting, fishing and trade, and a permanent community was soon established across the bay in its current location. Unlike the majority of the DEW Line radar sites which were abandoned or automated, this site which changed in 1989, known as CAM-MAIN, remains a manned operation, with about 18 people, as part of NORAD&#x27;s North Warning System.

Originally part of the Fort Smith Region, Northwest Territories, Cambridge Bay became the administrative centre for the Kitikmeot Region, Northwest Territories, and remained so for the new Kitikmeot Region after the 1999 division of the Northwest Territories. In 1982 a division plebiscite was held. Although about 80% of the population then living in what is now Nunavut voted in favour of division, Cambridge Bay was one of only two communities to vote against division. Kugluktuk, then called Coppermine, was the other.

===21st century===
The Kitikmeot Regional Health Centre opened in 2005.

Cambridge Bay is the location of the Canadian High Arctic Research Station (CHARS) campus as announced by Prime Minister Stephen Harper on 24 August 2010. This multidisciplinary station is operated year-round by Polar Knowledge Canada, a federal agency. It is a keystone of Canada&#x27;s Northern Strategy. Its mandate is stated:
== Geography ==

Situated between Dease Strait and Queen Maud Gulf on the southeast coast of Victoria Island (&quot;Kitlineq&quot;), part of the Arctic Archipelago, Cambridge Bay is a transportation and administrative centre for the Kitikmeot Region. To the north of the community is Tahiryuaq (also spelt &quot;Tahikyoak&quot; and formerly Ferguson Lake) which flows into Wellington Bay via the Ekalluk River. The Ekalluk River is both an important commercial fishing and archaeological area, and of particular importance is the short section of the river known as &quot;Iqaluktuuq&quot;.

About west of the community lie the Finlayson Islands which were surveyed by Sir Richard Collinson on board HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot; during his search for the lost expedition of Sir John Franklin.

The area was a traditional hunting and fishing location and archaeological sites are often found. The barren-ground caribou, muskox, Arctic char, lake trout and ringed seal were the primary prey, and remain important food sources. Situated east of Cambridge Bay is Ovayok Territorial Park, which includes the large esker known as Uvayuq, formerly Ovayok or Mount Pelly.

===Climate===

Cambridge Bay has a polar climate, no month having an average temperature of or higher, and is listed as &quot;ET&quot; on the Köppen climate classification. It has never recorded a temperature above freezing between 31 October and 19 April. Summers are typically cool and rainy, with pleasant days and chilly nights. Winters are cold, dark, and long, with October being the snowiest month. Snowfall and frosts are possible all year round, though rare during July. Rainfall is usually limited to the summer months of June to September, when the temperature rises above freezing for a few months before dipping back down for another nine months of winter. Average high temperatures reach freezing around June 1 and drop below freezing around September 24. Springs are typically sunny but still very chilly. Autumns are short and crisp, with more frequent cloud cover starting to appear during August and with September being almost constantly cloudy.

The sun is continuously below the horizon, polar night, from approximately 30 November to 11 January and above the horizon, midnight sun, 19 May to 22 July.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Cambridge Bay had a population of 1,760 living in 571 of its 701 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,766. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The median age of the population in 2021 was 30.4 and 76.1% of the people were over 15. Both of these figures are slightly higher than the numbers for Nunavut as a whole (25.6 and 67.5%). In 2021, 82.4% (Nunavut: 85.2%) of the population were listed as Indigenous and 17.6% (Nunavut: 14.8%) as non-Aboriginal. Of the total population 79.5% (Nunavut: 83.7%) were Inuit, 0.9% (Nunavut: 0.3%) Métis and 0.6% (Nunavut: 0.5%) First Nations.

== Canadian High Arctic Research Station campus ==

Cambridge Bay was chosen after a feasibility study that also included Pond Inlet and Resolute as potential locations. Prime Minister Harper announced that, starting in 2012, the Government of Canada would spend $142.4 million over a six-year period to build, equip and provision the station. Additionally, again starting in 2012 and spread over six years, the government would provide $46.2 million for the CHARS Science and Technology Program. The prime minister stated that to provide for the continuing research and operations $26.5 million per year, beginning in 2018–19, would be made available. It is expected that the station will provide 35 to 50 jobs. These jobs, which will be full-time, part-time and seasonal, will start in 2017 and run the Science and Technology Program as well as provide the day-to-day operations of the station. In addition it is expected that 150 jobs will be created during construction for local and other people throughout the north. However, some of these jobs will require the hiring of specialised people from southern locales. Construction began in August 2014, and the campus opened on August 21, 2019. Construction cost $250 million.

==Education==
Several educational services are available, including daycare, preschool, Kullik Ilihakvik (elementary school) named for the traditional stone lamp the &quot;qulliq&quot;, Killinik High School, and a public library and museum located in the high school. The community is also the regional centre for the Kitikmeot Campus of Nunavut Arctic College who oversee the Cambridge Bay Community Learning Centre. Courses range from Adult Basic Education to the Nunavut Teacher Education Program (NTEP), which, in partnership with the University of Regina, is able to offer a Bachelor of Education.

==Land claims==
The Kitikmeot Inuit Association, Nunavut Impact Review Board, and Nunavut Planning Commission have offices in Cambridge Bay, as well as the Lands and Resources Department of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated.

==Religion==
There are three churches in Cambridge Bay: St. George&#x27;s Anglican Church, which is part of the Diocese of Arctic, Our Lady of the Arctic Roman Catholic Church, which is part of the Diocese of Mackenzie–Fort Smith, and the Glad Tidings Pentecostal Church.

==Economy and infrastructure==

There are several businesses in the community. These include a Northern Store (which includes a Quick Stop, selling KFC and Pizza Hut products), the Ikaluktutiak Co-operative, part of the Arctic Co-operatives Limited, a branch of the Royal Bank of Canada and a stand-alone Canada Post postal service. Other community businesses include Jago Services, plumbing and electrical, Qillaq operates construction services, mechanics shop, heating fuel and gasoline sales as well as a service garage. Kalgen&#x27;s operates the Dis &amp; Dat Convenience Store and a separate Dis &amp; Dat Hardware Division (formerly Kitikmeot Supplies), a hardware store.

There is a RCMP detachment here, and the Kitikmeot Law Centre has its offices in the community.

<text>The Book of Documents () or the Classic of History, is one of the Five Classics of ancient Chinese literature. It is a collection of rhetorical prose attributed to figures of ancient China, and served as the foundation of Chinese political philosophy for over two millennia. 

The &quot;Book of Documents&quot; was the subject of one of China&#x27;s oldest literary controversies, between proponents of different versions of the text. A version was preserved from Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s burning of books and burying of scholars by scholar Fu Sheng, in 29 chapters ( ). This group of texts were referred to as &quot;Modern Script&quot; (or &quot;Current Script&quot;; ), because they were written with the script in use at the beginning of the Western Han dynasty. 

A longer version of the &quot;Documents&quot; was said to be discovered in the wall of Confucius&#x27;s family estate in Qufu by his descendant Kong Anguo in the late 2nd century BC. This new material was referred to as &quot;Old Script&quot; ( ), because they were written in the script that predated the standardization of Chinese script during the Qin. Compared to the Modern Script texts, the &quot;Old Script&quot; material had 16 more chapters. However, this seems to have been lost at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, while the Modern Script text enjoyed circulation, in particular in study, called the &quot;Ouyang Shangshu&quot; (). This was the basis of studies by Ma Rong and Zheng Xuan during the Eastern Han.

In 317 AD, Mei Ze presented to the Eastern Jin court a 58-chapter (59 if the preface is counted) &quot;Book of Documents&quot; as Kong Anguo&#x27;s version of the text. This version was accepted, despite the doubts of a few scholars, and later was canonized as part of Kong Yingda&#x27;s project. It was only in the 17th century that Qing dynasty scholar Yan Ruoqu demonstrated that the &quot;old script&quot; were actually fabrications &quot;reconstructed&quot; in the 3rd or 4th centuries AD.

In the transmitted edition, texts are grouped into four sections representing different eras: the legendary reign of Yu the Great, and the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties. The Zhou section accounts for over half the text. Some of its modern-script chapters are among the earliest examples of Chinese prose, recording speeches from the early years of the Zhou dynasty in the late 11th century BC. Although the other three sections purport to record earlier material, most scholars believe that even the New Script chapters in these sections were composed later than those in the Zhou section, with chapters relating to the earliest periods being as recent as the 4th or 3rd centuries BC.

==Textual history==
The history of the various versions of the &quot;Documents&quot; is particularly complex, and has been the subject of a long-running literary and philosophical controversy.

=== Early references ===
According to a later tradition, the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; was compiled by Confucius (551–479 BC) as a selection from a much larger group of documents, with some of the remainder being included in the &quot;Yi Zhou Shu&quot;. However, the early history of both texts is obscure. Beginning with Confucius, writers increasingly drew on the &quot;Documents&quot; to illustrate general principles, though it seems that several different versions were in use.

Six citations to unnamed chapters of the &quot;Documents&quot; appear in the &quot;Analects&quot;. While Confucius invoked the pre-dynastic emperors Yao and Shun, as well as figures from the Xia and Shang dynasties, he complained of the lack of documentation prior to the Zhou. The &quot;Documents&quot; were cited increasingly frequently in works through the 4th century BC, including in the &quot;Mencius&quot;, &quot;Mozi&quot; and &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;. These authors favoured documents relating to Yao, Shun and the Xia dynasty, chapters now believed to have been written in the Warring States period. The chapters currently believed to be the oldest—mostly relating to the early Zhou—were little used by Warring States authors, perhaps due to the difficulty of the archaic language or a less familiar worldview. Fewer than half the passages quoted by these authors are present in the received text. Authors such as Mencius and Xunzi, while quoting the &quot;Documents&quot;, refused to accept it as genuine in its entirety. Their attitude contrasts with the reverence later shown to the text during the Han dynasty, when its compilation was attributed to Confucius.

=== Han dynasty: Modern and Old Scripts ===

Many copies of the work were destroyed in the Burning of Books during the Qin dynasty.
Fu Sheng reconstructed part of the work from hidden copies in the late 3rd to early 2nd century BC, at the start of the succeeding Han dynasty. The texts that he transmitted were known as the &quot;Modern Script&quot; ( ) because it was written in the clerical script.
It originally consisted of 29 chapters, but the &quot;Great Speech&quot; 太誓 chapter was lost shortly afterwards and replaced by a new version. The remaining 28 chapters were later expanded into 30 when Ouyang Gao divided the &quot;Pangeng&quot; chapter into three sections.

During the reign of Emperor Wu, renovations of the home of Confucius are said to have uncovered several manuscripts hidden within a wall, including a longer version of the &quot;Documents&quot;.
These texts were referred to as &quot;Old Script&quot; because they were written in the pre-Qin seal script.
They were transcribed into clerical script and interpreted by Confucius&#x27; descendant Kong Anguo.
Han dynasty sources give contradictory accounts of the nature of this find. According to the commonly repeated account of the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, the &quot;Old Script&quot; texts included the chapters preserved by Fu Sheng, another version of the &quot;Great Speech&quot; chapter and some 16 additional ones.
It is unclear what happened to these manuscripts. According to the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, Liu Xiang collated the Old Script version against the three main &quot;Modern Script&quot; traditions, creating a version of the &quot;Documents&quot; that included both groups. This was championed by his son Liu Xin,
who requested in a letter to Emperor Ai the establishment of a &quot;boshi&quot; position for its study. But this did not happen. Most likely, this edition put together by the imperial librarians was lost in the chaos that ended the Western Han dynasty, and the later movement of the capital and imperial library. 

A list of 100 chapter titles was also in circulation; many are mentioned in the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, but without quoting the text of the other chapters.

The &quot;shu&quot; were designated one of the Five Classics when Confucian works made official by Emperor Wu of Han, and (&#x27;classic&#x27;) was added to its name.
The term &#x27;venerated documents&#x27; was also used in the Eastern Han.
The Xiping Stone Classics, set up outside the imperial academy in 175–183 but since destroyed, included a Modern Script version of the &quot;Documents&quot;.
Most Han dynasty scholars ignored the Old Script version, and it disappeared by the end of the dynasty.

=== Claimed recovery of Old Script texts ===
A version of the &quot;Documents&quot; that included the &quot;Old Script&quot; texts was allegedly rediscovered by the scholar Mei Ze during the 4th century, and presented to the imperial court of the Eastern Jin.
His version consisted of the 31 modern script texts in 33 chapters, and 18 additional old script texts in 25 chapters, with a preface and commentary purportedly written by Kong Anguo. This was presented as &quot;Guwen Shangshu&quot; 古文尚書, and was widely accepted. It was the basis of the ( &#x27;Correct interpretation of the &quot;Documents&quot;&#x27;) published in 653 and made the official interpretation of the &quot;Documents&quot; by imperial decree. The oldest extant copy of the text, included in the Kaicheng Stone Classics (833–837), contains all of these chapters.

Since the Song dynasty, starting from Wu Yu (), many doubts had been expressed concerning the provenance of the allegedly rediscovered &quot;Old Script&quot; texts in Mei Ze&#x27;s edition. In the 16th century, Mei Zhuo () published a detailed argument that these chapters, as well as the preface and commentary, were forged in the 3rd century AD using material from other historical sources such as the &quot;Zuo Commentary&quot; and the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;. Mei identified the sources from which the forger had cut and pasted text, and even suggested Huangfu Mi as a probable culprit. In the 17th century, Yan Ruoqu&#x27;s unpublished but widely distributed manuscript entitled &quot;Evidential analysis of the Old Script Documents&quot; () convinced most scholars that the rediscovered Old Script texts were fabricated in the 3rd or 4th centuries.

=== Modern discoveries ===
New light has been shed on the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; by the recovery between 1993 and 2008 of caches of texts written on bamboo slips from tombs of the state of Chu in Jingmen, Hubei. These texts are believed to date from the late Warring States period, around 300 BC, and thus predate the burning of the books during the Qin dynasty. The Guodian Chu Slips and the Shanghai Museum corpus include quotations of previously unknown passages of the work. The Tsinghua Bamboo Slips includes a version of the transmitted text &quot;Golden Coffer&quot;, with minor textual differences, as well as several documents in the same style that are not included in the received text. The collection also includes two documents that the editors considered to be versions of the Old Script texts &quot;Common Possession of Pure Virtue&quot; and &quot;Command to Fu Yue&quot;. Other authors have challenged these straightforward identifications.

==Contents==
In the orthodox arrangement, the work consists of 58 chapters, each with a brief preface traditionally attributed to Confucius, and also includes a preface and commentary, both purportedly by Kong Anguo.
An alternative organization, first used by Wu Cheng, includes only the Modern Script chapters, with the chapter prefaces collected together, but omitting the Kong preface and commentary.
In addition, several chapters are divided into two or three parts in the orthodox form.

===Nature of the chapters===
With the exception of a few chapters of late date, the chapters are represented as records of formal speeches by kings or other important figures.
Most of these speeches are of one of five types, indicated by their titles:
* Consultations ( ) between the king and his ministers (2 chapters),
* Instructions ( ) to the king from his ministers (1 chapter),
* Announcements ( ) by the king to his people (8 chapters),
* Declarations ( ) by a ruler on the occasion of a battle (6 chapters), and
* Commands ( ) by the king to a specific vassal (7 chapters).

Classical Chinese tradition lists six types of &quot;Shu&quot;, beginning with &quot;dian&quot; , Canons (2 chapters in the Modern corpus).

According to Su Shi (1037–1101), it is possible to single out Eight Announcements of the early Zhou, directed to the Shang people. Their titles only partially correspond to the modern chapters marked as &quot;gao&quot; (apart from the nos. 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 that mention the genre, Su Shi names nos. 16 &quot;Zi cai&quot;, 19 &quot;Duo shi&quot; and 22 &quot;Duo fang&quot;).

As pointed out by Chen Mengjia (1911–1966), announcements and commands are similar, but differ in that commands usually include granting of valuable objects, land or servants to their recipients.

Guo Changbao claims that the graph for announcement (), known since the Oracle bone script, also appears on two bronze vessels (&quot;He zun&quot; and &quot;Shi Zhi gui&quot; ), as well as in the &quot;six genres&quot; of the &quot;Zhou li&quot;

In many cases a speech is introduced with the phrase ( &#x27;The king seemingly said&#x27;), which also appears on commemorative bronze inscriptions from the Western Zhou period, but not in other received texts.
Scholars interpret this as meaning that the original documents were prepared scripts of speeches, to be read out by an official on behalf of the king.

===Traditional organization===
The chapters are grouped into four sections representing different eras: the semi-mythical reign of Yu the Great, and the three ancient dynasties of the Xia, Shang and Zhou.
The first two sections – on Yu the Great and the Xia dynasty – contain two chapters each in the Modern Script version, and though they purport to record the earliest material in the &quot;Documents&quot;, from the 2nd millennium BC, most scholars believe they were written during the Warring States period.
The Shang dynasty section contains five chapters, of which the first two – the &quot;Speech of King Tang&quot; and &quot;Pan Geng&quot; – recount the conquest of the Xia by the Shang and their leadership&#x27;s migration to a new capital (now identified as Anyang).
The bulk of the Zhou dynasty section concerns the reign of King Cheng of Zhou (r. –1006 BC) and the king&#x27;s uncles, the Duke of Zhou and Duke of Shao.
The last four Modern Script chapters relate to the later Western Zhou and early Spring and Autumn periods.

== Dating of the Modern Script chapters ==
Not all of the Modern Script chapters are believed to be contemporaneous with the events they describe, which range from the legendary emperors Yao and Shun to early in the Spring and Autumn period.
Six of these chapters concern figures prior to the first evidence of writing, the oracle bones dating from the reign of the Late Shang king Wu Ding.
Moreover, the chapters dealing with the earliest periods are the closest in language and focus to classical works of the Warring States period.

The five announcements in the Documents of Zhou feature the most archaic language, closely resembling inscriptions found on Western Zhou bronzes in both grammar and vocabulary.
They are considered by most scholars to record speeches of King Cheng of Zhou, as well as the Duke of Zhou and Duke of Shao, uncles of King Cheng who were key figures during his reign (late 11th century BC). They provide insight into the politics and ideology of the period, including the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven, explaining how the once-virtuous Xia had become corrupt and were replaced by the virtuous Shang, who went through a similar cycle ending in their replacement by the Zhou.
The &quot;Timber of Rottlera&quot;, &quot;Numerous Officers&quot;, &quot;Against Luxurious Ease&quot; and &quot;Numerous Regions&quot; chapters are believed to have been written somewhat later, in the late Western Zhou period.
A minority of scholars, pointing to differences in language between the announcements and Zhou bronzes, argue that all of these chapters are products of a commemorative tradition in the late Western Zhou or early Spring and Autumn periods.

Chapters dealing with the late Shang and the transition to Zhou use less archaic language.
They are believed to have been modelled on the earlier speeches by writers in the Spring and Autumn period, a time of renewed interest in politics and dynastic decline.
The later chapters of the Zhou section are also believed to have been written around this time.
The &quot;Gaozong Rongri&quot; chapter comprises only 82 characters, and its interpretation was already disputed in Western Han commentaries.
Pointing to the similarity of its title to formulas found in the Anyang oracle bone inscriptions, David Nivison proposed that the chapter was written or recorded by a collateral descendant of Wu Ding in the late Shang period some time after 1140 BC.

The &quot;Pan Geng&quot; chapter (later divided into three parts) seems to be intermediate in style between this group and the next. It is the longest speech in the &quot;Documents&quot;, and is unusual in its extensive use of analogy. Scholars since the Tang dynasty have noted the difficult language of the &quot;Pan Geng&quot; and the Zhou Announcement chapters. Citing the archaic language and worldview, Chinese scholars have argued for a Shang dynasty provenance for the &quot;Pan Geng&quot; chapters, with considerable editing and replacement of the vocabulary by Zhou dynasty authors accounting for the difference in language from Shang inscriptions.

The chapters dealing with the legendary emperors, the Xia dynasty and the transition to Shang are very similar in language to such classics as the &quot;Mencius&quot; (late 4th century BC).
They present idealized rulers, with the earlier political concerns subordinate to moral and cosmological theory, and are believed to be the products of philosophical schools of the late Warring States period.
Some chapters, particularly the &quot;Tribute of Yu&quot;, may be as late as the Qin dynasty.

== Influence in the West==
When Jesuit scholars prepared the first translations of Chinese Classics into Latin, they called the &quot;Documents&quot; the &quot;Book of Kings&quot;, making a parallel with the Books of Kings in the Old Testament. They saw Shang Di as the equivalent of the Christian God, and used passages from the &quot;Documents&quot; in their commentaries on other works.

<doc id="1033553" wikidata="Q1972859" url="?curid=1033553" title="Ndlela kaSompisi">
<text>Ndlela kaSompisi (died February 1840) was a key general to Zulu Kings Shaka and Dingane. He rose to prominence as a highly effective warrior under Shaka. Dingane appointed him as his &quot;inDuna&quot;, or chief advisor. He was also the principal commander of Dingane&#x27;s armies. However, Ndlela&#x27;s failure to defeat the Boers under Andries Pretorius and a rebellion against Dingane led to his execution. This made him a failure in the eyes of his people.

==Career==
According to E. A. Ritter, Ndlela was a &quot;Ntuli cannibal recruit&quot; to Shaka&#x27;s army. His name means &quot;road&quot; or &quot;path&quot;. During the Ndwandwe–Zulu War Ndela distinguished himself by his fighting ability, performing &quot;incredible deeds of destruction&quot; on Shaka&#x27;s enemies. He was severely wounded in battle with the Ndwandwe. Despite his non-Zulu origins, he was rapidly promoted and was appointed chief of the Ntuli. When his practice of promoting non-Zulus was questioned, Shaka is said to have replied, &quot;Any man who joins the Zulu Army becomes a Zulu. Thereafter his promotion is purely a question of merit, irrespective of the road (ndlela) he came by&quot;, referring to the most famous of his adopted soldiers.

After Dingane assassinated and succeeded Shaka he remained the highest ranking political and military officer in Dingane’s regime. With Dingane’s volatility and thirst for blood, Ndlela proved he was a shrewd operator by maintaining these highly influential positions in a changing regime where Dingane was quick to order an execution of his perceived enemies. A defender of traditional Zulu culture, Ndlela strongly objected when Dingane allowed Francis Owen of London&#x27;s Anglican Church Missionary Society to set up a mission at the Zulu capital, uMgungundlovu.

He served as Dingane&#x27;s inDunankulu (chief adviser), Ndunankulu (Prime Minister) and uMkhuzi wamaButho kaZulu (Commander-In-Chief of the Zulu Army). He led a campaign against the Northern Ndebele in 1837, but the war was inconclusive. He allegedly persuaded Dingane to kill Piet Retief and crush the Boers. 

He was general of Dingane&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Blood River (16 December 1838) with Dambuza Nzobo, a significant defeat for the Zulus as the spears and large numbers of Zulus were unable to breach the Boer laager of Andries Pretorius defended with muskets.

Neither Shaka nor Dingane had children. Mindful of the lineage of the Zulu kings, Ndlela repeatedly defied Dingane&#x27;s request that he assassinate Mpande, half-brother of Shaka and Dingane as he was a threat to Dingane&#x27;s power. He argued that it would diminish his greatness and that, in any case, Mpande did not aspire to the throne. The Battle of Maqongqo where the forces of Mpande and Dingane clashed in 1840 culminated in Dingane calling Ndlela a traitor. A significant portion of Ndlela&#x27;s army deserted to Mpande&#x27;s general Nongalaza. Ndlela withdrew his remaining force rather than be overwhelmed. This resulted in a great loss for Dingane against his brother Mpande who had co-opted the Boers to fight on his side. Dingane ordered Ndlela&#x27;s death through slow strangulation by cow hide thong.

==Mpande and after==

Ndlela&#x27;s inaction against Mpande preserved the blood line of the Zulu monarchy. Mpande, the king after Dingane, was married to Ndlela&#x27;s daughter Msukilethe. Mpande&#x27;s son Cetshwayo in turn succeeded him. All subsequent Zulu monarchs are descended from Mpande.

==Monument==
In 2004, a monument to Ndlela kaSompisi was unveiled in KwaZulu Natal, attended by Jacob Zuma.

<text>Want Two is the fourth album by American-Canadian singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright. The album was released on November 16, 2004. Four of the tracks on this album were released in the summer of 2004 as the EP &quot;Waiting for a Want&quot; on the iTunes music store.

&quot;Want Two&quot; is, according to Wainwright, the darker sibling of 2003&#x27;s &quot;Want One&quot; – its subject matter concerned with &quot;the world we live in&quot; (RW Geffen Bio) after &quot;Want One&quot;&#x27;s focus on the intensely personal. The artist&#x27;s song selections here show his range to be broad, veering from romantic ballad (&quot;Peach Trees&quot;) to tragic ballad (&quot;This Love Affair&quot;), sophisticated pop (&quot;The One You Love&quot;) to third person/first person narrative lament (&quot;The Art Teacher&quot;), personal tongue in cheek manifesto (&quot;Gay Messiah&quot;), to a classical pop hybrid written about Jeff Buckley (&quot;Memphis Skyline&quot;) and songs beyond category. &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; is used in the trailer for the 2007 film &quot;Trade&quot;.

Mother Kate McGarrigle and aunt Anna (McGarrigle) both perform and sing on &quot;Hometown Waltz&quot;. Anohni of 2005 Mercury Prize winners Antony and the Johnsons sings lead vocal alongside Wainwright on &quot;Old Whore&#x27;s Diet&quot;.
The initial UK version of the record contains bonus live tracks, &quot; and &quot; (written by French Canadian songwriter Gilles Vigneault).

<text>Brenninkmeijer () is a Roman Catholic Dutch, German and Swiss family of manufacturers, which own an international chain of clothing stores. Originally the family came from Tecklenburger Land (Westphalia) in Germany, selling linen in Friesland in the Netherlands. In 1840 two members of the family founded C&amp;A company in Sneek. Their descendants discovered the potential of the stock of produced ready-made garment. Today, the family owns the Cofra Holding AG, based in Switzerland which in turn controls the C&amp;A fashion business, a private equity company, a real estate fund and two banks. The company focuses its efforts on real estate, sustainable energy and financial services.

== History ==
===19th century===
From the end of the 18th century, several Brenninkmeyers lived in Sneek, where Herman and his son Andreas founded a company. They were seasonal wandering merchants (peddlers), but forced by juridical restrictions to settle. Around 1835 they were assisted by their relatives Clemens and August from Mettingen (and surroundings). In 1841, Clemens and August founded a company (C&amp;A) and stocked their goods in a warehouse, eliminating the need to travel. Around 1853 Clemens lived in Mettingen and August in Sneek, at a distance of 200 km to the NW. This small town in the north of the Netherlands became the location of their first shop in 1860; selling linen and cotton fabrics, sheets, bedding but also complete wedding suites. (Clothing manufacturers were the first sewing machine customers, and used them to produce the first ready-to-wear clothing.) In 1881 a branch was opened in Leeuwarden, and in 1893 and 1896 in Amsterdam; the possibility to buy on credit was abolished and the company started to sell menswear. In 1897, the family stopped to go peddling. Meanwhile more relatives arrived from Mettingen as apprentices. A carefully designed rulebook ‘Unitas’ ensured that Brenninkmeyer sons and daughters enter the business in leadership positions at an early age, guaranteeing that the company was fully controlled by the family.

===20th century===

Bernard Joseph Brenninkmeijer (Mettingen 1871 – Rome 1945), the youngest son of Clemens, is considered to be the father of the C&amp;A formula. He started discounting in Amsterdam (&quot;Rekenen in Centen, in plaats van Procenten&quot;). In 1906 he repositioned the company which was the first step towards future years of exceptional successes. In his store in Amsterdam, he was one of the world&#x27;s first discounters, introducing fixed prices. Instead of using a customary &quot;keystone&quot; gross margin of 50% he only asked for 25% or less. His insight: &quot;you could cut your profit mark-up dramatically. Even with much a lower margin, the far greater volume of sales would still boost the bottom line profit. This major innovation has had a great impact on people&#x27;s thinking within all C&amp;A companies even to this very day.&quot;

By 1910 there were ten stores in the Netherlands, also in Groningen and Rotterdam. In 1911, the company opened the first German store in Berlin, managed by Clemens (1862–1938). In 1922, the company started a store in Oxford Street. During WWII the company profited from (expropriated) Jewish real estate and Ostarbeiter; after the war from the economic boom. The first store in the USA was opened in 1948. In 1967 C&amp;A cooperated with Twiggy as designer; shops were opened in Belgium. In the 1970s the expansion of C&amp;A went on: also Switzerland, France, Spain and Japan were added as markets. In 1981, Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld worked for C&amp;A. In the 1990s the company opened shops in Portugal and Mexico.

According to NRC Handelsblad, the family also financed the establishment of the CDA and the Pope&#x27;s arrival in the Netherlands in 1985. The Brenninkmeijers have meanwhile donated more than a billion euros to the Catholic church. Since 1995, the Brenninkmeijers&#x27; philanthropic activities have been managed more centrally via Porticus and Benevolentia. Until the mid-nineties only male descendants in a direct line of Clemens and August Brenninkmeijer could become shareholders.

===21st century===
C&amp;A is an apparel company with headquarters in Vilvoorde and Düsseldorf. In 2017 it operated approximately 1,575 stores in 18 European countries. These companies are linked through the Cofra group, based in Zug, a tax haven in Switzerland. The company closed its stores in the United Kingdom and Denmark in 2000. In the 21st century many new stores have been opened in Eastern Europe countries. The company has also opened stores in China (2007). C&amp;A-Online launched in Germany in 2008. Across their businesses, the Brenninkmeyers employ more than 35,000 people worldwide.

For a period of time Eastern Mountain Sports, Steinbach, Ohrbach&#x27;s, Maurices, Miller&#x27;s Outpost and others were owned through the American Retail Group. In the 1980s and 1990s, they owned the Comark group in Canada, which included Bretton&#x27;s department stores, Clark Shoes and Collacut luggage stores. The Canadian operations were sold in 2005 to KarpReilly, LLC of Greenwich, Connecticut.

In 2009, the Brenninkmeijer family founded the Draiflessen Collection in Mettingen. In 2016 Kai Bosecker published his &quot;Family Businesses as a Phenomenon: Insights&quot; that the family had commissioned into the role of C&amp;A during the Nazi regime. Mark Spoerer published &quot;C&amp;A. Ein Familienunternehmen in Deutschland, den Niederlanden und Großbritannien 1911–1961&quot;. The Brenninkmeijers practise philanthropy (10% of the profit) through at least 58 foundations around the world. C&amp;A Brazil went public.

In 2011, Jean-Louis Brenninkmeijer founded Little Canada. A Toronto-based organization constructing a miniature model of Canada.

In 2015, Bregal Partners, an arm of Cofra Holding, began investing in the fishing industry of the United States. The firm owns stake in Seattle-based American Seafoods and Blue Harvest Fisheries in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Blue Harvest Fisheries is the single largest groundfish permit holder in New England.

In 2017, Alain Caparros succeeded Philippe Brenninkmeijer as CEO of C&amp;A Europe; he was the first non-family member at the helm of the company. In 2019 the CEO Post for C&amp;A Europe was held by Edward Brenninkmeijer; in 2021 by Giny Boer, the first woman at the top. Meanwhile C&amp;A sold its Mexico and China businesses to local investors.

==Fortune==
In addition to textile retailer C&amp;A, the Brenninkmeijers own and control several companies in the private equity, real estate and financial services industries. named Anthos Fund &amp; Asset Management, Redevco, and Bregal. Through their investment vehicles, they have stake in two of the largest fishing companies on each coast of the United States.

==Notable members==
The family seems to have 12 branches and 500 members. Albert Brenninkmeijer (born 1974), married Princess Carolina of Bourbon-Parma, a cousin of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, on 21 April 2012 in Wijk bij Duurstede.

From 1988 to 2011, Mother Theresa Brenninkmeyer was the prioress, later abbess, of a convent in Sostrup Castle (Denmark).

Two family members have entered the entertainment industry, producer Stephan Brenninkmeijer and actor Philippe Brenninkmeyer.

<text>Ateneo de Davao University (AdDU; ) is a private Catholic basic and higher education institution in Davao City, Davao del Sur, Philippines. It is run by the Philippine Jesuit Province. Before the Jesuits took over administration of the school in 1948, it was called St. Peter&#x27;s Parochial School. The Jesuits renamed the school &quot;Ateneo de Davao&quot; after taking control.

At the time, the Jesuits named all the schools that they were opening &quot;Ateneo.&quot; Ateneo de Davao is the seventh school in the country to be named Ateneo by the Jesuits. The university has five undergraduate schools, namely, the School of Arts and Sciences, School of Business and Governance, the School of Engineering and Architecture, the School of Education, and the School of Nursing. The graduate programs are under these units as well. The College of Law is a separate unit within the university. The university also runs a grade school and high school, both Junior High and Senior High.

The university was granted &quot;Institutional Accreditation&quot; by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities, in which only six universities in the country were given such recognition, and was also granted autonomous status by the Philippine Commission on Higher Education. 

==History==
At the request of Bishop Luis del Rosario, S.J., of the Archdiocese of Zamboanga, which then included the Davao region, the Jesuit fathers took over St. Peter&#x27;s Parochial School and founded the Ateneo de Davao in 1948. The founding fathers were led by Fr. Theodore E. Daigler S.J., who became the first rector of the school. The other founding Jesuits were Alfredo Paguia S.J., Grant Quinn S.J., Scholastics James Donelan S.J. and Rodolfo Malasmas S.J. On May 20, 1948, Ateneo de Davao was registered with the SEC (SEC Registration No. 3467) as a non-stock, non-profit, education institution.

When the Ateneo de Davao formally opened on June 28, 1948, it offered grades V and VI and 1st to 3rd year high school. There were 71 elementary students and 131 high school students who started in a wooden building on a six-hectare lot in Matina.

The Jacinto campus (3.5 hectares) was acquired in 1951 with the support of the Most Rev. Clovis Thibault, P.M.E., Bishop-Prelate of Davao. The campus provided classrooms for high school students in the daytime and college courses in the evenings. College course offerings then were liberal arts, commerce, education, associate in arts, pre-law, secretarial and an elementary teacher&#x27;s certificate program. The College Department opened in July 1951 with 130 male students. College classes were held in the wooden Bellarmine Hall. In 1953, the Ateneo de Davao College became co-educational. By then, there were nine collegiate course programs offered. 

Ateneo De Davao became one of the centers of student activism in Mindanao during the Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos period. Some people would later be added to the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani Wall of Remembrance, which honors victims of the resistance against the authoritarian government of Ferdinand Marcos.

==University campuses==
The university operates in three campuses in Davao City, all housing research and academic units. The 4-hectare campus nestled between Roxas Avenue and Jacinto Street is the metropolitan or &quot;downtown&quot; campus as it is situated in the central business district of the city. When it was acquired in 1951, the site was only 3.5 hectares. In 2012, an adjacent 5,000 square meter lot (0.5 hectare) was added to the existing campus. The undergraduate and graduate schools, and the College of Law are housed in this campus and have a combined student population of around 8,000.

The grade school and high school units are located in a 7.2-hectare campus in the Matina district, a residential area south of the downtown district. The Matina campus was originally a 6-hectare lot, and an adjacent 1.2 hectare lot was added to the campus in 2012. In June 2018, the Senior High School opened in Bangkal district. At four hectares, this campus features four school buildings and one administration building with 4 stories each.

==Academic institutions==

The Ateneo de Davao&#x27;s academic programs include the humanities, education, accounting, business, law, social sciences, philosophy, nursing, social work, theology, biology, chemistry, mathematics, environmental science, computer science and information technology, engineering, architecture, public administration, anthropology, Islamic studies, sociology, economics, and political science. The university also heavily engages itself in research and community social involvement.

===Undergraduate and graduate units===
====School of Arts and Sciences====
The School of Arts and Sciences (SAS) was opened in 1951 with 130 students enrolled in various offerings, namely: liberal arts, commerce, education, associate in arts, pre-law, secretarial, and elementary teacher&#x27;s certificate program. In subsequent years, other college programs were added. After the school obtained university status in 1977, the list of programs was further expanded.

Currently, the SAS offers different degree programs both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The SAS is subdivided into four clusters: Computer Studies, Humanities and Letters, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and Social Sciences.

====School of Business and Governance====
The undergraduate business courses of the Ateneo de Davao University were under the School of Arts and Sciences; the MBA, MPA and MAN programs were under the graduate business programs and the MPA-GA program was under the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In an effort to have all the business courses integrated, the AdDU School of Business &amp; Governance (SBG) was formed.

The SBG was launched on April 1, 2000. Under its aegis are accountancy, business management, entrepreneurship, human resource development and management, finance, accounting technology, marketing and graduate business programs as well as support programs in computer literacy and research and extension offices.

====School of Nursing====
The university began offering a master&#x27;s degree program in Nursing Administration in the 1970s. It opened an undergraduate nursing program in 2001. The program started under the auspices of the Natural Sciences and Math Division, and eventually became the School of Nursing (SON).

In 2009, the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) released a list of the top 20 nursing schools in the Philippines that have met the standards set by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC). The School of Nursing of the Ateneo de Davao University was in the 18th place of the Top 20 Nursing Schools in the Philippines.

====School of Engineering and Architecture====

<text>Gela ( ; ) is a city and (municipality) in the Autonomous Region of Sicily, Italy; in terms of area and population, it is the largest municipality on the southern coast of Sicily. Gela is part of the Province of Caltanissetta and is one of the few in Italy with a population and area that exceed those of the provincial capital.Gela was founded in 698 BC by Greek colonists from Rhodes and Crete; it was an influential &quot;polis&quot; of Magna Graecia in the 7th and 6th centuries BC and became one of the most powerful cities until the 5th c. BC. Aeschylus, the famous playwright, lived here and died in 456 BC. In 1943, during the Invasion of Sicily, the Allied forces made their first landing on the island at Gela.

==History==

===Ancient era===


Archaeology has shown that the acropolis of Gela was occupied during the Copper Age in the 4th millennium BC and during the Bronze Age in the 2nd millennium BC.

Gela was founded around 688 BC by colonists from Rhodes and Crete, 45 years after the founding of Syracuse. Archaeology has shown that they chose to settle on the northern slope of the Molino a Vento extending for more than 400 m towards the west up to Castelluccio.

The city was named after the river Gela, the name of which derives from &quot;gela&quot;, the Sicilian-dialect word for &quot;winter frost&quot;. According to Diodorus Siculus, the city was founded by Antiphemus and Entimus.

Gela immediately had violent clashes with the Sicani of the area: Antiphemus waged a war against the city of Omphace, not far from Gela. The Gelans won and defeated the city, also taking away a statue that was said to have been made by the mythical sculptor Daedalus.

The Temple of Athena Lindia, protector of the city, was built on the acropolis over the protohistoric remains in the 7th century BC, This was then incorporated into a second temple in the 6th century, also dedicated to Athena.

The Greeks established many colonies in Magna Graecia and for many centuries they had a major influence on the area. Gela flourished and the expansionist policy of the tyrants of Gela, in particular Cleander and especially Hippocrates, led to the city founding a series of satellite colonies, including Akragas (Agrigento), and also managed to subdue several cities: Kallipolis (according to some, today&#x27;s Giarre), Leontini (Lentini), Naxos (Sicily) (Giardini-Naxos) and Zancle (Messina). Only Syracuse, with the help of her former colonizing city Corinth and Corcyra managed to escape. When Kamarina, a Syracusan colony, rebelled in 492 BC, Hippocrates intervened to wage war against Syracuse. After defeating the Syracusan army at the Heloros river, Hippocrates besieged the city but was persuaded to retreat in exchange for possession of Camarina. Hippocrates died in 491 BC in a battle against the Siculi, the native Sicilian people.

Hippocrates was succeeded by Gelon, who in 484 BC conquered Syracuse and moved his seat of government there. His brother Hiero was given control over Gela. When Theron of Agrigento conquered Himera and a Carthaginian army disembarked in Sicily to counter him, he asked for help from Gela and Syracuse. Gelo and Hiero were victorious in the subsequent battle of Himera, in which the Carthaginian leader Hamilcar died.

After the death of Gelon in 478 BC, Hiero moved to Syracuse, leaving Gela to Polyzelos. Many of the &quot;Geloi&quot; returned from Syracuse in this period and the city regained some of its power. Aeschylus died in this city in 456 BC.

In 425 BC during the Sicilian wars, Gela was an ally of Syracuse, while Kamarina was on the opposing side although they were traditional allies. They concluded an armistice in the late summer. Since a bilateral peace was unlikely to last if the rest of the island remained at war, the two cities invited all the belligerents to convene and discuss peace terms. The cities not only sent ambassadors but also granted them unusually broad power to conduct diplomacy. In 424 BC at the Congress of Gela, the Sicilian cities made peace on the basis of &quot;Sicily for the Sicilians&quot;.

Gela fought the Sicilian League that pushed back the Athenian attempt to conquer the island in 415 BC (see Sicilian Expedition).

In 406 BC, the Carthaginians conquered Agrigento and destroyed it. Gela asked for the help of Dionysius I of Syracuse but Dionysius did not arrive and, after heroic deeds, the following year, Gela was ruined and its treasures sacked. The survivors took refuge in Syracuse. In 397 BC, they returned in Gela and joined Dionysius II in his struggle for freedom from the invaders and in 383 BC their independence was acknowledged.

Timoleon rebuilt the city walls in 338 BC after the destruction by the Carthaginians. The Acropolis lost its sacred character and was populated with houses arranged on the flanks of the hill. The monumental area of the city was moved to Capo Soprano.

Under Agathocles (317-289 BC), the city again suffered internal strife between the people and the &quot;aristoi&quot; (aristocrats). When the Carthaginians arrived in 311 BC, they met little resistance and captured the city with the help of the &quot;aristoi&quot;. The acropolis site at Molino a Vento was then definitively abandoned.

In 282 BC Phintias of Agrigento ruthlessly destroyed Gela to crush its power forever and transferred its population to his new city of Phintias next to present-day Licata. This assertion, however, seems to be refuted by a careful reading of the sources that name the Mamertines as the real destroyers of the city, five years earlier.

===Roman, Byzantine and mediaeval ages===
The city subsequently disappeared from the chronicles. Under Roman rule, a small settlement, which is mentioned by Virgil, Pliny the Elder, Cicero, and Strabo, still existed. Later it was a minor Byzantine center. Under the Arabs, it was known as the &quot;City of Columns&quot;.

A later city called &quot;Terranova&quot;, by which name it remained known until 1928, was founded in 1233 by Frederick II. The new settlement was located west of ancient Gela, and was provided with a castle and a line of walls. Terranova, also known as Heracles, was a royal possession until 1369, when King Frederick III of Aragon gave it to Manfredi III Chiaramonte. In 1401, however, after the treason of Andrea Chiaramonte, the city was confiscated and was assigned to several Aragonese feudataries. In 1530, the title of Marquis of Terranova was created for Giovanni Tagliavia Aragona, and in 1561, his son Carlo obtained the title of Duke. The Terranova Aragona held the city until 1640, when the marriage of Giovanna Tagliavia Aragona and Ettore Pignatelli give the possession to the Pignatelli, who held the fiefdom until 1812.

===Modern era===

Terranova was renamed Terranova di Sicilia, and in 1927, it was renamed Gela.

In World War II, during the initial assault on 10 July 1943 of the Allied invasion of Sicily, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and the 82nd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion landed on the beaches of Gela, which were strongly defended by the Livorno Division. The Allied forces repelled an Italian and German armored counter-attack at Gela. The U.S. Army Engineers built several advanced landing airfields, which were used by the Twelfth Air Force during the Italian Campaign, in the area around the city.

After the war, a large oil refinery was built in Gela&#x27;s territory as a part of Eni&#x27;s industrial expansion plan in South Italy. The refinery was intended to help the region&#x27;s economy but instead it caused significant damage to the area&#x27;s visual appearance and touristic appeal and in 2014, the refinery was closed down.

==Geography==
Gela is situated on the Mediterranean coast at the estuary of Gela river on the south-western side of Sicily. The bounding municipalities are Acate, Butera, Caltagirone, Mazzarino and Niscemi. Its &quot;frazione&quot; (municipal parish) is the coastal village of Manfria. In geology, Gela gives its name to the Gelasian Age of the Pleistocene Epoch.

===Climate===
Gela has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;). Winters are mild and rainy while summers are dry and hot. Precipitation is higher in autumn and winter.

==Main sights==

* Greek Acropolis.
* The Regional Archeological Museum.
* The archeological site of Capo Soprano with the Timolean walls (city walls) named after Timoleon (4th century BC), located within a large park between the modern city and the coast. It was probably an ancient necropolis. Its many fine Attic vases are now in various museums.
*&quot;Zona sacra&quot;, including the basements of three Greek temples, the oldest of which has an Doric column. Remains of an archaic (7th–6th centuries BC) emporium have also been excavated.
* The Cathedral, dedicated to the Holy Virgin Assunta, was rebuilt in 1766-1794 over a pre-existing small church of Madonna della Platea. It has two orders façade with Doric and Ionic semi-columns. The interior, with a nave and two aisles, houses a wood with the &quot;Transit of the Virgin&quot; by Deodato Guidaccia and other 18th centuries canvasses.
* San Francesco d&#x27;Assisi church: refurbished in the 17th century with a painted wooden roof and housing an altarpiece depicting the &quot;Deposition&quot; by Vito D&#x27;Anna

*Natural Reserve of Biviere di Gela, including a coastal lake surrounded by dunes.
* Manfria, with a typical beach with Mediterranean dune landscape, and the &quot;Torre di Manfria&quot; (&quot;Manfria Tower&quot;).

==Archaeology==


There are three main archaeological areas that can be visited today: Capo Soprano, the Acropolis and the site of Bosco Littorio.

At Capo Soprano is the best preserved example in the world of Greek military architecture: the (Timolean) city walls. The length unearthed (almost 400 m) dates to the 4th century BC. The feature that makes them unique is the large squared blocks in Calcarenite 3 m high in the lower part and a thick layer of raw or sun-dried clay bricks above which were perfectly preserved. The upper layer was probably added as a quick solution after news of the imminent invasion of the Carthaginians. At some points the walls externally reached a height of almost 10 m. They are considered to be one of the most important discoveries of classical archeology of the twentieth century as they are testimony of the importance that the ancient Greeks gave to defensive design and engineering as they were designed by an architect down to the smallest detail, with devices and structures intended for specific purposes such as protection from weather and towers, stairs, walkways, drains, buttresses. Inside the walls the military district was brought to light with buildings of clay bricks. Not far away, a large residential area of the same era was discovered.

The Acropolis extends between the mouth of the Gela and the Pasqualello valley and contains the ruins of houses, shops, temples and the Hippodamian road system (with the &quot;plateia&quot; and the &quot;stenopoi&quot;). The sacred area extended to the north: today only the bases of three temples are visible. Of the largest, temple C or Athenaion, a Doric-style column (almost 8 m high) remains standing and is one of the city&#x27;s symbols. Until 405 BC the acropolis housed the most important sacred buildings of Gela but after the destruction by the Carthaginians, houses were built over the acropolis after the rise to power of Timoleon.

In the Bosco Littorio, south of the Acropolis, the extensive emporium (7th–6th century BC) complex near the port at mouth of the river has been recently brought to light and restored. The emporium included workshops, warehouses and shops.

A grandiose Hellenistic villa has been found in via Romagnoli (predio Iacona).

The Greek baths of Gela in via Europa are unique in Sicily and consist of two rooms; the one located to the north west consists of two groups of bathtubs connected by a wastewater system that surrounds a central space. The bathtubs that make up the first of the two groups are arranged in a horseshoe and have a particular shape. While only two seats of this first group have been lost, those of the second group are all missing the upper half (perhaps never completed). The material used for the tubs was an agglomeration of terracotta fragments and sandstone debris while some seats are entirely in terracotta.

Among recent discoveries in the area are:

* the oldest Greek wreck (500 BC), unique of its kind, which will be exhibited in the Museum of Navigation
* in 2009 a fourth ancient boat near the mouth of the Dirillo, an underwater archaeological site on the coast of the Bulala district. The 3 other boats are in the Museum of Ancient Navigation.
* foundations of two other Greek temples: the first, very large, next to the crypts of the Mother Church; the second near the new multi-storey car park in via Istria.
* a monumental villa from the Hellenistic period on the Capo Soprano promontory with a view of the gulf

In 2019, a sarcophagus containing an intact skeleton was discovered at Gela. Some weeks later, a short distance away, a ceramic water jug containing the bones of a newborn baby and parts of a large animal&#x27;s skeleton was discovered. Archaeologists said the place was certainly a Greek necropolis.

==Twin towns==

Gela is twinned with:
* Eleusina, Greece
* Wittingen, Germany
* Nordkapp, Norway

== Sports ==

=== Football ===
Gela has got a football team; S.S.D. Città di Gela. Their football stadium is Stadio Vincenzo Presti. This team was founded in 1975 and re-founded in 2006, 2011 and 2019. Their best performance in Italian football was 12th position in the group B of the 2010–11 Lega Pro Prima Divisione.

<text>Radiology (X-rays) is used in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Abnormalities on chest radiographs may be suggestive of, but are never diagnostic of TB, but can be used to rule out pulmonary TB.

==Chest X-ray==

A posterior-anterior (PA) chest X-ray is the standard view used; other views (lateral or lordotic) or CT scans may be necessary.

In active pulmonary TB, infiltrates or consolidations and/or cavities are often seen in the upper lungs with or without mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. However, lesions may appear anywhere in the lungs. In HIV and other immunosuppressed persons, any abnormality may indicate TB or the chest X-ray may even appear entirely normal.

Old healed tuberculosis usually presents as pulmonary nodules in the hilar area or upper lobes, with or without fibrotic scars and volume loss. Bronchiectasis and pleural scarring may be present.

Nodules and fibrotic scars may contain slowly multiplying tubercle bacilli with the potential for future progression to active tuberculosis. Persons with these findings, if they have a positive tuberculin skin test reaction, should be considered high-priority candidates for treatment of latent infection regardless of age. Conversely, calcified nodular lesions (calcified granuloma) pose a very low risk for future progression to active tuberculosis.

Abnormalities on chest radiographs may be suggestive of, but are never diagnostic of, TB. However, if a person has a positive response to the tuberculin skin test and no symptoms of the disease, chest radiographs can be used to rule out the possibility of pulmonary TB.

===CDC guidelines for evaluating CXR===
The chest X-ray and classification worksheet by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States is designed to group findings into categories based on their likelihood of being related to TB or non-TB conditions needing medical follow-up.

===Normal findings===

These are films that are completely normal, with no identifiable cardiothoracic or musculoskeletal abnormality.

===Abnormal findings===
====Chest X-ray findings that can suggest active TB====
This category comprises all findings typically associated with active pulmonary TB. In the US, refugees or immigration applicants with any of the following findings must submit sputum specimens for examination.

1. Infiltrate or consolidation - Opacification of airspaces within the lung parenchyma. Consolidation or infiltrate can be dense or patchy and might have irregular, ill-defined, or hazy borders.

2. Any cavitary lesion - Lucency (darkened area) within the lung parenchyma, with or without irregular margins that might be surrounded by an area of airspace consolidation or infiltrates, or by nodular or fibrotic (reticular) densities, or both. The walls surrounding the lucent area can be thick or thin. Calcification can exist around a cavity.

3. Nodule with poorly defined margins - Round density within the lung parenchyma, also called a tuberculoma. Nodules included in this category are those with margins that are indistinct or poorly defined (tree-in-bud sign). The surrounding haziness can be either subtle or readily apparent and suggests coexisting airspace consolidation.

&lt;br&gt;4. Pleural effusion - Presence of a significant amount of fluid within the pleural space. This finding must be distinguished from blunting of the costophrenic angle, which may or may not represent a small amount of fluid within the pleural space (except in children when even minor blunting must be considered a finding that can suggest active TB).

5. Hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy (bihilar lymphadenopathy) - Enlargement of lymph nodes in one or both hila or within the mediastinum, with or without associated atelectasis or consolidation.

6. Linear, interstitial disease (in children only) - Prominence of linear, interstitial (septal) markings.

7. Other - Any other finding suggestive of active TB, such as miliary TB. Miliary findings are nodules of millet size (1 to 2 millimeters) distributed throughout the parenchyma.
====Chest X-ray findings that can suggest inactive TB====
This category includes findings that are suggestive of prior TB, that is inactive. Assessments of the activity of TB cannot be made accurately on the basis of a single radiograph alone. If there is any question of active TB, sputum smears must be obtained. Therefore, any applicant might have findings grouped in this category, but still have active TB as suggested by the presence of signs or symptoms of TB, or sputum smears positive for AFB.

The main chest X-ray findings that can suggest inactive TB are:

1. Discrete fibrotic scar or linear opacity—Discrete linear or reticular densities within the lung. The edges of these densities should be distinct and there should be no suggestion of airspace opacification or haziness between or surrounding these densities. Calcification can be present within the lesion and then the lesion is called a &quot;fibrocalcific&quot; scar.

2. Discrete nodule(s) without calcification—One or more nodular densities with distinct borders and without any surrounding airspace opacification. Nodules are generally round or have rounded edges. These features allow them to be distinguished from infiltrates or airspace opacities. To be included here, these nodules must be noncalcified. Nodules that are calcified are included in the category &quot;OTHER X-ray findings, No follow-up needed&quot;.

3. Discrete fibrotic scar with volume loss or retraction—Discrete linear densities with reduction in the space occupied by the upper lobe. Associated signs include upward deviation of the fissure or hilum on the corresponding side with asymmetry of the volumes of the two thoracic cavities.

4. Discrete nodule(s) with volume loss or retraction—One or more nodular densities with distinct borders and no surrounding airspace opacification with reduction in the space occupied by the upper lobe. Nodules are generally round or have rounded edges.

5. Other—Any other finding suggestive of prior TB, such as upper lobe bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis is bronchial dilation with bronchial wall thickening.
===Other chest X-ray findings===
====Follow-up needed====
This category includes findings that suggest the need for a follow-up evaluation for non-TB conditions.

# Musculoskeletal abnormalities - New bony fractures or radiographically apparent bony abnormalities that need follow-up.
# Cardiac abnormalities - Cardiac enlargement or anomalies, vascular abnormalities, or any other radiographically apparent cardiovascular abnormality of significant nature to require follow-up.
# Pulmonary abnormalities - Pulmonary finding of a non-TB nature, such as a mass, that needs follow-up.
# Other - Any other finding that the panel physician believes needs follow-up, but is not one of the above.

====No follow-up needed====
This category includes findings that are minor and not suggestive of TB disease. These findings require no follow-up evaluation.

# Pleural thickening - Irregularity or abnormal prominence of the pleural margin, including apical capping (thickening of the pleura in the apical region). Pleural thickening can be calcified.
# Diaphragmatic tenting - A localized accentuation of the normal convexity of the hemidiaphragm as if &quot;pulled upwards by a string.&quot;
# Blunting of costophrenic angle (in adults)—Loss of sharpness of one or both costophrenic angles. Blunting can be related to a small amount of fluid in the pleural space or to pleural thickening and, by itself, is a non-specific finding (except in children, when even minor blunting may suggest active TB). In contrast a large pleural effusion, or the presence of a significant amount of fluid in the pleural space, may be a sign of active TB at any age.
# Solitary calcified nodules or granuloma - Discrete calcified nodule or granuloma, or calcified lymph node. The calcified nodule can be within the lung, hila, or mediastinum. The borders must be sharp, distinct, and well defined. This was considered a Class B3 TB in the past; however, Class B3 has been omitted from the classification scheme because it has not been found to be associated with active TB.
# Minor musculoskeletal findings - Minor findings needing no follow-up.
# Minor cardiac findings - Minor findings needing no follow-up.

==Extrapulmonary tuberculosis==
Peritoneal tuberculosis may mimic peritoneal carcinomatosis on CT scan.

There is low-quality evidence that abdominal ultrasound has 63% sensitivity and 68% specificity in diagnosing abdominal tuberculosis when tuberculosis is bacteriologically confirmed in HIV-positive individuals. Therefore, a negative abdominal ultrasound finding does not rule out the disease due to its low sensitivity.

<doc id="1033581" wikidata="Q60846" url="?curid=1033581" title="Gertrud Scholtz-Klink">
<text>Gertrud Emma Scholtz-Klink, &quot;born&quot; Treusch, later known under the alias Maria Stuckebrock (9 February 1902 – 24 March 1999), was a member of the Nazi Party best known as the leader of the National Socialist Women&#x27;s League. She headed numerous other Party and government organizations for women and was the most prominent female official in Nazi Germany. Following the end of the Second World War, she underwent denazification proceedings and was adjudged a &quot;major offender&quot;. A non-repentant Nazi, she lived another half-century and published a book in which she professed her continued belief in Nazi ideology.

== Early life, marriages and family ==
Gertrud Emma Treusch was born into a middle class family in Adelsheim where her father was the local district surveyor. When she was 2, the family moved to Eberbach where she later attended the local &quot;Volksschule&quot;. Her father died when she was 8, and from then on she and her two brothers were raised by her mother. They moved to nearby Mosbach where she attended the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; until age 16 and worked briefly as a nurse during the last stages of the First World War in 1918.

In April 1921, at age 19, Treusch married Eugen Klink, a former army officer and war veteran who worked as a secondary school teacher. He became a member of the Nazi Party and its paramilitary organization, the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA). He also served a local Party speaker and as the acting &quot;Kreisleiter&quot; for the Offenburg district. The couple would have five children, one of whom died in infancy. In March 1930, Klink died of a heart attack at a Party rally. The widowed &quot;Frau&quot; Klink moved to Ellmindingen and, two years later, married a country physician by the name of Günther Scholtz, changing her surname to Scholtz-Klink. This marriage produced no children and ended in divorce in 1937. In December 1940, she married for a third time, to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; August Heissmeyer, a high-ranking member of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) and a widower with six children. This marriage produced one son, Hartmut, born in June 1944. The size of their combined family was the subject of much attention and praise by the Nazi press.

== Rise in the Nazi Party ==
Scholtz-Klink joined the Nazi Party in March 1930 and her membership was backdated to 1 September 1929 (membership number 157,007). As an early Party member, she later would be awarded the Golden Party Badge. In October 1930, with the support of her patron, &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Robert Heinrich Wagner, she was appointed leader of the Party&#x27;s women&#x27;s organization in Baden. By 1931, she also attained the leadership of the women&#x27;s organization in Hesse. A gifted orator, she traveled throughout southwestern Germany recruiting women to the Party. In 1933, Wagner brought her into the Baden interior ministry as a consultant on women&#x27;s issues and made her a leader of its labor service.

About a year after the Nazi seizure of power, Scholtz-Klink moved to Berlin on 1 January 1934 when Konstantin Hierl, head of the Reich Labor Service, appointed her as the leader of the German Women&#x27;s Labor Service (&quot;Deutscher Frauenarbeitsdienst&quot;), a post she would retain until April 1936. Additional appointments followed in rapid succession. She was made the &quot;Reichsführerin&quot; of the Party&#x27;s National Socialist Women&#x27;s League (NSF) and the larger mass organization &quot;Deutsches Frauenwerk&quot; (German Women&#x27;s Association) on 24 February 1934. She also was made leader of the Women&#x27;s League of the German Red Cross in June and of the Women&#x27;s Bureau of the German Labor Front in July. Additionally, she had the honor title of &quot;Reichsfrauenführerin&quot; (Reich Women&#x27;s Leader) bestowed upon her by Adolf Hitler in November. She was made a member of the Academy for German Law in 1937.

== Activities as &quot;Reichsfrauenführerin&quot; ==

Scholtz-Klink became the public image of the model Aryan woman: blonde-haired, blue-eyed, slim, with braids pinned in a crown around her head and no makeup. She was usually attired in her NSF uniform, with a necktie and a starched blouse buttoned to the throat. At unofficial functions, she generally wore the traditional German dirndl. For the duration of the Nazi regime, she became the chief exemplar of the German woman and was known by many nicknames, including &quot;First Lady of the Reich&quot;, &quot;Reich Mother-in-Chief&quot; and the derogatory &quot;Reich Thundering Goat&quot;.

One of the first targets of the &quot;Reichsfrauenführerin&quot; was the large feminist movement, which had been active in the Weimar Republic. It was rapidly repressed, with its constituent organizations either banned outright or incorporated into the NSF. Leading feminists either left Germany or remained but retreated into a self-imposed silence.

Scholtz-Klink&#x27;s main task was to promote male superiority, the joys of home, and the importance of child-bearing. Her philosophy of women&#x27;s role in society hearkened back to the earlier German slogan of &quot;Kinder, Küche, Kirche&quot;. In one speech, she declared that &quot;the mission of woman is to minister in the home and in her profession to the needs of life from the first to last moment of man&#x27;s existence&quot;. Her views even extended to condoning sexual violence against women. She once confided to a female colleague when discussing male domineering and bullying: &quot;What woman could possibly object or not want to be forcibly taken by her man. If she is honest then every woman enjoys that&quot;. She viewed women&#x27;s role in Nazi Germany as sacrosanct but subservient. It was the woman&#x27;s duty to care for her body to ensure its maximum fertility, to produce as many children as possible for the state and to make a good home for her husband and children. In order to encourage an increase in the birth rate, incentives were established for larger families, and Mother&#x27;s Day was celebrated as an official holiday from 1934. Beginning in 1939, women who bore four or more children were awarded the Cross of Honour of the German Mother, a state decoration, which was presented in three classes according to the number of children: bronze (4–5), silver (6–7) or gold (8 or more). Scholtz-Klink herself was awarded the golden cross in May 1944.

Despite her own position, Scholtz-Klink spoke against the participation of women in politics and held up the female politicians of the Weimar Republic as a bad example: &quot;Those who have once heard the screaming of Communist and Social Democratic women in the streets, in parliament … know that a truly German woman will not lend herself to that&quot;. She claimed that for a woman to be involved in politics would blur the line between the sexes: she would have to act like a man to achieve something – which would damage her public image – or behave like a woman, which would prevent her from achieving anything. She concluded that, either way, nothing was gained from women seeking a role as politicians.
For women completing secondary school, Scholtz-Klink introduced the concept of a &quot;household year&quot; as a prerequisite to university study, which with the assistance of skillful propaganda and anti-academic slogans, was meant to convince them to abandon further academic pursuits. Scholarship was labeled a strictly masculine pursuit. Instead, under the auspices of the Mothers&#x27; Service (&quot;Mütterdienst&quot;), Scholtz-Klink developed courses on childcare, cooking and sewing that were delivered to stay-at-home mothers in Home-Mother Schools. These courses were very popular and were attended by more than 1.7 million women by March 1939.

Beginning in 1936, &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler mandated that women engaged to SS members undergo training in how to become wives who would conform to the Nazi ideal. Scholtz-Klink oversaw these so-called Reich Bride Schools that offered a combination of instruction in Nazi ideology (including race and genetics) and domestic chores such as shopping, cooking, sewing, gardening and caring for their husbands&#x27; uniforms, boots and daggers. Young brides-to-be would spend six weeks living together in groups of twenty in a villa at Schwanenwerder in Berlin. By 1940, there were nine such schools in Berlin alone, and additional ones throughout the country that remained active into May 1944.

In an account of the Nuremberg Party Rally of September 1935, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported on a speech by Hitler to the women Party cadres assembled by the &quot;Reichsfrauenführerin&quot; and their reactions to it:

Fifty thousand German women and girls marshaled by hard-bosomed Gertrude Scholtzklink [sic], No. 1 female Nazi, hailed Herr Hitler with bursts of wild, ecstatic cheering which kept up for the whole 45 minutes that he addressed them in his happiest mood. &quot;There are some things only a man can do!&quot; cried this Apotheosis of the Little Man. &quot;I exalt women as the stablest element in our Reich because woman judges with her heart, not with her head! … I would not be here now had not women supported me from the very beginning … We deny the Liberal-Jew-Bolshevik theory of &#x27;women&#x27;s equality&#x27; because it dishonors them! … A woman, if she understands her mission rightly, will say to a man: &#x27;You preserve our people from danger and I shall give you children&#x27;.&quot; (Cries of &#x27;Ja! Ja! Heil Hitler!&#x27;) Many of the 50,000 women wept as they cheered, and Herr Hitler himself seemed on the point of tears …

As head of the Woman&#x27;s Bureau of the German Labor Front, Scholtz-Klink had the responsibility of persuading women to work for the benefit of the Nazi government, and later, for the war effort. At the 1937 Nuremberg Party Rally, she stated that &quot;even if our weapon is only the wooden spoon, its striking power will be no less than that of other weapons&quot;. At the 1938 rally, she argued that &quot;the German woman must work and work, physically and mentally she must renounce luxury and pleasure&quot;.

For propaganda reasons, Nazi Germany showcased Scholtz-Klink to foreign countries as an influential leader in the Party, and she made many speaking trips abroad. However, she was usually left out of the more important meetings in the male-dominated leadership of the Party and the state, and was not consulted on issues beyond her narrow sphere of interest. She was considered to be a figurehead, and her views were reportedly not considered important by the Nazi leadership. Whenever there were conflicts over jurisdictional issues, she lost the argument, demonstrating what little actual political power she wielded.

Scholtz-Klink fully supported the Nazi racial policies against Jews. She cautioned women against the &quot;raceless talk of humanity&quot; and supported &quot;racial purity&quot; as part of the &quot;natural order&quot;. She declared Jews to be the &quot;mortal enemy of the German nation&quot; and urged women to avoid Jewish businesses: &quot;Not a penny more to a Jewish store, no Jewish doctor, no Jewish lawyer for the German woman or the German family!&quot;

Scholtz-Klink was also aware of the crimes of the Nazi regime. Her NSF was responsible for monitoring the forced domestic laborers used in private households in the Reich, and for a time she was involved in the selection and training of Nazi concentration camps guards. During the Second World War, she often accompanied her husband in his capacity as an inspector on frequent trips to concentration camps. Toward the end of the war, she was present with her husband when he commanded a &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; (battle group) in Potsdam during the Battle of Berlin. Though she did not actively fight in the battle, she was seen wearing a camouflage uniform and carrying a sub-machine gun.

== Post-war life and prosecutions ==
A false news dispatch in mid-April 1945 reported that Scholtz-Klink killed herself in Konstanz. In actuality, she fled with Heissmeyer from Berlin before its capitulation. They destroyed their identity papers and uniforms, and after Germany&#x27;s surrender, they were briefly interned in a Soviet prisoner of war camp near Magdeburg in the summer of 1945. They managed to convince their captors that they were refugees from the east and were released in September. With the assistance of Princess Pauline of Württemberg, whom Scholtz-Klink knew from her work with the German Red Cross, they went into hiding in Bebenhausen near Tübingen where they worked as domestic servants. They spent the subsequent three years under the aliases of Heinrich and Maria Stuckenbrock (his mother&#x27;s maiden name). They even underwent a denazification process and were classified as Category V (&quot;exonerated&quot;).

On 28 February 1948, the couple were identified and arrested by French occupation authorities. Put on trial for possession of false identity papers, they were convicted in April 1948 and sentenced to 18 months in prison in Rottenburg am Neckar before being released in August 1949. Returning to Tübingen, Scholtz-Klink again underwent denazification proceedings and this time was classified as a Category I (&quot;major offender&quot;) on 17 November 1949. Sentenced to nineteen months, she was immediately released on the basis of time served. After a public outcry protesting the lenient sentence, an appeals court on 5 May 1950 sentenced her to 30 months in a labor camp. In addition, the court imposed a fine and banned her from engaging in political activities for life. She was deprived of her right to vote and to join political parties or unions, and prohibited from practicing the professions of journalism or teaching for ten years. After a successful appeal for clemency, she was able to avoid imprisonment, but the loss of civil rights remained in effect.

Scholtz-Klink settled back in Bebenhausen. In her 1978 book &quot;Die Frau im Dritten Reich&quot; (&quot;The Woman in the Third Reich&quot;), which she dedicated to &quot;the victims of the Nuremberg trials&quot;, Scholtz-Klink professed her continuing support for Nazi ideology. She expressed no remorse or regret, instead praising Nazi Germany and glorifying Hitler. She once again upheld her position on Nazism in her interview with historian Claudia Koonz in 1981. Koonz stated that Scholtz-Klink put forward &quot;pious excuses&quot; and &quot;rationalizations&quot;, and the author concluded that &quot;this was not an ex-Nazi. She remained as much a Nazi now as she had been in 1945 or in 1933&quot;. Scholtz-Klink died on 24 March 1999 at age 97.

<text>Raffles Girls&#x27; School (RGS) is an independent girls&#x27; secondary school located in Braddell, Singapore. Established in 1879, it is one of the oldest schools in Singapore. RGS, together with its affiliated school Raffles Institution, offers a six-year Raffles Programme, which allows students to skip the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examinations and proceed to take the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations at the end of Year 6.

The school was recognised by the Ministry of Education in 2006 by being awarded the School Excellence Award (recognising schools with &#x27;exemplary school processes and practices&#x27;), among other awards.

It was a member of Alliance of Girls&#x27; Schools Australasia.

==History==

Before RGS became a school in its own right, it existed as a section of Raffles Institution (RI).

The precursor to RGS opened in the RI campus of Bras Basah Road on 4 March 1844 with 11 students, five day-scholars and six boarders, who were clothed, fed and instructed by the RI management. The demand for education grew and in 1847, the school moved to RI&#x27;s eastern wing, extending towards Bras Basah Road. Edmund Augustus Blundell, the Governor of the Straits Settlement, described the school as &quot;a female school designed for the education and religious training of the children of poor Protestant parents&quot; in 1855. In 1871, the school moved into a house, the George Family&#x27;s Old Mansion at the corner of Bras Basah Road. In 1879, the school separated from RI and M. Nelson was appointed the school&#x27;s first headmistress. Together with three assistants, she ran the school which had an enrolment of 77. Since then, 1879 has been officially regarded as the year of the founding of RGS.

On 21 October 2019, RGS moved from Anderson Road, where it had been located since 1959, to its new campus at Braddell Rise, located opposite RI.

==School culture and identity==
===Uniform===
The usual school uniform is a belted, deep blue pinafore and a white collared blouse.

== Awards and accolades ==
A group of four students from RGS emerged Champion at the Kids&#x27; Lit Quiz 2018, and represented Singapore in New Zealand in July that year.

Joseph Toh Kim Leng won the Teaching Award in 2016, which honours outstanding teachers of English language, English literature and General Paper in Singapore.

Jodie Lai, a 2015 Optimist World Championships Under-15 champion, was conferred the title of Best Sportsgirl for sailing at the 46th Singapore Schools Sports Council (SSSC) Colours Awards in 2016.

Students from the school have won the Queen&#x27;s Commonwealth Essay Competition.

<text>Peter Turner (1586–1652) was an English mathematician.

==Life==
He matriculated at St Mary Hall, Oxford in 1600, and graduated M.A. at Christ Church, Oxford in 1605. He became a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford in 1607.

He gave public lectures as professor of geometry at Gresham College, London from 1620 to 1630. He was an ally of William Laud in his time as Chancellor of the University of Oxford, working with Brian Twyne on a revision of the statutes.

He held the Savilian Chair of Geometry at the University of Oxford from 1631 to 1649. In 1641 he enlisted in the royalist forces of John Byron, 1st Baron Byron. Taken prisoner in an early skirmish of the First English Civil War, near Stow-on-the-Wold, he was eventually released in 1643 in a prisoner exchange. He was ejected from his chair after the 1648 Parliamentary visitation of Oxford, and lived in poverty with his sister in Southwark.

<doc id="1033603" wikidata="Q2712809" url="?curid=1033603" title="Śrāvaka">
<text>Śrāvaka (Sanskrit) or Sāvaka (Pali) means &quot;hearer&quot; or, more generally, &quot;disciple&quot;. This term is used in Buddhism and Jainism. In Jainism, a śrāvaka is any lay Jain so the term śrāvaka has been used for the Jain community itself (for example see Sarak and Sarawagi). Śrāvakācāras are the lay conduct outlined within the treaties by Śvetāmbara or Digambara mendicants. &quot;In parallel to the prescriptive texts, Jain religious teachers have written a number of stories to illustrate vows in practice and produced a rich répertoire of characters.&quot;.

In Buddhism, the term is sometimes reserved for distinguished disciples of the Buddha.

== Buddhism ==

===Early Buddhism===

In early Buddhism, a śrāvaka or śrāvikā is a disciple who accepts:
* the Buddha as their teacher
* the Buddha&#x27;s teaching (the Dharma), including understanding the Four Noble Truths, ridding oneself of the unreality of the phenomenal, and pursuing nirvana. See, for instance, the &quot;Anguttara Nikaya&quot;″s second &quot;Metta Sutta&quot; (AN 4.126) when, taken in consideration of the first &quot;Metta Sutta&quot; (AN 4.125), a disciple is described as one who &quot;regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form, feeling, perception, fabrications, &amp; consciousness, as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a disintegration, an emptiness, not-self.&quot;
* the community rules of conduct: the Five Precepts for laypersons, the prātimokṣa for monastics.
In the &quot;Nikāya&quot;, depending on the context, a sāvaka can also refer to a disciple of a teacher other than the Buddha.

=== Theravada Buddhism ===

In Theravada Buddhism, a śrāvaka or śrāvikāt refers to one who followed in the tradition of the senior monks of the first Buddhist sangha and community. In the Pāli Canon, the term &quot;disciple&quot; transcends monastic-lay divisions and can refer to anyone from the following &quot;four assemblies&quot;:
* bhikkhus (&quot;monks&quot;)
* s (&quot;nuns&quot;)
* upāsakas and upāsikā (laypersons of both sexes)

Buddhist texts further mention four types of disciples based on spiritual accomplishment:
* &quot;Chief Disciple&quot; (Pāli: &quot;aggasāvaka&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;agraśrāvaka&quot;): in the Pali canon, these are Sāriputta and (Mahā)moggallāna
* &quot;Foremost Disciple&quot; (Pāli: &quot;etadaggasāvaka&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;etadagraśrāvaka&quot;): referring to those disciples who are recognized as the best in their respective attribute
* &quot;Great Disciple&quot; (Pāli: &quot;mahāsāvaka&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;mahāśrāvaka&quot;): examples are Mahākassapa, Ānanda, Anuruddha and Mahākaccāna.
* &quot;Ordinary Disciple&quot; (Pāli: &quot;pakatisāvaka&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;&quot;): constituting the majority of disciples, while devoted to the Buddha and his teaching and while having planted seeds for future liberation, they have not yet irreversibly entered the path to emancipation and are still subject to infinite rebirths.

====Ariyasāvaka====
In the Pali commentaries, the term &quot;ariyasāvaka&quot; is explained as &quot;the disciple of the Noble One (i.e. Buddha)&quot;. Accordingly, Soma Thera and Thanissaro Bhikkhu translate this term as &quot;The disciple of the Noble Ones&quot;

However Bhikkhu Bodhi interprets this term as &quot;noble disciple&quot;, and according to him, in the Pali suttas, this term is used in two ways:
# broadly: any lay disciple of the Buddha;
# narrowly: one who is at least on the path to enlightenment (Pāli: &quot;sotāpatti maggattha&quot;). In this sense, &quot;ordinary people&quot; (&quot;puthujjana&quot;) can be contrasted with this narrow definition of &quot;noble disciple&quot; (&quot;ariyasāvaka&quot;). Nyanatiloka writes, &quot;sāvaka [...] refers, in a restricted sense (then mostly ariya-sāvaka, &#x27;noble disciple&#x27;), only to the eight kinds of noble disciples (ariya-puggala, q.v.).&quot;

The canon occasionally references the &quot;four pairs&quot; and &quot;eight types&quot; of disciples. This refers to disciples who have achieved one of the four stages of enlightenment:
* Sotāpanna
* Sakadāgāmin
* Anāgāmin
* Arahat

In regards to disciples achieving arahantship, Bhikkhu Bodhi writes:

For each of these stages, there is a &quot;pair&quot; of possible disciples: one who is on the stage&#x27;s path (Pāli: &quot;magga&quot;); the other who has achieved its fruit (Pāli: &quot;phala&quot;). Thus, each stage represents a &quot;pair&quot; of individuals: the path traveler (Pāli: &quot;maggattha&quot;) and the fruit achiever (Pāli: &quot;phalattha&quot;). Hence, the community of disciples is said to be composed of four pairs or eight types of individuals (Pāli: &quot;cattāri purisayugāni attha purisapuggalā&quot;).

====Foremost disciples====
In the &quot;Etadaggavagga&quot; (&quot;These are the Foremost Chapter,&quot; AN 1.188-267), the Buddha identifies 80 different categories for his &quot;foremost&quot; (Pāli: &quot;etadagga&quot;) disciples: 47 categories for monks, 13 for nuns, ten for laymen and ten for laywomen.

While the disciples identified with these categories are declared to be the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;foremost&quot; or &quot;chief&quot; (Pāli: &quot;etadagga&quot;), this is different from his &quot;Chief Disciples&quot; (Pāli: &quot;aggasāvaka&quot;) who are consistently identified solely as Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna.

In addition, in SN 17.23, SN 17.24 and AN 4.18.6, the Buddha identifies four pairs of disciples &quot;who have no compare&quot; and who should thus be emulated. These four pairs are a subset of the 80 foremost disciples listed above, identified in the sub-section 14 of AN 1 (i.e. AN 1.188-267). These four pairs of disciples to be most emulated are:

* monks: Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna
* nuns: Khemā and Uppalavaṇṇā
* laymen: Citta and Hatthaka of Alavi
* laywomen: Kujjuttara and Veḷukaṇḍakiyā

=== The community of disciples ===
In Buddhism, there are two main communities (Pāli: &quot;sangha&quot;):
* The &quot;community of monks and nuns&quot; (Pāli: &quot;bhikkhu-sangha&quot;; &quot;bhikkhuni-sangha&quot;) refers to a community of four or more monks or nuns who are living in a permanent or semi-permanent single-sex community (in the contemporary West monks and nuns may live within the same monastery but in separate living quarters). Within this community of monks and nuns there is a further sub-division containing practitioners (who are nonetheless still living among their fellow renunciates) possessed of some substantive level of realization (namely, those who have at least gained stream-entry). This core group is called the &quot;noble sangha&quot; (&quot;ariya-sangha&quot;).
* The &quot;community of disciples&quot; (Pāli: &quot;sāvaka-sangha&quot;) refers to the broad community of monks, nuns, and male and female layfollowers.

For an example of a traditional stock reference to the &quot;sāvaka-sangha&quot; in the Pali canon, in &quot;The Crest of the Standard&quot; discourse (SN 11.3), the Buddha advises his monks that, if they experience fear, they can recollect the Buddha or the Dhamma or the Sangha; and, in recollecting the Sangha they should recall:
: &quot;The Sangha of the Blessed One&#x27;s disciples [&quot;sāvaka-sangha&quot;] is practising the good way, practising the straight way, practising the true way, practising the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals...&quot;

A similar phrase can also be found in the lay disciple&#x27;s daily chant, &quot;Sangha Vandanā&quot; (&quot;Salutation to the Sangha&quot;).

=== Mahāyāna view ===
In Mahayana Buddhism, śrāvakas or arhats are sometimes contrasted negatively with bodhisattvas. 

In the 4th century abhidharma work &quot;Abhidharmasamuccaya&quot;, Asaṅga describes those who follow the Śrāvakayāna. These people are described as having weak faculties, following the Śrāvaka Dharma, utilizing the Śrāvaka Piṭaka, being set on their own liberation, and cultivating detachment in order to attain liberation. Those in the Pratyekabuddhayāna are portrayed as also utilizing the Śrāvaka Piṭaka, are said to have medium faculties, to follow the Pratyekabuddha Dharma, and to be set on their own personal enlightenment. Finally, those in the Mahāyāna &quot;Great Vehicle&quot; are portrayed as utilizing the Bodhisattva Piṭaka, as having sharp faculties, following the Bodhisattva Dharma, and set on the perfection and liberation of all beings, and the attainment of complete enlightenment.

According to Vasubandhu&#x27;s Yogacara teachings, there are four types of śrāvakas:
# The fixed
# The arrogant
# The transformed
# The converted (to &quot;Bodhi&quot; or Buddhism)

The transformed and the converted (Buddhist) are assured of eventual Nirvana in the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;.

According to Je Tsongkhapa, founder of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism:
== Jainism ==

A śrāvaka in Jainism is a lay Jain. He is the hearer of discourses of monastics and scholars, Jain literature. In Jainism, the Jain community is made up of four sections: monks, nuns, śrāvakas (laymen) and śrāvikās (laywomen).

The term śrāvaka has also been used as a shorthand for the community itself. For example, the Sarawagi are a Jain community originating in Rajasthan, and sometimes śrāvaka is the origin of surnames for Jain families. The long-isolated Jain community in East India is known as the Sarak.

The conduct of a śrāvaka is governed by texts called &quot;śrāvakācāra&quot;s, the best known of which is the &quot;Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra&quot; of Samantabhadra.

A śrāvaka rises spiritually through the eleven pratimas. After the eleventh step, he becomes a monk.

Jains follow six obligatory duties known as avashyakas: &quot;samayika&quot; (practising serenity), chaturvimshati (praising the tirthankara), vandan (respecting teachers and monks), &quot;pratikramana&quot; (introspection), &quot;kayotsarga&quot; (stillness), and pratyakhyana (renunciation).

<text>Hans-Peter Briegel (born 11 October 1955) is a German former professional football player and manager who played as a defender or midfielder.

One of the most popular German players in his days, Briegel&#x27;s original sport was athletics, being successful in various events such as long jump (personal best: 7 metres 44 cm, aged 16), triple jump and specifically in heptathlon-forerunner pentathlon. Briegel also ran 100 metres in 10.8 seconds (officially; hand-timed), aged 16. 
At the age of 17, he left athletics behind him, playing club football with hometown side SV Rodenbach near Kaiserslautern. During his playing days, Briegel usually played as a left back and defensive midfielder. He was known primarily for his physical abilities as well as his technical abilities and goal scoring abilities for a defensive player.

== Club career ==

Two years after that he was picked up by Erich Ribbeck and Ribbeck took him to training with 1. FC Kaiserslautern, being impressed by the power and stamina the youngster had to offer. Ribbeck was aware that Briegel struggled to combine football need with his physical power and presence, but as practice makes perfect, Briegel was improving. Failing to cope the needs as striker, he did a lot better as defender. On 10 April 1976, Ribbeck brought him on as a sub in a 4–3 win over FC Bayern Munich. Until 1984 he stayed with local side 1. FC Kaiserslautern before he moved on to Hellas Verona in Italy. It should be seen as one of the best efforts of his career that he also gained his sort of reputation and importance in a league such as the Italian Serie A, largely seen as one of the most technical in Europe. Briegel was an immediate key to success for his new club, surprisingly capturing the Serie A title in 1985 with the Gialloblu. The same year, Briegel was named &quot;Fußballer des Jahres&quot; &quot;(Footballer of the Year)&quot; in Germany, remarkable as he was the debut foreign-based awardee in the history of the award.

Subsequent to the end of his contract at Hellas Verona, Briegel changed clubs to join fellow Italian top division outfit U.C. Sampdoria of Genoa with whom he won the Coppa Italia before his retirement as a player in 1988. Hans-Peter Briegel&#x27;s success in football, based on his physical constitution, his speed and his tireless running, made him the clearest symbol for the soldier-like reputation of German football in between the years. His nickname &quot;Die Walz von der Pfalz&quot; (literally &quot;The steamroller from Palatinate&quot;) is referring to both, his playing style as well as to his origin. Briegel, who scored 47 goals in 240 Bundesliga matches, was a keen proponent of the idea of playing without shin pads and did not wear any in his career.

== International career ==

A Euro 1980 qualifying fixture against Wales in October 1979 gave Briegel his first chance to shine for West Germany and he did, enjoying his final breakthrough for his country in the mentioned tournament from which they emerged victorious. He was, then, part of the runner-up campaign of West Germany at the 1982 FIFA World Cup and featured alike in the less successful Euro 1984, all under the coaching of Jupp Derwall. In the 1982 World Cup final, he was responsible for conceding a penalty early in the game by fouling Bruno Conti. Luckily, the penalty was missed but it did not save West Germany from losing the final. Derwall&#x27;s successor Franz Beckenbauer kept him in his squads and, so, Briegel was able to take part in his second successive World Cup in Mexico in 1986. He was a regular, still, but finally the key to Argentina&#x27;s winning goal in the final. Three minutes past Rudi Völler&#x27;s equaliser and seven minutes short of the proposed extra-time, Briegel was, alongside his defending colleagues, hovering near the centre circle of the Estadio Azteca pitch on 29 June when Diego Maradona&#x27;s pass was going to get on its way to striker Jorge Burruchaga. With his teammates aware, all moving forward quickly before that pass happened (to put the Argentinian striker offside), Briegel&#x27;s hesitation worked as backfire for the West Germans, giving Burruchaga the chance to pounce decisively on them. Power-house Briegel tried to catch Burruchaga up in an attempt to dispossess him, indeed, but Burruchaga game-winning shot happened before Briegel&#x27;s desperate tackle came to happen. 
With Beckenbauer not a true fan of his way of playing and him not having any intention to stand in the way of the coach to build a new team ahead of Euro 1988, to be held in West Germany, the tall defender quit &quot;Die Nationalmannschaft&quot; with this, his 72nd, appearance.

== Managerial career ==

His first job in coaching Briegel did at FC Glarus, a second-tier club from Switzerland. He then took the ropes of German lower league side SV Edenkoben before he was given the role of manager at then relegated Bundesliga side SG Wattenscheid 09 in 1994, a stay that didn&#x27;t work out well. As a consequence he turned his back on coaching, re-joining 1. FC Kaiserslautern as sporting director in 1996. He resigned from that job in October 1997 following a hefty question of authority with the team&#x27;s manager, Otto Rehhagel. He, later on, returned as a director to the club, a decision that saw him being involved in a financial scandal.

He accepted the offer of the Football Association of Albania to become head coach of Albania in December 2002. Before accepting the role Briegel had had various other job offers as his coaching experience, however limited, had been that of assistant to Karl-Heinz Feldkamp at Beşiktaş J.K. in Turkey, and the successor of Feldkamp at Beşiktaş J.K. (from September 1999 to 30 June 2000) and further on top of coaching at fellow Turkish Super League team Trabzonspor (7 November 2001 – 30 June 2002). However, he went ahead and accepted the Albania job with very much success for four years (2002–2006). To date he is the most successful coach of Albania of all times because of the number of points per match in the two qualifiers UEFA Euro 2004 Qualifications and the FIFA World Cup 2006 Qualification. He resigned from the role on 9 May 2006, after the extension of the contract offered him by the Albanian Federation was linked to the results that would be obtained.

In June 2006, he agreed to a deal with the Football Association of Bahrain, taking over the Bahrain squad from Luka Peruzović. However, he was dismissed on 20 January 2007 during the 2007 Gulf Cup.

Briegel&#x27;s most recent engagement was coaching Turkish Super League side Ankaragücü, before leaving his post by the end of the 2006–07 season.

<text>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere is the second studio album by Canadian-American musician Neil Young, released in May 1969 on Reprise Records, catalogue number RS 6349. His first with longtime backing band Crazy Horse, it emerged as a sleeper hit amid Young&#x27;s contemporaneous success with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, ultimately peaking at number 34 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in August 1970 during a 98-week chart stay. It has been certified platinum by the RIAA.

The album is on the list of &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 208 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and at number 407 in the 2020 edition. Additionally, it was voted number 124 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

==Background==

The album is Young&#x27;s first with longtime collaborators Crazy Horse. Guitarist, songwriter and singer Danny Whitten, bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina had already been performing and recording together as The Rockets. They met Young through the Laurel Canyon music scene and started playing together. In a February 2021 interview, drummer Ralph Molina remembers how the group ended up collaborating with Young: 

Young recalls the atmosphere in an interview with J.C. Costa: &quot;We got together, started rehearsing and we went right in. That whole
album was like catching the group just as they were getting to know each other. We didn&#x27;t even know what we sounded like until we
heard the album.&quot; He continues in an April 1970 interview for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;Really literally, we&#x27;d only been together for six or seven days when &quot;Down By The River&quot; was cut. I just wanted to go ahead and do it, I just wanted to catch it, because there is something on those records that was recorded like it was when we were really feeling each other out, you know, and we didn&#x27;t know each other, but we were turned on to what was happening. So I wanted to record that, because that never gets recorded. And that&#x27;s what that album is, it&#x27;s just the bare beginnings.&quot;

Young credits the album&#x27;s unique sound to the guitar playing of Danny Whitten and the interplay between the two. He explains in the biography &quot;Shakey&quot;: 

==Songs==

The album contains several songs that became standards in Young&#x27;s performance repertoire. &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot;, &quot;Down by the River&quot;, and &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; were written in a single day while Young had a 103 °F (39.5 °C) fever. Young explains in his memoir, &quot;Waging Heavy Peace&quot;: 

The song &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; is in D modal tuning, a tuning Young first used with Stephen Stills on &quot;Bluebird&quot;. Young explains his relationship with the tuning with Nick Kent for Mojo Magazine in December 1995: &quot;Stills and I discovered this D modal tuning at around the same time in &#x27;66, I think... We&#x27;d play in that tuning together a lot. This was when &#x27;ragas&#x27; were happening and D modal made it possible to have that &#x27;droning&#x27; sound going on all the time, that&#x27;s where it started. Only I took it to the next level which is how &quot;The Loner&quot; (released on Young&#x27;s first solo album) and &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; happened. You make a traditional chord shape and any finger that doesn&#x27;t work, you just lift it up and let the string just ring. I&#x27;ve used that tuning throughout my career right up to today. You can hear it on everything from Fuckin&#x27; Up on Ragged Glory to War Of Man and One Of These Days on Harvest Moon. Lots of songs”.

In the &quot;Decade&quot; liner notes, Young states that he wrote &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; &quot;for a city girl on peeling pavement coming at me thru Phil Ochs eyes playing finger cymbals. It was hard to explain to my wife.&quot; He further explains in interview for the biography &quot;Shakey&quot;: &quot;I remember this one girl, Jean &quot;Monte&quot; Ray; she was the singing partner of Jim, Jim and Jean, a folk duo. Had a record out called &quot;People World,&quot; and she did a lot of dancing with finger cymbals. She was really great. Might’ve been her. Good chance. I kinda had a crush on her for a while. Moved nice. She was real musical, soulful. There’s images in there that have to do with Jean and there’s images that have to do with other people.&quot; In the 2005 liner notes to one of her own releases, Ray takes credit as inspiration for both &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; and &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand.&quot;

&quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; had been attempted for Young&#x27;s previous, debut album. Its lyrics express dissatisfaction with the pace of showbusiness life.

&quot;Round and Round&quot; is the oldest song on the album. Young recorded the song as a solo acoustic demo while a member of Buffalo Springfield. The demo appears on the 2001 Buffalo Springfield box set.

&quot;Down by the River&quot; has become one of Young&#x27;s signature songs, and, like Cinnamon Girl, one of his most frequently performed in concert. Its lyrics tell a tale reminiscent of &quot;Hey Joe,&quot; that of a man who murders his lover. In a 1970 interview with Robert Greenfield, Young suggests otherwise: &quot;There&#x27;s no real murder in it. It&#x27;s about blowing your thing with a chick. See, now, in the beginning, it&#x27;s &#x27;I&#x27;ll be on your side, you be on mine.&#x27; It could be anything. Then the chick thing comes in. Then at the end, it&#x27;s a whole other thing. It&#x27;s a plea; a desperation cry.&quot;

The lyrics to &quot;The Losing End (When You&#x27;re On)&quot; are about the experience of finding out that your romantic partner has moved on.

&quot;Running Dry (Requiem for the Rockets)&quot; is dedicated to The Rockets, the six-piece band that evolved into Young&#x27;s collaborators Crazy Horse. Rocket violinist Bobby Notkoff plays on the track. Young expresses his feelings about breaking up The Rockets in the 1997 film &quot;Year of the Horse&quot;: &quot;I asked those three guys to play with me as Crazy Horse. And I thought the Rockets could go on, too. But the truth is, I probably did steal them away from the other band, which was a good band. But only because what we did, we went somewhere. What they were doing, it didn&#x27;t go anywhere at that time, so this thing moved, this thing took off, and the other thing didn&#x27;t. But the other thing could have gone on, I guess. That&#x27;s the hardest part, is the guilt of the trail of destruction that I&#x27;ve left behind me.&quot;

&quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; attempts to convey an emotion, a moment in time without being too specific, so that the listener can relate to the song and free-associate with it. Young explains to the audience in a 2007 concert: &quot;These songs, some of them are like they&#x27;re antiques like me and the rest of us. But they&#x27;re really just about people like you and me, and feelings. And you only feel it for like a second and then you write it down. After that you don&#x27;t walk with that all the time. That&#x27;s why the songs live. Some of them live longer than others.&quot; He explains further in &quot;Shakey&quot;: &quot;The words to &#x27;Cowgirl in the Sand&#x27; are very important because you can free associate with them. Some words won&#x27;t let you do that, so you&#x27;re locked into the specific fuckin&#x27; thing the guy&#x27;s singin&#x27; about. This way it could be anything. The thing is, as long as there&#x27;s a thread that carries through it, then when you imagine what it&#x27;s about, there&#x27;s gonna be a thread that takes you to the end, too. You can follow your thought all the way through if you happen to have one, or if you don&#x27;t, you realize it doesn&#x27;t matter.

==Recording==

The album represents a break from the recording methods of Young&#x27;s work with Buffalo Springfield and his debut album, in which layers of overdubs are used to create each track. Instead, the songs on the album were largely recorded live, without overdubs. Young explains to DJ B. Mitchell Reid: &quot;That’s when a change came over me, right then. I started just tryin&#x27; to be real instead of fabricate something. Since then I&#x27;ve just been striving to get realer and realer on record. As in more real.&quot; For the first time, Young would record his vocal live while playing. &quot;My only concern was to make the fuckin&#x27; records sound right. When I finally got the studio together and played, I think, &quot;Running Dry,&quot; that was my first live vocal.&quot;

In a 1970 interview for Rolling Stone&#x27;s Elliot Blinder, Young says that he was trying to achieve a sound on the record reminiscent of 1950s and 1960s singles where the singer and band achieve a tight, locked-in sound together: 

Young enlisted David Briggs to produce the record. Young first collaborated with Briggs during the recording of his debut album. The first sessions for the album were held in late January 1969 at Wally Heider Studios in Hollywood, where the band cut &quot;Down by the River,&quot; &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; and &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.&quot;

&quot;Down by the River&quot; and &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; are edited from extended performances, and in some cases combine multiple takes. Young explains that three of four takes of each song were recorded in a 2009 interview for Guitar World Magazine: &quot;You know, maybe what you hear on the record would be take one, but with a couple pieces of something else in there. I could look it up. We have all the track sheets. All that information could be made available through &quot;Archives&quot; updates. We could make it so you could go in and figure out exactly what take you&#x27;re listening to of a specific song. He continues in &quot;Shakey&quot;: &quot;&#x27;Down by the River&#x27; was really edited. We got the vibe, but it was just too long and sometimes it fell apart, so we just took the shitty parts out. Made some radical cuts in there; I mean, you can hear &#x27;em. But Danny just played so cool on that. He made the whole band sound good. Me and Billy and Ralph sounded like Crazy Horse right away. All I had to do was come up with the songs and the riffs. I started realizing how long we could jam. It was fantastic.&quot;

Young&#x27;s lead vocal track on the song &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; (on the original album) was actually a temporary scratch vocal he sang through the low-quality talk-back microphone on the mixing board, with no effects such as reverb. Young liked the stark contrast to the rest of the recording.

The group would take a break in recording from the end of January until late March. Young would perform a series of solo acoustic sets at Le Hibou Coffee House in Ottawa and at the Riverboat Coffee House in Toronto. The Riverboat concerts would see release in 2009 as &quot;Live at the Riverboat 1969&quot;. Crazy Horse would then join Young for additional dates at coffeehouse folk clubs in late February through March. Young would perform a solo acoustic set followed by a band set, performing at The Bitter End in New York, in Cleveland, Providence, and at the Troubadour in Hollywood.

The band would return to Wally Heider on March 20 and record &quot;Cinnamon Girl,&quot; &quot;Losing End&quot; and &quot;Running Dry&quot;. &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; features handclaps, inspired by the 1963 single &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot; by The Angels. An early single mix of the song features the vocals of Danny Whitten more prominently, with both singers equal in the mix. Young changed the mix for the album, a decision he regrets: &quot;I have made an &quot;Early Daze&quot; record of the Horse, and you can hear a different vocal of &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; featuring more of Danny. He was singing the high part, and it came through big-time. I changed it so I sang the high part and put that out. That was a big mistake. I fucked up. I did not know who Danny was. He was better than me. I didn&#x27;t see it. I was strong, and maybe I helped destroy something sacred by not seeing it. He was never pissed off about it. It wasn&#x27;t like that. I was young, and maybe I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing. Some things you wish never happened. But we got what we got.&quot;

&quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; is noted for its one-note guitar solo. According to Young, &quot;people say that it is a solo with only one note but, in my head, each one of those notes is different. The more you get into it, the more you can hear the differences.” He elaborates in a 1991 interview: &quot;The same note on two strings. The wang bar made every one sound different. When people say &#x27;one-note solo,&#x27; I listen to it and every one sounds different to me. It sounds like it&#x27;s all different in that one place. As you&#x27;re going in farther, you’re hearing all the differences, but if you get back, it&#x27;s all one.&quot;

On March 23, the band convened with singer Robin Lane at Sunwest Recording Studio in Hollywood to record the final song for the album. &quot;Round and Round&quot; was performed live in the studio for the album to achieve a more authentic sound. Young would explain in an April 1970 interview for Rolling Stone: &quot;There were three people sitting like you and me, and then another, and six microphone booms coming down, absolutely stoned out of our minds in the studio, singing a song with the guitars, three guitars goin&#x27; at once. If you listen to it, &quot;Round And Round&quot; is one of my favorites on the second album, because ... the echo from the acoustic guitar on the right echoes back on the left, and the echo from the guitar on the left comes back on the right and it makes the guitars go like this: one line starts goin&#x27; like da-da-daow, and then you can hear like one voice comes in and out, and that&#x27;s &#x27;cause Danny was rockin&#x27; back and forth. Those things are not featured, they&#x27;re just in it, you know, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to get at. I think they last longer that way. Doing it live and singing and playing all at once just makes it sound more real.&quot; Singer Robin Lane was caught off guard that her performance on the song became the master take. &quot;I thought we were rehearsing. I didn’t even know what I was singing. Neil was the original punk rocker.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; was originally released on vinyl by Reprise on May 14, 1969. It was first released on CD in December 1987.

==Promotion==
Young would tour with Crazy Horse upon completion of the album, playing various dates in North America in May and June 1969. From August to December, Young would join Crosby, Stills and Nash for their tour of North America promoting their debut album. The group would perform at Woodstock and the Big Sur Folk Festival and perform &quot;Down by the River&quot; on ABC Television. In February and March 1970, Young would once again tour with Crazy Horse, performing the bulk of the album in the setlist. Performances at the Fillmore East with Miles Davis opening would see release in 2006 as &quot;Live at the Fillmore East&quot;.

==Reception==
Upon its release, &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; received generally favorable reviews from critics. Bruce Miroff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote a favorable review, describing Young&#x27;s voice as &quot;perpetually mournful, without being maudlin or pathetic. It hints at a world in which sorrow underlies everything [...] because that world is recognizable to most of us, Young&#x27;s singing is often strangely moving.&quot; Despite stating that &quot;in several respects [the album] falls short of his previous effort&quot; and that &quot;the lyricism of the first album can only be found in faint traces,&quot; he concluded that the album &quot;offers ample rewards. Young&#x27;s music partially makes up for its lack of grace by its energy and its assurance.&quot; Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that &quot;Young is a strange artist and I am not all the way into him yet, but this record is haunting&quot;. The original review was printed with a grade of &quot;B+&quot;, but Christgau later said he would have changed it to an &quot;A−&quot;.

In a retrospective review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Greg Kot called the record &quot;raw, rushed, energised&quot;, and the band&#x27;s interplay &quot;at once primitive and abstract&quot;, a &quot;gloriously spontaneous sound&quot; that &quot;would endure, not only as a blueprint for Young...but as an influence on countless bands.&quot; William Ruhlmann of music database website AllMusic said of the album, &quot;released only four months after his first [album], [it] was nearly a total rejection of that polished effort.&quot; He noted that &quot;Cinnamon Girl,&quot; &quot;Down by the River,&quot; and &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; were &quot;useful as frames on which to hang the extended improvisations Young played with Crazy Horse and to reflect the ominous tone of his singing&quot;. He concluded that the album &quot;set a musical pattern Young and his many musical descendants have followed ever since [...] and a lot of contemporary bands were playing music clearly influenced by it&quot;. Mark Richardson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote, &quot;the opening riff to &#x27;Cinnamon Girl&#x27; erases the memory of &quot;Neil Young&quot; completely in about five seconds&quot; and that &quot;Crazy Horse were loose and sloppy, privileging groove and feeling above all&quot;. He also said that &quot;Young sounds comfortable and confident, singing with the versatile voice that has changed remarkably little in the 40 years since&quot; and concluded that it &quot;was a sort of big bang for Young, a dense moment of creative explosion that saw possibilities expanding in every direction&quot;.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 208 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and 210 in a 2012 revised list, and number 407 in the 2020 edition. In 2013, the album was ranked 398 on &quot;NME&quot;″s list of the &#x27;500 Greatest Albums of all time&#x27;. In 2018, the album won the Polaris Heritage Prize Audience Award in the 1960–1975 category.

<text>Françoise Mbango Etone (born 14 April 1976 in Yaoundé) is a Cameroonian-born female former track and field athlete. She has competed internationally for France since 2010. While competing for Cameroon, Etone was a 2-time Olympic gold medalist in the triple jump at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece and 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. She held the Olympic record for triple jump which she set with a distance of 15.39 m at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. The 15.39 m is the third longest women&#x27;s triple jump in history under any conditions. Only 25 women have ever jumped 15 metres, Etone jumped beyond 15 metres on 7 of her last 11 attempts in the Olympic final alone.

Etone was also a talented long jumper who finished second at the African Championships in 1999. Etone was the first female athlete representing Cameroon to win medals at the Commonwealth Games, World Championships and Olympic Games. She has been a scholarship holder with the Olympic Solidarity program since November 2002.

During the 2005–06 academic year, she lived in New York City on a scholarship to attend St. John&#x27;s University in Queens, New York. The scholarship was made possible through the collaboration of the American electricity company AES Sonel along with US Ambassador to Cameroon, Niels Marquardt. She selected St. John&#x27;s University for study (along with her younger sister, Berthe) because of the school&#x27;s support of cultural programs in Cameroon.

<doc id="1033625" wikidata="Q131529" url="?curid=1033625" title="Hans Krankl">
<text>Johann &quot;Hans&quot; Krankl (; born 14 February 1953) is an Austrian former professional footballer. A prolific striker, he is regarded by many as one of Austria&#x27;s greatest players.

==Club career==

Krankl started his professional career at Rapid Wien and stayed there for 8 years, apart from a year at Wiener AC. He won the European Golden Boot at Rapid Wien in 1978, attracting the interest of Barcelona. His spell at Barcelona was successful, winning the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (scoring in the final itself), and picking up the top goalscorer&#x27;s award in La Liga that season with 29 goals. He returned to Rapid Wien in 1981, captaining the side and again scoring over 100 goals for them over the next 5 years. He played a major part in the most successful of Rapid teams in the 1980s, claiming the League crown twice, in 1982 and 1983, and three consecutive Austrian cup titles. He scored Rapid&#x27;s only goal in the 3–1 loss in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final in 1985 against Everton. In 1986, he moved to become player-manager at Wiener Sport-Club.

Krankl was named Austrian Player of the Year a record five times, and was voted the most popular Austrian player of the last 25 years.
==International career==
Krankl made his debut for Austria in a June 1973 friendly match against Brazil and was a participant at the 1978 and 1982 FIFA World Cups. He earned 69 caps, scoring 34 goals. His final international game was an April 1985 World Cup qualification match against Hungary. In the 1978–79 season of the Spanish Primera División, he was the top goalscorer with 29 goals for Barcelona and was awarded the Pichichi Trophy.

In a match against Malta in 1977, Krankl scored six goals as Austria ran out 9–0 winners.

One of his major achievements was helping Austria qualify for the 1978 FIFA World Cup, the first time Austria had qualified for the World Cup in twenty years. He then went on to score the winning goal against West Germany in a game dubbed &quot;The miracle of Córdoba&quot;, which the Austrians won 3–2 and which was Austria&#x27;s first win against West Germany in 47 years, earning Krankl legendary status in his homeland. Scored in the 88th minute, the live footage of the goal still regularly features on national television, and the audio commentary (&quot;Tor Tor Tor Tor Tor Tor, I werd&#x27; narrisch&quot; – &quot;Goal goal goal goal goal goal, I&#x27;m going crazy&quot;) is immediately recognised by Austrian football fans.

==Managerial career==

Since ending his playing career at Austria Salzburg in 1989, Krankl has worked as a football manager and coach. He was employed by the Austria national team. He was sacked on 28 September 2005 after Austria failed to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He was also manager of LASK Linz.

He has also intermittently featured as a studio guest and co-commentator on Austrian public service broadcaster ORF.

== Musical career ==
Krankl has also enjoyed domestic success with his music, with several releases entering the Austrian charts. His biggest musical success was the single &quot;Lonely Boy&quot;, released in 1985 and peaking at number 2.

<text>Bonifacio ( , , ; , , or ; ; ) is a commune in the southern tip of the island of Corsica, in the French department of Corse-du-Sud.

Bonifacio is the setting of Guy de Maupassant&#x27;s short story &quot;A Vendetta&quot;.

==Geography==

Bonifacio is located directly on the Mediterranean Sea, separated from Sardinia by the Strait of Bonifacio. It is a city placed on the best and only major harbour of the southern coast and also is a commune covering a somewhat larger region including the offshore &quot;Isles Lavezzi&quot;, giving it the distinction of being the southernmost commune in Metropolitan France. It lies closer to the capital cities of 20 other countries in Europe and Africa than its own, Paris. The commune is bordered on the northwest by the canton of Figari and has a short border on the northeast with the canton of Porto-Vecchio. The combined border runs approximately from the Golfe de Ventilegne on the west to the mouth of the Golfu di Sant&#x27;Amanza on the east. The coastline circumscribed by the two points is about . Highway N198 runs north along the east coast and N196 along the west.

The islands are part of the French portion, , of the international Bouches de Bonifacio (&quot;Strait of Bonifacio&quot;) marine park, a nature reserve, signed into legal existence by France and Italy in 1993 for the protection of the strait against passage of ships bearing dangerous chemicals, and implemented in France by a ministerial decree of 1999 detailing the land to be included in the réserve naturelle de Bouches de Bonifacio for the preservation of wild birds, other fauna and flora, fish and nature in general.

The southern coast in the vicinity of Bonifacio is an outcrop of chalk-white limestone, precipitous and sculpted into unusual shapes by the ocean. Slightly further inland the limestone adjoins the granite of which the two islands, Sardinia and Corsica, are formed. The port of Bonifacio is placed on the Bay of Bonifacio, a drowned ravine of a fjord-like appearance separated from the ocean by a finger-like promontory long and wide. In prehistoric post-glacial times when sea levels were low and the islands were connected, the ravine was part of a valley leading to upland Corsica. The maximum draught supported by the harbour is , more than ample for ancient ships and modern small vessels.

The city of Bonifacio is split into two sections. The &quot;vieille ville&quot; (old town), or &quot;la Haute Ville&quot; (the Upper city), on the site of a citadel, is located on the promontory overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The citadel was built in the 9th century with the foundation of the city. The Citadel has been reconstructed and renovated many times since its construction and most recently was an administrative center for the French Foreign Legion. Today it is more of a museum. Historically most of the inhabitants have resided in the &quot;Haute ville&quot; under the immediate protection of the citadel. The harbour facilities and residential areas below, &quot;la marine&quot;, line the narrow shelf of the inlet and extend for some distance up the valley, giving the settlement a linear appearance and creating a third residential section limited by St. Julien on the east.
The city and its fortifications also extend for some distance along the cliff-tops, which are at about elevation. The cliffs have been undercut by the ocean so that the buildings, which have been placed on the very lip of the precipice, appear to overhang it. The appearance from the sea is of a white city gleaming in the sun and suspended over the rough waters below.

==History==

===Prehistoric period===
Bonifacio has two prehistoric sites of some importance: the ancient cave shelter of Araguina-Sennola near the village of Capello on Route N96 just north of the city and a chambered tomb of Vasculacciu further north near Figari. The first is the site of the notable Lady of Bonifacio, a female burial carbon-dated to about 6570 BC, which is either late Mesolithic or Early Neolithic, and the second belongs to the Megalithic Culture and is dated to the Middle Neolithic. The alignment of the two and the extensive use of chert from Monte Arci in Sardinia shows that the Bay of Bonifacio was a route to inland Corsica from the earliest times.

===Roman period===
The only record of southernmost Corsica in Roman times comes from the geographer Ptolemy. He reports the coordinates of Marianum Promontory and town, which, plotted on a map, turn out to be the farthest south of Corsica. After listing the peoples of the east coast he states that the Subasani (ancient Greek Soubasanoi) were &quot;more to the south.&quot;

The people do not appear subsequently and the town and promontory have not been identified, nor do any Roman roads point to it. The only official road, the Via Corsica, ran between the Roman castra of Mariana and Aleria on the east coast and further south to Pallas, according to the Antonine Itinerary. Ptolemy places Pallas unequivocally on the east coast north of Marianum. Although unrecorded tracks and paths to the far south are possible, it is unlikely they would have carried any significant Roman traffic.

Maritime traffic through the strait however was significant and it could hardly have neglected the fine harbour at Bonifacio. The most popular choice for Marianum Promontory therefore is Cape Pertusato, southernmost point of Corsica island, about east of the harbor, with Bonifacio itself as Marianum town. A second possibility would be the first century AD Roman ruins adjoining Piantarella Beach near the village of Ciappili and next to the grounds of Sperone golf course, a recreational suburb to the west of Bonifacio, but those ruins appear to represent a Roman villa and the beach though eminently suitable for recreation is of little value as a port. More likely the villa belonged to a citizen of Bonifacio as Marianum.

===Tuscan period===
Corsica was taken from the Roman Empire in 469 by Genseric, king of the Vandals, and recovered by the Eastern Empire in 534. The Lombards having taken it again in 725, Charlemagne cleared them out by 774 and handed the island over to the Papacy, which had been the most powerful complainant of the island&#x27;s devastation by Germanic peoples. Starting in 806 the Moors of Spain began to contend for the island and held it for a short time but in 828 the Papacy assigned its defense to the margrave of Tuscany, a powerful state of the Holy Roman Empire nominally under the Kingdom of Italy.

The city in evidence today was founded as a fortress by and subsequently named after Boniface II of Tuscany in 828. He had led a naval expedition to suppress the Saracens of North Africa and returned to build an unassailable fortress and naval base from which the domains of Tuscany could be defended at the outermost frontier. Most of the citadel postdates the 9th century or is of uncertain date but Il Torrione, a round tower, was certainly part of the original citadel.

==Climate==
Bonifacio has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Bonifacio is . The average annual rainfall is with November as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in February, at around .

<doc id="1033633" wikidata="Q1071769" url="?curid=1033633" title="Baden Powell (mathematician)">
<text>Baden Powell, MA FRS FRGS (22 August 1796 – 11 June 1860) was an English mathematician and Church of England priest. He held the Savilian Chair of Geometry at the University of Oxford from 1827 to 1860. Powell was a prominent liberal theologian who put forward advanced ideas about evolution.

==Origins==
Baden Powell II was born at Stamford Hill, Hackney in London. His father, Baden Powell I (1767–1841), of Langton and Speldhurst in Kent, was a wine merchant, who served as High Sheriff of Kent in 1831, and as Master of the Worshipful Company of Mercers in 1822. The mother of Baden Powell II was Hester Powell (1776–1848), his father&#x27;s paternal first cousin, a daughter of James Powell (1737–1824) of Clapton, Hackney, Middlesex, Master of the Worshipful Company of Salters in 1818.

The Powell family can be traced back to the early 16th century, where they were yeomen farmers at Mildenhall in Suffolk. Baden Powell II&#x27;s great-grandfather, David Powell (1725–1810) of Homerton, Middlesex, a second son, migrated to the City of London aged 17 in 1712, subsequently going into business as a merchant at Old Broad Street and buying the manor of Wattisfield in Suffolk. In 1740 a branch of the family bought the Whitefriars Glass works.

The name Baden originated in Susanna Baden (1663–1737), the maternal grandmother of David Powell (1725–1810) of Homerton, Middlesex, and one of the ten children of Andrew Baden (1637–1716), a Mercer who served as Mayor of Salisbury in 1682.

==Education==
Powell was admitted as an undergraduate at Oriel College, Oxford in 1814, and graduated with a first-class honours degree in mathematics in 1817.

==Ordination==
Powell was ordained as a priest of the Church of England in 1821, having served as curate of Midhurst, Sussex. His first living was as Vicar of Plumstead, Kent, of which the advowson was owned by his family. He immediately began his scientific work there, starting with experiments on radiant heat.

==Marriages and children==

Powell married three times, and had fourteen children in total. His widow changed the last name of the surviving children of his third marriage to &quot;Baden-Powell&quot;.

Powell&#x27;s first marriage on 21 July 1821 to Eliza Rivaz (died 13 March 1836) was childless.

His second marriage on 27 September 1837 to Charlotte Pope (died 14 October 1844) produced one son and three daughters:
* Charlotte Elizabeth Powell, (14 September 1838–20 October 1917)
* Baden Henry Baden-Powell, FRSE (23 August 1841–2 January 1901)
* Louisa Ann Powell, (18 March 1843–1 August 1896)
* Laetitia Mary Powell, (4 June 1844–2 September 1865)
His third marriage on 10 March 1846 (at St Luke&#x27;s Church, Chelsea) to Henrietta Grace Smyth (3 September 1824–13 October 1914), a daughter of Admiral Smyth, produced seven sons and three daughters:
* Henry Warington Baden-Powell, (3 February 1847–24 April 1921), a naval officer, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a King&#x27;s Counsel (K.C.)
* Sir George Smyth Baden-Powell, (24 December 1847–20 November 1898), a politician and Conservative MP (1885–1898)
* Augustus Smyth Powell (1849–1863)
* Francis (Frank) Smyth Baden-Powell (29 July 1850– 25 December 1933), an artist who exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts
* Henrietta Smyth Powell (28 October 1851–9 March 1854)
* John Penrose Smyth Powell (21 December 1852–14 December 1855)
* Jessie Smyth Powell (25 November 1855–24 July 1856)
* Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, (22 February 1857–8 January 1941), an army officer, writer and a founder of the World Scouting Movement and (with his sister Agnes) founder of the Girl Guides.
* Agnes Smyth Baden-Powell, (16 December 1858–2 June 1945), founder of the Girl Guides.
* Baden Fletcher Smyth Baden-Powell, (22 May 1860–3 October 1937), an army officer, aviator and president of the Royal Aeronautical Society

Shortly after Powell&#x27;s death in 1860, his wife renamed the remaining children of his third marriage &#x27;Baden-Powell&#x27;; the name was eventually legally changed by royal licence on 30 April 1902. Baden Henry Powell is often also referred to as Baden Henry Baden-Powell, and was using this name by the 1891 census.

== Evolution ==
Powell was an outspoken advocate of the constant uniformity of the laws of the material world. His views were liberal, and he was sympathetic to evolutionary theory long before Charles Darwin had revealed his ideas. He argued that science should not be placed next to scripture or the two approaches would conflict, and in his own version of Francis Bacon&#x27;s dictum, contended that the book of God&#x27;s works was separate from the book of God&#x27;s word, claiming that moral and physical phenomena were completely independent.

His faith in the uniformity of nature (except man&#x27;s mind) was set out in a theological argument; if God is a lawgiver, then a &quot;miracle&quot; would break the lawful edicts that had been issued at Creation. Therefore, a belief in miracles would be entirely atheistic. Powell&#x27;s most significant works defended, in succession, the uniformitarian geology set out by Charles Lyell and the evolutionary ideas in &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; published anonymously by Robert Chambers which applied uniform laws to the history of life in contrast to more respectable ideas such as catastrophism involving a series of divine creations. &quot;He insisted that no tortured interpretation of Genesis would ever suffice; we had to let go of the Days of Creation and base Christianity on the moral laws of the New Testament.&quot;

The boldness of Powell and other theologians in dealing with science led Joseph Dalton Hooker to comment in a letter to Asa Gray dated 29 March 1857: &quot;These parsons are so in the habit of dealing with the abstractions of doctrines as if there was no difficulty about them whatever, so confident, from the practice of having the talk all to themselves for an hour at least every week with no one to gainsay a syllable they utter, be it ever so loose or bad, that they gallop over the course when their field is Botany or Geology as if we were in the pews and they in the pulpit. Witness the self-confident style of Whewell and Baden Powell, Sedgwick and Buckland.&quot; William Whewell, Adam Sedgwick and William Buckland opposed evolutionary ideas.

When the idea of natural selection was mooted by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in their 1858 papers to the Linnaean Society, both Powell and his brother-in-law William Henry Flower thought that natural selection made creation rational.

==&quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;==
He was one of seven liberal theologians who produced a manifesto titled &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; around February 1860, which amongst other things joined in the debate over &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. These Anglicans included Oxford professors, country clergymen, the headmaster of Rugby school and a layman. Their declaration that miracles were irrational stirred up unprecedented anger, drawing much of the fire away from Charles Darwin. &quot;Essays&quot; sold 22,000 copies in two years, more than the &quot;Origin&quot; sold in twenty years, and sparked five years of increasingly polarised debate with books and pamphlets furiously contesting the issues.

Referring to &quot;Mr Darwin&#x27;s masterly volume&quot; and restating his argument that belief in miracles is atheistic, Baden Powell wrote that the book &quot;must soon bring about an entire revolution in opinion in favour of the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature.&quot;:
He would have been on the platform at the British Association for the Advancement of Science 1860 Oxford evolution debate that was a highlight of the reaction to Darwin&#x27;s theory. Huxley&#x27;s antagonist Wilberforce was also the foremost critic of &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;. Powell died of a heart attack a fortnight before the meeting. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

<doc id="1033634" wikidata="Q7756426" url="?curid=1033634" title="The Peach Orchard">
<text>The Peach Orchard is a Gettysburg Battlefield site at the southeast corner of the north-south Emmitsburg Road intersection with the Wheatfield Road. The orchard is demarcated on the east and south by Birney Avenue, which provides access to various memorials regarding the &quot;momentous attacks and counterattacks in…the orchard on the afternoon of July 2, 1863.&quot;

==Geography==
The Peach Orchard is on a hornfel along the northwest edge of the local geologic diabase sheet and at the &quot;angle of the Peach Orchard&quot; formed by the vertex of 2 low ridges: &quot;one from Devil&#x27;s Den, the other along the Emmitsburg road.&quot; The orchard drains southward into Rose Run, through Rose Woods, to Plum Run; and the orchard tract has a modern north-south embankment along the Emmitsburg road to the west of which a drainage depression separates the orchard from Warfield Ridge.

==History==
By 1858 on the southeast corner of the crossroads, the Peach Orchard had been planted by Reverend Joseph Sherfy, who had a homestead to the north on the opposite (west) side of the Emmitsburg Road. On the Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day, the &quot;Peach Orchard Salient&quot; military position of the Army of the Potomac had been established from the &quot;angle of the Peach Orchard&quot; both northward along the Emmitsburg Rd and, for the &quot;Wheatfield Road line&quot;, eastward. Union positions in the orchard prior to the July 2 military engagements included the 68th Pennsylvania Infantry on the west side at the south point of Graham&#x27;s Emmitsburg Rd line, the 3rd Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment on the orchard&#x27;s south (downhill) side near the Emmitsburg Rd, and on the north side of the orchard along the south side of the east-west road, Thompson&#x27;s cannons and, closer to the Emmitsburg Rd, Ames&#x27; cannons. &quot;It was three o&#x27;clock before [Confederate] Colonel Alexander, of Longstreet&#x27;s corps, had his batteries unlimbered in the edge of the woods west and south of the peach orchard.&quot;

===Military engagements===
Peach Orchard combat began with Union artillery in the orchard counterfiring on Alexander&#x27;s batteries which reduced Ames&#x27; supply of Union cannon ammunition. When Hood&#x27;s Assault advanced eastward over the Emmitsburg Rd and across the slope south of the orchard, &quot;Ames had all of his spherical case [ammunition] carried to his left section, Lt. James B. Hazelton&#x27;s,&quot; to fire on the infantry, while Ames&#x27; &quot;center and right sections continued their counterbattery fire with shot.&quot; With the Confederate left flank to the south exposed to the orchard&#x27;s Union forces, the cannon and infantry in the &quot;Peach Orchard were able to rake Kershaw&#x27;s lines severely&quot;. As Union officer Watson&#x27;s guns fired a last volley of canister at the Carolinians, the 2nd New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry advanced southward into &quot;the Peach Orchard to save the [Watson] guns…crowding between the limbers and guns, reformed, and emerged at the orchard&#x27;s southwest corner, its right extending to the Emmitsburg Road.&quot; &quot;The Second opened fire on the South Carolinians in its front, the Second Battalion and the Eighth Regiment. The South Carolinians…fell back to the bottom of the slope 150 or so yards from the orchard&#x27;s edge. Bailey then shifted the Second&#x27;s line to the rear of some fence rails that were piled along the side of the orchard where a fence had been.&quot;

At the 6 p.m. start of McLaws&#x27; Assault, Barksdale&#x27;s and Wofford&#x27;s Confederate brigades charged from the west directly into the Peach Orchard. Graham&#x27;s Union brigade, with the 3rd ME &amp; 3rd MI, &quot;held the peach orchard until nearly dusk&quot;; and at &quot;6:30 p.m., McLaws&#x27; Division &quot;[broke]&quot; Birney&#x27;s line at the Peach Orchard&quot;. The 21st Mississippi Infantry Regiment passed through the Peach Orchard toward Bigelow&#x27;s 9th Massachusetts Battery farther east, also outflanking the 2nd New Hampshire, threatening it to be cut off from the rest of the Union, forcing them to retreat.

The 2nd NH entered the Battle of Gettysburg with 353 soldiers. In under three hours, 47 were killed, 136 wounded and 36 men went missing; of the 24 officers, only three were not killed or wounded.

===Postbellum===
Franklin Dullin Briscoe&#x27;s artwork, &quot;Peach Orchard – Gettysburg&quot;, is now in the National Archives; and the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association board approved purchase of the orchard in 1890 (several Peach Orchard memorials were erected during the memorial association era--e.g., 68th Pennsylvania Infantry in 1886). Battlefield landscape preservation began in 1883 when peach trees were replanted in the orchard, and in 1896 a cast iron site identification marker was added near the road intersection. The orchard was deeded to the War Department in 1906, was replanted in 1909, and exhibited 6 &quot;Army of the Potomac&quot; cannon by 1912. The land bordering the orchard to the east and south was purchased from J. Emory Bair in 1907, and Birney Avenue of on those 2 sides was piked in 1914. The Camp Eisenhower YCC participants replaced the orchard&#x27;s peach trees in 1974, the orchard&#x27;s ID tablet by Emmor Cope was entered-documented as an historic district contributing structure in 2004, and the orchard was replanted in April 2008..

<doc id="1033637" wikidata="Q7353515" url="?curid=1033637" title="Robson Rotation">
<text>Robson Rotation is an Australian term for the practice of rotating the order of candidates&#x27; names during the printing of the ballot papers for an election, so that the advantage of being listed near the start of the ballot is spread equally among all candidates. Such an advantage is particularly strong in elections in Australia, where the combination of single transferable vote and compulsory voting leads many politically apathetic voters to cast a &quot;donkey vote&quot; ranking the candidates in the order in which they are listed. Robson Rotation, first used in the Tasmanian House of Assembly in the 1980 Denison by-election, is named after Neil Robson, then Liberal member for Bass. It was adopted in Australian Capital Territory elections in 1995.

Traditionally, every ballot paper in an election is identical, with the candidates&#x27; names and their party groups (if any) in the same order. Within the party or group ticket, the order of their candidates&#x27; names is decided by the group. The order of the candidates or groups on the ballot is now usually determined by lot, by the authority running the election, although alphabetical order by surname was formerly used for elections contested by individual candidates.

Having all ballot papers the same can give a slight advantage to the candidate or group listed at the top, or top left, of the ballot paper (depending on the format of the paper) because they will attract a donkey vote. Donkey voters number the preferences on their ballots from left to right and/or top to bottom, purely in the order of the candidates&#x27; names and groups on the ballot.

Such voters are a feature of voting systems which require people to express their degree of preference for every candidate or group, by numbering them in preferential order, or have their vote declared invalid. While donkey votes may only form a small percentage of votes cast, they could affect the result in a close contest. The more candidates there are on the ballot paper, the greater the donkey vote is likely to be.

To eliminate any donkey vote advantage, the Robson Rotation system requires ballot papers to be printed in equal-sized batches, with each batch having a different candidate&#x27;s name appearing at prescribed positions in the party columns on those ballots. Consequently, there are several possible permutations of where candidates&#x27; names appear on the various versions of the ballot paper. Although that doesn&#x27;t eliminate donkey voting, it spreads its effect more or less equally among all the candidates standing for election.

==Kromkowski rotation in Indiana==

A similar kind of ballot rotation was introduced in St. Joseph County, Indiana, in the 1970s. The method, used for both printed ballots and lever-operated machine voting, was developed and introduced by Aloysius J. Kromkowski, the head of the election commission, and one of the most popular elected officials (St. Joseph County Clerk until term limited and St. Joseph County Treasurer until term limited). Every precinct had alphabetically shifted ballots. For example, in precinct 1, names on the ballot would be in standard alphabetical order. In precinct 2, names on the ballot would start with the second alphabetically-ordered candidate and the first ordered would be shifted to the bottom, and so on.

It was later codified into law via IC 3-11-14-11.

<doc id="1033638" wikidata="Q1332675" url="?curid=1033638" title="Platycerium">
<text>Platycerium is a genus of about 18 fern species in the polypod family, Polypodiaceae. Ferns in this genus are widely known as staghorn or elkhorn ferns due to their uniquely shaped fronds. This genus is epiphytic and is native to tropical and temperate areas of South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Guinea.

==Description==
&quot;Platycerium&quot; sporophytes (adult plants) have tufted roots, growing from a short rhizome, and bear two types of fronds - basal and fertile fronds. Basal fronds are sterile, shield- or kidney-shaped, and laminate against the tree, to protect the fern&#x27;s roots from damage and desiccation. In some &quot;Platycerium&quot; species, the top margin of these fronds will grow into an open crown of lobes; catching rainwater, falling forest litter, bird/animal droppings, and even an occasional fallen deceased animal, these plants build up their own “compost” system of nutrition over many years.

Fertile fronds bear spores on their undersurface, are dichotomous or antler-shaped, and jut out or hang from the rhizome. The spores are borne in sporangia, clustered in large sori that are usually positioned on the tips of the lobes, on a specialized stalked lobe (as in &quot;P. ridleyi&quot; and &quot;P. coronarium&quot;), or at the sinus between frond lobes. 

Some species of &quot;Platycerium&quot; are solitary, having only one rhizome. Other species form colonies when their rhizomes branch, or when new rhizomes are formed from root tips. If the conditions are right, the spores will germinate naturally, on surrounding trees. A &quot;Platycerium&quot; gametophyte is a small, heart-shaped thallus.

&quot;Platycerium&quot; have diverged into four natural groups. Several &quot;Platycerium&quot; are strongly adapted to xeric conditions, with a naturally drought-tolerant metabolism method having been reported for &quot;P. veitchii&quot;.

==Species==
==Cultivation==
The species &quot;Platycerium bifurcatum&quot; and &quot;Platycerium superbum&quot; are commonly cultivated as ornamental plants. These oddly shaped ferns grow on trees and rocks and can be found in gardens, especially tropical gardens.

Staghorns can be propagated by spores produced on the underside of the fertile fronds. Colonial &quot;Platycerium&quot; can also be vegetatively propagated by carefully dividing large healthy ones into smaller, separate plants. These new plants can then be attached to board mounts or be strapped to trees until they take to the tree themselves.

A mature staghorn can grow more than wide.

<doc id="1033639" wikidata="Q234549" url="?curid=1033639" title="Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg">
<text>Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg (9 July 1511 – 7 October 1571) was queen consort of Denmark and Norway by marriage to King Christian III of Denmark. She was known to having wielded influence upon the affairs of state in Denmark.

==Life==

She was the daughter of Magnus I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg and Catherine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and sister of Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg, the first queen of King Gustav I of Sweden.

Dorothea was raised in one of the first states in Germany where the reformation was proclaimed, and was affected from Lutheranism early in life. She was married to Christian on 29 October 1525 at Lauenburg Castle. They lived at their own courts in Haderslev and Törning.

===Queen===

She formally became queen of Denmark in 1533, but due to the Civil War (Count&#x27;s Feud) that immediately followed her husband&#x27;s accession to the throne, her coronation did not take place until 1537. On 6 August 1536, queen Dorothea finally made her official entry to the capital of Copenhagen with the king, and on 12 August 1537, she rode on a snow white horse by the side of her husband to their coronation, and made a favorable impression with her beauty and dignified appearance. In 1537 she also became queen of Norway, after her husband did a Coup d&#x27;état, and became king of Norway.

Queen Dorothea&#x27;s relationship to the king is described as a happy one, and the king evidently trusted her and allowed her a great deal of influence. She was repeatedly pointed out by contemporaries to have been politically active and to have participated in state affairs, but these comments are only general statements and do not describe exactly how and within which issues she took an interest and used her influence. Shortly after her husband&#x27;s succession to the thrones of Denmark and Norway, the king, supported by his German advisers, supported the plans to have Dorothea appointed future regent of Denmark-Norway should her son succeeded to the throne while still a minor; these plans were, however, resisted by the Danish council and particularly Johan Friis, whom the queen reportedly came to resent because of it. Neither was she allowed to take a formal seat in the council. Her influence, therefore, continued to be informal, and she is thought to have participated in appointing and dismissing officials.

Dorothea reportedly learned to speak Danish, and is known to have a German confessor and always to have written her letters in German. She was described as beautiful, with a great posture and an impulsive, passionate mind with a strong will force; she enjoyed hunting, &quot;as she was an excellent rider&quot;, and as late as 1555 was noted to have participated in a hunt with such energy that she fell off her horse. 
As the first lady of the royal household, queen Dorothea hosted festivities with great splendor when motivated as representation of royal power, but was in everyday life described as strict, moral and frugal; she supervised the finances of the household herself, allowed for no waste and had all members of the court in constant occupation, allowing her ladies-in-waiting no time for leisure.

Dorothea is described as a dominating mother who kept strict control over her children also after they became adults, and her acts as a guardian to them were described as strict and intense. As was the custom of the time, she also had several children of the nobility as her foster children, who were raised in her household as her courtiers and maids-of-honor, over whom she also kept a strict control. In 1540, Birgitte Gøye was freed from her engagement with her assistance, which led to a law banning arranged engagements of minors. Her daughters were raised in household chores and to marry, while her sons were given a strict schooling and not allowed to stray from their studies much prior to their adulthood. In 1548, she accompanied her daughter Anna to her wedding in Saxony, and she kept visiting her daughters in Germany regularly once a year for the rest of her life.

She was widowed in 1559.

===Queen Dowager===

As a queen dowager, she resided with her own court in Koldinghus.

Queen dowager Dorothea fell in love with her brother-in-law and neighbor, Duke John II of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev (1521–1580), during her marriage, and despite her intense grief at the deathbed of her spouse, she issued negotiations to marry her former brother-in-law shortly after her husband&#x27;s death in 1559. Her intended marriage, however, was opposed by various theologians who considered it impossible for a widow to marry her late husband&#x27;s brother and was eventually prevented, despite several years efforts from Dorothea&#x27;s part to bring it about. This caused the breakdown of her relationship with her son, King Frederick, with whom she had never been particularly close. In parallel, Dorothea successfully opposed her son the king&#x27;s desired marriage with her maid of honor Anne Hardenberg, a matter which was also drawn out for years.

The relationship between queen dowager Dorothea and her reigning son king Frederick II was tense. Frederick was given his own court at the age of twenty, and Dorothea often used her authority as his mother to reprimand him for his lifestyle of &quot;drinking and other indecencies&quot;, and this state of affairs did not change after Frederick became king. She favored her younger sons, particularly Magnus, to the point that he had difficulties handling his responsibilities on his own, and protected her younger children from her eldest son the king and what she regarded as his bad influence. Her less favorable view upon her eldest son may also have affected by the fact that he did not attend his fathers deathbed, despite the fact that his mother repeatedly called upon him during his father&#x27;s illness to do so.

Dorothea considered it her God given right and duty as a mother not only to love but to advise and rule over her children, including her son the king, and once wrote: 
:&quot;It does not become a faithful mother to be silent about what could bring the ruin to her children, or to flatter, rather God has earnestly commanded not to spare the lash.&quot; 
However, Frederick II detested both her reprimands and her attempts to involve in state affairs as she had done during his father&#x27;s reign.

The tense relationship between Dorothea and Frederick II finally resulted in a break during the Nordic Seven Years War (1562–1570). Dorothea intensely disliked the war and repeatedly offered herself as a mediator to put an end to it. Her son Frederick II greatly disliked her interference and warned her to stay out of state affairs in no uncertain terms, upon which she replied: &quot;We can, God be praised, do without this long journey to Sweden and now have a good day with a clear conscience [...] You may be convinced, that we have no intention to trouble ourselves in this matter, when we can understand from your letter that you now better&quot; - but she resumed her efforts to act as a mediator the following year. Dorothea issued separate contact with Sweden, and in 1567, Frederick II discovered that his mother had conducted secret negotiations to arranged a marriage between his brother Magnus and Princess Sophia of Sweden in an effort to establish peace, without his knowledge and during ongoing warfare. She defended herself by saying that she had only intended to benefit Denmark, but the king suspected her for treason and had her informally exiled to Sønderborg Castle, where she resided the remainder of her life. Frederick II also had a ship she sent to Magnus with supplies seized under suspicion that it was heading for Sweden.

Queen Dorothea is interred next to her husband in Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen.

<text>Listed below are the dates and results for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] qualification rounds for [[UEFA]] teams. A total of 51 teams took part, divided in 8 groups – five groups of six teams each and three groups of seven teams each – competing for 13 places in the World Cup. Germany, the hosts, were already qualified, for a total of 14 European places in the tournament. The qualifying process started on 18 August 2004, over a month after the end of UEFA Euro 2004, and ended on 16 November 2005. Kazakhstan, which transitioned from the Asian Football Confederation to UEFA after the end of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, debuted in the European qualifiers.

The teams in each group would play against each other in a home and away basis. The team with the most points in each group qualified to the World Cup. The runners up are ranked. For fairness rules, results against the seventh placed team were ignored, in groups of seven teams. The two best ranked runners-up also qualified to the World Cup. The other six runners-up were drawn into three two-legged knock out matches, the playoff winners also qualifying.

The race to join hosts Germany at the 2006 FIFA World Cup featured an unlikely winner in Europe, where Ukraine became the first team to qualify, having finished above Turkey, Denmark and Greece in arguably the continent&#x27;s toughest qualifying group.

France had its first successful World Cup qualifying campaign in twenty years as they had missed the 1990 and 1994 tournaments, then qualified automatically as hosts in 1998 and as defending champions in 2002.

Serbia and Montenegro and Croatia also advanced to Germany at the head of their sections, the former forcing Spain into the playoffs in the process. Besides the eight group winners, two teams progressed automatically as best runners up, namely Poland and Sweden while the playoffs offered a second chance to six others.

==Qualification seeding (UEFA)==
The draw was made on 5 December 2003 in Frankfurt, Germany. Germany qualified automatically as hosts. The other seedings were determined by points per game in the qualifiers for 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification and UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying. France qualified automatically for the 2002 FIFA World Cup as title holders, so only their record in UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying was used. Portugal qualified automatically for UEFA Euro 2004 as hosts, so only their record in World Cup 2002 was used. Kazakhstan were not ranked by this system as they did not participate in either competition.

For domestic clubs involved in international club competitions reasons, England, France, Italy and Spain were drawn into groups of 6 teams.

==First round==
===Summary===


===Group 1===
===Group 2===

===Group 3===

<doc id="1033642" wikidata="Q782848" url="?curid=1033642" title="Avengers Disassembled">
<text>&quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; is a 2004 crossover storyline published by Marvel Comics involving the Avengers, Fantastic Four, Captain America, Spider-Man and Thor. The beginning of Brian Michael Bendis&#x27;s &quot;Avengers&quot; run, it depicts the destruction of the existing traditional roster and the exile of several key members of the team. The storyline includes a number of subplots, some of which take place before and/or after the main events, which include other changes to the status quo: Iron Man once again closeting his secret identity, Spider-Man developing organic web-shooters (as in the contemporary Sam Raimi film trilogy), and the death of Thor and Asgard in one final Ragnarok.

The main story, &quot;Chaos&quot;, ran in &quot;Avengers&quot; #500-503 and a special epilogue, &quot;Avengers Finale&quot;. 
The series would lead to a massive relaunch of the Avengers family of titles: New Avengers, New Thunderbolts, Captain America, and Iron Man; and the launch of Young Avengers.

==Plot summary==
===Avengers===
Jack of Hearts, who had been dead before the storyline, arrives at Avengers Mansion. The zombified hero explodes, damaging the mansion. Scott Lang is killed in the blast. The Vision pilots an Avengers Quinjet into the partially damaged Avengers Mansion, causing more damage. 

Elsewhere, Wanda Maximoff arrives at the United Nations, where she speaks with Captain America, who announces that he is ending their fledgling relationship. Tony Stark suddenly becomes drunk and belligerent despite not having imbibed any alcohol at an important UN meeting to decide if the Avengers should have their security clearance revoked following the events of &quot;Secret War&quot;. After Tony drunkenly attempts to pick a fight with the Latverian ambassador, the Avengers UN charter is revoked; Iron Man leaves Hank Pym in the lurch to respond to the &quot;Code White&quot; from Avengers Mansion.

Leaving the crashed Quinjet, Vision warns the Avengers of a mysterious plan to destroy the team and then vomits up eggs that spawn Ultron drones that attack the Avengers. She-Hulk becomes consumed with bloodlust, tearing Vision in half, killing him, and brutally assaulting Wasp and Captain America.

She-Hulk is subdued by Iron Man and Captain America and Hank Pym joins them and rushes Wasp to the hospital. Returning, Hank reveals to Cap and the team of Iron Man&#x27;s drunken outburst at the UN and the UN&#x27;s decision to revoke their charter. All past members of the Avengers gather at the mansion, fearing that Ultron may be behind the attack. Suddenly an armada of Kree soldiers appear in the sky and attack Manhattan. In the ensuing battle, Hawkeye&#x27;s arrows are hit, causing their explosives to go off. In his dying moments, Hawkeye takes out a Kree battleship in the blast after taking flight with a commandeered Kree jet pack.

In the wake of Hawkeye&#x27;s death, Doctor Strange appears for the first time since the Dark Dimension invasion several months earlier. He explains to the Avengers that the inexplicable events—Tony&#x27;s sudden inebriation, She-Hulk and Vision&#x27;s loss of control, Jack of Heart&#x27;s resurrection, and the enemies they have encountered—are magical and that their trail leads to Wanda. A flashback reveals that Wanda has lost her sanity after an errant comment about motherhood from the Wasp triggered a suppressed memory of Wanda&#x27;s lost twin children, William and Thomas. The children were magical constructs Wanda created in an impossible conception between her and the Vision. They were lost when both children were magically absorbed by the villain Master Pandemonium, and the memory was suppressed by Wanda&#x27;s mentor, Agatha Harkness, reasoning that the children were unnatural constructs and better for Wanda to forget. The reawakened memory has caused Wanda to lose her sanity and blame the Avengers for the loss of her children. Strange reveals that the abilities previous ascribed to Wanda&#x27;s &quot;chaos magick&quot; are actually uncontrolled manifestations of her ability to warp reality, and that she must be taken down immediately before she threatens the world in her current mental state.

The Avengers visit the home of Agatha Harkness, and find her long dead, having been killed by Wanda. The Avengers find Wanda, who summons an army of the Avengers&#x27; past enemies to destroy them, including a version of Rogue, Red Skull, and a group of SS troops. Doctor Strange uses the Eye of Agamotto to put Wanda into a coma. Before the Avengers can decide what to do or how to deal with their losses, Magneto arrives to retrieve Wanda from the Avengers, much to Captain America&#x27;s dismay and horror. Reluctantly, he allows Magneto to take his daughter with him after he vows to help her with the assistance of Charles Xavier.

In the aftermath, the Avengers disband, but reminisce about their numerous triumphs and memories of one another. Pietro Maximoff arrives and apologizes for Wanda, letting them know that Xavier is attempting to fix Wanda&#x27;s mind, before speeding away. The remaining members accept their losses, discuss Wanda&#x27;s history, and struggle with forgiveness. Ultimately, they toast to their fallen comrades, including Wanda. As they leave the destroyed headquarters, they are greeted by a civilian vigil, bearing candles and signs expressing gratitude for the heroes.

===Iron Man===
After rescuing Force from the corrupt senators who have been trying to kill Tony Stark since he became U.S. Defense Secretary, Iron Man finds himself targeted by an impostor who murders his longtime love interest Rumiko Fujikawa. Iron Man eventually defeats his impersonator and brings down the ring of corrupt senators who organized the murder and blackmailed Force. Realizing that his loved ones are being targeted by his enemies, Stark gives a press conference where he announces that he is resigning as Defense Secretary and will no longer actively be Iron Man, in favor of returning to &quot;subordinates&quot; filling the role for him.

===Thor===
A mystic force that is the living embodiment of Ragnarok has begun slaying the Asgardian Gods in rapid succession. Investigating the genocide of his people, Thor discovers that the universe itself is seeking to eliminate the Asgardians for cheating death by surviving countless previous attempts by the universe to fulfill Ragnarok and wipe out the Asgardians. Ultimately Thor allows himself to be destroyed, as all known Asgardians are destroyed.

===Captain America and Falcon===
Captain America and Falcon are in the midst of an international scandal between a naval intelligence operation (ONI) and a Drug Cartel with ties to A.I.M when Cap starts having hallucinations; some of them involving encounters with his fellow Avenger Wanda Maximoff A.K.A. the Scarlet Witch. Meanwhile, Falcon is gifted a new enhanced costume from Wakanda and uses it to escape the feds.
Captain America discusses his past, most notably his guilt from the death of Bucky, with Scarlet Witch and she eases his trouble. While they engage in a romance, Cap cites that he can not give her the normal life she desires due to his own emotional issues. His apparent romance with the Scarlet Witch ceases just prior to the UN meeting to retain their UN Charter. Wanda, oddly tells him she has no recollection of their romance, indicating that Cap hallucinated the whole thing. Cap later believes that due to the events of &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot;, Wanda was responsible for his visions and Falcon&#x27;s aggressive behavior.

===Spectacular Spider-Man===
Peter Parker finds himself locked in a desperate battle with Adrianna &quot;Ana&quot; Soria (aka &quot;The Queen&quot;), a mysterious villainess with the ability to control her minions with powerful pheromones. During their first confrontation, a captive Peter is forcefully kissed by the Queen, causing him to mutate into a grotesque human-spider hybrid over the course of many days. As he attempts to return himself to normal, it&#x27;s ultimately revealed that the Queen&#x27;s powers are the result of an American military experiment from World War II, and she has returned to seek revenge on the US government for abandoning her after the war.

In his final confrontation with the Queen, Peter stops her from destroying all human life in New York City with a biological bomb. In the course of the battle, he is fully transformed into a monstrous spider, but the transformation has the unintended side-effect of making him pregnant—allowing him to give birth to a perfect replica of his old human self, with all of his memories fully intact. In his new form, Peter possesses the ability to shoot organic webbing from his wrists, eliminating the need for his homemade &quot;web-shooters&quot;.

===Fantastic Four===
While the Avengers face the destruction of their mansion and the invading Kree armada, Wizard and the Frightful Four launch a surprise attack on the Fantastic Four, defeating the heroes and seizing control over the Baxter Building. The Fantastic Four regroup.

===Captain America===
Following the events of &quot;Disassembled&quot;, Captain America is naturally depressed and rekindles a relationship with Diamondback (Rachel Leighton). Meanwhile, the Red Skull conspires with a corrupt SHIELD agent to kill Captain America using Diamondback, but his plan backfires. During these events Steve realizes his love for Rachel.

==Aftermath==
In the wake of &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot;, two new Avengers series were created. The &quot;New Avengers&quot; title replaced the &quot;Avengers&quot; title (with a new No. 1 in December 2004) which ended with issue No. 503 and &quot;Avengers Finale&quot; (November 2004). This new title continued with the creative team of writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist David Finch. The other title, premiering February 2005, was &quot;Young Avengers&quot;, which featured teenage heroes, each of whom (except Hawkeye) related in some way to the legacy of the Avengers. This series was written by Allan Heinberg, a writer for &quot;The OC&quot;, with art by Jim Cheung. The group was revived by its creators in July 2010 with the bimonthly series &quot;&quot; which is a follow-up to &quot;Disassembled&quot; and &quot;House of M&quot;.

The Scarlet Witch&#x27;s storyline continued in the pages of &quot;Excalibur&quot;, where Magneto and Professor X tried helping her, to no avail. This in turn led into the &quot;House of M&quot; mini-series and crossover, also written by Bendis.

The event is now considered by Marvel editors as the first part of a long series of events, which includes &quot;House of M&quot;, &quot;Decimation&quot;, &quot;Planet Hulk&quot;, &quot;Civil War&quot;, &quot;The Initiative&quot;, &quot;Endangered Species&quot;, &quot;World War Hulk&quot;, &quot;Messiah Complex&quot;, &quot;Divided We Stand&quot;, &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, &quot;Dark Reign&quot;, &quot;Messiah War&quot;, &quot;Utopia&quot;, &quot;Nation X&quot; and &quot;Necrosha&quot;. All these grim events lead up to &quot;Siege&quot; written by Brian Michael Bendis in 2010, which ushers in a new Heroic Age for Marvel, and &quot;X-Men: Second Coming&quot; by Christopher Yost and Craig Kyle, which sees the slow rebirth of Earth&#x27;s Mutant population.

As for the Avengers killed during &quot;Disassembled&quot; saga, they have all returned to life in separate events. Hawkeye was rematerialized by Wanda during the House of M story. Ant-Man was rescued by the time-traveling Young Avengers during &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot;, as Stature brings him away from the range of Jack of Hearts&#x27; explosion. Ant-Man is thus brought to the present along with the Young Avengers. The Vision is successfully rebuilt by Tony Stark after Fear Itself, and Jack of Hearts is restored by a team of scientists of Project Pegasus: during an assault of a pack of zombified clones of Squadron Supreme, a source of zero-point energy aggregates taking the corporeal form of Jack Hart.

==List of crossover issues==
* &quot;Avengers&quot; #500–503 (main story)
* &quot;Avengers Finale&quot; (epilogue)
* &quot;Captain America&quot; #29–32 (aftermath)
* &quot;Captain America and the Falcon&quot; #5–7 (prologue)
* &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #517–519 (aftermath)
* &quot;Iron Man&quot; #84–85 (prologue) and #86–89 (aftermath)
* &quot;Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #15–20 (prologue)
* &quot;Excalibur&quot; #8 (parallel story)
* &quot;Thor&quot; #80–81 (prologue) and #82–85 (parallel story)

Although not bannered as a part of the crossover, the events of &quot;Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill&quot; are a direct sequel to the story in &quot;Thor&quot;.

==Later references to the storyline==

===&quot;New Avengers Disassembled&quot;===
Although not directly connected with the previous storyline, Bendis&#x27;s 5th arc on &quot;New Avengers&quot; is titled &quot;New Avengers: Disassembled&quot;, a reference to &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot;. It deals with the events of the Civil War (in which superheroes were forced to register with the government or be arrested) on the New Avengers, and how the team&#x27;s varying opinions have caused them to break apart. The first three issues featured Captain America, Jessica Drew and Luke Cage&#x27;s opinions on the matter, all who have heavily weighed against the registration. The next two featured the Sentry and Iron Man, both of whom were for registration. (&quot;New Avengers&quot; #21-25)

===&quot;Avengers: The Initiative Disassembled&quot;===
Like the 5th arc of Bendis&#x27;s &quot;New Avengers&quot;, the storyline of &quot;&quot; also references &quot;Avengers: Disassembled&quot;, complete with a banner reminiscent of the original. Issue No. 21, the first in the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; event, centers on the aftermath of the failed Skrull invasion, and the revelation that the shape-shifting aliens had infiltrated and corrupted the Fifty-State Initiative and Camp Hammond, where the registered heroes were trained. Most disturbingly, Camp Hammond and the were largely under the supervision of the legendary Avenger Henry Pym, but Pym had in fact been replaced by a Skrull years earlier. This is an opportunity for &quot;top cop&quot; Norman Osborn, the newly appointed director of H.A.M.M.E.R. (formerly S.H.I.E.L.D.) to radically redefine how the Initiative will fit into the new order—to his own advantage. Thus, the whole structure (and much of the cast) of &quot;Avengers: The Initiative&quot; is disassembled. (Avengers: The Initiative #21-25)

===&quot;Avengers/New Avengers: End Times&quot;===
Bendis&#x27;s last Avengers and New Avengers storylines used a red smashed Avengers symbol and a black text box with white text in same font as the Disassembled logo on the front covers of each issue of those stories. (Avengers #31-34, New Avengers #31-34)

===&quot;Ultimates Disassembled&quot;===
The 6th story arc of the 4th series of The Ultimate Comics series The Ultimates used the Disassembled name complete with the black box white text logo.

==Other versions==

===&quot;What If?&quot;===
On November 1, 2006, Marvel released a &quot;&quot;What If?&quot; special showing a different outcome to the storyline. In this alternate reality, the Beast, sensing something wrong, investigates afterward. He and Warbird go to see Dr. Strange who claims to have no knowledge of what occurred. Strange uses his abilities to see the event, claiming that is not really him (&quot;Of course there&#x27;s chaos magic...I would never use the Eye that way.&quot;&quot;). They deduce that Wanda used her magics to make everyone believe Strange had defeated her and Magneto then took her away. The Beast eventually figures out that Captain America, his mind suffering long-term damage from his years in ice, had pushed Wanda to do this, using the deaths to power her. They remake Genosha into a mutant paradise and Magneto fights to defend his daughter from the Avengers and the X-Men, who all end up dead as the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s spell is interrupted by Rogue. In the end, Wanda and Cap allow themselves to be taken to oblivion to stop any more harm being done. Only Rogue, Ms. Marvel, Beast, Falcon, Cyclops, Iron Man and Doctor Strange are left – they were the ones who were directly confronting Cap and Wanda – and a guilt-ridden Beast, learning from Uatu that Cap would have recovered from his illness and abandoned his manipulative relationship with the Witch as he became leader of a new team of Avengers if Beast had done nothing, realizes that he should have left everything alone.

===Earth-5012===
In an alternate world, the Avengers were never disassembled, but were subsequently captured by an alien race called the Trellions when the Vision detected the arrival of their agent Titannus, a brainwashed Skrull super-soldier, accompanying him on a mission to rescue his dying lover only to learn that he had been brainwashed with a fake story to lure the Avengers into a trap. The Wasp was quickly killed, Hank Pym - apparently another Hulk in this reality - was announced missing in action, and Captain America was executed to break their spirit, the reserve Avengers taking five years to rescue them and another five to beat back the Trellions sufficiently to stop them trying to re-conquer Earth. At some point, Reed Richards apparently attempted to conquer the world, Iron Man taking on a Doctor-Doom-like apparel to oppose him, killing the Human Torch before Richards sent him to Earth-616 prior to Titannus&#x27;s arrival on that Earth. This Iron Man has since become the villain Iron Maniac, being kept in stasis in a Helicarrier, while the Titannus of Earth-616 was defeated by a team assembled by Doctor Strange when he detected Titannus&#x27;s arrival only after Titannus had destroyed most of Tokyo in a rampage, his violent approach leaving the heroes less inclined to trust him than they had been in this world.

==Parodies==
===&quot;Great Lakes Avengers: Misassembled&quot;===
The &quot;GLA&quot; miniseries, &quot;GLA: Misassembled&quot; (2005), written by Dan Slott and pencilled by Paul Pelletier, provided a tongue-in-cheek reference to &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot;. In a move which satirized the comic book deaths in that book, it was announced that a character would die in each &quot;GLA&quot; issue. Dinah Soar, the newcomer Grasshopper, the squirrel Monkey Joe, and Doorman are all killed, and Mr. Immortal commits suicide. However, Doorman was resurrected almost immediately acquiring the powers of Deathurge, Monkey Joe was replaced with an identical squirrel called Tippy Toe and Mr. Immortal stayed dead for only a few seconds. Three other Grasshoppers appeared in later issues of GLA, and were all killed in the space of few pages, continuing the parody.

===Bongo Comics Free-For-All===
A Bongo Comics Free-For-All (Free Comic Book Day Special) has Comic Book Guy reading, &quot;Archie Disassembled&quot;. The following quotes:
Big Ethel kills Moose to get Jughead&#x27;s attention? Oh, Brian Michael Bendis, you&#x27;ve done it again.

===&quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot; #12===
Deadpool (to Agent X): &quot;Dude, &quot;anyone&quot; wearing a harness rig has a failsafe release to prevent it from catching on fire and forcing you to fly into Kree spaceships and blow up. I mean, &quot;duh&quot;, who &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot; know that?&quot;

<doc id="1033643" wikidata="Q1754018" url="?curid=1033643" title="American Stars 'n Bars">
<text>American Stars &#x27;n Bars is the eighth studio album by Canadian-American folk rock songwriter Neil Young, released on Reprise Records in 1977. Compiled from recording sessions scattered over a 29-month period, it includes &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot;, one of Young&#x27;s best-known songs. It peaked at #21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received a RIAA gold certification.

==Background==
Following the release of his album, &quot;Zuma&quot;, in November 1975, and a subsequent international spring tour with Crazy Horse, Young rekindled his partnership with Stephen Stills. Following the album &quot;Long May You Run&quot;, and a promotional tour that Young abandoned, he continued touring with Crazy Horse in the United States, then spent the first half of 1977 off the road. After recording several country rock compositions at sessions in April 1977, he assembled additional tracks from a variety of earlier recording dates to make up the second side of the new album.

&quot;Homegrown&quot; and &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot; had initially been slated for his album &quot;Homegrown&quot;, which was shelved at the time. Both of those songs, along with &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot;, &quot;Hold Back the Tears&quot; and &quot;Will to Love&quot;, had also been slated for the unreleased Young album project, &quot;Chrome Dreams&quot;. Seven of the nine tracks feature his regular backing band Crazy Horse, and another, &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot;, features country music star Emmylou Harris. Songs from the April 1977 sessions are all in a country-styled vein, while the tracks from the second side are all in their original forms from their respective recording sessions (spanning 1974–1976).

==Writing==
&quot;The Old Country Waltz&quot; tells the tale of listening to a live band in a bar while drinking to get over the loss of a loved one. It was previously recorded on piano and harmonica in August 1976 during the &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; session.

&quot;Saddle Up the Palomino&quot; features sexually suggestive lyrics and was likely written in 1974 or 1975 during the &quot;Homegrown&quot; sessions. A handwritten song list on the Neil Young Archives website from that era includes a song titled &quot;Carmelina&quot;. It is credited to Young, bassist Tim Drummond and Louisiana songwriter and friend Bobby Charles who was part of Young&#x27;s social scene in Malibu in 1975.

&quot;Hold Back the Tears&quot; had previously been recorded in February 1977 as a solo performance with Young playing guitar, keyboards and percussion. This version would see release on &quot;Chrome Dreams&quot; in 2023. Its lyrics find Young consoling a friend over the loss of a relationship and counseling that the next love may be just around the corner.

&quot;Bite the Bullet&quot;, which also features suggestive lyrics, combines the emerging genres of outlaw country and punk rock. It was written in July 1976 in Charlotte, North Carolina during the Stills-Young tour, and made its live debut that month.

&quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot;&#x27;s lyrics are about coming to terms with the end of a relationship. The song was originally intended to conclude the shelved album &quot;Homegrown&quot;. Its lyrics are inspired by Young&#x27;s breakup with Carrie Snodgress. Young would debut the song on tour with CSNY with an additional verse. In a 1975 Cameron Crowe interview for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Young indicated a fondness for the track and an eagerness to release it, singling out the &quot;beautiful harmonies&quot; of Emmylou Harris.

In &quot;Will to Love&quot;, Young tells &quot;the story of a salmon swimming upstream. Laden with my own feelings of love and survival.&quot; Young has performed the song only once, the night he recorded at his home in front of a roaring fire. &quot;Homegrown&quot;, a lighthearted tribute to marijuana, was first recorded as the title track of the unreleased album.

&quot;Like a Hurricane&quot;, one of Young&#x27;s signature songs, recounts a tempestuous romance, as Young described in a 2020 post to his website: &quot;She had so much love he couldn&#x27;t handle it. She was always a step away but he loved her forever. He just couldn&#x27;t reach her. But he did, and she never forgot that.&quot; In a September 1982 interview, Young said: &quot;I wrote it on an organ, on the string synthesizer. I remember the night I wrote it, I stayed up all night playing it after I wrote it. It always had a feeling to me that it was going to take off. It was never going to be a peaceful little song.&quot; In his memoir &quot;Special Deluxe&quot;, Young recalls bar hopping on Skyline Boulevard: 

==Recording==
Side two of the album consists of recordings made in various studios over the previous two years.

&quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot; was recorded in December, 1974 at Quadrafonic Sound Studios during sessions for &quot;Homegrown&quot;. According to a post on the Neil Young Archives website, Ben Keith and Emmylou Harris would overdub the background vocals for the track at Harris&#x27; L.A. home.

&quot;Homegrown&quot; and &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot; were recorded in November 1975 with Crazy Horse at Young&#x27;s ranch during rehearsals for a short tour of Northern California, his first with the reconstituted band with guitarist Poncho Sampedro. The group recorded &quot;Hurricane&quot; at Young&#x27;s ranch shortly after Young wrote the song and the take on the album is the initial run-through. Young wrote in &quot;Waging Heavy Peace&quot;: 
Young had recently undergone vocal surgery and was unable to record a live vocal. Vocals were overdubbed in January 1976 at Village Recorders in Los Angeles. He explained in &quot;Special Deluxe&quot;: 

&quot;Will to Love&quot; was recorded in April 1976, at Young&#x27;s home in front of a roaring fire, the only time he has performed the song. He would later mix the recording and add overdubs during a full moon session at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, as recounted in &quot;Waging Heavy Peace&quot;: &quot;Sitting on the floor late at night, I recorded in front of the fireplace with the cassette on the hearth, three feet from the fire, and you can hear the crackling and hissing of the fire as I played my old Martin guitar and sang.&quot; Young mixed the track and added overdubs at Indigo Ranch Recording studio eight months later with his producer David Briggs: &quot;I had asked David to get me a lot of instruments, including drums, an electric bass, a vibraphone, some of my old amps including my Magnatone with the stereo vibrato, and a few other things. I told David that I simply wanted to play back the cassette through the Magnatone with vibrato so it would sound like I was underwater at times during the song, when I was taking the point of view of the salmon.&quot;

Finally, Young and Briggs mixed the song that same night, and played back the results to Young&#x27;s great satisfaction: &quot;Somewhere in the middle of that night, we did a mix. That was the perfect way to work. Get it all at once... The sound was cascading over me and all around me, and I was swimming in it. Our work was done. That memory is one of my favorite moments and is the perfect example of a great life with my friend David, who guided me and assisted me in every trip I decided to take through the world of music.&quot;

The songs on side one were recorded in a single day at Young&#x27;s ranch on April 4, 1977. The April 1977 sessions featured Crazy Horse augmented by an ad hoc grouping dubbed &quot;The Bullets&quot;: pedal steel guitarist and longtime Young collaborator Ben Keith, violinist Carole Mayedo, and backing vocalists Linda Ronstadt and Nicolette Larson. Young had previously recorded with Ronstadt on &quot;Harvest&quot;. Young recruited Larson after reaching out to other singers and several had recommended her. The three met at Young&#x27;s Malibu home where he introduced the two singers to twenty of his songs he had available to record. Larson tells Cameron Crowe in December 1978: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know much about Neil Young, but we went over and sat by the fireplace and Neil ran down all the songs he had just written, about twenty of them. We sang harmonies with him and he was jazzed.&quot; Sessions were held at the white house on Young&#x27;s ranch. The musicians were under the impression that they were rehearsing while the takes used on the album were being recorded. Recalls Larson: &quot;We worked out the songs in a room of his house. And just when we had the songs down, Neil said, &#x27;Thanks a lot...we&#x27;ve got the album.&#x27; He was recording all the rehearsals secretly in another room.&quot;

==Album cover==
The album cover was designed by actor and Young&#x27;s close friend Dean Stockwell, who had also written the screenplay that inspired &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;. It features Connie Moskos, then the girlfriend of producer David Briggs, drooping with a bottle of Canadian whisky in her hand and an intoxicated Young with his face pressed against the glass floor.

==Release==
&quot;American Stars &#x27;n&#x27; Bars&quot; was released May 1977. It was released after the compilation &quot;Decade&quot; had already been compiled. Young and producer David Briggs decided that the compilation should be delayed so that &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot; could appear on its own album, not just on a three-record set. Briggs and Young called manager Elliot Roberts to adjust the release dates with the record company accordingly. Briggs would relate the decision in a contemporary radio interview: 

==Reception==

The album receiving favorable reviews. Writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Paul Nelson noted the mixed selection of songs and styles and praised the &quot;gale-force guitar playing&quot; on &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot;. He concluded that the album &quot;can almost be taken as a sampler, but not a summation, of Young&#x27;s various styles from &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; and &quot;Harvest&quot; (much of the country rock) through &quot;On the Beach&quot; (the incredible &quot;Will to Love&quot;) to &quot;Zuma&quot; (&quot;Like a Hurricane&quot; is a worthy successor to &quot;Cortez the Killer&quot; as a guitar showcase) with a lot of overlap within the songs&quot;. In a review for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann found the album to be &quot;a stylistic hodgepodge, its first side consisting of country-tinged material&quot; while the second side ranged from &quot;acoustic solo numbers... to raging rockers&quot;. Describing &quot;Will to Love&quot; as &quot;a particularly spooky and ambitious piece&quot;, he said that &quot;[the] album&#x27;s centerpiece however, is &quot;Like a Hurricane,&quot; one of Young&#x27;s classic hard rock songs and guitar workouts, and a perpetual concert favorite&quot;.

It was finally released on compact disc, as an HDCD, on August 19, 2003, as part of the Neil Young Digital Masterpiece Series along with &quot;On the Beach&quot;, &quot;Hawks &amp; Doves&quot;, and &quot;Re-ac-tor&quot;.

<text>Magdelín Martínez Castillo (; born February 10, 1976, in Camagüey, Cuba) is a Cuban-born female triple jumper, competing internationally for Italy.

==Biography==
She originally represented Cuba. She won the bronze medal at the 1999 Pan American Games. She jumped 14.27 metres in 1998 and 14.40 metres in 2000.

She met future husband, Giuseppe Piccotti, while he was holidaying in the Caribbean. When he fell ill, she was quick to supply him with medicine, and it all went from there. After moving to Italy she wanted to take up jumping again but even though she was jumping personal bests she felt a little closed off from her colleagues, and accepted with good spirits that she would have to become an Italian. She naturalised in July 2001 and competed for Italy at the 2001 World Championships in Edmonton. She finished fourth, having set a personal best of 14.59 metres in the qualification.

The next year she finished sixth at the 2002 European Championships. In 2003, she finished fifth at the 2003 World Indoor Championships before winning the bronze medal at the 2003 World Championships. At the end of the season she finished fifth at the first World Athletics Final. In 2004, she finished fifth at the World Indoor Championships, seventh at the Olympic Games and fifth at the World Athletics Final. She also jumped two career bests: 15.03 in the triple jump in the Rome Golden Gala, and 6.67 in long jump in Rieti. In 2005, she won the silver medal at the European Indoor Championships, finished eighth at the World Championships and seventh at the World Athletics Final.

2006 was a mediocre year. Her season&#x27;s best was 14.25 metres, down from 15.03 in 2004 and 14.69 in 2005. She competed at the 2006 European Championships, but did not reach the final. However, she made a small comeback in 2007 to finish seventh at the 2007 World Championships. Her season&#x27;s best jump was 14.71 metres. The next year she competed at the 2008 Olympic Games without reaching the final.

<doc id="1033647" wikidata="Q718900" url="?curid=1033647" title="Henrik Larsen">
<text>Henrik Larsen (born 17 May 1966), nicknamed &quot;Store Larsen&quot; (&quot;Big Larsen&quot;), is a Danish football manager and former professional player, who played as a midfielder. He was last the manager of Lyngby Boldklub.

He was the joint top scorer at the UEFA Euro 1992 which he won with the Denmark national team. He was also part of the Danish squad at Euro 96 where he played his last national team game. In all, he played 39 national team matches and scored five goals.

== Club career ==
Larsen was born in Lyngby. He started his career in Denmark for Taarbæk IF and then later Lyngby Boldklub. He won the 1985 Danish Cup trophy with Lyngby, and made his Danish national team debut in February 1989. In April 1990, he agreed a move abroad to play for Italian club Pisa Calcio, who were leading the promotion battle in the secondary Serie B division. Larsen was named Man of the Match, as he won the 1990 Danish Cup with Lyngby, before moving to Italy in June 1990. He joined Pisa in the Serie A championship, but in his first year at the club, Pisa were relegated to the Serie B again. As Serie B regulations only allowed two foreign players in the team, Larsen had to look for playing time elsewhere, when the club preferred Argentinians Diego Simeone and Jose Chamot.

After the Euro 92 tournament, Larsen moved back to Pisa in the Serie B. Simeone had been sold, but following the first few league games for the club, Larsen was put on sale. A number of European clubs were interested in him, but Pisa&#x27;s pricetag of DKK 50 million kept all interest at bay. Larsen eventually moved to Aston Villa FC in England on a loan deal in January 1993. His stay in Aston Villa was short, as he had trouble forcing his way into the team under manager Ron Atkinson. In March 1993, he was told by Atkinson he wasn&#x27;t needed, but as Pisa didn&#x27;t want him back, he stayed at Villa&#x27;s reserve team until May 1993.

He was loaned out to German club Waldhof Mannheim in the 2. Bundesliga in 1993, where he played well. He returned to Denmark in 1994, to play for Lyngby on a season-long loan deal. Larsen was set free from his Pisa contract in February 1995, when his transfer rights were given to Lyngby. He was called up for the Danish squad for Euro 96, by national manager Møller Nielsen. He took part in all Denmark&#x27;s three matches, before ending his national team career when Denmark were eliminated. After Euro 96, he moved to league rivals FC Copenhagen, with whom he won the 1997 Danish Cup. He ended his career in 1999.

== International career ==
Larsen went on a season-long loan deal back in Lyngby, where he helped the club win the 1992 Danish Superliga championship. He was selected for the Danish team to compete at the Euro 92 tournament. He started the tournament as a substitute, but Larsen went on to score three goals at Euro 92, including both goals in the 2–2 semi-final draw against the Netherlands. He scored at his attempt in the ensuing penalty shootout, and played full-time when he and the Danish national team won the final against Germany.

== Coaching career ==
Following his retirement, he became assistant coach at FC Copenhagen, before managing Ølstykke FC. He was head coach of the Faroe Islands national team until 2005, as well as associated coach of the talent team in Lyngby Boldklub, for whose old boys team he is also playing. In 2006, he was caretaker manager in Holbæk B&amp;I, before signing on with Køge Boldklub in June 2006 and was here coach until June 2008. Larsen was named as the new head coach from Lyngby Boldklub on 15 July 2008 and was then fired after eight months on 30 March 2009. He was the new assistant manager at the Danish football club Randers FC, when the season 2009–10 started, together with another Danish football legend Flemming Povlsen. They were both assistant managers for the Randers FC manager John Faxe Jensen but the trio was fired on 6 October 2009.

==Personal life==
In 1998, he announced he was marrying an English sports reporter, Sacha Crowther, whom he had met at the UEFA European Championship two years earlier.

<doc id="1033651" wikidata="Q5970602" url="?curid=1033651" title="IE Domain Registry">
<text>The .IE is the domain name registry for the .ie country code top-level domain. Their work includes protecting, supporting and promoting the web presence of all .ie domain names. They administer and manage the .ie namespace in the public interest.

Founded in 1991, they spun out of UCD and became a private company in July 2000. While still operating as an independent private company, they liaise with government departments, governing bodies, trade associations as required and abide by internet best practice principles. They have no shareholders and are owned by the directors. Being limited by guarantee is a common structure for global domain registries. Surpluses are added to opening reserves. Directors don’t have a beneficial interest in the reserves of the company.

They operate on a not-for-profit basis and are a member of the Council of European National Top-Level Domain Registries (CENTR). They are also a member of the Internet Neutral Exchange and of the RIPE NCC.

The IE Domain Registry operates a managed registry model for Ireland&#x27;s national .ie domain. This means that every application for a .ie domain name is checked to make sure that the applicant has a real connection with Ireland. Applicants can provide just one document to prove identity and connection to Ireland. Information on supporting documentation is outlined here.

The .ie ccTLD has a &quot;Registry – Registrar&quot; model. Becoming a .ie Registrar requires that the applicant has over 200 registered .ie domains or is at least the billing contact on over 200 .ie domains, provides a 2,500 Euro bond, passes a credit check and has a demonstrable knowledge of IE Domain Registry domain naming policies and technical procedures.

In 2004, The Commission for Communications Regulation (Comreg) was to take over the regulation and control of Ireland&#x27;s domain name .ie.The legislation covering this change was signed into law in 2007. In effect, the move has ComReg regulating while IE Domain Registry continues to run the .ie ccTLD.

In March 2006, IE Domain Registry, the company leading the IENUM consortium, won the competition to provide a commercial registry for the supply of ENUM (Electronic Numbering) services in Ireland. The IE Domain Registry&#x27;s partner in the IENUM consortium is Internet Privatstiftung Austria (IPA), the Austrian organisation which operates the .at domain name and provided the first ENUM commercial registry service in the world.

In 2014, the Policy Advisory Committee (PAC) was set up by the Board of IE Domain Registry. The PAC was set up to provide advice on policy issues concerning Ireland’s Internet top-level domain, .ie. The PAC makes formal recommendations to the Board for approval.

The PAC follow a 10-step framework known as the .ie Policy Development Process (PDP). The PDP is designed to be bottom-up and consensus-driven. This means that anyone can suggest a policy change and if there is agreement amongst stakeholders, the policy change can be implemented. Further information on the PDP can be found here.

The PAC has supported the below policy change requests:-

The Terms of Reference for the Policy Advisory Committee (PAC), including the PAC membership of eligible organisations, can be found here:

·       Terms of Reference

·       Members of the PAC

The PAC has held four public consultations to gather the opinions of the wider Irish internet community and to ensure that these are taken into consideration during the policy development process. The PAC has also held four additional consultations with other stakeholders deemed to be most impacted by policy change requests to ensure their input is considered.

IE Domain Registry has modernised the registration process over the last number of years. Registering a .ie domain is now more automated with .ie registrations typically going live within an hour or less during weekdays. A web interface for .ie Registrars and an API which enables them to integrate .ie registration procedures with their systems are partially responsible for the more efficient registration process.

The rules for registering .ie domain names were changed on 21 March 2018. This change removed the need to explain why an applicant wants a particular name (also called ‘claim to the name’) when registering a .ie domain name. This made the registration process easier and faster.

Previously, an applicant registering a .ie domain had to prove they had a valid claim to the desired domain and a real, tangible connection to the island of Ireland. Those registering a .ie domain still have to prove their connection to Ireland but no longer need to explain their claim to a name.

IE Domain Registry acted as a ‘Registrar of last resort’ for individuals and companies who for whatever reason, chose not to deal directly with a Registrar. On 31 March 2020, the direct registration service was terminated. On this date, all direct customers were transferred to an accredited .ie Registrar, 101 Domain. 101 Domain was selected after a transparent tender and independently managed auction process.

The drivers for this decision included the declining size of the direct portfolio, the fact that it is common practice in the ccTLD sector - registries are selling/exiting (incl. Finland, Sweden &amp; UK), and IE Domain Registry could not grow the direct portfolio, given its self-imposed restrictions on marketing/promotion motivated by the need to avoid even the perception of competition with Registrars.

In the context of requiring Directs to transfer, IE Domain Registry was satisfied that there would be no adverse issues arising or risks regarding consumer choice, efficient markets and intensity of competition:-

·      There are over ~130 accredited. ie Registrars, providing a range of services, with bundled options and at differing price points.

·      There is a mix of national and international Registrars, and many are ICANN accredited

·      Efficient market exits – with strong, ethical, professional Registrars

·      A ‘Registrar of last resort service’ is not needed in Ireland

==ComReg Takes Over IEDR Policy Functions==
Under the Communication Regulations (Amendment) Bill 2007, the Communications Regulator (ComReg) has taken over most of the policy functions of IEDR. The legislation was passed by the Oireachtas and came into force on 15 May 2007 with the signing of the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2007 (Commencement) Order, 2007 – (S.I. No. 224 of 2007).

According to the Regulatory Impact Analysis, the legislation puts in place legal instruments for the regulation of the private sector company (IEDR) which is currently administrating .ie ccTLD. This move to protect the .ie ccTLD and provide the mechanisms to transfer the administration of .ie ccTLD away from IEDR if required makes this legislation very powerful and effectively changes IEDR to being a service company from its previous position of making policy and administrating the .ie ccTLD.

The legislation gives ComReg complete power over .ie ccTLD policy decisions: designating the authority to register .ie domains; setting renewal periods and conditions; revoking registrations, registration conditions; pricing of .ie domains and appeals against revocation of registrations. IEDR, however, still provides the day-to-day administration of .ie ccTLD.

<doc id="1033659" wikidata="Q458625" url="?curid=1033659" title="Alex Kapranos">
<text>Alexander Paul Kapranos (born 20 March 1972) is a Scottish musician. He is the lead singer and lead guitarist of Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand. He has also been a part of the supergroups FFS and BNQT.

==Early life==
Alexander Paul Kapranos Huntley was born on 20 March 1972 in Almondsbury, South Gloucestershire, the son of an English mother and Greek father. As a two-month-old he moved to Sunderland, moving to Scotland when he was 7. He attended Bearsden Academy, then the University of Aberdeen to study Theology. After dropping out, he continued studying at the University of Strathclyde, gaining a BA. In 2005, he was awarded Strathclyde&#x27;s Alumnus of the Year.

Kapranos worked as a chef, barman, waiter and delivery driver prior to his success in music. From the early 1990s, he was a fixture of the Glasgow music scene, running live nights at The 13th Note Café, most notably The Kazoo Club.

==Career==
===Performing===
While working at the Glasgow&#x27;s Anniesland College in late 90&#x27;s, Alex Kapranos played in some of city&#x27;s bands, including The Blisters (later known as The Karelia), The Amphetameanies and The Yummy Fur. He also contributed to the noise rock band Urusei Yatsura and Lung Leg recordings.
After dropping &quot;Huntley&quot; from his name, Kapranos formed Franz Ferdinand in 2001. The band was composed of Kapranos, Nick McCarthy (rhythm guitar, keyboards, vocals), Paul Thomson (drums, backing vocals) and Bob Hardy (bass). The band saw chart success after their second single &quot;Take Me Out&quot; was released on 12 January 2004 and reached Number 3 in the UK Charts followed by their debut album &quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot; (released 9 February 2004), which debuted on the UK album chart at Number 3.

The band went on to win the 2004 Mercury Music Prize and two Brit Awards in 2005 for Best British Group and Best British Rock Act.

In 2015, the Franz Ferdinand collaborated with American band Sparks to form a supergroup named FFS.

Also in 2015 Kapranos joined the supergroup BNQT.

In 2019 British band All We Are released a single &quot;Heart Attack&quot; with Alex Kapranos.

In 2020 Kapranos released an English-French cover of &quot;Summer Wine&quot; with Clara Luciani.

===Producing===
Kapranos produced &quot;Men&#x27;s Needs, Women&#x27;s Needs, Whatever&quot;—the third album by British indie rock group The Cribs in Vancouver, B.C., released on 14 May 2007. He also produced their single-only track &quot;Don&#x27;t You Wanna Be Relevant?&quot;, which was featured with &quot;Our Bovine Public&quot; (from &quot;Men&#x27;s Needs, Women&#x27;s Needs, Whatever&quot;) as a double A-side.

Kapranos makes a cameo appearance in the video for &quot;Our Bovine Public&quot;.

His remix of the single &quot;New in Town&quot; by British pop singer Little Boots was featured on various formats of the singles release.

He produced the debut album by British indie rock band Citizens!, &quot;Here We Are&quot;, which was released by Kitsuné on 28 May 2012.

He produced the second album of Scottish guitarist RM Hubbert, &quot;Thirteen Lost &amp; Found&quot;.
In 2019, he produced the single &quot;Pista (Great Start)&quot; by London-based band Los Bitchos, which he described thus: &quot;Truly international with cumbia beats, Turkish psychedelia, a hint of Swedish pop and a touch of shoegaze shimmer. More than anything, they put you in a really good mood when you listen to them. Celebratory trills and whoops energise the vibrant Dick Dale-esque guitars and brass, making for a blistering escape to a rip-roaring desert session.&quot;

==Other work==
===Writing===
In September 2005, Kapranos began &quot;Soundbites&quot;, a weekly food column for G2 in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, which detailed his culinary adventures as Franz Ferdinand traversed the globe on their world tour. &quot;Sound Bites: Eating on Tour with Franz Ferdinand&quot;, a book of the column and unreleased material illustrated by Andy Knowles, was released in 2006.

&quot;Sound Bites: Eating on Tour with Franz Ferdinand&quot; was read by Kapranos on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Week&quot; for 4–8 December 2006, described as &quot;his account about what he ate while touring the world.&quot;

===Narration===
Kapranos narrated the 2008 BBC Scotland documentary &quot;Edwyn Collins: Home Again&quot; on the recovery of Orange Juice singer Edwyn Collins.

Also in 2008, Kapranos narrated the BBC Radio 1 documentary &quot;The Story of Kraftwerk&quot;.

===Film===
In 2016, Kapranos took part in a documentary about Glasgow music, and Chemikal Underground Records, called &quot;Lost in France&quot;. The film was directed by Niall McCann and brought Kapranos (along with members of The Delgados, Mogwai and others) to Mauron, Brittany, to recreate a gig they played when Kapranos was in his earlier band, The Karelia. The film features Kapranos playing live with Stuart Braithwaite of Mogwai, and other musicians such as Emma Pollock and RM Hubbert, and Holy Mountain, as well as interviews with Kapranos and his old label-mates. &quot;Lost in France&quot; premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival to wholly positive reviews and was called &quot;Funny, vital and sobering&quot; by Scotland&#x27;s arts publication, &quot;The Skinny&quot;.

Kapranos was interviewed for Edgar Wright&#x27;s 2021 documentary film &quot;The Sparks Brothers&quot;, centered around the band Sparks, with whom Franz Ferdinand formed supergroup FFS.

===Radio presenting===
From 7 August to 11 September 2022, Kapranos presented a six part Sunday night radio programme titled &quot;The Alex Kapranos Show&quot; on Absolute Radio.

==Personal life==
In his spare time, Kapranos enjoys &quot;crafting abstract furniture in his carpentry workshop&quot; .

In June 2005, Kapranos was detained for around an hour by officials at Domodedovo Airport in Moscow after being mistakenly identified as belonging on a U.S. &quot;no-fly&quot; list. This occurred due to the surname on his passport, Huntley, also having been previously used as an alias by the former MI6 agent Richard Tomlinson. Tomlinson had been fired, imprisoned, and labelled a security risk after circulating to publishers a draft of a book on MI6. Kapranos was released after officials determined that he did not fit Tomlinson&#x27;s description.

Growing up in Sunderland, he supported the local football club Sunderland A.F.C.

Kapranos has asthma and is allergic to peanuts.

Kapranos dated singer Eleanor Friedberger for a few years (he dedicated the song &quot;Eleanor Put Your Boots On&quot; to her).

Since 2019, he has been in a relationship with French musician Clara Luciani. Luciani announced her pregnancy with the couple&#x27;s first child in May 2023.
They married in Scotland at the end of May 2023. Their son was born in September 2023.

<text>Malta was ruled by the Order of Saint John as a vassal state of the Kingdom of Sicily from 1530 to 1798. The islands of Malta and Gozo, as well as the city of Tripoli in modern Libya, were granted to the order by Spanish Emperor Charles V in 1530, following the loss of Rhodes. The Ottoman Empire managed to capture Tripoli from the Order in 1551, but an attempt to take Malta in 1565 failed.

The Maltese navy was small but competent and was constantly involved in naval warfare since its inception. Their greatest achievement came during the Great Siege of Malta of 1565. Their independence (and fleet) lasted until 12 June 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte, during his campaign against the Ottoman Empire, captured Malta with little bloodshed, along with the entire remaining Maltese navy. All remaining Maltese ships were added to the French Navy. Some of these ships were later captured by the Royal Navy when they recaptured Malta in 1800, bringing an end to the history of the Maltese navy.

<text>In stable homotopy theory, a branch of mathematics, Morava K-theory is one of a collection of cohomology theories introduced in algebraic topology by Jack Morava in unpublished preprints in the early 1970s. For every prime number &quot;p&quot; (which is suppressed in the notation), it consists of theories &quot;K&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) for each nonnegative integer &quot;n&quot;, each a ring spectrum in the sense of homotopy theory. published the first account of the theories.

==Details==

The theory &quot;K&quot;(0) agrees with singular homology with rational coefficients, whereas &quot;K&quot;(1) is a summand of mod-&quot;p&quot; complex K-theory. The theory &quot;K&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) has coefficient ring

:F&quot;p&quot;[&quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1]

where &quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot; has degree 2(&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1). In particular, Morava K-theory is periodic with this period, in much the same way that complex K-theory has period 2.

These theories have several remarkable properties.
* They have Künneth isomorphisms for arbitrary pairs of spaces: that is, for &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; CW complexes, we have
:formula_1
* They are &quot;fields&quot; in the category of ring spectra. In other words every module spectrum over &quot;K&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is free, i.e. a wedge of suspensions of &quot;K&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).
* They are complex oriented (at least after being periodified by taking the wedge sum of (&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1) shifted copies), and the formal group they define has height &quot;n&quot;.
* Every finite &quot;p&quot;-local spectrum &quot;X&quot; has the property that &quot;K&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)∗(&quot;X&quot;) = 0 if and only if &quot;n&quot; is less than a certain number &quot;N&quot;, called the type of the spectrum &quot;X&quot;. By a theorem of Devinatz–Hopkins–Smith, every thick subcategory of the category of finite &quot;p&quot;-local spectra is the subcategory of type-&quot;n&quot; spectra for some &quot;n&quot;.

<doc id="1033666" wikidata="Q5156571" url="?curid=1033666" title="Complex cobordism">
<text>In mathematics, complex cobordism is a generalized cohomology theory related to cobordism of manifolds. Its spectrum is denoted by MU. It is an exceptionally powerful cohomology theory, but can be quite hard to compute, so often instead of using it directly one uses some slightly weaker theories derived from it, such as Brown–Peterson cohomology or Morava K-theory, that are easier to compute.

The generalized homology and cohomology complex cobordism theories were introduced by using the Thom spectrum.

==Spectrum of complex cobordism==

The complex bordism formula_1 of a space formula_2 is roughly the group of bordism classes of manifolds over formula_2 with a complex linear structure on the stable normal bundle. Complex bordism is a generalized homology theory, corresponding to a spectrum MU that can be described explicitly in terms of Thom spaces as follows.

The space formula_4 is the Thom space of the universal formula_5-plane bundle over the classifying space formula_6 of the unitary group formula_7. The natural inclusion from formula_7 into formula_9 induces a map from the double suspension formula_10 to formula_11. Together these maps give the spectrum formula_12; namely, it is the homotopy colimit of formula_4.

Examples: formula_14 is the sphere spectrum. formula_15 is the desuspension formula_16 of formula_17.

The nilpotence theorem states that, for any ring spectrum formula_18, the kernel of formula_19 consists of nilpotent elements. The theorem implies in particular that, if formula_20 is the sphere spectrum, then for any formula_21, every element of formula_22 is nilpotent (a theorem of Goro Nishida). (Proof: if formula_23 is in formula_24, then formula_23 is a torsion but its image in formula_26, the Lazard ring, cannot be torsion since formula_27 is a polynomial ring. Thus, formula_23 must be in the kernel.)

==Formal group laws==
 and showed that the coefficient ring formula_29 (equal to the complex cobordism of a point, or equivalently the ring of cobordism classes of stably complex manifolds) is a polynomial ring formula_30 on infinitely many generators formula_31 of positive even degrees.

Write formula_32 for infinite dimensional complex projective space, which is the classifying space for complex line bundles, so that tensor product of line bundles induces a map formula_33 A complex orientation on an associative commutative ring spectrum &quot;E&quot; is an element &quot;x&quot; in formula_34 whose restriction to formula_35 
is 1, if the latter ring is identified with the coefficient ring of &quot;E&quot;. A spectrum &quot;E&quot; with such an element &quot;x&quot; is called a complex oriented ring spectrum.

If &quot;E&quot; is a complex oriented ring spectrum, then

:formula_36

:formula_37

and formula_38 is a formal group law over the ring formula_39.

Complex cobordism has a natural complex orientation. showed that there is a natural isomorphism from its coefficient ring to Lazard&#x27;s universal ring, making the formal group law of complex cobordism into the universal formal group law. In other words, for any formal group law &quot;F&quot; over any commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, there is a unique ring homomorphism from MU*(point) to &quot;R&quot; such that &quot;F&quot; is the pullback of the formal group law of complex cobordism.

==Brown–Peterson cohomology==
Complex cobordism over the rationals can be reduced to ordinary cohomology over the rationals, so the main interest is in the torsion of complex cobordism. It is often easier to study the torsion one prime at a time by localizing MU at a prime &quot;p&quot;; roughly speaking this means one kills off torsion prime to &quot;p&quot;. The localization MU&quot;p&quot; of MU at a prime &quot;p&quot; splits as a sum of suspensions of a simpler cohomology theory called Brown–Peterson cohomology, first described by . In practice one often does calculations with Brown–Peterson cohomology rather than with complex cobordism. Knowledge of the Brown–Peterson cohomologies of a space for all primes &quot;p&quot; is roughly equivalent to knowledge of its complex cobordism.

==Conner–Floyd classes==

The ring formula_40 is isomorphic to the formal power series ring formula_41 where the elements cf are called Conner–Floyd classes. They are the analogues of Chern classes for complex cobordism. They were introduced by .

Similarly formula_42 is isomorphic to the polynomial ring formula_43

==Cohomology operations==

The Hopf algebra MU*(MU) is isomorphic to the polynomial algebra R[b1, b2, ...], where R is the reduced bordism ring of a 0-sphere.

The coproduct is given by

:formula_44

where the notation ()2&quot;i&quot; means take the piece of degree 2&quot;i&quot;. This can be interpreted as follows. The map

:formula_45

is a continuous automorphism of the ring of formal power series in &quot;x&quot;, and the coproduct of MU*(MU) gives the composition of two such automorphisms.

<doc id="1033672" wikidata="Q223807" url="?curid=1033672" title="Nail polish">
<text>Nail polish (also known as nail varnish in British English or nail enamel) is a lacquer that can be applied to the human fingernails or toenails to decorate and protect the nail plates. The formula has been revised repeatedly to enhance its decorative properties, to be safer for the consumer to use, and to suppress cracking or peeling. Nail polish consists of a mix of an organic polymer and several other components that give it colors and textures. Nail polishes come in all color shades and play a significant part in manicures and pedicures.

== History ==
Nail polish originated in China and dates back to 3000 BCE. Around 600 BCE, during the Zhou dynasty, the royal house preferred the colors gold and silver. However, red and black eventually replaced these metallic colors as royal favorites. During the Ming dynasty, nail polish was often made from a mixture that included beeswax, egg whites, gelatin, vegetable dyes, and gum arabic.

In Egypt, the lower classes wore pale colors of nail polish, whereas high society painted their nails a reddish brown with henna. Mummified pharaohs also had their nails painted with henna.

In Europe, Frederick S. N. Douglas, while traveling in Greece in 1810–1812, noticed that the Greek women used to paint their nails &quot;dingy pink&quot;, which he understood as an ancient custom. 
Early nail polish formulas were created using basic ingredients such as lavender oil, carmine, oxide tin, and bergamot oil. It was more common to polish nails with tinted powders and creams, finishing off by buffing the nail until left shiny. One type of polishing product sold around this time was Graf&#x27;s Hyglo nail polish paste.

In Victorian era culture it was generally considered improper for women to adorn themselves with either makeup or nail coloring, since natural appearances were considered more chaste and pure. In the 1920s, however, women began to wear color in new makeups and nail products, partly in rebellion to such prim customs of their recent past. In 1920s France, a big pioneer of nail polish was the hairstylist Antoine de Paris, whose cosmetic company produced some of the first modern polishes, and he himself shocked the newspapers by wearing each nail painted a different color.

Since the 1920s, nail colors progressed from French manicures and standard reds to various palettes of color choices, usually coordinated with the fashion industry&#x27;s clothing colors for the season. By the 1940s the whole nail was painted; before that, it was fashionable to leave the tips and a half-moon on the nail bed bare.

== Ingredients ==
Modern nail polish consists predominately of a film-forming polymer dissolved in a volatile organic solvent. The most common polymer is nitrocellulose, although the more expensive cellulose acetates such as CAB are claimed to give better performance. In gel nail varnish, the polymer is usually some sort of acrylate copolymer. The solvents are commonly butyl acetate or ethyl acetate. Low levels of various additives are included to give the desired finish:
:*Plasticizers to yield non-brittle films. diethylphthalate, dibutylphthalate and camphor are typical.
:*Dyes and pigments. Representative compounds include chromium oxide greens, chromium hydroxide, ferric ferrocyanide, stannic oxide, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, carmine, ultramarine, and manganese violet.
:*Opalescent pigments. The glittery/shimmer look in the color can be conferred by mica, bismuth oxychloride, natural pearls, and aluminum powder.
:*Adhesive polymers ensure that the nitrocellulose adheres to the nail&#x27;s surface. One modifier used is tosylamide/formaldehyde resin.
:*Thickening agents are added to maintain the sparkling particles in suspension while in the bottle. A typical thickener is stearalkonium hectorite. Thickening agents exhibit thixotropy, their solutions are viscous when still but free-flowing when agitated. This duality is convenient for easily applying the freshly shaken mixture to give a film that quickly rigidifies.
:*Ultraviolet stabilizers resist color changes when the dry film is exposed to sunlight. A typical stabilizer is benzophenone-1.

== Types ==

=== Base coat ===

This type of nail polish is a clear, milky-colored, or opaque pink polish formula that is used specifically before applying nail polish to the nail. Its function is to strengthen nails, restore moisture to the nail, and help polish adhere to the nail. It prevents staining and extends the lifespan of the manicure. Some base coats are marketed as &quot;ridge fillers&quot;, and can create a smooth surface, de-emphasizing the ridges that can appear on unbuffed nails. Some base coats, called &quot;peel off base coats&quot;, allow the user to peel off their nail polish without using a remover.

=== Top coat ===
This type of nail polish is a clear colored polish formula that is used specifically after applying nail polish to the nail. It forms a hardened barrier for the nail that can prevent chipping, scratching and peeling. Many topcoats are marketed as &quot;quick-drying.&quot; Topcoats can help the underlying colored polish dry quickly as well. It gives the polish a more finished and desired look and may help to keep the polish on longer and keeps the nails looking fresh.

=== Gel ===
Gel polish is a long-lasting variety of nail polish made up of a type of methacrylate polymer. It is painted on the nail similar to traditional nail polish, but does not dry. Instead it is cured under an ultraviolet lamp or ultraviolet LED. While regular nail polish formulas typically last two to seven days without chipping, gel polish can last as long as two weeks with proper application and home care. Gel polish can be more difficult to remove than regular nail polish. It is usually removed by soaking the nails in pure acetone (the solvent used in most nail polish removers) for five to fifteen minutes, depending on the formula.

== In fashion ==

Traditionally, nail polish started in clear, white, red, pink, purple, and black. Nail polish can be found in a diverse variety of colors and shades. Beyond solid colors, nail polish has also developed an array of other designs, such as crackled, glitter, flake, speckled, iridescent, and holographic. Rhinestones or other decorative art are also often applied to nail polish. Some polish is advertised to induce nail growth, make nails stronger, prevent nails from breaking, cracking, or splitting, and even to stop nail biting.

=== French manicure ===
French manicures are designed to resemble natural nails, and are characterized by natural pink or nude base nails with white tips. French manicures were one of the first popular and well-known color schemes. French manicures may have originated in the eighteenth-century in Paris but were most popular in the 1920s and 1930s. However, the traditional French manicures were much different from what we know today. They were generally red, while leaving a round crescent shape at the area near the cuticle blank to enhance the lunula of the nail, known now as a half-moon manicure.

With the modern French manicure, trends involving painting different colors for the tips of the nails instead of the white. French tip nails can be made with stickers and stencils. It is still typically done by hand through painting with polish or gel, or sculptured with acrylic.

=== Nail art ===

Nail art is a creative way to paint, decorate, enhance, and embellish nails. Social media has expanded to a nail art culture by allowing users to share pictures of their nail art. &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; reports nail polish sales hit a record US$768 million in the United States in 2012, a 32% gain over 2011. Several new polishes and related products came on to the market in the 2020s as part of the explosion of nail art, such as nail stickers (either made of nail polish or plastic), stencils, magnetic nail polish, nail pens, glitter and sequin topcoats, nail caviar (micro beads), nail polish marketed for men, scented nail polish, and color changing nail polish (some which change hue when exposed to sunshine, and ranges which change hue in response to heat).

=== Western world ===
Nail polish in the Western world was more frequently worn by women, going in and out of acceptability depending upon moral customs of the day. It is less common for men to wear nail polish, and can be seen as a divergence from traditional gender norms. Colored and clear polishes can be used to protect nails from breakage, impart a well-groomed sheen, or express oneself artistically. Professional baseball players, especially catchers, may wear nail polish on the field.

== Nail polish remover ==
Nail polish remover is an organic solvent that may also include oils, scents, and coloring. Nail polish remover packages may include individual felt pads soaked in remover, a bottle of liquid remover used with a cotton ball or cotton pad, or a foam-filled container into which one inserts a finger and twists it until the polish comes off. The choice of remover type depends on the user&#x27;s preference, and often the price or quality of the remover.

The most common remover is acetone. Acetone can also remove artificial nails made of acrylic or cured gel.

An alternative nail polish remover is ethyl acetate, which often also contains isopropyl alcohol. Ethyl acetate is usually the original solvent for nail polish itself.

Acetonitrile has been used as a nail polish remover, but it is more toxic than the aforementioned options. It has been banned in the European Economic Area for use in cosmetics since 17 March 2000.

== Health concerns ==

The health risks associated with nail polish are disputed. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, &quot;The amount of chemicals used in animal studies is probably a couple of hundred times higher than what you would be exposed to from using nail polish every week or so. So the chances of any individual phthalate producing such harm [in humans] is very slim.&quot; A more serious health risk is faced by professional nail technicians, who perform manicures over a workstation, known as a nail table, on which the client&#x27;s hands rest – directly below the technician&#x27;s breathing zone. In 2009, Susan Reutman, an epidemiologist with the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health&#x27;s Division of Applied Research and Technology, announced a federal effort to evaluate the effectiveness of downdraft vented nail tables (VNTs) in removing potential nail polish chemical and dust exposures from the technician&#x27;s work area. These ventilation systems have potential to reduce worker exposure to chemicals by at least 50%. Many nail technicians will often wear masks to cover their mouth and nose from inhaling any of the harsh dust or chemicals from the nail products.

According to Reutman, a growing body of scientific literature suggests that some inhaled and absorbed organic solvents found in nail salons such as glycol ethers and carbon disulfide may have adverse effects on reproductive health. These effects may including birth defects, low birth weight, miscarriage, and preterm birth.

Nail polish formulations may include ingredients that are toxic or affect other health problems. One controversial family of ingredient are phthalates, which are implicated as endocrine disruptors and linked to problems in the endocrine system and increased risk of diabetes. Manufacturers have been pressured by consumer groups to reduce or to eliminate potentially-toxic ingredients, and in September 2006, several companies agreed to phase out dibutyl phthalates. There are no universal consumer safety standards for nail polish, however, and while formaldehyde has been eliminated from some nail polish brands, others still use it.

=== Regulation and environmental concerns ===
The U.S. city of San Francisco enacted a city ordinance, publicly identifying establishments that use nail polishes free of the &quot;toxic trio&quot; of dibutyl phthalate, toluene, and formaldehyde.

Nail polish is considered a hazardous waste by some regulatory bodies such as the Los Angeles Department of Public Works. Many countries have strict restrictions on sending nail polish by mail. The &quot;toxic trio&quot; are currently being phased out, but there are still components of nail polish that could cause environmental concern. Leaking out of the bottle into the soil could cause contamination in ground water. Chromium(III) oxide green and Prussian blue are common in nail polish and have shown evidence of going through chemical degradation, which could have a detrimental effect on health.

<text>Denel Dynamics, formerly Kentron, is a division of Denel SOC Ltd, a South African armaments development and manufacturing company wholly owned by the South African Government. It underwent a name change from Kentron to Denel Aerospace Systems in early 2004 and later to Denel Dynamics. Denel Dynamics is located in Centurion, South Africa. Several sites are operating according to ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 certified.

==Key products==

Kentron developed the ARD-10 loitering drone for the South African Defence Force in the 1980s, however with the end of the South African Border Wars it did not enter service. Kentron sold the designs to Israel Aerospace Industries which used them to develop the IAI Harpy which was first tested in 1989. The designs were sold to Iran Aviation Industries Organization in 2004/5 and used by Shahed Aviation Industries to develop the Shahed 131 and Shahed 136 drones.

==UN arms embargo violation==

Four South Africans working for Kentron were arrested in March 1984 in Coventry and charged with violation of the UN arms embargo – which outlawed the export of arms and military equipment to apartheid South Africa.

The Coventry Four were granted bail against a deposit of £200,000 and a guarantee by a diplomat from the South African embassy who waived his diplomatic immunity. They were allowed to return to South Africa on condition that they appeared at their trial in England in August 1984. In the event, South African foreign minister, Pik Botha, refused to allow them to return for their trial.

<text>Farnaz Fassihi (; born 1971) is an Iranian-American journalist who has worked for &quot;The New York Times&quot; since 2019. She is the United Nations bureau chief and also writes about Iranian news. Previously she was a senior writer for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; for 17 years and a conflict reporter based in the Middle East.

Fassihi&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Waiting for An Ordinary Day&quot;, is based on her four years covering the Iraq War and witnessing the unraveling of social life for Iraqi citizens.

==Early life and education==
Farnaz Fassihi was born in 1971 in the United States to Iranian parents. She grew up in Tehran, Iran, and Portland, Oregon in the US.

She earned a Master of Journalism from the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University in New York City.

==Career==
===Early career===
Fassihi worked as an investigative reporter and roving foreign correspondent for &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; of Newark, New Jersey. She covered the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, the war in Afghanistan, Second Palestinian Intifada and Iraq under Saddam Hussein for &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;. She was also a reporter for &quot;The Providence Journal&quot; in Rhode Island covering local news. She led the paper&#x27;s award-winning coverage of the crash of Egypt Air flight 990, traveling to Cairo to investigate the story.

She worked as a stringer for Western media organizations in Iran, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; at the age of 19, when she was studying in Iran.

===&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;===
Fassahi spent 17 years covering wars and uprisings across the Middle East as a senior writer and war correspondent for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, based Baghdad, Iraq, and then in Beirut, Lebanon, from 2003 to 2006, as deputy bureau chief for Middle East and Africa. She was sent to Afghanistan to cover the US-led invasion there, and covered topics such as elections in Zimbabwe, war in Gaza and the Arab Spring protests. She was one of the lead reporters for &quot;The Journal&quot;″s 2011 award-winning investigative project titled &quot;Censorship Inc.,&quot; a series of enterprise stories examining how western technology enabled censorship in authoritarian countries.

In 2004 she became more widely known, after a private email she had written to family and friends about the deteriorating situation in Iraq went viral on the Internet. It included criticism of U.S. activities in Iraq, saying &quot;The genie of terrorism, chaos, and mayhem has been unleashed... as a result of American mistakes&quot;. It was published in newspapers, websites and blogs around the world and became the subject of a &quot;Doonesbury&quot; cartoon. The email later became the kernel of her book about life in Iraq for ordinary Iraqis, &quot;Waiting for an Ordinary Day&quot; (2008), and was published in full in the book.

Moving back to the United States, she worked in &quot;WSJ&quot;″s Washington, D.C. office from 2015 to 2019, covering US foreign policy and diplomacy at the United Nations. She wrote about U.S. foreign policy and global diplomacy of some of the biggest stories: the missile crisis with North Korea, Myanmar&#x27;s ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya minority, Venezuela&#x27;s political upheaval, the Syrian civil war, Iran&#x27;s nuclear deal, the refugee crisis and climate change.

===&quot;The New York Times&quot;===
Fassihi joined &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a reporter in July 2019, based in New York City.

Fassihi reported in November 2019 uprising in Iran and broke the story of the massacre of people in Mahshahr, reconstructing in detail how the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, a passenger plane, with missiles on a night that the U.S. and Iran went to the brink of war, and lied about it for three days.

Also in November 2019, Fassihi was one of the reporters on a joint investigative project, &quot;The Iran Cables&quot;, between the &quot;NY Times&quot; and &quot;The Intercept&quot; about a find of intelligence cables revealing how Iran wields influence in Iraq.

In October 2020, Fassihi&#x27;s investigation into Iran&#x27;s MeToo movement revealed allegations of sexual misconduct against prominent artist Aydin Aghdashloo.

In August 2021, it was reported that Fassihi had been the target of a series of cyber attacks and violent threats by certain Iranian opposition groups and internet trolls over several months. She was doxxed and threatened with death and rape. &quot;The New York Times&quot; put out a statement on Twitter on August 6 in support of her. The Coalition For Women In Journalism condemned the attacks, which they called &quot;deeply gendered and misogynistic&quot;.

In October 2021, Fassihi and the &quot;New York Times&quot; were accused and called out in an open letter by critics for &quot;fake news&quot; reports for &quot;[denial of (DARVO)] and normalizing Iranian government brutality&quot;, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; Editorial board, public relations and Fassihi rebutted in an official public statement.

In April 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced that Fassihi would be covering the United Nations in addition to continuing to cover Iran.

She has been a guest speaker at numerous panels and journalism classes and a commentator for television and radio news shows on CNN, MSNBC, BBC, WNYC, PBS, &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; and National Public Radio in the United States.

Fassihi has served as a judge for the annual Overseas Press Club&#x27;s awarda, and as of September 2021 was serving on the OPC board.

She was a member of the Dag Hammarskjöld Fund For Journalists board for four years, and of the United Nations Correspondents Association from 2017 to 2019. She is also a member of the New York Chapter of the Iranian American Women Foundation, a non-partisan, non-political network of professional Iranian women. Fassihi is active in the organization&#x27;s mentorship program and mentors a young female Iranian journalist each year.

She was selected by Microsoft Teams in 2019 as a leader to be featured in a documentary called &quot;Art of the Team&quot;, which featured a group of a dozen leaders from different fields, including scientists, Olympic athletes, CEOs and designers. Microsoft Teams uses Fassihi&#x27;s interview in training sessions for corporations for team building and conflict resolution.

<doc id="1033697" wikidata="Q7575269" url="?curid=1033697" title="Spectrum (topology)">
<text>In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, a spectrum is an object representing a generalized cohomology theory. Every such cohomology theory is representable, as follows from Brown&#x27;s representability theorem. This means that, given a cohomology theoryformula_1,there exist spaces formula_2 such that evaluating the cohomology theory in degree formula_3 on a space formula_4 is equivalent to computing the homotopy classes of maps to the space formula_2, that isformula_6.Note there are several different categories of spectra leading to many technical difficulties, but they all determine the same homotopy category, known as the stable homotopy category. This is one of the key points for introducing spectra because they form a natural home for stable homotopy theory.

==The definition of a spectrum==

There are many variations of the definition: in general, a &quot;spectrum&quot; is any sequence formula_7 of pointed topological spaces or pointed simplicial sets together with the structure maps formula_8, where formula_9 is the smash product. The smash product of a pointed space formula_4 with a circle is homeomorphic to the reduced suspension of formula_4, denoted formula_12.

The following is due to Frank Adams (1974): a spectrum (or CW-spectrum) is a sequence formula_13 of CW complexes together with inclusions formula_14 of the suspension formula_15 as a subcomplex of formula_16.

For other definitions, see symmetric spectrum and simplicial spectrum.

=== Homotopy groups of a spectrum ===
Some of the most important invariants of a spectrum are its homotopy groups. These groups mirror the definition of the stable homotopy groups of spaces since the structure of the suspension maps is integral in its definition. Given a spectrum formula_17 define the homotopy group formula_18 as the colimitformula_19where the maps are induced from the composition of the map formula_20 (that is, formula_21 given by functoriality of formula_22) and the structure map formula_23. A spectrum is said to be connective if its formula_24 are zero for negative &quot;k&quot;.

== Examples ==

=== Eilenberg–Maclane spectrum ===
Consider singular cohomology formula_25 with coefficients in an abelian group formula_26. For a CW complex formula_4, the group formula_25 can be identified with the set of homotopy classes of maps from formula_4 to formula_30, the Eilenberg–MacLane space with homotopy concentrated in degree formula_31. We write this asformula_32Then the corresponding spectrum formula_33 has formula_31-th space formula_30; it is called the Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum of formula_26. Note this construction can be used to embed any ring formula_37 into the category of spectra. This embedding forms the basis of spectral geometry, a model for derived algebraic geometry. One of the important properties of this embedding are the isomorphismsformula_38showing the category of spectra keeps track of the derived information of commutative rings, where the smash product acts as the derived tensor product. Moreover, Eilenberg–Maclane spectra can be used to define theories such as topological Hochschild homology for commutative rings, a more refined theory than classical Hochschild homology.

=== Topological complex K-theory ===
As a second important example, consider topological K-theory. At least for &quot;X&quot; compact, formula_39 is defined to be the Grothendieck group of the monoid of complex vector bundles on &quot;X&quot;. Also, formula_40 is the group corresponding to vector bundles on the suspension of X. Topological K-theory is a generalized cohomology theory, so it gives a spectrum. The zeroth space is formula_41 while the first space is formula_42. Here formula_42 is the infinite unitary group and formula_44 is its classifying space. By Bott periodicity we get formula_45 and formula_46 for all &quot;n&quot;, so all the spaces in the topological K-theory spectrum are given by either formula_41 or formula_42. There is a corresponding construction using real vector bundles instead of complex vector bundles, which gives an 8-periodic spectrum.

=== Sphere spectrum ===
One of the quintessential examples of a spectrum is the sphere spectrum formula_49. This is a spectrum whose homotopy groups are given by the stable homotopy groups of spheres, soformula_50We can write down this spectrum explicitly as formula_51 where formula_52. Note the smash product gives a product structure on this spectrumformula_53induces a ring structure on formula_49. Moreover, if considering the category of symmetric spectra, this forms the initial object, analogous to formula_55 in the category of commutative rings.

=== Thom spectra ===

Another canonical example of spectra come from the Thom spectra representing various cobordism theories. This includes real cobordism formula_56, complex cobordism formula_57, framed cobordism, spin cobordism formula_58, string cobordism formula_59, and so on. In fact, for any topological group formula_60 there is a Thom spectrum formula_61.

=== Suspension spectrum ===
A spectrum may be constructed out of a space. The suspension spectrum of a space formula_4, denoted formula_63 is a spectrum formula_64 (the structure maps are the identity.) For example, the suspension spectrum of the 0-sphere is the sphere spectrum discussed above. The homotopy groups of this spectrum are then the stable homotopy groups of formula_4, soformula_66The construction of the suspension spectrum implies every space can be considered as a cohomology theory. In fact, it defines a functorformula_67from the homotopy category of CW complexes to the homotopy category of spectra. The morphisms are given byformula_68which by the Freudenthal suspension theorem eventually stabilizes. By this we meanformula_69 and formula_70for some finite integer formula_71. For a CW complex formula_4 there is an inverse construction formula_73 which takes a spectrum formula_17 and forms a spaceformula_75called the infinite loop space of the spectrum. For a CW complex formula_4formula_77and this construction comes with an inclusion formula_78 for every formula_31, hence gives a mapformula_80which is injective. Unfortunately, these two structures, with the addition of the smash product, lead to significant complexity in the theory of spectra because there cannot exist a single category of spectra which satisfies a list of five axioms relating these structures. The above adjunction is valid only in the homotopy categories of spaces and spectra, but not always with a specific category of spectra (not the homotopy category).

=== Ω-spectrum ===
An Ω-spectrum is a spectrum such that the adjoint of the structure map (i.e., the mapformula_81) is a weak equivalence. The K-theory spectrum of a ring is an example of an Ω-spectrum.

=== Ring spectrum ===
A ring spectrum is a spectrum &quot;X&quot; such that the diagrams that describe ring axioms in terms of smash products commute &quot;up to homotopy&quot; (formula_82 corresponds to the identity.) For example, the spectrum of topological &quot;K&quot;-theory is a ring spectrum. A module spectrum may be defined analogously.

For many more examples, see the list of cohomology theories.

==Functions, maps, and homotopies of spectra==

There are three natural categories whose objects are spectra, whose morphisms are the functions, or maps, or homotopy classes defined below.

A function between two spectra &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; is a sequence of maps from &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot; to &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; that commute with the 
maps Σ&quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot; → &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 and Σ&quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; → &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1.

Given a spectrum formula_83, a subspectrum formula_84 is a sequence of subcomplexes that is also a spectrum. As each &quot;i&quot;-cell in formula_85 suspends to an (&quot;i&quot; + 1)-cell in formula_86, a cofinal subspectrum is a subspectrum for which each cell of the parent spectrum is eventually contained in the subspectrum after a finite number of suspensions. Spectra can then be turned into a category by defining a map of spectra formula_87 to be a function from a cofinal subspectrum formula_60 of formula_17 to formula_90, where two such functions represent the same map if they coincide on some cofinal subspectrum. Intuitively such a map of spectra does not need to be everywhere defined, just &quot;eventually&quot; become defined, and two maps that coincide on a cofinal subspectrum are said to be equivalent. 
This gives the category of spectra (and maps), which is a major tool. There is a natural embedding of the category of pointed CW complexes into this category: it takes formula_91 to the &quot;suspension spectrum&quot; in which the &quot;n&quot;th complex is formula_92.

The smash product of a spectrum formula_17 and a pointed complex formula_4 is a spectrum given by formula_95 (associativity of the smash product yields immediately that this is indeed a spectrum). A homotopy of maps between spectra corresponds to a map formula_96, where formula_97 is the disjoint union formula_98 with formula_99 taken to be the basepoint. 
The stable homotopy category, or homotopy category of (CW) spectra is defined to be the category whose objects are spectra and whose morphisms are homotopy classes of maps between spectra. Many other definitions of spectrum, some appearing very different, lead to equivalent stable homotopy categories.

Finally, we can define the suspension of a spectrum by formula_100. This translation suspension is invertible, as we can desuspend too, by setting formula_101.

==The triangulated homotopy category of spectra==

The stable homotopy category is additive: maps can be added by using a variant of the track addition used to define homotopy groups. Thus homotopy classes from one spectrum to another form an abelian group. Furthermore the stable homotopy category is triangulated (Vogt (1970)), the shift being given by suspension and the distinguished triangles by the mapping cone sequences of spectra 
:formula_102.

==Smash products of spectra==

The smash product of spectra extends the smash product of CW complexes. It makes the stable homotopy category into a monoidal category; in other words it behaves like the (derived) tensor product of abelian groups. A major problem with the smash product is that obvious ways of defining it make it associative and commutative only up to homotopy. Some more recent definitions of spectra, such as symmetric spectra, eliminate this problem, and give a symmetric monoidal structure at the level of maps, before passing to homotopy classes.

The smash product is compatible with the triangulated category structure. In particular the smash product of a distinguished triangle with a spectrum is a distinguished triangle.

==Generalized homology and cohomology of spectra==

We can define the (stable) homotopy groups of a spectrum to be those given by 
:formula_103,
where formula_49 is the sphere spectrum and formula_105 is the set of homotopy classes of maps from formula_4 to formula_107. 
We define the generalized homology theory of a spectrum &quot;E&quot; by
:formula_108
and define its generalized cohomology theory by
:formula_109
Here formula_4 can be a spectrum or (by using its suspension spectrum) a space.

== Technical complexities with spectra ==
One of the canonical complexities while working with spectra and defining a category of spectra comes from the fact each of these categories cannot satisfy five seemingly obvious axioms concerning the infinite loop space of a spectrum formula_111formula_112sendingformula_113, a pair of adjoint functors formula_114, and the smash product formula_9 in both the category of spaces and the category of spectra. If we let formula_116 denote the category of based, compactly generated, weak Hausdorff spaces, and formula_117 denote a category of spectra, the following five axioms can never be satisfied by the specific model of spectra:

# formula_117 is a symmetric monoidal category with respect to the smash product formula_9
# The functor formula_120 is left-adjoint to formula_73
# The unit for the smash product formula_9 is the sphere spectrum formula_123
# Either there is a natural transformation formula_124 or a natural transformation formula_125 which commutes with the unit object in both categories, and the commutative and associative isomorphisms in both categories.
# There is a natural weak equivalence formula_126 for formula_127 which means that there is a commuting diagram:formula_128where formula_129 is the unit map in the adjunction.

Because of this, the study of spectra is fractured based upon the model being used. For an overview, check out the article cited above.

==History==

A version of the concept of a spectrum was introduced in the 1958 doctoral dissertation of Elon Lages Lima. His advisor Edwin Spanier wrote further on the subject in 1959. Spectra were adopted by Michael Atiyah and George W. Whitehead in their work on generalized homology theories in the early 1960s. The 1964 doctoral thesis of J. Michael Boardman gave a workable definition of a category of spectra and of maps (not just homotopy classes) between them, as useful in stable homotopy theory as the category of CW complexes is in the unstable case. (This is essentially the category described above, and it is still used for many purposes: for other accounts, see Adams (1974) or Rainer Vogt (1970).) Important further theoretical advances have however been made since 1990, improving vastly the formal properties of spectra. Consequently, much recent literature uses modified definitions of spectrum: see Michael Mandell &quot;et al.&quot; (2001) for a unified treatment of these new approaches.

<text>Cantley is a village and civil parish in the City of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England. The village is adjacent to Bessacarr, separated by Bawtry Road. It has a population of 2,830, reducing slightly to 2,817 at the 2011 Census.

==Etymology==
The second part of the name is the Old English &quot;–lēah&quot; meaning &quot;a clearing, pasture, meadow&quot;. This is suffixed either to &quot;Canta-&quot;, an unrecorded but plausible Old English hypocorism, or the Brittonic &quot;cant&quot; meaning &quot;a circumference, a boundary&quot; and &quot;a division, share of land&quot; (Welsh &quot;cant&quot;).

==Early history==
Cantley Hall was probably a home from around the 7th or 8th century, owned by a Saxon called Tochi prior to the conquest of England by the Normans in 1066, after which it probably went to the Everingham&#x27;s or Everingham Ancestors. By 1209 it was known as Kanteleia, and Cauntele in 1246. By 1280 it was in the possession of Robert de Everingham. The Everingham name lives on to this day in Everingham Road, one of the main roads through Cantley. By the late 15th century the name of Cantley had been established and remained, while the residents of the estate were the Smith family.

==Today==

Most of Cantley was built after the Second World War, with many of its houses 1950s built semi-detached or small terraces. It mainly consists of housing estates, some council estates, plus a large park and areas of woodland. There are two main sets of shops - Everingham Road has a local convenience store, post office, bakers, grocers, butchers, hairdressers, DIY, and the popular &quot;Fish Dish&quot; fish &amp; chip shop. St Wilfrid&#x27;s shops are near the local health centre and have several convenience stores, off licences, hairdresser&#x27;s and a Chinese takeaway. The Cantley Library is situated at St Wilfrid&#x27;s. There is also a Co-Op on Goodison Boulevard, and two petrol stations. A secondary school, The McAuley Catholic High School, is situated across two campuses towards Old Cantley, and primary schools include Hatchell Wood (previously South Cantley Middle School), and Hawthorn Primary School

There were three pubs in Cantley, one near the park (&quot;Bechers Brook&quot;, named for the Grand National fence), another at Everingham Road shops (&quot;The Palfreys Lodge&quot;) and a third (&quot;The Paddock&quot;) at Cantley Lane roundabout. (&quot;The Paddock&quot;) closed and was converted into a My Local convenience store, eventually closed when My Local collapsed in June 2016. The pub names were all linked to horse racing - The Palfreys Lodge was originally called &quot;The Two Palfrey&#x27;s&quot;.

The street names in Cantley have links to each other in groups. Examples are streets named after trees e.g. Lilac Grove, Pine Road, Willow Avenue. Another linked group are football grounds e.g. Ninian Grove, Anfield Road, Ewood Drive, Hillsborough Road. Race courses are another group of street names e.g., Ascot Avenue, Newmarket Road, York Gardens, and Epsom Road.

Cantley has two large landmarks in the form of two water towers. These can be seen from almost any high ground around the Doncaster district.

Cantley has good transport links into Doncaster with a regular bus service from First South Yorkshire route 57, which is now extended for certain journeys to take in the old 91 route to Finningley. Previously First routes 57, 59 and 91 served the village, and before that Leon services 89 and 191. Because of the bus connection, it is a popular retirement village for many people.

==Old Cantley==
The village of Old Cantley, around half a mile in the Armthorpe direction, is built around the Grade II listed Georgian manor house Cantley Hall, presently owned by Graham Kirkham, Baron Kirkham of Old Cantley the founder and chairman of sofa retailer Dfs.

<text>Timothy John Winton (born 4 August 1960) is an Australian writer. He has written novels, children&#x27;s books, non-fiction books, and short stories. In 1997, he was named a Living Treasure by the National Trust of Australia, and has won the Miles Franklin Award four times.

==Life and career==
Timothy John Winton was born on 4 August 1960 in Subiaco, an inner western suburb of Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the northern Perth suburb of Karrinyup, before he moved with his family to the regional city of Albany at the age of 12.

Whilst at the Western Australian Institute of Technology, Winton wrote his first novel, &quot;An Open Swimmer&quot;, which won The Australian/Vogel Literary Award in 1981, launching his writing career. He has stated that he wrote &quot;the best part of three books while at university&quot;. His second book, &quot;Shallows&quot;, won the Miles Franklin Award in 1984. Winton published &quot;Cloudstreet&quot; in 1991, which properly established his writing career. He has continued to publish fiction, plays and non-fiction material.

== Personal life ==
Winton has lived in Italy, France, Ireland and Greece, but currently lives in Western Australia. He met his wife Denise when they were children at school. When he was 18 and recovering from a car accident, they reconnected as she was a student nurse. They married when Winton was 21 and she was 20, and had three children together.

Winton&#x27;s younger brother, Andrew Winton, is a musician and a high school chaplain. His younger sister is Sharyn O&#x27;Neill, who in 2018 became the Public Sector Commissioner of Western Australia, after 12 years as Director General of the WA Education Department.

As his fame has grown, Winton has guarded his and his family&#x27;s privacy. He rarely speaks in public yet he is known as &quot;an affable, plain-speaking man of unaffected intelligence and deep emotions.&quot;

==Reception and honours==
In 1995, Winton&#x27;s &quot;The Riders&quot; was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for Fiction, as was his 2001 book, &quot;Dirt Music&quot;. A film version, also called &quot;Dirt Music&quot;, was released in 2019. He has won many other prizes, including the Miles Franklin Award a record four times: for &quot;Shallows&quot; (1984), &quot;Cloudstreet&quot; (1992), &quot;Dirt Music&quot; (2002) and &quot;Breath&quot; (2009). &quot;Cloudstreet&quot; regularly appears in lists of Australia&#x27;s best-loved novels.

All his books are still in print and have been published in eighteen different languages. His work has also been successfully adapted for stage, screen and radio. On the publication of his novel, &quot;Dirt Music&quot;, he collaborated with broadcaster Lucky Oceans to produce a compilation CD, &quot;Dirt Music – Music for a Novel&quot;.

Winton has been named a Living Treasure by the National Trust and awarded the Centenary Medal for service to literature and the community. In 2023, Winton was awarded the ABIA Lloyd O&#x27;Neil Award for outstanding service to the Australian book industry. Curtin University has named a lecture theatre in his honour.

The Tim Winton Young Writers Award, sponsored annually since 1993 by the City of Subiaco, recognises young writers in the Perth metropolitan area. It is open to short story writers of primary school and secondary school age. Three compilations have been published: &quot;Destination Unknown&quot; (2001) &quot;Life Bytes&quot; (2002), and &quot;Hatched: Celebrating Twenty Years of the Tim Winton Award for Young Writers (2013)&quot;. The latter features the winning story from each year of the award from 1993 to 2012. Winton is the patron of the competition.

Winton was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in the 2023 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours for &quot;distinguished service to literature as an author and novelist, to conservation, and to environmental advocacy&quot;.

==Style and themes==
Winton draws his prime inspiration from landscape and place, mostly coastal Western Australia. He has said &quot;The place comes first. If the place isn&#x27;t interesting to me then I can&#x27;t feel it. I can&#x27;t feel any people in it. I can&#x27;t feel what the people are on about or likely to get up to.&quot;

Dr Jules Smith for the British Council wrote about Winton, 
&quot;His books are boisterous and lyrical by turns, warm-hearted in their depictions of family life but with characters that often have to be in extremis in order to find themselves. They have a wonderful feeling for the strange beauty of Australia; are frequently flavoured with Aussie vernacular expressions, and a good deal of emotional directness. They question macho role models (his books are full of strong women and troubled men) and are prepared to risk their realist credibility with enigmatic, even visionary endings.&quot;

Winton revisits place and, occasionally, characters from one book to another. Queenie Cookson, for example, is a character in &quot;Breath&quot; who also appears in &quot;Shallows&quot;, &quot;Minimum of Two&quot; and in two of the Lockie Leonard books.

==Environmental advocacy==
Winton is actively involved in the Australian environmental movement. He is a patron of the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) and is involved in many of their campaigns, notably their work in raising awareness about sustainable seafood consumption. He is a patron of the Stop the Toad Foundation and contributed to the whaling debate with an article on the &quot;Last Whale&quot; website. He is also a prominent advocate of the Save Moreton Bay organisation, the Environment Defender&#x27;s Office, the Australian Wildlife Conservancy and the Marine Conservation Society, with which he is campaigning against shark finning.

In 2003, Winton was awarded the inaugural Australian Society of Authors (ASA) Medal in recognition for his work in the campaign to save the Ningaloo Reef.

Winton keeps away from the public eye, unless promoting a new book or supporting an environmental issue. He told reviewer Jason Steger &quot;Occasionally they wheel me out for green advocacy stuff but that&#x27;s the only kind of stuff I put my head up for.&quot;

In 2016, species of fish from the Kimberley region was named after him.

In March 2017, Winton was named patron of the newly established Native Australian Animals Trust. He has always featured the environment and the Australian landscape in his writings. The trust was established to help research and teaching about native animals and their environment. Associate Professor Tim Dempster, School of Biosciences is quoted as saying, &quot;Australia has a unique and charismatic animal fauna, but our state of knowledge about it is poor. Indeed species can go extinct before we even know of their existence. We have much to learn from our fauna, and a pressing need to do so.&quot;

In 2023, a mini documentary series was released by the ABC called Ningaloo Nyinggulu, which he was the presenter for.

His 2024 novel &quot;Juice&quot; looks at the impact of climate change that has been called &#x27;a potent vision of the future that points a finger at the complacency of the present&#x27; as it takes a look at the impact of climate change.

<text>Exeter () is a village in the Southern Highlands district of New South Wales, Australia, in Wingecarribee Shire. It has a station on the Main Southern railway line south of Sydney.

== History ==
The village was founded by James Badgery, who was born near the County Town of Exeter in Devon, England. He arrived in New South Wales in 1799, and by 1812 was operating ‘Exeter Farms’ near Bringelly. His fortunes prospered and he explored further south arriving in what is now Exeter in 1819. In 1821 Badgery took up a 500-acre land grant on the site of the present village calling the new property Spring Grove. His son Henry continued expansion in the locality and by 1841 there was a flourishing community on the various Badgery properties. Eleven households with 79 people appear on the NSW Census of that year. Their principal property, Vine Lodge, accommodated 33 residents, including 13 convicts and ex-convicts. Following the subdivision of Vine Lodge around 1888, the name of Exeter came into being in 1890 for the present village.

There was a railway accident at Exeter in fog on a single line on 13 March 1914, killing 14 people, when the Temora Mail collided with the locomotive of a goods train which had not completed backing into a siding to allow the Mail train to pass. This is NSW&#x27;s third worst railway accident.

==Population==
At the , Exeter had a population of 949. At the 2021 census, there were 1,087 people living at Exeter.

== Heritage listings ==
Exeter has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Main Southern railway: Exeter railway station

==School==
Schools in Exeter:

* Exeter Public School

<doc id="1033712" wikidata="Q3592629" url="?curid=1033712" title="Tolkien research">
<text>The works of J. R. R. Tolkien have generated a body of research covering many aspects of his fantasy writings. These encompass &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, along with his legendarium that remained unpublished until after his death, and his constructed languages, especially the Elvish languages Quenya and Sindarin. Scholars from different disciplines have examined the linguistic and literary origins of Middle-earth, and have explored many aspects of his writings from Christianity to feminism and race.

== Biographical ==

Biographies of Tolkien have been written by Humphrey Carpenter, with his 1977 &quot;J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography&quot; and of Tolkien&#x27;s wartime years by John Garth with his 2003 &quot;Tolkien and the Great War: The Threshold of Middle-earth&quot;. Carpenter edited the 1981 &quot;The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien&quot;, assisted by Christopher Tolkien. The brief period after the war when Tolkien worked for the &quot;OED&quot; is detailed in the 2006 book &quot;The Ring of Words: Tolkien and the Oxford English Dictionary&quot; by Peter Gilliver, Jeremy Marshall and Edmund Weiner.

== On Tolkien&#x27;s writings ==

=== Institutions ===

A variety of institutions have developed to support Tolkien research. These include The Tolkien Society and The Mythopoeic Society. Tolkien archives are held in the Bodleian Library in Oxford and Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Publishers of scholarly books on Tolkien include Houghton Mifflin, McFarland Press, Mythopoeic Press, Walking Tree Publishers, Palgrave MacMillan, and Kent State University Press.

=== Journals ===

Early publications on Tolkien&#x27;s writing were essentially fanzines; some, such as &quot;Mythlore&quot;, founded in 1969, developed into scholarly peer-reviewed (refereed) technical publications; among the &quot;reputable&quot; journals is &quot;Mallorn&quot; by the Tolkien Society. Other specialised journals include &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot; (2004–) and &quot;Journal of Tolkien Research&quot; (2014–). There are several journals that focus on the literary society The Inklings, of which Tolkien was a member, especially &quot;Journal of Inklings Studies&quot; (2011–).

=== Conferences===

In 1992, the Tolkien Society and the Mythopoeic Society held a joint conference for the centenary of Tolkien&#x27;s birth, combining papers that were published in the conference proceedings, with a mixed programme of events over a period of eight days, 17–24 August 1992, in Oxford. The Mythopoeic Society has been holding conferences in the U.S. (and once in Canada) nearly annually since 1970. In recent years some conferences have been virtual.

&quot;Omentielva&quot; is a European bi-yearly conference on research into Tolkien&#x27;s invented languages.

=== Fields ===

A large literature examines Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth fantasy fiction from numerous points of view. Some scholars have investigated its philological roots in languages such as Old Norse and Old English. Others have explored its influences from literature of periods from classical and medieval to antiquarian and modern. Many have examined its themes including its poetry, its Christian symbolism, issues of feminism, race, and sexuality, and questions such as Tolkien&#x27;s theory of sound and language. Others again have studied the literary devices that Tolkien used, such as his use of frame stories, interlacing of narrative, and his intentional creation of an Impression of depth. These are overviewed in Blackwell&#x27;s 2014 &quot;A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien&quot;, which effectively marked his acceptance into the English literary canon.

=== Constructed languages ===
Tolkien&#x27;s constructed languages, Quenya and Sindarin, the main languages of Elves, have inspired linguistic research. &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot; and &quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot; are published by the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship of the Mythopoeic Society a non-profit organization. The &quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot; and &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot; material published at an increasing rate during the early 2000s is from the stock of linguistic material in the possession of the appointed team of editors (some 3000 pages according to them), consisting of photocopies sent them by Christopher Tolkien and notes taken in the Bodleian Library around 1992. An Internet mailing list dedicated to Tolkien&#x27;s languages, called tolklang, has existed since November 1, 1990.

<text>Major Leslie James Hiddins , known as &quot;The Bush Tucker Man&quot; is a retired Australian Army soldier and war veteran. He is best known for his love and knowledge of the Australian bush, in particular &quot;bush tucker&quot;, as featured in the TV series &quot;Bush Tucker Man&quot; (1988–1996). Hiddins is recognised by his distinctively modified Akubra hat. He has also written several books for children and adults, and in 2019 launched a website that includes a searchable digital database of bush tucker.

==Early life and education==
Leslie James Hiddins was born in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. 

==Career==
===Military service===
As a soldier with the Australian Army, Hiddins did two deployments in the Vietnam War between 1966 and 1968, the first as a forward scout in the infantry. 

Upon return from the war in the late 1960s, feeling the need for a change, he transferred from infantry to army aviation, which led him to flying around northern Australia and Arnhem Land in a helicopter. In 1987, he was awarded a Defence Fellowship to research survival in northern Australia, and was the principal author of the Australian Army&#x27;s military survival manual in that year. As part of this research, Hiddins was introduced to the Kakadu plum (&quot;Terminalia ferdinandiana&quot;) by the Aboriginal people, who had used the plant for thousands of years. He claims that the analysis finding it to have the highest concentration of Vitamin C of any known natural substance in the world was made on fruit he provided.

Hiddins retired from the Australian Regular Army (ARA) in 1989 with the rank of Major, but continued to serve with the Army Reserve (ARES) until 2001, working with Indigenous Australian communities in northern Australia. This research turned into the TV series &quot;The Bush Tucker Man&quot; in 1993.
===Kalpowar Station/Pandanus Park===
In 2001, Hiddins led an effort to establish a wilderness retreat, exclusively for war veterans, on a 9 km2 parcel of government land along the banks of the Normanby River at &quot;Kalpowar Station&quot;, adjoining Rinyirru National Park in Cape York Peninsula. The remote and relatively inaccessible area, devoid of amenities of any kind, was named &quot;Pandanus Park&quot;. After years of conflict with government over their illegal occupation, the group secured a 15-year lease when the entire Kalpowar Station was returned to Aboriginal title in 2005.

==Recognition, awards and honours==
In 1987, he was awarded a Defence Fellowship to research survival in northern Australia.

In September 1985, Hiddins was awarded a National Medal.

In the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours in June 1987, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia, for service to the Australian army in the field of combat survival.

On 28 March 2008, Hiddins was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science by James Cook University&#x27;s Faculty of Science, Engineering and Information Technology:
The National Museum of Australia in Canberra has a Bush Tucker Man display with some of his original bush gear – his original hat, camera and backpack.

== TV programmes==
===&quot;Bush Tucker Man&quot;===
Hiddins&#x27; research led to the TV series &quot;The Bush Tucker Man&quot;, made for ABC Television in 1993. The series was co-written, co-directed, and co-produced by Stephen Burstow, David Telfer, and Richard Walker. 

In the series, Hiddins drives around in a Land Rover Perentie with his trademark hat, finding and describing native Australian bush food or &quot;bush tucker&quot;. Hiddins appeared in two ABC TV series of &quot;Bush Tucker Man&quot;, as well as the series &quot;Bush Tucker Man – Stories of Survival&quot;.

===Other TV===
Hiddins narrated and presented two TV documentaries for ABC, both created by Paul Hawker: &quot;Pandora – in the Wake of the Bounty&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Resurrection of the Batavia&quot; (1995).

Ray Mears made a BBC programme about and with him, shown on BBC Two in June 2009 as part of his &quot;Ray Mears Goes Walkabout&quot; series.

Hiddins featured in an episode of ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;Landline&quot; program in 2019.

==Other media==
Hiddins and wife Sandy set up an Instagram account, in which they post their archival and current photos, which has brought them a new and younger group of fans, as well as primary school teachers in remote Indigenous communities in Arnhem Land.

In 2019, Hiddins launched a user-pays website that includes a searchable digital database of bush tucker. Users can search by location and season, and the website returns a list of flora and fauna likely to be found in that area at that time.

== Publications ==
Hiddins&#x27; publications include &quot;Bush Tucker Man – Stories of Exploration and Survival&quot; (1996), &quot;Bush Tucker Man – Tarnished Heroes&quot; (1997), &quot;Explore Wild Australia with the Bush Tucker Man&quot; (1999), &quot;Bush Tucker Fieldguide&quot; (2002). In 2000, Hiddins published four books specifically for children: &quot;The Coral Coast&quot;, &quot;The Top End&quot;, &quot;The Tropical Rainforest&quot;, and &quot;The Living Desert&quot;.

<doc id="1033721" wikidata="Q937351" url="?curid=1033721" title="The Football Factory (film)">
<text>The Football Factory is a 2004 sports drama film written by AJ Lovell and directed by Nick Love and starring Danny Dyer, Tamer Hassan, Frank Harper, Roland Manookian, Neil Maskell and Dudley Sutton. The film is loosely based on the novel of the same name by John King and the first foray into filmmaking by video game producers Rockstar Games (publishers of games such as the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series, among others), credited as executive producers. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 14 May 2004.

==Plot==
Tommy Johnson (Danny Dyer) is a member of a violent Chelsea hooligan firm. His friends and fellow hooligans include Tommy&#x27;s best friend Rod King (Neil Maskell), the hot-tempered Billy Bright (Frank Harper), and impulsive younger members Zeberdee (Roland Manookian) and Raf (Calum MacNab). Tommy spends his days drinking, using drugs, womanising and fighting, much to the disappointment of his grandfather Bill Farrell (Dudley Sutton), a pensioner and veteran who plans to move to Australia with his best friend Albert (John Junkin).

Tommy has an epiphany about his lifestyle during a fight with the Tottenham hooligan firm. Tommy, Billy and Rod are arrested for assaulting two Stoke City fans whilst travelling to an away match. These actions draw the fury of Harris (Tony Denham), the leader of the Chelsea firm, whose attempts to keep order are thwarted by Billy&#x27;s aggressive outbursts.

Tommy, Billy and Rod have to attend court in order to answer for their behaviour. Rod begins a relationship with Tamara (Sophie Linfield), the court clerk present at their court hearing, and she pressures him to skip his weekend meets. Zeberdee and his friend Raff accidentally burgle Billy&#x27;s house and are forced to stand in his living room, whilst Billy&#x27;s children throw darts at them as punishment, with one of the children kicking Zeberdee in his loins. Billy deals with his increasing loneliness after he overhears Harris discussing his irrelevance and unreliability. Bill&#x27;s plan to retire to Australia are postponed, when Albert dies the night before they are to leave.

Early in the film, Tommy is caught and held hostage by the brother of Sian (Michele Hallak), a girl he picked up at a club. He is saved when Rod hits the man on the head with a cricket bat and they both run away from the house. Sian&#x27;s brother turns out to also be the brother of the rival Millwall firm&#x27;s leader, Fred (Tamer Hassan), who then hunts Tommy down throughout the entire film. The film culminates in a pitched battle between the Chelsea and Millwall firms. Rod (after a few espressos and a line of cocaine), leaves a dinner with Tamara&#x27;s parents after offending them, and attends the &quot;meet&quot;, much to the joy of Tommy who is glad that his friend showed up for the meet. Tommy is severely beaten by Fred and a group of Millwall hooligans, with a brick being smashed into his face, and ends up in the hospital with Bill, who, in the meantime, has suffered a heart attack after confronting Zeberdee and Raf on the bus.

At the end of the film, a crippled Tommy decides that his place is at the firm with his friends, Bill gets cured and moves to Australia and Billy Bright is incarcerated for seven years in HMP Full Sutton after being arrested at the Millwall meet (whilst saving Harris from being arrested). Zeberdee is killed by a drug dealer, whom he and Raff had previously mugged, fulfilling a recurring nightmare that tormented Tommy throughout the film. In a pre-credits slideshow, Tommy is shown to have since moved on to watching Rugby. However, this is only a joke and he has not actually started to watch rugby.

<text>Gabès (, ; ), also spelled Cabès, Cabes, and Kabes, is the capital of the Gabès Governorate in Tunisia. Situated on the coast of the Gulf of Gabès, the city has a population of 167,863, making it the 6th largest Tunisian city in the country. Located 327 km southeast of Tunis and 113 km from Sfax, Gabès lies at the delta of the Wadi Qabis, which originates 10 kilometers upstream at Ras al-Oued and serves as its primary water source. 

Historically, the town was a Carthaginian settlement known as Tacapae before falling under Roman control. It was later ruined during the 7th-century Arab invasion but was recovered by Sidi Boulbaba, a revered companion of the Prophet Muhammad and a patron of the town. Although it experienced decline under the Ottomans, Gabès saw significant growth under French rule from 1881 to 1955, with the development of key infrastructure, including a railway, road network, and port. During World War II, the city served as the headquarters for Germany’s Afrika Korps until British and French forces retook it in 1943. Today, Gabès is a thriving commercial hub and oasis, with industries spanning fishing, agriculture, textiles, cement, brick manufacturing, and petrochemicals. Tourism also contributes to its economy, making it an important center in southern Tunisia. 

==History==

===Etymology===
Takapes, the ancient name of Gabès, is a Punic Numidian (Berber) toponym. Later, the prefix &quot;Ta&quot; (meaning &quot;the&quot; in Punic) was dropped, and the place became known as Kapes. As in Arabic the sound /p/ is unknown, Kapes became known as Kabes, and later known as Gabès.

=== Roman period ===
Gabès is the ancient &quot;Tacapae&quot; or &quot;Tacape&quot; (Τακάπη in Ancient greek) or &quot;Tacapes&quot; of the Roman province of Tripolitania.

Strabo refers to this city as an important entrepot of the Lesser Syrtis. Pliny (18.22) remarks that the waters of a copious fountain at Tacape were divided among the cultivators according to a system where each had the use of the water during a certain interval of time.

The shows Tacape between Macomades and Sabratha.

=== Bishopric ===
Tacapae became a Christian bishopric that, no longer being a residential see, is included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees.

Three of its bishops are known:
*Dulcitius, legate of the bishops of Tripolitana to the Council of Carthage (403) and present at the Conference of Carthage (411); 
*Servilius, exiled by Huneric in 484; 
*Caius or Gallus, legate of the bishops of his province to the Council of Carthage (525).

=== After the Roman and Christian period ===

*7th century: The Umayyad Caliphate conquest. Muhammed&#x27;s companion Sidi Abu Lubaba Al&#x27;Ansari settles in Gabès.
*1148: The Zirids sack Gabés
*1574: Gabès becomes part of the Eyalet of Tunis after the Ottoman conquest.
*1881: Gabès comes under a French protectorate.
*1940: Following the Fall of France, Gabès comes under German control.
*1941: Gabès pogrom
*1943: Gabès returns to French control with the help of the British (in the Mareth Line). The operation results in serious damage to the city infrastructure. 
*1945: The rebuilding of Gabès starts.
*1956: Gabès reverts to Tunisian control with the independence of Tunisia from the French.
Al-Idrisi wrote about Gabès in the 12th century:Gabès is a distinguished and thriving city, surrounded by orchards of dense, intertwined gardens and orderly plantations, with a variety of inexpensive fruits. It has an abundance of dates, crops, and estates, far surpassing other lands in this regard. The city also produces olives, oil, and various other agricultural products. Gabès is protected by a strong wall, and there is a moat around it. The city contains markets, buildings, trade, and merchandise. In the past, there was a silk weaving industry here, producing fine silk. Today, there are tanneries for leather, and the city produces and supplies leather goods. A large stream flows into the city from a nearby spring, and on this stream stands the Saja Palace, which is three miles from Gabès. Gabès itself is a small, well-developed city, and it also has a market near the sea, with many merchants, silk traders, and vendors. The city&#x27;s water supply comes from the Oued Gabès. Al-Tijani, in the 14th century, wrote about his trip to Gabès:&quot;We spent the night in Oudhref, and on Monday morning, we set off. We came close to the forest of Gabès and reached it by midday. What we saw was a city overflowing with beauty, a place where every aspect of charm and grace had been fulfilled. I recall its more vivid appearance, its lush greenery, resembling the paradise of eternity, with its shimmering silk-like landscapes. Its forest encircled it from all sides. This forest contained forts and perfectly aligned palm trees that would capture anyone’s attention. The beauty and elegance of the place could truly fulfill the saying that Gabès is the paradise of the world, and that it is the ‘Little Damascus’—with its houses and streets. [..] However, among the discomforts surrounding the paradise of Gabès are the epidemics that often afflict it, and the various illnesses that plague its inhabitants. The cause of this, according to its people, is the abundance of oleander trees, which exude poison into the water as it flows, giving it bitterness and venom that harm the bodies of those who live there. For this reason, many of the faces of its people appear yellowed. In this city, there is also a decay, due to the large amount of rottenness. The only water sources that remain pure are the well known as the &quot;Well of the Prince,&quot; and the other one called the &quot;Well of Salam.&quot; The water from these wells remains untainted because it does not flow through the oleander trees. The first well is attributed to a well-known Azdi prince, known as Ibn Al-Saghir.&quot;Victor Guérin, in 1862, described the city as:Gabès is not, strictly speaking, a compact city enclosed within a single perimeter, but rather a collection of two towns and several villages that together form a single oasis, watered by the Wadi of Gabès. The two main towns are named Djara and Menzel, and among the villages, the most notable is Ghenneni.

== Climate ==
Gabès has a hot arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), bordering upon a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), characterised by hot summers and pleasant winters. Rainfall is low throughout the year and negligible during the hot summer.

== Tourism ==

===Main sights===
Gabès is famous for its traditional Souqs in Jarah; it is known also for its attractive beach and the unusual seaside oasis (Gabès is located on the coast of the Mediterranean).

The most visited place in Gabès is the town Matmata.

<text>Grove Park is a district of South East London, England within the London Borough of Lewisham. It is located north east of Bromley and south east of Lewisham.

Known for its green spaces, Grove Park is flanked by the Grove Park Nature Reserve and Northbrook Park, and Downham Fields to the west, Horn Park to the East, as well as Chinbrook Meadows, Kings Meadow and Sundridge Park to the south. As well as these there are various sports grounds and fields.

==Name and toponymy==
There was a farm named &quot;Grove Farm&quot;, where &quot;Sometrees Avenue&quot; is now located, around north of Grove Park railway station. &quot;Grove Farm&quot; appeared named on maps from at least 1870, and it is thought this farm gave its name to &quot;Grove Park railway station&quot;, &quot;Grove Park Road&quot;, the road built to join Grove Park to Mottingham, and also gave its name to Grove Park itself. It is presumed the word &quot;Grove&quot; in the place name was simply derived from a grove of trees that existed in the area. Grove Park railway station opened in 1871; The name &quot;Grove Park&quot; referring to the station, appeared on maps from at least 1884, but the name &quot;Grove Park&quot; referring directly to the place itself appears on maps slightly later, from as early as 1896.

==History==
The area was developed as a London suburb in the 1870s. More development grew up around Grove Park railway station in the 19th century, though there had been settlements located here since Celtic times. Much of it consists of a housing estate built by the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham in the 1920s.

A workhouse was built in the area in 1902. After use by the Army during the First World War it became Grove Park hospital. There are multiple public parks in the area, the largest of which is Chinbrook Meadows, through which the River Quaggy flows northward. The Quaggy runs through and joins the second park known as Mottingham playing fields (colloquially known as &#x27;Foxes&#x27;) which borders the neighbouring Mottingham area. Grove Park is also home to part of the Green chain walk, linking London&#x27;s green spaces as well as Elmstead woods.

In recent times the area has received increased investment with local services and roads seeing vast improvements and the area around the station being completely modernisied.

<doc id="1033729" wikidata="Q11178497" url="?curid=1033729" title="Huang Yuanyong">
<text>Huang Yuanyong (黃遠庸), (Pen name: Huang Yuansheng 黃遠生, Wade-Giles: &quot;Huang Yüan-yung&quot;) (15 January 1885 – 25 December 1915) was a renowned Chinese author and journalist during the late Qing dynasty (清朝) and early Republic of China (民國初年). Huang made significant contributions to journalism and literacy in China, particularly as an innovator in both journalistic methodology and writing style. His unsolved assassination while visiting San Francisco, California, United States, was suspected of having been a KMT operation.

== Early life ==
Huang Yuanyong (Given name: Huang Weiji 黃為基) was born to an educated family in Jiujiang (), Jiangxi Province () in China. His father was a scholar and an officer in charge of foreign affairs in Ningbo (), and a number of his family members were government officials. Influenced by his family, Huang immersed himself in Chinese classics when he grew up. To improve his English, his family hired a foreign tutor to teach him the language.

Huang completed secondary schooling in the Zhejiang () province. During his studies at &quot;Zhejiang Huxing Nanxun Government School&quot; (), he was involved in educational reform campaigns and became a member of the &quot;Progressive Party&quot; (). In 1903, Huang came in seventh place in the regional examination in Jiangxi (). Nevertheless, the 19-year-old Huang did not follow the custom of becoming a government official, instead continuing his legal study at Chuo University in Tokyo, Japan. Six years later, he returned to China and started working at the &quot;Civil Postal Department&quot; (). Later on, he became a journalist and worked for several different papers and news agencies. Huang was particularly famous for his discussions of politics and social issues.

== Life as a journalist ==

=== Background ===
Following the collapse of the Qing dynasty, Huang ceased his work as an officer in the new government of the Republic of China. Li Shengduo (), one of the Beiyang five ministers (), played an influential role for Huang. He advised Huang to enter journalism, saying that &quot;In western countries, the majority of journalists are familiar with history and international affairs. If you choose to work in this field, there is no doubt you will become a famous reporter.&quot; After receiving Li&#x27;s advice, Huang began his career as a journalist.

Huang soon won recognition for his abilities as a journalist. In 1912, the founding year of the Republic of China, Huang, Lan Gongwu () and Zhang Junmai (), who were known as &quot;The trio of youth for modern China&quot; (), first published &quot;Shao Nian Zhong Guo Weekly&quot; 《少年中國周刊》 to criticise politics. Later on, Huang and two other young journalists, Liu Shaoshao () and Ding Foyan (), were entitled &#x27;&quot;The outstanding trio of journalism&quot; ().

Huang was also regarded as &quot;The first genuine reporter in the modern context in China&quot; () and his &quot;Yuansheng Tongxun&quot; (), a special column of news dispatch, became the most popular and famous brand in Chinese journalism.

=== Contribution to newspapers and Magazines ===
Huang&#x27;s first job was to write articles for the &quot;Ya Shi Ya&#x27; Daily News&quot; () in Shanghai. The positions at newspapers and magazines that he later served include:

* &quot;Shen Bao&quot; () - newspaper reporter
* &quot;Shi Bao&quot; () - newspaper reporter
*&quot;Dong Fang&quot; Daily News () - newspaper reporter
*&quot;Shao Nian Zhong Guo &quot;Weekly () - founder and magazine editor
*&quot;Yong Yan&quot; () - magazine editor
*&quot;Dong Fang&quot; Magazine () - writer
*&quot;Lun Heng&quot; () - writer
*&quot;Guo Min Gong Bao&quot; () - writer

With his academic background and work experiences, Huang took up a number of roles in the field. He worked as a chief editor (), an appointed regional reporter in Beijing () and Shanghai, and a freelance article writer (). He was well known for being diversified and productive. In 1915, Huang&#x27;s clash with Yuan Shikai () eventually cost him his job. The news of Huang being shot to death in the United States shortly after his arrival shocked the press and literary circles of China.

=== Publications ===
Among Huang&#x27;s publications,&quot;Yuansheng yi zhu&quot; is a collection which consists of 239 pieces of his posthumous articles. It was published by Huang&#x27;s friend, Lin Zhijun (), after Huang&#x27;s death in 1919. From 1920 to 1927, four editions of this book were published by the Commercial Press of Shanghai (). It was the first collection of news articles in Chinese publishing history. Huang&#x27;s articles included news reporting, political analysis, and the like. The majority of Huang&#x27;s articles were reports of major events and influential people in the turbulent politics of China at the time.

His publications on political issues include:
*&quot;A Warning to the Trio Superpower&quot; 《對於三大勢力之警告》
*&quot;An Overview of Current Politics&quot; 《最近之大勢》
*&quot;Astray Official&quot; 《官迷論》
*&quot;Conflict between Traditional and Contemporary Thoughts&quot; 《新舊思想之衝突》
*&quot;New Year in Beijing&quot; 《北京之新年》
*&quot;Three Days&#x27; Astronomy&quot; 《三日觀天記》
*&quot;The Chef of the Ambassador&quot; 《外交部之厨子》

His other publications include:
* &quot;My Confession&quot; 《懺悔錄》
* &quot;Introspection&quot; 《反省》
* &quot;Passive Optimism&quot; 《消極之樂觀》

As a journalist, he interviewed many important figures of the time, including: 
*Sun Yat-sen ()
*Huang Xing ()
*Song Jiaoren ()
*Chang Taiyen ()
*Cai Yuanpei ()
*Yuan Shikai ()
*Li Yuanhong ()
*Tang Shaoyi ()
*Lu Zhengxiang ()
*Zhao Bingkwun ()
*Xiong Xiling ()
*Duan Qirui ()

Huang reported on many important events in China. For example:
*The assassination of Song Jiaoren ()
*The resignation of Yuan Shikai ()
*The signing of &quot;The Twenty-One Demands&quot; ()
*The resignation of Tang Shaoyi ()

=== Clash with Yuan Shikai ===
Huang initially supported the creation of the Republic of China under Yuan Shikai&#x27;s leadership. However, the new government became a great disappointment to Huang. He felt that despite the Progressive Party&#x27;s rhetoric it was still a corrupt organization.

In the articles entitled &quot;Big Loan Incident&quot; () and &quot;The Twenty-One Demands&quot; (), Huang described Yuan&#x27;s alleged secret deals with foreign powers and betrayal of the nation&#x27;s interest for his own sake. Huang once described the status of the government as &quot;idealess, dead-ended and hopeless&quot; (). However, what most upset Huang was the threat to the freedom of the press that he felt Yuan represented. Under Yuan, journalists were prohibited from attending political meetings () and the censorship of newspapers also became the custody of the Police Authority ().

Between 1912 and 1916 Yuan and his party extended their control over the news media, banning 71 newspapers and arresting more than 60 journalists. These events left Huang with a much more pessimistic view of the importance of journalism.

The incident which triggered the final clash of Huang and Yuan occurred in 1915. At that time, news media sympathetic to Yuan had been promoting his plan to revive the monarchic system in China. At first, he offered Liang Qichao () two hundred thousand dollars to write an article in favour of him, but Liang refused. Then he approached Huang due to Huang&#x27;s reputation. Yuan offered him ten thousand dollars to become a minister and the chief editor of &quot;Ya Shi Ya Daily News&quot; (), which was under his control. Still, Huang was unwilling to violate his principles as a journalist. Huang posted his announcement entitled &quot;My declaration of opposing the monarchic system and resignation from all positions of Yuan&#x27;s group of publishers&quot; 《黃遠生反對帝制並辭去袁系報紙聘約啟事》 in most major newspapers in Shanghai, including &quot;Shen Bao&quot; (). Huang published further similar announcements in several papers, including &quot;Shen Bao&quot; () and &quot;Shi Shi Xin Bao&quot; () to clarify his political break from Yuan.

Yuan maintained pressure on Huang by naming him chief editor of &quot;Ya Shi Ya Daily News&quot; against his will, a position which Huang rejected. Eventually, though, Huang tried to escape this political battle, devoting himself to further academic studies.

== Influence on China ==

=== Journalism ===
Huang&#x27;s writings were an important element in transforming traditional China into its modern form. Huang and other famous journalists such as Kang Youwei () and Liang Qichao () formed the &quot;Group of Journalists&quot; (), which played an important role in late Qing dynasty. As the educated ones, the group&#x27;s opinions towards the society would be released to the public so that the dark side of the nation could be disclosed, enhancing the public&#x27;s awareness of social issues. The group was undeniably a major breakthrough in China&#x27;s journalistic history.

Huang was most active before and after the Xinhai Revolution (). That period was a dark age for cultural development in China, with interference from the past and the present, China and the West. Huang showed his concern and worries in that period through his writings. Strictly speaking, there was nobody who would write as many articles as Huang did at that time.

Huang emphasized that a journalist should be equipped with four important abilities:

*The ability to think critically ()
*The ability to run () - to develop and broaden interpersonal network to enrich news sources
*The ability to listen () - to analyze and co-ordinate trivial pieces into consequence
*The ability to write () directly, without distortion

=== Literature ===

Many intellectuals such as Chen Duxiu () were influenced by Huang&#x27;s ideas. They organized and published &quot;New Youths&quot; 《新青年》 and &quot;New current of ideas&quot; 《新潮》, which were largely promoted in Shanghai. More than thirty articles in the two publications mentioned Huang&#x27;s name and his innovative ideas. One famous intellectual, Hu Shih (), even considered Huang as the &quot;First Voice&quot; of promoting a new type of literature in his book &quot;Wu shi nian lai zhi wen xue&quot; (Literature within fifty years) 《五十年來之文學》.

Huang has been regarded as the pioneer of the May Fourth Movement (). He termed the movement a &quot;Chinese Renaissance&quot; in 1915 before it had actually started. He advocated the &quot;Literary Enlightenment Movement&quot; () by promoting modern Chinese literature and introducing Western ideas to China. In his article, &quot;My Confession&quot; 《懺悔錄》, he argued that a prerequisite for the betterment of the society is to improve the personality and quality of citizens. (&quot;今日無論何等方面，自以改革為第一要義&quot;, 要改革國家).

=== Education ===
Although Huang achieved a good result in the Imperial Examination himself, he was highly critical of the system. Instead, he stated that after the collapse of the Qing dynasty, the examination system should also eventually be removed. Although new examination systems and schools were immediately introduced to China following the collapse, there were still a large number of people who gained nothing in the old system and could not fit into the new one. Huang argued that these people would become a threat to society.

=== Writing ===
Before becoming a journalist Huang immersed himself in writing literature, as classical Chinese literature was still popular in the late Qing dynasty. He was known for writing fluently, with major use of rhetoric and allusion.

However, Huang realized that news articles should be comprehensible enough to be read by many people and that the use of classical Chinese language might obstruct the flow of expression. He therefore decided to change his style of writing. By writing in simple and colloquial language, Huang&#x27;s articles magnified his critical and satirical attitude.

== Mystery of his death ==
Huang was assassinated while visiting San Francisco, United States on Christmas Day, 25 December 1915, at the age of 30.

The circumstances of Huang&#x27;s death remain a mystery, not only because there was political instability in China, but also because he was assassinated in San Francisco, far from his home. As a result, there are several possible explanations for the incident.

There were two versions of the story of the murder of Huang. One possibility is that Huang was shot by a killer sent by Yuan Shikai as payback for Huang&#x27;s opposition to Yuan&#x27;s monarchic system. Another version was that he was mistakenly assassinated by Liu Beihai (), a member of the Zhonghua Revolutionary Party (), which was later known as the Nationalist Party (). The Party suspected that Huang was indeed working for Yuan, and his purpose for visiting the U.S. was to promote the monarchic system. However, there is still not enough evidence to prove that Huang&#x27;s death was related to Yuan, even today.

The date of Huang&#x27;s assassination has also been called into some doubt. In the introduction of &quot;Yuansheng yi zhu&quot; 《遠生遺著》, a posthumous collection of Huang&#x27;s articles, Lin Zhijun () recalled that he had heard the news on the night of 27 December 1915, and gives this date as the day of Huang&#x27;s death. However, some scholars, including Li Shengduo (), believed that Huang was indeed killed on 25 December, as the date the news came did not necessarily have to be the day of the assassination. Therefore, generally, it has been accepted that the date of Huang&#x27;s death was 25 December 1915.

<doc id="1033732" wikidata="Q955961" url="?curid=1033732" title="Rossington">
<text>Rossington is a civil parish and former mining village in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England and is surrounded by countryside and the market towns of Bawtry and Tickhill.

==Geography==
Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it has a population of 13,255, increasing to 13,557 at the 2011 Census. Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield is around two miles to the east. The village is demarcated to the north and west by a line of 400 kV pylons, as seen from the M18, to the north. The Finningley and Rossington Relief Road Scheme – from Junction 3 of the M18 to Parrot&#x27;s Corner (junction of the A638 and the B6463 roads) – is proposed to allow access to the airport. Construction was due to start in late summer 2012 though initial site clearance work only commenced in early 2013.

To the north-west, the village borders Loversall, with the boundary following the River Torne, passing directly next to the western edge of the former Rossington Main Colliery. It briefly crosses the M18 at the point where the motorway crosses the East Coast Main Line. At this point it meets the Borough of Doncaster and follows Mother Drain, then the River Torne, north of Torne Valley Farm. It passes by a Roman fort and crosses the A638 at Rossington Bridge, north of Rossington Bridge Farm. At Wheatcroft Farm it meets Finningley. Nearby at the junction of the A638 and B6463, there is a park and ride car park. The boundary passes along the west of Hurst Plantation, and meets the A638, a former Roman road, at Warren House Farm. Following the A638 at Mount Pleasant Hotel, it meets Austerfield. In the south-east of the parish is the Northern Racing College (for horse racing), next to Rossington Hall School. At Bawtry Forest, it meets Bawtry. Crossing the B6463 at New England Cottages, it meets Tickhill. At Stancil Bridge, it meets the River Torne and Wadworth.

===Places of worship===
The village has a number of churches of different denominations: St. Michael&#x27;s Church (Rossington Parish Church); St. Lukes&#x27;s Church (New Rossington Parish Church); Rossington Methodist Church; Christ the King Roman Catholic Church; New Life Christian Centre; and Rossington Community Baptist Church at Holmescarr Community Centre

===Education===
The village has several schools, including: St. Michael&#x27;s CE Primary School; St. Joseph&#x27;s RC Primary School; Tornedale Infant School; Pheasant Bank Junior School; Grange Lane Infant School; and Rossington All Saints Academy. Rossington Hall, which became a boarding school for &quot;educationally subnormal&quot; children in 1953, closed in 2008. Former councillor and Labour Party politician Caroline Flint owned 77 acres on the 3,000 acre Rossington Hall site in 2008.

==History==
There are remains of both a Roman fort and Roman pottery kilns in the area. The name Rossington translates from the old Anglo-Saxon name of &#x27;Farm on the Moor&#x27;. In later times, Rossington housed a small village and both Rossington Hall and Shooters Hill Hall. Until the reign of Henry VII, the Rossington area was in Nottinghamshire as the River Torne was part of the boundary between Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.

===New Rossington, (Old) Rossington, Littleworth, Hesley, Rossington Bridge and Shooters Hill===
The area known as &quot;Rossington&quot; is made up of a number of villages and hamlets, namely &quot;Hesley&quot;, &quot;Littleworth&quot;, &quot;Rossington&quot;, &quot;New Rossington&quot;, Rossington Bridge and Shooters Hill. The village of Littleworth was mentioned in the Doomsday book and was enlarged to a great degree in the 1970s, when Littleworth Park Estate was built. Doncaster city council removed the &quot;Littleworth&quot; sign at the junction of Littleworth Lane and Station Road in the late 1990s for renovation. The new village began to be built around the time of the sinking of the colliery. Rossington Bridge, although now only consisting of a few buildings is the oldest of the six settlements; situated on the crossing of the Roman road from Lincoln (Lindvm) to York (Ebvrscvm) via Doncaster (Danum) it was once the site of a major Roman fort (the largest between Lincoln and York). Rossington Bridge was also an important staging post on the Great North Road.

After the colliery closed, Rossington saw the building of large levels of new, private housing, particularly around the &quot;Old Village&quot;, raising the village&#x27;s affluence. Locally, the village is known as &quot;Old Village&quot; and &quot;New Village&quot; but local estate agents use the term &quot;Old Rossington&quot; when actually referring to The Original village of Rossington.

===Colliery===
It was, however, in the mid-20th century that saw the largest expansion of the area. The pit was sunk between 1912 and 1915. The need for workers in and around the Rossington Main Colliery led to the building of large numbers of houses near to the pit in what was called New Rossington. After the end of British Coal in the early 1990s, the mine was able to keep operating and became one of the last in the area to keep producing coal albeit at a greatly reduced scale. However, with the decline of the mine, the village suffered high levels of unemployment and poverty throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. The colliery closed briefly between 1993 and 1994 before finally closing in 2007. In 2012 a coal reclamation project started on the Rossington Colliery spoil tip, this was expected to take up to 5 years to complete.

In September 2012 planning permission was given by the borough council to build a £100 million, 1,200 home, housing development including a primary school and hotel on the colliery site. Construction of houses on the site began in May 2015.

===Rail transport===
The &#x27;Old Village&#x27; and &#x27;New Village&#x27; are separated by the East Coast Main Line. There are only two crossing points over the railway between the old and new villages: the road bridge on Stripe Road and the level crossing where West End Lane becomes Station Road. Rossington railway station was closed for regular services in 1958 but a few special trains stopped there until the late 1960s. The station buildings and platforms remained in place until the early 1980s, when the platforms, to the south of the level crossing, were dug up, and the old signal box that stood on the north east side of the crossing was demolished. A few years earlier, the signalling had been automated, and control of the crossing had moved to Doncaster PSB. When the old signal box was in operation, the crossing was controlled by a large set of wooden gates, which were operated by the signalman who had to leave the signal box and open and close the gates by hand. By the mid-1950s, these gates were opened and closed by a large wheel in the signal box. These gates were replaced by automated barriers controlled from Doncaster PSB at the same time as the signal box was closed; however, some older residents of Rossington still refer to the crossing gates. The only surviving building is the old station cottages, which stand on the north west side of the crossing and are now private dwellings.

In the first decade of the 21st century a plan was proposed for an &#x27;eco town&#x27; of over ten thousand homes, to the southwest of Rossington, the plan was opposed by the majority of Rossington residents, and was reduced in scope by the end of the decade; a related industrial development proposed as part of the plan was a large scale intermodal rail terminal which received wider support and was given planning consent in 2011 with construction expected to take place over two years starting 2012, with continued development over eight years. The rail terminal is to be built west of the Rossington Colliery site.

===Sport===
Rossington Main Football Club was formed in 1919 as Rossington Colliery, originally playing behind the colliery offices in New Rossington, before moving to their current home at the end of Oxford Street in 1921. In 1998 the club merged with the latterly formed Rossington F.C. (formerly Station F.C.), and the new Rossington Main F.C. currently play in the Northern Counties East League.

Rossington is the home to the &#x27;RASCALS&#x27; swimming team based at Rossington Sports Centre. Rossington Swimming Club was founded in June 1966.

Rossington has a long history of local junior and senior cricket. Rossington Main Cricket Club has three senior teams which mix youth and experience; these teams play on a Saturday and Sunday. The cricket club also has junior teams from the under 11s, under 13s, under 15s and under 17s.

==Twinned Towns==
Rossington is twinned with McCleary in Washington State, United States.

<doc id="1033742" wikidata="Q7760112" url="?curid=1033742" title="The Religion War">
<text>The Religion War () is a 2004 novel by &quot;Dilbert&quot; creator Scott Adams, and the sequel to his novella &quot;God&#x27;s Debris&quot;. This book takes place right before the last chapter of that book. Adams has asserted that it is his two religion-themed novels, and not &quot;Dilbert&quot;, that “will be his ultimate legacy.”

==Plot summary==
The delivery boy from the first book, who is now the Avatar, must stop an epic clash of civilizations between the Western world, led by Christian extremist General Horatio Cruz, and the Middle East, led by Muslim extremist Al-Zee. To accomplish this task, the Avatar decides to find the &quot;Prime Influencer&quot;, a person who, he feels, can indirectly influence all the decisions people make by virtue of responsibility, from fashion to the election of the President. He attempts to do so by enlisting a talented and arrogant programmer at Global Information Corporation (G.I.C.) (an all-encompassing, world-wide future sort of T.I.A. created out of fear of terrorism) to analyze G.I.C.&#x27;s massive databases. Also, people&#x27;s phones are, in the name of preventing terrorist communications, restricted to only calling certain contacts a person has that have been approved by the Department of Communications; this fact ultimately comes back in the book&#x27;s climax.

The Avatar applies his unparalleled ability to identify developing patterns and accurately determine the most probable results of a situation to accurately predict the war plans of both Cruz and Al-Zee. He subsequently uses his ability to recognize even the vaguest patterns (which makes him seem to know more than he actually does) to bypass guards, escape interrogations, and ultimately win an audience with the warring leaders.

Ultimately, the Avatar fails to stop the coming of the war. However, at the conclusion of the book, the Prime Influencer, who turns out to be an opinionated café owner whom the Avatar had met previously by chance, launches a simple, yet catchy, phrase (&quot;If God is so smart, why do you fart?&quot;) that spreads throughout the world like a virus thanks to an advanced computer worm, named Giver-of-Data (G.o.D.), launched by the G.I.C. programmer shortly before his death, which unlocked everyone&#x27;s phones, linked them to automatic translation systems, and disabled call-billing. According to the story, &quot;Once you heard it, you could never forget it.&quot; It was this phrase that finally captured the collective imaginations of ordinary people, causing them to reevaluate the basis of their notions of a god. This ultimately led to the elimination of fundamentalist religious practices throughout the world, which, in turn, resulted in the end of the Religion War.

==Reception==
One review observes:

Another notes: “In this frenetically paced sequel to Adams’ best-selling “thought experiment,” &quot;God’s Debris&quot;, the smartest man in the world is on a mission to stop a cataclysmic war between Christian and Muslim forces and save civilization.”

<doc id="1033743" wikidata="Q1073882" url="?curid=1033743" title="On the Beach (Neil Young album)">
<text>On the Beach is the fifth studio album by Canadian-American musician Neil Young, released by Reprise Records in July 1974. It is the second of the so-called &quot;Ditch Trilogy&quot; that Young recorded following the massive success of 1972&#x27;s &quot;Harvest&quot;, and reveals the artist grappling with feelings of over-exposure, alienation and melancholy.

==Background==
Looking back on the album for the liner notes to the &quot;Decade&quot; box set, Young wrote of &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;: &quot;This song put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.&quot; Recorded after (but released before) &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;, &quot;On the Beach&quot; shares some of that album&#x27;s bleakness and crude production — which came as a shock to fans and critics alike, as this was the long-awaited studio follow-up to the commercially and critically successful &quot;Harvest&quot;. It hinted towards a more subtle outlook, particularly on the opening track, &quot;Walk On&quot;. 

As happened with &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;, &quot;On the Beach&quot; under-performed commercially but went on to attain high regard from fans and critics alike. Both albums were recorded in a haphazard manner, with a variety of session musicians often changing their instruments while Young offered basic arrangements for them to follow. He chose rough, monitor mixes of songs rather than a more polished sound, alienating his sound engineers in the process. Throughout the recording process, Young and his colleagues consumed a homemade concoction dubbed &quot;honey slides&quot;, a goop of sauteed marijuana and honey that &quot;felt like heroin&quot;, at the behest of session musician and &quot;de facto&quot; producer Rusty Kershaw. This may account for the mellow mood of the album, particularly on its second half. 

While the original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review described &quot;On the Beach&quot; as &quot;one of the most despairing albums of the decade&quot;, later critics, including Allmusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann, used the benefit of hindsight to conclude that Young was in fact &quot;saying goodbye to despair, not being overwhelmed by it&quot;. Neil Young concluded: &quot;Good album. One side of it particularly — the side with &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot;, &quot;Motion Pictures&quot; and &quot;On the Beach&quot;. It&#x27;s out there. It&#x27;s a great take.&quot;

==Writing==
&quot;On the Beach&quot; is a folk rock album exploring themes of anger, alienation, and cautious optimism.

&quot;Walk On&quot;, the album&#x27;s opener, has Young combining his melancholy outlook with a wish to move on and keep living. In the liner notes to &quot;Decade&quot;, Young describes the song as: &quot;My over defensive reaction to criticisms of &quot;Tonight&#x27;s The Night&quot; and the seemingly endless flow of money coming from you people out there.&quot;

The social commentary &quot;See the Sky About to Rain&quot; dates from &quot;Harvest&quot;. It had been covered by The Byrds a year earlier on their eponymous reunion album. 

&quot;Revolution Blues&quot; was inspired by Charles Manson, whom Young had met in his Topanga Canyon days, about six months before the Tate–LaBianca murders. David Crosby and Young&#x27;s other bandmates objected to playing the song live. &quot;Man, they didn&#x27;t know if they wanted to stand on the same stage as me when I was doin&#x27; it. I was goin&#x27;, &#x27;It&#x27;s just a fuckin&#x27; song. What&#x27;s the big deal? It&#x27;s about culture. It&#x27;s about what&#x27;s really happening. In a 1985 interview, Young recalled meeting Manson and being spooked by him: 

&quot;For the Turnstiles&quot; is a country-folk hybrid featuring Young&#x27;s banjo guitar and a harmony vocal from Ben Keith, who also plays dobro on the track. The lyrics critique the music industry, with Young later stating in the &quot;Decade&quot; liner notes: &quot;If statues could speak and Casey was still at bat, some promoter somewhere would be making deals with Ticketron right now.&quot;

The side closes with &quot;Vampire Blues&quot;, a cynical attack on the oil industry, and side two opens with &quot;On the Beach&quot;, a slow, bluesy meditation on the downsides of fame.

&quot;Motion Pictures&quot; is an elegy for Young&#x27;s relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress, which was falling apart. Young remembers in &quot;Waging Heavy Peace&quot;: &quot;We were all high on honey slides... A couple of spoonfuls of that and you would be laid-back into the middle of next week. The record was slow and dreamy, kind of underwater without bubbles.&quot; The song was written in a Los Angeles hotel room while watching TV. Kershaw described the song&#x27;s genesis: &quot;We didn&#x27;t work every day, we only worked when we felt really inspired. Me and Ben and Neil were sittin&#x27; in Ben&#x27;s room. Neil started hummin&#x27; somethin&#x27;, and I started playin&#x27; along with the melody on the steel. Ben started playin&#x27; bass, it sounded so goddamn pretty. Neil picked up a pen and just wrote the words right then and put that motherfucker down while it was still smeared all over us.&quot;

&quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; closes the album. In a 1992 interview for the French &quot;Guitare &amp; Claviers&quot; magazine, Young said that song was based on &quot;Needle of Death&quot; by Bert Jansch, who he said was on a par with Jimi Hendrix: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t even aware of it, and someone else drew my attention to it.&quot; It explores Young&#x27;s feelings about his critics, Richard Nixon, and the state of CSNY. The line, &quot;You&#x27;re all just pissing in the wind&quot;, was a direct quote from Young&#x27;s manager Elliot Roberts regarding the inactivity of the quartet. The song also references the Riverboat, a small coffeehouse in Toronto&#x27;s Yorkville neighbourhood which was an early venue for folk-inspired artists like Gordon Lightfoot, Bruce Cockburn, Joni Mitchell, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and Arlo Guthrie. The line, &quot;Oh, Isabella, proud Isabella, they tore you down and plowed you under&quot;, references 88 Isabella Street, an old rooming house in Toronto where Neil and Rick James stayed for a period. It was demolished in the early 1970s and an apartment now stands on its location. Young confirms in a 2023 post to the &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; section of his website that the verse about the man who tells so many lies was indeed written for Richard Nixon.

==Recording==
Most of the album was recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood in late March and early April 1974. Two tracks, &quot;Walk On&quot; and &quot;For the Turnstiles&quot; were recorded months prior at Young&#x27;s ranch. David Briggs fell ill and missed most of the sessions. Sideman Ben Keith took the lead in recruiting Rusty Kershaw and members of The Band to play on the album. Members of both Crazy Horse and CSNY also contributed to the sessions.

Young recorded several new songs at his ranch in November and December 1973. These included &quot;Winterlong&quot; from &quot;Decade&quot;, &quot;Borrowed Tune&quot; from &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;, demos of &quot;Traces&quot; and &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; as well as new attempts at &quot;Bad Fog of Loneliness&quot;, &quot;Human Highway&quot;, and &quot;Mellow My Mind&quot;. The sessions also produced the album tracks &quot;Walk On&quot; and &quot;For the Turnstiles&quot;. Ben Keith humorously remembers recording the latter song on dobro and banjo with Young and pushing his vocal abilities to the limit: &quot;I&#x27;d sing these off, weird harmonies, and Neil&#x27;d go, &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s cool—do that.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t know I could sing that high—I still can&#x27;t. I must&#x27;ve been sittin&#x27; on a crack and got my balls in there.&quot;

The remaining sessions were held at Sunset Sound, where Young had previously recorded with Buffalo Springfield and Crazy Horse. The mood of the sessions was heavily influenced by the honey slides, creating a very melancholy, depressed atmosphere. Additionally, Young was at the time realizing that his relationship with Carrie Snodgress was disintegrating. Rusty Kershaw insisted on taking a relaxed approach to recording, rejecting the need to rehearse the material beforehand. He explains in &quot;Shakey&quot;: 

Dissatisfied with their complacent performances, Kershaw managed to motivate the other musicians to inject extra energy and unease into the recording of &quot;Revolution Blues&quot; through wild behavior and crazy antics in the studio: &quot;I said, &#x27;Look, man, you don’t sound like you&#x27;re tryin&#x27; to start a fuckin&#x27; revolution. Here&#x27;s how you start that.&#x27; And I just started breakin&#x27; a bunch of shit and Ben jumped right in there. I said, &#x27;That&#x27;s a revolution, muth&#x27; fucker.&#x27; Goddamn, that sparked Neil right off. He got it on the next take.&quot;

==Album cover==
The album cover was designed by art director Gary Burden with photography by Bob Seidemann. It features Young facing the ocean at Santa Monica Beach with an umbrella and a 1959 Cadillac sticking up out of the sand. Young wrote in &quot;Waging Heavy Peace&quot; that it is one of his favourite covers, the idea of which came like &quot;a blot from the blue&quot;: 

==Release==
In addition to its release on vinyl, &quot;On the Beach&quot; was also released on cassette and 8-track cartridge, though the track listing for the latter formats was the reverse of that on the vinyl album. It remained unavailable on CD until 2003, when a remastered version was finally released. It has since been re-released as Disc 2 of the 4-CD box set &quot;Neil Young Original Release Series Discs 5-8&quot;. The album is also available in high-resolution audio on the Neil Young Archives website, where four additional album outtakes were added in February 2021.

Originally Young had intended for the A and B sides of the LP to be in reverse order but was convinced by David Briggs to swap them at the last moment. Young has said that he later came to regret caving in, although both the cassette and 8-track versions were released with the sides swapped.

For about two decades, rarity made a cult out of &quot;On the Beach&quot;. The title was deleted from vinyl in the early 1980s and was only briefly available on cassette and 8-track cartridge tape, or European imports or bootlegs. Along with three other mid-period Young albums, it was withheld from re-release until 2003. The reasons for this remain murky, but there is some evidence that Young himself did not want the album out on CD, variously citing &quot;fidelity problems&quot; and legal issues. Beginning in 2000, over 5,000 fans signed an online petition calling for the release of the album on CD. It was finally released on CD on Reprise Records in August 2003.

==Promotion==
Young did not tour behind the album, instead joining CSNY for their Summer 1974 large stadium tour, chronicled in the 2014 live album &quot;CSNY 1974&quot;, where the group played &quot;Walk On&quot;, &quot;Revolution Blues&quot; and &quot;On the Beach&quot; and Young would perform &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; solo acoustic. Prior to the tour, Young would also play a widely bootlegged solo acoustic set at The Bottom Line in New York, where he would debut the album&#x27;s songs and famously share his recipe for honey slides.

==Reception==

Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;Something in [Young&#x27;s] obsessive self-examination is easy to dislike and something in his whiny thinness hard to enjoy. But even &#x27;Ambulance Blues,&#x27; an eight-minute throwaway, is studded with great lines, one of which is &#x27;It&#x27;s hard to know the meaning of this song.&#x27; And I can hum it for you if you&#x27;d like.&quot;

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed it #65 on their list of the Top 100 Albums of the 1970s. &quot;On the Beach&quot; was certified gold in the United States, selling 500,000 copies. In 2007, &quot;On the Beach&quot; was placed at #40 in Bob Mersereau&#x27;s book &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Albums.&quot; It was voted number 195 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; in 2000. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the album at number 311 on their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, writing: &quot;Reeling from the losses that sparked &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; the previous year, Neil Young shelved that album for a while and made this one instead: a wild fireball of anger (“Revolution Blues”), nihilism (“For the Turnstiles”), and tentative optimism (“Walk On”). The album peaks on Side Two, a stoned symphony of grieving whose three songs (“On the Beach,” “Motion Pictures,” “Ambulance Blues”) are among the most emotionally real in Young&#x27;s catalogue.&quot;

<doc id="1033745" wikidata="Q984138" url="?curid=1033745" title="Quorn, South Australia">
<text>Quorn is a small town and railhead in the Flinders Ranges in the north of South Australia, northeast of Port Augusta.

Quorn is the home of the Flinders Ranges Council local government area. It is in the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey.

With its picturesque setting and heritage-listed buildings, the town is known for tourism and as a filming location, as well as being the terminus of the Pichi Richi Railway.

== History ==

The town was surveyed by Godfrey Walshin 1878 as part of the preparations for building the railway line from Port Augusta northwards. It was named by Mr J.H.B. Warner whose family lived in Quorn, Leicestershire, England. At the time, he was employed as private secretary to the Governor of South Australia.

The railway line from Port Augusta to Quorn opened in 1879 and was subsequently extended north to Government Gums (Farina) in 1882, Marree in 1884, Oodnadatta in 1890 and Alice Springs in 1929. This railway line later became known as the Great Northern Railway and later the Central Australia Railway.

In 1917, Quorn became the crossroads of any north–south (on the Central Australian Railway to Oodnadatta) or east–west travel in Australia, when the Trans-Australian Railway was completed between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. This made Quorn an important town, given that any person travelling east–west or north–south in Australia would need to pass through Quorn. As a result, many fine buildings were built as the town expanded.

Quorn&#x27;s role as a crossroads was lost when a standard gauge railway connection was opened between Port Pirie Junction and Port Augusta in 1937, meaning east–west trains bypassed Quorn. However, during World War II, Quorn was a vital service point for trains heading north to Alice Springs and carried over 1,000,000 troops heading to Darwin and on to Papua New Guinea. Trains services through Quorn peaked at over 50 per day during and immediately after the period of World War II. Services during this time also included coal mined at Leigh Creek being moved to the newly opened Playford A Power Station in Port Augusta.

During the 1950s a new standard gauge line was built that passed on the western side of The Dutchmans Stern, Mount Arden and Mount Eyre, from Stirling North to Brachina and then roughly following the original narrow gauge route through Leigh Creek and to Marree, thus bypassing Quorn. This bypass took away the last railway traffic through the Pichi Richi Pass, and the last major freight traffic through Quorn. The only services left operating through Quorn were freight between Peterborough and Hawker. As a result, Quorn&#x27;s importance diminished and eventually in 1980s the railway was completely closed as the last freight was moved to road transport. One unusual aspect of the railway working from Peterborough to Quorn and then on to Hawker was the need for the engine to be turned and attached to the opposite end of the train when arriving at Quorn, as it was not a &quot;through&quot; station for the trip from Peterborough to Hawker.

In 1973, a group of railway enthusiasts assembled with the desire to preserve the unique bridges and stone work built in the previous century that formed the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass between Quorn and Stirling North. Thus the Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society was formed. Although the intention was to just preserve the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass, they later acquired operable railway rollingstock and locomotives and today provide a tourist railway service through the Pichi Richi Pass from Quorn to Port Augusta. There is at least one book by preservationists showing the line in its heyday.

==Tourism==

A main attraction in Quorn is Flinders Gin Distillery and the Pichi Richi Railway. There are also self-guided walking tours in the town, including several based around the town&#x27;s historic old buildings, the railway yards and other historic locations. There are a number of hotels, takeaways and cafés in town.

In mid 2020 The Flinders Ranges Council installed signage outside the historic buildings for historic and tourist information. The Flinders Ranges Visitor Information Centre / Pichi Richi Railway in the Quorn railway station has a museum, and provides visitor information including workshop tours, bookings for travel on the railway, accommodation information, heritage self-guided walking maps and souvenirs.

The Heysen Trail and the Mawson Trail, a pair of long-distance trails dedicated respectively to walking and cycling, pass through town and there are many bushwalks and four-wheel drive tracks.

Quorn is a stopover for many travellers coming from Adelaide to explore the Flinders Ranges. The tourist office is in the Quorn Railway Station provides free information, maps and trails to safely see the best sites in the Flinders, including Warren Gorge, Kanyaka Station, Proby&#x27;s Grave and Itali Itali.

The grain silos in the Quorn railway yards are viewing area for a nightly film showing the local history or Quorn and surrounds and on display every evening after dark. This is an open-air and free event.

Quorn has also been the location for several popular films, including &quot;The Shiralee&quot;, &quot;Sunday Too Far Away&quot;, &quot;Gallipoli&quot;, &quot;Wolf Creek&quot;, &quot;The Sundowners&quot;, &quot;The Lighthorsemen&quot; and &quot;The Last Ride&quot; starring Hugo Weaving. In 2014 Russell Crowe directed &quot;The Water Diviner&quot;, using the Pichi Richi Railway for the railway scenes.

<text>The Repatriation flight program, officially named &quot;Interior Repatriation Program&quot;, was a United States and Mexico government program destined to fly back Mexican citizens who had illegally crossed the frontier between the United States and Mexico to their home country for free.

Arizona taxpayers funded the program. It ran from July 12 to September 30 of 2004. It was a pilot program; other American states planned to develop similar programs. The total number of Mexicans repatriated was over 14,000.

According to United States Border Patrol officials, the program was created to help save lives of those that crossed the desert. They were usually caught by border patrol police in southern Arizona towns or near the Sonora border, processed, and taken to Tucson International Airport for their flights back home.

Airplanes used in these operations were all Boeing 757 jets.

The program was ultimately stopped because of cost: tax-payers ended up paying US $15 million during the three-month trial period, amounting to US $1,000 for each passenger. According to the border patrol police, the program helped the number of immigrant deaths around the Tucson area drop by 28 percent, but statistics showed that Arizona had a record number of immigrant deaths in 2004, with 171 dead persons accounted for.

Immigrants caught and flown back to Mexico would usually be taken back to Guadalajara, Jalisco, or Mexico City International Airport in Mexico City. Despite the harsh conditions of travelling by foot from Mexico to the United States border, a survey run at Mexico&#x27;s largest international airport by a North American newspaper showed that 50 percent of those returned to Mexico by air would be willing to try to return to the United States illegally again.

<doc id="1033757" wikidata="Q2281671" url="?curid=1033757" title="Rufus Wainwright (album)">
<text>Rufus Wainwright is the debut studio album by Canadian-American singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright, released in the United States on May 19, 1998, through DreamWorks Records. It was produced by Jon Brion, with the exception of &quot;In My Arms&quot;, which was produced and mixed by Pierre Marchand, and &quot;Millbrook&quot; and &quot;Baby&quot;, which were produced by Brion and Van Dyke Parks. Lenny Waronker was the executive producer.

Wainwright was signed to the DreamWorks label in 1996 after Waronker heard the demo tape he recorded with Marchand. Over the course of two years, Wainwright and Brion recorded 56 songs on 62 rolls of tape at a cost that exceeded $700,000. These were then narrowed down to twelve tracks for the album. No singles were released from &quot;Rufus Wainwright&quot;, though Sophie Muller directed the music video for &quot;April Fools&quot;, which featured Wainwright in Los Angeles attempting to prevent the deaths of opera heroines. To support the album, Wainwright toured throughout the United States and Canada following its release.

Overall, reviews for the album were positive. Though it failed to chart in any country, Wainwright reached number 24 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart (which highlights sales by new and developing musical recording artists) and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Wainwright the Best New Artist of 1998. &quot;Rufus Wainwright&quot; also earned him recognition from the Gay &amp; Lesbian American Music Awards, the GLAAD Media Awards, and the Juno Awards. The album was released in Japan with the bonus track &quot;A Bit of You&quot;, and later in 2008 in LP form through the record label Plain Recordings.

==Background==
Wainwright, born into a musical family which included parents Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle and sister Martha Wainwright, began touring in his early teens with his family throughout Canada, Europe, and the United States. At age fourteen, his song &quot;I&#x27;m a Runnin, written for the 1988 Canadian film &quot;Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller&quot;, earned him a Genie Award nomination for Best Achievement in Music – Original Song and a Juno Award nomination in 1990 for Most Promising Male Vocalist of the Year.

Wainwright attended McGill University in Montreal for a short time to study Classical music composition. With his mother&#x27;s support, he began writing pop songs and learned how to play guitar. Wainwright started performing at the night club Sarajevo, and eventually recorded a demo tape with record producer Pierre Marchand, a family friend, who had worked with Kate and Anna and who later produced Wainwright&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Poses&quot;. Songs were recorded at Marchand&#x27;s studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec, and no edits were made to the simple live tunes. The tape impressed Wainwright&#x27;s father, who passed the songs along to producer Van Dyke Parks, who in turn presented them to DreamWorks executive Lenny Waronker. Waronker had signed McGarrigle to Warner Bros. Records in the 1970s. Wainwright acknowledged that having musicians as parents gave him a &quot;foot in the door&quot;, but attributed his success to hard work.

==Development==
Wainwright was signed to DreamWorks in 1996. Waronker paired him with producer Jon Brion, and together they spent &quot;most of 1996 and 1997&quot; recording 56 songs on 62 rolls of tape. Costs for the recording sessions reached between $700,000 and $1,000,000. Wainwright admitted that he and Brion took their time recording the album in Los Angeles, and considered the extended time a &quot;blessing&quot; and &quot;luxury&quot;, claiming that &quot;most people have two weeks to record their first album&quot;. According to Wainwright, Waronker &quot;didn&#x27;t care how long it took, as long as we were doing good work.&quot; Waronker was pleased with the final product, and he and Wainwright agreed on the twelve tracks that made up the album.

Songs on the album were produced by Brion, except &quot;In My Arms&quot; was produced and mixed by Marchand, and &quot;Millbrook&quot; and &quot;Baby&quot; were produced by Brion and Van Dyke Parks. Waronker served as the executive producer. &quot;Rufus Wainwright&quot; was recorded mostly in Los Angeles studios—Ocean Way studios 3 and 7, Sunset Sound Factory, Sunset Sound, Media Vortex, Hook Studios, Groove Masters, Red Zone, Sony, The Palindrome Recorder, and NRG Recording Services—although recording also took place in Marchand&#x27;s Wild Sky in Morin-Heights, Quebec. Parks conducted his orchestrations at Studio B in the Capitol Studios complex.

Wainwright and Brion did not always get along, the latter admitting to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Rufus had all these beautiful songs but every time the vocals would kick in, he&#x27;d write some complicated keyboard part so you couldn&#x27;t hear them. He wasn&#x27;t interested in listening to ideas about simplifying arrangements.&quot; The duo, with Ethan Johns, also contributed the songs &quot;Le Roi D&#x27;Ys&quot; and &quot;Banks of the Wabash&quot; (both &quot;contemporary&quot; cover versions) to the 1997 soundtrack to the film &quot;The Myth of Fingerprints&quot;. Johns later considered &quot;Le Roi D&#x27;Ys&quot;, recorded in around six hours, to be one of his favorite tracks by Wainwright.

&quot;Rufus Wainwright&quot; was released on May 19, 1998, through DreamWorks. Following the album&#x27;s release, which earned him mostly positive reviews, Wainwright contributed to &quot;The McGarrigle Hour&quot;, a 1998 album by Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle featuring family members Loudon and Martha along with singers Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt. In December 1998, Wainwright appeared in a Gap television advertisement in which he performed Frank Loesser&#x27;s 1947 song &quot;What Are You Doing New Year&#x27;s Eve?&quot; In 1999, he was one of several featured artists promoted by Best Buy as part of a campaign to promote young talent. The album was re-issued in 2008 in LP form through the record label Plain Recordings.

==Songs==
The &quot;neo-operatic&quot; opening track &quot;Foolish Love&quot;, arranged by Van Dyke Parks, was described by AllMusic contributor Matthew Greenwald as a &quot;lush, orchestral-soaked ballad, with incredible strings&quot;. He asserted that Wainwright&#x27;s lyrics took the form of a letter to himself, defining his goals and &quot;sense of purpose&quot;. The song &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, with its &quot;fabulous wordplay that stays literate and easy to understand at the time&quot;, contains &quot;subtle&quot; horn lines and sampled percussion. The song alludes to Wainwright&#x27;s homosexuality, which Greenwald considered a &quot;brave move&quot;. According to biographer Kirk Lake, &quot;Danny Boy&quot; is a companion piece to &quot;Foolish Love&quot; and together they represent the start and end of a relationship between a gay and a straight man. Danny, the straight &quot;drug-addled&quot; title figure with whom Wainwright had a three-year relationship, is the subject of both songs in addition to others on the album; he appears in the album&#x27;s collage artwork. Wainwright sings of being so blinded by love that he fails to notice the &quot;ship with eight sails&quot; threatening to come around the bend, a reference to Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s 1928 musical &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;.

The chorus in &quot;April Fools&quot; begins with an &quot;unusually upbeat attitude&quot; and was considered by Greenwald to be the most accessible track on the album. The song showcases Jim Keltner&#x27;s drum performance as well as Wainwright&#x27;s piano playing. Driven by Wainwright&#x27;s guitar playing, &quot;In My Arms&quot; was described by Greenwald as a &quot;forlorn&quot;, Spanish-influenced ballad that sounded as though it &quot;could have been recorded in France in the 1920s&quot;. The song &quot;Millbrook&quot; is an ode to his boarding school compatriots. Wainwright has admitted to being &quot;upset and drunk&quot; when recording the final take. &quot;Baby&quot;, which has been considered one of the most melancholic songs on the album, contains &quot;oddly placed&quot; and &quot;slightly quirky&quot; major seventh chords. Greenwald called the lyrics &quot;a stream-of-consciousness pleasure, relating the confusing and intoxicating emotions of young love&quot;.

&quot;Beauty Mark&quot; is an ode to Wainwright&#x27;s mother, the title referring to the beauty mark above her lip. The song is one of the few up-tempo tracks on the album and contains multiple keyboard overdubs by Brion. Chris Yurkiw of the &quot;Montreal Mirror&quot; considered the track to be the most moving love song on the album, with an &quot;overt and open-hearted&quot; reference to his homosexuality: &quot;I may not be so manly, but still I know you love me.&quot; Wainwright&#x27;s Summer Stage performance of &quot;Beauty Mark&quot; appears on his 2005 DVD &quot;All I Want&quot;. In &quot;Barcelona&quot;, Wainwright recalls a love affair that took place in the city of the same name. The song is loosely about AIDS and contains the Italian language lyric &quot;Fuggi, regal fantasima&quot;, taken from Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Macbeth&quot;. According to Wainwright, the line appears in a scene when &quot;Macbeth is going mad and sees the ghost, and in [Wainwright&#x27;s] mind the ghost was AIDS.&quot; &quot;Matinee Idol&quot; is about the rise and fall of an entertainment figure, inspired by the death of actor River Phoenix. According to Greenwald, the musical song has a &quot;1920s, cabaret musical feel&quot;.

&quot;Damned Ladies&quot; is a slow ballad about the &quot;beloved yet doomed ladies of opera&quot;. Wainwright said the following of &quot;Damned Ladies&quot;, which contains references to nine opera heroines: &quot;In the song, I lament how these women are constantly dying brutal deaths, which I can see coming but cannot stop. It gets me every time.&quot; Greenwald described &quot;Sally Ann&quot; as a 1920s love ballad of &quot;lost love and emotional regret&quot;. The melody in &quot;Imaginary Love&quot;, the album&#x27;s closing track, contains sixth and major seventh chords.

In Japan, the album was released with the bonus track &quot;A Bit of You&quot;. In May 2023, the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary, a remastered version was released with songs previously released on the 2011 box set &quot;House of Rufus&quot; plus three session outtakes. The track list consists of the original album plus the tracks: &quot;Hankering&quot;, &quot;Saint James Infirmary&quot;, &quot;More Wine&quot;, &quot;Fame Into Love Into Death&quot;, &quot;One More Chance&quot;, &quot;A Bit of You&quot;, &quot;Dreams and Daydreams&quot;, &quot;Miss Otis Regrets&quot;, &quot;So Fine&quot;, and &quot;Come&quot;. For the album&#x27;s cover, Wainwright recreated his original art using a photograph of him at age 50.

==Promotion==
Wainwright acknowledged that his debut album was &quot;not a single driven album&quot;; no singles were released from it. To promote the album, a music video was produced for the song &quot;April Fools&quot;. Directed by Sophie Muller, the video features Wainwright in Los Angeles &quot;amidst a clique of classic opera characters&quot; such as Madame Butterfly, attempting to prevent each of them from committing suicide. However, in each instance he arrives too late. The video also contains cameo appearances by No Doubt&#x27;s Gwen Stefani, a friend of Muller&#x27;s, and Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur, a high school acquaintance and former roommate of Wainwright&#x27;s. Part of the video was filmed in Stefani&#x27;s house.

Wainwright performed &quot;Beauty Mark&quot; on &quot;Today&quot;, the American morning news and talk show. He also taped an episode of MTV&#x27;s television program &quot;120 Minutes&quot; to promote the album, which aired on March 28, 1999. An advertisement in &quot;Billboard&quot; promoting the album also referred to appearances on &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and &quot;Sessions at West 54th&quot;.

In the year prior to the album&#x27;s release, Wainwright opened for artists such as Barenaked Ladies and Sean Lennon. On March 1, 1999, Wainwright began his first tour as a headlining act in Hoboken, New Jersey. During that month, Wainwright toured throughout New England and the mid-Atlantic states, Ontario (Ottawa and Toronto), Quebec (Montreal), the southern United States (Nashville, and Atlanta), and the midwestern United States (Cincinnati, Chicago, and Pontiac). Wainwright continued to tour throughout the month of April before heading to Europe. Stops were mostly along the West Coast, including four in California, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle. Three concerts were also held in western Canada, including Vancouver, Edmonton, and Calgary.
==Critical reception==

Reception of the album was positive. Speaking of second-generation artists emerging around the same time, AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Ankeny wrote that Wainwright &quot;deserves to be heard regardless of his family tree&quot;. Furthermore, Ankeny complimented the musician for his songwriting abilities and his &quot;knack for elegantly rolling piano melodies and poignantly romantic lyrics&quot;. Music journalist Robert Christgau characterized Wainwright as a &quot;mind-boggling original&quot; whose talent is &quot;too big to let pass&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Marc Weingarten found that the &quot;abiding, uncynical&quot; view of love expressed in Wainwright&#x27;s lyrics does not come off as &quot;mawkish&quot; due to his considerable skills as a songwriter and arranger. &quot;NME&quot; reviewer John Mulvey called the album &quot;floridly impersonal&quot; and &quot;grandiosely arranged&quot;, but also criticized Wainwright for being &quot;too overwrought and naff&quot;. Greenwald complimented Martha&#x27;s backing vocals on the song &quot;In My Arms&quot;, as well as Parks&#x27; &quot;positively sterling&quot; string arrangement on &quot;Millbrook&quot;. Furthermore, he praised the vocal duet between Rufus and Martha on &quot;Sally Ann&quot;, claiming that a similar sibling performance had not been heard since the Everly Brothers. The album&#x27;s cabaret elements and 1970s singer-songwriter style drew comparisons to Cole Porter and Joni Mitchell. Josh Kun of &quot;Salon&quot; wrote that Wainwright poetically incorporated &quot;foolish love and fantasy love, healing love and destructive love and love that makes you want to lose your sense of self just so you can find it again.&quot; Kun asserted that the songs were &quot;built on a similar set of angled melodies and hairpin turns of phrase&quot;, and that each &quot;succeeds as its own distinctly intimate portrait of emotion and desire.&quot;

Ann Powers, music critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, included the album at number five on her list of the Top 10 albums of 1998. The album was also included in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; 1998 Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll, which combined ballots from 496 critics. &quot;Rufus Wainwright&quot; was nominated four times by the Gay &amp; Lesbian American Music Awards, an organization that provided the foundation for the recognition of the excellence of LGBT artists. Wainwright received the award for Best New Artist, the album was nominated for Album of the Year, and &quot;April Fools&quot; was nominated for Video of the Year and Best Pop Recording. The GLAAD Media Awards, created by the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) to recognize and honor the mainstream media for their fair and accurate representations of the LGBT community, presented Wainwright with the award for Outstanding Music Album. At the Juno Awards of 1999, &quot;Rufus Wainwright&quot; earned Wainwright the Juno Award for Best Alternative Album.

==Commercial reception==
Album sales were limited—by March 1999 only 35,000 copies had been sold. In 2001, Michael Giltz of &quot;The Advocate&quot; wrote that Wainwright&#x27;s biggest sales boost came from the Gap advertisement rather than radio play. Despite low sales, Wainwright reached number 24 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named him 1998&#x27;s Best New Artist. The January 19, 1999 &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; showed that &quot;Rufus Wainwright&quot; spent nine weeks on CMJ Radio 200 reaching a peak position of number 52, five weeks on CMJ Code Radio reaching a peak position of number 42, as well as nine weeks on CMJ Triple A reaching a peak position of number 9.

<text>Jenny Wilhelms (born 1974) is a Finnish musician. She studied classical and folk music in many Nordic countries. She has been the lead singer of the innovative folk band Gjallarhorn from 1994. Later, according to her bio for her appearance at the 2011 Tampere vocal music festival, she &quot;specialises in vocal physiology for non-classical singers and teaches privately, gives masterclasses and works with choirs and ensembles&quot;.

Wilhelms is focused on the vocal and fiddling tradition in Scandinavia and has studied various Nordic folk music styles.

Wilhelms studied at the Malungs Folkhögskola (Dalarna, Sweden), the Mellersta Österbottens Konservatorium, (Karleby, Finland), The Sibelius Academy, (Helsinki, Finland), The Grieg Academy (Bergen, Norway), the World Academy of Music and Dance, Ireland, and the Conservatory of Keski-Pohjanmaa, Finland.
Wilhelms has arranged and composed folk music for choirs and vocal ensembles. Her four pieces, ordered for the 55th anniversary of the Flora Female Choir at the Åbo Academy, won the first prize in a Scandinavian Choir arranging competition in 1999.

Wilhelms has studied and taught the medieval ballads of Scandinavia, Finnish runo-chanting, Icelandic rímur chanting and Cow calling (&quot;kulning&quot;) from Sweden and Norway. All these elements can be found in Gjallarhorn&#x27;s music.

<text>Guido Calabresi (born October 18, 1932) is an Italian-born American jurist who serves as a senior circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He is a former Dean of Yale Law School, where he has been a professor since 1959. Calabresi is considered, along with Ronald Coase and Richard Posner, a founder of the field of law and economics.

== Early life and education==
Calabresi was born in 1932 in Milan, Italy. His father, Massimo Calabresi (1903–1988), was a cardiologist, and his mother, Bianca Maria Finzi-Contini Calabresi (1902–1982), was a scholar of European literature. Calabresi&#x27;s parents were active in the resistance against Italian fascism and eventually fled Italy, immigrating to the United States in 1939. The family settled in New Haven, Connecticut, and became naturalized American citizens in 1948. Guido&#x27;s older brother Paul Calabresi (1930–2003) was a prominent medical and pharmacological researcher of cancer and oncology. Calabresi&#x27;s mother descends from an Italian-Jewish family. He describes himself as a &quot;practicing Catholic&quot; who believes in God.

Calabresi graduated from Yale College in 1953 with a Bachelor of Science, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, in economics. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and spent two years at Magdalen College, Oxford, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree with first-class honours in 1955 (later promoted per tradition to Master of Arts). He then attended Yale Law School, where he was a notes editor for the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;. He graduated in 1958 ranked first in his class with a Bachelor of Laws, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;. 

Following graduation from law school, Calabresi served as a law clerk for United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Hugo Black from 1958 to 1959.

== Legal career ==
Calabresi had been offered a full professorship at the University of Chicago Law School in 1960. However, he joined the faculty of the Yale Law School upon completion of his Supreme Court clerkship, becoming the youngest ever full professor at Yale Law, and was Dean from 1985 to 1994. He now is Sterling Professor Emeritus of Law and Professorial Lecturer in Law at Yale.

Calabresi is a member of the Connecticut Bar Association and from 1971 to 1975 served as town selectman for Woodbridge, Connecticut.

Calabresi is, along with Ronald Coase, a founder of law and economics. His pioneering contributions to the field include the application of economic reasoning to tort law, and a legal interpretation of the Coase theorem. Under Calabresi&#x27;s intellectual and administrative leadership, Yale Law School became a leading center for legal scholarship imbued with economics and other social sciences. Calabresi has been awarded more than forty honorary degrees from universities across the world. He is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Calabresi&#x27;s former students include Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor, former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey, feminist legal scholar and law professor at the Universities of Michigan and Chicago Catharine MacKinnon, former White House Counsel Gregory Craig, legal scholar Philip Bobbitt, former Senator John Danforth, Harvard Law School professor Richard H. Fallon Jr., civil and human rights legal scholar Kenji Yoshino, torts scholar Kenneth Abraham, feminist international attorney Ann Olivarius, and torts scholar Catherine Sharkey. Calabresi, alone among Yale Law School faculty members, supported Thomas&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court.

== Federal judicial service ==
On February 9, 1994, President Bill Clinton nominated Calabresi as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated by Judge Thomas Joseph Meskill. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 18, 1994. He received his commission on July 21, 1994 and entered duty on September 16, 1994. Calabresi assumed senior status on July 21, 2009.

President Clinton is a 1973 graduate of the Yale Law School, although he never had Calabresi as a professor.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1985, Guido was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, the oldest and most prestigious award for American Catholics.

In 1992, Princeton University awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Laws.

In 2006, Yale created the Guido Calabresi Professorship of Law, with Kenji Yoshino serving as the inaugural professor of the endowed chair. Daniel Markovits is the current holder of the chair.

Calabresi is an Honorary Editor of the University of Bologna Law Review, a general student-edited law journal published by the Department of Legal Studies of the University of Bologna.

Calabresi is the author of four books and over 100 articles on law and related subjects.

* &quot;United States v. Calvin Weaver&quot;, 18-1697 (2nd Cir. 2021). In a case regarding an unwarranted police search of a Black man walking by, Calabresi was one of three dissenters who argued that the search violated the 4th amendment. The other two dissenters were Rosemary Pooler and Denny Chin. Calabresi explained that &quot;The majority begins its opinion by saying that this is an ordinary case of an ordinary police search. That, unfortunately, is all too true. But though ordinary, and very common, the facts of this case, and the fact that a strong majority made up of thoughtful judges comes out as it does, demonstrates beyond peradventure why this area of the law is so disastrous.&quot;
* &quot;Mujo v. Jani-King International, Inc.&quot;, 20-111 (2nd Cir. 2021). Calabresi dissented from a ruling that permitted a corporation to require employees to sign a contract giving the corporation power to take part of their salary despite Connecticut&#x27;s minimum wage laws.

==Personal life==
Calabresi married Anne Gordon Audubon Tyler, a social anthropologist, freelance writer, social activist, philanthropist and arts patron. Both received their primary education at the Foote School in New Haven, graduating in 1946 and 1948, respectively. Calabresi would continue on to receive his secondary education from Hopkins School, graduating in 1949. 

They reside in Woodbridge, Connecticut, and have three children. Anne Gordon Audubon Calabresi (Anne Calabresi Oldshue), a psychiatrist, graduated cum laude from Yale, attended medical school at Case Western Reserve University and completed residency at Harvard. Massimo Franklin Tyler (&quot;M.F.T.&quot;) Calabresi, a journalist with Time magazine, also graduated from Yale. Bianca Finzi-Contini Calabresi attended Yale as well, graduating summa cum laude, and has a Ph.D. in Renaissance literature from Columbia. Calabresi&#x27;s nephew, Steven G. Calabresi, is a Constitutional Law professor at Northwestern University and a co-founder of the Federalist Society.

Calabresi and his wife own an olive grove in Florence, Italy, where they produce olive oil each year. He is a fan of Inter Milan and the New York Yankees.

<text>Charles Manson Superstar is a documentary film about Charles Manson, directed by Nikolas Schreck in 1989.
Most of the documentary (the entire interview) was filmed inside San Quentin Prison. Nikolas and Zeena Schreck narrated the segments while images were shown, and music played in the background. There was brief footage of Spahn Ranch, and a short clip of James Nolan Mason being interviewed about the Universal Order, and Manson. Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Death and Resurrection,&quot; Bobby Beausoleil&#x27;s &quot;Lucifer Rising,&quot; Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypsis,&quot; Biff Rose&#x27;s &quot;Fill Your Heart&quot; (Tiny Tim&#x27;s version) and Anton LaVey&#x27;s &quot;The Satanic Mass,&quot; and Manson&#x27;s own songs &quot;Clang Bang Clang&quot; and &quot;Mechanical Man&quot; from the album &quot;&quot;, were played during the film.

The artwork for the poster was done by painter Joe Coleman.

==Transcript of raw footage of interview==

Memepool was founded in 1998 by Joshua Schachter and a number of the early contributors, making it one of the earliest weblogs. It was also one of the most popular early weblogs, with a reputation for strange and surprising links. It was maintained by Schachter and Jeff Smith. Schachter&#x27;s links collected for Memepool were the predecessor of a project that later became del.icio.us.

Unlike many weblogs, Memepool had no significant element of self-revelation by its authors. The website did not have a commenting system, but many of its links came from emailed submissions from readers.

==Shutdown==
On March 26, 2012, Memepool had its first posting since April 21, 2008, marking the longest hiatus in the blog&#x27;s history. The site has been unavailable since at least December 14, 2013.

<text>&quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; is a song by the English musician David Bowie, released as a single from his album &quot;Earthling&quot; on 14 October 1997 through Virgin Records. The song was co-written by Bowie and Brian Eno and originally recorded during the sessions for Bowie&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Outside&quot;; this version was released on the soundtrack of &quot;Showgirls&quot; (1995). The song was then remade during the sessions for &quot;Earthling&quot;, featuring rewritten lyrics, overdubs and transposed verses. An industrial and techno track, it presents a critique of America through the eyes of a stereotypical &quot;Johnny&quot; and is characterised by drum patterns, synthesisers, various loops and vocal distortions.

The maxi-single release contained six different remixes mostly created by Trent Reznor and his Nine Inch Nails band members; the V3 mix featured Ice Cube while the V5 mix was created by Photek. Reznor subsequently appeared in the music video, which reflected the song&#x27;s theme of a frightened European in an American city. The single was Bowie&#x27;s final single to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 until 2015, reaching number 66. Reznor&#x27;s V1 mix has since appeared on several compilation albums.

The song has received positive responses from critics and biographers. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it one of the 30 most essential songs of Bowie&#x27;s catalogue in 2016. Some American commentators later acknowledged the significance of the lyrics in the late 2010s. Bowie performed &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; frequently on his concert tours, live performances from which have been released on live albums. Reznor has performed the song live with Nine Inch Nails as well.

==Writing and recording==
&quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; was written by Bowie and Brian Eno and originally recorded during the sessions for Bowie&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Outside&quot;. According to biographer Chris O&#x27;Leary, recording took place in late 1994 at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland and the early weeks of 1995 at the Hit Factory in New York City. Titled &quot;Dummy&quot;, it featured different lyrics, such as &quot;I&#x27;m afraid of the &quot;animals&quot; instead of &quot;Americans&quot;&quot;. Eno recalled in 2016: &quot;I remember [David] recording &#x27;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&#x27; and saying, after one of the early takes, &#x27;No, [the &#x27;Dummy&#x27; character&#x27;s] got to be more self-doubting than that.&#x27;&quot; This version was intended for release on the soundtrack for the 1995 film &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; but was instead released on the soundtrack for the 1995 film &quot;Showgirls&quot;.

During the sessions for Bowie&#x27;s next album &quot;Earthling&quot; (1997), he decided to remake the song with his current band—guitarist Reeves Gabrels, pianist Mike Garson, bassist Gail Ann Dorsey and drummer Zack Alford. Bowie stated: &quot;That was something that Eno and I put together, and I just didn&#x27;t feel it fit &quot;Outside&quot;, so it didn&#x27;t go on it. It just got left behind. So then we took just the embryo of it, and restructured it with this band.&quot; Recording for the remake took place between August and October 1996 at Looking Glass Studios in New York City with engineer Mark Plati, who had extensive experience there. Plati and Gabrels were credited as co-producers while Bowie himself mostly self-produced. Regarding the remake, Plati explained: &quot;We pulled things off several different reels to make this new composite. It was quite a clean-up job, not the most enjoyable.&quot; Bowie revised the lyrics, changing &quot;Dummy&quot; to &quot;Johnny&quot;, and transposed verses while the band provided additional overdubs. Gabrels stated that he added fuzz boxes &quot;until I ran out&quot;.

==Composition==

In an interview with &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine in 1997, Bowie described the song as &quot;one of those stereotypical &#x27;Johnny&#x27; songs: Johnny does this, Johnny does that&quot;. The absurdist lyrics present a critique of America, in line with Bowie&#x27;s 1975 track &quot;Young Americans&quot;. Commentators have seen similarities between the song&#x27;s titular Johnny and the Johnny of the &quot;Lodger&quot; track &quot;Repetition&quot; (1979); while the Johnny of the former craves objects of status through self-entitlement, the Johnny of the latter emotionally abuses his wife due to his lower status. The song concludes with the revelation that &quot;God is an American&quot;, which biographer Marc Spitz considers an &quot;ironic jingoism&quot;.

Musically, reviewers have categorised it as techno, with author James Perone writing that it mixes various industrial and techno styles of the 1980s and 1990s. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Caroline Sullivan found the melody reminiscent of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; (1980), with a &quot;perky jungle percussion loop&quot;, ultimately creating &quot;a most singular fusion of rock and drum &amp; bass&quot;. Characterised by drum patterns, synthesisers, various loops and vocal distortions, O&#x27;Leary writes that the remake retained the original&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;laughing&#x27; hook&quot; and &quot;synth hook pinging around an E octave&quot;. Both the original and remake are also in the key of F major. Biographer Nicholas Pegg calls the remake &quot;darker&quot; and &quot;funkier&quot; compared to the original, while Spitz compares the track&#x27;s &quot;loud/quiet/loud anthem[ic]&quot; quality to the Pixies. Perone considers it &quot;richer&quot; than other &quot;Earthling&quot; tracks.

==Releases==
The original version of &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; was released on the &quot;Showgirls&quot; soundtrack on 26 September 1995. &quot;Earthling&quot; was released on 3 February 1997 on CD and LP formats through RCA Records in the UK, Virgin Records in the US, and Arista Records and its parent distributor BMG elsewhere. &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; was the eighth and penultimate track, between &quot;The Last Thing You Should Do&quot; and &quot;Law (Earthlings on Fire)&quot;.
Virgin issued &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; as a maxi-single in North America only on 14 October 1997, where it was backed by six remixes; the V3 mix featured guest vocals from rapper Ice Cube while the V5 mix was created by producer Photek. The project was instigated by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, continuing his and Bowie&#x27;s association following the Outside Tour. Reznor, who stated that he &quot;tried to make it a bit darker&quot;, stripped the production to its roots to create what biographer David Buckley calls &quot;an eerie, psychotic track&quot;. The ending result is an almost 40-minute project that, in Bowie&#x27;s words, was &quot;not just a remix [but] almost...an album piece in itself. I was absolutely knocked out when I heard what [Reznor] had done. It was great.&quot; Commercially, the single reached number 66 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and remained on the chart for 16 weeks, becoming Bowie&#x27;s biggest hit in the country since &quot;Day-In Day-Out&quot; ten years earlier. It was the final Bowie single to chart on the Hot 100 until the release of &quot;Blackstar&quot; in 2015. It also stayed in the Canadian top 50 for six months.

Reznor also starred as the titular Johnny in the Dom and Nic-directed music video, which was shot in New York City in October 1997 during the American leg of the Earthling Tour. Bowie explained that he chose the duo because they were &quot;making very interesting, quite hard-edged British videos at the moment. I felt it was important that it retained that outsider&#x27;s perspective of America&quot;. The video depicts Bowie as a man who is chased around the streets of New York by a stalker portrayed by Reznor, reflecting the song&#x27;s theme of a frightened European in an American city. Discussing his character, Reznor stated: &quot;They wanted a kind of &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; feel to the whole thing. That&#x27;s kind of what it&#x27;s based on. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m in my Travis Bickle outfit!&quot; According to Spitz, the video received heavy rotation on MTV, a first for Bowie in over a decade. It also earned Bowie a nomination for Best Male Video at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards.

O&#x27;Leary states that while the track has no &quot;definitive&quot; version, Reznor&#x27;s V1 mix is the most recognisable, which has appeared on the compilation albums &quot;Best of Bowie&quot; (2002), &quot;Nothing Has Changed&quot; (2014), and &quot;Bowie Legacy&quot; (2016). The &quot;Showgirls&quot; version, V1 mix and Plati&#x27;s &quot;Original Edit&quot; were included on the bonus disc of the &quot;Earthling&quot; expanded edition in 2004.

==Reception and legacy==
Reviewing &quot;Earthling&quot; on release, &quot;Mojo&quot;″s Andy Gill considered &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; the &quot;most direct&quot; track on the album. In another review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Mark Kemp considered the song &quot;a stuttering rocker&quot; that &quot;seems detached from the other songs&quot;. Upon release of the single, &quot;Billboard&quot; writers Larry Flick and Shawnee Smith praised Reznor&#x27;s remix as an improvement on the &quot;already deeply moody and largely sharp&quot; original. They further opined that the Ice Cube remix could provide a successful foray into a hardcore hip hop album. Reviewing the maxi-single for AllMusic, Christian Huey criticised it as &quot;too derivative of &quot;Downward Spiral&quot;-era Nine Inch Nails&quot; to please Bowie&#x27;s fans. He argued that it acts better when viewed as a Reznor project rather than a Bowie one. He nevertheless praised Reznor&#x27;s work on the remixes as well as Photek&#x27;s contribution.

In later decades, Pegg describes the track as &quot;terrific&quot; while Spitz considered it Bowie&#x27;s finest single since 1984&#x27;s &quot;Loving the Alien&quot;. Following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; one of the 30 most essential songs of Bowie&#x27;s catalogue. That same year, &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; placed &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; at number 23 in a list ranking every Bowie single from worst to best, calling it the best song on &quot;Earthling&quot; and Bowie&#x27;s best song in over a decade, further commenting: &quot;It would be another decade and a half before he was this good again.&quot; A year later, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; placed &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; at number 66 on their list of Bowie&#x27;s 70 best songs, writing:

In 2017, &quot;Vice&quot;″s Jill Krajewski commented on the song&#x27;s relevance during the presidency of Donald Trump, stating: &quot;&#x27;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&#x27; has a darker resonance today not through its chorus, but in a context that gives it unnerving prescience: a snapshot of the [era we live in today].&quot; She argued that the &quot;working-class everyman&quot; (Johnny) were responsible in sharpening the political divide and widespread hate on the internet, presenting a sense of unease living in America as she concludes, &quot;I &quot;am&quot; afraid of Americans&quot;. The same year, Lior Phillips of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; said &quot;The title is a picture-perfect distillation of what it means to live in this world.&quot;

==Live versions==
Following its release, Bowie performed &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot; frequently on concert tours and television appearances. He first performed the track ahead of &quot;Earthling&quot;″s release on 9 January 1997 at his fiftieth birthday concert in New York City with the band Sonic Youth. The song then made regular appearances throughout the Earthling Tour later that year. Three separate live performances of the song were released on live albums included in the box set &quot;Brilliant Live Adventures&quot; (2020–2021): A July 1997 performance (released on &quot;Look at the Moon!&quot;), an October 1997 version recorded in New York (included on &quot;LiveAndWell.com&quot; (1999/2021)), and a version from the Hours Tour in November 1999 on &quot;David Bowie At The Kit Kat Klub (Live New York 99)&quot;.

Bowie performed the song again at Howard Stern&#x27;s forty-fourth birthday concert in 1998. Bowie&#x27;s 25 June 2000 performance of the song at the Glastonbury Festival was released in 2018 on &quot;Glastonbury 2000&quot;. Another live version, recorded at the BBC Radio Theatre, London on 27 June 2000, was released on the bonus disc accompanying the first releases of &quot;Bowie at the Beeb&quot; in 2000. A performance from his 2003 A Reality Tour was included on the &quot;A Reality Tour&quot; DVD (2004), and later on the &quot;A Reality Tour&quot; album (2010). Reznor has performed the song live with Nine Inch Nails as well.

<doc id="1033788" wikidata="Q3074271" url="?curid=1033788" title="Scotch pie">
<text>A Scotch pie is a double-crust meat pie, traditionally filled with minced mutton (whereby also called a mutton pie) but now generally beef, sometimes lamb. It may also be known as a shell pie to differentiate it from other varieties of savoury pie, such as the steak pie, steak and kidney pie, steak-and-tattie (potato) pie, and so forth. The Scotch pie originated in Scotland, but can be found in other parts of the United Kingdom and abroad.

== Consumption ==

Scotch pies are often sold alongside other types of hot food in football grounds, traditionally accompanied by a drink of Bovril, resulting in the occasional reference to football pies. They are also often served hot by take-away restaurants and bakeries and at outdoor events. The hard crust enables it to be eaten by hand with no wrapping.

== Ingredients and design ==

The traditional filling of mutton is often highly spiced with black pepper and other ingredients and is placed inside a shell of hot water crust pastry. It is baked in a round, straight-sided tin, about 8 cm in diameter and 4 cm high, and the top &quot;crust&quot; (which is soft) is placed about 1 cm lower than the rim to make a space for adding accompaniments such as mashed potatoes, baked beans, brown sauce, gravy or an egg. Typically, there is a round hole of about 7.5 mm in the centre of the top crust.

== Competition ==

Every year, since 1999, Scottish Bakers, a trade association, hold the World Championship Scotch Pie Awards. The winner of the Scotch pie section of the competition is judged to be the World Champion.

<text>Amos Biwott (born 8 September 1947) is a former Kenyan long-distance runner, winner of the 3000 m steeplechase at the 1968 Summer Olympics.

Biwott was the first of a long line of Kenyan runners who starred in the 3000 m steeplechase since Biwott&#x27;s surprising win at the 1968 Olympics; he pioneered the black Africa&#x27;s dominance at the long-distance running. Biwott had only three steeplechase races before the Olympics, and his technique was unorthodox. Instead of placing one foot on the barrier and springing off, he cleared the obstacle in one leap, and in this way reduced the clearance time by half. He was the only runner to finish with completely dry feet in both the Olympic qualifying heat and the final, which he won by 0.6 seconds ahead of compatriot Benjamin Kogo.

Biwott never won an international championship after the 1968 Olympics. He finished third at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games, was sixth at the 1972 Summer Olympics and completed his career with an eighth place at the 1974 British Commonwealth Games. He then worked for the Kenya Prisons Service until 1978, when he was prosecuted for theft. After that he worked as a watchman at a stadium.

Biwott is married to Cherono Maiyo, one of the first Kenyan women to compete at the Summer Olympics. They married in 1973 and have five children.

<doc id="1033792" wikidata="Q4483293" url="?curid=1033792" title="Fethard-on-Sea">
<text>Fethard-on-Sea or Fethard () is a village in southwest County Wexford, Ireland. It lies on the R734 road on the eastern side of the Hook peninsula, between Waterford Harbour and Bannow Bay. The village is in Fethard civil parish and partly in Fethard townland.

The village had a population of 311 as of the 2016 census. It lies in the Fethard electoral district in the Wexford constituency. It is in the Templetown parish in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns. Its main industries are fishing and tourism.

==Public transport==
Two Bus Éireann routes serve Fethard-on-Sea: route 370 to Waterford via New Ross and a Tuesday-only route 373 to Wexford via Wellingtonbridge.

== History ==
In the 12th century, Baginbun near Fethard was the site of Norman landings during the Norman invasion of Ireland. The remains of Norman-era earthworks and fortifications may be seen at Baginbun Bay, south of Ingard Point.

A 12th-century castle was built by Raymond le Gros, which passed to the Bishop of Ferns and was used as an episcopal residence. There is little evidence of the castle today.

Alexander Devereux, the 16th-century bishop of Ferns and Abbot of Dunbrody, is buried in St. Mogue&#x27;s Church of Ireland church.

Fethard was granted a charter by James I, and became a municipal borough, with the parliamentary borough of Fethard sending two members to the Irish House of Commons until its dissolution in 1801. The seats were in the control of the Marquess of Ely. In 1798, a harbour, was built and this was a landing site for French troops during the Irish Rebellion of 1798.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution opened Fethard Lifeboat Station in 1886. Nine of the volunteer crew were killed while trying to save the crew of a Norwegian ship that had run aground at South Keeragh Island on 20 February 1914. The survivors of both crews were marooned on the island for two nights before they could be rescued. The lifeboat station was then closed but reopened in 1996 as home to an inshore lifeboat.

==Village name==
Long known simply as &quot;Fethard&quot;, the village became known as Fethard-on-Sea following events in 1914 when the lifeboat &quot;Helen Blake&quot; capsized. Nine of the lifeboat&#x27;s fourteen-man crew were drowned during a service mission to the schooner &quot;Mexico&quot; off the Keeragh Islands. There was an outpouring of sympathy for the village and charitable donations were posted from around the world. To avoid this post from being misdirected to Fethard, County Tipperary, the name of the Fethard in County Wexford was reputedly changed to better distinguish the two.

==Local businesses==
There are three public houses in the village, a grocery shop and a number of cafes, B&amp;B and a hotel that was refurbished and reopened in 2019. Local tourist attractions include Hook Head Lighthouse and Loftus Hall, further afield on the Hook Peninsula.

== Fethard-on-Sea boycott ==

In May 1957, Roman Catholic villagers (&quot;incited by the local curate&quot;) boycotted Protestant-owned local businesses in response to the actions of a Protestant woman, Sheila Cloney, who had left her Catholic husband and the village, to avoid being obliged to send her children to the local Catholic school. The boycott received national and international attention before it concluded. The family was reconciled, with the daughters being home-schooled.

A film was made about the Cloney family and boycott. Released in 1999, &quot;A Love Divided&quot; starred Orla Brady and Liam Cunningham. A review of the film by the American Catholic League organisation questioned the film&#x27;s depiction of the Catholic Church in Ireland.

<doc id="1033798" wikidata="Q728573" url="?curid=1033798" title="Nick McCarthy">
<text>Nicholas John McCarthy (born 13 December 1974) is an English-German musician. His main focus is on songwriting and song production. He is also a guitarist, singer and keyboard player.

McCarthy was the rhythm guitarist, backing/lead vocalist, and keyboardist of the Glasgow-based band Franz Ferdinand until 2016.

==Life==
McCarthy was born in Blackpool, England. He grew up in Vagen near Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The artist Anna McCarthy is his younger sister. As a teenager he stole a car with friends and since then has been nicknamed &quot;McCarThief&quot;. He graduated from High School in Bad Aibling and was trained classically as a pianist and double bassist at the Munich Conservatory.

On 2 July 2005, McCarthy married his Austrian fiancée Manuela Gernedel in Bavaria, Germany. Franz Ferdinand turned down a Live 8 spot so that the pair could marry. They have two children. 

==Musical career==

Before his breakthrough with Franz Ferdinand, Nick McCarthy was a member of the bands Kamerakino and the jazz band Scatter. He also played double bass, cello and Arabic lute in the band Embryo, whose music is described as a &quot;fusion of jazz, rock and ethnic world music&quot;.

He is active in numerous bands and music projects and works as songwriter and producer at &quot;Flokati Studios&quot; in Munich as well as at &quot;Sausage Studios&quot; in Hackney Lane in London.

The Flokati Studios, founded in 2020, are where Nick McCarthy works with the musician Mario Schönhofer among others. He co-founded Sausage Studios with Sebastian Kellig in 2012.

=== Franz Ferdinand ===
In 2001 McCarthy moved to Glasgow. There he met vocalist and lead guitarist Alex Kapranos at a party. The two met up with Paul Thomson who had played drums with The Yummy Fur. With the addition of Bob Hardy, the band became Franz Ferdinand. Although McCarthy was classically trained on the piano and double bass, he initially tried his hand on drumming but then became the band&#x27;s rhythm guitarist, keyboardist, backing vocalist and (co-)songwriter.

McCarthy left the band in 2016 to focus on family matters and other musical projects.

=== Nitsch ===
Together with actor Niklas Mitteregger and producer and mixer Emin Corrado McCarthy forms the band Nitsch.

It´s his latest band project. They have been signed to the German label Staatsakt since 2022.

Their debut single &quot;Mutant Funk&quot; was released in July 2022. Musically, the song is described by the label as &quot;high-energy indie rock with Suicide&#x27;s electro twist.&quot; The single &quot;Is ok&quot; followed in November 2022. They released their latest single &quot;Ende der Welt&quot; in Spring 2023. The debut album is planned for Fall 2023.

=== Ströme x Nick McCarthy ===
In 2022, Nick McCarthy collaborated with the band Ströme. Together they released the singles &quot;Right Now&quot;, &quot;Stadlberg&quot; and &quot;Das Modul&quot; on Compost Records. In these songs they used the legendary modular synthesizer Moog IIIp, the same machine the Beatles used to record some of their greatest songs in the 1960s.

=== Das Lunsentrio ===
Together with Seb-I Kellig (among others dub producer for LaBrassBanda) and the berlin artist Hank Schmidt in der Beek, Nick McCarthy forms the band &quot;Das Lunsentrio&quot;. Their first album &quot;Der Lunsen-Ring&quot; was self-published in 2011. In 2017 they released their second album &quot;Aufstehn!&quot; on the label Problembär Records. The album was recorded and produced at East London&#x27;s Sausage Studios. It encompasses a musical palette &quot;from sweaty post-NDW to lyrically surreal agitprop three-part and protest funk in the musical tradition of the band Ton Steine Scherben to alpenglowy rockers reggae.&quot;

Most recently, the album &quot;69 Arten Den Pubrock Zu Spielen&quot; was released in 2021 on Tapete Records.

=== The Nix ===
The Nix is a project by Seb Kellig and Nick McCarthy. Together with a variety of guest vocalists (including Laetitia Sadier from Stereolab, KT Tunstall and Vula Malinga from Basement Jaxx) they recorded their debut album &quot;Sausage Studio Sessions&quot; in 2020. It was released on the label Moshi Moshi Records and produced at their East London Sausage Studios. McCarthy says about &quot;Sausage Studio Sessions&quot; this is an album he always had in mind to record after leaving Franz Ferdinand. Something that felt at the same time like farewell and a new start party incorporating all the amazing musicians and people he met around the world. The songs, he said, were written collectively and very spontaneously with the artists who came by Sausage Studios, and the whole record was recorded with a backing band, Motown Style on party nights.

=== Manuela ===
Under the name &quot;Manuela&quot;, McCarthy and his wife Manuela Gernedel released the eponymous indie pop album &quot;Manuela&quot; on Lost Map Records in 2017. It was created at the Sausage Studios in London. Gernedel is described as the creative main force behind &quot;Manuela&quot; in an interview by the cultural magazine The Skinny. While she wrote the lyrics for the songs, McCarthy composed the music for them.

=== Box Codax ===
In 2003, McCarthy and his long-time friend Alexander Ragnew formed the band Box Codax. They released their first two singles, &quot;Boys and Girls&quot; and &quot;Naked Smile&quot; on the label The Thin Man (previously known as Thin Man Records). The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Only An Orchard Away&quot; was released on 4 September 2006. McCarthy&#x27;s wife makes several appearances on the album. The band released the album on the label Gomma Records. In a review the music is described as &quot;a collection of weird, whimsical and nostalgic songs - sometimes rough, sometimes punky.&quot;

In May 2011, Box Codax released their second studio album called Hellabuster, which Nick McCarthy wrote and produced. The album is an eccentric take on the peculiar and young life of Hellabuster, with each song being accompanied by its own video. The music on Hellabuster moves between distorted disco, post-punk and glam-prog and includes contributions and appearances by Mike Fraser, Joseph Mount, Metronomy, Paul Thomson and many more. The videos for the songs, which were directed by British artists (including Turner Prize winner Martin Creed), contributed to the critical acclaim of the eccentric album. All video episodes of Hellabuster are freely available.

<doc id="1033810" wikidata="Q4958522" url="?curid=1033810" title="Bray Lock">
<text>Bray Lock is a lock and weir on the River Thames in England near Bray and Dorney Reach, and is just above the M4 Bridge across the Thames. The lock is on the Buckinghamshire side of the river on the opposite bank from Bray itself and Maidenhead which are in Berkshire. Here, the county line stands roughly halfway between the lock and the opposite bank, following the course of the Thames itself. The pound lock was built by the Thames Navigation Commission relatively late, in 1845. The lock keeper&#x27;s cottage is on an island (Parting Eyot) between the lock and the weir.

The weir is almost level with the lock and runs straight across to the opposite bank from the other side of the lock island.

==History==

There was a mill recorded on the site in the Domesday book and in 1328 there was a reference to &quot;Richard atte Lock of Bray&quot; occupying a weir called Braibrok. Fifty years later in 1377 there are records of travellers complaining of the excessive tolls at a flash lock on the site called Hameldon Lock. Both the lock and the weirs were removed in 1510 by order of the Commissioner of Sewers.

In 1622 a new flash lock was built by Thomas Manfield and presence of water pens is noted in 1632. Navigation may in earlier times have used York Stream which went on the other side of Bray to Maidenhead. A pound lock and weir were first proposed in 1833 for the &quot;improvement of navigation two or three miles above&quot;. The fall between Maidenhead and Boveney was large, leading to shallows and a strong current. The towpath was on the Buckinghamshire bank, and navigation on the Berkshire side, so tow ropes had to pass across the island. The suggestion of a lock was made again in 1843 and a lock house built on Parting Eyot with an open-sided lock the following year. The miller contributed to the cost of the weir. The lock was often left open except when river levels were low and no tolls were collected. Sides were added before 1877 and the lock and weir were rebuilt in 1885. Prior to the rebuilding Charles Dickens had described Bray Lock as a &quot;rotten and dangerous structure&quot;.

==Incidents==
On 2 August 2015, a privately owned cabin cruiser carrying four adults and four children suffered a catastrophic explosion of its propane canisters, caused by the ignition of fuel that had accidentally been poured down a waste pipe. Six of the eight people involved, including a three-year-old boy, were rushed to St. George&#x27;s Hospital in London and John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxfordshire by Air Ambulance for treatment. Another man suffered minor injuries, but was treated at the scene. Members of the public, including the Lock keeper, assisted in the efforts, evacuating the injured from the destroyed boat onto a hire craft for triage.

==Reach above the lock==

Immediately above the lock is Headpile Eyot. Bray is on the Berkshire bank while the Buckinghamshire bank has open fields. Further along the reach is Brunel&#x27;s Maidenhead Railway Bridge, known as the &quot;Sounding Bridge&quot; from the spectacular echo underneath it. The Maidenhead bank is lined with large Edwardian houses up to Maidenhead Bridge beside which is the Skindles Hotel once a notorious rendez-vous for illicit coupling.

Along the banks of the reach are multiple mansions and boathouses, many of which have been or are owned by high-profile British Celebrities such as Michael Parkinson and Rolf Harris.

Above the bridge are the islands of Bridge Eyot and Grass Eyot before Boulter&#x27;s Lock with Taplow on the Buckinghamshire side.

Maidenhead Regatta takes place below the railway bridge in August, and is followed by the annual Thames Punting Championships. The Maidenhead Junior regatta is held in May.

<text>Revesby railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the East Hills line, serving the Sydney suburb of Revesby. It is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T8 Airport &amp; South Line services.

==History==
Revesby station opened on 21 December 1931 when the line was extended from Kingsgrove to East Hills. In 1956 a crossing loop was opened.

On 9 December 1985, the line from Revesby to East Hills was duplicated with a new track laid to the north of the existing one. The line from Kingsgrove to Revesby was duplicated around the same time.

The Rail Clearways Program saw the station&#x27;s role change significantly, with plans to considerably boost capacity of the East Hills line by creating two centre turnbacks at the station to replace a side turnback at East Hills, and quadruplicating the line from Kingsgrove to Revesby.

In 2006, construction commenced on a second island platform and a replacement footbridge. Platform 3 opened in December 2008, as the main platform to the west. The existing Platform 2 became a centre turnback with only a few services initially using the facility. In October 2009, a new timetable was introduced, and Revesby replaced East Hills as the major intermediate terminus.

In April 2013, as part of the quadruplication of the line from Kingsgrove to Revesby, Platform 4 opened.

==Platforms and services==
==Transport links==
U-Go Mobility operates four bus routes via Revesby station, under contract to Transport for NSW:

<text>Cleveland &quot;Big Cat&quot; Williams (June 30, 1933 – September 10, 1999) was an American professional boxer. A poll in &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine rated him as one of the finest boxers never to win a title.

==Early life==
Born in Griffin, Georgia, Williams started working at a pulpwood mill at the age of 13, and began his professional boxing career in his home state just a year later. He reported winning four of his first six fights, but was barred from competing until he turned 18 after an official learned of his age.

==Early boxing career==
Williams turned professional in 1951 and fought many of the best heavyweights of his era. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the 6 ft 2 in Williams was a top-rated heavyweight. His quest to obtain a title fight, however, was consistently derailed. First he was knocked out by Sonny Liston on April 15, 1959. Williams recovered from the Liston fight to score more wins, but was again stopped by Liston in two rounds in their rematch on March 21, 1960. His quest for the title was later stalled when he was held to a draw by Eddie Machen on July 10, 1962, and when he dropped a split decision on March 13, 1963, to Ernie Terrell, a fighter he had previously knocked out in seven rounds in 1962. During this time frame, he defeated Billy Daniels.

==Police shooting incident==
On the evening of November 29, 1964, during the height of the civil unrest of the American Civil Rights Movement, a car driven by Williams was stopped near Houston, Texas, by highway Patrolman Dale Witten, who stated afterwards Williams was speeding. According to the police report Williams resisted arrest, and the officer&#x27;s .357 magnum revolver went off during an ensuing struggle, hitting Williams in the stomach and lodging in his right hip. Williams underwent four operations over the subsequent seven months to address injuries to his colon and right kidney. The right kidney ultimately had to be removed in June 1965. Doctors could not extract the bullet, which had broken his right hip joint and caused partial paralysis of some of the hip&#x27;s muscles, over of his small intestine had to be removed, and nerve damage affected his left leg above the knee and caused it to atrophy as a result. Hugh Benbow, his manager, and Sonny Liston, former world champion, visited Cleveland Williams in the hospital. After his partial recovery Williams was fined $50 and briefly jailed after pleading no contest to charges arising from the incident. (Patrolman Witten visited Williams to wish him luck the day before his 1966 fight with Muhammad Ali, with both men saying they had &quot;no hard feelings&quot; toward the other).

==Recovery and return to boxing==
The injury, surgeries and subsequent convalescence caused Williams to lose over 60 pounds (27 kg), and over 17 months of his career. He regained his weight and strength by tossing 80-pound (36 kg) bales of hay daily on a cattle ranch till he had regained his fighting weight and physique. On February 8, 1966, Williams received a standing ovation from the Houston crowd as he returned to the ring, and knocked out Ben Black in the first round.

Williams competed for the heavyweight championship against Muhammad Ali on November 14, 1966, but was badly outclassed, and was knocked down twice in the third round ending the match. Williams retired from boxing after the 1966 Championship defeat, but later made a comeback. Although able to defeat journeymen fighters, he suffered several knockout losses before retiring permanently in 1972.

==Later life==
&quot;The Ring&quot; in the 1980s reported he worked as a forklift truck driver in his later years.

==Death==
On September 3, 1999, Williams was knocked down by a car in a hit and run while walking across a street in Houston, Texas; he died of his injuries at Ben Taub Hospital on September 10, 1999,
at the age of 66. Williams was buried in Paradise North Cemetery in Houston.

==Tributes==
He ended his career with a record of 82 wins (62 KOs), 13 losses and 2 draws. During an interview after his retirement, George Foreman described Williams as having one of the three hardest punches he had experienced professionally, also stating that he and Williams had been sparring partners early in their careers. George Chuvalo also said Williams was one of the hardest punchers he had faced in his own professional career. Williams, aged 38, lost by decision to veteran Chuvalo over 10 rounds at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, in November 1971. Sonny Liston stated Williams was the hardest puncher he&#x27;d ever been in the ring with.

In 2003 Williams was ranked 49th in &quot;The Ring&quot;″s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

<doc id="1033824" wikidata="Q535313" url="?curid=1033824" title="Henry Sydney, 1st Earl of Romney">
<text>Henry Sydney, 1st Earl of Romney (March 1641 – 8 April 1704) was an English Army officer, Whig politician and peer who served as Master-General of the Ordnance from 1693 to 1702. He is best known as one of the Immortal Seven, a group of seven Englishmen who drafted an invitation to William of Orange, which led to the November 1688 Glorious Revolution and subsequent deposition of James II of England.

==Personal details==
Henry Sydney was born in Paris around March 1641, fourth surviving son of Robert Sydney, 2nd Earl of Leicester (1595–1677), and his wife Lady Dorothy Percy (died 1659). His brothers included Philip (1619–1698), who fought for Parliament during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, and Algernon (1623–1683), a political theorist closely associated with John Locke who was executed in 1683 for his part in the Rye House Plot. Another brother, Robert (1626–1668), served in the army of the Dutch Republic, and was a close companion of the exiled Charles II of England, although he fell from favour shortly before his death.

His eldest sister Dorothy (1617–1684) married Henry Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland (1620–1643), killed fighting for the Royalists during the First English Civil War; her son, Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland (1641–1702), was born in Paris a few months after Henry and the two men were close friends for most of their lives. From December 1685 to October 1688, Sunderland was Lord President of the Council under James II of England. Another sister, Lucy (circa 1626-1685), married Sir John Pelham, 3rd Baronet (1623–1703), MP for Sussex for most of the period from 1654 to 1695. A Whig who supported the Glorious Revolution, two of his grandsons served as Prime Minister.

Although Sydney had an illegitimate son, Henry Worthley, he never married; on 8 April 1704, he died of smallpox at his house in London and was buried a few days later in St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. His titles became extinct.

==Career==
Sydney was brought up at Penshurst Place, the family home in Kent and spent much of the period from 1658 to 1664 travelling in Europe with his nephew and contemporary, the Earl of Sunderland. On his return, he held a number of positions at court and in 1667 was commissioned as captain in the Holland Regiment, commanded by his brother Robert. He carried out a number of minor diplomatic missions in the 1670s and received his first significant office in 1678 when Charles appointed him Master of the Robes.

In early 1678, England re-entered the Franco-Dutch War as an ally of the Dutch Republic and Sydney was given command of a new regiment raised to fight in it. Although the war ended before he saw active service, he became friends with William of Orange; with the support of Sunderland, then Secretary of State for the Northern Department, in June 1679 he was appointed Envoy to the United Provinces, a position he held with marked success until 1681.

In October 1679, he was also elected as MP for Bramber in what is commonly called the &quot;Exclusion Bill Parliament&quot;. The central issue during this period was the attempt to exclude the Catholic Duke of York from the succession. Sydney was a &quot;Williamite exclusionist&quot;, one of those who supported exclusion but preferred William of Orange, son of a Stuart mother and married to James&#x27; eldest daughter Mary, rather than Charles&#x27; illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth. This ultimately led to his dismissal, although he was permitted to return to the Netherlands in 1682 and given command of one of the English regiments of the Dutch Anglo-Scots Brigade.

In 1683, Algernon Sydney was executed for his part in the Rye House Plot, an alleged conspiracy to assassinate Charles II along with his brother James, and place Monmouth on the throne. As William&#x27;s wife Mary was then heir to the English throne, he provided troops to help suppress the June 1685 Monmouth Rebellion. Sydney was thus able to balance his obligations as a loyal subject with acting as an informal contact point between William and his English supporters, as well as Sunderland, whom James appointed Lord President of the Council in 1685. The situation changed in June 1688 with the birth of a male heir, James Francis Edward Stuart; the prospect of a Catholic dynasty led to the Invitation to William. Signed by the Immortal Seven, representatives from the key political constituencies whose support William needed to commit to an invasion, it was drafted by Sydney, later described as &quot;the great wheel on which the Revolution rolled&quot;.

In August, he journeyed to The Hague and was appointed major general in the invasion force assembled by William that landed at Torbay on 5 November. In what became known as the Glorious Revolution, most of James&#x27; army changed sides and he escaped into exile in France on 23 December. Sydney was elected MP for Tamworth in the 1689 Convention Parliament that on 14 February made William and Mary co-monarchs in place of her father. On 4 April, he was created Baron Milton and Viscount Sydney, became a Privy Councillor and received a number of other offices, including Lord Lieutenant of Kent and Constable of Dover Castle. 

Sydney accompanied William in 1690 when he took personal charge of the war in Ireland; appointed colonel of the Foot Guards, he fought at the Boyne in July, as well as the sieges of Waterford and Limerick. Recalled to London in December 1690, he was appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department, before returning to Ireland as Lord Lieutenant in March 1692. Although his tenure was marked by conflict with the Irish Parliament and lasted less than a year, he retained William&#x27;s confidence; in 1693, he was made Master-General of the Ordnance, then promoted Lieutenant-General and created &quot;Earl of Romney&quot; in 1694. 

At the same time, he purchased the office of Chief Ranger of Greenwich Park, allowing him to use the Queen&#x27;s House as a personal residence. He undertook a series of improvements, one of which was to alter the course of the main road between Woolwich and Deptford, part of which is now called &quot;Romney Road&quot;. He remained a close advisor to William and accompanied him to The Hague for the negotiations that led to the signing of the Second Grand Alliance in September 1701. However, when William died and Queen Anne came to the throne in March 1702, he lost most of his offices and retired from active political life; he died of smallpox at his house in London on 8 April 1704, and was buried a few days later at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. 

==Legacy==

Sydney&#x27;s reputation has been subject to a variety of views; some contemporaries considered him lazy and superficial, while Tory satirist Jonathan Swift dismissed him as &#x27;an idle, drunken, ignorant rake, without sense or honour&#x27;. Other perspectives are more charitable and in general present him as &quot;an individual with flaws, but also remarkable for his even temper, straight dealing, good judgement, and a knack for gaining the trust of others&quot;.

It has been suggested the use of the &quot;pheon&quot;, or broad arrow, on government property dates from Sydney&#x27;s period as Master General of the Ordnance. However, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; argues &quot;this is not supported by the evidence&quot;, as the use of the device predates his association with the Board.
