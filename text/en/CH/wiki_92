<text>United Daily News (UDN; ) is a newspaper published in Taiwan. It is considered to support the pan-Blue Coalition in its editorials.

==History==
UDN was founded in 1951 by Wang Tiwu as a merger of three newspapers, &quot;Popular Daily&quot; (全民日報), &quot;National&quot; (民族報), and the &quot;Economic Times&quot; (經濟時報). The three newspapers formally merged in 1953. The newspaper is owned by Wang Tiwu&#x27;s daughter, Wang Shaw-lan. UDN is the flagship newspaper of the United Daily News Group which is chaired by Duncan Wang.

The evening edition of the paper, the &quot;United Evening News&quot;, was first published on February 22, 1968. By August 2014, the circulation of &quot;United Daily News&quot; had passed 1 million copies. The evening paper shut down after publishing its final issue on June 1, 2020.

== Editorial stance ==
The &quot;United Daily News&quot; has traditionally been close to the conservative wing of the Kuomintang. Before Taiwan democratized, it was an opponent of political reform; in the years since Taiwan has democratized, it has advocated policies encouraging cooperation with the mainland. The newspaper has consistently supported a Chinese identity in Taiwan and has taken an editorial stance that supports the pan-Blue Coalition. During the administration of Chen Shui-bian, UDN took a stance against de-Sinicization policies. It criticized former Kaohsiung mayor Chen Chu for inviting the Dalai Lama and Rebiya Kadeer, who were seen as &quot;separatists&quot;. The newspaper&#x27;s editorials have been critical of the Chinese Communist Party regularly, on issues such as those related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre and the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo.

==Content and reception==

&quot;United Daily News&quot; is part of the UDN Group and is one of the two largest traditional news groups in Taiwan, along with &quot;China Times&quot;. The newspaper has also been a major platform for writers to publish and host award competitions in fukan literature.

A 2022 Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism survey found that compared to the major pan-Green outlets &quot;Apple Daily&quot; and &quot;Liberty Times&quot;, &quot;United Daily News&quot; had roughly the same online reach while it had less reach than Sanlih E-Television. &quot;United Daily&quot; received a trust rating of 46% from Taiwanese respondents which was higher than the percentage the other three outlets received.

In July 2023, UDN published alleged meeting minutes of top officials in Taiwan purportedly discussing requests from the United States to develop bioweapons. The Taiwanese government and United States Department of State denied the report. The minutes&#x27; format differed from what the Executive Yuan uses. Taiwanese officials and a U.S. think tank believed that it could be or was likely part of a Chinese government disinformation campaign, generating concerns from commentators. Democratic Progressive Party members filed a legal case against the author on the grounds of forgery and making false claims. After checking with government agencies, the Taipei District Prosecutors&#x27; Office concluded that the minutes were forged but found no evidence of it being committed by the reporter himself. In addition, it criticized the reporter&#x27;s unthorough verification with the Ministry of National Defense but noted that related reports covered responses from the government. The office decided not to press charges. On September 6, UDN said it apologizes to the readers with respect to the incident.

In August and September 2023, a group of individuals were suspected to have received money from China to influence elections in Taiwan. They paid for ads in at least seven news networks, including UDN, to promote results of fake opinion polls.

<text>Andronov is a small lunar impact crater that lies across the southwest rim of the walled plain named Gagarin. It is located on the southern hemisphere of the far side of the Moon, and can not be seen directly from the Earth. Just to the west of Andronov is the crater Levi-Civita.

Andronov is a circular, bowl-shaped formation with a small central floor. There is a tiny craterlet in the northern interior wall. This feature is otherwise unremarkable, and is similar in appearance to many other small craters to be found across the lunar surface.

<text>Sherilyn Fenn (born Sheryl Ann Fenn; February 1, 1965) is an American actress. She played Audrey Horne on the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–1991, 2017) for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award. 

She also had film roles in &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990), &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1992), &quot;Boxing Helena&quot; (1993) and &quot;The United States of Leland&quot; (2003) and appeared in the television series &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; (1998–2001), &quot;Shameless&quot; (2016), and &quot;Shining Vale&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Fenn was born Sheryl Ann Fenn on February 1, 1965, in Detroit, Michigan. She comes from a family of musicians: her mother is keyboard player Arlene Quatro, her aunt is singer Suzi Quatro, and her grandfather, Art Quatro, was a jazz musician. Her father, Leo Fenn, managed rock bands including Suzi Quatro&#x27;s The Pleasure Seekers, Alice Cooper, and The Billion Dollar Babies. Fenn is of Italian and Hungarian descent on her mother&#x27;s side, and Irish and French descent on her father&#x27;s. She was raised Catholic.

Fenn frequently traveled with her mother and two older brothers before the family settled in Los Angeles when she was 17. Not wanting to start with a new school again, Fenn dropped out after her junior year and decided to pursue acting, enrolling at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute.

==Acting career==

===Early career (1984–1989)===
Fenn began her career with a number of B-movies, including &quot;The Wild Life&quot; (1984, opposite Chris Penn), the 1986 skater film &quot;Thrashin&#x27;&quot; (opposite Josh Brolin and Pamela Gidley), the 1986 teen car action and revenge fantasy &quot;The Wraith&quot; (alongside Charlie Sheen and opposite Nick Cassavetes), the 1987 horror film &quot;Zombie High&quot; (alongside Virginia Madsen), and the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;-inspired erotic movie &quot;&quot;. She had a part in the 1985 cult teen-comedy &quot;Just One of the Guys&quot; in which she tries to seduce a teenaged girl who was disguised as a boy, played by Joyce Hyser. Fenn starred alongside Johnny Depp in the 1985 short student film &quot;Dummies&quot;, directed by Laurie Frank for the American Film Institute. Fenn and Depp dated for three and a half years, subsequently getting engaged. In 1987, she joined Depp in a season-one episode of &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; called &quot;Blindsided&quot;.

Fenn has described many of these early films as sexploitation films &quot;where directors tried to convince [her] to appear naked after the contract was signed.&quot; In a February 1993 interview she explained: 

Fenn landed her first starring role, as an engaged heiress to an old Southern family who falls for carnival worker Richard Tyson, in Zalman King&#x27;s erotic drama film &quot;Two Moon Junction&quot;, after which she wanted to hide for a year: &quot;I was so embarrassed about how it turned out that I went into a cocoon for a year afterwards.&quot; &quot;Two Moon Junction&quot; was meant to be Fenn&#x27;s big break, but the film turned into another sexploitation film. 

After these film experiences, Fenn decided to take control of her career. &quot;I decided to be more myself and not to be pushed into what other people wanted me to be. It&#x27;s scary how little imagination many people in this business have.&quot;

===Rise to fame (1990–1991)===
Fenn’s breakthrough came when she was cast by David Lynch and Mark Frost as the tantalizing, reckless Audrey Horne, a high school &quot;femme fatale&quot;, in the TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, which ran between 1990 and 1991. The character of Audrey was one of the most popular with fans, in particular for her unrequited love for FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (played by Kyle MacLachlan) and her style from the 1950s (with her saddle shoes, plaid skirts, and tight sweaters). Fenn reached cult status with a scene in which she danced to Angelo Badalamenti&#x27;s music and a scene in which she knotted a cherry stem in her mouth. &quot;With Sherilyn Fenn, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; came on and effortlessly destroyed every other show&#x27;s sexuality&quot;, said James Marshall, one of her cast-mates. Speaking in September 1990, Fenn pointed out: &quot;Audrey is a woman-child who dresses like the girls in the &#x27;50s and shows her body. But she&#x27;s daddy&#x27;s little girl at the same time.&quot; In the show&#x27;s second season, when the idea of pairing Audrey with Cooper was abandoned, Audrey was paired with other characters like Bobby Briggs (played by Dana Ashbrook) and John Justice Wheeler (Billy Zane). About Audrey, Fenn said: 

Shortly after shooting the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; pilot episode, David Lynch gave her a small part in &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;, as a girl injured in a car wreck, obsessed by the contents of her purse, alongside Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. The film won the Golden Palm Award at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;David&#x27;s direction was, &#x27;Only think of this: bobby pins, lipstick, wallet, comb, that&#x27;s it.&#x27; It&#x27;s very abstract.&quot; &quot;I just pictured her being able to do this,&quot; said Lynch of her scene, &quot;she&#x27;s like a broken China doll.&quot; David Lynch, who once described Sherilyn Fenn as &quot;five feet of heaven in a ponytail&quot; (quoting from a 1958 record by The Playmates), said to Banner, who used that description as the title of his article, &quot;She&#x27;s a mysterious girl and I think that actresses like her who have a mystery – where there&#x27;s something hiding beneath the surface – are the really interesting ones.&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s very creative and unafraid of taking chances,&quot; she said of the director. &quot;I really respect him. He&#x27;s wonderful.&quot; Also during this period, Fenn appeared on the cover and in a nude pictorial in the December 1990 edition of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

She portrayed John Dillinger&#x27;s girlfriend Billie Frechette in ABC&#x27;s 1991 gangster TV movie &quot;Dillinger&quot; opposite Mark Harmon, and shot the neo-noir black comedy &quot;Desire and Hell at Sunset Motel&quot; in which she played a sultry, seductive &quot;femme fatale&quot;.

After &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, Fenn chose to focus on widening her range of roles and was determined to avoid typecasting. She stated, &quot;They&#x27;ve offered me every variation on Audrey Horne, none of which were as good or as much fun. She turned down the Audrey Horne spinoff series that was offered to her, and unlike most of the cast, chose not to return for the 1992 prequel movie &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;, as she was then shooting &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;.

===Post-&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; roles (1992–1995)===
After two nominations (Emmy and Golden Globe) for &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, and the pictorial in &quot;Playboy&quot;, Fenn was propelled to stardom and became a major sex symbol, with her Old Hollywood looks. In October 1990, while promoting &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, Fenn made the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine along with Mädchen Amick and Lara Flynn Boyle. In 1990 &quot;Us Magazine&quot; chose her as one of the &quot;10 Most Beautiful Women in the World&quot; and in 1991 &quot;People&quot; magazine chose her as one of the &quot;50 Most Beautiful Women in the World&quot;. She posed for photographer Steven Meisel for the autumn-winter 1991–1992 Dolce &amp; Gabbana campaign, for which he photographed her as a classical Hollywood &quot;femme fatale&quot;. In 1992, photographer George Hurrell took a series of photographs of Sherilyn Fenn, Julian Sands, Raquel Welch, Eric Roberts and Sean Young. In these portraits, he recreated his style of the 1930s, with Fenn posing in costumes, hairstyle, and makeup of the period.

In 1991, Hollywood acting coach Roy London chose her to star in his directorial debut &quot;Diary of a Hitman&quot;, in which she plays a young mother determined to protect her child from hitman Forest Whitaker. According to Fenn, the turning point in her career was when she met London in 1990. She credits him with instilling confidence and newfound enthusiasm. She learned from her beloved teacher &quot;to find the roles that you&#x27;re passionate about, that speak to you on some level and which will help you grow on some level,&quot; which has then become her line of conduct. &quot;A lot of the sentiment that acting should be about an art form rather than mass entertainment and celebrity is at the core of Fenn&#x27;s attitude to the business,&quot; wrote Jessica Sully in Australian magazine &quot;Movie&quot;. &quot;I try to keep myself centered,&quot; Fenn said. &quot;I don&#x27;t go to parties and all that. I don&#x27;t think being seen or being in the right place is going to make me a better actress. I care about my work and try to do what&#x27;s right in my heart.&quot; As Mike Bygrave wrote in &quot;Sky Magazine&quot;: &quot;One of the keys to understanding Fenn is that when she talks about the characters she plays she&#x27;s really talking about herself.&quot; Fenn was eager to play varied parts that could eclipse her sex-symbol image. &quot;People who think they know me would be surprised that my whole life doesn&#x27;t revolve around sex,&quot; she said. After &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, Fenn demanded a no-nudity clause in her contracts. She turned to independent films, choosing varied and unusual roles: 

A highlight of Fenn&#x27;s film career is Gary Sinise&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, in which she played a sad and lonely country wife, desperately in need to talk to somebody, opposite Sinise and John Malkovich. &quot;Sherilyn&#x27;s one of the reasons we got such a great ovation at Cannes&quot;, said Sinise. &quot;She&#x27;s like a terribly sad angel in this film. Sherilyn plays against just being a sexy and beautiful girl,&quot; he added. &quot;Gary Sinise was one of the first people who didn&#x27;t see me like a lot of other people did&quot;, she said. &quot;It was a wonderful experience. Horton Foote adapted the novel and he fleshed out my character, and he made her much, much more.&quot; The same year, she starred alongside Danny Aiello and others in John Mackenzie&#x27;s &quot;Ruby&quot;, about Jack Ruby. Fenn played the part of ambitious stripper Sheryl Ann DuJean, a fictitious character who is a composite of several real-life women including stripper Candy Barr, Marilyn Monroe, and Judith Campbell Exner. &quot;She&#x27;s got a brain and all the right emotional instincts, and that&#x27;s a great combination,&quot; said Mackenzie of Fenn.

In 1993, she starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Three of Hearts&quot; as Kelly Lynch and William Baldwin&#x27;s love interest. During the shooting, the relationship between Fenn and director Yurek Bogayevicz became strained as she refused to appear nude in the film.

Another of her notable film roles was in &quot;Boxing Helena&quot;, directed by David Lynch&#x27;s daughter Jennifer Chambers Lynch. Fenn portrayed a narcissistic seductress amputated and imprisoned by Julian Sands, who makes her become his personal Venus de Milo in an effort to possess her. Fenn said of the film, &quot;Society, Hollywood, some men... they want to wrap women up in a neat little package.&quot; Both Lynch and Fenn were proud of their work in it, but the film was ultimately a critical and commercial failure. However, both women enjoyed their collaboration. &quot;Sherilyn is an amazing actress, a total bundle of energy and a real powerhouse and I think people will see a side of her that we have never seen of Sherilyn anywhere else before,&quot; said Lynch of the actress. &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s one of the brightest person I know,&quot; said Fenn. &quot;&quot;Boxing Helena was&quot;... not perfect, but I think for the story that we were trying to tell, it turned out pretty good. What it signified was really powerful to me: how society puts us in boxes one way or another.&quot;

She then starred in Carl Reiner&#x27;s neo-noir parody &quot;Fatal Instinct&quot; as Armand Assante&#x27;s devoted secretary and Sean Young&#x27;s and Kate Nelligan&#x27;s rival. She was asked to read for the &quot;femme fatale&quot; Lola (eventually played by Young), but opted for the secretary role.

Fenn afterward portrayed Potiphar&#x27;s wife Zulaikha in Showtime&#x27;s 1995 Biblical TV movie &quot;Slave of Dreams&quot; opposite Adrian Pasdar and Edward James Olmos.

In 1995, she starred in an episode of &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; directed by Robert Zemeckis, alongside Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow, in which she played the lover of Humphrey Bogart, who appeared in the episode via CGI special effects.

After a short break during which she married and gave birth to a son, Fenn was chosen out of more than 100 actresses to portray actress Elizabeth Taylor in NBC&#x27;s 1995 telemovie &quot;&quot;. Fenn called the role &quot;probably the hardest job I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot; &quot;Director Kevin Connor and I arranged a lunch, not an audition,&quot; said executive producer Lester Persky. &quot;We knew 10 minutes into our meeting that Sherilyn was it. She has the same striking beauty, and because of that she&#x27;s experienced some of the things in life and in this business that make Elizabeth such a fascinating person.&quot; When she accepted the part, Fenn was unaware that Taylor was embroiled in a lawsuit intended to stop both the broadcast of the film and the unauthorized biography that it was based on. Fenn stated about the controversy, &quot;I am somebody who doesn&#x27;t make choices lightly at this point of my life. I&#x27;m not somebody who wants to exploit another&#x27;s woman story or life in any way.&quot; Fenn felt a kinship with Taylor, stating, &quot;There are stereotypes of what a beautiful woman is. She struggled with that. A certain part of her life she went on that calling card. I certainly know I&#x27;ve come into contact with that. &#x27;You are too pretty,&#x27; I&#x27;m told.&quot; During the shooting, Fenn supported the original screenwriter&#x27;s effort to concentrate on Taylor the person, not the legend: 

===Mid-1990s and guest appearances (1996–1998)===
In the late 1990s, Fenn experienced a career slowdown. In 1993, she had stated:

In 1997, she stated: &quot;It was crazy, I was very picky. In other words, I didn&#x27;t take advantage of what was happening necessarily then.&quot; Also, she has attributed her failure to adapt to the Hollywood system to her frankness and her dislike for the &quot;Hollywood game.&quot;
She began to alternate TV movies and independent films. In 1996, she joined the ensemble cast in the romantic comedy &quot;Lovelife&quot; as a waitress who attempts to become a writer and has to rebuild her life. Fenn also appeared in the 1997 romantic comedy &quot;Just Write&quot;, along with Jeremy Piven, as the dream actress of a Hollywood tour bus driver, who mistakes him for a famous screenwriter. Both films have been well-received on the festival circuit.

In a 1997 episode of &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;The One with Phoebe&#x27;s Ex-Partner&quot;, which was Episode 14 of Season 3 of the show, Fenn guest-starred as Matt LeBlanc&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Ginger, who has a prosthetic right leg. She stated, &quot;I like the show. I was happy to be a part of it.&quot;

The same year, she was cast as the female lead in ABC&#x27;s show &quot;Prey&quot; (originally entitled &quot;Hungry for Survival&quot;) and starred in the unaired original pilot episode. However, after the filming was done and post-production work almost wrapped up, the studio heads abruptly changed course, replacing Fenn with Debra Messing and reshooting the entire pilot. &quot;Prey&quot; went on for one season before getting cancelled.

Fenn starred in the 1998 British psychological drama &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; as a wealthy and neglected wife, who is sequestered with her husband (played by Tim Dutton) by a man (Ray Winstone) determined to understand the events that led to his wife ending up in a coma. Fenn called the film &quot;a wonderful character piece&quot; While shooting the film in the Isle of Man in late 1997, Fenn considered settling in London to start a European career, but eventually decided to stay in the U.S.

===Return to television: &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; (1998–2001)===
Fenn gained newfound enthusiasm with the lead role in Showtime&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; as Billie Frank, an alcoholic ex-soap opera actress, who tries to go sober and become a writer, but continues to struggle with her self-destructive habits. The series ran from 1998 to 2001 and co-starred Lynn Redgrave, Jonathan Penner, and Mario Van Peebles. She said of it: 

Fenn again joined Jeremy Piven in a 1998 episode of &quot;Cupid&quot;, as Piven&#x27;s love interest.

In 1999, she reteamed with Chris Penn and Adrian Pasdar for Pasdar&#x27;s art-house directorial debut, the neo-noir &quot;Cement,&quot; a contemporary retelling of &quot;Othello&quot; in which she played a tempting but imprudent wife of jealous corrupt cop Penn. &quot;I play a character who&#x27;s selfish and sloppy with her sexual energy. I saw the film and I was really happy with it. It&#x27;s got a lot of soul.&quot; The film, which won Best Picture awards on the festival circuit, was written by &quot;Farscape&quot;″s screenwriter, Justin Monjo and also starred Jeffrey Wright and Henry Czerny. She also reteamed with actor/director Bruce Davison for his 2001 family comedy, Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Off Season&quot; alongside Rory Culkin, Hume Cronyn, and Adam Arkin.

Fenn subsequently starred alongside Jon Tenney in the pilot for a remake of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Love, American Style,&quot; for the 1998–1999 television season. Although the show wasn&#x27;t picked up, it did air as a TV special on February 20, 1999. Guest stars include Mariska Hargitay, Steven Eckholdt, Fenn, Jon Tenney, Melissa Joan Hart, Matt Letscher, Joely Fisher, Tom Verica, and writer/producer Winnie Holzman (&quot;My So-Called Life&quot;).

===2001–present===
Following &quot;Rude Awakening&quot;, Fenn&#x27;s has made a number of episodic TV appearances. In the middle of the 2000s, she was involved in many projects that went unrealized.

In 2001, she starred in &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; episode &quot;Replica&quot;, playing a scientist who volunteered to be cloned. She also starred in an episode of &quot;Night Visions&quot;, as a woman who buys a used car possessed by a vengeful spirit. She was cast as a kindergarten teacher for the pilot of the 2001 American version of the British TV show &quot;Blind Men&quot;, alongside French Stewart. However, the pilot was not ordered into a series.

In 2002, Fenn was one of several former &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; stars, such as Dana Ashbrook and Mädchen Amick, to have a recurring role on The WB&#x27;s &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. She guest-starred in three episodes from the fifth season, as Alex Pearl, the seductive manager of the restaurant where Joshua Jackson works. Fenn was afterwards cast as Harley Quinn in The WB&#x27;s &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, but was replaced by Mia Sara before the series began. Fenn starred in the original pilot episode, but dropped out, due to scheduling conflicts, as the show&#x27;s creators realized that the character Harley Quinn would need to be a bigger part of the show. She also played a manipulative woman in a season-four episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; versus both Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay, and appeared in &quot;Watching Ellie&quot;.

Fenn played a crime boss in the 2002 film &quot;Swindle&quot; alongside Tom Sizemore. She had a small role in the film &quot;The United States of Leland&quot; alongside Ryan Gosling, in which she played a mother who captivates a troubled teenage boy.

In 2003, Fenn appeared on The WB&#x27;s &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as Sasha, the girlfriend of Jess Mariano&#x27;s estranged father (played by Rob Estes) in the season-three episode &quot;Here Comes the Son&quot;, which was the back-door pilot for a California-set spin-off titled &quot;Windward Circle&quot;, that was to have starred Milo Ventimiglia, Estes, and Fenn. But the network dropped the project, citing cost issues due to filming on location in Venice, California.

She played the recurring part of Violet Montgomery on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Boston Public&quot; (2003–2004), and appeared in Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Cavedweller&quot; (2004) opposite Kyra Sedgwick. In 2004, Fenn joined former co-star Mark Harmon in an episode of &quot;NCIS&quot;, as an amnesiac woman. She was afterwards cast for the 2004 remake of &quot;Mister Ed&quot;, planned for the Fox network—but after the pilot was shot, the show&#x27;s writer/producer, Drake Sather, committed suicide, and the pilot was not aired.

In 2004, Fenn co-starred opposite Traci Lords and Paul Johansson in Emily Skopov&#x27;s &quot;Novel Romance,&quot; released in 2006, in which she played a pregnancy shop owner who herself cannot have children. She then appeared in the martial arts film &quot;Lesser of Three Evils&quot; alongside Ho Sung Pak, Peter Greene, and Roger Guenveur Smith, as the unbalanced and alcoholic wife of a corrupt detective. The film was released in 2009 under the title &quot;Fist of the Warrior.&quot;

In 2005, Fenn made an appearance on &quot;The 4400&quot;, playing Jean DeLynn Baker, a 4400 who has the ability to grow toxin-emitting spores on her hands. She also guest-starred on the final episode of &quot;Judging Amy&quot;.

After finishing the Russia-set action film &quot;Treasure Raiders&quot; with David Carradine, Fenn starred in the Canadian psychological thriller &quot;Presumed Dead&quot;, alongside Duncan Regehr, as a detective working on a missing-person case who has to outwit a crime novelist.

In 2006, Fenn reteamed with Amy Sherman-Palladino and reappeared in the sixth and seventh seasons of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as Anna Nardini, the ex-girlfriend of Luke Danes (played by Scott Patterson) and protective mother to his daughter April. Since the failure of the 2003 &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; spin-off project, Sherman-Palladino had continued to want to work with Fenn again, and she wrote the character of Anna with her in mind. When asked why she cast Fenn for two different roles on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, Sherman-Palladino explained: However, after Sherman-Palladino left the show, the direction for the character changedthe producers decided to make her character a villain in a custody battle.

Fenn was cast as the female lead in ABC&#x27;s 2006 comedy series &quot;Three Moons Over Milford&quot;, but she was ultimately replaced by Elizabeth McGovern. Fenn was slated for a recurring role on CBS&#x27;s 2006 crime drama &quot;Smith,&quot; but the show was quickly canceled.

She appeared in the 2007 &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; prequel, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning&quot; as Lulu Hogg. &quot;It&#x27;s just a fun silly role,&quot; Fenn said. But having already worked with director Robert Berlinger on &quot;Rude Awakening,&quot; she wanted to do so again.

In July 2006, shortly after shooting &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; prequel, Fenn stepped behind the camera for the first time and directed in Pittsburgh a documentary film about child enrichment program CosmiKids and its founder, Judy Julin. She subsequently joined its executive team in 2007 as executive director of the film and television division. In July 2008, Fenn filmed &quot;The Scenesters&quot;, a black comedy made by Los Angeles-based comedy group The Vacationeers, which premiered in October 2009. In July 2009, Fenn made a guest appearance on &quot;In Plain Sight&quot; as a lesbian counterfeiter.

In December 2010, Fenn appeared on &quot;Psych&quot; with other &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; actors on the season 5 episode &quot;Dual Spires&quot; as sultry librarian Maudette Hornsby. The episode paid homage to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; with many references to the show. She reprised her role as Audrey Horne in 2017 for the third season of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. In February 2016, she joined the cast of the American version of &quot;Shameless.&quot;

In 2016, Fenn wrote and published a children&#x27;s book titled &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, about a boy who has autism. She was inspired to write the book after her second son, Christian, was diagnosed with autism.

In 2017, Fenn starred in &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; as Karen Street, Jim Street&#x27;s estranged mother.

In 2022, Sherilyn portrayed Sarah Jane McCubbin, a widow with dementia who plans to be euthanized by her mentally imbalanced son in the psychological drama &quot;Losing Addison&quot;.

==Personal life==
Fenn dated pop singer Prince for a short time during 1985 and then actor Johnny Depp the same year; their relationship lasted a few years.

In 1993, Fenn welcomed a son, named Myles, with guitarist-songwriter Toulouse Holliday, whom she met on the set of &quot;Three of Hearts&quot;. The two were married between 1994 and 1997.

In 2007, from her relationship with Dylan Stewart, Fenn gave birth to her second son, Christian.

Fenn began practicing Transcendental Meditation in 2014.

<doc id="1039546" wikidata="Q125161" url="?curid=1039546" title="Partisan (weapon)">
<text>A partisan (also known as a partizan), a type of polearm, was used in Europe during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.
It consisted of a spearhead mounted on a long wooden shaft, with protrusions on the sides which aided in parrying sword thrusts.

The partisan was often used by infantry soldiers, who would deploy the weapon to fend off cavalry charges. The protrusions on the sides of the spearhead were useful for catching and trapping an opponent&#x27;s sword, allowing the user to disarm the opposition. In profile, the head of a partisan may look similar to other types of polearm, such as the halberd, pike, ranseur, spontoon, ox tongue, or spetum.

The arrival of practical firearms and bayonet led to the obsolescence of the partisan and of other polearms. Despite this, partisans continued in use for many years as a ceremonial weapon. Ceremonial partisans can still be seen in the hands of guards at important buildings or events.

<text>Kings County Savings Bank is a former bank building at 135 Broadway in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City. It is an example of French Second Empire-style architecture. Construction of the building began in 1860, to designs of William H. Willcox of Brooklyn, in partnership with prominent New York architect Gamaliel King, working as King &amp; Willcox. The structure was continuously occupied by banks until the 1990s. The Williamsburg Art &amp; Historical Center has operated the building since 1996.

The building became a New York City designated landmark in 1966 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

==Architecture==
The Kings County Savings Bank building was built between 1860 and 1867. It is on the outside dimension and is constructed of Dorchester sandstone. It has three main floors, each a single large room. On the first and second floors, the main rooms contain six tall Corinthian columns, formed of cast iron, while the third floor is entirely open. The first floor retains its massive gas chandeliers and ornately carved woodwork.

Although the designer of the bank, King&#x27;s partner William H. Willcox, is relatively unknown, the building is a superb example of the French Second Empire style. For example, the building displays the characteristic Mansard roof, which conceals the fourth story attic.

==History==
The Kings County Savings Institution was chartered on April 10, 1860. It carried out business in a building called Washington Hall until it purchased the lot on the corner of Bedford Avenue and Broadway and erected a permanent home.

The Kings County Savings Bank has long been considered a landmark of Williamsburg. By 1900, during the construction of the Williamsburg Bridge, the neighborhood had changed, and the Bank building was already seen as an icon of &quot;old Williamsburg.&quot; It remains one of the most important historical landmarks in Williamsburg, and was recognized by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1966, the seventh building to be so designated. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

&quot;The Kings County Savings Bank is an outstanding example of French Second Empire architecture, displaying a wealth of ornament and diverse architectural elements. A business building of imposing grandeur, the Kings County Savings Bank &quot;represents a period of conspicuous display in which it was not considered vulgar, at least by the people in power, to boast openly of one&#x27;s wealth. From its scale and general character there is nothing, on the outside, that would distinguish the Kings County Savings Bank from a millionaires mansion.&quot; (from History Preserved: New York City Landmarks &amp; Historic Districts, Harmon H. Gladstone &amp; Martha Dalyrmple, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1974).

The building remained in continuous bank ownership and use for well over a century. It ceased to be used as a bank in the 1980s.

==Williamsburg Art &amp; Historical Center==
Currently the building houses the Williamsburg Art &amp; Historical Center, a not-for profit art organization founded by artist Yuko Nii in October 1996. The Center presents art exhibitions, performances and cultural events as well as lectures, seminars and educational programs of both local and international interest. It also preserves and displays historical art and artifacts.

On July 31, 2008, John B. Manbeck, the official Brooklyn Borough Historian from 1993 to 2002, said in an article in the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;:

Art in Williamsburg has made great strides. In fact, all Williamsburg has progressed, undoubtedly because of its attraction to artists. Much of the credit must be placed on the doorstep of the director of the Williamsburg Art &amp; Historical Center, Yuko Nii. The center operates out of the former Kings County Savings Bank Building (1867) and celebrated an infusion of a $500,000 capital funding grant from the city.

In 2009 ownership of the building was transferred to the Yuko Nii Foundation.

<text>Blankman is a 1994 American superhero comedy parody film directed by Mike Binder and written by Damon Wayans and J. F. Lawton. The film stars Wayans, David Alan Grier, Robin Givens, Jon Polito, and Jason Alexander. Its plot follows a repairman who is inspired to become a superhero after his grandmother is murdered in a mob hit. &quot;Blankman&quot; was released in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing on August 19, 1994. The film received negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
As kids, Darryl and Kevin Walker grew up as fans of the television series &quot;Batman.&quot; Now grown, Darryl is a clumsy, nerdy repairman, while his brother Kevin is a tabloid news cameraman. They both live with their grandmother, who is an avid supporter of Alderman Marvin Harris, a politician from their neighborhood running for mayor on an anti-corruption platform. Kevin is interested in getting out of making tabloids and doing a serious story about mobster Michael &quot;The Suit&quot; Minelli, but his attempts to do so are shot down by his boss, Larry Stone, a perverted tabloid news junkie. Darryl is overly optimistic and almost childishly naive to the harsh realities of living in the inner city (such as the crackhouse next door), but is a brilliant inventor, having constructed a mobile robot assistant named J-5, among other creations.

One night, after Harris wins acclaim by publicly refusing a bribe from Minelli, Grandma Walker is murdered by Sammy the Blade at Harris&#x27;s campaign headquarters. The murder opens Darryl&#x27;s eyes to the urban decay around him and he begins to fight crime by boldly saving an elderly transit passenger from being mugged, but overreaches by storming the crackhouse next door to rebuke the gang members. He then decides to become a vigilante superhero, using his technical expertise to create weapons and gadgetsin particular, a substance which renders ordinary clothing bulletprooffor his crime-fighting crusade, all to the annoyance of Kevin.

After Darryl is nearly killed trying to protect a citizen on the street and is arrested by the cops who ridiculed him after he demanded to see the police commissioner, Kevin takes Darryl to see a psychiatrist. It doesn&#x27;t work in Kevin&#x27;s favor, as Darryl denies being a superhero and puts the blame on Kevin, whom the psychiatrist then attempts to psychoanalyze. Kevin changes his mind and goes along with the fantasy, believing that it&#x27;s Darryl&#x27;s way to cope with the murder of their grandmother, but under the guidance of starting a neighborhood watch instead. When a girl tells them of a pregnant woman trapped in an elevator, Darryl arrives as his superhero alter-ego. Upon delivering the baby, he is surrounded by many, including reporters. Asked for his name, Darryl just stares; Kevin says he&#x27;s gone blank, which everyone interprets as his name: Blankman.

Over time, Darryl uses his Blankman identity to protect various community members, build up a reputation, and inspire not only the town&#x27;s citizens but other real-life superheroes. One person interested in him is Kimberly Jonz, a fellow reporter whom Kevin hopes to win the affection of. When Kimberly wants to know if it&#x27;s possible to get an interview with Blankman, Kevin begs Darryl to allow her to interview him. He relents, on the condition that she wear a carnation. Taking her on his Blank-Cycle at the train tracks, he brings her to his secret hideout: the &quot;Blank Station&quot;, an abandoned subway station filled with all of his inventions, or, in his words, &quot;junk&quot;. Kimberly interviews him about how and why he took up crime fighting, revealing it was because of the death of his grandmother. Impressed by his heroics and modesty, Kimberly immediately falls in love with him. She kisses him, only for him to panic when he gets an erection.

Mayor Harris attempts to bring in outside money to pay the IOUs the city has been giving its workers and requests that Blankman be there to protect the people and receive a special award. As the money is released, Minelli&#x27;s henchmen storm the bank and take the mayor hostage, threatening to detonate explosives. At the police chief&#x27;s request and the crowd&#x27;s chants, Blankman attempts to save the mayor, but even with Kevin&#x27;s help, he is unable to stop the crooks, nor defuse the bombs. Before the bombs go off, Darryl reveals his identity and his grandmother&#x27;s support for the mayor. Harris wishes him well, warning him to run, and says he will tell Darryl&#x27;s grandmother about him. Blankman runs out screaming as the bank explodes, killing Harris. The crowd, seeing his failure, turn on him and chase him down the street. Now a pariah, Darryl gives up on crime fighting and even a possible relationship with Kimberly. Trying for a normal life, he gets a job at a McDonald&#x27;s.

Wanting a great story, Larry Stone manages to contact Minelli and trades knowledge of Blankman&#x27;s love for Kimberly in exchange for an exclusive interview. While researching Minelli and Grandma Walker&#x27;s murder, Kimberly realizes his true identity and calls Kevin with the news, only for Minelli to take Kimberly hostage. Thinking he is talking to Blankman, Minelli threatens to kill Kimberly if Blankman doesn&#x27;t show up. Kevin rushes to Darryl&#x27;s workplace with the news, but Darryl refuses to help until Kevin reveals Minelli killed their grandmother. They leave and change to their superhero identities, with Kevin agreeing to wear a costume himself as &quot;Other Guy&quot;. The two heroes rush to the TV station, where Minelli has murdered a reporter and is threatening others, including Stone. The two engage in a fight with Minelli&#x27;s goons, but they lose. They are placed in a water tank and left to drown, with Stone and Kimberly chained up and left to die, and Minelli has hidden bombs to destroy the building. Blankman calls J-5 to save them and succeeds. The duo then finds the bombs in the women&#x27;s bathroom, and stuffs the explosives inside J-5, while he frees Kimberly (Stone is left behind, as a joke by Other Guy). Once outside, the explosives detonate, destroying J-5. Distraught, Blankman swears revenge.

Tracking Minelli to his factory hideout, Blankman and Other Guy prepare for the final battle. Other Guy is overconfident and gets wounded because his costume is not bulletproof. Blankman then defeats Minelli&#x27;s goons with his electric &quot;newchucks&quot; and activates his jet-powered roller blades to capture Minelli, delivering him to the police and finally avenging their grandmother&#x27;s death. Blankman, this time with Other Guy, is once again acknowledged as a hero by the people and receives the Mayor Harris Award for outstanding community service at a ceremony in their honor, while Other Guy receives a Blankman T-shirt, much to his disgust. After the ceremony, Kevin introduces Kimberly to Darryl. The two make light conversation until Kimberly pretends to see a purse snatcher, which puts Darryl on high alert. It was a trick, as Kimberly reveals she already knows that Darryl is Blankman to prove it, she kisses Darryl, causing him to fall to the ground embarrassingly like before. The film ends with a shot of a banner that reads &quot;We Love You Blankman and Other Guy.&quot;

<doc id="1039552" wikidata="Q682958" url="?curid=1039552" title="Bhagavata Purana">
<text>The Bhagavata Purana (; ), also known as the Srimad Bhagavatam(Śrīmad Bhāgavatam)&quot;, Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana () or simply Bhagavata (Bhāgavata)&quot;, is one of Hinduism&#x27;s eighteen major Puranas (&quot;Mahapuranas&quot;) and one of the most popular in Vaishnavism. Composed in Sanskrit and traditionally attributed to Veda Vyasa, it promotes &quot;bhakti&quot; (devotion) towards Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu, integrating themes from the Advaita (monism) philosophy of Adi Shankara, the Vishishtadvaita (qualified monism) of Ramanujacharya and the Dvaita (dualism) of Madhvacharya. It is widely available in almost all Indian languages.

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, like other puranas, discusses a wide range of topics including cosmology, astronomy, genealogy, geography, legend, music, dance, yoga and culture. As it begins, the forces of evil have won a war between the benevolent &quot;devas&quot; (deities) and evil &quot;asuras&quot; (demons) and now rule the universe. Truth re-emerges as Krishna (called &quot;Hari&quot; and &quot;Vāsudeva&quot; in the text) first makes peace with the demons, understands them and then creatively defeats them, bringing back hope, justice, freedom and happiness – a cyclic theme that appears in many legends.

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; is a central text in Vaishnavism. The text presents a form of religion (&quot;dharma&quot;) that competes with that of the Vedas, wherein &quot;bhakti&quot; ultimately leads to self-knowledge, salvation (&quot;moksha&quot;) and bliss. However the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; asserts that the inner nature and outer form of Krishna is identical to the Vedas and that this is what rescues the world from the forces of evil. An oft-quoted verse (1.3.40) is used by some Krishna sects to assert that the text itself is Krishna in literary form.

The text consists of twelve books (&quot;skandhas&quot; or cantos) totalling 335 chapters (&quot;adhyayas&quot;) and 18,000 verses. The tenth book, with about 4,000 verses, has been the most popular and widely studied. By daily reading of this supreme scripture, there is no untimely death, disease, epidemic, fear of enemies, etc. and man can attain Bhagwat(god) even in Kaliyug and reach the ultimate salvation.It was the first &quot;Purana&quot; to be translated into a European language, as a French translation of a Tamil version appeared in 1788 and introduced many Europeans to Hinduism and 18th-century Hindu culture during the colonial era.

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; has been among the most celebrated and popular texts in the Puranic genre, and is, in the opinion of some, of non-dualistic tenor. But, the dualistic school of Madhvacharya has a rich and strong tradition of dualistic interpretation of the Bhagavata, starting from the Bhagavata Taatparya Nirnaya of the Acharya himself and later, commentaries on the commentary.

== Nomenclature ==
*&#x27;Bhagavata&#x27; (or &#x27;Bhagavatam&#x27; or &#x27;Bhagavat&#x27;, Sanskrit भागवत) means &#x27;follower or worshipper of Vishnu&#x27;.
**&#x27;Bhagavan&#x27; (Sanskrit भगवन्) means &#x27;Blessed One&#x27;, &#x27;God&#x27;, or &#x27;Lord&#x27;. Krishna – the transcendental, primeval Personality of Godhead, avatar of Vishnu – is directly referred to as &#x27;Bhagavan&#x27; throughout this scripture. It is stated in canto 1, chapter 3, verse 28, &quot;kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam&quot; which A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada translates as, &quot;Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead.&quot;
*&#x27;Purana&#x27; (Sanskrit पुराण) means &#x27;ancient&#x27; or &#x27;old&#x27; (or &#x27;old traditional history&#x27;). It also means &#x27;complete&#x27; and &#x27;completing&#x27; in the sense that a Purana &#x27;completes the Vedas&#x27;.
**&#x27;Maha&#x27; (Sanskrit महत्) means &#x27;great&#x27;, &#x27;large&#x27;, or &#x27;vast&#x27;.
*&#x27;Srimad&#x27; (or &#x27;Srimat&#x27;, Sanskrit श्रीमत्) means &#x27;radiant&#x27;, &#x27;holy&#x27;, &#x27;splendid&#x27;, or &#x27;glorious&#x27;, and is an honorific religious title.
**&#x27;Sri&#x27; (or &#x27;Shri&#x27; or &#x27;Shree&#x27;, Sanskrit श्री) means &#x27;wealth&#x27;. Lakshmi – Goddess of Wealth and Vishnu/Krishna&#x27;s wife – is also referred to as &#x27;Sri&#x27;.
**&#x27;Mad&#x27; (or &#x27;Mat&#x27;, Sanskrit मत्) means &#x27;religion&#x27; or &#x27;believed&#x27;.
**Those with a wealth (&#x27;Sri&#x27;) of religion (&#x27;mad&#x27;) may be honoured with the title of &#x27;radiant&#x27;, &#x27;holy&#x27;, &#x27;splendid&#x27;, or &#x27;glorious&#x27; (&#x27;Srimad&#x27;).

===Modern scholarship===
Modern scholarship dates its composition to between 500 CE to 1000 CE, but most likely between 800 and 1000 CE. Hardy suggests that the most plausible timeframe for the composition of the Bhāgavata Purāṇa is the 9th or early 10th century. A version of the text existed no later than 1030 CE, when it is mentioned by al Biruni and quoted by Abhinavagupta. The Bhagavata Purana abounds in references to verses of the Vedas, the primary Upanishads, the Brahma Sutra of Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, and the Bhagavad Gita, suggesting that it was composed after these texts. The text contains more details of Krishna&#x27;s biography than the 3rd- 4th-century &quot;Harivamsha&quot; and &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, and is therefore likely to have been composed after these texts, suggesting a chronological range of 500–1000 CE. Within this range, scholars such as R. C. Hazra date it to the first half of the 6th century CE, Bryant as well as Gupta and Valpey citing epigraphical and archaeological evidence suggest much of the text could be from the 4th to 7th century, while most others place it in the post-Alvar period around the 9th century. Parts of the text use an archaic Vedic flavour of Sanskrit, which may either suggest that its authors sought to preserve or express reverence for the Vedic tradition, or that some text has an earlier origin. There are two flavors of Krishna stories, one of warrior prince and another of romantic lover, the former composed in more archaic Sanskrit and the later in a different linguistic style, suggesting that the texts may not have been composed by one author or over a short period, but rather grew over time as a compilation of accretions from different hands.

The Bhagavata Purana contains apparent references to the South Indian Alvar saints and it makes a &quot;post factum&quot; prophecy of the spread of Vishnu worship in Tamil country (BP XI.5.38–40); these facts, along with its emphasis on &quot;emotional Bhakti to Krishna&quot; and the &quot;Advaita philosophy of Sankara&quot;, lead many scholars to trace its origins to South India. However, J. A. B. van Buitenen points out that 10th–11th CE South Indian Vaishnava theologians Yamuna and Ramanuja do not refer to Bhagavata Purana in their writings, and this anomaly must be explained before the geographical origins and dating are regarded as definitive.

Since the 19th-century, most scholars believe that the Bhagavata Purana was written by a group of learned Brahmin ascetics, probably in South India, who were well versed in Vedic and ancient Indian literature and influenced by the Alvars. Postmodern scholars have suggested alternate theories.

== Content and structure ==
The Bhagavata Purana consists of twelve &quot;skhandas&quot; or cantos consisting of 18,000 verses of several interconnected, interwoven, and non-linear dialogues, teachings, and explanations espousing Bhakti Yoga that go back and forth in time:
===Stated authorship and purpose===
From the N. P. Jain for Motilal Banarsidass translation:

A unique and especial emphasis is placed on fostering transcendental loving devotion to Krishna as the ultimate good, i.e. for its own sake rather than for fruitive results or rewards such as detachment or worldly or heavenly gains, a practice known as Bhakti Yoga:

=== Puranic characteristics ===
As detailed in the Matsya Mahapurana, all Puranas must cover at least five specific subjects or topics referred to in Sanskrit as &quot;Pancha Lakshana&quot; (literally meaning &#x27;consisting of five characteristics&#x27;) – in addition to other information including specific deities and the four aims or goals of life. From the K. L. Joshi (editor) translation:

The Srimad Bhagavatam adds another five characteristics, expanding this list to ten.

The Bhagavata further elaborates on the differences between lesser and greater Puranas possessing five or ten characteristics, respectively.

=== Manuscripts ===

According to Hariprasad Gangashankar Shastri, the oldest surviving manuscript dates to c. 1124-25 and is held in the Sampurnananda Sanskrit Vishvavidyalaya in Varanasi.

Poetic or artistic license with existing materials is a strong tradition in Indian culture, a &quot;&#x27;tradition of several hundred years of linguistic creativity&quot;&#x27;. There are variations of original manuscripts available for each Purana, including the Srimad Bhagavatam. The common manuscript for translations of the Bhagavata Purana – seemingly used by both Swami Prabhupada and Bibek Debroy – is the &quot;Bhāgavatamahāpurāṇam&quot; a reprint of Khemraj Shri Krishnadas&#x27; manuscript. In regard to variances in Puranic manuscripts, Gregory Bailey states:

SB 12.13.11–12 original Sanskrit:

==Philosophy==
While Bhakti Yoga and Dvaita Vedanta are the prominent teachings, states T. S. Rukmani, various passages show a synthesis that also includes Samkhya, Yoga, Vedanta, and Advaita Vedanta.

=== Bhakti ===

Cutler states the Bhagavata Purana is among the most important texts on bhakti, presenting a fully developed teaching that originated with the Bhagavad Gita. Bryant states that while classical yoga attempts to shut down the mind and senses, Bhakti Yoga in the Bhagavata teaches that the mind is transformed by filling it with thoughts of Krishna.

Matchett states that in addition to various didactic philosophical passages the Bhagavata also describes one of the activities that can lead to liberation (&quot;moksha&quot;) as listening to, reflecting on the stories of, and sharing devotion for Krishna with others. Bhakti is depicted in the Purana, adds Matchett, as both an overpowering emotion as well as a way of life that is rational and deliberately cultivated.

=== Samkhya ===
Surendranath Dasgupta describes the theistic Samkhya philosophy taught by Kapila in the Bhagavata as the dominant philosophy in the text.

Sheridan points out that in the Third Canto, Kapila is described as an avatar of Vishnu, born as the son of the Prajapati Kardama, in order to share the knowledge of self-realization and liberation with his mother, Devahuti; in the Eleventh Canto, Krishna also teaches Samkhya to Uddhava, describing the world as an illusion, and the individual as dreaming, even while in the waking state. Krishna expounds Samhkhya and Yoga as the way of overcoming the dream, with the goal being Krishna Himself.

Sheridan also states that the treatment of Samkhya in the Bhagavata is also changed by its emphasis on devotion, as does Dasgupta, adding it is somewhat different from other classical Samkhya texts.

=== Advaita ===
Kumar Das and Sheridan state that the Bhagavata frequently discusses a distinctly advaitic or non-dualistic philosophy of Shankara. Rukmani adds that the concept of moksha is explained as &quot;Ekatva&quot; (Oneness) and &quot;Sayujya&quot; (Absorption, intimate union), wherein one is completely lost in Brahman (Self, Supreme Being, one&#x27;s true nature). This, states Rukmani, is proclamation of a &#x27;return of the individual soul to the Absolute and its merging into the Absolute&#x27;, which is unmistakably advaitic. The Bhagavata Purana is also stated to parallel the non-duality of Adi Shankara by Sheridan. As an example:

Scholars describe this philosophy as built on the foundation of non-dualism in the Upanishads, and term it as &quot;Advaitic Theism&quot;. This term combines the seemingly contradictory beliefs of a personal God that can be worshiped with a God that is immanent in creation and in one&#x27;s own self. God in this philosophy is within and is not different from the individual self, states Sheridan, and transcends the limitations of specificity and temporality. Sheridan also describes Advaitic Theism as a &quot;both/and&quot; solution for the questions of whether God is transcendent or immanent, and credits the Bhāgavata with a &#x27;truly creative religious moment&#x27; for introducing this philosophy. The text suggests that God Vishnu and the soul (atman) in all beings is one in quality (nirguna).

Bryant states that the monism in Bhagavata Purana is certainly built on Vedanta foundations, but not exactly the same as the monism of Adi Shankara. The Bhagavata asserts, according to Bryant, that the empirical and the spiritual universe are both metaphysical realities, and manifestations of the same Oneness, just like heat and light are &quot;real but different&quot; manifestations of sunlight. Bryant notes that the tenth book of the Bhagavata does not, as is conventional for non-dualist schools, understand Krishna&#x27;s form to be a &quot;secondary derivation,&quot; which can be subsumed within the impersonal absolute. Rather than describe Brahman to be ultimately formless, the tenth book ascribes an &quot;eternal personal element&quot; to Brahman.

=== Dharma ===
Kurmas Das states the Bhagavata Purana conceptualizes a form of Dharma that competes with that of the Vedas, suggesting that Bhakti ultimately leads to Self-knowledge, Moksha (salvation) and bliss. The earliest mention of bhakti is found in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad verse 6.23, but scholars such as Max Muller state that the word Bhakti appears only once in this Upanishad; and that being in one last verse of the epilogue it could be a later addition, and that the context suggests that it is a panentheistic idea and not theistic.

Scholarly consensus sees bhakti as a post-Vedic movement that developed primarily during the Puranas era of Indian history. The Bhagavata Purana develops the Bhakti concept more elaborately, states Cutler, proposing &quot;worship without ulterior motive and with kind disposition towards all&quot; as Dharma. T.R. Sharma states the text includes in its scope intellectual and emotional devotion as well as Advaita Vedanta ideas.

The text does not subscribe, states Gupta and Valpey, to context-less &quot;categorical notions of justice or morality&quot;, but suggests that &quot;Dharma depends on context&quot;. They add that in a positive or neutral context, ethics and moral behavior must be adhered to; and when persistently persecuted by evil, anything that reduces the strength of the &quot;evil and poisonous circumstances&quot; is good. That which is motivated by, furthers, and enables bhakti is the golden standard of Dharma.

=== Yoga ===

Sarma states that the Bhagavata Purana describes all steps of yoga practice, and characterizes yoga as bhakti, asserting that the most important aspect is the spiritual goal. According to Sarma and Rukmani, the text dedicates numerous chapters to yoga, such as Canto 10 (chapter 11), which begins with a declaration that Siddhi results from concentrating one&#x27;s mind on Krishna, adding this substitutes the concept of a &quot;personal god&quot; in the Yogasutras of Patanjali, and contrasts with Patanjali&#x27;s view that Siddhi is considered powerful but an obstacle to Samadhi.

In other chapters of the text, Rukmani states, Śuka describes different meditations on aspects of Krishna, in a way that is similar to the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. However, adds Bryant, the Bhagavata Purana recommends the object of concentration as Krishna, thus folding in yoga as a form of bhakti and the &quot;union with the divine&quot;. Bryant describes the synthesis of ideas in Bhagavata Purana as:

Sheridan as well as Pintchman affirm Bryant&#x27;s view, adding that the Vedantic view emphasized in the Bhagavata is non-dualist, as described within a reality of plural forms.

=== Maya ===
In Vedanta, &quot;Maya&quot; is frequently depicted as a deceptive or deluding energy. Conversely, the Bhagavata Purana presents &quot;Maya&quot; as divine energy through which Krishna manifests the material universe, including its elements, universes, bodies, senses, and minds, contributing to the richness and diversity of the phenomenal world. This process is not just entrapment but also a path to liberation for beings caught in the cycle of birth and death. Maya&#x27;s illusionary powers, though binding individuals to temporal existence, ultimately facilitate their spiritual growth and release.

=== Suffering ===
In explaining suffering, the Bhagavata Purana acknowledges karma as a central principle, where actions in past lives influence current and future existences, shaping one&#x27;s destiny and experiences in subsequent lifetimes. However, it also critiques the adequacy of karma in fully explaining suffering and explores time (&quot;kala&quot;) as a significant factor in suffering. Time, personified by Sudarshana Chakra, is shown as an unstoppable force that brings both end and renewal, acting indiscriminately upon all beings. Despite time&#x27;s overwhelming power, the text suggests that sincere devotion (&quot;bhakti&quot;) to God and surrender to the divine can enable devout souls to overcome the influence of time and karma, ultimately leading to spiritual liberation (&quot;moksha&quot;).

=== Lila ===
The Bhagavata Purana argues that the play of God (&quot;lila&quot;) is central to understanding his actions in the world. Despite having everything and being able to make his wishes reality, Krishna engages in various activities and interactions with devotees out of joy and divine play, rather than out of any necessity or compulsion (SB 1.10.24). By participating in Krishna&#x27;s lila, individuals can transcend the limitations and suffering of the material world and ultimately achieve liberation from time&#x27;s constraints.

==Significance==
The source of many popular stories of Krishna&#x27;s pastimes for centuries in the Indian subcontinent, the Bhagavata Purana is widely recognized as the best-known and most influential of the &quot;Puranas,&quot; and as a part of Vedic literature &quot;(&quot;the Puranas, Itihasa epics, and Upanishads) is referred to as the &quot;Fifth Veda&quot;. It is important in Indian religious literature for its emphasis on the practice of devotion compared to the more theoretical approach of the Bhagavad Gita, for challenging the ritualism of the Vedas, and for its extended description of a God in human form.
=== Relation to other texts ===
The Bhagavata Purana aligns itself with canonical texts like Brahma Sutras and Rigveda by echoing their verses at various points throughout its narrative. It claims equality with the Vedas and reinterprets their themes to emphasize the supremacy of Krishna. It transforms the descriptions of Vishnu&#x27;s deeds found in the Vishnu Sukta into narratives centered around Krishna&#x27;s actions (verse 10.51.38). The Bhagavata Purana does not directly reference the Bhagavad Gita, which is part of the Mahabharata. Instead, it includes the teachings similar to those found in the Bhagavad Gita in the form of dialogues between Krishna and Uddhava in Canto 11.

=== Hindu Festivals ===
The stories in the Bhagavata Purana are also the legends quoted by one generation to the next in Vaishnavism, during annual festivals such as Holi and Diwali.

The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) celebrates the promise of Canto 12, Chapter 13, Verse 13 by distributing sets of Srimad Bhagavatam leading up to the full-moon day of the month of Bhādra (Bhādra Purnima) in India and around the world. 

=== Vaishnavism ===
==== Gaudiya Vaishnavism ====

The Bhagavata has played a significant role in the emergence of the Krishna-bhakti (Gaudiya Vaishnavism) movement of Chaitanya (1486–1534 CE), in Bengal. The scriptural basis for the belief that Chaitanya is an avatar of Krishna is found in verses such as the following (&quot;Disciples&quot; of Swami Prabhupada translation):

Chaitanya is commonly referred to as &#x27;Gauranga&#x27; in regards to His golden complexion (as detailed in the Gauranga article, the Sanskrit word &#x27;ākṛṣṇaṁ&#x27; means &#x27;not blackish&#x27; and &#x27;golden&#x27;), and is most notable for popularising the Hare Krishna maha-mantra. In regards to not being explicitly named as an avatar (unlike others such as Kalki) in the Bhagavata, this is also explained (A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada translation):

The key word in this verse in regards to Krishna incarnating in the age of Kali Yuga is &#x27;channaḥ&#x27; (&quot;S&quot;anskrit छन्न&quot;),&quot; which means &#x27; hidden&#x27;, &#x27;secret&#x27;, or &#x27;disguised&#x27;. In Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Chaitanya is accepted as a hidden avatar of Krishna who appeared in the age of Kali (also known as &#x27;the Iron Age&#x27; and &#x27;the age of quarrel&#x27;) as His own devotee to show the easiest way to achieve Krishna Consciousness. Modern Gaudiya movements such as the Gaudiya Math (established by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in 1920) and others established by disciples of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, such as the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966) and the Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math (by Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar in 1941), trace their disciplic lineages back directly to Chaitanya.

==== Other Vaishnava Traditions ====
In the 15th–16th century Ekasarana Dharma in Assam, a panentheistic tradition whose proponents, Sankardeva and Madhavdeva, acknowledge that their theological positions are rooted in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, purged of doctrines that find no place in Assamese Vaishnavism and adding a monist commentary instead.

In northern and western India the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; has influenced the &quot;Hari Bhakti Vilasa&quot; and &quot;Haveli&quot;-style Krishna temples found in Braj region near Mathura-Vrindavan. The text complements the Pancharatra Agama texts of Vaishnavism. While the text focuses on Krishna &quot;Narayana (Vishnu) himself appears and explains how Brahma and Shiva should never be seen as independent and different from him&quot;. The sixth book includes the feminine principle as &quot;Shakti&quot;, or goddess Devi, conceptualizing her as the &quot;energy and creative power&quot; of the masculine yet a manifestation of a sexless Brahman, presented in a language suffused with Hindu monism.

===Jainism and Buddhism===
The fifth canto of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; is significant for its inclusion of legends about the first Tirthankara of Jainism, Rishabha, as an avatar of Vishnu. Further, his father Nabhi is mentioned as one of the Manus and his mother Marudevi also finds a mention. It further mentions the 100 sons of Rishabha including Bharata. While homage to Shakyamuni Buddha is included in by declaring him as an avatar of Vishnu, the interpretation of Buddhism-related stories in the Purana range from honor to ambivalence to polemics wherein prophecies predict some will distort and misrepresent the teachings of the Vedas, and attempt to sow confusion. According to T. S. Rukmani, the Bhagavata Purana is also significant in asserting that Yoga practice is a form of Bhakti.

=== The Arts ===

The Bhagavata Purana played a key role in the history of Indian theatre, music, and dance, particularly through the tradition of &quot;Ras&quot; &quot;Leela&quot;. These are dramatic enactments about Krishna&#x27;s pastimes. Some of the text&#x27;s legends have inspired secondary theatre literature such as the eroticism in Gita Govinda. While Indian dance and music theatre traces its origins to the ancient Sama Veda and Natyasastra texts, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; and other Krishna-related texts such as &quot;Harivamsa&quot; and &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; have inspired numerous choreographic themes.

Many &#x27;&quot;Ras&quot;&#x27; plays dramatise episodes related in the &quot;Rasa Panchadhyayi&quot; (&quot;Five chapters of the Celestial Dance&quot;; Canto 10, Chapters 29–33) of the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot;. The &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; also encourages theatrical performance as a means to propagate the faith (BP 11.11.23 and 36, 11.27.35 and 44, etc.), and this has led to the emergence of several theatrical forms centred on Krishna all across India. Canto 10 of &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; is regarded as the inspiration for many classical dance styles such as Kathak, Odissi, Manipuri and Bharatnatyam. Bryant summarizes the influence as follows,


== Modern reception ==
In the 20th century, the Bhagavata Purana became widely popular as it spread beyond India, translated into over twenty languages and respected by people worldwide.

=== Bhaktivedanta Swami ===
Bhaktivedanta Swami significantly impacted the global recognition of the Bhagavata Purana. Bhaktivedanta Swami, raised in a devout Vaishnava family, embraced the Caitanya tradition in 1932. Between 1962 and 1965, he devoted himself to translating the Bhagavata Purana into English, a departure from earlier works focusing on Caitanya&#x27;s life and teachings. While lacking formal traditional education, he was deeply familiar with the teachings of Caitanya and the insights of ancient commentators through self-study. He made the Bhagavata Purana meaningful to modern readers, and his way of explaining the text made it easier to understand and relevant to modern world. He appealed to young people who were looking for something different from mainstream religion.

==Commentaries and translations==

=== Commentaries ===
The Bhagavata Purana is one of the most commented texts in Indian literature. There is a saying in Sanskrit – vidyā bhāgavatāvadhi – Bhāgavatam is the limit of one&#x27;s learning. Hence throughout the centuries it attracted a host of commentators from all schools of Krishna worshippers. Over eighty medieval era &quot;Bhāṣya&quot; (scholarly reviews and commentaries) in Sanskrit alone are known, and many more commentaries exist in various Indian languages. The oldest exegetical commentary presently known is &quot;Tantra-Bhagavata&quot; from the Pancaratra school. Other commentaries include:

<text>Patrice Leconte (; born 12 November 1947) is a French film director, actor, comic strip writer, and screenwriter.

==Life and career==
Leconte grew up in Tours, and began making little amateur films at 15. He went to Paris in 1967 and studied at Institut des hautes études cinématographiques. While attending film school in the late 1960s, Leconte also worked as a cartoonist, in particular for the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Pilote&quot;. He directed his first feature film in 1976, and had a number of major successes with comedy films that were barely distributed outside France. He first came to international attention in 1989 with &quot;Monsieur Hire&quot;, which was shown at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival and which was a radical departure from his previous work. Although he had already directed more than half a dozen features, many foreign critics, unfamiliar with his previous work, essentially treated him as a newcomer. Since then, he has alternated between films such as &quot;Ridicule&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;homme du train&quot; which have had success in the international arthouse market, and others, like &quot;Les Grands Ducs&quot;, whose appeal has been limited to France.
In the 2000s, Patrice Leconte received more recognition in the United States with the successful United States releases of &quot;Girl on the Bridge&quot;, &quot;The Widow of Saint-Pierre&quot;, &quot;Man on the Train&quot; and &quot;Intimate Strangers&quot; (Paramount Classics released three of these films in the United States). Ryan Mottesheard of IndieWIRE wrote: &quot;you could even argue that no other foreign filmmaker (INCLUDING Pedro Almodóvar) has had as strong of an impact on United States arthouses.&quot;

An English language remake of Leconte&#x27;s film &quot;Man on the Train&quot; was remade by an independent Hollywood studio in 2011, and two others are in &#x27;development&#x27;: &quot;Intimate Strangers&quot; and &quot;My Best Friend&quot;.

Patrice Leconte&#x27;s film, &quot;The Suicide Shop&quot;, was screened at the Newport Beach Film Festival in Newport Beach, California, on 28 April and 2 May 2013.

<doc id="1039559" wikidata="Q7951362" url="?curid=1039559" title="WJR">
<text>WJR (760 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Detroit, Michigan, owned by Cumulus Media, with a news/talk format. Most of WJR&#x27;s broadcast studios, along with its newsroom and offices, are in the Fisher Building in Detroit&#x27;s New Center area. A tower atop the Fisher Building relays WJR&#x27;s audio to the transmitter site, and at one time WJR-FM (currently WDVD) also used this tower. There is an additional satellite studio in the Wintergarden of the GM Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit.

WJR is a Class A clear channel station, operating with 50,000 watts, the maximum power for AM stations in the United States, around the clock. WJR&#x27;s 1934 transmitter building — which has been called &quot;one of the best Art Deco transmitter buildings ever&quot; — and transmitter tower are located near (and visible from) the intersection of Sibley and Grange Roads in Riverview, Michigan.

Due to WJR&#x27;s low transmitting frequency and high power, omnidirectional signal, plus the region&#x27;s mostly flat land and good ground conductivity, the station has unusually large daytime coverage, equivalent to that of a full-power FM station. Its daytime signal provides at least secondary coverage to most of the southern Lower Peninsula, as well as almost half of Ohio (with Cleveland and Toledo getting city-grade coverage) and slivers of Indiana and Pennsylvania. At night it can be heard throughout much of eastern North America with a good radio.

WJR programming is streamed via the web, and is simulcast on WDVD&#x27;s 96.3 FM HD2 subchannel. WJR is also licensed to broadcast a digital hybrid (HD) signal.

WJR is Michigan&#x27;s primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System.

==Programming==
WJR airs a mix of local and nationally syndicated talk shows and local sports. As of June 2023, the station operates a fully local lineup during the daytime hours, with Paul W. Smith (the station&#x27;s longtime morning host) hosting the lunch-hour time slot, Guy Gordon in morning drive, late morning hosts Kevin Dietz and Tom Jordan, and afternoon personalities Chris Renwick and Mitch Albom. Brokered programming airs in the early fringe time slot. It is the Detroit outlet for Westwood One syndicated talk shows Mark Levin, Ben Shapiro and Red Eye Radio. WJR is the flagship station of the Michigan State Spartans football and men&#x27;s basketball and was the flagship for the Michigan Panthers professional football team. Late nights and weekends, world and national news from Fox News Radio begins each hour.

In 2006, WJR picked up the nationally syndicated &quot;Handyman Show&quot; with Glenn Haege, which originates from Detroit, and previously aired on WXYT and WDFN. &quot;The Handyman Show&quot; is a nationally syndicated show, originating from WJR&#x27;s own studios, as is also the case with several other weekend shows such as &quot;The C.A.R. Show&quot; and &quot;The Real Estate Insiders&quot;. Music programming on WJR has been phased out almost entirely over the past two decades. As of June 2014, the only music-oriented show on the station was the &quot;Renfro Valley Gatherin&#x27;&quot;, aired early Sunday mornings.

==History==

===WCX===
WJR traces its history to May 4, 1922. Effective December 1, 1921, the U.S. government for the first time adopted regulations formally defining &quot;broadcasting stations&quot;. The wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) was designated for entertainment broadcasts, while 485 meters (619 kHz) was reserved for broadcasting official weather and other government reports. On May 4, 1922, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; newspaper was issued a license, with the randomly assigned callsign WCX, for operation on both broadcasting wavelengths.

WCX made its debut, broadcasting from the &quot;Free Press&quot; Building, on the same day it was licensed. The inaugural broadcast included an address by Michigan governor Alex J. Groesbeck. 1922 saw a rapid expansion in the number of broadcasting stations, most sharing the single entertainment wavelength of 360 meters, which required progressively more complicated time sharing schedules among stations in the same region. The &quot;Detroit News&quot;, which operated station WWJ, bristled at having to suffer the &quot;handicap&quot; of being required to give up some airtime to WCX, which had, in the words of the &quot;News&quot;, decided to &quot;break in&quot;.

In late September 1922 a second entertainment wavelength, 400 meters (750 kHz), was made available for &quot;Class B&quot; stations, which had higher powers and better quality equipment and programming. Both WCX and WWJ qualified to use this new wavelength on a timesharing basis, and WCX ended use of the 485 meter &quot;market and weather&quot; wavelength. In early 1923, the United States further expanded the broadcast station frequencies into a band running from 550 to 1350 kHz. The Class B frequency of 580 kHz was designated for use by qualified stations in the &quot;Detroit/Dearborn&quot; area, and both WCX and WWJ were assigned to this frequency.

On December 8, 1924, WCX opened studios atop the new Book-Cadillac Hotel in downtown Detroit, with transmitter facilities on the roof. Hometown poet Edgar A. Guest and the Jean Goldkette orchestra participated in the program. In January 1925, WWJ&#x27;s reassignment to 850 kHz left WCX as the sole station remaining on 580 kHz.

===WJR-WCX===
On August 20, 1925, the Jewett Radio &amp; Phonograph Company received a license for a new station, WJR. The company also took over WCX, consolidating operations in Pontiac, Michigan, as WJR-WCX on 580 kHz.

On January 1, 1927, the station was taken over by George A. Richards, a local Oakland-Pontiac automobile dealer. Richards would later also assume control of WGAR in Cleveland and KMPC in Los Angeles. WJR adopted the slogan &quot;The Goodwill Station&quot; and on May 9, 1927, began carrying programs from the recently formed NBC Blue Network.

In mid-1927, the joint stations moved to 680 kHz. On November 11, 1928, the Federal Radio Commission implemented a major AM band reorganization, under the provisions of its General Order 40. This reallocation divided stations into three classes, which became known as &quot;Clear&quot;, &quot;Regional&quot; and &quot;Local&quot;. WJR-WCX was assigned as the sole North American occupant of the clear channel frequency of 750 kHz.

On December 16, 1928, the station moved from the newspaper&#x27;s offices to its current location in the Fisher Building in uptown Detroit, and began identifying as &quot;WJR Detroit, from the Golden Tower of the Fisher Building&quot;. In 1929, the license was transferred to &quot;WJR, Goodwill Station, Inc.&quot;, and on April 22, 1929, &quot;WCX&quot; was formally dropped from the dual call sign, with the station becoming just WJR. In 1931, WJR raised its power to 10,000 watts. The station switched network affiliation from NBC Blue to CBS on September 29, 1935, and at the same time station officials formally dedicated WJR&#x27;s new 50,000-watt transmitter. On March 29, 1941, the station moved from 750 to 760 kHz, in accordance with the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement frequency reallocations.

Although station owner George A. Richards purchased the Detroit Lions professional football team in 1934, WJR did not begin to broadcast their games until the 1938 season.

WJR signed on an FM outlet in 1948, on 96.3 MHz. This station was known as WJR-FM until 1982, when it became WHYT. The station is now WDVD.

===Capital Cities ownership===

Richards died in May 1951, and in 1964, Goodwill Stations was sold to Capital Cities Communications, which later merged with ABC and still later with the Walt Disney Company. Upon the sale, WJR&#x27;s slogan became &quot;The Great Voice of the Great Lakes&quot;. Also in 1964, WJR acquired full rights to Detroit Tigers baseball games, with announcers Ernie Harwell and George Kell, who had begun broadcasting Tiger games in 1960. Previously, WJR had carried only night games with day games on WKMH and WJBK. The station became the flagship of the Tiger Baseball Network.In the late 1960s, WJR also became the flagship station for Detroit Red Wings hockey and Detroit Pistons basketball.

The station&#x27;s advertising campaigns and jingles included &quot;W-J-R ... Radio 76 ... Cares About Detroit&quot; and &quot;This is America&#x27;s finest - AM stereo 76&quot;. J. P. McCarthy regularly stated, in a nonchalant way, &quot;This is the world&#x27;s greatest radio station, WJR Detroit&quot;, with a manner that made it seem like the most obvious of facts.

WJR broadcast in AM stereo, using the C-QUAM system, from 1982 to 2005, and was received in stereo at great distances at night. WJR&#x27;s Detroit Tigers home games were broadcast in stereo, as were the Thanksgiving Day Parades.

For much of its history, WJR served as a powerhouse in Michigan sports radio. However, in 2001, the station lost its longtime flagship rights to the Detroit Tigers and Detroit Red Wings, both of which moved to CBS-owned WXYT and WXYT-FM. Then, in 2005, the station dropped its status as the flagship station for Michigan Wolverines football and basketball in favor of a flagship rights deal with the Michigan State Spartans. WJR had served as flagship for Michigan State prior to 1976.

===Cumulus Media ownership===
WJR was sold with other ABC Radio stations to Citadel Broadcasting on June 12, 2007. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.

WJR broadcast an HD Radio signal for about a two-year period (2006–2008) (also on WDRQ&#x27;s HD2 digital subchannel), eventually eliminating night time HD radio use, then dropping it completely on both WJR and WDRQ-HD2, returning to only its signal.

On November 20, 2015, WJR announced it would take over as flagship station of the Detroit Lions in 2016, with the team moving over from WXYT-FM. The live sporting events meant that regular programming might be pre-empted. (During parts of the season when Michigan football and Tiger baseball were both on, Tiger baseball took precedence, and if a Michigan football game was either just beginning or really good when Tiger baseball came on, an announcement would come on as the football game faded out, stating the need to switch due to contractual obligations. Otherwise, the announcement would just simply state the station is leaving the Michigan game for the Tigers. Either way, listeners were directed to CKLW in nearby Windsor, Ontario, for the conclusion of the game).

On December 18, 2020, the Detroit Lions announced that Audacy signed a deal for WXYT-FM to become the flagship station for the 2021 NFL season after a five-year partnership.

For many years, WJR aired Rush Limbaugh in early afternoons. Following Limbaugh&#x27;s death in 2021, Dan Bongino took over the noon to 3 pm time slot on WJR and many other Cumulus stations. Bongino&#x27;s show is distributed by Westwood One, which is the national syndication arm of Cumulus Media. Following disputes with Westwood One and Cumulus over a COVID-19 vaccine mandate, Bongino announced plans to end his Cumulus radio show at the end of his contract 18 months in the future. Cumulus began phasing his show out of its stations&#x27; lineups, including WJR in June 2023. At that time, WJR announced a new lineup of local personalities weekdays from 5 am to 8 pm. Morning show host Paul W. Smith would move to early afternoons in place of Bongino, with Guy Gordon who previously hosted afternoons moving to morning drive. New shows hosted by Chris Renwick and Sean Baligian were also added to the schedule.

==Father Coughlin broadcasts==

Father Charles Coughlin was a local Roman Catholic priest, whose controversial weekly radio sermons largely originated at WJR. At the height of his popularity, Coughlin reported receiving thousands of letters daily. He was also extremely polarizing, described by one biographer as &quot;a man of kindness and beautiful understanding&quot;, while another labeled him &quot;the father of hate radio&quot;.

Father Coughlin made his radio debut on October 17, 1926, speaking over WJR via a microphone installed by the station at the altar at the Shrine of the Little Flower. His commentaries initially addressed perceived social ills, opposing prohibition, divorce and birth control as damaging to American society. During the Great Depression he moved heavily into political issues. On October 5, 1930, he began a weekly broadcast carried over the CBS network that originated at that network&#x27;s Detroit affiliate, WXYZ. But a year later CBS dropped him for being too divisive, by implementing a ban on commercially sponsored religious programs. With the assistance of WJR station manager Leo Fitzpatrick, Father Coughlin responded by forming his own network, with WJR as the key station. &quot;The Golden Hour&quot; broadcasts began on October 4, 1931, initially on about 20 stations. By October 16 of the next year this expanded to 26 stations, said at the time to be &quot;the largest independent network ever arranged&quot;, and by early 1938 the network had grown to 58 stations.

Coughlin&#x27;s fervent anti-communism led to the perception that he was in favor of the rise of fascism in Europe, and he was accused of being anti-Jewish. Although initially supported by the local church hierarchy, his personal attacks on political figures eventually resulted in official restrictions and rebukes. In 1939 the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) adopted a code of conduct that included restrictions on controversial commercial broadcasts, which was seen as primarily directed toward Coughlin, and WJR vice president John F. Pratt argued that &quot;the provision on controversial subjects seems to many of us the first shackle on freedom of speech on the radio&quot;. The NAB code led to a loss of participating stations, and this, combined with subject matter restrictions imposed by his church superiors, resulted in Coughlin ending his radio broadcasts.

<text>Heavyweights is a 1995 American comedy film directed by Steven Brill and written by Brill with Judd Apatow. It stars Tom McGowan, Aaron Schwartz, Shaun Weiss, Tom Hodges, Leah Lail, Paul Feig, Kenan Thompson, David Bowe, Max Goldblatt, Robert Zalkind, Patrick LaBrecque, Jeffrey Tambor, Jerry Stiller, Anne Meara, and Ben Stiller (in a dual role), and follows a fat camp for kids that is taken over by a fitness entrepreneur as its campers work to overthrow him.

The film was released on February 17, 1995. Though it was initially met with mixed reviews, it found a following on home video and cable TV airings and has since become a cult film.

==Plot==
When school ends for the summer, Gerry Garner is told by his parents that they are sending him to Camp Hope, a weight loss camp for boys. Initially reluctant, Gerry meets enthusiastic camp counselor Pat, and befriends the other campers, who have smuggled in enough junk food for the entire summer. The first night at Camp Hope brings the revelation that the original owners, the Bushkins, have declared bankruptcy and the camp has been bought by fitness entrepreneur Tony Perkis Jr., who plans to transform the camp’s weight loss program into a best-selling infomercial.

Tony replaces the camp’s beloved activities, including go-karts and ”the Blob”, with a punishing exercise regimen. Pat is replaced by the strict new counselor Lars and the campers endure a painful softball game against their more athletic, over-competitive rivals Camp MVP. When Tony purges the cabins&#x27; hidden food caches, camper Josh stands up for Gerry by taunting Tony and is sent home without a refund. Tony arranges a dance with the girls&#x27; summer camp named Camp Magnolia to humiliate the boys into losing weight, but counselors Tim, Pat, and camp nurse Julie convince everyone to enjoy themselves together. Josh returns to Camp Hope revealing that his lawyer father has threatened to sue Tony for kicking his son out without a refund.

Gerry and his friends sneak into Tony&#x27;s office in search of their confiscated snacks, and learn that Tony has intercepted all the campers’ letters to their families, including a letter that Gerry wrote to his grandmother. They discover a secret food stash used by most of the camp, leading them to gain weight, and Tony forces the boys on a 20-mile hike, preparing to endanger their lives for the sake of fitness. The boys trick Tony into falling into a pit and imprison him at camp in a makeshift cell, electrified with a bug zapper. With Pat, Julie, and Tim on their side, the campers take back control of Camp Hope, tying up Lars in the woods with Tony&#x27;s other counselors, and celebrating with a binge eating bonfire party. Lars ultimately sides with the campers due to threats of deportation.

The next morning, Pat rallies the campers to take responsibility for themselves and start losing weight and they all start a healthier regimen while making Camp Hope fun again. The boys&#x27; parents arrive for visiting day and are shown a video documenting Tony&#x27;s cruelty, which is interrupted by Tony, having escaped his cell. Exchanging blows with Gerry&#x27;s father, he attempts a series of backflips but knocks himself out. As Tony is taken away, Tony Perkis Sr. arrives and promises to refund everyone’s money, but announces that the camp will be closed. The boys ask for the camp to stay open. Pat – with 18 years&#x27; experience and the support of Gerry and the others – agrees to assume responsibility for Camp Hope, which Tony Sr. allows.

Under Pat&#x27;s leadership, the campers restore their favorite activities, and prepare to face Camp MVP in their annual competition. Camp MVP takes the lead in the first event, an obstacle course, but Camp Hope catches up in the second round, a test of knowledge. In the final go-kart race, Gerry wins the competition for Camp Hope. Demonstrating that having fun is more important than winning, Pat throws the trophy in the lake and seals his romance with Julie with a kiss. As Camp Hope celebrates their victory, Gerry thanks Pat for the best summer of his life.

During the credits, Pat, the campers, and Lars sing the &quot;Camp Hope&quot; song.

In a post-credits scene, Tony is now an unsuccessful door-to-door salesman selling healing crystals.

==Production==
&quot;Heavyweights&quot; was filmed over the course of two months in North Carolina at 2 separate camps, Camp Pinnacle and Camp Ton-A-Wandah.
Filming started on March 28, 1994 and finished on May 25, 1994.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s original score was composed by J.A.C. Redford. A soundtrack was not released, but the film featured eleven songs:

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 50% based on 10 reviews, with an average score of 5.4/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

According to Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;&quot;Heavyweights&quot; is really two movies in one, and they don&#x27;t mesh. One movie is a no-holds-barred spoof of a Tony Little- or Susan Powter-style fitness merchant [...] The other movie is a conventional family comedy that pokes lighthearted fun at the chubby young campers.&quot; In a positive review, Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Make no mistake about it, Disney&#x27;s &#x27;Heavyweights&#x27; is the best movie about calorically challenged pubescent boys at summer camp ever made. Bar none.&quot;

In 2012, on the release of the Blu-ray, critic Brian Ordorff gave the film a grade of &quot;B&quot; and wrote: &quot;Time has been kind to the discarded fat camp movie, finding &quot;Heavyweights&quot; more digestible these days, after years spent processing the askew sense of humor shared by Apatow and Company.&quot;

===Box office===
The film made $17.6 million at the box office and was not successful theatrically, though the film has garnered a cult following.

==Home media==
&quot;Heavyweights&quot; was released on VHS on August 15, 1995, LaserDisc on February 20, 1996, and released on DVD on March 4, 2003. Heavyweights was released on Blu-ray on December 11, 2012. It was also included on Disney+ in November 2019.

<doc id="1039562" wikidata="Q7893260" url="?curid=1039562" title="United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.">
<text>United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304 (1936), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court concerning the foreign affairs powers of the president of the United States. It held that the President, as the nation&#x27;s &quot;sole organ&quot; in international relations, was therefore innately vested with significant powers over foreign affairs, far exceeding those permitted in domestic matters or accorded to the U.S. Congress. The Court&#x27;s majority reasoned that although the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly provide for such authority, the powers are implicit in the President&#x27;s constitutional role as commander-in-chief and head of the executive branch.

&quot;Curtiss-Wright&quot; was the first decision to establish that the President&#x27;s plenary power is independent of congressional permission. It is credited with providing the legal precedent for further expansions of executive power in the foreign sphere.

==Background==
In June 1932, the Chaco War broke out between Paraguay and Bolivia. Both belligerents were poor and relied on outside military assistance, which aroused interest among American armament manufacturers. However, in response to national antiwar sentiment, widespread revulsion at the conduct of the war, and diplomatic pressure from the United Kingdom and the League of Nations, the US government sought to terminate any developing arms trade.

To that end, on May 24, 1934, the US Congress approved a joint resolution providing that &quot;if the President finds that the prohibition of the sale of arms and munitions of war in the United States to those countries engaged in conflict in the Chaco may contribute to the establishment of peace between those countries,&quot; he was authorized to proclaim an embargo on American arms shipments to the belligerents with violators subject to a fine, imprisonment, or both. The same day, US President Franklin Roosevelt signed the joint resolution and issued a proclamation reaffirming its language and establishing an embargo. On November 14, 1935, that proclamation was revoked.

Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. was indicted for violating both the joint resolution and the embargo by conspiring to sell aircraft machine guns to Bolivia. It demurred to the indictment by arguing that the embargo and proclamation were void, as Congress had unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the executive branch and thus given the President &quot;unfettered discretion&quot; to make a decision that should have been determined by Congress.

==Issues==
The defendant raised several issues for consideration by the Court:
# Did the joint resolution passed by Congress grant unconstitutional authority and legislative power to the President in violation of the non-delegation doctrine?
# Was the President required by considerations of due process to make findings of fact in support of the proclamation?
# Did the revocation of the May 1934 proclamation eliminate the penalty for its violation?

==Decision==
In a 7–1 decision authored by Justice George Sutherland, the Court ruled that the U.S. government, through the President, is categorically allowed great foreign affairs powers that are independent of the US Constitution:

The Constitution does not explicitly state that all ability to conduct foreign policy is vested in the President, but the Court concluded that such power is given implicitly since the executive of a sovereign nation is by its very nature empowered to conduct foreign affairs. The Court found &quot;sufficient warrant for the broad discretion vested in the President to determine whether the enforcement of the statute will have a beneficial effect upon the reestablishment of peace in the affected countries.&quot; In other words, the President is better suited to determine the actions and the policies that best serve the nation&#x27;s interests abroad:

By contrast, Congress lacks such an inherent role under the Constitution, which accords broad discretion to the President alone because of the vastness and the complexity of international relations.

== Legacy ==
The ruling not only upheld export limitations on the grounds of national security but also established the broader principle of executive supremacy in national security and in foreign affairs; this was one of the reasons advanced in the 1950s for the nearly successful attempt to add the Bricker Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

The Court has not recognized the full scope of executive power suggested by Justice Sutherland&#x27;s sweeping language; consequently, it has sometimes presented contradictory rulings about foreign policy powers between the President and the Congress. In &quot;Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc.&quot; (1976), the Court validated presidential restrictions on oil imports based on the very broad congressional language that delegated apparently unlimited regulatory authority to the executive branch.

Despite its controversy, &quot;Curtiss-Wright&quot; is among the Supreme Court&#x27;s most influential decisions. Most cases involving conflicts between the executive and legislative branches involve political questions that the courts refuse to adjudicate. Therefore, the sweeping language of &quot;Curtiss-Wright&quot; is regularly cited to support the executive branch&#x27;s claims of power to act without congressional authorization in foreign affairs, especially if there is no judicial intervention to interpret the text&#x27;s meaning. However, the Supreme Court in the 2015 &quot;Zivotofsky v. Kerry&quot; decision made clear that Curtiss-Wright was incorrect in describing presidential power over foreign affairs as &quot;plenary and exclusive&quot;. The Court in Zivotofsky wrote that: &quot;United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 320, does not support a broader definition of the Executive’s power over foreign relations that would permit the President alone to determine the whole content of the Nation’s foreign policy. The Executive is not free from the ordinary controls and checks of Congress merely because foreign affairs are at issue.&quot;

<doc id="1039563" wikidata="Q6673260" url="?curid=1039563" title="The Few">
<text>The Few were the airmen of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the aviators of the Fleet Air Arm, Royal Navy (RN) who fought the Battle of Britain in the Second World War. The term comes from Winston Churchill&#x27;s phrase &quot;Never, in the field of human conflict, was so much owed by so many to so few.&quot; It also alludes to Shakespeare&#x27;s famous speech in his play, &quot;Henry V&quot;: &quot;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers...&quot;

==Aircrew==
Nearly 3,000 men were awarded the &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; clasp. As six of the seven longest surviving veterans of the battle (Squadron Leader John Hart, Flight Lieutenant Archie McInnes, Flight Lieutenant Maurice Mounsdon, Air Vice-Marshal John Thornett Lawrence, Wing Commander Paul Farnes and Flight Lieutenant William Clark) died between June 2019 and May 2020 as of 8 May 2020, only one survivor of The Few is still living (Flying Officer John Hemingway).

By one tally, British RAF aircrew numbered 2,353 (80%) of the total of 2,927 flyers involved, with 407 Britons killed from a total of 510 losses. The remainder were not British, many coming from parts of the British Empire (particularly New Zealand, Canada, Australia, and South Africa), as well as exiles from many conquered European nations, particularly from Poland and Czechoslovakia. Other countries supplying smaller numbers included Belgium, France, Ireland (serving in the RAF as Ireland was officially neutral), Southern Rhodesia and the United States.

==Legacy==
Winston Churchill summed up the effect of the battle and the contribution of RAF Fighter Command, RAF Bomber Command, RAF Coastal Command and the Fleet Air Arm with the words, &quot;Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few&quot;. Pilots who fought in the battle have been known as &quot;The Few&quot; ever since; at times being specially commemorated on 15 September, &quot;Battle of Britain Day&quot;. On this day in 1940, the Luftwaffe embarked on their largest bombing attack yet, forcing the engagement of the entirety of RAF 11 Group in defence of London and the South East, which resulted in a decisive British victory that proved to mark a turning point in Britain&#x27;s favour.

As of 2022, there is only one surviving member of the group still alive, John Hemingway.
The Horrible Histories song called “The Few” commemorates these airmen and women, including Sir Douglas Bader.

==Memorials==

The aircrew are remembered on the Battle of Britain Memorial, Capel-le-Ferne, Kent, and their names are listed on the Battle of Britain Monument in London. The Battle of Britain Roll of Honour is held in Westminster Abbey in the RAF Chapel, and is paraded annually during the Service of Thanksgiving and re-dedication on Battle of Britain Sunday.

There is a preserved Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft known as &quot;The Last of The Many&quot;—a reference to the 1942 film &quot;The First of the Few&quot; starring Leslie Howard as R.J. Mitchell, designer of the Spitfire—which flies as part of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, along with a Supermarine Spitfire that flew in the Battle (one of five Spitfires in the Memorial Flight). As the Hurricane was the last production model of that type, it did not itself fly in the Battle.

In 2022 a sculpture, the Spirit of the Few Monument, was unveiled at the Kent Battle of Britain Museum.

==Statistics==
The Battle of Britain was considered officially by the RAF to have been fought between 10 July and 31 October 1940.
* RAF pilots claimed to have shot down about 2,600 German aircraft, but figures compiled later suggest that Luftwaffe losses were more likely nearer 2,300.
* Of 2,332 Allied pilots who flew fighters in the Battle, 38.90 per cent could claim some success in terms of enemy aircraft shot down.
* The number of pilots claiming more than one victory amounted to no more than 15 per cent of the total RAF pilots involved.
* To be proclaimed an &quot;ace&quot; a pilot had to have five confirmed victories. During the Battle of Britain just 188 RAF pilots achieved that distinction – eight per cent of the total involved. A further 237 of those RAF pilots claiming successes during the Battle became &quot;aces&quot; later in the war.
* There were four pilots who were &quot;ace in a day&quot; in the Battle of Britain: Archie McKellar (British), Antoni Głowacki (Polish), Ronald Hamlyn (British) and Brian Carbury (New Zealander).

===Leading aces===
The leading aces of the Battle of Britain (between 10 July and 31 October 1940) were:

===Other notable Battle of Britain pilots===

* Willie McKnight, 17 + kills by 18 September 1940, 6 + kills during the Battle
* David Moore Crook
* Alan Deere
* Harbourne Stephen
* Paddy Finucane
* Toni Glowacki, (Ace in a Day)
* A.G. &quot;Sailor&quot; Malan 
* Albert Gerald Lewis
* Stanisław Skalski
* Jan Zumbach
* Geoffrey Wellum
* John Hemingway, last surviving pilot of the Battle of Britain

==In popular culture==
&quot;The Few&quot;, a novel by Alex Kershaw, tells the stories of the men who flew in the Battle of Britain. , a Hollywood film similarly named &quot;The Few&quot; was in preparation for release in 2008, based on the story of real-life U.S. pilot Billy Fiske, who ignored his country&#x27;s neutrality rules and volunteered for the RAF. A &quot;Variety&quot; magazine outline of the film&#x27;s historical content was said in &quot;The Independent&quot; to have been described by Bill Bond, who conceived the Battle of Britain Monument in London, as &quot;Totally wrong. The whole bloody lot.&quot;

&quot;One of the Few&quot;, a sony by British band Pink Floyd from their album &quot;The Final Cut&quot; (1983), describes a war veteran&#x27;s return from the battlefield, specifically a pilot from the Battle of Britain, to pursue teaching, which connects to &quot;The Hero&#x27;s Return&quot;, another song from the album which is sung from the veteran&#x27;s perspective.

<text>Malott is a census-designated place (CDP) in Okanogan County, Washington, United States, within the Greater Omak Area. The population was 487 at the 2010 census.

Malott sits on the western bank of the Okanogan River and has bridge access to U.S. Route 97. It has a general store, bar and church. The community took its name from L.C. Malott, who first settled in the area in 1886. The town was established in 1890 and platted in 1909. Originally a stopover point with a hotel, most of the town was destroyed by flooding in 1938 after a dam burst on Loop Loop Creek. Malott was evacuated in July 2014 due to the approaching Carlton Complex wildfires.

The city of Okanogan lies to the northeast.

==Climate==
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Malott has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dsb&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="1039570" wikidata="Q1061429" url="?curid=1039570" title="Traveller's cheque">
<text>A traveller&#x27;s cheque is a medium of exchange that can be used in place of hard currency. They can be denominated in one of a number of major world currencies and are preprinted, fixed-amount cheques designed to allow the person signing it to make an unconditional payment to someone else as a result of having paid the issuer for that privilege.

They were generally used by people on holiday in foreign countries instead of cash, as many businesses used to accept traveller&#x27;s cheques as currency. The incentive for merchants and other parties to accept them lies in the fact that as long as the original signature (which the buyer is supposed to place on the cheque in ink as soon as they receive the cheque) and the signature made at the time the cheque is used are the same, the cheque&#x27;s issuer will unconditionally guarantee payment of the face amount even if the cheque was fraudulently issued, stolen, or lost. This means that a traveller&#x27;s cheque can never &#x27;bounce&#x27; unless the issuer goes bankrupt or out of business. If a traveller&#x27;s cheque were lost or stolen, it could be replaced by the issuing financial institution.

The financial institutions issuing traveller&#x27;s cheques earn income in a number of ways. Firstly, they charge a fee on sale of such cheques. In addition, they can earn interest for the period that the cheques are uncashed, while not paying any interest to the cheque holder, making them effectively interest-free loans. Also, the foreign exchange rate commonly used on traveller&#x27;s cheques (generally based on rates applicable at the time of purchase) is less favourable compared to other forms of obtaining foreign currency, especially those on credit card transactions (which use a rate applicable at the transaction date). In addition, the setup cost and the cost of issuing and processing traveller&#x27;s cheques is much higher than for credit card transactions. The cheque issuer carries the exchange rate risk, and normally pays a fee to hedge against the risk.

Their use has been in decline since the 1990s, when a variety of more convenient alternatives, such as credit cards, debit cards, money transfer services, pre-paid currency cards, and automated teller machines that accept foreign cards, became more widely available and easier for travellers to use. Also, as interest rates sharply declined in many developed countries in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, traveller&#x27;s cheques became much less profitable to issue and thus many issuers scaled back advertising and promoting their use while others stopped selling them altogether. Traveller&#x27;s cheques are no longer widely accepted and cannot easily be cashed, even at the banks that issued them. The alternatives to traveller&#x27;s cheques are generally cheaper and more flexible. Travel money cards, for instance, provide features similar to traveller&#x27;s cheques but offer greater ease and flexibility.

== Terminology ==
Legally, the parties to traveller&#x27;s cheque transactions are as follows. The organisation that produces a traveller&#x27;s cheque is the &quot;obligor&quot; or &quot;issuer&quot;. The bank or other place that sells it is the &quot;agent&quot; of the issuer. The natural person who buys the cheque is the &quot;purchaser&quot;. The entity to whom the purchaser hands the cheque in payment for goods or services is the &quot;payee&quot; or &quot;merchant&quot;. For purposes of clearance, the obligor is both &quot;maker&quot; and &quot;drawee&quot;.

== History ==

Traveller&#x27;s cheques were first issued on 1 January 1772 by the London Credit Exchange Company for use in 90 European cities, and in 1874, Thomas Cook was issuing &quot;circular notes&quot; that operated in the manner of traveller&#x27;s cheques.

American Express developed a large-scale international traveller&#x27;s cheque system in 1891, to supersede the traditional letters of credit. It is still the largest issuer of traveller&#x27;s cheques today by volume. American Express&#x27;s introduction of traveller&#x27;s cheques is traditionally attributed to employee Marcellus Flemming Berry, after company president J. C. Fargo had problems in smaller European cities obtaining funds with a letter of credit.

Between the 1850s and the 1990s, traveller&#x27;s cheques became one of the main ways that people took money on holiday for use in foreign countries without the risks associated with carrying large amounts of cash. They also had the advantage of being available in smaller denominations for travelers of more modest means, in an era when the well off tended to carry letters of credit. 

Several brands of traveller&#x27;s cheques have been marketed; the most familiar of those were Thomas Cook Group, Bank of America and American Express.

== Usage ==
=== Purchasing cheques for later use ===
Travellers&#x27; cheques are sold by banks and agencies to customers for use at a later time. Upon obtaining custody of a purchased supply of traveller&#x27;s cheques, the purchaser immediately signs each cheque. The purchaser also receives a receipt and other documentation that should be kept in a safe place other than where they carry the cheques. Traveller&#x27;s cheques can usually be replaced if lost or stolen, assuming the owner still has the receipt issued with the purchase of the cheques showing the serial numbers allocated.

=== Cashing cheques ===
To cash a traveller&#x27;s cheque to make a purchase, the purchaser would, in the presence of the payee, date and countersign the cheque in the indicated space.

=== Denomination and change ===
Traveller&#x27;s cheques are available in several currencies such as US dollars, Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan and euros; denominations usually being 20, 50, or 100 (× 100 for yen) of whatever currency, and are usually sold in pads of five or ten cheques, e.g., 5 × €20 for €100. Traveller&#x27;s cheques do not expire, so unused cheques can be kept by the purchaser to spend at any time in the future. The purchaser of a supply of traveller&#x27;s cheques effectively gives an interest-free loan to the issuer, which is why it is common for banks to sell them &quot;commission free&quot; to their customers. The commission, where it is charged, is usually 1–2% of the total face value sold.

Any change for a purchase transaction would be given in the local currency.

=== Deposit and settlement ===
A payee receiving a traveller&#x27;s cheque would follow its normal procedures for depositing cheques into its bank account: usually, endorsement by stamp or signature and listing the cheque and its amount on the deposit slip. The bank account will be credited with the amount of the cheque as with any other negotiable item submitted for clearance.

In the United States, if the payee is equipped to process cheques electronically at point of sale (&quot;see:&quot; Check 21 Act), they would still take custody of the cheque and submit it to a financial institution, particularly to avoid any confusion on the part of the purchaser.

== Security issues ==

One of the main advantages traveller&#x27;s cheques provide is the replacement if lost or stolen.

However, this feature has also created a black market where fraudsters buy traveller&#x27;s cheques, sell them at 50% of their value to other people (such as travellers) and falsely report their traveller&#x27;s cheque stolen with the company from which the cheque was obtained. As such, the fraudster gets back the value of the traveller&#x27;s cheque and also makes 50% of the value as profit.

Some purchasers have found the process of filing a claim for lost or stolen cheques is cumbersome, and have been left without recourse after their cheques were lost or stolen.

== Alternatives ==
In 2005, American Express released the &quot;American Express Travelers Cheque Card&quot;, a stored-value card that serves the same purposes as a traveller&#x27;s cheque, but can be used in stores like a credit card. It discontinued the card in October 2007. A number of other financial companies went on to issue stored-value or pre-paid debit cards containing several currencies that could be used like credit or debit cards at shops and at ATMs, mimicking the traveller&#x27;s cheque in electronic form. One of the major examples is the Visa TravelMoney card.

<doc id="1039574" wikidata="Q523363" url="?curid=1039574" title="Norwegian romantic nationalism">
<text>Norwegian romantic nationalism () was a movement in Norway between 1840 and 1867 in art, literature, and popular culture that emphasized the aesthetics of Norwegian nature and the uniqueness of the Norwegian national identity. A subject of much study and debate in Norway, it was characterized by nostalgia.
==Background==
The context and impact of Norwegian romantic nationalism derived from recent history and the political situation. Following the Black Plague, Norway became dependent on Denmark and Copenhagen was made capital of both countries in a personal union. Subsequently, there was a brain drain of talented people from Norway to Denmark, who studied in Copenhagen and became intellectuals and cultural icons in Denmark, most famously Ludvig Holberg. After more than 400 years as a dependent lesser part in the Denmark-Norway union treated as a cultural backwater by the absentee government in Copenhagen, the only uniquely Norwegian culture was found among the farmers and peasants in rural districts in Norway; Norway had in 1814 gained a partial independence in a personal union with the Kingdom of Sweden.

For Norwegians, having reasserted their political aspirations in 1814, the question of a distinct Norwegian identity became important. As urban culture gained prominence also in the rural districts, the rich cultural heritage of the Norwegian countryside came under threat. As a result, a number of individuals set out to collect the artifacts of the distinctly Norwegian culture, hoping thereby to preserve and promote a sense of Norwegian identity.

==Leading proponents==
The best-known such collectors in the 1840s and 1850s were:
* Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, who collected fairy tales and stories from most of the country;
* Magnus Brostrup Landstad and Olea Crøger, who collected folk songs particularly in upper Telemark;
* Ludvig Mathias Lindeman who collected folk tunes and laid the foundations for a separate Norwegian hymn tradition, distinct from the Danish and German psalms which until then had the greatest influence on Norwegian high music;
* Ivar Aasen, a linguist who conducted analyses of vocabulary, idioms, and grammar mostly from Western Norway and the mountainous valleys on the assumption that the original seeds of a Norwegian language were to be found there. He synthesized a grammar, vocabulary, and orthography for a separate Norwegian language that became the origin of Nynorsk. (See Norwegian language)

These achievements had an enduring impact on Norwegian culture and identity, an impact that can be witnessed in the influence on visual arts, classical music and literature, represented by e.g.:

* Painters Adolph Tidemand, Hans Gude, J.C. Dahl, August Cappelen;
* Writers Jørgen Moe, Peter Christen Asbjørnsen, Aasmund Olavsson Vinje, and also Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Henrik Ibsen in the beginning of their careers;
* Composers Ole Bull and Edvard Grieg.

==Later developments==
In the waning days of the national romantic movement, efforts were renewed to collect rural buildings, handcrafts and arts. Arthur Hazelius, the founder of Nordiska Museet in Stockholm gathered (and arguably rescued) large collections and sent them to Sweden.

The last king of union between Sweden and Norway, Oscar II, was a supporter of this new wave of collecting, starting one of the oldest outdoor museums, the origins of Norsk Folkemuseum. He supported the manager of the Royal domains at Bygdøy, Christian Holst in his efforts to gather old buildings from the rural districts. Among the buildings that are still at the museum, the Gol stave church, moved here in the beginning of the 1880s, is the most prominent. Soon after other pioneers started equal efforts to rescue important pieces of traditional Norwegian architecture and handicraft. Anders Sandvig started the museum Maihaugen at Lillehammer. Hulda Garborg started the collecting of traditional folk costumes (bunad) and dances.

This effort is still underway, but became more systematic as other cultural movements took the center stage in Norway in the late 19th and early 20th century.
Romantic nationalism has had an enormous impact on the Norwegian national identity. The Askeladden character from the fairy tales is considered being an integral part of the Norwegian way. On the Norwegian Constitution Day even in cities like Oslo and Bergen, a great proportion of people dress up in &quot;bunad&quot; for the parade, unthinkable 100 years ago.

<text>Barocius is an ancient lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon. It was named after Italian mathematician Francesco Barozzi. It lies just to the southeast of the large crater Maurolycus. To the southwest of Barocius is Clairaut, and to the south-southeast lies Breislak.

The rim of Barocius has been worn and eroded by countless subsequent impacts. Of these the most notable is Barocius B which lies across the northeast rim, and intrudes into Barocius C. There is a remnant of a crater, Barocius W, that lies just inside the southwest interior wall. On the interior floor is a low central peak offset to the north of the floor midpoint.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Barocius.

<doc id="1039594" wikidata="Q1400675" url="?curid=1039594" title="Ranseur">
<text>A ranseur, also called roncone, was a polearm similar to the partisan used in Europe up to the 15th century. It was still seen in court as a ceremonial weapon through the 17th century. 

Often thought to be a derivation of the earlier spetum, the head of a ranseur consists of a spear-tip affixed with a cross hilt at its base. Often this hilt is crescent-shaped, giving it an appearance similar to that of a trident. Generally, the hilts do not have a cutting edge, unlike the double-edged partisan. Ranseurs are generally in length or longer.

The spearing function of the weapon is apparent but not always effective against armor of great protection. The deflection includes the trapping of opponents&#x27; weapons in the space below the main blade, where a twist of the shaft can apply pressure from that moment on at long range, and of pulling mounted opponents from the saddle.

<doc id="1039597" wikidata="Q88884" url="?curid=1039597" title="Ernst Hinterberger">
<text>Ernst Hinterberger (17 October 1931 – 14 May 2012) was an Austrian writer of novels, particularly detective novels, plays and successful sitcoms. His first TV scripts were unusual for their use of genuine Vienna dialect.

==Life==
Ernst Hinterberger was born and died in Vienna. He was the son of an unemployed typesetter, who died when Ernst was seven. He completed training as an electrician, then from 1950 to 1952 he trained at the Vienna Police School to be a police officer, but had to leave a few weeks after beginning work because he suddenly needed glasses, which was not acceptable at the time. Following his time with the police, he first worked as a labourer. In 1958 he married and attended the City of Vienna&#x27;s Library School, following which he worked for ten years as a librarian in adult education centres. After these libraries were closed in 1968, he worked in shipping in a factory until his retirement in 1991. He was unwilling to rely on writing to provide his entire income. He has lung damage from the factory work.

Hinterberger discovered literature in the 1950s through the Bavarian author Oskar Maria Graf; he began writing when he was 24 or 25 years old.

Since approximately 1954, Hinterberger had lived in a 44 square metre city-owned flat on the Margaretengürtel in Vienna. His first wife, Margarete (&quot;Gerti&quot;) died in 2001 after 45 years of marriage, nine months before the 2002 publication of his book &quot;Ein Abschied. Lebenserinnerungen&quot; (&quot;A Farewell: Life Memories&quot;). In that book he said he was resigned and wanted nothing more to do with the world. Hinterberger had since remarried, to Karla.

Hinterberger was a practising Buddhist and had written poems in Chinese style, but they have never appeared in German. He was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering. His ashes are buried in Vienna Central Cemetery.

==Works==
===&quot;Ein echter Wiener geht nicht unter&quot;===
Hinterberger&#x27;s Edmund &quot;Mundl&quot; Sackbauer, (anti-)hero of the television series &quot;Ein echter Wiener geht nicht unter&quot;, came to typify the Viennese renter in the German-speaking world.

Sackbauer is a complainer who is actually a good man at the bottom of his heart, but is always giving in. In contrast, the original figure in Hinterberger&#x27;s mid-1960s book &quot;Das Salz der Erde&quot; on which he based the series is a pitiful man in the throes of midlife crisis, who notices while on holiday in Italy that his control over his family is dissolving. At the end of the book he leaves his wife, fails in his attempt to revive his self-confidence in a bordello, and is last seen uncertain whether in his outburst of emotion he has killed the prostitute or whether she is only injured.

In 2008 &quot;Echte Wiener – Die Sackbauer-Saga&quot;, a film based on the series, also written by Hinterberger, appeared.

<text>Burckhardt is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northeast part of the Moon. It lies between the craters Geminus just to the north and Cleomedes to the south.

Burckhardt lies across two slightly smaller craters on opposite sides, producing a triple-crater formation. Burckhardt E is overlaid by the southwest quadrant of Burckhardt, while Burckhardt F is overlaid by the northwest quadrant. The rim of Burckhardt is generally circular but somewhat irregular in form. There is a central rise near the midpoint of the crater floor.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Burckhardt.

<text>Delambre is a lunar impact crater that lies to the southwest of Mare Tranquillitatis, in the central highland region. To the west is the crater pair of Theon Junior and Theon Senior, the latter being more distant and located to the northwest.

It is 52 kilometers in diameter and 3.5 kilometers in depth. It was named for Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre, an 18th-century French astronomer.

The rim of Delambre has a d interior, with a tiny craterlet lying along the northern rim. In the south is a low cut forming a slight notch. The crater interior has an irregular surface. It has high walls, with some peaks reaching 15,000 feet. Delambre was photographed by the uncrewed probe Ranger 8 on its descent towards Mare Tranquillitatis. Delambre is from the Upper Imbrian epoch, which lasted from 3.8 to 3.2 billion years ago.

<doc id="1039609" wikidata="Q4774931" url="?curid=1039609" title="Antimatter weapon">
<text>An antimatter weapon is a theoretically possible device using antimatter as a power source, a propellant, or an explosive for a weapon. Antimatter weapons are currently too costly and unreliable to be viable in warfare, as producing antimatter is enormously expensive (estimated at US$6 billion for every 100 nanograms), the quantities of antimatter generated are very small, and current technology has great difficulty containing antimatter, which annihilates upon touching ordinary matter.

The paramount advantage of such a theoretical weapon is that antimatter and matter collisions result in the entire sum of their mass energy equivalent being released as energy, which is at least two orders of magnitude greater than the energy release of the most efficient fusion weapons (100% vs 0.4–1%). Annihilation requires and converts exactly equal masses of antimatter and matter by the collision which releases the entire mass-energy of both, which for 1 gram is ~9×1013 joules. Using the convention that 1 kiloton TNT equivalent = 4.184×1012 joules (or one trillion calories of energy), one half gram of antimatter reacting with one half gram of ordinary matter (one gram total) results in 21.5 kilotons-equivalent of energy (the same as the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945).

==Cost==
, the cost of producing one millionth of a gram of antimatter was estimated at . By way of comparison, the cost of the Manhattan Project (to produce the first atomic bomb) is estimated at US$23 billion in 2007 prices. As such, Hui Chen of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory dismissed concerns about antimatter bombs in 2008 as &quot;unrealistic&quot;.

==Antimatter-catalyzed weapons==
Antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion proposes the use of antimatter as a &quot;trigger&quot; to initiate small nuclear explosions; the explosions provide thrust to a spacecraft. The same technology could theoretically be used to make very small and possibly &quot;fission-free&quot; (very low nuclear fallout) weapons (see pure fusion weapon).

==In popular culture==
An antimatter weapon is a part of the plot of the Dan Brown book &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; and its film adaptation, where it is used in a plot to blow up the Vatican City.

The &quot;Ground Zero&quot; expansion pack of the video game &quot;Quake II&quot; requires the protagonist to manufacture an Antimatter Bomb in the Munitions Plant to achieve the final objective.

In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, Federation starships are armed with photon torpedoes which contain antimatter warheads.

<text>The 48th Fighter Wing (48 FW) is part of the United States Air Force&#x27;s Third Air Force, assigned to Headquarters Air Command Europe and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). It is based at RAF Lakenheath, England. The 48 FW is the only F-15 wing based in Europe which hosts two F-15E Strike Eagle squadrons. The wing also hosts two F-35A Lightning II squadrons. The 48 FW was given the name &quot;Statue of Liberty Wing&quot; on 4 July 1954 and remains the only U.S. Air Force unit with both a name and a numerical designation.

The 48 FW operates in support of United States Air Forces in Europe – Air Forces Africa, United States European Command and NATO.

==Units==
The Liberty Wing has nearly 5,700 active-duty military members, 2,000 British and U.S. civilians, and includes a geographically separated accommodation unit at nearby RAF Feltwell. In total they support two squadrons of F-15E Strike Eagle and two squadrons of F-35A Lightning II fighter aircraft.

* 48th Operations Group
: Formerly the 48th Fighter-Bomber Group. Provides four squadrons of F-35A &amp; F-15E aircraft &amp; personnel in support of USAFE, U.S. European Command and NATO operations.

** The 48th Civil Engineer Squadron maintains over 600 buildings, 1300 housing units, regional hospital, five DoD schools, and other infrastructure.
** 48th Force Support Squadron; responsible for dining, lodging, fitness, honor guard, leisure activities, family programs, and mortuary affairs.
** 48th Security Forces Squadron; protects &amp; defends USAF facilities, coordinates law enforcement operations with host nation police agencies, operates US Forces Correctional Facility, maintains combat arms training range, provides small arms training, etc 
** 48th Communications Squadron; provide &amp; maintain computer, data and voice communication, and United States Postal Service facility.

* 48th Medical Group (48 MDG)
: The 48 MDG provides healthcare services to over 35,000 eligible beneficiaries at six operating locations across the UK, and in Norway, covering personnel &amp; dependants from 48th Fighter Wing, 100th Air Refueling Wing, 501st Combat Support Wing, and 352nd Special Operations Wing. This includes 67,000 dental visits, 1550 surgeries, and 450 infant deliveries per year. The unit also maintains an Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) capability.

==History==
: &quot;For additional history and lineage, see 48th Operations Group&quot;


On 10 July 1952, the Oklahoma Air National Guard 137th Fighter-Bomber Wing at Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base, France was redesignated the 48th Fighter-Bomber Wing. The fighter squadrons being redesignated the 492d, 493d, and 494th respectively, the 58 F-84Gs and support aircraft of the ANG were assigned to the 48th Fighter-Bomber Group under the Hobson Plan. The 48th FBW commanded the functions of both the support groups as well as the flying combat 48th FBG. The few National Guardsmen still with the wing departed and the last were released from active duty on 9 July, although a few reserve officers remained on active duty for an additional six to twelve months.

With the F-84, the 48 FBW took part in North Atlantic Treaty Organization and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) activities, participating in exercises with the U.S. Seventh Army. In addition, the 48th conducted operational readiness exercises and tactical evaluations. Honing bombing and gunnery skills. The 48th frequently deployed to Wheelus Air Base, Libya for training.

The 48th Wing served the longest in France, from 10 July 1952 through 15 January 1960. The men and women of the 48th worked hard to develop Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base into one of the best air bases in Europe. Its squadrons remained unchanged while flying three different type of fighters, the F-84G, F-86F and the F-100D, and maintaining the capability to fight either a conventional or nuclear war if need be.

An open house was held once a year, with great numbers of French civilians in attendance. In 1954, over 15,000 attended the Armed Forces Day event to see static aircraft displays, watch flight demonstrations, listen to a French army band and other activities. In just over three years since construction began, Chaumont Air Base became an important part of the Haute-Marne region.

To bolster Franco-American relations, the 48th Wing Staff came up with the idea of changing the wing insignia. Chaumont AB is located not far from the workshops of Frédéric Bartholdi – the French architect who designed the Statue of Liberty. The new design incorporated the Statue of Liberty, and throughout Europe the 48th became known as the &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot; Wing. On 4 July 1954 the mayor of the town of Chaumont bestowed the honorary title of the Statue de la Liberté (Statue of Liberty) Wing upon the 48th. It is the only USAF unit with both an official name and a numerical designation.

Not long after the wing proudly took on the title of The Statue of Liberty Wing, the wing&#x27;s comptroller discovered the factory that had produced the actual Statue of Liberty was only 25 miles from Chaumont. In fact, one of the actual molds still existed. The factory agreed to cast a three-meter replica of the statue for $1,700. The wing raised the funds by raffling off a 1956 French Ford Versailles sedan. The statue still stands in Chaumont as a memorial to the service of the 48th Fighter-Bomber Wing in France, with a replica located at RAF Lakenheath.

In November 1953, the wing exchanged its F-84Cs for newer North American F-86 Sabre (F models), receiving 75 aircraft, 25 per squadron. Then word came in late 1956 that the Air Force would exchange the wing&#x27;s Sabres for a newer aircraft: the North American F-100 Super Sabre. The larger-bodied F-100 was capable of carrying more ordnance than the F-86 and was one of the first fighters designed to operate at supersonic speeds. 90 single-seat F-100D aircraft were received, along with 13 F-100F dual-seaters.

The wing began realigning its units 15 March 1957, as part of an Air Force worldwide reorganization. The 48th Fighter-Bomber Group was inactivated on 8 December 1957 when its component squadrons were assigned directly to the 48th FBW.

As part of yet another organization change, the 48th dropped the &quot;Fighter Bomber&quot; designation 8 July 1958, becoming the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing. The three flying units also changed designation, becoming tactical fighter squadrons.

Despite the close relationship between the wing and the people of Chaumont, international relationships between France and the US deteriorated in the late 1950s, resulting in French President Charles de Gaulle demanding the removal of NATO forces from the country. Under a project known as &quot;Red Richard&quot;, USAFE relocated its units from France to other locations around Europe. Simultaneously, the advent of the inter-continental ballistic missile had reduced the United States&#x27; dependence on European-based airborne medium-and long ranged bombers.

On 15 January 1960, the 48 TFW redeployed to an empty Strategic Air Command heavy bomber base, RAF Lakenheath, England. In the early the wing&#x27;s three fighter squadrons lifted off Chaumont&#x27;s runway and, after making farewell passes over the outlying village, headed toward the English Channel.

===RAF Lakenheath===

On 15 January 1960, the F-100s of the 48TFW arrived at RAF Lakenheath. The tactical components of the 48th TFW upon arrival at Lakenheath were 492d, 493d and 494th Fighter Squadrons.

The F-100s arrived from France still finished in bare metal with bright individual squadron markings, subsequently changed to a common tri-colour chevron (blue, yellow, red) flash on the tail (and nose), over bare metal. Around 1966-67 this was replaced with dull green-based S.E. Asia camouflage and no squadron markings. However by 1970 individual squadron markings were re-introduced, firstly with large squadron tail-codes (&#x27;LR&#x27;, &#x27;LS&#x27; or &#x27;LT&#x27;) and shortly after colored fin tips were added.

*492d Tactical Fighter Squadron (assigned tailcode &#x27;LR&#x27;, blue fin tip added later)
*493d Tactical Fighter Squadron (assigned tailcode &#x27;LS&#x27;, yellow fin tip added later)
*494th Tactical Fighter Squadron (assigned tailcode &#x27;LT&#x27;, red fin tip added later)

The wing and its fighters brought a new mission and the first permanent American presence to RAF Lakenheath. The base required a myriad of construction projects to support the mission. Maintenance and flying operations areas required conversions to support fighter operations, and the base needed the creation of a support structure for a permanent host unit.

East Germany&#x27;s 1961 decision to build the Berlin Wall and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis increased Cold War tensions to an all-time high. In response, RAF Lakenheath was earmarked as a possible rotational base for SAC B-47 and B-52 aircraft throughout the Berlin Crisis, although no aircraft were actually deployed. Also in 1962, the 48th TFW came under the operational command of Third Air Force.

Between 1963 and 1972 the wing&#x27;s F-100 fleet maintained its readiness by participating in a number of USAFE and NATO exercises training to react to possible aggression from the Soviet Union. They underwent a series of NATO tactical evaluations, for which they earned the wing their first Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, for the period from 1 July 1961 to 29 February 1964. The wing conducted several deployments to Turkey, Italy, Spain, and across the United Kingdom

On 1 October 1971, the 492d Tactical Fighter Squadron stood down from its NATO commitments, followed by the 493d on 1 December and the 494th on 1 February 1972. The period between 1972 and 1977 can be described as a five-year aircraft conversion. Beginning in late 1971 the 48th TFW started its conversion to the McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II, with some aircraft being transferred from the 81st TFW at RAF Bentwaters. The conversion to the F-4D took several years, with the last F-100 departing in August 1974. The first F-4 Phantoms to arrive adopted a common tail code of &quot;LK&quot; with a tri-color fin tip, however this tail code lasted only a few months as in July / August 1972 the 48th TFW further recoded to &quot;LN&quot;. As the numbers of F-4s increased, they were allocated to individual squadrons and gradually adopted individual squadron identifying fin cap colors of blue, yellow and red (492d, 493d, 494th respectively). The squadron conversion dates were:

* 492d TFS 1 October 1971 and 31 January 1972
* 493d TFS 1 December 1971 and April 1972
* 494th TFS 1 February 1972 and 25 July 1974

The F-4&#x27;s service with the 48th TFW was relatively short as operation &quot;Ready Switch&quot; transferred the F-4D assets to the 474th TFW at Nellis AFB Nevada. The 474th sent their General Dynamics F-111A Aardvarks to the 366th TFW at Mountain Home AFB Idaho, and the 366th sent their F-111Fs to Lakenheath in early 1977. Unlike the previous F-4 transition, the F-111 change took place fairly quickly and without any significant problems. In fact, the wing received its third Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for such a smooth transition. Almost immediately after changing aircraft, the wing began a series of monthly exercises and deployments that took the Liberty Wing to Italy, Iran, Greece, and Pakistan.

A fourth fighter squadron, the 495th Tactical Fighter Squadron was activated with the 48th TFW on 1 April 1977 with a squadron tail color of green. This was 33 years to the day since the squadron&#x27;s inactivation. The 495th&#x27;s mission of functioning as a replacement training unit for the other three fighter squadrons made the 48th TFW unique in two ways. First, it created the 48th the only combat wing in USAFE with four squadrons. Furthermore, it made the 48th the only wing operating with its own replacement training unit. In the same year construction of the airfield&#x27;s Hardened Aircraft Shelters (acronym: HAS, but commonly referred to as a TAB-VEE) began as part of a wider NATO effort.

By September 1979, the wing had flown the highest number of hours ever recorded in a fiscal year by an F-111 unit. This dedication culminated in the 48th&#x27;s performance during a joint USAFE Operational Readiness Inspection and NATO Tactical Evaluation in March 1980. As a result, the Secretary of the Air Force selected the 48th TFW for its fourth Air Force Outstanding Unit Award.

In the early 1980s the wing struggled with aircraft shortages. Primarily, this resulted from the upgrade to the Pave Tack, a laser guided weapons delivery system. Each aircraft had to process through the upgrade facility at the Air Logistics Center in McClellan AFB, California. At the same time, the wing had to overcome supply shortages resulting from years of reduced military budgets in the late 1970s under the Carter administration.

===Operation El Dorado Canyon===
By the mid-1980s the Cold War was not the only American fear for national security; terrorists struck targets from bombing of US Marines in Beirut to Berlin, from Rome to Rotterdam. Some of these attacks were attributed to the Libyan government headed by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. In retaliation, U.S. President Ronald Reagan ordered a strike against targets in Tripoli, which were carried out by the United States Navy Sixth Fleet and F-111s of the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing. The F-111Fs from Lakenheath were chosen for their capability to fly long distances and deliver laser-guided munitions with great accuracy.

At about 19:00 the evening of 14 April 1986, 24 F-111Fs departed Lakenheath&#x27;s runway, six of which were airborne spares in the event malfunctions forced any of the primary aircraft to abort. In flights of four, aircrews flew south through the Straits of Gibraltar and began their orchestrated attack shortly after midnight on 15 April. They were targeted on Azziziyah Barracks, the Sidi Balal terrorist training camp, and Tripoli Airport. With the sky lit up from Tripoli&#x27;s city lights, anti-aircraft tracers, and brilliant surface-to-air missile detonations, determined 48th TFW crews unleashed 60 tons of munitions, damaging their targets. In spite of the mission&#x27;s success, the Wing experienced a major loss. As the strike force recovered at Lakenheath, both air and ground crews were given the somber news that Major Fernando Ribas (Utuado, Puerto Rico) pilot, and Weapons System Operator Captain Paul Lorence, were missing.

The grueling 14-hour flight took its toll. &quot;Those guys were so fatigued, the crew chiefs literally had to pull some of the crews out of the cockpits&quot;, recalled CMSgt Richard O’Shaughnessy, then a Master Sergeant and weapons flight supervisor. &quot;Most of them actually lost several pounds from sweating so much. When the guys pulled their helmets off, sweat literally poured down their foreheads and necks&quot;.

On 8 September 1986, US Navy Secretary John Lehman personally presented the Navy&#x27;s Meritorious Unit Commendation to the 48th TFW for its participation in the operation. The 48th TFW is the only Air Force unit to have received this prestigious award. Likewise, General Charles L. Donnelly, Jr., Commander-in-Chief, USAFE, visited RAF Lakenheath on 17 February 1987 and presented decorations to those who participated in the operation. The ceremony ended with a presentation to Captain Lorence&#x27;s widow Diane, followed by a missing man flyover.

===To the Middle East, 1990–91===
In response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, during the first week of August, Col Thomas J. Lennon, 48th Tactical Fighter Wing Commander, received a call from Headquarters, US States Air Force, asking if the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing was ready to deploy. Colonel Lennon built a team of 13 members from wing leadership, known as the &quot;Lucky 13&quot;, and preparations began for the eventual movement of personnel and F-111s to Saudi Arabia.

On 25 August 1990, 18 F-111s took off from Lakenheath as the first USAFE unit to deploy. In this first group, nearly 500 men and women of the Liberty Wing departed. The 48th TFW deployed more than 60 aircraft and 1,500 personnel to Taif Air Base, Saudi Arabia. The 492d, 493d and 494th TFSs deployed, supplying 66 F-111Fs, which were in place by December 1990. Some aircrew &amp; other members of the 495th TFS were deployed &amp; dispersed throughout its 3 sister squadrons.

During the Operation Desert Storm air war 17 January-24 February 1991, and subsequent four-day ground war of 24–28 February the wing&#x27;s F-111Fs flew thousands of sorties, unleashing precision-guided and unguided munitions on Iraqi armor, artillery, bridges, military airfields and command and control centers. The wing&#x27;s crews even stopped the flow of oil contaminating the Persian Gulf by bombing a pumping installation purposefully damaged by retreating Iraqi forces.

Overall, the 48th TFW flew a total of 1919 combat sorties, totaling 2203 target hits. The Wing returned to RAF Lakenheath 13 May 1991.

===Post Cold War era===

Incorporating the lessons learned during the desert operations, the Air Force directed changes that led to the Objective Wing Organization. Beginning in mid-1991, the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing began restructuring under this program, realigning its maintenance-fighter squadron workforce and establishing several command positions to include the 48th Logistics Group, 48th Medical Group, 48th Support Group, and 48th Operations Group (originally designated the 48th Fighter Group).

The program also redesignated many of the Air Force&#x27;s units by dropping the &quot;Tactical&quot; from their names. Thus on 1 October 1991, the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing was redesignated the 48th Fighter Wing, and the 492d, 493d, 494th and 495th became simply Fighter Squadrons. The 495th FS inactivated on 13 December 1991.

In the midst of the organizational changes, the wing switched aircraft again, exchanging the F-111Fs for the F-15E Strike Eagle. On 21 February 1992, the first F-15E landed at Lakenheath, with the last F-111F departing for units within the US on 16 December 1992. The final F-15E arrived in June 1993 (actually early 2000s), and the wing achieved initial operational capability on 1 October 1993. With this mission change, the 493d Fighter Squadron inactivated on 1 January 1993, only to reactivate again on 1 January 1994. The squadron received its first maintenance trainer F-15C Eagle on 10 January 1994, then its full complement of F-15C &amp; D aircraft by 22 July 1994. This marked the first time that the 48th had flown a specifically air-to-air weapon system, after flying for more than 50 years with an air-to-ground mission.

Since September 2001, in response to the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, various units of the 48th FW have deployed to Afghanistan to support Operation Enduring Freedom and to Iraq to support Operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn, and also to various other US allies such as South Korea.

The wing participated in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya in March 2011. One of the wing&#x27;s F-15E aircraft crashed in Libya after an unapproved flight maneuver on 21 March 2011, but both crew members survived with minor injuries.

An F-15C Eagle from the 48th Fighter Wing crashed into the North Sea on 15 June 2020, killing the pilot on-board. 

On 1 October 2021, the 495th Fighter Squadron was reactivated as the 48th Fighter Wing&#x27;s first F-35A unit.
In 2021, the 48th Fighter Wing became the first unit outside of the contiguous United States to operate the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II, with two squadrons based at RAF Lakenheath.

<text>The San Diegan was one of the named passenger trains of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and a “workhorse” of the railroad. Its 126-mile (203-kilometer) route ran from Los Angeles, California, south to San Diego. It was assigned train Nos. 70–79 (Nos. 80–83 were added in 1952 when RDCs began operating on the line).

The Los Angeles-San Diego corridor was to the Santa Fe what the New York City–Philadelphia corridor was to the Pennsylvania Railroad. Daily traffic could reach a density of ten trains (each way) during the summer months. From the Los Angeles/Orange County border to San Diego, it ran along the Surf Line (officially, the Fourth District of the Los Angeles Division), which was so named because much of its trackage came within fewer than 100 feet of the Pacific Ocean.

The first &quot;San Diegan&quot; ran on March 27, 1938, as one set of equipment making two round trips a day. A second trainset delivered in 1941 made possible four streamlined trains each way. A set of heavyweight equipment made a fifth trip in each direction. During and after World War II, furlough business from San Diego&#x27;s military bases necessitated extra (albeit heavyweight) sections of &quot;San Diegans&quot;, and racetrack specials during horseracing season at Del Mar added to passenger train miles.

Amtrak continued to operate the &quot;San Diegan&quot; when it took over operation of the nation&#x27;s passenger service on May 1, 1971. After extending the route to the Central Coast in the 1980s and 1990s, Amtrak rebranded the route as the &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; on June 1, 2000.

==History==

===Background===

Construction of the Surf Line between Los Angeles and San Diego began on October 12, 1880, with the organization of the California Southern Railroad Company. On January 2, 1882, the California Southern commenced passenger and freight service between National City and Fallbrook Junction, just north of Oceanside. The Santa Fe assumed control of the California Southern and on August 12, 1888, completed the line between Los Angeles and San Diego. Initially known as the &quot;Short Line&quot;, the route replaced the Santa Fe&#x27;s existing circuitous route via Temecula Canyon. In the 1930s the Surf Line hosted four round-trips per day, with an average trip time of hours.

===&quot;San Diegan&quot;===

In the late 1930s streamlined trains were in transition. While fixed consists such as the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s M-10000 were out (the last, the Illinois Central 121, had been built in 1936), railroads still ordered sets of equipment with the intention that those sets stay with a particular train. In 1937–1938, the Santa Fe embarked on a massive program to upgrade its passenger fleet: it introduced new sets on the &quot;Chief&quot;, &quot;Super Chief&quot; and &quot;El Capitan&quot;, and added three new trains — the &quot;Chicagoan&quot;, &quot;Kansas Cityan&quot;, and the &quot;San Diegan&quot;.

On March 27, 1938, the Santa Fe inaugurated the &quot;San Diegan&quot;, operating on a schedule of hours. The single equipment set could make two round-trips per day. A second &quot;San Diegan&quot; consist entered service on June 8, 1941, doubling the schedule to four daily round trips. The &quot;San Diegan&quot; was supplemented by two conventional heavyweight trains.

* December 31, 1940: Engine No. 1676, a 2-10-2 type locomotive in charge of Train 135, the &quot;Night Coast,&quot; is bound for Los Angeles with a 40-car freight when it derails just after 9:00 p.m. and goes over a bluff south of Del Mar, with 8 freight cars following suit. Nine additional cars were derailed but did not fall. Three members of the engine crew were killed in the accident, and many days passed before all of the wreckage could be retrieved; only one car actually ended up on the beach near the water. It was determined that water seepage had undermined the trackbed where the incident took place, causing the rails to spread.
* June 8, 1941: A second lightweight train consisting of six coaches, a baggage-mail car, a tavern lunch-counter car, and a round-end observation car is added to the line. Service is increased to four daily round trips with streamliners and one round trip using conventional equipment.
* October 27, 1941: A fifth, steam-powered train is added to the schedule, due in part to the need to transport military personnel to and from San Diego&#x27;s bases. This semi-streamlined train carries a full buffet car, a diner, and three coaches that had all previously run as the &quot;Valley Flyer&quot; between Oakland and Bakersfield. The number of daily trains servicing the route increases to 16, on average.
* 1942: The average number of trains per day increases to 42. Consist size expands to 13 cars, and each logs 512 daily miles. Trains consisting of 10-12 former Southern Pacific interurban trailer cars, owned by the U.S. Maritime Commission but bearing ATSF markings, are fitted with conventional knuckle couplers at each end of the trainset and pressed into service to handle the additional passenger loads.
* April 1943: The schedule is lengthened to three hours due to ever-increasing military movements.
* May 10, 1943: Santa Fe adds a second mainline track along the San Diego line between La Mirada and Fullerton to accommodate increased wartime traffic. Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) is installed on the line.
* May 21, 1952: The Santa Fe places two Budd Rail Diesel Cars, DC191 and DC192, into service. The two cars, coupled together, make two daily round trips. One of these is a non-stop express service timed at 2 hours 15 minutes.
* August 25, 1953: Santa Fe 3751 pulls the last steam-powered trains (Nos. 72 and 73) on the &quot;Surf Line.&quot;
* January 10, 1954: The use of round-end observation cars is discontinued in order to eliminate the need to &quot;turn&quot; the trains in San Diego before heading northward.
* January 22, 1956: Redondo Junction train wreck. Bound for San Diego, the two RDCs (making up train No. 82) derail at 69 mph in an evening high-speed accident at Redondo Junction, California, just south of the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal (LAUPT), killing 30 and seriously injuring 117. This accident ended the units&#x27; run on the &quot;Surf Line.&quot; The radio reports of the accident were one of the first major uses of the Sigalert (known at the time as a &quot;Sigmon Traffic Alert&quot;).
* March 1956: General Motors&#x27; &quot;Aerotrain&quot; makes a series of experimental runs as a &quot;San Diegan&quot; consist. Thoughts of placing it in permanent service are quickly abandoned as the entire train set has to be turned at each end of the line, and requires helper locomotives on the Sorrento Grade.
* April 28, 1956: Heavyweight local trains Nos. 70 and 75 are discontinued due to losses.
* Summer 1956: Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;El Capitan&quot; makes three demonstration runs to San Diego to promote its new &quot;Hi-Level&quot; cars. The railroad begins placing illuminated drumheads (formerly mounted on round-end observation cars) on the vestibule gate of the trailing cars of the &quot;San Diegan&quot;. Service on the line is reduced to six daily round trips.
* Summer 1958: Service is further reduced to five daily round trips and weekend extra trains.
* November 19, 1958: An F4D Skyray fighter jet overshoots the runway at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro and is struck by southbound train No. 74 at -per-hour. All three locomotive units and cars #3430, #3165, #3144, #1399, #3100, #3094, #3082 derail. No fatalities and only a few injuries result.
* January 14, 1959: Locomotive #20C, leading train No. 75 through a blinding fog, collides with a heavy truck at a grade crossing in Irvine; the unit sustains considerable damage and is &quot;set out&quot; to be picked up for repairs. Multiple automotive mishaps also result from the heavy fog in the immediate vicinity.
* December 4, 1959: A few minutes before 12:30 a.m., freight train 136, the eastbound &quot;Night Coast,&quot; is on the mainline heading for San Diego when the westbound &quot;SBX&quot; (San Bernardino Extra) leaves the San Juan Capistrano siding without dispatcher permission. Engine Nos. 259 and 269 (both of the EMD F7 type) are damaged in the resulting collision, with several cars derailed. 
* July 31, 1964: Mail trains Nos. 70 and 81 are dropped as all mail between Los Angeles and San Diego is now transported via truck (Santa Fe&#x27;s mail contract expired on July 1 and was not renewed).
* 1965: Service is further reduced to three daily round trips (train Nos. 73–78) on a two‑hour‑and‑55‑minute schedule.
* December 22, 1965: a San Diego-bound &quot;San Diegan&quot; collides with a fully loaded gravel truck at the State College Boulevard grade crossing in Anaheim. The long nose of the lead Alco PA unit is credited with saving the lives of the engine crew, but is so badly damaged that it has to be written off and scrapped. Including locomotive units 61L and 51C, cars #3084, #3156, #3152, #3179, and #3076 all derail.
* February 11, 1967: In heavy fog, a San Diego-bound &quot;San Diegan&quot; slams into an Orange County rubbish truck at the Fruit Street crossing on its approach to the Santa Ana Depot. There is no derailment but 8 passengers were injured from flying glass.

===Amtrak===

Amtrak assumed control of most intercity passenger trains in the United States on May 1, 1971. It retained two of the &quot;San Diegan&#x27;s&quot; three round-trips. Between November 1971–April 1972 the long-distance &quot;Coast Daylight&quot;/&quot;Coast Starlight&quot; operated along the entire length of the Pacific Coast from Seattle to San Diego. The &quot;Daylight/Starlight&quot; was cut back to Los Angeles in April, and Amtrak restored the third &quot;San Diegan&quot; round trip to maintain the same level of service along the corridor Beginning in 1976 the state of California funded additional service: a fourth round-trip on September 1, 1976, a fifth on April 24, 1977, a sixth on February 14, 1978, and a seventh on October 26, 1980. Between April 29, 1984, and April 28, 1985, Amtrak experimented with an express service between Los Angeles and San Diego. This was targeted at business customers and made fewer stops than the regular &quot;San Diegan&quot; trains. Dubbed &quot;Metroliner&quot; after the high-speed service on the Northeast Corridor, it was unpopular and suffered from low ridership. After its discontinuance Amtrak restored the seventh &quot;San Diegan&quot; and introduced Custom class on the route.

* June 26, 1988: One round trip per day is extended north to Santa Barbara.
* 1995: One round trip extends as far north as San Luis Obispo.
* July 1996: The IC3 Flexliner is put into two-week trial service during the height of the Del Mar horse racing season.
* November 1998: An eleventh daily round trip is added.
* June 1, 2000: The train is renamed the &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot;, with eleven round trips from San Diego to Los Angeles. Five continue to Santa Barbara, and two continue to San Luis Obispo.

==Equipment used==

The original &quot;San Diegan&quot; consist included a baggage car, two coaches (60 seats each), a lunch counter-tavern car, and a parlor-observation car. Motive power consisted of a single EMC E1A locomotive sporting the familiar &quot;Warbonnet&quot; paint scheme. These units would, in time, be replaced by ALCO PA and PB power and EMD F3 and F7 locomotives. Santa Fe&#x27;s lone trio of Fairbanks-Morse (FM) &quot;Erie-built&quot; locomotives and the odd GE U28CG could also be seen occasionally running the line.

A lone pair of 90-seat self-powered Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDCs) were acquired for express service. They operated &quot;back-to-back&quot; as a single train unit from May 21, 1952, until the Redondo Junction derailment on January 22, 1956.

Three additional coach units were added for weekend traffic. The &quot;San Diegan&quot; also enjoyed almost exclusive use of Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;pendulum-suspension&quot; chair car, No. 1100, after World War II.

In June 1941, the railroad added a second eight-car trainset, also built by Budd, to handle the high demand. Its original consist was similar to the above save for an additional coach. Subsequent consists varied according to traffic levels.

A representative, all-lightweight consist from the Summer of 1955:

* Baggage-Mail car
* RPO-Baggage car
* &quot;Chair&quot; car / Coach (52 seats)
* &quot;Chair&quot; car / Coach (52 seats)
* &quot;Chair&quot; car / Coach (52 seats)
* &quot;Chair&quot; car / Coach (52 seats)
* Bar-Lounge-&quot;Chair&quot; car (#1398-#1399 assigned)
* &quot;Chair&quot; car / Coach (52 seats)
* &quot;Chair&quot; car / Coach (52 seats)
* &quot;Chair&quot; car / Coach (52 seats)
* &quot;Chair&quot; car / Coach (52 seats)

Under Amtrak ex-Santa Fe Hi-Level coaches were used in the early 1970s. Modern Amfleet coaches arrived in 1976. For a six-month period in 1978 service on the route was supplemented by the &quot;El Camino&quot; cars owned by Los Angeles County.

<doc id="1039620" wikidata="Q420190" url="?curid=1039620" title="Conchiolin">
<text>Conchiolins (sometimes referred to as conchins) are complex proteins which are secreted by a mollusc&#x27;s outer epithelium (the mantle). 

These proteins are part of a matrix of organic macromolecules, mainly proteins and polysaccharides, that assembled together form the microenvironment where crystals nucleate and grow. This organic matrix also holds and binds to the crystals of aragonite which give such shells their stiffness. 

The ions necessary to form calcium carbonate are also secreted by the mantle, but it is the tailored environment created by the organic matrix which causes aragonite (rather than calcite) crystals to nucleate, in much the same way that collagen nucleates hydroxyapatite crystals. 

Conchiolin serves as a relatively flexible, crack-deflecting matrix for the mineral aggregate particles; its strength and the strong bonding of perlucin can in some cases (such as in the formation of nacre) give the finished material an impressive level of toughness.

As well as providing a matrix into which the hard calcium carbonate part of the shell is precipitated, many species of mollusks (such as the land snail shown above) also have an outer shell layer called the periostracum which is composed of the protein conchiolin. Some land snails (especially the taxa that have become adapted to living on acidic soils) have very thin, transparent, tan-colored shells, even as adults, and those shells are composed entirely of conchiolin.

<text>Encke is a lunar impact crater that is located on the western edge of the Mare Insularum, to the south-southeast of the crater Kepler. The small crater Kunowsky lies to the east-southeast on the mare.

The crater is named after German mathematician and astronomer Johann Franz Encke.

The rim of Encke is low and somewhat polygonal in shape. The tiny craterlet Encke N lies across the western rim. The floor is somewhat uneven, and is covered in ray material from the nearby Kepler. The high albedo of this ejecta makes Encke a bright feature when the Sun is at a high elevation over the lunar surface.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Encke.

<doc id="1039628" wikidata="Q287723" url="?curid=1039628" title="Chevrolet Malibu">
<text>The Chevrolet Malibu is a mid-size car that was manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet from 1964 to 1983 and from 1997 to 2025. The Malibu began as a trim-level of the Chevrolet Chevelle, becoming its own model line in 1978. Originally a rear-wheel drive intermediate, GM revived the Malibu nameplate as a front-wheel-drive car in 1997.

Named after the coastal community of Malibu, California, the Malibu is marketed primarily in North America, with the eighth generation introduced globally. The Malibu is the last sedan sold by Chevrolet in the U.S.

Malibu production in the US ended in November 2024, as the Fairfax plant is being retooled for the upcoming second generation Chevrolet Bolt.


== First generation (Chevelle Malibu, 1964) ==

The first Malibu was a top-line subseries of the mid-sized Chevrolet Chevelle from 1964 to 1972. Malibus were generally available in a full range of bodystyles including a four-door sedan, two-door Sport Coupe hardtop, convertible and two-seat station wagon. Interiors were more lavish than lesser Chevelle 300 and 300 Deluxe models thanks to patterned cloth and vinyl upholstery (all-vinyl in convertibles and station wagons), deep-twist carpeting, deluxe steering wheel and other items. The Malibu SS performance package was available only as a two-door Sport Coupe hardtop or convertible and added bucket seats, center console (with optional four-speed manual or Powerglide transmissions), engine gauges and special wheelcovers, and offered with any six-cylinder or V8 engine offered in other Chevelles - with the top option being a in 1964.

For 1965, Malibus and other Chevelles received new grilles and revised tail sections and had the exhaust pipes replaced but carried over the same basic styling and bodystyles from 1964. The Malibu and Malibu SS models continued as before with the SS featuring a blacked-out grille and special wheelcovers. Top engine option was now a V8. 201 of the 1965 Malibu SS cars got Regular Production Option (RPO) Z16, which include a heavily modified chassis and Chevy&#x27;s new 375 horsepower 396 cubic inch V8. All were hardtops, although rumors persist that one convertible was built.

The Malibu SS was replaced in 1966 by a new Chevelle SS-396 series that included a big-block V8 engine (Canadian market did not receive the SS396 but marketed the former Malibu SS nameplate until January 1967 when it was phased out), heavy duty suspension and other performance equipment. Other SS-396 equipment was similar to Malibu Sport Coupes and convertibles including an all-vinyl bench seat. Bucket seats and console with floor shift were now optional on the SS and for 1966 with the SS now denoting a car with a big-block engine, the bucket seats became a new option on the regular Malibu Sport Coupe and convertible, upon which any six-cylinder or small-block V8 could be ordered. Also new for 1966 was the Chevelle Malibu four-door Sport Sedan hardtop. Styling revisions on all 1966 Chevelles including more rounded styling similar to the full-sized Chevrolets with sail panels and tunneled rear windows featured on two-door hardtop coupes.

For 1967, the same assortment of bodystyles were continued with styling changes similar to all other Chevelles including a new grille and revised tail section with taillights that wrapped around to the side. New this year was a Chevelle Malibu Concours station wagon with simulated woodgrain exterior side panel trim. Front disc brakes were a new option along with a stereo 8-track tape player. The same assortment of drivetrains carried over from 1966 with the top V8 dropped from .
== Second generation (Chevelle Malibu, 1968) ==


Malibus and all other Chevelles were completely restyled for 1968 with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtops and wheelbases split to } on two-door models and 116 for four-door sedans and station wagons. Engine offerings included a new V8 rated at that replaced the V8 that had served as the base V8 since the Chevelle&#x27;s introduction in 1964. Inside was a new instrument panel featuring round gauges in square pods similar to what would appear in Camaros the following year. New for 1968 was the Concours luxury option for Malibu sedans and coupes that included upgraded cloth or vinyl bench seats, carpeted lower door panels, woodgrain trim on dash and door panels, a center console and floor shifter (only with the hardtop and convertible, which was shared with the SS396) and Concours nameplates. There was again a top-line Concours Estate wagon with simulated woodgrain trim that had the same interior and exterior appointments as the Malibu sedans.

New grilles and rear decks with revised taillights highlighted the 1969 Malibus and other Chevelles. Instrument panels were revised and front seat headrests were standard equipment due to federal safety mandate. The ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the steering column and also doubled as a steering wheel lock. The 307 continued as the base V8, but the 327 engines were replaced by new V8s of . GM&#x27;s three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, previously only offered on SS-396 Chevelles (RPO M40), was now available on all models with all engines (THM400s were used with the 396 while the THM350 (RPO M38) first introduced with the Camaro and Nova) was phased in with the small blocks optioned, including the six-cylinder and small-block V8s which in previous years were only available with the two-speed Powerglide. A police package Chevelle 300 (pillared 4 door sedan) was available for the 1969 model year which came with the L35 code 396 - it was built in few numbers when the Chrysler Corporation held the market for its law enforcement orders. Some 1964 and 1965 Chevelle 300s came with the BO7 police package but was powered with the inline six.

For 1970, the Malibu was initially the only series of Chevelle offered, aside from the SS-396 and new SS-454, as the low-line 300 and 300 Deluxe models were discontinued for the American market (it continued in Canada until 1972), which also eliminated the two-door pillared coupes from the Chevelle lineup – which were never included in the Malibu series. New grilles, rear decks with taillights moved into the bumper and revised Sport Coupe roofline highlighted this year&#x27;s changes. The standard six-cylinder engine was punched up from to and , while the same assortment of V8s carried over with the addition of a , V8 on non-SS Chevelles. At mid-year, the Malibu was rejoined by lower-line Chevelle models that were simply called the base Chevelle in both four-door sedans and two-door hardtops.

In 1971, Malibus and all other Chevelles got a new grille surrounded by single headlamps replacing the duals of previous years, and four round taillights similar to Camaros and Corvettes were located in the bumper. All engines were detuned to use lower-octane unleaded gasoline this year per GM corporate policy as a first step toward the catalytic converter-equipped cars planned for 1975 and later models which would require unleaded fuel.

Only new grilles highlighted the 1972 Malibu and other Chevelles. All bodystyles were carried over from 1971, but 1972 would be the final year for hardtops and convertibles as the redesigned Chevelles originally planned for this year, but delayed until 1973, would feature Colonnade styling with side pillars and frameless door windows. The 1972 Chevelle was also ordered with the police package which used RPO 9C1 (which became the default SEO (service option) code for subsequent Chevrolet PPV packages).
== Third generation (Chevelle Malibu, 1973) ==

The Chevelle was redesigned for the 1973 model year. Models included the base Deluxe, mid-range Malibu &amp; Malibu SS and the top-line Laguna.

For 1974, the Deluxe was dropped, and the Malibu became the entry-level Chevelle. The Laguna trim package was replaced with the Malibu Classic which used a stacked arrangement of four rectangular headlights and made its way to the dealers in the 1976 model year, offering the Chevrolet built inline six 250 CID as the base engine. The Laguna S-3 model was introduced to replace the SS, and continued through 1976.

==Fourth generation (1978) ==

For the 1978 model year, the Malibu name, which had been the bestselling badge in the lineup, replaced the Chevelle name. This was Chevrolet&#x27;s second downsized nameplate, following the lead of the 1977 Chevrolet Caprice and Impala. The new, more efficient platform was over a foot shorter and had shed compared to previous versions, yet offered increased trunk space, leg room, and head room. Only two trim levels were offered - Malibu and Malibu Classic. The Malibu Classic Landau series had a two-tone paint job on the upper and lower body sections, and a vinyl top. This generation introduced the Chevrolet 90° V6 family of engines, with the 200 CID (3.3 L) V6 as the base engine for the all new 1978 Chevrolet Malibu, along with the 229 CID (3.8 L) V6 and the 305 CID (5.0 L) Chevy built V8 as options. The 200 and 229 engines were essentially a small block V-8, with one pair of cylinders removed. The front and rear bellhousing face were the same as the small V8. The 231 engine was a Buick product, and featured a front distributor.

Three bodystyles were produced (station wagon, sedan, and coupe), and the design was also used as the basis for the El Camino pickup truck with its own chassis. The sedan initially had a conservative six-window notchback roofline. This was in contrast to the unusual fastback rooflines adopted by Oldsmobile and Buick divisions which would later revert to a more formal pillar style. To increase rear seat hip room (and encourage more orders for the high-profit air conditioner), the windows in the rear doors of four-door sedans were fixed, while the wagons had small moveable vents. With the rear window regulators no longer required, Chevrolet was able to recess the door arm rests into the door cavity, resulting in a few extra inches of rear seat room. Customers complained about the lack of rear seat ventilation. No doubt this design contributed to the number of factory air conditioning units sold with the cars, to the benefit of General Motors and Chevrolet dealers. For the 1981 model year, sedans adopted a four-window profile and &quot;formal&quot; pillared upright roofline. The two-door coupe was last produced in this year, as the Monte Carlo assumed the market position held by the 2-door coupe. For 1982 the Malibu was facelifted with more squared-off front styling marked by quad headlights with long, thin turn signals beneath them. The look was reminiscent of the also recently facelifted Chevrolet Caprice. For 1983, Malibus gained a block-style &quot;Malibu&quot; badge on the front fenders to replace the cursive-style script located on the rear quarter panels of previous model years.

The four-door Malibu was commonly used in fleet service, especially for law enforcement. After the Chevrolet Nova ceased production in 1979, the mid-sized 9C1 police version (not to be confused with the full-size Chevrolet Impala 9C1 which was also available) was transferred to the Malibu, filling a void for the mid-sized police patrol cars. A 9C1-equipped Malibu with an LT-1 Z-28 Camaro engine driven by E. Pierce Marshall placed 13th of 47 in the 1979 Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, better known as the Cannonball Run.

There was no factory Malibu SS option available on this generation. The SS only came in the El Camino.
The rare, and striking, 1980 Malibu M80 was a dealer package for only North and South Carolina. It was mostly aimed at NASCAR fans who regularly traveled to Darlington Raceway. To this day, the number actually produced is unknown; estimates place this around 1,901 cars. All M80s had to be white with dark blue bucket seats and center console interior. The base of the M80 was a two-door sport coupe equipped with the F41 Sport Suspension package and the normal V8 (140 hp) drive train. The M80 option added two dark blue skunk stripes on top and a lower door stripe with the M80 identification. The package also added front and rear spoilers and 1981 steel rally wheels (sourced from the 1980 Monte Carlo).

In Mexico, General Motors produced this generation in the Ramos Arizpe plant, which was sold during three years (1979 to 1981). Mexican versions came in three trim levels (Chevelle, Malibu and Malibu Classic) and two body styles (sedan and coupe) with the I6 as basic engine and the V8 as the optional; this engine was standard on Malibu Classic models during those three years. This was possible because the Mexican emissions regulations remained relatively free at the time.

===Iraqi taxi===
In 1981, General Motors of Canada (GMCL) produced a special order of 25,500 four-door Malibu sedans at their Oshawa plant for Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraqi government. The deal was reportedly worth $100 million to GMCL. These special-order Malibus carried the unusual combination of GM&#x27;s lowest-power carbureted V6 engine, the unit and a three-speed manual transmission with floor shifter; air conditioning, heavy duty cooling system, AM/FM cassette deck, front bench seat, 200 km/h speedometer, tough tweed and vinyl upholstery, and 14-inch body-color steel wheels with small hubcaps.

Only 13,000 of these cars made it to Iraq, with the majority becoming taxis in Baghdad. The Iraqi government suddenly cancelled the order in 1982. The proffered excuse for the cancellation was dissatisfaction with the cars&#x27; quality, notably difficult shifting of the transmission—which GM traced to a clutch release issue that eventually required on-site retrofitting by a crew of Canadian technicians sent to Iraq. Later speculation was that the Iraqis backed out for financial reasons, due to their escalating hostilities with Iran requiring the immediate diversion of funds to support the Iraqi war effort. GMCL President Donald Hackworth was initially quoted as stating the company would try to sell the Malibus in other Middle East markets, but in the end the orphaned cars were all sold to the Canadian public at the greatly reduced price of about CA$6,800. Over the years, they have acquired a low-key celebrity status, sometimes being colloquially referred to as &quot;Iraqibu&quot;.

===NASCAR===
The Malibu was an extensively used body style in NASCAR competition from 1973 to 1983. The Laguna S-3 variant, in particular, was successful during the 1975 through 1977 racing seasons, with Cale Yarborough winning 20 races in those years as well as winning the NASCAR championship one year. Because it was considered a limited edition model, NASCAR declared it ineligible for competition following the 1977 season, even though (given NASCAR&#x27;s three-year eligibility rule) it should have been allowed to run through 1979. Beginning in 1981, the downsized Malibu body style was eligible to run, but given its boxy shape only one driver, Dave Marcis, ran it in 1981 and 1982, with one victory in a rain-shortened Richmond 400 at Richmond in 1982, the independent driver&#x27;s last win.

Production Figures:
===G platform===
Beginning in 1982, the Malibu shared GM&#x27;s redesignated rear-wheel-drive G platform with cars like the Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Buick Regal. The Malibu Classic was last marketed in 1982; Malibus were produced as four-door sedans and as station wagons until 1983, at which time it was fully replaced by the front-wheel-drive Chevrolet Celebrity. Although the sedan and wagon were phased out, the El Camino utility, which shared styling with the Malibu, remained in production until 1987.

== Fifth generation (1997) ==
A new front-wheel drive Malibu was introduced for the 1997 model year on an extended wheelbase version of the GM N platform shared with the Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile Achieva, and Pontiac Grand Am, as a competitor to the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry which were the best sellers in the mid-size market. All N-body Malibus were produced at the Wilmington and Oklahoma City Assembly plants through 1999 and 2002 respectively; thereafter, production was moved to Lansing, Michigan. The Oldsmobile Cutlass was a rebadged, slightly more upscale version of the Malibu, produced through 1999. It was intended as a placeholder model to fill the gap left by the discontinuation of the aging Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera before the all-new Alero arrived in 1999. The Malibu itself replaced the compact Chevrolet Corsica. Power came from a 2.4-liter, inline-four or a 3.1-liter, V6. The Malibu was &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1997; this was later criticized by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; in 2009, citing that the Malibu was insufficiently distinguishable in terms of performance or interior quality to warrant such praise in hindsight. Standard features included four-wheel ABS brakes, hydraulic engine mounts and air conditioning.

The 1997 to 1999 Malibus had a front grille with the Malibu logo in silver in the center; 2000 to 2003 models, and the Classic, had the blue Chevrolet emblem on the front grille. The 1997 to 2003 LS models were sometimes equipped with special gold-colored badges (the rear Malibu lettering and logo).

When a new Malibu was introduced on the Epsilon platform for 2004, the N-body Malibu was renamed Chevrolet Classic and remained in production for the 2004 and 2005 model years, being restricted to rental car companies and fleet orders with production ending in April 2005.

The 3.1 L V6 was updated partway through the 1999 model year with a new power rating of ; the 2.4 L 4-cylinder was dropped after 2000. However, a four-cylinder was reintroduced in 2004 when the 2.2 L Ecotec was offered on the Classic. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fuel mileage estimates for the 2.2 L Ecotec engine are -.

===Malibu Cruiser===
The February 2002 issue of &quot;HCI: Hot Compact &amp; Imports&quot; magazine featured the Chevrolet Malibu Cruiser concept that GM Performance Division built for the SEMA show in 2001. The car was painted in &quot;Sublime Lime&quot; by BASF and featured a highly modified turbocharged 3500 SFI 60-degree V6 (producing at 5,000 rpm and of torque at 2,900 rpm), a 4T65-E four-speed transmission with overdrive, a set of 19x8-inch wheels by Evo wrapped in Toyo Proxes T1-S high-performance tires. Numerous interior modifications included a full-length custom center console, four black leather Sparco racing seats, and a Kenwood entertainment center (with radio, CD, DVD, TV, 10-disc changer and numerous amps and speakers). Exterior modifications included custom HID headlamps (both low and high beams), &quot;Altezza&quot; style taillights, and a custom bodykit.

Chevrolet produced the Cruiser as a concept only, never making it available for purchase. The intent was to attract younger buyers to the stock model and to demonstrate the viability of aftermarket modifications.
==Sixth generation (2004)==
The Malibu name was moved to GM&#x27;s new Epsilon platform based on the 2002 Opel Vectra C for 2004. The Epsilon-based Malibu came in two bodystyles, a standard 4-door sedan and a 5-door Malibu Maxx station wagon. The Malibu Maxx has a fixed glass roof panel over the rear seats with a retractable sunshade, and an optional glass panel sunroof over the front seats and was similar in execution to the Opel Signum, a large station wagon derived from the Vectra C.

Base power for the sedan came from a 2.2 L Ecotec L61 I4 producing 144 hp (108 kW). &quot;LS&quot; and &quot;LT&quot; trim sedans and Maxx models originally came with a 3.5 L 201 hp (149 kW) High Value LX9 V6. The SS sedan and Maxx models were powered by the 3.9 L High Value LZ9 V6. For 2007, the LX9 was replaced with the LZ4 V6, which in the Malibu produced 217 hp (162 kW). This was the only engine available to private buyers in the 2008 Malibu Classic. The L61 Ecotec was also updated for the 2007 model year with many improvements. A remote starter was also available, which was introduced on several other GM vehicles for 2004.
The sixth generation of the Malibu initially debuted with a front fascia design featuring a wide grille split horizontally by a prominent chrome bar that ran the entire width of the car, shared ultimately cross-brand. For 2006, the chrome bar was removed, and the grille itself was made smaller. As with all cars across GM, the car also carried GM badges near the front doors.

The Malibu Maxx was discontinued after the 2007 model year, the Malibu sedan remained in production for the 2008 model year, known as the Malibu Classic. The cars themselves bear Malibu badges, unlike the past generation Classic. Three models were available: the V6-engined LT and LS, and a four-cylinder LS version. Only the V6-engined LT was available to private buyers, with the LS versions only built for fleet sales.

===Engines===
===SS===

A special &quot;SS&quot; trim was available on the Malibu and Malibu Maxx with the 3.9 L &quot;LZ9&quot; V6 from 2006 to 2007, developing and and channeled through a 4T65-E four-speed automatic with Tap-Up/Tap-Down shifting, sport suspension with tower-to-tower brace, 18&quot; alloy wheels, universal home remote transmitter, rear spoiler and hydraulic power steering. Changes to differentiate the SS from the lower trims include three-spoke, leather wrapped steering wheel with SS badge, sport cloth and leather seats, side skirts, chrome tip exhausts, and more aggressive front and rear clips.

== Seventh generation (2008) ==

The Malibu was extensively redesigned and reengineered for the 2008 model year, with styling by Bryan Nesbitt. GM Vice Chairman Robert Lutz was determined to make the nameplate competitive with Japanese mid-size cars.

Trim levels were base (2008 only), LS, LT, Hybrid (2008 and 2009 only), and LTZ. The LTZ trim had clear brake light lenses with red LEDs, the balance of trim packages retaining red lenses with conventional brake lights.

The seventh generation Malibu uses a variant of the long-wheelbase Epsilon platform shared with the Saturn Aura, the Opel Signum, and Pontiac G6. It is assembled in Kansas City, Kansas. Overall, it is three inches (76 mm) longer, with a six inches (152 mm) longer wheelbase. Interior room remains mid-size, like the previous Malibus, and has been decreased from to , despite having a longer wheelbase, although front legroom has increased from to . Rear legroom has decreased from to . The interior design was revised, with a selection of two-tone color combinations (brick and tan two-tone), telescoping steering wheel, higher-quality materials and a twin-cowl dash design. Drag (Cd) is at 0.33 for the LTZ.

===Powertrain===
The seventh generation Malibu offered these engine choices:

The 2.4 L I4 and 3.6 L V6 engine have aluminum blocks and heads, dual overhead cams, four valves per cylinder, twin balance shafts, and variable valve timing. The 3.5 L V6 has aluminum heads, an iron block, overhead valves, and limited variable valve timing. The 3.5 L V6 was offered as an upgrade for special-order fleet vehicles, to replace the Ecotec engine, and generally was not available for retail customers; it was also not available in the LTZ. Partway through the 2008 model year, the 2.4 L Ecotec was offered with a six-speed automatic transmission to improve performance and fuel economy.

For 2009 models, the six-speed transmission mated to the 2.4 L 4-cylinder engine or the 217 horsepower 3.5 L V6 mated to the four-speed automatic were made available on the 1LT; the six-speed became standard on 2LT models the same year. The LS models were equipped with the four-speed transmission only. A manual transmission was not offered. All models are front-wheel-drive sedans. Chevrolet dropped the Malibu MAXX station wagon model.

Partway through the 2010 model year, the GM badges were removed from the front doors.

OnStar was included on all Malibu models as standard equipment (excluding fleet vehicles, where this feature is optional). Six air bags were also standard on the seventh generation Malibu; two dual-stage front bags, two side-impact curtain air bags protecting the heads of both front and rear passengers, and two side-impact thorax bags mounted in the front seats. Traction control, electronic tire pressure monitoring system, four-wheel disc brakes, antilock brakes, and daytime running lamps were standard included safety features on all Malibus. GM&#x27;s StabiliTrak brand electronic stability control was standard on all models including the very base LS model.

In 2011, the base LS 1LS Malibu gained more standard features, like Bluetooth technology with stereo audio playback capability, a remote USB and iPod/iPhone port, remote start, a security alarm, an upgraded OnStar system, power front driver&#x27;s seat, chrome hubcap wheel covers, body-colored side mirrors with power adjustments and body-colored accents, a single wood dashboard accent, tinted windows, and a six-speed automatic transmission with overdrive and manual shift capabilities. The LT 1LT model lost its available eight-speaker Bose premium sound system. The LT 2LT got a package that included a sunroof, leather power heated seats, and more convenience and comfort features.
For 2011, the four-speed automatic transmission was dropped from the Malibu powertrain lineup. This same model year also saw the deletion of the steering wheel mounted paddle shifters on 6AT cars in favor of a selector mounted rocker switch for manual operation; no reason was ever given for the change.

;Hybrid version
A BAS mild hybrid, with the base inline-4 like the Saturn Aura Green Line, was available offering an increased fuel economy of /, which for the 2009 model was increased to /. The Malibu hybrid was dropped for the 2010 model year for regular consumers but was still available to fleets.

===Reception===
The 2008 Malibu received critical praise from the automotive press, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; referring to it as being &quot;like a super Accord, but from GM&quot; and &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine declaring, &quot;Camry, Beware.&quot; It also garnered high praise from &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine, being rated higher than the Honda Accord and Nissan Altima in the magazine&#x27;s 2008 Car of The Year competition. Kelley Blue Book named it the &quot;2008 best redesigned vehicle&quot;. Car and Driver stated that while it would not be &quot;enough to steal the top-dog sales title from the perennial Honda and Toyota mid-sizers&quot;, they noted &quot;for the first time since Chevrolet revived the storied nameplate in 1997, it has enough of what it needs to sell in significant numbers to the public, not just rental fleets&quot;.
Edmunds.com praised the Malibu&#x27;s interior and exterior styling, quietness, and balance between ride and handling, while criticizing the thick C-pillars that obstruct the driver&#x27;s view, the narrower chassis compared to other midsize cars (which reduces rear seating room and also lacks a center armrest) and lack of features such as dual-zone HVAC, Bluetooth compatibility, and keyless ignition.

While Robert Cumberford, design critic at &quot;Automobile&quot; magazine noted the interior of the platform-variant, the Saturn Aura featured cheap interior materials, he noted improved in the Malibu. Writers of various reviews for the 2008 Malibu believed Chevrolet would be getting back on track in quality and excitement in the mid-size segment after a history of ordinary, bland offerings, such as the Celebrity, Corsica, Lumina, and even the previous two generations of Malibu since its 1997 revival.

In January 2008, the redesigned Malibu received the North American Car of the Year award at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in voting among a panel of 50 automotive journalists in a field of entries, with the runners up being the 2008 Cadillac CTS and the 2008 Honda Accord. The Malibu&#x27;s win marked the second straight year a car built on GM&#x27;s Epsilon platform won the North American COTY award with the 2007 North American COTY award having gone to the 2007 Saturn Aura.

Initial sales results were positive, with the Malibu joining the Cadillac CTS and Buick Enclave on a list of GM vehicles whose sales have exceeded expectations. The redesigned Malibu sold more than 50% more units in 2008 than in 2007, increasing GM&#x27;s mid-size market share to 8.4% from 5.7%, while the Camry and Accord percentages remained flat at about 21% and 17.5%, according to GM. Sales to rental customers dropped to 27% of the total, as GM limited sales to rental fleets.

The short-lived Malibu Hybrid, along with its sister, the Saturn Aura Green Line, which share the powertrain and other major components, was particularly criticized due to its lack of fuel savings and cost (relative to a standard 4-cylinder Malibu), plus the Hybrid&#x27;s worsened driving dynamics.

===Recall===
On September 21, 2012. General Motors recalled 473,841 vehicles involving the Chevrolet Malibu, Pontiac G6 and Saturn Aura from model years 2007 through 2010 equipped with four-speed automatic transmissions. The problem is a condition that could make cars roll when in park. The recall affected 426,240 in the United States, 40,029 in Canada and 7,572 in other markets.

== Eighth generation (2013) ==

The 2013 Malibu moved to GM Epsilon II platform and debuted in Asia in late 2011, followed by North America in 2012. The new Malibu became a global vehicle, replacing both the North American Malibu and GM Korea vehicles previously sold around the world. The Malibu was unveiled as a show car simultaneously at Auto Shanghai in China (written as &quot;迈锐宝&quot;, Mai-Rui-Bao ), and on Facebook, on April 18, 2011. It was also shown at the New York International Auto Show in New York City later in April.

The eighth generation Malibu was available in the trim levels LS 1LS (not available for fleet-ordered models), the LT 1LT (this is the base model for fleet-ordered models), the LT 2LT, the ECO 1SB, the ECO 2SA, and the LTZ 1LZ. Both ECO models officially went on sale in the spring of 2012, with the gas-only models following in late summer 2012. The Turbo models followed in early 2013.

All models, aside from the LS 1LS, were equipped with a large touch-screen display using Chevrolet&#x27;s MyLink and offering Pandora Internet Radio playback capabilities via a USB cable and an iPhone 4, 4S, or 5. SiriusXM Travel Link was also included on all navigation-equipped Malibu models.

===Markets===

The eighth generation Malibu was sold in &quot;nearly 100 countries on six continents&quot;. In the United States, it is manufactured in two plants, Fairfax, KS and Detroit-Hamtramck. In Australia and New Zealand, the South Korean-made Malibu replaced the Holden Epica, and made its debut in 2013 as the Holden Malibu. It was positioned between the Holden Cruze and Holden Commodore. In South Korea, the Malibu replaces the Daewoo Tosca, as GM has phased-out the Daewoo brand in favor of Chevrolet. Korea was the first market to get the Malibu, in late 2011, followed by China later in 2011 and North America beginning in early 2012. The Malibu made its Middle Eastern debut in 2012 replacing the Holden VE Commodore based Lumina. In Europe, the Malibu replaced the Chevrolet Epica. The facelifted Malibu was never sold in Europe. In the Philippines, the Malibu was introduced in late 2013 for the 2014 model year, where it replaced the Chevrolet Lumina, marking Chevrolet&#x27;s return to the executive sedan segment since the Lumina was discontinued in the mid-2000s. The car was sold there until 2017, and was assembled in South Korea.

In North America, the eighth generation Malibu continued to be sold in 2016 as the Malibu Limited as the next generation went on sale. It was mostly identical to the 2015 model, but only featured the 2013 I4 engine variant (LCV instead of LKW) with auto stop-start.

In China, the eighth generation Malibu remained in production alongside the ninth generation Malibu until 2019. It received a facelift in 2016. A 1.5-liter turbo engine was added for the 2017 model year.

===Powertrains===

The eighth generation Malibu was offered mostly with four-cylinder engines and six-speed automatic transmissions. The North American version was offered exclusively with four-cylinder engines, with a 2.5L serving as the base engine, a 2.4L mild hybrid, and a 2.0L turbocharged engine being offered. The European version was offered with a 2.4 L Ecotec engine with an aluminum block and cylinder head, and a 2.0 L Diesel (1,956 cc) VCDi developing 160 PS (120 kW). The version offered in the Middle East had either the 2.4 L Ecotec engine or a 3.0 L V6 engine making 260 PS and 290 Nm. Two Holden-badged versions were offered in the Australian market, the CD and the CDX, with the 2.4 L Ecotec or 2.0 L diesel.

====Engines====
===Safety===
Standard safety features on the eighth generation Malibu include dual-stage front airbags for the driver and front passenger, along with pelvic/thorax side-impact and knee airbags up front also. Roof rail airbags with rollover protection are standard. Also available as option extras are second-row head/thorax side-impact airbags, lane departure warning system with forward collision alert and a rearview camera system.

The US-made Malibu in its most basic Latin American market configuration with 10 airbags received 4 stars for adult occupants and 1 star for toddlers from Latin NCAP in 2013.
===Reception===
In a March 2012 comparison test by Car and Driver, the “light electrification&quot; Chevrolet Malibu Eco hybrid came in sixth place out of six cars. The Eco is not a Malibu LS, LT, or LTZ. The Malibu Eco was criticized for its reduced wheelbase, causing a 0.8&quot; reduction in legroom for back seat passengers. The interior was also criticized for being disappointing and cramped. The ride, however, was said to be smooth and quiet, with the only problem being the stiff steering.

The 2014 Chevrolet Malibu received the highest score in its class from J.D. Power&#x27;s 2014 Initial Quality Study. The IQS study &quot;examines problems experienced by vehicle owners during the first 90 days of ownership.&quot;

===Updates===
Eighteen months after the 2013 Malibu&#x27;s debut, it received a mild refresh. The changes included additional technology, improved fuel economy, and front-end styling that more closely matched the refreshed Chevrolet Traverse and the newly redesigned Chevrolet Impala. Minor changes were made to the center console to deliver a longer armrest said to be more comfortable and a pair of cup holders and mobile-phone bins instead of the previous covered storage area. The Chinese model received a refreshed front end with revised headlamps.

Among the technology that Chevrolet debuted on the 2014 Malibu was a new six-speed transmission. Because the transmission was designed to reduce the energy required to pump transmission fluid, it contributed to fuel savings on the refreshed Malibu. In addition, for the first time in a non-hybrid GM vehicle, an engine stop/start system came standard with the 2.5 L engine. EPA fuel-economy estimates showed an improvement to 25/36 mpg city/highway, up from the 2013 model&#x27;s 22/34 for the base 2.5 L engine. The 2014 Malibu went on sale in late 2013.

There was no change in the South Korean market until 2016.


== Ninth generation (2016) ==
On April 1, 2015, Chevrolet unveiled a redesigned Malibu at the 2015 New York International Auto Show, which went on sale in late 2015 as a 2016 model. The updated Malibu featured a sleeker, yet larger design similar to its full sized Impala. The wheelbase was increased almost four inches, creating more interior space; but the fuel efficiency is improved, as it is nearly 300 pounds lighter than the eighth generation model. The 2016 Malibu was offered in four trims: L, LS, LT, and Premier (replacing the LTZ trim).

The Malibu features an all-new, LFV Ecotec 1.5 L turbocharged engine that is standard, while a 2.0 L turbocharged engine is offered as an optional feature. No six-cylinder engine is available. Other new features on the ninth-generation Malibu that were introduced for the 2016 model year include available OnStar 4G LTE in-vehicle connectivity, as well as available wireless phone charging, preventive safety technologies including ten standard air bags featuring forward collision avoidance system rear cross traffic alerts, and an optional automatic parking assist. It features Forward Collision Alert with Following Distance Indicator, Adaptive Cruise Control with Front Automatic Braking, and Front Pedestrian Alert with last-second automatic braking. It is also installed with start-stop ignition once the engine is at operating temperature and the brake is applied while the vehicle is stopped.

The 2016 Malibu features a first for the automotive industry, a teen driver feature, which allows parents to view their kids&#x27; driving statistics, such as maximum speed, warning alerts and more. To operate the vehicle a parent enables the feature with a PIN in the settings menu of the Malibu&#x27;s MyLink system, which allows them to register their teen&#x27;s key fob. The system&#x27;s settings are turned on only to registered key fobs. This technology also mutes the radio until the seat belts are buckled. The 2016 Malibu comes equipped with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto Capability features. However, only one of their phone brands at any one time can be used.
A few months ahead of the 2016 model arriving in dealerships, Chevrolet announced that the Malibu had hit a milestone, with more than 10 million sold worldwide since the car was introduced 51 years earlier. Outside of North America, the Malibu was also sold in China and South Korea. The pre-facelift model was also introduced in the Philippines in early 2018 and sold there until its discontinuation in 2021; the facelift version never appeared in the Philippines.

For the 2017 model year, the LT trim was no longer available with the up-level 2.0-liter EcoTec turbocharged four-cylinder engine and nine-speed automatic transmission. 2017 Malibu buyers were required to choose the range-topping Premier trim in order to opt for this drivetrain.

===Hybrid===
The ninth generation Malibu offers a full hybrid model for the first time, featuring a 1.8 L four-cylinder engine mated to a two-motor drive unit and electronically controlled, continuously variable automatic transaxle, providing additional power to assist the engine during acceleration for 182 horsepower of total system power. An Exhaust Gas Heat Recovery system allows the engine and cabin to warm up during winter conditions, while an 80-cell, 1.5 kWh lithium-ion battery pack provides electric power to the hybrid system, powering the Malibu Hybrid up to on electricity alone, while the gasoline-powered engine automatically comes on at higher speeds and loads to provide additional power. The Malibu Hybrid uses a transmission (&quot;two motor drive unit&quot; in GM terms) similar to the second generation Chevrolet Volt, but a much smaller battery, no plug-in option and a different engine.

Due to the discontinuation of the Chevrolet Volt and declining sales, the Malibu Hybrid was discontinued after 2019 leaving Chevrolet without hybrid vehicles in their North American lineup up until the introduction of the Corvette E-Ray.
=== Engines ===
===2019 mid-cycle refresh===
Chevrolet updated the Malibu in 2018 for the 2019 model year. A new larger front grille, split by a chrome bar with the Chevrolet bow-tie, dominates the front, while the rear change is less significant. The Premier trim adds LED headlamps while the L/LS/RS/LT/Hybrid trims maintain halogen headlamps. A new RS trim-line is added for a sportier appearance, with a black grille, unique 18-inch wheels, and dual exhaust. The touchscreen is replaced with the 8-inch Chevrolet Infotainment 3 in the L/LS/RS/LT trims and Chevrolet Infotainment 3 Plus with HD screen in the Hybrid and Premier trims. Heated Second Row Seats are added to the Premier trim. The standard 1.5 L engine is now paired with a CVT instead of the 6-speed automatic transmission. Safety features were also improved for the 2019 Malibu including Low Speed Forward Automatic Braking, IntelliBeam high-beam assist headlamps and a semi-automated parking system. For 2019, the LT trim&#x27;s Leather Package loses the Bose premium audio system, requiring buyers to upgrade to the range-topping Premier trim in order to opt for the Bose system.
For the 2020 model year, the base L trim level received standard sixteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels from the LS trim, replacing the previous sixteen-inch steel wheels with plastic covers. All trim levels received the eight-inch Chevrolet Infotainment 3 systems as standard equipment, and the previous seven-inch touchscreen unit was discontinued.

For the 2022 model year, the low-volume L trim was discontinued (as well as on all other Chevrolet vehicles that previously offered the L trim level), demoting the LS trim to base model status. The mechanical parking brake was also discontinued, replaced by an electronically operated parking brake on all models.

For the 2023 model year, the Premier trim was replaced by 2LT, and the LT was no longer fitted with standard leather seats. All engine options aside from the turbocharged 1.5 were also discontinued.

Chevrolet ended production of the Malibu in November 2024 without a replacement for the North American market. The Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas City, where the Malibu is built for the North American market, is being retooled to build the Ultium-based second generation Bolt while production of the Cadillac XT4 was planned to end in January 2025.

<text>The Holden Barina is a subcompact automobile sold between 1985 and 2018 by Holden in Oceania. Each of the six generations have been badge-engineered versions of various General Motors vehicles, namely Suzuki Cultus, Opel Corsa, and Daewoo Kalos. Barina is an Australian aboriginal word meaning &quot;summit&quot;.

== First generation (MB, ML; 1985–1988) ==

The first generation MB Barina was launched on 12 February 1985 as a badge-engineered Suzuki Cultus as a five-door hatchback. In the first year of production a &quot;Roadrunner Pack&quot; special model was offered complete with decals showing the Warner Bros. cartoon character. A high-profile marketing campaign featured the slogan &quot;Beep beep Barina&quot;, a catchphrase that remains in the consciousness of many Australians in the present. The facelifted ML series was released in September 1986, this included a coil sprung rear end replacing the leaf springs of the MB, a revised dashboard, headlights, tailgate and lights, and front grille.

In the Used Car Safety Ratings undertaken by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, published in 2008, found that the first generation Barina provides a &quot;significantly worse than average&quot; level of occupant safety protection in the event of an accident.

In New Zealand, the Barina (also sold as the &quot;Suzuki Swift&quot;) was assembled by GMNZ from 1985 until 1989. At least for the ML series, a three-door version was also offered in NZ. From 1986 to 1989, a Holden Barina GTi model was also sold, being a rebadged Suzuki Swift GTi (see Suzuki Cultus). This vehicle used the G13B engine. General Motors sold this car in other markets as well. In the United States, it was badged as the Chevrolet Sprint.
== Second generation (MF, MH; 1989–1994) ==

The second-generation MF Barina was a rebadged second generation Suzuki Cultus, co-developed with GM using the GM M platform and marketed worldwide under nearly a dozen nameplates, prominently as the Suzuki Swift, Pontiac Firefly (Canada) and Geo Metro (Chevrolet&#x27;s sub-model in the USA). A five-door hatchback was first released in January 1989, and was followed by the introduction of a three-door &quot;GS&quot; hatchback in September 1990.

An ordering mix-up meant that (right hand drive) NZ versions – now imported assembled from Japan – received the North American Geo tail lamp cluster with red flashing direction indicators rather than the Suzuki style cluster with amber flasher sent to Australia. Luckily for GM NZ, NZ law still allowed amber or red so the red lenses remained for the entire MH series run. The equivalent Suzuki had the amber lenses.

The MH Barina, which was released in September 1991, featured an improved interior, upgraded suspension, new front and rear bumpers and revised tail-lamp clusters.

Like the previous generation, the second generation Barina provides a &quot;worse than average&quot; level of safety according to the 2008 Used Car Safety Ratings.
== Third generation (SB; 1994–2000) ==
The third generation SB Barina was based on the Opel Corsa B and imported from Spain. It was released in April 1994 and was offered as a three- or five-door hatchback. Engine choices were a 1.2 and 1.4-litre four-cylinder engine. A 1.6-litre engine was also offered for the sporty range topping GSi. The third generation Barina was available in the following models:

;Pre-facelift
* 1.2-litre &quot;C12NZ&quot; – City 3-door (1994–1997)
* 1.4-litre &quot;C14NZ&quot; – City 3-door (1996–1997)
* 1.4-litre &quot;C14NZ&quot; – Joy 3-door (1994–1995)
* 1.4-litre &quot;C14NZ&quot; – Swing 5-door (1994–1997)
* 1.4-litre &quot;C14NZ&quot; – Grand Prix 5-door (1996–1997) – special edition
* 1.6-litre &quot;C16XE&quot; – GSi 3-door (1994–1995)
* 1.6-litre &quot;X16XE&quot; – GSi 3-door (early 1995–1997)

;Post-facelift
* 1.4-litre &quot;C14SE&quot; – City 3-door (1997–2000)
* 1.4-litre &quot;C14SE&quot; – Olympic City 3-door (1999–2000) – special edition
* 1.4-litre &quot;C14SE&quot; – Swing 5-door (1997–2000)
* 1.4-litre &quot;C14SE&quot; – Olympic Swing 5-door (1999–2000) – special edition
* 1.4-litre &quot;C14SE&quot; – Lambada 5-door (1997) – special edition
* 1.4-litre &quot;C14SE&quot; – Cabrio 3-door (1997–2000)
* 1.6-litre &quot;X16SE&quot; – GSi 3-door (1997–1999)

In August 1997, there was an update featuring multipoint fuel injection across the range and suspension upgrades to improve ride and handling. These models can be identified by their half body coloured bumpers, three-bar grille, and updated trim and badging.

During 1997, Holden released the special edition Lambada. Limited to 500 cars, the Lambada 3-door hatchback added a sunroof, 14 inch alloys, body coloured bumpers, and power steering over the City it was based on. Holden offered the choice of Casablanca White, Atlantis Blue, and Mint Green.

From November 1997 until late 2000, Holden sold the Barina Cabrio soft top convertible. Only 581 were sold. Based on the Barina City three-door hatchback, the soft top version was built in Spain like the rest of the SB series lineup. However, once imported into Australia, Holden organised for the conversion into cabriolets at Clayton, Victoria through its performance vehicle partner, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV). Separately in mainland Europe, the same concept was sold from 1995 as the Opel Corsa Twister, converted by R&amp;R Kupfer in the Dutch city of Dordrecht. A small number were exported to the United Kingdom between 1998 and 1999 for sale with Vauxhall Corsa branding.

The final cars were built in 2000, but sales continued into 2001 until the XC model arrived. In the 2008 Used Car Safety Ratings, the SB Barina was assessed as providing an &quot;average&quot; protection.

== Fourth generation (XC; 2001–2005) ==
The fourth-generation XC Barina was released in April 2001, based on the Opel Corsa C platform. It was available to the Australian market in Barina 3 Door and Barina 5 Door models with a Z14XE 1.4-litre 16-valve engine. In September of that year an SRi model with a new Z18XE 1.8-litre engine and the 3-door 1.4-litre SXi joined the line-up. The Barina was awarded the &quot;Wheels Car of the Year&quot; award for 2001. Limited edition Equipe models were released in April 2002.

In January 2003 for the MY03 update, the SXi three-door and CD five-door models replaced the base 1.4-litre cars, but slower sales prompted Holden to revert to the unbadged base model names again from mid-2004 (MY04.5), despite a facelift from January 2004 (MY04) that saw a new nose treatment, some steering and suspension modifications, trim changes and a heavily revised 1.4-litre engine in manual-only base model Barinas.

In the 2008 Used Car Safety Ratings the XC Barina was rated as providing a &quot;better than average&quot; level of occupant protection in the event of an accident, with ANCAP rating the model four out of five stars.

;Pre-facelift
* 1.4-litre &quot;Z14XE&quot; – &quot;base&quot; 3-door (2001–2002)
* 1.4-litre &quot;Z14XE&quot; – &quot;base&quot; 5-door (2001–2002)
* 1.4-litre &quot;Z14XE&quot; – Equipe 3-door (2002)
* 1.4-litre &quot;Z14XE&quot; – Equipe 5-door (2002)
* 1.4-litre &quot;Z14XE&quot; – SXi 3-door (2003; MY03)
* 1.4-litre &quot;Z14XE&quot; – CD 5-door (2003; MY03)
* 1.8-litre &quot;Z18XE&quot; – SRi 3-door (2001–2003)

;Post-facelift
* 1.4-litre &quot;Z14XEP&quot; – SXi 3-door (2004; MY04)
* 1.4-litre &quot;Z14XEP&quot; – CD 5-door (2004; MY04)
* 1.4-litre &quot;Z14XEP&quot; – &quot;base&quot; 3-door (2004–2005; MY04.5 and MY05)
* 1.4-litre &quot;Z14XEP&quot; – &quot;base&quot; 5-door (2004–2005; MY04.5 and MY05)
* 1.8-litre &quot;Z18XE&quot; – SRi 3-door (2004–2005)

== Fifth generation (TK; 2005–2011) ==

In December 2005, Holden dropped the Opel-sourced Barina and rebadged the Daewoo Kalos hatchback as the fifth generation TK Barina. In February 2006, a four-door sedan went on sale, the first sedan type for the Barina nameplate. It is also equipped with a 1.6-litre twin-cam 16-valve &quot;F16D3&quot; Daewoo inline-four engine. The decision to use the Daewoo Kalos as a basis for the car was made to ensure Holden remained highly competitive in the fast-growing small car market in Australia, facing fierce competition from other South Korean-sourced models like the Hyundai Getz. The Opel-sourced model sold at a large loss and was sold to build up a presence in the entry-level new car market in Australia. The Holden Barina was sold in single specification, starting at A$12,990 for the 3-door, which was later changed to A$13,490.

The Daewoo-sourced Holden Barina scored a lower two out of five star ANCAP rating than its European-built, Opel-based predecessor. Criticism was focused on the 2006 Barina TK sedan because of these crash test results, one of the worst in recorded history. As a result, Denny Mooney, the managing director of Holden, was forced to publicly defend the perceived poor reputation of the TK Barina.

=== Pre-facelift ===
=== Facelift ===
The updated TK Barina hatchback was released in August 2008. It has been facelifted with a bolder grille, new headlamps and tail lamps, along with the same interior seen on the sedan model introduced in 2006. Power windows and electric mirrors were standardised in the updated Barina&#x27;s specification. Safety-wise, side-impact air bags have been included as standard fitment. As a result of this, and structural improvements including a high-strength steel reinforced B-pillar, ANCAP rated the car four out of five stars, up from two.

Common issues with the TK throughout the model run were Holden&#x27;s use of an unusual all-plastic thermostat housing design on the engine, which could fail and split apart due to repeated stress and heat cycles. The ABS system is known for electrical faults and failure of the ABS system to operate if the warning light illuminates. Front tire wear was high in the early 2006 models due to factory suspension camber settings, which were revised by 2008. Automatic transmission TK cars were also the subject of a recall due to internal shift solenoids not allowing the car to shift higher than 3rd gear.

== Sixth generation (TM; 2011–2018) ==
The sixth generation TM series Barina debuted at the 2011 Australian International Motor Show held in Melbourne. The 5 door hatch was released for sale in November 2011 and the sedan was launched in February 2012. The TM Barina has a similar interior design seen on the smaller Barina Spark both sharing the same ice blue LCD gauge cluster and a similar centre stack design. The exterior looks much more like the Series II Holden Captiva with similar headlight and grille designs. The TM series is powered by a 1.6-litre petrol engine with a choice of a five-speed or 6-speed manual as well as a six-speed automatic transmission. The TM Barina is based on the second generation Chevrolet Aveo.

In 2015, a limited run Barina X was introduced, based on the CD model (base). Only 700 of them were produced for the Australian market.

The Barina was given a facelift in November 2016, with design updates given to the interior and exterior. The RS and Sedan models were dropped as part of the facelift.

On 14 September 2018, Holden announced that the Barina will be dropped from the line-up.

<doc id="1039637" wikidata="Q1597621" url="?curid=1039637" title="Lochaber axe">
<text>The Lochaber axe (Gaelic: tuagh-chatha) is a type of poleaxe that was used almost exclusively in Scotland. It was usually mounted on a staff about five feet long.

== Design ==
The Lochaber axe is first recorded in 1501, as an &quot;old Scottish batale ax of Lochaber fasoun&quot;.

The weapon is very similar to the Jedburgh axe, although the crescent blade of the former is larger and heavier than that of the latter. The Lochaber axe took many incarnations, all of them having a few elements in common. It was a heavy weapon, used by infantry for a defense against cavalry and as a pike against infantry.

Like most other polearms of the time, it consisted of two parts: shaft and blade. The shaft was usually some long. The blade was about in length which usually resembled a bardiche or voulge in form. The blade might be attached in two places and often had a sharp point coming off the top. In addition a hook (or &quot;cleek&quot;) was attached to the back of the blade. A butt spike was included as a counterweight to the heavy axe head. Langets were incorporated down each side of the shaft to prevent the head from being cut off.

The Lochaber axe had the virtue of being a cheap weapon that could be easily made by a blacksmith. They could be used to arm men who lacked a broadsword or a firearm. Hundreds were hastily made to equip the Earl of Mar&#x27;s levie troops during the Jacobite rising of 1715. A few were carried by Jacobite troops during the early part of the Jacobite rising of 1745. Although by the end of the rising, almost all Jacobites were armed with muskets and bayonets.

== Use ==
In hand-to-hand combat, the axe, in common with other polearms such as the halberd, has a spike on the end, to be used on close combat in a thrusting motion. The axe on the side, coupled with the long pole, delivered a powerful blow to infantry or dismounted cavalry. The example in the Edinburgh Great Hall Museum shows a substantial rear-facing hook, for catching/pulling.

For Lochaber axes used by the city guards of Edinburgh, the hook is almost level with the top of the staff, making them useless as a means to catch a moving object. These hooks, however, may have been used to hang the weapons in the guard room.

<text>Franklin is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northeast part of the visible Moon; it is named after Benjamin Franklin. To the north-northwest is the smaller crater Cepheus, and in the opposite direction to the southwest is the shallow Berzelius.

The rim of Franklin is generally circular, with a pair of outward bulges in the western wall. The inner wall is d, and there is a central peak at the midpoint of the floor. A narrow cleft runs to the west-southwest across the floor, passing to the north of the central peak.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Franklin.

<text>(born May 3, 1959) is a Japanese composer and conductor living in Germany.

==Biography==
Shigeru Kan-no was born in Fukushima, Japan. He now lives as a free-lance composer and conductor in Westerwald, Germany. His repertoire includes over 100 operas and 700 concert pieces. He is also a talented performer, able to play piano, organ, violin, cello, percussion and lyre. As a pianist in the contemporary repertoire, he has played the music of Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Helmut Lachenmann, Giacinto Scelsi, Arvo Pärt, Luciano Berio, Sati, Karkoschka, Blume, etc.

He has won dozens of competitions in composition and conducting, and sixteen bursaries. His conducting experience includes various orchestras and chamber groups, choirs, ensembles for new music, &quot;Posaunenchöre&quot; (German brass band; literally &quot;trombone choir&quot;), operas and singing concerts, etc. A frequent advisor and teacher to other musicians, he has also served as a jurist for international competitions in composition and singing.

The music of Shigeru Kan-no is restrained, and at the same time, strong and colourful. He composes in every form of classical music and uses many musical techniques: tonal, atonal, chance, noise, pentatonic, hexatonic, serial, micro tone, free-form, electronic, minimal, no repetition, counterpoint, harmony, folk music, jazz, concrete, voluntary, etc. He favours long-form works for large orchestra, and his style shows the influence of Richard Wagner, Gustav Mahler, Arnold Schoenberg, Havergal Brian, Olivier Messiaen, John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, LaMonte Young, etc.

He studied singing, piano and musical theory in Fukushima with Takeo Endo, Kazutsugu Saito, Chieko Saito and Kunio Suda. In Tokyo, he studied theory with Hideo Arashino, composition with Takehito Shimazu and Akira Nishimura, piano with Yuko Ozaki and Masako Hoshide, and conducting with Kikuo Matsumoto and Kazuhiko Sakamoto.

<doc id="1039644" wikidata="Q4921367" url="?curid=1039644" title="Crime Museum">
<text>The Crime Museum is a collection of criminal memorabilia kept at New Scotland Yard, headquarters of the Metropolitan Police Service in London, England. Known as the Black Museum until the early 21st century, the museum came into existence at Scotland Yard sometime in 1874, arising out of the collection of prisoners&#x27; property gathered as a result of the Forfeiture Act 1870 and intended as an aid to the police in their study of crime and criminals. Initially unofficial, it had become an official if private museum by 1875, with a police inspector and a police constable assigned to official duty there. Not open to the public, it was used as a teaching collection for police recruits and was only ever accessible by those involved in legal matters, royals and other VIPs.

Now sited in the basement of the Curtis Green Building (the present New Scotland Yard), the museum remains closed to the public but can be visited by officers of the Metropolitan Police and any of the country&#x27;s police forces by prior appointment.

==History==

===Origins===
In his 1993 book &quot;The Black Museum: New Scotland Yard&quot;, the museum&#x27;s then-curator Bill Waddell asserted that its origins lay in an 1869 Act giving the police authority to either destroy items used in the commission of a crime or retain them for instructional purposes, when previous to that Act they had been retained by the police until reclaimed by their owners. No such Act was passed in 1869 and this misapprehension seems to originate in a misdated mention of the Forfeiture Act 1870 in an 1877 newspaper report on the museum:

The 1870 Act abolished forfeiture of property for felony and treason—instead it vested that property&#x27;s &quot;custody and management&quot; in an &quot;administrator&quot;, who would then return it at the end of the prisoner&#x27;s sentence.

The Black Museum was conceived in 1874 by Percy George Neame, a serving inspector who at that time had collected together a number of items, with the intention of giving police officers practical instruction on how to detect and prevent crime. The first exhibits for display were clothing and items belonging to Jane Clouson, 17, murdered in Eltham. By the latter part of 1874, official authority was given for a crime museum to be opened. Neame, with the help of a P.C. Randall, gathered together sufficient material of both old and new cases—initially pertaining to exhibits found in the possession of burglars and thieves—to enable a museum to be subsequently opened. The actual date in 1875 when the Black Museum opened is not known, but the permanent appointment of Neame and Randall to duty in the Prisoners Property Store on 12 April suggests that the museum may have come into being in the latter part of that year.

There was no official opening of the museum, whose first two years saw a steady increase in visitors, particularly by CID officers being instructed in the museum as part of their training, keeping it in constant use. However, no record of visitors was kept until 6 October 1877, when a group of dignitaries were shown round the collection by Commissioner Sir Edmund Henderson, KCB and Assistant Commissioners Lt. Col. Labalmondiere and Capt. Harris. They were the first entries in a visitors&#x27; book which ran until 1894 and—though not all visitors were asked to sign it—it contains many notable figures from the period. One reporter from &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper was refused admittance by Inspector Neame and on 8 April 1877 that journalist coined the name &#x27;Black Museum&#x27; for the collection.

===1890–present===
In 1890 the museum moved with the Metropolitan Police Office to new premises at the other end of Whitehall, on the newly constructed Thames Embankment. The building, constructed by Norman Shaw RA, and made of granite quarried by convicts on Dartmoor, was called New Scotland Yard. A set of rooms in the basement housed the museum and, although there was no Curator as such, PC Randall was responsible for keeping the place tidy, adding to exhibits, vetting applications for visits and arranging dates for them. Inspector Percy Neame retired on 31 December 1901. In June 1902 he committed suicide &quot;by blowing his brains out&quot; when Chief Inspector Arthur Fair and another officer were at his front door, calling in respect of a &quot;few things in his accounts which they could not understand with reference to money seized at gaming houses&quot;. The museum was closed during both World War I and II, and in 1967, with the move of New Scotland Yard to new premises in Victoria Street, S.W.1, the museum was housed in rooms on the second floor, which underwent several renovations.

During the refurbishment and extension of the Curtis Green Building and New Scotland Yard&#x27;s move into it, a major exhibition of artefacts from the museum, The Crime Museum Uncovered, was held at the Museum of London from 9 October 2015 to 10 April 2016. Following the exhibition the museum reopened in 2018 in a &quot;dark and dramatic&quot; room in the basement of the Building designed by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris in collaboration with engineering consultancy Arup.

Though the 2015–2016 exhibition was the only time a large number of exhibits have been displayed to the public, individual objects have been loaned to exhibitions at other museums in 2019–2020. This included objects from Leatherslade Farm in a Great Train Robbery exhibition at the Postal Museum and a cigarette lighter with a hidden compartment from the Krogers in a GCHQ exhibition at the Science Museum, whilst exhibits from the trial of Roger Casement have been on loan to Kerry County Museum since 2016.

==Collections==
The museum displays more than 500 exhibits, each at a constant temperature of . These include historic collections and more recent artefacts, including a substantial collection of melee weapons (some overt, some concealed, all of which have been used in murders or serious assaults in London), shotguns disguised as umbrellas and numerous walking-stick swords. The museum also contains a selection of hangman&#x27;s nooses, including that used to perform the UK&#x27;s last-ever execution, and death masks made for criminals executed at Newgate Prison and acquired in 1902 on the prison&#x27;s closure.

There are also displays from famous cases which include Charlie Peace&#x27;s belongings and letters allegedly written by Jack the Ripper, though the infamous From Hell letter is not part of the collection. The more recent exhibits on display include the ricin-filled pellet that killed Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov in 1978, a model of the possible umbrella that fired the pellet, the fake De Beers diamond from the Millennium Dome heist and Dennis Nilsen&#x27;s actual stove and bathtub. Objects not currently on display include items that once belonged to Charles Black, the most prolific counterfeiter in the Western Hemisphere, including a set of printing plates, a remarkable series of forged banknotes, and a cunningly hollowed-out kitchen door once used to conceal them.

===Cases on display (A–Z)===

==In other media==
In 1951 British commercial radio producer Harry Alan Towers produced a radio series hosted by Orson Welles called &quot;The Black Museum&quot;, inspired by the catalogue of items on display. Each week, the programme featured an item from the museum and a dramatization of the story surrounding the object to the macabre delight of audiences. Often mistakenly cited as a BBC production, Towers commercially syndicated the programme throughout the English-speaking world. The American radio writer Wyllis Cooper also wrote and directed a similar anthology for NBC that ran at the same time in the U. S. called &quot;Whitehall 1212&quot;, for the telephone number of Scotland Yard. The program debuted on 18 November 1951, and was hosted by Chief Superintendent John Davidson, curator of the Black Museum.

*There is a fictional Black Museum, inspired by the actual one, inside the Grand Hall of Justice in the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; comic strip.
*A fictional version of the Black Museum is often referred to in the &quot;Dylan Dog&quot; comic series and, in some stories, exhibits are stolen from the museum.
*In the 1944 film &quot;The Lodger&quot;, Inspector Warwick (George Sanders) gives a tour of the museum to Kitty Langley (Merle Oberon).
*A 1958 horror film called &quot;Horrors of the Black Museum&quot; references the Black Museum in a story of a crime writer (played by Michael Gough) who commits grisly murders in order to write articles and books about them for public consumption.
* The fourth series of Charlie Brooker&#x27;s &quot;Black Mirror&quot; has an episode called &quot;Black Museum&quot;.
* Tony Parsons wrote about the Black Museum in his books about detective Max Wolfe.
* The manga series Kuro Hakubutsukan (Black Museum) takes place in the Crime Museum, during the period it was called Black Museum.

<text>The Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index, or more simply the Wilshire 5000, is a market-capitalization-weighted index of the market value of all American stocks actively traded in the United States. As of December 31, 2023, the index contained 3,403 components. The index is intended to measure the performance of most publicly traded companies headquartered in the United States, with readily available price data (Bulletin Board/penny stocks and stocks of extremely small companies are excluded). Hence, the index includes a majority of the common stocks and REITs traded primarily through New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, or the American Stock Exchange. Limited partnerships and ADRs are not included. It can be tracked by following the ticker ^FTW5000.

==History==
*The Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index was established by the Wilshire Associates in 1974, naming it for the approximate number of issues it included at the time. It was renamed the &quot;Dow Jones Wilshire 5000&quot; in April 2004, after Dow Jones &amp; Company assumed responsibility for its calculation and maintenance. On March 31, 2009, the partnership with Dow Jones was terminated and the index returned to Wilshire Associates.
*The base value for the index was 1404.60 points on base date December 31, 1980, when it had a total market capitalization of US$1,404.596 billion. On that date, each one-index-point change in the index was equal to $1 billion. However, index divisor adjustments due to corporate actions and index composition changes have changed the relationship over time, so that by 2005 each index point reflected a change of about $1.2 billion in the index&#x27;s total market capitalization.
*The index increased tenfold in less than twenty years from its base date, peaking at a 20th-century closing record high of 14,751.64 points on March 24, 2000, a level that would not be surpassed until February 20, 2007. A hypothetical investment in the Wilshire 5000, made at the 2000 peak and with subsequent dividends reinvested, did not become profitable on a closing basis until October 3, 2006.
*On April 20, 2007, the index closed above 15,000 for the first time. On that day, the S&amp;P 500 was still several percentage points below its March 2000 high, because small cap issues absent from the S&amp;P 500 and included in the Wilshire 5000 outperformed the large cap issues that dominate the S&amp;P 500 during the cyclical bull market. The index reached an all-time high on October 9, 2007, at the 15,806.69 point level, right before the onset of the Great Recession and the related financial crisis of 2007–08.
*Since late 2007, the expansion of subprime lending difficulties into a wider financial crisis plunged the United States into a renewed bear market that accelerated beginning on September 15, 2008. On October 8, the Wilshire 5000 closed below 10,000 for the first time since 2003. The index continued trading downward towards a 13-year low, reaching a bottom of 6,858.43 points, on March 9, 2009, representing a loss of about $10.9 trillion in market capitalization from its highs in 2007.
*The Wilshire 5000 gained approximately $2.5 trillion in market value during the first 11 months of 2009 while the index rose 2,105 points. Therefore, as of November 2009, each index point represented about $1.2 billion in market value.
*The index achieved a new highest yearly close on December 31, 2012, a few percent above those of 1999 and 2007, but failed to do so above the 15,000 level (after achieving it intraday) by fewer than 5 points, closing with 14,995.11 points. However, it continued to rise in the short term such that, on February 8, 2013, the index surpassed the 16,000 level for the first time. It would be the first of four 1000-point milestones that the index reached in 2013, as the index closed above 17,000 for the first time on May 3, 18,000 for the first time on August 1, and 19,000 for the first time on November 14. The Wilshire 5000 would close out 2013 on a record high, finishing the December 31, 2013 trading session at 19,706.03 points.
*On February 28, 2014, the Wilshire 5000 had its first intraday high over 20,000 points. On March 4, the index closed above this milestone for the first time. On July 1, 2014, the index closed above the 21,000 level for the first time; it would close above 25,000 for the first time in mid-2017.
*On August 24, 2018, the Wilshire 5000 had its first intraday high and its first closing over 30,000 points.
*In March 2020, the index closed below the 25,000 level for the first time since 2016.
*On January 7, 2021, the Wilshire 5000 had its first intraday high and its first closing over 40,000 points.
*On February 2, 2024, the Wilshire 5000 had its first intraday high closing over 50,000 points.
*On November 7, 2024, the Wilshire 5000 had its first closing above 60,000 points.

== Record high values ==
==Versions==
There are five versions of the index:
*Full capitalization total return
*Full capitalization price
*Float-adjusted total return
*Float-adjusted price
*Equal weight
The difference between the total return and price versions of the index is that the total return versions accounts for reinvestment of dividends. The difference between the full capitalization, float-adjusted, and equal weight versions is in how the index components are weighted. The full cap index uses the total shares outstanding for each company. The float-adjusted index uses shares adjusted for free float. The equal-weighted index assigns each security in the index the same weight.

==Calculation==
Let:

* &quot;M&quot; = Number of issues included in the index; 
* &quot;P&quot;i = Price of one share of issue &quot;i&quot; included in the index;
* &quot;N&quot;i = Number of shares of issue &quot;i&quot; for the full capitalization version, or the float of issue &quot;i&quot; for the float-adjusted version;
* formula_1 = a fixed scaling factor.

The value of the index is then:

:formula_2

At present, one index point corresponds to a little more than US$1 billion of market capitalization.

The list of issues included in the index is updated monthly to add new listings resulting from corporate spin-offs and initial public offerings, and to remove issues which move to the pink sheets or that have ceased trading for at least 10 consecutive days.

==Alternatives==

The CRSP U.S. Total Market Index (ticker CRSPTM1) is a very similar comprehensive index of U.S. stocks supplied by the Center for Research in Security Prices. It was especially designed for use by index funds. After Dow Jones and Wilshire split up, Dow Jones made their own total stock market index, called the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index, similar to the Wilshire 5000.

Of the popular indexes, the Wilshire 5000 has been found to be the best index to use as a benchmark for US stock valuations.

<doc id="1039651" wikidata="Q1501124" url="?curid=1039651" title="Geminus (crater)">
<text>Geminus is a lunar impact crater that is located near the northeast limb of the visible Moon. In this position the crater appears oval in shape due to foreshortening, but it is actually more nearly circular in form. It was named by the IAU in 1935.

The circular rim of Geminus contain a number of outward notches, particularly to the north and east. The crater ejecta is still visible in the rough surroundings beyond the rim, but any rays deposited during the impact have long since been worn away by space weathering. The inner wall is wide and extensively d, although these features are now somewhat muted due to impact erosion. There are no notable impacts on the interior floor, but there is a long, slender central ridge located at the midpoint and a pair of readily observed clefts.

Notable nearby craters include Messala to the northeast, Bernoulli due east, and Burckhardt and Cleomedes to the south.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Geminus.

<text>The Iraq national football team () represents Iraq in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Iraq Football Association (IFA), the governing body for football in Iraq. Iraq&#x27;s usual home venue is the Basra International Stadium.

Iraq have made one FIFA World Cup appearance in 1986, scoring a solitary goal against Belgium. Iraq are one of eight current AFC nations to have won the AFC Asian Cup, claiming the title in 2007 in spite of difficult conditions and limited preparation. Iraq defeated some of the favourites in the competition including Australia, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. This qualified them for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup where they earned two points in the group stage; they later finished fourth at the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.

Iraq are the Arab Cup&#x27;s most successful team with four titles, and have also won the Arabian Gulf Cup four times and the WAFF Championship once. Iraq is known for its passionate football fans and the national team is seen as a symbol of hope and unity for Iraqi people. The team reached its highest FIFA World Ranking of 39th in October 2004.

==History==
===Early years===

On 8 October 1948, the Iraq Football Association was founded. The Iraq FA joined FIFA in 1950 and in April 1951, Iraq played their first match: a 5–0 win over the Civil Cantonment (CC) team of Habbaniyah. Iraq&#x27;s first ever official international game came in the opening game of the 1957 Arab Games in Beirut where Iraq drew 3–3 to Morocco with goals from Ammo Baba, Youra Eshaya (both from Iraq&#x27;s Assyrian minority) and Fakhri Mohammed Salman. One of the members of Iraq&#x27;s first national team was Youra Eshaya, who in 1954 became the first Iraqi footballer to play in England for Bristol Rovers Colts.

In 1962, Iraq appointed their first foreign manager, Romanian coach Cornel Drăgușin. Iraq won their first trophy in 1964 when they won the Arab Cup, winning three and drawing one of their four games. In the following edition, they retained their Arab Cup title, beating Syria 2–1 in the final in Baghdad.

===1970s===
In 1972, Iraq played at their first ever AFC Asian Cup but failed to win a game in the tournament. In March 1973, Iraq played their first ever FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign. They finished second in their group, a point behind Australia, therefore failing to qualify for the next round. In the remaining years of the 1970s, Iraq reached the second round of the Asian Games (1974), lost the Arabian Gulf Cup final (1976), finished fourth at the AFC Asian Cup (1976), finished fourth in the Asian Games (1978) and finally hosted and won the Arabian Gulf Cup (1979). The 1976 Asian Cup would be the last Asian Cup that Iraq appeared in for the next 20 years, as they withdrew from the next four editions.

===1980s – First Golden Generation===
The 1980s was arguably Iraq&#x27;s most successful period in their history. They started the decade off disappointingly, being knocked out in the first round of qualifiers for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. In 1982, they won the gold medal at the 1982 Asian Games. In 1984, Iraq won the Arabian Gulf Cup. The following year, they won the 1985 Arab Cup and also won the gold medal at the 1985 Arab Games.

====1986 FIFA World Cup====
Iraq were seeded into the first round of qualifiers where they faced Qatar and Jordan. Iraq topped Group 1B with 6 points, and advanced to the second round. Iraq faced United Arab Emirates in two legs. Iraq defeated UAE 3–2 in Dubai.
Iraq lost with 2–1 to UAE in the second leg. Iraq won 4–4 aggregate on away goals and advanced to the final round. In the final round, Iraq tied Syria 0–0 in Damascus. Iraq defeated Syria 3–1 in the second leg in Taif. Iraq won 3–1 on aggregate and qualified to the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

At their first game of the Group B at the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Iraq played well against Paraguay, losing narrowly 1–0 despite scoring a goal that was controversially disallowed by the referee. Iraq recorded their first World Cup goal in the second game, scoring against Belgium in a 1–2 defeat despite having ten men, with Ahmed Radhi scoring a goal for Iraq. Iraq played against hosts Mexico in the third game, losing 1–0 and being eliminated from the World Cup.

In the following years, Iraq won the 1988 Arabian Gulf Cup and won the 1988 Arab Cup. Overall, Iraq won nine competitions in the 1980s and played in their only World Cup, leading many to believe that this was the golden era of Iraqi football. In 1989, Iraq competed in qualifying for a berth in the 1990 World Cup finals, but they lost a crucial game against Qatar.

===1990s – The Dark Era===
Following the Gulf War in 1990, Iraq was banned from participating in the Asian Games and in most Arab competitions. The ban wasn&#x27;t extended to the Asian Cup and World Cup.

====1994 FIFA World Cup qualification====
In 1993, Iraq participated in qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Grouped with China, Yemen, Jordan and Pakistan in the first stage, Iraq proved to be too strong for the rest, with the team only failing to win twice, a draw to Jordan and loss to China.

In the final round, Iraq was grouped with Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan, Iran and North Korea. On the first matchday, Iraq lost 3–2 to North Korea in a dramatic way, being 2–0 ahead in the second half. After an Iraqi player was sent off, North Korea pulled back in the 67th minute, equalized in the 77th minute and scored the winner in the 82nd minute. They then tied 2–2 with South Korea. and then defeated Iran 2–1 by goals of Ahmed Radhi and Alaa Kadhim.

Iraq missed out on a World Cup spot by two points. By drawing their last game with Japan 2–2, they denied the Japanese a place in the finals in a match referred to by the Japanese media as the Agony of Doha. The loss against North Korea proved to be the difference with the other teams, as North Korea lost their other 4 matches and finished bottom of the group.

====1996 AFC Asian Cup====
Iraq participated in the 1996 AFC Asian Cup, their first Asian Cup campaign for 20 years of withdrawing from the previous four. They reached the quarter-finals but lost to the United Arab Emirates due to a golden goal scored by Abdulrahman Ibrahim. In 1996, Iraq was ranked 139th in the world, which is their worst FIFA ranking in their history due to inactivity after withdrawing from several tournaments.

In 1997, Iraq participated in qualifiers for the 1998 FIFA World Cup but were knocked out at the first round following two defeats by Kazakhstan.

This period is known as &#x27;The Dark Era&#x27; as Uday Hussein, the son of Saddam Hussein and then-president of IFA, abused his control of Iraqi football and tortured players who played poorly, punishing them by sending them to prison, making them bathe in raw sewage and kick concrete balls, and shaving their heads among many other punishments.

===2000s – Second Golden Generation===
The 2000s was considered to be the rebirth of a new Iraqi football golden generation. However, Iraq had a rocky beginning.

====2000 AFC Asian Cup====
Iraq played in the 2000 AFC Asian Cup but were knocked out at the quarter-final stage again, this time by Japan in a 4–1 loss.

====2002 FIFA World Cup qualification====
Iraq reached the final round of 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification for the first time since 1994 but lost five of their eight second-round games and therefore failed to make the finals.

Iraq won their first ever WAFF Championship in 2002, beating Jordan 3–2 in the final after extra time.

====2004 AFC Asian Cup====
In 2004, Iraq lost the opening match against Uzbekistan then they won against Turkmenistan and Saudi Arabia respectively, to reach the quarter-finals of the AFC Asian Cup before getting knocked out by China.

====2006 FIFA World Cup qualification====
In the same year they were knocked out at the second round of 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers by Uzbekistan.

Iraq were ranked as high as 39th in the World Rankings in October 2004 which is their highest ranking position in their history. The following year, Iraq won the gold medal in the West Asian Games by beating Syria in the final via a penalty shootout. In 2007, Iraq were knocked out at the group stage of the Arabian Gulf Cup after a controversial defeat to Saudi Arabia. Akram Salman was sacked and Jorvan Vieira appointed as head coach. Under him, Iraq reached the final of the WAFF Championship but lost 2–1 to Iran.

====2007 AFC Asian Cup triumph====

In July 2007, Iraq kicked off their 2007 AFC Asian Cup campaign. The squad was made mainly of players that won the 2000 AFC Youth Championship, finished fourth at the 2004 Olympic Games and second at the 2006 Asian Games. Vieira only had two months to prepare his team for the tournament, and the team suffered from very poor facilities. The Iraq FA struggled to provide the team with enough kits for the tournament and Iraq had not been able to play any previous games in their own country for security reasons and most of the players had had family members killed in the war.

The team started the tournament with a 1–1 draw against joint-hosts Thailand before producing a 3–1 win over favourites Australia. A draw with Oman followed to put Iraq into the quarter-finals where two goals from Younis Mahmoud against Vietnam put Iraq into the semi-finals for the second time in their history. They manages to knock out one of the best Asian teams, South Korea in the semis via a penalty shootout in which Noor Sabri made a crucial save. After the game, a suicide bomber killed 30 football fans who were celebrating the semi-final win over South Korea and this almost led to the Iraqi team withdrawing from the final, but they decided to go on in honour of the dead and succeeded in doing that after defeating Saudi Arabia 1–0 in the final, a game that they dominated from start to finish and that was won by a Younis Mahmoud header. This tournament win is seen as one of the greatest upsets in international history as a war-torn country became international champions in what is described as one of sport&#x27;s greatest &#x27;fairytales&#x27;.

Vieira stated during the final that he would resign after the Asian Cup. He was replaced by Egil Olsen in September 2007.

====2010 FIFA World Cup qualification====
Under Egil Olsen, Iraq advanced from the first round by beating Pakistan 7–0 on aggregate. Then they were drawn with Australia, China, and Qatar for the second round. On the first matchday, Iraq tied China. As a consequence, Olsen was sacked and replaced by Adnan Hamad.

The next two matches saw Iraq lose twice to Qatar and Australia. However, Iraq bounced back with an 1–0 win on Australia and 2–1 win against China.

On 26 May 2008, FIFA decided to suspend Iraq from all international competitions after the Iraq Football Association was disbanded by the government on 20 May 2008. The suspension was provisionally and conditionally lifted on 29 May 2008.

Iraq needed 1 point to advance to the final stage on the last matchday, but failed to advance to the final round of 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers as a 1–0 defeat to Qatar saw them finish in third in the group. Following this, the Iraq FA decided to disband the team and sacked Hamad.

Qatar fielded ineligible player Emerson in the 2–0 defeat to Iraq on 26 March 2008, prompting FIFA to controversially suspend him but clear Qatar of any wrongdoing, in direct contradiction to its decisions against Singapore. Iraq appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but it was rejected by the CAS, saying that Iraq submitted documents and appeal fees too late.

Jorvan Vieira was reappointed in September 2008. After a disappointing 2009 Arabian Gulf Cup, Vieira was sacked and replaced by Bora Milutinovic.

====2009 FIFA Confederations Cup====
In 2009, Iraq participated in only their second FIFA tournament ever: the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, which they qualified for by winning the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. They started the tournament with a 0–0 draw with hosts South Africa, before losing 1–0 to UEFA Euro 2008 winners Spain. Iraq drew the last game 0–0 with New Zealand and were knocked out.

On 20 November 2009, the FIFA Emergency Committee suspended the Iraq FA due to government interference; the suspension was lifted on 19 March 2010.

===2010s – Ups and downs===
====2011 AFC Asian Cup====
Iraq qualified automatically for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. They were drawn against Iran, North Korea and UAE in Group D. After a 2–1 loss against Iran, and 1–0 win against UAE, Iraq went into the match against North Korea needing only a draw to progress. Iraq won 1–0 and advanced to the quarterfinals as group runners-up. On 23 January, Iraq lost to Australia, 1–0, in the quarterfinal. The match went into extra time with Harry Kewell heading in a goal in the 117th minute just inside the 18-yard box.

====2014 FIFA World Cup qualification====
Under coach Wolfgang Sidka, Iraq were drawn into the second round of qualifiers where they faced Yemen. Iraq defeated Yemen 2–0 in Arbil on 23 July before drawing 0–0 in Al Ain five days later. Iraq advanced to the third round of qualifiers where they were grouped with Jordan, China and Singapore. The IFA announced it would not renew Wolfgang Sidka&#x27;s contract on 2 August 2011. On 29 August 2011, Brazilian legend Zico signed a one-year contract to become the new coach of Iraq.

Iraq topped Group A with 15 points, and in the final qualification stage was drawn with Jordan, Japan, Australia and Oman. Iraq started with 1–1 draws against Jordan away and Oman at home. After their slow start, Iraq lost 1–0 to Japan away and lost a crucial home match against Australia 2–1, moving them into bottom position with 2 points. On 14 November 2012, Iraq won 1–0 against Jordan in Doha which elevated them to third in Group B, behind Australia on goal difference and ahead of Oman.

On 28 November 2012, Zico resigned as head coach. The Iraqi FA appointed Vladimir Petrović as his replacement on 25 February 2013. However, on 11 June 2013, Iraq lost 1–0 to Japan in Doha and were eliminated from the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

====2015 AFC Asian Cup====
Iraq were in a 2015 AFC Asian Cup qualifying group alongside Saudi Arabia, China and Indonesia. After losing consecutively against China and Saudi Arabia, Iraq was in danger of missing out on the Asian Cup. They kept alive their hopes of qualifying for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup with a 2–0 away win over Indonesia on 19 November 2013, and on the last matchday, Iraq booked their spot with a commanding 3–1 win at the Sharjah Stadium against China. Due to bad results at the 22nd Arabian Gulf Cup, Hakeem Shaker was sacked and the FA appointed Radhi Shenaishil as caretaker coach.

Iraq began the 2015 AFC Asian Cup campaign with a 1–0 win over Jordan. In the next match, Iraq faced Japan and lost the match 0–1. Iraq then beat Palestine 2–0 and qualified to knockout stage as the Group D runner-up. Iraq defeated Iran in the quarter-finals in penalties, 7–6, after the game ended 3–3 after 120 minutes of play. They faced South Korea in the semi-finals but lost 0–2. Iraq finished the AFC Asian Cup in fourth place, after losing 2–3 to United Arab Emirates in third/fourth place play-off.

====2018 FIFA World Cup qualification====
For the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Iraq were drawn with Thailand, Vietnam and Chinese Taipei.

In August 2015, Yahya Alwan was appointed coach for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. After initially starting well with a 5–1 win against Chinese Taipei, two consecutive draws against Thailand and Vietnam left Iraq in real danger of missing out on the final round. On 24 March 2016, Iraq tied 2–2 with Thailand and Alwan was replaced with Abdul-Ghani Shahad. Five days later, he led Iraq to the final round and 2019 AFC Asian Cup by beating Vietnam 1–0.

On 15 April 2016, Radhi Shenaishil became the new coach of Iraq in order to lead the team in the final round. For the final round, Iraq was drawn with Japan, Australia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Thailand. After seven matchdays, Iraq only managed to collect 4 points by beating Thailand and tie 1–1 with Australia. As a result, Shenaishil was sacked on April 10, 2017.

Basim Qasim was appointed for the remainder of the qualifiers and Iraq finished fifth in the final round of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification.

====2019 AFC Asian Cup====
The 2019 Asian Cup draw put Iraq in Group D, with Iran, Vietnam, and Yemen.

On 3 September 2018, Srečko Katanec was appointed as head coach on a three-year contract to lead Iraq in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup and 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification.

Their first match took place on 8 January 2019 against Vietnam and ended in a 3–2 victory for Iraq. Their second match against Yemen on January 12 ended in a 3–0 victory, with goals coming from Mohanad Ali, Bashar Resan, and Alaa Abbas. In their final group game, Iraq faced Iran on January 16, resulting in a 0–0 draw. With these performances, Iraq finished second in Group D and advanced to the knockout stage.

In the Round of 16, Iraq faced Qatar. Despite their efforts, Iraq suffered a 1–0 defeat, with Bassam Al-Rawi scoring the only goal, ending their journey in the tournament. Qatar later won the tournament.

===2020s ===

====2022 FIFA World Cup qualification====
Iraq participated in the second round of the Asian qualifiers. They were placed in Group C alongside Bahrain, Iran, Cambodia, and Hong Kong and reached the final round with five wins from eight matches including a 2–1 victory against Iran.

Iraq went 19 consecutive matches without losing between 2019 and 2021 and moved up from 89th to 68th in the FIFA rankings during Katanec&#x27;s tenure. Katanec departed in July 2021 after six months of unpaid wages and filed a complaint with FIFA.

On 31 July 2021, Dutchman Dick Advocaat was appointed head coach of Iraq. Under Advocaat, Iraq made to a slow start to the final round of World Cup Qualifiers, drawing four games and losing two, and on 21 November 2021, Advocaat resigned. Željko Petrović took charge of the team for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup, where Iraq were eliminated from the group stage. Petrović was sacked after two further winless qualifying games and Abdul-Ghani Shahad was appointed as an interim manager, but Iraq were eliminated after finishing fourth in the group.

====2023 AFC Asian Cup====
Iraq was drawn in Group D, with Japan, Vietnam, and Indonesia. On 15 January 2024, Iraq overcame Indonesia 3–1. Four days later, Iraq created the biggest shock in the tournament, stunning Japan (who had been undefeated in the last 11 matches) by beating them 2–1 in the second group match to ensure first place in the group; both Iraq goals were scored by Aymen Hussein. With the outcome confirmed, Iraq largely rotated their squad on the final match against Vietnam, and ended up triumphant 3–2 to make history by earning a perfect record of nine points. However, Iraq suffered a shock defeat in the Round of 16, losing 2–3 to Jordan to exit the tournament. The result was controversial due to a second yellow card shown to Aymen Hussein by the referee for his celebration after he had scored to take a 2–1 lead.

====2026 FIFA World Cup qualification====
On 7 November 2022, Jesús Casas was appointed head coach of Iraq to lead the national team until the 2026 FIFA World Cup. In the first tournament under Casas&#x27; leadership, Iraq hosted and won the 25th Arabian Gulf Cup, beating Oman 3–2 after extra time in the final.

Iraq was placed in Group F of the second round alongside Vietnam, Philippines and Indonesia. After four wins in a row against Indonesia, Vietnam and back to back wins against Philippines, Iraq progressed to the next round and qualified for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup.

===Nickname===

The Iraqi team is commonly known as &quot;Usood al-Rafidayn&quot; (), meaning &quot;Lions of Mesopotamia&quot;. In ancient Mesopotamia, the Babylonian lion was a symbol of power, impetuosity, ferocity, prestige and dominance. This is reflected in the sculpted lions in Babylon, where the processional path is ornamented with ceramic tile bas-reliefs representing a prestigious lion from the time of Nebuchadnezzar II. This kind of representation aimed to glorify the king, master of the beasts, and also represent the defeat of the enemy. Moreover, the Mesopotamian royal inscriptions depict the king as a ferocious lion to whom nothing can be resisted. The presence of lions in ancient Iraqi civilization was based on the belief, or desire, that the animals represented would bring with them the virtues they symbolized, so that they could be transmitted to the owners.

===Team logo===
Iraq kits throughout history have usually featured the flag of Iraq on them, although the coat of arms of Iraq and the Iraq Football Association logo have both appeared on kits in the past. The national team has occasionally had its own unique logo, the first of which was from 1982 to 1983. This logo was based on the Iraq flag, with &quot;Iraqi&quot; written at the top of the crest. From 2000 to 2002, the national team&#x27;s logo featured a green outline with the word &quot;Iraq&quot; written at the top in green Arabic text. In the 2005 West Asian Games, the team wore a new logo with the red band of the flag appearing in a large semi-circle shape, and in 2007, Iraq briefly reverted to using the logo that they had used from 2000 to 2002. On 23 October 2020, the national team&#x27;s current logo was revealed, with a star featuring above the crest to commemorate the nation&#x27;s 2007 AFC Asian Cup victory.

===Rivalries===
Due to its geographical location, Iraq maintains strong rivalries with many neighbours.

Iraq&#x27;s main and traditional rival has been Iran, and they are often considered to be two of the greatest football teams in the Middle East and Asia with one of the greatest rivalries. At the early stage, Iran had proved to be more dominant than Iraq, remaining undefeated from 1964 until 1993. In the contemporary era, especially during the reign of Saddam Hussein, the two countries had bad relations and fought the Iran–Iraq War for eight years. Iraqis have considered any matches against Iran as a must-win encounter and are known to treat it differently from any other football matches. Iraq has played 31 matches against Iran with 6 victories, 7 draws, and 18 losses.

Iraq&#x27;s other rival is Saudi Arabia, and matches between the two teams also draw significant attention from Iraqi fans, with Iraq and Saudi Arabia being recognised as the two most successful Arab teams in Asia. The beginnings of the footballing rivalry between them dates back to the 1970s, but it was only after the 1990s that the rivalry between the two Arab nations truly developed since it was previously overshadowed by Iraq&#x27;s rivalries with Iran and Kuwait. One of these reasons for the rivalry to develop is due to the bitter Gulf War, where Iraq fought against Saudi Arabia over Kuwait, an ally of Saudi Arabia. These encounters have also been marred with various controversies and hostilities, such as the 21st Arabian Gulf Cup hosting rights, where Iraq was stripped from hosting with the tournament instead being moved to Bahrain, a move which was believed by Iraqis as a deliberate act by Saudi Arabia to remove Iraq&#x27;s home advantage. Before that, Iraq was also banned from hosting home games against Saudi Arabia due to the Gulf War. Iraq has played 40 matches against Saudi Arabia with 18 victories, 11 draws, and 11 losses.

Iraq&#x27;s rivalry with Kuwait was once considered the greatest football rivalry in the Middle East, until being taken over by Iraq&#x27;s rivalry with Saudi Arabia due to Kuwait&#x27;s decline. The rivalry began in the mid-1970s. Because of the Gulf War, Iraq and Kuwait were in complete avoidance and never met for more than 15 years until 2005. Iraq has played 37 matches against Kuwait with 17 victories, 10 draws, and 10 losses.

===Supporters===

Iraq national team supporters are known for chanting &quot;O Victorious Baghdad&quot; (&quot;منصورة يا بغداد&quot;) or &quot;With our souls and our blood, we will redeem you, O Iraq&quot; (&quot;بالروح بالدم نفديك يا عراق&quot;) during the Iraqi team&#x27;s matches.

Another famous chant is &quot;the first goal is coming&quot; (&quot;هسه يجي الاول&quot;) which is chanted in the beginning of the match. A succeeding chant is &quot;the second goal is coming&quot; (&quot;هسه يجي الثاني&quot;); this is usually chanted repeatedly after Iraq score a goal to motivate the players to score another.

===Home matches in Iraq===
Iraq primarily plays its home matches at Basra International Stadium but has also used various other venues across the country. Since 1980, FIFA has imposed bans on Iraq hosting competitive international matches on six occasions.

The first ban came in 1980 after fan and player violence during a match against Kuwait. Although lifted in 1982, the Iran–Iraq War led to a renewed ban. During this period, Iraq played home games at neutral venues but still qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup and three Olympic Games tournaments. The ban ended in 1988 after the war.

A new ban followed the Gulf War in 1990 which lasted until 1995. Iraq hosted matches during the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers but was again forced to play abroad following the Iraq War in 2003. Home matches resumed in 2009, but security concerns led to another ban in 2011.

Between 2013 and 2018, Iraq hosted friendlies in Baghdad, Basra, and Karbala, culminating in FIFA lifting the ban in 2018. Basra hosted the 2018 AFC Cup Final, while the 2019 WAFF Championship was held in Karbala and Erbil. However, the Iraqi protests in 2019 led to another ban, forcing Iraq to play its home games at neutral venues during the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

In 2023, Iraq successfully hosted the Arabian Gulf Cup for the first time since 1979, and resumed hosting official matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

<text>Godin is a lunar impact crater located just to the south of the crater Agrippa, on a rough upland region to the east of Sinus Medii. Its diameter is 34 km. The crater was named after 18th century French astronomer Louis Godin. The ruined crater Tempel lies to the northeast, on the east side of Agrippa. Due south is the flooded remains of Lade.

The rim of Godin is wider in the southern half than in the north, giving it a slightly pear-shaped outline. The interior is rough-surfaced, with a higher albedo than the surroundings. At the midpoint a central peak rises from the floor. A faint ray system surrounds the crater, and extends for about 375 kilometers. Due to its rays, Godin is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Godin.

<text>Tabbouleh (), also transcribed tabouleh, tabbouli, tabouli, or taboulah, is a Levantine salad of finely chopped parsley, soaked bulgur, tomatoes, mint, and onion, seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and sweet pepper. Some variations add lettuce, or use semolina instead of bulgur.

Tabbouleh is traditionally served as part of a mezze in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Arab world. Like hummus, baba ghanoush, pita bread, and other elements of Arab cuisine, tabbouleh has become a popular food in the United States.

==Etymology==
The Levantine Arabic is derived from the Arabic word from the Aramaic root word or more literally &quot;dip&quot;. Use of the word in English first appeared in the 1950s.

==History==
Originally from the mountains of Lebanon and Syria, tabbouleh has become one of the most popular salads in the Middle East. The wheat variety &quot;salamouni&quot; cultivated in the Beqaa Valley region in Lebanon, was considered (in the mid-19th century) as particularly well-suited for making bulgur, a basic ingredient of tabbouleh. In Lebanon, the Lebanese National Tabbouleh Day is a yearly festivity day dedicated to Tabbouleh. , it is celebrated the first Saturday of the month of July.

==Regional variations==

In the Arab world, especially Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, it is usually served as part of a meze. The Syrian and the Lebanese use more parsley than bulgur wheat in their dish. A Turkish variation of the dish known as , and a similar Armenian dish known as use far more bulgur than parsley. Another ancient variant is called . In the Dominican Republic, a local version introduced by Syrian and Lebanese immigrants is called . It is widely popular in Israel.

==Retail sales==

Several manufacturers make tabbouleh for sale in supermarkets.

<text>Field Marshal count Augustin Ehrensvärd (25 September 1710 – 4 October 1772) was a Swedish military officer, military architect, artist, creator of the Suomenlinna (Sveaborg) fortress, Svartholm fortress and the Swedish archipelago fleet. He was born in Fullerö Castle, Barkarö and died in the village of Saris, Mynämäki. 

In 1747, he was chosen by king Frederick I of Sweden to design and construct a maritime fortress near Helsinki in Finland, then a part of the Kingdom of Sweden. Building the fortress of Sveaborg became a life&#x27;s work for Ehrensvärd, who kept expanding the island fortress until his death in 1772. Ehrensvärd&#x27;s design was a low-profile bastion-type fortress that would follow the natural contours of the islands and thus remain inconspicuous to enemy fleets. Many of the constructions in Sveaborg are considered to be architectural masterpieces. Augustin Ehrensvärd was also the commander of the Swedish archipelago fleet from 1756 to 1766, and from 1770, until his death in 1772.

In addition to architecture, Ehrensvärd&#x27;s interests included painting, educational psychology and botany. Upon his death in 1772, Ehrensvärd was promoted to the rank of field marshal. He was also well respected by the Finnish people, who appreciated his efforts in the construction of Sveaborg, an important cultural and economic centre in the eastern part of 18th-century Sweden, which later would become modern Finland. Ehrensvärd&#x27;s burial monument in Sveaborg was designed by king Gustav III of Sweden himself.

Ehrensvärd was elected a member of the member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1739, the year it was founded.

<text>==Major events==
The administrative reform of 1727 was carried out soon after Peter the Great&#x27;s death, when it became apparent that previous reform was not working as planned. The fast pace of the reforms came into contradiction with the traditional ways of doing things. Newly created bureaucracy required significant financial investments, which the government was lacking. Neither Catherine I, Peter I&#x27;s second wife and successor, nor her government were willing to go on with the reforms in their original form. As a result, the 1727 reform became a step back, abolishing the system of &quot;districts&quot; () and restoring the old system of &quot;uezds&quot; (уе́зды) instead. A total of 166 &quot;uyezds&quot; were re-established, and with the newly created &quot;uyezds&quot; the Russian Empire had approximately 250 &quot;uyezds&quot;.

*1727—new Belgorod Governorate was formed from Belgorod, Oryol, and Sevsk Provinces (провинции) of Kiev Governorate.
*1727—new Novgorod Governorate was formed from Belozersk, Novgorod, Pskov, Tver, and Velikiye Luki Provinces of the St. Petersburg Governorate.
*1727—Uglich and Yaroslavl Provinces of the St. Petersburg Governorate were transferred to Moscow Governorate.
*1727—Narva Province of St. Petersburg Governorate was transferred to Revel Governorate.

<text>Gruithuisen is a lunar impact crater that lies on the section of lunar mare that joins Oceanus Procellarum in the west to Mare Imbrium in the east. Southeast of Gruithuisen is the small crater Delisle. To the south is Dorsum Bucher, a wrinkle ridge running in a north–south direction for about 90 kilometers.

The rim of Gruithuisen is relatively smooth and circular, projecting only slightly above the surrounding mare. The interior is relatively featureless with a small floor, with mounds of material deposited along the edges of the sloping inner walls.
To the north of the crater, along the edge of the highland peninsula between the two maria is a domed mountainous rise that is designated Mons Gruithuisen Gamma (γ). Just to the east of this feature is another mountainous rise named Mons Gruithuisen Delta (δ). Northwest of Gruithuisen crater is concentrated cluster of several craterlets, which was most likely formed from a single body that broke up just prior to impact.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Gruithuisen.

<doc id="1039685" wikidata="Q1269770" url="?curid=1039685" title="Dane axe">
<text>The Dane axe or long axe (including &quot;Danish axe&quot; and &quot;English long axe&quot;) is a type of European early medieval period two-handed battle axe with a very long shaft, around at the low end to or more at the long end. Sometimes called a broadaxe (), the blade was broad and thin, intended to give a long powerful cut when swung, effective against cavalry, shields and unarmored opponents.

Dane axes were predominantly used during the European Viking Age to the transition between the Early Middle Ages and High Middle Ages, later being developed into the poleaxe, halberd and other similar polearms by lengthening the shaft and adding a lengthwise pike on the end and spike on the reverse. It is one of the predominant weapons depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry, a period tapestry depicting the events of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, and one of the specified weapons common with the Varangian Guard.

== Construction ==

Most axes, both in period illustrations and extant artifact, that fall under the description of Danish axe possess type L or type M heads according to the Petersen axe typology. Both types consist of a wide, thin blade, with pronounced &quot;horns&quot; at both the toe and heel of the bit. Cutting surfaces vary, but is generally between . Type L blades tend to be smaller, with the toe of the bit swept forward for superior shearing capability. Later type M blades are typically larger overall, with a more symmetrical toe and heel.

The blade itself was reasonably light and forged very thin, making it superb for cutting. The thickness of the body on top the edge is as thin as . Many of these axes were constructed with a reinforced bit, typically of a higher carbon steel to facilitate a harder, sharper edge. Average weight of an axe this size is between . Proportionally, the long axe has more in common with a modern meat cleaver than a wood axe. This complex construction (i.e. forged thin and incorporating a harder type of steel near the edge) results in a lively and quick weapon with devastating cutting ability.

Based on period depictions, the haft of a longaxe for combat was usually between approx. long, although Dane axes used as status symbols might be as long as 1.5 to 1.7 m (5 to 5½ ft). Such axes might also feature inlaid silver and frequently do not have the flared steel edge of a weapon designed for war. Some surviving examples also feature a brass haft cap, often richly decorated, which presumably served to keep the head of the weapon secure on the haft, as well as protecting the end of the haft from the rigours of battle. Ash and oak are the most likely materials for the haft, as they have always been the primary materials used for polearms in Europe.

== History ==
Through the course of the 9th to the 11th centuries, the Dane axe began to gain further popularity outside of Scandinavia, either through Viking trade or influence or independent developments; such as England, Ireland and Normandy. Historical accounts may depict the Dane axe as the weapon of some of the warrior elite in this period, such as the Huscarls of Anglo-Saxon England. In the Bayeux tapestry, a visual record of the ascent of William the Conqueror to the throne of England, the axe is almost exclusively wielded by well armoured huscarls. These huscarls formed the core bodyguard of King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. A Dane axe, perhaps King Edward&#x27;s, is offered to Harold before he is crowned. The Bayeux Tapestry also depicts a huscarl cleaving a Norman knight&#x27;s horse&#x27;s head with one blow. The Dane axe is also known to have been used by the Varangian Guard, also known as (), the &quot;axe-bearing guard&quot;, who were mercenary soldiers from northern and eastern Europe employed by the Roman emperors. One surviving ivory plaque from 10th-century Constantinople depicts a Varangian holding an axe that is at least as tall as its wielder.

The Dane axe became widely used throughout Europe from the 10th century, with axes gaining acceptance as a knightly weapon not long after; albeit not achieving the status of the sword. They also began to be used widely as an infantry polearm, with the haft lengthened to about . The 13th and 14th centuries also saw form changes, with the blade also lengthening, the rear horn extending to touch or attach to the haft. The lengthened weapon, especially if combined with the lengthened blade, was called a &quot;sparth&quot; in England. Some believe this weapon is the ancestor of the halberd.

While the use of the Dane axe continued into the 14th century, axes with an armour-piercing back-spike and spear-like spike on the forward end of the haft became more common, eventually evolving into the poleaxe in the 15th century. The simple Danish axe continued to be used in the West of Scotland and in Ireland into the 16th century. In Ireland, it was particularly associated with gallowglass mercenaries.

== Famous historical figures associated with the axe ==
After the Battle of Stiklestad, the axe also became the symbol of St. Olaf and can still be seen on the Coat of Arms of Norway. However, this is because the axe is the implement of his martyrdom, rather than signifying use.

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes how a giant Norse axeman wielding what was most likely a Dane axe, single-handedly cut down up to 40 Englishman during the battle of Stamford bridge. Supposedly, he was only defeated when an English soldier floated under the bridge in a barrel and thrust his spear through the planks, mortally wounding the axeman.

King Stephen of England famously used a Danish axe at the Battle of Lincoln 1141. While one account says after his sword broke, another says he used his sword only after his axe broke.

Richard the Lionheart was often recorded in Victorian times wielding a large war axe, though references are sometimes wildly exaggerated as befitted a national hero:

Richard is, however, recorded as using a Danish Axe at the relief of Jaffa. Geoffrey of Lusignan is another famous crusader associated with the axe.

Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, famously killed Henry de Bohun at the Battle of Bannockburn with a single blow of his axe. The blow was so powerful it split de Bohun&#x27;s helmet and skull open and snapped the shaft of the axe. Depictions of the axe show a standard battle axe, however, not a Dane Axe.

In the 14th century, the use of axes is increasingly noted by Froissart in his Chronicle, with King John II using one at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 and Sir James Douglas at the Battle of Otterburn in 1388. Bretons were apparently noted axe users, with Bertrand du Guesclin and Olivier de Clisson both wielding axes in battle. In these cases, it is uncertain whether the weapon was a Danish axe, or the proto-pollaxe.

<doc id="1039706" wikidata="Q353275" url="?curid=1039706" title="German wine classification">
<text>The German wine classification system puts a strong emphasis on standardization and factual completeness, and was first implemented by the German Wine Law of 1971. Nearly all of Germany&#x27;s vineyards are delineated and registered as one of approximately 2,600 Einzellagen (&#x27;individual sites&#x27;), and the produce from any vineyard can be used to make German wine at any quality level, as long as the must weight of the grapes reaches the designated minimum level. As the current German system does not classify vineyards by quality, the measure of wine ’quality’ is the ripeness of the grapes alone.

Approximately 200 wine makers have been organised since 1910 in the Verband Deutscher Prädikatsweingüter (VDP). To counter the shortcomings of the 1971 law, the VDP nowadays classifies the best vineyards by its own rules into &#x27;VDP.Grosse Lage&#x27; (Grand cru) and &#x27;VDP.Erste Lage&#x27; (Premier cru) based on 19th century Prussian tax maps. Most of these wine makers are based in the regions of Mosel, Pfalz, and Franken.

The classification of wines has been reorganized since 1 August 2009 by the EU wine market organization. The traditional German wine classification remained mostly unchanged, as the European system follows the origin-related system like in Germany and most areas of France (AOC). The already existing protection of geographical indication was transmitted through this step as well to the wine classification.

==Quality designations==

There are two major categories of German wine: table and &quot;quality&quot; wine. Table wine includes the designations &quot;Deutscher Wein&quot; (previously Tafelwein) and &quot;Landwein&quot;. Unlike the supposed equivalents of &quot;Vin de Table&quot; / &quot;Vino da Tavola&quot; and &quot;Indicazione Geografica Tipica&quot; / &quot;Vin de Pays&quot;, production levels are not high, and these wines are typically exported to the United States. In 2005, Tafelwein and Landwein only accounted for 3.6% of total production. In Baden, there is a growing trend to release high-end wines as Landwein .

Quality wine is divided into two types: 

;&quot;Qualitätswein&quot;, or quality wine from a specific region.
:This is wine from one of the 13 wine-growing regions (&quot;Anbaugebiete&quot;), and the region must be shown on the label. It is a basic level of everyday, mostly inexpensive quaffing wines. The grapes are at a fairly low level of ripeness, with must weights of 51°Oe to 72°Oe. The alcohol content of the wine must be at least 7% by volume, and chaptalization (adding sugar to the unfermented grape juice to boost the final alcohol level, which in no way alters the sweetness) is often used. Qualitätswein range from dry to semi-sweet, and the style is often indicated on the label, along with the designation &quot;Qualitätswein&quot; and the region. Some top-level dry wines are officially Qualitätswein although they would qualify as Prädikatswein. All dry wines produced by members of the VDP association are always declared as Qualitätswein.

;&quot;Prädikatswein&quot;, or superior quality wine.
: Known as &quot;Qualitätswein mit Prädikat&quot; (QmP) (quality wine with specific attributes) until August 2007, this is the top level of German wines. These prominently display a Prädikat (ripeness level designation) on the label and may not be chaptalized. Prädikatswein range from dry to intensely sweet, but unless it is specifically indicated that the wine is dry or off-dry, these wines always contain a noticeable amount of residual sugar. Prädikatswein must be produced from allowed varieties in one of the 39 subregions (&quot;Bereich&quot;) of one of the 13 wine-growing regions, although it is the region rather than the subregion which is mandatory information on the label. (Some of the smaller regions, such as Rheingau, consist of only one subregion.)

The different Prädikat (superior quality wine) designations used are as follows, in order of increasing sugar levels in the must: 

;Kabinett – literally &quot;cabinet&quot;
: fully ripened light wines from the main harvest, typically semi-sweet with crisp acidity, but can be dry if designated so. This term may have originated as indicating the winemaker felt it was good enough to put in his own cabinet rather than offer it for sale.
;Spätlese – meaning &quot;late harvest&quot;
: typically half-dry, often (but not always) sweeter and fruitier than Kabinett. The grapes are picked at least 7 days after normal harvest, so they are riper. While waiting to pick the grapes carries a risk of the crop being ruined by rain, in warm years and from good sites much of the harvest can reach Spätlese level. Spätlese can be a relatively full-bodied dry wine if designated so. While Spätlese means late harvest the wine is not as sweet as a dessert wine, as the &quot;late harvest&quot; term is often used in US wines.
;Auslese – meaning &quot;select harvest&quot;
: made from very ripe, hand selected bunches, typically semi-sweet or sweet, sometimes with some noble rot character. Sometimes Auslese is also made into a powerful dry wine, but the designation Auslese trocken has been discouraged after the introduction of Grosses Gewächs. Auslese is the Prädikat which covers the widest range of wine styles, and can be a dessert wine.
;Beerenauslese – meaning &quot;select berry harvest&quot;
: made from overripe grapes individually selected from bunches and often affected by noble rot, making rich sweet dessert wine.
;Trockenbeerenauslese – meaning &quot;select dry berry harvest&quot; or &quot;dry berry selection&quot;
: made from selected overripe shrivelled grapes often affected by noble rot making extremely rich sweet wines. &quot;Trocken&quot; in this phrase refers to the grapes being dried on the vine rather than the resulting wine being a dry style.
;Eiswein (ice wine)
: made from grapes that have been naturally frozen on the vine, making a very concentrated wine. Must reach at least the same level of sugar content in the must as a Beerenauslese. The most classic Eiswein style is to use only grapes that are not affected by noble rot. Until the 1980s, the Eiswein designation was used in conjunction with another Prädikat (which indicated the ripeness level of the grapes before they had frozen), but is now considered a Prädikat of its own.
The minimum must weight requirements for the different Prädikat designations are as follows. Many producers, especially top-level producers, exceed the minimum requirements by a wide margin.

This does not necessarily determine the sweetness of the final wine, because the winemaker may choose to ferment the wine fully or let some residual sugar remain.

==Special designations==

In certain regions, additional rules are applied to how a wine is classified. These special names represent special characters.

===Sweetness of the wine===

The sugar content in the finished wine can be indicated by the following designations for Qualitätswein and Prädikatswein. For sparkling wines (Sekt), many of the same designations are used, but have a different meaning.

===Color===

There are also color designations that can be used on the label:

; Weißwein – white wine
:May be produced only from white varieties. This designation is seldom used.
; Rotwein – red wine
:May be produced only from red varieties with sufficient maceration to make the wine red. Sometimes used for clarification if the producer also makes rosés from the same grape variety.
;Roséwein – rosé wine
:Produced from red varieties with a shorter maceration, the wine must have pale red or clear red color. 
;Weißherbst – rosé wine or &quot;blanc de noirs&quot;
:A rosé wine which must conform to special rules: must be Qualitätswein or Prädikatswein, single variety and be labelled with the varietal name. There are no restrictions as to the color of the wine, so they range from pale gold to deep pink. Weißherbst wines also range from dry to sweet, such as rosé Eiswein from Spätburgunder.

===Extra ripeness or higher quality===

Some producers also use additional propriate designations to denote quality or ripeness level within a Prädikat. These are outside the scope of the German wine law. Especially for Auslese, which can cover a wide range of sweetness levels, the presence of any of these designations tends to indicate a sweet dessert wine rather than a semi-sweet wine. These designations are all unregulated.

; Goldkapsel – gold capsule
:A golden capsule or foil on the bottle. Denotes a wine considered better by the producer. Usually means a Prädikatswein that is sweeter or more intense, or indicates an auction wine made in a very small lot.
; Stars *, ** or ***
:Usually means that a Prädikatswein has been harvested at a higher level of ripeness than the minimum required, and can mean that the wine is sweeter or more intense.
; Fuder (vat) numbers
:Usually indicated for better wines and often the numbers are arranged in some logical order, although the same numbers need not return in each vintage. This practice seems to be most common for semi-sweet and sweet wines in the Mosel region.

===Special and regional wine types===

There are also a number of specialty and regional wines, considered as special version of some quality category. Here are some of them:

;Liebfraumilch or Liebfrauenmilch
: A semi-sweet Qualitätswein from the Rheingau, Nahe, Rheinhessen or Pfalz, consisting at least 70% of the varieties Riesling, Müller-Thurgau, Silvaner or Kerner. In practice there is very little Riesling in Liebfraumilch since varietally labelled Riesling wines tend to fetch a higher price. Liebfraumilch may not carry a varietal designation on the label. Liebfraumilch is one of Germany&#x27;s most well known wines, and is in principle a medium-quality wine designation although more commonly perceived to be a low-quality wine both at home and on the export market.
;Moseltaler
: An off-dry/semi-sweet Qualitätswein cuvée from the Mosel wine region (&quot;Moseltal&quot; is Moselle Valley in German) made from the following white grape varieties: Riesling, Müller-Thurgau, Elbling and Kerner. May not carry a varietal designation on the label, and sold under a uniform logotype. Must have a residual sugar of 15–30 grams per liter and a minimum acidity of 7 grams per liter. Basically a Liebfraumilch-lookalike from Mosel.
;Rotling
: A wine produced from a mixture of red and white varieties. A Rotling must have pale red or clear red color
;Schillerwein
: A Rotling from the Württemberg wine-growing region, which must be Qualitätswein or Prädikatswein.
;Badisch Rotgold
: A Rotling from the Baden wine-growing region, which must be Qualitätswein or Prädikatswein. It must be made from Grauburgunder and Spätburgunder and the varieties must be specified on the label.

===New classes for wines===

There are two classes for wines with official status in all 13 Anbaugebiete and one regional class in Rheinhessen and the Rheingau, respectively.

;Classic
: Introduced with the 2000 vintage, Classic is in principle a dry or slightly off-dry Qualitätswein that conforms to slightly higher standards intended to make it food-friendly. It must be made from varieties considered classical in its region, have a potential alcohol of 1% (or 8°Oe) above the minimum requirements for its variety and region, and have an alcohol level of minimum 12.0% by volume, except in Mosel, where the minimum level is 11.5%. Maximum sugar level is twice the acid level, but no more than 15 grams per liter.
;Riesling Hochgewächs
: Literally meaning ”high growth”. A riesling with a natural alcohol level at least 1.5 percentage points above the minimum Qualitätswein requirement for the Anbaugebiet. Additionally, the wine has to score an average of at least 3 points in the official wine examination (&quot;Amtliche Weinprüfung).&quot;

;Selection Rheinhessen
: A wine made from hand-picked, fully ripe grapes (min. 90° Oechsle) originating in a single vineyard in Rheinhessen. The grapes have to be typical to the region (Silvaner, Riesling, Weißburgunder, Grauburgunder, Gewürztraminer, Portugieser, Frühburgunder or Spätburgunder) and the wine must pass a sensory test.

;Rheingau Großes Gewächs
: Literally meaning ”Rheingau great growth”. Limited to the Rheingau region through the state wine decree of Hessia, a legally dry riesling (min. 12% alc.) or spätburgunder (min. 13% alc.) from classified vineyard sites. The wine must pass a tasting test by the review board. Replaces the &quot;Erstes Gewächs&quot; designation starting from the 2018 vintage and is stylized as RGG on the wine label.

;Charta Riesling 
: a 100% Rheingau Riesling of Qualitätswein or Prädikatswein quality with a residual sugar ranging from 9–18 grams/liter (off-dry) and a minimum acidity of 7.5 grams/liter. The wines must achieve higher starting must weights than required by law and undergo sensory testing by a special panel (in addition to the A.P.Nr. procedure). Uniform packaging.

==Geographic classification==
The geographic classification is different for Landwein, Deutscher Wein, Qualitätswein and Prädikatswein.

===Geographic classification for Deutscher Wein (formerly Tafelwein) and Landwein===

There are seven Deutscher Wein regions: Rhein-Mosel, Bayern, Neckar, Oberrhein, Albrechtsburg, Stargarder Land and Niederlausitz. These are divided into a number of subregions, which in turn are divided into 19 Landwein regions (and must be trocken or halbtrocken in style). (There is no Landwein region for Franken.) Names of individual vineyards are not used for Deutscher Wein or Landwein. Deutscher Wein must be 100% German in origin, or specifically state on the label where grapes were sourced from within the European Union. Sparkling wine produced at the Deutscher Wein level is often labeled as Deutscher Sekt and is made from 100% German grapes/wine.

===Geographic classification for Qualitätswein and Prädikatswein===

There are four levels of geographic classification, and any level of classification can be used on the label of Qualitätswein and Prädikatswein:

* &quot;Anbaugebiet&quot;, wine growing regions, of which there are 13. Anbaugebiet is always indicated on the label of Qualitätswein and Prädikatswein.
* &quot;Bereich&quot;, district, of which there are 39. Each Anbaugebiet is divided into one or more Bereiche.
* &quot;Großlage&quot;, collective site, which is a collective name for a number of single vineyards, and which number about 170.
* &quot;Einzellage&quot;, single vineyard, of which there are about 2,600.

The names of Großlagen and Einzellagen are always used together with the name of a wine village, because some Einzellage names, such as &quot;Schlossberg&quot; (castle hill) are used in several villages. Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell a Großlage from an Einzellage just by looking at the wine label. A few examples of how the names appear on labels:

* The vineyard Sonnenuhr (meaning &quot;sun dial&quot;) in the village Wehlen along the Mosel is designated as Wehlener Sonnenuhr.
* The neighbouring village Zeltingen also has a vineyard called Sonnenuhr, and will appear on the label as Zeltinger Sonnenuhr.
* Both these vineyards belong to Großlage Münzlay, which is assigned to the village Wehlen. A wine from any of these vineyards, or a blend from both of them, can be sold under the name Wehlener Münzlay.
* These vineyards lie within Bereich Bernkastel, which provides an additional choice for labelling.
* It is also possible to simply label the wine as a wine from Anbaugebiet Mosel.

There are a few exceptions to the rule that a village must be indicated together with the vineyard name, those are a handful of historical vineyards known as &quot;Ortsteil im sinne des Weingesetzes&quot; (village name in sense of the wine law). Examples are Schloss Johannisberg in Rheingau and Scharzhofberg along the Saar. They are of the same size as a typical Einzellage and could be thought of as Einzellagen which were so famous that they were excused from displaying the village name.

==Labels==
Unlike French wine labels, where key information about the grape variety is not included in the labeling and thus must be known by the consumer to make an informed choice, German wine labels must display much more important information about the wine. It must always include: 
# Geographic information with either the country, the city or the exact site of the wine (depending on the quality). 
# The variety of grape(s) used and whether the wine is mix of grapes (see: cuvée). 
# The EU law quality level of the wine. 
# The year of grape harvest. 
# Whether it is dry, semi-dry or sweet. 
# The wine maker. 
# If the wine is sparkling (sekt)
# Any other special information about the quality level. 
Due to the amount of information the label some non-professionals and many consumers find German wine labels to be harder to understand than French or US labels. Jon Bonné describes German wine labels as a &quot;thicket of exotic words and abbreviations&quot; that require &quot;the vinous equivalent of Cliff notes to parse.&quot;

===Required Information===
German wine law regulates that at least six items of information be present on the label.

*Name of the producer or bottler (&quot;e.g.: Staatsweingüter Kloster Eberbach&quot;)
German wine domaines/&quot;châteaux&quot; are often called &quot;Kloster&quot;, &quot;Schloss&quot;, &quot;Burg&quot;, &quot;Domaine&quot; or &quot;Weingut&quot; followed by some other name.

*A.P.Nr &quot;Amtliche Prüfnummer&quot; Quality control number (&quot;e.g.: 33050 031 04&quot;)

The first number (1–9) relates to the German wine region where the wine was produced and tested &quot;(e.g. 3-Rheingau)&quot;. The second 2 or 3 digit number indicates the village of the vineyard &quot;(e.g. 30-Rauenthal))&quot;. The next two digits represents the particular wine estate &quot;(e.g. 50-Kloster Eberbach)&quot;. The following 2 to 3 digit number is the sequential order that the wine was submitted by that producer for testing &quot;(e.g. 031 – this was the 31st wine submitted by Kloster Eberbach for testing)&quot;. The final two digits is the year of the testing, which is normally the year following the vintage &quot;(e.g. 04 – the wine was tested in 2004)&quot;.

*&quot;Anbaugebiet&quot;, i.e. region of origin (&quot;e.g.: Rheingau&quot;)
*Volume of the wine &quot;(e.g.: 750ml&quot;)
*Location of the producer/bottler (&quot;e.g.: Eltville&quot;)
*Alcohol level (&quot;e.g.: 9.0% vol&quot;)

===Additional information===
German wine labels may also include
*Grape variety (e.g., Riesling)
*Prädikat level of ripeness (e.g., &quot;Spätlese&quot;)
*Vintage year (e.g., 2003)
*Taste, such as dry (&quot;trocken&quot;) or off-dry (&quot;halbtrocken&quot;)
*Vineyard name (&quot;e.g.: Rauenthaler Baiken&quot;, a single vineyard)&quot;. The village name (&quot;e.g.: Rauenthal&quot;) is normally identified by the possessive form &quot;-er&quot; suffix and is sometimes followed by the vineyard name (&quot;Baiken&quot;).
*If the wine is estate-bottled (&quot;Erzeugerabfüllung&quot; or &quot;Gutsabfüllung&quot;), bottled by a co-op (&quot;Winzergenossenschaft&quot;), or by a third party bottler (&quot;Abfüller&quot;).
*Address of the winery
*The logo of the Association of German Prädikat Wine Estates (&quot;Verband Deutscher Prädikatsweingüter&quot;, or more commonly &quot;VDP&quot;) which is awarded to the top 200 producers, as voted among themselves. The logo is a black eagle with a cluster of grapes in the center. The winery in the image example has the VDP logo. While not a guarantee, the presence of the VDP logo is a helpful insight into the quality of the wine.

==Criticism==
In recent years, the official classification has been criticised by many of the top producers, and additional classifications have been set down by wine growers&#x27; organisations such as VDP, without enjoying legal protection. The two main reasons for criticism are that the official classification does not differentiate between better and lesser vineyards and that the quality levels are less appropriate to high-quality dry wines.

<doc id="1039719" wikidata="Q2146505" url="?curid=1039719" title="Kilbarchan">
<text>Kilbarchan (; ) is a village and civil parish in central Renfrewshire, in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. It is almost contiguous with Johnstone, about 5 miles or 8 km west of the centre of Paisley. The village&#x27;s name means &quot;cell (chapel) of St. Barchan&quot;. It is known for its former weaving industry.

== History ==

The village was once one of many weaving villages, and at one time had 800 handlooms. Its weavers were active in the Radical movement which sought parliamentary reform, notably the agitation of the so-called Radical War of 1820. One cottage named the &quot;Weavers Cottage&quot; and built in 1723 has been conserved by the National Trust for Scotland, with weaving still in operation, and guides who demonstrate handloom weaving.

Kilbarchan was the birthplace of Mary Barbour, the political activist who led the Glasgow rent strike of 1915 and later became Glasgow Corporation&#x27;s first woman councillor.

Kilbarchan was used as a location for the BBC TV show &quot;Dr. Finlay&#x27;s Casebook&quot; in the 1960s.

==Lilias Day==
The main annual event is Lilias Day, on the first Saturday of June, when hundreds of visitors watch the parade and join in the festivities. The earliest records of the event are in 1931, 1933 and 1934. Annual celebrations were restarted in 1968 by the Kilbarchan Primary School Parents Association. A main event of the day is a &quot;coming to life&quot; of the statue of Habbie Simpson (a famous village piper) on the steeple. The statue is covered by a flag for the day.

Inhabitants of Kilbarchan are informally known as &quot;Habbies&quot; after Habbie Simpson.

==Facilities==
Kilbarchan is the home of Kilbarchan Amateur Athletics Club, and contains a nursery, a primary school, a Girl Guiding Centre, a Scout Hall, a pipe band and two churches, Kilbarchan West and Kilbarchan East which are now a united church in the former East church campus. There are two village pubs, the Trust and Habbies which was formerly known as the Glenleven. The Trust has been in establishment since 1904. It is also the village&#x27;s source of live music on a Friday night.

==Transport==
Kilbarchan railway station opened on 1 June 1905, but closed to passengers on 27 June 1966. It now serves as the entrance to cycle track number seven. There are currently motions in the local transport authority to reopen the line. However, since the line closed, there has been much construction on the trackbed, including the A737 (Johnstone bypass); a Morrisons superstore on the site of ; and housing on the site of Lochwinnoch station.

==Notable people==
*Mary Nicol Neill Armour (1902–2000), artist
*Mary Barbour, political activist, was born here
*Campbell Douglas, architect, was born and raised here
*Maud Galt (c. 1620 – c. 1670), lesbian accused of witchcraft, lived here with her husband.
*Prof Thomas Gibson FRSE, professor of plastic surgery and bioengineering, born here
*Agnes Lyle, a ballad singer, lived here in 1825.
*Hugh McIver, recipient of the Victoria Cross

<doc id="1039721" wikidata="Q2889530" url="?curid=1039721" title="Mike Magee (soccer)">
<text>Michael Magee (born September 2, 1984) is an American former soccer player who last played for LA Galaxy in Major League Soccer as a forward. In the 2013 season with the Chicago Fire, Magee scored 21 goals and was named the MLS MVP.

==Club career==
===MetroStars===

Magee graduated from USSF&#x27;s Bradenton Academy he entered the 2003 MLS SuperDraft, where the MetroStars traded the previous year&#x27;s third overall selection, Brad Davis, to acquire Magee with the fourth overall pick.

With Metro coach Bob Bradley familiar with Magee from his youth soccer days, the youngster quickly stepped into the Metro lineup, and played every game of the 2003 season except the meaningless finale. He became the youngest player in team history to start a game and score a goal. He scored seven goals, nearing the rookie record, which included a couple of game-winning and game-tying efforts.

When the MetroStars signed a trio of foreign strikers before the 2004 season, Magee struggled for playing time early on. But he soon found a new niche as an attacking midfielder, as his skill on the ball, leadership, precise passing, and overall intelligence made him an important part of the Metro team. Magee ended up with three goals on the season, one of them in the 90th minute to give the Metros a 2–1 win over Los Angeles Galaxy. He scored five in 2005, adding five assists. Magee followed that with three goals in an injury-filled 2006. Magee&#x27;s injury woes continued in 2007 as he was limited to 7 league matches. The 2008 season saw Magee receive significant playing time as an attacking midfielder, but it was apparent that he was not fully recovered from his injuries. He was then moved to his natural forward position and had a resurgence as he scored in 3 consecutive matches, helping the club to three straight wins. He ended the 2008 season scoring five key goals, helping the club reach the MLS Playoffs.

===LA Galaxy===

Magee was traded to Los Angeles Galaxy in January 2009 in exchange for a 2nd round pick in the 2010 MLS SuperDraft. In his first season with Los Angeles, Magee appeared in 23 league matches scoring 2 goals. During the 2009 MLS Cup Playoffs Magee started all 4 of the team&#x27;s playoff matches scoring two goals in helping lead the club to the MLS Cup Final. At the MLS 2009 Cup Final Magee scored the Galaxy&#x27;s only goal but the team ended up losing during an overtime penalty shoot out.

Magee made his first professional appearance as a goalkeeper on June 25, 2011, moving to the position in the 43rd minute of a match against San Jose Earthquakes, after starting goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts was injured and reserve goalkeeper Josh Saunders received a red card for an elbow to the face of Steven Lenhart. Magee made 4 saves, including a late stop on a 1-v-1 against Lenhart, preserving a clean sheet for the Galaxy in a 0–0 draw. It was the first time Magee had played in goal at any level of soccer. Magee had his most productive season during the 2011 campaign scoring 10 goals in all competitions for the Galaxy including 3 in the MLS playoffs, helping the Galaxy to capture the 2011 MLS Cup.

Magee has become LA&#x27;s &quot;Mr. November&quot; due to his repeated ability to deliver goals and in form clutch performances in the post-season, having scored 8 goals in his 15 playoff matches for the team.

===Chicago Fire===

On May 24, 2013, Magee was traded to Chicago Fire for the MLS rights to Robbie Rogers. He made an immediate impact with the club, scoring 7 goals in his first 7 matches across all competitions. He won the June Player of the Month Award. The Fire missed the playoffs by three goals and Magee lost to Camilo Sanvezzo for the MLS Golden Boot. Camilo had 22 goals and 6 assists, while Magee had 21 goals and 4 assists. On November 20, Magee along with Robbie Keane and Marco Di Vaio, was nominated for the MVP Award. On December 5, he was named the MVP of MLS. Magee became the first Chicago Fire player ever to win the award.

In September 2014, Magee underwent a right hip surgery to address an injury of the labrum and to repair articular surface damage. He would miss eight months due to recovery. In May 2015, Magee was loaned to Chicago&#x27;s USL affiliate, Saint Louis FC, to begin his on-field recovery from this injury.

===Return to LA Galaxy===
On January 14, 2016, the Galaxy announced that Magee would return after he became a free-agent.

==International career==
Magee has spent time with various U.S. youth national Teams. He played in the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship in the United Arab Emirates, scoring the game-winner against Paraguay.

In November 2013, Republic of Ireland national team captain Robbie Keane revealed that he would recommend Magee to Martin O&#x27;Neill as a possible call-up.

Magee was called up by Jürgen Klinsmann for the 2014 January Camp. However, he was left out of the lineup on February 1 against South Korea due to food poisoning.

==Personal life==
Magee spent some of his earliest years living in Elmhurst, Illinois before moving away, and has lived considerable time in South Barrington. He played AYSO; one year, his team name was the &quot;Green Slimers&quot;.

Magee and his wife, Kristen Pizzolato were married in 2012, had a daughter in 2010 and a son in 2015.

In 2018, Magee became the owner of Sneaky Fox Spirits and Sneaky Clean Hand Sanitizer in 2020.

<text>A spontoon, sometimes known by the variant spelling espontoon or as a half-pike, is a type of European polearm that came into being alongside the pike. The spontoon was in common use from the mid-17th century to the early 19th century, but it was used to a much lesser extent as a military weapon and ceremonial implement until the late 19th century.

==Description==
Unlike the pike, which was a very long weapon that was typically long, the spontoon on the other hand was much shorter and only measured around in overall length. Generally, this weapon featured a more elaborate head than the typical pike. The head of a spontoon often had a pair of blades or lugs on each side, giving the weapon the look of a military fork or a trident. There were also spontoon-style axes which used the same shaped blades mounted on the side of the weapon with a shorter haft.

Italians might have been the first to use the spontoon, and, in its early days, the weapon was used for combat, before it became more of a symbolic item.

After the bayonet and musket replaced the pike and arquebus as the primary weapons of the common foot soldier, the spontoon remained in use as a signalling weapon. In the British army commissioned officers carried the spontoon until 1786 as a symbol of their rank and used it like a mace, in order to issue battlefield commands to their men, whilst sergeants generally carried the halberd until 1792 when it was replaced by the &quot;sergeant&#x27;s pike&quot;, a spontoon. British Army officers used spontoons at the Battle of Culloden.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the spontoon was used by sergeants to defend the colours of a battalion or regiment from a cavalry attack. The spontoon was one of few polearms that stayed in use long enough to make it into American history. As late as the 1890s, the spontoon accompanied marching soldiers.

The American Militia Acts of 1792 specified that commissioned officers were to be armed with an espontoon. Lewis and Clark brought spontoons on their expedition with the Corps of Discovery. The weapons came in handy as backup arms when the Corps travelled through areas populated by large bears. Today, a spontoon (or espontoon, as it is referred to in the manual of arms) is carried by the drum major of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Fife and Drum Corps, a ceremonial unit of the 3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard).

<text>The Parliament Act 1911 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5. c. 13) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is constitutionally important and partly governs the relationship between the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two Houses of Parliament. The Parliament Act 1949 provides that the Parliament Act 1911 and the Parliament Act 1949 are to be construed together &quot;as one&quot; in their effects and that the two acts may be cited together as the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. 

The act effectively removed the right of the House of Lords to veto money bills completely, and replaced its right of veto over other public bills with the ability to delay them for a maximum of two years (the Parliament Act 1949 reduced this to one). It also reduced the maximum term of a parliament from seven years (as set by the Septennial Act 1716) to five.

Following the House of Lords&#x27; rejection of the 1909 People&#x27;s Budget, the House of Commons sought to establish its formal dominance over the House of Lords, which had broken convention in opposing the bill. The budget was eventually passed by the Lords, after the Commons&#x27; democratic mandate was confirmed by holding a general election in January 1910. The following Parliament Act, which looked to prevent a recurrence of the budget problems, was also widely opposed in the House of Lords, and cross-party discussion failed, particularly because of the proposed act&#x27;s applicability to the passage of an Irish Home Rule Bill. Following a second general election in December, the act was passed with the assent of the monarch, George V, after the House of Lords conceded due to the government&#x27;s threat that the Conservative majority in the Lords could be overcome by creating many new Liberal peers.

==Background==

Until the Parliament Act 1911, there was no way to resolve disagreements between the two houses of Parliament except through the creation of additional peers by the monarch. Queen Anne had created twelve Tory peers to vote through the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The Reform Act 1832 had been passed when the House of Lords dropped their opposition to it: King William IV had threatened to create eighty new peers by request of the prime minister, Earl Grey. This created an informal convention that the Lords would give way when the public was behind the House of Commons. For example, Irish disestablishment, which had been a major point of contention between the two main parties since the 1830s, was passed by the Lords in 1869 after Queen Victoria intervened and W. E. Gladstone won the 1868 election on the issue. However, in practice, this gave the Lords a right to demand that such public support be present and to decide the timing of a general election.

It was the prevailing wisdom that the House of Lords could not amend money bills, since only the House of Commons had the right to decide upon the resources the monarch could call upon. This did not, however, prevent it from rejecting such bills outright. In 1860, with the repeal of the paper duties, all money bills were consolidated into a single budget. This denied the Lords the ability to reject individual components, and the prospect of voting down the entire budget was seemingly unpalatable. It was only in 1909 that this possibility became a reality. Prior to the act, the Lords had had rights equal to those of the Commons over legislation but, by convention, did not utilise its right of veto over financial measures.

There had been an overwhelming Conservative-Liberal Unionist majority in the Lords since the Liberal split in 1886. With the Liberal Party attempting to push through significant welfare reforms with considerable popular support, problems seemed certain to arise in the relationship between the houses. Between 1906 and 1909, several important measures were considerably watered down or rejected outright: for example, Augustine Birrell introduced the Education Bill 1906, which was intended to address nonconformist grievances arising from the Education Act 1902, but it was amended by the Lords to such an extent that it effectively became a different bill, whereupon the Commons dropped it. This led to a resolution in the House of Commons on 26 June 1907, put forward by Liberal Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman, declaring that the Lords&#x27; power ought to be curtailed. In 1909, hoping to force an election, the Lords rejected the financial bill based on the government budget (the &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot;) put forward by David Lloyd George, by 350 votes to 75. This action, according to the Commons, was &quot;a breach of the constitution and a usurpation of the rights of the Commons&quot;. The Lords suggested that the Commons demonstrate at the polls the veracity of its claim that the bill represented the will of the people. The Liberal government sought to do so through the January 1910 general election. Liberal representation in the House of Commons fell steeply, but the party retained a majority with the help of a significant number of Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) and Labour MPs. The IPP saw the continued power of the Lords as detrimental to the prospect of securing Irish Home Rule. Following the election, the Lords relented on the budget (which had been reintroduced by the government), and it passed the Lords on 28 April, a day after the Commons vote.

==Passage==

The Lords was now faced with the prospect of a Parliament Act, which had considerable support from the Irish Nationalists. A series of meetings between the Liberal government and Unionist opposition members was agreed. Twenty-one such meetings were held between 16 June and 10 November. The discussions considered a wide range of proposals, with initial agreement on finance bills and on a joint sitting of the Commons and the Lords as a means by which to enforce Commons superiority in controversial areas; the number of members of the Lords present would be limited so that a Liberal majority of fifty or more in the House of Commons could overrule the Lords. However, the issue of home rule for Ireland was the main contention, with Unionists looking to exempt such a law from the Parliament Act procedure by means of a general exception for &quot;constitutional&quot; or &quot;structural&quot; bills. The Liberals supported an exception for bills relating to the monarchy and Protestant succession, but not home rule. On 10 November, the discussions were declared to have failed.

The government threatened another dissolution if the Parliament Act were not passed, and followed through on their threat when opposition in the Lords did not diminish. The December 1910 general election produced little change from January. The second dissolution of Parliament now seems to have been contrary to the wishes of Edward VII. Edward had died in May 1910 while the crisis was still in progress. His successor, George V, was asked if he would be prepared to create sufficient peers, which he would only do if the matter arose. This would have meant creating over 400 new Liberal peers. The King, however, demanded that the bill would have to be rejected at least once by the Lords before his intervention. Two amendments made by the Lords were rejected by the Commons, and opposition to the bill showed little sign of reducing. This led H. H. Asquith to declare the King&#x27;s intention to overcome the majority in the House of Lords by creating sufficient new peers. The bill was finally passed in the Lords on 11 August 1911, by 131 votes to 114, a majority of 17. This reflected a large number of abstentions.

==Provisions==
At the request of prominent Cabinet member Sir Edward Grey, the preamble included the words: 

The long title of the act was &quot;An Act to make provision with respect to the powers of the House of Lords in relation to those of the House of Commons, and to limit the duration of Parliament.&quot; Section 8 defined the short title as the &quot;Parliament Act 1911&quot;.

The bill was also an attempt to place the relationship between the House of Commons and House of Lords on a new footing. As well as the direct issue of money Bills, it set new conventions about how the power the Lords continued to hold would be used. It did not change the composition of the Lords, however.

The Lords would only be able to delay money bills for one month, effectively ending their ability to do so. These were defined as any public bill which contained only provisions dealing with the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; and the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof. But it did not cover any sort of local taxes or similar measures. Some finance bills have not fallen within this criterion; Consolidated Fund and Appropriation bills have. The Speaker of the House of Commons would have to certify that a bill was a money bill, endorsing it with a Speaker&#x27;s certificate. The Local Government Finance Act 1988, which introduced the Community Charge (&quot;Poll Tax&quot;), was not certified as a money bill and was therefore considered by the Lords. Whilst finance bills are not considered money bills, convention dictates that those parts of a finance bill dealing with taxation or expenditure (which, if in an act alone, would constitute a money bill) are not questioned.

Other public bills could no longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that legislation introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker also has to certify that the conditions of the bill have been complied with. There are significant restrictions on amendments to ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.

Parliament had been limited to a maximum of seven years under the Septennial Act 1716, but the Parliament Act 1911 amended the Septennial Act to limit Parliament to five years, reckoned from the first meeting of Parliament after the election. In practice, no election was absolutely forced by that limitation; until the Septennial Act was repealed by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, all parliaments were dissolved by the monarch under the royal prerogative on request of the Prime Minister. The five-year maximum duration in the amended Septennial Act referred to the lifetime of the parliament, and not to the interval between general elections. For example, the 2010 general election was held five years and one day after the 2005 general election; the 1992 general election was held on 9 April 1992 and the next general election was not held until 1 May 1997. The reduction in the maximum length of a parliament was seen as a counterbalance to the new powers granted to the Commons. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, in contrast, called for general elections every five years (unless called sooner, as in 2017), and provided for an earlier dissolution of Parliament only by certain specified legal procedures. The act was repealed in 2022, restoring the previous system of dissolution under the royal prerogative.

==Result==
The Lords continued to suggest amendments to money bills over which it had no right of veto; and in several instances these were accepted by the Commons. These included the China Indemnity Bill 1925 and the Inshore Fishing Industry Bill 1947. The use of the Lords&#x27; now temporary veto remains a powerful check on legislation.

It was used in relation to the Government of Ireland Act 1914, which had been under the threat of a Lords veto, now removed. Ulster Protestants had been firmly against the passing of the bill. However, the Government of Ireland Act 1914 never came into force because of the outbreak of the First World War. Amendments to the Parliament Act 1911 were made to prolong the life of the 1910 parliament following the outbreak of the First World War, and also that of the 1935 parliament due to the Second World War. These made special exemptions to the requirement to hold a general election every five years.

Legislation passed without the consent of the Lords, under the provisions of the Parliament Act, is still considered primary legislation, i.e. a fully valid act of Parliament. The importance of this was highlighted in &quot;Jackson v Attorney General&quot;, in which the lawfulness of the Parliament Act 1949 was questioned. The challenge asserted that the Parliament Act 1911 had delegated power from Parliament as a whole to the Commons, and that the Parliament Act 1949 was therefore delegated rather than primary legislation. If this were the case, then the House of Commons could not further increase its own powers through the Parliament Act 1949 without direct permission from the House of Lords. Since it was passed under the 1911 act, the 1949 act had never received the required consent of the Lords. However, the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords found that the 1911 act was not primarily about empowering the Commons, but rather had the purpose of restricting the ability of the Lords to reject legislation, i.e. altering the process by which Parliament as a whole enacts legislation. The 1949 act had therefore been lawfully enacted. This ruling also appears to mean that efforts to abolish the House of Lords (a major constitutional change) by using the act could be successful, although the issue was not directly addressed in the ruling.

==Analysis==
The Parliament Act 1911 can be seen in the context of the British constitution: rather than creating a written constitution, Parliament chose instead to legislate through the usual channels in response to the crisis. This was a pragmatic response, which avoided the further problems of codifying unwritten rules and reconstructing the entire government. It is commonly considered a statute of &quot;constitutional importance&quot;, which gives it informal priority in Parliament and in the courts with regard to whether later legislation can change it and the process by which this may happen.

It is also mentioned in discussion of constitutional convention. While it replaced conventions regarding the role of the House of Lords, it also relies on several others. Section 1(1) only makes sense if money bills do not arise in the House of Lords, and the provisions in section 2(1) only if proceedings on a public bill are completed in a single session, otherwise they must fail and be put through procedure again.

<text>Brookfield is a small dormitory village in west central Renfrewshire, Scotland. It lies on the north of the A761 road, which runs through a number of towns and villages to join Port Glasgow and the city of Glasgow, via Paisley, and is roughly equidistant to the nearby settlements of Houston, Bridge of Weir, Kilbarchan, Johnstone and Linwood.

==History==
The village was effectively founded in the late 19th century from what was previously farmland. It continued to grow at a steady rate from this point onwards, and now includes some 200 houses – making it possibly Renfrewshire&#x27;s smallest village.

Brookfield was also home to Donald J Malcolm (1925-2003), founder of The Malcolm Group, a significant haulage contractor whose fleet carried the Brookfield name.

The village was also home to Merchiston Hospital. After the demolition of the hospital buildings in 2013, the site was converted into a large housing estate, significantly increasing the size of the village.

==Governance==
For elections to Renfrewshire Council, Brookfield forms part of Ward 9 (Houston, Crosslee and Linwood).

<text>Two nuclides are isotones if they have the same neutron number &quot;N&quot;, but different proton number &quot;Z&quot;. For example, boron-12 and carbon-13 nuclei both contain 7 neutrons, and so are isotones. Similarly, 36S, 37Cl, 38Ar, 39K, and 40Ca nuclei are all isotones of 20 because they all contain 20 neutrons. Despite its similarity to the Greek for &quot;same stretching&quot;, the term was formed by the German physicist K. Guggenheimer by changing the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;isotope&quot; from &quot;p&quot; for &quot;proton&quot; to &quot;n&quot; for &quot;neutron&quot;.

The largest numbers of observationally stable nuclides exist for isotones 50 (five: 86Kr, 88Sr, 89Y, 90Zr, 92Mo – noting also the primordial radionuclide 87Rb) and 82 (six: 138Ba, 139La, 140Ce, 141Pr, 142Nd, 144Sm – noting also the primordial radionuclide 136Xe). Neutron numbers for which there are no stable isotones are 19, 21, 35, 39, 45, 61, 89, 115, 123, and 127 or more (though 21, 142, 143, 146, and perhaps 150 have primordial radionuclides). In contrast, the proton numbers for which there are no stable isotopes are 43, 61, and 83 or more (83, 90, 92, and perhaps 94 have primordial radionuclides). This is related to nuclear magic numbers, the number of nucleons forming complete shells within the nucleus, e.g. 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. No more than one observationally stable nuclide has the same odd neutron number, except for 1 (2H and 3He), 5 (9Be and 10B), 7 (13C and 14N), 55 (97Mo and 99Ru), and 107 (179Hf and 180mTa). In contrast, all even neutron numbers from 6 to 124, except 84 and 86, have at least two observationally stable nuclides. Neutron numbers for which there is a stable nuclide and a primordial radionuclide are 27 (50V), 65 (113Cd), 81 (138La), 84 (144Nd), 85 (147Sm), 86 (148Sm), 105 (176Lu), and 126 (209Bi). Neutron numbers for which there are two primordial radionuclides are 88 (151Eu and 152Gd) and 112 (187Re and 190Pt).

The neutron numbers which have only one stable nuclide (compare: monoisotopic element for the proton numbers) are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 51, 53, 57, 59, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 109, 111, 113, 117, 119, 121, 125, 126, and the neutron numbers which have only one significant naturally-abundant nuclide (compare: mononuclidic element for the proton numbers) are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 21, 23, 25, 29, 31, 33, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 51, 53, 57, 59, 63, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 83, 87, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 109, 111, 113, 117, 119, 121, 125, 142, 143, 146.

*Isotopes are nuclides having the same number of protons: e.g. carbon-12 and carbon-13.
*Isobars are nuclides having the same mass number (i.e. sum of protons plus neutrons): e.g. carbon-12 and boron-12.
*Nuclear isomers are different excited states of the same type of nucleus. A transition from one isomer to another is accompanied by emission or absorption of a gamma ray, or the process of internal conversion. (Not to be confused with chemical isomers.)

<doc id="1039739" wikidata="Q2803" url="?curid=1039739" title="Move-to-front transform">
<text>The move-to-front (MTF) transform is an encoding of data (typically a stream of bytes) designed to improve the performance of entropy encoding techniques of compression. When efficiently implemented, it is fast enough that its benefits usually justify including it as an extra step in data compression algorithm.

This algorithm was first published by Boris Ryabko under the name of &quot;book stack&quot; in 1980. Subsequently, it was rediscovered by J.K. Bentley et al. in 1986, as attested in the explanatory note.

==The transform==

The main idea is that each symbol in the data is replaced by its index in the stack of “recently used symbols”. For example, long sequences of identical symbols are replaced by as many zeroes, whereas when a symbol that has not been used in a long time appears, it is replaced with a large number. Thus at the end the data is transformed into a sequence of integers; if the data exhibits a lot of local correlations, then these integers tend to be small.

Let us give a precise description. Assume for simplicity that the symbols in the data are bytes.
Each byte value is encoded by its index in a list of bytes, which changes over the course of the algorithm. The list is initially in order by byte value (0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 255). Therefore, the first byte is always encoded by its own value. However, after encoding a byte, that value is moved to the front of the list before continuing to the next byte.

An example will shed some light on how the transform works. Imagine instead of bytes, we are encoding values in a–z. We wish to transform the following sequence:
 bananaaa
By convention, the list is initially (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz). The first letter in the sequence is b, which appears at index 1 (the list is indexed from 0 to 25). We put a 1 to the output stream:
 1
The b moves to the front of the list, producing (bacdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz). The next letter is a, which now appears at index 1. So we add a 1 to the output stream. We have:
 1,1
and we move the letter a back to the top of the list. Continuing this way, we find that the sequence is encoded by:
 1,1,13,1,1,1,0,0

It is easy to see that the transform is reversible. Simply maintain the same list and decode by replacing each index in the encoded stream with the letter at that index in the list. Note the difference between this and the encoding method: The index in the list is used directly instead of looking up each value for its index.

i.e. you start again with (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz). You take the &quot;1&quot; of the encoded block and look it up in the list, which results in &quot;b&quot;. Then move the &quot;b&quot; to front which results in (bacdef...). Then take the next &quot;1&quot;, look it up in the list, this results in &quot;a&quot;, move the &quot;a&quot; to front ... etc.

==Implementation==

Details of implementation are important for performance, particularly for decoding. For encoding, no clear advantage is gained by using a linked list, so using an array to store the list is acceptable, with worst-case performance O(nk), where n is the length of the data to be encoded and k is the number of values (generally a constant for a given implementation).

The typical performance is better because frequently-used symbols are more likely to be at the front and will produce earlier hits. This is also the idea behind a Move-to-front self-organizing list.

However, for decoding, we can use specialized data structures to greatly improve performance.

===Python===
This is a possible implementation of the move-to-front algorithm in Python.
from collections.abc import Generator, Iterable

class MoveToFront:
 »&gt; mtf = MoveToFront()
 »&gt; list(mtf.encode(&quot;Wikipedia&quot;))
 [87, 105, 107, 1, 112, 104, 104, 3, 102]
 »&gt; mtf.decode([87, 105, 107, 1, 112, 104, 104, 3, 102])
 &#x27;Wikipedia&#x27;
 »&gt; list(mtf.encode(&quot;wikipedia&quot;))
 [119, 106, 108, 1, 113, 105, 105, 3, 103]
 »&gt; mtf.decode([119, 106, 108, 1, 113, 105, 105, 3, 103])
 &#x27;wikipedia&#x27;
 def __init__(self, common_dictionary: Iterable[int] = range(256)):
 Instead of always transmitting an &quot;original&quot; dictionary,
 it is simpler to just agree on an initial set.
 Here we use the 256 possible values of a byte.
 # consume the iterable so it can be used multiple times
 self.common_dictionary = list(common_dictionary)

 def encode(self, plain_text: str) -&gt; Generator[int]:
 # Changing the common dictionary is a bad idea. Make a copy.
 dictionary = list(self.common_dictionary)

 # Read in each character
 for c in plain_text.encode(&quot;latin-1&quot;): # Change to bytes for 256.
 # Find the rank of the character in the dictionary [O(k)]
 rank = dictionary.index(c) # the encoded character
 yield rank

 # Update the dictionary [Θ(k) for insert]
 dictionary.pop(rank)
 dictionary.insert(0, c)

 def decode(self, compressed_data: Iterable[int]) -&gt; str:
 Inverse function that recover the original text
 dictionary = list(self.common_dictionary)
 plain_text = []

 # Read in each rank in the encoded text
 for rank in compressed_data:
 # Remove the character of that rank from the dictionary
 e = dictionary.pop(rank)
 plain_text.append(e)

 # Insert the character at the beginning of dictionary
 dictionary.insert(0, e)

 return bytes(plain_text).decode(&quot;latin-1&quot;) # Return original string
In this example we can see the MTF code taking advantage of the three repetitive &#x27;s in the input word. The common dictionary here, however, is less than ideal since it is initialized with more commonly used ASCII printable characters put after little-used control codes, against the MTF code&#x27;s design intent of keeping what&#x27;s commonly used in the front. If one rotates the dictionary to put the more-used characters in earlier places, a better encoding can be obtained:
from itertools import chain

def block32(x):
 return range(x, x+32)

class MoveToFrontMoreCommon(MoveToFront):
 »&gt; mtf = MoveToFrontMoreCommon()
 »&gt; list(mtf.encode(&quot;Wikipedia&quot;))
 [55, 10, 12, 1, 17, 9, 9, 3, 7]
 def __init__(self):
 super().__init__(
 chain( # Sort the ASCII blocks:
 block32(ord(&quot;a&quot;) - 1), # first lowercase,
 block32(ord(&quot;A&quot;) - 1), # then uppercase,
 block32(ord(&quot;!&quot;) - 1), # punctuation/number,
 block32(0), # control codes,
 range(128, 256), # and finally the non-ASCII stuff
 )

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
 import doctest

==Use in practical data compression algorithms==

The MTF transform takes advantage of local correlation of frequencies to reduce the entropy of a message. Indeed, recently used letters stay towards the front of the list; if use of letters exhibits local correlations, this will result in a large number of small numbers such as &quot;0&quot;&#x27;s and &quot;1&quot;&#x27;s in the output.

However, not all data exhibits this type of local correlation, and for some messages, the MTF transform may actually increase the entropy.

An important use of the MTF transform is in Burrows–Wheeler transform based compression. The Burrows–Wheeler transform is very good at producing a sequence that exhibits local frequency correlation from text and certain other special classes of data. Compression benefits greatly from following up the Burrows–Wheeler transform with an MTF transform before the final entropy-encoding step.

===Example===

As an example, imagine we wish to compress Hamlet&#x27;s soliloquy (&quot;To be, or not to be...&quot;). We can calculate the size of this message to be 7033 bits. Naively, we might try to apply the MTF transform directly. The result is a message with 7807 bits (higher than the original). The reason is that English text does not in general exhibit a high level of local frequency correlation. However, if we first apply the Burrows–Wheeler transform, and then the MTF transform, we get a message with 6187 bits. Note that the Burrows–Wheeler transform does not decrease the entropy of the message; it only reorders the bytes in a way that makes the MTF transform more effective.

One problem with the basic MTF transform is that it makes the same changes for any character, regardless of frequency, which can result in diminished compression as characters that occur rarely may push frequent characters to higher values. Various alterations and alternatives have been developed for this reason. One common change is to make it so that characters above a certain point can only be moved to a certain threshold. Another is to make some algorithm that runs a count of each character&#x27;s local frequency and uses these values to choose the characters&#x27; order at any point. Many of these transforms still reserve zero for repeat characters, since these are often the most common in data after the Burrows–Wheeler Transform.

==Move-to-front linked-list==
* The term Move To Front (MTF) is also used in a slightly different context, as a type of a dynamic linked list. In an MTF list, each element is moved to the front when it is accessed. This ensures that, over time, the more frequently accessed elements are easier to access.

<text>Harpalus is a young lunar impact crater that lies on the Mare Frigoris, at the eastern edge of the Sinus Roris. To the southeast at the edge of the mare is the small crater Foucault, and to the northwest on the opposite edge is the walled plain named South.

The rim of Harpalus is sharp-edged with little sign of wear or erosion. The wall is not perfectly circular, and has a few outward notches and protrusions, especially along the eastern half. It is surrounded by an outer of ejecta, most notably towards the north, and is at the center of a small ray system. Due to its rays, Harpalus is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

The inner surface is d, and flows down to the floor. The interior wall is the least wide along the northern face, making the floor slightly offset in that direction. Near the midpoint is a system of low central ridges.

==Popular culture references==
Harpalus was the rocket landing site in the 1950s science fiction film &quot;Destination Moon&quot;. It was chosen by artist Chesley Bonestell as it had a relatively high latitude and the Earth could be realistically displayed at a low altitude during camera shots. However, the resulting clay model depicted crazing (net-like cracks) across the crater floor, an addition to which Bonestell objected.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Harpalus.

<doc id="1039754" wikidata="Q31028" url="?curid=1039754" title="Houston, Renfrewshire">
<text>Houston ( ; ), is a village in the council area of Renfrewshire and the larger historic county of the same name in the west central Lowlands of Scotland.

Houston lies within the Gryffe Valley on the banks of the River Gryffe north-west of Paisley and is the largest settlement in the civil parish of Houston and Killellan, which covers the neighbouring village of Crosslee and a number of smaller settlements in the villages&#x27; rural hinterland.

The village grew around a 16th-century castle and parish church dedicated to Saint Peter, which gave the area its former name of Kilpeter (&quot;Cille Pheadair&quot; in Scottish Gaelic). The present-day old village dates mainly back to the 18th century and was a planned community, replacing earlier buildings. Historically, the economy was based around agriculture and, in common with a number of other Renfrewshire villages, cotton weaving. The old village was designated as a conservation area in 1968.

From the middle of the 20th century, a larger area of residential settlement expanded the village into nearby areas such as the more upmarket Craigends, removing the open country between Houston and Crosslee. These additions to the village have expanded its population considerably, changing its character chiefly to a dormitory settlement for nearby Glasgow and Paisley with a largely service-based economy.

==History==
===Toponymy===

Houston was originally known as Kilpeter. In the mid 12th century, the fee of Kilpeter was granted by Baldwin of Biggar, Sheriff of Lanark, to Hugh of Pettinain. From Hugh, the lands eventually became known as Houston (meaning &quot;Hugh&#x27;s &quot;town&quot; or manor&quot;).

In a bull of Pope Honorius in 1225–7, the churches of Kilmacolm and Houston are mentioned as &quot;ecclesiae de Kilmacolme et de Villa Hugonis&quot;. In a later bull of Pope Clement IV in 1265, the churches belonging to Paisley Abbey are listed including the church of &quot;Howston&quot;.

===Early history===
Houston had long been a site of human settlement. In the 1970s, a Bronze Age burial site was found at South Mound on the western edge of the village. To the north-east lies Barochan Hill, the site of a Roman fort. A later Antonine era fort was found on a farm near Bishopton, less than 2 miles away.

The first village in Houston was constructed around the parish Church of St Peter and Houston Castle, now respectively the parish church and Houston House – largely 19th century buildings. Houston House and the castle which is partially incorporated within its structure date back to the time of Hugh of Pettinain and remained in the possession of his family who later became the Houstons of Houston. The Castle stayed in the ownership of the family until 1740 when it was purchased by Glasgow tobacco lord Alexander Speirs of Elderslie. Following ownership by five generations of the Speirs family, Houston House passed to Major David Crichton Maitland in 1959 and then to his son Mark Crichton Maitland in 1995 before being divided into a number of flats.
 James McGuire MacRae was presented with the estate by his father&#x27;s friend, James MacRae. It passed to his son, who demolished the castle and built the weavers cottages with the stones. With this 18th-century change in ownership of the land therefore, the &#x27;old village&#x27; was cleared from around the castle by the laird. The new village of some thirty five cottages constructed to the west in 1781 from the stone of the Castle, which was later to evolve into a country house. This new village – which forms the basis of the modern village – was a planned community built along two main streets: North Street and South Street and is an example of the 18th century Planned Village Movement. The layout, straddling the Houston Burn, provided washing facilities accessible to local people as well as supporting the small-scale weaving industry. This &#x27;new village&#x27; is designated by the Renfrewshire authorities as a conservation village.

A notable remnant of this move is the village&#x27;s mercat cross, which incorporates parts dating back to the 14th century. Due to the move from an original position on Kirk Road, and the fact that it incorporates a large sundial, it has been placed at an unusual angle at the centre of the &#x27;new&#x27; village. The mercat cross has become used as a symbol for the village.

===Modern history===
Both railway stations (on separate lines) built within the parish in the 19th century, Houston and Crosslee Station and Georgetown station (both now closed), bypassed the village itself. As a consequence, Houston did not experience the railway boom of nearby villages like Bridge of Weir and Kilmacolm, expanding slowly until the later half of the 20th century when it became a popular commuter settlement.

The main industry of Houston between the 17th and 19th century was weaving. The River Gryffe later provided a cotton spinning industry with the creation of the Crosslee cotton mill with other small manufacturing concerns, such as embroidery, later opening in the village.

In July 2007, Houston was featured prominently in news reports around the United Kingdom after it was discovered that inhabitants of a house in the village were linked to the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack of 30 June. The Houston Community Council observed that &quot;it is a sobering thought that such a situation could happen on our very doorstep and that even in a quiet, rural setting such as ours there can be people intent on disrupting the natural balance of things by violent means.&quot;

==Governance==
===Local government===

Houston and its parish form part of the Renfrewshire council area. For the 2007 local authority elections in Scotland, Houston was entered into a new four-councillor ward, Ward 9, alongside Crosslee and the town of Linwood (Ward 9).

The boundaries of the civil parish of Houston and Kilellan follow the creation of a united ecclesiastical parish centred on Houston in the 18th century. The parish spreads over a wide rural hinterland including a number of nearby settlements, the most significant being Crosslee, Craigends and Barochan.

With the decline of significance of the civil parish in local government, this area has largely become part of the Houston Community Council area . The community council is chiefly a consultative body, forming a focus for local views, and has no statutory powers of its own.

===Central government===
Houston forms part of the Paisley and Renfrewshire North constituency for elections to the House of Commons in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The current Member of Parliament (MP) for this area is Gavin Newlands. The constituency was created in 2005 following boundary changes with Houston previously forming part of the West Renfrewshire constituency.

For devolved matters, Houston is part of the Scottish Parliament constituency of Renfrewshire North and West, which straddles the boundary between the council areas of Inverclyde and Renfrewshire. Since 2011, the constituency Member of the Scottish Parliament for the area is Natalie Don MSP. The Renfrewshire North and West constituency forms part of the West of Scotland Scottish Parliament electoral region. Seven further MSPs are elected for this region through the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Additional Member electoral system.

==Landmarks==

Houston&#x27;s historic village centre, located at the north-west edge of the village, is a designated conservation area. The area is home to the main village pubs, small shops and the village&#x27;s Post Office. North Street and South Street are dominated by traditional white cottages, some dating to the 17th century. The old village was a planned community of houses largely built around the Houston Burn, which gave communal access to washing facilities.

Some remains of the 16th century Houston Castle still exist largely in the grounds of the current Houston House. The area sits beside Houston and Killellan Kirk, the established (Church of Scotland) parish church. It is possible that Lord Darnley, husband of Mary, Queen of Scots resided at the castle for some years.

The Barochan Cross, an 11 ft (3.4 metre) tall Celtic Christian cross possibly dating to the 8th century, formerly lay just south of the Mill of Barochan in the parish. In the 19th century, it was moved to a knoll opposite Corsliehill closer to the village before finally being moved in the 20th century to Paisley Abbey where it now remains in order to protect it from further weathering.

The Craigends Yew is an ancient yew tree in the parish, supposed to be the oldest living thing in Renfrewshire, with a potential age of around a thousand years. There are two ancient wells in Houston, once considered to have healing powers. St Fillan&#x27;s Well sits in the fields beside Kilallan Kirk and St Peter&#x27;s Well that also gives its name to a locally brewed ale.

The parish church, which is a congregation of the Church of Scotland, lies to the east of the old village. A 19th century Roman Catholic church, St Fillan&#x27;s, is to the south of Main Street.

==Religion==
Houston&#x27;s has a long association with St Peter, providing the village&#x27;s historic name of Kilpeter. Its current parish church, Houston and Killellan Church or Kirk, lies in the grounds of Houston House. The Kirk was constructed in the 1870s, replacing a church on the same site constructed in 1775, and dedicated to Archibald Alexander Speirs of Elderslie. Following his death aged 28 while sitting as Member of Parliament for West Renfrewshire, his mother provided the building costs as a memorial.

The current parish dates from 1771, when the parishes of Houston and Killellan were united. The former parish church in the nearby hamlet of Killellan was known as the Church of St Fillan, which the name of the settlement derives. The former church building was left redundant by the unification and was abandoned. The ruin, dated 1635 but believed to have originated in the 10th or 11th century, still stands some west of the centre of Houston on the Barochan Cross Road. This church is now held by the Kilallan Kirk Preservation Trust following its donation by Elderslie Estates in 2005 and is a scheduled historic monument. An annual evening service is held amongst the ruins in July by the congregation of the united parish. The church&#x27;s manse, which is immediately adjacent to it, also finds continued use as a private residence and is thought to be the oldest existing dwellinghouse in Renfrewshire. St Fillan&#x27;s Holy Well and St Fillan&#x27;s Seat are located near to the old kirk.

St Peter&#x27;s Well stands in a field below Greenhill Farm on Chapel Road close to the site of a pre-Reformation chapel and is a rare example of a covered or house holy well, the waters of which were once thought to ensure the safe return of travellers such as pilgrims.

The Houston and Kilellan church hall on Main Street was built immediately following the Disruption of 1843 as a separate congregation forming part of the Free Church of Scotland, and later the United Free Church of Scotland being known during this time as the West Kirk. Following the reunification of the United Free Church and the established Church of Scotland in 1929, the West Kirk existed as a second Church of Scotland congregation in the village until a fire destroyed much of the building in March 1941. The lack of a building caused the two congregations to again worship in the same parish church. The West Kirk building was fully restored by 1953, taking its place as the church hall it remains to this day.

St. Fillan&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, also on Main Street, was established in 1841 on a property called &quot;Four Windings&quot; now remembered in the name of an adjacent street.

==Economy==
Chiefly serving a commuter village, Houston&#x27;s chief local economic activity is agriculture, with some tertiary sector businesses such as local shops and public houses serving residents and visitors. There are a number of these shops and pubs in the old village, and a number of shops located on the boundary with Crosslee.

===Public houses and brewing===
The parish supports a number of public houses, with two located in the historic village centre: the Fox and Hounds on South Street and the Houston Inn on North Street, established in 1779 and 1784 respectively. Until 2010, a third, the Cross Keys Inn, lay on Main Street, with a name derived from the crossed keys symbol of St Peter as a reference to the village&#x27;s original name, Kilpeter. It has since operated as a restaurant. A further restaurant and public house, the River Inn, lies in Crosslee and was formerly the Crosslee Inn and the Pine Trees.

The village hosts a regular beer festival/ A microbrewery, the Houston Brewing Company, also formerly operated from a building adjacent to the Fox and Hounds.

==Culture and community==
There are a number of community organisations and events that take place in the village. The village&#x27;s main park, Houston Public Park, is adjacent to the old village, with others at South Street and Ardgryffe Park among the more modern housing developments.

Houston Public Park is the venue for the village&#x27;s annual agricultural show, taking place in the summer and organised by the Houston and Killellan Agricultural Society. Another significant local event is the Kirk Carnival, organised by the parish church and focused around the church hall and Carrick Centre on Main Street, which involves a parade and a number of stalls and entertainments and including the local primary schools.

In 1992, Strathgryffe Tennis Squash and Fitness Club, opened with support from the Lawn Tennis Association and the National Lottery Sports Fund, is also located in the village. An equestrian club, the Kilmacolm and Kilallan Riding Club is based on the boundary of the parish. A foxhunt, the Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire Foxhounds, has operated from kennels in the village since 1850.

The village also hosts a lawn bowls club, the John G. Fleming Bowling Club, which was founded the local landowner whose name it bears to mark the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria.

==Education==
Gryffe High School is a non-denominational co-educational state secondary school which serves the village and surrounding settlements, most particularly neighbouring Bridge of Weir. The school has a strong academic reputation, and in 2009 was ranked as the seventh best-performing state secondary school in Scotland by The Times newspaper&#x27;s league tables. Also in 2009, the school was praised in a report by Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Education.

There are two primary schools in Houston. Houston Primary School is a non-denominational school, whereas St Fillan&#x27;s Primary School is a Roman Catholic faith school. Both are co-educational state schools. As stated above, Gryffe High School is the non-denominational secondary for the village whereas St. Benedict&#x27;s High School is the Roman Catholic secondary serving Houston along with Bridge of Weir (which St. Fillan&#x27;s also serves).

The &#x27;old schoolhouse&#x27; at the north end of Main Street in the old village centre has been converted into self-catering accommodation and the former school at the south end of Main Street now exists as a community building known as the Carrick Centre.

==Public services==
The territorial police force covering Houston is the Police Service of Scotland. It is part of the Renfrewshire and Inverclyde division and the Renfrew area Command. The nearest local police station is at Johnstone. There was a police station and police house in the village opened in the mid-1940s, which was closed in 2001.

For judicial purposes, the Houston forms part of the sheriffdom of North Strathclyde and public prosecutions are directed by the Procurator Fiscal for North Strathclyde. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is the statutory fire and rescue service covering the village and maintains three fire stations in Renfrewshire with the closest at Johnstone.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is the National Health Service Board providing public health care. The nearest major hospitals with accident and emergency facilities is the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. There is one medical practice in the village, which is linked to another surgery in Bridge of Weir.

Water and sewerage is provided by Scottish Water, a public body, and water and sewerage charges are collected alongside council tax by Renfrewshire Council, the local authority, on its behalf. Renfrewshire Council is also responsible for the provision of waste management in the area. The local distribution network operator, the organisation licensed to transmit electricity from the National Grid to consumers, is Scottish Power.

<doc id="1039756" wikidata="Q1101005" url="?curid=1039756" title="Heraclitus (crater)">
<text>Heraclitus is a complex lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon. The crater Licetus forms the northern end of the formation. Just to the east is Cuvier, and due south is Lilius. Just to the west of Heraclitus is the small satellite crater Heraclitus K, to the south of which is a pair of larger overlapping craters, Lilius E and Lilius D.

The entire formation is heavily worn, with features smoothed down by a long history of impacts. Heraclitus is a complex formation composed of three sections divided by a triple-armed interior ridge. Of the three sections, the most eroded and irregular is at the eastern end where the outer rim forms a low ridge that joins to Cuvier.

The circular southwest end is the most intact section, forming the circular satellite crater Heraclitus D, which is attached to the other two sections along the northeast rim. There are a pair of ghost-crater rims on the floor, and a low ridge in the southwest. The crater is 90 kilometers in diameter and 3.8 kilometers deep. It may be from the Pre-Imbrian period, which lasted from 4.55 to 3.85 billion years ago.

It is named after the 6th-century BC Greek philosopher Heraclitus.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Heraclitus.

<text>Craigends is a residential area in the civil parish of Houston and Killellan in Renfrewshire, Scotland lying south of the River Gryffe and on the banks of the River Locher. Craigends is on the south-eastern edge of the village of Houston, bordering the parish&#x27;s other village, Crosslee. As with most of Houston, Craigends is predominantly a commuter settlement.

Craigends was formerly an estate most notably the seat of the Cunninghames of Craigends, related to the nearby family of the same name who were the Earls of Glencairn, with their seat in Kilmacolm. Craigends House, a notable example of Scottish Baronial architecture designed by David Bryce was demolished in 1971. Ardgryfe House, a category B-listed Renaissance-style stone mansion built in 1867, is on Craigends Road.

The Craigends Yew is a circa 700 old layering yew tree grove located in the grounds of the old estate next to the River Gryfe. It is one of the largest of its species in Scotland.

== Etymology ==

The estate&#x27;s name is of uncertain origin though it is likely that the Craig construct comes from the Scottish Gaelic creagh: &quot;a steep rugged mass of rock projecting upward or outward&quot;.

Craigends does entail a number of igneous rock outcroppings: notably on the banks of the Gryffe near Crosslee, beneath the Gryffe Bridge, and in the centre of what is now Cunningham Gardens. It is interesting to speculate which (if any) of these features may have impressed on the ancient landscape to inspire the estate&#x27;s name.

== History ==
On the 4 February 1479 Craigends was granted to William Cuninghame. William was the second son of the Earl of Glencairn and his entitlement created a new branch in the influential Cuninghame family of Ayrshire: the Cuninghames of Craigends. The first mansion house was built around this time by William; it would be the home to his descendants for over 400 years. Members of the family were elected to Parliament for Renfrewshire in 1643 and 1689.

John Charles Cuninghame, the 17th and final laird died in 1917. His estate and personal fortune was inherited by his widow, Alison Cuninghame, who maintained the mores of the landed gentry for decades to come. When she died in November 1958 the estate was inherited by a nephew. Not having the means to maintain the estate, however, the estate was left derelict and, after a few years, sold to the housing construction company Taylor Woodrow. The estate and mansion house were left abandoned for many years and fell into extreme dilapidation. In 1971 the mansion house was demolished and by 1973, Taylor Woodrow had started construction on the first of what would be many housing estates within the grounds.

== Lodge Craigends ==
In 1907, John Charles Cunninghame became one of the many benefactors in the establishment of a Masonic Lodge in the area. In addition to a financial donation, he also allowed the Lodge to use his family estate&#x27;s name.

Lodge Craigends No 1042 was established in the nearby town of Linwood and continues to operate there. Craigends Social Club (the social arm of Lodge Craigends) has become a valuable facility which is used by many members of the local community.

== Landscape ==

Craigends straddles two rivers: the Gryffe and the Locher. Situated on rolling land the estate rises gently to its highest point in the southeast. Though now dominated by private houses, roads and pavements some ancient woodland remains - most notably in the west, along the banks of the Gryffe.

<text>Crosslee is a small village lying on the bank of the River Gryffe in the civil parish of Houston and Killellan, Renfrewshire, in Scotland. It lies around half a mile south of the old village centre of Houston and immediately west of Craigends, although residential development has removed any significant open space between the three.

The village itself is largely composed of private housing and exists chiefly as a dormitory settlement. There is one public house and a small public park.

==History==
Crosslee developed as a small community around a cotton mill, which opened in late 1700s. The factory was later developed and operated by R&amp;T Jack who manufactured thread on the site. During the World War I their major customer was Nobel and the factory converted to producing “gun cotton” for the war effort. After the war the factory was rebuilt with the original stone building being replaced by a concrete structure in the 1920s.

The factory was eventually sold to Nobel Explosives (who became ICI) in 1926. They operated it till it was sold to TH Lawson in 1959 where the company traded as Lawtex and they manufactured umbrellas. It was demolished in 1985. An existing mill building, which still exists beside the river, has been redeveloped to provide office space.

==Governance==
Crosslee is part of Ward 9 (Houston, Crosslee and Linwood) for local authority elections to Renfrewshire Council, a four-councillor ward.

With the decline in the importance of the civil parish, Crosslee has found itself associated for local government purposes with Houston Community Council.

<doc id="1039766" wikidata="Q3298661" url="?curid=1039766" title="FieldTurf">
<text>FieldTurf is a brand of artificial turf playing surface. It is manufactured and installed by FieldTurf Tarkett, a division of French company Tarkett. FieldTurf is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and its primary manufacturing facility is located in Calhoun, Georgia, United States. With a design intended to more accurately replicate real grass, the new product rapidly gained popularity in the late 1990s.

==History==
Jean Prévost bought the patent of the FieldTurf product in 1988, and originally named his Montreal-based company SynTenni Co., a name which would eventually be dropped in favor of FieldTurf Inc. In 1995, John Gilman, a former Canadian Football League player and coach, joined FieldTurf as CEO.

In 1997, FieldTurf made its first major installation for a professional team, at the training facility for the English Premiership&#x27;s Middlesbrough F.C. , FieldTurf has installed over 7000 athletic fields.

In 2005, French flooring manufacturer and minority shareholder Tarkett increased its share in FieldTurf, which led to the integration of the two companies. FieldTurf is a part of the Tarkett Sports division of the holding company Tarkett SA.

In May 2010, FieldTurf acquired the American company EasyTurf of San Diego, California, as a way to gain entry into the rapidly growing residential and commercial synthetic grass markets in the United States.

==Product details==

The surface is composed of monofilament polyethylene-blend fibers tufted into a polypropylene backing. The infill is composed of a bottom layer of silica sand, a middle layer which is a mixture of sand and cryogenic rubber, and a top layer of only rubber. The fibers are meant to replicate blades of grass, while the infill acts as a cushion. This cushion is intended to improve safety when compared to earlier artificial surfaces and allows players to plant and pivot as if they were playing on a grass field.

Each square foot of turf contains about 3 kg (7 lb) of sand and 1.5 kg (3 lb) of cryogenic rubber. FieldTurf does not use shock-absorbency pads below its infill. The backing of the turf is a combination of woven and nonwoven polypropylene. These materials are permeable and allow water to drain through the backing itself.

==Safety==
Some evidence shows higher player injury on artificial turf. In a study performed by the National Football League Injury and Safety Panel, published in the October 2012 issue of the &quot;American Journal of Sports Medicine&quot;, Elliott B. Hershman &quot;et al.&quot; reviewed injury data from NFL games played between 2000 and 2009. They wrote, &quot;...the injury rate of knee sprains as a whole was 22% higher on FieldTurf than on natural grass. While MCL sprains did not occur at a rate significantly higher than on grass, rates of ACL sprains were 67% higher on FieldTurf.&quot;

Studies of the safety of FieldTurf are conflicting. A five-year study funded by FieldTurf and published in the &quot;American Journal of Sports Medicine&quot; found that injury rates for high-school sports were similar on natural grass and synthetic turf. However, notable differences in the types of injuries were found. Athletes playing on synthetic turf sustained more skin injuries and muscle strains, while those who played on natural grass were more susceptible to concussions and ligament tears. In 2010, another FieldTurf-funded but peer-reviewed study was published in the &quot;American Journal of Sports Medicine&quot;, this time on NCAA Division I-A football, concluding that in many cases, games played on FieldTurf-branded products led to fewer injuries than those played on natural grass. However, the NFL&#x27;s Injury and Safety Panel presented a study finding that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries happened 88% more often in games played on FieldTurf than in games played on grass. In 2012, the Injury and Safety Panel published an independently funded analysis of actual game data over the 2000–2009 seasons. Their statistically significant findings showed a 67% higher rate of ACL sprains and 31% higher rate of eversion ankle sprains.

==Uses==
===Gridiron football===
The first installation of FieldTurf in the United States took place at Dick Bivins Stadium in Amarillo, Texas (which was the home field for the Amarillo Independent School District&#x27;s football teams) in 1998. The first major college football installation was at University of Nebraska&#x27;s Memorial Stadium in 1999. The following year, it was installed at the two Pac-10 stadiums: Martin Stadium in Pullman, Washington and Husky Stadium in Seattle. The first installation in an NFL (and by extension, professional) stadium was in 2002, at the Seattle Seahawks&#x27; new stadium, known as Lumen Field. Originally planned to have a natural grass field, the Seahawks instead decided to install FieldTurf after they had played the two previous seasons in Husky Stadium on that surface, and to ease conversion and footing concerns for a future Major League Soccer team in the venue, which has been shared with Seattle Sounders FC since 2009 (natural grass is brought in and installed over the FieldTurf for FIFA-sanctioned events).

===Association football===
FieldTurf&#x27;s first high-profile installation came in January 1997 as English club Middlesbrough chose FieldTurf for its new training field. Only artificial fields with FIFA-recommended 2-star status can be used in FIFA and UEFA Finals competitions. Other FIFA and UEFA competitions require at least 1-star status.

In 2001, Boston University&#x27;s FieldTurf soccer field became FieldTurf&#x27;s first to obtain FIFA 1-star status. In 2005, Saprissa Stadium in San José, Costa Rica became the first stadium to host a FIFA World Cup qualifying match on FieldTurf. The Dundalk F.C. Stadium, Oriel Park, received FieldTurf&#x27;s first FIFA 2-star rating. FieldTurf has 29 FIFA-recommended 1-Star installations and 31 FIFA Recommended 2-Star installations . In 2007, the FIFA U-20 World Cup Canada had almost 50% of its games played on FieldTurf.

====Major League Soccer====
The use of FieldTurf in Major League Soccer (MLS) has received criticism, especially from the league&#x27;s international roster players used to playing on natural grass overseas in their home domestic leagues and FIFA competitions.

The installation of the surface at CenturyLink Field in Seattle was approved as mentioned above when the state stadium authority which operates the venue agreed to bring in a natural grass surface for FIFA-sanctioned events.

In September 2006, several top Canadian soccer players appealed to the Canadian Soccer Association to install a natural grass surface at BMO Field in Toronto. The club removed the FieldTurf playing surface and switched to a traditional grass surface starting in 2010.

Following David Beckham&#x27;s move to Major League Soccer in 2007, he voiced his opinion that the league should convert to grass for all pitches. In an apology, he stated that the surface is fine at lower levels, but that his feelings had not changed about the MLS use because of the toll the harder surface takes on the body. Thierry Henry opted out of road matches in Seattle when he played for the New York Red Bulls specifically because of the Sounders&#x27; use of FieldTurf in that venue.

===Public works===
A specialized version of FieldTurf called Air FieldTurf has been installed to cover the edges of runways at several airports.

<text>Ranfurly (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Rann Feòirling&quot;) is a small settlement on the southern edge of the village of Bridge of Weir, which lies within the Gryffe Valley in the council area and historic county of Renfrewshire in the West-Central Lowlands of Scotland.

Ranfurly derives its name from the 15th century Ranfurly Castle situated there. The area became a dormitory settlement of residential housing in the Victorian Era. Today Ranfurly is a conservation area.

==History==
===Ranfurly Castle===
Ranfurly Castle was constructed around 1440 by the Knox family who, in the 19th century, took the title of Earl of Ranfurly in the Peerage of Ireland. The building was three stories high and the remains of the Castle are located in the grounds of the Old Course Ranfurly Golf Club. In 1665 it was sold to the Cochrane Earls of Dundonald, later it was sold to the Hamiltons of Holmhead, then to the Aitkenheads.

===Victorian settlement===
The settlement of Ranfurly originated primarily in the 1880s to 1910s, with quality stone-built houses and some fine villas in the higher land above the village following the expansion of the area and the arrival of the railway in Bridge of Weir in 1864.

Significant in the area was the Ranfurly Hotel which was built in 1882 in the Scots Baronial style, designed by architect Robert Raeburn for the Bonar family of Ranfurly estate and an extension designed by James Miller. It was closed as a hotel prior to the First World War and seen a number of uses since.

The Eastwing of Castle Terrace was severely damaged in a fire during the 1990’s and demolished in the mid 90’s. 
The rest of Castle Terrace was refurbished, which included seven flats and seven shops. 
The luxury flats were refurbished to a high standard, including designer kitchens, Jacuzzi baths, pine-lined sauna, mod cons and private parking.

==Governance==
Ranfurly is part of Bridge of Weir for local government purposes, which is in turn part of the council area of Renfrewshire, as well the historic county of Renfrewshire which has wider boundaries and retains some official functions, for example as a registration county and lieutenancy area.

For elections to Renfrewshire Council, Bridge of Weir is part of ward 10, named &#x27;Bishopton, Bridge of Weir and Langbank&#x27;, which elects three of Renfrewshire&#x27;s forty three councillors. T

Bridge of Weir is also one of Renfrewshire&#x27;s twenty-seven community council areas, which represents the Ranfurly area. Historically, Bridge of Weir was split between the civil parishes of Houston and Kilellan and Kilbarchan, with Ranfurly falling into the latter.

==Religion==
The former Ranfurly Church merged with St Machar&#x27;s Church, also in the area, to form the Ranfurly St Machar Church in 1968 within the Church of Scotland. The latter church building, constructed in 1878 in the Gothic Revival style, is now used by the joint congregation. The former Ranfurly Church has been converted into private residences.

St Machar&#x27;s, and later St Machar&#x27;s Ranfurly, has been the historical parish church of Bridge of Weir since the area&#x27;s elevation to a quoad sacra parish in 1887.

<doc id="1039770" wikidata="Q525897" url="?curid=1039770" title="Blue-fronted amazon">
<text>The blue-fronted amazon (Amazona aestiva), also called the blue-fronted parrot, the turquoise-fronted amazon and the turquoise-fronted parrot, is a South American species of amazon parrot and one of the most common amazon parrots kept in captivity as a pet or companion parrot. Its common name is derived from the distinctive blue/turquoise marking on its head just above its beak.

==Taxonomy==
The blue-fronted amazon was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Its specific epithet is the feminine form of the Latin adjective &quot;aestivus&quot;, &quot;of the summer&quot;. Two subspecies are recognized:

*&quot;A. a. aestiva&quot; (nominate) is found in eastern Brazil. The leading edge of the wing (&quot;shoulder&quot;) is red.
*&quot;A. a. xanthopteryx&quot; occurs from northern and eastern Bolivia through adjacent parts of Brazil, to Paraguay and northern Argentina. The &quot;shoulder&quot; is partly or wholly yellow. Generally with more yellow to the head than nominate.

The taxon &quot;xanthopteryx&quot; has been treated as a separate species, but the two subspecies interbreed freely where they come into contact.

Additionally, there are significant individual variations in both facial pattern and amount of yellow/red to the &quot;shoulder&quot;. In one extreme, individuals with essentially no yellow on the head and entirely green &quot;shoulders&quot; are known from north-western Argentina.

==Description==
The blue-fronted amazon is a mainly green parrot about long. They have blue feathers on the forehead above the beak and yellow on the face and crown. Distribution of blue and yellow varies greatly among individuals. Unlike most other &quot;Amazona&quot; parrots, its beak is mostly black. There is no overt sexual dimorphism to the human eye, but analysis of the feathers using spectrometry, a method which allows the plumage to be seen as it would be by a parrot&#x27;s tetrachromatic vision, shows clear differences between the plumage of the sexes. Juveniles of parrots are duller and have dark irises.

==Distribution and habitat==
The range of the blue-fronted amazon extends over eastern and northern Bolivia, eastern Brazil, Paraguay and northern Argentina. It is found in forests (though generally avoids extensive humid forests such as the Amazon), woodland, savanna and palm groves.

A small feral breeding population is also present in the greener regions of Stuttgart in Germany and Genoa in Italy. Although they have been observed in the wild in Puerto Rico, they are probably the result of escaped pets, and no reproduction has been recorded.

==Breeding==
The blue-fronted amazon nests in tree cavities. The oval eggs are white and measure around 38 × 30 mm. There are usually three to five in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for about 27 days and the chicks leave the nest about 60 days after hatching.

==Status==

The status of this species is evaluated as being of least concern by BirdLife International. However, while it remains common throughout a significant part of its range, there is evidence of a population decline, and this species has been heavily traded: Since 1981 when it was listed on CITES Appendix II, 413,505 wild-caught individuals have been recorded in international trade (UNEP-WCMC CITES Trade Database, January 2005). It is regarded as a crop pest in parts of its native range.

Paradoxically, illegal trade may have contributed to expansions of the range of this parrot: It is becoming common in Rio de Janeiro, which is not a part of its historical range, something attributed to escaped caged birds.

==Aviculture==
The blue-fronted amazon is commonly seen as a pet, both in South America and other parts of the world. Their talking ability varies greatly from individual to individual, but some speak nearly as well as the yellow-headed amazon group (yellow-naped, Panama, yellow-crowned, double yellow-headed). They seem to have a proclivity for singing. They require interaction but also can play with toys contently for several hours at a time. Pets require plenty of toys, perches, and climbing room. As with some other birds, under no circumstances are blue-fronted amazons to eat avocado. Some individuals, particularly males, can be aggressive in spring, the mating season.

An extremely rare red (or chocolate raspberry) mutation of the species appeared in captivity in 2004, bred by the psittaculturist Howard Voren. The mutation results in yellow plumage being replaced by that of a red/pink hue and greens with a chocolate-brown, with the depth and intensity of color varying by location upon the body.

<doc id="1039772" wikidata="Q745469" url="?curid=1039772" title="Mairan (crater)">
<text>Mairan is a lunar impact crater that is located on a highland peninsula between Oceanus Procellarum to the west and Mare Imbrium to the east. To the north-northeast is the comparably sized crater Sharp. Northwest of Mairan is the heavily eroded Louville.

The outer rim of Mairan has not been significantly eroded or impacted, and retains a sharp edge. The surface around Mairan is rough and irregular, with a multitude of many tiny craters, particularly to the south and west. The inner walls display some , and flow down to a relatively flat interior floor.

Mairan is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

==Mairan domes==
The volcanic complex, known as Mairan Hills or Mairan Domes, is composed of Mairan T together with three satellite domes (Mairan Northwest, Mairan Middle, and Mairan South). It was formed by two volcanic episodes 3.75 and 3.35 billion years ago, extruding a viscous silicic lava simultaneously with basalt eruptions in nearby mare. Most of volcanic complex, except for dome summits, is now buried under mare surface.

In the mare, due west of Mairan, is a small lunar dome designated Mairan T with 3.8 km wide depression at the summit (in official IAU nomenclature &quot;Mairan T&quot; name refers only to the depression), believed to be a caldera The width of hill is about 7 km, and height is about 800 m. It is one of four unusually steep (with slopes reaching 22-27 degrees) and bright domes in area which are thought to be formed by very viscous, high-Si lava.

The composition of domes is changing from the north to south, with Mairan Northwest composed of pyroxenes with 30% quartz admixture, while Mairan South dome composed of nearly pure quartz, with extremely high thorium concentration of 83 ppm.

==Rima Mairan==
There is a sinuous rille along the southwest edge of the highland peninsula containing Mairan. It is designated Rima Mairan, and follows a north–south course for a length of about 100 kilometers.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Mairan.

<doc id="1039776" wikidata="Q1109724" url="?curid=1039776" title="Dovrefjell–Sunndalsfjella National Park">
<text>Dovrefjell–Sunndalsfjella National Park () is a National Park in Norway. It was established in 2002 to replace and enlarge the former Dovrefjell National Park which had been established in 1974. The park occupies and encompasses areas in three Norwegian counties: Innlandet, Trøndelag, and Møre og Romsdal and includes large parts of the mountain range of Dovrefjell along with the Sunndalsfjella mountains. Together with the National Park, there are eight landscape protected areas and two biotope protected areas that were established adjacent to the park in 2002, comprising a total protected area of . The park itself lies within Dovre Municipality and Lesja Municipality (in Innlandet county), Oppdal Municipality (in Trøndelag county), and Sunndal Municipality and Molde Municipality (in Møre og Romsdal county).

==Ecology==
The National Park was established to:

* preserve a large, continuous and essentially untouched mountain area,
* preserve an alpine ecosystem with its natural biodiversity,
* preserve an important part of the range of the stocks of wild reindeer in Snøhetta and Knutshø,
* safeguard a variation in habitats, 
* preserve the landscape morphology and its distinctive geological deposits, 
* protect cultural heritage.
The public do have access to experience the nature through the exercise of the traditional and simple outdoor life, with technical infrastructure only established to a very modest extent.
In short: To preserve an intact alpine ecosystem with its indigenous wild reindeer. Together with the reindeer in Rondane National Park the last remaining population of wild Fennoscandian reindeer of possible Beringia origin (other wild Norwegian reindeer are of European origin and have interbred with domesticated reindeer to a various extent), wolverine, and various large birds as golden eagle and gyrfalcon can be seen, and also the recently (1947) imported (and potentially dangerous) musk oxen. Arctic fox was common a hundred years ago, diminished gradually from around 1900 and went extinct in the area around the year 1990. A reintroduction program from 2010 on has so far been successful.

Some of the plant life predates the last ice age. There are many endemisms in the area.

Although it is a harsh environment, the mountains make for spectacular hiking during the summer and skiing in the winter. The highest mountain in the park is the Snøhetta. Due to rather long walks between mostly unstaffed huts, great areas without huts and trails and harsh and unstable weather conditions, this area is recommended for experienced and well-equipped wanderers only.

An unequaled natural attraction in Norway is the high waterfall down in Åmotan (). It is located at along Road 70 between Oppdal and Sunndalsøra at the northern border of Åmotan-Grøvudalen Landscape Protected Area, on the northern edge of Dovrefjell–Sunndalsfjella National Park.

==Administration==

The park is divided into a major western part and a minor eastern part by the European route E6 paralleled with the main railway between Oslo and Trondheim. Altogether the protected area amounts and also includes areas in the county of Innlandet in addition to the three of the National Park.

The park, its five adjacent landscape protection areas, and two biotope-protected areas are managed by the National Park Board of Dovrefjell. This is a governmental board: the members are from the same eight municipalities and four counties as the former Dovrefjell Council. They are nominated by those municipalities and counties, and appointed by the Ministry for the Environment. The members are much the same persons (local mayors) as in the Dovrefjell council and one may still consider Dovrefjell–Sunndalsfjella National Park as being managed locally.

The former management model from July 2003 was a trial intended to last until July 2007. The final decision on the permanent management model was made in August 2010 and the new board was formally established on 4 January 2011. The Dovrefjell council was closed down during 2011 and its website closed.
From 2007 to 2011 the Dovrefjell Council managed the National Park and co-ordinated the management of the other areas. The council consisted of the eight involved municipalities and four counties, with political representatives, usually the mayors, elected by the members. Except for the National Park, the conservation areas were managed by the municipality or municipalities (some PAs comprises more than one municipality). The council&#x27;s responsibility for coordinating regional planning and society development, mainly through the European Charter for Sustainable Tourism of The EUROPARC Federation are now being transferred to the new board.

<text>In astrodynamics, the &quot;vis-viva&quot; equation is one of the equations that model the motion of orbiting bodies. It is the direct result of the principle of conservation of mechanical energy which applies when the only force acting on an object is its own weight which is the gravitational force determined by the product of the mass of the object and the strength of the surrounding gravitational field.

&quot;Vis viva&quot; (Latin for &quot;living force&quot;) is a term from the history of mechanics and this name is given to the orbital equation originally derived by Isaac Newton. It represents the principle that the difference between the total work of the accelerating forces of a system and that of the retarding forces is equal to one half the &quot;vis viva&quot; accumulated or lost in the system while the work is being done.

==Formulation==
For any Keplerian orbit (elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic, or radial), the &quot;vis-viva&quot; equation is as follows:
formula_1
where:

* is the relative speed of the two bodies
* is the distance between the two bodies&#x27; centers of mass
* is the length of the semi-major axis ( for ellipses, or for parabolas, and for hyperbolas)
* is the gravitational constant
* is the mass of the central body
The product of can also be expressed as the standard gravitational parameter using the Greek letter .

==Practical applications==
Given the total mass and the scalars and at a single point of the orbit, one can compute:

* and at any other point in the orbit; and
* the specific orbital energy formula_2, allowing an object orbiting a larger object to be classified as having not enough energy to remain in orbit, hence being &quot;suborbital&quot; (a ballistic missile, for example), having enough energy to be &quot;orbital&quot;, but without the possibility to complete a full orbit anyway because it eventually collides with the other body, or having enough energy to come from and/or go to infinity (as a meteor, for example).

The formula for escape velocity can be obtained from the Vis-viva equation by taking the limit as formula_3 approaches formula_4:
formula_5
For a given orbital radius, the escape velocity will be formula_6 times the orbital velocity.

== Derivation for elliptic orbits (0 ≤ eccentricity &lt; 1)==

Specific total energy is constant throughout the orbit. Thus, using the subscripts and to denote apoapsis (apogee) and periapsis (perigee), respectively,
formula_7

Rearranging,
formula_8

Recalling that for an elliptical orbit (and hence also a circular orbit) the velocity and radius vectors are perpendicular at apoapsis and periapsis, conservation of angular momentum requires specific angular momentum formula_9, thus formula_10:
formula_11
formula_12

Isolating the kinetic energy at apoapsis and simplifying,
formula_13

From the geometry of an ellipse, formula_14 where &quot;a&quot; is the length of the semimajor axis. Thus,
formula_15

Substituting this into our original expression for specific orbital energy,
formula_16

Thus, formula_17 and the vis-viva equation may be written
formula_18
or
formula_19

Therefore, the conserved angular momentum can be derived using formula_20 and formula_21, where is semi-major axis and is semi-minor axis of the elliptical orbit, as follows:
formula_22
and alternately,
formula_23

Therefore, specific angular momentum formula_24, and

Total angular momentum formula_25

<text>Inchinnan (; ) is a small village in Renfrewshire, Scotland. The village is located on the main A8 road between Renfrew and Greenock, just south east of the town of Erskine.

==History==
The name of Inchinnan village is derived from the Gaelic word &#x27;Innis&#x27;, which means an island or low-lying land near a river or stream. The other part of the name is taken from Saint Inan, a 9th-century confessor at Irvine.
An ornamental cast iron enclosure near the ford protects &quot;St Conval&#x27;s Chariot&quot; which is supposedly the stone that brought Saint Conval from Ireland to Inchinnan around 590, and a 12th-century church dedicated to Saint Conval was given to the Knights Templar by David I of Scotland. Another church called &#x27;Hallows Church&#x27; replaced it in 1900. The newer church was then replaced by part of the airfield at Abbotsinch. The latest church (Inchinnan Parish) is in the centre of the village. It contains burial stones possibly dating back to around the 9th century. In the same enclosure as St Conval&#x27;s Chariot, &quot;Argyll&#x27;s Stone&quot; was supposedly where the 9th Earl of Argyll rested when he was captured in 1685, before he was executed in Edinburgh on the Maiden.

The confluence of the rivers Black Cart and White Cart is situated near Inchinnan. Travelers crossed by a ford and later by ferry. A stone bridge was built to cross the Black Cart and a bascule bridge crosses the White Cart.

In the 1700s there were quarries within the village. The quarries produced high quality freestone right up until the 1900s. In 1809-1812 stone from the quarries built the nearby Black and White Cart bridges.

William Gilmour, farmer of Town of Inchinnan Farm, was the husband of Charlotte Gilmour who stood trial for his murder by arsenical poisoning in 1843.

==Landmarks==
The bascule bridge at the border with Renfrew was replaced in 1923 by a bascule bridge, which was made by Sir William Arrol &amp; Company. It is still capable of opening, as the Doosan Babcock factory at Renfrew requires the capability to move large loads by river. The bridge crosses White Cart Water and onto the River Clyde.

Inchinnan hosts an art deco style category A listed building called India of Inchinnan. It is the former office block of India Tyres factory which occupied the site from 1927 until the early 1980s. It has now been renovated into private offices. The company also built two groups of houses to accommodate its workers. These streets were called Allands Avenue and India Drive. Prior to its use as a tyre factory, the site was used by William Beardmore and Company to build airships in World War I. Several airships, the No&#x27;s R24, R27, R34 and the R36 were built on this site. The company built 52 houses in Inchinnan, at Beardmore Cottages, to house its workers.

Inchinnan has a large industrial estate within the town. There are a few manufacturing companies left within the area. Some of the companies associated with Inchinnan past and present include: Reekie Machine Tools, Scot Tubes, Gas Measurement Instruments, Bairdswear, Armour Park, Metecno, Aulds and Rolls-Royce. M&amp;Co (Mackays) has its head office at Caledonia House in the industrial estate.

There is a bus depot in Inchinnan which belonged to Arriva Scotland West and before that Western SMT (later Clydeside Scottish). In December 2011, it was announced that Arriva had agreed to sell the company to the independent operator McGill&#x27;s Bus Services and all of Arriva Scotland West&#x27;s operations ceased on Monday 26 March 2012.

East of the village beside the A8 road is a spoil tip from a disused ironstone mine. This hillock is now covered with trees. The mine, known as the Blythswood mine was abandoned by 1875.

A palace was situated within the village about 1506. It was built by Matthew, Lord Darnley, second Earl of Lennox. Remains of the building known as &quot;Palace of Inchinnan&quot; could be seen up to 1710 but have now since been destroyed. It was situated on the border with Erskine; near to Flures Drive in Erskine. An inventory was made of the contents of the palace and chapel around the year 1570. The chapel goods included; two missals, statues of Jesus as a baby, the Virgin Mary and St Anne, with an ivory statue for the hanging chandelier.

Wilhelmina Alexander, famous as Robert Burns&#x27; &#x27;The Bonnie Lass of Ballochmyle&#x27;, is buried in the Old Inchinnan Cemetery near the Black Cart Water. The site has restricted access and is very overgrown.

The Inchinnan Cruising club was established in 1932. It is sited east of the village.

The disused Park or Fulton&#x27;s Quay stands on the River Clyde in the parish of Inchinnan. It was used privately by the owners of Park House.

==Education==
Inchinnan Primary school is the only school within the village. It is a non-denominational state school. For secondary education the village falls within the catchment area of Park Mains High School in Erskine. For Roman Catholic denomination education, the nearest primary school is St Anne&#x27;s in Erskine and Trinity High School in Renfrew is the nearest secondary school. Inchinnan Community Nursery provides pre-school education within the village.

==Transport==
Inchinnan is served by Glasgow International Airport, which is located 2 km south of the town. The village has close links to the nearby M8 motorway and Erskine Bridge. Inchinnan is serviced by McGill&#x27;s Bus Services. Services operate to Glasgow, Paisley, Renfrew, Erskine, Clydebank, Glasgow Airport.

==Geography==
Inchinnan is situated in the north east of Renfrewshire. It lies to the south of the River Clyde and close to where the River Gryffe meets the River Cart. The village borders a number of nearby settlements, some separated by a rural hinterland.

<text>Teistungen is a municipality in the district of Eichsfeld in Thuringia, Germany.

Teistungen was first mentioned in 1090 as the site of Teistungenburg monastery, a filiation of Beuren monastery. The old monastery buildings were demolished in 1975.

It is located in the historical Eichsfeld, formerly a remote exclave of the Electorate of Mainz in Central Germany. In 1283 the fief was acquired by the knightly family &quot;von Hagen&quot; who resided in nearby &quot;Westernhagen Castle&quot; at Berlingerode (destroyed in 1525). The Westernhagen family built two tower houses here that were later replaced by manor houses. Between 1802 and 1807 the Eichsfeld became part of the Kingdom of Westphalia, then until 1945 of the Prussian Province of Saxony, thereafter it formed part of East Germany. Since 1990 it is part of the state of Thuringia.

==Museums==
Teistungen is the location of the Borderland Museum Eichsfeld, a history museum dealing with the inner-German border and the German division. The indoor exhibition covers more than 1,000 squaremetres and is complemented by an outdoor area including a circular trail along the former Iron Curtain. As the museum exhibition is displayed not only in German, but also in English, it attracts tens of thousands visitors from all over the world every year.

<text>Howwood (, ) is a village in Renfrewshire, Scotland. It is between Johnstone and Lochwinnoch, just off the A737 dual carriageway between the nearby town of Paisley and the Ayrshire border. It is served by Howwood railway station.

==History==

Its name is listed in the late 19th century Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland as &quot;Howwood or Hollow-wood&quot;. Hollow-Wood is an anglicisation of the Scots language name &quot;Howewuid&quot;. The Surname Database gives the following etymology for the equivalent surname &#x27;Howood&#x27;: a topographical name from residence by a muddy wood, deriving from the pre-7th-Century Old English &quot;horh&quot;, mud, slime, and &quot;wudu&quot;, wood.

Historically part of the civil parish of Lochwinnoch, it now supports its own Community Council.

The chief industry in the village was formerly bleaching and the finishing of cotton cloth and thread, particularly from the mills of Paisley and the other Renfrewshire villages. Two main bleaching works existed at Bowfield and Midtownfield, the former being the last to close in the 1960s.

Overlooking the village on Kenmure Hill is the Temple, a circular folly built around 1760 and whose purpose is unknown. In the hills above Howwood also lie the remains of Elliston Castle, a tower house once home to the Semple family. A battle took place between Government forces and Covenanters at Muirdykes on the 18 June 1685, led by the Cochrane family of Johnstone The Iron Age hillfort of Walls Hill lies on Whittliemuir with the Walls Loch lying to the west of it.

<text>Palitzsch is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southeast part of the Moon, near the southeast rim of the crater Petavius. Just to the southwest of Palitzsch is Hase, while to the east-southeast is Legendre.

The northeast rim of Palitzsch forms the southern end of Vallis Palitzsch, a lunar valley that follows the eastern rim of Petavius for a distance of about 110 kilometers. The crater rim is relatively low and inconspicuous, while the floor forms a depression in the surface that follows the contours of the neighboring valley.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Palitzsch.

Due to its rays, Palitzsch B is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

<text>Andrés Duany (born September 7, 1949) is an American architect, urban planner, and a founder of the Congress for the New Urbanism.

==Early life and education==
Duany was born in New York City but grew up in Cuba until 1960. He attended The Choate School and Aiglon College and received his undergraduate degree in architecture and urban planning from Princeton University (1971). After a year of study at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he received a master&#x27;s degree from the Yale School of Architecture (1974). He has also received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Yale School of Architecture (2023). 

==Career==
In 1977, Duany co-founded the Miami firm Arquitectonica with his wife, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, Bernardo Fort-Brescia, Laurinda Spear, and Hervin Romney. Arquitectonica was known for its playful, Latin-American influenced modernism. The firm&#x27;s Atlantis Condominium was featured in the opening credits of the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.

In 1980, Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk founded Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Company (DPZ), an architecture firm based in Miami. DPZ participated in the formation of the international urban planning movement known as New Urbanism, intended to offer an alternative to suburban sprawl and urban disinvestment. The firm first received recognition as the designer of new towns such as Seaside, Florida and Kentlands, Maryland. The firm has since completed designs and codes for over three hundred new towns, regional plans, and inner-city revitalization projects. Duany is also considered to be a representative of New Classical Architecture.

Duany is a co-founder and emeritus board member of the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU), established in 1993. He has co-authored five books: &quot;Suburban Nation: The Rise of Sprawl and the Decline of the American Dream&quot;; &quot;The New Civic Art&quot;; &quot;The Smart Growth Manual&quot;; &quot;Garden Cities&quot;; and &quot;Landscape Urbanism and Its Discontents&quot;. Duany has worked as visiting professor at many institutions and holds two honorary doctorates. He is a fellow of the American Institute of Architects and an adjunct professor at the University of Miami.

==Awards==
Duany and his partner, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, have been awarded several honorary doctorates and awards including the Vincent Scully Prize by the National Building Museum in recognition of their contributions to the American built environment. Duany has been awarded the Brandeis Award for Architecture, the Thomas Jefferson Medal in Architecture, the Arthur Ross Award in Community Planning, the Richard H. Driehaus Prize for Classical Architecture, the Society of American Registered Architects International Award, and the Albert Simons Medal of Excellence, among other awards.

<doc id="1039796" wikidata="Q1071344" url="?curid=1039796" title="Chevrolet Venture">
<text>The Chevrolet Venture is a minivan produced by General Motors for the 1997 to 2005 model years. The Chevrolet Venture, along with most of its General Motors minivan siblings, was built at GM&#x27;s Doraville, Georgia, assembly plant.

==Use of name==
The Venture name was first used on a 1988 Chevrolet concept car, which was a full-size four-door sedan more aerodynamic than the 1991–1996 Chevrolet Caprice. It was exhibited in January 1988 at the Teamwork &amp; Technology: For Today and Tomorrow show at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City.

==History==
The Venture was introduced in 1996 for the 1997 model year as a replacement for the radically styled Lumina APV. In the United States, it was also sold as the Oldsmobile Silhouette and the Pontiac Trans Sport, which was later renamed as the Pontiac Montana for 1999 (2000 in Canada). The Venture came in three trim levels, the base, &quot;LS&quot;, and &quot;LT&quot;. The base models of the Venture were short-wheelbase models which came equipped with cloth upholstery, front bucket seats with fixed head restraints, a second-row two-passenger bench seat, and steel wheels. The &quot;LS&quot; came in both short and long wheelbases, and offered aluminum wheels, a varied seating configuration, adjustable head restraints, side airbags, power windows (optional on the base models), and a remote keyless entry system. The &quot;LT&quot; model was a step above the &quot;LS&quot;; exclusively offered as a long-wheelbase model, it offered a power driver seat (optional on the base and &quot;LS&quot; models), optional leather seats, a roof rack (optional on the base and &quot;LS&quot; models), and a driver-side sliding door (optional on the base and &quot;LS&quot; models from 1997 to 1999). The anti-lock brakes were standard on all Ventures from 1996 to 2002, but became optional on the base models later on.

The Venture and its siblings were powered by GM&#x27;s 3.4 L LA1 V6, rated at . After 1999, the engine was slightly redesigned to produce an extra , for a total of , and the instrument panel alarm system has been changed. All Ventures used a four-speed automatic transmission. The Venture was one of the few minivans to have an eight-passenger seating configuration as an option when most minivans seated up to seven passengers. In 2000, the driver-side sliding door became standard on all trim levels, as the passenger-side-only sliding-door models of minivans had rapidly fallen out of favor since Chrysler introduced minivans with the driver-side sliding door for 1996. The exterior was refreshed in 2001, a back-up alarm was added to indicate possible obstacles behind the vehicle, and an all-wheel drive system dubbed Versatrak was introduced in 2002. Also for 2002 was a new steering wheel equivalent to the 2000–2005 Chevrolet Impala, replacing the one that was used in the 1995–2001 Chevrolet Lumina. New for this generation, cabin air filters were installed, and the filters can be accessed from behind an access panel easily accessed from inside the glove compartment.

The optional 2-3-2 seating configuration was dropped in favor of the more conventional 2-2-3 and 2-3-3 seating configurations. The 2-3-3 was the standard for the Chinese-made Buick GL8, and a ten-seat model arranged in a 3-4-3 configuration was used in a Chinese-made version of the Chevrolet Venture for export to the Philippines and Latin America (where it sold alongside the U.S. Venture) where ten-seaters are favored with lower taxes. Reviews and sales were generally lukewarm, especially about the relatively narrow cabin since it had been designed for European roads. Models came in both short and long wheelbases, and long-wheelbase models were available with all-wheel drive. The third row bench seat was designed to fold flat (introduced for 2001 and available on &quot;LS&quot; and &quot;Warner Bros.&quot; models), but forming a higher floor unlike the Honda, Mazda, and Nissan minivans that folded into a well behind the third row.

The Venture was replaced after 2005 by the Chevrolet Uplander, which was essentially a facelift with one long wheelbase configuration, and a longer nose which served chiefly to improve crush distance and styling more like an SUV. Only the long-wheelbase Venture was sold for 2005. Production of the Chevrolet Venture ended on June 24, 2005.

== Model year changes ==

* 2005: All-wheel-drive and short-wheelbase models were discontinued.

==Warner Bros. Edition==
A Warner Bros. edition, introduced in 1999 as part of an overall deal between GM and Warner Bros., included leather and cloth seats, standard built-in child restraints, Warner Bros. badging with Bugs Bunny leaning on the Warner Bros. Shield logo, and a DVD entertainment system, a novelty at the time (VHS players were offered at first; DVD capability was added for the 2002 model year, with the VHS option dropped).

The Warner Bros. edition was only produced for the 2000–2003 model years and the only model to come with a monochromatic exterior (like its Silhouette twin) as opposed to black accents that the other Ventures offered and this model only came in four colors: Blue, red, silver, and black. These models included a complementary membership in &quot;VentureTainment&quot;, which sent free gifts to owners of the van, including VHS and DVD compilations of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; (as well as other Warner Bros. Family Entertainment titles), a cooler with can holders, a special keychain and other perks (including discounts at the Warner Bros. Studio Stores and Six Flags theme parks).

==Safety==

In late 1996, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash-tested the 1997 Pontiac Trans Sport (a twin of the Venture). Due to the poor structural performance resulting in extreme damage to the front of the vehicle, it received a &quot;Poor&quot; rating in the moderate overlap crash test and was ranked the &quot;Worst Performing Vehicle&quot; of all the vehicles tested by the institute, with test results indicating a high risk of serious injury or fatality. This result affected both the Venture&#x27;s and the Silhouette&#x27;s safety reputations (as well its test subject, the Pontiac Trans Sport/Montana).

Additionally, its European twin, the Opel/Vauxhall Sintra, also did badly in the Euro NCAP&#x27;s crash test from 1998 with near-similar results (despite performing well in the side-impact test), with a rating of 2.5 stars (out of 5).

On the other hand, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) gave the 1997 Chevrolet Venture a rating of 4 stars out of 5 in the frontal-impact test, and 5 stars in the side-impact test. Tests on subsequent model years yielded results of 4 stars in most categories, and 3 or 5 stars in others. This applies to all other U-body minivans of the time. Unlike the IIHS, however, the NHTSA does not conduct moderate overlap crash tests.

The safety issues of the Venture and its U-body siblings would later be addressed with the Uplander in 2005, in which it earned the highest rating of &quot;Good&quot; given by the IIHS institute in the moderate overlap crash test.

<doc id="1039797" wikidata="Q57638" url="?curid=1039797" title="Jyrki Katainen">
<text>Jyrki Tapani Katainen (born 14 October 1971) is a Finnish politician who served as the European Commission&#x27;s Vice-President for Jobs, Growth, Investment and Competitiveness from 2014 until 2019. Katainen was previously prime minister of Finland from 2011 to 2014 and chairman of the National Coalition Party from 2004 to 2014. He was succeeded by Alexander Stubb as chairman of Finland&#x27;s National Coalition Party. After stepping down as prime minister, Katainen was elected as European Commission Vice-President in July 2014.

== Education and personal life ==
Katainen was born in Siilinjärvi, a town in Finland. He graduated from Siilinjärvi Senior High School in 1990. He obtained a Master&#x27;s degree in political science from the University of Tampere, spending one year at the University of Leicester as an Erasmus exchange student.

Jyrki Katainen has two children: Saara (born in 2005) and Veera (2009). In addition to Finnish, Katainen speaks English, French and Swedish. Katainen is an accomplished chef.

==Political career prior to 2011==
Katainen became involved in politics after a brief career in teaching. He was a member of the Siilinjärvi municipal council in his first political position, in 1993. He was elected member of the Finnish Parliament (Eduskunta) from the district of Northern Savonia in 1999, served as the vice-chairman of the party in 2001, and became the leader in 2004.

From 1990 to 2000, Katainen was vice president of the Youth of the European Peoples Party.

Katainen was elected vice president of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) for a three-year term in 2006 and won the second election in 2009.

In the 2007 parliamentary election, Katainen&#x27;s National Coalition was placed second. Katainen became the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister in the new cabinet with the Center, the National Coalition, Greens, and the Swedish People&#x27;s party.

As the Finance Minister, Katainen noted that Europe&#x27;s leaders must do more to prepare voters for “exit strategies” and noted that &quot;it is politically difficult but we have no choice. We have to do painful things in the coming years when economies begin to recover.&quot;

==Prime Minister (2011–2014)== 
Following the parliamentary election held on 17 April 2011, Katainen was elected Prime Minister by the new parliament and assumed office on 22 June 2011. His centre-right National Coalition Party became the largest party for the first time in the history of Finland. Following government-forming negotiations, Katainen was elected Prime Minister by the Finnish Parliament, and his government of six parties (National Coalition Party, Social Democratic Party of Finland, Left Alliance (Finland), Green League, Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland and Christian Democrats (Finland) ) was formally appointed by President Tarja Halonen on 22 June 2011.

In August 2013 Katainen invited participants representing political parties, interest groups and research institutes to a forum in Heureka science center. The forum was designed to explore the broad structural changes needed to improve Finland&#x27;s economy over the coming years. In his speech (loosely translated to English) Prime Minister Katainen concluded that &#x27;participants showed curiousness and commitment. I believe the discussions will provide an excellent basis for resolving difficult situations. We now need to take action and to address the structural reforms ahead.&#x27; 

Finland&#x27;s economic problems were apparent for many, but the government was forced to delay structural reforms because socialist parties in the six-party cabinet were opposed to the new measures. In September 2013 the six-party cabinet laid out plans for reform. However, Katainen warned that the reforms were not sufficient.
In November 2012, the government elected not to have Finland to join the team of EU countries that proposed a financial transaction tax. This was a reportedly difficult issue for the six-party government because three of the parties favored the tax.

Katainen&#x27;s views regarding the demise of Nokia may have been controversial in the international arena, however, the company has long been part of Finland&#x27;s national fabric, making it difficult to view the issue from alternative perspectives.

As Prime Minister, Katainen encouraged investment in Finland, in part because of the country&#x27;s excellent education system and political stability. He also encouraged the involvement of universities and higher education institutions in civil society in order to increase the country&#x27;s competitiveness in the national arena.

According to Katainen&#x27;s blog there was hope in the future for Finland&#x27;s economy. For example, he highlighted Google’s investment of about 800 million Euros in Hamina, Russian data center Yandex’s investment in Mäntsälä and Microsoft’s plans for investing about 250 million in Finland. But he noted that Finland was still losing more jobs than those that were being created.

In November 2013, Katainen said &quot;Finland needs more direct foreign investment to accelerate the economy and increase growth and employment. The government approved the strategy for attracting national investment last December. The strategy emphasis the ICT sector, including data centres, as a core area.&quot;

===European Union===
In his position as Prime Minister, Katainen recommended that European leaders rebuild the unity of the European Union because it was undermined by the euro zone debt crisis. Speaking at a Reuters Euro Zone Summit, he noted that mutual resentment between citizens of the northern creditor states and poorer debtor countries may have fuelled euroscepticism and perhaps this may have posed a threat to the 28-nation bloc&#x27;s unity.

Katainen said calls for more European involvement were unpopular at a time when globalization had made people afraid of losing their jobs and lowering their standard of living.

The enforcement of overhauled budget discipline rules and the creation of a banking union with a single supervisor and a mechanism to wind up failed banks without making taxpayers pay had achieved the main changes needed to stabilize the euro zone.

Asked whether the EU treaty should be changed in the next five years after European Parliament elections in May, Katainen said he was a pragmatist and most of what Europe needed could be achieved by strengthening and extending its internal market.

According to Katainen, the key reforms to pensions, labor markets and education needed to keep European countries competitive with the rest of the world and make its social model affordable were in the hands of national governments.

Katainen called for a single market in clean technology, noting that Finland was producing third-generation non-food biofuels that could not enter some EU countries because regulation had not kept pace with innovation.

To combat eurosceptics in the pan-European election, EU leaders should address issues that are important to voters who support populist political parties.

Regarding the recent situation in Ukraine Katainen noted that Finland would not enforce economic sanctions against Russia. He recommended that leaders and citizens remain level headed regarding the situation in Crimea. According to the Prime Minister, sanctions against Russia may negatively impact the Finnish economy.

==Vice-President of the European Commission== 

Katainen resigned as the chairman of Finland&#x27;s National Coalition Party and as the Finnish prime minister in June 2014 and was elected as European Commissioner on 16 July 2014. He was later confirmed as vice-president-designate for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness in the European Commission. Katainen&#x27;s new responsibilities as vice-president are to formulate recommendations to ensure that member states&#x27; economies are on a path of sustainable of growth and job creation, to supervise the Union&#x27;s common currency (the euro) and to produce the commission&#x27;s regular economic forecasts and economic indicators.

According to Swedish social democrat Marita Ulvskog, &quot;Katainen&#x27;s strength is that he comes from a Nordic country, and he understands the importance of strong social partners in the labor market. We cannot solve the (Euro) crisis without social dialogue, and he understands this.&quot; Katainen has been assigned the task of finding €300 billion to invest in the growth and economy of the European Union.

In a 2015 interview, the former prime minister of Finland quickly pointed out that &quot;investment is truly a golden thread that weaves together everything that we do – we need to invest in our people, in our partnerships and in our planet&quot;. This means not only &quot;giving people the skills they need for the 21st century economy&quot;, but also promoting &quot;mobility inside and outside the union, in a way that supports economic growth and social cohesion, protects against external threats and contributes to international development&quot;.

Ahead of the 2019 European Parliament election, Katainen was named among potential spitzenkandidats for the European People&#x27;s Party. However, in June 2018, Katainen announced that he was not seeking candidacy and instead was going to leave politics after the end of his term in the commission.

==Life after politics==
After leaving politics, Katainen was appointed president of SITRA for a term of five years. In June 2023, Katainen was named head of the financial group Nordea&#x27;s public affairs unit.

<doc id="1039798" wikidata="Q2098147" url="?curid=1039798" title="Bishopton, Renfrewshire">
<text>Bishopton (/bɪʃəptən/) (; ) is a village in Renfrewshire, Scotland. It is located around west of Erskine. Royal Ordnance Factory Bishopton was located on the edge of the village and is now being redeveloped as private housing into a community named Dargavel.

==History==

There was a Roman Fort at Bishopton which was discovered from aerial photographs in 1949. The fort is about 1 km (0.6 mi) west of the village. It overlooked the former ford at Dumbuck, on a flat-topped hill around above the river, allowing ready surveillance of the River Clyde. The fort at Whitemoss Farm may have been held initially from 140 to 155 A.D. Pottery with Antonine era date stamps was found at the site. The pottery and many other finds were catalogued at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow along with several coeval items like the distance slab of the Twentieth Legion from Old Kilpatrick. There was an earlier Roman fort on Barochan Hill, less than to the south-west towards Houston.
Bishopton was originally in the &quot;Parish of Erskine&quot;. The name of the village is reflected in a nearby house: &quot;Bishopton House&quot;. A famous family called the Brisbanes lived there. The house became a convent known as &quot;Good Shepherd Centre&quot; and latterly &quot;Cora Foundation&quot;.
==The former Royal Ordnance Factory site==

A large explosive manufacturing factory was once sited in Bishopton. The Royal Ordnance Factory Bishopton (ROF) was opened during World War II on farm land, acquired by compulsory purchase order. It was situated on the western side of the railway line running through Bishopton. Over of land from up to seven farms was used to build the factory. The land included Dargavel House. The southern end of the site included the majority of the land formerly used by the World War I National Filling Factory, Georgetown. The ROF was privatised in 1984, being sold to British Aerospace (now BAE Systems), which has since scaled down and shut most of the site. The factory was in use from 1915 until 2002, producing ammunition, explosives and propellants.

After privatisation, the MOD Police moved out and the former MOD Police Social Club at HolmPark, and its adjoining sports field, became part of Bishopton. The former MOD Police houses at both HolmPark and Rossland Crescent were sold off to private buyers. Bishopton&#x27;s Medical Centre was built in a corner of the sports field, opposite the shops.
===Dargavel Village===

In 2005, BAE Systems and Redrow submitted proposals to use a large part of the site for building new housing which would, at least, double the size of Bishopton. Local residents indicated their concern at the proposals; the major concerns they had were with the size of the expansion – with the associated knock-on effects to the local infrastructure – and fears of the contamination that was likely to be found on the site. In December 2008 Renfrewshire Council granted outline planning consent for the development and detailed planning consent for a related motorway junction off the A8/M8.

By early 2016, following extensive decontamination work, a significant portion of the development had been completed, with a number of the houses (the total number of planned dwellings having risen from 2,500 in 2008 to 4,000 in 2019, involving multiple housebuilders) built and inhabited along with some shopping facilities. Construction of the housing is ongoing and the development is confirmed to include 4,000 new homes. The site is being developed by a consortium of different private builders.

Work on a new satellite health and doctors facility for the village commenced in May 2024.

==Education==

Bishopton Primary School – a co-educational, non-denominational state school – was the only first primary school within the village.

A new, second, primary school which was originally approved in 2009 had still not been completed a decade on and was reassessed to be built in 2021 with fresh concerns over the proposed catchment zone potentially leading to division between the old and new communities in the area, and that the school would simply be too small to cope with the ongoing influx of children, with the majority of the Dargavel housing being marketed for young families to move there. Dargavel Primary School was however opened in January 2022.

A third primary school, also in Dargavel, is set to open in summer 2027. In July 2024, it was announced focus groups were to take place on the development of a new school to be built on land located at the north end of Craigton Drive.

For secondary education, the village falls within the catchment area of Park Mains High School in Erskine, and within the catchment of Trinity High School in Renfrew, as part of Scotland&#x27;s network of Catholic educational institutions.

Bishopton is located around from the southern end of the Erskine Bridge, which spans the River Clyde between Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire. Before the bridge was built, the Erskine Ferry transported vehicles across the Clyde. The A8 road passes through Bishopton, and the M8 motorway passes to the north, running parallel to the A8, with access to Bishopton from junctions 30 and 31. Bus services are provided by McGill&#x27;s, with buses operating to Clydebank, Greenock and Erskine.

Bishopton is served by Bishopton railway station on the Inverclyde Line. The station opened in 1841. There are five services per hour (off-peak): four to/from Gourock, and one to/from Wemyss Bay with four per hour in the other direction to and from Glasgow Central. Evenings and Sundays there are two trains per hour to Glasgow Central and hourly services to both Wemyss Bay and Gourock. A short branch to the former ROF factory is now disused.

Bishopton is north-west of Glasgow Airport.

==Geography==
Bishopton is situated in the north east of Renfrewshire. It lies to the south of the River Clyde. The village borders a number of nearby settlements, some separated by a rural hinterland. It is about north-west of Paisley and around above sea level. In terms of address names, Bishopton has Crescents, Roads and Drives, but no Streets.

<text>Rørvik is a town and administrative centre in Nærøysund Municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. It is on the eastern side of the Vikna archipelago on the island of Inner-Vikna. The town has a population (2024) of 3,743 and a population density of .
There are several museums in Rørvik. The Norwegian Coastal Museum, with its center for coastal culture and vessel protection, is located here. The critically acclaimed museum building &quot;Norveg&quot; was designed by the architect Guðmundur Jónsson. Rørvik is also home to the Ytre Namdal Upper Secondary School, Ytre Namdal Vocational School for maritime education and the Safety Center Rørvik which offers safety training for seafarers. 

Old Rørvik church from 1896 burned to the ground in 2012, and new Rørvik Church, designed by the architectural firm Pir2, was consecrated on 22 December 2019. There is a hotel (Kysthotellet) and an apartment hotel (Rørvik rorbuer) in Rørvik. Prior to 2020, the town served as the administrative centre of the old Vikna Municipality. 

== Geography ==
The town is located in the northwestern part of Trøndelag county in central Norway, approximately north of the city of Trondheim ( by road). Rørvik lies at the eastern part of the Vikna archipelago, on the Inner-Vikna island at the western shore of the Nærøysundet strait, facing the mainland on the eastern shore of the strait. The climate is maritime, and many private gardens have plum and apple trees even here at a latitude of 65°N.

== History ==

This area was early settled, and there are several prehistoric burial mounds. Among the rocky slopes and cliffs on the islands are many surprisingly lush lowland fields, and farming and fishing were the traditional ways of life, as they partly still are.

At the census in 1701, there were only four households in Rørvik. When the state established a postal and passenger route in northern Norway in 1838 served by steamships, they were dispatched at Kråkøya, which is located north of Rørvik. When Rørvik became a shuttle provider in 1859, the merchant on Kråkøya wanted a shuttle provider to be established on the east side of the strait in Nærøy Municipality, but the municipal council of the municipality did not agree to it, instead they recommended that the port of call for the steamships be moved to Rørvik, something that happened in 1863. The post office was also moved there in 1866. Rørvik thus grew up as a town connected to the sea and communications. In addition, there was a trading post with merchants such as Johan Berg and Paul Anzjøn and somewhat later the Holand and Fossaa families as the largest merchants. The state withdrew from steamship traffic in the 1860s and private shipping companies took over with boats built for freight traffic. Rørvik was called at by Hurtigruten from the start in 1893. In addition, there were a number of accommodation and restaurants. The Czech author and journalist Karel Čapek described the place in transit in 1936: &quot;Rørvik, the first small town on an island; inhabited by a number of small wooden houses, including three hotels, ten cafes and an editorial office for the local newspaper.&quot;

The subsidy schemes for the establishment of new small farms in Norway contributed to several of the islands in Vikna Municipality being populated as late as the 1930s. A few years later, in 1947, the first of the families moved from Ytter-Vikna to Rørvik. The migration flow that occurred in the years that followed fell into three categories: those who moved completely out of the district and traveled to one of the industrial sites; those who moved to Rørvik and got work there; and those who moved to Rørvik, but continued to fish in the areas they came from. Before 1955, only Rørvik had access to electricity from a public electricity supplier, and the power lines became decisive for much of the settlement. The development of the road network, distance to public services such as schools, and relocation grants and offers of building-ready plots in Rørvik, were also important reasons why people moved.

The opening of the mainland connection at Fylkesvei 770 and Rørvik Airport, Ryum in the 1970s and 1980s laid the foundation for a new upswing in trade and service industries in Rørvik. In the 1970s, the first experiments with aquaculture also began in the region, which already during the 1980s and 1990s became an important industry.

==Economy==
The port of Rørvik is the largest port facility in Central Norway with over 15,000 ship calls each year. Rørvik is also a port of call for a number of cruise ships. Significant industries are ship-related industry, fishing, and commercial salmon fish farming. Some work in public service. Telenor is an employer (as of 2024).

==Transportation==
Rørvik is a port of call of the Hurtigruten coastal steamer, and the northbound and southbound ships meet in Rørvik in the evening. 

Vikna has been accessible by car from the mainland since 1981 when the Nærøysund Bridge and Marøysund Bridge on Norwegian County Road 770 was completed. There are bus routes to Namsos, Brønnøysund, and Grong (train station). The speedboat Namdalingen runs three times daily to town of Namsos, the regional center. 

Rørvik Airport, Ryum is located just south of Rørvik, and it serves the region of Ytre Namdalen. 

==Culture==
The Coastal Museum Norveg, with a center for coastal culture and ship protection, is located in Rørvik. The critically acclaimed museum building was designed by the architect Guðmundur Jónsson. The museum also owns Berggården in the center of Rørvik, and together with Nærøysund municipality they manage most of the historically important buildings in the vacated fishing village of Sør-Gjæslingan. The Sør-Gjæslingan fishery consists of approx. 80 islands, islets and reefs. In its time, this was one of the largest and most important fishing villages south of Lofoten, where several thousand fishermen could gather during the season. Sør-Gjæslingan was protected as a national cultural environment in October 2010. It is possible to go on a day trip to Sør-Gjæslingan by boat, and it is possible to spend the night there in simple rorbues. For those who come with their own boat, it is possible to dock at the guest quay at Flatholmen.
The display center for aquaculture is a collaboration between Kystmuseet Norveg and SalmoNor AS and conveys the development of the modern Norwegian aquaculture industry. In the permanent exhibition in Norveg, there is a section on aquaculture and it is also possible to join a boat trip to a modern salmon farm. The sea-based part is with the viewing boat MS Sunniva, which has regular viewing trips in the summer. These trips go to a modern aquaculture facility where guides are responsible for tours of the facility, and it is possible to experience the salmon up close.

The Skreifestivalen, a festival of food and coastal culture, has been organized in Rørvik every year since 1998. During the Skreifestivalen, the spectacular outdoor walking theater &quot;Rørvik... the first small town on an island..&quot;, which is a central part of the presentation, is shown every year of the coastal culture. Then the lights go out in the city centre, and a dormant hundred-year history is brought to life with all its ingredients of magic, charm, joy and sorrow! This is a somewhat unusual city walk, with a walking theater that stages the history of an entire small coastal town in 1907.

Rørvikdagan with music festival, martna, fun fair and other activities is organized every year in July

<doc id="1039807" wikidata="Q111945239" url="?curid=1039807" title="Directional Infrared Counter Measures">
<text>Directional Infrared Counter Measures (DIRCM) are a class of anti-missile systems produced to protect aircraft from infrared homing missiles, primarily MANPADS and similar simple systems.

Earlier infrared countermeasures like flares or hot block systems that produce random flashes of IR light are semi- or omnidirectional. This results in the missile seeker receiving relatively little IR energy due to the inverse square law. DIRCM systems instead aim their IR output directly at the missile using some source of tracking information and a trainable emitter. This allows a relatively small device to overwhelm the missile seeker by focusing all of its output on it.

Examples are produced by many aerospace companies, such as 
Aselsan, Leonardo S.p.A., Elbit Systems, Northrop Grumman, ITT Corporation, and BAE Systems. A Russian example is the 101KS-O.

==Method of operation==

The systems use an effective method of jamming infrared missile seekers through the sensor aperture and can be placed in either active or standby mode. In the standby mode, the aircrew must select the active mode to begin jamming infrared (IR) threats. The pulsing flashes of IR energy confuse the missile guidance system, preventing the tracking of the target aircraft.

== Systems ==

===AN/AAQ-24===
The AN/AAQ-24 system is a directional infrared countermeasure (DIRCM) system. It consists of a missile warning system (AN/AAR-54), an integration unit, a processor, and laser turrets (Small Laser Transmitter Assembly, SLTA). Early versions of this system used an arc lamp to generate the jammer signal. The newer versions of this system manufactured by Northrop Grumman use diode-based laser pumping systems known by the name GUARDIAN. These systems are intended for potential fitting to commercial carriers pending the completion of multiple tests on the viability of such options.

The AN/AAQ-24 system is installed in the Northrop Grumman Guardian system marketed for commercial aircraft. The system will be installed by 2025 on C-17 Globemaster III, MC-130, CV-22 Osprey, and the CH-53E Super Stallion. In 2010, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced to Congress a possible sale to Canada of eight AN/AAQ-24(V) DIRCMs including equipment and services for a total value of up to US$72 million. Other material and services would include publications and technical documentation, personnel training and training equipment, U.S. Government (USG) and contractor engineering, technical and logistics support services.

Large Aircraft Infrared Counter-Measure system (LAIRCM) was a US Military requirement for protecting its large aircraft from infrared-guided missiles. The AN/AAQ-24 Nemesis system was produced to serve this requirement.

LAIRCM-Lite is a C-17 program that uses a combination of laser jamming DIRCM and flares due to the limited availability of LAIRCM components.

===101KS-O===
The 101KS-O is a DIRCM system mounted on the Sukhoi Su-57 fighter jet. It has sensors that are placed in turrets, which are mounted on two points: the dorsal spine and the forward fuselage under the cockpit. It uses modulated laser-based countermeasures to confuse or destroy incoming missiles&#x27; tracking mechanisms. The 101KS-O is the first DIRCM that is deployed on any fighter aircraft.

<text>Ratcliffe College is a coeducational Catholic private boarding and day school near the village of Ratcliffe on the Wreake, Leicestershire, approximately from Leicester, England. The college, situated in of parkland on the Fosse Way about six miles (10 km) north of Leicester, was founded on the instructions of Blessed Father Antonio Rosmini-Serbati in 1845 as a seminary. In 1847, the buildings were converted for use as a boarding school for upper-class boys. The college became coeducational under the presidency of Father Tony Baxter in the mid-1970s. As of the 2023-2024 academic years, there were 920 students on roll at Ratcliffe, from ages 3 to 18.

The school buildings were designed by the Victorian Gothic revivalist Augustus Welby Pugin. Pugin, who is associated with Catholic architecture throughout the Midlands and north of England, is also noted for his collaboration with Charles Barry in the reconstruction of the Palace of Westminster. The Square was designed by Charles Francis Hansom, brother of Joseph Hansom, the designer of the Hansom cab. Various building works over the years have contributed to Pugin and Hansom&#x27;s work, and modern buildings include a &quot;new&quot; gothic refectory (constructed in the early years of the twentieth century) and a Byzantine-style church.

==Management==
The school, operated by Rosmini&#x27;s Institute of Charity, used to use the title &quot;Father President&quot; for the most senior member of staff who, up until 1996, was always a Father of the Institute. In 1996, the school appointed its first lay President, Tim Kilbride, and the position was renamed Headmaster. He was succeeded in 2000 by Peter Farrar and then in 2009 by Gareth Lloyd. Its current Headmaster is Mr Jonathan Reddin who took up the post in January 2017.

===Former Presidents and Headmasters===
* Father Peter Hutton IC 1851 – 1880

=== Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) ===
Ratcliffe College is regularly inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI). This is the body approved by the Department of Education for the purpose of inspecting schools belonging to Independent Schools Council (ISC) Associations and reporting on compliance with independent school regulations.

The School received Excellent report in all areas, during the latest ISI Inspection, 2022 - Focused Compliance and Educational Quality Inspection. The Educational Quality Inspection reports on the quality of the College’s work. It focuses on two key outcomes:

1. The achievement of the students, including their academic development.
2. The personal development of the students.

The College was judged “Excellent” for both outcomes, the highest grade possible.

===Partnership with Leicester City Football Club===
Ratcliffe College has a partnership with the Leicester City Football Club Academy Programme. Academy players complete their GCSE programme studying and boarding at Ratcliffe College in Years 10 and 11.

==Cricket ground==
The college cricket ground is used by the college cricket team. The first recorded use of the ground came in 1948, when Ratcliffe College played King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham. The ground has also played host to a single List-A match, when the Leicestershire Cricket Board played Denmark in the 1st round of the 2003 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy which was played in 2002.

==Notable former pupils==
Former pupils of Ratcliffe are known as Old Ratcliffians. They include:

<text>The Pontiac Montana (also Pontiac Montana SV6) is a minivan that was sold by Pontiac from the 1997 to 2009 model years. The successor to the Pontiac Trans Sport, the nameplate was introduced in 1997 as a trim package for its predecessor. For 1999, Pontiac introduced the Montana as a distinct model line (2000 in Canada). Initially marketed between the Chevrolet Venture and the Oldsmobile Silhouette, the model line was later slotted between the Chevrolet Uplander, Saturn Relay, and Buick Terraza. 

Styled as the most &quot;rugged&quot; of the GM minivans, the Montana was styled with two-tone lower body cladding evoking the design of SUVs, with the second-generation Montana SV6 (introduced for 2005) adopting more aggressive exterior styling and optional all-wheel drive. The SV6 was discontinued in the United States after 2006 (following slow sales), with Pontiac continuing to sell the model line in Canada and Mexico through 2009 (a year before the closure of Pontiac). Since the introduction of the original &quot;Dustbuster&quot; generation, Pontiac Trans Sports and Montanas were the most popular minivans among consumers in Canada. 

General Motors assembled the Pontiac Montana alongside its divisional counterparts at its Doraville Assembly (Doraville, Georgia) facility, which closed on September 26, 2008. The Montana was not replaced within Pontiac in either the United States or Canada. As the GMT200 platform was replaced by the fullsize GM Lambda CUVs, the GMC Acadia served as the closest successor. 

==First generation (1997)==

The Montana nameplate was first used as a trim level of the Pontiac Trans Sport minivan for the 1997–1998 model years. GM dropped the Trans Sport name in 1998 for MY1999 (1999 for MY2000 in Canada respectively) and the van simply became Montana. It was related to the Chevrolet Venture, the Oldsmobile Silhouette, the Opel/Vauxhall Sintra, and the first generation Buick GL8.

The Opel and Vauxhall models were only sold in Europe, even though they were made in the same factory in the U.S. as with the other U-body minivans. Chevrolet also introduced a nearly identical twin to Pontiac save for its badging for European consumers, named as the Chevrolet Trans Sport. The 2000–2010 GL8 is similar to the first-generation Pontiac Montana, while the 2010–2016 GL8 and 2005–2016 GL8 First Land is similar to the later Pontiac Montana SV6. Both generations of the Buick GL8 minivans were only sold in China.

Despite the redesign of the Montana as the Montana SV6 in 2005, Pontiac continued to sell the original body style for the 2005 model year for fleet use. The last Montana rolled off the production line in September 2004.

===Chassis===

The Pontiac Montana is based on the GMT200 platform (aka &quot;U-body&quot; in VIN designations), used by the Venture, Silhouette, Sintra, and the first-generation GL8. The new platform uses a unibody type chassis as opposed to the older, uniquely-designed space frame type chassis used in the GMT199 platform minivans. The short wheelbase version measured 112-inches, while the long wheelbase version measured 120-inches. The minivan uses disk brakes for the front wheels and drum brakes for the rear wheels, and uses front MacPherson struts with rear coil over springs.

====Powertrain details====

The Pontiac Montana continues to use the 3.4 L V6 engine from the second-generation Pontiac Trans Sport. A four-speed automatic transmission continues to be offered as standard equipment.

===Body===

The Pontiac Montana was designed with a more conventional (and conservative) styling reminiscent of the third-generation Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth minivans, moving away from the &quot;Dustbuster&quot; look of the previous generation U-body minivans. It came in both short and long wheelbase versions. It was initially produced with single or dual sliding doors when it was introduced as a trim level in MY1997, however dual sliding doors would become standard by 1998 when the van became Montana for MY1999. The B-pillars continued to be colored in black in most color choices but were also made as the same color as the body in some color choices.

The interior remained largely the same as the second-generation Trans Sport, including the steering wheel, instrument cluster, and the like. Three seating configurations were available, with eight-passenger (2-3-3) and seven-passenger versions (2-2-3, 2-3-2) being offered. Second-row modular seats with hidden child restraints were available in 2-3-3, 2-3-2, and 2-2-3 configurations, while the rear bench seats (split or full-length) were offered in 2-2-3 configurations. The Pontiac Montana (as well as other U-body minivans) was one of the few minivans which provided seating for eight. The seats were offered in both cloth and leather surfaces, with the latter being an option. New for this generation were cabin air filters, which can be easily accessed from behind an access panel inside the glove compartment. OnStar continues to be offered as an option.

====Later model years====


There were two door/ignition warning chimes that were
used in the Montana during MY1999, one that was the same one found in the second-generation Trans Sport/Trans Sport Montana and the other was a different-sounding one used in other models.

For 2000, the different-sounding door/ignition warning chime offered in MY1999 was adopted for all models. The instrument cluster was also redesigned as well. No other changes were made to the exterior and interior of the vehicle.

For 2001, the Montana received a minor facelift, with a new front bumper and split grille design, the red markers on the rear bumpers being removed, the B-pillars becoming body-colored as opposed to black in most cases, and a new steering wheel that has, among others, removed the audio control buttons and the &quot;PONTIAC&quot; lettering on the airbag replaced with the Pontiac logo.

For 2003, the sport-style head restraints were dropped in favor of the conventional head restraints that were offered on the Venture and Silhouette. The anti-lock brakes became optional for the Montana as well as for the Venture, but remained as standard equipment for the Silhouette before the demise of the Oldsmobile brand in 2004. A new steering wheel with a completely different design than the previous one was also introduced.

===Trim===

The standard trim was simply named as the Montana. In contrast to the Trans Sport Montana, which exclusively featured grey/tan body cladding, the Montana offered both monochrome and grey/tan body cladding for all colors. Two rim choices for the wheels continued to be offered. A Montana GT trim came in later in the early 2000s.


The Montana Thunder was introduced in 2002 as the most up-level model of the Montana. It featured special &quot;Thunder&quot; badging, Thunder-specific 16&quot; chrome 5-spoke wheels, upgraded ride and handling package, and a special spoiler on the back of the roof rack. Inside, it had special two-tone black and grey leather seating, and a perforated leather-wrapped steering wheel. Prior to its introduction in 2002, the Montana Thunder nameplate was first used on a 1998 minivan concept showcased at the 1998 North American International Auto Show.

The Thunder trim package was produced in 2002 and 2003, however it was made as an optional package on Montana GTs in 2004 called the &quot;Chrome-Sport&quot; package. Only the &quot;Thunder&quot; badges were discontinued.

There were some rare AWD Versatrak versions made in 2002 and 2003 alongside the Montana Thunder. These trim packages were mostly identical to the 2002–2003 Montana Thunder apart from the headrests, which were made in a different design.

===Safety criticism===

In 1996, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tested a 1997 Pontiac Trans Sport among other minivans of the time. The minivan suffered extreme damage to the vehicle in the moderate overlap crash test, which has resulted in some criticism by contemporary reviewers. The minivan received a &quot;Poor&quot; rating and was ranked as the &quot;Worst Performing Vehicle&quot; by the institute as a result. This status was also applied to the Chevrolet Venture and the Oldsmobile Silhouette as they both use the same chassis and body design, including the later first-generation Pontiac Montana.

Some comments made by the IIHS after the first test in 1996 were:
* Major collapse of the occupant compartment left little survival space for the driver.
* Extreme steering wheel movement snapped the dummy&#x27;s head backward.
* The unnatural position of the dummy&#x27;s left foot indicates that an occupant&#x27;s left leg would have been seriously injured in a real-world crash of this severity.
* The forces on the left lower leg were so high that the dummy&#x27;s metal foot broke off at the ankle.

In a semi-related event, the Trans Sport/Montana&#x27;s European equivalent, the Opel/Vauxhall Sintra, also fared badly in Euro NCAP&#x27;s frontal impact crash test on a 1998 model year minivan, made worse by the steering wheel (and airbag) breaking off from the dashboard (a phenomenon that was not present in the IIHS test). Despite performing well in the side impact test, it rated 2.5 stars as a result.

The safety issues of the Trans Sport/Montana and its U-body siblings were later addressed with the Montana SV6 (and the related Uplander), which earned the highest rating of &quot;Good&quot; given by the institute in the moderate overlap crash test.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the van 4 stars for driver protection and 3 stars for passenger protection in the frontal impact test. In the side impact test, it received 5 stars for front passenger protection, and 5 stars rear passenger protection. This applies to all other second-generation U-body minivans.

== Second generation (2005) ==

For the 2005 model year, the Montana was restyled with a higher, SUV-like front clip, with a name change to Montana SV6. The 2005 Montana SV6 used a 3.5 L High Value 3500 LX9 V6 that generated and . For 2006, a 3.9 L LZ9 V6, with 240 hp (179 kW) and 240 lb·ft (332 Nm) torque, was added as an option, and the vehicle added GM badges to the front doors. For 2007, the 3.5 L V6 was dropped, leaving the 3.9 L as the base engine. Consequently, the optional AWD system was also dropped, since it could not handle the torque of the 3.9 L engine. A flex-fuel version of the 3.9 L V6 also became available for the SV6 in 2007, exclusively in Canada and Mexico.

Similar to the Chevrolet Uplander, Saturn Relay, and Buick Terraza, it was the second-costliest of its cousins. In the United States and Mexico only the long-wheelbase version was sold.

In Mexico, the Montana continued until the 2009 model year, with the 3.9 L V6 as the only engine option. General Motors marketed it as the Pontiac Montana SV6, and it was almost identical to the discontinued US version, but different from the Canadian-specification model. In some parts of Canada, unsold 2009 models were sold as 2010 models. Some of these were also adapted as city taxis in Toronto and Montreal starting in 2010.

==Discontinuation==
On November 21, 2005, GM announced that it would close the Doraville, Georgia assembly plant, which produced the SV6, in 2008. However, several months later, GM announced that the SV6 would be discontinued after 2006 in the US due to poor sales, while production for both Canada and Mexico would continue because the SV6 sold better in those markets. The last SV6 for the U.S. market rolled off the assembly line on July 7, 2006. Production ended for Canada and Mexico with the 2009 model year, with the demise of the Pontiac brand a year later and the closing of the Doraville, Georgia plant on September 26, 2008. The last vehicle built was a Canadian-bound Montana SV6 SWB with roof rack in Liquid Silver Metallic. It was delivered to the Marvin Starr dealership in Scarborough, Ontario.

There has been no direct replacements for the Montana SV6, due to the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand in 2010.

<doc id="1039832" wikidata="Q1071229" url="?curid=1039832" title="Chevrolet Lumina APV">
<text>The Chevrolet Lumina APV is a minivan that was produced by the Chevrolet division of General Motors. Launched as the first front-wheel drive minivan sold by Chevrolet, the Lumina APV was sold in a single generation from the 1990 to 1996 model years. Marketed alongside the Pontiac Trans Sport and Oldsmobile Silhouette, the Lumina APV competed against the Dodge Grand Caravan/Plymouth Grand Voyager, the extended-length Ford Aerostar, and the Mazda MPV.

Introduced a year before the second-generation Chrysler minivans, the Lumina APV was the first American-market minivan to adopt the form factor of the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager. Though manufactured on a model-specific chassis, the Lumina APV was front-wheel drive, deriving its powertrain from GM sedans. In terms of size, the Lumina APV was slotted between the Chevrolet Astro and full-size Chevrolet Van.

During its production, the Lumina APV and its Pontiac and Oldsmobile counterparts were assembled at the North Tarrytown Assembly facility, becoming the final vehicles produced there prior to its closure. For 1997, Chevrolet adopted a distinct nameplate for its front-wheel drive minivan, replacing the Lumina APV with the Chevrolet Venture.   

== Background ==
In response to the first-generation Chrysler minivans, General Motors introduced the rear-wheel drive Chevrolet Astro (and GMC Safari) for the 1985 model year. Sized closely to the short-wheelbase Chevrolet Van, the Astro was marketed in both passenger and cargo van configurations.

In 1986, GM unveiled the Pontiac Trans Sport concept vehicle, largely serving as a preview of the APV model lines. While far more radical in body design, the 1986 Trans Sport concept was the first minivan to adopt the front-wheel drive form factor used by the Chrysler minivans. This concept would eventually be put into production as the first-generation GMT199 (U) platform minivans, although some design elements from the concept were not utilized on the production models.

In contrast to the Astro/Safari, which used a variety of components from Chevrolet/GMC light trucks, the front-wheel drive GMT199 platform (also known as the U platform) was dedicated to the Chevrolet, Pontiac, and Oldsmobile minivans, sharing primarily engines and transmissions with other GM vehicles. In place of the official GMT199 platform designation, GM began to use the APV name, standing for All Purpose Vehicle. Chevrolet would receive the Lumina APV, Oldsmobile would receive the Silhouette, and Pontiac adopted the Trans Sport name from the 1986 concept van.

During its development, the APV model lines largely benchmarked the extended-length Chrysler vans, closely matching their length, width, and height (on a shorter wheelbase). To expand its market potential (and to mitigate any potential model overlap), GM sought to make distinct marketing objectives for each model lines. The Lumina APV was to compete directly with the higher-volume Voyager/Caravan, serving as a &quot;volume leader&quot;, the Trans Sport was to be the sporty minivan equivalent of sporty Pontiac sedans, and the luxury-trim Silhouette was intended as a more contemporary competitor to the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Ford Aerostar Eddie Bauer.

== Model overview ==
At the time of its 1990 release, the Lumina APV was marketed as a bodystyle of the Chevrolet Lumina model line. For the 1989 model year, Chevrolet introduced the Lumina, effectively consolidating the Celebrity and Monte Carlo into a single model line, with the Lumina APV replacing the Celebrity station wagon. 

At its 1990 introduction, the Lumina APV was offered in two trim levels; a base trim and an up-level CL trim. There was also the Chevrolet APV cargo van, a two-seater commercial vehicle. Base-trim versions featured red exterior trim while CL versions were produced with chrome exterior trim. For 1993, the CL trim was renamed LS; the Lumina APV badging was removed from the doors. For 1994, the model underwent a mid-cycle revision and was renamed the Chevrolet Lumina Minivan (in place of the APV suffix). The final vans rolled off the assembly line on June 27, 1996. 

=== Chassis specification ===
The Chevrolet Lumina APV is a GM U-body vehicle, using the GMT199 platform designation. In contrast to the unibody design used by the Astro/Safari and the Van/Vandura, the Lumina APV chassis uses a chassis design similar to the Pontiac Fiero and Saturn SL, with a galvanized steel spaceframe supporting exterior body panels. The Lumina APV has a 109.8 inch wheelbase, sized between the Lumina sedan/coupe and the Astro/Safari.

In line with the Chrysler minivans, the Lumina APV was fitted with independent front suspension with MacPherson struts. The rear beam axle was fitted with coil springs (the only other minivan besides the Ford Aerostar and Renault Espace at the time). As an option, Chevrolet offered the Lumina APV with load-leveling rear air springs, utilizing the air compressor that inflated the rear air springs for auxiliary use with an air hose kit. The front brakes were vented discs, with drum brakes at the rear; anti-lock braking (ABS) was introduced for 1992. During 1994, traction control was introduced as an option (with the 3.8L V6).

==== Powertrain ====
Upon its 1990 release, the Lumina APV was powered by a 3.1L V6, producing ; a 3-speed automatic was the sole transmission offering. For 1992, a 3.8-liter V6 became an option, introduced with a 4-speed automatic. For 1996, both engines were replaced by a 3.4-liter V6; the 3-speed automatic was discontinued.

=== Body design ===

==== Exterior ====
Distinguished by its large windshield and sloped hoodline, the Lumina APV was of a &quot;one-box&quot; design, a configuration similar to the Ford Aerostar and Renault Espace. In line with the Aerostar and Chrysler minivans, the Lumina APV was configured with a single sliding door and a rear liftgate. Closely matching the 1987-1990 Chrysler &quot;Grand&quot; minivans in length, width, and height, the Lumina APV is nearly lower than the Astro and narrower.

Coinciding with the use of a galvanized steel spaceframe (in place of a conventional unit-body design), the Lumina APV was fitted with composite plastic (SMC) body panels. Developed for the Pontiac Fiero and later expanded in use for the Saturn SL, the manufacturing technique largely eliminated the threat of corrosion and damage from minor dents and dings. The manufacturing also allowed GM to style the Lumina APV separately from its Pontiac and Oldsmobile counterparts at low cost; each model line is externally distinguished by its hood and front fascia.

Along from its front fascia, the Lumina APV is distinguished from its Pontiac and Oldsmobile counterparts in the styling of its roof. From the B-pillar to the windshield, the roof was painted black; on examples with tinted glass, this design was to mimic the style of the glass roof from the 1986 Trans Sport concept. The Trans Sport had its entire roof painted black (with the exception of a band joining the B-pillars) again mirroring the glass roof of the 1986 concept, whereas the Silhouette had body-color A-pillars and black B-pillars. Two-tone versions of the Lumina APV were available; an early configuration featured a blacked-out upper body. For 1992, Chevrolet standardized the folding sideview mirrors of the CL trim.

For the 1994 model year, the Lumina APV underwent an exterior revision, shortening the front overhang by nearly three inches. Largely intended to visually shorten the angle of the hoodline, the Lumina Minivan (dropping the APV suffix) was given a new hood, larger grille, and much larger headlights (shared with the Pontiac Bonneville SSEi). 15-inch wheels became standard, with the LS offering a (restyled) version of the 16-inch wheels of the Beretta Z26. The roof was restyled slightly, adopting painted A-pillars and a full-length body-color roof. Additionally, a center high-mount stop lamp (CHMSL) was added to the liftgate. As the APV&#x27;s taillamps were mounted in the D-pillars, the CHMSL ended up being the lowest-situated of the three brake lamps. For this model year, the Lumina APV (and its counterparts) introduced a power-operated sliding door via remote control, the first American-market minivan to offer this design. They were originally planned to debut in the 1993 model year but failed to do so because of numerous quality control problems, which delayed the production of this feature until the 1994 model year.

==== Interior ====
Distinguished from its counterparts by trim, the interior design of the Lumina APV was centered around its modular rear seating system. Four configurations were offered: a two-seat cargo van, a five-seat passenger layout (2+3), six seats (2+2+2), and seven seats (2+3+2). In contrast to removable rear bench seats (a design derived from full-size vans), the 34-pound rear seats of the Lumina APV were individually removable and each seatback folded flat. To supplement the cupholders of the interior, each seatback was fitted with two built-in cupholders. As part of the 1994 revision, 7-passenger versions were offered with the option of integrated child seats. For 1996, the five and six-passenger configurations were deleted.

While sharing most of its dashboard design with the Trans Sport/Silhouette, the Lumina APV featured its own instrument panel design (derived from the Corsica). As a consequence of its sloped windshield design, the depth of the dashboard of the Lumina APV (and its counterparts) was among the highest ever seen in a mass-produced automobile. For 1991, the dashboard padding was revised to address complaints about glare. For 1992, the external radio antenna was replaced by an integrated design mounted between the headliner and the roof. The 1994 revision brought an update to the instrument panel, lower dashboard (and center console controls), and introduced a driver-side airbag (replacing the steering wheel of the Lumina Z34 with one from the Camaro).

== Variants ==

=== Cargo van ===
From mid-1990 to 1996, Chevrolet produced the Lumina APV as a cargo van, known simply as APV (no Lumina badging was used on the exterior). Slotted below the Astro/Safari, the cargo van competed against the Grand Caravan C/V. While sharing an identical body with its passenger-van counterpart, Chevrolet deleted the rear interior of the cargo van to include a flat rubber-mat floor; the rear glass windows were replaced by body-color plastic panels bonded in place. The cargo space held and the max cargo capacity was .

Of the three GMT199/APV vans, only Chevrolet offered a cargo van configuration.

=== Chinese clone ===
Chevrolet marketed the Lumina APV in China from 1993 to 1996, selling a number of examples in the country. In 1996, Jiangsu Nushen Automobile (Nushen) debuted the Nushen JB6500. While nearly identical in dimensions and exterior design, the JB6500 is a rear-wheel drive vehicle, powered by an Chrysler-designed 2.2-liter inline-four, paired to a 5-speed manual transmission. In 2001, Nushen ended production of the JB6500.

<doc id="1039837" wikidata="Q56291397" url="?curid=1039837" title="White Crane Journal">
<text>White Crane Journal was a quarterly magazine for exploring and enhancing gay wisdom, spirituality, and culture, published from 1989 to 2010. It was a non-profit publication supported entirely by the subscriptions of its readers. It was headquartered in San Francisco.

==History==
The &quot;White Crane Newsletter&quot; was created by Robert Barzan, a former Jesuit priest, in the Summer of 1989, and later renamed the &quot;White Crane Journal&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s initial goal was to explore gay spirituality. Barzan published the journal for seven years.

In 1996, Barzan passed the journal on to Toby Johnson and became publisher emeritus. Johnson published &quot;White Crane Journal&quot; for seven years, converting it to a digital format. Johnson, in turn, handed over publishing responsibilities to Bo Young, previously a poetry editor and associate editor for the quarterly.

Bo Young invited Dan Vera share the work of publishing &quot;White Crane&quot;, where they intended to continue a forum of discussion and sharing in the 21st century in the spirit of the Heart Circles they learned from Harry Hay, where they met.

==Final status==
The journal appears to have ceased publication with &quot;White Crane&quot; number 81, the 20th Anniversary issue, released 4 January 2010.

The journal was published by the White Crane Institute, which also published books under the White Crane Books imprint. The White Crane Institute website has archived samples and table of contents from issues 31–58 (Winter 1997 – Fall 2003), and full copies of issues 69–81 (September 2006 – January 2010).

<text>The Sony Ericsson T610, released in 2003, is a mobile phone manufactured by Sony Ericsson. It was one of the first widely available mobile phones to include a built-in digital camera, Bluetooth, color screen, joystick navigation, and was a very high selling model. The T630 was a later variant.

The T610 is available in three distinct colors: &quot;Aluminium Haze&quot;, &quot;Abyss Blue&quot;, and &quot;Volcanic Red&quot;. Many customers of Sony Ericsson in the United Kingdom complained to providers about being unable to obtain the phone in any color other than Aluminium Haze, and to date it is still the most widely sold variant of the phone. The retro-style design of the phone was created by industrial designer Erik Ahlgren, and garnered appreciation in magazines, at expositions, and among buyers. The subtle curves of the body were divided vertically with thin metal or aluminum halves, which were colored. The keypad remained silver regardless of body color variation.

The T610 is a cameraphone that can take pictures in a resolution up to 288 × 352 pixels. It includes 2.5G technologies, supporting GPRS (Class 8) and HSCSD connections with Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) 2.0 capability. It supports polyphonic ringtones in MIDI, and mobile games in Java ME and Mophun formats, and comes with three games. It does not have built-in handsfree or speakerphone capabilities, however.

The latest firmware version for the T610 is R7A011.
