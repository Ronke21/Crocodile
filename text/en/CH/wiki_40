<text>The Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi), also known as the Kodiak brown bear and sometimes the Alaskan brown bear, inhabits the islands of the Kodiak Archipelago in southwest Alaska. It is one of the largest recognized subspecies or population of the brown bear, and one of the two largest bears alive today, the other being the polar bear. They are also considered by some to be a population of grizzly bears.

Physiologically and physically, the Kodiak bear is very similar to the other brown bear subspecies, such as the mainland grizzly bear (&quot;Ursus arctos horribilis&quot;) and the extinct California grizzly bear (&quot;U. a. californicus&quot;), with the main difference being size, as Kodiak bears are on average 1.5 to 2 times larger than their cousins. Despite this large variation in size, the diet and lifestyle of the Kodiak bear do not differ greatly from those of other brown bears.

Kodiak bears have interacted with humans for centuries, especially hunters and other people in the rural coastal regions of the archipelago. The bears are hunted for sport and are encountered by hunters pursuing other species. Less frequently, Kodiak bears are killed by people whose property (such as livestock) or person are threatened. In recent history there has been an increasing focus on conservation and protection of the Kodiak bear population as human activity in its range increases. The IUCN classifies the brown bear (&quot;Ursus arctos)&quot;, of which the Kodiak is a subspecies, as being of &quot;least concern&quot; in terms of endangerment or extinction, though the IUCN does not differentiate between subspecies and thus does not provide a conservation status for the Kodiak population. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game however, along with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to a lesser extent, closely monitor the size and health of the population and the number of bears hunted in the state.

==Description==

===Taxonomy===
Taxonomist C.H. Merriam was the first to recognize the Kodiak bear as a unique subspecies of the brown bear, and he named it &quot;Ursus middendorffi&quot; in honor of the celebrated Baltic naturalist, Dr. A. Th. von Middendorff. Subsequent taxonomic work merged all North American brown bears into a single species (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;). 
Genetic samples from bears on Kodiak have shown that they are most closely related to brown bears on the Alaska Peninsula and Kamchatka, Russia, and all brown bears roughly north of the US. Kodiak bears have been genetically isolated since at least the last ice age (10,000 to 12,000 years ago) and very little genetic diversity exists within the population. Although the current population is healthy, productive, and has shown no overt adverse signs of inbreeding, it may be more susceptible to new diseases or parasites than other, more diverse brown bear populations.

===Color===
Hair colors range from pale blonde to orange (typically females or bears from southern parts of the archipelago) to dark brown. Cubs will often retain a white &quot;natal ring&quot; around their neck for the first few years of life. The Kodiak bear&#x27;s color is similar to that of its close relatives, the mainland American Grizzly bear and Eurasian brown bears.

===Size===
While there is generally much variation in size between brown bears in different areas, most usually weigh between 115 and 360 kg (254 and 794 lb); the Kodiak bear illustrates island gigantism, commonly reaching sizes of . The size range for females (sows) is from , and for males (boars), it is . Mature males average over the course of the year, and can weigh up to at peak times. Females are typically about 20% smaller and 30% lighter than males, and adult sizes are attained when they are six years old. Bears weigh the least when they emerge from their dens in the spring, and can increase their weight by 20–30% during late summer and autumn. As with other animals, captive Kodiak bears can sometimes weigh considerably more than their wild counterparts.

An average adult male measures in length, and stands tall at the shoulder. The largest recorded wild male weighed , and had a hind foot measurement of . A large male Kodiak bear stands up to tall at the shoulder when it is standing on all four legs. When standing fully upright on its hind legs, a large male could reach a height of . The largest verified size for a captive Kodiak bear was for a specimen that lived at the Dakota Zoo in Bismarck, North Dakota. Nicknamed &quot;Clyde&quot;, he weighed when he died in June 1987 at the age of 22. According to zoo director Terry Lincoln, Clyde probably weighed close to a year earlier. He still had a fat layer of when he died..

Kodiak bears are the largest brown bear and are even comparable in size to polar bears. This makes Kodiak bears and polar bears both the two largest members of the bear family and the largest extant terrestrial carnivorans.

The standard method of evaluating the size of bears is by measuring their skulls. Most North American hunting organizations and management agencies use calipers to measure the length of the skull (back of sagittal crest on the back of the skull to the front tooth), and the width (maximum width between the zygomatic arches — &quot;cheek bones&quot;). The total skull size is the sum of these two measurements. The largest bear ever killed in North America was from Kodiak Island, with a total skull size of , and eight of the top 10 brown bears listed in the Boone and Crockett record book are from Kodiak. The average skull size of Kodiak bears that were killed by hunters in the first five years of the 21st century was for boars, and for sows.

Also, an individual named Teddy, which portrayed a killer bear in the movie &quot;Grizzly&quot;, stood tall on its hind legs and was the largest bear in captivity at the time.

==Life history==

===Distribution and density===
This brown bear population only occurs on the islands of the Kodiak Archipelago (Kodiak, Afognak, Shuyak, Raspberry, Uganik, Sitkalidak, and adjacent islands). The Kodiak bear population was estimated to include 3,526 bears in 2005, yielding an estimated archipelago-wide population density of 270 bears per 1000 km2 (700 per 1000 sq. mi). During the past decade, the population has been slowly increasing.

===Home range===
Bears on Kodiak are naturally active during the day, but when faced with competition for food or space, they adopt a more nocturnal (active at night) lifestyle. This behavior is especially evident in the bears that live near and within Kodiak City. Kodiak bears do not defend territories, but they do have traditional areas that they use each year (home ranges). Because of the rich variety of foods available on Kodiak, the bears on the archipelago have some of the smallest home ranges of any brown bear populations in North America and a great deal of overlap occurs among the ranges of individual bears. Home ranges of adult sows on Kodiak Island average , while boar home ranges average .

===Denning===
Kodiak bears begin entering their dens in late October. Pregnant sows are usually the first to go to dens; males are the last. Males begin emerging from their dens in early April, while sows with new cubs may stay in dens until late June. Bears living on the north end of Kodiak Island tend to have longer denning periods than bears in the southern areas. Most Kodiak bears dig their dens in hill or mountain sides and they use a wide variety of denning habitats depending on which part of the archipelago they live. Almost a quarter of the adult bears forgo denning, staying somewhat active throughout the winter.

===Reproduction and survival===
Kodiak bears reach sexual maturity at age five, but most sows are over nine years old when they successfully wean their first litter. The average time between litters is four years. Sows continue to produce cubs throughout their lives, but their productivity diminishes after they are 20 years old. Mating season for Kodiak bears is during May and June. They are serially monogamous (having one partner at a time), staying together from two days to two weeks. As soon as the egg is fertilized and divides a few times, it enters a state of suspended animation until autumn when it finally implants on the uterine wall and begins to grow again. Cubs are born in the den during January or February. Weighing less than at birth with little hair and closed eyes, they suckle for several months, emerging from the den in May or June, weighing . Typical litter sizes on Kodiak are two or three cubs, with a long-term average of 2.4 cubs per litter. However, Kodiak bears have six functional nipples and can litter up to six cubs reportedly. Sows are sometimes seen with five or six cubs in tow, probably due to adopting cubs from other litters. Most cubs stay with their mothers for three years. Almost half of the cubs die before they leave, with cannibalism by adult males being one of the major causes of death.

Kodiak bears that have recently left their mothers, at ages 3–5 years, have high mortality rates with only 56% of males and 89% of females surviving. Most young female bears stay within or near their mother&#x27;s home range, while most males move farther away. Most adult sows die of natural causes (56%), while most adult male bears are killed by hunters (91%). The oldest known male bear in the wild was 27 years old, and the oldest female was 35.

===Habitat ===
The islands of the Kodiak Archipelago have a subpolar oceanic climate with cool temperatures, overcast skies, fog, windy conditions, and moderate to heavy precipitation throughout most of the year. Although the archipelago only covers about , a rich variety of topography and vegetation ranges from dense forests of Sitka spruce on the northern islands, to steep, glaciated mountains rising to Koniag Peak&#x27;s along the central spine of Kodiak Island, to rolling hills and flat tundra on the south end of the archipelago. About 14,000 people live on the archipelago, primarily in and around the city of Kodiak and six outlying villages. Roads and other human alterations are generally limited to Afognak Island and the northeastern part of Kodiak Island. About half of the archipelago is included in the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge.

=== Feeding habits ===
Bears live throughout the archipelago, adapting to local resources and retaining relatively small home ranges and comparable densities in most habitats. With such a variety and abundance of food sources, bears are surprisingly intelligent in their eating habits. The first foods bears eat in the spring are emerging vegetation (such as grasses and forbs) and animals that may have died during the winter. This allows the bear to quickly replace the weight that was lost during hibernation. As summer progresses, a wide variety of vegetation supplies nutritional needs until salmon return. Salmon runs extend from May through September on most of the archipelago and bears consume the five species of Pacific salmon that spawn in local streams and lakes. Bears often prioritize the brain, flesh, and eggs of salmon for their high nutritional value. In the late summer and early fall, bears consume several types of berries when they reach their ripest point, and have the highest levels of sugar. As climate change causes elderberries to ripen earlier, berry season is now overlapping with salmon season and some bears are abandoning salmon runs to focus on the berries. Bears also feed on wind-rowed seaweed and invertebrates on some beaches throughout the year. When eating deer, mountain goats, elk, or cattle, internal organs are eaten first for their high-fat content, however even though there is an abundance of the animals found on the archipelago, few Kodiak bears actively prey on them as other methods of finding food are more energy efficient. Another food source available year-round is the garbage made by the human population of Kodiak Island. 

==Behavior==

The Kodiak bear is much like other brown bears in intelligence, although its tendency to feed in large dense groups leads to more complex social behaviors. Kodiak bears are generally solitary in nature; however, when food is concentrated in small areas, such as along salmon spawning streams, grass/sedge flats, berry patches, a dead whale, or even an open garbage dump, they often occur in large groups. Along a few streams on Kodiak, up to 60 bears can be seen simultaneously in a area. To maximize food intake at these ecologically important areas, bears have learned to minimize fighting and fatal interactions by developing a complex communication (both verbal and body posturing) and social structure.

===Interactions with people===
Usually, Kodiak bears attempt to avoid encounters with people. The most notable exceptions to this behavior pattern occur when bears are surprised, threatened, or attracted by human food, garbage, or hunter-killed game. However, there has been an increase in Kodiak encounters due to increases in the local population as well as increased hunting of Kodiak bears. Bear safety precautions aim at avoiding such situations, understanding bear needs and behavior, and learning how to recognize the warning signs bears give when stressed.

One fatal bear attack on a person on the Kodiak archipelago occurred in 1999. The National Geographic Society filmed a television program about brown bears, which included a segment on two brown bear attacks. Both incidents involved hunters who were hunting by themselves and were returning to game they had killed previously, and left alone in order to continue hunting. One of the attacks was fatal, with the hunter being killed by the bear, and occurred on Uganik Island (November 3, 1999), which is part of the Kodiak archipelago. In the other incident, after being attacked by the bear, the hunter stabbed it with a knife, then recovered his rifle and killed the attacking bear. This occurred on Raspberry Island, home to two full-service wilderness lodges. Prior to that, the last fatality was in 1921. About once every other year, a bear injures a person on Kodiak. In October 2021, a father and son hunting duo survived an attack from a Kodiak bear during an elk registration hunt on Afognak Island.

==History and management==
===Prehistory===
Early human occupants of the archipelago when the land was locked into the ice age looked to the sea for their sustenance. At that time, Kodiak Natives (Alutiiqs) occasionally hunted bears, using their meat for food, hides for clothing and bedding, and teeth for adornment. Traditional stories often revolved around the similarity between bears and humans, and the mystical nature of bears because of their proximity to the spirit world.

===Commercial harvests===
Russian hunters came to the area in the late 18th century to capitalize on the abundant fur resources. Bear hides were considered a &quot;minor fur&quot; and sold for about the same price as river otter pelts. The number of bears harvested increased substantially when sea otter populations declined and after the United States acquired Alaska in 1867, bear harvests on Kodiak increased, peaking at as many as 250 bears per year. Commercial fishing activities increased in the late 1880s and canneries proliferated throughout the archipelago. Bears were viewed as competitors for the salmon resource and were routinely shot when seen on streams or coasts. At the same time, sportsmen and scientists had recognized the Kodiak bear as the largest in the world, and they voiced concerns about overharvesting the population.

===Guided hunters and competition for resources===
Professional interest in guided Kodiak bear hunts and concern for unregulated resource use in frontier lands such as Alaska prompted the territorial government&#x27;s newly established Alaska Game Commission to abolish commercial bear hunting (selling the hides) on the archipelago in 1925. The impacts of the new regulations seemed to restore bear populations on the Kodiak Islands. By the 1930s, ranchers in northeast Kodiak reported an increase in bear problems and demanded action. Bears were wrongly seen as a threat to the expanding commercial salmon-fishing industry. To address the dilemma of conserving bears while protecting cattle, salmon, and people, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge by executive order in 1941. The refuge roughly encompasses the southwestern two-thirds of Kodiak Island, Uganik Island, the Red Peaks area on northwestern Afognak Island, and all of Ban Island.

Alaska achieved statehood in 1959 and assumed responsibility for managing the state&#x27;s wildlife. The Alaska Board of Game reduced bear-hunting seasons on Afognak and Raspberry Islands and on the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, but liberalized bear seasons on non-refuge lands on Kodiak. During the 1960s, state biologists worked with ranchers along the Kodiak road system to examine and reduce the predation problem. Biologists reported that cattle and bears were not compatible on the same ranges and potential solutions included poisons, fences to isolate cattle ranges, and aerial shooting of bears. Again, sport hunters voiced their support for Kodiak bears. Despite public pressure, the state continued actively pursuing and dispatching problem bears until 1970.

===Changes in land status===
In 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) resolved many long-standing land issues with Aboriginal Alaskans statewide. The impacts were felt strongly on the archipelago as large areas were conveyed to the Native corporations. Federal management of the National Forest lands on Afognak was transferred to Native Corporation ownership with the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980 (ANILCA), and the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge lost control of of prime bear habitat (more than 17% of refuge lands).

In 1975, construction of a logging road began on Afognak Island, and timber harvesting began in 1977. In 1979, work began on an environmental impact statement for the Terror Lake hydroelectric project on Kodiak Island. That project included an earthen dam on Terror Lake with Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge and a tunnel through a mountain ridge to a penstock and powerhouse in the Kizhuyak River drainage. The hydro project was the first significant invasion of inland bear habitat on Kodiak Island. To address the opposition encountered from the public and agencies, a mitigation settlement was negotiated in 1981 which included brown bear research and the establishment of the Kodiak Brown Bear Trust. The hydroelectric project was completed in 1985. Human alteration of bear habitat on Kodiak and Afognak Islands spurred renewed interest and funding for bear research on the archipelago, resulting in a surge of baseline and applied bear research on Kodiak through the 1980s and 1990s.

Bears were not directly harmed by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, although some were displaced from traditional feeding and traveling areas by cleanup crews. No one was injured by a bear, and no Kodiak bears were killed. To mitigate the adverse impacts of the spill, Exxon reached a settlement with the state and federal governments. Paradoxically, the impacts of the oil spill and the subsequent cleanup and settlement proved to be beneficial to bears on Kodiak. Bear-safety training exposed thousands of workers to factual information about bears, and money from the settlement fund was used for funding land acquisitions. By the close of the 20th century, over 80% of the refuge lands that had been lost as a result of ANCSA and ANILCA were reinstated into the refuge, either through direct purchase or utilizing conservation easements. Lands were also purchased in America, Westtown, and Shuyak Islands and transferred into state ownership. The Kodiak Brown Bear Trust coordinated a coalition of sportsmen and other wildlife conservation groups from around the nation to lobby for the use of settlement funds to acquire Kodiak lands. The groups also directly contributed funding to protect small parcels of important bear habitat around the islands.

===Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan===
In 2001, a citizens advisory committee was established to work closely with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G), with the cooperation of Kodiak NWR, to develop a management plan addressing several problems that affect bears, including hunting, habitat, and viewing. The resulting Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan was crafted over several months by representatives from 12 diverse user groups, which, after hearing from a variety of experts from agencies and receiving extensive public input, developed more than 270 recommendations for managing and conserving Kodiak bears. Despite the diversity of viewpoints expressed by members of the group, all of the recommendations were by consensus. 

The underlying themes of the recommendations were continued conservation of the bear population at its current level, increased education programs to teach people how to live with bears on Kodiak, and protection of bear habitat with allowances for continued human use of the archipelago. Although the group&#x27;s role is merely advisory, government management agencies expressed a commitment to implement all of the regulations that were feasible and within their legal jurisdictions.

===Genetic diversity and endangerment===
The International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List does not list subspecies. The brown bear species, of which the Kodiak subspecies is a member, is listed as Lower Risk or Least Concern. The Kodiak is not listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

===Hunt-management===
Kodiak bear research and habitat protection is done cooperatively by the ADF&amp;G and Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. Bear hunting is managed by the ADF&amp;G, and hunting regulations are established by the Alaska Board of Game. Currently, a finely tuned management system distributes hunters in 32 different areas during two seasons (spring: April 1 – May 15, and fall: October 25 – November 30). Each year, about 4,500 people apply for the 496 permits offered for Kodiak bear hunts (two-thirds to Alaska residents, one-third to non-residents). Nonresidents are required to hire a registered guide who is authorized to hunt in a particular area, and this can cost from $10,000 to $22,000. All hunters must come into the Alaska Department of Fish and Game office in Kodiak before going into the field for a brief orientation and must check out before they leave the island. Every bear that is legally killed on the archipelago must be inspected by an ADF&amp;G wildlife biologist before it can be taken from the islands. Pelts receive a stamp from an ADF&amp;G officer if the hunter and guide provide proper documentation to prove licensing. Pelts cannot be transported or legally preserved or sold without the official stamp. Hunting laws are strictly enforced by the ADF&amp;G officers who often have the full support of the local community. Illegal hunting and fishing is frowned upon by the community which maintains a healthy respect for the island&#x27;s environmental laws, as well. Stiff penalties accompany illegal hunting and fishing. The island&#x27;s remote location makes trafficking in illegal pelts difficult for would-be poachers.

Since statehood, the reported number of Kodiak bears killed by hunters has ranged from 77 (1968–1969) to 206 (1965–1966). From 2000 to 2006, an average of 173 Kodiak bears were killed by hunters each year (118 during the fall season and 55 in the spring season). Over 75% of those were males. An additional nine bears were reported killed annually in defense of life or property during the same time. The number of large, trophy-sized bears (total skull size at least ) killed by hunters in recent years has been increasing. In the 1970s, only 2.5% of the bears killed on Kodiak were trophy-sized; in the 1990s and 2000s, the proportion increased to almost 9%.

===Bear-viewing===
In the past 20 years, bear viewing has become increasingly popular on Kodiak and other parts of Alaska. The most accessible bear-viewing location on Kodiak, Frazer River, had over 1,100 people come in 2007. Visitor numbers have been increasing at about 10% annually and development of additional bear viewing areas on Kodiak is planned. Also, other bear viewing opportunities exist through air-taxi, charter boat, remote lodge, and trekking operations on the archipelago. Although bear-viewing is often considered a &quot;non-consumptive&quot; use, it can have serious impacts on bear populations if it is not conducted properly. Most viewing occurs at places where bears congregate because of feeding opportunities that are critical to their survival. If some bears avoid these areas because people are there, those bears may not get the fat and protein they need to make it through the upcoming winter. Consequently, unmanaged bear viewing could affect several bears, especially productive sows with cubs. Often, bear-viewing and bear-hunting are considered incompatible. Even if the bear population is healthy and bear hunting is sustainable, ethical questions arise especially if hunting occurs near viewing areas and either during or soon after the viewing season. Many feel that it is not fair to encourage bears to be close to people during the summer, only to allow them to be shot in the fall. The Kodiak bear plan recognized bear hunting as a legitimate, traditional, and biologically justifiable activity. It recommended that agencies find ways to make bear hunting and bear viewing compatible on the archipelago.

==Cultural significance==
The bear is important to the Alutiiq people. Its Alutiiq name is &quot;Taquka’aq&quot; (Bear), with the pronunciation varying between Northern and Southern dialects.

<text>Will Jordan (born William Rauch, July 27, 1927 – September 6, 2018) was an American character actor and stand-up comedian best known for his resemblance to, and impressions of, television host and newspaper columnist Ed Sullivan.

==Early life==
Born in the Bronx, Rauch grew up in Flushing, Queens. His father was a pharmacist and his mother owned a hat store. Jordan graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan.

==Career==
===As Ed Sullivan===
In his act, Jordan came up with the catch-phrase, &quot;Welcome to our Toast of the Town &#x27;Shoooo&#x27;&quot;, which became a stereotypical joke for nearly every Sullivan impersonator after that, usually as the more generic &quot;Really Big &#x27;Shoooo&#x27;&quot; (or &quot;shoe&quot;).

Jordan appeared as Sullivan in the Broadway production of the musical &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; in 1960–1961 (a role he would reprise in the revival from October 15, 2009, through January 24, 2010).

Most of Jordan&#x27;s film and television performances since the 1970s have been as Sullivan in films that feature characters appearing on Sullivan&#x27;s famous variety series. These include:
*&quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; (1978), The Beatles
*&quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot; (1978), Buddy Holly and The Crickets
*&quot;The Doors&quot; (1991), The Doors

In 1983, Jordan appeared as Sullivan in the 1960s-TV-style video for &quot;Tell Her About It&quot;, the Billy Joel hit single.

===Other work===
Jordan&#x27;s other impressions included Bing Crosby, Groucho Marx and Jack Benny. He imitated Peter Lorre and James Mason as one of the actors in &quot;Psycho Drama&quot; on Rupert Holmes&#x27;s 1974 debut album &quot;Widescreen&quot;.

Jordan performed on the 1970 P.D.Q. Bach recording &quot;The Stoned Guest&quot; in the role of Milton Host, a send-up of Metropolitan Opera radio announcer Milton Cross.

He also participated in a recording project, called &quot;The Sicknicks&quot;, with Sandy Baron. The pair produced a comedy single, &quot;The Presidential Press Conference&quot;, which was a minor hit in 1961.

==Personal life and death==
Jordan had a son, Lonnie Saunders.

September 6, 2018, writer Mark Evanier announced Jordan died that morning at his Manhattan home at age 91.

<doc id="1021217" wikidata="Q506988" url="?curid=1021217" title="Lenny Dykstra">
<text>Leonard Kyle Dykstra ( ; born February 10, 1963), nicknamed Nails and Dude, is an American former professional baseball center fielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets (1985–1989) and Philadelphia Phillies (1989–1996). Dykstra was a three-time All-Star and won a World Series championship as a member of the 1986 Mets. Since retirement, Dykstra has been mired in financial and legal troubles. In 2009, he filed for bankruptcy. In 2011, he was arrested and charged with bankruptcy fraud, followed by grand theft auto and drug possession charges on an unrelated case, as well as indecent exposure. He served months in federal prison.

== Early life and family ==
Lenny Dykstra was born Leonard Kyle Leswick on February 10, 1963, in Santa Ana, California. Dykstra&#x27;s father, Terry Leswick, abandoned the family when Dykstra was four years of age. Dykstra&#x27;s mother, Marilyn, later married Dennis Dykstra, a phone company employee. Dennis Dykstra adopted Lenny. Lenny Dykstra has two brothers: Brian and Kevin.

Dykstra&#x27;s uncles, Pete, Jack, and Tony Leswick played in the National Hockey League.

Dykstra attended Garden Grove High School in Orange County, California. During his senior year, he hit .494 with 50 hits on the season, which was just two short of the state record. He had a career total of 89 stolen bases, second best in state history at the time, and recorded a hit in all 27 games of his senior season. In both his junior and senior seasons he was named all-league, all-county, and all-state. He was named 3-A co-player of the year in 1981. In the Orange County All-Star baseball game he reached base all eight times he came to bat, earning five hits, a walk, and reaching base on two errors, and stole five bases. He also played football, where he was named 2nd team all-county and team MVP as a defensive back.

==Baseball career==
===New York Mets===
Dykstra was originally committed to play baseball at Arizona State University for Jim Brock but said he would sign to play professionally if drafted high enough. The Mets signed Dykstra as a 13th-round draft pick in 1981. A star in the minors, in 1983 he led the Carolina League in at-bats, runs, hits, triples, batting average and stolen bases. That season, he hit .358 with 8 HR, 81 RBI, 105 stolen bases (a league record for 17 years), 107 walks and only 35 strikeouts. He was subsequently named the Carolina League MVP, and soon emerged as one of the Mets&#x27; prized prospects. While playing in Double-A in 1984 he befriended fellow outfielder and teammate Billy Beane, who later said that Dykstra was &quot;perfectly designed, emotionally&quot; to play baseball and that he had &quot;no concept of failure.&quot; According to Beane, his first comments on seeing future Hall of Fame pitcher Steve Carlton warming up were, &quot;Shit, I&#x27;ll stick him.&quot;

In 1985, Dykstra was promoted to the Mets when the team&#x27;s starting center fielder, Mookie Wilson, was placed on the disabled list. The rookie&#x27;s play and energy was a big boost to a Mets team that surged to a 98-win season and narrowly missed out on the NL East crown. The following season, Dykstra was intended to be platooned in center field with Wilson, but took over the position as outright starter and leadoff hitter when Wilson suffered a severe eye injury during spring training. As the season progressed,
Wilson began to get more playing time in left field, as the incumbent leftfielder, George Foster, was struggling, eventually getting released. This allowed Dykstra and Wilson to start in the outfield together, along with star rightfielder Darryl Strawberry. Dykstra earned the nickname &quot;Nails&quot; for his hard-nosed personality and fearless play. Also in 1986, Dykstra posed shirtless for a &quot;beefcake&quot; poster under the &quot;Nails&quot; nickname. Dykstra and #2 hitter Wally Backman were tagged as &quot;The Partners in Grime&quot; for their scrappy play as spark plugs for the star-studded Met lineup.

====1986 season====

With Dykstra as leadoff hitter, the 1986 Mets coasted to the division crown, beating the second-place Philadelphia Phillies by 21.5 games en route to a 108–54 season. The Mets ended up in the World Series after a victory over the NL West champion Houston Astros in the 1986 NLCS, 4 games to 2. Dykstra hit a walk-off home run in Game 3, which is considered one of the biggest hits in Mets franchise history and of Dykstra&#x27;s career. He hit .304 in the 1986 NLCS, and then .296 in the World Series against the Boston Red Sox. His leadoff home run in Game 3 at Fenway Park sparked the Mets, who had lost the first games of the Series at home at Shea Stadium. Dykstra&#x27;s leadoff home run in Game Three made him the third Met in team history (along with Tommie Agee and Wayne Garrett, both of whose home runs also came in a Game 3, in the 1969 and 1973 World Series respectively), to hit a leadoff home run in the World Series. Following Dykstra&#x27;s home run, the Mets won Game Three in blowout fashion, eventually rallying to defeat the Red Sox in seven games.

====1987–1989====
Dykstra continued to play in a platoon with Wilson. In the 1988 NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he continued his postseason success by hitting .429 in a losing effort.

On June 18, 1989, the Mets traded Dykstra to the Phillies along with pitcher Roger McDowell and minor-leaguer Tom Edens in exchange for second baseman Juan Samuel. Teammate Keith Hernandez later characterized Dykstra, in his book &quot;Pure Baseball,&quot; as being &quot;on the wild and crazy side&quot;, which he cites as one of the reasons the Mets chose to trade him and the Phillies chose to acquire him.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
Dykstra was initially upset over the trade since he enjoyed playing in New York, but Phillies fans loved him and he soon became a fan favorite there as well. He was known for his trademark cheek full of tobacco and hard-nosed play. With the Phillies, Dykstra&#x27;s career was marked by incredible highs and lows. In 1990, he started the All-Star Game, led the league in hits and finished fourth in batting average, hitting over .400 as late as June.

Dykstra&#x27;s next two seasons were marred by injury. In 1991, he lost two months of playing time due to injuries sustained in an auto accident. In late August, he re-broke his collarbone in Cincinnati running into the outfield wall and missed the rest of the season.

On Opening Day 1992, Dykstra was hit by a pitch that broke his hand. He played in just 145 of 324 possible games for the Phils in 1991 and 1992.

It all came together again in 1993 for Dykstra and the Phillies. The team, which had been rebuilding since its last playoff appearance ten years before, when they won the 1983 pennant but lost the World Series to Baltimore, returned to the top of the National League East and won the pennant again. He played in 161 games, setting a then major league record with 773 plate appearances. Despite being overlooked for the 1993 All-Star team he led the league in runs, hits, walks and at-bats, and was runner-up to the Giants&#x27; Barry Bonds in voting for NL Most Valuable Player. He led the Phillies into the World Series, which they lost to the defending World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays in six games. In the series, Dykstra batted .348 and hit four home runs, including two in a futile 15–14 loss at home in Game 4.

In October 2015, Dykstra told Colin Cowherd that beginning in 1993, he paid a team of private investigators $500,000 to dig up dirt on MLB umpires. He used the information, he said, to leverage a more favorable strike zone during games. He said it was not a coincidence that he led the majors in walks in 1993, going from 40 in 392 plate appearances in 1992 to 129 in 773 at-bats the following year. In 1994, Dykstra walked 68 times in 386 plate appearances. Dykstra&#x27;s claim of blackmailing umpires was met with considerable skepticism.

Dykstra went on to play in two more All-Star games, in 1994 and 1995.

===Retirement===
Injuries plagued Dykstra for the rest of his career. He last played in 1996, although he launched one final comeback attempt in spring training of 1998 before retiring at the age of 35.

==Post-baseball career==
Dykstra first ran a car wash in Simi Valley, California, but sold it in 2007.

Dykstra purchased NHL superstar Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s $17 million estate (built at a cost of $14,999,999) hoping to flip it; however, this endeavor was unsuccessful. The house was eventually sold in January 2011 for &quot;an undisclosed amount&quot;.

In September 2008, Dykstra began a high-end jet charter company and magazine marketed to professional athletes known as the &quot;Player&#x27;s Club&quot;, LLC. The magazine was part of a business plan to offer financial advice to professional athletes, according to a profile article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine.

In early 2009, stories and evidence began to emerge indicating that Dykstra&#x27;s financial empire was in a tailspin. A &quot;GQ&quot; article by Kevin P. Coughlin, a former photo editor for the &quot;New York Post&quot;, detailed Coughlin&#x27;s 67-day employment with Dykstra producing &quot;The Players Club&quot;, a magazine geared toward athletes and their expensive lifestyles. Coughlin detailed incidents and accused Dykstra of credit card fraud, failure to pay rent on the magazine&#x27;s Park Avenue offices or for bounced checks, lawsuits, and printing costs.

In March 2009, press reports alleged that Dykstra&#x27;s businesses were facing financial ruin. They also alleged that he had used offensive terms when speaking about black people, women, and homosexuals.

An extensive ESPN article published in April 2009 asserted that Dykstra had been the subject of at least two dozen legal actions since 2007.

On June 28, 2016, Dykstra released an autobiography titled &quot;House of Nails: A Memoir of Life on the Edge.&quot; &quot;House of Nails&quot; landed at No. 11 on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list for July 17, 2016.

On October 5, 2016, Dykstra and Rebound Finance, a credit referral company, announced their partnership. The partnership is still ongoing with Dykstra acting as the brand&#x27;s ambassador. According to a press release published by Rebound Finance, the main goal of the partnership is to &quot;provide hard working Americans with the credit they deserve.&quot;

=== Public appearances and media appearances ===
In 2000, Dykstra and other members of the 1986 Mets&#x27; World Championship team threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 5 of the World Series at Shea Stadium against the New York Yankees.

On June 28, 2016, Dykstra appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; for the first stop on his promotional tour for his bestselling book &quot;House of Nails: A Memoir of Life on the Edge&quot; and to discuss his sexual conquests. Dykstra also revealed that he is a gigolo for elderly women.

On July 27, 2016, Dykstra appeared on &quot;Larry King Now&quot; to discuss his book, his MLB career, his use of steroids, and his close friendship with Charlie Sheen.

On November 28, 2016, Dykstra returned to &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, bringing with him two women to verify the claims he made during his first visit in June. Dykstra also promoted his partnership with Rebound Finance.

Then, on December 17, 2019, Dykstra returned again to &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; playing on Stern&#x27;s &quot;Hollyweird Squares&quot; game.

==Legal issues==
In 1991, Dykstra crashed his red Mercedes-Benz SL 500 into a tree on Darby-Paoli Road in Radnor Township, Pennsylvania, after attending the bachelor party of Phillies teammate John Kruk. Dykstra suffered broken ribs, a broken collarbone and a broken facial bone, in addition to second-degree burns on his left arm and lower back. Darren Daulton, also a teammate, was a passenger in the car at the time; his injuries included an injured eye and a broken facial bone. According to Radnor Township Police, Dykstra&#x27;s blood alcohol content was measured at 0.179% shortly after the crash, over double the legal limit of 0.08% in the state. Dykstra was charged with &quot;driving under the influence of alcohol, speeding and reckless driving&quot;.

In 1999, he was arrested for sexual harassment of a 17-year-old girl who worked at his car wash. The criminal charges were later dropped.

Dykstra was sued in relation to his car wash in 2005. The lawsuit, filed by former business partner Lindsay Jones, alleged that Dykstra used steroids and told Jones to place bets on Phillies games in 1993, when Dykstra was on that pennant-winning team. He denied those allegations, but other accusations of steroid use also surfaced.

Dykstra, whose net worth was estimated at $58 million in 2008, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2009, listing less than $50,000 in assets against $10 million to $50 million in liabilities. He claimed to be a victim of mortgage fraud after he lost the house he purchased from Wayne Gretzky to foreclosure. Fireman&#x27;s Fund Insurance Company provided Dykstra and his wife with a temporary residence pending resolution of the outstanding claim. According to papers filed in court, one of Dykstra&#x27;s houses was in &quot;unshowable&quot; condition as &quot;the home was littered throughout with empty beer bottles, trash, dog feces and urine, and other unmentionables.&quot; Raw sewage had been leaking inside the house, and electrical wiring had been damaged or removed by vandals.

On October 6, 2009, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Dykstra&#x27;s World Series ring had been auctioned off for $56,762 &quot;to help pay the former major-leaguer&#x27;s $31 million debt.&quot; On November 20, 2009, the case was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to liquidate the estate and pay creditors.

In September 2009, Dykstra was banned from both of his foreclosed multimillion-dollar properties in Lake Sherwood. He was accused of vandalizing the properties and failing to maintain homeowners&#x27; insurance on them, and the court assigned a trustee to manage them.

In June 2010, a court-appointed federal trustee in Dykstra&#x27;s bankruptcy case charged he had lied under oath, improperly hidden and sold assets, and repeatedly acted &quot;in a fraudulent and deceitful manner&quot; during his ongoing bankruptcy case. The trustee accordingly asked the bankruptcy court to deny Dykstra&#x27;s request for a bankruptcy discharge.

In December 2010, adult entertainment star and escort Monica Foster claimed Dykstra had hired her on December 13, 2010, and had paid her with a bad check.
In January 2011, Dykstra was accused of sexual assault by his housekeeper. She alleged that he had forced her to perform oral sex on him. The woman told investigators &quot;she needed the job and the money, so she went along with the suspect&#x27;s requests rather than lose her job&quot;.

In April 2011, the Los Angeles Police Department Commercial Crimes Division arrested Dykstra on separate grand theft charges related to the purchase of vehicles. He was held on $500,000 bail. On April 13, 2011, Dykstra was arrested for investigation of grand theft by Los Angeles police at his Encino home on suspicion of trying to buy a stolen car, the day after Dykstra, in an unrelated federal complaint, had been charged with embezzling from a bankruptcy estate. He faced up to five years in federal prison if convicted. Federal prosecutors contended that after filing for bankruptcy Dykstra hid, sold, or destroyed more than $400,000 worth of items from the $18.5 million mansion in question without permission of a bankruptcy trustee.

In May 2011, Dykstra was sentenced to house arrest after his bankruptcy fraud indictment. Under the terms of his plea agreement, he was allowed to leave the house only to go to work, attend church, or undergo mandatory drug testing. On June 13, 2011, Dykstra appeared in federal bankruptcy court and pleaded not guilty to 13 charges. He was represented by a public defender. Dykstra faced up to 80 years in prison if convicted of all charges relating to embezzlement, obstruction of justice, bankruptcy fraud, making false statements to bankruptcy court, and concealing property from the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy fraud trial was set to start on June 5, 2012.

On June 6, 2011, Dykstra was arrested and charged with 25 misdemeanor and felony counts of grand theft auto, identity theft, filing false financial statements and possession of cocaine, ecstasy and the human growth hormone (HGH) known as somatropin. He first pleaded not guilty to the charges, but later changed his plea to no contest to grand theft auto and providing false financial statements in exchange for getting the drug charges dropped. On March 5, 2012, after unsuccessfully trying to withdraw his nolo-contendere plea, he was sentenced to three years in state prison, receiving nearly a year&#x27;s credit for time already served.

On August 25, 2011, Dykstra was charged with indecent exposure. The Los Angeles City Attorney accused him of placing ads on Craigslist requesting a personal assistant or housekeeping services. The victims alleged that when they arrived, they were informed that the job also required massage service and that Dykstra then exposed himself to them. He was given a nine-month sentence for lewd conduct.

On July 13, 2012, Dykstra pleaded guilty in federal court to three felonies: one count each of bankruptcy fraud, concealment of assets, and money laundering. He admitted to hiding, selling, or destroying over $400,000 worth of items that were supposed to be part of his bankruptcy filing. On December 3, 2012, he was sentenced to six-and-a-half months in prison and 500 hours of community service, and was ordered to pay $200,000 in restitution.

Dykstra was released from the federal penitentiary in Victorville, California, in June 2013 after serving six-and-a-half months of his sentence for the bankruptcy fraud and money laundering charges, which ran concurrently with the grand theft auto and false financial statements charges. As part of his release, he was required to serve three years of supervised release (including 500 hours of community service), enroll in a substance abuse program, submit to drug testing, and pay $200,000 to his creditors. Dykstra finished his probation in April 2014 and had undergone weekly drug testing.

On May 23, 2018, Dykstra was arrested for drug possession and for uttering terroristic threats. He allegedly held a gun to his Uber driver after the driver refused to change destinations. On October 10, 2018, Dykstra was indicted by a New Jersey grand jury on these charges.

In his book &quot;108 Stitches&quot;, former Dykstra teammate Ron Darling alleged that Dykstra hurled racist taunts at Red Sox pitcher Oil Can Boyd from the on-deck circle during the 1986 World Series. Dykstra publicly and vociferously denied the story and was publicly supported in his denial by former teammates Dwight Gooden, Kevin Mitchell, Darryl Strawberry and Wally Backman. Dykstra sued Darling for defamation in April 2020 but the case was dismissed on June 1, 2020, with the judge citing Dykstra&#x27;s documented reputation as being &quot;among other things, racist, misogynist and anti-gay, as well as a sexual predator, a drug-abuser, a thief and an embezzler&quot; as the reason.

==Personal life==

===Mitchell Report; steroid use===
Dykstra was named in the Mitchell Report on steroid use in Major League Baseball on December 13, 2007. The report cited multiple sources, including Kirk Radomski, as stating that Dykstra had used anabolic steroids during his MLB career. It also stated that the Commissioner of Baseball&#x27;s office had known about Dykstra&#x27;s steroid use since 2000. Dykstra did not agree to meet with the Mitchell investigators to discuss the allegations.

In Randall Lane&#x27;s book &quot;The Zeroes&quot;, Dykstra admitted in his hotel room to Lane, editor of &quot;Trader Monthly&quot;, that he used steroids to perform better than those he felt might replace him; otherwise, his $25 million would be &quot;on the line&quot;.

On December 20, 2007, Dykstra was also named in former MLB pitcher Jason Grimsley&#x27;s unsealed affidavit as an alleged user of steroids.

<doc id="1021227" wikidata="Q7349533" url="?curid=1021227" title="Robert Sacchi">
<text>Robert Patsy Sacchi (March 27, 1932 – June 23, 2021) was an Italian-American character actor who, since the 1970s, was known for his close resemblance to Humphrey Bogart. He appeared in many films and TV shows playing either Bogart or a character who happens to look and sound like him. He was best known for his role in the 1980 film &quot;The Man with Bogart&#x27;s Face&quot;.

==Early life==
Sacchi was born in Rome on March 27, 1932. His father, Alberto, worked as a carpenter; his mother was Marietta (D’Urbano). They emigrated to the United States when Sacchi was an infant, and settled in The Bronx. He attended Cardinal Hayes High School, where his friends and neighbors first noted his physical resemblance to Humphrey Bogart. He studied business and finance at Iona College, before obtaining a master&#x27;s degree from New York University.

==Career==
Sacchi&#x27;s first three film credits in &quot;The French Sex Murders&quot;, &quot;Pulp&quot;, and &quot;Across 110th Street&quot; (all released in 1972) saw him play roles connected with Bogart in citing Bogart&#x27;s manners. He began playing Bogart during the early 1970s, starting with Woody Allen&#x27;s touring comedy &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;. He also played the role while touring college campuses.

Sacchi played the title role in the 1980 comedy &quot;The Man with Bogart&#x27;s Face&quot; (also titled &quot;Sam Marlow, Private Eye&quot;) about a private investigator who gets plastic surgery to take after Bogart. He starred alongside Franco Nero, Michelle Phillips, Olivia Hussey, Yvonne De Carlo, Mike Mazurki, and George Raft (making his final film appearance). Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Tom Buckley was of the opinion that Sacchi &quot;shows considerable acting skill in the title role, although his hopes for future employment in films would seem to be limited&quot;. In spite of this prediction, he went on to gain more roles as Bogart. These included Phil Collins&#x27;s music video in 1990 titled &quot;I Wish It Would Rain Down&quot;, as well as Sacchi&#x27;s one-man show called &quot;Bogey’s Back&quot;. He also played Bogart in &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; (1981), &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; (1987), and the &quot;Cybill&quot; episode &quot;In Her Dreams&quot; (1997). He later recounted how he &quot;never thought Bogie was too terrific-looking&quot;, adding that &quot;like most kids at the time, I wanted to look like Gregory Peck&quot;.

During the 1990s, Sacchi played minor roles in &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; (1992). In a notable episode of &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; entitled &quot;You, Murderer&quot; in 1995 (season 6 episode 15), Sacchi only provided the voice of a character who looks like Bogart. Computer manipulated film footage of Bogart provided the visuals. Also in 1995, he had a television role in the &quot;Pointman&quot; episode titled &quot;The Psychic&quot;. One of his final film credits came in 1999 with &quot;Blast from the Past&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sacchi had six children from his first marriage: Robert Jr., Barbara, Felicia, Maria, Lisa, and Anthony. His second marriage was to Peruvian artist Angela De Herrera. They remained married for 51 years until his death. Together, they had two children: Trish, and John who worked as a film producer.

Sacchi died on June 23, 2021, at Barlow Respiratory Hospital in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles. He was 89, and suffered from a brief illness prior to his death.

<text>Willis Bennett Ballance (October 27, 1918 – September 23, 2004) was an American radio talk show host. 

Ballance was born in Peoria, Illinois, and studied journalism at the University of Illinois before serving in the United States Marines. He had radio station stints in Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu and San Diego. In the early 1950s his &quot;Ballance of the Night&quot; hosted celebrities on KNX in Los Angeles. Ballance was the evening Top 40 personality in the late 1950s to early &#x27;60s on #1-rated KFWB in Los Angeles.

In 1971, Ballance’s “Feminine Forum” radio show was launched on KGBS in L.A. The provocative show became one of the top rated shows in L.A. He is known as the forerunner to &quot;shock jocks&quot; like Tom Leykis and Howard Stern, having been accused of exploiting women&#x27;s rights activists who called in to his show.

The &quot;Feminine Forum&quot; was dropped in 1973, and he began the &quot;Bill Ballance Show&quot;. He left Los Angeles in 1978 and went to KFMB in San Diego, where he remained for fifteen years. While his early years in San Diego were successful from a ratings standpoint, his core audience was much smaller than what he had in Los Angeles. Ballance continued his practice of mixing open-topic callers with various in-studio guests (psychologists like Vince and Sally Huntington, counselors, physicians, etc.), as well as his own hand-written monologues. By the late 1980s, however, his popularity began to wane. As other talk show hosts copied and changed the &quot;shock jock&quot; format, and as the format itself began to evolve into racier topics and discussions, the &quot;Bill Ballance Show&quot; began to seem tame by comparison. He retired from radio in 1993, after more than 50 years in the industry.

Ballance caused another stir in 1998, when a judge ruled that nude images of Dr. Laura Schlessinger could continue to be posted on a website. Ballance had sold the pictures to Internet Entertainment Group for $50,000.00 because he had been snubbed by Schlessinger at a Beverly Hills luncheon honoring her. He claimed that they were the product of a 1970s affair between himself and Schlessinger, while Schlessinger was married. Schlessinger admitted the affair but claimed she was legally separated and had filed for divorce from her first husband at the time of their affair. Ballance was 28 years older than Schlessinger.

Ballance appeared on television in the episode &quot;Lover&#x27;s Quarrel&quot; of the 1973 ABC situation comedy &quot;A Touch of Grace&quot;, playing himself. Ballance also appeared in the 1975 &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; episode &quot;Fatal Witness&quot; as fictional talk show host Bill Edwards.

After undergoing quadruple bypass surgery and suffering a stroke in June 2002, Ballance died on September 23, 2004.

<doc id="1021232" wikidata="Q2742175" url="?curid=1021232" title="Leptoglossus phyllopus">
<text>Leptoglossus phyllopus or eastern leaf-footed bug is a species of leaf-footed bugs in the same genus as the western conifer seed bug (&quot;L. occidentalis&quot;. The Eastern leaf-footed bug is found throughout the southern United States, from Florida to California, through Mexico, and as far south as Costa Rica.

These bugs are a common garden insect which may damage a wide variety of crops including cotton, peaches and tomatoes, and seeds such as beans, black-eyed peas and sorghum. Like other bugs L. phyllopus suck juices from plants by puncturing them with their sucking mouth parts, making them resistant to ingested pesticides. A toxin is injected into the plant when piercing its skin, causing discoloration and hard spots on fruits. The adult bugs are highly resistant to pesticides; however, they are vulnerable in their bright orange nymph stage. Trap crops can be used to lure them away from desired plants and to encourage predator populations, and in small garden plots handpicking, the use of trap crops, and bug traps baited with methyl (E, Z)-2,4-decadienoate can be effective controls.

Acetosyringone is produced by the male leaffooted bug and used in its communication system. &quot;Leptoglossus phyllopus&quot; emits a foul odor when it is handled

<text>Caifanes is a Mexican rock band formed in Mexico City in 1986. The group achieved commercial success during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The original lineup of members consisted of Saúl Hernández (vocals and guitar), Sabo Romo (bass), Alfonso André (drums) and Diego Herrera (keyboards, saxophone). Alejandro Marcovich later joined as lead guitarist. Caifanes&#x27; style can be described as a hybrid of British new wave, progressive rock and Latin percussion underscored by deep, somber and Latin American-Mexican Spanish-influenced lyrics and the vocal style of Saúl Hernández. Members of Caifanes have cited The Cure, The Beatles and King Crimson as major influences. Adrian Belew produced their third studio album, &quot;El Silencio&quot;, and made a guest appearance on the track &quot;Piedra&quot;.

The name &quot;Caifanes&quot; is said to be derived from the 1940s Mexican &quot;pachuco&quot; (zoot suiter) slang &quot;cae fine&quot;. Its equivalent in English would be &quot;cool dude&quot;. The word has also been used to describe the proverbial Mexican &quot;pachuco&quot;, delinquent or outsider.

==History==
===Early years===

The seeds of what later became Caifanes were planted in 1984 with Las Insolitas Imágenes de Aurora (The Unusual Images of Aurora), a band that included Saúl Hernández, Alfonso André and Alejandro Marcovich. According to Marcovich, Insólitas started as a side project for the purpose of performing as a party band for the filming of his brother&#x27;s film project. (Marcovich&#x27;s brother went on to direct videos for Caifanes). At the time, both Hernández and Marcovich were playing in different bands. They enjoyed the experience of playing in Insolitas and decided to continue. As the seriousness of the project grew the band began to play in different venues in Mexico City like Rockotitlán, High Tower and El Jabalí. In May 1986, Insolitas recorded a live demo at Rockotitlán. Insólitas developed a strong cult following in Mexico City.

Insólitas broke up in 1986. Saúl and Alfonso reformed as Caifanes with the bass guitar player/producer Sabo Romo and Diego Herrera on keyboards and saxophone. Caifanes&#x27; first live show was on April 11, 1987, in Rockotitlán. The building was filled to capacity and many people were left outside. Their popularity began to grow throughout Mexico City. By late 1987, Caifanes had carved a niche for themselves as a dark contrast to the corporate pop/rock and light ballads that dominated Mexican radio and television during the 1980s. At times the image and the sound were considered radical for the Mexican music industry. Between December 28, 1986, and January 3, 1987, Juan Aceves produced a four-song demo for the band using &quot;free&quot; studio time at night at Arco Studio (where Aceves was chief engineer). The demo was showcased on the independent radio program &quot;Espacio 59&quot; (Space 59), a show that promoted up-and-coming rock bands. With demo in hand, Caifanes approached CBS Mexico. The musical director at the time shunned them for dark new wave attire and said, &quot;You look like fags.&quot; At the time, Caifanes&#x27; sound and look was influenced by British post-punk groups such as The Cure and The Jesus and Mary Chain. They dressed in black suits and sported frizzly hair and make-up. Upon hearing the demo of &quot;Será Por Eso&quot; (English: &quot;That&#x27;s Why&quot;), the CBS executive said, &quot;At CBS, our business is to sell records, not coffins.&quot;

Nevertheless, the movement of Rock en Español or &quot;rock en tu idioma&quot; (Rock in your language) was too strong to ignore by record executives. The flood of groups from Spain and Argentina forced Mexican labels to take a second look at up-and-coming Mexican bands. Caifanes received a big break when Ariola records invited them to open for the Argentinean rocker Miguel Mateos&#x27; Mexico City show. The show brought Cafaines to the attention of Miguel Mateos&#x27; producer and back then Mateos band bass player, Oscar Lopez aka &quot;cachorro&quot;. He fell in love with the band and took them to the studio to record a demo. Lopez was instrumental in their signing to RCA-Ariola and went on to produce their first two albums.

Caifanes&#x27; first album, &quot;Caifanes&quot; was released in August 1988 by RCA-Ariola. It was preceded by an EP of three songs, in order to test the market. The immediate sale of 300,000 copies of the EP cemented the band&#x27;s appeal. The first single, &quot;Mátenme Porque Me Muero&quot; (&quot;Kill Me Because I&#x27;m Dying&quot;), became a minor hit in Mexico City. The first three singles received radio play.

In December 1988, Caifanes released a cover of the Cuban folk singer Guillermo Rodriguez Fiffe&#x27;s classic &quot;cumbia&quot; (tropical dance song), &quot;La Negra Tomasa&quot; (The Black Woman Tomasa) as a Maxi single. It was a massive hit in Mexico and introduced Caifanes to a wider audience nationally and abroad.

===National success===

By 1989, Caifanes had emerged as one of the hottest rock acts from central Mexico. In June, Caifanes played two sold-out shows at the National Auditorium, a 10,000 person venue—a first for a Mexican rock band.

In late 1989, Caifanes began to record a second album in New York City. Again, it was produced by Lopez, assisted by Gustavo Santaolalla and Daniel Freiberg. &quot;El diablito&quot; (The Little Devil) or &quot;Vol.2&quot; was released in July 1990 by BMG Records. The band now included the former Insolitas Imagenes de Aurora guitarist Alejandro Marcovich. His textural guitar work considerably changed Caifanes&#x27; sound and cemented the &quot;classic&quot; Mexican rock sound for which Caifanes became famous. &quot;La Célula Que Explota&quot; (The Cell that Explodes), with its brushes of mariachi and bolero guitars and a crescendo of mariachi trumpets and its music video directed by Juan Carlos Colín became both a signature of the band as well as a massive hit in 1990 and 1991.

By this time, Caifanes along with Maná, Fobia, Maldita Vecindad, La Lupita, Café Tacuba and Los Amantes de Lola, helped to move Mexican rock toward a wider audience and catapulted the Rock En Español movement of the 1990s.

In 1992, Caifanes released &quot;El Silencio&quot; (The Silence). Recorded in Wisconsin and produced by Adrian Belew of King Crimson, &quot;El Silencio&quot; had a more direct guitar driven sound. &quot;No Dejes Que&quot; (Don&#x27;t Let It), &quot;Estas Dormida&quot; (You&#x27;re Sleeping), &quot;Debajo de Tu Piel&quot; (Under Your Skin), and the soaring &quot;Nubes&quot; (Clouds) went on to become Mexican rock staples. The influence of Belew, who also played guitar on the album, was felt strongest in &quot;Hasta Morir&quot; (Until Death), &quot;Tortuga&quot; (Turtle) and &quot;Vamos a Hacer un Silencio&quot; (Let&#x27;s Make a Silence). With its string of hits and hybrid of rock and traditional Mexican music, &quot;El silencio&quot; is considered to be one of the most influential records of the Rock En Español genre. Caifanes toured extensively in support of it. By this time, the group had started to make inroads into Central and South America as well as in the United States. In August 1992, Caifanes sold out the Hollywood Palladium. In 1993, Caifanes became the first Mexican rock group to sell out Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City.

By late 1993, Caifanes became a three piece with the exit of Romo and Herrera. Federico Fong filled in on bass guitar and Yann Zaragoza played keyboards. &quot;El nervio del volcán&quot; (The Volcano&#x27;s Nerve, 1994, released by BMG, showed Caifanes with a heavier, more progressive sound. Without the distractions of Romo&#x27;s lively and fluid bass guitar playing or Herrera&#x27;s atmospheric keyboards, Marcovich&#x27;s staccato guitar work, Alfonso&#x27;s polyrythmic drumming and Hernandez&#x27;s brooding and haunting vocal style became even more prominent. &quot;Afuera&quot; (&quot;Outside&quot;), the first single, fused rock grooves with an ethnic-inspired guitar solo. &quot;Aquí No Es Así&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Not Like That Here&quot;) and &quot;Ayer Me Dijo Un Ave&quot; (&quot;Yesterday a Bird said to me...&quot;) became radio favorites. &quot;Aquí No Es Así&quot; achieved great success in Mexico and several countries of Latin America. It became the last massive hit of the band, shortly before their break up, and its music video, directed by Carlos Marcovich (Alejandro&#x27;s brother, who also directed &quot;Afuera&quot;) tells the history of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in just one shot.

In 1994, Caifanes were at the height of their popularity and was, along with Maná, one of Mexico&#x27;s top stadium rock acts, selling out stadiums in Mexico and large venues throughout Latin America and the United States. They were a staple on Latin MTV, Rock en Español radio and appeared regularly at music festivals. In 1994, Caifanes opened for the Rolling Stones in Mexico City and participated in Peter Gabriel&#x27;s WOMAD festival.

===Breakup===
1995 was the end for Caifanes. The relationship between Hernández and Marcovich was strained. On 18 August 1995, Caifanes played the final show in San Luis Potosí. A legal scuffle over the name &quot;Caifanes&quot; ensued, forcing Saúl Hernández to choose the name Jaguares (Spanish for &quot;jaguars&quot;) for his new project, which was not a radical departure from the Caifanes sound. Hernández was joined by the former Caifanes and Insolitas drummer Alfonso André.

===Reunion===
On December 14, 2010, it was announced that the band would reunite for the Vive Latino festival and the Coachella Festival of 2011, after a reconciliation between Hernández and Marcovich.

After not having recorded since 1994, the band released a new single, &quot;Heridos&quot; in 2019. The band&#x27;s intention was that the release of the single would be the starting point of what could be the recording of a fifth studio album. Since then, the band has released two further singles, &quot;Sólo Eres Tú&quot; in 2022, and &quot;Inés&quot; in 2023. As of June 2024, a full-length album has not been released by Caifanes since 1994&#x27;s &quot;El Nervio del Volcán&quot;.

==Legacy==
=== Influence on popular culture ===
Caifanes collaborated in the de-sanitization of rock—its condition was one of marginalization and veiled in a conservative Mexico of the 1980s. Their arrival marked a total rupture in structures and of many taboos of the time, and their look collided with social norms. It was extremely unusual for a Mexican band at the time to wear make-up, dress in black, and have disheveled hair.

=== Influence on Mexican rock ===
The presence of Caifanes and the media coverage forced record companies to take existing groups seriously as well as to revitalize veteran rock figures who had long careers behind them, such as El Tri. Neon, Bon y los Enemigos del Silencio, Alquima and Maldita Vecindad. Maná and El Tri already had records out to take advantage of the surge in media support. Fobia gives enormous credit to the influence of Caifanes on their music -Hernandez collaborated in the production of the demos &quot;Puedo Rascarme Solo&quot;, &quot;La Iguana&quot; and &quot;Moscas&quot; for a television show. Saul offered moral support to Fobia and helped them sign with BMG Ariola. Many other bands owe their existence in the media to Caifanes, including Santa Sabina, La Castañeda, Los Amantes de Lola, Maldita Vecindad, La Cuca, La Lupita, the ska band Sekta Core!, Victimas del Doctor Cerebro, Botellita de Jerez. All of these bands have commented on the support of Caifanes for their careers.

<text>A primary tumor is a tumor growing at the anatomical site where tumor progression began and proceeded to yield a cancerous mass. Most solid cancers develop at their primary site but may then go on to metastasize or spread to other parts of the body. These further tumors are secondary tumors.

Most cancers continue to be called after their primary site, as in breast cancer or lung cancer for example, even after they have spread to other parts of the body. Cancer of unknown primary origin is cancer that is determined to be at the metastatic stage, but a primary tumor cannot be identified.

<text>Small-cell carcinoma is a type of highly malignant cancer that most commonly arises within the lung, although it can occasionally arise in other body sites, such as the cervix, prostate, and gastrointestinal tract. Compared to non-small cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma is more aggressive, with a shorter doubling time, higher growth fraction, and earlier development of metastases.

Extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is classified as a rare disorder. Ten-year relative survival rate (combined limited and extensive SCLC) is 3.5% (4.3% for women, 2.8% for men). Survival can be higher or lower based on a combination of factors including stage, age, sex and race. While all lung cancers are associated with tobacco smoking, SCLC is very strongly associated with tobacco smoking.

==Types==

===Lung cancer===
Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) has long been divided into two clinicopathological stages, termed limited stage (LS) and extensive stage (ES). The stage is generally determined by the presence or absence of metastases, whether or not the tumor appears limited to the thorax, and whether or not the entire tumor burden within the chest can feasibly be encompassed within a single radiotherapy portal. In general, if the tumor is confined to one lung and the lymph nodes close to that lung, the cancer is said to be LS. If cancer has spread beyond that, it is said to be ES.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, accounting for the highest mortality rates among both men and women. When associated with the lung, SCLC is sometimes called &quot;oat cell carcinoma&quot; due to the flat cell shape and scanty cytoplasm. Small cell mesothelioma – an extremely rare subtype of lung cancer – can be mistaken for small cell lung cancer.

Small-cell carcinoma is most often more rapidly and widely metastatic than non-small-cell lung carcinoma (and hence staged differently). There is usually early involvement of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. The mechanisms of its metastatic progression are not well understood.

===Combined===

When SCLC is found with one or more differentiated forms of lung cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, the malignant tumor is then diagnosed and classified as a combined small cell lung carcinoma (c-SCLC). Small-cell lung carcinoma can occur in combination with a wide variety of other histological variants of lung cancer, including extremely complex malignant tissue admixtures.

C-SCLC is the only currently recognized subtype of SCLC.

===Extrapulmonary===
Very rarely, the primary site for small-cell carcinoma is outside of the lungs and pleural space; in these cases, it is referred to as extrapulmonary small-cell carcinoma (EPSCC). Outside of the respiratory tract, small-cell carcinoma can appear in the cervix, prostate, liver, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, or bladder. It is estimated to account for 1,000 new cases a year in the U.S. Histologically similar to small-cell lung cancer, therapies for small-cell lung cancer are usually used to treat EPSCC. First-line treatment is usually with cisplatin and etoposide. In Japan, first-line treatment is shifting to irinotecan and cisplatin. When the primary site is in the skin, it is referred to as a Merkel-cell carcinoma.

===Extrapulmonary localized in the lymph nodes===
This is an extremely rare type of small cell, and there has been little information in the scientific community. It appears to occur in only one or more lymph nodes, and nowhere else in the body. Treatment is similar to small-cell lung cancer, but survival rates are much higher than other small-cell carcinomas.

===Prostate===
Small-cell carcinoma of the prostate (SCCP) is a rare form of prostate cancer (approximately 1% of prostate cancers). Symptomatic metastasis of SCCP to the brain is rare, and carries a poor prognosis.

==Signs and symptoms==

Small-cell carcinoma of the lung usually presents in the central airways and infiltrates the submucosa leading to the narrowing of bronchial airways. Common symptoms include cough, dyspnea, weight loss, and debility. Over 70% of patients with small-cell carcinoma present with metastatic disease; common sites include the liver, adrenals, bone, and brain.

Due to its high grade neuroendocrine nature, small-cell carcinomas can produce ectopic hormones, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). Ectopic production of large amounts of ADH leads to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion (SIADH). Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a well-known paraneoplastic condition linked to small-cell carcinoma. Approximately half of all individuals diagnosed with Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome will eventually be found to have a small-cell carcinoma of the lung.

==Genetics==
TP53 is mutated in 70 to 90% of SCLCs. RB1 and the retinoblastoma pathway are inactivated in most SCLCs. PTEN is mutated in 2 to 10%. MYC amplifications and amplification of MYC family members are found in 30% of SCLCs. Loss of heterozygocity on chromosome arm 3p is found in more than 80% of SCLCs, including the loss of FHIT. One hundred translocations have been reported in SCLCs.

==Diagnosis==

Small-cell carcinoma is an undifferentiated neoplasm composed of primitive-appearing cells. As the name implies, the cells in small-cell carcinomas are smaller than normal cells and barely have room for any cytoplasm. Some researchers identify this as a failure in the mechanism that controls the size of the cells.

At the time of diagnosis, 60–70% of people already have metastases.

=== LS-SCLC ===
Chest X-rays are typically the first step to evaluate someone for any type of lung cancer. If images show suspicious spots on the patient&#x27;s lung, a healthcare provider may order chest CT, PET, needle biopsy or bronchoscopy for further check.

It is possible to use bronchoscopic biopsy to diagnose Lung small-cell carcinoma. However, small-cell carcinoma tissue obtained through bronchoscopy is prone to tissue compression and unclear morphology. However, pathologists can stain lesions with immunohistochemistry Ki-67, CD56, TTF-1, CgA, Syn, P63, CK5/6, LCA, and 34βE12 to help, in order to make a differential diagnosis.

=== ES-SCLC ===
The common metastasis sites of SCLC include the lung, brain, bone, adrenal gland, liver, colorectum, and lymph nodes. 

If the tumor metastasises to the brain, It is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the patient&#x27;s condition in combination with PET/CT and MRI. In patients with brain metastases from small cell lung cancer, MRI has specificity and sensitivity of 75% to 90% and 70% to 85%, respectively. In MRI, T1- and T2-weighted images had medium-to-high signal intensity. Presently, brain metastasis diagnosis by FDG-PET/CT often uses TBR ≥1.6 of increased absorption as the appropriate diagnostic index for positive brain metastasis. Researchers also found cerebellum is the risk site with a high incidence of metastasis. In patients with SCLC brain metastasis, the general manifestation on plain CT is of low and medium density, and high-density signals of lesions are rare. However, the imaging with enhanced CT is more clear, showing obvious enhanced signals of cancer lesions. The extensive low-density edema zone of finger edema can be observed. What&#x27;s more, it is difficult to detect small metastasis in the brain &lt;0.5 cm, which contributes to the high false-positive rate of brain CT.

==Treatment==

=== LS-SCLC ===
In cases of LS-SCLC, combination chemotherapy is administered together with concurrent chest radiotherapy. Chest radiotherapy has been shown to improve survival in LS-SCLC. Because SCLC usually metastasizes widely very early on in the natural history of the tumor, and because nearly all cases respond dramatically to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, there has been little role for surgery in this disease since the 1970s. However, in cases of small, asymptomatic, node-negative SCLC&#x27;s (&quot;very limited stage&quot;), surgical excision may improve survival when used prior to chemotherapy.

===ES-SCLC===
In ES-SCLC, platinum-based combination chemotherapy is the standard of care.

Combination chemotherapy consists of a wide variety of agents, including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and carboplatin. Response rates are high even in extensive disease, with between 15% and 30% of subjects having a complete response to a combination chemotherapy, and the vast majority having at least some objective response. Responses in ES-SCLC are often of short duration, and the evidence surrounding the risk of treatment compared to the potential benefit of chemotherapy for people who have extensive SCLC is not clear.

===Chemotherapy===
Small-cell lung cancer is most commonly treated with chemotherapy in a combination of two drugs, which is more effective than one drug alone.

# Cisplatin and etoposide,
# Carboplatin and etoposide.

====Cisplatin-resistance====
The drug paclitaxel may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-resistant cancer. About 68.1% of cisplatin-resistant cells appear to be sensitive to paclitaxel and 66.7% of paclitaxel-resistant cells to cisplatin. The mechanism for this activity is unknown. Paclitaxel-based chemotherapy showed modest activity in SCLC patients refractory to both etoposide- and camptothecin-based chemotherapy. The newer agent lurbinectedin is active in relapsed SCLC and was approved for medical use in the United States in June 2020.

===Immunotherapy===
The FDA has approved three immunotherapies for small cell lung cancer:
* Nivolumab (Opdivo), a PD-1 inhibitor (2018)
* Atezolizumab (Tecentriq), a PD-L1 inhibitor (2018)
* Tarlatamab, a bi-specific T-cell engager (2024)

Canadian regulator rejected funding Tecentriq (Atezolizumab) for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer in 2020 &quot;as too costly&quot; followed by the United Kingdom also citing &quot;drug’s cost-effectiveness.&quot;

===Radiation therapy===
Chest radiation helps SCLC patients live longer by killing cancer cells and helping prevention of cancer recurrence. Another type of radiation, prophylactic cranial radiation, prevents central nervous system recurrence and can improve survival in patients with good performance status who have had a complete response or very good partial response to chemoradiation in LD or chemotherapy in ED.

===In case of relapse===
If small cell lung cancer comes back after treatment, the following combination of drugs may be used as salvage therapy:
# Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Procytox),
# Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and
# Vincristine (Oncovin)
# Paclitaxel (Taxol)
# Irinotecan (Camptosar) 

Guidelines recommended as of 2018 that patients who relapse &gt; 6 months from initial therapy should be retreated with the original chemotherapy regimen. For patients who relapse in &lt; 6 months, single-agent chemotherapy either topotecan second-line therapy, or paclitaxel can be used.

====Novel agents====
Several newer agents, including temozolomide and bendamustine, have activity in relapsed SCLC. Of note, temozolomide yielded a response rate of 38% for brain metastases due to SCLC.

In a clinical trial of 50 patients, a combination of olaparib and temozolomide in relapsed small-cell lung cancer yielded an overall response rate of 41.7%, median progression-free survival of 4.2 months, and overall survival was 8.5 months.

Lurbinectedin showed an increased overall survival rate in relapsed small cell lung cancer in a trial. Lurbinectedin is available in the U.S. under an expanded access program (EAP).

Trilaciclib, a CKD4/6 inhibitor, reduces chemotherapy-induced toxicity in patients being treated for small-cell lung cancer.

In 2021, the FDA approved trilaciclib (Cosela) as a treatment to reduce the frequency of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression for patients receiving certain types of chemotherapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer.

==Prognosis==
As of 2015, 5-year survival rates for small cell lung cancer (extensive and limited) range between 3.6% and 32.2% for women, and between 2.2% and 24.5% for men. Relative 5-year survival rate for both sexes has increased from 3.6% in 1975 to 6.7% in 2014. In &quot;limited-stage&quot; disease, the relative 5-year survival rate (both sexes, all races, all ages) is 21.3%; however, women have higher 5-year survival rates, 26.9%, and men have lower survival rates, 21.3%. The prognosis is far grimmer in &quot;extensive-stage&quot; small-cell lung carcinoma where 5-year relative survival rate (both sexes, all races, all ages) is 2.8%; however, women have higher 5-year survival rates, 3.4%, and men have lower 5-year survival rates, 2.2%.

Small-cell carcinoma is very responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and in particular, regimens based on platinum-containing agents. However, most people with the disease relapse, and median survival remains low. The overall incidence and mortality rates of SCLC in the United States have decreased during the past few decades.

Long-term survival of more than 5 years can be achieved with proper treatment. According to the 17th World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC), &quot;patients who received chest radiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation along with a mean of five chemotherapy cycles could achieve a median survival of more than 5 years.&quot; In some cases, long-term survival of 10+ years is achieved with chemotherapy and radiation alone.

A 2023 article stated that the median overall survival is about 1 year, the worst of any lung cancer subtype.

==Epidemiology==
Small cell lung carcinoma accounts for 15% of lung cancers in the United States. Small cell lung cancer occurs almost exclusively in smokers – most commonly in heavy smokers and rarely in non-smokers.

==Society==
In 2013, the US Congress passed the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act, which mandated increased attention to certain recalcitrant cancers (cancers having a 5-year relative survival rate of less than 50%), including small cell lung cancer. That led to the National Cancer Institute supporting small cell-specific research.

=== Notable cases ===
* Dustin Diamond, perhaps best known as an actor on Saved by the Bell, died one month after the diagnosis.
* Asbjørn Sennels, Danish football player, died three months after the diagnosis.

<doc id="1021242" wikidata="Q42703" url="?curid=1021242" title="Cat show">
<text>A cat show is a judged event where the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard. Both pedigreed and companion (or moggy) cats are admissible, although the rules differ from organization to organization. Cats are compared to a breed standard, and the owners of those judged to be closest to it are awarded a prize. Moggys are judged based on their temperament. Often, at the end of the year, all of the points accrued at various shows are added up and more national and regional titles are awarded.

==Australia==
In Australia, the shows can be either &quot;closed style&quot; or &quot;open style&quot; judging. In closed shows, the cats are placed in undecorated cages with white curtains and a bed. The owners must then leave the hall. The judges for each ring will examine each animal in turn and decide on awards. Then the owner may return. In open style, the owners and other spectators may stay to watch the judging, as the judges talk to them about the cats. Some popular events that hosts cat shows include the annual Sydney Royal Easter Show held at Sydney&#x27;s Olympic Park, and the Cat Lovers Show, held in Melbourne and Sydney.

==Europe==

In Europe, many times the cats are judged in a so-called traditional style. Traditional judging is often combined with ring style judging, so a cat show may consist of several rings plus traditional judging. With traditional judging, each cat is assigned to a judge, who gives a written report to the owner. Each judge may nominate a cat to the final judging, when all judges examine the finalists, and the final rewards are given by voting of the judges.

The Supreme Cat Show is held each October at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, England.

==United States==
In the US, each judge has a separate ring with cages. The cats are brought up to the judge, who removes each cat in turn and then replaces them when they are done. Spectators, including the owners of the cats, are present and in the audience. The cats&#x27; owners are given a number for each cat and are responsible for getting them to the ring when they are called.

===CFA cat shows and titles===
The US Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) is the world&#x27;s largest registry of pedigreed cats and the predominant pedigreed cat registering association in North America. While no two shows are identical, CFA cat shows follow certain procedures and guidelines:

A CFA cat show actually consists of a number of simultaneous cat shows running at the same time within the same place. Depending on the size of the show, there are anywhere from 4 to 12 &quot;rings&quot; (or miniature shows) which generally run one to two days in length. Each &quot;ring&quot; has its own judge who independently scores cats and awards the top 10 places (or top 15 depending on the size of the show).

Rings are of two kinds:
* &quot;All Breed&quot; rings allow cats of every breed approved by the CFA to be judged.
* &quot;Specialty&quot; rings separate out cats into one of two types: &quot;Long Hair&quot; category include cats like Persians, Maine Coons, and other long-haired cats. &quot;Short Hair&quot; include Burmese, Sphynx, American Short Hair and other short-haired cats.

Points are awarded to cats based multiple of their placement within each ring combined with the number of cats that the cat has &quot;beaten&quot; in the ring.
* At the end of each show season, the top 25 cats in the country with the most points for the show season are awarded the coveted title of &quot;National Winner&quot; (NW).
* Cats in the top 25 of their &quot;region&quot; (usually several states) are awarded the prestigious title of &quot;Regional Winner&quot;.
* Adult cats which are not neutered and achieve a point ranking of over 200 points are awarded the title of &quot;Grand Champion&quot;.
* Neutered cats can be shown in a class called &quot;Premier&quot; and achieve the title of &quot;Grand Premier&quot; once they have achieved a point ranking of over 75 points.
* Cats which meet the standards of the breed as confirmed by six judges at one show are awarded &quot;winners ribbon&quot; by each judge and are awarded the lowest title of &quot;Champion&quot; or &quot;Premier&quot;.
* Kittens from the age of 4 to 8 months compete in a separate &quot;Kitten&quot; class, and are also able to achieve the title of &quot;National Winner&quot; and &quot;Regional Winner&quot;, but can not become Grand Champions or Grand Premiers until reaching adulthood at 8 months of age.
* Adult cats being shown at a show with no existing title are referred to as &quot;Open&quot;.

<doc id="1021245" wikidata="Q7737594" url="?curid=1021245" title="The Gravel Pit">
<text>The Gravel Pit is a band from Boston&#x27;s underground music scene, circa 1985–present.

==Biography==
In 1995, Jed Parish, Lucky Jackson, Ed Valauskas and Pete Caldes came to Boston as The Gravel Pit—an accomplished young rock band from New Haven, CT, seasoned by a few years of high-energy club gigs and a solid indie debut (Crash Land, on Feralette Records) based on influences like the Clash and The Undertones. Gradually incorporating a range of influences from mod to metal and invested with Parish&#x27;s extraordinary gifts as a songwriter and singer, the band quickly generated a buzz on the Boston scene. Their early fans included such local pop stars as Kay Hanley and Jen Trynin, whose spirited support helped to bring the Pit to the attention of their Boston-based indie label, Q Division Records.

Within a year of their arrival in Boston, The Gravel Pit released the first of four Q Division releases. &quot;The Gravel Pit Manifesto&quot; (with pop-maestro producer Mike Denneen), was a brightly original, power-pop gem that earned them Best Indie Album and Best New Band at the 1996 Boston Music Awards. Their wildly energetic live shows and diverse catalogue of power-pop gems kept the momentum going strong for the next three years. They played hundreds of dates, opened for acts as diverse as Graham Parker, Cheap Trick, Gang of Four, Morphine, Guided By Voices, Nada Surf and They Might Be Giants and released three more records on Q,: 1997&#x27;s full-length &quot;No One Here Gets In For Free&quot;—Rare and Unreleased 1989 - 1997;the 1998 hit single &quot;Favorite,&quot; produced by Denneen; and 1999&#x27;s full-length &quot;Silver Gorilla&quot;, also with Denneen, which amassed critical raves across the country, from &quot;Raygun&quot; to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. The Gravel Pit won the Boston Regional Poll at The 1st Annual Independent Music Awards.

After their national Silver Gorilla tour, without the big break of a major label deal and commercial exposure, the band decided to tone down their intense live performance schedule and spread out their efforts for a while. Valauskas, Jackson and Caldes formed The Gentlemen, a hugely popular hard-rock act, with Mike Gent of the Figgs. Parish has been exploring the vast and varied terrain of his musical tastes as a solo artist.

Their separate explorations did not diminish their collective chemistry. With the release of 2001&#x27;s &quot;Mass Avenue Freeze-out&quot; on Q Division, The Gravel Pit came together to stake another claim as one of the most inspired power-pop outfits on the American independent music scene.

The Gravel Pit contributed a cover of the Miracle Legion song &quot;Closer to the Wall&quot; for the 2009 Mark Mulcahy tribute album &quot;Ciao My Shining Star&quot;. It appears as a bonus track available on the deluxe edition. On September 20, 2009 Jed Parish, Ed Valauskas &amp; Pete Caldes performed at the release party for the album with Frank Black and Ray Neal on Black&#x27;s contribution to the album, &#x27;Bill Jocko&#x27;, at the Music Hall of Williamsburg. Valauskas, Caldes &amp; Neal remained on stage to perform two Pixies songs &#x27;Cactus&#x27; and &#x27;Gouge Away&#x27;.

The band released their first album in 13 years, Serpent Umbrella, in 2014.

<doc id="1021251" wikidata="Q1335515" url="?curid=1021251" title="Yasuhiro Nightow">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. His major work &quot;Trigun&quot; was adapted into an anime series and film. He also designed the characters for the video game and anime series &quot;Gungrave&quot;, and has been working on the manga &quot;Blood Blockade Battlefront&quot;.

==Biography==
Nightow was born in Yokohama, and moved to Yokosuka when he was in elementary school, and spent his junior high and high school years in Shizuoka. His first exposure to comics was through Fujio Akatsuka&#x27;s &quot;Tensai Bakabon&quot;, and he was also influenced by the comics of Leiji Matsumoto such as &quot;Cosmoship Yamato&quot;, &quot;Captain Harlock&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;. He also was drawn to the work done in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; which included artists Rumiko Takahashi and Fujihiko Hosono. Regarding &quot;new wave&quot; artists, he liked Katsuhiro Otomo from &quot;Sayonara Nippon&quot;, and Fumiko Takano.

He studied social science and then majored in media studies at Housei University. While there, he drew manga as a hobby, and made some &quot;dojinshi&quot;. After graduation, he worked Sekisui House where he sold apartments. After three and a half years, he quit his job to draw full-time. His first one-shot manga was based on the popular video game franchise &quot;Samurai Spirits&quot;. He had also developed a story titled &quot;Call XXXX&quot; which was published in &quot;Super Jump&quot; magazine.

With the help of a publisher friend, he submitted a &quot;Trigun&quot; story for the February 1995 issue of the Tokuma Shoten magazine &quot;Shōnen Captain&quot;, and began regular serialization two months later in April. However, &quot;Shōnen Captain&quot; was canceled early in 1997, and when Nightow was approached by the magazine &quot;Young King Ours&quot;, published by Shōnen Gahōsha, they were interested in him beginning a new work. Nightow though, was troubled by the idea of leaving Trigun incomplete, and requested to be allowed to finish the series. The publishers were sympathetic, and the manga resumed in 1997 as . The story jumps forward two years with the start of &quot;Maximum&quot;. Despite this, Nightow has stated that the new title was purely down to the change of publishers. &quot;Trigun Maximum&quot; ran until 2007 and generated 14 tankōbon volumes. The &quot;Trigun&quot; series was adapted into an anime series by Madhouse and had a limited broadcast run in 1998. It received an English adaptation which aired on Cartoon Network. Its popularity in the United States resulted in creation of a feature film &quot;&quot; in 2010.

Nightow created the characters and story for the Sega/Red Entertainment third-person shooter video game series &quot;Gungrave&quot;. The series also received an anime adaptation.

In 2009, Nightow started a new manga series &quot;Blood Blockade Battlefront&quot;, which was serialized in &quot;Jump Square&quot; various magazines from &quot;Jump SQ.19&quot; to &quot;Jump SQ. Crown&quot;. The series follows the adventures of a photographer who acquires supernatural visions and gets involved in an organization to fight monsters and terrorists.

<doc id="1021254" wikidata="Q369157" url="?curid=1021254" title="Meningioma">
<text>Meningioma, also known as meningeal tumor, is typically a slow-growing tumor that forms from the meninges, the membranous layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms depend on the location and occur as a result of the tumor pressing on nearby tissue. Many cases never produce symptoms. Occasionally seizures, dementia, trouble talking, vision problems, one sided weakness, or loss of bladder control may occur.
Risk factors include exposure to ionizing radiation such as during radiation therapy, a family history of the condition, and neurofibromatosis type 2. They appear to be able to form from a number of different types of cells including arachnoid cells. Diagnosis is typically by medical imaging.
If there are no symptoms, periodic observation may be all that is required. Most cases that result in symptoms can be cured by surgery. Following complete removal fewer than 20% recur. If surgery is not possible or all the tumor cannot be removed, radiosurgery may be helpful. Chemotherapy has not been found to be useful. A small percentage grow rapidly and are associated with worse outcomes.
About one per thousand people in the United States are currently affected. Onset is usually in adults. In this group they represent about 30% of brain tumors. Women are affected about twice as often as men. Meningiomas were reported as early as 1614 by Felix Plater.

==Signs and symptoms==

Small tumors (e.g., &lt; 2.0 cm) usually are incidental findings at autopsy without having caused symptoms. Larger tumors may cause symptoms, depending on the size and location.
* Focal seizures may be caused by meningiomas that overlie the cerebrum.
* Progressive spastic weakness in legs and incontinence may be caused by tumors that overlie the parasagittal frontoparietal region.
* Tumors of the Sylvian aqueduct may cause myriad motor, sensory, aphasic, and seizure symptoms, depending on the location.
* Increased intracranial pressure eventually occurs, but is less frequent than in gliomas.
* Diplopia (Double vision) or uneven pupil size may be symptoms if related pressure causes a third and/or sixth nerve palsy.

==Causes==
The causes of meningiomas are not well understood. Most cases are sporadic, appearing randomly, while some are familial. Persons who have undergone radiation, especially to the scalp, are more at risk for developing meningiomas, as are those who have had a brain injury. Atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima had a higher than typical frequency of developing meningiomas, with the incidence increasing the closer that they were to the site of the explosion. Dental X-rays are correlated with an increased risk of meningioma, in particular for people who had frequent dental X-rays in the past, when the X-ray dose of a dental X-ray was higher than in the present.

Having excess body fat increases the risk. In 2020, the European Medicine Agency issued a warning that high doses of cyproterone acetate may contribute to risk of meningioma, and to use the minimum dosage or alternative treatment for most indications, with the exception of prostate carcinoma.

A 2012 review found that mobile telephone use was unrelated to meningioma.

People with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF-2) have a 50% chance of developing one or more meningiomas.

92% of meningiomas are benign. 8% are either atypical or malignant.

===Genetics===
The most frequent genetic mutations (~50%) involved in meningiomas are inactivation mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 gene (merlin) on chromosome 22q.

&quot;TRAF7&quot; mutations are present in about one-fourth of meningiomas. Mutations in the &quot;TRAF7&quot;, &quot;KLF4&quot;, &quot;AKT1&quot;, and &quot;SMO&quot; genes are commonly expressed in benign skull-base meningiomas. Mutations in NF2 are commonly expressed in meningiomas located in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres.

==Pathophysiology==

Meningiomas arise from arachnoidal cap cells, most of which are near the vicinity of the venous sinuses, and this is the site of greatest prevalence for meningioma formation. Some subtypes may arise from the pial cap cells that migrate during the development together with blood vessels into the brain parenchyma. They most frequently are attached to the dura over the superior parasagittal surface of frontal and parietal lobes, along the sphenoid ridge, in the olfactory grooves, the Sylvian region, superior cerebellum along the &quot;falx cerebri&quot;, cerebellopontine angle, and the spinal cord. The tumor is usually gray, well-circumscribed, and takes on the form of the space it occupies. They usually are dome-shaped, with the base lying on the dura.

===Locations===
* Falx cerebri falcine (25%)
* Convexity (surface of the brain) (19%)
* Sphenoid ridge (17%)
* Suprasellar (9%)
* Posterior fossa (8%)
* Olfactory groove (8%)
* Middle fossa/Meckel&#x27;s cave (4%)
* Tentorial (3%)
* Peri-torcular (3%)
* Intraparenchymal (rare)

Other uncommon locations are the lateral ventricle, foramen magnum, and the orbit/optic nerve sheath. Meningiomas also may occur as a spinal tumor, more often in women than in men. This occurs more often in Western countries than Asian.

Histologically, meningioma cells are relatively uniform, with a tendency to encircle one another, forming whorls and psammoma bodies (laminated calcific concretions). As such, they also have a tendency to calcify and are highly vascularized.

Meningiomas often are considered benign tumors that can be removed by surgery, but most recurrent meningiomas correspond to histologic benign tumors. The metabolic phenotype of these benign recurrent meningiomas indicated an aggressive metabolism resembling that observed for atypical meningioma.

==Diagnosis==


Meningiomas are visualized readily with contrast CT, MRI with gadolinium, and arteriography, all attributed to the fact that meningiomas are extra-axial and vascularized. CSF protein levels are usually found to be elevated when lumbar puncture is used to obtain spinal fluid. On T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI, they may show a typical dural tail sign absent in some rare forms of meningiomas.

Although the majority of meningiomas are benign, they may have malignant presentations. Classification of meningiomas are based upon the WHO classification system.
* Benign (Grade I) – (90%) – meningothelial, fibrous, transitional, psammomatous, angioblastic
* Atypical (Grade II) – (7%) – chordoid, clear cell, atypical (includes brain invasion)
* Anaplastic/malignant (Grade III) – (2%) – papillary, rhabdoid, anaplastic (most aggressive)
In a 2008 review of the latter two categories, atypical and anaplastic-meningioma cases, the mean overall survival for atypical meningiomas was found to be 11.9 years vs. 3.3 years for anaplastic meningiomas. Mean relapse-free survival for atypical meningiomas was 11.5 years vs. 2.7 years for anaplastic meningiomas.

Malignant anaplastic meningioma is aggressive. Although anaplastic meningioma has higher chances of distant metastasis than the other two types, the overall incidence of meningioma metastasis is only 0.18%; which is considered rare. Even if, by general rule, neoplasms of the nervous system (brain tumors) cannot metastasize into the body because of the blood–brain barrier, anaplastic meningioma can. Although they are inside the cerebral cavity, they are located on the bloodside of the BBB, because meningiomas tend to be connected to blood vessels. Thus, cancerized cells can escape into the bloodstream, which is why meningiomas, when they metastasize, often turn up around the lungs.

Anaplastic meningioma and hemangiopericytoma are difficult to distinguish, even by pathological means, as they look similar, especially, if the first occurrence is a meningeal tumor, and both tumors occur in the same types of tissue.

Although usually benign a &quot;petro-clival&quot; menigioma is typically fatal without treatment due to its location. Until the 1970s no treatment was available for this type of meningioma; however, since that time a range of surgical and radiological treatments have evolved. Nevertheless, the treatment of this type of meningioma remains a challenge with relatively frequent poor outcomes.

==Prevention==
The risk of meningioma can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight, and by avoiding unnecessary dental x-rays.

==Treatment==

===Observation===
Observation with close imaging follow-up may be used in select cases if a meningioma is small and asymptomatic. In a retrospective study on 43 patients, 63% of patients were found to have no growth on follow-up, and the 37% found to have growth at an average of 4 mm / year. In this study, younger patients were found to have tumors that were more likely to have grown on repeat imaging; thus are poorer candidates for observation. In another study, clinical outcomes were compared for 213 patients undergoing surgery vs. 351 patients under watchful observation. Only 6% of the conservatively treated patients developed symptoms later, while among the surgically treated patients, 5.6% developed persistent morbid condition, and 9.4% developed surgery-related morbid condition.

Observation is not recommended in tumors already causing symptoms. Furthermore, close follow-up with imaging is required with an observation strategy to rule out an enlarging tumor.

===Surgery===
Meningiomas usually can be surgically resected (removed) and result in a permanent cure if the tumor is superficial on the dural surface and easily accessible. Transarterial embolization has become a standard preoperative procedure in the preoperative management. If invasion of the adjacent bone occurs, total removal is nearly impossible. It is rare for benign meningiomas to become malignant.

The probability of a tumor recurring or growing after surgery may be estimated by comparing the tumor&#x27;s WHO (World Health Organization) grade and by the extent of surgery by the Simpson Criteria.

===Radiation therapy===
Radiation therapy may include photon-beam or proton-beam treatment, or fractionated external beam radiation. Radiosurgery may be used in lieu of surgery in small tumors located away from critical structures. Fractionated external-beam radiation also can be used as primary treatment for tumors that are surgically unresectable or, for patients who are inoperable for medical reasons.

Radiation therapy often is considered for WHO grade I meningiomas after subtotal (incomplete) tumor resections. The clinical decision to irradiate after a subtotal resection is somewhat controversial, as no class I randomized, controlled trials exist on the subject. Numerous retrospective studies, however, have suggested strongly that the addition of postoperative radiation to incomplete resections improves both progression-free survival (i.e. prevents tumor recurrence) and improves overall survival.

In the case of a grade III meningioma, the current standard of care involves postoperative radiation treatment regardless of the degree of surgical resection. This is due to the proportionally higher rate of local recurrence for these higher-grade tumors. Grade II tumors may behave variably and there is no standard of whether to give radiotherapy following a gross total resection. Subtotally resected grade II tumors should be radiated.

===Chemotherapy===
Likely, current chemotherapies are not effective. Antiprogestin agents have been used, but with variable results. A 2007 study of whether hydroxyurea has the capacity to shrink unresectable or recurrent meningiomas is being further evaluated.

==Epidemiology==
Many individuals have meningiomas, but remain asymptomatic, so the meningiomas are discovered during an autopsy. One to two percent of all autopsies reveal meningiomas that were unknown to the individuals during their lifetime, since there were never any symptoms. In the 1970s, tumors causing symptoms were discovered in 2 out of 100,000 people, while tumors discovered without causing symptoms occurred in 5.7 out of 100,000, for a total incidence of 7.7/100,000. With the advent of modern sophisticated imaging systems such as CT scans, the discovery of asymptomatic meningiomas has tripled.

Meningiomas are more likely to appear in women than men, though when they appear in men, they are more likely to be malignant. Meningiomas may appear at any age, but most commonly are noticed in men and women age 50 or older, with meningiomas becoming more likely with age. They have been observed in all cultures, Western and Eastern, in roughly the same statistical frequency as other possible brain tumors.

==History==
The neoplasms currently referred to as meningiomas were referred to with a wide range of names in older medical literature, depending on the source. Various descriptors included &quot;fungoid tumors&quot;, &quot;fungus of the dura mater&quot;, &quot;epithelioma&quot;, &quot;psammoma&quot;, &quot;dural sarcoma&quot;, &quot;dural endothelioma&quot;, &quot;fibrosarcoma&quot;, &quot;angioendothelioma&quot;, &quot;arachnoidal fibroboastoma&quot;, &quot;endotheliosis of the meninges&quot;, &quot;meningeal fibroblastoma&quot;, &quot;meningoblastoma&quot;, &quot;mesothelioma of the meninges&quot;, &quot;sarcoma of the dura&quot;, and others.

The modern term of &quot;meningioma&quot; was used first by Harvey Cushing (1869–1939) in 1922, to describe a set of tumors that occur throughout the neuraxis (brain and spinal cord), but have various commonalities. Charles Oberling then separated these into subtypes based on cell structure and, over the years, several other researchers have defined dozens of different subtypes as well. In 1979, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified seven subtypes, upgraded in 2000 to a classification system with nine low-grade variants (grade I tumors) and three variants each of grade II and grade III meningiomas. The most common subtypes are Meningotheliomatous (63%), transitional or mixed-type (19%), fibrous (13%), and psammomatous (2%).

The earliest evidence of a probable meningioma is from a skull approximately 365,000 years old, which was found in Germany. Other probable examples have been discovered in other continents around the world, including North and South America, and Africa.

The earliest written record of what was probably a meningioma is from the 1600s, when Felix Plater (1536–1614) of the University of Basel performed an autopsy on Sir Caspar Bonecurtius. Surgery for removal of a meningioma was first attempted in the sixteenth century, but the first known successful surgery for removal of a meningioma of the convexity (parasagittal) was performed in 1770 by Anoine Luis. The first documented successful removal of a skull base meningioma was performed in 1835 by Zanobi Pecchioli, Professor of Surgery at the University of Siena. Other notable meningioma researchers have been William Macewen (1848–1924), and William W. Keen (1837–1932).

Improvements in meningioma research and treatment over the last century have occurred in terms of the surgical techniques for removal of the tumor, and related improvements in anesthesia, antiseptic methods, techniques to control blood loss, better ability to determine which tumors are and are not operable, and to effectively differentiate between the different meningioma subtypes.

<text>In anatomy, the supratentorial region of the brain is the area located above the tentorium cerebelli. The area of the brain below the tentorium cerebelli is the infratentorial region. The supratentorial region contains the cerebrum, while the infratentorial region contains the cerebellum.

Although the Roman era anatomist Galen commented upon it, the functional significance of this neuroanatomical division was first described using ‘modern’ terminology by John Hughlings Jackson, founding editor of the medical journal &quot;Brain&quot;.

From extensive studies of anatomy and behaviour, Hughlings Jackson established the existence of a clear division of cognitive functionality located at or around the tentorium cerebelli. In his proposed scheme, while the supratentorial parts (mainly the cerebrum) were responsible for planning and control of movement in the world, the infratentorial parts (mainly the cerebellum) were responsible for planning and control of bodily motion per se.

Most primary tumors of the central nervous system are located supratentorial.

<text>Lo-Pro is the debut studio album of Lo-Pro, released on September 30, 2003. It had one single in &quot;Sunday&quot; which garnered considerable radio play upon release. Throughout 2003 and 2004, Lo-Pro toured with groups like Staind and Three Days Grace in promotion of the album before being dropped from their record label.

==Background==

Singer Pete Murray and guitarist Neil Godfrey had previously played together in the band Ultraspank. After releasing 2 albums in 1998 and 2000, the band split up in 2001. Burned out and disillusioned, everyone parted ways to do their own thing. However, Murray and Godfrey eventually got back together with making music. Godfrey summed it up as:
During the Spank progression Pete M. had always been doing his best to record stuff, keeping up on technology updates. By the end of that time he was getting really good with Pro-Tools. So I think about 2 or 3 weeks went by and I&#x27;d been playing my guitar. I called up Pete and said I had some ideas to lay down.The Spank guys were all going in different directions. With the pressures of the industry gone and the freedom to do anything I wanted, we started writing songs. The result was so refreshing in the fact that we could record ourselves and make these great sounding recordings we could listen to.

The demos they created in these sessions were the starting point for the album. Eventually, they were able to gain the attention of Aaron Lewis, lead singer of the band Staind, and was signed to his vanity label, &quot;413 Records&quot;, through Geffen. Through this, they configured the rest of the band, and began work on the actual album, with producing being done by Aaron Lewis and Don Gilmore.

==Release==
The album was released on September 30, 2003. It peaked at no. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart, and stayed on the chart for two weeks. One single, &quot;Sunday&quot;, was released from the album, and while it did receive moderate radio airplay, another single was never released, and the band was later dropped from the label in mid-2004.

Murray later would express a number of regrets on the album, ranging from it being &quot;over-produced&quot; to not releasing &quot;Oblivion&quot; as a single.

<text>St. John&#x27;s College is an Anglican-based independent constituent college of the University of Manitoba, located on the university&#x27;s Fort Garry campus in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

The college is the oldest Anglophone institution of higher learning in western Canada and maintains its strong connection to the Anglican Church of Canada.

The University of Manitoba Press has its office in 301 St. John&#x27;s College. St. John&#x27;s College, itself, operates a small publisher at the U of M called St. John&#x27;s College Press.

==History==
With a strong Anglican affiliation, St John&#x27;s College was officially opened by the newly arrived Bishop Robert Machray on 1 November 1866. The roots of the college, however, lie in the early years of the Red River Colony, where it served as a school for the settlers.

=== Background ===
The first Anglican cleric in the Northwest interior of Canada was the Reverend John West who, in 1820, established the first Anglican school in the Red River Colony (or Red River Settlement). In 1849, the growth of the Colony led to the creation of the Diocese of Rupert&#x27;s Land, for which the first bishop was David Anderson.

When Anderson arrived at Red River, he established the first school to bear the name &quot;St. John&#x27;s&quot;. For the school and the proposed theological college that would grow from it, Anderson chose the motto that remains the college motto to this day: &quot;In Thy light we shall see light&quot; (Psalm 36, verse 9). The new school provided both academic and missionary instruction to the people of the settlement and of the North. By 1859, declining enrolment and a lack of qualified teachers forced the bishop to close the school.

=== Establishment ===
In 1865, Robert Machray became the Bishop of Rupert&#x27;s Land, arriving in the Red River Settlement later that same year. Recognizing the need for an Anglican college, Machray set about finding the necessary funds to reopen St. John&#x27;s. The buildings from Bishop Anderson&#x27;s school were renovated, while others were acquired to house the new school&#x27;s boarders and faculty. The Reverend John Mclean came from London, Ontario, to become the college&#x27;s first warden.

When the school was reopened on 1 November 1866 (All Saints&#x27; Day), it had 19 boys attending as either boarders or day students and 3 students enrolled in theology courses.

In 1877, St John&#x27;s College consolidated with St. Boniface College (Roman Catholic) and the Manitoba College (Presbyterian) to become the founding colleges of the University of Manitoba. This consolidation was a way to strengthen the small and financially insecure College; nonetheless, St John&#x27;s maintained, and continues to maintain, its strong connection to the Anglican Church.

In 1882, planning began of a new building for the college at a 4-acre lot on the west side of Winnipeg&#x27;s Main Street at Church Avenue. The 3½-storey brick building was completed in 1884 at an approximate cost of $55,000. It had several classrooms as well as residential space for 20 students. In mid-1945, the college moved to a more central location in downtown Winnipeg and the building was demolished in 1950.

=== Later development ===
By 1900, the college had become a coeducational, liberal arts college, as professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law, and medicine in the early part of the 20th century. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.

In 1912, a 3-storey brick-&amp;-stone structure was built on Church Avenue in Winnipeg to provide additional classroom and residential space for the nearby St. John&#x27;s College. The basement had two classrooms, washrooms, a day room for students, and a mechanical room. On the main level were 3 classrooms, library, ladies’ parlour, and cloakroom, Master&#x27;s room, Warden&#x27;s office, and 4 bedrooms. The second and third floors each had a central communal bathroom and 16 bedrooms.

The college moved to the University of Manitoba&#x27;s Fort Garry campus in 1958, with dormitories for men and women to the east, teaching and administration to the west, and the chapel to the north.

The policy of university education that was initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.

The stained glass at the college has since been documented by the Institute for Stained Glass in Canada.

St. John&#x27;s College&#x27;s arms were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 15 October 2006.

== Administration and governance ==
As an independent constituent college of the University of Manitoba, St. John&#x27;s College is governed under the terms of the act of its incorporation, Act to incorporate St John&#x27;s College (Chapter 39 of the &quot;Statues of the Province of Manitoba, 1871&quot;, re-enacted in 1990 as Chapter 171). The statutes of the college are amended, repealed, or replaced by the Synod of the Diocese of Rupert&#x27;s Land, most recently in 1992 and 2002.

The college is governed through a bicameral system: The College Council determines the overall direction, policies, and financing of the college; and the College Assembly has responsibility for academic matters within the college and for the day-to-day operation of the college (including approving the annual budget) within the fiscal policies established by Council.

The council is also responsible for maintaining a direct formal connection with the Diocese of Rupert&#x27;s Land. The council has representation from both the Diocese and from Assemble, including at least 1 student. All Fellows and Officers of the college are members of Assembly, which also includes representation from students of the college and Diocesan Council.

While having its own Council and Assembly, in all academic matters other than the Theology program, the college is subject to the regulations of the University of Manitoba Senate.
== Student life ==
The college has its own residence for students attending the University of Manitoba, which has a membership of 100 students.

Students at St. John&#x27;s are represented by the St. John&#x27;s College Students&#x27; Association (SJCSA).

<text>Informally, a vanity label (compare vanity press) is a record label founded as a wholly or partially owned subsidiary of another, larger, and better established (at least at the time of the vanity label&#x27;s founding) record label, where the subsidiary is (at least nominally) controlled by a successful recording artist, designed to allow this artist to release music by other artists they admire. The parent label handles the production and distribution and funding of the vanity label, but the album is usually released with the vanity brand name prominent. Usually, the artist/head of the vanity label is signed to the parent label, and this artist&#x27;s own recordings will be released under the vanity brand name. Creating a vanity label can be an attractive idea for the parent label, primarily as a &quot;perk&quot; to keep a successful artist on the label&#x27;s roster happy and as a venue to bring fellow artists to the public&#x27;s attention.

<text>&quot;The Ultimate Computer&quot; is the twenty-fourth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by D.C. Fontana (based on a story by Laurence N. Wolfe) and directed by John Meredyth Lucas, it was first broadcast on March 8, 1968.

In the episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; race to disable a rogue computer in total control of the ship.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; is summoned to a space station without explanation. Commodore Wesley (Barry Russo) explains that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; will be a test vessel for the M-5 Multitronic System, a revolutionary tactical and control computer designed by Dr. Richard Daystrom (William Marshall). The M-5 is to handle all ship functions without human assistance. While Science Officer Spock is impressed with M-5, Captain Kirk and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy have doubts.

The M-5 succeeds at its first tasks, performing ship functions more quickly and efficiently than a living crew. However, M-5 also exhibits unexpected behavior, such as turning off power and life support to unoccupied parts of the ship, and drawing increased power for unknown reasons; Daystrom maintains M-5 is working properly. Spock and Kirk engage in a discussion about whether Spock would prefer to serve under a computer or Kirk.

In its first tactical drill, M-5 defends the &quot;Enterprise&quot; against mock attacks from Starships &quot;Excalibur&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot;. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; is declared the victor, and Wesley jokingly refers to Kirk as &quot;Captain Dunsel&quot;, employing a Starfleet Academy slang term for a part serving no useful purpose. Kirk is troubled by this.

Some time later, M-5 detects the &quot;Woden&quot;, an unmanned freighter, and attacks with live torpedoes, destroying it. Kirk orders M-5 taken offline, but on attempting to do so, finds it protected by a powerful force field. Chief Engineer Scott orders Ensign Harper to disconnect its power source, but the M-5 creates a direct connection to the ship&#x27;s warp engines, vaporizing Harper in the process. Spock and Scott attempt a manual override, but discover that the M-5 has rerouted all controls. Spock questions Daystrom on his computer design, and Daystrom reveals that he has imprinted human engrams onto M-5&#x27;s circuits, creating what amounts to a human mind operating at the speed of a computer.

Meanwhile, four of &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s sister ships, &quot;Lexington&quot;, &quot;Potemkin&quot;, &quot;Excalibur&quot;, and &quot;Hood&quot;, approach to begin a new tactical drill. Since M-5 has disabled communications, Kirk is unable to warn M-5&#x27;s targets. M-5 detects the ships, and attacks them with its weapons at full power. The crew watches helplessly as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; fires on the &quot;Lexington&quot;, killing 53, and then turns to the &quot;Excalibur&quot;, killing all aboard and leaving her adrift. Commodore Wesley assumes that Kirk himself is responsible for the attacks, and requests permission from Starfleet Command to destroy the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Daystrom, having indicated that the engrams he used were his own, believes he can reason with the M-5, but his conversation with the unit quickly degenerates into a self-pitying lament over his own career disappointments. McCoy warns Kirk that he sees a nervous breakdown coming, and as Daystrom begins loudly to proclaim his and his creation&#x27;s invincibility, Spock subdues him with a Vulcan nerve pinch.

Kirk then tries to persuade the M-5 to stop its attacks. The M-5 acknowledges Kirk, who asks M-5 what its purpose is. M-5 responds that its purpose is to protect lives. Kirk argues that it acted contrary to its purpose by murdering people. M-5 acknowledges that it has committed murder and must therefore die, and shuts itself down. In so doing, it also cripples the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Having received permission to destroy &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the other Federation ships close in. Since Scott is unable to restore communications immediately, Kirk decides to allow the ship to drift with shields down, hoping that Commodore Wesley will realize that the threat has passed. The gamble pays off as the Commodore orders his ships to stand down at the last moment. Spock reminds Kirk and McCoy that while computers are more efficient, they are not any better.

==Production and reception==
In 2011, this episode was noted by &quot;Forbes&quot; as one of the top ten episodes of the franchise that explores the implications of advanced technology, in particular the danger of A.I. In 2016, SyFy ranked guest star William Marshall&#x27;s performance as Dr. Daystrom as the 14th best guest star on the original series.

The original draft was given to Ray Bradbury by mathematician and &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan Laurence Wolfe to give to Gene Roddenberry.

Michelle Erica Green of Trek Today maintains that it is one of McCoy&#x27;s best episodes and praises the episode for taking place entirely on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. She states that the M-5 turns out to be one of &quot;Trek&quot;&#x27;s best villains.

<doc id="1021276" wikidata="Q234556" url="?curid=1021276" title="Brooke Hogan">
<text>Brooke Ellen Bollea (born May 5, 1988), better known by her stage name Brooke Hogan, is an American television personality and singer. The daughter of former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, she starred in the reality television series &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot; from 2005 to 2007. The show saw a then-teenage Brooke struggling with her overprotective father while pursuing her musical career.

As a recording artist, she used the show and her appearance on a one-hour special on VH1 to promote her musical work. She signed with SoBe Entertainment and record producer Scott Storch to release her debut studio album, &quot;Undiscovered&quot; (2006), which moderately entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was led by the single &quot;About Us&quot; (featuring Paul Wall), which peaked within the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

From 2008 to 2009, Hogan starred in her own television series, &quot;Brooke Knows Best&quot;. Though her parents and brother made numerous appearances throughout the series, it mainly focused on Brooke and the recording of her music. Her second album, &quot;The Redemption&quot; (2009), was released independently and narrowly entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Following the conclusion of &quot;Brooke Knows Best&quot;, Hogan has made numerous appearances in various media. In 2012, Hogan signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as an on-screen personality manager for their female division, The Knockouts.

== Early life ==
Brooke Ellen Bollea was born May 5, 1988, in Tampa, Florida, the older child of Hulk Hogan (Terry Gene Bollea) and Linda Claridge. She has one younger brother, Nick Hogan (Nick Bollea).

In high school, she took dance classes, voice lessons, piano lessons, and gymnastics. She joined the cheerleading squad of her Clearwater, Florida school, Clearwater Central Catholic High School, in her first year (though she only stayed at the school for the first half of first year). She also sang inhibitor chorus for CCCHS. Hogan graduated from high school at the age of sixteen.

== Career ==

=== 2002–2005: Music beginnings and reality series ===
Hogan was signed to Trans Continental Records in 2002. Some music was produced with LFO member Rich Cronin&#x27;s assistance. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Everything to Me&quot;, was released in July 2004. The song appeared at number one on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart in the United States, and number 97 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. To promote the album, Hogan toured with Hilary Duff on her Most Wanted Tour throughout the US, as well as with the Backstreet Boys on their Up Close &amp; Personal Tour, both of which took place from mid 2004 to early 2005. The album, &quot;Brooke Hogan: This Voice&quot;, was slated for a September 21, 2004 release date, but the album was not released due to TransContinental Records&#x27; bankruptcy.

Hogan and her father appeared in the hour-long profile &quot;(Inside) Out: Hulk Hogan, Stage Dad &quot; on VH1. The television special chronicled Hogan working on her debut album, as well as showed her father chaperoning her in the album making process. Her father later stated that one aim of the show was to help promote Brooke and her upcoming music career. The special was a major success for the network, and the success of the special led to VH1 turning it into an entire television series, titled &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot;. The series premiered in July 2005, and was the highest rated series in the network&#x27;s history. The show chronicled the Hogan family&#x27;s life together, although it mainly focused on Brooke and her over protective father. On the show, Hulk placed a GPS tracker on Brooke&#x27;s vehicle that enabled him to track her whereabouts and shut down the engine of her car remotely.

=== 2006–2008: &quot;Undiscovered&quot; and &quot;Brooke Knows Best&quot; ===
In 2006, Hogan became the first artist signed to Scott Storch&#x27;s label, initially called Storchaveli Records, but later named Storch Music Company. She also signed with &quot;SoBe Entertainment&quot;. Storch also became the album&#x27;s main producer. During an interview, Hogan stated that she was recording the album at The Hit Factory in Miami, Florida, where rapper Paul Wall heard a clip of the song &quot;About Us&quot; and asked to be on the song.

The lead single from the album, &quot;About Us&quot;, was premiered on the season two finale of &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot;. It quickly began receiving heavy radio rotation, and peaked at number 33 the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Undiscovered&quot; was released on October 24, 2006 in the United States and Canada. The album debuted at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and number 1 on the Independent Albums charts in the US, selling an estimated 30,000 copies in its first week of release.

To help promote the album, Hogan appeared in the November 2006 edition of &quot;FHM&quot;, becoming the first &quot;FHM&quot; cover model under 21 years old. As a result, the November issue had no liquor advertising. Dana Leslie Fields, executive publisher and president of &quot;FHM&quot;, said: &quot;In the very rare instance that you might have a cover star under the age of 21, they don&#x27;t want to be in the position of seeming to market to anyone under age.&quot;

To further promote the album, Hogan announced its second single would be &quot;Heaven Baby&quot;, which featured Beenie Man on guest vocals. The song was released to pop radio in January 2007. On March 6, &quot;For A Moment&quot; was released as a promotional single from the album, with a music video featuring clips of the third and fourth seasons of &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot;.

While working on her second studio album, the series &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot; was discontinued due to controversies involving Brooke&#x27;s immediate family. As a result, Brooke was approached by VH1 awhile thereafter and signed on to do her own series, &quot;Brooke Knows Best&quot;. The series premiered on July 13, 2008, and featured Hogan dealing with her family&#x27;s problems, her music career, and her life while no longer living with her parents nor dependent on them. The show consisted of her friends, Glenn and Ashley – who are often encouraging Brooke to get out, have fun, and party. Brooke, Glenn, and Ashley live in a penthouse in South Beach. The show chronicled the problems Brooke faced while dealing with the divorce of her parents, as well as brother Nick Hogan&#x27;s prior arrest related to a serious car accident in which he permanently injured his best friend. The series ended in 2009 after two seasons.

=== 2009–present: &quot;The Redemption&quot; and film debut ===

In early 2009, Hogan announced the title of her second album to be &quot;The Redemption&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Falling&quot;, featured rapper Stacks, and was released on March 31, 2009. On June 30, Hogan released the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Hey Yo!&quot;, which featured Colby O&#x27;Donis on guest vocals. On July 4, Hogan released a mixtape, titled &quot;Judgement Day&quot;, to help promote the release of the album. The mixtape caused a buzz online after the song &#x27;Ur Not That Hot&#x27; was seen as a diss toward &quot;The Hills&quot; star, and fellow pop singer, Heidi Montag. The song also includes a fake voicemail that Hogan implies was sent to her from Montag. &quot;The Redemption&quot; was released on July 21 in the US and Canada for digital download and as a physical copy. It debuted at number 144 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and 27 on the Independent Albums chart, selling 3,381 copies in its first week. She parted ways with SoBe Entertainment after the promotion for the album concluded.

In November 2009 Hogan was featured in Toni Braxton&#x27;s music video for &quot;Yesterday&quot;. In late 2009, Hogan made her first film appearance in the live action film &quot;Little Hercules in 3D&quot;, which was only released in certain territories outside of the US. It was released on October 8, 2009 in Kazakhstan and Russia, and in the Czech Republic on January 7, 2010.

Hogan appeared as Kate in the science fiction film &quot;2 Headed Shark Attack&quot;, which was released on January 17, 2012 in the United States. She also appeared as Sandy Powers in the film &quot;Sand Sharks&quot;, which was released on January 9 in the United Kingdom. She also performed as a voice actor for multiple characters on Adult Swim’s show, &quot;China, IL&quot;.

She confirmed on June 12, 2014 via her official Instagram account, that her new single would be called &quot;Beautiful&quot; and set a release date for fall of 2014. On July 13, 2015, Hogan released her first alternative country track titled &quot;Girlfriend&quot; on iTunes. In September 2015 Hogan released her first extended play ‘I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend’. In 2018 she released a follow-up EP ‘So Many Summers’. On November 1, 2019, Hogan released her newest pop single titled &quot;Touch My Body.&quot; An accompanying music video was released a week later on November 8, 2019.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== World Wrestling Entertainment (2006) ===

Brooke made her WWE debut on the July 15, 2006 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXIII&quot;, appearing with her father. Randy Orton came out and flirted with Brooke then challenged Hulk to a match at SummerSlam. Later in the parking lot after more flirting, Brooke got in their car and was unaware Orton would RKO Hulk. Orton would later appear on &quot;WWE Raw&quot; with a fake Hogan family and kissed the fake Brooke.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2012–2013) ===
On May 17, 2012, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), the wrestling promotion where her father worked, announced that Brooke had signed on to work in the promotion as an on-screen authority figure and a backstage consultant to the TNA Knockouts.

In July 2012, Brooke confirmed via her official Twitter account, that she has continued to write and develop her third studio album. Throughout the mid-2012, she has been appearing on Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), weekly on Thursday nights to help promote the female&#x27;s wrestling division. On the June 7 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, a week after Hogan&#x27;s TNA debut, Hogan gave Mickie James, Tara, Velvet Sky and Miss Tessmacher (now changed back to Brooke Tessmacher) a chance in a four-way match to earn another shot at Gail Kim&#x27;s TNA Women&#x27;s Knockout Championship, which was won by Miss Tessmacher. In June 2012, Hogan gave Velvet Sky a part featured in Montgomery Gentry&#x27;s music video for their song &quot;So Called Life&quot;. On the June 21 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hogan chose James over Sky as the next challenger for the Women&#x27;s Knockout Championship, but failed to recapture the title from Miss Tessmacher.

In July, Hulk Hogan, alongside Sting, began feuding with a mysterious group of masked men, who had dubbed themselves the Aces &amp; Eights. The group&#x27;s attack on Hulk Hogan on the July 12 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; was used to write Hulk Hogan off the show, as he was set to undergo another back surgery. On the August 16, 2012 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Hogan hired Taryn Terrell, as the referee for the TNA Women&#x27;s Knockout Championship match between Madison Rayne and Miss Tessmacher. In November, Hogan would move into a storyline with her father and Bully Ray after Austin Aries revealed a secret relationship between herself and Ray. After seeing them kissing in a parking garage on the December 20 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Hulk suspended Ray indefinitely on the January 3, 2013, episode. The following week, after Ray saved Hogan from a kidnapping by the Aces &amp; Eights, Hogan accepted his marriage proposal much to her father&#x27;s dismay. The ceremony took place the next week on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, where Ray&#x27;s groomsman Tazz interrupted and revealed himself to be a member of Aces &amp; Eights, leading to the group attacking Ray, Hulk Hogan, and the rest of the groomsmen. On the February 21 edition of Impact, after listening to Hogan plea, Hulk Hogan named Bully Ray the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship at Lockdown. At this event, Bully Ray would turn his back on Hogan and TNA by revealing himself as the President of the Aces &amp; Eights. On the following episodes of &quot;Impact&quot;, Bully Ray touted the fact that the public bought into his deceptive act the entire time to earn the trust of Sting, Hogan, and Hulk Hogan as a way to get a chance to capture the TNA World Title. Hogan continued to seek a divorce from her husband and got it ending the storyline. On August 16, 2013 it was reported that Hogan had parted ways with TNA.

In October 2016, TMZ reported that Hogan was forming a female wrestling league called the Daughters of Wrestling, along with the daughters of Roddy Piper, Diamond Dallas Page, and Kerry Von Erich.

== Personal life ==
Hogan was engaged to former Dallas Cowboys center Phil Costa. She ended the engagement in November 2013.

In 2015, an audio recording (and its transcripts) of her father Hulk Hogan making comments about her and using racial slurs in regards to her dating an African-American man at the time became the center of controversy that resulted in his contract with the WWE ending. Hulk Hogan&#x27;s comments described himself as the ideal husband and that he would bring &#x27;Hulkamania&#x27; on anyone who married his daughter. In response, she wrote a poem defending him.

Brooke married professional ice hockey defenseman Steven Oleksy on June 8, 2022, in a private ceremony in Orlando, Florida with Shirlene Pearson serving as maid of honor. 

On January 18, 2025, it was announced that Brooke and her husband Steven Oleksy have welcomed fraternal twins Oliver and Molly born January 15, 2025.

<text>V Shape Mind is an American alternative rock band. They released one major label album in 2003 before disbanding the following year.

==Background==

V Shape Mind was formed in 1999 and toured the local Illinois metal scene, during which they self-released an EP titled &quot;Metric&quot; in 2000. The band was discovered by renowned producer David Bottrill, who got them signed to Universal Records.

The band released their debut album, &quot;Cul-De-Sac&quot;, on September 9, 2003. The single &quot;Monsters&quot; features vocals from Mudvayne&#x27;s Chad Gray and received considerable radio play. Despite touring with such acts as Mudvayne and Powerman 5000, V Shape Mind struggled to gather any mainstream attention. Consequently, they have since broken up, pointing to difficulties with Universal Records as the key factor. They played their final show together on Thursday, May 6, 2004 at Lincoln Square Theater in their hometown of Decatur, Illinois.

==Members==

<doc id="1021289" wikidata="Q5436075" url="?curid=1021289" title="Faro del Comercio">
<text>Faro del Comercio is a monument designed by the accomplished Mexican architect Luis Barragán and constructed in 1984 by architect Raúl Ferrera. It is a recognizable sight in Monterrey among many other modern manmade landmarks, such as Neptune&#x27;s Fountain (Fuente de la Vida), the Monterrey City Hall, the Papal Bridge (El Puente del Papa), and the Bridge of Unity (Puente de la Unidad) in San Pedro, connecting that municipality to Monterrey. These sites are intended on one hand to complement the city&#x27;s few remaining traditional landmarks, such as, the Bishopric Palace (Palacio del Obispado) and Museum, the City&#x27;s Cathedral (Catedral Metropolitana de Nuestra Señora de Monterrey), the Central Post Office (old Monterrey City Hall), and the State of Nuevo León Government building, on the north end of the Macroplaza. On the other hand, they are also intended to project an image of a city that prides itself as being the most progressive large industrial city of Mexico.
El Faro del Comercio was built in commemoration of the founding of the Chamber of Commerce of Monterrey&#x27;s on its 100-year anniversary. It is located near the south end of the Macroplaza facing the City&#x27;s Cathedral and behind the new Monterrey City Hall. El Faro del Comercio is 69.80 meters tall and 12.33 meters wide. Its bright reddish-orange color attracts attention when visiting the Macroplaza, Monterrey&#x27;s central park.

At nights, the landmark frequently projects a rotating green spotlight which interrupts the city&#x27;s night sky with its beam in a somewhat random cycle in the Metropolitan Area of Monterrey. Recently (2007), many large reflecting white spotlights from the nearby Museum of Mexican History Museo de Historia Mexicana and Santa Lucia Riverwalk, and around the Bishopric Hill where in 2005 the largest Mexican flag was installed (Banderas monumentales) and flown at night, as well as from high-power reflectors of many commercial establishments, clash randomly in the sky, visible from most locations in Monterrey and the surrounding areas.

After failing or being &quot;out of commission&quot; for several years due to an impractical technical laser mechanism which intended to have three colored lasers and a much greater visual impact on the dark skies of the surrounding areas, some of the original mechanism was salvaged and partially replaced and redesigned to have some operational ability with the green color. The redesign has some success since green is the color for which the eye is most sensitive and allows the perception of more light for the power limitations. However, the new design falls far short of the original claims for the construction. The structure was repainted after the laser renovation and reinaugurated at the 196th Independence Day Anniversary celebration on September 16, 2006.

He earned two Filmfare Awards for Best Actor – Marathi for &quot;Dr. Prakash Baba Amte – The Real Hero&quot; and &quot;Natsamrat&quot;. He did the voice acting for Shere Khan in the Hindi version of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (2016). He played a supporting role in the Tamil language action film &quot;Kaala&quot; (2018), starring Rajnikanth. It was moderately successful at the box office.

===Break from mainstream films (2019-present)===
After appearing in &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; (2020) and &quot;Tadka&quot; (2022), in 2023, Patekar headlined Vivek Agnihotri directed &quot;The Vaccine War&quot;, which tells about the development of Covaxin during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The film was a commercial and critical failure but Patekar&#x27;s performance received high praise as Renuka Vyavahare of &quot;The Times of India&quot; wrote &quot;Nana Patekar is outstanding but the film reduces itself to being a government mouthpiece parading as a medical drama.&quot;

=== Singing career ===
Patekar did some playback singing in the films &quot;Yeshwant&quot; (1997), &quot;Wajood&quot; (1998) and &quot;Aanch&quot; (2003).

== Personal life ==
Patekar married Neelkanti at age 27. His father died of a heart attack when Nana was 28 and later Patekar also lost his first son. Patekar was a chain smoker until he quit at the age of 56. In an interview, he said that his father loved plays and encouraged him to watch them. This is how he developed his love for acting. Vijaya Mehta directed his first play. Patekar lives in Andheri, Mumbai in 1BHK apartment.

Patekar joined the Territorial Army as a Captain in 1988. He underwent a three-year training to prepare for the movie , and worked with General V. K. Singh, who had the rank of Colonel at that time and had a cameo appearance. During the Kargil War in 1999, Patekar also lent his services in the Maratha Light Infantry regiment at the rank of Major. He retired from the Territorial Army in 2013 as Lieutenant Colonel.

== Controversy ==
In 2008, Tanushree Dutta accused Patekar of sexually harassing her on the sets of the movie &quot;Horn &#x27;Ok&#x27; Pleassss&quot;. In March 2008, she filed a complaint with &#x27;CINTAA&#x27; (Cine &amp; TV Artists Association) but no action was taken then. This allegation was repeated in an interview in 2013 and again made in 2018. In late 2018, CINTAA apologized to Dutta admitting that the &quot;chief grievance of sexual harassment wasn&#x27;t even addressed (in 2008)&quot; but added that since the case was more than three years old, they could not reopen it.

In 2018, Dutta restated her accusation of sexual harassment by Patekar in 2018, and her accusations led to the Me Too movement coming to Bollywood. Subsequently, she complained to the Maharashtra Women Commission and demanded an investigation into the allegations of harassment levelled by her against Patekar, Ganesh Acharya, producer Samee Siddiqui, director Rakesh Sarang, and several Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) party workers. In the late hours of 1 October 2018, An FIR was registered against Patekar and three others at Oshiwara police station following a complaint by Dutta late on Wednesday night. Patekar, choreographer Ganesh Acharya, director Rakesh Sarang and producer Samee Siddiqui were booked for molestation and obscenity under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

In June 2019, Patekar was cleared of the sexual harassment charges. The B-Summary report filed by the Oshiwara police station in Mumbai said that the complaint filed by Dutta could be &quot;malicious&quot; and &quot;out of revenge&quot;. Dutta said that her lawyers may approach the Bombay High Court to reopen the case.

== Philanthropy ==
Patekar is known for his simple lifestyle and his generosity in donating to charities. He contributed money towards rebuilding of the flood ravaged villages in Bihar through the charitable organisation &quot;Anubhuthi&quot;. All the monetary remuneration he obtained for his performance in the movie &quot;Paathshaala&quot; was donated by him to five different charitable organisations. When he was awarded the Raj Kapoor award which carries a cash prize of Rs , he donated the entire amount towards drought relief activities in Maharashtra. He also provided financial aid to families of farmers who committed suicide due to indebtedness brought about by drought. He distributed cheques worth Rs 15,000 to 62 families of farmers from Vidarbha region in August 2015, and another 113 families from Latur and Osmanabad districts of Marathwada in September 2015.

In September 2015, Patekar established the Naam Foundation, with fellow Marathi actor Makarand Anaspure, which works to provide aid to farmers overcome by drought conditions in Maharashtra.

Using a Twitter campaign with the hashtag IcareIsupport, Patekar was able to obtain funds to help Maharashtra drought victims.

== Early life ==

Mala Sinha was born to Christian Nepali parents after they immigrated to West Bengal, India from the Nepalese plains. Her father&#x27;s name was Albert Sinha.

Mala&#x27;s initial name was Alda and her friends at school in Calcutta (now Kolkata) used to tease her by calling her Dalda (a brand of vegetable oil), so she changed her name to Baby Nazma on getting her first assignment as a child artiste. Later on, as an adult actor, she changed her name to Mala Sinha. As a child, she learnt dancing and singing. Although she was an approved singer of All India Radio, she has never done playback singing in films. As a singer, she has done stage shows in many languages from 1947 to 1975.

== Career ==
Mala Sinha started her career as child artist in Bengali films – &quot;Jai Vaishno Devi&quot; followed by &quot;Shri Krishan Leela&quot;, &quot;Jog Biyog&quot; and &quot;Dhooli&quot;. Noted Bengali director Ardhendu Bose saw her acting in a school play and took permission from her father to cast her as a heroine in his Bengali film &quot;Roshanara&quot; (1952), her cinematic debut.

After acting in a couple of films in Calcutta, Mala Sinha went to Bombay for a Bengali film. There she met Geeta Bali, a noted Bollywood actress, who was charmed by her and introduced her to director Kidar Sharma. Sharma cast her as a heroine in his &quot;Rangeen Ratein&quot;. Her first Hindi film was &quot;Badshah&quot; opposite Pradeep Kumar, then came &quot;Ekadashi&quot;, a mythological film opposite Trilok Kapoor. Both films did not do well, but her lead role in Kishore Sahu&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, paired opposite Pradeep Kumar, fetched her rave reviews in spite of it failing at the box office. Films such as &quot;Lai Batti&quot; (actor Balraj Sahni&#x27;s only directorial venture), &quot;Nausherwan-E-Adil&quot; where she starred as the fair maiden Marcia in Sohrab Modi&#x27;s romance about forbidden love and &quot;Phir Subah Hogi&quot;, which was director Ramesh Saigal&#x27;s adaptation of Dosteovsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; established Mala Sinha&#x27;s reputation as a versatile actress who took the maximum career risks by accepting unconventional roles.

She used to sing for All India Radio; she was not allowed to sing playback (even for herself) in the movies with the lone exception being 1972&#x27;s &quot;Lalkar&quot;. In the 1950s, she had string of hits opposite Pradeep Kumar such as &quot;Fashion&quot; (1957), &quot;Detective&quot; (1958) and &quot;Duniya Na Mane&quot; (1959). The films she did with Pradeep Kumar were men-oriented. In 1957, noted Bollywood actor and director Guru Dutt cast Mala Sinha in his film &quot;Pyaasa&quot; (1957) in a role originally intended for Madhubala. Mala Sinha performed in the relatively unsympathetic part of an ambitious woman who chooses to marry a rich man (played by actor Rehman) and have a loveless marriage, rather than a poor, unsuccessful poet; her impoverished lover (played by Guru Dutt) whom she ditches. &quot;Pyaasa&quot; remains to this day a classic in the history of Indian cinema and a turning point for Sinha.

After &quot;Pyaasa&quot;, her major successes were &quot;Phir Subah Hogi&quot; (1958) and Yash Chopra&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Dhool Ka Phool&quot;, (1959) that elevated her into a major dramatic star. She was part of many successful movies from 1958 to the early &#x27;60s such as &quot;Parvarish&quot; (1958), &quot;Ujala&quot;, &quot;Main Nashe Main Hoon&quot;, &quot;Duniya Na Mane&quot;, &quot;Love Marriage&quot; (1959), &quot;Bewaqoof&quot; (1960), &quot;Maya&quot; (1961), &quot;Hariyali Aur Rasta&quot;, &quot;Dil Tera Deewana&quot; (1962), &quot;Anpadh&quot; and &quot;Bombay Ka Chor&quot; (1962).

She consistently did lead roles in Bengali films throughout the 1950s to the 1970s. Her performance in films like Lookochoori (1958) opposite Kishore Kumar and Kelaghar (1959),Saathihaara and Shohorer Itikotha.

Sinha&#x27;s career&#x27;s best performances were in &quot;Bahurani&quot; (1963), &quot;Gumrah&quot;, &quot;Gehra Daag&quot;, &quot;Apne Huye Paraye&quot;, &quot;Nayi Roshni&quot; and &quot;Jahan Ara&quot;. Apart from pairing with Pradeep Kumar, her pairings opposite Raaj Kumar, Rajendra Kumar, Biswajit and Manoj Kumar in woman-oriented films were appreciated by audiences, with her work opposite Biswajit being the most popular. With Raaj Kumar, she gave box office hits like &quot;Phool Bane Angaare&quot;, &quot;Maryada&quot; and &quot;Karmayogi&quot; and opposite Manoj Kumar, gave commercial successes like &quot;Hariyali Aur Rasta&quot;, &quot;Apne Huye Paraye&quot; and &quot;Himalaya Ki God Mein&quot;. The hits with Rajendra Kumar were &quot;Devar Bhabhi&quot;, &quot;Dhool Ka Phool&quot;, &quot;Patang&quot;, &quot;Geet&quot; and &quot;Lalkar&quot;.

With Biswajit, her popular movies include &quot;Aasra&quot;, &quot;Night in London&quot;, &quot;Do Kaliyaan&quot;, &quot;Tamanna&quot;, &quot;Nai Roshni&quot; and critically acclaimed films &quot;Pyar Ka Sapna&quot;, &quot;Paisa Ya Pyaar&quot;, &quot;Jaal&quot; and &quot;Phir Kab Milogi&quot;. She did ten films with Biswajit. In 2007, they won the Star Screen Lifetime Achievement Award, calling them on stage together giving due respect to their popularity as a pair who have tasted box office success.

In her successful 1960s and 1970s roles, she was cast opposite her seniors like Kishore Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand and Pradeep Kumar, and the emerging stars from late 1950s like Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar and Raaj Kumar. She worked with many newcomers of her era including Manoj Kumar, Dharmendra, Rajesh Khanna, Sunil Dutt, Sanjay Khan, Jeetendra and Amitabh Bachchan. Her character&#x27;s power was as much as the heroes and most of the time her roles were more powerful than the hero. In most of her films from the 1960s, she got first billing in the credits, even before the heroes, with the exceptions being those with Kishore Kumar, Guru Dutt, Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Pradeep Kumar.

In 1966, Mala Sinha went to Nepal to act in a Nepali film called &quot;Maitighar&quot; when the Nepali film industry was still in its infancy. This was the only Nepali film she did in her career. The hero was an estate owner called Chidambar Prasad Lohani.

Soon after, she married C. P. Lohani with the blessings of her parents. From the beginning, theirs was a long-distance marriage with Lohani based in Kathmandu to look after his business and Mala Sinha living in Bombay with their daughter Pratibha. She continued acting after her marriage.

She has been a heroine in many Bengali films. In Bengali films, she has acted with Kishore Kumar and Uttam Kumar. Her last Bengali work as a female lead was &quot;Kabita&quot; (1977) which featured Ranjit Mullick and Kamal Haasan; it was a super-hit at the box office. She is noted for her strong women-oriented roles in films such as &quot;Dhool Ka Phool&quot;, &quot;Suhag Sindoor&quot;, &quot;Anpadh&quot;, &quot;Phir Subah Hogi&quot;, &quot;Hariyali Aur Rasta&quot;, &quot;Bahurani&quot;, &quot;Aasra&quot;, &quot;Do Kaliyaan&quot;, &quot;Gumrah&quot;, &quot;Ankhen&quot;, &quot;Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi&quot;, &quot;Himalay Ki God Mein&quot;, &quot;Do Kaliyaan&quot;, &quot;Holi Aayi Re&quot;, &quot;Nai Roshni&quot;, &quot;Mere Huzoor&quot;, &quot;Kangan&quot;, &quot;Archana&quot;, &quot;Maryada&quot; amongst others.

Of her repertoire, she said in 2001, she was rather partial to &quot;Jahan Ara&quot; (1964), a historical movie that Meena Kumari passed on to her:
From 1974, she cut down on her assignments as the lead actress in Hindi films. She accepted strong character roles in films like &quot;36 Ghante&quot; (1974), &quot;Zindagi&quot; (1976), &quot;Karmayogi&quot; (1978), &quot;Be-Reham&quot; (1980), &quot;Harjaee&quot; (1981), &quot;Yeh Rishta Na Tootay&quot; (1981), &quot;Babu&quot; (1985) and &quot;Khel&quot; (1992), which were popular.

In the early 1990s, Madhuri Dixit was promoted as the &quot;new Mala Sinha&quot; in magazines. But, after 1994, she completely withdrew from the industry and has given very few public appearances. In &quot;Dhool Ka Phool&quot; and B.R. Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Gumrah&quot;, she played the first unwed mother and adulterous wife respectively in Hindi cinema. As she grew older, she gracefully moved on to doing character roles that befitted her age. She was last seen in &quot;Zid&quot; (1994). Though Mala evinced as much interest in her daughter Pratibha&#x27;s career as her father did in her career, she was unable to achieve the same success for her daughter.

== Prostitution scandal ==
In 1978, during an income tax raid at Mala Sinha&#x27;s house in Bombay, bundles of cash amounting to Rs 12 lakh were recovered from a wall in her bathroom, which was a huge amount at the time. Initially, Mala Sinha reportedly told the tax officials that the money had been hidden in the bathroom wall by her father. However, when she was produced before the court during the trial of the case, she reportedly stated that she had earned the money by working as an escort. Mala Sinha is reported to have been scared of losing the money, and is said to have taken the drastic step of admitting to prostitution on the advice of her father and lawyer, Albert Sinha. She made the shocking admission when the court asked her to prove that she had earned the money by fair means. She was allowed by the court to keep the money, but she is said to have lost the favour of her fans, resulting in the loss of many projects in the immediate aftermath. The bold admission is also said to have effectively ended her career that could carry on for many more years.

== Personal life ==
Sinha married Nepali actor Chidambar Prasad Lohani of Kumaoni Brahmin ethnicity in 1966. The couple met when they worked together in the Nepali film &quot;Maitighar&quot; (1966). Lohani had an estate agency business. After her marriage, she used to come and stay in Mumbai to shoot films while her husband stayed in Nepal running his business. She has one daughter from the marriage: Pratibha Sinha, who is a former Bollywood actress. From the late 1990s, the couple and their daughter have been residing in a bungalow in Bandra, Mumbai. Her mother lived in her house till her death in April 2017. Her daughter takes care of stray dogs and cats at Mala Sinha&#x27;s home.
Her husband, Lohani, died in June 2024. 

== Artistry and legacy ==
Dinesh Raheja of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; stated, &quot;What is remarkable about Mala Sinha is that most of her 1960s hits were fuelled by her own star power as much as the heros&#x27;. When she acted opposite big stars, she made sure her role was as good as theirs.&quot; In 2022, she was placed in &quot;Outlook India&quot;″s &quot;75 Best Bollywood Actresses&quot; list. Subhash K. Jha of &quot;Firstpost&quot; noted, &quot;Mala Sinha was always a daring diva. In &quot;Dhool Ka Phool&quot;, she was the first unwed mother of Hindi cinema. In &quot;Gumrah&quot;, she plays a wife who secretly carries on a relationship with the man she loved before marriage. Most of her roles were ahead of its time.&quot; One of the highest paid actress of the 1960s, Sinha appeared in &quot;Box Office India&quot;″s &quot;Top Actresses&quot; list five times, from 1962 to 1965 and 1968.

<text>A human rainbow is where a group of people form a pattern on the ground by placing themselves in the typical characteristics of a rainbow. For example, wearing the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet and forming a rainbow arch at the same time. Some human rainbows are formed in celebration of anniversaries and for charitable purposes. These human rainbows usually involve a large number of people participating and this has resulted in world records being broken. These records are officially recognised by the Guinness World Records.

== Records ==
* In 1997, 6,444 people formed a human rainbow at Transco Tower Park, Houston, Texas, United States.
* On October 6, 2002, 11,273 Hong Kong Polytechnic University staff, students, alumni, friends and families united together and set a new world record. All wearing T-shirts and caps in seven rainbow colours, they formed the largest Human Rainbow in the world. This historic event, held in celebration of Hong Kong Polytechnic University 65th anniversary, aimed to raise fund for the University, the Children&#x27;s Cancer Foundation and The Hong Kong Society for the Aged.
* On November 15, 2003, 11,750 individuals assembled in Floriana, Malta to break the record. The Prime Minister of Malta, Eddie Fenech Adami and members of the opposition also joined in. The money which was raised from the participants went to 23 different charity institutions.
* On September 18, 2004, over 31,000 students, faculty, staff and alumni of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines broke the record previously held by the Maltese. They used the human rainbow to celebrate the university&#x27;s centennial, which was from 1904 to 2004, and to highlight the signing of the Declaration of Peace which will be submitted to the United Nations.

<text>Gerhard Frey (; born 1 June 1944) is a German mathematician, known for his work in number theory. Following an original idea of Hellegouarch, he developed the notion of Frey–Hellegouarch curves, a construction of an elliptic curve from a purported solution to the Fermat equation, that is central to Wiles&#x27;s proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

==Education and career==
He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Tübingen, graduating in 1967. He continued his postgraduate studies at Heidelberg University, where he received his PhD in 1970, and his Habilitation in 1973. He was assistant professor at Heidelberg University from 1969–1973, professor at the University of Erlangen (1973–1975) and at Saarland University (1975–1990). Until 2009, he held a chair for number theory at the Institute for Experimental Mathematics at the University of Duisburg-Essen, campus Essen.

Frey was a visiting scientist at several universities and research institutions, including the Ohio State University, Harvard University, the University of California, Berkeley, the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), the Institute for Advanced Studies at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) in Rio de Janeiro.

Frey was also the co-editor of the journal &quot;&quot;.

==Research contributions==

His research areas are number theory and diophantine geometry, as well as applications to coding theory and cryptography. 
In 1985, Frey pointed out a connection between Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, and this connection was made precise shortly thereafter by Jean-Pierre Serre who formulated a conjecture formula_1 and showed that Taniyama-Shimura+formula_1 implies Fermat. Soon after, Kenneth Ribet proved enough of conjecture formula_1 to deduce that the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture implies Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. This approach provided a framework for the subsequent successful attack on Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in the 1990s.

In 1998, Frey proposed the idea of Weil descent attack for elliptic curves over finite fields with composite degree. As a result of this attack, cryptographers lost their interest in these curves.

==Awards and honors==
Frey was awarded the Gauss medal of the &quot;Braunschweigische Wissenschaftliche Gesellschaft&quot; in 1996 for his work on Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. Since 1998, he has been a member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences.

In 2006, he received the &quot;Certicom ECC Visionary Award&quot; for his contributions to elliptic-curve cryptography.

<text>Changtse (, ) is a mountain situated between the Main Rongbuk and East Rongbuk Glaciers in Tibet Autonomous Region, China, immediately north of Mount Everest. It is connected to Mount Everest via the North Col.

The given elevation of 7,543 metres is from modern Chinese mapping. Some authorities give 7,583 metres instead.

The Changtse Glacier flows north into the East Rongbuk Glacier. It is possible that the third highest lake in the world is in the Changtse Glacier at .

==Timeline==
*1924 George Mallory and Andrew Irvine first to set foot on Changtse. They climbed the east ridge of Changtse to reconnoiter camp sites on the East Rongbuk Glacier.
*1935 During the Mount Everest Reconnaissance a team with Eric Shipton, Edmund Wigram and Bill Tilman attempted the North Peak from their Camp IIA . On August 21 they got to within of the summit before very deep and soft snow forced them to turn back.
*1952 Reconnaissance of Changtse via Changtse Glacier by Edmund Hillary and George Lowe and a group of Sherpas. They reached an estimated elevation of before turning back after running low on supplies.
*1982 The first ascent of Changtse was unofficially made on October 3, 1982, by Johan Taks of the Dutch Everest Expedition who were officially climbing the north side of Everest. However, Taks climbed Changtse without a permit.
*1982 The first official ascent of Changtse with a permit was completed 11 days later on October 14 by five members of a German expedition Udo Zehetleitner, Paul Braun, Rudolf Frick, Ludwig Hösle and Martin Engler. The ascent was made via the four kilometre-long NE Ridge from the junction of the East Rongbuk Glacier and Changtse Glacier.
*1983 The next ascent and also the first solo was made by Chilean climber Gino Casassa May 14, 1983 by the same route used by the Germans.
*1986 Changtse was climbed again by a large Chinese-Japanese expedition in 1986. This expedition put eight Japanese and 16 Chinese on the summit May 10 and May 11, 1986, again via the NE Ridge from the Changtse Glacier. Also included the first ascent by a woman, Mrs. Gunsung.
*1986 American climber Ed Webster made the first solo ascent via the SE face from the foot of the North Col on August 28, 1986. Most of this climb was done at night, taking advantage of more stable snow and ice conditions.
*1987 Australian climbers Rob Turner and Glen Nash reached the summit September 29, 1987 via the north face icewall (Japanese 1986 route) despite high winds.

<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in Alberta since July 20, 2005 upon the granting of royal assent to the federal &quot;Civil Marriage Act.&quot; Alberta was one of the four Canadian provinces and territories where same-sex marriage had not been legalised before the enactment of the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;, along with Prince Edward Island, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.

==Adult interdependent relationship==
Since 2003, same-sex couples have had access to adult interdependent relationships, providing some of the rights and benefits of marriage. This includes alimony, health care benefits, inheritance, domestic violence protection, etc.

==Civil Marriage Act==
On June 28, 2005, the House of Commons of Canada passed the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;, an act which defines Canadian civil marriage as a union between &quot;two persons&quot;. The bill received royal assent by Deputy Governor General Beverley McLachlin a few weeks later and went into effect on July 20, 2005. Premier Ralph Klein responded by saying that the Alberta Government might opt to stop solemnizing marriages entirely, suggesting that in its place, the government would issue civil union licences to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples. Religious groups could still solemnize opposite-sex unions as marriages, but any civil ceremony would be permitted to recognize only a civil union. The Alberta Government also considered continuing to issue marriage licences to opposite-sex couples only in court, on the grounds that the federal government&#x27;s legislation encroached on the provincial government&#x27;s jurisdiction over the solemnization of marriage. In December 2004, Klein had suggested conducting a nationwide referendum on the legalisation of same-sex marriage, but this was opposed by Prime Minister Paul Martin, saying that &quot;this is an issue that Parliamentarians ought to decide&quot;. Klein stated, &quot;In this province, my feeling is the majority -- and I don&#x27;t know what the percentage of the majority is -- but the majority of people are opposed to same-sex marriage. And I represent the people of this province.&quot;

On July 12, 2005, Klein conceded that the advice given to him by legal experts was that a challenge in court to refuse to marry same-sex couples had no chance, and wasting taxpayers&#x27; money to fight it would be &quot;giving false hope&quot;. Klein said, &quot;much to our chagrin&quot;, the Alberta Government would issue marriage licences to same-sex couples when the bill received royal assent. Klein also said that the Alberta Government would enact provincial legislation to protect religious and civil officials who do not wish to perform a same-sex marriage. This would have meant that an Alberta marriage commissioner who refused to solemnize same-sex marriages would not be liable for dismissal on those grounds. However, no such legislation was passed, indicative of the &quot;sea change&quot; in attitudes towards same-sex marriage in Alberta. This mirrored similar developments in the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan where courts have twice struck down attempts to exempt marriage commissioners from performing same-sex weddings.

The first same-sex couple to receive a marriage licence in Alberta were Keenan Carley and Robert Bradford in Edmonton just hours after the Act received royal assent on July 20. The couple had to wait until provincial officials instructed all registry offices to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples, and until the licence forms were changed from stating &quot;Bride&quot; and &quot;Groom&quot; to &quot;Partner 1&quot; and &quot;Partner 2&quot;. The couple said, &quot;It&#x27;s wonderful feeling to know that it can finally be official. [...] It means that when we do have that ceremony, it will be legal, that we will be recognized as a married couple by the province of Alberta and the government of Canada. And that&#x27;s a great thing.&quot;

==Provincial legislation==
===Marriage Act===
The position of Premier Ralph Klein and the Progressive Conservative government had been to attempt to block same-sex marriages in Alberta should a court case require it or federal legislation pass it nationwide. On March 16, 2000, the Legislative Assembly of Alberta passed &quot;Bill 202&quot; which amended the provincial &quot;Marriage Act&quot; to include a heterosexual-only definition of marriage. The bill also invoked the Notwithstanding Clause of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. This insulated the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; from any legal challenge based on violation of &quot;Charter&quot; rights, including the Section 15 equality guarantees. Under the terms of the Notwithstanding Clause, such a declaration is effective for only five years after it comes into force. For the &quot;Marriage Act&quot;, this period expired on March 23, 2005. Premier Klein sent mixed messages about whether it would be renewed; ultimately, it was not. The Minister of Government Services, Ty Lund, tabled a report at the conservative caucus on April 4, 2005, stating that the federal government, not the provinces, has the exclusive jurisdiction to define marriage. The report further stated that if Alberta renewed the declaration in the Act by using the Notwithstanding Clause, the &quot;government would be needlessly wasting time and money&quot;.

While the act could not have been challenged under the &quot;Charter&quot;, the definition of marriage is outside the power of the provincial government, or &quot;ultra vires&quot;, and therefore invalid. The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; is universally interpreted as giving provinces jurisdiction over only the solemnization of marriage, while all other aspects, including capacity to marry, are under federal jurisdiction. At the time &quot;Bill 202&quot; was passed, Justice Minister Dave Hancock did not support it, saying: &quot;In terms of legal effect, I&#x27;m convinced it doesn&#x27;t have any.&quot; Hancock subsequently stated that he believed the act to be constitutionally valid and that Alberta would attempt to uphold it. Following the December 9, 2004 Supreme Court response to the federal reference of same-sex marriage, Hancock&#x27;s successor, Ron Stevens, conceded that the Bill 202 amendments to the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; would likely be struck down as unconstitutional on account of its encroachment into what had by then been explicitly ruled a matter of federal jurisdiction. In December 2004, Canadians for Equal Marriage said they were considering filing a court challenge to legalise same-sex marriage in Alberta, similar to what had happened in other provinces and territories, &quot;The essence of the challenge is going to be discrimination based on sexual orientation. They suggest marriage continues to be between a man and a woman, when the Supreme Court and other jurisdictions have stated very clearly otherwise.&quot; Michael Phair, a member of the Edmonton City Council, said, &quot;We are tired of being bullied. It is an outrage, and it is nothing but bias and revenge to force us to go to the courts to get what everyone else has in this country.&quot;

In May 2014, the Legislative Assembly amended the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; to remove the Bill 202 amendments added in 2000, to replace references to &quot;husband and wife&quot; with the gender-neutral term &quot;spouses&quot;, and to add &quot;or spouse&quot; in section 8(2), nine years after same-sex marriage became legal in Alberta. Several other acts were amended in a similar way. The legislation received royal assent by Lieutenant Governor Donald Ethell on 14 May. Section 8 of the Act states that each of the parties shall, in the presence of the marriage commissioner and the witnesses, declare:
===Adoption Act===
Same-sex couples have been allowed to adopt their stepchildren since 1999. In February 2007, same-sex couples won the right to adopt children jointly.

==Two-spirit marriages==
While there are no records of same-sex marriages as understood from a Western perspective being performed in First Nations cultures, there is evidence for identities and behaviours that may be placed on the LGBT spectrum. Many of these cultures recognised two-spirit individuals who were born male but wore women&#x27;s clothing and performed everyday household work and artistic handiwork which were regarded as belonging to the feminine sphere. This two-spirit status allowed for marriages between two biological males or two biological females to be performed in some of these tribes.

Among the Plains Cree people, two-spirit individuals were regarded as &quot;esteemed persons with special spiritual powers&quot; and were &quot;noted shamans&quot;. They are known in their language as (ᐃᔩᐦᑫᐧᐤ, ). It was likely that they were able to marry cisgender men, though David G. Mandelbaum reported in 1940 that an &quot;iyîhkwêw&quot; named Clawed Woman had remained unmarried her entire life. The Nakoda people refer to two-spirit individuals as (), or also as (). They carried out women&#x27;s work in the community and married men. In the Blackfoot language, two-spirit people are known as (ᖳᖶᖷᖽ, ).

==Marriage statistics==
2,485 same-sex couples married in Alberta from 2005 to 2014. The 2016 Canadian census showed that there were 6,110 same-sex couples living in Alberta.

==Religious performance==
In July 2019, the synod of the Anglican Church of Canada passed a resolution known as &quot;A Word to the Church&quot;, allowing its dioceses to choose whether to bless and perform same-sex marriages. A few days after the vote, Bishop Jane Alexander of the Diocese of Edmonton issued a pastoral letter authorising clergy in the diocese to officiate at same-sex marriages. The measure includes a freedom of conscience clause for clergy opposed to performing the marriages. The Diocese of Calgary does not perform same-sex marriages. In October 2017, the diocesan synod voted by a 57.4% majority to request Bishop Greg Kerr-Wilson to permit parishes to bless civil same-sex marriages, but the diocese still does not bless or perform same-sex marriages as of 2024. The Diocese of Athabasca, encompassing northern Alberta, likewise does not perform same-sex marriages.

Some other religious organisations also perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, including the United Church of Canada, Quakers, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Canadian Unitarian Council.

==Public opinion==
An EKOS/CBC poll in 2002 indicated that attitudes towards same-sex marriage were more supportive in Alberta than they were in the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, both of which had recognized same-sex marriage earlier. A June 2003 survey by Ipsos-Reid, conducted a few weeks after same-sex marriage was legalized in Ontario, showed that 57% of Albertans opposed same-sex marriage, while 41% supported it. Opposition was higher among older people (77%) than middle-aged people (60%) and younger people (41%), higher among men (63%) than women (51%), and higher among people living in rural areas (65%) than people living in urban areas (45%). An Ipsos-Reid poll conducted in August 2005 showed that 56% of Albertans remained opposed to same-sex marriage.

An October 2011 poll conducted by the Citizen Society Research Lab at Lethbridge College found that 72.1% of Albertans supported same-sex marriage, while 27.9% were opposed, a big change in comparison to 2005 when a majority of residents opposed it.

<text>Paul Jones Semmes (June 4, 1815 – July 10, 1863) was a banker, businessman, and a Confederate brigadier general during the American Civil War. He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg.

==Early life==
Semmes was born at Montford&#x27;s Plantation in Wilkes County, Georgia. He was a cousin of future Confederate naval hero, &quot;CSS Alabama&quot; Captain Raphael Semmes. His half-brother, Albert Gallatin Semmes, later became an associate justice of the Florida Supreme Court. Paul Semmes was educated at the Beman School in Hancock County. He attended the University of Virginia and became a banker and planter in Wilkes County, Georgia. He was elected commander of the Georgia Militia 1st Brigade of the 4th Division in 1837 and held that commission until 1840 when he moved to Columbus, Georgia. His business endeavors flourished and he became one of Columbus&#x27;s most prominent citizens. From 1846 to 1861, he served as a captain in the Georgia militia. He was the author of the 1855 manual, &quot;Infantry Tactics&quot;. In 1860, Governor Joseph E. Brown appointed Semmes as quartermaster general for the state and authorized him to handle all military purchases. In August 1860 Semmes was appointed Brigadier General of the Knights of the Golden Circle.

==Civil War==
After the start of the Civil War, Semmes was appointed colonel of the 2nd Georgia Infantry. He was promoted to brigadier general on March 11, 1862. During the Peninsula Campaign, he was a brigade commander in Brig. Gen. John B. Magruder&#x27;s Corps in the defense of Richmond. Rushed northward at the start of the Maryland Campaign, Semmes&#x27;s brigade rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia in the division of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws just as it was entering Maryland. His men participated in the holding action at Crampton&#x27;s Gap during the Battle of South Mountain. At Sharpsburg, Semmes&#x27;s brigade was a key part of General McLaws&#x27;s strong counterattack that stunned the Union II Corps. In early November, his brigade was reorganized so that it only contained Georgia regiments. Held in reserve at the Battle of Fredericksburg, Semmes&#x27;s reconstituted brigade served well at Chancellorsville, where it blunted the advance of an entire VI Corps division, and at Salem Church.

==Death and legacy==
Semmes was mortally wounded in the thigh while leading a charge across the Wheatfield at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863. He died eight days later in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and was buried in Linwood Cemetery (Columbus, Georgia). Shortly before his death, Semmes told a war correspondent, &quot;I consider it a privilege to die for my country.&quot; The last letter that he wrote to his wife may be seen in the online collection of the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History.

General Robert E. Lee lamented Semmes&#x27;s untimely loss, writing that he &quot;died as he had lived, discharging the highest duty of a patriot with devotion that never faltered and courage that shrank from no danger.&quot;

<doc id="1021323" wikidata="Q1866963" url="?curid=1021323" title="Lloyd's List">
<text>Lloyd&#x27;s List is one of the world&#x27;s oldest continuously running journals, having provided weekly shipping news in London as early as 1734. It was published daily until 2013 (when the final print issue, number 60,850, was published), and is now published digitally.

Also known simply as &quot;The List&quot;, it was begun by Edward Lloyd, the proprietor of Lloyd&#x27;s Coffee House, as a source of information for merchants&#x27; agents and insurance underwriters who met regularly in his establishment on Lombard Street to negotiate insurance coverage for trading vessels. It continues to provide this information in addition to marine insurance, offshore energy, logistics, market data, research, global trade and law information, and shipping news.

==History==
The earliest form of &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; was estimated by some to have begun by 1692. One historian, Michael Palmer, wrote that: &quot;No later than January 1692, Lloyd began publishing a weekly newsletter, ‘Ships Arrived at and Departed from several Ports of England, as I have Account of them in London... [and] An Account of what English Shipping and Foreign Ships for England, I hear of in Foreign Ports’&quot;. Around that time, &quot;Lloyd’s News&quot; was published three times a week with no particular emphasis on shipping from 1696 to 1697. However, claims that &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; is the oldest continuously published newspaper in the world are disputed. The World Association of Newspapers lists several earlier, extant titles.

Thomas Jemson inherited Lloyd&#x27;s Coffee House in 1727 and founded the &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; that is known today when he launched a weekly shipping intelligence publication. Publication was weekly until March 1735, then twice weekly, on Tuesdays and Fridays, according to Palmer.
In 1769, the coffee house moved to Pope&#x27;s Head Alley and from there, the New &quot;Lloyd’s List&quot; began, according to Lloyd&#x27;s Register. The paper was published every day except Sundays from 1 July 1837. In July 1884, &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; merged with the &quot;Shipping and Mercantile Gazette&quot;.

&quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; has spawned several spin-off titles, including sister title &quot;Insurance Day&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; went through a major re-design that encompassed both the masthead and the newspaper itself. Between 2011 and 2017, a &quot;Lloyd’s List&quot; operated a mobile app. Beginning in 2013, &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; was published in digital format only, as it was found that fewer than 2% of customers used the print version.

In 2022, Informa sold &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; to Montagu Private Equity. The business was then reorganised as Maritime Insights &amp; Intelligence Limited.

<text>Jörg Schlaich (17 October 1934 – 4 September 2021) was a German structural engineer and is known internationally for his ground-breaking work in the creative design of bridges, long-span roofs, and other complex structures. He was a co-founder of the structural engineering and consulting firm Schlaich Bergermann Partner.

He was the brother of the architect Brigitte Schlaich Peterhans.

==Early career==
Jörg Schlaich studied architecture and civil engineering from 1953 to 1955 at Stuttgart University before completing his studies at Technische Universität Berlin in 1959. He spent 1959 and 1960 at the Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, United States.

In 1963, he joined the firm Leonhardt &amp; Andrä, the firm founded by Fritz Leonhardt.

==Later career==
Schlaich was made a partner and was responsible for the Alster-Schwimmhalle in Hamburg, and more importantly, the Olympic Stadium in Munich. He stayed with the firm until 1969.

In 1974 he became an academic at Stuttgart University, and in 1980 he founded his own firm, Schlaich Bergermann Partner.

In 1993, with the roof of the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion (since 2023 MHPArena) in Stuttgart, he introduced the &quot;speichenrad&quot; principle to structural engineering. Indeed, this principle was employed for the first time in the history of Structural Engineering by the Italian engineer Massimo Majowiecki, the designer of the roof of the Olympic Stadium, Rome (built in 1990, three years before the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion). Since then, his company has successfully employed it in stadium projects across the globe. Other structures include the observation tower at the Killesbergpark in Stuttgart. Most of his work as well of that of his company is documented on their website. He was also the developer of the solar tower (or solar chimney) and is largely credited with inventing the strut and tie model for reinforced concrete.

<doc id="1021335" wikidata="Q1726914" url="?curid=1021335" title="Ted Forrest">
<text>Ted Forrest (born September 24, 1964) is an American professional poker player, currently residing in Las Vegas, Nevada.

== Tournament wins ==
In 1992, Forrest won two tournaments at the LA Poker Classic and one at the World Poker Finals in Mashantucket. Forrest won three bracelets at the 1993 World Series of Poker (WSOP). After the mid-1990s, Forrest turned his attention full-time to cash games. He made a triumphant return to the WSOP by winning two bracelets at the 2004 World Series of Poker. Since then he has moved his focus from seven card stud to hold &#x27;em with some success, including reaching five final tables on the World Poker Tour and winning a championship on the Professional Poker Tour.

Forrest competed in the second season of Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament, where he advanced to the quarter-final stage. He did not fare as well in season three, being mathematically eliminated early in the preliminaries. He played in the first two seasons of the GSN series &quot;High Stakes Poker&quot;.

In March 2006, Forrest won the annual National Heads-Up Poker Championship, defeating (in order) Erik Seidel, Chad Brown, Ernie Dureck, Sam Farha, Shahram Sheikhan and Chris Ferguson to win the $500,000 first prize.

Continuing with his history of tournament success, in March 2007 Ted won the Bay 101 Shooting Stars Tournament, outlasting J. J. Liu in the longest heads up duel in World Poker Tour history. For the victory, Forrest collected the first prize of $1,100,000.

In June 2014 Ted defeated notable poker player Phil Hellmuth in the final table of the WSOP Razz event, bringing his total number of WSOP bracelets to six.

As of August 7, 2015, his total live tournament winnings exceed $6,200,000. His 31 cashes as the WSOP account for $1,922,990 of those winnings.

== Strategy differentiation ==
Forrest&#x27;s no-limit Texas hold &#x27;em strategy vastly differs from that of many other established pros who believe that pre-flop one should always raise or fold, Forrest has repeatedly stated and demonstrated in his play, that limping, or simply calling a raise, is not a bad play and should be frequently employed.

== Andy Beal Showdown ==
Forrest is well known as a competitive high-stakes gambler. He has been a key part of a consortium of poker players who pooled their money together to play Texas billionaire Andy Beal in a series of very high limit, heads-up, Texas hold &#x27;em games, with limits ranging anywhere from $20,000/$40,000 to $100,000/$200,000.

== World Series of Poker bracelets ==
Forrest&#x27;s first three bracelets were stolen. He gave one of the remaining two to his daughter; and has the other locked away. Ted also owns one WSOP championship bracelet that formerly belonged to Hamid Dastmalchi, which he purchased from Dastmalchi after the 1992 World Series of Poker world champion complained that the bracelet wasn&#x27;t worth what the Binion family claimed. Hamid told him, “They say it’s worth $5,000, but I’d take $1,500 for it” to which Forrest replied &quot;Sold&quot; and tossed him three $500 chips.

== Bad check charges ==
In September 2016, Forrest was charged in the Las Vegas Justice Court with two felonies: drawing and passing a check without sufficient funds with the intent to defraud, and theft.

<doc id="1021336" wikidata="Q6687325" url="?curid=1021336" title="Louis Schwitzer">
<text>Louis Henry Schwitzer (February 29, 1880 – May 9, 1967) was an American engineer and early racing driver who was the winner of the first auto race ever held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He later had a distinguished career as an engineer.

== Early life ==

Schwitzer obtained degrees in electrical and mechanical engineering from the Technical University of Darmstadt and the University of Karlsruhe.

== Engineering career ==

After arriving from Austria-Hungary, Schwitzer found work with Holzer-Cabot in Boston, Massachusetts. Schwitzer was influential in designing hydraulics for use in bus transportation. He also pioneered improvements in automotive cooling fans, water pumps and oil pumps, and the turbocharger. Schwitzer made a fortune in business and became a philanthropist. The Student Center at the University of Indianapolis bears his name, as did a women&#x27;s dormitory at nearby Butler University.

== Racing career ==

Schwitzer also competed in a few early automobile races. As a driver, Schwitzer won the first event held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a five-mile race on August 19, 1909. He is known to have started five races at IMS during 1909 and 1910. He also drove relief, for Harry Cobe, in the first Indianapolis 500. Schwitzer served on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Technical Committee from 1912 through 1945.

== Legacy ==

In recognition of Schwitzer&#x27;s contributions to the early developmental history of American motorsports, the Louis Schwitzer Award for design innovation is presented annually after each running of the Indianapolis 500.

In 1970, Schwitzer was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame.

Schwitzer is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.

<text>The Women Airforce Service Pilots Badge is an award of the United States Army that was issued during the Second World War. The badge created for the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASP (not WASPs, because the acronym already includes the plural &quot;Pilots&quot;), was awarded to more than a thousand women who had qualified for employment as civilian, non-combat pilots of military aircraft used by the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. The first wings were privately and hastily designed and paid for out of the pockets of Floyd Odlum and his wife, Jacqueline Cochran, who in 1942 became the head of WASP.
The first seven classes of WASP flight school graduates in 1943 were issued silver wings with a central shield-shaped escutcheon, with the class number engraved on it. On the scroll above the shield, where the &quot;999th&quot; appears, was the squadron number of the Training Command. The first two classes were marked with the 319th, and thereafter the 318th for the remaining five classes in 1943.
Classes graduating in 1944 and thereafter were issued the newly designed official Army Air Forces WASP wings with a diamond-shaped lozenge in the center. Unlike the earlier WASP wing design, with its central shield-shaped escutcheon, the new silver badge conformed to heraldic tradition by incorporating a lozenge centered between two wings. In heraldic usage, a lozenge is the traditional shape of a woman&#x27;s coat of arms. It is said to have been selected for its resemblance to the shape of the shield carried by Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, weaving, crafts, and war. This design was used until the deactivation of WASP in December 1944. There were no more WASP wings authorized after that.

Following the 1947 creation of the United States Air Force, the next appearance of women Air Force pilots was in the 1970s, at which time all Air Force pilots were authorized to wear the same wing badge.

<text>Charles Eliot (November 1, 1859 – March 25, 1897) was an American landscape architect. Known for pioneering principles of regional planning, naturalistic systems approach to landscape architecture, and laying the groundwork for conservancies across the world. Instrumental in the formation of The Trustees of Reservations, the world&#x27;s first land trust, playing a central role in shaping the Boston Metropolitan Park System, designing a number of public and private landscapes, and wrote prolifically on a variety of topics.

==Biography==
Eliot was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1859 to Charles W. Eliot and Ellen Derby Peabody. Charles had one brother, Samuel A. Eliot, who was a minister. His father became President of Harvard University in 1869, the same year his mother died. He was part of the prominent Eliot family originating from Boston.

In 1878 he was admitted to Harvard College.

In 1880 Charles organized a group of college classmates who would sail to Mount Desert Island, Maine, to spend the summer. The group was named the Champlain Society, Charles Eliot being the Director. While there, studying botany, geology, meteorology, marine life, ornithology, and entomology, Charles would write his parents later that fall recommending to look between Somes Sound and Seal Harbor if they wanted to build a house on Mount Desert Island: &quot;Somewhere along that coast you will find a suitable spot, with beautiful views of the ocean, and hills, deep water anchorage, fine rocks and beach, and no flats.&quot; A year later his father would purchase 120 acres and build what is considered to be the first summer cottage in Northeast Harbor.

On graduation from Harvard in 1882, Eliot pursued horticultural courses at the Bussey Institute at Harvard to prepare himself for the profession of landscape architecture.

In 1883 Eliot became an apprentice for Frederick Law Olmsted and Company, the architect of Central Park. He worked on designs for Cushing Island, Maine (1883), Franklin Park (1884), the Arnold Arboretum (1885), and the Fens (1883) in Boston, and Belle Isle Park (1884) in Detroit. In 1885, on Olmsted&#x27;s advice, Eliot traveled to Europe to observe natural scenery as well as the landscape designs of Capability Brown, Humphry Repton, Joseph Paxton, and Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau. Eliot&#x27;s travel diaries provide one of the best visual assessments of European landscapes in the late 19th century.

Returning to Boston in 1886, Eliot opened his own office. His commissions included the First Parish Church in Weston, Massachusetts (1888) White Park (1888) in Concord, New Hampshire, Youngstown Gorge (1891), now called Mill Creek Park, in Youngstown, Ohio, and Salt Lake City&#x27;s plan for a new town (1890).

In 1888 Charles married Mary Yale Pitkin from Philadelphia; this marriage produced four daughters: Ruth, Grace, Ellen, and Carola. She was a member of the Yale family of Yale University. 
Mary&#x27;s father was Horace Wells Pitkin, a successful businessman in Tennessee, Louisville and Philadelphia; his sister Emily would marry the artist Seth Cheney; and her mother was Lucy Tracy Yale, Lucy&#x27;s sister would marry a Mr. Beadle. Mary Yale Pitkins&#x27; brother was Yale missionary Horace Tracy Pitkin; her grandnephew was NY Senator Mortimer Yale Ferris. Her grandfather was Reverend Cyrus Yale who graduated from Williams College in 1811 and was a minister for 40 years at the Town Hill Church in New Hartford Connecticut. The Yale, Pitkin, and Beadle Families would spend their summers at their farm called &quot;Eaglesnest&quot; on Town Hill Road in New Hartford Connecticut.

On March 5, 1890, Eliot published an article entitled &quot;Waverly Oaks&quot; to defend a stand of virgin trees in Belmont, Massachusetts, in the process making a plea for preservation of the oaks and outlining a strategy for conserving other areas of scenic beauty in the same way that the Boston Public Library held books and the Museum of Fine Arts pictures. This article resulted in a conference held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1890 on preservation of scenic beauty, and led to the enactment of Massachusetts legislation creating The Trustees of Reservations in 1891 — the world&#x27;s first organization created to &quot;acquire, hold, protect and administer, for the benefit of the public, beautiful and historical places.&quot; Within four years, Britain&#x27;s National Trust was created along these lines.


After the death of their partner Henry Sargent Codman, Olmsted&#x27;s son Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and stepson John Charles Olmsted asked Eliot to become a full partner in their firm. In March 1893, the firm&#x27;s name was changed to Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot. Within a few months, Eliot assumed the leadership role as the elder Olmsted&#x27;s health continued to fail. Private commissions included the Cairnwood Estate, Biltmore Estate of the Vanderbilts, and Lady Meredith House in the Golden Square Mile, Montreal.

In 1895, the Massachusetts legislature ordered the taking of nearly three miles of private seacoast land on what is now Revere Beach Reservation. The Metropolitan Park Commission was entrusted with the land in 1896. Eliot was chosen by the Park Commission to design Revere Beach Reservation for the best use by the public. Eliot stated in November 1896, &quot;We must not conceal from visitors the long sweep of the open beach which is the finest thing about the reservation.&quot; Revere Beach would become &quot;the first to be set aside and governed by a public body for the enjoyment of the common people.&quot;

Over the next year, some 300 structures were cleared from on and around the beach, the train tracks were moved approximately 400 yards away from the water, a boulevard was put in place to separate buildings and houses from the sand, and a bandstand and pavilions were constructed. An estimated 45,000 people showed up on opening day to enjoy the first public beach in the United States. Fittingly, the small rotary at the start of the beach&#x27;s southern end is named &quot;Eliot Circle.&quot;

Eliot died March 25, 1897, at age 37 from spinal meningitis.

==Legacy==
Eliot&#x27;s work has left a lasting mark on greater Boston. He published conceptual plans for the esplanades along the Charles River in Boston proposed earlier by Charles Davenport and others, and as the consulting landscape architect for the Metropolitan Park Commission, he supervised the acquisition of much of the riverfront in Boston, Watertown, and Newton. He also directed the landscape work on the Cambridge esplanade for the city&#x27;s park commission. The esplanade in Boston was later realized following designs by Guy Lowell (1910) and Arthur Shurcliff (1936). In 1883, he designed Longfellow Park between the Cambridge home of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and the Charles River. Up until his death he was the partner in charge of the firm&#x27;s work at Fresh Pond in Cambridge.

In addition to his practice, Eliot became a regular contributor of professional articles to &quot;Garden and Forest&quot; Magazine.

After Eliot&#x27;s death, Olmsted&#x27;s son and stepson reconstituted their partnership as the Olmsted Brothers, which continued for a half-century as one of the best-known landscape design firms in the United States, and went on to design thousands of parks, gardens, and landscapes in the 20th century.

Eliot&#x27;s writings have been characterized as the inspiration behind the establishment of Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island in Maine.

<doc id="1021355" wikidata="Q1633866" url="?curid=1021355" title="Hyperalgesia">
<text>Hyperalgesia ( or ; &quot;hyper&quot; from Greek ὑπέρ (&quot;huper&quot;) &#x27;over&#x27; + &quot;-algesia&quot; from Greek ἄλγος (algos) &#x27;pain&#x27;) is an abnormally increased sensitivity to pain, which may be caused by damage to nociceptors or peripheral nerves and can cause hypersensitivity to stimulus.
Prostaglandins E and F are largely responsible for sensitizing the nociceptors. Temporary increased sensitivity to pain also occurs as part of sickness behavior, the evolved response to infection.

==Types==
Hyperalgesia can be experienced in focal, discrete areas, or as a more diffuse, body-wide form. Conditioning studies have established that it is possible to experience a learned hyperalgesia of the latter, diffuse form.

The focal form is typically associated with injury, and is divided into two subtypes:
* &quot;Primary hyperalgesia&quot; describes pain sensitivity that occurs directly in the damaged tissues.
* &quot;Secondary hyperalgesia&quot; describes pain sensitivity that occurs in surrounding undamaged tissues.

Opioid-induced hyperalgesia may develop as a result of long-term opioid use in the treatment of chronic pain. Various studies of humans and animals have demonstrated that primary or secondary hyperalgesia can develop in response to both chronic and acute exposure to opioids. This side effect can be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of opioid treatment.

==Causes==
Hyperalgesia is induced by platelet-activating factor (PAF) which comes about in an inflammatory or an allergic response. This seems to occur via immune cells interacting with the peripheral nervous system and releasing pain-producing chemicals (cytokines and chemokines).

One unusual cause of focal hyperalgesia is platypus venom.

Long-term opioid (e.g. heroin, morphine) users and those on high-dose opioid medications for the treatment of chronic pain may experience hyperalgesia and experience pain out of proportion to physical findings; this is a common cause for loss of efficacy of these medications over time. As it can be difficult to distinguish from tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia is often compensated for by escalating the dose of opioid, potentially worsening the problem by further increasing sensitivity to pain. Chronic hyperstimulation of opioid receptors results in altered homeostasis of pain signalling pathways in the body with several mechanisms of action involved. One major pathway being through stimulation of the nociceptin receptor, and blocking this receptor may therefore be a means of preventing the development of hyperalgesia.

Stimulation of nociceptive fibers in a pattern consistent with that from inflammation switches on a form of amplification in the spinal cord, long term potentiation. This occurs where the pain fibres synapse to pain pathway, the periaqueductal grey. Amplification in the spinal cord may be another way of producing hyperalgesia.

The release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 by activated leukocytes triggered by lipopolysaccharides, endotoxins and other signals of infection also increases pain sensitivity as part of sickness behavior, the evolved response to illness.

==Medical associations==
Hyperalgesia is associated with fibromyalgia syndrome.

==Diagnosis==
Simple bedside tests include response (pain intensity and character) to cotton swab, finger pressure, pinprick, cold and warm stimuli, e.g., metal thermo rollers at 20°C and 40°C, as well as mapping of the area of abnormality.

Quantitative sensory testing can be used to determine pain thresholds (decreased pain threshold indicates allodynia) and stimulus/response functions (increased pain response indicate hyperalgesia). Dynamic mechanical allodynia can be assessed using a cotton swab or a brush. A pressure algometer and standardized monofilaments or weighted pinprick stimuli are used for assessing pressure and punctate allodynia and hyperalgesia and a thermal tester is used for thermal testing.

==Treatment==
Hyperalgesia is similar to other sorts of pain associated with nerve irritation or damage such as allodynia and neuropathic pain, and consequently may respond to standard treatment for these conditions, using various drugs such as SSRI or tricyclic antidepressants, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, gabapentin or pregabalin, NMDA antagonists, or atypical opioids such as tramadol. Where hyperalgesia has been produced by chronic high doses of opioids, reducing the dose may result in improved pain management. However, as with other forms of nerve dysfunction associated pain, treatment of hyperalgesia can be clinically challenging, and finding a suitable drug or drug combination that is effective for a particular patient may require trial and error. The use of a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device has been shown to alleviate hyperalgesia.

<doc id="1021358" wikidata="Q303090" url="?curid=1021358" title="Chris Armas">
<text>Christopher Armas (born August 27, 1972) is an American professional soccer coach and former player who is the head coach of Major League Soccer club Colorado Rapids.

==Youth and college==
Born in The Bronx, New York City, Armas is of Puerto Rican descent and grew up in Brentwood, New York. He graduated from St. Anthony&#x27;s High School and then attended Adelphi University from 1990 to 1993, amassing 17 goals and 15 assists over his collegiate career. Armas was named an NCAA Division II First Team All-American his senior year.

==Playing career==
===Professional===
After graduating from college, Armas spent 1994 and 1995 playing for the USISL&#x27;s Long Island Rough Riders, being selected as a USISL All-Star. In 1995, the Rough Riders defeated the Minnesota Thunder in the USISL&#x27;s Pro League Championship.

In 1996, Armas was drafted by Los Angeles Galaxy in the first round of the Major League Soccer Supplemental Draft and played a significant role in their first and second seasons. Chicago Fire acquired Armas in a trade for their inaugural 1998 campaign. It was with the 1998 Fire team that Armas emerged as an exceptional player, helping them win their first MLS Championship that year. Between 1998 and 2001, Armas was named to the MLS Best XI four consecutive times, his streak only being broken by an ACL injury that kept him out of much of the 2002 campaign; Armas was named to his fifth Best XI after the 2003 MLS season, in addition to being named the MLS Comeback Player of the Year. He was named U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year in 2000. In ten years in MLS, he totaled eleven goals and 41 assists, plus added four goals and four assists in the playoffs.

On April 19, 2007, Armas announced that the 2007 MLS season with the Chicago Fire would be his last, as he decided to retire. His retirement was made official on November 13, 2007, after spending 12 years in MLS.

===International===
Armas played for Puerto Rico in the 1993 Caribbean Cup. The competition was not then recognized by FIFA and so his five matches were classed as friendlies.

He was therefore later allowed to switch his allegiance to the United States, for whom he made his debut November 6, 1998, against Australia. He went on to earn 66 caps. He did not break into the squad until soon after the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and his ACL injury came just before the 2002 FIFA World Cup, so he was never able to play for the United States in the World Cup. He was named as a standby player for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and did not feature in the final squad.

==Coaching career==
After his retirement, he coached youth soccer and was a high school physical education teacher at St. Anthony&#x27;s High School.

Armas served as an assistant coach for the Chicago Fire in 2008 and was the head women&#x27;s soccer coach at Adelphi University between 2011 and 2015.

On July 6, 2018, Armas was promoted to head coach of New York Red Bulls after former manager Jesse Marsch departed the club to join Red Bull Salzburg as an assistant. Armas helped the Red Bulls finish first in the regular season, winning the Supporters&#x27; Shield as a result. The Red Bulls were eliminated in the conference finals by Atlanta United.

In 2019, the Red Bulls finished sixth in the Eastern Conference and were eliminated by the Philadelphia Union in the first round of the playoffs. The Red Bulls were then eliminated in the group stage of the MLS is Back Tournament after they were defeated by FC Cincinnati. The team was in the middle of a scoring slump when Armas parted ways with the club on September 4, 2020, the day after a 1–0 loss to D.C. United.

In 2021, Armas was hired as head coach of Toronto FC, replacing Greg Vanney, who departed the club at the end of his contract. On July 4, 2021, following a 7–1 loss to D.C. United, the largest loss in the club&#x27;s history and a league record of one win, eight losses and two draws, the team announced he had been fired.

On December 7, 2021, Armas was hired by Manchester United as assistant coach to work under interim manager Ralf Rangnick. He left the club in May 2022.

In January 2023, it was confirmed that Armas had re-united with Jesse Marsch at Leeds United. Armas was named co-interim head coach alongside Michael Skubala and Paco Gallardo following the sacking of Jesse Marsch in February, the trio overseeing a 2–2 draw at Old Trafford with Manchester United on 8
February 2023 and Skubala acting as solitary interim manager in the home loss against the same opponents four days later.

===Colorado Rapids===
On November 17, 2023, Armas returned to Major League Soccer, signing as head coach of the Colorado Rapids.

==Personal life==
Armas and his wife, Justine, have two sons, Christopher and Aleksei.

<doc id="1021361" wikidata="Q7947112" url="?curid=1021361" title="WBFO">
<text>WBFO (88.7 FM) is a non-commercial, listener-supported, public radio station in Buffalo, New York. It is owned by the Western New York Public Broadcasting Association, doing business as Buffalo Toronto Public Media. Along with sister stations 94.5 WNED-FM and channel 17 WNED-TV, it broadcasts from studios in the Lower Terrace section of downtown Buffalo.

WBFO is a Class B station. It has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 50,000 watts. The transmitter is off Millersport Highway (New York State Route 263) in Getzville. Programming is also heard on two satellite stations: WUBJ (88.1 FM) in Jamestown, and WOLN (91.3 FM) in Olean. WBFO broadcasts using HD Radio technology. It plays adult album alternative on its HD2 subchannel and Spanish-language public radio on its HD3 subchannel.

==Programming==
WBFO is a member station of National Public Radio (NPR). The station airs a news, talk and information format with music programs in the evening. Weekdays begin with NPR&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot;. Also heard on weekdays are &quot;All Things Considered, Here and Now, Capitol Pressroom, Fresh Air&quot; and &quot;Marketplace&quot;. The WBFO staff provides local news updates during the day. Monday through Thursday from 10 to 11 a.m., &quot;What&#x27;s Next?&quot; is heard, a Buffalo-centered interview and call-in show produced by WBFO. In the evening, WBFO presents &quot;The Bridge&quot;, an adult album alternative music service that also airs fulltime on WBFO-HD2.

Weekends feature one-hour public radio shows on a variety of topics: &quot;The Splendid Table, On The Media, The TED Radio Hour, Planet Money, Radiolab, A Way with Words, Science Friday, Travel with Rick Steves, Freakonomics Radio&quot; and &quot;Wait, Wait, Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;. Overnight, the BBC World Service is heard.

==History==
===Jazz and Blues===
WBFO signed on the air on . It was owned and operated by the State University of New York at Buffalo (UB). At first, the station was only powered at 190 watts. For many years, the university operated it as a jazz station most of the day, with a news bureau. WBFO reporter Ira Flatow, a UB graduate, left the station to become part of the inaugural staff of NPR upon its launch in 1971; WBFO carried NPR&#x27;s initial program &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and later added &quot;Morning Edition&quot; in 1979. The rest of the schedule featured local jazz shows in middays, evenings and late nights plus blues music and specialty programming on weekends.

UB was one of two public broadcasting organizations active in Western New York at the time, the other being the Western New York Public Broadcasting Association, whose AM, FM and TV stations all carried the call sign WNED. WNED&#x27;s AM station, AM 970, had a news and information format that also carried &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, along with other public radio shows shared with WBFO. By 2010, UB had eliminated the daytime and much of the evening music programming on 88.7 FM for news shows. At the same time, it discussed a merger with WNED.

===Switch to News and Information===
WNED purchased WBFO in July 2011. The new owner incorporated some of the channel&#x27;s news features and staff into a combined lineup which debuted on March 1, 2012. Once listeners began tuning in WBFO for news and information, Western New York Public Broadcasting could sell 970 AM. On November 30, 2012, 970 WNED was sold to Christian radio owner Crawford Broadcasting. The call letters on 970 changed to WDCZ.

All of the network music programming WBFO had carried on weekends was dropped. WBFO became exclusively a news and information station.). Among the programs eliminated from the old WBFO were the last jazz programs originating from a Buffalo area radio station at that time. Jazz eventually returned as part of the broad-based adult standards format on the revived WEBR in 2020.

===Buffalo Toronto Public Media===
WBFO, along with WNED-FM-TV, began collectively referring to themselves as &quot;Buffalo Toronto Public Media&quot; on February 4, 2020. The rebranding was in part to better identify WBFO and the WNED stations as part of a single organization. It also reflects WNED-TV&#x27;s significant Canadian viewership and financial support, though cable and satellite carriage. WNED officials told &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; that the organization&#x27;s radio stations have minimal listenership in Canada.

WBFO leases an as-yet unutilized satellite studio in Toronto, Canada. Previously, WBFO broadcast from the South campus (a.k.a. Main Street Campus) of the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York.

=== Past Programs===
Prior to March 2012, WBFO presented a full-service mix of news and music programming that incorporated blues and jazz. WBFO&#x27;s local news department had been highly recognized by the New York State Associated Press Broadcasters Association. WBFO was all-news and information during the day and featured jazz at night. On weekends there had been a mix of nationally syndicated talk programs (such as &quot;Car Talk&quot; and &quot;Only a Game&quot;) on weekend mornings. Weekend music programs included &quot;The Thistle &amp; Shamrock&quot;, &quot;Bebop and Beyond&quot;, and &quot;Piano Jazz with Marian McPartland&quot; in the evenings. Locally originated blues programming was broadcast on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.

A four-hour block of jazz programming during the midday shift was eliminated in 2010, with &quot;Fresh Air&quot; moving to an earlier time slot and additional talk programming (all network or syndicated) added. The program changes also eliminated an additional two hours of jazz and local music in the evening time slot, pushing the start of jazz programming from 8 p.m. back to 10 p.m., being replaced by replays of programming that had already aired on WBFO earlier in the day.

All remaining local and syndicated music programming on WBFO, with the exception of the weekend afternoon blues blocks which were moved to evenings were eliminated on March 1, 2012, after WNED took over WBFO&#x27;s operations. The only music programming on either WNED or WBFO were the blues blocks and &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, which had previously aired on WNED. (The latter show ended in 2016 with Garrison Keillor&#x27;s retirement; neither WBFO nor WNED carried the successor program &quot;Live from Here,&quot; which ran until 2020.)

===HD Radio programming===

A musical satellite feed called &quot;Exponential&quot; had been carried on the HD2 digital subchannel. That was replaced by a satellite-fed jazz service called &quot;JazzWorks.&quot; In November 2021, JazzWorks was moved to 94.5 WNED-FM-HD2 to make way for &quot;WBFO The Bridge,&quot; an adult album alternative format.

A third subchannel, HD3, carried NPR news and information programs at different times than they were heard on the main channel. This was eliminated when &quot;JazzWorks&quot; was added to HD3. On June 23, 2024, WBFO launched a Spanish language public radio format on its HD3 subchannel, branded as &quot;Radio Bilingue&quot;. Fulltime jazz programming is now heard on a subchannel of 94.5 WNED-FM.

<doc id="1021362" wikidata="Q27969799" url="?curid=1021362" title="Saigon Execution">
<text>Saigon Execution is a 1968 photograph by Associated Press photojournalist Eddie Adams, taken during the Tet Offensive of the Vietnam War. It depicts South Vietnamese brigadier general Nguyễn Ngọc Loan shooting Viet Cong captain Nguyễn Văn Lém near the Ấn Quang Pagoda in Saigon. The photograph was published extensively by American news media the next day, and would later win Adams the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography.

== Background ==

Nguyễn Văn Lém was a captain in the Viet Cong (VC) and was known by the code name Bảy Lốp. He and his wife Nguyễn Thị Lốp lived as undercover arms traffickers in Saigon, trading tires as a front business.

Nguyễn Ngọc Loan was the chief of the Republic of Vietnam National Police (RVNP), and brigadier general of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). He had anticipated the Tet Offensive, and was responsible for coordinating the ARVN response in Saigonincluding commanding the RVNP to capture the Ấn Quang Pagoda, which the VC were using as a base of operations.

Eddie Adams was an Associated Press (AP) war photographer. Having worked previously as a US Marine, he had a reputation for being fearless, taking pictures close to danger, and for being often &quot;in the right place at the right time&quot;. Adams had been in Vietnam since 1965 to cover the war, and on February 1, 1968 he heard from the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) about fighting in Chợ Lớn. He met with NBC journalist Howard Tuckner, cameramen Võ Huỳnh and Võ Suu, and soundman Lê Phúc Đinh. They shared a car to Chợ Lớn to cover the conflict.

== Execution ==

The NBC and AP crews arrived at the Ấn Quang Pagoda the same morning, and having seen nothing of interest by noon, were preparing to leave. A cameraman for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) was also present. Meanwhile, Lém was captured by ARVN marines while wearing civilian clothing. The marines escorted him to where the journalists happened to be. The journalists noticed this; the NBC and ABC cameramen began filming. Loan instructed a marine to kill Lém, but he was reluctant, so Loan unholstered his gun, a .38 Special Smith &amp; Wesson Bodyguard revolver. The ABC correspondent was spooked by Loan and stopped filming. Adams believed this was merely an intimidation tactic, but nonetheless prepared to take a photo. Loan then shot Lém. At the same time, Adams snapped the photo, photographing the moment the bullet was still inside Lém&#x27;s head. Lém fell to the ground, blood spurting out of the wound. Loan then explained his actions to the journalists, citing the Americans and South Vietnamese that had died.
A marine placed a VC propaganda leaflet on Lém&#x27;s face. His body was left in the street and later taken to a mass grave.

== Justifications ==
=== Loan in interviews ===
According to Oriana Fallaci in her book Nothing, and So Be It, Loan explained shooting Lém in a 1968 interview by arguing that Lém &quot;wasn’t wearing a uniform and I can’t respect a man who shoots without wearing a uniform... I was filled with rage.&quot; In a later 1972 interview with Tom Buckley of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, when asked why he killed Lém, Loan said &quot;When you see a man in civilian clothes with a revolver killing your people ... what are you supposed to do? We knew who this man was. His name was Nguyễn Tân Đạt, alias Hàn Sơn. He was the commander of a sapper unit. He killed a policeman. He spit in the face of the men who captured him.&quot;

=== Lém&#x27;s previous actions ===
As part of the Tet Offensive, the Viet Cong conducted the targeted killings of prominent people opposed to the VC. Some authors have suggested that Lém was involved in such activities. A story emerged during the 1980s that Lém had just murdered a police major, a subordinate and close friend of General Loan, and the major&#x27;s whole family. Eddie Adams believed and repeated this story. &quot;It turns out that the Viet Cong lieutenant who was killed in the picture had murdered a police major--one of General Loan&#x27;s best friends--his whole family, wife, kids, the same guy. So these are things we didn&#x27;t know at the time.&quot; &quot;I didn&#x27;t have a picture of that Viet Cong blowing away the family.&quot; In 2008, a new version appeared, in which Lém had murdered the family of Lieutenant Colonel Nguyễn Tuấn, who was not a subordinate of General Loan but an officer in the armored forces of the ARVN. Vietnam war historian Edwin E. Moïse believes that story is South Vietnamese propaganda, noting the later stories about Lém&#x27;s actions were not part of Loan&#x27;s initial explanations. Noting this position, historian Max Hastings said &quot;the truth will never be known&quot;. A similar skeptical assessment was made by researcher Christopher Saunders.

Other stories about Lém assert that he was a turncoat who had been working for both the police and the Vietcong, or that he was a small time Vietcong informant who was captured while simply trying to escape.

== Reactions ==
The event received extensive attention in the US during the coming days; the photo was published on most American newspapers the next morning, and 20 million people saw the NBC&#x27;s film of it on &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; that evening. Various other organizations and American politicians commented on the event.

The photograph is commonly characterized as having created a massive shift in American public opinion against the war. Historian David Perlmutter found little to no evidence to back up this claim.

== Photograph ==

The photo came to haunt Adams: &quot;I was getting money for showing one man killing another. Two lives were destroyed, and I was getting paid for it. I was a hero.&quot; He elaborated on this in a later piece of writing: &quot;Two people died in that photograph. The general killed the Viet Cong; I killed the general with my camera.&quot; 

Ben Wright, associate director for communications at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History, said of the photo: &quot;There&#x27;s something in the nature of a still image that deeply affects the viewer and stays with them. The film footage of the shooting, while ghastly, doesn&#x27;t evoke the same feelings of urgency and stark tragedy.&quot;

== Aftermath ==

Nguyễn Ngọc Loan continued to serve as Brigadier General and Chief of Police until he was wounded in action in May that year. In 1975, he fled South Vietnam during the Fall of Saigon, emigrating eventually to the United States. Pressure from the U.S. Congress resulted in an investigation by the Library of Congress, which concluded that Lém&#x27;s execution was illegal under South Vietnamese law. In 1978, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) contended that Loan had committed a war crime. They attempted to deport him, but President Jimmy Carter personally intervened to stop the proceedings, stating that &quot;such historical revisionism was folly&quot;. Carter&#x27;s staff explained that the president was concerned about how Loan would be treated back in Vietnam. Loan died on July 14, 1998, in Burke, Virginia, at the age of 67.

The sole survivor of the massacre of Tuân&#x27;s family (allegedly by Lém) was Huan Nguyen; aged nine at the time, he was shot three times during the attack and stayed with his mother for two hours as she bled to death. In 2019, he became the highest-ranking Vietnamese-American officer in the U.S. military when he was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy.

In 2012, Douglas Sloan made a short movie, &quot;Saigon &#x27;68,&quot; about Adams&#x27; photograph. This movie details the influence it had on the lives of Adams and Loan, and on public opinion of the Vietnam War.

<text>Odzun () is a village in the Lori Province of Armenia. It is situated on a plateau above the left bank of the Debed river gorge, about a thousand metres above the Yerevan–Tbilisi highway, a few kilometres south of the town of Alaverdi. It is famous for the 6th–8th-century Odzun Church, an Armenian basilica with a cupola, overlooking the gorge.

== Name ==
According to one explanation, the name of the village derives from the Armenian word &#x27;snake&#x27;; thus, &quot;Odzun&quot; means &#x27;having many snakes&#x27; or &#x27;place of snakes&#x27;. The name of the village is attested in various forms, such as &quot;Otsun&quot;, &quot;Ozun&quot;, &quot;Adzun&quot; and &quot;Udzun&quot;. Turkic speakers called the village &quot;Uzunlar&quot;, formed by etymological reinterpretation of the Armenian name (&quot;uzun&quot; means &#x27;tall&#x27; or &#x27;long&#x27;, and &quot;-lar&quot; is a plural-forming suffix). The village was officially known by this latter name from the beginning of the 19th century until 1967, when it was renamed &quot;Odzun&quot;.

== Geography ==

=== Topography ===
The village is situated on a high plateau on the left bank of the Debed River. It is spread out and surrounded by fruit trees and fertile fields. The village receives its drinking water from a source located 17–18 kilometers away.

== History ==

In antiquity, Odzun was located in the Tashir district of the province of Gugark. It is mentioned in written sources from the 8th century onward and is one of the oldest settlements in the district of Tashir. In the early medieval period, it served as the center of that district. The 8th-century head of the Armenian Church, Catholicos (Hovhan Odznetsi), hailed from this village. In the 13th century, Vardan Areveltsi referred to the settlement as a large village or small town (). There are antiquities from various periods in the village and its vicinity. The Odzun Church, an Armenian basilica with a cupola, is located in the center of the village. There was once an extensive cemetery with &quot;khachkars&quot; surrounding the church. The date of the church&#x27;s construction is disputed. According to some authors, it was constructed in the 8th century and consecrated by John of Odzun, while others believe it was built as early as the end of the 6th century and later renovated by Catholicos John. Near the church is a funerary monument with carved images dating to the 5th–6th centuries, but which tradition attributes to one of the Bagratid kings. The remains of a 5th-century single-nave church called Tsaghkavank are located on the outskirts of the village.

<doc id="1021369" wikidata="Q1346111" url="?curid=1021369" title="John Claudius Loudon">
<text>John Claudius Loudon (8 April 1782 – 14 December 1843) was a Scottish botanist, garden designer and author, born in Cambuslang in 1782. He was the first to use the term arboretum in writing to refer to a garden of plants, especially trees, collected for the purpose of scientific study. He was married to Jane Webb, a fellow horticulturalist, and author of science-fiction, fantasy, horror, and gothic stories.

== Early life ==
Loudon was born in Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, Scotland to a respectable farmer. Therefore, as he was growing up, he developed a practical knowledge of plants and farming. As a young man, Loudon studied biology, botany and agriculture at the University of Edinburgh. When working on the layout of farms in South Scotland, he described himself as a landscape planner. This was a time when open field land was being converted from run rig with &#x27;ferm touns&#x27; to the landscape of enclosure, which now dominates British agriculture.

Loudon developed a limp as a young man, and later became disabled with arthritis. He undertook a second Grand Tour of Europe and also visited the Near East. In 1826, disabled by rheumatism and arthritis, he had to endure an amputation at his right shoulder after a botched operation to correct a broken arm. He learnt to write and draw with his left arm and hired a draughtsman to prepare his plans. At the same time he cured himself of an opium habit that had been keeping the pain at bay.

== Work ==

===Horticultural work===
Around 1803, Loudon published an article entitled &quot;Observations on Laying out the Public Spaces in London&quot;. It recommended the introduction of lighter trees rather than those with dense canopies. Loudon was attacked by rheumatic fever in 1806 which left him disabled, but this illness did not affect his writing. As his condition deteriorated over time, Loudon was forced to use the services of a draughtsman and other aids.

Beginning in 1808, Loudon was employed by George Frederick Stratton to landscape and farm his property, Tew Park, where he was able to set up a school for young men to be instructed in theory of farming and modes of cultivating the soil. Loudon&#x27;s design was a model of efficiency and convenience reflected in elegance and refinement. In conjunction with the goals of diffusing agricultural knowledge, Loudon published a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Utility of Agricultural Knowledge to the Sons of the Landed Proprietors of Great Britain, &amp;c., by a Scotch Farmer and Land-Agent.&quot;

After travelling through Europe from 1813 to 1814, Loudon began to focus on the improvement of the construction of greenhouses and other agricultural systems. He ultimately developed a design for hinged surfaces that could be adjusted depending on the angle of the sun. Loudon also developed plans for industrial worker housing and solar heating systems. In 1815, he was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Loudon established himself as a city planner, decades before Frederick Law Olmsted and others began to work. His vision for the possibility of long term planning for London&#x27;s green spaces was illustrated within his work, &quot;Hints for Breathing Places for Metropolis&quot; published in 1829. He envisioned city growth being carefully shaped and circulation influenced by the inclusion of green belts.

In 1832, Loudon established the design theory entitled &quot;Gardenesque&quot;. In this style, attention was given to the individual plant and placement in the best conditions for them to grow to their potential. Nineteenth century thought was punctuated by the belief that gardens should not mimic nature, so &quot;Gardenesque&quot; offered a solution by introducing exotics into gardens and basing layouts on abstract shapes.

Loudon was instrumental in the adoption of the term &quot;landscape architecture&quot; by the modern profession. He took up the term from Gilbert Laing Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the &quot;Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton&quot;.

===Architecture===
Sir Howard Colvin noted that, although Loudon did not regard himself as a practising architect, there is evidence that in his early days as a landscape gardener he did occasionally act in that capacity. His architectural thinking and his inclinations towards the Gothic style may be found in his &quot;A treatise on forming, improving, and managing country residences.&quot; A handful of architectural works – now largely lost – are associated with him. In 1806 he altered the exterior of Barnbarrow (Barnbarroch), Wigtown (burned 1942). However, his principal architectural work appears to have been Garth (Guilsfield), near Welshpool, Montgomeryshire, begun in 1809. His scheme for Garth was in what Colvin termed a &quot;crudely Gothic&quot; design. The scheme was illustrated in his &quot;Observations on laying out farms in the Scotch Style&quot;, but in execution the designs were modified by the patrons, Richard and Charlotte Mytton. The house was demolished during the winter of 1946–7. At Hope End, near Ledbury, Herefordshire, which was built at the same time as Garth, Loudon embellished a square classical design with huge circular buttresses, pinnacles, ogee-arches windows and a central ogee dome in what Colvin described as &quot;coarsely designed in a pseudo-Moorish style&quot;. Later in life, in 1823-4 Loudon designed Nos.3 and 5 Porchester Terrace, London as a &quot;double detached villa&quot;, living in No.3 himself.

===Horticulture and design===

Loudon was a prolific horticultural and landscape design writer. Through his publications, he hoped to spread his ideals of the creation of common space and the improvement of city planning and develop an awareness and interest in agriculture and horticulture. Through his magazines and works, he was able to communicate with lay folk as well as other professionals.

He wrote &quot;An Encyclopædia of Gardening&quot; in 1822. After its success Loudon published &quot;The Encyclopedia of Agriculture&quot; in 1825. He founded the &quot;Gardener&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the first periodical devoted solely to horticulture, in 1826. A short time later, he commenced the &quot;Magazine of Natural History&quot; in 1828.

Perhaps the most significant of these, certainly the most time-consuming and costly, was &quot;Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum&quot;. This work was published in three formats: with the plates entirely uncoloured, with botanical details hand-coloured, and fully hand-coloured. Work began in 1830 and it was first issued in sixty-three monthly parts from January 1835 to July 1838. It presented: an exhaustive account of all the trees and shrubs growing in Great Britain and their history; notes on remarkable examples growing in individual gardens; drawings of leaves, twigs, fruits, and the shapes of leafless trees; and entire portraits of trees in their young and mature state. All were drawn from life, many being from the parkland grounds of Syon House, one of the homes of the Duke of Northumberland to whom the work was dedicated, or from Loddiges&#x27; arboretum. &quot;It was on the collection maintained by this firm more than any other that J. C. Loudon relied for living material in the preparation of his great work&quot; W. J. Bean notes, in &quot;Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles&quot;. The publication also ruined him financially, as he ended up with many unsold copies of the eight-volume work and went deep into debt.
His work on cemeteries also was significant. Churchyards were becoming full, especially in urban areas, and new cemeteries were being opened by private enterprises. Loudon designed only three cemeteries (Bath Abbey Cemetery, Histon Road Cemetery, Cambridge, and Southampton Old Cemetery where the design was rejected) but his writing was a major influence on other designers and architects of the period.

An unusual creation by Loudon is the memorial to his parents, which stands in the grounds of St John the Baptist, Pinner&#x27;s parish church. It is in the form of a stone wedge, with a fake stone sarcophagus within. It has been Grade II listed since 1983.

Loudon thought that public improvements should be undertaken in a democratic fashion and in a comprehensive and reasonable manner, not sporadically by the benevolence of the wealthy. In 1839, he was commissioned to design the Arboretum at Derby. In his commissions, Loudon displayed the principles that he advocated in his writings; he took into account the general public, aiming to create a space where the classes could mingle easily as well as creating community pride. Plantings were labelled extensively. Loudon&#x27;s design for the Derby Arboretum paralleled the Loddiges arboretum at Abney Park and served as inspiration for the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew.

== Marriage to Jane Webb ==
In 1830, when Loudon was 47 years old, he asked a friend to invite the anonymous author of &quot;The Mummy! Or a Tale of the Twenty-Second Century&quot; to lunch. He had recently reviewed and admired the inventions in this novel in an article published in his &quot;Gardener&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Set in 2126 AD, it is an early example of science fiction. England had become an absolute monarchy and it featured an early Internet, espresso machines, and air-conditioning. The author turned out to be Jane Webb who, having been left penniless at 17 by the death of her father, had turned to writing as a profession. They married seven months later and had a daughter, Agnes, who later married the solicitor and political agent Markham Spofforth from 1858 until her death in 1863.

Loudon loved the fantastical and his wife&#x27;s expression of it. Their marriage not only symbolized a mutual admiration of one another&#x27;s minds, but a number of innovations in the world of gardening. Through her marriage, Jane Loudon encountered her husband&#x27;s work and decided to create her own guides to make gardening more accessible to young women. The Loudons were considered the leading horticulturalists of their day, and their circle of friends included Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray.

== Death and legacy ==

Design of the municipal cemetery at Southampton was Loudon&#x27;s final project. Despite advanced lung cancer, he corrected the final proofs for his latest encyclopaedia. He travelled to Bath to inspect the site for another cemetery; and then to Oxford to see a client. On his return to London, his doctor told him that he was dying; he died, penniless and in debt, in the arms of his wife in December 1843. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

Loudoun Road in St John&#x27;s Wood is named after him, despite the different spelling. A plaque jointly commemorating the Loudons was erected at their former home, 3 Porchester Terrace, Bayswater in 1953, by London County Council.

<text>John Wellborn Root Jr. (July 14, 1887 – October 24, 1963) was a significant United States architect based in Chicago. He was the son of architect John Wellborn Root. As a young man, he graduated from Cornell University and studied architecture at Paris&#x27; École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, where he became friends with John Augur Holabird, the son of another famous Chicago architect. Root returned to the States and joined his friend on the architectural staff at Holabird &amp; Roche in 1919.

After the deaths of William Holabird in 1923 and Martin Roche in 1927, the firm was reorganized under the new partnership of Holabird &amp; Root. They worked on many dazzling projects in the late 1920s and early 1930s, before the Great Depression slowed new construction. These years are notable for the firm&#x27;s many impressive Art Deco buildings.

The firm weathered the Depression and Root remained an active partner into old age.

<text>East Sooke is an unincorporated community south and east of Sooke, British Columbia, Canada. It consists of over 500 houses (and one volunteer fire department), along with the headquarters of the Royal Canadian Marine Search and Rescue (RCMSAR) organization on the south side of the Sooke Basin. East Sooke borders on East Sooke Regional Park, an area of , with views south to Olympic National Park in the United States.

East Sooke does not have a town council. Instead it is governed by a regional director who is also responsible for other unincorporated areas in the Capital Regional District (the regional district of Greater Victoria).

East Sooke&#x27;s general character is rural, although it is a bedroom community of Victoria, British Columbia. Its close proximity to Victoria, its character as a bedroom community, and its large tracts of undeveloped land have made it an attractive location for recreation and retirement developments. Political scuffles over the development of the community have led to two large sections of East Sooke splitting off and joining Sooke.

The population of East Sooke is roughly 1,500 (2001 census: 1434). There is no town core, but there is a single convenience store. East Sooke is a mix of small residential subdivisions, small hobby farms, and wilderness.

There are currently no schools in East Sooke, although there have been plans for an elementary school for a number of years. Some children are bussed to Sooke schools. This community is part of School District 62 Sooke. Some families in East Sooke homeschool their kids, negating the need to travel to Sooke for school.

<doc id="1021374" wikidata="Q4292828" url="?curid=1021374" title="Naoshi Mizuta">
<text>is a Japanese video game composer and musician. He is best known for his work on the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, most notably &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, but has also composed music for games such as &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;, &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot;, and &quot;Parasite Eve II&quot;. He started his career at Capcom before moving to Square (now Square Enix) in 1998.

==Biography==
Born in Kōchi, Japan in 1972, Mizuta&#x27;s interest in music began to grow when he &quot;was in the second or third grade&quot;. Although still interested in music, Mizuta studied law and economics at Chiba University. He composed his first song while in his last year there, and after graduating went to work for Capcom in 1995 as a composer. He began his career scoring the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series where he was part of the sound team for &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; in 1995. 

In 1998, while still working for Capcom, Mizuta applied to Square as a composer in response to an advertisement and was hired. His first assignment for Square was to score &quot;Parasite Eve II&quot;, for which he was the sole composer and spent a year and a half working on. The original &quot;Parasite Eve&quot; game was scored by Yoko Shimomura, and Mizuta incorporated some of the original game&#x27;s musical themes into the sequel. Mizuta&#x27;s next role was as the main composer for &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, with assistance from Nobuo Uematsu and Kumi Tanioka. Mizuta remained with the &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; project for over ten years, serving as the sole composer for the game&#x27;s five expansions, and considers it his life&#x27;s work. During this period, Mizuta became involved in The Star Onions, a band composed of Square Enix composers for which he plays bass guitar. Other members of the band, which plays arrangements of songs from &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, include Tanioka, Hidenori Iwasaki, and Tsuyoshi Sekito. The band has since released two albums, &quot;Music from the Other Side of Vana&#x27;diel&quot; and &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.

Mizuta has also worked on several other projects for Square Enix, including &quot;Blood of Bahamut&quot; and &quot;Guardian Cross&quot;. He has also worked on many other games in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, including &quot;Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XIII-2&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn&quot;, and &quot;Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==
For games, Mizuta is primarily focused on creating music that fits the title and the scene at hand, without consideration for how it might sound in isolation. On older consoles, the hardware restricted composers to working with a limited number of channels, which challenged composers to create strong, memorable melodies without the aid of atmospheric and accompanying lines. Even without such constraints in modern titles, Mizuta feels that this style has its merits and is worth preserving in modern games. On the other hand, for alternative presentations of his music such as live performances or piano arrangements, Mizuta feels more free to have fun and play it however he likes. Mizuta is heavily influenced by the work of Ryuichi Sakamoto, as well as Nobuo Uematsu, his superior at Square. He also draws inspiration from a variety of film scores as well as fan remixes of his work on YouTube.

Once in the United States, Pham gained employment at his cousin&#x27;s laundry business. His cousin is the famed professional poker player Men Nguyen, from whom Pham learned poker and continued to do so even after Pham along with his wife had opened a nail salon in Los Angeles, California.

In both 2000 and 2007 Pham was named &quot;Player of the Year&quot; by Card Player.

As of 2017, his total live tournament winnings exceed $9,850,000. His 50 cashes at the WSOP account for over $2,175,000 of those winnings.

Born in Tucson, Arizona, Borchers attended East High School in Pueblo, Colorado where he played on the boys&#x27; soccer team. In his four years at East High School, he was selected all-league three times and All-State once. He was chosen as the League MVP his senior year. He also played for the youth club, Colorado Storm (Club Colorado Select). In addition to playing soccer, Borchers ran track and played basketball. Two of his sporting idols were Magic Johnson and Dennis Bergkamp.

Borchers played four years of college soccer for the University of Denver from 1999 to 2002, and also excelled for the Colorado Rapids&#x27; PDL affiliate, the Boulder Rapids Reserve. He was selected all-league three times and was the MVP of the league in his senior year at DU. Despite this, Borchers went undrafted in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft. Borchers earned his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in accounting while in school.

==Club career==

Borchers was signed to the Colorado Rapids developmental roster on March 18, 2003. However, he soon proved to be far better than most had expected and by the middle of the 2003 season had secured a starting spot in Colorado&#x27;s first team central defense. Throughout the 2005 season, Borchers continued to anchor the Rapids defense.

In 2006, Borchers was transferred to Norwegian club Odd Grenland. In February 2008, Borchers signed with MLS side Real Salt Lake on a transfer, after being released by Odd Grenland. His success with RSL in his first three seasons with the club led to a long-term deal announced on February 14, 2011, that kept Borchers in Salt Lake through the 2014 season.

On December 8, 2014, Borchers was traded to Portland Timbers in exchange for allocation funds. During his time with the Timbers, Borchers had been a starting defender contributing in the club&#x27;s 2015 Championship run. The defender in 2016 had suffered with a leg injury that had him out for the rest of the season. On February 2, 2017, he retired from professional soccer.

==International career==
Borchers&#x27; surprising 2003 season led to him being called up for the Under-23 team&#x27;s Olympic Qualifiers, in which the team was eliminated. He earned his first cap for the senior national team on March 9, 2005, against Colombia. Borchers last played for the senior team on November 17, 2010, against South Africa, entering in the 67th minute.

==Outside football==
In addition to soccer, Borchers owns and manages his own commercial real estate investment company.

<text>Cuyamaca (Kumeyaay: &quot;‘Ekwiiyemak&quot;) is a region of eastern San Diego County, California. It lies east of the Capitan Grande Reservation in the western Laguna Mountains, north of Descanso and south of Julian. Named for the 1845 Rancho Cuyamaca Mexican land grant, the region is now dominated by the Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. Within the park is the prominent Cuyamaca Peak, the second-highest mountain in San Diego County at . The modern community of Cuyamaca is on the north side of the lake. It consists of the Cuyamaca Woods, Cuyamaca Resort, and North Peak areas.

The name is a Spanish corruption of the Kumeyaay phrase &quot;&#x27;Ekwiiyemak&quot;, which means, according to Margaret Langdon&#x27;s translation, &quot;Behind the clouds&quot;. It has also been translated as &quot;the place where it rains&quot;, a reference to the region&#x27;s higher average precipitation than San Diego County&#x27;s low coastal areas. Cuyamaca is a popular toponym lending its name to streets, businesses and a community college in the San Diego area.

==History==
During the Julian Gold Rush, a quartz gold mine; the Stonewall Mine, was found on the south side of what is now Lake Cuyamaca. First a mining camp called Stonewall (1873–1876), then the mining company town of Stratton (1887–1888), renamed Cuyamaca City (1888–1906), at its peak had a population of 500 and served the Stonewall Mine.

In 1906, the post office was closed and service moved to Descanso. The town was abandoned after mining operations ceased, and few traces of it exist. The site of the town now lies within Cuyamaca Rancho State Park at . 

The modern community of Cuyamaca later developed on the north side of the lake. Before the Cedar Fire of 2003, the community of Cuyamaca consisted of approximately 145 homes on a mountain (North Peak) north of the reservoir. 

=== Cedar Fire ===

In October 2003, most of the Cuyamaca region was consumed by the Cedar Fire. Nearly in the state park and 120 homes in the community of Cuyamaca were incinerated. The fire also destroyed the Lakeland Resort, Camp Fire&#x27;s Camp Wolahi and the former San Diego-Imperial Council, BSA&#x27;s Camp Hual-Cu-Cuish .
The historic Dyer Ranch house in the center of the state park, which functioned as a museum and the park headquarters, was also destroyed.

<doc id="1021381" wikidata="Q3105876" url="?curid=1021381" title="Gilbert Tennent">
<text>Gilbert Tennent (5 February 1703 – 23 July 1764) was a Presbyterian revivalist minister in Colonial America. Born into a Scotch-Irish family in County Armagh, Ireland, he migrated to America with his parents, studied theology, and along with Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield, became one of the leaders of the evangelical revival known as the First Great Awakening. His most famous sermon, &quot;On the Danger of an Unconverted Ministry&quot;, also known as the &quot;Nottingham Sermon,&quot; compared &quot;Old Side&quot; ministers to the biblical Pharisees of the Gospels, triggering a schism in the Presbyterian Church which lasted for 17 years. A prolific writer, Tennent would later work towards reunification of the two synods involved.

==Early life==
Gilbert Tennent, the eldest son of William Tennent and Catherine Kennedy, was born at Vinecash, County Armagh, Ireland. Gilbert&#x27;s father was a Church of Ireland minister who emigrated to the American colonies before 1718, when he successfully applied to the Synod of Philadelphia to be accepted as a Presbyterian minister. In 1721, the family moved from Westchester, New York to Pennsylvania where William served as pastor at Bensalem in Bucks County. Five years later he accepted a call to Neshaminy in what is now Warminster where he remained until his death in 1746. 

Gilbert and his three younger brothers received a classical education from their father in Ireland and America. Gilbert briefly studied medicine but in 1723 switched his focus to theology. In May 1725, he was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Philadelphia. The same year he received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale College in recognition of his educational achievements despite not having attended lectures.

==Ministry==
In December 1725, Tennent accepted a call to ministry in Newcastle, Delaware but left abruptly after a few weeks. He was consequently reprimanded by the Synod. He assisted his father in the founding of Log College at Neshaminy, but soon accepted a call to establish a church in New Brunswick, New Jersey. 

While at New Brunswick, Tennent became friends with Theodorus Frelinghuysen, a Dutch Reformed minister who greatly influenced Tennent and helped him develop his ministerial and preaching skills.

Tennent became an enthusiastic orator known for &quot;preaching the terrors&quot; and for his fiery exhortations to repent. Tennent met George Whitefield, an itinerant evangelist minister from England, in April 1740. He accompanied Whitefield on a preaching tour of New Jersey and Staten Island, and in the winter of 1741 embarked on his own tour of New England. George Whitefield was impressed with Tennent&#x27;s preaching and referred to him as &quot;a son of thunder&quot; in his journal.

Tennent&#x27;s views increasing brought into him into conflict with the Synod. He supported &quot;enthusiastic itinerancy,&quot; opposed changes to the Synod&#x27;s educational requirements for ordination, and insisted that only those who experienced &quot;genuine conversion&quot; should be ministers.

He was scornful of his critics among conservative or &quot;Old Side&quot; Presbyterians and in his 1740 sermon &quot;The Danger of an Unconverted Ministry&quot;, also known as the &quot;Nottingham Sermon&quot;, denounced his opponents, calling them Pharisees who had, &quot;no experience of a special work of the Holy Ghost upon their own souls.&quot; 

In 1738, several &quot;New Side&quot; ministers led by Tennent had split from the Presbytery of Philadelphia and formed the Presbytery of New Brunswick. In 1741, the Synod of Philadelphia voted to exclude the New Brunswick Presbytery, effectively expelling Tennent and other revivalist ministers. In 1745, the Presbytery of New Brunswick joined with the Presbytery of New York to form the Synod of New York.

Tennent expressed regret for his role in fomenting the dissension that resulted in the scism. His sermons became less passionate and he worked towards reconciliation with the Old Side faction. In 1743, he left New Brunswick to become the founding pastor of Philadelphia&#x27;s Second Presbyterian Church. 

In 1746, Tennent was elected a trustee of the recently chartered College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). In 1753, he travelled to England to raise the funds to build what would become Nassau Hall.

The Old Side and New Side factions reunited in 1758. The Synod of Philadelphia and Synod of New York merged and Tennent was elected as the new moderator.

==Emissary==
Tennent retired from the ministry in 1762 due to chronic illness. In February 1764, Governor John Penn (governor) appointed Tennent to a delegation of civic leaders led by Benjamin Franklin and Tennent to meet with the Scotch-Irish vigilante group known as the Paxton Boys.

Scotch-Irish immigrants to Pennsylvania frequently squatted on indigenous territory. As a result they were the target of raids during the French and Indian War and Pontiac&#x27;s War. In response, Reverend John Elder, a Presbyterian minister from Paxtang known as the &quot;Fighting Parson,&quot; raised two companies of mounted associators. In December 1763, this group massacred 20 peaceable Susquehannock at Conestoga Town and Lancaster. In February 1764, the Paxton Boys led an armed march on Philadelphia with the intent of attacking the Moravian Lenape and Mohican who had been moved there for their protection.

The Paxton Boys halted their march in Germantown after learning about the sizable force that was prepared to meet them in Philadelphia. Following a day of negotiations, the marchers agreed to disperse after receiving assurances that their grievances would be presented to the Governor and Assembly.

==Family==

Tennent married three times. His first wife died childless in 1740. Tennent then married Cornelia Clarkson (née de Peyster), a widow with several children. She died in 1753. Sometime before 1762 Tennent married another widow, Sarah Spofford, who had one daughter by her first husband. She had three children with Tennent; one of the two daughters was given the name of Tennent&#x27;s second wife, Cornelia.

==Works==

Tennent had many of his sermons, as well as some of his other works, published by Benjamin Franklin and other Philadelphia printers. These include:
* &quot;The Danger of an Unconverted Ministry, Considered in a sermon on Mark VI. 34. Preached at Nottingham, in Pennsylvania, March 8, Anno 1739,40&quot; (1740)

<text>The Nuclear Reactor Operator Badge is an obsolete qualification badge of the United States Army which was issued between the years of 1965 and 1990. In 1991, the decoration was declared obsolete by Army Regulation 600-8-22, but uniform regulations permit the continued wearing of badges awarded before then. The Nuclear Reactor Operator Badge is worn above the ribbons over the left pocket flap of the Army uniform, in the same position as the Parachutist Badge.

The Nuclear Reactor Operator Badge was first authorized on June 18, 1965. The badge was issued in four degrees; the basic badge was awarded upon completion of the U.S. Army Nuclear Power Plant Operators Course. The Nuclear Reactor Operator Badge was worn on dress uniforms and also on duty uniforms in a subdued version. Miniature Nuclear Reactor Operator Badges were authorized for wear on dinner dress attire.

==Badge design==

The square (cube) is used to represent a nuclear reactor, the two bars representing control rods and thus alluding to nuclear reactor operations. The disc is symbolic of completeness and refers to the knowledge and training required of all nuclear reactor operators. The disc is also a symbol of the sun, the source of all energy and power. The symbol of the planet Uranus, from which the term &quot;uranium&quot; is derived, refers to nuclear energy and power. Addition of the laurel wreaths signifies further achievement and qualification. The gold color for the shift supervisor signifies the highest degree of achievement and qualification.

==Qualification criteria==
This material is transcribed, with a few small edits, from &quot;Standard Operating Procedure #1802&quot;, US Army Engineer Reactors Group, Ft. Belvoir, VA, dated 1 July 1969. It is clear from these requirements that progression through the various licensing levels was not automatic; that is, there was much more required than simply working a given number of shifts. The first level of qualification was graduation from the Nuclear Power Plant Operator Course; the Basic badge is shown at right.

<doc id="1021390" wikidata="Q141710" url="?curid=1021390" title="Sebastián Vizcaíno">
<text>Sebastián Vizcaíno (c. 1548–1624) was a Spanish soldier, entrepreneur, explorer, and diplomat whose varied roles took him to New Spain, the Baja California peninsula, the California coast and Asia.

== Early career ==
Vizcaíno was born in 1548, in Extremadura, Crown of Castile (Spain). He saw military service in the Spanish invasion of Portugal during 1580–1583. Coming to New Spain in 1583, he sailed as a merchant on a Manila galleon to the Spanish East Indies in 1586–1589. In 1587, he was on board the &quot;Santa Ana&quot; as one of the merchants when Thomas Cavendish captured it, robbing him and others of their personal cargoes of gold.

==The Californias==

In 1593, the disputed concession for pearl fishing on the western shores of the Gulf of California was transferred to Vizcaíno. He succeeded in sailing with three ships to La Paz, Baja California Sur, in 1596. He gave this site (known to Hernándo Cortés as Santa Cruz) its modern name and attempted to establish a settlement. However, problems of resupply, declining morale, and a fire soon forced its abandonment.

In 1601, the Spanish viceroy in Mexico City, Gaspar de Zúñiga, 5th Count of Monterrey, appointed Vizcaíno general-in-charge of a second expedition: to locate safe harbors in Alta California for Spanish galleons to use on their return voyage to Acapulco from Manila. He was also given the mandate to map in detail the California coastline that Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo had first reconnoitered 60 years earlier. He departed Acapulco with three ships on May 5, 1602. His flagship was the &quot;San Diego&quot; and the other two ships were the &quot;San Tomás&quot; and the &quot;Tres Reyes&quot;.

On November 10, 1602, Vizcaíno entered and named San Diego Bay. Sailing up the coast, Vizcaíno named many prominent features such as the Santa Barbara Channel Islands, Point Conception, the Santa Lucia Mountains, Point Lobos, Carmel River and Monterey Bay (obliterating some of the names given these same features by Cabrillo in 1542). He was the first person in recorded history to note certain ecological features of the California coast such as the Monterey cypress forest at Point Lobos.

The commander of the &quot;Tres Reyes&quot;, Martín de Aguilar, became separated from Vizcaíno and continued up the coast to present-day Oregon as far as Cape Blanco and possibly to Coos Bay. After Vizcaíno passed Cape Mendocino, he turned back, with some of his men suffering from scurvy and starvation. Half of the crew members, some 45 men, died during the expedition.

Much of what we know about Vizcaíno&#x27;s Pacific Coast voyage is from the diary of a Carmelite friar, chronicler and cosmographer who traveled with the expedition.

One result of Vizcaíno&#x27;s voyage was a flurry of enthusiasm for establishing a Spanish settlement at Monterey, but this was ultimately deferred for another 167 years after the Conde de Monterrey left to become Viceroy of Peru and his successor was less favorable. A colonizing expedition was authorized in 1606 for 1607, but was delayed and then canceled in 1608.

==Japanese relations==
In 1611, Vizcaíno carried a Japanese delegation led by Tanaka Shōsuke from Mexico back to Japan. In an ambassadorial capacity, Vizcaíno met with the shōgun Tokugawa Hidetada and his father, the retired first shōgun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, founder of the Tokugawa dynasty. However, diplomacy soured due to a rumor that the Spanish intended to use the Japanese Christian minority to overthrow the shogunate and take control of Japan. After taking his leave in 1612, he surveyed the east coast of Japan and searched for two mythical islands called Rico de Oro and Rico de Plata. Failing to find them, he returned to Japan.

In 1613, Vizcaíno accompanied the Japanese embassy led by Hasekura Tsunenaga to Mexico. In Acapulco, Vizcaíno was seriously injured in a fight with the Japanese, as recorded by 17th-century Aztec historian Chimalpahin in his journal, &quot;Annals of His Time&quot;. The Japanese entourage continued to Mexico City, and embarked a ship at Veracruz bound for Europe.

==Dutch conflict==

In October 1615, Vizcaíno commanded 200 men at the port of Salagua against an attack by 200 Dutch pirates led by Joris van Spilbergen. In the afternoon, both sides ran out of ammunition. Vizcaíno&#x27;s men retreated after the Dutch returned with more ammunition.

==Death==
Sebastián Vizcaíno died in 1624 in Mexico City, New Spain.

In 1888, botanist Edward Lee Greene published &quot;Viscainoa&quot;, which is a genus of flowering plants from Mexico belonging to the family Zygophyllaceae and was named in Sebastián Vizcaíno&#x27;s honour.

<text>The 50th Georgia Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment raised by the state of Georgia to fight for the Confederacy in the American Civil War.

The regiment was organized on March 4, 1862, at Camp Davis, about 28 miles from Savannah. The recruits were primarily from southern Georgia. The original commander was Col. William R. Manning (1817–1871). They were drilled at Camp Davis, just outside Guyton, Georgia. Upon being mustered into Confederate service, the regiment served in the Savannah defenses, Military District of Georgia. On July 17, 1862, Major General John C. Pemberton sent the 50th Georgia Volunteers to Richmond to join Drayton&#x27;s Brigade in the First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia under its commanding general, Robert E. Lee.

For the majority of the war, the 50th Georgia served with the First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia. The regiment participated in more than 45 engagements during the war. Some of the early battles in the East that the regiment took part in included South Mountain, Sharpsburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. The regiment went south when James Longstreet took his corps to Georgia and Tennessee in the fall of 1863, where it was engaged at the Siege of Knoxville. Returning to Virginia, the 50th Georgia fought in the Siege of Petersburg, the Battle of Cedar Creek, and the Battle of Sayler&#x27;s Creek, where most of the regiment was captured.

The remaining men surrendered at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. After parole, they returned to Georgia and civilian life, holding several reunions over the years.

==Organization==
This regiment, formed in March 1862 served with the Army of Northern Virginia from July 1862 until its surrender at Appomattox Court House, except during Longstreet&#x27;s 1863 expedition to Georgia and Tennessee. Upon reaching Virginia, it was assigned to Drayton&#x27;s Brigade. During the Battle of Antietam (Battle of Sharpsburg), the regiment was assigned to .Toomb&#x27;s Brigade. Toomb&#x27;s Georgia troops were credited with defending the bridge over Antietam creek against several ill-fated attempts to cross it, until finally being pushed back late in the afternoon. After the battle, the 50th Regiment was permanently assigned to Paul Jones Semmes&#x27;s Brigade. The subsequent brigade commanders were Goode Bryan and James P. Simms.

<text>Santino Quaranta (born October 14, 1984) is an American former professional soccer player.

==Career==

===Youth===
Quaranta partially attended Baltimore&#x27;s Archbishop Curley High School for his freshman and sophomore years, where he started both years, and was recognized as one of the top soccer players in the state. Quaranta did not play college soccer, and instead spent time with the US U-17 national team at the IMG Soccer Academy in Bradenton, Florida, where he achieved exceptional success.

===Professional===
Quaranta was drafted eighth overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by D.C. United. At 16 years, four months, Quaranta surpassed fellow DC player Bobby Convey to become the youngest player in the history of Major League Soccer, a record which would subsequently be taken by another DC player, Freddy Adu.

Quaranta immediately excelled in MLS, registering five goals and one assist in just 16 games during the 2001 season. Unfortunately, in the subsequent three seasons, Quaranta was beset by injuries, and struggled to live up to his early promise. Although he started all eleven games that he played in during the 2002 season, Quaranta missed almost two-thirds of the season with injuries, and things did not improve in the following two seasons, where he played in just 13 games. With fitness restored, Quaranta returned to form in 2005, where he contributed 5 goals and 5 assists in 18 games played, and finished third highest at the club for goals scored that season.

Quaranta was traded to Los Angeles Galaxy from D.C. United for a partial allocation and a conditional draft pick on August 9, 2006. In his first match with the Galaxy the next day, Quaranta entered as a substitute and scored the only goal of the match in a 1–0 win over Houston.

On June 30, 2007, the Galaxy traded Quaranta to the New York Red Bulls, getting a conditional fourth round pick in the 2008 MLS SuperDraft in return. After featuring in just 3 games and 47 minutes for the team, he was waived by the Red Bulls on January 3, 2008.

Quaranta returned to D.C. United on March 6, 2008. He claims to have turned down larger offers from other MLS sides, but felt he still had a point to prove at D.C.

His first meaningful game back with D.C. United was as a substitute in the home leg of the quarterfinals of the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup against Harbour View of Jamaica. He had two assists in the 5–0 victory.

In his first regular season home game back with D.C. United on April 5, 2008, Quaranta picked up a goal and an assist.

Following the 2011 season, Quaranta&#x27;s option was not picked up by United, and he opted to retire. It was a very brief retirement as he quickly joined the new Premier League Soccer in India. He has claimed this is due to his salary being more than double his last MLS remuneration. However, a month later, the league was canceled before the season began.

===International===
Quaranta has played internationally for the Under-17 and Under-20 United States national soccer teams, but while he was dominant for the U-17&#x27;s, he was not able to secure a starting place on the U-20&#x27;s (although he did play in the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship). After coming back from injuries in 2005, Quaranta received his first cap for the senior team July 7, 2005 in a Gold Cup match against Cuba. He converted a penalty kick in the United States&#x27; shootout victory over Panama in the Gold Cup championship game. In 2009, Quaranta was named to the United States roster for that year&#x27;s edition of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. On July 8, 2009, he scored his first international goal against Honduras during a 2–0 victory in CONCACAF Gold Cup group play.

===Coaching===
On February 19, 2014, Quaranta took over from Steve Nichols as the head coach of the Baltimore Bohemians of the US Premier Development League. The club has been on hiatus since January 2017.

===International goals===
==Personal==
Quaranta is married and has two children: a daughter, Olivia Naomi Quaranta (2003) and a son, Valentino (2009). In 2011, Quaranta and Sean Rush started the Pipeline Soccer Club, a non-profit soccer club in Baltimore, MD, which both of his children played in. As of September 2022, Olivia is a member of the Loyola Greyhounds women&#x27;s soccer team, while Valentino followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and joined the D.C. United Academy&#x27;s U-14 team.

===Problems with drugs===
In a June 14, 2008 interview with the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Quaranta admitted to once having an addiction to painkillers and cocaine, but after a spell in rehab, he has stopped taking both. He now has a tattoo on his arm with the date that he became sober as a constant reminder of his past struggles.

==Honors==

*CONCACAF Gold Cup Champions (1): 2005

===D.C. United===

<text>Rock Theatre was a variety show performed at the drama department of the University of Southern California during the early 1980s, which integrated the genres of rock and musical theatre. After his graduation from USC, Rock Theatre director Greg Holford adapted the concept to his new position with a youth performing arts ensemble called &quot;Kids of the Century&quot; (formerly &quot;City of Los Angeles Children&#x27;s Chorus&quot;), in partnership with Musical Director Terry Danne.

The new, younger, Rock Theatre was hired for performances at many community and industrial events, and participated in vocal/dance competitions throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1992, Rock Theatre became a California non-profit educational corporation, with the stated goal of providing excellent opportunities for performing arts education to the youth of Southern California. It was also in 1992 that the group was chosen to represent the United States at the World&#x27;s Fair in Seville, Spain.

Among the alumni of Rock Theatre in its various incarnations are actors Ally Sheedy and Eric Stoltz, Dana Daurey (of the TV series &quot;Providence&quot;), Carmit Bachar (Pussycat Dolls), and Broadway headliner Mandy Gonzalez (&quot;In The Heights&quot;, &quot;Dance of the Vampires (musical)&quot;, &quot;Aida (musical)&quot;). While some alumni have gone on to perform on Broadway, TV, record albums, others have followed other career goals and passions.

Rock Theatre comprises two competition choirs in the movie &quot;Sister Act 2&quot; and is featured on John Tesh&#x27;s album &quot;The Choirs of Christmas&quot;. Other performance highlights include &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; at the Pantages Theatre starring Sam Harris. In 2000, a new generation of Rock Theatre was selected to perform before an international audience with a performance tour of Australia. Performances included at the World Music Festival, Olympic Torch Relay, and at the Sydney Opera House.

<doc id="1021407" wikidata="Q3953757" url="?curid=1021407" title="Eugene Volokh">
<text>Eugene Volokh (; born Yevhen Volodymyrovych Volokh (); February 29, 1968) is an American legal scholar known for his scholarship in American constitutional law and libertarianism as well as his prominent legal blog, &quot;The Volokh Conspiracy&quot;. Volokh is regarded as an expert on the First Amendment, and the Second Amendment. 

He is currently the Thomas M. Siebel Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, the Gary T. Schwartz Professor of Law Emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an affiliate at the law firm Schaerr Jaffe.

==Early life and education==
Volokh was born in the Soviet Union to a Jewish family residing in Kyiv, Ukraine. He emigrated with his family to the United States at the age of seven. Volokh exhibited extraordinary mathematical abilities from an early age. At the age of 9, he was attending university-level mathematics and calculus courses after he was found studying differential equations on his own. When only 10 years 1 month old, he earned a 780 out of a possible 800 on the math portion of what is now called the SAT-I. 

At the age of 12, he began working as a computer programmer and was enrolled as a sophomore at UCLA. He attended the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics. As a junior at UCLA, he earned $480 a week as a programmer for 20th Century Fox. During this period, Volokh&#x27;s achievements were featured in an episode of &quot;OMNI: The New Frontier&quot;, a television series hosted by Peter Ustinov. He graduated from UCLA at age 15 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and computer science.

Volokh later attended the UCLA Law School, where he was a managing editor of the &quot;UCLA Law Review&quot;. He graduated in 1992 with a Juris Doctor.

== Career ==
After law school, Volokh clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, then for Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor of the U.S. Supreme Court. Upon completing his Supreme Court clerkship in 1994, UCLA hired Volokh as a professor of law. As of 2018, he also held the position of Gary T. Schwartz Professor of Law, and was an academic affiliate at the law firm Mayer Brown. As of 2023, he was an affiliate of trial and appellate law firm Schaerr Jaffe.

In 2024, Volokh retired from UCLA, becoming a Professor of Law Emeritus, and moved to the Hoover Institution at Stanford, where he is the Thomas M. Siebel Senior Fellow.

==Politics==
Volokh is commonly described as politically conservative or libertarian. In 2012, one commentator described Volokh&#x27;s politics as &quot;soft libertarian&quot;, and Volokh as an &quot;unpredictable libertarian-leaning&quot; writer. He has been a longtime member of the Federalist Society since he first joined in the 1980s.

In the 2008 presidential election, Volokh supported former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson, saying Thompson had good instincts on legal issues and that he preferred Thompson&#x27;s positions on the First Amendment and political speech to John McCain&#x27;s sponsorship of campaign finance reform. Volokh also liked Thompson&#x27;s position in favor of individual gun ownership. He noted that Thompson &quot;takes federalism seriously, and he seems to have a fairly deep-seated sense that there is a real difference between state and federal power.&quot;

Volokh is a supporter of same-sex marriage.

==Writing==
Volokh&#x27;s article about &quot;The Commonplace Second Amendment&quot; (1998), was cited by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia&#x27;s majority opinion in the landmark Second Amendment case of &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;, and he has been quoted in the media on gun laws. His article, &quot;Might Federal Preemption of Speech-Protective State Laws Violate the First Amendment?&quot; (2021) was cited by Justice Clarence Thomas in a concurring opinion for &quot;Knight First Amendment Institute v. Trump&quot; (2021), with Thomas arguing that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act might be unconstitutional and that Twitter should be regulated as a common carrier.

Volokh advocates free speech on campus, religious freedom, and other First Amendment issues, and has been widely quoted as an expert. He opposes affirmative action, having worked as a legal advisor to California&#x27;s Proposition 209 campaign. Volokh is a critic of what he sees as the overly broad operation of American workplace harassment laws, including those relating to sexual harassment.

On his weblog, Volokh addresses a wide variety of issues, with a focus on politics and law.

Volokh&#x27;s non-academic work has been published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, and other publications. He was a contributing blogger at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; from 2005-2012.

==Family==
Volokh&#x27;s brother, Alexander &quot;Sasha&quot; Volokh, is a law professor at Emory University. Like Eugene, Alexander also clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit and Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court, although Alexander clerked for Justice Alito as well.

<doc id="1021410" wikidata="Q173192" url="?curid=1021410" title="2004 Chinese Grand Prix">
<text>The 2004 Chinese Grand Prix (officially the 2004 Formula 1 Sinopec Chinese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 September 2004 at the Shanghai International Circuit. It was Race 16 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship and was the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix.

The 56-lap race was won by Rubens Barrichello for the Ferrari team, from a pole position start. Jenson Button finished second for the BAR team, with Kimi Räikkönen third in a McLaren.

==Friday drivers==
The bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.
== Report ==
=== Background ===
Michael Schumacher and Ferrari were already the drivers&#x27; and constructors&#x27; world champions. After the 2004 Italian Grand Prix, Schumacher unassailably led the drivers&#x27; standings with 38 points ahead of Rubens Barrichello and 65 points ahead of Jenson Button. Ferrari led the constructors&#x27; championship with 140 points, unassailable ahead of BAR and 143 points ahead of Renault.

Renault fired Jarno Trulli after the Italian Grand Prix and was replaced by Jacques Villeneuve, who returned to driving a single-seater after almost a year of inactivity. The dismissal of the Italian driver was due to disagreements with team manager Flavio Briatore, who also dominated the Italian driver&#x27;s career and who the previous week had signed a contract with Toyota for 2005. This was the first race back for Ralf Schumacher after injuries in the 2004 United States Grand Prix three months prior. At Jordan, Timo Glock replaced Giorgio Pantano, who will give up participation in the last three Grand Prix races of the season without paying the last installment according to the contract.

The race was the first where radio conversations between teams and drivers were broadcast to television viewers.

=== Practice ===
The BAR of test driver Anthony Davidson takes to the track in friday free practice with a special yellow-blue livery, inspired by that of the Subaru Impreza 555 and which replaces the main seasonal sponsor Lucky Strike with State Express 555. The intention was to use it throughout the weekend. However, this was suspended by the federation so that for qualifying and the race, while retaining the temporary 555 sponsorship, the season&#x27;s canonical white livery was more or less restored.

=== Qualifying ===
Barrichello set the fastest lap and took pole position ahead of Räikkönen and Button. The Bridgestone tyres worked particularly well in this section and Sauber driver Massa managed to achieve the best starting position of his career up to that point with fourth place.

=== Race ===
After changing the engine during the night, Michael Schumacher started from the pit lane and started the race with a full tank. Barrichello maintained his lead at the start ahead of Räikkönen. Alonso took third place ahead of Massa and Button. The Briton regained position from the Sauber driver on the third lap after an intense duel. A lap later, Massa was also overtaken by Fisichella and Ralf Schumacher. Meanwhile, Michael Schumacher was struggling to get himself back together and was stuck in seventeenth behind the Toyota of Panis, which got off to a terrible start due to a launch control problem. On lap six, Button also overtook Alonso and moved up to third place, the BAR driver immediately setting the fastest lap of the race. After ten laps of the race, Massa opened the first series of pit stops. Shortly afterwards, Michael Schumacher touched Klien while trying to overtake the Austrian. While Michael Schumacher was able to continue driving, Klien&#x27;s race was over due to damaged suspension.

Barrichello and Räikkönen refuelled together on lap 12. The Brazilian kept the Finn behind him. Alonso and Button stayed on the track one and two laps longer respectively and retained fourth and third place. Further back in the field Michael Schumacher spun, losing further time. The German driver was the last to refuel on the 20th lap after overtaking both Fisichella and his brother.

At the head of the race, Barrichello struggled to contain Räikkönen; the Ferrari driver&#x27;s margin over the Finn remained firmly under one second. In third position followed, a little further behind, Button; However, the British driver started with a two-stop strategy, compared to his rivals&#x27; three. Alonso retained his fourth place, ahead of Ralf Schumacher, Fisichella and Coulthard. Räikkönen refuelled for the second time on lap 27; when Barrichello also made his second pit stop, two laps later, his advantage over the Finn increased. Button then took the lead, refuelling on lap 35. At the same moment, Michael Schumacher punctured a tyre, losing even more ground to the lead. Toyota driver Zonta retired with gearbox damage.

On lap 36, Räikkönen made his third and final pit stop, anticipating it in an attempt to overtake Barrichello; However, the Finn returned to the track behind Button, in third place. One lap later, Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher came into contact while fighting for seventh place; the Briton rammed the Williams driver and both were forced into the pits, Coulthard to replace a punctured tyre and Ralf Schumacher to carry out checks. However, the German driver returned to the pits just as his team was waiting for Montoya; Schumacher therefore lost two laps and, after carrying out a test lap, returned to the pits definitively. A little later, Minardi driver Bruni, who had lost a wheel, also retired.

Meanwhile, Barrichello pushed hard to increase his lead over Button as much as possible; when the Brazilian refuelled during the 42nd lap, the BAR driver remained behind him. In the final laps Barrichello managed his advantage over his pursuers, who approached the Ferrari driver but never seriously threatened him.

Barrichello then obtained his second consecutive victory, ahead of Button, Räikkönen, Alonso, Montoya, Sato, Fisichella and Massa; Villeneuve, returning after a year of inactivity, took only eleventh place, finishing ahead of Michael Schumacher. In the fight for second place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, BAR gained further points over Renault, having overtaken it in the standings in the previous Grand Prix.

<doc id="1021423" wikidata="Q62484" url="?curid=1021423" title="Broad Channel, Queens">
<text>Broad Channel is a neighborhood in the southern portion of the New York City borough of Queens. It occupies the southern portion of Rulers Bar Hassock (known colloquially as &quot;Broad Channel Island&quot;), the only inhabited island in Jamaica Bay.

The neighborhood stands on Big Egg Marsh, an area of fill approximately 20 blocks long and 4 blocks wide at the south end of Rulers Bar Hassock. The community is an inholding within the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, managed by the U.S. National Park Service as part of the Gateway National Recreation Area. The area comprises several artificial canals separating dead-end residential blocks. It is connected to the rest of Queens by road and subway bridges.

Broad Channel is located in Queens Community District 14 and its ZIP Code is 11693. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 100th Precinct.

==History==

=== Early settlement ===
Prior to European settlement, the Jameco and Canarsie bands of Lenape Native Americans frequented this area. During the 17th century, Dutch settlers established a community on the island and began harvesting oysters, clams, shrimp, and fish. The name &quot;Broad Channel&quot; itself originally referred to a channel in Jamaica Bay, within which the island is located.

Until the American Civil War, most of Jamaica Bay&#x27;s islands east of Bergen Island and Barren Island were not inhabited, including Broad Channel. The boundary line between the towns of Flatlands, Brooklyn, and Jamaica, Queens, ran through Jamaica Bay, cutting through Broad Channel, though the island was mostly part of Jamaica. After 1865, fisheries were developed in the bay, and by the late 1870s, the town of Jamaica indicated that structures had been built in the bay without the town&#x27;s permission.

The Long Island Rail Road built its Rockaway Beach Branch across the bay in 1880, cutting through Broad Channel. The presence of the railroad led to the development of fishing villages with shacks, summer homes, boathouses, and stores. As part of the project, some other islands in Jamaica Bay were removed or connected to others.

Broad Channel remained a parcel within the town of Jamaica until the City of Greater New York was created in 1898. The northern (and larger) portion of the island is part of Gateway National Recreation Area and is managed as part of the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, the only wildlife refuge managed the National Park Service. The waters and marsh islands of the refuge entirely surround the community.

===20th century===
In 1915, the city leased Broad Channel Island, Goose Creek Island, and Raunt Island to Pierre Noel, who subleased it to the Broad Channel Corporation. The 30-year lease specified payments of $16.57 per acre for the first three years and a maximum of $33.73 per acre for the last five years of the thirty-year term. The Broad Channel Corporation in turn made 10-year subleases to private individuals for the development of summer bungalows and houses.

There was public criticism of the lease after the public learned about the deal, which Pierre Noel, president of the Broad Channel Corporation, countered by pointing to $180,000 of improvements it had made, including digging a well to supply drinking water, building a power plant, adding landfill to reduce the need for houses on piles, and laying out streets on the island. Residents disputed the quality of these improvements, however, saying that the tap water was brown and not potable, that their houses had no electricity, and that there were no sewers on the island.

The Broad Channel Corporation responded by saying the water was of the same quality as was available in the Rockaways and that it planned to install a filtration device to remove the iron from the tap water. It said that the streets had electric lights, and it said installing sewers was not possible on the island.

For years, the only way to reach the island was by ferry or railroad, but in 1925, the North Channel Bridge opened, connecting the island to Howard Beach. The Cross Bay Parkway Bridge also opened in 1925 (replaced in 1939, and again in 1970), connecting to the Rockaways. The railroad trestle across Jamaica Bay experienced around 30 fires between 1942 and 1950. One such fire, between The Raunt and Broad Channel stations on May 7, 1950, cut service on the middle section of the railroad line. The LIRR, then bankrupt, could not afford to repair the trestle, and the city of New York purchased the line in 1952, and it reopened as the New York City Subway&#x27;s IND Rockaway Line in 1956.

Parks Commissioner Robert Moses announced his intention to build a park on the island in 1938; he planned recreation on the shore with a wildlife sanctuary on the north end of the island. The next year, the Broad Channel Corporation declared bankruptcy, and the city acquired the island&#x27;s property titles. In May 1944, Broad Channel&#x27;s 4,000 residents, collectively living in 1,260 homes, secured an injunction that would prevent the city from evicting them by April 30, 1948.

Later in 1944, the New York City Board of Estimate indicated that it would give residents the right to purchase the land under their houses. However, this right was denied for many years. The city made many attempts to alter the island&#x27;s purpose, but the local community resisted them all. Proposed changes included the construction of a commercial port and the extension of John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Rumors of high hepatitis rates spread in 1967 because of the island&#x27;s bad sewage system. At the time, several homes still dumped sewage into the bay, causing activities like clamming, wading, and swimming to be banned. The health hazards prompted the city to again attempt eviction proceedings against Broad Channel&#x27;s residents, which prompted them to protest, and the Board of Estimate ordered the residents&#x27; leases to be renewed the following year, despite the real estate commissioner&#x27;s protests. The government of New York City finally granted Broad Channel residents the right to purchase their property in 1982. The Joseph P. Addabbo Memorial Bridge replaced the dilapidated North Channel Bridge in 1993.

===21st century===
In 1998, Broad Channel&#x27;s Labor Day parade received negative media attention after video of a float that parodied the racially motivated dragging death of an African American man was made public. Three white participants on the float, all city emergency workers, were later fired from their jobs as a result of the parade incident. They sued the city for wrongful termination, and their claims were upheld in federal district court in 2003, but the firings were upheld upon appeal in 2006.

In August 2011, Broad Channel faced its first mandatory evacuation due to Hurricane Irene. In the aftermath, two homes on Church Road between East 12th and 14th Road collapsed into Jamaica Bay due to the high storm tide. In October 2012, Broad Channel faced another mandatory evacuation due to Hurricane Sandy. It sustained heavy damage with widespread flooding affecting most homes in the area, and in subsequent days, widespread prolonged power cuts and shortages of food and water were reported.

Press reports indicated that at least parts of the neighborhood were flooded from time to time by high tides. The city proposed steps such as raising the streets and sidewalks by three feet. The street raising and new sea walls, installation of which were ongoing , serve to stop street flooding. Broad Channel remains as one of the New York City neighborhoods most vulnerable to flooding, and had the highest proportion of repeated flood-related insurance claims .

== Demographics ==

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of the combined area of Breezy Point/Belle Harbor/Rockaway Park/Broad Channel was 28,018, an increase of 1,307 (4.9%) from the 26,711 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the four neighborhoods had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhoods was 78.3% (21,946) White, 7.5% (2,095) African American, 2.1% (595) Asian, 0% (29) Native American, 0.0% (8) Pacific Islander, 0.2% (66) from other races, and 0.9% (259) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.8% (3,020) of the population.

The number of residents in Broad Channel itself is much lower: according to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article from 2010, there were roughly 3,000 residents on the island. A 2014 &quot;New York Times&quot; article said that many of Broad Channel&#x27;s several thousand residents were civil servants or emergency workers. In 2015, according to the Census Bureau&#x27;s Opportunity Atlas, about 47% of 34-to-40-year-old adults who grew up in Broad Channel still resided in the neighborhood, compared to 20% of adults in that age range citywide who grew up near their childhood homes. This was among the highest resident retention rates of any neighborhood in the city.

==Transportation==
===Public transportation===

The New York City Subway&#x27;s IND Rockaway Line () has a subway station in Broad Channel. The Select Bus Service routes and express buses along Cross Bay Boulevard also serve Broad Channel.

===Street grid===
From the 1950s to the 1970s, some mapmakers have shown the streets of Broad Channel as being part of the street naming system found in the rest of Queens besides the Rockaways, with the numbers of &quot;Streets&quot; increasing from west to east, the numbers of &quot;Avenues&quot; increasing from north to south, etc. However, Broad Channel streets have always had their own numbering format, including &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot; (in relation to Cross Bay Boulevard), as well as named &quot;Roads&quot; numbered north to south; this street naming system is independent of those used elsewhere in the borough. The directional prefixes ensured no duplication with any other &quot;Road&quot; in Queens. There are no numerical north-south or even any named &quot;Streets&quot; in Broad Channel.

===Bridges===

Broad Channel is connected to the rest of Queens via four bridges: the tolled, vehicular Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge to the south; the free, vehicular Joseph P. Addabbo Memorial Bridge to the north; and the two IND Rockaway Line swing bridges. Cross Bay Boulevard, the island&#x27;s only through road, traverses the two vehicular bridges, both of which also carry bicycle and pedestrian traffic. Lying between Howard Beach and the Rockaway Peninsula, it is connected to those communities by these bridges, at either end of the island.

Following the construction of the Cross Bay Parkway bridge in 1939, a drawbridge connecting Broad Channel with the Rockaway Peninsula (which replaced the original, narrow, 1925 drawbridge), the island became easily accessible by car. However, the drawbridge opened up many times per day, and whenever it opened, traffic would back up to Howard Beach, as well as on the Rockaway Peninsula.

In the mid-to-late 1960s, a new bridge was constructed. It opened on May 28, 1970. It was renamed the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge in 1977. It is maintained by MTA Bridges and Tunnels, and a $3.75 toll ($2 with E-ZPass) must be paid to use the bridge.

The Joseph P. Addabbo Memorial Bridge connects Broad Channel to Howard Beach and the mainland. Opening in 1993, it was formerly known as the North Channel Bridge. It replaced an older North Channel Bridge built in 1925, which was deteriorated to the point where it was beyond repair. It is maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation, and is free.

==Education==
===Schools===


Broad Channel is served by the New York City Department of Education. Elementary school students attend PS 47, which serves pre-K through eighth grades; the school facilities were completely remodeled during the 1990s. In the 2023-2024 school year, after 2 years of construction, PS 47 reopened in a new building.

Broad Channel was also home to St. Virgilius School, a Roman Catholic School that was part of the Diocese of Brooklyn. However, after a lengthy battle between parents and the Diocese, St. Virgilius School closed in 2006. Two years later, upon the retirement of its administrator, Rev. John P. Maloney, St. Virgilius Parish of Broad Channel merged with St. Camillus Parish of Rockaway Park.

===Library===

The Queens Public Library&#x27;s Broad Channel branch is located at 16-26 Cross Bay Boulevard.

==Organizations==

===Broad Channel Athletic Club===

The non-profit Broad Channel Athletic Club was established in 1961. The baseball teams are registered with Little League and host an in-house baseball league, and participate in the Catholic Youth Organization. The football league plays in the Nassau and Suffolk Football League. The soccer league is completely run by the organization and participates in the Catholic Youth Organization. The swimming team participates in the Police Athletic League of New York City and the Catholic Youth Organization. The basketball league also participates in the Catholic Youth Organization.

=== Broad Channel Historical Society ===
The Broad Channel Historical Society was established in 1994 by the Civic Association&#x27;s then-president Danny Mundy after he read the local &quot;Channel News&quot; newsletter&#x27;s &quot;Glimpse of the Past&quot; column. Ada L. Smith, the New York State Senator representing the district, distributed funds, which the society used to purchase notebooks to record the community&#x27;s history. Since June 1995, the society has held Annual Historical Day every year so visitors could look at the collection in the Broad Channel Library.

The Broad Channel Library has been the home for the historical collection. The collection was microfilmed in 1997. The microfilm is available for viewing at the Central Branch in Jamaica, Queens. Also in 1997 the first annual Historical Calendar was published. The calendars feature old pictures of Broad Channel and tidal information.

=== Broad Channel Volunteer Fire Department ===

The department originally started in 1905 as bucket brigade to help minimize property loss due to fires. In 1907, this brigade was formally organized into the Broad Channel Volunteer Fire Association under its first Chief, Edward H. Schleuter. The current firehouse at 15 Noel Road was opened in the summer of 1908. In 1913, Chief Chris Hoobs died of a heart attack responding to a fire. The association received their fire charter from the state of New York in 1917 and were known from then on as the Broad Channel Volunteers.

In 1956, then-Deputy Chief Robert H. Russell Sr. added volunteer ambulance services to provide first aid and ambulatory care to the residents of Broad Channel. He would also go on to be elected to the rank of Chief of Department twenty-one times from 1957 to 1973, 1975–1977, and again in 1984. By the early 1960s, the department was growing rapidly in both stature in the community and as an organization as a whole.

On summer weekends during the 1950s and 1960s, the FDNY would send a spare engine and a crew detailed from other firehouses, known as Engine Company No. 341, to the Broad Channel Volunteers&#x27; quarters to assist in answering alarms on the island. The bridges at the northern and southern ends of the island were draw bridges and were frequently opened for large passing ships. The southern bridge was particularly active due to the numerous tankers carrying fuel to nearby Idlewild Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport).

On average it took from 30 to 45 minutes from the lowering of the traffic barriers, the opening and closing of the lift bridge, and the raising of the traffic barriers before traffic could again move. Occasionally, the bridge would get stuck in the open position effectively closing Cross Bay Boulevard for extended periods. This would impede responses by FDNY apparatus, EMS &amp; NYPD companies to the island for any type of emergency.

Also, Cross Bay Boulevard, then 4 lanes in each direction, would be jammed by beach goers and those looking to vacation at Rockaway&#x27;s bungalows and hotels and its famous Rockaway Playland. Often the FDNY firefighters would leave their apparatus parked on the Boulevard and join the volunteers on their apparatus because they were smaller than the FDNY apparatus and could maneuver down the very narrow streets.

Over the years, the Broad Channel Volunteers have been in service, they have created a close working relationship with the local FDNY companies as well as the volunteer companies from Nassau &amp; Suffolk Counties. The Broad Channel Volunteers are also dues paying members of many organizations such as the Southern New York Volunteer Firemans Association, the Firemans Association of the State of New York, and along with the 8 other volunteer fire departments in the 5 boroughs of New York City, they are members of Volunteer Firemans Association of the City of New York.

In the late 1970s, The Broad Channel Junior Fire Department was organized to help train young teens in the aspects of the fire and EMS service as well as dispatching and clerical duties while still cleaning the firehouse and its apparatus. When its members turned 18, they were allowed to begin riding the apparatus as firefighters or start training as EMTs. The benefit was these teens were already knowledgeable in the operations of the department and it became a breeding ground for the departments future firefighters, officers and chiefs. They would later become a Boy Scout Explorer Post, #3069.

In 1994, under Chief Dan McIntyre, the volunteer ambulance corps was granted their New York State Certification. Since then, the department took the initiative to require all its firefighters to be New York State Certified in all aspects of the fire service as well as EMS. In 1994, Chief Dan McIntyre also started the departments Marine Company which is still in service to present day. The department operates a small Coast Guard-like Zodiac as a swift water rescue team with certified EMTs on board and in some instances certified divers as well.

In 2012, as a result of Hurricane Sandy, the fire department lost many resources, including both of its fire trucks and both of its ambulances. Therefore, a replacement fire truck from Chanhassen, Minnesota, was loaned to the Broad Channel Volunteer Fire Department. In addition, neighboring Minnesota towns sent resources, including extra boots and helmets from Victoria and Carver; four air monitors, one Jaws of Life apparatus, and two power generators from Chaska; and a truck with resources worth about $20,000 from the Sioux community there.

The Broad Channel Volunteers, Inc., is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization that relies solely on door to door fundraising, grants from politicians and from the state, and since 1905 has been operated by 100% volunteers.

==Parks==

===Sunset Cove Park===
Opened on August 21, 2019, Sunset Cove Park is located on of land that was formerly occupied by a marina. In the process, some of debris and of polluted soil was removed, and a salt marsh and upland area was restored. Furthermore, a walkway and shoreline berm were constructed and of sand were imported to the site. A future construction phase, which will commence in 2021, will include an oyster garden, a dock, and a boardwalk to reach the salt marsh.

===Broad Channel American Park===
Broad Channel American Park opened in May 1995, located at the southernmost end of Broad Channel, sits along Jamaica Bay. The park features two grass baseball fields, one asphalt baseball field, benches, water fountains, a parking area, four basketball standards, and a small play area. The flagpole area is surrounded by a nautically themed sitting area. The park was given its present name in March 1998.

===Broad Channel Park===
Broad Channel Park, also known as 17th Road Playground, is located on Cross Bay Boulevard and stretches between 16th and 18th Roads. This park includes a hockey rink, basketball courts, handball courts, playgrounds, and tennis courts.

===Gene Gray Playground===
Gene Gray Playground, at Cross Bay Boulevard and East 9th Road, is named for Eugene Gray (1927–1973), a community activist who supported the construction of the island&#x27;s first adventure playground prior to his death. In 1987, the Broad Channel Civic Association and Queens Community Board 14 successfully petitioned to rename the playground after Gray. The playground, which cost $457,688, opened on November 12, 1987, to designs by Richard Dattner. The wooden play structures in the playground was themed to a nautical fortress, with a bridge designed to look like a sailing ship. There is also a 75-year-old willow tree, nine red maple trees, and ninety burning bushes surrounding the playground.

<text>Lucy&#x27;s warbler (Leiothlypis luciae) is a small New World warbler found in North America. This species ranges includes southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is one of only two warblers to nest in cavities.

==Description==
Lucy&#x27;s warbler is the smallest species of New World warbler. It measures from in length and can weigh from , thus being slightly smaller even than the warblers formerly placed in the genus &quot;Parula&quot;. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is .

It is rather nondescript compared to other wood-warblers, being perhaps the palest species in its family. Its head and upperparts are pale gray, while underparts are whitish. It has a white eyering and a small, pointed bill. Both sexes have a rufous rump, a diagnostic field mark. Adult males also have a small rusty patch on their crown. Juveniles are paler, with a tawny rump and buffy wingbars.

Lucy&#x27;s warbler is closely related to Virginia&#x27;s warbler, Nashville warbler and Colima warbler. The common name and binomial of this species commemorate Lucy Hunter Baird, daughter of ornithologist Spencer Fullerton Baird.

Lucy&#x27;s warblers inhabit riparian mesquite and brushy country of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It can nest in the driest vegetated stretches of the Sonora Desert and nest in possibly the driest habitats of any New World warbler.

==Life history==
Lucy&#x27;s is the only warbler besides prothonotary to nest in cavities. It uses natural cavities in cactus or trees or holes excavated by woodpeckers or verdin in prior years. Unlike the prothonotary, Lucy&#x27;s warbler has been known to utilize man-made nest boxes, even using a hollowed-out gourd. If using a woodpecker hole, the warbler may fill the cavity nearly to the top with debris and put the nest on top so the small birds can see outside of it. This species nests in some of the densest aggregations of any warbler, with as many as 12 pairs per ha (5 pairs per acre). The birds migrate to western Mexico in winter.

These strictly insectivorous birds forage actively, looking for the caterpillars, beetles, and leafhoppers that compose much of their diet. When they capture a caterpillar, they shake it vigorously and skin off the prickly hairs on the back before consumption.

Habitat loss is the main threat to this species, with riparian habitats in its range being developed extensively. To a lesser extent, brown-headed cowbird parasitism is also threatening this species. Populations are diminishing throughout its breeding range.

<text>The Singapore Self-Propelled Howitzer 1 (SSPH 1) Primus is a self-propelled howitzer armed with a 155 mm howitzer. Developed jointly by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and Singapore Technologies Kinetics (ST Kinetics), it was officially inducted to the Singapore Artillery in 2004. &quot;Primus&quot; is derived from the Artillery motto &quot;In Oriente Primus&quot; (Latin: &quot;First in the East&quot;).

At the time of introduction in 2002, SSPH Primus was recognized as the world&#x27;s lightest 155mm, 39 calibre tracked howitzer of its kind.

==Production history and development==
The idea for a self-propelled howitzer within the SAF was developed in the early 1990s, with the aim of providing better fire support to the armour brigades in the Combined Arms Divisions. This new weapon system would require the ability to keep pace with the high tempo of armoured operations, while providing the range, firepower and accuracy that the artillery is renowned for. The 155 mm self-propelled howitzer was seen as the obvious choice.

The decision to develop the Primus was made after a market survey in 1995 and 1996 of some of the world&#x27;s best self-propelled guns from the United States (M109 Paladin), United Kingdom (AS90 Braveheart), Japan (Type 75) and Russia (2S3M1) found them either too heavy or too wide for local terrain.

Leveraging its experience with designing, developing and producing various towed artillery systems (the FH-88 and FH-2000) for the SAF, ST Kinetics, together with DSTA began the development of the Primus in earnest in 1996.

By April 2000, the first working prototype was rolled out, using a vehicle chassis adapted from a United Defense armoured chassis (the &quot;Universal Combat Vehicle Platform&quot;; UCVP) which includes components from the US M109 Paladin howitzer, M2 Bradley IFV &amp; M8-AGS. The next 2 years saw the system undergoing a series of comprehensive tests to ensure that the Primus was able to withstand the rigors required of it. As land in Singapore is scarce, firing tests were first done at the Waiouru Army Camp live-firing range in New Zealand as part of Exercise Thunder Warrior in February 2004. The guns have also participated in Exercise Wallaby at the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Queensland, Australia.

In September 2002, the Primus was officially certified to have met the SAF&#x27;s criteria, and was formally adopted in the SAF. Since then, this Artillery platform is utilised by the 21st Battalion Singapore Artillery as their primary weapon system for training and operation purposes.

==Design==
The chassis is based on the proven United States M109 155 mm self-propelled howitzer. This has been upgraded in a number of key areas and has a new power pack similar to that fitted to ST Kinetics Bionix infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), which is already in SAF service. The use of common subsystems for the Primus and Bionix IFV offers several advantages, including easier training and reduced logistics.

The power pack of the Primus consists of a Detroit Diesel Corporation 6V 92TIA diesel engine developing 550 horsepower coupled to a General Dynamics Land Systems HMPT-500-3EC fully automatic transmission.

The maximum road speed of the Primus is , with an operating range of . Its combat weight of {{28.3 tons allows it to use the SAF&#x27;s military bridging systems. The relatively light combat weight also allowed the flexibility of being air-portable by an Airbus A400M Transport aircraft.

The turret is fitted with a locally developed 155 mm 39-calibre barrel with a muzzle brake and fume extractor. This meets the NATO Joint Ballistics Memorandum of Understanding. The range of the Primus&#x27; gun depends on the type of projectile and charge combination used, and is about {{Convert|19|km|mi}} with the old M107 high explosive (HE) projectile and {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} with an extended range full bore base bleed projectile. In addition to smoke, HE and illumination projectiles, the locally developed 155 mm cargo round can also be fired.

A semi-automatic loading system is provided to increase the rate of fire and reduce crew fatigue. The fused projectiles are loaded and rammed automatically; the modular charges are loaded manually. The Primus has a burst rate of fire of three rounds in 20 seconds and a maximum rate of fire of 6 rounds per min. The bustle mounted magazine holds up to 22 rounds of 155 mm projectile.

The digital fire control system automates the complete projectile loading process and gun laying operation. An ammunition inventory management system keeps track of all onboard ammunition as well as ammunition expenditure during firing. The weapon is laid to the target using an automatic fire control system, which includes an onboard positioning and navigation system. This can receive target information from the battery or regimental command post. It takes less than 60 seconds to come into action and open fire and 40 seconds to be re-deployed.

== Incidents ==
===2019 Accident===
On 19 January 2019, Singapore Army NSman Corporal First Class (CFC (NS)) and Mediacorp Actor, Aloysius Pang was killed after he was crushed by the gun barrel of a Primus while performing maintenance inside the vehicle during his overseas reservist training in New Zealand.

==Misconception==
The Primus has been mistaken as artillery being mounted on a Bionix chassis, and in the earlier days of development as a Bionix MBT variant. This was brought about by the fact that the UCVP (which the Primus was based on) bears a superficial resemblance to that of the Bionix and the fact that ST Engineering had indeed at the time been experimenting on a light tank variant of the Bionix. {{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

<text>Man O Man (spelled as Mann-o-Mann) was a game show created in Germany, originally airing on Sat.1 from 1992 until 1995 produced by Reg Grundy and hosted by Peer Augustinski. The show was loosely in the format of a beauty pageant but with male contestants. An all-female audience voted for the winner via a series of elimination rounds. Losing contestants would be pushed into a swimming pool.

==Format==
The male contestants would compete in a number of rounds where characteristics a woman may seek in a romantic partner - such as general knowledge, romantic aptitude, conversation skills and sense of humour - would be tested.

At the end of each round, members of the entirely female audience each voted for their favourite man using a remote control device and the least popular male would be eliminated from the competition by being pushed into the swimming pool that formed part of the show&#x27;s set by one of the show&#x27;s hostesses.

At the beginning of each episode, the ten male contestants would come out on the stage and introduce themselves to the audience, and from these first impressions the audience would eliminate the 3 least popular guys.

The 7 that were left then progressed to the next round, which is a true or false game and saw the guys to see how much they know about women.

The next 2 rounds would have the final 5 doing a fairground hammer bell and then performing various songs for karaoke.

The final 3 surviving guys go through to the final 2 round, which were to answer the girls questions and how much can they cope under pressure.

After this, the audience voted for the winner, with the two runner-up contestants being pushed into the pool simultaneously.

==Merchandise==
A board game based on the show was released by Schmidt Spiele in 1994.

<text>Lee James Jude Capallero (born April 10, 1950), also known as Lee Ving, is an American guitarist, singer, and actor. 
Ving is the frontman of the Los Angeles-based hardcore punk band Fear. As an actor, Ving played topless club owner Johnny C. in &quot;Flashdance&quot; (1983), motorcycle gang leader Greer in &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; (1984) and murder victim Mr. Boddy in the murder mystery film &quot;Clue&quot; (1985).
He also played the Installer in the movie Wild Life The Wild Life (film) with Christopher Penn

==Early life==
Ving was born Lee James Jude Capallero in Philadelphia and grew up in the city&#x27;s Kensington neighborhood. The Capallero family later moved to the suburbs and Ving attended St. Luke&#x27;s Elementary School in Glenside as well as St. John of the Cross in Roslyn, before graduating from Abington Senior High School.

Ving&#x27;s mother taught him to play the mandolin at four years of age. He began studying guitar at age eleven and later studied with musicians Jim Hall and John Abercrombie. He also studied with Ted Greene after moving to Los Angeles. As a teen he listened to blues records and particularly enjoyed their striking guitar sounds. He was also interested in Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones, as well as the experimental New York rock group The Fugs. He joined his first band while still in high school.

In 1966 Ving enlisted in the army and served stateside during the Vietnam War.

==Music career==
After leaving the army, Ving became involved in Philadelphia&#x27;s folk, blues and R&amp;B music scenes while studying Sociology at Villanova University. He joined the electric blues band Sweet Stavin Chain (SSC) as a vocalist and harmonica player. SSC frequently collaborated with jazz saxophonist Michael Brecker. The band also opened for The Who at the Electric Factory in 1968 and also opened for Cream at the Spectrum during Cream&#x27;s farewell tour later that same year. After leaving SSC, Ving moved to New York and studied voice and guitar. In the mid-1970s he moved to Los Angeles, playing briefly with heavy metal bands before forming the hardcore punk band Fear. The band&#x27;s first concert was in 1978.

Ving is Fear&#x27;s lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist and harmonica player and is the only member to have remained with the band since its inception. During Fear&#x27;s performances at the L.A. punk scene, Ving was known for baiting his audience with insults, earning him the nickname &quot;the Don Rickles of rock.&quot; Ving&#x27;s vocals have been described as &quot;bluesy&quot;, evoking Howlin&#x27; Wolf and Muddy Waters, while also having a &quot;commanding, drill-sergeant vocal delivery and surly attitude helped to build a new breed of bad-tempered hardcore&quot; and &quot;a vein-busting rage that lends [Ving] the air of a loco Marine on a rampage.&quot;

1981 marked an important year for Ving and Fear. The band was featured in the documentary &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot; about Los Angeles&#x27;s punk scene. Ving was initially approached by the film&#x27;s director, Penelope Spheeris, while he was posting concert promo flyers to telephone poles in Los Angeles. Spheeris also introduced Fear to her husband Bob Biggs, the founder and then president of Slash Records, who signed the group to his label; Fear released their debut album &quot;The Record&quot; with the label in 1982.

Fear also appeared on the 1981 Halloween episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) at the suggestion of &quot;SNL&quot; writer Michael O&#x27;Donoghue and then ex-&quot;SNL&quot; cast-member John Belushi. Belushi became a fan of Fear after seeing them perform in 1980 on the L.A.-based music television show &quot;New Wave Theatre&quot;; O&#x27;Donoghue had seen the band in &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;. Belushi had initially commissioned the band to record a song for his film &quot;Neighbors&quot;, but the movie studio rejected the recording and it never made the soundtrack. As a favor to Fear, Belushi and O&#x27;Donoghue made a deal with then producer Dick Ebersol whereby Belushi would make a cameo appearance on the show upon condition that Fear be allowed to perform as the episode&#x27;s musical guests. A large portion of the crowd were punk music fans and included members of the bands Minor Threat, Cro-Mags, The Meatmen, Negative Approach as well as Jesse Malin who rushed the stage and were moshing. One of the slam dancers, Ian MacKaye, yelled &quot;New York Sucks!&quot; which was broadcast live. Dick Ebersol, who was stage manager at the time, decided to cut to tape once the obscenities could be heard.

Fear&#x27;s performance was initially pulled from subsequent &quot;SNL&quot; reruns and recorded releases of the episode, but has subsequently been released in an edited form. The &quot;New York Post&quot; had initially reported that attendees of the performance caused $200,000 worth of damage, however both the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; later reported that a program spokesperson confirmed the cost of damages was actually a $40 fine for &quot;labor penalties.&quot; Both &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot; and the Halloween &quot;SNL&quot; performance were an integral part of the history of hardcore punk, having exposed the music genre to a much wider audience.

Ving&#x27;s vocals and harmonica playing were featured on the track &quot;Got to Get Out of New York&quot; from saxophonist Tom Scott&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Target&quot;. Fear found it difficult to find clubs willing to let them perform after their &quot;SNL&quot; performance and the band stopped playing in 1987. That same year Ving formed a country band called Range War that toured California and Texas. Two years later Ving moved with his wife and son to Austin.

Fear re-formed briefly under the band&#x27;s original lineup in 1993. A couple of years later, Ving fronted an Austin-based band called Lee Ving&#x27;s Army that later toured under the name Fear and included former Frank Zappa bassist Scott Thunes, drummer Andrew Jaimez and guitarist Sean Cruse.

Ving was also the vocalist for the band MD.45, which also featured Dave Mustaine of Megadeth. The band released their only album &quot;The Craving&quot; in 1996, however in 2004 the album was remastered and re-released with Mustaine&#x27;s vocals replacing those of Ving.

Ving appeared in Dave Grohl&#x27;s 2013 documentary &quot;Sound City&quot; and is a member of the supergroup Teenage Time Killers that came about due to the film. In 2015 Fear&#x27;s recordings from the Belushi film &quot;Neighbors&quot; were recovered by Belushi&#x27;s widow and Fear&#x27;s music was re-mastered and re-mixed by Ving at Grohl&#x27;s 606 studios in Los Angeles. Ving released the music digitally that same year. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; about &quot;Sound City&quot;, Grohl stated that Fear&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot; inspired him to become a musician and that performing with Ving 30 years later was a &quot;profound, life-altering moment.&quot;

==Acting career==
Ving (credited as Lee James Jude) and the other members of Fear appeared in the 1981 rotoscope animated film &quot;American Pop&quot;, directed by Ralph Bakshi.

In 1983, Ving appeared in several film roles. He played a murderer in the horror anthology film &quot;Nightmares&quot; starring Emilio Estevez. He appeared in &quot;Flashdance&quot; as the owner of a topless club who tries to convince Jennifer Beals&#x27; character to work for him. He played the over-the-top punk singer named &#x27;Piggy&#x27; in the rock-and-roll comedy &quot;Get Crazy&quot;.

A year later, Ving played Greer, the henchman of Willem Dafoe&#x27;s character in the neo-noir rock musical film &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; and also appeared as a criminal in a police lineup in an episode of the short-lived &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; spin-off &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;.

In 1985, he played Mr. Boddy in the film &quot;Clue&quot;, based on the board game of the same name. While the film was unsuccessful in theaters on its first run, it later became a cult classic and it is often the role for which Ving is now most recognized.

In 1987 Ving appeared in the &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss&quot; episode titled &quot;Walk on the Mild Side&quot;. Ving played Jake McGuire, a motorcyclist bad boy who Angela dates while fulfilling a list of wild things she wanted to do while in high school. Ving&#x27;s country band Range War also performed two songs during the episode. Also in 1987, Ving reunited with director Penelope Spheeris for her film &quot;Dudes&quot;. Ving was cast as the main antagonist, a gang leader who murders one of the protagonists, Milo, portrayed by Flea, bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers. The plot revolves around the murder victim&#x27;s friends looking to bring Ving&#x27;s character to justice.

Ving appeared in a cameo role in the 2009 National Lampoon comedy &quot;Endless Bummer&quot;. He was also cast as a bartender in &quot;Death Rider in the House of Vampires&quot;, a Spaghetti Western horror film directed by Glenn Danzig released in 2021.

<text>Duane Eugene Kuiper (born June 19, 1950), nicknamed &quot;Kuip&quot;, is an American sportscaster and former professional baseball player. As a player, he was a second baseman for the Cleveland Indians and San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB). Save for one year, Kuiper has been a television and radio broadcaster for the Giants since 1986, and is one half of the popular &quot;Kruk and Kuip&quot; duo alongside his friend and former teammate Mike Krukow. He briefly left the Giants in 1993 to work for the expansion Colorado Rockies, but returned in 1994.

==Early life==
Duane Eugene Kuiper was born on June 19, 1950, in Racine, Wisconsin. Kuiper, his two brothers, and one sister, grew up on a farm in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, near Racine. He played baseball at Jerome I. Case High School in Racine, Wisconsin. He is the older brother of former sports broadcaster, Glen Kuiper.

==College career==
Kuiper is a graduate of Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. His roommate was Dan Radison, a long-time minor and major league coach.

==Professional career==
===Drafts and minor leagues===
Kuiper was drafted by the New York Yankees out of Jerome I. Case High School in the twelfth round of the 1968 Major League Baseball Draft, but chose instead to attend Indian Hills Community College. He was drafted by the Seattle Pilots, Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds while attending Indian Hills, but did not sign with any of these clubs. After a season at Southern Illinois University, he was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the fourth round of the 1971 June Secondary Amateur Draft, but again did not sign. It wasn&#x27;t until graduating from Southern Illinois that Kuiper finally said yes to the Cleveland Indians, who drafted him in the first round of the 1972 January Secondary Amateur Draft.

Kuiper spent three seasons in the Indians&#x27; farm system, batting .295 with six home runs and 148 runs batted in (RBIs) before receiving a September call-up in .

===Cleveland Indians (1974–1981)===
Kuiper made his major league debut on September 9 as a late inning defensive replacement for Jack Brohamer, and grounded into a double play in his only at-bat. However, he fared far better in his remaining plate appearances that season, collecting nine singles, two doubles, two walks and four RBIs in 24 plate appearances.

Though Kuiper spent time with the triple-A Oklahoma City 89ers in , he spent most of the season in the majors, splitting time with Brohamer at second base, and batting second in manager Frank Robinson&#x27;s batting order. Following the season, the Indians dealt Brohamer to the White Sox, clearing a spot for Kuiper to play every day.

Primarily a slap hitter, Kuiper maintained a decent batting average (lifetime .271) while proving to be an above average defender, leading American League second basemen in fielding percentage in and . He hit his only career home run against Chicago White Sox pitcher Steve Stone on August 29, . Kuiper holds the MLB record for most career at-bats with only one home run. In interviews for a video, &quot;Super Duper Baseball Bloopers&quot;, Stone claimed that he wasn&#x27;t properly warmed up for the game, with only seven minutes to warm up, because his manager didn&#x27;t know the game was starting 12 minutes earlier than expected. Kuiper&#x27;s counter-argument was, &quot;Steve would like to tell you he wasn&#x27;t loose. Well, he was loose enough to strike out the first batter of the game.&quot; Kuiper holds the major league record for most career at-bats with exactly one home run in the live-ball era. Since the game in question was on national television, Kuiper&#x27;s singular feat was captured on video. (Giants telecasts, for which Kuiper is currently an announcer, will run the highlight from time to time to poke fun at him. On April 25, 2014, the Giants held &quot;Duane Kuiper Home Run Bobblehead Night&quot; for their game against the Indians.)

On May 30, , Kuiper scored the only run for either team in Dennis Eckersley&#x27;s no-hitter against the California Angels.

On July 27, , playing against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium, Kuiper hit two bases-loaded triples. He is one of only three Major League players to accomplish this feat, the other two players being Elmer Valo (1949) and Bill Bruton (1959).

On May 15, , Len Barker pitched a perfect game against the Toronto Blue Jays with Kuiper at second base. Kuiper fielded five ground balls to contribute to the effort. Shortly after Kuiper suffered a knee injury that caused him to miss most of the season, the Indians acquired Alan Bannister from the White Sox. The two platooned at second in . He batted .257 with 14 RBI that season.

===San Francisco Giants (1982–1985)===

Kuiper was dealt from the Indians to the San Francisco Giants for pitcher Ed Whitson on November 15, 1981. He backed up Hall of famer Joe Morgan his first season in San Francisco, and batted .255 in three-plus seasons platooning at second for the Giants before being released by the club on June 28, . Kuiper and future broadcast partner Mike Krukow were both on the Giants from 1983 to 1985, where they formed their friendship.

==Broadcasting career==
Kuiper&#x27;s broadcasting career began while still a player, hosting his own KNBR radio show from 1982 to 1985. After retiring from playing baseball, Kuiper provided commentary for the Giants from 1986 to 1992. With uncertainty over whether the Giants would move to Florida for the 1993 season, Kuiper left for a one-year stint with the expansion Colorado Rockies. Kuiper returned to broadcast for the Giants in 1994, where he has remained since.

Kuiper&#x27;s call of Bonds&#x27; 715th home run to pass Babe Ruth is considered the historic call for that home run, as radio announcer Dave Flemming&#x27;s microphone cut out at the exact moment the ball was hit. Kuiper made the TV call for Barry Bonds&#x27; historic 756th home run which broke Hank Aaron&#x27;s record (although the historic call is that of KNBR radio announcer Jon Miller).

On November 1, 2010, Kuiper made the historic call for the final out of Game 5 of the 2010 World Series that resulted in the Giants&#x27; first title since . On June 13, 2012, Kuiper called Matt Cain&#x27;s perfect game.

While principally a television play-by-play announcer on NBC Sports Bay Area, Kuiper also shares radio play-by-play duties with Dave Flemming on KNBR when the Giants television broadcast is carried over-the-air on KNTV and Jon Miller handles the television play-by-play. He also fills in on the radio side when Flemming is unable to announce games due to his second job as an ESPN college football and basketball announcer. During Giants post-season play, Kuiper and broadcast partner Mike Krukow move over to the radio side and call games with Miller and Flemming while the television broadcasts are handled by network sportscasters.

Kruk and Kuip can be heard in the Electronic Arts video games &quot;MVP Baseball 2003&quot;, &quot;MVP Baseball 2004&quot;, and &quot;MVP Baseball 2005&quot;. In December 2010, both Kuiper and Krukow signed six-year extensions to continue as Giants announcers.

Kuiper missed calling much of the 2021 season after a cancer diagnosis that required chemotherapy, but he returned to a limited schedule—all home games and 20 road games, called remotely from San Francisco—in the 2022 season.

===Commentating style===

According to an Aug. 21, 2019 story in Sports Broadcast Journal, Kuiper uses a deep baritone voice when a player swings and misses, when a dramatic play is made, and when he calls home runs.

Kuiper is noted for his distinctive calls beginning and ending each game: after the result of the first batter of the game, he says, &quot;And that&#x27;s how this game gets started&quot;; when the ball game is over, Kuiper says, &quot;And that&#x27;s the ball game!&quot;

When Kuiper states the pitch count on a batter, he often calls &quot;nothing&quot; in lieu of calling &quot;a ball&quot; and the current number of strikes when the count is &quot;no balls&quot;. Kuiper often uses the phrase &quot;Got &#x27;em!&quot; when an out is recorded.

His trademark home run call is &quot;He hits it high... hits it deep... it is (or this baby is) OUTTA HERE!&quot; or &quot;HIGH DRIVE... LEFT (or RIGHT) FIELD... IT IS (sometimes: THIS BABY IS) OUTTA HERE!&quot; Another popular home run saying, &quot;THAT ONE&#x27;S HIGH, AND DEEP, AND... GONE! A HOME RUN!&quot;

In April 2010, Kuiper coined a new slogan from a fan&#x27;s sign for the SF Giants club: &quot;Giants baseball... torture!&quot; This slogan is used generally if the games are either tense, tight, or very close, in which the Giants have later won by a small margin.

==Personal life==
Kuiper lives in Danville, California. He was married to Michelle Kuiper for 36 years before she died on February 20, 2022. Together, they had two children: a son, Cole, who is married to Rachel Jensen Kuiper, and a daughter, Dannon, who is married to Zack Rease. Kuiper has two granddaughters: Andy (born 2019) and Kit (born 2021).

Kuiper is just one in a family of baseball broadcasters, all working in the San Francisco Bay Area. His younger brother, Glen Kuiper, was the play-by-play announcer for the Oakland Athletics from 2006 to 2023, a job mirroring his older brother&#x27;s a few miles across the bay. Their middle brother, Jeff, is a television producer for the Giants who produces Duane&#x27;s broadcasts.

For many years, Kuiper would visit his family&#x27;s farm in Sturtevant, Wisconsin whenever the Giants played the Brewers in Milwaukee. The farm continued to be owned by his father, Henry Kuiper, until the elder Kuiper sold it in 2018 so that the land could be redeveloped into a hospital complex. Henry Kuiper died in 2019 at age 95.

<doc id="1021444" wikidata="Q2823372" url="?curid=1021444" title="Stinson L-13">
<text>The Stinson L-13 (sometimes known as the Grasshopper, like other aircraft of its type) is a US military utility aircraft first flown in 1945. 

==Development==
The aircraft design was developed at Stinson in response to a request from the United States Army Air Force for a light observation/liaison aircraft. At that time Stinson was a subsidiary of Consolidated-Vultee. The first two prototypes were constructed at the Stinson facility in Michigan. In 1948 the Convair board were restructuring their various units, and negotiated to sell the Stinson subsidiary to Piper Aircraft. The L-13 project was specifically not included in the assets of the sale, however, and Convair continued its production in-house; ultimately building 300 units as the Convair L-13.

It was a conventional high-wing tailwheel monoplane used for observation, liaison, and air ambulance duties, which typically require low landing speeds and short landing rolls. It was fitted with a large &quot;greenhouse&quot; to enhance its observation role.

Following their military service and resale into the private market, some units were converted for civil bush flying use, fitting a radial engine by Acme Aircraft Company as the Centaur, while others underwent similar conversions by Caribbean Traders Inc, as the Husky.

==Variants==
;XL-13
:Prototype aircraft, powered by 245 hp (183 kW) Franklin O-425-6 engine. Two built.
;L-13A
:Production aircraft, powered by 250 hp (187 kW) O-425-9 engine. 300 built.
;L-13B
:Conversion of L-13A for cold weather operation, capable of operating from wheels, skis or floats. 28 converted.
;Acme Centaur 101
:Conversion of L-13 as six-seat bush aircraft. Powered by 300 hp (224 kW) Lycoming R-680-E3. 
;Acme Centaur 102
:Similar to Acme Centaur 101, with a 300hp Jacobs R-755-A2 radial.

;Caribbean Traders Husky I
:Civil conversion of L-13A. Retained O-425 engine.
;Caribbean Traders Husky II
:Civil conversion of L-13A. Powered by 300 hp R-680-13 engine on modified engine mount capable of swinging out for easy maintenance. 
;Caribbean Traders Husky III
:Similar to Husky II, but powered by 450 hp (338 kW) Wright R-975-7 radial engine.
;Servicair Loadmaster
:Reconstruction of L-13A with 450 hp Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985-AN-1 radial engine and rearranged four-seat cabin.

<text>The Museum of Natural Sciences (, ; , ) is a Brussels museum dedicated to natural history. It is a part of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (; ), itself part of the institutions of the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO).

The Dinosaur Hall of the museum is the world&#x27;s largest museum hall completely dedicated to dinosaurs. Its most important pieces are 30 fossilised &quot;Iguanodon&quot; skeletons, which were discovered in 1878 in Bernissart, Belgium. Another famous piece is the Ishango bone, which was discovered in 1960 by Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt in the Belgian Congo. The museum also houses a research department and a public exhibit department.

The museum is located at 29, /, in Leopold Park, close to the European institutions and the House of European History (HEH). This area is served by Brussels-Luxembourg railway station, as well as by the metro stations Maelbeek/Maalbeek and Schuman on lines 1 and 5.

==History==
The Museum of Natural Sciences was founded on 31 March 1846, as a descendant of the &quot;Musée de Bruxelles&quot; of 1802. It was based on the collection established by Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, dating from the 18th century. The scientist and politician Bernard du Bus de Gisignies became the first director of the museum in 1846, and on this occasion, he donated 2,474 birds from his own collection to the museum.

In 1860, during the construction of new fortifications around Antwerp, several fossils were found, mainly of whales, and they were acquired by the museum. The museum also obtained the skeletons of a bowhead whale (&quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot;) and a young blue whale (&quot;Balaenoptera musculus&quot;), which are still on display today. The same year, the skeleton of a mammoth was unearthed near Lier, in Antwerp, Belgium, and due to the prompt action of the archaeologist François-Joseph Scohy, it was preserved and brought to the museum, where it has been exhibited since 1869. At that time, the only other skeleton of a mammoth on display was in the museum of Saint Petersburg in Russia.

In 1878, the largest find of &quot;Iguanodon&quot; fossils to date occurred in a coal mine at Bernissart, in Hainaut, Belgium. At least 38 &quot;Iguanodon&quot; (&quot;Iguanodon bernissartensis&quot;) skeletons were uncovered, at a depth of , of which 30 were brought back to the museum and put on display. They were mounted by Louis Dollo and set the standard that was followed for over a century. Found alongside the &quot;Iguanodon&quot; skeletons were the remains of plants, fish, and other reptiles, including the crocodyliform &quot;Bernissartia&quot;.

Between 1889 and 1891, the museum moved from its original home at the Palace of Charles of Lorraine into a former convent located on the heights of the park. The building quickly became too narrow and the director of the time, Edward Dupont, entrusted the architect Charles-Emile Janlet the construction of a new southern wing. Work began in 1898 and ended in October 1905. The new rooms were specially designed to accommodate the new collections.
In 1950, several modern buildings were added to house new exhibition and storage rooms, as well as premises for the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, the research centre of which the museum is now part.

Since 2007, the completely renovated and enlarged Dinosaur Hall (the &quot;Janlet&quot; wing) of has been the largest dinosaur hall in the world.

<doc id="1021470" wikidata="Q2242841" url="?curid=1021470" title="Tengah Air Base">
<text>The Tengah Air Base is a military airbase of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) located in the Western Water Catchment, in the western part of Singapore. 

The air base is the most important airfield of the RSAF as it houses the majority of the RSAF&#x27;s fixed-wing frontline squadrons, home to all of RSAF&#x27;s Airborne early warning and control (AEWC) assets, most of the F-16C/D Fighting Falcons and many UAVs. 

The airfield goes by the motto of &quot;Always Vigilant&quot;, which is supported by its main motif, a black knight chess piece symbolising the aircraft&#x27;s operational readiness in Tengah. The sword represents war&#x27;s heraldic sword of destruction, while the state is depicted by the castle.

Prior to Singapore&#x27;s independence, it was a flying Royal Air Force station known as RAF Tengah.

==History==

===RAF Tengah===

RAF Tengah was opened in 1939. Tengah airfield was the target of carpet bombing when 17 Japanese Navy bombers conducted the first air raid on Singapore, shortly after the Battle of Malaya began.

In a 1990 memoir, former Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot Terence O&#x27;Brien described leading (in late December 1941) a flight of Lockheed Hudsons from Britain to Singapore, which was already under attack by the time he and his aircrews arrived at Tengah. He noted that only eight &quot;of us out of the twenty who set off&quot; from Britain for Singapore survived the Far East campaign. Tengah had already been under air attack by the Japanese, but he said it was easy to imagine the once elegant, but now badly damaged, officers&#x27; mess just a few weeks before their arrival. He said it:

Not long after their arrival, O&#x27;Brien and his Hudsons departed Singapore just ahead of the conquering Japanese.

Tengah was the first airfield to be captured when Japanese forces invaded Singapore. After the Japanese completed their capture of Singapore, &quot;Tengah&quot; came under the control of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force while the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service took over the other two RAF stations of Sembawang Air Base and RAF Seletar as Singapore was split into north–south sphere of control. This effectively ensured that the Japanese Army took control of the south, including the administrative hub and population centre of Singapore City, while the Japanese Navy took command of the north, which included the Royal Navy dockyard at Sembawang.

===Malayan Emergency===
During the Malayan Emergency, Tengah was used to house Avro Lincolns of the RAF and Royal Australian Air Force and Bristol Brigands of No. 84 Squadron RAF which performed bombing sorties against pro-independence forces led by the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), led by the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) deep in the jungles of Peninsular Malaysia. In 1952 45 Squadron was equipped with de Havilland Hornets and re-equipped with Venoms in 1955 at RAF Butterworth when it was amalgamated with 33 Squadron] T.11&#x27;s of 60 Squadron, joined by 14 Squadron of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. In 1958 they were joined by 45 Squadron and No. 75 Squadron RNZAF, both equipped with English Electric Canberra B.2. The RAAF retained their Lincolns, with 1 Squadron, until the end of the emergency.

===&quot;Konfrontasi&quot;===
During the period of Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, 20 Squadron with its Hawker Hunter fighter aircraft in addition to the Gloster Javelins of 60 Squadron and 64 Squadron, were based on the airfield to help upgrade the air defence of Singapore and Peninsula Malaysia against infrequent air incursions from the MiG-21s and P-51 Mustangs of the Indonesian Air Force. 74 Squadron Lightnings were deployed following Confrontation to replace the Javelins of 64 Squadron.

On 3 September 1964, an Indonesian Air Force C-130 Hercules crashed into the Straits of Malacca while trying to evade interception by a Javelin FAW.9 of No 60 Squadron. On 30 April 1968, the Gloster Javelins of No 60 Squadron flew their last RAF operational sorties from &quot;Tengah&quot; and the squadron was disbanded the same day.

===V bomber detachment===
As a show of force to deter the Indonesian President Sukarno from launching an all-out war during this period, the RAF also deployed a V bomber force detachment to Tengah in the form of Handley Page Victor B.1A bombers from 15 Squadron in August 1963, which was rotated with those dispersed to RAAF Butterworth in Malaysia. The detachment of Victor bombers was replaced in October 1964 by a detachment of Avro Vulcan B.2 bombers from 12 Squadron, these were subsequently pulled back to RAF Cottesmore in December that same year. In August 1965, 9 Squadron resumed RAF&#x27;s Vulcan bomber detachment to Tengah, followed by 35 Squadron in December 1965, these were in turn replaced by 9 Squadron again in February 1966. After June 1966, 9 Squadron returned to Cottesmore following the end of the confrontation.

According to British MoD documents declassified in 2000, up to 48 Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at Tengah, between 1962 and 1970, for possible use by the V bomber force detachment and 45 Sqn Canberras for Britain&#x27;s military commitment to South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO).

===British withdrawal===
The RAF station closed at the end of March 1971 and Tengah was handed over to the Singapore Air Defence Command (later the Republic of Singapore Air Force) by 1973, after the British Withdrawal following the defence cuts. Despite this, the airfield continued to host British and Commonwealth air forces and troops under the auspices of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) until 1976. The RAAF pulled out of Tengah in 1983.

===Tengah Air Base===
It was renamed RSAF Tengah in 1971 (then it became Tengah Air Base (TAB)), when it was handed over to the Singapore Air Defence Command (SADC). Currently, the air base houses aircraft such as the Lockheed Martin F-16C/D Fighting Falcons.

RSAF50 parade took place on 1 September 2018 at TAB. The parade featured almost 500 personnel in a march-past, mobile column and a Salute-to-the-Nation flypast involving 20 aircraft. The new Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft made its maiden public appearance. The static display also showcased both retired and present aircraft.

On 8 May 2024, a F16 crashed shortly after take off, the pilot ejected with minor injuries.

*Airbase Civil Engineering Squadron – 505 Squadron
*Field Defence Squadron – 605 Squadron
*Ground Logistics Squadron – 705 Squadron
*Aircraft Operational Maintenance Squadron – 805 Squadron
*Aircraft Specialist Maintenance Squadron – 815 Squadron

===Former Flying Squadrons===
*142 Squadron with 16 A-4SU Super Skyhawk before the squadron was disbanded in 1997. The squadron was reestablished in 2016 at Paya Lebar Air Base.

==Exercises==
The RSAF regularly conducts Exercise Torrent which converts the neighboring Lim Chu Kang road into an alternative runway since its inception in April 1986. Its purpose is to demonstrate the RSAF capability of generating air power in the shortest time from public roads. The latest and seventh edition was held from the 10 to 13 November 2016.

==Future==
To accommodate the relocation of all RSAF assets and equipment from Paya Lebar Air Base, Tengah Air Base will be expanded by acquiring 50,000 graves in the Choa Chu Kang Cemetery and 80 neighbouring farms/agricultural businesses. Military training areas will be rationalised, such as the closure of Murai Urban Training Facility. A new runway will be built on the expanded portion of the base.

<text>The EMD E6 was a , A1A-A1A, streamlined passenger train locomotive manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation, and its corporate successor, General Motors Electro-Motive Division, of La Grange, Illinois. The cab version, E6A, was manufactured from November 1939 to September 1942; 91 were produced. The booster version, E6B, was manufactured from April 1940 to February 1942; 26 were produced. The was achieved by putting two , 12-cylinder, model 567 engines in the engine compartment. Each engine drove its own electrical generator to power the traction motors. The E6 was the seventh model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units.

Compared with passenger locomotives made later by EMD, the noses of the E3, E4, E5, and E6 cab units had pronounced slants when viewed from the side. Therefore, these four models have been nicknamed &quot;slant nose&quot; units. Later E models had the &quot;bulldog nose&quot; of the F series.

One interesting E6 variant custom-produced for the Missouri Pacific was the model EMC AA. This was a motorcar-style unit which had only one prime mover and , and substituted a baggage compartment where the other diesel V-12 would have been. The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific owned an equally interesting pair of similar power cars known as the EMC AB6, which were mechanically identical but had boxcabs in blunt noses. These acted as boosters behind conventional E6A models on the &quot;Rocky Mountain Rocket&quot; train between Chicago and Limon, Colorado, from where the E6A would take the Denver cars north and the AB6 would take the Colorado Springs section of the train south.

== Original owners ==
==Surviving units==
Three E6 locomotives survive today:

Atlantic Coast Line E3A 501 was wrecked before delivery, returned to EMC and rebuilt as an E6A. It has been preserved and now resides at the North Carolina Transportation Museum/Spencer Shops. ACL 501 has been at or near operational status for much of its life. After retirement from regular service, the unit was restored to purple &amp; silver colors and run on Midwest fan trips by owner Glenn Monhart. After Mr. Monhart&#x27;s death, the unit found a home in Spencer, North Carolina, at the North Carolina Transportation Museum.

Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad E6A #630, was operated by the Midland Railway, in Baldwin City, Kansas. RI 630 has since been sold and will become part of a future museum in Manly, Iowa, along with Rock Island E8A 652. Both units have been cosmetically restored but currently are under a mechanical restoration at Mid-America Car in Kansas City, MO as of March 2017.

Louisville and Nashville E6A #770, built as L&amp;N 450B, is located at the Kentucky Railway Museum, in New Haven, Kentucky. This unit is for display only, as it came to the museum without most of its internal parts.

The song, co-written by James and Alonzo Miller, was first released on James&#x27; fifth album, &quot;Street Songs&quot; (1981) and became one of James&#x27; signature songs. &quot;Freak&quot; is a slang term for the sexually adventurous, as described in the song&#x27;s lyrics, &quot;She&#x27;s a very kinky girl / The kind you don&#x27;t take home to mother&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the song number 477 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004, number 481 in 2010, and number 153 in an updated list in 2021. The song was nominated for the Grammy for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance at the 1982 Grammys. The song has been sampled by MC Hammer in 1990, Jay-Z in 2006, and Nicki Minaj in 2022.

==Recording==
&quot;Super Freak&quot; was recorded with other tracks for the &quot;Street Songs&quot; album during December 1980 – January 1981 at the Record Plant, in Sausalito, California and Motown / Hitsville U.S.A. Recording Studios, Hollywood, California. It features background vocals from James&#x27; Motown labelmates the Temptations—whose bass singer, Melvin Franklin, was one of James&#x27;s idols—and Canadian singer Taborah Johnson. The bass was played by Oscar Alston. The tenor saxophone solo is by Stone City Band member Daniel LeMelle. James&#x27; improvised lyrics were later toned down by Los Angeles DJ Alonzo Miller, who received co-writing credit. James apparently was not particularly excited about the song, but reputedly wanted to have something on the album that &quot;white folks could dance to.&quot;

<text>The Acme Aircraft Co S-1 Sierra was an experimental aircraft of unusual configuration built in the US in 1948 to investigate the advantages of a pusher propeller configuration. Apart from this engine installation, the aircraft was unusual in having an X-shaped tail incorporating ruddervators on the upper fins. The wing was mounted midway up the fuselage and was unswept. During the 1960s, the US aerospace manufacturer Northrop used the aircraft as a technology demonstrator for boundary layer control concepts.

<doc id="1021495" wikidata="Q1371470" url="?curid=1021495" title="Ethnocide">
<text>Ethnocide is the extermination or destruction of ethnic identities. Bartolomé Clavero differentiates ethnocide from genocide by stating that &quot;Genocide kills people while ethnocide kills social cultures through the killing of individual souls&quot;. According to Martin Shaw, ethnocide is a core part of physically violent genocide. Some substitute cultural genocide for ethnocide, and other argue the distinction between ethnicity and culture. Cultural genocide and ethnocide have been used in different contexts.
While the term &quot;ethnocide&quot; and &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; are similar, the intentions of their use vary. The term &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; has been criticized as a euphemism for genocide denial, while &quot;ethnocide&quot; tries to facilitate the opposite.

==Origin of the word==

Raphael Lemkin, the lawyer who coined &quot;genocide&quot; in 1943 as the union of &quot;the Greek word &quot;genos&quot; (race, tribe) and the Latin &quot;cide&quot; (killing)&quot;, also suggested &quot;ethnocide&quot; as an alternative form representing the same concept, using the Greek &quot;ethnos&quot; (nation) in place of &quot;genos&quot;. However, the term genocide has received much wider adoption than ethnocide.

==Usage==
As early as 1933, the lawyer Raphael Lemkin proposed that genocide had a cultural component, a component which he called &quot;cultural genocide.&quot; The term has since acquired rhetorical value as a phrase that is used to protest against the destruction of cultural heritage.

===Proposed usage===
The drafters of the 1948 Genocide Convention considered the use of the term, but dropped it from their consideration. The legal definition of genocide is left unspecific about the exact nature in which genocide is done, only stating that it is destruction with intent to destroy a racial, religious, ethnic or national group as such.

Article 7 of a 1994 draft of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples uses the word &quot;ethnocide&quot; as well as the phrase &quot;cultural genocide&quot; but it does not define what they mean. The complete article reads as follows:
:Indigenous peoples have the collective and individual right not to be subjected to ethnocide and cultural genocide, including prevention of and redress for:
::(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities;
::(b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources;
::(c) Any form of population transfer which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights;
::(d) Any form of assimilation or integration by other cultures or ways of life imposed on them by legislative, administrative or other measures;
::(e) Any form of propaganda directed against them.

The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly during its 62nd session at UN Headquarters in New York City on 13 September 2007, but only mentions &quot;genocide&quot; in its Article 7, not &quot;cultural genocide.&quot; Article 8 in the final document otherwise substantially retains the wording of the draft Article 7, but its first sentence reads &quot;indigenous peoples and individuals have the right not to be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of their culture&quot;.

==Notions of ethnocide==

===UNESCO===
In UNESCO&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of San Jose&quot;:

The Declaration of San Jose commits the United States and the nations of Central America to engage in a more in-depth discussion about a broad range of issues. These issues include: strengthening democracy and regional security, building trade and investment, combating crime, drugs and corruption, promoting dialogue on immigration, and achieving more equitable and sustainable development. In the Declaration of San José, UNESCO also addresses and works to define ethnocide. UNESCO defines the term as follows:

===Robert Jaulin===

The French ethnologist Robert Jaulin (1928-1996) proposed a redefinition of the concept of ethnocide in 1970, to refer not the &quot;means&quot; but the &quot;ends&quot; that define ethnocide. Accordingly, the ethnocide would be the systematic destruction of the thought and the way of life of people different from those who carry out this enterprise of destruction. Whereas the genocide assassinates the people in their body, the ethnocide kills them in their spirit.

=== Pierre Clastres ===
In Chapter 4 of &quot;The Archeology of Violence&quot; by Pierre Clastres

Ethnocide, unlike genocide, is not based on the destruction of the physical person, but rather on the destruction of a person&#x27;s culture. Ethnocide exterminates ways of thinking, living, and being from various cultures. It aims to destroy cultural differences, especially focused on the idea of &quot;wrong&quot; differences, that are present in a minority group by transforming the group&#x27;s population into the culture norm of a certain place. This measuring of differences according to one&#x27;s own culture is called ethnocentrism. The ethnocentric mind is based on the assumption that there is a hierarchy of superior and inferior cultures. Therefore, ethnocide hopes to raise inferior cultures to the status of superior cultures by any means necessary.

=== Barry Sautman ===
Barry Victor Sautman is a professor with the Division of Social Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.The &quot;intent that underlies ethnocide is not the same intent as the intent of cultural genocide, for the same reason that it is not tied to physical or biological destruction of a group. The intent is therefore typically aimed at forced assimilation and not on population decimation. Thus the intent that underlies ethnocide is an intentional act resulting in cultural death&quot;

<text>Robert Carlo Mariano (born December 25, 1975), known by the nickname Boston Rob, is an American television personality, known for appearing in the CBS reality show &quot;Survivor&quot;. He placed tenth in the show&#x27;s fourth season &quot;&quot;, finished as the runner-up to his eventual wife Amber Brkich in the show&#x27;s eighth season &quot;&quot;, came in 13th place in the show&#x27;s 20th season &quot;&quot;, won the show&#x27;s 22nd season &quot;&quot;, returned for the show&#x27;s 39th season &quot;&quot; as a mentor for the new players alongside Sandra Diaz-Twine, and came in 17th place in the show&#x27;s 40th season &quot;&quot;. Mariano is the first contestant to appear on &quot;Survivor&quot; six times, and play five times. He also competed on &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; twice alongside his wife, where they placed second and eighth.

== Personal life ==
Mariano was born in Hyde Park, Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in Canton, Massachusetts. He is of Italian descent. Mariano graduated from Xaverian Brothers High School in 1994, where he played golf and hockey. In 1999, Mariano graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Boston University. He made the BU hockey team in 1995 as a freshman, but declined to play for coach Jack Parker after he was told that he would not receive much ice time. At the time, Mariano first played &quot;Survivor&quot; in 2001, he was 25 years old and continuing to coach the hockey team.

Mariano began a relationship with fellow reality TV contestant Amber Brkich in 2003, during their time filming &quot;&quot;. They became engaged on May 9, 2004, during the show&#x27;s live finale at Madison Square Garden in New York City, and married on April 16, 2005, at Atlantis Paradise Island in The Bahamas. CBS aired a two-hour special about the wedding, entitled &quot;Rob and Amber Get Married&quot;, on May 24, 2005. After their marriage, Brkich took Mariano&#x27;s surname, and the couple moved to Pensacola, Florida. They have four daughters: Lucia Rose (born July 4, 2009), Carina Rose (born December 10, 2010), Isabetta Rose (born May 5, 2012), and Adelina Rose (born June 20, 2014). Their entire family are members of the Catholic Church.

== &quot;Survivor&quot; ==
=== &quot;Marquesas&quot; ===

Assigned to the Maraamu tribe at the start of the game, Mariano was successful in leading a counter alliance against Hunter Ellis though as a result of this their challenge performance was lackluster compared to the opposing tribe. In the fourth episode, &quot;&quot;, Mariano was swapped into the minority on his new tribe, Rotu, though was spared when Gabriel Cade&#x27;s apathetic nature to the game was seen as detrimental. When the tribes merged, Mariano was viewed as the biggest target by the original Rotu tribe members and attempted to counter by warning of a splinter group of John Carroll, Tammy Leitner, Zoe Zanidakis, and Robert DeCanio though this proved unsuccessful and was voted out in a 7-2-1 vote.

=== &quot;All-Stars&quot; ===

Mariano was announced to compete in &quot;&quot; after his prior performance in &quot;Survivor: Marquesas&quot;. Assigned to the Chapera tribe, Mariano formed an immediate alliance with Amber Brkich and successfully navigated the game together through brokering deals with contestants that would not be honored and securing an alliance with Jenna Lewis and Rupert Boneham to eliminate bigger targets. Upon reaching the final tribal council, Mariano was lambasted for abusing his relationships with contestants outside of the game to benefit himself though was praised for his aggressive gameplay. On May 9, 2004, before the votes were announced, Mariano proposed to Brkich, which she accepted. Mariano lost the season in a 4–3 vote.

=== &quot;Heroes vs. Villains&quot; ===

For his actions in &quot;Survivor: All-Stars&quot;, Mariano was announced as a contestant for &quot;&quot;. Assigned to the Villains tribe, Mariano was the de facto leader of the Villains with his storyline focused on his rivalry with Russell Hantz and their differing views of the game. In the sixth episode, &quot;&quot;, Mariano and his alliance planned to split the vote between Hantz and Parvati Shallow to eliminate either target and a hidden immunity idol, but their plan was thwarted when Tyson Apostol changed his vote, leading to Apostol&#x27;s elimination. In the seventh episode, &quot;&quot;, with Mariano now in the minority of his tribe, he appealed to Benjamin &quot;Coach&quot; Wade&#x27;s sense of honesty and integrity to vote Hantz. Coach was divided between his allegiances to both Mariano and Hantz but ultimately sided against Mariano, and Mariano was voted out.

=== &quot;Redemption Island&quot; ===

On January 13, 2011, Mariano was announced to compete in his fourth season, &quot;&quot; in a continuation of his feud in &quot;Heroes vs Villains&quot; with Russell Hantz. Mariano, through his hard work ethic and likeability from his new tribe, became the de facto leader. As a result of this, Mariano formed a majority alliance with Andrea Boehlke, Grant Mattos, Natalie Tenerelli, Matt Elrod, and Ashley Underwood. As the game progressed, Mariano successfully eliminated opponents with relative ease and formed an alliance with outsider Phillip Sheppard due to his abrasive and unpredictable nature. Using his past experiences and ability to read his fellow players, Mariano controlled every vote he was involved in and was able to reach the final tribal council where he was praised for his dominant game over finalists Sheppard and Tenerelli who attributed their success to Mariano. On May 15, 2011, Mariano was revealed to have won the season in an 8-1-0 vote. Whilst viewers and fans were critical of his win, Jeff Probst characterized Mariano&#x27;s game as the &quot;most perfect game of &quot;Survivor&quot; ever.&quot;

=== &quot;Island of the Idols&quot; ===

Mariano, along with former castmate Sandra Diaz-Twine, returned for the 39th season in a mentor role for a new group of castaways. Unable to vote or compete in challenges, Mariano and Diaz-Twine lived together on a separate beach from the game and, at times, have one player visit to be taught a lesson on the various facets of Survivor. They would also attend each Tribal Council in a hideaway. On the morning of Day 37, Mariano and Diaz-Twine departed from the eponymous &quot;Island of the Idols&quot; leaving a luxurious shelter and supplies for the final five castaways of the season.

=== &quot;Winners at War&quot; ===

At the finale of &quot;Survivor: Island of the Idols&quot;, it was announced that Mariano would be competing alongside 19 other winners of the show, including Brkich. He was placed on the Sele tribe where he quickly formed an &quot;Old-School&quot; Alliance with Parvati Shallow and Ethan Zohn, although the alliance ultimately fell apart due to Danni Boatwright informing Ben Driebergen of its existence. Mariano was later swapped to the Yara tribe with Driebergen, Adam Klein, Sarah Lacina, and Sophie Clarke, where he was the sixth person voted out of the game. Mariano was defeated by Tyson Apostol and Natalie Anderson respectively in the challenges to return from the Edge of Extinction and was sent to the jury for the first time in his career. Mariano voted for Tony Vlachos to win the season, which he did in a 12-4-0 vote, making Vlachos the second two-time Sole Survivor following Diaz-Twine, and the winner of the increased grand prize at $2,000,000.

With this season, Mariano became the first &quot;Survivor&quot; contestant to play for a fifth time; Mariano once again became the longest-played &quot;Survivor&quot; contestant in his career, having played a cumulative 152 days (excluding the 37 days in &quot;Island of the Idols&quot;) over five seasons, surpassing the previous record held by Ozzy Lusth who played 128 over four seasons set in &quot;&quot;.

== &quot;Rob and Amber Get Married&quot; ==
On April 16, 2005, Mariano and Brkich were married in a private ceremony at Atlantis Paradise Island in the Bahamas. CBS aired a two-hour special about the wedding, &quot;Rob and Amber Get Married&quot;, on May 24, 2005.

==&quot;The Amazing Race&quot;==
===&quot;Season 7&quot;===
As an engaged couple, Mariano and his fiancée Amber Brkich participated in the seventh season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; and came in second place. During a Roadblock challenge in Mendoza, Argentina, in the third leg of the race, contestants had to eat four pounds of meat. Mariano began the roadblock but very quickly determined he would not or could not eat that quantity. The penalty for not finishing the Roadblock was a four-hour delay. By convincing several other contestants to refuse to participate, he ensured that several contestants were on the same timetable as he and Brkich. Also in South America, Mariano pooled his money with some other racers to bribe the bus driver into letting the teams that contributed off earlier. When Mariano bribed the driver, he used none of his own money.

In Botswana, during the sixth leg of the race, the couple was criticized by fellow racers, as well as host Phil Keoghan, when they drove by the car accident of another team, brothers Brian and Greg, without stopping. Their fellow competitors all checked in with the brothers prior to continuing on to the next stage of the race. In southern Africa, Mariano and Brkich saw their own photo on a magazine cover.

Mariano and Brkich ultimately finished in second place behind married couple, Uchenna and Joyce. Amongst fans, there has been much speculation surrounding the final leg of the race. It has been argued that the production crew had intervened with the airport authorities and aided Uchenna and Joyce onto the same, earlier plane as Mariano and Brkich. In the &quot;Revisiting the Race&quot; special feature on the Season 7 DVD, Mariano, along with Uchenna and Keoghan, denied these accusations. Mariano describes Uchenna running around frantically trying to get onto the flight, which the final edited version of the show does not portray. Keoghan cites the fact that the decision to re-open the door rested solely with the pilot, and that intervention by the production crew would have resulted in someone leaking such information out. Although Mariano and Brkich lost the one million dollar grand prize and &quot;The Amazing Race 7&quot; winners&#x27; title at the final leg of the race, they managed to win the 2nd, 4th, 7th, and 10th legs. They were also the only team to not come in last place on any legs of the race.

===&quot;All-Stars&quot;===
The Marianos later competed in the &quot;All-Stars&quot; season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, which began airing in February 2007. The couple&#x27;s racing status was listed as &quot;newlyweds&quot;. While they had set a record for &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, coming in first place for the first three legs, they were eliminated on the fourth leg of the race.

==Additional television appearances==
In 2004, Mariano was the narrator/player operator of a short-lived reality series on UPN titled &quot;The Player&quot;.

On April 16, 2005, Mariano and Brkich were married in a private ceremony in the Bahamas. CBS aired &quot;Rob and Amber Get Married&quot;, a two-hour special about the wedding, on May 24, 2005.

Mariano was a co-host of the six-week Sci Fi series, &quot;Sci Fi Investigates&quot;.

Between their two appearances on &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, Mariano and Brkich filmed a 10-episode show for the Fox Reality Channel, &quot;Rob and Amber: Against the Odds&quot; in 2006, which aired the following year. Set in Las Vegas, the program follows Mariano&#x27;s attempts to become a professional poker player and features professional player Daniel Negreanu tutoring him. The series ended with Rob and Amber Mariano accepting an offer to appear on &quot;The Amazing Race: All-Stars&quot; and the odds of Rob&#x27;s professional poker career waned.

In 2008, Mariano appeared in an episode of Canadian show &quot;Reality Obsessed&quot;, hosted by Murtz Jaffer and won first place in a competition that pitted him against James Zinkand (&quot;Big Brother 9&quot;), Jen Parker (&quot;The Amazing Race 12&quot;), and Jennifer Hoffman (&quot;The Apprentice&quot;).

Mariano was co-host on The History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in 80 Ways&quot; which ran from October to December 2011.

In 2016, Mariano appeared in a special episode of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; which featured multiple former &quot;Survivor&quot; contestants competing on the show. The episode aired on May 23, 2016.

In 2022, Mariano was in a Season 2 episode of &quot;Secret Celebrity Renovation&quot;, where he and his company help restore houses for various celebrities.

Mariano was a contestant on the first season of &quot;Deal or No Deal Island&quot;. He was eliminated at the final four challenge by coming in last place after receiving a three-minute penalty for looking at another player&#x27;s completed puzzle.

Mariano is also a contestant on &quot;The Traitors&quot; season 3 which aired in 2025. During the season, he came in 12th place after being eliminated in a roundtable vote.

<text>The Wilmington Blue Rocks are a Minor League Baseball team of the South Atlantic League and the High-A affiliate of the Washington Nationals. They are located in Wilmington, Delaware, and play their home games at Daniel S. Frawley Stadium.

==Franchise history==
The Blue Rocks played in the Carolina League, an advanced Single-A league in minor league baseball, from 1993 to 2020. The name &quot;Blue Rocks&quot; was chosen because of the blue granite found along the Brandywine River in Wilmington. The Blue Rocks play at Judy Johnson Field at Daniel S. Frawley Stadium in Wilmington&#x27;s growing Riverfront district and was instrumental in bringing commerce and public attention to the once ignored and dilapidated area of the city.

The Blue Rocks played their first season in 1993 when the Peninsula Pilots were purchased and relocated to the riverfront in Wilmington, Delaware. Principal owner Frank Boulton and co-owner Bud Harrelson bought the franchise in 1992, moved the team from Hampton, Virginia, and changed their affiliation from the Seattle Mariners&#x27; farm system to the Kansas City Royals&#x27;. When the franchise moved to Wilmington in 1993, the ballpark was known as Legends Stadium, after the sports legends of Delaware. After Frawley, the Wilmington mayor who played a major role in the creation of the team, died while playing a recreational basketball game, the stadium was renamed Daniel S. Frawley Stadium in his honor.

The Blue Rocks were Kansas City farm team from their inception, except for the 2005 and 2006 seasons when the team was affiliated with the Boston Red Sox. In 2020, with the re-organization of the minor leagues, the Blue Rocks became an affiliate of the Washington Nationals.

In 2005, the Blue Rocks were featured in &quot;SportsCenter&quot;&#x27;s 50 States in 50 Days. Matt Winer reported from a set in left field where &quot;SportsCenter&quot; did stories on the many mascots of the Blue Rocks. The Aug 19 game featuring &quot;SportsCenter&quot; drew the Blue Rocks&#x27; largest crowd in team history.

The Blue Rocks played host to the 2014 California/Carolina League All Star Game, having previously hosted the game last 12 years earlier in 2002. The California League All Stars ousted the Carolina League All Stars 3-2. Kyle Waldrop of the Bakersfield Blaze took home the game&#x27;s MVP award.

On July 15, 2019, Jonathan Bowlan pitched the second no-hitter in franchise history against the Carolina Mudcats. He struck out nine batters, walking none on 97 pitches.

The Blue Rocks won the 2019 Mills Cup Championship for the first time since 1999, closing a five-game series with the Fayetteville Woodpeckers with a 2-0 victory on September 14, 2019.

In December 2020, the Blue Rocks were officially invited to become an affiliate of the Washington Nationals, joining the Nationals&#x27; minor league system beginning with the 2021 season. In further conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Blue Rocks were organized into the High-A East. In 2022, the High-A East became known as the South Atlantic League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

<text>Captain Elmore Philpott (May 2, 1896 – December 9, 1964) was a Canadian politician and journalist. Philpott joined the Canadian military during World War I and was badly wounded – he needed two canes to help him walk for the rest of his life.

He was working as an editorial writer for the Toronto &quot;Globe&quot; when he ran for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party in its 1930 leadership convention. He lost badly to Mitchell Hepburn. The next year, he attempted to become a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario through a by-election, but was defeated.

In 1933, Philpott resigned from the &quot;Globe&quot; to join the new Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and was asked to lead a campaign organizing Clubs for the Ontario CCF. The CCF in Ontario was organized into three sections at the time: the United Farmers of Ontario (UFO), the &quot;Labour Conference&quot; made up of socialist and labour groups, and the CCF Clubs. Philpott became the president of the Ontario Association of CCF Clubs, one of the key leaders of the party in the province, and a popular stump speaker for the socialist cause.

After twenty months of intense work in the party, including leading a purge of communists, Philpott suddenly resigned in March 1934 as president of the Ontario CCF clubs, ostensibly because he was the UFO candidate for Halton in the upcoming federal election and the UFO had left the Ontario CCF over the purported influence of Communists. In March 1935, he announced he was rejoining the Liberal Party of Canada and was nominated as the Liberal candidate in the riding of York South for the 1935 election and proceeded to claim there was a &quot;sinister conspiracy&quot; to merge the CCF and the Communists with Communist Party head Tim Buck as leader of the new socialist party, a claim that Ontario CCF organizer Ted Jolliffe decried as a &quot;fantastic fabrication&quot;. In the election, Philpott placed third behind the Conservative and CCF candidates.

Philpott returned to journalism and moved to British Columbia in the 1940s where he became a reporter and then a columnist for the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;. He ran as an Independent candidate in the federal by-election held in the riding of New Westminster in 1949, placing second behind the Liberal candidate.

He was finally elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1953 election as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Vancouver South. He was defeated in the 1957 election. He attempted to return to the House of Commons as a Liberal candidate in the 1958 general election in Vancouver South, and in the 1962 general election in Okanagan Boundary, but was badly defeated both times.

Philpott died in Vancouver in 1964.

<text>Dilution of precision (DOP), or geometric dilution of precision (GDOP), is a term used in satellite navigation and geomatics engineering to specify the error propagation as a mathematical effect of navigation satellite geometry on positional measurement precision.

==Introduction==
The concept of dilution of precision (DOP) originated with users of the Loran-C navigation system. The idea of geometric DOP is to state how errors in the measurement will affect the final state estimation. This can be defined as:

:formula_1

Conceptually you can geometrically imagine errors on a measurement resulting in the formula_2 term changing. Ideally small changes in the measured data will not result in large changes in output location. The opposite of this ideal is the situation where the solution is very sensitive to measurement errors. The interpretation of this formula is shown in the figure to the right, showing two possible scenarios with acceptable and poor GDOP.

With the wide adoption of satellite navigation systems, the term has come into much wider usage. Neglecting ionospheric and tropospheric effects, the signal from navigation satellites has a fixed precision. Therefore, the relative satellite-receiver geometry plays a major role in determining the precision of estimated positions and times. Due to the relative geometry of any given satellite to a receiver, the precision in the pseudorange of the satellite translates to a corresponding component in each of the four dimensions of position measured by the receiver (i.e., formula_3, formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6). The precision of multiple satellites in view of a receiver combine according to the relative position of the satellites to determine the level of precision in each dimension of the receiver measurement. When visible navigation satellites are close together in the sky, the geometry is said to be weak and the DOP value is high; when far apart, the geometry is strong and the DOP value is low. Consider two overlapping rings, or annuli, of different centres. If they overlap at right angles, the greatest extent of the overlap is much smaller than if they overlap in near parallel. Thus a low DOP value represents a better positional precision due to the wider angular separation between the satellites used to calculate a unit&#x27;s position. Other factors that can increase the effective DOP are obstructions such as nearby mountains or buildings.

DOP can be expressed as a number of separate measurements:
; HDOP: Horizontal dilution of precision
; VDOP: Vertical dilution of precision
; PDOP: Position (3D) dilution of precision
; TDOP: Time dilution of precision
; GDOP: Geometric dilution of precision

These values follow mathematically from the positions of the usable satellites. Signal receivers allow the display of these positions (&quot;skyplot&quot;) as well as the DOP values.

The term can also be applied to other location systems that employ several geographical spaced sites. It can occur in electronic-counter-counter-measures (electronic warfare) when computing the location of enemy emitters (radar jammers and radio communications devices). Using such an interferometry technique can provide certain geometric layout where there are degrees of freedom that cannot be accounted for due to inadequate configurations.

The effect of geometry of the satellites on position error is called geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and it is roughly interpreted as ratio of position error to the range error. Imagine that a square pyramid is formed by lines joining four satellites with the receiver at the tip of the pyramid. The larger the volume of the pyramid, the better (lower) the value of GDOP; the smaller its volume, the worse (higher) the value of GDOP will be. Similarly, the greater the number of satellites, the better the value of GDOP.

==Interpretation==
The DOP factors are functions of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of the parameters, expressed either in a global or a local geodetic frame.

==Computation==
As a first step in computing DOP, consider the unit vectors from the receiver to satellite formula_7: 
:formula_8

where formula_9 denote the position of the receiver and formula_10 denote the position of satellite i. Formulate the matrix, A, which (for 4 pseudorange measurement residual equations) is:
:formula_11

The first three elements of each row of &quot;A&quot; are the components of a unit vector from the receiver to the indicated satellite. The last element of each row refers to the partial derivative of pseudorange w.r.t. receiver&#x27;s clock bias.
Formulate the matrix, &quot;Q&quot;, as the covariance matrix resulting from the least-squares normal matrix:
:formula_12

In general:
: formula_13

where formula_14 is the Jacobian of the sensor measurement residual equations formula_15, with respect to the unknowns, formula_16; formula_17 is the Jacobian of the sensor measurement residual equations with respect to the measured quantities formula_18, and formula_19 is the correlation matrix for noise in the measured quantities.

For the preceding case of 4 range measurement residual equations: formula_20, formula_21, formula_22, formula_23, formula_24, formula_25, formula_26, formula_27 and the measurement noises for the different formula_28 have been assumed to be independent which makes formula_29.

This formula for Q arises from applying best linear unbiased estimation to a linearized version of the sensor measurement residual equations about the current solution formula_30, except in the case of B.L.U.E. formula_19 is a noise covariance matrix rather than the noise correlation matrix used in DOP, and the reason DOP makes this substitution is to obtain a relative error. When formula_19 is a noise covariance matrix, formula_33 is an estimate of the matrix of covariance of noise in the unknowns due to the noise in the measured quantities. It is the estimate obtained by the &quot;first-order second moment&quot; (F.O.S.M.) uncertainty quantification technique which was state of the art in the 1980s. In order for the F.O.S.M. theory to be strictly applicable, either the input noise distributions need to be Gaussian or the measurement noise standard deviations need to be small relative to rate of change in the output near the solution. In this context, the second criteria is typically the one that is satisfied.

This (i.e. for the 4 time of arrival/range measurement residual equations) computation is in accordance with [6] where the weighting matrix, 
formula_34 happens to simplify down to the identity matrix.

Note that P only simplifies down to the identity matrix because all the sensor measurement residual equations are time of arrival (pseudo range) equations. In other cases, for example when trying to locate someone broadcasting on an international distress frequency, formula_35 would not simplify down to the identity matrix and in that case there would be a &quot;frequency DOP&quot; or FDOP component either in addition to or in place of the TDOP component. (Regarding &quot;in place of the TDOP component&quot;: Since the clocks on the legacy International Cospas-Sarsat Programme LEO satellites are much less accurate than GPS clocks, discarding their time measurements would actually increase the geolocation solution accuracy.)

The elements of formula_33 are designated as:
:formula_37

PDOP, TDOP, and GDOP are given by:
:formula_38

Notice GDOP is the square root of the trace of the formula_33 matrix.

The horizontal and vertical dilution of precision,
:formula_40,
are both dependent on the coordinate system used. To correspond to the local east-north-up coordinate system,

 EDOP^2 x x x
 x NDOP^2 x x
 x x VDOP^2 x
 x x x TDOP^2

and the derived dilutions:
:formula_41

<text>Badger is a superhero in American comic books publisher by the short-lived Capital Comics company and then First Comics. He was created by writer Mike Baron in 1983 and published through the early 1990s in a titular series that ended when First Comics also ceased all publications. Since the ongoing series ended in 1991, new Badger titles have been released sporadically through Dark Horse Comics, Image Comics, IDW Publishing, and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing&quot;.

==Publication history==
The first four issues of &quot;Badger&quot; were published by Capital Comics (under the name &quot;Badger&quot;), beginning in 1983. Capital ceased publishing in 1984, and in 1985 Baron took his creation to First Comics to then be illustrated by artist Bill Reinhold. First reprinted the first four issues, and then published monthly issues of Badger, including the &quot;Hexbreaker&quot; graphic novel in 1988. A spin-off four-issue miniseries ran concurrently with the regular series in 1989, called &quot;Badger Goes Berserk&quot;, which explored Norbert&#x27;s childhood and his abuse at the hands of his stepfather and stepbrother, now white supremacists who he encountered again in the miniseries. Badger sometimes guest-starred in Mike Baron&#x27;s other series, the space opera &quot;Nexus&quot;, which took place in the future. Badger would imagine these episodes to be psychotic hallucinations, which he took in stride as being no more bizarre than the rest of his life. In 1991, First Comics published &quot;Badger Bedlam&quot;, a one-shot &quot;First Publishing Deluxe-Format Special&quot; by Baron, Butler, and Ken Branch, but then went bankrupt and the series ended with #70. Badger also featured in First&#x27;s five-issue &quot;Crossroads&quot; series. Artists who worked on &quot;Badger&quot; in its 1980s run included Jeff Butler, Steven Butler, Bill Reinhold, Chas Truog, Jackson Guice, Mike Mignola, Gary Chaloner and Ron Lim.

In 1994, Dark Horse Comics published two miniseries featuring different versions of Badger&#x27;s origin: the four-issue &quot;Badger: Shattered Mirror&quot;, a &quot;serious&quot; take on Badger&#x27;s origin, and the two-issue &quot;Badger: Zen Pop Funny-Animal Version&quot;. These were deliberately written to be mutually exclusive.

In 1997, Image Comics began publishing a black and white fourth &quot;Badger&quot; series, whose narrative connection to the previous versions was not entirely clear. This series ran for eleven issues.

The series returned November 2007, published by IDW Publishing. This consists of a reprint series of trade paperbacks of old issues, as well two new Badger stories: a one shot, &quot;Badger: Bull&quot;, followed by a miniseries, &quot;Badger Saves the World&quot; which started in December 2007.

In 2013, Bluewater Productions published &quot;Crossed Wires&quot;, a four-issue miniseries that saw 10th Muse cross over with Badger, Bomb Queen, and Judo Girl. Badger returned in a five-issue miniseries published by Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing in 2016.

==Fictional character biography==
&quot;Badger&quot; was mostly set in Madison, Wisconsin, where Capital Comics was situated. The lead character was Norbert Sykes, a Vietnam War veteran suffering from multiple personality disorder. &quot;Badger&quot;, an urban vigilante who could talk to animals, was just one of his personalities. Bizarrely, he would often call people &quot;Larry&quot;, and it was later revealed that &quot;Larry&quot; was the name of his father who left his mother when Norbert was five. His mother remarried Rollin Sykes who physically abused Norbert. After escaping from a mental institution, Norbert met a 5th-century Druid named Ham (Hammaglystwythkbrngxxaxolotl in full), who had just awakened from an 800-year coma (this was later corrected in dialogue where it was noted that Ham&#x27;s coma lasted 1500 years). Ham took Badger in as a boarder in his castle in return for Badger&#x27;s bodyguard services. Other characters included Norbert&#x27;s caseworker Daisy, Vietnamese martial arts expert (and Norbert&#x27;s wife) Mavis, and Lord Weterlackus, a demon who empowered Ham until they had a falling-out. Prior to his coma, Ham would sacrifice children in his castle in Wales (Ham was placed in a mystical coma for 1500 years by all the other wizards), but after his resurrection he would sacrifice animals (which enraged Badger) or computer files. Ham would use his power over weather to influence markets and generate wealth for himself; occasionally his supernatural dealings would bring him into conflict with demons, whom Badger would then be called upon to fight.

==Personalities of Badger==
* Norbert Sykes: This is his legal identity.
* Badger: A martial arts expert (4th or 5th dan in Shōrin-ryū karate, plus many other arts) costumed vigilante dispensing bare-fisted justice to bullies and aggressors of the innocent, but according to his own warped perceptions. He often defends animals or environmental causes.
* Emily: 9-year-old girl. Related to childhood abuse at the hands of Sykes&#x27; stepfather Rollin Sykes.
* Pierre: Homicidal personality who speaks with a French accent. First appeared when Ham tried to awaken Sykes from his first Emily personality transformation.

<text>Lordosis is historically defined as an &quot;abnormal&quot; inward curvature of the lumbar spine. However, the terms &quot;lordosis&quot; and &quot;lordotic&quot; are also used to refer to the normal inward curvature of the lumbar and cervical regions of the human spine. Similarly, kyphosis historically refers to &quot;abnormal&quot; convex curvature of the spine. The normal outward (convex) curvature in the thoracic and sacral regions is also termed &quot;kyphosis&quot; or &quot;kyphotic&quot;. The term comes .

Lordosis in the human spine makes it easier for humans to bring the bulk of their mass over the pelvis. This allows for a much more efficient walking gait than that of other primates, whose inflexible spines cause them to resort to an inefficient forward-leaning &quot;bent-knee, bent-waist&quot; gait. As such, lordosis in the human spine is considered one of the primary physiological adaptations of the human skeleton that allows for human gait to be as energetically efficient as it is.

&quot;Lumbar hyperlordosis&quot; is excessive extension of the lumbar region, and is commonly called &quot;hollow back&quot; or &quot;saddle back&quot; (after a similar condition that affects some horses). &quot;Sway back&quot; is a different condition with a different cause, that at a glance can mimic the outward appearance of lumbar hyperlordosis. &quot;Lumbar kyphosis&quot; is an abnormally straight (or in severe cases flexed) lumbar region.

==Types==
===Lumbar lordosis===
Normal lordotic curvatures, also known as &quot;secondary&quot; curvatures, result in a difference in the thickness between the front and back parts of the intervertebral disc. Lordosis may also increase at puberty, sometimes not becoming evident until the early or mid-20s.

In radiology, a &quot;lordotic view&quot; is an X-ray taken of a patient leaning backward.

===Lumbar hyperlordosis===
Lumbar hyperlordosis is a condition that occurs when the lumbar region (lower back) experiences stress or extra weight and becomes arched more than normal, sometimes leading to muscle pain or spasms. It is a common postural position in which the natural curve of the lumbar region of the back is slightly or dramatically accentuated. Commonly known as swayback, it is common in dancers. Imbalances in muscle strength and length are one cause of this excessive stress to the lower back, such as weak hamstrings and tight hip flexors (psoai). A major feature of lumbar hyperlordosis is a forward pelvic tilt, resulting in the pelvis resting on top of the thighs.

Other health conditions and disorders can cause hyperlordosis. Achondroplasia (a disorder where bones grow abnormally, which can result in short stature as in dwarfism), spondylolisthesis (a condition in which vertebrae slip forward), and osteoporosis (the most common bone disease in which bone density is lost resulting in bone weakness and increased likelihood of fracture) are some of the most common causes of hyperlordosis. Other causes include obesity, hyperkyphosis (spine curvature disorder in which the thoracic curvature is abnormally rounded), discitis (inflammation of the intervertebral disc space caused by infection), and benign juvenile lordosis. Other factors may also include rare diseases, including Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS), where some joints throughout the body are so hyper-extensible that they can become unstable (i.e. problematically much more flexible than normal, frequently to the point of partial or full dislocation). With such hyper-extensibility, it is also quite common (if not the norm) for some of the muscles surrounding an unstable joint to compensate for that instability by contracting.

Excessive lordotic curvature – lumbar hyperlordosis, is also called &quot;hollow back&quot;, and &quot;saddle back&quot; (after a similar condition that affects some horses); swayback usually refers to a nearly opposite postural misalignment that can initially look quite similar. Common causes of lumbar hyperlordosis include tight low back muscles, excessive visceral fat, and pregnancy. Rickets, a vitamin D deficiency in children, can cause lumbar hyperlordosis.

===Lumbar hypolordosis===
Being less common than lumbar hyperlordosis, hypolordosis (also known as flatback) occurs when there&#x27;s less of a curve in the lower back or a flattening of the lower back. This occurs because the vertebrae are oriented toward the back of the spine, stretching the disc towards the back and compressing it in the front. This can cause a narrowing of the opening for the nerves, potentially pinching them.

==Signs and symptoms==
Lumbar hyperlordosis (also known as anterior pelvic tilt) has a noticeable impact on the height of individuals with this medical issue, a height loss of 0.5–2.5 inches (1.27–6.35 centimeters) is common.

For example, the height loss was measured by measuring the patient&#x27;s height while standing straight (with exaggerated curves in the upper and lower back) and again after the patient fixed this issue (with no exaggerated curves), both of these measurements were taken in the morning with a gap of 6 months and the growth plates of the patient were checked to make sure that they were closed to rule out natural growth. The height loss occurs in the torso region and once the person fixes their back, the person&#x27;s Body Mass Index will reduce since the person is taller and the stomach will also appear to be slimmer. 

A similar impact has also been noticed in trans women who have weaker muscles in the lower back due to increased estrogen intake and other such treatments.

However, the cause of height loss in both situations is a little different even though the impact is similar. In the first scenario, it can be due to a genetic condition, trauma to the spine, pregnancy in women, increased abdominal fat, or a sedentary lifestyle (sitting too much causes muscle imbalances and is the most common reason for this issue) and in the second scenario, the estrogen weakens the muscles in the area. 

Merely slouching doesn&#x27;t cause height loss, even though it may make a person look shorter, slouching may lead to perceived height loss, whereas lumbar hyperlordosis leads to actual and measured height loss. To make it easier to understand the difference, people losing a vertebra (which is around 2 inches or 5 centimeters in height) in the spine will be shorter regardless of posture. Lumbar hyperlordosis, of course, doesn&#x27;t make you lose a vertebra but it bends them in such a way that your spine&#x27;s vertical height is reduced.

Although lumbar hyperlordosis gives an impression of a stronger back, it can lead to moderate to severe lower back pain. The most problematic symptom is that of a herniated disc where the individual has put so much strain on the back that the discs between the vertebrae have been damaged or have ruptured. Technical problems with dancing such as difficulty in the positions of attitude and arabesque can be a sign of weak iliopsoas. Tightness of the iliopsoas results in a dancer having difficulty lifting their leg into high positions. Abdominal muscles being weak and the rectus femoris of the quadriceps being tight are signs that improper muscles are being worked while dancing which leads to lumbar hyperlordosis. The most obvious signs of lumbar hyperlordosis are lower back pain in dancing and pedestrian activities as well as having the appearance of a swayed back.

==Causes==
Possible causes that lead to the condition of lumbar hyperlordosis are the following:
* Spine – Natural factors of how spines are formed greatly increase certain individuals&#x27; likelihood to experience a strain or sprain in their back or neck. Factors such as having more lumbar vertebrae allowing for too much flexibility, and then in cases of less lumbar the individual not reaching their necessity for flexibility and then pushing their bodies to injury.
* Legs – Another odd body formation is when an individual has a leg shorter than the other, which can be an immediate cause for the imbalance of hips then putting strain on the posture of the back which an individual has to adjust into vulnerable positions to meet aesthetic appearances. This can lead to permanent damage to the back. Genu recurvatum (swaying back knees) is also a factor that forces a dancer to adjust to unstable postures.
* Hips – Common problems in the hips are tight hip flexors, which causes poor lifting posture, hip flexion contracture, which means the lack of postural awareness, and thoracic hyperkyphosis, which causes the individual to compensate for limited hip turn out (which is essential to dances such as ballet). Weak psoas (short for iliopsoas-muscle that controls the hip flexor) forces the dancer to lift from the strength of their back instead of from the hip when lifting their leg into arabesque or attitude. This causes great stress and risk of injury, especially because the dancer will have to compensate to obtain the positions required.
* Muscles – One of the greatest contributors is uneven muscles. Because all muscles have a muscle that works in opposition to it. It is imperative that to keep all muscles protected, the opposite muscle is not stronger than the muscle at risk. In the situation of lumbar lordosis, abdominal muscles are weaker than the muscles in the lumbar spine and the hamstring muscles. The muscular imbalance results in pulling down the pelvis in the front of the body, creating a swayback in the spine.
* Growth spurt – Younger dancers are more at risk for the development of lumbar hyperlordosis because the lumbar fascia and hamstrings tighten when a child starts to experience a growth spurt into adolescence.

Technical factors
* Improper lifts – When male dancers are performing dance lifts with another dancer they are extremely prone to lift in the incorrect posture, pushing their arms up to lift the other dancer, while letting their core and spine curve which is easy to then hyperlordosis in a dancer&#x27;s back.
* Overuse – Over 45% of anatomical sites of injury in dancers are in the lower back. This can be attributed to the strains of repetitive dance training which may lead to minor trauma. If the damaged site is not given time to heal the damage of the injury will increase. Abrupt increases in dance intensity or sudden changes in dance choreography do not allow the body to adapt to the new stresses. New styles of dance, returning to dance, or increasing dance time by a great deal will result in exhaustion of the body.

==Diagnosis==

Measurement and diagnosis of lumbar hyperlordosis can be difficult. Obliteration of vertebral end-plate landmarks by interbody fusion may make the traditional measurement of segmental lumbar lordosis more difficult. Because the L4–L5 and L5–S1 levels are most commonly involved in fusion procedures or arthrodesis and contribute to normal lumbar lordosis, it is helpful to identify a reproducible and accurate means of measuring segmental lordosis at these levels. A visible sign of hyperlordosis is an abnormally large arch of the lower back and the person appears to be puffing out their stomach and buttocks.

=== Scanning ===

==== X-ray ====
Precise diagnosis is done by looking at a complete medical history, physical examination, and other tests of the patient. X-rays are used to measure the lumbar curvature. On a lateral X-ray, a normal range of the lordotic curvature of between 20° and 60° has been proposed by Stagnara et al., as measured from the inferior endplate of T12 to the inferior endplate of L5. The Scoliosis Research Society has proposed a range of 40° and 60° as measured between the upper endplate of Th12 and the upper endplate of S1. Individual studies, although using other reference points, have found normal ranges up to approximately 85°. It is generally more pronounced in females. It is relatively constant through adolescence and young adulthood, but decreases in the elderly.

==== MRI and CT ====
Bone scans are conducted to rule out possible fractures and infections, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to eliminate the possibility of the spinal cord or nerve abnormalities, and computed tomography scans (CT scans) are used to get a more detailed image of the bones, muscles, and organs of the lumbar region.

==Treatment==

===Exercises===

Some corrective exercises can be done to alleviate this issue, but it may take several months to fix (provided that the person sits less, stands with a neutral pelvis, and sleeps on their back).

Since lumbar hyperlordosis is usually caused by habitual poor posture, rather than by an inherent physical defect like scoliosis or hyperkyphosis, it can be reversed. This can be accomplished by stretching the lower back, hip-flexors, quads and strengthening the abdominal muscles, hamstrings, and glutes. Strengthening the gluteal complex is a commonly accepted practice to reverse excessive lumbar lordosis, as an increase in gluteal muscle tone assists in the reduction of excessive anterior pelvic tilt and lumbar hyperlordosis. Local intra-articular hip pain has been shown to inhibit gluteal contraction potential, meaning that hip pain could be a main contributing factor to gluteal inhibition. Dancers should ensure that they don&#x27;t strain themselves during dance rehearsals and performances. To help with lifts, the concept of isometric contraction, during which the length of the muscle remains the same during contraction, is important for stability and posture.

Lumbar hyperlordosis may be treated by strengthening the hip extensors on the back of the thighs, and by stretching the hip flexors on the front of the thighs.

Only the muscles on the front and the back of the thighs can rotate the pelvis forward or backward while in a standing position because they can discharge the force on the ground through the legs and feet. Abdominal muscles and erector spinae can&#x27;t discharge force on an anchor point while standing, unless one is holding his hands somewhere, hence their function will be to flex or extend the torso, not the hip.
Back hyper-extensions on a Roman chair or the inflatable ball will strengthen all the posterior chain and will treat hyperlordosis. So too will stiff-legged deadlifts and supine hip lifts and any other similar movement strengthen the posterior chain &quot;without involving the hip flexors&quot; in the front of the thighs. Abdominal exercises could be avoided altogether if they stimulate too much the psoas and the other hip flexors.

Controversy regarding the degree to which manipulative therapy can help a patient still exists. If therapeutic measures reduce symptoms, but not the measurable degree of lordotic curvature, this could be viewed as a successful outcome of treatment, though based solely on subjective data. The presence of measurable abnormality does not automatically equate with a level of reported symptoms.

===Braces===

The Boston brace is a plastic exterior that can be made with a small amount of lordosis to minimize stresses on discs that have experienced herniated discs. In the case where Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS) is responsible, being properly fitted with a customized brace may be a solution to avoid strain and limit the frequency of instability.

===Tai chi===

While not really a &#x27;treatment&#x27;, the martial art of tai chi calls for adjusting the lower back curvature (as well as the rest of the spinal curvatures) through specific re-alignments of the pelvis to the thighs, it&#x27;s referred to in shorthand as &#x27;dropping the tailbone&#x27;. The specifics of the structural change are school specific and are part of the jibengong (essential technique) of these schools. The adjustment is referred to in tai chi literature as &#x27;when the lowest vertebrae are plumb erect...&#x27;

<text>A bowl cut is a simple haircut where the front hair is cut with a straight fringe (see bangs) and the rest of the hair is left longer, the same length all the way around, or else the sides and back are cut to the same short length. It is named so because in medieval times, when it was popular in Europe, a bowl would be placed on the head and then used as a cutting guide to trim the hair.

==History==

Historically, the bowl cut was popular among common European and Asian men, being an easy neat cut done by a non-professional. Indeed, it was done by putting a cooking pot of a fit size to the level of ears, and all hair below the rim was cut or shaved off. In some cultures it was a normal type of haircut. In other cultures the bowl cut was viewed as an attribute of poverty, signifying that the wearer could not afford to visit a barber.

In the United States, the bowl cut was never particularly popular. At least as far back as the 1980s, the cut has been ridiculed by many. It is often mocked via internet memes.

By 2015, the hairstyle was uncommon enough that its use by mass murderer Dylann Roof was considered mildly noteworthy. The Anti-Defamation League has documented its metonymic use by young white supremacists, among whom it represents Roof and his crimes in particular, and white supremacist ideology in general. For example, a neo-Nazi group named itself the &quot;Bowl Patrol&quot; after Roof&#x27;s bowl cut hairstyle; that group remained active as of a July 2020 exposé in the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, five years after Roof&#x27;s Charleston church shooting.

<text>Pesäpallo (; literally meaning &quot;nest ball&quot;, , colloquially known in Finnish as pesis and also referred to as Finnish baseball) is a fast-moving bat-and-ball sport that is often referred to as the national sport of Finland and has some presence in other places including Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia, and Canada&#x27;s northern Ontario (the latter two countries have significant Nordic populations). It is similar to brännboll, rounders, lapta, and baseball.

Pesäpallo, a combination of traditional ball-batting team games and North American baseball, was invented by Lauri &quot;Tahko&quot; Pihkala in the 1920s. It has changed with the times and grown in popularity. On 14 November 1920, it was played the first time at Kaisaniemi Park in Helsinki.

The basic idea of pesäpallo is similar to that of baseball: the offense tries to score by hitting the ball successfully and running through the bases, while the defense tries to put the batter and runners out. One of the most important differences between pesäpallo and baseball is that the ball is pitched vertically, which makes hitting the ball, as well as controlling the power and direction of the hit, much easier. This gives the offensive game more variety, speed, and tactical aspects compared to baseball. The fielding team is forced to counter the batter&#x27;s choices with defensive schemes and anticipation.

The manager has an important role in pesäpallo, leading the offense by giving signals to the players using a multicoloured fan. The defensive team play is directed by the manager&#x27;s orders and hand signals by the fielders.

Pesäpallo was a demonstration sport at the 1952 Summer Olympics, held in Helsinki, Finland.

==Rules==

A regular pesäpallo game is played in two periods of four innings each. A period is won by the team which scores more runs in its offensive half-innings. If the periods are tied, there will be an extra inning; if needed, there is a round (similar to a penalty shoot-out) where each team tries to bring a player home from the third base.

During an inning, both teams take turns playing offense (batting) and defense (fielding).

The defensive team has nine players on the field. The offensive team can use three jokers (similar to designated hitters) during one half-inning in addition to the nine players in the regular batting order. The offensive team can continue batting until three players have been put out or one round of the batting order has been completed without at least two runs scored. The batter and the pitcher face each other in the home base, on opposite sides of the circular plate. The pitch is delivered by throwing the ball directly upwards above the plate, at least one meter over the head of the pitcher.

The batter has three strikes available during their turn at bat. A fair hit does not require the batter to reach base; all three strikes can be used before the batter must reach first base. A pitch counts as a strike if the batter takes a swing at the ball and the umpire rules the pitch legal. When a batter makes a fair hit, unless it is the third strike, the batter does not have to try to advance safely to the first base. However, if the batter hits a foul ball on the third strike and does not try to advance, only that player is out and the runners continue with the next batter.

If the pitcher delivers two bad pitches (ball), the batter is granted a walk to the first base only if all bases are unoccupied. If there are runners on the field, the point runner (the runner at the highest-numbered base) is granted a walk to the next base for the second and all consecutive bad pitches pitched for the same hitter. A pitch can be ruled bad for various reasons, most common ones being that the ball does not fall on the plate or that the pitch is not thrown high enough.

A hit is foul if the ball first touches the field outside of the boundaries, the batter or the runners cannot advance on a foul hit. If a fielder catches the ball before it reaches the ground, the hit is a &quot;catch&quot;, and all runners who tried to advance on that play are caught. Players who have been caught are removed from the field, but they do not count as outs.

The runner reaches safety on a base by touching the base area before the ball is thrown to a fielder in the base. If the ball gets to the base first, the runner is put out and removed from the field. The batter is also put out if the third strike is foul. A runner on a base is forced to advance if the next runner reaches safety on the same base.

The offensive team scores a run when a runner returns safely to the home base after advancing through all three field bases. If a batter advances to the third base on their batted ball, it is a &quot;home run&quot;. He can then stay on the third base and try to score again as a regular runner by reaching the home base on a later play.

==Differences from baseball==

The most significant differences from baseball are:
*The first bounce of the ball is decisive: It must bounce within the play area, and may then roll over a line and still be in play. The back line on the fly counts as a &quot;laiton&quot; (literally &quot;illegal&quot;, a foul ball). The foul lines are also on the sides and the front of the field. So if a player aims high and hits a very hard hit that would be a certain home run in baseball, it is counted as a foul in pesäpallo. This increases the tactical approach. All home runs, therefore, are the &quot;inside-the-park&quot; variety.
*Catching a ball in flight is not an out, but forces all runners advancing at the moment of the catch to attempt to reach the next base. If they succeed they must return to home base with no further consequences (this is called a &quot;haava&quot;, literally &quot;a wound&quot; or simply &quot;koppi&quot;, &quot;a catch&quot;). If they fail to reach the next base, they are out.
*Instead of a &quot;batter&#x27;s box&quot;, the home plate serves as a &quot;pitching plate&quot;, which is round with a diameter of . All other batting team players stand in a semicircle near the batter.
*Players generally have little difficulty hitting the ball, so the main target is not just hitting the ball but selecting a suitable type of hit and directing it correctly. There are many different types of hits used, here are a few examples:
** &quot;Snap (short) hit (&quot;Näppi&quot;):&quot; Normally used for advancing fast runners between bases, aimed to avoid defensive players. Usually hit in such way that the ball takes a hard spin.
** &quot;Fly hit (&quot;Koppilyönti&quot;):&quot; An intentional high hit to be caught, often used to give way for faster runners.
** &quot;High drive (&quot;Kupperi&quot; or &quot;Kumura&quot;):&quot; Aimed to drop to the field between midfield and outfield, with a top spin. Excellent for scoring.
** &quot;Bouncer (&quot;Pomppu&quot;):&quot; Used for advancing fast runners, hit downwards very hard to be bounced right next to the front arc. Aimed towards the base runner is leaving, or to the center. Technically very hard to perform, used only by advanced players.
*A home run is scored if a batter advances to the third base on his own fair hit. After a home run, the runner will stay at third base and can later score an additional point by advancing from third to home base.
*Walking requires fewer invalid pitches. When the field is empty of runners, one invalid pitch grants a walk, otherwise two. After two invalid pitches, each such pitch grants another walk. A walk advances the point runner; if there is a runner at third base, that player shall score.
*A fair hit does not force the batter to advance; he can use all three strikes at bat before he becomes a runner. A pitch counts as a strike, if the batter takes a swing at the ball or if the umpire rules the pitch legal.
*&quot;Force outs&quot; are always outs: if the runner is off the base and the ball is in the control of a defensive player at the next base, the runner is out.
*The bases are not laid in a diamond shape; the players have to &#x27;zig zag&#x27; the court (see chart).
*When entering a base or the home base, the runner only has to cross the line of the base; there are no actual cushion bases like in baseball, only lines in the field showing each base&#x27;s boundaries (a much larger area compared to the bases used in baseball). Similarly, the pitcher or the fielders in the bases do not have any plates to touch to make an out; having only a foot in the base is enough.
*The attacking team uses a colour-coded fan to signal the runners when to move. The fan is multicoloured, held by the coach of the team. Colour sequence is decided prior to the game.

==Players==

The team playing the &quot;defensive half&quot; has nine players in the field. The &quot;pitcher&quot; is positioned in the home base. A &quot;catcher&quot; plays in the infield on the side of the second base. Each of the three bases has its &quot;baseman&quot; and an additional two &quot;shortstops&quot; playing close to the second and third bases. Two &quot;outfielders&quot; cover the outfield. Players can switch their places and position themselves to the field wherever they want. Different positioning is used in different situations, when the defensive team can expect a certain type of hit. This is usually determined by the location of the offensive team&#x27;s point runner. Special tactics could even be made against a certain batter.

The team playing the &quot;offensive half&quot; has nine &quot;batters&quot; and three additional batters known as &quot;jokers&quot; (The term &quot;joker&quot; refers to a wild card rather than a jester). Whereas ordinary batters must bat in a pre-designated batting order, the joker batters are allowed to breach the batting order.

Today, players usually have a specialized role in the batting order depending on their abilities. Fast runners are usually positioned first in the batting order, after which come players who specialize in advancing runners between bases. Next comes a player specializing in scoring runners home. Players from 6 to 9 often form another attacking combination. The jokers are usually a selection of either batting jokers (good hitters specializing in scoring) or runner jokers (fast runners specializing in advancing in the field).

Both teams have a &quot;pelinjohtaja&quot;, lit. &quot;a game leader&quot; or more simply, a manager. The captain of the team – one of the players – tries to beat the other team&#x27;s captain in the &quot;hutunkeitto&quot;, &quot;draw of choice&quot; which determines which team gets to choose whether it will want to start in the offensive or the defensive half. The manager is also akin to a coach and he does not take part in the actual game.

==Playing field==
The infield is pentagonal, long and wide at its widest, and the ball must bounce at least once in the infield to be a valid fair hit. The outfield consists of everything that is fenced in on the playing field&#x27;s lot, including bodies of water at &quot;Vimpelin Veto&quot;, and balls going underneath the fences at &quot;Sotkamon Jymy&quot;. The fields&#x27; dimensions vary dramatically: The distance to center field fencing in the men&#x27;s Superpesis vary from at &quot;Kiteen Pallo -90&quot;, to at Seinäjoen JymyJussit.

The playing fields are most commonly various mixtures of thin dirt comparable to tennis clay courts, sand, and sometimes artificial grass, for instance at &quot;Pesäkarhut&quot;. Normal grass is typically only seen near the outer fences.

Due to the unusual field surfaces, there are no dedicated multi-purpose stadiums among the highest levels&#x27; home fields, neither with association football, international baseball, or otherwise.

==Equipment==

===Helmet===
Each player is required to wear a helmet when playing in an offensive inning. If a player sets at bat without a helmet an out can be marked for the team. Apart from the pitcher and the outfielders, fielders are required to wear helmets.

===Glove===
The glove is used to ease catching the ball when playing a defensive inning. The glove used in pesäpallo differs from the one used in baseball both in characteristics and in appearance, resembling more a hockey goalkeeper&#x27;s glove. The glove is made of leather although some manufacturers use different kinds of synthetic fibers on the back side. The inside of the glove is always made of thick leather and the main differences between gloves lie in the amount and quality of padding, the thickness of the leather, the size of the glove and its shaping.

The ball is caught into the glove&#x27;s cup between the thumb and the index finger. Sometimes, however, the ball hits the palm and a properly designed glove can prevent injuries.

Other devices to catch the ball are not allowed.

===Bat===
The bat is a round, tapered cylinder. Previously the bats used in pesäpallo were made of wood. These were fairly brittle and did not last very long when used to hit such a heavy ball. Now, wooden bats are only used in children&#x27;s games and the bats used in adult&#x27;s games are made of a mixture of glass fiber and carbon fiber.

The biggest differences between bats lie in the weight, center of gravity, flexibility and length. The maximum length of the bat is . When using a children&#x27;s ball the maximum length of the bat is .

The weight of the bat is considered to be its most important property. A typical bat used in top competitions weighs between and . The heaviest bats weigh more than but these are only used by strong players like batting jokers. Junior players typically use bats that weigh less than . The usual diameter for the bat&#x27;s hitting point is .

===Spikes===
The use of spiked shoes—like in running—is not required to play pesäpallo. However, they do help the player substantially in rapid situations, especially when playing on modern artificial grass fields with some sand, which are very slippery to ordinary sport shoes. The artificial turf differs from what is used in football fields.

There are only a few manufacturers producing spikes designed for pesäpallo and many players use normal running spikes. Some shoes have also spikes at the heel but mostly spikes are positioned under the ball of the foot. Usually there are seven spikes in a shoe and they are 3–15 millimeters long. When playing on artificial turf the maximum length of spikes is 6 millimeters.

===Ball===
The ball used in pesäpallo is yellow and has a circumference of . The weight of the ball varies by series:
* Men&#x27;s ball 
* Women&#x27;s ball 
* Junior ball 

==Competing==
The Finnish championship series is known as Superpesis. Both men and women compete in their own series. The second tier is known as &quot;&quot;, the third tier consists of interregional leagues known as &quot;Suomensarja&quot;, and the fourth tier consists of provincial leagues known as &quot;Maakuntasarja&quot;.

An open cup called &quot; was played alongside the various series from 1969-1992.

An annual east-west all-star game called &quot; is played annually, usually in June or early July. The senior main matches field Superpesis players, and other matches under that brand are also played among youth players.

Junior leagues for under-21 players exist for both men and women (known as &quot;Poikien Superpesis&quot; and &quot;Tyttöjen Superpesis&quot; respectively).

A Pesäpallo World Cup is played internationally every three years. In 2006 the fifth World Cup was played in Munich, Germany. Participant countries included Australia, Finland, Germany and Sweden. The sixth World Cup took place from July 8–11, 2009 in Pori, Finland, with teams from Australia, Finland, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. The seventh World Cup took place in 2012 on the Gold Coast of Australia. The three teams were Australia, Finland and &quot;Team Europe&quot;. The eighth World Cup was played in Lucerne, Switzerland in 2015 featuring Australia, Germany, Finland, and Switzerland.

<text>The equity premium puzzle refers to the inability of an important class of economic models to explain the average equity risk premium (ERP) provided by a diversified portfolio of equities over that of government bonds, which has been observed for more than 100 years. There is a significant disparity between returns produced by stocks compared to returns produced by government treasury bills. The equity premium puzzle addresses the difficulty in understanding and explaining this disparity. This disparity is calculated using the equity risk premium:

The equity risk premium is equal to the difference between equity returns and returns from government bonds. It is equal to around 5% to 8% in the United States.

The risk premium represents the compensation awarded to the equity holder for taking on a higher risk by investing in equities rather than government bonds. However, the 5% to 8% premium is considered to be an implausibly high difference and the equity premium puzzle refers to the unexplained reasons driving this disparity.

==Description==

The term was coined by Rajnish Mehra and Edward C. Prescott in a study published in 1985 titled &quot;The Equity Premium: A Puzzle&quot;. An earlier version of the paper was published in 1982 under the title &quot;A test of the intertemporal asset pricing model&quot;. The authors found that a standard general equilibrium model, calibrated to display key U.S. business cycle fluctuations, generated an equity premium of less than 1% for reasonable risk aversion levels. This result stood in sharp contrast with the average equity premium of 6% observed during the historical period.

In 1982, Robert J. Shiller published the first calculation that showed that either a large risk aversion coefficient or counterfactually large consumption variability was required to explain the means and variances of asset returns. Azeredo (2014) shows, however, that increasing the risk aversion level may produce a negative equity premium in an Arrow-Debreu economy constructed to mimic the persistence in U.S. consumption growth observed in the data since 1929.

The intuitive notion that stocks are much riskier than bonds is not a sufficient explanation of the observation that the magnitude of the disparity between the two returns, the equity risk premium (ERP), is so great that it implies an implausibly high level of investor risk aversion that is fundamentally incompatible with other branches of economics, particularly macroeconomics and financial economics.

The process of calculating the equity risk premium, and selection of the data used, is highly subjective to the study in question, but is generally accepted to be in the range of 3–7% in the long-run. Dimson et al. calculated a premium of &quot;around 3–3.5% on a geometric mean basis&quot; for global equity markets during 1900–2005 (2006). However, over any one decade, the premium shows great variability—from over 19% in the 1950s to 0.3% in the 1970s.

In 1997, Siegel found that the actual standard deviation of the 20-year rate of return was only 2.76%. This means that for long-term investors, the risk of holding the stock of a smaller than expected can be derived only by looking at the standard deviation of annual earnings. For long-term investors, the actual risks of fixed-income securities are higher. Through a series of reasoning, the equity premium should be negative.

To quantify the level of risk aversion implied if these figures represented the &quot;expected&quot; outperformance of equities over bonds, investors would prefer a certain payoff of $51,300 to a 50/50 bet paying either $50,000 or $100,000.

The puzzle has led to an extensive research effort in both macroeconomics and finance. So far a range of useful theoretical tools and numerically plausible explanations have been presented, but no one solution is generally accepted by economists.

== Theory ==

The economy has a single representative household whose preferences over stochastic consumption paths are given by:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the subjective discount factor, formula_3 is the per capita consumption at time formula_4, U() is an increasing and concave utility function. In the Mehra and Prescott (1985) economy, the utility function belongs to the constant relative risk aversion class:

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the constant relative risk aversion parameter. Note that formula_7. Weil (1989) replaced the constant relative risk aversion utility function with the Kreps-Porteus nonexpected utility preferences.

:formula_8

The Kreps-Porteus utility function has a constant intertemporal elasticity of substitution and a constant coefficient of relative risk aversion which are not required to be inversely related - a restriction imposed by the constant relative risk aversion utility function. Mehra and Prescott (1985) and Weil (1989) economies are a variations of Lucas (1978) pure exchange economy. In their economies the growth rate of the endowment process, formula_9, follows an ergodic Markov Process.

:formula_10

where formula_11. This assumption is the key difference between Mehra and Prescott&#x27;s economy and Lucas&#x27; economy where the level of the endowment process follows a Markov Process.

There is a single firm producing the perishable consumption good. At any given time formula_4, the firm&#x27;s output must be less than or equal to formula_13 which is stochastic and follows formula_14. There is only one equity share held by the representative household.

We work out the intertemporal choice problem. This leads to:

:formula_15

as the fundamental equation.

For computing stock returns

:formula_16

where

:formula_17

gives the result.

The derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the percentage of stock held must equal zero to satisfy necessary conditions for optimality under the assumptions of no arbitrage and the law of one price.

==Data==
Much data exists that says that stocks have higher returns. For example, Jeremy Siegel says that stocks in the United States have returned 6.8% per year over a 130-year period.

Proponents of the capital asset pricing model say that this is due to the higher beta of stocks, and that higher-beta stocks should return even more.

Others have criticized that the period used in Siegel&#x27;s data is not typical, or the country is not typical.

== Possible explanations ==
A large number of explanations for the puzzle have been proposed. These include:
* Rare events hypothesis,
* Myopic loss aversion, 
* rejection of the Arrow-Debreu model in favor of different models,
* modifications to the assumed preferences of investors,
* imperfections in the model of risk aversion, 
* the excess premium for the risky assets equation results when assuming exceedingly low consumption/income ratios,
* and a contention that the equity premium does not exist: that the puzzle is a statistical illusion.
Kocherlakota (1996), Mehra and Prescott (2003) present a detailed analysis of these explanations in financial markets and conclude that the puzzle is real and remains unexplained. Subsequent reviews of the literature have similarly found no agreed resolution.

The mystery of stock premiums occupies a special place in financial and economic theories, and more progress is needed to understand the spread of stocks on bonds. Over time, as well as to determine the factors driving equity premium in various countries / regions may still be active research agenda.

A 2023 paper by Edward McQuarrie argues the equity risk premium may not exist, at least not as is commonly understood, and is furthermore based on data from a too narrow a time period in the late 20th century. He argues a more detailed examination of historical data finds &quot;over multi-decade periods, sometimes stocks outperformed bonds, sometimes bonds outperformed stocks and sometimes they performed about the same. New international data confirm this pattern. Asset returns in the US in the 20th century do not generalize.&quot;

=== The equity premium: a deeper puzzle ===

Azeredo (2014) showed that traditional pre-1930 consumption measures understate the extent of serial correlation in the U.S. annual real growth rate of per capita consumption of non-durables and services (&quot;consumption growth&quot;). Under alternative measures proposed in the study, the serial correlation of consumption growth is found to be positive. This new evidence implies that an important subclass of dynamic general equilibrium models studied by Mehra and Prescott (1985) generates negative equity premium for reasonable risk-aversion levels, thus further exacerbating the equity premium puzzle.

=== Rare events hypothesis ===

One possible solution to the equity premium puzzle considered by Julliard and Ghosh (2008) is whether it can be explained by the rare events hypothesis, founded by Rietz (1988). They hypothesized that extreme economic events such as the Great Depression, the World Wars and the Great Financial Crisis resulted in equity holders demanding high equity premiums to account for the possibility of the significant loss they could suffer if these events were to materialise. As such, when these extreme economic events do not occur, equity holders are rewarded with higher returns. However, Julliard and Ghosh concluded that rare events are unlikely to explain the equity premium puzzle because the Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Model was rejected by their data and much greater risk aversion levels were required to explain the equity premium puzzle. Moreover, extreme economic events affect all assets (both equity and bonds) and they all yield low returns. For example, the equity premium persisted during the Great Depression, and this suggests that an even greater catastrophic economic event is required, and it must be one which only affect stocks, not bonds.

=== Myopic loss aversion ===

Benartzi &amp; Thaler (1995) contend that the equity premium puzzle can be explained by myopic loss aversion and their explanation is based on Kahneman and Tversky&#x27;s prospect theory. They rely on two assumptions about decision-making to support theory; loss aversion and mental accounting. Loss aversion refers to the assumption that investors are more sensitive to losses than gains, and in fact, research calculates utility of losses felt by investors to be twice that of the utility of a gain. The second assumption is that investors frequently evaluate their stocks even when the purpose of the investment is to fund retirement or other long-term goals. This makes investors more risk averse compared to if they were evaluating their stocks less frequently. Their study found that the difference between returns gained from stocks and returns gained from bonds decrease when stocks are evaluated less frequently. The two combined creates myopic loss aversion and Benartzi &amp; Thaler concluded that the equity premium puzzle can be explained by this theory.

=== Individual characteristics ===

Some explanations rely on assumptions about individual behavior and preferences different from those made by Mehra and Prescott. Examples include the prospect theory model of Benartzi and Thaler (1995) based on loss aversion. A problem for this model is the lack of a general model of portfolio choice and asset valuation for prospect theory.

A second class of explanations is based on relaxation of the optimization assumptions of the standard model. The standard model represents consumers as continuously-optimizing dynamically-consistent expected-utility maximizers. These assumptions provide a tight link between attitudes to risk and attitudes to variations in intertemporal consumption which is crucial in deriving the equity premium puzzle. Solutions of this kind work by weakening the assumption of continuous optimization, for example by supposing that consumers adopt satisficing rules rather than optimizing. An example is info-gap decision theory, based on a non-probabilistic treatment of uncertainty, which leads to the adoption of a robust satisficing approach to asset allocation.

=== Equity characteristics ===

Another explanation of the equity premium puzzle focuses on the characteristics of equity that cannot be captured by typical models but are still consistent with optimisation by investors.

The most significant characteristic that is not typically considered is the requirement for equity holders to monitor their activity and have a manager to assist them. Therefore, the principal-agent relationship is very prevalent between corporation managers and equity holders. If an investor was to choose to not have a manager, it is likely costly for them to monitor the activity of the corporations that they invest in and often rely heavily on auditors or they look to the market hypothesis in which information about asset values in the equity markets are exposed. This hypothesis is based on the theory that an investor who is inexperienced and uninformed can bank on the fact that they will get average market returns in an identifiable market portfolio, which is questionable as to whether or not this can be done by an uninformed investor. Although, as per the characteristics of equity in explaining the premium, it is only necessary to hypothesise that people looking to invest do not think they can reach the same level of performance of the market.

Another explanation related to the characteristics of equity was explored by a variety of studies including Holmstrom and Tirole (1998), Bansal and Coleman (1996) and Palomino(1996)and was in relation to liquidity. Palomino described the noise trader model that was thin and had imperfect competition is the market for equities and the lower its equilibrium price dropped the higher the premium over risk-free bonds would rise. Holmstrom and Tirole in their studies developed another role for liquidity in the equity market that involved firms willing to pay a premium for bonds over private claims when they would be facing uncertainty over liquidity needs.

=== Tax distortions ===

Another explanation related to the observed growing equity premium was argued by McGrattan and Prescott (2001) to be a result of variations over time of taxes and particularly its effect on interest and dividend income. It is difficult however to give credibility to this analysis due to the difficulties in calibration utilised as well as ambiguity surrounding the existence of any noticeable equity premium before 1945. Even given this, it is evident that the observation that equity premium changes arising from the distortion of taxes over time should be taken into account and give more validity to the equity premium itself.

Related data is mentioned in the Handbook of the Equity Risk Premium. Beginning in 1919, it captured the post-World War I recovery, while omitting wartime losses and low pre-war returns. After adding these earlier years, the arithmetic average of the British stock premium for the entire 20th century is 6.6%, which is about 21/4% lower than the incorrect data inferred from 1919-1999.

=== Implied volatility ===

Graham and Harvey have estimated that, for the United States, the expected average premium during the period June 2000 to November 2006 ranged between 4.65 and 2.50. They found a modest correlation of 0.62 between the 10-year equity premium and a measure of implied volatility (in this case VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index).

Dennis, Mayhew &amp; Stivers (2006) find that changes in implied volatility have an asymmetric effect on stock returns. They found that negative changes in implied volatility have a stronger impact on stock returns than positive changes in implied volatility. The authors argue that such an asymmetric volatility effect can be explained by the fact that investors are more concerned with downside risk than upside potential. That is, investors are more likely to react to negative news and expect negative changes in implied volatility to have a stronger impact on stock returns. The authors also find that changes in implied volatility can predict future stock returns. Stocks that experience negative changes in implied volatility have higher expected returns in the future. The authors state that this relationship is caused by the association between negative changes in implied volatility and market downturns.

Yan (2011) presents an explanation for the equity premium puzzle using the slope of the implied volatility smile. The implied volatility smile refers to the pattern of implied volatilities for options contracts with the same expiration date but different strike prices. The slope of the implied volatility smile reflects the market&#x27;s expectations for future changes in the stock price, with a steeper slope indicating higher expected volatility.
The author shows that the slope of the implied volatility smile is a significant predictor of stock returns, even after controlling for traditional risk factors. Specifically, stocks with steeper implied volatility smiles (i.e., higher jump risk) have higher expected returns, consistent with the equity premium puzzle. The author argues that this relationship between the slope of the implied volatility smile and stock returns can be explained by investors&#x27; preference for jump risk. Jump risk refers to the risk of sudden, large movements in the stock price, which are not fully captured by traditional measures of volatility. Yan argues that investors are willing to accept lower average returns on stocks that have higher jump risk, because they expect to be compensated with higher returns during times of market stress.

=== Information derivatives ===

The simplest scientific interpretation of the puzzle suggests that consumption optimization is not responsible for the equity premium. More precisely, the timeseries of aggregate consumption is not a leading explanatory factor of the equity premium.

The human brain is (simultaneously) engaged in many strategies. Each of these strategies has a goal. While individually rational, the strategies are in constant competition for limited resources. Even within a single person this competition produces a highly complex behavior which does not fit any simple model.

Nevertheless, the individual strategies can be understood. In finance this is equivalent to understanding different financial products as information derivatives i.e. as products which are derived from all the relevant information available to the customer. If the numerical values for the equity premium are unknown, the rational examination of the equity product would have accurately predicted the observed ballpark values.

From the information derivatives viewpoint consumption optimization is just one possible goal (which never really comes up in practice in its pure academic form). To a classically trained economist this may feel like a loss of a fundamental principle. But it may also be a much needed connection to reality (capturing the real behavior of live investors). Viewing equities as a stand-alone product (information derivative) does not isolate them from the wider economic picture. Equity investments survive in competition with other strategies. The popularity of equities as an investment strategy demands an explanation. In terms of data this means that the information derivatives approach needs to explain not just the realized equities performance but also the investor-expected equity premia. The data suggest the long-term equity investments have been very good at delivering on the theoretical expectations. This explains the viability of the strategy in addition to its performance (i.e. in addition to the equity premium).

=== Market failure explanations ===

Two broad classes of market failure have been considered as explanations of the equity premium.

First, problems of adverse selection and moral hazard may result in the absence of markets in which individuals can insure themselves against systematic risk in labor income and noncorporate profits.

Second, transaction costs or liquidity constraints may prevent individuals from smoothing consumption over time. In relation to transaction costs, there are significantly greater costs associated with trading stocks than trading bonds. These include costs to acquire information, broker fees, taxes, load fees and the bid-ask spread. As such, when shareholders attempt to capitalise on the equity premium by adjusting their asset allocation and purchasing more stocks, they incur significant trading costs which eliminate the gains from the equity premium. However, Kocherlakota (1996) contends that there is insufficient evidence to support this proposition and further data about the size and sources of trading costs need to be collected before this proposition could be validated.

=== Denial of equity premium ===

A final possible explanation is that there is no puzzle to explain: that there is no equity premium. This can be argued from a number of ways, all of them being different forms of the argument that we don&#x27;t have enough statistical power to distinguish the equity premium from zero:
* Selection bias of the US market in studies. The US market was the most successful stock market in the 20th century. Other countries&#x27; markets displayed lower long-run returns (but still with positive equity premiums). Picking the best observation (US) from a sample leads to upwardly biased estimates of the premium.
*Survivorship bias of exchanges: This refers to the equity holder&#x27;s fear about an economic crash such as the 1929 stock market crash eventuating, even when the probability of that event occurring is minute. The justification here is that over half of the stock exchanges that were operating in early 1900s were discontinued, and the equity risk premium calculated does not account for this. As such, the equity risk premium is &quot;calculated for a survivor&quot; such that if returns from these stock exchanges were included in the calculations, there may not have been such a great disparity between returns gleaned from bonds compared to stocks. However, this hypothesis cannot be easily proven and Mehra and Prescott (1985) in their studies, included the effect on the equity returns following the Great Depression. Although shares lost 80% of their value, comparisons of returns from stocks against bonds showed that even in those periods, significantly higher returns were gained from investing in stocks.
*Low number of data points: the period 1900–2005 provides only 105 years which is not a large enough sample size to run statistical analyses with full confidence, especially in view of the black swan effect.
*Windowing: returns of equities (and relative returns) vary greatly depending on which points are included. Using data starting from the top of the market in 1929 or starting from the bottom of the market in 1932 (leading to estimates of equity premium of 1% lower per year), or ending at the top in 2000 (vs. bottom in 2002) or top in 2007 (vs. bottom in 2009 or beyond) completely change the overall conclusion. However, in all windows considered, the equity premium is always greater than zero.
A related criticism is that the apparent equity premium is an artifact of observing stock market bubbles in progress.
*David Blitz, head of Quant Research at Robeco, suggested that the size of the equity premium is not as large as widely believed. It is usually calculated, he said, on the presumption that the true risk-free asset is the one month T bill. If one recalculates, taking the five-year T-bond as the risk free asset, the equity premium is smaller and the risk-return relation becomes more positive.

Note however that most mainstream economists agree that the evidence shows substantial statistical power. Benartzi &amp; Thaler analyzed the equity returns over a 200-year period, between 1802 and 1990 and found that whilst equity returns were remained stable between 5.5% and 6.5%, return on government bonds fell significantly from around 5% to 0.5%. Moreover, analysis of how faculty members funded their retirement showed that people who had invested in stocks received much higher returns than people who had invested in government bonds.

== Implications ==

Implications for the Individual Investor

For the individual investor, the equity premium may represent a reasonable reward for taking on the risk of buying shares such that they base their decisions to allocate assets to shares or bonds depending on how risk tolerant or risk averse they are. On the other hand, if the investor believes that the equity premium arise from mistakes and fears, they would capitalize on that fear and mistake and invest considerable portions of their assets in shares. Here, it is prudent to note that economists more commonly allocate significant portions of their asset in shares.

Currently, the equity premium is estimated to be 3%. Although this is lower than historical rates, it is still significantly more advantageous than bonds for investors investing in their retirements funds and other long-term funds.

The magnitude of the equity premium brings about substantial implications for policy, welfare and also resource allocation.

Policy and Welfare Implications

Campbell and Cochrane (1995) have found in a study of a model that simulates equity premium value&#x27;s consistent with asset prices, welfare costs are similar in magnitude to welfare benefits. Therefore essentially, a large risk premium in society where asset prices are a reflection of consumer preferences, implies that the cost of welfare is also large. It also means that in recessions, welfare costs are excessive regardless of aggregate consumption. As the equity premium rises, recession-state income marginal values steadily increase also thus further increasing the welfare costs of recessions. This also brings about questions regarding the need for microeconomic policies that operate by way of higher productivity in the long run by trading off short-term pain in the form of adjustment costs. Given the impact on welfare through recessions and the large equity premium, it is evident that these short-term trade offs as a result of economic policy are likely not ideal, and would be preferred to take place in times of normal economic activity.

Resource Allocation

When there is a large risk premium associated with equity, there is a high cost of systematic risk in returns. One of these being its potential implications on individual portfolio decisions. Some research has argued that high rates of return are just signs of misplaced risk-aversion in which investors are able to earn high returns with little risk from switching from stocks to other assets such as bonds. Research on the contrary indicates that a large percentage of the general public believe that the stock market is best for investors that are in it for the long haul and may also link to another implication being trends in the equity premium. Some claims have been made that the equity premium has declined over time in the past few years and may be supported by other studies claiming that tax declines may also continue to reduce the premium and the fact that transaction costs in securities markets decline this is consistent with a declining premium. The trend implication is also supported by models such as &#x27;noise traders&#x27; that create a cyclical premium due to noise traders being excessively optimistic thus declining the premium, and vice versa when the optimism is replaced with pessimism, this would explain the constant decline of equity premium as a stock price bubble.

<text>Cornrows (also called canerows) are a style of three-strand braids in which the hair is braided very close to the scalp, using an underhand, upward motion to make a continuous, raised row. Cornrows are often done in simple, straight lines, as the term implies, but they can also be styled in elaborate geometric or curvilinear designs. They are considered a traditional hairstyle in many African cultures, as well as in the African diaspora. They are distinct from, but may resemble, box braids, Dutch braids, melon coiffures, and other forms of plaited hair, and are typically tighter than braids used in other cultures.

The name &quot;cornrows&quot; refers to the layout of crops in corn and sugar cane fields in the Americas and Caribbean, where enslaved Africans were displaced during the Atlantic slave trade. According to Black folklore, cornrows were often used to communicate on the Underground Railroad and by Benkos Biohó during his time as a slave in Colombia. They often serve as a form of Black self-expression, especially among African Americans, but have been stigmatized in some cultures. Cornrows are traditionally called &quot;kolese&quot; or &quot;irun didi&quot; in Yoruba, and are often nicknamed &quot;didi braids&quot; in the Nigerian diaspora.

Cornrows are worn by both sexes, and are sometimes adorned with beads, shells, or hair cuffs. The duration of braiding cornrows may take up to five hours, depending on the quantity and width. Often favored for their easy maintenance, cornrows can be left in for weeks at a time if maintained through careful washing of the hair and natural oiling of the scalp. Braids are considered a protective styling on African curly hair as they allow for easy and restorative growth; braids pulled too tightly or worn for longer lengths of time and on different hair types can cause a type of hair loss known as traction alopecia.

== History ==
===Africa===

Modern cornrows originated in Africa, where they likely developed in response to the unique textures of African hair, and have held significance for different cultures throughout recorded history. Early depictions of women with what appear to be cornrows have been found in Stone Age paintings in the Tassili Plateau of the Sahara, and have been dated as far back as 3000 B.C. A similar style is also seen in depictions of the ancient Cushitic people of the Horn of Africa, who appear to be wearing this style of braids as far back as 2000 B.C. In Nubia, the remains of a young girl wearing cornrows has been dated to 550–750 A.D. Cornrows have also been documented in the ancient Nok civilization in Nigeria, in the Mende culture of Sierra Leone, and the Dan culture of the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. 

Women in West Africa have been attested wearing complex hairstyles of threaded or wrapped braids since at least the 18th century. These practices likely influenced the use of cornrows and headwraps (such as durags) among enslaved Africans taken to the Americas. In Ethiopia and Eritrea, there are many braided hairstyles which may include cornrows or &quot;shuruba&quot;, such as Habesha or Albaso braids, and Tigray shuriba. Though such hairstyles have always been popular with women, Ethiopian men have also worn such hairstyles. In 19th century Ethiopia, male warriors and kings such as Tewodros II and Yohannes IV were depicted wearing braided hairstyles, including the shuruba.

Cornrow hairstyles in Africa also cover a wide social terrain: religion, kinship, status, age, racial diversity, and other attributes of identity can all be expressed in hairstyle. Just as important is the act of braiding, which passes on cultural values between generations, expresses bonds between friends, and establishes the role of professional practitioner. Braiding is traditionally a social ritual in many African cultures—as is hairstyling in general—and is often performed communally, as White and White explain:

===Europe===
There have been a number of examples of European art and sculpture described as similar to modern cornrows, such as plaits, the melon coiffure and sini crenes.

The oldest of these depictions are the statues known as the Venus of Brassempouy and the Venus of Willendorf, which date between 23,000 and 29,000 years ago and were found in modern day France and Austria. Whether these statues feature cornrows, another type of braids, headdresses, or some other styling has been a matter of vigorous debate — most historians rule out cornrows, however. The Venus of Brassempouy is often said to wear a wig or a patterned hood, while the Venus of Willendorf is said to be wearing plaited hair or a fibrous cap.

Since the early 5th century B.C., Ancient Greek and Roman art shows men and women with a characteristic melon coiffure, especially in the &quot;Oriental Aphrodite&quot; tradition, which may be confused with cornrows. The traditional hairstyle of Roman Vestal Virgins, the sini crenes, also incorporates two braids that resemble cornrows.

===Americas===
The first recorded use of the word &quot;cornrow&quot; was in America in 1769, referring to the corn fields of the Americas. The earliest recorded use of the term &quot;cornrows&quot; to refer a hairstyle was in 1902. The name &quot;canerows&quot; may be more common in parts of the Caribbean due to the historic role of sugar plantations in the region.

As in Africa, grooming was a social activity for Black people on the American plantations; the enslaved Africans were reported helping each other style their hair into a wide variety of appearances. On his visit to a plantation in Natchez, Mississippi, New Englander Joseph lngraham wrote, &quot;No scene can be livelier or more interesting to a Northerner, than that which the negro quarters of a well regulated plantation present, on a Sabbath morning, just before church hour.&quot; Hairstyles were so characteristic of a person, even when their appearance and behaviour was otherwise heavily regulated, that they were often used to identify runaways, and enslaved Africans sometimes had their hair shaved as a form of punishment. Generally, however, slaveholders in the British colonies gave their Black slaves a degree of latitude in how they wore their hair. Thus, wearing traditional hairstyles offered a way to assert their bodily autonomy when they otherwise had none. 

Enslaved Black people may have chosen to wear cornrows to keep their hair neat and flat to their scalp while working; the other styles they developed alongside cornrows blended African, European and Native American trends and traditions. African-American, Afro-Latino and Caribbean folklore also relates multiple stories of cornrows being used to communicate or provide maps for slaves across the &quot;New World&quot;. Today, such styles retain their link with Black self-expression and creativity, and may also serve as a form of political expression.

Cornrows gained in popularity in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, and again during the 1990s and 2000s. In the 2000s, some athletes wore cornrows, including NBA basketball players Allen Iverson, Rasheed Wallace, and Latrell Sprewell. Some female mixed martial artists have chosen to wear cornrows for their fights as it prevents their hair from obscuring their vision as they move.

== Attitudes to cornrows ==

Colonial attitudes and practices towards Black hairstyles have traditionally been used to reinforce racism, exclusion and inequality. For example, during the 18th century, slaves would sometimes have their hair shaved as a lesser form of punishment. Eurocentric beauty standards, which often denigrate Black hairstyles, can lead to internalized racism, colorism, and marginalization, which negatively affect Black people—and Black women in particular. Related valuations of hair texture—which portray straighter hair as &quot;good hair&quot; and curlier hair as &quot;bad hair&quot;—are emphasized through the media, advertising, and popular culture. These attitudes to hair can devalue African heritage and lead to discrimination. The unique type of discrimination that arises from prejudice towards Black women&#x27;s hair is called &quot;natural hair discrimination.&quot; Despite these challenges, cornrows have gained popularity among Black people as a way to express their Blackness, creativity and individuality. 

Over the decades, cornrows, alongside dreadlocks, have been the subject of several disputes in U.S. workplaces, as well as universities and schools. Some employers and educational institutions have considered cornrows unsuitable or &quot;unprofessional&quot;, and have banned them. Employees and civil rights groups have countered that such attitudes evidence cultural bias or racism, and some disputes have resulted in litigation. In 1981, Renee Rogers sued American Airlines for their policy which banned cornrows and other braided hairstyles. Other cases, such as Mitchell vs Marriott Hotel and Pitts vs. Wild Adventures, soon followed. Since other traditional Black hairstyles are also often banned, Black women may be forced to straighten their hair or emulate European hairstyles at significant additional cost. The intersection of racialized and gendered discrimination against Black women is often called misogynoir. In California, the CROWN Act was passed in 2019 to prohibit discrimination based on hair style and hair texture.

In 2011, the High Court of the United Kingdom, in a decision reported as a test case, ruled against a school&#x27;s decision to refuse entry to a student with cornrows. The school claimed this was part of its policy mandating &quot;short back and sides&quot; haircuts, and banning styles that might be worn as indicators of gang membership. However, the court ruled that the student was expressing a tradition and that such policies, while possibly justifiable in certain cases (e.g. skinhead gangs), had to accommodate reasonable racial diversities and cultural practices.

In some African nations, regularly changing hairstyles can be seen as a sign of social status for a woman, while advertising continues to promote straighter hairstyles as fashionable. Braids provide a way for women to maintain their hair, and are sometimes used with Chinese or Indian wigs to rotate hairstyles.

<text>Melissa &quot;Mel&quot; Bampton is an Australian radio announcer, best known for her work on the Triple J network.
She began at the station in 2000 as producer of the &quot;Drive&quot; show - with Costa Zouliou, Myf Warhurst, Nicole Fossati and Charlie Pickering at various times. In mid-2002, Fossati left the station, and Bampton took her place as co-host.

==Career==
In 2004 the station&#x27;s programming underwent major changes, and Bampton started hosting her own music show &quot;Mel in the Mornings&quot;. The show replaced the previous &quot;Morning Show&quot;, which was heavily current affairs and talkback, with a more music oriented show, including interviews and live performances. Mel was the creator of the Like a Version segment of bands playing cover songs, which has spawned nine CDs and continues on the triple j breakfast program to this day.

On 26 January 2007, Mel finished her role as a triple j presenter. In late 2007 Mel presented and produced the 2nd Producer Series for triple j, which featured: Steve Albini (Nirvana, PJ Harvey, Joanna Newsom), Michael Beinhorn (Hole, Marlilyn Manson, The Bronx), Trina Shoemaker (Queens Of The Stoneage, Something For Kate), Jim Abbiss (Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian), Tony Cohen (Nick Cave, Beasts of Bourbon), Squeak E Clean (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Ben Lee), Ewan Pearson (The Rapture), Dave Catching (Rancho De La Luna - The Desert Sessions) Tim Whitten (Architecture In Helsinki, The Panics) and John Agnello (Dinosaur Jr, Sonic Youth, The Living End).

In 2008, Bampton produced and presented &quot;The Album Series&quot; for triple j which took a look at four outstanding Australian Albums, by artists: Sarah Blasko, The Living End, Hoodoo Gurus and Regurgitator. The Album Series featured on triple j in late 2008.

Bampton produced and presented the third season of The Producer Series, which aired on Triple J in 2009. The third series featured Alan Moulder (Nine Inch Nails, The Killers, Wolfmother), Scott Horscroft (The Panics, Sleepy Jackson), Dave Fridmann (Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, Sleater Kinney), Harry Vanda (AC/DC, British India, The Angels), Philippe Zdar (Cassius, Phoenix, Cut Copy) and Diplo (MIA, Santigold, Major Lazer). A print version of &quot;The Producer Series&quot; is set for release through Harper Collins in 2015.

Bampton was the Music &amp; Books Editor for &#x27;alternative mainstream&#x27; women&#x27;s magazine &quot;yen&quot; between 2008 and 2012, and is also the Director of a Byron Bay-based media company that works with Soundwave Festival, and musical artists Ash Grunwald and Dune Rats.

==Personal life==
Bampton is married, and has three children - Jazzy, Tiger and Obi - the youngest being born in 2012.

Bampton is also a full-time Yoga Therapist and teacher, studying and instructing under her married name &#x27;Lissie Turner&#x27; at The Yoga Shack. She was trained by Dr Natesan Chanderasekaran MD and Lance Schuler. Bampton has been practicing yoga since 1995.

<text>Lauri &quot;Tahko&quot; Pihkala (born Gummerus, 5 January 1888 – 20 May 1981) was the inventor of pesäpallo, the Finnish variant of baseball. He was born in the vicarage of Pihtipudas, the son of the minister Alexander Gummerus. In 1969 he became one of the first persons to receive an honorary doctorate in Sport Sciences from the University of Jyväskylä, together with president Urho Kekkonen and Professor Kaarina Kari.

== Athletics ==

In the 1910s, he became the first Finnish professional coach in athletics and also worked as a physical education instructor with the Finnish Army.

Pihkala was known for being an avid sports fan, and he developed several outdoor games.

== Other ==

During the Finnish Civil War, he was responsible for propaganda in the White Guard flying unit &quot;Devils of Kuhmoinen&quot; of major Hans Kalm.

Pihkala&#x27;s brother Martti Pihkala was a right-wing political activist. Lauri Pihkala didn&#x27;t write any political texts in his publications. He tried to integrate the Finnish working class into society and hoped that sports could be one tool there.

Some writers have claimed that Pihkala took part in the massacre in Harmoinen village in March 1918. Others claim that while the murderers indeed belonged to Devils of Kuhmoinen, Pihkala was not present at the time of the massacre.

Memorial of Pihkala by sculptor Nina Sailo was unveiled in 1988 on the south-east side of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium.

Pihkala was a supporter of eugenics with the goal of strengthening Finland’s military.

<text>The Cyropaedia, sometimes spelled Cyropedia, is a partly fictional biography of Cyrus the Great, the founder of Persia&#x27;s Achaemenid Empire. It was written around 370 BC by Xenophon, the Athenian-born soldier, historian, and student of Socrates. The Latinized title &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;Kúrou paideía&quot; (), meaning The Education of Cyrus. Aspects of it would become a model for medieval writers of the genre mirrors for princes. In turn, the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; strongly influenced the most well-known but atypical of these, Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot;, which fostered the rejection of medieval political thinking and development of modern politics.

==Format==
In substance, the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; is a narrative describing the education of the ideal ruler. It has been interpreted as an early novel, a biography, and a manifesto on leadership. The work is intended to communicate political and moral instruction to its audience, most of whom would have been Athenian elites.

While most scholars note that Xenophon did not write it as a historical text, the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; does not fit into any known classical genre, only somewhat resembling an early novel. Its validity as a source of Achaemenid history has been repeatedly questioned, and numerous descriptions of events or persons have been found inaccurate.

Despite its limitations, it has been argued that the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; provides a glimpse of Cyrus the Great&#x27;s character. It gives an artistic portrayal of Cyrus, which, according to some, could not have been so positive without a historical memory of good leadership. Xenophon (c. 431 – 355 BC) was not a contemporary of Cyrus (c. 580 – 530 BC) and it is likely that some of his information about Persia was based on events that occurred at the later Achaemenid court. Xenophon had visited such as one of the &quot;Ten Thousand&quot; Greek soldiers who fought on the losing side of a Persian civil war, which he recounted in his &quot;Anabasis&quot;.

== Synopsis ==

=== Book One ===
(1) The work begins with a discourse on the unprecedentedly large and diverse empire built by Cyrus the Great. After an overview of Persian society, Xenophon begins the biographical section when Cyrus is twelve years old. Cyrus&#x27;s mother Mandane receives a message from her father Astyages, King of the Medes, requesting that she and her son visit him in Media. Introduced to his grandfather, Cyrus notes how the luxurious clothing and behavior of the Medes differ from the simpler customs of Persia. Mandane and Cyrus stay in the kingdom for a bit, and the boy learns the traditions of the Medes and forms a good relationship with Astyages. When Mandane is ready to go back to Persia, which is a vassal under the Medes, to see her husband, her father wants Cyrus to stay. Mandane is against the idea, but lets Cyrus make his own choice. Cyrus decides to stay, stating that he has more to learn from the Medes.

Growing up in Media Cyrus gains a following of companions that he trains with. He also goes hunting with them, but they are limited on what they can hunt to keep them safe due to their ages. This does not sit well with Cyrus who begs his uncle, Cyaxares, to take him hunting. His uncle refuses at first but agrees later on. While hunting with Cyaxare, Cyrus comes upon dangerous animals that he risks his life to give his game to Astyages out of the love he has for him. Astyages rejects the gifts telling Cyrus that no gift could be worth endangering his life over.

During this time the King of Assyria is getting married. To celebrate he assembles a huge group of people to go hunting between the borders of the Assyrian and Median empires. Arriving at the hunting spot, the Assyrian King realized he had a massive host to raid the Medes&#x27; borders. Astyages summoned his armies in response to the Assyrians pillaging his lands. Even though Cyrus was too young to fight he could not contain himself and joined his grandfather on the march. The Median force comes across a host of Assyrians carrying away stolen goods. Astyages is hesitant to send in his troops for fear of enemy cavalry countercharging them. Cyrus suggests that Cyaxares should lead a small cavalry division to intercept the foot soldiers carrying the loot. If the enemy cavalry tries to reinforce the infantry, Astyages&#x27;s troops rush in to stop them. The plan works with the Medes pushing back the Assyrians. Astyages gives the victory to Cyrus but mentions how his strategy was one of madness.

Cyrus&#x27;s reputation from the battle spreads throughout the empire. His father, Cambyses I, hears of his son&#x27;s achievements and calls him back home to Persia. On his return, Cyrus is welcomed back with open arms. His friends thought he would have come back as a luxurious Medes but instead he returns as a simple Persian. He spends his time in Persia until he becomes a young man, learning and training in military traditions.

Astyages passes away and Cyaxares becomes ruler over the Median empire. The Assyrian King at the same time is going around conquering his neighbors. He looks to the Medes and Persians, convincing his allies that the two empires are a threat. Together with their allies, the Assyrians commanded over 60,000 horsemen and 200,000 archers and targeteers. Cyaxares knew of their plans and sent word to Persia asking for Cyrus to bring reinforcements. Cyrus assembles 10,000 archers, 10,000 slingers, and 10,000 targeteers. Before marching off to war he gives his army a speech promising them victory against their enemies.

=== Book Two ===
(2)Cyrus and Cambyses meet up with Cyaxares&#x27;s forces. After discussing scouting reports, army sizes, and strategy they are heavily at a disadvantage. The biggest one is their army size of 100,000 troops, 10,000 horsemen and 60,000 archers and targeteers coming from the Medes, against the enemies&#x27; army size of 260,000. Being so outnumbered Cyrus mentions that they cannot win by a war of attrition. He realizes that if he cannot win with numbers then he can win with a better-quality army. He states that the common tactic of warfare is lightly armored range units, so he decides to refit his army to be more of a heavy melee army. His troops receive a corslet for the breast, a shield for the left arm, and a sword or battle-axe for the right hand.

The Persian army is trained by Cyrus in melee combat. He issues military reforms like ordering the soldiers of units to live together to form a bond with each other. Not giving soldiers food until they completed all their workouts. How hard the soldier works determines their rewards. Meetings are held with his officers to learn about the army&#x27;s progress. Cyrus is informed of the difficulty the army is having with learning new tactics but they are improving. The rest of Book II focuses on Cyrus and his captains&#x27; thoughts on the new recruits. Some of the captains believe that time is needed for the recruits to settle into their positions. The other captains agree but do not think there is enough time for the recruits to be ready for battle.

=== Book Three ===
(3)The Persian army heads toward the Armenian Kingdom to collect the tribute owed to the Medes. The King of Armenia gathers his army to confront the Persians but flees when he learns of Cyrus leading the army. The King takes refuge high up in the mountains. Cyrus responds by surrounding the exit points with his army and captures the King&#x27;s family and his treasure. He sends messengers to the located villages telling them that he considers them an enemy if they stay in their homes. Messengers are also sent to the King telling him to come to meet with Cyrus. Eventually, the King meets with Cyrus who puts the King on trial for abandoning his agreement with the Medes. The King&#x27;s reasoning for not honoring the agreement was to gain freedom for his people. He still accepts any punishment given until his son, Tigranes, pleads with Cyrus to spare his father. Tigranes tries to convince Cyrus that his father is valuable as an ally and that his father learns from his folly. An argument sprues out between the two about if a person can learn from their follies in such a short time. However, Cyrus grants the Tigranes his wish but is happy that he gained another ally.

Cyrus returns everything he captures back to the King asking what his wealth and power are. The King tells Cyrus he has 8,000 horsemen, 40,000 archers and targeteers, and over 3,000 silver talents. Cyrus strikes a deal to take half of the Armenian army to add to his own. Also making the King pay 100 talents of silver to both Cyrus and the Medes. The Persian army heads off with their detachment of Armenian forces led by Tigranes to deal with the Chaldaeans who are at war with the Armenians. While at the border of the two nations, Cyrus looks for a spot to build a fort to gain control over the area. He comes across a mountain range known for the Chaldaeans to use as a scouting position. Rather than conquering the enemy, Cyrus wants to end the conflict between the Armenians and the Chaldaeans. However, Cyrus does not want to wait for peace talks and charges up the hill to capture the high ground. Chaldaean scouts see his army moving and try to counter their assault.

Cyrus leads his men up the hill, but Tigranes informs him that his Armenian soldiers cannot hold against the enemy. For the Chaldaeans are known for having the fiercest warriors in the region. In response, Cyrus orders the Armenians to feint a retreat to reel in the Chaldaean soldiers into his more experienced melee troops. Cyrus&#x27;s plan works causing the enemy to retreat and take control of the high ground. Messengers are sent to the Armenian King asking him to bring builders to help build the fort. Medical assistance is given to the Chaldaean prisoners and Cyrus makes them an offer. He will set the prisoners free to go back to their people and can decide if they want to make peace or continue the war. After the prisoners leave the Armenian King shows up with his workers giving praises for Cyrus&#x27;s victory. The Chaldaeans return to accept the peace offering. During the discussion Cyrus offers terms to both sides by being able to use each other lands to build up resources they have little of. The Chaldaeans are allowed to use the Armenian flat land for farming crops and the Armenians can use the Chaldaean hilly lands for pastures. Both nations also agree to allow marriage between the citizens and help each other in times of war.

Cyrus takes his forces to meet up with Cyaxares at Media. Upon arriving Cyrus gives over the loot taken in battle to his Uncle. He presses Cyaxares to move against the enemy first mentioning that they should not meet the enemy in their lands. Cyaxares agrees and gathers his forces to join Cyrus on the march. Persians, Medes, and Armenians invade the Assyrian lands. Enemy scouts see the advancing army and report back to the king. The Assyrian king summons his forces and goes out to meet Cyrus in battle. When the two armies are close to each other neither wants to be the one to advance. The Assyrian forces set up a defensive entrenchment around their camp. Cyaxares wants to attack, but Cyrus informs him that once the enemy sees the smaller force then the Assyrians would not hold back against them. Cyrus is still given the order from his uncle to attack and obeys the command. Chrysantas and other officers bring information that they capture Assyrian deserters to Cyrus. He learns that a small detachment of the enemy army is on the march with the rest station at the camp. Cyrus presses on the attack saying to his men, &quot;Brave men to the front! Who follows me? Who will lay the first Assyrian low?&quot; Cyrus&#x27;s soldiers clash with the Assyrians and quickly put them on the retreat. The fighting continues to take place at the enemy camp, but Cyrus orders his soldiers to pull back worried that reinforcements will overrun them.

== Meaning of the Text ==
=== Book One===
The first book&#x27;s opening states that it began as a reflection about why some rulers are willingly obeyed and others are not. Everywhere, the author observes, humans fail to obey their rulers; the one exception is Cyrus the Great, a man who inspired obedience.

A list of Cyrus&#x27;s conquests follows, and the author seeks to understand why his subjects obeyed him &quot;willingly.&quot; The work narrates his entire life, with only the first of eight books concerning the actual education of Cyrus.

The first book is devoted to Cyrus&#x27;s descent, education, and stay at the court of his maternal grandfather, the Median dynast Astyages. Scholars have noted that Xenophon&#x27;s description of pre-imperial Persian education is unusual and appears to be based upon the traditions of Sparta: the subject of Xenophon&#x27;s other work the &quot;Constitution of the Lacedaemonians&quot;.

=== Books Two to Seven===
Books two to seven cover Cyrus&#x27;s life as a Median vassal on his path to establishing the world&#x27;s largest empire. In these books, Cyrus is upheld as an example of classical virtue, but also uses what are now known as Machiavellian tactics. He proves a faithful vassal to the Medes, initially acting as a general to defend them from the more powerful and assertive Babylonian empire. He does so by cultivating alliances with nations such as the Chaldeans, Hyrcanians, Cadusians, Saka, and Susians. The remaining allies of Babylon include many nations of Asia Minor, as well as a corps of Egyptian infantry. Croesus of Lydia acts as general in the two powers&#x27; final field battle. Cyrus then returns with an increasingly international army to conquer Babylon. He is able to avoid a long siege by deflecting the course of the river through it, then sending soldiers in over the dry bed during a festival night. The claim that Babylon was conquered on the night of a festival by diverting the Euphrates River from its channel is also made by Herodotus (1.191).

=== Book Eight ===
Book eight is a sketch of Cyrus&#x27; kingship and his views of monarchy.

The last section of this book (8.8) also describes the rapid collapse of Cyrus&#x27;s empire after he died. It has been speculated that this section was written by a later author. Alternatively, it may symbolize Xenophon&#x27;s theoretical inconsistency concerning his conception of an ideal ruler, or show that Xenophon did not mean to describe an ideal ruler in any simple way. It may also intend to display, rather than undermine, Cyrus&#x27;s strength as a leader.

Related characters of questionable historical truth appear in the narrative as well. For example, the romance of Abradatas and Pantheia forms much of the narrative&#x27;s latter half (v.1.3, vi.1.31ff, vi.4.2ff, vii.3.2ff).

==Reception==
In classical antiquity, the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; was considered the masterpiece of a widely respected and studied author. Polybius, Cicero, Tacitus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Quintilian, Aulus Gellius and Longinus thought highly of Xenophon and his work. Classical authors believed that he composed the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; in response to the &quot;Republic&quot; of Plato or vice versa, and Plato&#x27;s &quot;Laws&quot; seems to allude to the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;. Among classical leaders, Scipio Aemilianus is said to have carried a copy with him at all times; it was also a favorite of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar.

== Legacy ==
The &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; was rediscovered in Western Europe during the late medieval period as a piece on political virtue and social organization. It heavily influenced the late medieval and Renaissance genre known as mirrors of princes, which gave examples of leadership behavior to educate future rulers. Giovanni Pontano, Bartolomeo Sacchi, Leon Battista Alberti and Baldassare Castiglione treated Cyrus as such an example. However, unlike most mirrors of princes, whether the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; was really intended to describe an ideal ruler is a subject of debate.

The &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; continued to be widely read in the early modern period and during the Enlightenment. Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot;, which represented a turn toward modern political thinking, was particularly influenced by the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; and represents a more sophisticated reading of Xenophon. It appears critical of his idealistic approach to Cyrus, while also considering Cyrus&#x27;s deceit and the danger of deceitful leaders part of the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;&#x27;s message. Many early modern writers after Machiavelli, including Montaigne, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Bacon, Jonathan Swift, Bolingbroke, Shaftesbury, Edward Gibbon, and Benjamin Franklin also esteemed Xenophon as a philosopher and historian. The &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; was often used to model correct prose in classical Attic Greek, mastery of which was part of the education of European and American gentlemen in the eighteenth century. Thomas Jefferson had two copies of the book in his library, possibly for this reason.

In the nineteenth century, Xenophon and the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; began to decline in popularity compared to other classical authors and works. This is partly because its endorsement of monarchy had grown less favorable. Yet, in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, Xenophon&#x27;s work has become more studied and esteemed. Some present scholars argue that the basic historical events of the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; are more credible than those described in Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot;, and debate continues over the work&#x27;s relevance and historical accuracy.

<text>Absoluuttinen Nollapiste (Finnish for absolute zero) is a progressive rock band from Rovaniemi, Finland. It is known for combining catchy melodies and solid, slightly progressive songwriting with Tommi Liimatta&#x27;s eccentric lyrics.

Liimatta has numerous side projects with some of the band&#x27;s current members, some ex-members and others. They publish their music under their own Diu Dau Tapes label. The most famous project is Ahkerat simpanssit, who released the album &quot;Tervehdys, Maan asukit&quot; in 2003.

==History==
Absoluuttinen Nollapiste started in June 1991, when Liimatta was on his confirmation camp in Nuasjärvi, Sotkamo, when he had an idea of putting together a rock band. The members of the band, who all lived in the same neighborhood in Rovaniemi, were Liimatta (born in Kemi, 1976, vocals and wind instruments), Tomi Krutsin (born in Rovaniemi, 1976, drums) and Aki Lääkkölä (born in Rovaniemi, 1976, guitar and keyboards). They had had other groups before. The band&#x27;s first bass guitarist, Matti Kettunen, was replaced in November 1991 by Aake Otsala (born in Kuopio, 1976) and, a year later, the second guitarist, Jukka Leinonen left the band. This line-up lasted for about 7 years. Some time in 1999, Teemu Eskelinen joined the band as a backing vocalist.

<doc id="1021540" wikidata="Q2726960" url="?curid=1021540" title="John Sexton">
<text>John Edward Sexton (born September 29, 1942) is an American legal scholar. He is the Benjamin F. Butler Professor of Law at New York University where he teaches at the law school and NYU&#x27;s undergraduate colleges. Sexton served as the fifteenth president of NYU, from 2002 to 2015. During his time as president, NYU&#x27;s stature rose dramatically into the ranks of the world&#x27;s top universities, and it became the world&#x27;s first global network university. Sexton has been called a &quot;transformational&quot; figure in higher education and was named by &quot;Time Magazine&quot; as one of the United States&#x27; 10 best college presidents.

From 1988 to 2002, he served as dean of the NYU School of Law, during which time NYU became one of the top five law schools in the country according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. In 2000, Kent D. Syverud, then-dean of the Vanderbilt University Law School, called John Sexton the most effective dean of his generation.

Sexton has served as chair of several major higher education organizations, including the Association of American Law Schools, the American Council on Education, the Independent Colleges and Universities of New York State, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the University of the People President&#x27;s Council. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has received many awards and honors for his work in education, including the American Council on Education&#x27;s Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for Leadership Excellence and 24 honorary doctoral degrees. In July 2008, he was named as Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur, the national order of the Legion of Honor of France; and in April 2024, Sexton received the Abu Dhabi Award, which is the highest civilian honor issued by the United Arab Emirates. From January 1, 2003, to January 1, 2007, Sexton was the chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; in 2006, he served as chair of the Federal Reserve System&#x27;s Council of Chairs.

Throughout his time as dean and president of NYU, Sexton continued to teach a full faculty schedule (at least four courses) and to write books and articles. Since stepping down as NYU&#x27;s president, Sexton has continued to teach a full schedule and write both for the academic and popular press. He also has worked to expand access to education for underrepresented groups and refugees — the most notable of these efforts is the Catalyst Foundation for Universal Education, created with former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to advance opportunities for refugees worldwide.

==Education and early career==

Sexton graduated from Brooklyn Preparatory School, a Jesuit high school, in 1959. He has written and spoken much about his time at Brooklyn Prep and Charlie Winans, who he has referred to as his &quot;great teacher.&quot;

Sexton holds a BA. in history (1963), an MA in comparative religion (1965), and a PhD in history of American religion (1978) from Fordham University, as well as a JD (1979) &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Harvard Law School, where he was Supreme Court Editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;.

From 1966 to 1975, he taught religion at St. Francis College in Brooklyn, New York, where he was chair of the Religion Department. In 1977, he incorporated the John Sexton Test Preparation Center in the New York City area, which offered test preparation services for exams such as the GMAT and LSAT. According to a government report, it served 6,500 students and had revenue of over $650,000 in 1979.

From 1961 to 1975, Sexton coached the debate team at St. Brendan&#x27;s High School, a Catholic girls&#x27; school in Brooklyn, New York, leading the team to five national championships and numerous invitational titles. He was named to the National Forensic League Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005, the Barkley Forum at Emory University presented him with a &quot;Golden Anniversary Coaching Award&quot; recognizing him as a top high school debate coach of the past 50 years. Still an avid proponent of interscholastic debate, he is chairman of the board of Associated Leaders of Urban Debate (ALOUD), which seeks to bring debate activities to underserved communities in America&#x27;s urban areas.

After graduating from Harvard Law School, he clerked for judges Harold Leventhal and David L. Bazelon of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1979–80, and he clerked for Chief Justice of the United States Warren E. Burger in 1980–81.

==Dean of New York University School of Law==

Sexton joined the faculty of the New York University School of Law in 1981, teaching first year law students Civil Procedure (the rules of courts); he was given tenure in 1983.

In 1988, Sexton was named dean of the New York University School of Law, succeeding Norman Redlich. During his deanship, NYU&#x27;s School of Law rose to number four in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings of law schools; an emphasis on faculty recruitment reduced the student faculty ratio from 19:1 to 12:1; the Hauser Global Law School Program was established; the school became among the most selective in the U.S. (average LSAT scores rose from the 94th to the 97th percentile; average GPAs rose from 3.54 to 3.66); and in 1998 the school completed the then-largest fundraising campaign in the history of legal education ($185 million). After he stepped down as dean to become president of NYU in 2002, the law school named a professorship after him, the John E. Sexton Professor of Law, held presently by Richard B. Stewart, as well as named a lounge after him at Furman Hall, the John Sexton Student Forum. In addition, the law school as created a set of scholarships for students named in his honor.

==President of New York University==

Sexton was named the 15th president of New York University by NYU&#x27;s Board of Trustees on May 8, 2001, two months after then-President L. Jay Oliva announced that he was stepping down. &quot;I am a very fortunate man,&quot; Sexton told the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; in an article published the next day. He assumed the post of president on May 17, 2002, one day after the 2002 All-University Commencement, and his official installation occurred on September 26, 2002. In 2009, NYU&#x27;s Board of Trustees asked him to stay on as president until 2016, and Sexton accepted.

In addition to his duties as NYU President, Sexton has taught a full faculty schedule — at least four courses — every year since 1981 without sabbatical. He teaches both law students and undergraduates across NYU&#x27;s Global Network in New York and Abu Dhabi and has taught classes in Shanghai. A book based on one of the courses, &quot;Baseball as a Road to God&quot;, was published in 2013 He also taught a year-long course on the American Constitution, religion, and government for the Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan Scholars Program (for outstanding undergraduate students in United Arab Emirates&#x27; institutions of higher learning who are selected for special academic and leadership opportunities).

During his presidency, NYU was named the &quot;number one dream school&quot; four times by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;. In addition, NYU rose across college rankings, including in &quot;US News &amp; World Report&quot;, the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;, the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, and &quot;Bloomberg BusinessWeek&quot;. In 2014, NYU received a record number of prospective applicants for freshman admission for the seventh straight year in a row.

According to a press release from NYU, during Sexton&#x27;s presidency applications for freshman admission more than doubled, from 29,000 to over 60,000.

===Expansion of the Arts and Science faculty===

In 2004, Sexton announced a program — the Partners Plan — to expand tenured and tenure-track faculty in the arts and sciences by 20%, the largest such expansion in the university&#x27;s history. By fall 2009, faculty hires under the Partners Plan included totaled 245, including 124 hires to replace departing faculty and 121 new hires to expand the arts and science faculty.

=== Fundraising campaign ===

In 2008, NYU successfully finished what was then the largest completed fundraising campaign in higher education. &quot;The Campaign for NYU&quot;, with a stated goal of raising $2.5 billion, ultimately raised over $3 billion. In 2009, NYU&#x27;s fundraising continued to exceed $1 million per day in spite of the economic crisis.

===The Global Network University===

In October 2007, NYU announced the creation of New York University Abu Dhabi, the first such campus to be operated abroad by a major research university. The school, which the university is referring to as the &quot;world&#x27;s honors college,&quot; recruits top students and faculty from around the world, and began classes in the fall of 2010. NYU Abu Dhabi recruited an outstandingly strong first freshman class, which was notable for its selectivity (189 students were accepted out of 9,048 applicants worldwide (an acceptance rate of 2.1%), with a 79.4 percent yield), its geographic diversity (the class of 150 students will include students from 39 countries on six continents), and the academic qualifications of its students (at the classes&#x27; 75th percentile, the SAT critical reading score was 770 (behind only four US universities) and the math score was 780 (ranking it sixth); the median SAT score (on the 1600 scale) was 1470). The recruitment of the class was reported on in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on June 21, 2010. 
&quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine carried a Q+A with Sexton about the Abu Dhabi campus in August 2008. Sexton discussed the emergence of NYU as a Global Network University in an interview on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition Sunday&quot; with David Greene in August 2009, as well as in two articles in Abu Dhabi&#x27;s English-language newspaper &quot;The National (Abu Dhabi)&quot;.

During Sexton&#x27;s presidency, the percentage of NYU students studying abroad approximately doubled to over 40 percent, and the Institute of International Education recognized NYU as sending more students abroad than any other U.S. university. The number of study abroad sites doubled, including the first sites in Asia and Africa. In fall 2009, under Sexton, NYU opened a site in Tel Aviv. In addition to its portal campus in Abu Dhabi, NYU operated ten global sites on five continents. In November 2014, the IIE reported that NYU, for the first time, hosted more international students than any other U.S. university. Beyond its global sites, individual NYU schools and programs operate some two dozen international programs, including NYU&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts&#x27; TischAsia in Singapore. The Stern School of Business implemented global components in its undergraduate curriculum. The NYU School of Law established an LLM joint degree program with the National University of Singapore.

Sexton discussed the idea of the Global Network University at length in late 2009 with Richard Heffner on &quot;The Open Mind (TV series)&quot;. &quot;The New Global University&quot; was a topic of the British Council&#x27;s Going Global conference in March 2010, at which Sexton was invited to speak.

At the events marking the announcement of Gordon Brown as NYU&#x27;s first Global Distinguished Leader in Residence in December 2010, he discussed the Global Network University concept at length.

On March 28, 2011, under Sexton, the university announced the creation of New York University Shanghai, a research university with a liberal arts and science college in China&#x27;s financial capital, the first American university with independent legal status approved by the Chinese Ministry of Education, and the result of a partnership between NYU and Shanghai. Also in March 2011, recognized NYU with its Senator Paul Simon Award for Campus Internationalization, and &quot;Fast Company (magazine)&quot; named NYU #1 on its list of education innovators, citing the opening of NYU Abu Dhabi.

In April 2011, at the U.S. State Department&#x27;s US-China Consultation on People-to-People Exchange, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cited NYU&#x27;s announcement about the opening of NYU Shanghai, and praised John Sexton&#x27;s work on the project.

On July 11, 2011, in response to the detention of law-abiding democracy advocates by the government of the United Arab Emirates and Sexton&#x27;s suggestion that such detention was appropriate to the UAE&#x27;s &quot;security concerns,&quot; Human Rights Watch asked Sexton to publicly retract his statements on the matter. He did not respond to this request.

===Undergraduate programs===

Both Sexton&#x27;s own transition reports and the Middle States Accreditation Report cited the need to enhance the experience of NYU undergraduates. Since Sexton&#x27;s appointment, NYU put in place the award-winning 24/7 Wellness Exchange, specialized programming in student dorms, and novel resources to assist students. In addition, NYU&#x27;s Student Health Center has been a pioneer in depression screening among college students.

===Leadership positions in major academic organizations and think tanks===

While Dean of the NYU School of Law, Sexton served as president of the Association of American Law Schools. In 2009, Sexton served as chair of the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities, vice-chair and chair-designate of the American Council on Education, and chair of the New York Academy of Sciences. He is also a member of the board of the Association of American Universities, a member of the board of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, and a member of the board of the Institute of International Education.

Sexton is also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and on the advisory board of the Genesis Prize Foundation. He is a fellow of the Foreign Policy Association.

In 2008–09, Sexton co-chaired (with Rick Trainor, the principal of King&#x27;s College London) the US-UK Study Group on Higher Education in a Global Environment, a working group of university presidents constituted by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

In March 2010, Sexton was named Chair of the American Council on Education.

In 2011, Sexton led a blue ribbon panel assembled by the American Council on Education that issued a report on the competitiveness of U.S. universities and the global higher education environment.

===Framework 2031 and NYU 2031 expansion plan===

In 2002, Sexton&#x27;s transition teams identified the need for improved and better coordinated planning.

In June 2008, NYU published &quot;Framework 2031&quot;, which reviewed and addressed the key issues, concerns, and opportunities the university would confront over the two-plus decades leading to its bicentennial.

Increases in the size of the student body and program development that began to accelerate in the 1990s sparked resistance in the Greenwich Village neighborhood, as community members opposed NYU&#x27;s expansion projects. In 2007, NYU began a space planning process with intensive community involvement to provide a roadmap for aligning the university&#x27;s academic needs and its growth through 2031; the process included a number of open houses to provide for community input. In April 2010, Sexton announced &quot;NYU 2031: NYU in NYC&quot;, a long-term, citywide strategic framework for how and where NYU should develop space for its academic mission. The strategy envisioned the addition of as much as of space over more than two decades, but recognized that all of NYU&#x27;s space needs could not be accommodated within its neighborhood; therefore &quot;NYU 2031: NYU in NYC&quot; called for fully half of the growth to be spread over three locations outside Greenwich Village — along Manhattan&#x27;s East Side health corridor, in Downtown Brooklyn, and on Governors Island — and half in or near its core.

In March 2011, NYU announced updates to its plans to expand over the coming two decades, and in particular its proposal for the two &quot;superblocks&quot; near its campus core. Following editorial support by several New York City newspapers and the approval of the New York City Planning Commission, the New York City Council approved the NYU 2031 proposals in July 2012 by a vote of 44–1.

===Opposition to and ultimate approval of NYU&#x27;s 2031 plan===

A faculty organization called &quot;Faculty Against the Sexton Plan&quot; was formed to fight the administration&#x27;s plans, which had prompted contentious public meetings within the Greenwich Village community prior to the near-unanimous approval by the city. That group was one of a number of plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the university over the plan; in October 2014, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court ruled for NYU and the city and against the plaintiffs.

On March 15, 2013, Sexton lost a vote of no confidence among NYU Faculty of Arts and Science, by a vote of 52% to 39% with 8% abstaining; with a total of 83% voter participation. Subsequently, faculty of the Gallatin School, the Steinhardt School, and the Tisch School also passed votes of no confidence. However, the NYU Board of Trustees reaffirmed their support for Sexton; moreover, the faculty of the NYU School of Law passed a faculty vote of confidence in Sexton by 59-2 (with 3 abstentions), the Faculty Council at the School of Medicine passed a resolution of support for Sexton 28–9, and the School of Social Work voted down a motion of no confidence 20-12 (with 9 abstentions).

Some members of the faculty claimed that the administration of New York University, in seeking approvals for the NYU 2031 plan, would create a development project that would remove large tracts of open space from Greenwich Village and create a construction zone on and off for years to come. Out of 170 academic departments in the university, 37 passed resolutions against the NYU 2031 plan, including a majority of the departments in the Faculty of Arts and Science; in response, Sexton indicated in a University Senate meeting in spring 2012 that he would establish a presidential working group, composed largely of faculty selected by the Faculty Senators Council and the schools and chaired by the head of the Faculty Senators Council, to review space and development issues. That group, the University Space Priorities Working Group, began its work in fall 2012; it completed its work in March 2014. In its final report, the group found that NYU did indeed have a pressing need for additional academic space, determined that the university&#x27;s plans for a new facility were within it financial means, and recommended that the university construct on the site of the Coles Sports and Recreation Center.

After receiving editorial support by New York City newspapers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;, the &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;Crain&#x27;s New York Business&quot;, and the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, and the approval of the New York City Planning Commission, the New York City Council overwhelmingly approved, by a margin of 44–1, the NYU 2031 proposals in July 2012.

===Grad student labor dispute===

In November 2013, NYU and the United Auto Workers (which represented graduate teaching assistants, or TAs) announced a joint agreement to recognize a graduate student union; in March 2015, the two sides reached agreement on a contract. In the preceding years, there was controversy at NYU over the issue of collective bargaining and union representation for TAs as well as research assistants (RAs). In 2001, NYU signed the first and only collective bargaining agreement for TAs at a private university. In July 2004, in a case involving Brown University, the National Labor Relations Board reversed its 2000 ruling involving NYU and determined that graduate students are not workers. In the spring and summer of 2005, there were discussions between NYU and the UAW to try to come to terms on a new contract. Ultimately, this proved unsuccessful, and NYU decided not to negotiate a second contract with the Graduate Student Organizing Committee, sparking a strike among graduate assistants in late 2005 and criticism of Sexton. GSOC called off the strike in 2006. In 2009, NYU&#x27;s Graduate School of Arts &amp; Science – home to most of NYU&#x27;s fully funded graduate students — modified its financial aid packages for graduate students to eliminate assistantship duties; thereafter, graduate students who wished to teach could do so (with additional compensation beyond their graduate study stipends) as adjunct faculty, who are unionized at NYU.

===Return to NYU School of Law===

Sexton decided to retire as the university&#x27;s president after his contract expired in 2016 after 14 years as president; he subsequently returned full-time to NYU School of Law, where he was previously dean for 14 years and a faculty member for seven years. He also continues to teach at the university&#x27;s undergraduate colleges, as he did during his term as president.

===Salary and compensation===

In the 2007–08 school year, Sexton received $1.3 million in executive compensation for his service as president of the university. His salary later increased to $1.5 million. Sexton was scheduled to receive a length of service bonus of $2.5 million in 2015 as well as $800,000 annually in retirement.

==Writing==

Sexton co-edits the textbook &quot;Civil Procedure: Cases and Materials&quot;, now in its thirteenth edition (with John Cound, Jack Friedenthal, Helen Hershkoff, and Arthur R. Miller), which is widely used in law schools throughout the United States. In addition, he co-wrote with Samuel Estreicher the book &quot;Redefining the Supreme Court&#x27;s Role: A Theory of Managing the Federal Judicial Process&quot; as well as the 141-page NYU Law Review article &quot;A Managerial Theory of the Supreme Court&#x27;s Responsibilities: An Empirical Study&quot; in 1984. These works were the centerpiece of a national debate over the creation of a new intermediate court to fit between the United States Courts of Appeals and both the Supreme Court of the United States and state supreme courts. Sexton also wrote &quot;How Free Are We?: What the Constitution Says We Can and Cannot Do&quot; (with Nat Brandt).

Sexton authored &quot;Baseball as a Road to God: Seeing Beyond the Game&quot; with Thomas Oliphant and Peter J. Schwartz, a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling non-fiction book published in 2013. The book is based on an NYU undergraduate course that Sexton teaches of the same name, which uses baseball as a vehicle to examine the formative material of religion.

His most recent book is &quot;Standing For Reason: The University in a Dogmatic Age&quot;, which former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called &quot;an incisive analysis of the collapse of political discourse&quot; provided by &quot;one of the leading educators of our time.&quot; This work was based on Sexton&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on Higher Education&quot; published periodically over the course of his presidency of NYU.

==Awards and recognition==

Sexton has received numerous commendations from NYU in recognition of his contributions to the university, including the 2015 Judge Edward Weinfeld Award (NYU School of Law&#x27;s highest honor); the 2016 Eugene J. Keogh Award for Distinguished Public Service; and the 2019 Albert Gallatin Medal for Outstanding Contributions to Society (the university&#x27;s highest honor). In addition, he was honored in 2016 as the recipient of the President&#x27;s Distinguished Leadership Award from the School of Law&#x27;s Black, Latino, Asian Pacific American Law Alumni Association.

==Media==

Over the years, Sexton has been the subject of several public profiles in prominent media venues. In September 2009, he was featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot; section &quot;Sunday Routines&quot;. In March 2010, he was interviewed by Bill Moyers on the Public Broadcasting Service show &quot;Bill Moyers Journal&quot;. In May 2010, he was the subject of a NY1 profile on &quot;One on 1 with Budd Mishkin.&quot; That July, he appeared on &quot;Charlie Rose (talk show)&quot; to discuss the Global Network University, NYU&#x27;s Abu Dhabi campus, and the state of public discourse, among other topics.

As president of NYU, Sexton discussed the nature of the university recurringly on &quot;The Open Mind (TV series)&quot;.

He also appeared as a guest on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on December 6, 2006; during his time in the studio, he gave Stephen Colbert a hug, which he was known for giving affectionately on campus. He appeared again on &quot;Colbert&quot; on March 7, 2013, to promote his book &quot;Baseball as a Road to God&quot;, which he also discussed twice on MLB Network.

In addition, Sexton has been interviewed repeatedly in the business and popular press, including:

* In August 2008, Sexton was cited in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine in a piece called &quot;The Campus of the Future.&quot;
* In May 2010, Sexton was profiled by &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; in an article that focused on his priorities for New York University.
*The next month, in its 25th anniversary issue, &quot;Crains New York Business&quot; named Sexton one of its &quot;25 People to Watch&quot;.
* In December 2010, Sexton was cited in the &quot;On Leadership&quot; section of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for his efforts as president of NYU.
*In September 2013, he was the subject of a profile in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Sexton was interviewed by sociologist Jonathan VanAntwerpen for chapter four of the book &quot;Shakespeare, Einstein, and the Bottom Line: The Marketing of Higher Education&quot; (David L. Kirp et al.). He was also interviewed by Stephen Nelson about universities and their place in public dialogue for the book &quot;Leaders in the Labyrinth&quot;.

==Personal life==

Sexton&#x27;s marriage to author Kathleen B. Jones, whom he met while a debate coach at St. Brendan&#x27;s High School, was annulled after five years. Jones described the marriage as a &quot;storybook romance&quot; between a &quot;young debate coach&quot; and an &quot;even younger star debater&quot; in her non-fiction book &quot;Living Between Danger and Love.&quot;&quot; &quot;

He met Lisa E. Goldberg, who became his wife in 1976, while they were both students at Harvard Law School. Ms. Goldberg, who became president of the Charles H. Revson Foundation, died suddenly of a brain aneurysm on January 21, 2007, at age 54. Sexton says that his wife was reading a piece about immortality by the cosmologist Max Tegmark when she died. He eulogized her at a memorial service in February 2007.

Sexton&#x27;s older child, Jed, is a Harvard graduate, an actor, and math teacher; in 2021, he entered law school and works on pro bono legal matters. He is married to Danielle DeCrette, a former administrative employee at the New York University School of Law. They have three daughters: Julia, Ava, and Natalie. Sexton&#x27;s younger child is Katherine Lodgen Sexton, a graduate of Yale and the NYU School of Law. She is married to Matt Koons; they have one child, Ellis.

Thomas Oliphant&#x27;s New York Times Bestseller &quot;Praying for Gil Hodges&quot; briefly mentions that Sexton grew up as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. In fact, Sexton is such a well-known baseball fan that he was an early participant in rotisserie baseball, which later became known as fantasy baseball, as a member of the Eddie Gaedel Baseball League. Sexton was one of a number of celebrities who reminisced about their baseball memories on the HBO special &quot;Brooklyn Dodgers - Ghosts of Flatbush&quot;. In July 2009, Sexton threw out the first pitch at a Washington Nationals game. His favorite baseball announcer is Vin Scully. He teaches &quot;Baseball as a Road To God&quot; at NYU and in 2013 wrote a book of the same name. He is a Roman Catholic and a fan of Gregorian chants.

<text>The ACME Anser was an amphibious twin-jet utility aircraft that was developed in the United States by Air Craft Marine Engineering in 1958. The project was cancelled before the prototype was complete.

==Design and development==
The ACME Company (Air Craft Marine Engineering Company), was formed in September 1954 by Robert M. Berns, a former Lockheed Missile Systems design engineer, to design and develop the prototype of an eight-seat amphibian executive aircraft. The ACME Anser, (Anser from &#x27;Analytical Services&#x27;, a contributor to the design), was to have been a 6-passenger jet-powered amphibian incorporating advance features; an advanced hull design from NACA test tank data, boundary layer control system and a retractable outboard motor, for taxiing on water.

The structure of the Anser was to have been largely formed of honeycomb skins using fibre-glass and light alloy skin. The cantilever shoulder-mounted wing was to have been a two-spar structure with honey-comb upper panels, fibre-glass leading edges and light-alloy lower skins with boundary-layer suction and re-circulation over flaps and ailerons. The hull was to have been formed with Magnesium alloy castings for high-stress areas and fibre-glass honeycomb skin panels. The tail unit was to have been a simplified light-alloy built-up structure with a plastic foam core mounting a V-tail and housing the retractable outboard motor. A retractable tri-cycle undercarriage was proposed with the main gear retracting into stabilising sponsons either side of the fuselage. The design of the Anser was to CARA 04b requirements allowing its use as a commercial aircraft.

The crew and passenger sat in a pressurised cabin lined with urethane foam for sound-proofing, shock absorption and thermal insulation.

The two Turbomeca based Continental Model 420 turbofan engines were mounted at the wing-root trailing edge adjacent to the fuselage, in easily removable engine change units, with fuel housed in wing leading edge, wing-tip tanks and a hull flexible bag tank.

A mock-up was completed before construction of a prototype and production were cancelled.
