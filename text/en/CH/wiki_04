<text>The Serbian cross (), also known as the Firesteels (), is one of the national symbols of Serbia. It is present on the coat of arms and flag of Serbia. The cross is based on a tetragrammic cross emblem of the Palaiologos dynasty of the Byzantine Empire, with the difference in Serbian use being that the cross is usually white on a carmine red background, rather than gold on a red background (though it can be depicted in gold as well). The Serbian cross was adopted from the Eastern Roman Empire and the Byzantine cross in the 10th century.

It is composed of a cross symbol with four &quot;fire striker&quot; shapes, originally four Greek letters beta (Β). Serbian tradition attributes the letters to Saint Sava, the 13th-century Archbishop of the Serbs, and interprets the four &quot;fire striker&quot; shapes as four Cyrillic letters &quot;С&quot;, for the motto Only Unity Saves the Serbs (). The Serbian cross has been frequently used in Serbian heraldry, and along with the Serbian eagle, is the main heraldic symbol which represent the national identity of the Serbian people.

==History==

Crosses with firesteels have been used since Roman times as symbols, but not as coats of arms or emblems. Some historians connect it with the &quot;labarum&quot;, the Imperial flag of Constantine the Great (r. 306–337). In the 6th century, the cross with four fields (with either letters or heraldry) appeared on Byzantine coins. The symbol was adopted by the First Crusaders starting wih the People&#x27;s Crusade (1096).

Michael VIII Palaiologos (1261–1282) adopted the symbol when he resurrected the Byzantine Empire, with the initials (letters β) of the imperial motto of the Palaiologos dynasty: &quot;King of Kings, help the King&quot; (; ). 
It was used on flags and coins. The symbol appears on the Imperial flag &quot;divellion&quot; (διβέλλιον) used in front of all other banners, recorded by Pseudo-Kodinos ( 1347–68) wrongly as &quot;a cross with firesteels&quot; (), and depicted in the Castilian &quot;Conosçimiento de todos los reynos&quot; atlas ( 1350). As Alexander Soloviev writes, the use of letters in western heraldry is nonexistent.

The oldest preserved historical source of the cross used in Serbia is from the Dečani oil-lamp (&quot;Dečanski polijelej&quot;), which was a gift to King Stefan Milutin (r. 1282–1321), the &quot;ktetor&quot; (founder) of Visoki Dečani, now preserved at the Monastery of Prohor Pčinjski. Stojan Novaković argued that the recorded use of the Serbian cross, as a national symbol, began in 1397, during the rule of Stefan Lazarević. Serbian historian Stanoje Stanojević argued that it entered its use in 1345, with Stefan Dušan&#x27;s elevation to Emperor. In the Middle Ages, both the &quot;Greek style&quot;, with closed fire-steels (β–B), and the &quot;Serbian syle&quot;, with open fire-steels (C-S), were used in Serbia.

A 1439 map by Gabriel de Vallseca used both the Serbian cross and eagle when depicting Serbia.

In South Slavic heraldic sources (also known as &quot;Illyrian Armorials&quot;), the Serbian cross is found in the &quot;Korenić-Neorić Armorial&quot; (1595), which shows the coat of arms of Serbia (Svrbiae) as a white cross over a red background, with four firesteels, also depicting the Mrnjavčević noble house with the same design, with inverted colours and the Serbian eagle in the center of the cross. According to Mavro Orbini (1607), it was used by Vukašin Mrnjavčević (King, 1365–1371) and Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović (r. 1371–1389). Next, it is found in the &quot;Belgrade Armorial II&quot; (ca. 1600–1620), the &quot;Fojnica Armorial&quot; (between 1675 and 1688), the &quot;Armorial of Stanislaus Rubcich&quot; (c. 1700), and &quot;Stemmatographia&quot; (1741), while still continuing to be used in foreign heraldic sources. 

The Metropolitanate of Karlovci, established in 1691, adopted it in its seal.

After the Serbian Revolution, the Serbian cross then appeared on all official Serbian coats of arms, except the Serbian coat of arms adopted in 1947, which had the cross removed, leaving four stylized S; this was done symbolically by the Yugoslav government to &quot;socially curtail and politically marginalize religious communities and religion in general&quot;. Miloš Obrenović adopted the Serbian cross as the military flag when forming the first units of the regular army in 1825.

<doc id="1008352" wikidata="Q39983" url="?curid=1008352" title="Anthony Rapp">
<text>Anthony Deane Rapp (born October 26, 1971) is an American actor and singer who originated the role of Mark Cohen in the Broadway production of &quot;Rent&quot;. Following his original performance of the role in 1996, he reprised it in the film version of the show and the show&#x27;s United States tour in 2009. He also performed Charlie Brown in the 1999 Broadway revival of &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; and originated the role of Lucas in the musical &quot;If/Then&quot; in 2014. From 2017 to 2024, he played Commander Paul Stamets on the television series &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

Rapp is also known for accusing actor Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct in 2017 during the #MeToo movement over an alleged event from 1986. The same allegation generated an unsuccessful civil case in 2022 where a jury found Spacey not liable.

==Early life==
Rapp was born on October 26, 1971, in Chicago, Illinois to Mary Lee (née Baird) and Douglas Rapp and raised in nearby Joliet. After his parents&#x27; divorce in 1974, he was raised by his mother, a nurse. His older brother is playwright, novelist and filmmaker Adam Rapp. He also has an older sister.

Rapp participated in community theater as a child and won awards for his singing in junior high school. He attended Joliet West High School and theatre camp at Interlochen Arts Camp in Michigan. He moved to New York in 1989 to attend New York University as a film student, but dropped out after a semester.

==Career==
Rapp first performed on Broadway in 1981 in &quot;The Little Prince and the Aviator&quot;, a musical based on Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s novel &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. It closed during previews. He made his screen debut in the ensemble of the 1987 film &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot;, directed by Chris Columbus, who later directed Rapp in the film version of &quot;Rent&quot;. Rapp has appeared in several movies and Broadway shows. His notable roles include such films as &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, &quot;School Ties&quot;, &quot;Road Trip&quot;, &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; (stage and film versions), &quot;The Beach Boys: An American Family&quot;, and &quot;Danny Roane: First Time Director&quot;.

Rapp played Mark Cohen in the off-Broadway and original Broadway casts of Jonathan Larson&#x27;s musical &quot;Rent&quot;. For his audition, he sang R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;, and received his callback in September 1994. After offering him the role, Jonathan Larson wrote new songs for the production with Rapp&#x27;s voice in mind. Rapp reprised the role in the film adaptation, released on November 23, 2005. He returned to the stage version with original cast member Adam Pascal, from July 30 to October 7, 2007. Rapp, Pascal and fellow original cast member Gwen Stewart also participated in a national tour of &quot;Rent&quot; beginning January 6, 2009.
Rapp released a solo CD, &quot;Look Around&quot;, in 2000. In 2006, he published a memoir about &quot;Rent&quot; and his relationship with his mother, &quot;Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent&quot;, which he spent six years writing. Rapp developed a one-man stage show with music based on the memoir beginning in 2007, later performing it at such locations as the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. A recording of the show was released on December 11, 2012, by PS Classics.

In 2005, Rapp played The Doctor in the world premiere of &quot;Feeling Electric&quot; (later the Broadway musical &quot;Next to Normal&quot;) at the New York Musical Theatre Festival. During &quot;Next to Normal&quot;&#x27;s Off-Broadway run in 2008, he worked as assistant director to Michael Greif, who had directed him in &quot;Rent&quot;, and wrote the introduction to the published script.

Rapp played Lucas in &quot;If/Then&quot;, starring fellow &quot;Rent&quot; alum Idina Menzel. It opened at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., began previews on Broadway on March 5, 2014, and opened on Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theater on March 30. In July, Rapp had to miss performances due to a knee injury and surgery. It closed on March 22, 2015. Rapp reprised the role in the 2015-2016 National Tour with Menzel and the rest of the main Broadway cast.

Rapp also appeared in &quot;&quot;, an episode of the TV series &quot;Psych&quot;, which premiered on USA Network on December 15, 2013. In 2016, Rapp was cast in &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; as Lt. Commander Paul Stamets, the first openly gay character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. It was Rapp&#x27;s first television regular role; while he had watched some &quot;Star Trek&quot; as a child, he watched &quot;curated lists&quot; of episodes from the multiple series to prepare for the role.

==Personal life==

Rapp had a close relationship with his mother, who was battling cancer during the beginning of the off-Broadway and Broadway transfer of &quot;Rent&quot;. He visited her on weekends. She died at age 55 in 1997. He credits her for instilling values of justice and respect in him.

In 2012, &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; referred to Rapp as &quot;one of the first openly gay men on Broadway&quot;. He came out to his mother at 18, and by her death in 1997 she had grown comfortable with it. In a 1997 interview with &quot;Oasis&quot; magazine, he explained his sexual identity as &quot;queer&quot; rather than &quot;gay&quot;:

He has also identified as &quot;bisexual&quot; and &quot;four-and-a-half&quot; on the Kinsey scale. He has cited working with Larry Kramer as a young man (in Kramer&#x27;s play &quot;The Destiny of Me&quot;) for his commitment to activism and &quot;liv[ing] an open life&quot;.

Rapp is a &quot;die hard&quot; Chicago Cubs fan and co-hosts the baseball podcast &quot;The Clubhouse&quot;. At the Cubs game on August 29, 2016, he threw the first pitch and sang the Star Spangled Banner. He enjoys playing poker and video games.

In November 2019, Rapp announced his engagement to his partner, Ken Ithiphol. They have two children, both born via surrogacy.

=== Accusations against Kevin Spacey ===
In October 2017, Rapp alleged in an interview with &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; that actor Kevin Spacey made an unwanted sexual advance toward him in 1986, when Rapp was 14 and Spacey was 26. At the time, Rapp and Spacey were both appearing in Broadway shows – Rapp in &quot;Precious Sons&quot;, Spacey in &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; – and Spacey invited Rapp to a party at his home. Rapp said that at the end of the evening, an apparently drunk Spacey &quot;picked [him] up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold&quot;, placed him on the bed, and held him down while tightening his grip on him. &quot;He was trying to seduce me&quot;, Rapp said. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I would have used that language. But I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.&quot; Rapp added that he met with a lawyer to discuss possible legal action, but was told there was no case worth pursuing. He had previously discussed the incident in a 2001 interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, but Spacey&#x27;s name was redacted from publication to avoid legal disputes and public outing. Rapp claimed he was inspired to come forward in 2017 after the effects of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations with the support of his family, boyfriend, and representatives; however, text message evidence shown during Rapp&#x27;s trial against Spacey showed that Rapp had reported his allegation about Spacey to &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; before Lupita Nyong&#x27;o, whom Rapp previously credited for inspiring him to come forward.

In response, Spacey posted on Twitter that he did not remember the encounter but said that he was &quot;beyond horrified to hear his story&quot;, and offered Rapp the &quot;sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior&quot;. After the &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; article, at least 14 other people came forward to accuse Spacey of sexual misconduct, ultimately leading to him losing his starring role on &quot;House of Cards&quot; and involvement in other projects. Rapp faced harassment and criticism for the accusation. On September 9, 2020, he sued Spacey for sexual assault, sexual battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress under the Child Victims Act, which extended New York&#x27;s statute of limitations for civil suits related to child sexual abuse. Rapp sought $40 million in damages. Joining Rapp in the suit against Spacey was a man who requested to remain anonymous who accused Spacey of sexually abusing him in 1983, when he was 14 and Spacey was 23. On October 20, 2022, a jury found Spacey not liable.

<text>Extreme Noise Terror (often abbreviated to ENT) are a British extreme metal band formed in Ipswich, England in 1985 and one of the earliest and most influential crust bands. Noted for one of the earliest uses of dual vocalists in hardcore, and for recording a number of sessions for BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, the band started as crust punks and helped characterise the early, archetypal grindcore sound with highly political lyrics, fast guitars and tempos, and often very short songs.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Extreme Noise Terror were formed in early 1985 in Ipswich, England, originally consisting of dual vocalists Dean Jones and Phil Vane, guitarist Pete Hurley, bassist Jerry Clay and drummer Darren &quot;Pig Killer&quot; Olley. Prior to ENT, Vane and Hurley had played with Discharge-influenced acts Freestate and Victims of War, whilst Jones had been singing with Raw Noise. Hurley claims that the band name came from an insert for an album by the Dutch band Lärm: &quot;It featured a bandanna-ed hardcore kid with &#x27;Extreme Noise Terror&#x27; surrounding him. Those three words summed up &quot;exactly&quot; what we were aiming at.&quot; Aside from Discharge, the band cite as early influences Anti Cimex, Rattus and Antisect, another early proponent of the &quot;one high, one low&quot; vocal approach. ENT signed to the small UK-based indie label Manic Ears after a solitary gig supporting Chaos UK.

Their first release for the label was a split LP with Chaos UK in 1986, entitled &quot;Radioactive Earslaughter&quot;. Although there were still musical similarities between the two bands, ENT were already beginning to twist hardcore into what would later become known as &quot;grindcore&quot;. ENT have however expressed misgivings about the use of the term:

In 1987, ENT came to the attention of John Peel, on the recommendation of fellow Ipswich group The Stupids. After seeing them live at the Caribbean Centre in Ipswich with his wife and son, Peel offered them their first (of four) Peel Session for BBC Radio 1, which was released through Strange Fruit. A second Peel Session was recorded the following May.

During this period, the drum stool was filled by former Napalm Death drummer Mick Harris, although he left soon afterward to form Scorn and was replaced by Tony &quot;Stick&quot; Dickens (of crust band Doom). Bassist Clay was replaced by Mark Gardener, and this line-up recorded ENT&#x27;s debut album, &quot;A Holocaust in Your Head&quot;, which was later voted number 3 in &quot;Terrorizer&quot;″s essential European grindcore albums, who described it as &quot;marrying a thick crust-punk crunch and vitriolic lyrical assault with the newborn, clattering fury of grindcore, &#x27;Holocaust...&#x27; followed Napalm&#x27;s heroic uppercuts and haymakers with a Doc Martin in the goolies.&quot; The band undertook a headline tour of both Europe and Japan in support of the album. In 1990, Jones and future ENT guitarist Ali Firouzbakht guested on Raw Noise&#x27;s &quot;Sound of Destruction&quot; single release, and bassist Gardener was replaced by Pete Nash from the band Doom.

===Collaboration with the KLF===
On their return from Japan, ENT were invited to perform their third Peel Session, which was released along with their first as a full-length LP by Strange Fruit. The band then embarked on another European tour, after which they released their second record, &quot;Phonophobia&quot;, through Vinyl Japan and returned to tour Japan once again. Further radio support from John Peel brought ENT to the attention of Bill Drummond of The KLF; the two acts got in touch and Drummond asked ENT to re-record a version of KLF&#x27;s hit single &quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot;, with the intention of the band performing live on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; at Christmas.

The BBC, however, felt that the song was inappropriate for broadcast on daytime television and thus refused to air the track, leading to the KLF boycotting the show. The single eventually saw limited edition release through KLF Communications and won Single of the Week from both the &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. ENT also worked on the abandoned KLF album &quot;The Black Room&quot; (the KLF had previously released an ambient album called &quot;The White Room&quot;), but when Drummond and KLF co-member Jimmy Cauty announced the band&#x27;s retirement, they also deleted the recordings.

When asked how the collaboration came about, Jones said: &quot;What actually happened was that Bill heard us on Peel when he was in the bath and got in touch. They had wanted to do rock versions of their songs with Motörhead but something fell through, so he rang us... The message said it&#x27;s Bill from The KLF, but I thought they said &#x27;the ALF&#x27; so I didn&#x27;t take much notice... Later, we got another message saying it was definitely Bill from The KLF and I said &#x27;f--- off! What does he want with us?&#x27; But it all got explained eventually.&quot; The two bands were later asked to appear at the 1992 BRIT Awards, at which they caused controversy by firing blanks from machine guns into the audience, a performance that the &quot;NME&quot; listed at number 4 in their &quot;top 100 rock moments&quot;.

===&quot;Retro-bution&quot;, Vane&#x27;s departure and subsequent albums===
Extreme Noise Terror continued to tour throughout 1993 and 1994, and underwent further line-up changes; drummer Dickens left to join DIRT and was replaced by former member Pig Killer, Lee Barrett (founder of Candlelight Records and also member of Disgust) took over on bass, and Ali Firouzbakht joined on lead guitar. At the request of Digby Pearson, this line-up signed to Earache in June 1994 and recorded &quot;Retro-bution&quot;, essentially a compilation of re-recorded material from the band&#x27;s earlier days, which was released in January 1995. The motivation behind this release was due to the band&#x27;s dissatisfaction with their earlier recordings and saw ENT take a slightly more metal direction, including the addition of some guitar solos. A short UK tour followed, followed by touring in Europe and the US and a further line-up change occurred with Pig Killer being replaced by former Cradle of Filth drummer William A. &quot;Was&quot; Sarginson. (After several years as a professional photographer, in 2013 Pig Killer joined The Featherz under the name Dazzle Monroe.) The line-up changes continued with the departure of founder member Phil Vane, who left to join Napalm Death in late 1996. In an example of trading places, Napalm Death frontman Mark &quot;Barney&quot; Greenway agreed to join ENT during the recording of their next album, &quot;Damage 381&quot;.

The album, whose title comes from the BPM recorded on the title track, saw ENT moving further into death metal territory, reincorporating some of the blast beats and screamed vocals that had been missing from their previous two releases. The album benefited from a production from noted metal producer Colin Richardson. At the same time Napalm Death were having a hard time getting the vocals that they wanted from Vane and asked Greenway to return, which he agreed to do, leaving ENT once again lacking a second vocalist. Vane subsequently returned to the band in 1997.

Further line-up changes occurred in 1999, with Vane once again departing to be replaced by Adam Catchpole, Sarginson being replaced by Zac O&#x27;Neil, and former Cradle of Filth member Gian Pyres joining on lead guitar. In 2001, the band signed to Candlelight and released their fourth full-length album, &quot;Being and Nothing&quot;. The band also played a fourth session for BBC Radio 1 in February 2001 and continued to tour round Europe, including a slot on the main stage at Wacken Open Air in 2003.

===Recent activity===
Ever struggling with line-up problems, Paul &quot;Woody&quot; Woodfield took over on lead guitar for studio and live duties in early 2001, whilst Stafford Glover took over on bass (from the departing Barrett, who left to concentrate on To-Mera) and Desecration&#x27;s Ollie Jones was added to the line-up as permanent second guitarist. In early 2006, Phil Vane once again returned to the band after living in Switzerland for six and a half years. Zac O&#x27;Neil also left the band, to be replaced by Mic Hourihan (of Desecration and Tigertailz). In 2007, ENT toured the US with grindcore band Phobia and released a split recording with Driller Killer through French label Osmose. The following year the band released a split 7-inch with Trap Them (released on Deathwish Inc.) to coincide with their joint US &quot;West Coast Distortion&quot; tour, which culminated at the 2008 Los Angeles Murderfest. In amongst playing shows worldwide, including Indonesia, Russia, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, Finland, Germany, Estonia and at the Obscene Extreme Festival in the Czech Republic, ENT recorded their next album, &quot;Law of Retaliation&quot; which was released in early 2009 by Osmose in Europe, MCR Company in Japan, and Deep Six Records in the US. &quot;Terrorizer&quot; described it as &quot;a rabid, intense and gleeful return to explosive, hyper-speed hardcore punk insanity&quot;. The band continued to tour with shows throughout 2009 in Europe and a third Japanese tour, this time with Slang.

Though still fiercely political, in recent years the band has become more open-minded regarding some of their beliefs, especially concerning vegetarianism, and the use of drugs and alcohol. Jones commented:

On 17 February 2011, Phil Vane died in his sleep due to a cerebrovascular accident at the age of 46. The band have continued to tour and release music with former Gorerotted and The Rotted frontman Ben McCrow, with the band dedicating their 2015 self-titled album to Vane&#x27;s memory.

<text>Daisy Systems Corporation, incorporated in 1981 in Mountain View, California, was a computer-aided engineering company, a pioneer in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry.

It was a manufacturer of computer hardware and software for EDA, including schematic capture, logic simulation, parameter extraction and other tools for printed circuit board design and semiconductor chip layout.

In mid-1980s, it had a subsidiary in Germany, Daisy Systems GmbH and one in Israel.

The company merged with Cadnetix Corporation of Boulder, Colorado in 1988, with the resulting company then known officially as Daisy/Cadnetix, Inc. with the trade name DAZIX. It filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in 1990 and was acquired by Intergraph later that year. Intergraph incorporated DAZIX into its EDA business unit, which was later spun off as an independent subsidiary named VeriBest, Inc. VeriBest was ultimately acquired by Mentor Graphics in late 1999. The Veribest tool suite became Mentors flagship layout tool. Today it is known as Mentor Xpedition.

Daisy Systems was founded by Aryeh Finegold, David Stamm and Vinod Khosla; its original investors were Fred Adler and Oak Investment Partners.

Daisy along with Valid Logic Systems and Mentor Graphics, collectively known as DMV, added front end design to the existing computer-aided design aspects of computer automation.

== People ==

Many notable people in the EDA industry once worked for Daisy Systems, including Harvey Jones, who became the CEO of Synopsys, and Vinod Khosla, who, a year later in 1982, co-founded Sun Microsystems. Aryeh Finegold went on to co-found Mercury Interactive, and Dave Stamm and Don Smith went on to co-found Clarify. Tony Zingale became CEO of Clarify and then CEO of Mercury Interactive and later CEO of Jive Software. Mike Schuh co-founded Intrinsa Corporation before joining Foundation Capital as General Partner. George T. Haber went on to work at Sun and later founded CompCore Multimedia, GigaPixel, Mobilygen and CrestaTech. Dave Millman and Rick Carlson founded EDAC (now ESD Alliance), the industry organization for EDA vendors.

== Software ==
Daisy applications ran on the Daisy-DNIX operating system, a Unix-like operating system running on Intel 80286 and later processors.

In 1983
DABL (Daisy Behavioral Language) was developed at Daisy by Fred Chow. It was a hardware modelling language similar to VHDL. 
The use of DABL for simulation models of processor interconnection networks is described by Lynn R. Freytag.

<doc id="1008365" wikidata="Q420512" url="?curid=1008365" title="Akong Rinpoche">
<text>Chöje Akong Tulku Rinpoche (, 25 December 1939 – 8 October 2013) was a tulku in the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism and co-founder of the Samye Ling Monastery in Scotland, Tara Rokpa Therapy and charity ROKPA International.

==Early life==
Choje Akong Tulku Rinpoche was born in 1940, in the village of Dharak near Riwoche in Kham, Eastern Tibet. Aged two he was discovered by a search party seeking the reincarnation of the 1st Akong, Abbot of Dolma Lhakang Monastery near Chamdo. The monastery had previously not followed the tradition of having a reincarnate lama at its helm, but was ordered to find the 2nd Akong tulku by the second Kongtrul, Karse Rinpoche, the lineage master whose life he had saved when it had looked as though death was imminent. Two months later Karse Kongtrul had recovered, and, about to leave for Palpung with the 10th Trungpa Rinpoche, he looked back over his shoulder and commented, &quot;If I can sit on the fearless lion-throne and live on to benefit the teachings and beings for a long time, it will be due to the kindness of this lama.&quot; A group of lamas from Dolma Lhakang, therefore, requested guidance from the 16th Karmapa as to how to locate the new tulku.
Aged 4, the new incarnation was taken to Dolma Lhakang to receive an education that included the traditional training of a tulku and traditional Tibetan medicine, since his predecessor, Karma Miyo, was considered an accomplished physician. When only a teenager he took complete control of the monastery, performing religious ceremonies and treating the ill in Tsawa Gang, a huge and remote nomadic area, in which Dolma Lhakang is the principal monastery. Along with other notable Kagyu lamas, such as Thrangu Rinpoche and Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, he later went to the monastic university of Shechen Monastery where he received a transmission of the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages from Kongtrul Rinpoche of Shechen. Khenpo Gangshar was also teaching the &#x27;crazy wisdom&#x27; path there, and they received the mind transmission from him.

After Shechen Kongtrul, Akong&#x27;s main guru was the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa, who encouraged and guided his activity as a teacher of Buddhism, and authorised him as a teacher of Tibetan medicine.
In 1959, in the aftermath of that year&#x27;s Tibetan Rebellion, he fled to India at the age of twenty, notably with the 11th Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, and his younger brother, who later became known as Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche. Of the 300 in the party, only 13 arrived successfully in India. The harrowing journey was forced into a major detour, due to the widespread presence of Chinese soldiers, who were trying to prevent the escape of refugees. The journey took so long that they ran out of food whilst still far from their destination. Starving and having unanimously decided not to kill animals to support themselves, they eventually had to boil leather shoes and bags to make soup to survive. Nevertheless, against all odds, they did make it.
After spending time in refugee camps Akong and Trungpa Rinpoches were befriended by Freda Bedi. who would become Sister Palmo, almost certainly the first close student of European ancestry of the Karmapa lineage. She took them into her own home, then later arranged for them to help her run the Young Lamas Home School in Dalhousie, NW India. In 1963, a friend of Freda Bedi&#x27;s sponsored the two to go to Oxford where Trungpa would study comparative religion at the university. As only Trungpa had a bursary, Akong worked as a hospital orderly in the Radcliffe Infirmary in order to support himself, Trungpa and Lama Chime Tulku Rinpoche (who had joined them at Oxford).

==Activities==
Akong Rinpoche&#x27;s activity was on an international scale and unusually diverse, but it can be summarised as Dharma, healing (including Tibetan Medicine and psychotherapy), and charity.

===Dharma===
In 1967 he co-founded Samye Ling in Scotland with Trungpa Rinpoche. Since it was the first Buddhist monastery in the West it was named after Samye in Tibet, established by Guru Rinpoche in the eighth century. It remains one of Europe&#x27;s largest Buddhist monasteries. Akong himself was reluctant to teach, instead preferring to invite Tibetan Buddhism&#x27;s greatest teachers and lineage masters to Samye Ling and its many satellite centres in Europe and Africa. One of the few overseas lamas to be able to return repeatedly to his homeland from 1992 onwards, he managed to rebuild and support his monastery there, as well as to foster the resurgence of monasteries and teaching colleges of all lineages He built huge statues of Guru Rinpoche stupas, and sponsored the rebuilding of the mani wall at Simdzi, Sichuan. He also became a key figure in the collection, preservation and printing of rare Buddhist and medical texts, many of which had been on the point of disappearing completely at the time of the Cultural Revolution.

Akong was given the title &quot;Chöjé&quot;, meaning Lord of Dharma, by the 16th Karmapa in 1974 in recognition of his special qualities.

In 1992, he was tasked with finding the latest Karmapa incarnation Urgyen Drodul Trinley Dorje relying upon the prediction letter that had been discovered by Kentin Tai Situ Rinpoche. In this search Akong represented Tai Situpa and Sherab Tarchin represented Goshir Gyaltsab Rinpoche, two out of four of the Regents authorised by the 16th Karmapa to uphold the lineage until his return. Having brought Karmapa to Tsurphu Monastery, Karmapa&#x27;s principal seat in Tibet, it fell to Akong Rinpoche to organise his enthronement, with people travelling from all over the Tibetan region to attend. This was the first occasion that the enthronement of a lama of such prominence was permitted by the authorities in modern times. In common with the extensive activity to help Tibetans there, it would not have been possible without Akong&#x27;s considerable networking skills. As Karmapa Urgyen Trinley Dorje later wrote, &quot;I believe he was uniquely capable of doing that work. He dealt in a direct way with the Chinese authorities, while maintaining his integrity; he was very courageous in this, and I think the Chinese respected him.&quot;

===Healing===


Akong Rinpoche was a pioneer in bringing Traditional Tibetan Medicine (TTM) to the West, and also in developing a new form of psychotherapy or mind-training, known as Tara Rokpa Therapy.

Tara Rokpa Therapy was founded upon his spiritual and medical knowledge, in conjunction with the skills of a number of students, amongst whom were psychiatrists, psychotherapists, art therapists, and alternative therapists. The ten-year training was authenticated by the UK Council for Psychotherapy and also meets the standards required by the Irish Council of Psychotherapy and the European Association for Psychotherapy. Akong Rinpoche produced a book with his students Clive Holmes and Edie Irwin entitled &quot;Taming the Tiger: Tibetan Teachings for Improving Daily Life&quot;, which describes many of the exercises practiced in Tara Rokpa Therapy. The book aims to help those seeking to understand the source of their suffering and to heal that through relaxation, meditation, and self-knowledge.

Faced with a situation in which people with serious mental health issues were arriving at Samye Ling, for whom normal spiritual training was beyond reach, in 1989 Akong developed a community-based therapeutic home for such people, known as Lothlorien.

Akong Rinpoche fostered the practice of Traditional Tibetan Medicine (TTM), both in Tibet and in Europe. In 2004 along with Dr. Lobsang Dhonden Soktsang and Dr. Tamdin S Bradley he founded The British Association of Traditional Tibetan Medicine (BATTM) whose aim is to preserve and promote the unique system of traditional Tibetan medicine. In 1994 Akong Rinpoche succeeded in bringing Tibet&#x27;s most eminent traditional doctor, Khenpo Troru Tsenam, to teach the foundations of TTM on a four-year programme at the newly established Tara College of Traditional Tibetan Medicine at Samye Ling. Clinics were established, and legal recognition of Tibetan medicine, as a &quot;herbal medicine&quot;, obtained in the UK. In Tibet, under the auspices of ROKPA, he established TTM clinics and trained over 600 TTM doctors, many of whom had attended schools established for orphans. Every ROKPA doctor made an agreement to return to serve in their own villages for at least six years after graduation. He further created a programme to preserve the herbs used in Tibetan medicine that new demand was driving close to extinction, even going so far as to bring three young doctors to the Royal Botanical Garden Edinburgh to study horticulture and biodynamics In 2009, Akong gave a presentation on Tibetan medical treatments using mantras and prayers at the &quot;Seventh International Congress on Traditional Asian Medicine&quot; held in Bhutan.

===Charity===
In the field of charity, he co-founded ROKPA International with Lea Wyler and her father Dr, Viet Wyler in 1980. ROKPA is Tibetan for &quot;help&quot; or &quot;friend&quot;. Its motto is &quot;Helping where help is needed.&quot; An international humanitarian organisation, it works principally but not exclusively in Tibet, Nepal, and Zimbabwe. The charitable aims of ROKPA are: &quot;To promote Buddhism and to foster non-sectarian inter-religious dialogue and understanding. To provide medical care and therapy. To provide education. To relieve poverty.&quot;. Many of the projects described in the previous paragraphs were established through ROKPA, but there were also large-scale environmental projects, as well as numerous projects to preserve Tibetan language and culture in Tibet. In Nepal, the focus was directed mainly towards feeding the homeless, and with providing a home, education, and vocational training for street-kids. In Zimbabwe and South Africa ROKPA worked to provide food, vocational training, therapy, and economic opportunity from 1994 onwards, especially to help those whose lives had been devastated by the HIV Aids crisis and political turmoil.

In August 2011 Akong Rinpoche was among the guests in Lhasa at the invitation of the Communist Chinese during the 60th Anniversary of the &quot;Peaceful Liberation of Tibet&quot; functions, together with other &quot;Patriotic Tibetans&quot;. Akong Rinpoche later commented that this was personally the most difficult thing he ever had to do. While it ignited heated controversy in the Tibetan community in exile, his students felt it was another example of how much he was prepared to sacrifice personally in order to carry out his aspirations to help others.

===Written works===

(2nd edition published in 1994 by Rider)

==Accolades and advisory positions==
In 2011, Akong Tulku Rinpoche was chosen as a recipient of the &quot;60 years, 6 people&quot; accolade, in which the British Home Secretary honoured former refugees who have made an inspiring and meaningful contribution to Britain.

In 1993, he was made advisor to The School for Disabled Minorities in Lhasa; in 2008 he was made Religious Advisor to the Buddhist Society of Satham, Yunnan, and in 2009 he was appointed Advisor to the Medical College of Qinghai University. He also served as a consultant for the National Museum of Scotland.

==Death==
Akong Rinpoche, and all those associated with him, knew that his life was in danger every time he visited Tibet since there were Chinese government officials who felt he was too close to HH Dalai Lama, while the government in India were suspicious about his relations with PR China. Before leaving for the last time, Akong Rinpoche set all his affairs in order and requested the help of all those who would play a leading part in Samye Ling&#x27;s future. On 8 October 2013, it was reported that Akong Tulku Rinpoche had been murdered in Chengdu, China, along with two other monks, including Rinpoche&#x27;s nephew, and his driver. The police said that three Tibetan men had been arrested and admitted carrying out the killings. The defence of the perpetrators was that they had been owed money, which Samye Ling strongly refuted. Its website subsequently said that the killers had intended to rob Akong Rinpoche of funds which were being distributed to various ROKPA projects. It was announced on 11 October 2013 that his body was being taken to the Tibetan Autonomous Region for a traditional cremation and ceremony at Dolma Lhakang. On 12 October 2013, Samye Ling released a statement confirming that one of the suspected killers had been named by Chengdu police as Tudeng Gusha, also known as Thubten Kunsal, who had spent some five years in the UK and who had made religious statues at Samye Ling and an associated centre in London. Thubten Kunsal&#x27;s trial was held in August 2014. Akong&#x27;s family sought clemency over a death sentence, saying that the crime was intolerable but that Buddhism promoted non-violence. The court reserved its decision for a later date.

In May 2014, a conference was held in Wolfson College, the University of Oxford, to commemorate Rinpoche&#x27;s life and achievements. It was presided over by the Serthar Khenpo, Tsultrim Lodro Rinpoche, one of Tibet&#x27;s most respected lamas, and a close friend of Akong Rinpoche. The speakers were those students of Akong who had carried out his activities in different fields over many years. Since his activity was so diverse, many of even his close students were unaware of the extent of his work outside their own particular areas. A further product of the conference was a book detailing this work, named after a favourite slogan of Akong&#x27;s: &quot;Only The Impossible is Worth Doing - Recollections of the Supreme Life &amp; Activity of Choje Akong Rinpoche&quot;.
Akong Rinpoche&#x27;s younger brother Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche took over his spiritual duties as Abbot of Samye Ling. Although ROKPA was barred from returning to continue projects in Tibetan areas of China, other areas of Akong Rinpoche&#x27;s activities continue to flourish. In a letter before his death, Akong Rinpoche entrusted the recognition of his next incarnation solely to the Gyalwang Karmapa Urgyen Trinley Dorje, who has duly promised to identify him on several occasions since then.

<text>John Max Henry Scawen Wyndham, 7th Baron Leconfield, 2nd Baron Egremont, (born 21 April 1948), generally known as Max Egremont, is a British biographer and novelist. 

==Early life and education==
Egremont is the eldest son of John Wyndham, 6th Baron Leconfield and 1st Baron Egremont, and Pamela Wyndham-Quin. He is a direct descendant of Sir John Wyndham.

Egremont grew up at Petworth House. He was educated first at Heatherdown School near Ascot, then at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he read modern history. He succeeded to the baronies upon the death of his father in 1972.

==Career==
Egremont has worked for the American publishing firm Crowell Collier Macmillan and on the staff of US Senator Hugh Scott in Washington, D.C.. 

==Writing==
Egremont&#x27;s first book &quot;The Cousins: The Friendship, Opinions and Activities of Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and George Wyndham&quot; was published in 1977 and won the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; Prize for the best first book of that year. His next work was &quot;Balfour: A Life of Arthur James Balfour&quot;, published in 1980. He then wrote four novels, &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Man&quot; (1983), &quot;Dear Shadows&quot; (1986), &quot;Painted Lives&quot; (1989) and &quot;Second Spring&quot; (1993). His biography of Major General Sir Edward Spears, &quot;Under Two Flags&quot;, was published in 1997 and was short listed for the Westminster Medal for Military History. He was appointed to be the official biographer of Siegfried Sassoon by Sassoon&#x27;s son George. Egremont&#x27;s &quot;Siegfried&quot; Sassoon came out in 2005 and was short listed for the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. In 2011 he published &quot;Forgotten Land, Journeys Among the Ghosts of East Prussia&quot;. In 2014, he published &quot;Some Desperate Glory, the First World War the Poets Knew&quot;. In 2017 Egremont was joint author with Frances Carey of &quot;Käthe Kollwitz, Portrait of the Artist&quot;, the catalogue that accompanied a travelling exhibition of Kollwitz&#x27;s work. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2001. Egremont&#x27;s short book &quot;The Connel Guide to World War 1&quot; was published in 2017.

==Marriage and children==
Egremont married Caroline Nelson, a garden designer, granddaughter of Almeric Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough, in 1978. They have four children, three daughters and a son:

* Hon Jessica Mary Wyndham (born 27 April 1979)
* Hon Constance Rose Wyndham (born 20 December 1980)
* Hon George Ronan Valentine Wyndham (born 31 July 1983), heir apparent to the baronies.
* Hon Mary Christian Wyndham (born 4 October 1985)

He lives at the family seat of Petworth House in Sussex, which his family gave to the National Trust in 1947.

==Other interests==
He was a trustee of the Wallace Collection from 1988 to 2000, of the British Museum from 1990 to 2000, and a member of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts from 1989 to 2001.

<text>Timothy Floyd Burchett ( ; born August 25, 1964) is an American politician who is the U.S. representative for , based in Knoxville, serving since 2019.

A Republican, Burchett was formerly mayor of Knox County, Tennessee. He served in the Tennessee General Assembly, first in the Tennessee House of Representatives, in which he represented Tennessee&#x27;s 18th district. He later served in the Tennessee State Senate, representing the 7th district, part of Knox County.

Burchett is a part of the new House subcommittee overseeing President Trump&#x27;s Department of Government Efficiency.

==Early life and education==
Burchett is a native of Knoxville, Tennessee, where he was born in 1964. He attended West Hills Elementary School, Bearden Junior High School, and Bearden High School. After graduating from Bearden High School in 1982, he enrolled in the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in education in 1988. He is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

==Tennessee General Assembly==
Burchett&#x27;s first election to public office was in 1994, when he won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. He served in the House for two two-year terms, from 1995 to 1998. In 1998, he won a four-year term in the Tennessee State Senate, representing the 7th district. He succeeded Clyde Coulter &quot;Bud&quot; Gilbert. He was reelected twice, serving a total of three four-year terms, from 1999 to 2010.

In 2006, while a state senator, Burchett failed to report six political action committee checks totaling $3,300. The Registry of Election Finance did not fine him. In 2008, while still a state senator, he was fined $250 for failing to disclose three PAC contributions that totaled $1,500.

In 1999, Burchett received national media attention for sponsoring a bill to legalize the eating of roadkill, wild animals killed by vehicles, before notifying the county game warden. He defended the proposal as a &quot;common-sense thing&quot; intended to prevent edible meat from being wasted. Eating roadkill was already legal – as it is in most places – but required prior notification of the county game warden. Burchett&#x27;s bill allowed processing and consumption of roadkill before notifying the warden. Burchett proposed the bill after being contacted by a constituent who had been penalized for giving a needy family the meat from a deer his vehicle had accidentally hit.

=== Proposal of salvia ban ===

Burchett sponsored a bill in 2006 to make illegal &quot;possessing, producing, manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to produce, manufacture, or distribute the active chemical ingredient in the hallucinogenic plant &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot; in the state of Tennessee.&quot; He said, &quot;We have enough problems with illegal drugs as it is without people promoting getting high from some glorified weed that&#x27;s been brought up from Mexico. The only people I’ve heard from who are opposed to making it illegal are those who are getting stoned on it.&quot; The bill was signed into law on May 19, 2006, and went into effect on July 1, 2006. Burchett originally wanted to make violations a felony offense, but the bill was amended during its passage to make it a Class A misdemeanor.

In a news report published shortly before the signing of the bill by Governor Phil Bredesen, Burchett was quoted as saying, &quot;it&#x27;s not that popular but I&#x27;m one of those who believes in closing the barn door before the cows get out... in certain hands, it could be very dangerous, even lethal.&quot; A store owner who had stopped selling the herb due to Burchett&#x27;s bill said that he saw little point in banning salvia, &quot;I have no idea why it&#x27;s being outlawed. It&#x27;s a sage. People in South America have been using it for years and years.&quot; The same report also gave the general counterargument of salvia proponents that legislation banning &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot; reflects a cultural bias, as there are fewer prohibitions on more addictive substances such as alcohol and nicotine, and questioned how effective the bill will be, pointing out that &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot; has no odor and is easy to grow, so enforcement will be difficult.

==Knox County mayor==

Burchett became Knox County mayor in September 2010, succeeding Mike Ragsdale, who left office due to term limits. Burchett defeated former Knox County Sheriff Tim Hutchison in the Republican primary and Democratic nominee Ezra Maize in the general election.

On February 10, 2012, Burchett appeared on WBIR-TV and officially announced that the county&#x27;s first &quot;cash mob&quot; would be held at the Emery&#x27;s 5 &amp; 10 store in South Knoxville. The cash mob gained national attention, and was mentioned in &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

In 2012, Tennessee&#x27;s Registry of Election Finance unanimously decided to take no action against Burchett regarding an inquiry into his campaign disclosure forms.
=== 2014 re-election ===
In 2014 Burchett ran unopposed in both the primary and the general election.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== Elections ===
==== 2018 ====

When 30-year incumbent Jimmy Duncan announced his retirement in July 2017, Burchett entered a crowded seven-way Republican primary to succeed him. He defeated his nearest challenger, state representative Jimmy Matlock, by just under 12 percentage points. He faced Democratic nominee Renee Hoyos in the November general election. The 2nd has long been a Republican stronghold. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+20, it is one of the nation&#x27;s most Republican districts, and tied for the third-most Republican district in Tennessee. It is one of the few ancestrally Republican districts in the South; the GOP and its predecessors have held it without interruption since 1859. For this reason, the Republican primary has long been reckoned as the real contest in this district. Democrats have not made a substantive bid for the seat since 1964, and have received as much as 40% of the vote only twice since then.

As expected, Burchett won the general election in a rout, taking 65.9% of the vote to Hoyos&#x27;s 33.1%. When he took office in January 2019, Burchett became only the seventh person (not counting caretakers) to represent the 2nd since 1909. This district gives its representatives very long tenures in Washington; all six of Burchett&#x27;s predecessors held the seat for at least 10 years, with three of them serving at least 20 years. He also ended a 54-year hold on the district by the Duncan family. John Duncan Sr. won the seat in 1964, and was succeeded upon his death in 1988 by his son, Jimmy.

In February 2018 the &quot;Knoxville News Sentinel&quot; reported that Burchett had failed to report a $10,000 payment from a solar electric company on his campaign finance forms and various financial disclosure forms. The story reported that two months earlier the FBI had questioned people about Burchett committing income tax evasion. After the story broke, Burchett gave a statement to WBIR that he was correcting errors in his campaign financial disclosures and income tax forms, describing his failure to report all income as an &quot;oversight&quot;.

==== 2020 ====

Burchett was reelected in 2020 with 67.6% of the vote, defeating Democrat Renee Hoyos.

===Tenure===
====&quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;====
In December 2020, Burchett was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

====Iraq====
In June 2021, Burchett was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.

====Immigration====
Burchett voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.

Burchett voted against the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits Immigration and Customs Enforcement from cooperating with the Department of Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of Unaccompanied Alien Children.

====2023 U.S. House Speaker election====
During the 118th Congressional Speakership Election, Representative Matt Gaetz and a handful of other representatives were holdouts in voting for Rep. Kevin McCarthy for Speakership. Burchett voted for McCarthy on every ballot. While people claimed that after Burchett walked over and whispered into Gaetz&#x27;s ear, Gaetz and others abstained, giving a majority to McCarthy for Speaker, Gaetz had in fact begun abstaining before this conversation.

====Israel====
Burchett voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

====UFOs====

Following a report published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on January 12, 2023, Burchett expressed his views about an alleged government coverup of the nature of UFOs, saying, &quot;we&#x27;ve been covering this up since the &#x27;40s&quot; and that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;trust [the] government, [and] there&#x27;s an arrogance about it, and I think the American public can handle it.&quot;

On March 7, 2023, Burchett expanded on these claims, saying that UFO technology is possibly &quot;being reverse-engineered right now&quot; but we &quot;don&#x27;t understand&quot; how it functions. He maintains that the U.S. has &quot;recovered a craft at some point, and possible beings&quot;. In January 2025 Burchett claimed that aliens have secret underwater bases.

====Syria====
In 2023, Burchett was among 47 Republicans to vote for House Concurrent Resolution 21, that directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days. Texas Republican Michael McCaul, chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs disagreed, saying the U.S. participated in operations in 2022 with partners that killed 466 Islamic State operatives, detaining 250 more, contending that if the U.S. withdrew troops, it could result in an ISIS resurgence.

====Tennessee school shooting response====
On March 28, 2023, Burchett responded to the Covenant School shooting, where three nine-year-old students and three staff members were killed in Nashville, by telling reporters: &quot;It&#x27;s a horrible, horrible situation, and we&#x27;re not going to fix it. Criminals are gonna be criminals. And my daddy fought in the second world war, fought in the Pacific, fought the Japanese, and he told me, he said, &#x27;Buddy,&#x27; he said, &#x27;if somebody wants to take you out, and doesn&#x27;t mind losing their life, there&#x27;s not a whole heck of a lot you can do about it.&#x27;&quot; Burchett also said he sees no &quot;real role&quot; for Congress in reducing gun violence, other than to &quot;mess things up&quot;.

====2024 Kansas City parade shooting response====
After a local D.J. was killed and 22 others were wounded in the 2024 Kansas City parade shooting, Burchett inaccurately identified an adult attendee of the Kansas City rally, Denton Loudermill, Jr., as the shooter, claiming he was an &quot;illegal alien&quot;. Burchett&#x27;s social media post received 1.4 million views. In March 2024, the falsely identified man sued Burchett for $75,000 in damages. The lawsuit, which Loudermill had filed in a Kansas court, was dismissed in September 2024 due to lack of jurisdiction, considering the case had &quot;nothing really to do with Kansas.&quot;

====Debt Ceiling ====
In April 2023, Burchett was one of only four Republican representatives who voted against the proposed Limit, Save, Grow Act, which raised the debt ceiling while at the same time providing for cuts to non-mandatory spending, claiming he could not support any debt limit raise which did not provide fully balanced budget.

In June of the same year, Burchett was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

====Removal of Speaker McCarthy====
On October 3, 2023, Burchett was one of eight Republicans who voted to remove Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House. He said his yes vote was &quot;sealed&quot; after McCarthy allegedly made a &quot;condescending&quot; remark about his religious beliefs during a phone call. McCarthy said that he did not intend to upset Burchett.

====George Soros====

In October 2024, Burchett told a Fox News radio station that George Soros is &quot;a money changer of the worst kind&quot; who &quot;will destroy this country.&quot; The term money changer has been associated with antisemitic stereotypes. Burchett denied that his criticism of Soros, who is Jewish, was antisemitic, saying that &quot;my voting record clearly reflects my support for Israel and the Jewish people.”

====Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez====
Despite their highly contrasting positions on most issues, Burchett maintains a friendship with progressive Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whom he met during freshmen orientation as a new representative in 2019 at the beginning of the 116th United States Congress.

<text>Cheerwine is a cherry-flavored soft drink by Carolina Beverage Corporation of Salisbury, North Carolina. It has been produced since 1917, claiming to be &quot;the oldest continuing soft drink company still operated by the same family&quot;.

== Overview and history ==
When the Maysville Syrup Company of Maysville, Kentucky, went bankrupt in 1917, L.D. Peeler, Hughston Kirby, Kurt Weinmann and other invested businessmen purchased the company&#x27;s assets, moved them to North Carolina and set up the Carolina Syrup Company. That same year, Peeler, Kirby and Weinmann purchased a recipe for a cherry-flavored soda from a Saint Louis flavor salesman, which was then sold as a product for the new company under the name &quot;Cheerwine&quot;. Though it has been around since 1917, Cheerwine first became a registered trademark in 1926.
The family of Lewis Peeler has run the Cheerwine company since its founding, and his great-grandson, Charles Clifford &quot;Cliff&quot; Ritchie, has been CEO and president of Cheerwine&#x27;s parent company, Carolina Beverage Corporation, since 1992.

Cheerwine has a mildly sweet flavor with strong cherry notes, most notably black cherry; is burgundy-colored; and has an unusually high degree of carbonation compared to other soft drinks. The product was named for its color and taste; the company website states that &quot;it made sense to name a burgundy-red, bubbly, cherry concoction—Cheerwine.&quot; The &quot;Retro Cheerwine&quot; variant is sold in glass bottles and is sweetened with cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. Despite its name, Cheerwine is not really a wine and contains no alcohol.

As of July 2021, Cheerwine&#x27;s ingredients included carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, phosphoric acid, natural and artificial flavors, caffeine, citric acid, sodium benzoate (to protect flavor), and Red 40.

The company also markets Cheerwine-flavored ice cream, sherbet, and cream bars, mainly in Food Lion, a Salisbury, North Carolina–based supermarket chain.

In the mid-1990s Morgan Shepherd ran an entry in the NASCAR Busch Series with Cheerwine sponsorship.

In 2008, a commercially baked Cheerwine cake, based on an old Southern recipe, became available through a Salisbury-based company.

In 2009, the company began a re-branding campaign designed to revamp the drink&#x27;s image, especially among younger consumers. The re-branding called for a redesign of the Cheerwine packaging, with a new, retro-style logo based on an early Cheerwine logo.

In 2010, Cheerwine partnered with the North Carolina–based doughnut company, Krispy Kreme, and released a limited-offered Cheerwine flavored donut on July 1 of that year. It was sold only at select grocery stores for the month of July, and at the Salisbury Krispy Kreme. The Cheerwine doughnut returned again in July 2011.

In 2010, Canton, Ohio–based Old Carolina Barbecue became the first restaurant chain in Ohio to offer Cheerwine as a fountain drink.

By 2014, Cheerwine-based products including iced slushy, Cheerwine cakes and floats had become a signature part of the Old Carolina concept.

During the summers of 2016 and 2017, Cheerwine Kreme, a soda with the flavors of Cheerwine and Krispy Kreme, was sold.

In 2017 the &quot;Cheerwine Recipe Book&quot; was published, by Sandy Carol Sider.

Cheerwine is sometimes mixed with Captain Morgan rum to make a drink called &quot;Captain Cheerwine&quot; or the &quot;Whining Pirate&quot;.

Slogans have included &quot;Born in the South. Raised in a Glass&quot;, &quot;Nectar of the South&quot;, &quot;Betcha can&#x27;t not smile.&quot; and &quot;Uniquely Southern&quot;.

== Availability ==

Cheerwine is currently available in much of the southeastern United States, from Maryland south to Florida, but is better known in the Carolinas. Other spots to find Cheerwine are the many &quot;specialty soda&quot; stores throughout the country, as well as WinCo Foods in Washington state, Cracker Barrel restaurants, Kroger at Ford Rd &amp; Canton Center Rd in Canton, Michigan, Cook Out restaurants, Sheetz convenience stores in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and overseas, in Oslo, Norway. It is sold as a glass bottle, 2 liter, 12 pack or as a pack of four glass bottles, and is available as a fountain drink at some restaurants and convenience stores.

In April 2005, other regions of the United States began to bottle Cheerwine, mainly through Pepsi distributors.

On March 9, 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; Diner&#x27;s Journal referred to &quot;The Expanding Cult of Cheerwine&quot;.

On April 5, 2011, the company announced plans for nationwide distribution by 2017, the product&#x27;s 100th anniversary. The same day, the company also introduced a new advertising campaign, &quot;Born in the South. Raised in a glass.&quot; At the time, Cheerwine was available in 12 percent of the nation. Radio commercials for that campaign include &quot;The Caper&quot;, where criminals left everything from a store except Cheerwine; and &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot;, in which a soldier from the Salisbury area has two bottles sent to him during World War II and gives one to his friend.

Also in April 2011, Cheerwine announced it was searching for a woman to represent the company as &quot;Miss Cheerwine&quot;. Candidates had to be 21 to 25 years old and live in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, or Virginia. A company spokesperson stated, &quot;We’re looking for a poised, enthusiastic young woman who can help us spread the legend and get Cheerwine into the hands of our fans with charm, confidence, sweetness and a sense of fun.&quot; On June 3, 2011, Spencer Cummings, named the first Miss Cheerwine, began the Miss Cheerwine Summer Legend Tour.

On October 18, 2011, Cheerwine announced plans to partner with Pepsi Beverages Co. in Atlanta, Georgia, Florida, and Memphis, Tennessee. The same week, the company began using glass bottles to distribute the &quot;Original 1917 Formula&quot; with sugar, as well as introduced 12-pack cans.

On June 16, 2014, Birmingham&#x27;s Buffalo Rock Co. announced Cheerwine distribution in Alabama, western Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle. This added about 6.5 million potential new customers to their distribution footprint.

<text>Maidenhead Railway Bridge, also known as Maidenhead Viaduct and The Sounding Arch, carries the Great Western Main Line (GWML) over the River Thames between Maidenhead, Berkshire and Taplow, Buckinghamshire, England. It is a single structure of two tall, wide red-brick arches buttressed by two over-land smaller arches. It crosses the river on the Maidenhead-Bray Reach, between Boulter&#x27;s Lock and Bray Lock, and is near-centrally rooted in the downstream end of a very small island.

The Maidenhead Bridge was designed by the Great Western Railway Company engineer, the noted mechanical and civil engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It was completed in 1838, but not brought into use until 1 July 1839. While it was being constructed, the innovative low-rise arches of the structure attracted considerable criticism and controversy, relating to their alleged lack of stability.

As a result, the centring for the arches was left in place until its destruction during a heavy storm in late 1839, despite which the arches stayed up, effectively vindicating Brunel&#x27;s design. During 1861, dual-gauge track was installed across the structure, allowing both broad gauge and standard gauge services to cross it. During the late 1890s, the bridge was widened on either side to allow the structure to carry four standard gauge tracks, a task which was supervised by the civil engineer Sir John Fowler, who placed a high level of importance upon preserving the original design and appearance of the bridge.

Today, the Maidenhead Bridge forms a key crossing along the eastern section of the Great Western Main Line, allowing trains to travel to and from the line&#x27;s terminus in the capital, London Paddington station. During the 2010s, the tracks across the structure were provided with overhead line equipment and associated infrastructure, to allow electric trains to use the route. The Maidenhead Bridge features in &quot;Rain, Steam and Speed – The Great Western Railway&quot;, painted by J. M. W. Turner during 1844, which is now in the National Gallery, London.

The bridge is approximate to the finish line of an annual day of rowing races, known as the Maidenhead Regatta. The Thames towpath passes directly under the right-hand arch (facing upstream), which is also known as the &quot;Sounding Arch&quot;, due to its spectacular echo. During July 2012, the bridge was upgraded to a Grade I listed structure in light of its historical importance. To this day, the arches of the structure remain the flattest ever constructed.

==History==
===Background===
During the 1830s, the famed mechanical and civil engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel developed a plan for a railway running on an east–west alignment in between the key cities of London and Bristol. The line, which became known as the Great Western Railway, displayed exceptional attention to maintaining either level ground, or gentle gradients of no greater than 1 in 1000, on the majority of the route. A key river crossing of the railway occurred between Maidenhead, Berkshire and Taplow, Buckinghamshire, where the line would cross over the Thames, and Brunel himself undertook the design for that structure.

The building of a bridge over the Thames at that location had to make provision for the necessary navigational clearance, so as not to unduly hinder the traditional river shipping present. However, that clearance requirement, when combined with Brunel&#x27;s desire to maintaining a gentle gradient of 1 in 1,320 for the railway lines, posed some problems for the bridge&#x27;s design. Brunel was very averse to allowing any compromise of the gradient which had been set for the whole route, because believed it would negatively affect both passenger comfort and the maximum speeds of trains.

The first plan devised by Brunel for the river crossing was for the building of triple-arch viaduct at the site, but he chose to discard that in favour of the design that was subsequently built and is still in use today. According to author Paul Clements, the design selected by Brunel had been directly inspired by earlier experiments performed by his father, Marc Brunel, during 1832, which Isambard had financed. Isambard employed calculus principles in the designing of the bridge&#x27;s critical semi-elliptical arches which supported the structure. In common with the design of the other large bridges along the line, Brunel achieved a reduction in the forces acting through the brickwork via the adoption of internal longitudinal walls and s. They served to lighten the superstructure above the arches, as well as reducing the overall weight of the bridge.

The bridge carries the railway across the river on a deck supported by a pair of elliptical brick arches which, at the time of their construction, were the widest and flattest in the world. Each arch has a span of , combined with a rise of only . The flatness of the arches was deemed necessary to avoid creating a raised &quot;hump&quot; on the deck of that bridge, which would have gone against Brunel&#x27;s accommodation of the performance the locomotives of the time, and his practice of maximising operational economy by building lines with flat or very gentle gradients (locally 1 in 1,320, which is less than 0.1 per cent), which had the benefit of reducing the running costs of the trains.

===Construction===
On 31 August 1835, the Great Western Railway Act was passed by parliament, authorising the building of the line. Work commenced on its construction during the following year. The resident engineer who oversaw the building of Maidenhead Bridge was John Wallis Hammond, while William Chadwick was appointed as the contractor for the construction of the structure.

As originally built, the Maidenhead Bridge possessed a length of 235 metres and a width of 9.1 metres. It was visually symmetrical about the central river pier, which was founded on top of an existing small island sited roughly midstream in the river. The two main arches had a semi-elliptical shape, each having a span of 39 metres with a very low rise of 7.4 metres. The approach viaducts featured four round-headed flood arches. The short arches nearest the river bank had a span of 6.4 metres while the six flanking arches each had an 8.5 metre span. The elevations were identical and had Doric pilasters positioned between the river and bankside arches, with corniced parapets throughout, while the deck comprised a series of stone slabs. The brickwork, both on the elevations and under the arches, was executed in London stock brick.

The innovative low-rise arches over the Thames became the subject of considerable controversy concerning their stability or purported lack thereof. During the construction of the bridge, the timber centring used to build the arches was eased; on the eastern arch, the three lowest rings of brickwork began to settle, separating from the body of the arch across a section of between 7.6 metres and 9.1 metres. Critics were keen to cite that up as proof that the design of the arches was flawed. However, it was soon established that the problem was the result of the mortar having not been fully hardened, while it also appeared worse on the spandrels than midway underneath the arches. During July 1838, William Chadwick, the contractor, acknowledged his responsibility for the situation.

Remedial work was carried out before the centring was eased again in October 1838, and it was then left in place over the winter. Author E.T. MacDermot has claimed that, as the bridge neared completion, the board of the Great Western Railway themselves had doubts that the arches would be able to stay up under the weight of passing trains and issued an order to Brunel, instructing him to leave the wooden formwork used to construct the arches in place. However, Brunel decided to lower it slightly so that it provided no structural effect, although it gave the appearance of supporting the bridge. Later on, the formwork was washed away during heavy flooding, but the bridge remained standing with no ill effects. In the light of that, the strength of the arches was finally accepted and Brunel&#x27;s design was vindicated.

===Operational life===
As built and opened on 1 July 1839, the bridge carried a pair of Brunel&#x27;s broad gauge railway tracks over the Thames. Over the following decades, traffic to and from London increased enormously. During 1861, work was carried out to install mixed gauge tracks throughout the route between London and Bristol, allowing standard gauge traffic to traverse the structure.

In anticipation of the final conversion of all broad gauge tracks to the standard rail gauge, which occurred during 1890–1892, the bridge was widened on each side to carry four standard gauge tracks. That work was carried out under the supervision of the civil engineer Sir John Fowler, the width overall being increased from to . The expansion was undertaken sympathetically, resulting in the outward shape of the bridge remaining almost unaltered, but the new elevations and arches were constructed using the redder Cattybrook brick. The pre-existing London stock brick arches were also encased in Cattybrook brick to ensure uniformity of colour, causing the distinctive chamfered step between the original Brunel arch and Fowler&#x27;s additions. To avoid any differential settlement between the old and new sections, the foundation extensions were close piled and covered with a timber grillage, before being filled with concrete.

During 1950, the western half of the bridge was awarded Grade II* listing and, in April 1985, the eastern half also received the same level of listing. During July 2012, the Maidenhead Railway Bridge was upgraded to Grade I listed status by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, following consultation with English Heritage.

===Modifications for Crossrail===
The Crossrail development, which created the Elizabeth line, saw the long-delayed overhead electrification of the Great Western line between Paddington and Reading. At one stage, to accommodate construction activity in the area, it had been planned for a temporary construction depot to be created in Guards Club Park, immediately adjacent to the Maidenhead Bridge on the Berkshire side. However, the depot was never established, although the bridge itself still underwent some modification to accommodate the installation of overhead line equipment and associated infrastructure. The latest Crossrail Environmental Statement: states:

&quot;The OHLE (Overhead Line Equipment) requires that supporting posts be founded on the bridge structure. These will be positioned so as not to disrupt the symmetry of the bridge. Three sets of masts will be fixed at the bridge supports and a further two sets will be fixed at the far ends of the bridge. The masts will be fixed such that they may be removed in the future without damaging the bridge as it stands today.&quot;
The report also states:

&quot;It is proposed that the OHLE over Maidenhead railway bridge will use masts with wires suspended from cantilevers, since these will be visually lighter structures than the gantries to be used along other parts of the route. The masts will however, have a significant adverse landscape impact: they will affect important views along the river and the character of the river corridor; they will affect the setting of the Riverside Conservation Area; and they will affect the setting of the listed railway bridge and the setting of the adjacent Grade I listed road bridge.&quot;

As a means of reducing the visual impact of the electrification infrastructure on the historic bridge area, the possibility of adopting third rail electrification for that section of the line was proposed. However, following a study of that option, the use of a third rail was rejected.

==The Matador series==
The Matador series chronicles the birth, evolution, victory, and aftermath of a rebellion that overthrows a corrupt and declining interstellar government (&quot;The Confederation&quot;) based on Earth. The Matador series features a fictional martial art known as &quot;Sumito&quot; or &quot;The 97 Steps&quot;. Many of the non-English words and place names are actually in the Esperanto language.

===&quot;The Man Who Never Missed&quot;===

The rebellion proper begins in &quot;The Man Who Never Missed&quot;, in which Emile Khadaji deserts from the Confederation military after a particularly bloody battle and religious experience, eventually joining up with a bartending martial artist monk named Pen, who teaches Khadaji the art used by his order, Sumito (&quot;The 97 steps&quot;), before setting him on his own path. Khadaji learns economics and politics and military science and eventually decides he has to overthrow the Confederation. This he does by setting up a bar on a planet named Greaves, and while luring soldiers in by day, hunts and paralyzes them by night. Over many months, he paralyzes 2,388 of the 10,000 troops on the planet, only missing with a handful of shots, which he carefully conceals. Eventually, as the first paralyzed soldier awakens, he attacks the commander, is trapped in his bar, and apparently killed.

Afterward, the Confederation military realize that he apparently knocked out almost 2,400 soldiers without missing a single time, a record which becomes a legend, striking fear into the Confederation military ranks.

Juete who appears here is one of the major characters in &quot;The Omega Cage&quot;.

Kamus first appeared in two short stories by J. Michael Reaves in Volume 8 of the &quot;Weird Heroes&quot; series from Pyramid Books. One of the stories is mentioned here.

<text>Mosta () is a small but densely populated city in the Northern Region of Malta. The most prominent building in Mosta is the Rotunda, a large basilica built by its parishioners&#x27; volunteer labour. It features the world&#x27;s 3rd largest unsupported dome, and displays a replica of a German bombshell that famously crashed through the dome but did not detonate upon impact.

Mosta celebrates the parish feast of the Assumption every 15 August. Mosta&#x27;s feast day celebration is popular amongst both locals and tourists. The city is annually decorated by local parishioners and townspeople, seeking to demonstrate their affection for the city and its patron saint, weeks ahead of the public procession.

==General==

=== History ===
Mosta has been inhabited since pre-history. Dolmens in the limits of Mosta and cart ruts are primary evidence of this. Each dolmen has two rectangular standing stones and one other similar stone positioned horizontally above the other two.

In the Middle Ages, Mosta was a small hamlet amongst a number of other hamlets, each sparsely populated. These tiny villages were Raħal Calleja, Raħal Ħobla, Raħal Pessa or Pise, Raħal Sir, Raħal Kircipulli, Raħal Brabar and Raħal Dimech. In the 16th century, these hamlets decreased in importance and Mosta took its place as the principal village. The Apostolic Visit of Mgr Pietro Dusina in 1575 indicated that even the church dedicated to the Assumption that stood in Mosta was so important in the area that it was erroneously called ‘parochial church’. In 1575, there were 580 persons living in Mosta.

Mosta is, in contemporary times, witnessing the construction of many new houses. New built-up zones with residential houses are found on the outskirts of older Mosta. These new zones are known as: Santa Margerita, Tal-Blata l-Għolja, Iż-Żokrija, Is-Sgħajtar and Ta’ Mlit. This means that the population of Mosta is increasing. Mosta has also become a bustling commercial centre. All these developments have made Mosta a big town by local standards and it is today amongst the largest in the Maltese Islands.

=== Transportation ===
As Mosta is at the centre of Malta; buses pass through Mosta on the way to Buġibba, Burmarrad, St. Paul&#x27;s Bay, Qawra, Xemxija, Mġarr, Ċirkewwa and Mellieħa.

=== Legends ===
The town has several legends such as &quot;The Bride of Mosta&quot; (L-Għarusa tal-Mosta).

=== Social Groups ===
Mosta has its own scouts and girl guides, two band clubs (Nicolo&#x27; Isouard and Santa Marija), and two fireworks factories (Santa Marija and 15 ta&#x27; Awwissu). A lot of traffic passes through Constitution Street, one of Mosta&#x27;s main streets, connecting the south to the north.

==Places of interest==

=== Sanctuary Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady (also known as the Rotunda of Mosta or the Mosta Dome) ===

Mosta boasts the third largest unsupported dome in the world. The church, also commonly known as the Rotunda of Mosta or the Mosta Dome, is dedicated to the Assumption. The Feast of the Assumption is held on 15 August and it is a public holiday in Malta.

From its inception as a parish in 1608, Mosta has had three different churches built on the same site, with the current one being designed by Giorgio Grognet de Vassé, a French resident of Mosta. The &quot;Mostin&quot; at that time, totalling not more than 1500, built the church.

Grognet’s design was based on that of the Pantheon of Rome. Due to debates and doubts regarding the design, the first stone was laid on 30 May 1833. The rotunda has a diameter of 55.20 metres on the outside and 39.60 metres on the inside. The main façade faces south and has six columns in the Ionic style. On each side, a steeple rises from the façade. Following the front elevation, the church has an analogous style at the back, but without steeples. The dome was built on the principle of the catenary profile, meaning that each stone was laid over the one underneath it.

The church took 27 years to complete and became a major attraction. On 9 April 1942, the church was nearly destroyed during World War II. An Axis bomb hit the dome of the church whilst people were inside, but it failed to explode. The detonator was removed and a replica bomb is now displayed as a memorial.

=== Lion monument in Rotunda Square ===
A prominent feature of Rotunda Square is a statue of a lion on a pedestal, which was removed in 2023 and placed in the public garden behind the church. Once, this was part of a fountain which originally was in Sliema. The fountain has since been removed. The statue is made of bronze-coloured cast iron. It was made in the Val d’Osne Foundry in Paris. Embossed on the pedestal there are the coat-of-arms of Mosta and those of independent Malta.

=== Ta&#x27; Bistra Catacombs ===
The Ta&#x27; Bistra Catacombs are the largest set of catacombs found to date outside Rabat, and are located in Triq il-Missjunarji Maltin in Mosta. These catacombs were first recorded in the 1800s but were only investigated in 1933 by Captain Charles Zammit, before part of the site was covered over by a new road leading down to Burmarrad. Further studies in 2004, 2013, and 2014, have brought the site back to life with new discoveries. This site has been part of three EU-funded projects and is now managed by Heritage Malta.

===Speranza Chapel (Chapel of Our Lady of Hope)===
An attraction in Mosta is the Speranza Chapel in the Speranza Valley. The chapel was built between 1760 and 1761. A legend tied to the Chapel recounts that, during a Turkish invasion, a young girl and her sisters taking care of their family&#x27;s sheep were at risk to be taken by the invaders. Whilst the sisters escaped, the young girl could not run fast enough because she limped slightly. It is said that she hid in a cave found under the chapel&#x27;s left side. Meanwhile, she prayed to Mary, promising that if she were saved, she would build a chapel dedicated to Our Lady. When the Turkish invaders chasing her arrived, they didn&#x27;t look for her in the cave because they thought the girl could not be hiding there as there was an intact web at the entrance, which would have been damaged had she entered the cave.

===Marquis Mallia Tabone Farmhouse===
The Marquis Mallia Tabone Farmhouse is a folklore attraction run by the &quot;Talent Mosti&quot; philanthropy in collaboration with the adjacent school&#x27;s council. The farmhouse overlooks the valley of Wied il-Għasel. It houses exhibitions varying from paintings, photography, artisan work, hobbies and a permanent folklore museum.

=== Wied Filep Dolmens ===
Two dolmens, dating back to the Bronze Age, can be seen in a field between Vjal Ragusa and Dawret il-Wied.

===Cumbo Tower===
The Cumbo Tower is a fortified residence in Mosta. In the grounds there is a small Christian family tomb from the Roman era.

== Other sites of interest ==

=== Tal-Għammariet Hypogeum ===
This is a site that has most likely been destroyed, and has been recorded by Emmanuel Magri as being in the hamlet of Ħal Dimech, now part of Mosta, and not far from the Ta&#x27; Bistra Catacombs.

=== Fort Mosta Catacomb ===
Within the grounds of Fort Mosta, there is a small catacomb. Originally, this was a Punic shaft tomb but it was enlarged into a Roman period catacomb complete with an agape table. This site is within the confines of Fort Mosta which is used by the Armed Forces of Malta.

=== Wied il-Għasel Catacomb ===
Another small catacomb is found in Wied il-Għasel, consisting of a series of seven tombs dug in the rock in a semi-circular form found in the side of a natural cave beneath Fort Mosta.

=== Alleged Roman Temple site ===
In a 2008 publication, then Mosta Mayor Dr Paul Chetcuti Caruana stated: &quot;As many know, and no one knows, in the neighbourhood of Ta’ Bistra there is at least one Roman temple which has been buried by the speculators.&quot;

<doc id="1008396" wikidata="Q510657" url="?curid=1008396" title="Duck, You Sucker!">
<text>Duck, You Sucker! (, lit. &quot;Duck Your Head&quot;, &quot;Get Down&quot;), also known as A Fistful of Dynamite and Once Upon a Time ... the Revolution, is a 1971 epic Zapata Western film directed and co-written by Sergio Leone and starring Rod Steiger, James Coburn, and Romolo Valli.

Set during the Mexican Revolution of the 1910s, the film tells the story of Juan Miranda, an amoral Mexican outlaw, and John Mallory, a former member of the Irish Volunteer Army. After they accidentally meet under less-than-friendly circumstances, Juan and John involuntarily become heroes of the Revolution, despite being forced to make heavy sacrifices.

It is the second film of Leone&#x27;s unofficial &quot;Once Upon a Time Trilogy&quot;, which includes the previous &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968) and the subsequent &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984). The last western film directed by Leone, it is considered by some to be one of his most overlooked films.

== Plot ==
In Revolution-torn 1913 Mexico, outlaw Juan Miranda leads a family of bandits, robs a coach of wealthy men and rapes a female passenger who insulted him. Passing by on a motorcycle is John H. Mallory, an Irish Republican explosives expert, who works in Mexico as a silver prospector. Juan asks John (who initially states his name as &quot;Seán&quot;) to help him rob the Mesa Verde National Bank. After John refuses, Juan frames him for the murder of his employer and several soldiers, making him a wanted criminal and offering to &quot;protect&quot; him in exchange for his help. John reluctantly agrees but escapes on the way to Mesa Verde.

Arriving in the city before Juan, John makes contact with revolutionaries led by physician Dr. Villega and agrees to use his explosives in their service. When Juan arrives, John inducts him into the revolutionaries&#x27; ranks. The bank is hit as part of an orchestrated attack on the Mexican army. Juan, interested only in money, is shocked to find that the bank has no funds and is instead being used by the army as a political prison. After freeing several prisoners, Juan inadvertently becomes a &quot;glorious hero of the revolution&quot;.

The revolutionaries are chased into the hills by an army detachment led by Colonel Gunther Ruiz. John and Juan volunteer to stay behind, armed with machine guns and dynamite. Much of the detachment is destroyed while crossing a bridge which John explodes. Ruiz, however, survives. After the battle, John and Juan find most of their comrades, including Juan&#x27;s father and children, have been killed by the army. Enraged, Juan decides to fight the army single-handed and is captured. John sneaks into camp, where other revolutionaries are being executed by firing squad. They were informed on by Dr. Villega, who has been tortured by Ruiz and his men. This evokes in John memories of a similar betrayal by Nolan, his best friend in Ireland. Nolan identified John, who killed two British soldiers and then killed Nolan, making himself a fugitive and forcing him to flee Ireland. Juan is facing a firing squad when John saves him with dynamite.

After escaping on a motorcycle, John and Juan hide in the animal coach of a train. It stops to pick up the tyrannical Governor Don Jaime, who is fleeing (with a small fortune) from revolutionary forces. As the train is ambushed, John lets Juan choose between shooting Jaime and accepting a bribe from him. Juan kills Jaime, also stealing the Governor&#x27;s spoils. Juan and John decide to flee to America with the money, but as the door opens, Juan is greeted by the revolutionaries. The money is taken away by the revolutionaries, so Juan and John are forced to stay in Mexico.

On a train with commanders of the revolution, John and Juan are joined by Dr. Villega, who has escaped. John alone knows of Villega&#x27;s betrayal. Pancho Villa&#x27;s forces will be delayed by twenty-four hours, and a train carrying a thousand soldiers and heavy weapons, led by Ruiz, will arrive that evening, which will surely overpower the rebel position. John suggests they rig a locomotive with dynamite and send it head on. He requires one other man, but instead of picking Juan, who volunteers, he chooses Villega. Villega realizes that John knows of the betrayal but does not judge him. John pleads with him to jump off the locomotive before it hits the army&#x27;s train, but Villega feels guilty and stays on board. John jumps in time, and the trains collide, killing Villega and several Mexican soldiers.

The revolutionaries&#x27; ambush is successful, but as John approaches to meet Juan, he is shot by Ruiz. Enraged, Juan kills Ruiz with a machine gun. As John lies dying, he continues to have memories of Nolan, and of a woman they both apparently loved. Juan kneels by his side to ask about Villega. John only says that Villega died a hero of the revolution. As Juan goes to seek help, John sets off a second charge he secretly laid in case the battle went bad. Horrified, Juan later stares at John&#x27;s burning remains and forlornly asks, &quot;What about me?&quot;

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The development of &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; began during the production of &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, when Sergio Leone&#x27;s collaborator Sergio Donati presented him with an early treatment of the film. Around the same time, political riots had broken out in Paris, and the ideals of revolution and left-wing nationalism had become popular among university students and filmmakers across Europe. Leone, who had used his previous films to deconstruct the romanticization of the American Old West, decided to use &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; to deconstruct the romanticized nature of revolution, and to shed light on the political instability of contemporary Italy.

Leone, Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni worked together on the film&#x27;s screenplay for three to four weeks, discussing characters and scenes for the film. Donati, who had previously acted as an uncredited script doctor for &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, conceived Juan Miranda&#x27;s character as an extension of Tuco from &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;. Meanwhile, Leone was largely responsible for the character of John Mallory, and the film&#x27;s focus on the development of John and Juan&#x27;s friendship. At times, however, Leone, Donati, and Vincenzoni found that they had highly differing opinions about how the film should be made, with Leone wanting to have the film produced on a large scale with an epic quality, while Donati and Vincenzoni perceived the film as a low-budget thriller.

Leone never intended to direct &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot;, and wanted the film to be directed by someone who could replicate his visual style. Peter Bogdanovich, his original choice for director, soon abandoned the film due to perceived lack of control. Sam Peckinpah then agreed to direct the film after Bogdanovich&#x27;s departure, only to be turned down for financial reasons by United Artists. Donati and Vincenzoni, noting the director&#x27;s frequent embellishment of the facts concerning his films, claim that Peckinpah did not even consider it - Donati stated that Peckinpah was &quot;too shrewd to be produced by a fellow director&quot;. Leone then recruited his regular assistant director, Giancarlo Santi, to direct, with Leone supervising proceedings, and Santi was in charge for the first ten days of shooting. However, Rod Steiger refused to play his role as Juan unless Leone himself directed, and the producers pressured him into directing the film. Leone reluctantly agreed, and Santi was relegated to second unit work.
The inspiration for the firing squad scene came from Francisco Goya, and in particular from his set of prints &quot;The Disasters of War&quot;. Leone showed the prints to director of photography Giuseppe Ruzzolini in order to get the lighting and color effects he wanted. The film is believed to have been influenced by Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, and it shares some plot elements with &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot;, a western film also starring Coburn and released a year later. Leone biographer and film historian Sir Christopher Frayling noted that &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; was made in a period of Italian cinema where filmmakers were &#x27;rethinking&#x27; their relationship with fascism and the Nazi occupation of Rome. He has identified numerous references to both World Wars in the film, such as Colonel Reza&#x27;s commanding of an armored car resembling a Nazi tank commander, the massacre of Juan&#x27;s family (which bears similarities to the Ardeatine massacre of 1944), and an execution victim resembling Benito Mussolini.

=== Casting ===
Casting the lead roles of &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; proved to be a difficult process. The role of John Mallory was written for Jason Robards, who had played Cheyenne in &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, but the studio wanted a bigger name for his character. Clint Eastwood was then approached by Leone for the role, but he saw it as just a different take of the same character he had already played in the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;, and he also wanted to end his association with the Italian film industry. As a result, he declined the offer and starred in &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; instead. George Lazenby was then approached to play John, but he declined. A young Malcolm McDowell, then mostly known for his performance in &quot;if...&quot;, was considered for both John and Nolan, John&#x27;s Irish friend, but Leone eventually settled on James Coburn to play John. Coburn had previously been considered for other Leone projects, including &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;. He had also previously been considered for a role in another United Artists-financed Zapata Western, Sergio Corbucci&#x27;s &quot;The Mercenary&quot;, but Franco Nero was later cast in what was originally his role.

The role of Juan Miranda was written for Eli Wallach, based on his performance of Tuco in &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, but Wallach had already committed to another project with Jean-Paul Belmondo. After Leone begged Wallach to play the part, he dropped out of the other project to play Juan. However, Rod Steiger owed the studio another film and they refused to back the picture unless Steiger was used. Leone offered no compensation to Wallach, and Wallach subsequently sued.

Leone was initially dissatisfied with Steiger&#x27;s performance in that he played his character as a serious, Zapata-like figure. As a result, tensions rose between Steiger and Leone numerous times, including an incident that ended with Steiger walking off during the filming of the scene when John destroys Juan&#x27;s stagecoach. After the film&#x27;s completion, Leone and Steiger were content with the final result, and Steiger was known to praise Leone for his skills as a director.

=== Filming ===

Exterior filming mostly took place in Andalusia, southern Spain. Some of the locations used previously featured in Leone&#x27;s &quot;Dollar Trilogy&quot; films; for example, the Almería Railway Station, used for the train sequence in &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;, returns in this film as Mesa Verde&#x27;s station. The flashback scenes with Sean and friends were shot in Ireland at Howth Castle in Dublin, and Toner&#x27;s Pub on Baggot Street, Dublin. As filming progressed, Leone modified the script: as he did not originally plan on directing &quot;Duck, You Sucker&quot;, he thought the script was &quot;conceived for an American filmmaker&quot;. &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; was one of the last mainstream films shot in Techniscope.

Antonio Margheriti claims to have done the miniature work on the film, particularly the train sequences. Alberto De Martino filmed second unit of the final battle.

=== Music ===
The musical score for &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; was composed by Ennio Morricone, who collaborated with Leone in all his previous projects as a director with the exception of his debut, &quot;The Colossus of Rhodes&quot;. Elvis Mitchell, former film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, considered it as one of Morricone&#x27;s &quot;most glorious and unforgettable scores&quot;. He also sees &quot;Invention for John&quot;, which plays over the opening credits and is essentially the film&#x27;s theme, &quot;as epic and truly wondrous as anything Morricone ever did&quot;. A soundtrack album was released in the United States in 1972, and many tracks can be found in Morricone&#x27;s compilation albums. Music was recorded in April 1971 and second recording sessions in August/September the same year. A 35th anniversary OST was issued in 2006 with previously unreleased alternate takes.

== Themes ==
Despite the politically charged setting, &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; was not intended as a political film: Leone himself said that the Mexican Revolution in the film is meant only as a symbol, not as a representation of the real one, and that it was chosen because of its fame and its relationship with cinema, and he contends that the real theme of the film is friendship:

Another theme is amoral non-engagement: Juan is very loyal to his family (consisting of his six children, each from a different mother), but he cannot be trusted by anyone else. He is also very cynical about priests, and he doesn&#x27;t care about codified law. This relates most closely to those aspects of Southern Italian life observed by Edward Banfield and others.

The film also explores the relationship between Mexican bandits and peasant communities at the time of the revolution, idealized by figures like Juan José Herrera and Elfego Baca, which Leone may have had in mind in his creation of the character of Juan.

== Release and reaction ==
=== Performance ===
The film was moderately successful in Italy, where it grossed 1,829,402,000 lire on its first run; it was the third-highest grossing Spaghetti Western at the Italian box office that year, behind &quot;Trinity is Still My Name&quot; (which overtook &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; as the highest-grossing film ever released in Italy at that time) and &quot;Red Sun&quot;. Although it was the lowest-grossing of Leone&#x27;s five Westerns in Italy by a notable margin, it was also the highest-grossing Zapata Western released there. In France, it was the fourth most popular film released there in 1972, behind &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;Stadium Nuts&quot; and &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;.

=== Reception ===
&quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; failed to gain any substantial recognition from the critics at the time of debut, especially compared to Leone&#x27;s other films, though he did win the David di Donatello for Best Director. Since then, however, it has received a more favorable reception: on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Duck, You Sucker&quot; is a saucy helping of spaghetti western, with James Coburn and Rod Steiger&#x27;s chemistry igniting the screen and Sergio Leone&#x27;s bravura style on full display&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; praised it for its &quot;marvelous sense of detail and spectacular effects&quot;. &quot;The New York Observer&quot; argues that Leone&#x27;s direction, Morricone&#x27;s score and the leads&#x27; performance &quot;ignite an emotional explosion comparable to that of &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;&quot;. In Mexico, where the film is known as &quot;Los Héroes de Mesa Verde&quot;, it was refused classification and effectively banned until 1979 because it was considered offensive to the Mexican people and the Revolution.

=== Release history ===

The film was originally released in the United States in 1972 as &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot;, and ran for 121 minutes. Many scenes were cut because they were deemed too violent, profane or politically sensitive, including a quote from Mao Zedong about the nature of revolutions and class struggle. Theatrical prints were generally of poor quality, and the film was marketed as a light-hearted spiritual successor to the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;, not at all as Leone intended, and it did not succeed in gaining press notice. In part because of this, United Artists reissued the film under the new name of &quot;A Fistful of Dynamite&quot;, meant to recall the notoriety of &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;. According to Peter Bogdanovich, the original title &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; was meant by Leone as a close translation of the Italian title &quot;Giù la testa, coglione!&quot; (translated: &quot;Duck your head, dumbass!&quot;), which he contended to be a common American colloquialism. The expletive &quot;coglione&quot; (a vulgar way to say &quot;testicle&quot;) was later removed to avoid censorship issues. One of the working titles, &quot;Once Upon a Time... the Revolution&quot;, was also used for some European releases.

In 1989, Image Entertainment released the film on laserdisc, including some material cut from the original US version and lasting 138 minutes. This version was released in Europe as &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;, again intended to evoke an earlier Leone film, &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;.

Subsequent re-releases have largely used the title &quot;A Fistful of Dynamite&quot;, although the DVD appearing in &quot;The Sergio Leone Anthology&quot; box set, released by MGM in 2007, used the original English language title of &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot;.

The film&#x27;s first English language DVD was released by MGM in the UK in 2003. This version of the film runs 154 minutes and is almost complete, but it uses a truncated version of the film&#x27;s final four-minute-long flashback. In 2005, following the restoration of Leone&#x27;s &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, MGM re-released the film in the UK with more supplemental material, the aforementioned flashback scene reinstated and with a newly created 5.1 surround soundtrack. The restored version had a brief art house theatrical run in the U.S. and was subsequently released there in a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; in 2007. The remastered surround tracks have attracted criticism online for the replacement of certain music cues throughout the film (most prominently during the last two flashback scenes and the end credits) and for censoring at least two expletives from the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Furthermore, it has been reported that the mono soundtrack included on the 2007 Collector&#x27;s Edition is not the original mix, but simply a fold-down of the surround remaster.

&quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; was shown in 2009 as part of the Cannes Classics series of the 62nd Cannes Film Festival. The print used for the festival was restored by the Cineteca di Bologna and the film laboratory Immagine Ritrovata.

In October 2014, MGM released the film on Blu-ray, akin to its Blu-ray releases of the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;.

<doc id="1008402" wikidata="Q3431697" url="?curid=1008402" title="Hepingli Subdistrict, Beijing">
<text>Hepingli Subdistrict () is a residential neighborhood and a subdistrict of Dongcheng District, Beijing. It is situated in the northeastern part of the city between the northern 2nd Ring Road and the northern 3rd Ring Road. The neighborhood is bordered by Andingmen Waidajie to the west and Hepingli Dongjie to the east.

Hepingli has 102,227 residents in 2020, and comprises 20 residential areas () or zones. Most apartment buildings were built in the 1950s to 1960s. In the early 2000s, most buildings were repainted.

==History and Name==

Heplingli, meaning “a place of peace”, was named in 1952 during the Asia and Pacific Rim Peace Conference which was held in Beijing.

Below is a table summarizing the changes in the administrative status of the land within Hepingli:
== Administrative Division ==

As of 2021, there are 20 communities within the subdistrict:
== Transportation==

Hepingli is served by Lines 5 and 13 of the Beijing Subway. Line 5 traverses the neighborhood from north to south with stops at Heping West Bridge and Hepingli Beijie. Line 13 stops near eastern Hepingli at Liufang.

Main city bus routes through Hepingli include 13, 18, 62, 75, 104, 108, 116, 117, 119, 124, 125, 127, 407, 430, and 特16.

The Heping West and East Bridges on the 3rd Ring Road are named after Heplingli. The Hepingli Railway Station was replaced by the Liufang Station of the Line 13. The area has an expressway link—the Jingcheng Expressway connects to Hepingli at Taiyanggong Bridge.

<text>Aargau Southern Railway () is a former railway company in Switzerland. Between 1873 and 1882, the Schweizerische Centralbahn (SCB) and the Schweizerische Nordostbahn (NOB) jointly built a connecting line to the Gotthardbahn. The line was operated by the SCB and ran from Rupperswil to Immensee. Branch lines ran from Wohlen to Bremgarten and from Hendschiken to Brugg.

==History==
The routes were opened in this order:
* 23 June 1874: Rupperswil - Lenzburg - Hendschiken - Wohlen
* 1 June 1875: Wohlen - Muri
* 1 September 1876: Wohlen - Bremgarten West
* 1 December 1881: Muri - Immensee
* 1 June 1882: Hendschiken - Brugg

In 1902, the Aargauische Südbahn (together with the SCB and NOB) became part of the Swiss Federal Railways.

<doc id="1008406" wikidata="Q629881" url="?curid=1008406" title="Celbridge">
<text>Celbridge (; ) is a town and townland on the River Liffey in County Kildare, Ireland. It is west of Dublin. Both a local centre and a commuter town within the Greater Dublin Area, it is located at the intersection of the R403 and R405 regional roads. As of the 2022 census, Celbridge was the third largest town in County Kildare by population, with 20,601 residents.

The town originated in the 13th century, the name Cill Droichid being anglicised to Celbridge after 1714.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Celbridge&quot; is derived from the Irish &quot;Cill Droichid&quot; meaning &quot;Church of bridge&quot; or &quot;Church by the bridge&quot;. The Irish name was historically anglicised as &quot;Kildroicht&quot;, &quot;Kildrought&quot;, &quot;Kildroght&quot;, &quot;Kildrout&quot; ().

==Demographics==
Celbridge is the third largest town in County Kildare. The population increased by 7.8% between 2002 and 2006, the town&#x27;s most rapid growth rate in absolute terms (3,011 in four years). However, in percentage terms, it was a slowdown on previous growth rates which were at one stage the highest in Ireland. Celbridge&#x27;s growth slowed down to 1.5% between 2016 and 2022, reaching a population of 20,601 as of the census of 2022.

Of the 2006 population of 17,262. 8,732 were male and 8,530 female, 4,307 (25pc) were aged 0–14, 2,678 (15.5pc) were aged 15–24, 6,219 (35pc) were aged 35–44, 3,400 (19.7pc) were aged 45–64 and 658 (3.6pc) were aged 65 years and over. Of these 9,586 were single, 6,602 were married, 715 were widowed and 359 were separated. Only 4,146 (24.4pc) of the 16,980 who were recorded by the census as &quot;usually resident in Celbridge&quot; had been born in County Kildare. 10,071 (59.3pc) had been born elsewhere in Ireland and 2,763 (16.3pc) were born outside Ireland.

==Churches==
Celbridges&#x27;s two main active parish churches are those of St. Patrick (Catholic) and Christ Church (Church of Ireland). St Patrick&#x27;s forms part of the Catholic Parish of Celbridge and Straffan within the Archdiocese of Dublin.

Christ Church is the Anglican Parish Church for Celbridge and forms part of the grouped Parish of Celbridge, Straffan and Newcastle-Lyons in the Archdiocese of Dublin and Diocese of Glendalough.

The Bridge Church is a non-denominational independent church formed in 2005. The congregation is made of more than 200 adults and children drawn from many nations. Its current pastor is Paul R Carley, who founded the church. Pastor Carley has ministered in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Belarus and Kenya.


==Education==
Celbridge has six primary schools: Primrose Hill (co-ed, COI), St Brigid&#x27;s (girls, RC), Aghards also known as Scoil Mochua (mixed, RC), Scoil na Mainistreach (mixed, RC), North Kildare Educate Together National School (mixed, multi-denominational), and St Patrick&#x27;s currently located in the GAA grounds on the Newcastle road (mixed, RC); and three secondary schools: Celbridge Community School (a coeducational school, operating under the auspices of the Kildare/Wicklow Education &amp; Training Board and Educate Together.), St. Wolstan&#x27;s Community School for girls (the only all-female community school in Ireland), and Salesian College Celbridge for boys.

There is also a residential special school, Saint Raphael&#x27;s, (co-educational, Catholic) for children with a learning disability. Celbridge also has one of the very few Primary Montessori Schools in Ireland, Weston Primary Montessori School, which was established in 2016 by the parents and teachers of the former Glebe School. This school provides Montessori education to children from 3–12 years and is located on the grounds of Barnhall Rugby Club.

==Transport and access==
Celbridge&#x27;s growth has created some traffic congestion, including at peak times. A 2008 report by Kildare County Council attributed some of the issues to the single bridge over the Liffey in the town, and issues with illegal parking and parking enforcement. The Celbridge Interchange (Junction 6 of the M4) which connects the town to the motorway as well as the Intel and Hewlett-Packard plants in Leixlip, was opened in 2003 to help address related traffic issues, with some success.

The town is served by Dublin Bus along the C4, X27 and X28 routes along with a night time service (C6). Local services are also provided by Dublin Bus, as the L58 and L59, while Go-Ahead Ireland operate the W61. These routes link the town to the city centre, as well as to the nearby towns of Lucan, Maynooth and Leixlip. The Town is also served by Bus Éireann route 120 and 120B.

Iarnród Éireann runs commuter rail services to a station in Hazelhatch, about from Celbridge. The L58, L59 and W61 bus services link the station with the rest of Celbridge, Leixlip, and Maynooth, providing connections to other bus and rail routes. &quot;Commuter&quot; suburban rail services from Kildare to Dublin city centre serve Hazelhatch, although these are quite limited on Sundays. The service brings passengers to Heuston station or to Grand Canal Dock (via Connolly Station, Tara Street and Pearse Street stations). The station is located on one of the most important &quot;InterCity&quot; lines in the country, with services to Cork, Limerick and Galway, however, these do not stop at Hazelhatch station.

==Sport and voluntary groups==

===GAA===
Celbridge GAA park and centre on the Hazelhatch Road was opened in 1996, ending 52 years without a home, the club having lost its field in Ballymakeally after a court case in 1944. Celbridge GAA club is the third oldest club in County Kildare, formed on 15 August 1885, eight months after the GAA was founded in Thurles. In 1890 there were two clubs in the parish: Celbridge Shamrocks, based in Kilwogan with 64 members, and the Irish Harpers at Hazelhatch, with 70 members.

Celbridge play at senior level in both codes. They won their first Kildare Senior Football Championship in 2008. Celbridge GAA had won its first Kildare Senior Hurling Championship in 1921. Success in the top hurling competition in Kildare would not arrive until 2005 when Celbridge, managed by Jimmy Doyle, beat Coill Dubh in the final. Following a number of semi-final defeats, a &quot;three in a row&quot; of hurling titles came in 2009, 2010 and 2011. After defeat in the 2012 decider to Confey, Celbridge reclaimed the title in 2013. The club has won the Kildare Senior Camogie Championship in 2005, 2006 and 2010, and won the U21 football county championship in 2012 and 2014.

===Association football===
The town has two clubs. Celbridge Town AFC, which was formed in 1959 and plays its home games in St Patricks Park. Ballyoulster United FC, which was formed in 1968 and plays its home games at Louglinstown road. Both clubs compete in the Leinster Senior League.

===Golf and pitch and putt===
Celbridge Elm Hall Golf Club is a 9-hole parkland course located adjacent to Celbridge / Hazelhatch train station on the Loughlinstown Road. Celbridge&#x27;s 18 hole championship pitch and putt course meets PPUI standards.

===Athletics===
Local resident Mark Kenneally represented Ireland in the marathon at the 2012 London Summer Olympics. George Magan was Irish cross country champion in 1920 and 1922, Irish Mile champion in 1919, 1921 and 1922, Irish 880 yards champion in 1918, 1919 and 1921, and Irish four-mile (6 km) champion in 1921. Jack Guiney was Irish champion in the triple jump and shot in 1937.

Celbridge Athletic Club is active locally, and has over 500 participants across all ages.

===Rugby===
Celbridge Rugby Club, founded by Fr Joseph Furlong, competed in the Towns Cup in 1928/29. Celbridge players compete in the All Ireland League with MU Barnhall.

===Watersports===
Celbridge Paddlers canoeclub is a multidiscipline kayaking club, which was formed in 1984 and is affiliated to the Irish Canoe Union. The annual Liffey Descent Canoe Race passes through Celbridge, where competitors have to navigate the Vanessa weir and Castletown rapids.

===Other sports===
Celbridge Tennis Club was founded in 1923, and the club&#x27;s premises on Hazelhatch Road were opened in the 1970s.

Celbridge horse racecourse is mentioned in the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; of 27 September 1763 and 4 October 1763, but was not in use after the end of the 18th century. Locally trained horse Workman, trained by Jack Ruttle out of Hazelhatch Stud, was the winner of the Aintree Grand National in 1939. A point-to-point meeting was held at nearby Windgaps 1912–1954.

A cricket club was active from 1880 to 1902. Kildare County Polo Club had their grounds on Castletown Estate 1901–1906. Among those who played polo in Celbridge was Prince Heinrich, younger brother to Kaiser William II.

There is salmon and sea trout angling locally, with trout found from Islandbridge upstream, with other trout fishing grounds above Leixlip and all the way to Ballymore Eustace.

===Community groups===
There are three separate Scouting Ireland Groups in operation in Celbridge. The Groups are 1st Kildare (2nd Celbridge), 3rd Kildare (1st Celbridge), and 19th Kildare. The Celbridge Amenity Group is also active locally.

==Politics==
Celbridge is located within the Kildare North constituency, which elects 4 TDs to the Dáil.

Despite its size (third largest in the county – and larger than other towns which had their own councils such as Leixlip and Athy), and numerous proposals, the town was not granted a town council. This meant that Kildare County Council had full control over zoning land in the area, leading to some local discontent. The point is now moot, as town councils have been abolished in Ireland.

==History==
===Origins===
There is evidence of 5,000 years of habitation, as evidenced by beads and quern stones in the National Museum from Griffinrath (), and the nearby high ground sloping down to the Liffey. Research has linked Celbridge with the Slí Mór possibly crossing the Liffey at a ford located below the site of the mill directly east of the bridge rather than at Castletown House, as previously thought. 

The etymology of Donaghcumper Church (church of the confluence, &quot;Domhnach&quot; is one of the earliest Irish words for church) (.) suggests it may have existed as a monastic site from the 5th century. 

Folklore and heroic literature associate the north bank of Celbridge with both Saint Patrick (hill and church of uncertain antiquity in Ardrass) (.) and Saint Mochua (c570), who was associated with a church in Tea Lane (.), and a well on the site of the current mill where pagan converts were baptised.

===Parish of Kildrought===
The original Kildrought parish church (built 14th century, burned 1798) stood in the present graveyard at Tea Lane and houses the mausoleums of the Dongan and Conolly families. It was granted by the Normans to the Abbey of St Thomas in Dublin. Donaghcumper Church (c1150) had windows of cut stone inserted into the building in the 14th century. Its ruins are extant in the main graveyard in Celbridge, and members of the Alan family are buried in the church vault.

The old parish of Donaghcumper consisted of the modern townlands of Parsonstown, Rinnawad, Ballyoulster, Commons, Coneyboro, Coolfitch, Donaghcumper, Elm Hall, Loughlinstown, Newtown, Reeves, Simmonstown, Straleek and St. Wolstans. Pre Norman churches served the adjoining parishes in Donaghcumper (.) and Stacumny (.) (mentioned 1176, burned 1297, held in 1308 by a parson, Waleys) to the east, Adherrig or Aderrig further to the east (Athdearg or Red Ford, church first mentioned 1220) (.), Kilmacreddock (.) to the north east, the tiny parish of Donaghmore (plundered 1150, mentioned in letter 1190) further to the north (.), Laraghbryan (plundered 1036 and 1171) (.) to the north west, and Killadoon (.) to the south.

The modern Catholic parish of Celbridge and Straffan comprises the medieval parishes of Kildrought and Straffan, as well as the former parishes of Stacumny, Donaghcumper, Killadoon, Castledillon and Kilmacredock. The parish of Stacumny (Teach Cumni) originally included the townlands of Ballymadeer, Balscott and Stacumny. Killadoon from Cill an Dún may get its name from the earthen mound that still stands by the gate leading into the grounds surrounding Killadoon House. On the left-hand side of the avenue, as you enter through the gate, there is an overgrown churchyard with some headstones. Killadoon parish embraced the present townlands of Ardrass, Ballymakeally, Crippaun, Killadoon, Killenlea and Posseckstown. Kilmacredock is the smallest of the medieval parishes. A roofless ruin is all that remains of the original church. It is named for Redoc, who had a son who established a religious foundation southwest of the present town of Leixlip. Bellingham family members were buried in a vault in the floor of the building, but their remains were removed in the mid-20th century.

===Town of Kildrought===
The town of Kildrought or Kildroighid developed around the castle, monastery and mill of Kildrought which Thomas de Hereford, the Norman Lord of Kildrought erected early in the 13th century. The one long street running between the de Hereford Castle and lands of Castletown, and the mill, had taken shape by 1314 when Henry le Waleys was charged at a Naas court of &quot;breaking the doors&quot; of houses in the town of Kildrought and by night &quot;taking geese, hens, beer and other victuals&quot; against the will of the people of the town. 
By the time of the Down Survey (1654–1656) the population was 102 and the Dongan family were in possession of all the land in Celbridge. Killadoon House was the home of John Dongan&#x27;s brother in law Richard Talbot Earl of Tyrconnell. Dongan died at the Battle of the Boyne and is buried in Tea Lane cemetery. Talbot died immediately before the Siege of Limerick. His widow remained in Killadoon, outliving the two men who took over the town from her husband and John Dongan, Bartholmew Van Homrigh and William Conolly.

===Kildrought to Celbridge===
The present day houses in Celbridge Main Street and town centre were built over a period of two hundred years. Celbridge Abbey was built in 1703 by a Dutch Williamite emigre, Bartholmew Van Homrigh. He was appointed Chief Commissioner for Stores in Ireland for the victorious allied forces of William III and Mary II who defeated the Jacobite alliance, and enforced the Treaty of Limerick in 1691. He moved to Kildrought Manor in 1695. When William &quot;Speaker&quot; Conolly purchased the rundown Castletown Estate in 1709 from Thomas Dongan, the restored Earl of Limerick and later Governor of New York, he complained that &quot;all the Earl&#x27;s tenants were beggars&quot;. Conolly built his new mansion at Castletown, cleared the existing tenantry and began to develop the town. Improvers and speculative developers followed Conolly to Celbridge. The new leases were granted on condition that the builders erect substantial stone houses with gable ends and two chimneys, replacing mud cabins and waste ground. 
Existing mercantile buildings such as the 17th-century Market House, where the town&#x27;s first school was based in 1709, were incorporated into the expanding mill complex of buildings near the bridge. Developers began to survey e green field sites to the north east of the bridge in the direction of Castletown House. The result was to move the axis of Celbridge away from the bridge, corn and tuck mill and road to St Mochua&#x27;s church to a new Main Street. 
The old Irish name Cill Droichid (Kildrought), meaning the church of the bridge, was anglicised first to Cellbridge and then, after 1724, to Celbridge. Swift in his letters to Vanessa always named the place &quot;Kildrought&quot;, but she replied from &quot;Celbridge&quot;.

Celbridge&#x27;s 18th-century bridge had to be rebuilt after it was destroyed in a flood in December 1802.

==Historic buildings and places==

===Celbridge Main Street===
The development of the Main Street commenced with the building of Kildrought House by Joseph Rotheny in 1720 for Robert Baillie, a Dublin upholsterer who was William Conolly&#x27;s greatest prospect as an improving tenant. A large extension, which included a malt house, was added after Baillie sold in 1749. Kildrought house became home to John Begnall&#x27;s Academy after 1782. Among the attendees were the sons of Col George Napier, George, Charles, William and Henry, later to be collectively known as &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Colonels, &quot; and their younger brother Richard Napier, and John Jebb (1775–1833), later Church of Ireland bishop of Limerick, Ardfert, and Aghadoe. Jeremiah Haughton, owner of the Mill lived there after 1818. For a time in the early 19th century, Kildrought House had a cholera hospital attached to it and served as the local police barracks from 1831 to 1841 when the barrack moved to the site of the current Michaelangelo&#x27;s restaurant. After 1861 it was leased by Richard Maunsell of Oakley Park. Next door is the courthouse where the local petty sessions took place every fourth week. It later became home of Lloyd Christian, athletics pioneer and colleague of Michael Cusack in the hurling revival of the 1880s.
 
No. 22 Main Street, the original home of Conolly&#x27;s second agent George Finey was occupied by Richard Guinness for a time and his sons Arthur, founder of the Guinness brewery, and Samuel. Richard married Elizabeth Clare, proprietor of the White Hart Inn, a public house at the site of the current Londis supermarket. Finey&#x27;s successor as Conolly&#x27;s agent, Dublin cabinetmaker Charles Davis, built Jessamine Lodge, an impressive fivebay house with a weather vane on the junction of Main Street and the Maynooth Road (1750). It was home to seven generations of Mulligans until 1992. One of the Mulligans had the decorative iron arch to the entrance gate constructed from material salvaged from the GPO Dublin after the 1916 Rising. The Castletown Inn stands where Isaac Annesley, the early 18th-century master stonemason, lived. One of the oldest houses in the town. No 59 next door, was renovated in the latter half of the 18th century for Thomas Conolly&#x27;s huntsman. Christopher Barry&#x27;s Auctioneers was built in 1840 by Richard Nelson and let to Chief Constable Marley, it replaced an old dwellinghouse with stables and offices where William Wadsworth, the original Irish Straw Manufacturer and exporter lived and operated at the end of the 19th century. On the corner of the Main Street and Liffey Bridge, Broe&#x27;s house and shop (1773) is now the Bank of Ireland. Matthew Gogarty came from Clondalkin in 1818 and established his shop on the other side of the street. James Carberry&#x27;s Brewery (1709) later became Coyles and eventually Norris&#x27;s and the Village Inn. Roseville was built in 1796.
Other notable buildings on Main Street include the Catholic Church (1857 JJ McCarthy Architect), the Holy Faith convent (1877) and Christ Church (Church of Ireland, 1884) which retains the tower of an earlier church (1813). Castletown gates at the end of the street were built in 1783 after a design inspired by Batty Langley. According to research by local historian Lena Boylan, the work was by a stonemason named Coates and a blacksmith named Behan.

The oldest mill in the area is Temple Mills, operated by the Tyrrell family for 300 years, 2 km outside the town on the Ardclough Road(.). Joseph Shaw&#x27;s flax and flour mills was a major employer in the town until its closure after the death of William Shaw.

====Templeplace: a vanished settlement====
The now disappeared &quot;town&quot; of Templeplace is recording as having a population of 279 in 1841, 310 in 1851, 382 in 1861, 402 in 1871 and was, after 1881, included in the townland of Newtown &quot;on which it stood&quot; as it &quot;did not contain 20 inhabited houses.&quot; A footnote to the census returns comments &quot;the decline in population is attributed to the discontinuance of the flax mill&quot;. The population of Newtown in 1891 was 128, down from 145.

===Celbridge Mill===
The Manor Mills (built by Louisa Conolly in 1785–1788, extended by Laurence Atkinson 1805, restored 1985) incorporate parts of the old Celbridge Market House. It was purchased by Jeremiah and Thomas Houghton after Atkinson&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1815. When the Houghton partnership became bankrupt in 1818 Jeremiah took charge of the operation. Houghton told a parliamentary committee that this mill was the biggest wool manufactory in Ireland. the mill was described as employing several hundred people when King George IV visited Celbridge in August 1821 and the description &quot;biggest wool manufactory in Ireland&quot; was repeated in the 1845 Parliamentary Gazeteer. It employed 600 people at full capacity, some of them children who were eight and nine years of age. Workers from Yorkshire who came to work in the mill lived in Tea Lane (so called because of the amount of discarded tea leaves on the street) and English Row. The closure of the mills in 1879 caused the population of Celbridge to plunge from a 19th-century peak of 1,674 in 1861 (1,391 in 1871) to 988 in 1881 and a low of 811 in 1891 
Under the Irish Government regeneration scheme of the 1930s, the Leinster Hand Weaving Company acquired the premises for conversion into a weaving mill. Celbridge woollen mill was operated by Youghal carpets (acquired 1966, workforce extended from 120 jobs in October 1969.). It was a major employer until its closure in May 1982 with the loss of 220 jobs. This ended two centuries of intermittent wool production in the village. The mill now serves as a community centre. Its warehouses which bear a wallmount dating the Mill to 1785, and a stone commemorating the site of St Mochua&#x27;s well. 
Mills at Coneyburrow (Newbridge, near St. Wolstan&#x27;s) (.) were granted to Robert Randall, Dublin paper maker, in 1729, and were later converted for use as a flourmill.

===Brewery===
After Richard Guinness married Elizabeth Read (1698–1742), of a brewing family from Bishopscourt and an aunt of Arthur Guinness, he took over the town brewery in 1722 and moved it from the site of the Village Inn to where the entrance forecourt of the Holy Faith convent is today There he placed his land steward Richard Guinness in charge of production of &quot;a brew of a very palatable nature&quot;. In 1752, Dr Price&#x27;s estate bequeathed £100 to Richard&#x27;s son, the 27-year-old Arthur Guinness to help him expand the brewery, first in 1755 on a new site in Leixlip and from 1759 in St James&#x27;s Gate in Dublin. Some of the blocked up doors from the original PriceGuinness brewery can still be seen on the perimeter walls of the Catholic Church forecourt.

===Workhouse===
Celbridge workhouse was constructed between 1839 and 1841 and is the smallest of three workhouses in County Kildare. It was built at a cost of £6,800 and was designed to house 519 people from Celbridge, Lucan, Rathcoole, Leixlip, Maynooth and Kilcock, an area containing 25,424 people. 
A site on the Maynooth road has a memorial to between 1,500 and 2,500 inmates who died and were buried there during the Great Famine of 1845/47, subsequently restored by the community. According to Tony Doohan&#x27;s &quot;History of Celbridge&quot; during the worst of this disaster, a human being died every hour. Another historian Seamus Cummins suggests that the effects of the famine in the Celbridge Poor Law District area were less traumatic than elsewhere (such as south Kildare) because of the availability of wage economy employment in the district. 
After the 1860s the workhouse was used as a fever hospital, regarded as progressive for its time, as a home for the elderly and infirm, and for unmarried mothers. Orphans and illegitimate children were fostered out into the village community from the workhouse and also from the Holy Faith convents in Dublin. 
In 1922 the workhouse was used as a base by the Free State army, was visited by General Michael Collins and there are claims that the barracks was the first in which the uniform of the new Free State army was worn. After 1923 the workhouse was closed and the barracks vacated. By 1933 the Union Paint factory had been established on the site and in 1934 there were plans for a rope factory by Henry&#x27;s from Cork Street in Dublin. In 1939 the current Garda barracks was built on part of the workhouse site.

The workhouse is now a paint shop.

===Former Methodist Hall===

The cut stone former Methodist Hall on Ardclough Road fell into disrepair during the 1980s but was acquired and renovated by Cunninghams Funeral Directors in the mid-1990s.

===Other industry===
John Wynn Baker (c. 1730 – 1775), agricultural improver and writer, established the first factory in Ireland in 1765 with the financial assistance of the Dublin Society on a property at Elm Hall on the Loughlinstown Road near the newly constructed Grand Canal at Hazlehatch for manufacturing agricultural implements. 

One of Celbridge&#x27;s most original industries was the Callender Paper Company established in Celbridge in 1903 to make paper from peat. Despite the report in the Irish Times of 25 June 1904 that facilities of the company were &quot;totally inadequate to cope with demand&quot; and that &quot;Celbridge peat paper is finding its way into almost every village and hamlet in Ireland&quot; the enterprise had already run into financial trouble by November 1904. 
In 1977 French electrical group Telemecanigue invested £6m in establishing a factory on the Maynooth Road, employing 500 people at peak. Schneider MGTE group closed the factory in September 2003.

==Development==
 
Six main residential and commercial areas were developed in Celbridge over a period of 250 years: Main Street (1720–1750), Tea (or Tay) Lane (1760), Maynooth Road (1790, when construction of Jasmine Lodge replaced six cabins on Main Street and eight cabins on Maynooth Road), English Row (1805–1811), Ballyoulster (1948–1951), and St Patrick&#x27;s Park (two phases 1954–1957 and 1964–1967). The historical population of the town in the 19th and 20th century period closely mirrored periods of activity and cyclical closure of the town&#x27;s woollen mills, once the largest in the country.

===Housing estates===
Celbridge was rezoned for rapid growth under the 1967 Kildare Development Plan. That year a consortium of Brian and Tony Rhattigan and the McMullan brothers, who owned the Maxol petroleum group, purchased most of the former Castletown Estate for development purposes. Planning permission was granted on appeal for a suburban housing estate along the edge of the avenue leading into Castletown House. In response Desmond Guinness personally bought the house in 1967 to save the immediate hinterland from development and established the Irish Georgian Society in the building. 
Permission was granted for the first development of 400 houses within the gates of Castletown in 1969 and the first phase of Castletown Estate was opened by Minister for Industry and Commerce Justin Keating on 1 October 1975. This was followed by more than 30 housing developments over the next thirty years. The 1986 census listed Celbridge (+54.9pc) as the fastest growing town in Ireland. 
The population, which had been 1,514 in 1966, rose to 1,744 in 1971, 3,230 in 1979, 4,583 in 1981, 7,135 in 1986, 9,629 in 1991, 12,289 in 1996, 14,251 in 2002 and 17,262 in 2006.

A 2008 planning application by Devondale Ltd for a new €750m mixed-use development at Donaghcumper Demesne for offices, shops, restaurants, sixscreen cinema and 108 detached houses on the site, which is being promoted as &quot;a natural extension&quot; to Celbridge, has been criticised by local planners for being &quot;on a city scale rather than a more acceptable town scale.&quot; The plans ultimately failed to materialise.

==Houses outside the town==

===Castletown House===

Castletown House is situated at the end of an avenue extending from the main street. It is Ireland&#x27;s original and largest Palladian country house. Building commenced in 1722 by William &quot;Speaker&quot; Conolly (1662–1729), Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, who came under the influence of the Neo-Palladians, whose adherents included Alessandro Galilei, believed to have designed the main house, and Edward Lovett Pearce, thought to have designed the entrance hall and the long gallery in its original form, as well as the colonnades and wings. Pearce did commissions for William Conolly before his speculated involvement with Castletown. 
The house was inherited by Tom Conolly (1738–1803) in 1758 and the interior decoration was finished by his wife Louisa Lennox (greatgranddaughter of Charles II of England and Louise de Keroualle) during the 1760s and 1770s.
Two of the best known features of Castletown are the Long Gallery (an long room decorated in the Pompeian manner in blue and gold), and the main staircase (which is cantilevered and made of white Portland stone). 

Conolly&#x27;s Folly (also known as &quot;The Obelisk&quot;) is an obelisk structure. It is built to the rear of Castletown House which contains two follies, both commissioned by the widow of Speaker William Conolly to provide employment for the poor of Celbridge at a time when famine was rife. As such these monuments serve no real purpose, instead they were dedicated to battles in the 16th century. The Obelisk was built in 1739 after a particularly severe winter. Designed by Richard Castle, it is 42 metres high and is composed of several arches, adorned by stone pineapples and eagles. 
The main avenue from the town is no longer accessible by vehicular traffic, which must enter the grounds from the roundabout off the M4.

===Celbridge Abbey===
Celbridge Abbey was the childhood (1688–1707) and later adult (1714–1723) home of Bartholomew Van Homrigh&#x27;s daughter Esther (1688–1723), the ill-starred lover of Dean Swift. The poem in which Swift fictionalised her as &quot;Vanessa&quot; &quot;Cadenus and Vanessa&quot; (1713) was written seven years before he visited her in Celbridge in 1720. A rock bower associated with the lovers is a 19th-century recreation. The current Celbridge Abbey was constructed by Thomas Marlay, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, grandfather of the Irish parliamentarian Henry Grattan. His daughter Mary was married to James Grattan, Henry Grattan&#x27;s father and a member of the Irish House of Commons. A later occupant was Gerald Dease, a Catholic nobleman who entertained the Empress of Austria during her visit to Ireland. He is buried in a prominent position on front of the local Catholic church, the construction of which he helped to fund. The rock bridge in Celbridge Abbey grounds is now the oldest stone bridge across the Liffey since the removal of John Le Decer&#x27;s 1308 bridge three miles downriver at Salmon Leap.

===Oakley Park (St Raphael&#x27;s)===
Oakley Park, the current St. Raphael&#x27;s hospital was built in 1724 to a design by Thomas Burgh for Arthur Price, when he was created Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath. The house was built close to the small stone house of his father vicar of Kildrought and Straffan Samuel Price. Dr Price had previously been Bishop of Clonfert, Ferns &amp; Leighlin, and later became Archbishop of Cashel. After his departure for Cashel, Oakley Park became home to Col George Napier, Richard Maunsell, High Sheriff of Kildare and his descendants, and, in 1926 Justin McCarthy. In 1946 it was sold by Philip Guiney the Irish Christian Brothers for use as an industrial school but sold instead to the St John of God Brothers and opened as St Raphael&#x27;s Hospital, a home for intellectually disabled boys in 1953. The grand parents of Henry Grattan are buried in a private graveyard on the site.

===Collegiate School (formerly Setanta Hotel, now Celbridge Manor Hotel)===
The former Collegiate School on the Clane Road was built 1732 by architect Thomas Burgh who also built the Royal Barracks and famous library building at Trinity College both in Dublin. The Collegiate School was founded as a charity school by Louisa Conolly of Castletown (1743–1821). At the time of Lady Louisa&#x27;s death it had 600 pupils, and served as a boarding school for Protestant girls until 1973. when the Incorporated Society for Promoting Protestant Schools in Ireland closed the school and transferred the pupils to Kilkenny. The building reopened as the Setanta Hotel on 25 January 1980.
Setanta Hotel closed down in 2008 but has since been refurbished and has reopened as the four-star Celbridge Manor Hotel.

===St Wolstan&#x27;s===
St Wolstan&#x27;s, near the site of the ancient Abbey of St Wolstan&#x27;s described by Mervyn Archdall in his &quot;Monasticon Hibernicum&quot; in 1786 was originally a monastery in the Order of St Victor. It was founded c1202 by one of Strongbow&#x27;s companions for Adam de Hereford. It was named for St Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester, then newly canonised by Pope Innocent III. Before the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries it had extensive lands in Kildare and Dublin with buildings covering an estimated 20 acres. It was the first Irish Monastery to be dissolved when Sir Gerald Aylmer of nearby Lyons (died 1559) petitioned Henry VIII. It then became the home to the ill-fated Lord Chancellor and Archbishop of Dublin John Alen (1476–1534). St Wolstan&#x27;s after the Archbishop&#x27;s cousin, also John Alen, who was master of the rolls, travelled with Aylmer to England in 1536 to receive the bill for suppression of the Irish monasteries. The act of St Wolstan&#x27;s, introduced in September 1536 as a special commission of dissolution, assured Aylmer and his fellow chief justice and brother-in-law Thomas Luttrell an annual rent of £4 during the life of Sir Richard Weston, the last prior, while Alen was granted the monastery estates. The house remained with the Alen family for two subsequent centuries. St Wolstan&#x27;s was then home to later Bishops of Clogher (Robert Clayton) and Limerick, a summer resident of the Viceroy in the 1770s, a boys&#x27; school (sold 1809), home to the Cane family for another century and eventually a girls&#x27; secondary school (1957–1999) run by the Holy Faith sisters. When a new school building was built on the Clane Road in 2001, opening on 8 October, the name &quot;St. Wolstan&#x27;s&quot; was reused for this.

===Other houses===
Other large houses outside the town include Killadoon a three-storey block with a single storey wing built c. 1770 (redecorated 1820) for Nathaniel Clements MP, banker and amateur architect. Significantly, it does not appear to have been designed by Clements himself. Clements is also reputed to have designed Colganstown house, built by the Yeats family c 1760 was the property of Dublin Corporation through the first half of the 19th century. It is associated with the Andrews, Sherlock, Colgan and Meade families. Pickering Forest is a three-storey Georgian house associated with the Brooke (Barons Somerton) and later Ogilby families. Donaghcumper is a Tudor revival house built by William Kirkpatrick c1835, was sold after the death of Ivone Kirkpatrick to J Bruce Bredin, Springfield was associated with the Jones and Warren families and then the Mitchell family until 1906. Elm Hall was associated with the O&#x27;Connor family, Stacumny with the Lambert family, and Ballygoran with the Murray family, while The Grove was home of Dr. Charles O&#x27;Connor, resident surgeon for the workhouse and first chairman of Kildare GAA Board. Temple Mills was associated with the Tyrrell, Shaw and Von Mumm families and John Ellis. The parsonage, known as Robert Scott&#x27;s house (rebuilt 1780, locally known as the &quot;Shelbourne&quot;) fell into ruin and became the site of St Patrick&#x27;s Park housing estate.

<text>The Seetal railway line () is a (standard-gauge) railway of the Swiss Federal Railways between Lenzburg and Lucerne in Switzerland. The line was opened in 1883 by the &quot;Lake Valley of Switzerland Railway Company&quot;, which was owned by British investors, and subsequently owned by the Schweizerische Seethalbahn-Gesellschaft (SthB). 

As built, the line had many of the characteristics of a roadside tramway, following the parallel road almost throughout and running within the villages, separating houses from the road. Despite rebuilding to improve its safety record, much of this nature has survived to the current day.

== History ==

=== Inception ===

In the communities of the Seetal valley, it was hoped initially that the main line from Basel to Lucerne would be routed through the valley, but the Swiss Central Railway opted for a route via Zofingen, Sursee and Sempach. At around the same time, the engineer Theodor Lutz developed a concept for the construction of local railways. According to his ideas, these railways should share the use of existing roads, which would anyway lose the most traffic at the newly opened railway. In addition, this allowed the introduction of the local train directly into the town centers.

Lutz managed to raise finance from investors in London to put his ideas into practice on a line through the Seetal. On 22 August 1882 the Lake Valley Railway Company of Switzerland was established in London.
On September 3, 1883, the first section was opened. The passengers included tourists from Lucerne doing sightseeing tours to the Hallwilersee and Baldeggersee lakes. Expansions of the main line followed, as well as a short branch line between Beinwil and Beromünster.

=== Changes of ownership ===

The profitable expectations of the British investors were not fulfilled, and so they sold the line in 1894 to the newly founded Schweizerische Seethalbahn Aktiengesellschaft (SthB). They made various improvements, including the introduction of restaurant carriages. They were also pioneers of the electrification of Switzerland&#x27;s railways, starting electric service in 1910 with 5.5 kV 25 Hz AC. Despite their efforts, the line remained unprofitable.

In 1922 the line was acquired by the Swiss Confederation and incorporated into the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). In 1930, the SBB modified the electrification to its standard of . In 1997 the branch line between Beinwil and Beromünster was closed down. It now forms part of a cycle path.

=== Rebuild ===
By the end of the 20th century, the Seetalbahn had by far the worst safety record of all SBB lines. Between 1987 and 1992 the line accounted for around half of all the SBB&#x27;s level crossing accidents and there were nine fatalities on the line. Improvement of safety was therefore a major target for the line.

Although the line&#x27;s infrastructure had many of the attributes of a roadside tramway or light railway, it was operated using standard heavy rail rolling stock, with its greater width and longer stopping distances. Various options were investigated, including a major realignment of the line to more conventional heavy rail standards, but this had the twin disadvantages of a very high cost coupled with losing the attractiveness of bringing public transport to the hearts of the villages along the line.

Conversion to light rail was also discussed, and a vehicle from the Saarbrücken tramway was tried out on the line in 1998. In the end, the decision was made to build new heavy rail railcars for the line, but to build these with low floors and using a limited width. The reduction in width allowed the infrastructure on the northern section of the line, between Lenzburg and Hitzkirch, to be reconfigured providing more space between parallel road lanes and at level crossings. 

Enhanced brakes on the new railcars allowed tramway-like &#x27;on sight&#x27; operation through the villages with a maximum speed of , whilst speed on other parts of the line was increased to . Other parts of the line were realigned to avoid conflict and as many level crossings as possible were removed.

== Operation ==

As a consequence of the reduction of the loading gauge width from to , only specially cleared vehicles can use the northern section of the line between Lenzburg and Hitzkirch. The southern section, from Lucerne to Hitzkirch, still has a normal profile, allowing freight and other traffic to operate.

Passenger services are operated by the SBB RABe 520, a wide, four section variant of the Stadler GTW train. This variant was specially created for the Seetal line, although it is cleared to operate anywhere on the SBB network. The passenger service on the line operates every half-hour, and is designated as service S9 of the Lucerne S-Bahn.

<text>Eustace Clarence Mullins Jr. (March 9, 1923 – February 2, 2010) was an American white supremacist, antisemitic conspiracy theorist, propagandist, Holocaust denier, and writer. A disciple of the poet Ezra Pound, his best-known work is &quot;The Secrets of The Federal Reserve&quot;, in which he alleged that several high-profile bankers had conspired to write the Federal Reserve Act for their own nefarious purposes, and then induced Congress to enact it into law. The Southern Poverty Law Center described him as &quot;a one-man organization of hate&quot;.

==Life==

Eustace Clarence Mullins, Jr. was born in Roanoke, Virginia, the third child of Eustace Clarence Mullins (1899–1961) and his wife Jane Katherine Muse (1897–1971). His father was a salesman in a retail clothing store. He said he was educated at Ohio State University, New York University, and the University of North Dakota, although the FBI was unable to verify his attendance at any of them, with the exception of one summer session at NYU in 1947.

In December 1942 he enlisted in the military as a Warrant Officer at Charlottesville, Virginia. He was a veteran of the United States Army Air Forces, serving thirty-eight months during World War II.

In 1949 Mullins worked at the Institute for Contemporary Arts in Washington, D.C. where he met Ezra Pound&#x27;s wife Dorothy, who introduced him to her husband. Pound was at the time incarcerated in St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital for the Mentally Ill. Mullins visited the poet frequently, and for a time acted as his secretary. Later, he wrote a biography, &quot;This Difficult Individual Ezra Pound&quot; (1961), which literary critic Ira Nadel describes as &quot;prejudiced and often melodramatic&quot;. According to Mullins it was Pound who set him on the course of research that led to his writing &quot;The Secrets of The Federal Reserve&quot;.

Mullins became a researcher at the Library of Congress in 1950 and helped Senator Joseph McCarthy in making claims about Communist Party funding sources. He later stated that he believed McCarthy had &quot;started to turn the tide against world communism&quot;. Shortly after his first book, &quot;The Secrets of The Federal Reserve&quot;, came out in 1952, he was discharged by the Library of Congress.

From April 1953 until April 1954, Mullins was employed by the American Petroleum Industries Committee (APIC). He was cited in 1954 as a &quot;neo-Fascist&quot; by the House Un-American Activities Committee, which noted in particular his article &quot;Adolph Hitler: An Appreciation&quot;, written in 1952, in which he compared Hitler to Jesus and described both as victims of Jews. In 1956 he sued the APIC for breach of contract, charging that the group had hired him as a &quot;sub rosa&quot; propagandist to undermine Zionism, but failed to live up to a verbal agreement to pay him $25,000 for his covert services. The APIC responded that Mullins had been hired “as one of several economist-writers in a subordinate capacity&quot;, and denied that he had been employed “in any capacity at any time for the purpose he [alleged].″ The lawsuit, like many others filed by Mullins over the years, was eventually dismissed.

In the 1950s, Mullins began his career as an author writing for Conde McGinley’s antisemitic newspaper &quot;Common Sense&quot;, which promoted the second edition of his book on the Federal Reserve, entitled &quot;The Federal Reserve Conspiracy&quot; (1954). Around this time, he also wrote for Lyrl Clark Van Hyning&#x27;s Chicago-based newsletter, &quot;Women&#x27;s Voice&quot;. He was a member of the National Renaissance Party and wrote for its journal, &quot;The National Renaissance&quot;. In the 1990s and 2000s, he wrote for &quot;Criminal Politics&quot;. Mullins was on the editorial staff of the American Free Press and became a contributing editor to the &quot;Barnes Review&quot;, both published by Willis Carto&#x27;s Liberty Lobby.

Mullins lived in Staunton, Virginia, in the house at 126 Madison Place where he grew up, from the mid 1970s through the end of his life.

==Writings==
===&quot;The Secrets of the Federal Reserve&quot;===
In the late 1940s, when the poet Ezra Pound was incarcerated in St. Elizabeths Hospital on treason charges against the US, he corresponded with Mullins. In their correspondence, Mullins exclaimed &quot;THE JEWS ARE BETRAYING US&quot;, in a letter written on Aryan League of America stationery. The two became friends and Mullins often visited the poet while he was detained. In his &quot;Foreword&quot; to &quot;The Secrets of the Federal Reserve&quot;, Mullins explains the circumstances by which he came to write his investigation into the origins of the Federal Reserve System: &quot;In 1949, while I was visiting Ezra Pound… [he] asked me if I had ever heard of the Federal Reserve System. I replied that I had not, as of the age of 25. He then showed me a ten dollar bill marked &quot;Federal Reserve Note&quot; and asked me if I would do some research at the Library of Congress on the Federal Reserve System which had issued this bill.&quot;

Mullins told Pound that he had little interest in such a research project because he was working on a novel. &quot;My initial research&quot; wrote Mullins, &quot;revealed evidence of an international banking group which had secretly planned the writing of the Federal Reserve Act and Congress’ enactment of the plan into law. These findings confirmed what Pound had long suspected. He said, &#x27;You must work on it as a detective story.&#x27;&quot;

Mullins completed the manuscript during the course of 1950 when he began to seek a publisher. Eighteen publishers turned the book down without comment before the President of the Devin-Adair Publishing Company, Devin Garrity, told him, &quot;I like your book but we can&#x27;t print it ... Neither can anybody else in New York. You may as well forget about getting [it] published.&quot;

In 1952, the book was finally published by two of Pound&#x27;s other disciples, John Kasper and David Horton, under the title &quot;Mullins on the Federal Reserve&quot;. In it, Mullins postulated a conspiracy among Paul Warburg, Edward Mandell House, Woodrow Wilson, J.P. Morgan, Benjamin Strong, Otto Kahn, the Rockefeller family, the Rothschild family, and other European and American bankers that led to the founding of the U.S. Federal Reserve System. He argued that the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 defies Article 1, Section 8, Paragraph 5 of the United States Constitution by creating a &quot;central bank of issue&quot; for the United States. Mullins went on to claim that World War I, the Agricultural Depression of 1920, and the Great Depression of 1929 were brought about by international banking interests to profit from conflict and economic instability. Mullins also cited Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s staunch opposition to the establishment of a central bank in the United States.

In an updated edition published in 1983 and retitled &quot;Secrets of the Federal Reserve&quot;, Mullins argued that Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. and the House of Morgan were fronts for the Rothschilds. He asserted that financial interests connected to the J. Henry Schroder Company and the Dulles brothers financed Adolf Hitler (in contrast to Pound&#x27;s declaration that Hitler was a sovereign who disdained international finance.
). He called the Rothschilds &quot;world monopolists&quot;, and claimed that City of London bankers owned the Federal Reserve, since they owned much of the stock of its member banks. He attempted to trace stock ownership, as it changed hands via mergers and acquisitions, from the inception of the Federal Reserve in 1913 to the early 1980s.

In the last chapter of the book, he noted various Congressional investigations, and criticized the immense degree of power possessed by these few banks who owned majority shares in the Federal Reserve. He also criticized the Bilderberg Group, attacking it as an international consortium produced by the Rockefeller-Rothschild alliance. In an appendix to the book, he delved further into the City of London, and criticized the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, which he claimed helps to conduct psychological warfare on the citizens of Britain and the United States.

Mullins dedicated &quot;Secrets of the Federal Reserve&quot; to George Stimpson and Ezra Pound. It became his best known book, and remains broadly influential in American far-right movements. A copy was reportedly found in Osama bin Laden&#x27;s library at his compound in Abbottabad, along with &quot;Bloodlines of the Illuminati&quot; by Fritz Springmeier, another right-wing conspiracy theorist.

===Hitler and the Holocaust===
Mullins&#x27; October 1952 article entitled &quot;Adolf Hitler: An Appreciation&quot; was mentioned in a report by the House Un-American Activities Committee. In it, he espoused antisemitic views and expressed the belief that America owed a debt to Hitler. The article first appeared in &quot;The National Renaissance&quot;, journal of the National Renaissance Party.

In a tract from 1984 called &quot;The Secret Holocaust&quot;, Mullins stated that the accepted account of the Holocaust is implausible, calling it a cover story for Jewish-led Soviet massacres of Christians and anti-communists. In particular, Mullins argues that by the mid-1960s, in order to divert the world&#x27;s attention away from this putative mass slaughter, &quot;the Jews&quot; had cooked up the story of the Holocaust, using &quot;photographs of the bodies of their German victims, which are exhibited today in gruesome &#x27;museums&#x27; in Germany as exhibits of dead Jews&quot; as evidence for their claims.

===&quot;The Biological Jew&quot;===
In 1968, Mullins authored the tract &quot;The Biological Jew&quot;, which he claimed was an objective analysis of the forces behind the &quot;decline&quot; of Western culture. He claimed that the main influence that people were overlooking in their analysis of world affairs was &quot;parasitism&quot;.

===&quot;The World Order&quot;===
Michael Barkun describes Mullins&#x27; 1992 work &quot;The World Order: Our Secret Rulers&quot; as &quot;a more openly anti-Semitic version of the Illuminati theory&quot;. He writes:
==Political activities==
Mullins was involved with a number of extremist right-wing and neofascist groups from the early 1950s through the 1990s. These included the National Association for the Advancement of White People and James H. Madole&#x27;s organization, the National Renaissance Party (NRP). In the early 1950s Mullins regularly spoke in public at NRP demonstrations. His then-roommate was Matt Koehl, later the leader of the American Nazi Party but at that time head of the NRP&#x27;s &quot;Security Echelon Guard.&quot;

In the late 1950s Mullins also collaborated with &quot;scientific racist&quot; Robert Kuttner, an associate editor of Charles Lee Smith&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Truth Seeker&quot;, in theorizing Kuttner&#x27;s ideas on white supremacy. They cofounded the Institute for Biopolitics in 1958 in order to popularize Kuttner&#x27;s theories and their precursors in the work of Morley Roberts.

By the mid-1990s Mullins was &quot;considered a national leader&quot; in the constitutional militia movement. He spoke regularly to militia groups across the United States during this time. &quot;The Secrets of the Federal Reserve&quot; provided, in part, the theoretical underpinning of the movement&#x27;s conspiracy theories about a secretive cabal of wealthy families controlling the international monetary system.

==Death==
While on a speaking tour in Columbus, Ohio, in January 2010, Mullins suffered a stroke. He died on February 2, 2010, aged 86, in Hockley, Texas.

<doc id="1008445" wikidata="Q10475894" url="?curid=1008445" title="Donkey Konga">
<text>is a series of rhythm video games developed by Namco and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. A spin-off of the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; series, they are played with a special controller called the DK Bongos that resemble two small bongo drums, but can optionally be played with the standard GameCube controllers.

&quot;Donkey Konga&quot; was developed by the team that were responsible for developing the &quot;Taiko no Tatsujin&quot; series. The tracks include songs such as &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;Shining Star&quot;, &quot;Rock Lobster&quot;, &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;, and Hungarian Dance#5 in G Minor. There are tracks from the &quot;Mario&quot; series, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, and other Nintendo related music. The Japanese, North American, and PAL region versions have different track lists, and in the North American version of the first two games, almost all of the licensed non-Nintendo/traditional songs are shortened covers. The first two games have around 30 tracks each, depending on the region, while &quot;Donkey Konga 3&quot; has 58.

==Plot==

Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong are sitting on a beach one day when they come across some mysterious objects that resemble barrels. Fearing they had something to do with King K. Rool, they take them to Cranky Kong. Cranky explains that they are bongos, so Donkey tries playing them, as does Diddy. Then, when Donkey claps, the bongos start glowing. Cranky explains that the bongos have some kind of power inside them. Donkey and Diddy continue to play the bongos, but they both play terribly. Cranky advises them to practice. At first they are against this, but then they realize if they can become successful in playing the bongos, they could afford as many bananas as they wish, so they start practicing.

==Sequels==
===&quot;Donkey Konga 2&quot;===
 marketed in Japan as &quot;Donkey Konga 2: Hit Song Parade!&quot;, is the 2004 sequel to &quot;Donkey Konga&quot; for the Nintendo GameCube, a video game where the player must pound on a special, barrel-like controller called the DK Bongos along with a selected song.

The main selling point of &quot;Donkey Konga 2&quot; is over 30 new tracks to play with Bongos. Other features include slightly improved graphics, the inclusion of some classic &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; characters and a variety of new minigames.

This is the only &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game to be rated T for Teen in North America, as it contained lyrics not suitable for younger players. Other regions featured lyrics more appropriate for younger players and thus received lighter ratings.

===&quot;Donkey Konga 3&quot;===
 is a music video game in the &quot;Donkey Kong series&quot; developed by Namco and published by Nintendo. Before the second installment was released in North America, Nintendo and Namco had already started plans for the third game in the series, which, unlike the first two &quot;Donkey Konga&quot; games, was eventually released only in Japan on March 17, 2005.

&quot;Donkey Konga 3&quot; features a total of 57 tracks (none repeated from the previous games), over 20 tracks more than the first two games. 35 of these tunes are the usual classical, pop, and game selections, but an extra 21 tunes from Famicom games are included. It also features all new minigames.

==Reception==
===&quot;Donkey Konga&quot;===

&quot;Donkey Konga&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

&quot;Maxim&quot; gave the game a score of eight out of ten and said that four bongos should be added &quot;to create a frenzied, unholy din suitable for ritual virgin sacrifice&quot;. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; gave it four stars out of five and wrote: &quot;The beginner&#x27;s level is a breeze, but &quot;Konga&quot; later becomes deliciously challenging, with hilarity-inducing flustered panic as you start to fall behind and surprising levels of concentration required to clap instead of drum. Hysteria soon prevails&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, however, gave it a mixed review and said: &quot;Before you buy &quot;Konga&quot;, try clapping along with every song on the radio for half an hour and see how you feel at the end&quot;.

&quot;Donkey Konga&quot; won an award at the Game Developers Conference for the best &quot;Innovation&quot; in 2005. During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Donkey Konga&quot; for &quot;Console Family Game of the Year&quot;, as well as received nominations for &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Console Gaming&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Gameplay Engineering&quot;.

===&quot;Donkey Konga 2&quot;===

&quot;Donkey Konga 2&quot; received &quot;average&quot; reviews according to Metacritic.

<doc id="1008450" wikidata="Q7182495" url="?curid=1008450" title="Phil Tucker">
<text>Phil Tucker (May 22, 1927 – November 30, 1985) was an American film director, producer, writer, and editor. While Tucker directed his first six feature films in the span of two years (while still in his mid-20s), he is best known for his first film, the science fiction B movie &quot;Robot Monster&quot;, often considered an example of &quot;so bad it&#x27;s good&quot; film-making in the Ed Wood vein, and for the Lenny Bruce movie &quot;Dance Hall Racket&quot; featuring Bruce&#x27;s wife Honey Harlow.

In 1952, he was reportedly offered $300,000 to make a sympathetic biopic about Lucky Luciano.

In December 1953, he attempted suicide in response to the poor reception of &quot;Robot Monster&quot; and his subsequent inability to find work. According to &quot;Keep Watching The Skies!&quot; by Bill Warren, his attempted suicide was actually fueled by depression and a dispute with the film&#x27;s distributor, who had allegedly refused to pay Tucker his contracted percentage of the film&#x27;s profits.

There are further claims that after 1955, Tucker was blacklisted within the film industry, though he did go on to direct a number of other productions, including 1960&#x27;s &quot;The Cape Canaveral Monsters&quot;.

By the 1970s, Tucker had established himself as a formidable film editor, finally escaping the stigma of his early directorial work. He contributed to such well-known films as &quot;Orca&quot; and the 1976 remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;, and remained in post-production throughout the rest of his career.

In addition to his love of film, Tucker had an avid interest in all things mechanical. He invented a rotary engine known as the &quot; CT Surge Turbine&quot; (CT stood for Carnot/Tucker) for which he was granted a US patent. Tucker built and operated a prototype of the engine which he tried, unsuccessfully, to sell to the automobile industry as a more efficient alternative to the conventional internal combustion engine.

In 2010, Zed Fest Film Festival named a top award after Phil Tucker. The Phil Tucker Spirit Award is given out to encourage and support independent filmmakers that work in the horror, suspense, science fiction, drama, action, adventure, and art house genres. The event is held annually every November in North Hollywood Arts District.

<text>Skunkworks is the third solo studio album by English heavy metal vocalist Bruce Dickinson, released in 1996. It is the first and only studio album recorded with the musicians Dickinson put together for the tour supporting the album &quot;Balls to Picasso&quot; (1994). They disbanded by the end of 1996.

==Overview==
Bruce Dickinson had intended &quot;Skunkworks&quot; to be the debut album of a band by the same name. However, his label would not issue the record under any name other than Bruce Dickinson. The album moved from Iron Maiden&#x27;s traditional heavy metal style to a sound similar to that of bands such as Rush and Soundgarden. The album name refers to the Lockheed code name for an elite military design group. It was produced by Jack Endino, best known for Nirvana&#x27;s debut album &quot;Bleach&quot;.

&quot;I had this argument with (my manager) Rod,&quot; Dickinson recalled, &quot;and he told me, &#x27;You&#x27;re a heavy metal singer. You can&#x27;t change. You can try, but you&#x27;re stuck with it.&#x27; I object to that… I don&#x27;t mind being a heavy metal singer, but I object to anyone telling me I can&#x27;t fucking change… Anyway, off we went into the Skunkworks thing… At the end of it all, I was gutted. I should have had a grunge career right then, because I was very angry, very disaffected and I was poor.&quot;

The band began touring in the UK and the US in August 1996 in support of the album. Despite his musical evolution, the tour for the album was the first on which Dickinson included a song from his former band: a slightly reworked version of &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. Live performances were recorded and filmed in Pamplona and Gerona, Spain on 31 May and 1 June 1996 and four songs were released in an EP titled &quot;Skunkworks Live&quot; in Japan only in October 1996, through Victor Entertainment. A live video of the shows was released in Japan as &quot;Skunkworks Live Video&quot;.

The band did not last and, for his next solo project, &quot;Accident of Birth&quot;, Dickinson reunited with guitarist Roy Z (from &quot;Balls to Picasso&quot;).

A 2005 rerelease of &quot;Skunkworks&quot; included previously unreleased songs, and the &quot;Skunkworks Live&quot; EP.

==Cover art==
Hipgnosis designer Storm Thorgerson produced the cover art, starting with a hired tree with foliage shaped somewhat like a brain – a play on the town of Braintree, Essex. The tree was trucked to a lake in Scotland, and a photograph was taken with Dickinson standing under the tree. Hipgnosis freelance artist Richard Manning digitally shaped the foliage in Photoshop, and a mirror image was applied. Alterations were made to each side to break the mirrored perfection. Inside the album, bandmember faces were also represented in mirror image, showing one side of their face copied to the other side.

<text>Royal Air Force Wattisham or more simply RAF Wattisham was, between 1939 and 1993, the name of a Royal Air Force station located in East Anglia just outside the village of Wattisham, south of Stowmarket in Suffolk, England. During the Cold War it was a major front-line air force base, operating Quick Reaction Alert (South), before closing as an Royal Air Force station in 1993. Since 1993 it has been operated by the British Army as Wattisham Flying Station.

==History==

===Royal Air Force use===
RAF Wattisham opened on 5 April 1939 as a medium bomber station, the squadrons there being equipped with Bristol Blenheim bombers. Part of No. 2 Group, No. 107 Squadron and No. 110 Squadron were stationed there on the outbreak of war as No. 83 Wing. On 4 September 1939, just 29 hours after the declaration of war, bombers from Wattisham took off on the first attack of the war, against enemy shipping in Wilhelmshaven harbour.

In September 1942, the base was handed over to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF).

===United States Army Air Forces use===
Wattisham was assigned USAAF designation Station 377 and Station 470, and work began on building concrete runways with the intention of adapting the airfield for heavy bomber use. However, plans were apparently changed when it was evident that there would be sufficient heavy bomber airfields available for the USAAF, and it was decided that Wattisham would remain an air depot and also house a fighter unit.

Work ceased on the runways leaving only the E-W with a concrete surface and short stretches of the other two. The main SW-NE runway was finished off with steel matting while the remaining NW-SE runway continued to be grass-surfaced for most of its length.

====68th Observation Group====
Between October and December 1942 the 68th Observation Group operated the Bell P-39D Airacobra from Wattisham.

====4th Strategic Air Depot====
The 4th Strategic Air Depot (originally the 3rd Advanced Air Depot and then 3rd Technical Air Depot) serviced many types of aircraft but, by late 1943, was concentrating on fighter types. An additional technical area with four T2 hangars, some eighteen hardstands and a taxiway loop joining the airfield perimeter track, were constructed on the south side of the airfield. An engineering complex in temporary buildings was built around this area, chiefly in the village of Nedging Tye.

The 4th Strategic Air Depot installation was officially named Hitcham, which was actually the name of a village two miles to the north-west of the site, to differentiate it from the fighter station using the same airstrip. The base was, by 1944, responsible for the maintenance of all American fighters in the UK.

====479th Fighter Group====
Along with the depot maintenance mission, Wattisham also hosted an Eighth Air Force fighter group, the 479th Fighter Group, arriving from Santa Maria Army Air Field, California, on 15 May 1944. The group was part of the 65th Fighter Wing of the VIII Fighter Command. Aircraft of the group had no cowling colour markings as did other Eighth Air Force fighter groups and were marked only with coloured tail rudders. The initial inventory of the Lockheed P-38 Lightnings, many of which were hand-me-downs from other groups painted in olive drab camouflage, used geometric symbols on the tail to identify squadrons, white for camouflaged aircraft and black for unpainted (natural metal finish) Lightnings.

The group consisted of the following squadrons:
* 434th Fighter Squadron (L2).
* 435th Fighter Squadron (J2).
* 436th Fighter Squadron (9B).

The 479th FG escorted heavy bombers during operations against targets on the continent, strafed targets of opportunity, and flew fighter-bomber, area and counter-air patrol missions. Engaged primarily in escort activities and fighter sweeps until the Normandy invasion in June 1944.
The group patrolled the beachhead during the invasion, strafed and dive-bombed troops, bridges, locomotives, railway cars, barges, vehicles, airfields, gun emplacements, flak towers, ammunition dumps, power stations and radar sites while on escort or fighter-bomber missions as the Allies drove across France during the summer and autumn of 1944. The unit flew area patrols to support the breakthrough at Saint-Lô in July and the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September.

The 479th Fighter Group received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for the destruction of numerous aircraft on airfields in France on 18 August and 5 September and during aerial battle near Münster on 26 September. The unit continued escort and fighter-bomber activities from October to mid-December 1944. It converted to the P-51 Mustang between 10 September and 1 October, using both types on missions until conversion was completed.

The group participated in the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944-January 1945) by escorting bombers to and from targets in the battle area and by strafing transportation targets while on escort duty. From February to April 1945 it continued to fly escort missions, but also provided area patrols to support the airborne attack across the Rhine in March.

The unit returned to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, in November 1945, and was inactivated in December 1945. Among the notable pilots of the 479th were its second group commander, Col. Hubert Zemke, and an ace, Major Robin Olds.

Legacy
The United States Air Force (USAF) 479th Tactical Fighter Wing at George AFB, California, (1952–1971) was bestowed the lineage, honours and history of the World War II USAAF 479th Fighter Group. The 479th TFW deployed personnel and aircraft to Key West NAS, Florida, in response to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and deployed squadrons frequently to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. Later, the 479th Tactical Training Wing at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, (1977–1991) provided pilot training.

The 479th Fighter Group at Moody AFB, Georgia, (2000–2007) and since 2009 at NAS Pensacola, Florida, currently as the 479th Flying Training Group.

===Back to Royal Air Force control===
====1946–1975====
In 1946, the base was returned to the Royal Air Force. No. 266 Squadron, with the Gloster Meteor F.3, was stationed there from 4 November to 5 December 1946 and from 4 January to 16 April 1947.

The Air Ministry Servicing Development Unit formed here on 1 January 1947 with a number of aircraft including the Avro York I, Hawker Tempest V, Gloster Meteor F.4 &amp; T.7, Avro Anson T.20 and the de Havilland Vampire F.3. The squadron disbanded on 1 June 1950 at RAF Wittering. In the mid 1950s, the Black Arrows display team 111 squadron operated out of Wattisham, flying Hawker Hunters.
In 1949, new runways were laid, and the following year No. 152 Squadron arrived with Meteor NF.12 night fighters, In 1954, Hawker Hunters, from No. 257 and 263 Squadrons, the UK&#x27;s next generation fighter after the Meteor, arrived to secure Wattisham&#x27;s future as a major fighter station.
The Station Commander, Group Captain Edwards, had artificial legs, like Douglas Bader before him. The Wing Commander was one of the four Sowerey brothers, all of whom held senior RAF posts. The Officer Commanding No. 257 Squadron was Major Howard E Tanner, a USAF exchange pilot.

There was also a Station Flight which received and serviced visiting aircraft and also had its own aircraft for various purposes. These included a de Havilland Vampire, a de Havilland Dragon Rapide and a Hunter used by the Station Flight commander.

The Black Arrows aerobatic display team, flying the Hunter, moved to Wattisham from RAF North Weald with air displays becoming a regular feature from 1959.

In the late 1950s the Cold War had begun to intensify and so the RAF began to modernise Britain&#x27;s air defence. Thus, in 1960, the station was equipped with the very latest in British fighter aircraft: the English Electric Lightning. The capabilities of this aeroplane and Wattisham&#x27;s location near the East Anglian coast proved invaluable in countering the threats faced from the east. The airfield quickly became a preeminent front-line airbase, possibly the most important in the UK. Throughout the Cold War RAF Wattisham operated &#x27;QRA&#x27; or Quick Reaction Alert Sheds where live armed jets were on standby at all times. The station also functioned as the site of a major &#x27;Blacktop&#x27; diversion runway.

====1976–1992====
On 25 February 1976, 13 McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR.2s of No. 23(Fighter) Squadron arrived to replace the Lightnings. No. 56(F) Squadron followed on 9 July, arriving with their Phantoms from RAF Coningsby. From Wattisham, the Phantoms continued the role of playing a major part in defending Britain&#x27;s airspace which largely involved intercepting the Soviet Tupolev Tu-95 Bear aircraft, as part of Quick Reaction Alert (South). Between 4 November and early December 1976, No. 23(F) Squadron deployed to RAF Luqa, Malta, for an Armament Practice Camp (APC). No. 56(F) Squadron deployed for an APC at RAF Luqa between 13 October and November 1977.
On 1 June 1979, Wattisham-based Phantom FGR.2 &quot;XV424&quot; from No. 56(F) Squadron was used to re-enact the transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown, crewed by pilot Squadron Leader A. J. N. &quot;Tony&quot; Alcock and navigator Flight Lieutenant W. N. &quot;Norman&quot; Browne.

Following the Falklands War, it was decided to base Phantoms on the Falklands Islands. In March 1983, No. 23(F) Squadron relocated from RAF Wattisham to Port Stanley Airport, leaving &quot;the Firebirds&quot; as the sole based squadron. On 19 October 1984, No. 74(F) Squadron stood-up at RAF Wattisham equipped with the unique McDonnell Douglas F-4J(UK) Phantom. Delivered in three batches, the squadron was brought up to full strength of 15 jets on 5 January 1985.

In 1990, the Options for Change defence review laid out the plan to withdraw the Phantoms from RAF service. In January 1991, the Phantom F-4J(UK) was withdrawn from use, with &quot;the Tigers&quot; converting over to the Phantom FGR.2. The disbandment of No. 228 OCU on 31 January 1991 at RAF Leuchars, saw the reformation of the Phantom Training Flight as part of No. 74(F) Squadron, operating until 31 December 1991.

No. 56(F) Squadron disbanded on 31 July 1992, reforming as the Panavia Tornado F.3 OCU at RAF Coningsby. No. 74(F) Squadron continued to operate at RAF Wattisham until disbanding on 1 October 1992.

==Closure==
RAF Wattisham&#x27;s future hung in the balance as a major air force base and it was decided that with the Cold War threat gone it was no longer needed by the RAF. Wattisham stood down as a fighter base on 31 October 1992. The station was transferred to the control of the British Army in September 1993. The Army Air Corps soon moved in and it rapidly became a major Army airfield, operating it as Wattisham Flying Station. The Royal Air Force returned to operate Westland Sea King Search and Rescue helicopters on the site of the former QRA hangars.

<text>Dieter Herbert Nuhr (born 29 October 1960) is a German kabarett artist, comedian, author and television presenter.

Nuhr&#x27;s stage program &quot;nuhr in Berlin&quot; (the title is a pun; for explanation, see below) is the first German stand-up comedy which was created exclusively for Netflix.

Nuhr is one of the most successful cabaret artists in Germany, with more than 200.000 viewers per year. Nuhr is regarded as a mediator between &quot;classical&quot; comedy and &quot;intelligent&quot; Stand-up comedy. In his work, he gives a critical glance to social behaviour in society and media, often satirising relationships and families. Nuhr has also been known to caricature the typical German know-it-all. 

A saying of Nuhr is frequently quoted in forums and newsgroups due to its provocative nature (and use of the semi-offensive word &quot;Fresse&quot;): &quot;&quot;Wenn man keine Ahnung hat: Einfach mal Fresse halten&quot;, which roughly translates to, &quot;If you haven&#x27;t got a clue: Shut your puss for once.&quot;&quot; 

== Early life and education ==
Nuhr was born in Wesel but his family moved to Düsseldorf when he was four years old. Growing up he attended the secondary school Leibniz-Gymnasium.

In 1981 he started to study art and history at the University of Duisburg-Essen and received his teaching degree in 1988. From 1981 to 1989, Nuhr studied art and history at the Folkwang Hochschule in Essen.

== Career ==
His first appearance on stage was with a school theater group where he also started to write his first own texts. In 1986, he and Frank Küster founded the cabaret-duo V.E.V.-K.Barett. Their first official appearance on stage was part of their program called &quot;Haben Sie sich ihre Schranknummer gemerkt?&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;Have you memorized your locker-number?&quot;. In 1987, he appeared for the first time as a cabaretist. In 1989, the duo developed their second stage program &quot;Pralle Pracht&quot; (lit. bulging opulence) and after a name change in 1990 to V.E.V.Kabarett the duo performed their third stage program &quot;Schrille Stille&quot; (lit. sharp silence). The last project of the group called &quot;Zipfeltreffen&quot;, which is a play on words in German (Gipfeltreffen = summit conference whereas Zipfeltreffen = summit of dicks), followed. In 1994, Nuhr started his first solo-project called &quot;Nuhr am Nörgeln&quot;. (This program title contains, like most of Nuhr&#x27;s titles, two different meanings. It could be literally translated as &quot;just grumbling&quot; or as &quot;Mr. Nuhr is grumbling&quot; because the German word &quot;nur&quot;, meaning &quot;just&quot;, is homophonic to Nuhr&#x27;s last name.) From 1982 to 1992, he was an active artist, and several of his works were exhibited in the Rhineland. He has since gained notoriety for his numerous television appearances on &quot;Die Harald Schmidt Show&quot;, &quot;Genial daneben&quot;, &quot;Schillerstraße&quot;, &quot;Quatsch Comedy Club&quot; (Channel Pro7) and &quot;7 Tage, 7 Köpfe&quot; (lit. &quot;7 days, 7 heads&quot;) on the channel RTL.

In an interview with the newspaper Westdeutsche Zeitung in 2006, Nuhr was asked how he had developed his unique style: &quot;I started my solo career because the manager of a theater in Mönchengladbach had talked me into it. He allowed me to perform on his stage and directed me. While I was practicing my program more and more requisites went missing because he took more and more of them away. So when the day of my first performance came close there were no requisites left anymore. I just stood there and talked to the audience. This is how my very own style was born. At first I thought that this could not work at all, but the fewer requisites I used, the better it finally worked out for me. So I thought that this is what I should do: not use any requisites but talk to the audience in my own way.&quot; (28 January 2006).

In 1998, the stage program &quot;Nuhr weiter so&quot; (lit. &quot;Simply go on&quot;) received an award: the Deutsche Kleinkunstpreis in the category cabaret and in 2003, he received the (German comedy award) for best live performance, making him the only person who received both of these well-known German awards.

His performance &quot;Ich bin&#x27;s Nuhr&quot; was visited by approximately half a million people. After presenting a humorous review of the year&#x27;s events in 2004, he has been broadcast on ZDF with a similar TV show at the end of every following year. Nuhr presented the German comedy award for the first time on 24 October 2008 and did so over the course of the following five years. Since 3 October 2009 his four-part comedy series has been shown live on ZDF on four Tuesday evenings. 

In 2009, Nuhr was asked whether he would like to participate in the album &quot;A Tribute to Die Fantastischen Vier&quot; for the 20th anniversary of the group Die Fantastischen Vier. It is a compilation album with varied artists covering songs of the hip hop group from Stuttgart. Nuhr recorded the song &quot;Buenos Dias Messias&quot; in his office room. In this song he played all the instruments himself and recorded it with his equipment, which he uses for radio shows otherwise. In addition to that, the album includes a conversation between Nuhr and the initiator of the album project Andreas &quot;Bär&quot; Läsker.
From 20 January 2011 until 2014, he presented the TV show &quot;Satire Gipfel&quot; on ARD. He replaced Mathias Richling, whose contract ended in 2010. In October 2014, this TV format was replaced by &quot;Nuhr im Ersten&quot; which was presented by him as well. Nuhr produced a two-part TV special concerning the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In doing so he referred to the topic soccer in an ironical way. Furthermore, he produced weekly cabaret segments for the radio station WDR 2. Together with Ralph Casper he presented the quiz show &quot;Null gewinnt&quot; in the early evening time slot of ARD from July to March 2013. In the year 2012, Dieter Nuhr was mentor for the &quot;ARD-Themenwoche&quot; (a special TV format, covering a weekly particular topic) with an emphasis on the topic: living with death. To this TV format he contributed the television show &quot;Nuhr am Leben&quot; which was recorded in the St. Elisabeth church in Berlin Mitte and broadcast on ARD on 19 November 2012. In 2013, he took part in the &quot;ARD-Themenwoche&quot; again, when the topic &quot;fortunately/I&#x27;m glad that...&quot; was concerned. His broadcast &quot;Nuhr im Glück&quot; was recorded in the orangery of the tropical Botanical Garden, Potsdam and was aired on 22 November 2013.

The ARD-Themenwoche 2014 will be about tolerance and Nuhr will perform his stage program &quot;Nuhr mit Respekt&quot; (Only with respect) and will be broadcast from the Jewish museum Berlin. Nuhr can also be seen regularly on the TV show &quot;Mario Barth deckt auf!&quot; in which he and the German comedian Mario Barth show examples of projects which only wasted tax money.
In 2014, Nuhr received the Jacob-Grimm-Award. The Jury praised Nuhrs way of performing and his intelligent form of cabaret. His stage programs were eloquent and his punch lines hit. Though the main aspect of his work was not the extraordinary quality of his speeches but also his ability to perform critique with and through language and the way Nuhr invites the audience to think about how language is able to influence our thoughts and emotions.

Nuhr&#x27;s stage program &quot;nuhr in Berlin&quot; (the title is a pun on &quot;nur&quot; which is German for &quot;only&quot;) is the first German stand-up comedy which was created exclusively for Netflix. On 15 November 2016, it became available on Netflix in several countries (optionally with subtitles), including the United States and the United Kingdom.

Nuhr was one of the first signers of the Open Letter to the German Position on Russo-Ukraining War on late April 2022, who demanded not to support Ukraine with arms in order to &quot;prevent a third world war&quot;.

== Islamic cabaret controversy ==

Dieter Nuhr is one of the few German cabaret artists who deals with the topic of radical sides of Islam in his programmes and books. In October 2014, a suspected Salafist pressed charges against Nuhr because he was allegedly insulting creeds and religious communities. Erhat Toka (board member of the former Muslimisch Demokratischen Union – MDU, now Bündnis für Innovation und Gerechtigkeit (BIG)) initiated the process and denoted Nuhr to be a hatemonger who agitates against Islam and invoked people to boycott Nuhr&#x27;s event in Osnabrück. The Islamic scholar Bülent Ucar of the University of Osnabrück argued that Nuhr uses generalizations, feeds prejudice and brings himself up to tendentious interpretations of the Koran. The emeritus professor of theology Reinhold Mokrosch who is also speaker of the Round Table of the Religions could understand the criticism of Nuhr since he felt that it encouraged Islamophobia. Aiman Mazyek, chairman of the non-representative Central Council of Muslims in Germany was also upset about Nuhr&#x27;s utterances but advised to keep calm. Mazyek declared: &quot;If Mr. Nuhr thinks he can interpret the Koran in a fundamentalist way for the sake of satire then he has to take responsibility for this. However, it is not worth suing him and thus giving him free advertising.&quot;

Lawyer Klaus Staeck, recent president of the Academy of Arts, Berlin, said at the time he did not expect the complaint against Nuhr would be successful, and believed Nuhr only exercised his freedom of opinion, which is taken seriously by German courts. Nuhr objected to the accusation that he would be stirring up hatred against Islam. He told &quot;Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung&quot; he would continue discussing the dangers of radical Islam. He is not interested in insulting Muslims, but still wants to deal critically with Islam, he told the &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;. The cabaret artist warned of not publicly criticizing Islam just because of fearing the possible reactions and to not leave the protest only to the right-wingers. Nuhr, on his part, criticized the report of the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung, which related the term &quot;hate preacher-image&quot; to Nuhr in their online issue. The Tagesspiegel cited Nuhr&#x27;s entry from his Facebook site: &quot;Been accused as &quot;hate preacher&quot; by Islamists because I quoted the Quran correctly. Please come visit me in jail! Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung only asks for the opinion of the Islamists and shows understanding. The question is: Does a country, that has that kind of newspapers, even need Islamists?&quot; 

Richard Herzinger commented that there were some concerns and that the complaint would especially harm the image of Muslims. On 5 November 2014, the Prosecution Office of Osnabrück announced that the proceedings against Nuhr would be closed. The prosecution justified this with the lack of &quot;xenophobic sentiment&quot; in the works of Dieter Nuhr as well as the circumstance, that it obviously is satire.

== Political statements ==
In 2020, Nuhr signed the &quot;Appeal for Free Debate Spaces&quot; („Appell für freie Debattenräume“) together with right-wing conservatives Peter Hahne, Vera Lengsfeld and others. The declaration was directed against a supposed &quot;cancel culture&quot; in German society.

<doc id="1008471" wikidata="Q195133" url="?curid=1008471" title="Wigner–Eckart theorem">
<text>The Wigner–Eckart theorem is a theorem of representation theory and quantum mechanics. It states that matrix elements of spherical tensor operators in the basis of angular momentum eigenstates can be expressed as the product of two factors, one of which is independent of angular momentum orientation, and the other a Clebsch–Gordan coefficient. The name derives from physicists Eugene Wigner and Carl Eckart, who developed the formalism as a link between the symmetry transformation groups of space (applied to the Schrödinger equations) and the laws of conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum.

Mathematically, the Wigner–Eckart theorem is generally stated in the following way. Given a tensor operator formula_1 and two states of angular momenta formula_2 and formula_3, there exists a constant formula_4 such that for all formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7, the following equation is satisfied:

:formula_8

where
*formula_9 is the -th component of the spherical tensor operator formula_1 of rank , 
* formula_11 denotes an eigenstate of total angular momentum and its &quot;z&quot; component ,
* formula_12 is the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient for coupling with to get ,
* formula_4 denotes some value that does not depend on , , nor and is referred to as the reduced matrix element.

The Wigner–Eckart theorem states indeed that operating with a spherical tensor operator of rank on an angular momentum eigenstate is like adding a state with angular momentum &quot;k&quot; to the state. The matrix element one finds for the spherical tensor operator is proportional to a Clebsch–Gordan coefficient, which arises when considering adding two angular momenta. When stated another way, one can say that the Wigner–Eckart theorem is a theorem that tells how vector operators behave in a subspace. Within a given subspace, a component of a vector operator will behave in a way proportional to the same component of the angular momentum operator. This definition is given in the book &quot;Quantum Mechanics&quot; by Cohen–Tannoudji, Diu and Laloe.

==Background and overview==

===Motivating example: position operator matrix elements for 4d → 2p transition===

Let&#x27;s say we want to calculate transition dipole moments for an electron transition from a 4d to a 2p orbital of a hydrogen atom, i.e. the matrix elements of the form formula_14, where &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot; is either the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, or &quot;z&quot; component of the position operator, and &quot;m&quot;1, &quot;m&quot;2 are the magnetic quantum numbers that distinguish different orbitals within the 2p or 4d subshell. If we do this directly, it involves calculating 45 different integrals: there are 3 possibilities for &quot;m&quot;1 (−1, 0, 1), 5 possibilities for &quot;m&quot;2 (−2, −1, 0, 1, 2), and 3 possibilities for &quot;i&quot;, so the total is 3 × 5 × 3 = 45.

The Wigner–Eckart theorem allows one to obtain the same information after evaluating just &quot;one&quot; of those 45 integrals (&quot;any&quot; of them can be used, as long as it is nonzero). Then the other 44 integrals can be inferred from that first one—without the need to write down any wavefunctions or evaluate any integrals—with the help of Clebsch–Gordan coefficients, which can be easily looked up in a table or computed by hand or computer.

===Qualitative summary of proof===

The Wigner–Eckart theorem works because all 45 of these different calculations are related to each other by rotations. If an electron is in one of the 2p orbitals, rotating the system will generally move it into a &quot;different&quot; 2p orbital (usually it will wind up in a quantum superposition of all three basis states, &quot;m&quot; = +1, 0, −1). Similarly, if an electron is in one of the 4d orbitals, rotating the system will move it into a different 4d orbital. Finally, an analogous statement is true for the position operator: when the system is rotated, the three different components of the position operator are effectively interchanged or mixed.

If we start by knowing just one of the 45 values (say, we know that formula_15) and then we rotate the system, we can infer that &quot;K&quot; is also the matrix element between the rotated version of formula_16, the rotated version of formula_17, and the rotated version of formula_18. This gives an algebraic relation involving &quot;K&quot; and some or all of the 44 unknown matrix elements. Different rotations of the system lead to different algebraic relations, and it turns out that there is enough information to figure out all of the matrix elements in this way.

(In practice, when working through this math, we usually apply angular momentum operators to the states, rather than rotating the states. But this is fundamentally the same thing, because of the close mathematical relation between rotations and angular momentum operators.)

===In terms of representation theory===

To state these observations more precisely and to prove them, it helps to invoke the mathematics of representation theory. For example, the set of all possible 4d orbitals (i.e., the 5 states &quot;m&quot; = −2, −1, 0, 1, 2 and their quantum superpositions) form a 5-dimensional abstract vector space. Rotating the system transforms these states into each other, so this is an example of a &quot;group representation&quot;, in this case, the 5-dimensional irreducible representation (&quot;irrep&quot;) of the rotation group SU(2) or SO(3), also called the &quot;spin-2 representation&quot;. Similarly, the 2p quantum states form a 3-dimensional irrep (called &quot;spin-1&quot;), and the components of the position operator also form the 3-dimensional &quot;spin-1&quot; irrep.

Now consider the matrix elements formula_14. It turns out that these are transformed by rotations according to the tensor product of those three representations, i.e. the spin-1 representation of the 2p orbitals, the spin-1 representation of the components of r, and the spin-2 representation of the 4d orbitals. This direct product, a 45-dimensional representation of SU(2), is &quot;not&quot; an irreducible representation, instead it is the direct sum of a spin-4 representation, two spin-3 representations, three spin-2 representations, two spin-1 representations, and a spin-0 (i.e. trivial) representation. The nonzero matrix elements can only come from the spin-0 subspace. The Wigner–Eckart theorem works because the direct product decomposition contains one and only one spin-0 subspace, which implies that all the matrix elements are determined by a single scale factor.

Apart from the overall scale factor, calculating the matrix element formula_14 is equivalent to calculating the projection of the corresponding abstract vector (in 45-dimensional space) onto the spin-0 subspace. The results of this calculation are the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients. The key qualitative aspect of the Clebsch–Gordan decomposition that makes the argument work is that in the decomposition of the tensor product of two irreducible representations, each irreducible representation occurs only once. This allows Schur&#x27;s lemma to be used.

==Proof==

Starting with the definition of a spherical tensor operator, we have

:formula_21

which we use to then calculate

:formula_22

If we expand the commutator on the LHS by calculating the action of the on the bra and ket, then we get

:formula_23

We may combine these two results to get

:formula_24

This recursion relation for the matrix elements closely resembles that of the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient. In fact, both are of the form . We therefore have two sets of linear homogeneous equations:

:formula_25

one for the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients () and one for the matrix elements (). It is not possible to exactly solve for . We can only say that the ratios are equal, that is

:formula_26

or that , where the coefficient of proportionality is independent of the indices. Hence, by comparing recursion relations, we can identify the Clebsch–Gordan coefficient with the matrix element , then we may write

:formula_27

== Alternative conventions ==

There are different conventions for the reduced matrix elements. One convention, used by Racah and Wigner, includes an additional phase and normalization factor,

:formula_28
where the array denotes the 3-j symbol. (Since in practice is often an integer, the factor is sometimes omitted in literature.) With this choice of normalization, the reduced matrix element satisfies the relation:

:formula_29

where the Hermitian adjoint is defined with the convention. Although this relation is not affected by the presence or absence of the phase factor in the definition of the reduced matrix element, it is affected by the phase convention for the Hermitian adjoint.

Another convention for reduced matrix elements is that of Sakurai&#x27;s &quot;Modern Quantum Mechanics&quot;:

:formula_30

== Example ==

Consider the position expectation value . This matrix element is the expectation value of a Cartesian operator in a spherically symmetric hydrogen-atom-eigenstate basis, which is a nontrivial problem. However, the Wigner–Eckart theorem simplifies the problem. (In fact, we could obtain the solution quickly using parity, although a slightly longer route will be taken.)

We know that is one component of , which is a vector. Since vectors are rank-1 spherical tensor operators, it follows that must be some linear combination of a rank-1 spherical tensor with }. In fact, it can be shown that

:formula_31

where we define the spherical tensors as

:formula_32

and are spherical harmonics, which themselves are also spherical tensors of rank . Additionally, , and

:formula_33

Therefore,

:formula_34

The above expression gives us the matrix element for in the basis. To find the expectation value, we set , , and . The selection rule for and is for the spherical tensors. As we have , this makes the Clebsch–Gordan Coefficients zero, leading to the expectation value to be equal to zero.

<text>DC Comics Presents is a comic book series published by DC Comics from 1978 to 1986 which ran for 97 issues and four &quot;Annual&quot;s. It featured team-ups between Superman and a wide variety of other characters in the DC Universe. A recurring back-up feature &quot;Whatever Happened to...?&quot; had stories revealing the status of various minor and little-used characters.

==Publication history==
&quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; debuted with a July/August 1978 cover date and was edited by Julius Schwartz. The series was launched with a team-up of Superman and the Flash by writer Martin Pasko and artist José Luis García-López. The winner of the &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; letter column name contest appeared in the Superman/Hawkman story in issue #11 (July 1979). The &quot;Whatever Happened to...?&quot; backup feature began in issue #25 (Sept. 1980) and would appear in most issues for the next two years until its last installment in issue #48 (Aug. 1982). Issue #26 included an insert introduction story to the then-upcoming &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; series by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez. Len Wein and Jim Starlin co-created the supervillain Mongul in issue #27 (Nov. 1980) as part of a three-issue storyline. Another insert in issue #41 previewed the &quot;new direction&quot; Wonder Woman. In issue #47, Superman traveled to Eternia and met the Masters of the Universe. Ambush Bug made his first appearance in issue #52 (Dec. 1982) and made additional appearances in issues #59 and 81. The Superman/Challengers of the Unknown tale in issue #84 was drawn by Jack Kirby and Alex Toth. The series also contained the Alan Moore Superman/Swamp Thing story &quot;The Jungle Line&quot; in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #85 (Sept. 1985), pencilled by Rick Veitch and inked by Al Williamson. Issue #87 featured the first appearance and origin of Superboy-Prime. The last issue is an exception to the team-up format, instead featuring Superman in an &quot;Untold Tale&quot; involving the Phantom Zone by Steve Gerber, following up as the conclusion to Gerber&#x27;s previous limited series of the same title.

In 2004, the title &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; was revived for eight one-shot issues, each a tribute to Schwartz, who had recently died. Each issue featured two stories based on a classic DC Comics cover of the past, reflecting Schwartz&#x27;s frequent practice of commissioning a cover concept, then telling the writers to create a story about that cover.

In 2010, DC launched a new &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot;, a line of 100-page reprint issues reprinting stories that have not seen print since their original publication.

==Featured team-ups==


== Characters featured in the &quot;Whatever Happened to...?&quot; back-up series ==
Writer Mike Tiefenbacher had several proposals for other &quot;Whatever Happened to...?&quot; stories. These included Captain Action, Blackhawk, Genius Jones, Nighthawk, Ragman, the Sea Devils, Silent Knight, and Wildcat.

==Julius Schwartz tribute==
In September and October 2004, the title &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; was revived for a series of eight one-shot issues, each a tribute to DC editor Julius Schwartz, who had died the previous February. Each issue featured two stories based on a classic DC Comics cover of the past, reflecting Schwartz&#x27;s frequent practice of commissioning a cover concept, then telling the writers to create a story about that cover.

<text>Bradley is a village in North Yorkshire, England. It is situated between Skipton and Keighley, approximately from the A629 and from the nearby town of Skipton. Bradley is divided into two parts, the hamlet of High Bradley and the village of Low Bradley, known collectively as Bradleys Both although traditionally the village used to be named Bradley Ambo.

== History ==

The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes through the village. The Bradley section of the canal was completed in 1775. Upon entering the village there is a swing bridge crossing the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. A coal business was eventually established on the left of the swing bridge, complete with a wharf and weighbridge, while a coal stay and canal wharf occupied a large area to the right. Coal barges pulled by boat were a regular sight.

Bradley Mill constructed in the 1860s was renovated into 28 homes in 2005, developed by Novo Homes.

The primary school, Bradleys Both Community Primary School, was built in 1914. The name derives from the fact that the village is divided into two parts – Low Bradley and High Bradley.

On 22 April 2007, a Polish war memorial was unveiled by the canal, in memory of seven Polish airmen who died when their plane crashed near Skipton in 1943.

=== Industry ===
In the past, quarrying supplied slate and stone for building materials but most of the villagers were engaged in hand looming and wool combing in their own homes.

In the mid-1860s, industry started to develop in Bradley in the form of spinning and weaving mills.
Weaving was carried out at Rose Shed Mill, which was redeveloped into Browns Court in the late 1990s.

<doc id="1008501" wikidata="Q657900" url="?curid=1008501" title="Stevie Richards">
<text>Michael Stephen Manna (born October 9, 1971), better known by his ring name Stevie Richards, is an American retired professional wrestler and media personality. Since June 2024, Richards has hosted &quot;The Stevie Richards Show&quot;, presented by co-host James Romero on the WSI Network.

Over the course of his career, Richards has performed for major professional wrestling promotions including Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling, World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and Ring of Honor. Championships held by Richards include the ECW World Tag Team Championship, the WWE Hardcore Championship (21 times), the NWA National Heavyweight Championship and the Extreme Rising World Championship.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1992–1994)===
Michael Manna trained as a professional wrestler under Jimmy Jannetty at Mike Sharpe&#x27;s wrestling school in Brick Township, New Jersey. He wrestled his first match on February 25, 1992, for the Tri-State Wrestling Alliance as &quot;Stevie Richards&quot;, facing Jannetty. He wrestled a handful of matches for Eastern Championship Wrestling before spending two years working on the independent circuit for seasoning.

=== NWA Eastern / Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994–1997) ===

==== Raven&#x27;s Nest (1994–1996) ====

Richards returned to Eastern Championship Wrestling on June 26, 1994, as &quot;Steve Richards&quot; (later tweaked to &quot;Stevie Richards&quot;) in a preliminary wrestling role. His first televised appearance was on the June 28, 1994, episode of &quot;NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling&quot;, teaming with Hack Meyers in a loss to Dory Funk Jr. and Terry Funk. Shortly after his return, Richards was given a valet, Angel. In addition to his in-ring role, Richards answered calls to the ECW hotline under the pseudonym &quot;Lloyd Van Buren&quot;.

At Heat Wave on July 16, 1994, Richards lost to Tommy Dreamer. In late-1994, he developed an &quot;identity crisis&quot;, performing under the ring names &quot;Stevie Flamingo&quot;, &quot;Stevie the Body&quot;, and &quot;Stevie Polo&quot;—all references to former ring names used by Scott Levy in World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation. After sustaining another loss to Dreamer, Richards became irate and claimed he would present &quot;the real Johnny Polo&quot;. On the January 7, 1995, episode of &quot;ECW Hardcore TV&quot;, Levy—now known as &quot;Raven&quot;—made his ECW debut, with Richards as the first member of Raven&#x27;s Nest, Raven&#x27;s stable of . As a member of Raven&#x27;s Nest, Richards began wearing jean shorts and half shirts for glam metal bands such as Cinderella, Nelson, Poison and Winger. His behavior attracted the scorn of commentator Joey Styles, who repeatedly described him as a &quot;clueless &quot; and referred to his attending the Blue Oyster Bar, a (fictional) gay bar.

Immediately upon debuting in ECW, Raven began feuding with Dreamer. On April 8, 1995, at Three Way Dance, Raven revealed that he and Dreamer had attended summer camp together as teenagers, where Raven slept with Beulah McGillicutty, an overweight girl with acne who had been spurned by Dreamer. Richards then revealed that he had tracked down McGillicutty, who was now a &quot;Penthouse&quot; model, who also harbored a grudge against Dreamer. Later that night, Raven wrestled Dreamer for the first time, defeating him following interference from both Richards and McGillicutty. The feud between Raven and Dreamer would continue for another two years, with Dreamer constantly unable to pin Raven.

In May 1995 at Enter the Sandman, Dreamer introduced Luna Vachon to ECW to counter the continual interference from Richards and Raven&#x27;s Nest. On June 30, 1995, at Mountain Top Madness, Raven and Richards defeated The Public Enemy to win the ECW World Tag Team Championship. At Hardcore Heaven on July 1, 1995, Raven and Richards defeated Dreamer and Vachon in a tag team match. Two weeks later at Heat Wave, Vachon defeated Richards in a cage match.

In the summer of 1995, an unnamed woman began appearing in the audience during Richards&#x27; matches. On August 26, 1995, Richards introduced her to Joey Styles as his girlfriend, Francine. Francine began accompanying to Richards to ringside, but tensions quickly arose between her and McGillicutty. On August 26, 1995, McGillicutty defeated Francine after Richards turned on her by super kicking her at the behest of Raven. Francine subsequently aligned herself with The Pitbulls, helping them defeat Raven and Richards for the ECW World Tag Team Championship at Gangstas Paradise on September 16, 1995. Raven and Richards regained the titles from The Pitbulls on October 7, 1995 at South Philly Jam, only to lose them to The Public Enemy later that evening.

At November to Remember on November 18, 1995, Richards introduced a lackey of his own, The Blue Meanie. Over the following year, Richards and The Blue Meanie would perform numerous parodies of other wrestlers, including &quot;Baron von Stevie&quot; and &quot;Colonel DeMeanie&quot;; &quot;Lord Stevie&quot; and &quot;Sir Meanie&quot;; &quot;Stevie Alexander Bagwell&quot; and &quot;Meanie Riggs&quot;; and &quot;Flyboy Stevie Rock&quot; and &quot;Meanie Grunge&quot;. In late 1995, Richards received another lackey, Super Nova.

During the opening of Holiday Hell on December 29, 1995, Richards received a kiss from Missy Hyatt, who was seated at ringside, after claiming he could get her &quot;a date with Raven&quot; in return. Later that evening, Richards and The Blue Meanie were squashed by Dreamer in consecutive matches. Dreamer went on to face Raven, who defeated him yet again after repeated interference from Richard and The Blue Meanie. At House Party on January 5, 1996, Richards attempted to kiss McGillicutty, who refused, eventually announcing that she was pregnant. After Raven angrily confronted McGillicutty, she informed him that he was not the father, causing Raven to attack Richards. McGillicutty then revealed that Tommy Dreamer was the father, with Dreamer storming the ring and beating down Raven, Richards and The Blue Meanie. On February 3, 1996, at Big Apple Blizzard Blast, Richards announced that he was suing Missy Hyatt—who had aligned herself with The Sandman—for sexual harassment (a reference to Hyatt&#x27;s lawsuit against her former employer, World Championship Wrestling). On June 1, 1996, at Fight the Power he served Hyatt by stuffing a summons into her cleavage. The angle concluded at Natural Born Killaz on August 24, 1996, when Richards offered to drop the lawsuit if Hyatt would insult The Sandman. After Hyatt complied, The Sandman caned her, breaking their alliance.

In August 1996, Richards, The Blue Meanie, Super Nova and Don E. Allen parodied the rock band Kiss at The Doctor Is In as &quot;Stevie Stanley&quot;, &quot;Meanie Simmons&quot;, &quot;Nova Frehley&quot;, and &quot;Don E. Criss&quot; respectively. At the same event, Richards substituted for Raven in his ECW World Heavyweight Championship title defense against The Sandman, with Raven entering the ring at the end of the match and pinning The Sandman. Later that month, Richards took part in ECW&#x27;s first tour of Japan, defeating Keizo Matsuda in a bout in Korakuen Hall as well as helping Raven defend his title against Tommy Dreamer.

The relationship between Raven and Richards began to deteriorate in late 1996. At Ultimate Jeopardy on October 5, 1996, Raven was scheduled to team with Brian Lee against Dreamer and The Sandman in a match with Raven&#x27;s ECW World Heavyweight Championship on the line. After Raven was announced as being unable to compete, Richards substituted for him, with Raven losing his title after The Sandman pinned Richards. Upon his return, Raven blamed Richards for the loss.

At &quot;High Incident&quot; on October 26, 1996, Richards was involved in one of ECW&#x27;s most controversial angles, with Raven&#x27;s Nest &quot;crucifying&quot; The Sandman by tying him to a cross and placing a crown made of barbed wire on his head. The angle, which was widely criticised as being in poor taste, led to Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle severing his links with ECW and delayed the promotion&#x27;s debut on pay-per-view.

====Blue World Order (1996–1997)====

At November to Remember on November 16, 1996, Richards debuted the Blue World Order, a comedy stable parodying the New World Order in World Championship Wrestling. Richards began performing as &quot;Big Stevie Cool&quot;, a reference to nWo member Kevin Nash, formerly &quot;Big Daddy Cool&quot;. Later that night, Richards inadvertently superkicked Raven during his ECW World Heavyweight Championship bout against The Sandman. The tensions between Raven and Richards continued to build until, on December 28, 1996, Richards turned on Raven by superkicking him during a match with The Sandman. At House Party in January 1997, Richards once again superkicked Raven.

At &quot;Crossing the Line Again&quot; on February 1, 1997, Raven scored an upset victory over &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams after interference from Richards backfired. At CyberSlam on February 22, 1997, Richards and The Blue World Order came to the ring to berate Raven and Brian Lee, who had given a concussion to Terry Funk. After Lee chokeslammed Richards, Tommy Dreamer, and The Sandman entered the ring, eventually fighting off Raven and Lee. Dreamer then helped Richards to his feet and the two shook hands, marking an end to their lengthy rivalry.

As part of an agreement between ECW and the World Wrestling Federation, Richards and several other ECW wrestlers appeared on February 24, 1997, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, with Richards defeating Little Guido.

At Hostile City Showdown on March 15, 1997, Richards faced Raven and Dreamer in a three-way dance for Raven&#x27;s ECW World Heavyweight Championship. The match was won by Raven. At ECW&#x27;s first pay-per-view, Barely Legal on April 13, 1997, Richards faced Terry Funk and The Sandman in a triple threat match, with the winner facing Raven for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. The match was won by Funk, who went on to defeat Raven.

On May 1, 1997, episode of &quot;ECW Hardcore TV&quot;, a controversial angle took place in which a morose Raven confronted Richards, telling him he had one final &quot;mission&quot; for him. Raven then attacked Richards before begging him to &quot;end my pain&quot;. At The Buffalo Invasion on May 11, 1997, Raven and Richards reformed their tag team to face Dreamer and Funk, with Richards pinning Funk despite bickering with Raven throughout the match. In the main event, Raven, Richards, Funk, and The Sandman faced one another in a four-way elimination match for Funk&#x27;s ECW World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Raven DDT&#x27;ed both Funk and The Sandman and then demanded that Richards pin them and then lay down for him. Richards refused, instead super kicking Raven and enabling Funk and The Sandman to pin him. During the match, Richards suffered a neck injury when Funk slammed the metal guardrail onto his back and neck. Shortly thereafter, he announced his retirement from professional wrestling, making his final appearance with ECW on the May 29, 1997, episode of &quot;ECW Hardcore TV&quot;.

===World Championship Wrestling (1997)===
He made his debut on the July 13, 1997, episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, confronting Raven, who had also just signed with WCW. In August 1997, signing a contract with World Championship Wrestling. At Clash of the Champions XXXV on August 21, 1997, Raven defeated Richards in a no disqualification match. In September 1997, Richards rejoined Raven, sitting with him in the audience during WCW events. He left WCW in November 1997.

===Return to ECW (1997)===
After leaving WCW, Richards wrestled a handful of matches for ECW in December 1997, defeating Chris Chetti at Better Than Ever, before returning to the independent circuit, where he primarily competed in the northeastern United States.

===Independent circuit (1997–1999)===
In August 1998, Richards defeated Doug Gilbert to win the NWA National Heavyweight Championship. Gilbert regained the title in October 1998 at the NWA Anniversary Show. In November 1998, Richards joined Maryland Championship Wrestling, winning the MCW Tag Team Championship with Earl the Pearl in his debut match. The duo held the titles until February 1999. In April 1999, Richards won an eight-man tournament for the vacant NWA 2000 Heavyweight Championship. At the independent supercard Break the Barrier on May 15, 1999, Richards won the APWF Heavyweight Championship, which he held until August 1999.

Richards planned on retiring from professional wrestling to study information technology at the Community College of Philadelphia. His plans changed when he was offered a contract with the World Wrestling Federation in mid-1999.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1999–2008) ===

====Imitations (1999–2000)====

In 1999, Richards joined the WWF full-time. He debuted on August 15, 1999, episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, helping his old bWo partner, The Blue Meanie, win a match against Al Snow. The two formed a short-lived tag team, before Richards adopted an impersonator gimmick.

After Sable left the WWF, Richards and The Blue Meanie filmed a series of vignettes lampooning her titled &quot;The Blonde Bytch Project&quot; (a parody of &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;). One vignette aired on the August 23 edition of &quot;Raw.&quot; The rest ultimately did not as WWF chairman Vince McMahon did not feel they would be understood.

Mocking other wrestler&#x27;s gimmicks, he appeared as an Acolyte, a Dudley Boy and a vampire of The Brood, until briefly settling on Mick Foley&#x27;s Dude Love persona. After that, he impersonated Test, Chyna, and Chris Jericho, before being sidelined by an ankle injury. He returned to wrestle matches on &quot;Jakked&quot; and &quot;Metal&quot;, where he lost more often than not. He challenged both Dean Malenko and Scotty 2 Hotty for the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship in this period, unsuccessfully.

====Right to Censor (2000–2001)====

Richards returned on the June 26, 2000, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, with a new look and gimmick, shorthaired and in a shirt and tie, reminiscent of Michael Douglas&#x27;s character from the movie &quot;Falling Down&quot;. Over the next few weeks, he cut promos condemning the risqué content of WWF programming and preaching conservative values (the gimmick was a mocking reference to the Parents Television Council, which was publicly criticizing WWF content at the time). He became a full-fledged heel, formalized his name to &quot;Steven Richards&quot; and formed a stable known as the Right to Censor. He spoke for, managed, and tag-teamed with his recruits: The Godfather (renamed the Goodfather), Bull Buchanan, Ivory, and Val Venis. When Chyna was featured in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, the Right to Censor objected and feuded with her and her (onscreen) boyfriend, Eddie Guerrero.

====Stevie Night Heat (2001–2004)====

After Right to Censor broke up, Richards disappeared from television for a short time. He returned to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to cut a promo condemning The Undertaker for attacking Right to Censor and causing it to disband. When The Undertaker confronted Richards, KroniK attacked him. Richards announced his alliance with the WCW tag team, thus becoming a de facto member of The Alliance. He managed KroniK in a match against The Undertaker and Kane, after which KroniK was released from the WWF.

Richards then appeared mainly on the &quot;B shows&quot;, &quot;Jakked&quot; and &quot;Metal&quot;, until Team Alliance lost at Survivor Series in 2001. Richards was then fired (in storylines) along with the rest of the Alliance roster by Vince McMahon. Ric Flair was able to save his job and get him drafted to the Raw brand.

There, he became a twenty-two-time Hardcore Champion, trading it several times with Bubba Ray Dudley, Booker T, Crash Holly, Shawn Stasiak, Justin Credible, Bradshaw, Terri, and Tommy Dreamer.

Richards formed an alliance with Victoria in late 2002, as a mentally unbalanced couple helping each other win their matches. He often helped her retain the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship. This led to a feud with Bubba Ray Dudley and Trish Stratus, who would win their titles in a tag team match on RAW. As Victoria turned face, the duo quietly separated.

Around this time, he proclaimed himself &quot;General Manager of &quot;Heat&quot;&quot;, a title that carried no actual authority. In August 2004, Richards began appearing in drag as &quot;The Mystery Woman&quot; during Victoria&#x27;s matches, helping her win. The Mystery Woman&#x27;s painfully obvious identity was &quot;revealed&quot; at Unforgiven, after &quot;she&quot; saved Victoria from Tyson Tomko and Trish Stratus. Richards then quickly lost an impromptu match to Tomko. He went on a losing streak on &quot;Heat&quot; from April 19, 2004, until December 3, 2006 (when he defeated Rene Dupree).

====Blue World Order reunion (2005–2006)====
Richards was legitimately injured during the &quot;Raw&quot; debut match of Chris Masters in February 2005, when a botched Polish hammer broke his nose and orbital bone. After healing, Richards faced Masters in a rematch but lost again.

Richards appeared at the ECW reunion event, &quot;ECW One Night Stand&quot; in 2005, reuniting with his bWo comrades and proclaiming &quot;We have only three words for you. We&#x27;re taking over!&quot; He then dropped The Sandman with a Stevie Kick.

Richards was traded to SmackDown! on June 30, 2005, and reformed the bWo with Nova and The Blue Meanie. At &quot;The Great American Bash&quot;, the bWo lost to The Mexicools (Juventud Guerrera, Psicosis, and Super Crazy) in a six-man tag team match.

Richards then had a short stint on &quot;WWE Velocity&quot;, dropping the bWo gimmick as he lost to Hardcore Holly and Booker T. After September 6, he disappeared from TV for over six months. He returned for an 18-Man inter-promotional Battle Royal at WrestleMania 22.

====ECW (2006–2008)====
Shortly after the introduction of the ECW brand in 2006, Richards left the SmackDown! brand to join it on the &quot;WWE vs ECW Head to Head&quot; show on June 7, 2006. He wrestled on ECW&#x27;s weekly show under his old ring name of Stevie Richards. He soon returned to his heel persona, turning on the other ECW Originals and siding with the newer stars. His first win on ECW&#x27;s weekly show was on September 5, 2006, over Balls Mahoney, after interference from Kevin Thorn, who was feuding with Mahoney at the time.

Richards wrestled before the ECW brand&#x27;s first pay-per-view, December to Dismember, defeating Rene Dupree in a dark match. Other than this match, he did not appear on ECW between September 2006 (when he joined up with the first version of ECW&#x27;s New Breed—Test, Mike Knox, and Hardcore Holly) and February 2007 (when he lost to CM Punk for a second time).

Richards was a lumberjack in the pre-WrestleMania 23 Lumberjack Tag Team match. He then went on to lose to CM Punk three more times. In mid-2007, Richards turned face again, and teamed with Tommy Dreamer against The New Breed on house shows, replacing The Sandman (who was drafted to Raw) in the ECW Originals.

On July 24, Richards defeated Kevin Thorn by reversing a crucifix powerbomb into a backslide pin. This was his first victory on WWE television since December 2006. In a rematch the next week, he was dominated, yet again defeated Thorn, via roll-up. On August 7, he was ambushed by Thorn while giving an interview backstage. He again defeated Thorn on August 14 by a reverse decision disqualification, when Thorn continued to assault him after initially winning the match. Richards ambushed Thorn during an interview the next week. He teamed with Tommy Dreamer and lost to Thorn and Elijah Burke. A week later, he teamed with CM Punk and defeated them.

Richards was eliminated from the Elimination Chase for the ECW Championship on the September 18 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;. He then disappeared from WWE programming to have throat surgery.

Richards made his return on the February 12, 2008, episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, defeating Rory Fox with his signature Stevie-T. He beat James Curtis next, then Mike Knox (Richards&#x27; final victory on WWE TV).

In the following months, Richards wrestled in the pre-WrestleMania 24-Man Battle Royal, lost to Shelton Benjamin, The Great Khali and Mike Knox in singles matches, teamed with Kelly Kelly to lose to Mike Knox and Layla and was one of fourteen ECW wrestlers who faced Triple H and Mr. Kennedy in a 14 on 2 Handicap Match on &quot;Raw&quot;. He commentated on the Extreme Rules match between Mike Knox and Tommy Dreamer on the 100th episode of &quot;ECW&quot;.

Richards remained on the ECW brand after the June 2008 Draft, but wrestled his final three WWE matches on &quot;SmackDown&quot;. He lost to Vladimir Kozlov on July 11, 2008, and to The Brian Kendrick on July 25. He was released from his WWE contract shortly thereafter.

===Return to the independent circuit (2008–present)===

====Various promotions (2008–present)====
Before returning to the independent circuit, Richards&#x27; lung collapsed while undergoing a biopsy to determine the cause of a lung infection, causing him to wear a chest tube for several days and miss a scheduled appearance for Maryland Championship Wrestling (MCW).

Richards then occasionally wrestled for MCW and other promotions. He won the Force One Championship Wrestling Heavyweight Championship on February 28, 2009, in Barnegat, New Jersey, defeating Danny Doring, as well as the TRP and Showcase heavyweight championships.

On May 28, 2011, Richards debuted as an announcer for Lucha Libre USA. At the next taping on June 18, he turned heel by helping R. J. Brewer win the Lucha Libre USA Championship, joining his anti-Mexican stable, The Right, in the process. He made his promotional wrestling debut at the next taping on July 30, defeating Rocky Romero after interference from stablemate Petey Williams.

In 2012, Richards wrestled regularly for the Extreme Rising promotion, as well as for the NWA and Florida-based promotions CCW and ICW. On June 16, Richards retained his Showcase Championship Wrestling Heavyweight Title against Marty Jannetty. On October 6, 2012, Richards defeated Aramis to win the American Championship Pro Wrestling (ACPW) Heavyweight title in Vineland, New Jersey.

Stevie spent the majority of 2013 and 2014 either defending the Extreme Rising World Championship on the indie circuit or challenging for titles in other promotions, such as the WildKat Revolution Title, the SCW Southern Heavyweight Championship, the DWE Heavyweight Championship, the Freedom Pro Wrestling Heavyweight Championship, the CCW Southeastern Heavyweight Championship, the W.O.W Heavyweight Championship and the MPW Heavyweight Championship.

Other notable Independent appearances included a one-off return to the Steven Richards Right to Censor gimmick where he defeated Jack Hurley at the &quot;SCW Fallout&quot; in Florida, reuniting the b.W.o once again for a Pro Wrestling Syndicate iPPV in New Jersey, teaming again with Victoria for Tommy Dreamer&#x27;s House of Hardcore promotion at &quot;HOH 3&quot; and main-eventing as the titular star of Canada Wrestling Elite&#x27;s &quot;Stevie Night Heat&quot; event. Richards challenged Drew Galloway unsuccessfully for EVOLVE Championship in Nebraska on September 9, 2014. On November 16, 2014, at House of Hardcore VII, Richards defeated Danny Doring.

On September 4, 2015, Richards, Da Blue Guy, and Hollywood Nova reunited as the Blue World Order for Chikara&#x27;s 2015 King of Trios tournament. They were eliminated from the tournament in their first-round match by the Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive, Flex Rumblecrunch and Max Smashmaster).

On May 28, 2016, in Louisiana, Richards successfully defeated Curt Matthews to capture the WildKat Revolution Championship. Richards retained the title over Matthews in a rematch on July 23, 2016. He retained again over Bob Holly on September 10, 2016. Following his defense, Richards was offered the opportunity from Teddy Long to vacate the Revolution Championship and receive a WildKat Heavyweight Championship match in return. Richards accepted the offer. On November 12, 2016, at the Revolution Rumble event, Richards defeated Heavyweight Champion Bu Ku Dao by pin to capture the championship. Richards made his first successful defense the following week in New Orleans, defeating Vordell Walker.

On July 30, 2016, Richards entered a Metro Pro Wrestling tournament to a new MPW Heavyweight Champion. He was eliminated by Mike Sydal when Sydal used Richards&#x27; tights for leverage.
On August 7, 2016, in Nashville, Richards defeated Aramis to win the Freedom Pro Wrestling National Championship. Richards would return to successfully the defend the championship in 2017 against Nick Nero and Johnny Swinger.

Richards remained in title contention on the independent wrestling scene when on November 5, 2016, in Miami, he challenged for the No.1 contendership to the ICW Heavyweight Championship in a triple threat with Shawn Prime and Gangrel, where Gangrel was victorious.

Richards began what he dubbed &quot;The Summer of Stevie&quot; following a heel turn in WildKat Sports Wrestling, which would see him retain the WildKat Heavyweight Championship against Ryan Davidson, Matt Lancie, J. Spade, Mr. Anderson and Luke Hawx. His match against Hawx took place at WildKat&#x27;s Philadelphia debut at the ECW Arena, where Richards competed in Apollo Creed-esque ring gear.

====Extreme Rising (2012–2014)====
In early 2012, Stevie Richards was announced to take part in the Extreme Reunion event that would take place on April 28 at the Pennsylvania National Armory in Philadelphia, he teamed with The Blue Meanie once more as the b.W.o against old foes The F.B.I (Guido and Mamaluke). The b.W.o were eventually defeated following outside interference that led to the Blue Meanie being pinned, Richards appearing frustrated would Stevie-Kick Thomas &quot;Inchworm&quot; Rodman, with the announcers who had previously been positively remarking on his conditioning and ring-shape that &quot;Stevie was here to win, not for nostalgia&quot;.

Richards would then return for the company in June (now Extreme Rising) and begin a feud with Luke Hawx, who had been verbally attacking the ECW alumni. Hawx defeated Richards using heel tactics in New York but Richards would defeat him the following night in Philadelphia with a Stevie-Kick, earning his first win for the promotion. Richards was then entered into an eight-man tournament to crown the first Extreme Rising World Champion. On November 17 at the &quot;Remember November&quot; iPPV, Richards would defeat Papadon by submission to advance into the semi-finals. Later in the show, Richards would confront Raven who had been running down the promotion, which led to a &quot;Loser Leaves Town&quot; match which ended as No Contest due to interference from Raven&#x27;s new Flock, who Richards would decimate through a series of Steve-Kicks and Stevie-Bombs.

On December 29, 2012, Richards would win the tournament and the World Championship by first defeating Luke Hawx in the semi-finals and then Rhino in the final round to become the first Extreme Rising World Champion. He would win all matches by submission with the &quot;I&#x27;ll Tap You&quot;, following this final round win, the Extreme Rising locker room surrounded the ring to congratulate him on his first World Championship.

Following Stevie&#x27;s championship win over Rhino, he soon took the title overseas where he defended against Tarkan Aslan for the DWA promotion in Germany before returning to America and defending the belt for other independent promotions such as Coastal Championship Wrestling, I Believe In Wrestling, and Southern Championship Wrestling Florida. Title defenses then became less regular, though Stevie was due to defend the title three times at Extreme Rising&#x27;s Wrestlemania weekend shows, notably against mentor/nemesis Raven, the events were cancelled which was followed by a brief dispute with Stevie and Extreme Rising. However, title defenses eventually resumed as Stevie defeated Kenny Kendrick at a SCW show in August 2013 prior to him making his first defense in an Extreme Rising ring at the December 28, 2013, iPPV &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; where he defeated former NWA World, ECW World and WWC Universal Heavyweight Champion Steve Corino by submission. Later that night he ran-out after the co-main-event and Stevie-Kicked top contenders Matt Hardy, Luke Hawx and Homicide as well as Hardy&#x27;s wife Reby Sky which he would later justify in a video promo.

Extreme Rising and Stevie&#x27;s World Title reign hit another roadblock when Extreme Rising were forced to reschedule their February/March shows for safety reasons where Richards was due to battle Sabu. Following this, Richards would lose a non-title match at an ECWA show in Delaware to Luke Hawx following outside interference from Papadon where Hawx would &#x27;steal&#x27; the World Championship belt. Following this confusion, Stevie would continue to defend the championship without the belt while Hawx would continue to proclaim himself champion while &#x27;defending&#x27; the belt also. During this period, Stevie would retain over Chachi in New York for Warriors of Wrestling, Ricky Martinez in Pennsylvania for Central PA Wrestling, Ring of Honor and CZW star Azrieal for PWA in Connecticut and Joey Ace in New York again for Warriors of Wrestling.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2009–2011)===

====Various storylines (2009–2010)====
On the February 12, 2009, episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, Manna made his Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) debut as Abyss&#x27;s therapist, Dr. Stevie. For two months, Dr. Stevie&#x27;s face did not appear on television, as the camera was positioned behind him during his sessions with Abyss and, later, Daffney. His identity was revealed when he interfered in Abyss&#x27;s match with Matt Morgan at &quot;Lockdown&quot;, preventing Abyss from using a chair, which caused him to lose. Stevie&#x27;s heel role was solidified the next month, when his sessions with Abyss became increasingly abusive. At &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, Abyss turned on Stevie and chokeslammed him onto a pile of thumbtacks, after he threatened Lauren, Abyss&#x27; girlfriend. On the May 28 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Raven returned to TNA, attacked Abyss and aligned himself with Stevie and Daffney. Stevie lost to Abyss at the 2009 &quot;Victory Road&quot; pay-per-view.

Stevie scored his first TNA victory on July 19, defeating Cody Deaner with his new finishing move, General Anesthesia, in a match for &quot;TNA Xplosion&quot;, also streamed on TNA&#x27;s website. On the July 30 &quot;Impact!&quot;, he announced he was not done with Abyss and placed a $50,000 bounty on his head. On September 1, he defeated Jay Lethal via submission in another webmatch.

After Lethal Consequences (Jay Lethal and Consequences Creed) and Jethro Holliday failed to collect the bounty on Abyss, Kevin Nash claimed it at No Surrender after pinning him in a Legends Championship match, even though it was supposed to be paid for ending his career. Stevie tried to explain this to Nash, only to receive a Jackknife Powerbomb. On the next &quot;Impact!&quot;, Stevie took the money back after using a taser on Nash. The feud ended a week later when Nash defeated Stevie in a non-title match.

On the October 8 &quot;Impact!&quot;, Mick Foley announced that Stevie would be the special guest referee in the Monster&#x27;s Ball match between Foley and Abyss at Bound for Glory. The match ended after Abyss pushed the interfering Daffney off the top rope through a barbed-wire board (giving her a legit concussion), Black Hole Slammed the enraged Dr. Stevie onto a pile of thumbtacks and slammed Foley onto the barbed wire board. He covered Foley, pulled an unconscious Dr. Stevie over, and used his hand to count the pinfall.

Two weeks later, Stevie assaulted Abyss after losing a match to him; Foley turned on him and saved Abyss. The next week, Foley explained he had manipulated Dr. Stevie all along and had challenged Abyss to test how tough he really was. He then booked Stevie in a match with Abyss for the following week; if Abyss pinned Stevie, he would have to leave TNA. On the November 12 &quot;Impact!&quot;, Stevie defeated Abyss to save his job, after the lights suddenly went out and came back on with Abyss mysteriously laid out. After the match, Foley (who was commentating during the match) entered the ring and attacked Stevie when the lights went out again. In the darkness, a fireball was thrown in Foley&#x27;s face. When the lights came back, Raven was revealed as the one who had interfered. Stevie, Raven and Daffney then reformed their alliance and feuded with Abyss and Foley. During the feud, Stevie set Abyss on fire. Spike (TNA&#x27;s broadcaster) did not allow the footage to air, so it was streamed on the company&#x27;s website. on the December 3 edition of Impact, Stevie and Raven faced Kurt Angle in a losing effort after interference from Abyss. on the December 17 edition of Impact, Stevie teamed with Scott Steiner, Brutus Magnus, Doug Williams and Raven for a ten-man tag team match against Styles, Angle, Lashley, Tomko and Abyss but lost the match. At &quot;Final Resolution&quot;, Abyss and Foley defeated Stevie and Raven in a &quot;Foley&#x27;s Funhouse&quot; tag team match to end the feud. on the January 4, 2010, edition of Impact, Stevie and Raven faced Hernandez and Matt Morgan in a losing effort.

====EV 2.0 (2010–2011)====
After months of being off television, he (now billed as Stevie Richards) returned on the June 24 &quot;Impact!&quot;, in the audience beside Raven and Tommy Dreamer. The next week, the three were joined by Rhino. On the July 15 &quot;Impact!&quot;, Richards, Raven, Dreamer, Rhino, Brother Devon, Pat Kenney and Al Snow, led by Mick Foley, aligned themselves with TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam, by attacking Abyss and the rest of the TNA locker room, thus turning face.
The next week, TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give the ECW alumni their own reunion pay-per-view event, &quot;Hardcore Justice&quot;, a celebration of hardcore wrestling and a final farewell to ECW. At the event, Richards defeated P.J. Polaco.

On the next &quot;Impact!&quot;, the ECW alumni (known collectively as Extreme, Version 2.0 (EV 2.0)) were assaulted by A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair&#x27;s stable, who claimed EV 2.0 did not deserve to be in TNA. During the assault, Abyss came out, fought Rob Van Dam backstage and caused him storyline injuries which forced him to vacate the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, and caused EV 2.0 to seek vengeance. On the August 26 &quot;Impact!&quot;, Richards volunteered to take out Abyss, but ended up beaten when he attacked him backstage. The following week on &quot;Impact!&quot;, Richards defeated Abyss in a singles match. After the match, Abyss was about to attack Richards with a nail-studded board, but he was saved by EV 2.0&#x27;s newest member, Brian Kendrick.

In late August, Richards began writing a weekly health and fitness column for TNA&#x27;s website. on the September 2 edition of Impact, Richards defeated &quot;The Monster&quot; Abyss. on the September 24 edition of TNA Xplosion, Richards faced Desmond Wolfe in a losing effort. on the October 7 edition of Impact, Richards participated in a $100,000 Invitational Gauntlet-style Battle Royal which was won by Kurt Angle. on the October 7 edition of TNA Xplosion, EV 2.0 (Richards and Raven) defeated Fortune (Matt Morgan and Douglas Williams).

At &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, Richards, Dreamer, Raven, Rhino and Sabu defeated members Styles, Kazarian, Morgan, Roode and Storm in a Lethal Lockdown match. At &quot;Turning Point&quot;, EV 2.0 faced Fortune in a ten-man tag team match, where each member of EV 2.0 put their TNA careers on the line. EV 2.0 lost the match and Sabu was released from TNA. Richards then challenged TNA Television Champion A.J. Styles to a match on the next &quot;Impact!&quot;. He failed to bring the Television Championship to EV 2.0, and was taken from the ring in a neck brace, suffering a storyline injury. Despite this, TNA streamed a match on Xplosion, in which Richards defeated Okada.

On January 11, 2011, Manna announced he had quit TNA. On an October 2014 interview, Manna explained that he quit TNA because TNA was not paying him a living wage at the time. TNA added Manna to their Alumni section on April 17, 2014.

=== Ring of Honor (2015–2016)===
On August 29, Stevie Richards debuted for Ring of Honor during an in-ring interview with Kevin Kelly which got interrupted by Jay Lethal that led to a brawl between the two before getting broken up. On September 26, Richards fought (and lost) to Undisputed ROH World Champion Lethal in a Proving Grounds match. Though Richards lost the match, he indicated that he is not going to quit wrestling and will be back with ROH if the management at Sinclair Broadcast Group (ROH&#x27;s parent company) will have him back. Richards returned to ROH on December 19 in a losing effort to ROH World Television Champion Roderick Strong. Richards returned to ROH in January 2016, losing to Adam Cole.

Richards returned in June 2016, for a series of matches, taking part in the &quot;Road to Best in the World&quot; tour. Richards returned again in September, in a losing effort to Silas Young.

==Podcasting career==
In 2007, Richards started his own technology podcast, &quot;The T4 Show&quot; (standing for &quot;Tech Today Tech Tomorrow&quot;). Josh &quot;Colm&quot; Coleman joined the show as Manna&#x27;s co-host in 2009.

In 2008, Richards joined the Stratford, Connecticut campus of the Connecticut School of Broadcasting as an instructor.

==&quot;The Stevie Richards Show&quot;==

In June 2024, Richards launched the weekly show &quot;The Stevie Richards Show&quot; on the WSI Network. The show sees Richards respond to wresting-related question from his fans, and his producer and co-host, James Romero, as well as Richards shooting on his time and experiences throughout his time the professional wrestling business.

==Personal life==
Manna is of Italian origin.

In 2011, he pitched a perfect game in the &quot;MLB 2K11&quot; video game. A promotional contest offered a million dollars to the first person to accomplish this, but because Manna did so before the contest officially started, he did not win the money.

In early 2023, Manna suffered constant and high-level back pain following a morning workout. After treatment at the Mayo Centre in Jacksonville, Florida, it was discovered that he had an infection which had recently reached his spine and quickly progressed to osteomyelitis on his L4 and L5 vertebrae. Doctors told Manna that if this went undiagnosed it could have been fatal. Manna began to document his recovery on his social media channels. Manna believes the initial infection was a result of a dog bite he suffered at a neighbor&#x27;s house a few months prior.

<doc id="1008505" wikidata="Q931082" url="?curid=1008505" title="Catlinite">
<text>Catlinite, also called pipestone, is a type of argillite (metamorphosed mudstone), usually brownish-red in color, which occurs in a matrix of Sioux Quartzite. Because it is fine-grained and easily worked, it is prized by Native Americans, primarily those of the Plains nations, for use in making ceremonial pipes, known as chanunpas or čhaŋnúŋpas in the Lakota language. Pipestone quarries are located and preserved in Pipestone National Monument outside Pipestone, Minnesota, in Pipestone County, Minnesota, and at the Pipestone River in Ontario, Canada.

==Name==
The term &quot;Catlinite&quot; came into use after the American painter George Catlin visited the quarries in Minnesota in 1835; but it was Philander Prescott who first wrote about the rock in 1832, noting that evidence indicated that American Indians had been using the quarries since at least as far back as 1637.

==Catlinite properties and quarries==

Minnesota catlinite is buttery smooth and can be cut with a regular hacksaw or even a knife. It comes out of the ground a pinkish color often with a cream layer protecting it from the hard quartzite. It is weaker and more subject to breaking under stress than Utah pipestone. Most catlinite deposits exist beneath the level of groundwater or are in deep enough layers where the soil is constantly moist as the iron compounds which give catlinite its red color quickly convert into iron oxides when exposed to the elements and the stone degrades and breaks down.

The red catlinite from the Pipestone, Minnesota quarries is a soft claystone bed which occurs between layers of hard Sioux Quartzite. Only hand tools are used to reach the catlinite so it takes a long time to get to it. Only enrolled Native Americans are allowed to quarry for the stone at the Pipestone National Monument, and thus it is protected from over-mining. Another quarry is located near Hayward, Wisconsin on the reservation, which the Ojibwa have used for centuries. The stone there is harder than the stone from Pipestone National Monument.
Utah pipestone has a more variable range of hard and soft forms, since it occurs as layers between deposits of harder slates. Utah pipestone is a by-product of slate mining in Delta, Utah, and several natural deposits have been mined and used for pipemaking by Native Americans in the area for millennia.

The Canadian quarry is no longer used, although there are quarries in Canada where another type of pipestone, black stone, is gleaned. The Ojibwe use both the red and black stone for their sacred pipes.

Catlinite is often used to make the hollow tubes in pipeclay triangles.

==Other varieties of pipestone==
A large range of pipestones exist, not just those in Minnesota, and numerous Native American tribes use a variety of materials in addition to catlinite for pipemaking.

===Pipe clay===
Smoking pipes molded from wet clay are different from those where the bowl is carved from solid pipestone and then fitted with a wooden stem (as is the case with Catlinite pipes).

The Eastern Band Cherokee are social smokers, and use molded clay pipes for this purpose.

In the United Kingdom, since the 17th century &quot;pipe-clay&quot; has meant a pale, whitish clay. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as &quot;fine white kind of clay, which forms a ductile paste with water&quot;. It is traditionally used for all sorts of polishing and whitening purposes as well as for making tobacco pipes and pottery.

In 1989, Silvstedt placed fourth at the Swedish national alpine skiing youth championship, in the giant slalom event won by Pernilla Wiberg. However, an accident in the middle of a skiing competition where she injured her shoulder ended Silvstedt&#x27;s competitive skiing career at the age of 16.

A few years later, Silvstedt was invited to participate in the Miss Sweden beauty pageant, after her mother and sister had sent some pictures of her to the pageant officials.

==Career==

===Modeling===
Silvstedt participated in the Miss Sweden beauty pageant, and she was chosen to represent her country in the 1993 Miss World pageant in Sun City, South Africa, eventually making the Top 10. Silvstedt was signed up by a modeling agency in Paris, and she started working for various prestigious fashion houses, including Chanel, Christian Dior, Giorgio Armani, Givenchy, Loris Azzaro, and Valentino, appearing in advertisements and fashion shows. While living in Paris, she shared a flat with Melania Trump.

Silvstedt was soon noticed by Hugh Hefner, who invited her to do a photo shoot for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in Los Angeles. She became the December 1996 Playmate of the Month, and was then chosen as the 1997 Playmate of the Year.

She has been featured on over 500 magazine covers.

===Acting===
Silvstedt has worked as an actress since the late 1990s, when she appeared in Hollywood television series such as &quot;Malibu, CA&quot; and &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. Since then, Silvstedt has also appeared in a number of Hollywood comedy films, including &quot;BASEketball&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;Out Cold&quot;, and &quot;Boat Trip&quot;. Silvstedt has also appeared as a guest actress on &quot;Ocean Ave.&quot;, a Miami-based soap opera, broadcast in Sweden and Florida.

Silvstedt has also starred in films and television series in various European countries, especially in Italy. As a leading actress, she has appeared in Italian films such as &quot;La mia vita a stelle e strisce&quot; and &quot;Un maresciallo in gondola&quot;, in which she played Kim Novak. She has also had supporting roles in films like &quot;Un&#x27;estate al mare&quot; and &quot;Matrimonio alle Bahamas&quot;. In 2010, Silvstedt starred in &quot;Just for the Record&quot;, a British mockumentary, starring also Steven Berkoff among others (Tagline: &quot;They made the worst film of all time... let the trial begin&quot;). She also had a small role in the French film &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, starring Romain Duris and Vanessa Paradis.

As for theatre, Silvstedt has appeared in the Off Broadway production, &quot;Pieces (of Ass)&quot;, during its run in Los Angeles in 2004.

===Presenting===
Silvstedt has been presenting numerous television shows and television specials all around the world since the 1990s. She has hosted entertainment shows such as &quot;Candid Camera&quot; on CBS, &quot;Eurotrash&quot; on Channel 4, and &quot;Wild On!&quot; on E!, and appeared as a presenter in various awards shows, including NRJ and World Music Awards. She has also served as a celebrity judge on &quot;Project Catwalk&quot;, the British reality television series focusing on fashion design.

In 2006, Silvstedt started working as a hostess of &quot;La Roue de la Fortune&quot; in France and &quot;La Ruota Della Fortuna&quot; in Italy. Both of the shows are based on the popular American game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, and Silvstedt divided her time between Paris and Rome, filming one of the shows for one month at a time, until 2009, when the Italian version was cancelled. As of 2012, Silvsted is no longer part of the French version either.

In 2010, Silvstedt hosted her own television show &quot;Sport by Victoria&quot; on Eurosport during the 2010 Winter Olympics. The light-hearted programme introduced different winter sports, and it was done both in English and French.

<doc id="1008510" wikidata="Q461707" url="?curid=1008510" title="Cupping therapy">
<text>Cupping therapy is a form of pseudoscience in which a local suction is created on the skin using heated cups. As alternative medicine it is practiced primarily in Asia but also in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. There is no conclusive evidence supporting the claimed health benefits of cupping, and critics have characterized the practice as quackery.

Cupping practitioners attempt to use cupping therapy for a wide array of medical conditions including fevers, chronic low back pain, poor appetite, indigestion, high blood pressure, acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, anemia, stroke rehabilitation, nasal congestion, infertility, and menstrual period cramping.

Despite the numerous ailments for which practitioners claim cupping therapy is useful, there is insufficient evidence demonstrating any health benefits. Cupping is generally not harmful for most people. However, there are some risks of harm, especially from wet cupping and fire cupping. Bruising and skin discoloration are among the adverse effects of cupping and are sometimes mistaken for child abuse. In rare instances, the presence of these marks on children has led to legal action against parents who had their children receive cupping therapy.

== Scientific evaluation ==
The American Cancer Society notes that &quot;available scientific evidence does not support claims that cupping has any health benefits&quot; and also that the treatment carries a small risk of burns. A review of literature in 2011 determined that &quot;the effectiveness of cupping is currently not well-documented for most conditions&quot;, and that systematic reviews showing efficacy for the treatment of pain &quot;were based mostly on poor quality primary studies.&quot; This was further supported by a review in 2014 which demonstrated that previous evidence supporting cupping has resulted from &quot;unreasonable design and poor research quality&quot;. There is a lack of evidence to support the use of cupping therapy for acne. Additionally, cupping is often practiced along with other acupuncture therapies and therefore cannot exclusively account for resultant positive benefits. Many reviews suggest there is insufficient scientific evidence to support the use of cupping techniques to combat relevant diseases and chronic pain. Cupping has been characterized as quackery.

The lack of apparent benefits of cupping treatments are discussed by Simon Singh and Edzard Ernst in their 2008 book &quot;Trick or Treatment&quot;.

As a pseudoscientific detoxification ritual, proponents of cupping falsely claim that it can remove unspecified toxins from the body. Proponents also falsely claim that cupping &quot;improves blood flow&quot; to help sore muscles. James Hamblin notes that a bruise caused by cupping &quot;is a blood clot, though, and clotted blood is definitionally not flowing.&quot;

Critics of alternative medicine have spoken out against cupping therapy. Harriet Hall and Mark Crislip have characterized cupping as &quot;pseudoscience nonsense&quot;, &quot;a celebrity fad&quot;, and &quot;gibberish&quot;, and observed that there is no evidence that cupping works any better than a placebo. Pharmacologist David Colquhoun writes that cupping is &quot;laughable... and utterly implausible.&quot; Practicing surgeon David Gorski observes that &quot;it&#x27;s all risk for no benefit. It has no place in modern medicine, or at least shouldn&#x27;t.&quot;

==Safety==
Cupping is generally considered safe for most people when performed by trained practitioners; however, it may not be suitable for everyone.

In 2016, the Cambodian Ministry of Health warned that cupping could be a health risk and particularly dangerous for people with high blood pressure or heart problems. According to the NCCIH &quot;Cupping can cause side effects such as persistent skin discoloration, scars, burns, and infections, and may worsen eczema or psoriasis&quot;.

Cupping causes breaks in the capillaries (small blood vessels) in the papillary dermis layer of the skin, resulting in the appearance of petechiae and purpura. These marks are sometimes mistaken for signs of child abuse when cupping is performed on children.

Cupping therapy adverse events can be divided into local and systemic adverse events. The local adverse events may include scar formation, burns, linear bruising or streaks (wet cupping), skin ulcers, undesired darkening of the skin, panniculitis, erythema ab igne, induction of the Koebner phenomenon in susceptible individuals with psoriasis, and pain at the cupping site. A theoretical risk of infection exists but there are no reports of this as of 2012.

== Claimed uses ==
Cupping practitioners use cupping therapy for a wide array of medical conditions including fevers, pain, poor appetite, indigestion, high blood pressure, acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, anemia, stroke rehabilitation, nasal congestion, infertility, and dysmenorrhea.

There is low to moderate evidence that cupping can reduce pain associated with musculoskeletal pain and myofascial pain syndrome, although the benefits may be indistinguishable from those of a placebo.

== Claimed mechanism of action ==
Proponents claim cupping has a therapeutic effect and removes unspecified &quot;toxins&quot;, stagnant blood, or &quot;vital energy&quot; when used over acupuncture points with the goal of improving blood circulation.

== Methods ==
Modern suction devices are sometimes used instead of the traditional cups.

While details vary between practitioners, societies, and cultures, the practice consists of drawing tissue into a cup placed on the targeted area by creating a partial vacuum – either by the heating and subsequent cooling of the air in the cup or via a mechanical pump. The cup is usually left in place for somewhere between five and fifteen minutes.

Cupping therapy types can be classified using four distinct methods of categorization. The first categorization system relates to &quot;technical types&quot; including dry, wet, massage, and flash cupping therapy. The second categorization relates to &quot;the power of suction-related types&quot; including light, medium, and strong cupping therapy. The third categorization relates to &quot;the method of suction-related types&quot; including fire, manual suction, and electrical suction cupping therapy. The fourth categorization relates to &quot;materials inside cups&quot; including herbal products, water, ozone, moxa, needle, and magnetic cupping therapy.

Further categories of cupping were developed later. The fifth relates to areas treated including facial, abdominal, female, male, and orthopedic cupping therapy. The sixth relates to &quot;other cupping types&quot; that include sports and aquatic cupping.
===Dry cupping===
Dry cupping involves the application of a heated cup on the skin of the back, chest, abdomen, or buttocks. The cooling of the air is then thought to create a suction effect. Bamboo and other materials are sometimes used as alternatives to glass cups.

=== Fire cupping ===

Fire cupping involves soaking a cotton ball in almost pure alcohol. The cotton is clamped by a pair of forceps and lit via match or lighter, and, in one motion, placed into the cup and quickly removed, while the cup is placed on the skin. The fire heats the air in the cup which, after cooling reduces in volume creating a negative pressure inside the cup. The cup is then quickly placed onto the body and the negative pressure &quot;sucks&quot; the skin up. Massage oil may be applied to create a better seal as well as allow the cups to glide over muscle groups (e.g. trapezius, erectors, latissimus dorsi, etc.) in an act called &quot;gliding cupping&quot; or &quot;sliding cupping&quot;. Dark circles may appear where the cups were placed because of capillary rupture under the skin. There are documented cases of burns caused by fire cupping.

=== Wet cupping ===
Wet cupping is also known as Hijama ( lit. &quot;sucking&quot;) or medicinal bleeding, where blood is drawn by local suction from a small skin incision.

The first reported usages are found in the Islamic hadith, sayings attributed to or describing the actions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Hadith from Muhammad al-Bukhari, Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj Nishapuri and Ahmad ibn Hanbal support its recommendation and use by Muhammad. As a result, wet cupping has remained a popular remedy practiced in many parts of the Muslim world.

In Finland, wet cupping has been done since the 15th century, and it is done traditionally in saunas. The cups were made of cattle horns with a valve mechanism inside to create a partial vacuum by sucking the air out. Cupping is still practiced in Finland as part of relaxing and/or health regimens.

The points used in wet and dry cupping are varied and intended to correspond to areas of pain and blockage. Over the years treatment plans have been created but, due to their holistic nature, the points used may vary depending on the individual.

===Traditional Chinese medicine===

In Chinese, cupping is known as &quot;pulling-up jars&quot; (). According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), cupping is done to dispel stagnation (stagnant blood and lymph), thereby improving &quot;qi&quot; flow, to treat respiratory diseases such as the common cold, pneumonia and bronchitis. Cupping is used on the back, neck, shoulder, and other musculoskeletal conditions. Its advocates claim it has other applications as well. Cupping is not advised, in TCM, over skin ulcers or to the abdominal or sacral regions of pregnant women.

==Society and culture==
Cupping has gained publicity in modern times due to its use by American sport celebrities including National Football League player DeMarcus Ware and Olympians Alex Naddour, Natalie Coughlin, and Michael Phelps. Medical doctor Brad McKay wrote that Team USA was doing a great disservice to their fans who might &quot;follow their lead&quot;, calling cupping an &quot;ancient (but useless) traditional therapy.&quot; Steven Novella noted &quot;It is unfortunate that elite athletics, including the Olympics, is such a hotbed for pseudoscience.&quot;

There is a description of cupping in George Orwell&#x27;s essay &quot;How the Poor Die&quot;, where he was surprised to find the antiquated practice applied to another patient in a Paris hospital. In the 1964 Hollywood film, &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; cupping is depicted with the character Zorba, played by Anthony Quinn, performing it on the character played by Lila Kedrova.

The perceived benefits of cupping have often been perpetuated by celebrities and athletes who use these therapeutic interventions in their daily lives. Professional swimmer Michael Phelps received publicity during the 2016 Olympics for the purple bruises evident on his back resulting from cupping. He has been known to &quot;do it before every meet he goes to to &quot;speed up recovery&quot;. Celebrity endorsements such as these may bias individuals to feel benefits from the practice.

==History==

The origin of cupping is unclear. Iranian traditional medicine uses wet-cupping practices, with the belief that cupping with scarification may eliminate scar tissue, and cupping without scarification would cleanse the body through the organs.

In ancient Greece, Hippocrates () used cupping for internal disease and structural problems, and Roman surgeons used it for bloodletting. The method was highly recommended by Islamic Prophet Muhammad and hence well-practiced by Muslim scientists who elaborated and developed the method further. Consequently, this method in its multiple forms spread into medicine throughout Asian and European civilizations. In China, the earliest use of cupping that is recorded is from the Taoist alchemist and herbalist Ge Hong (281–341 AD). Cupping was also mentioned in Maimonides&#x27; book on health and was used within the Eastern European Jewish community. William Osler recommended its use for pneumonia and acute myelitis in the early twentieth century.

The practice has been used in hospitals in China since the 1950s as a traditional Chinese medicine modality.

<text>Maria Deraismes (17 August 1828 – 6 February 1894) was a French author, Freemason, and major pioneering force for women&#x27;s rights.

== Biography ==

Born in Paris, Maria Deraismes grew up in Pontoise in the city&#x27;s northwest outskirts. From a prosperous middle-class family, she was well educated and raised in a literary environment. She wrote several literary works and soon developed a reputation as a very capable communicator. She became active in promoting women&#x27;s rights.

In 1866 a feminist group called the &quot;Société pour la Revendication du Droit des Femmes&quot; began to meet at the house of André Léo. Members included Paule Minck, Louise Michel, Eliska Vincent, Élie Reclus and his wife Noémie, Mme Jules Simon and Caroline de Barrau. Maria Deraismes was persuaded to participate.

Because of the broad range of opinions, the group decided to focus on the subject of improving girls&#x27; education. In 1870 Deraismes founded &quot;L&#x27;Association pour le droit des femmes&quot; with Léon Richer. She helped fund Richer&#x27;s paper &quot;Le Droit des femmes&quot;.

Following the ouster of Napoleon III, Deraismes understood the new politics of the day meant a more moderate approach under the Third Republic in order for feminism to survive and not be marginalized by the new breed of male power brokers emerging at the time. Deraismes&#x27;s work brought her recognition in Great Britain and she became an influence upon American activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who met her in Paris in 1882.

Maria Deraismes was initiated into Freemasonry on 14 January 1882, when it was still rare for a woman to be admitted into that Fraternity. She joined &quot;Les Libres Penseurs&quot; Lodge, of Pecq, a small village to the west of Paris. A year later, she and Georges Martin organized a Masonic lodge that allowed both men and women as members. From this co-masonic Lodge developed the Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise &quot;Le Droit Humain&quot;, which grew into the International Order of Freemasonry Le Droit Humain.

With support of other suffragettes such as Hubertine Auclert, Deraismes worked to achieve political emancipation for women. She stood as a symbolic candidate in the elections of 1885.

On her death in 1894, Deraismes was interred in the Montmartre Cemetery. Her complete writings were published in 1895. Much information on her work can be found at the Bibliothèque Marguerite Durand in Paris.

To honor her memory, a street in Paris was named for her. In addition, a statue was erected in a small park, Square de Epinettes in the 17th arrondissement. The town square in St. Nazaire was also named in her honor.

<text>Georges Courteline () born Georges Victor Marcel Moinaux (; 25 June 1858 – 25 June 1929) was a French dramatist and novelist, a satirist notable for his sharp wit and cynical humor.

==Biography==
His family moved from Tours in Indre-et-Loire to Paris shortly after his birth. During the time of the Paris Commune, at age 13, he was sent to school in Meaux and after graduation in 1876, he went on to serve in the French military before taking a job as a civil servant. Interested in poetry and authorship, he became involved in writing poetry reviews and was part of a small newspaper. By the 1890s, he had begun writing plays under the name Courteline for the theatres of Montmartre where he lived.

Gifted with a quick wit, he became a leading dramatist, producing many plays as well as a number of novels. The overall tone of his works was satirical in nature, often making fun of everything from the wealthy elitists of Paris to the bloated government bureaucracies. In 1899, Courteline was awarded the Legion of Honour and in 1926 was elected to the Académie Goncourt.

In 1929, Courteline died on his 71st birthday in Paris and was interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery. Rue de Lariche, the street in the city of Tours where he was born, was renamed in his honour.

<text>Tuxpan (or Túxpam, fully Túxpam de Rodríguez Cano, for Enrique Rodríguez Cano) is both a municipality and city located in the Mexican state of Veracruz. The population of the city was 89,557 and of the municipality was 154,600 inhabitants, according to the INEGI census of 2020, residing in a total area of . The municipality includes many smaller outlying communities, the largest of which are Alto Lucero (20,380 inhabitants) and Santiago de la Peña (8,178 inhabitants). A local beachside community is also nearby.

In the 1870s, a small colony of some hundreds of former Confederate (Southern U.S.) officers, soldiers and diplomats was established.

==Name==

Tuxpan or Túxpam, pronounced in Nahuatl, the language of the ancient Nahuas, literally means &quot;Place of Rabbits&quot;, a compound of &quot;tochtli&quot; &quot;rabbit&quot; and &quot;-pan&quot; &quot;place&quot;.

==Economy==

Being the nearest port to Mexico City, Tuxpan is an important commercial link for Mexican imports and exports. Tuxpan is now primarily a grain port, with emphasis on soybeans and maize. Off-shore links to oil pipelines are used to transfer petroleum products to and from tanker ships operated by Pemex, Mexico&#x27;s state-owned oil company. As part of the Pemex operations and infrastructure in the city, a facility on the river manufactures and maintains oil rigs for use in the Gulf of Mexico.
==Geography==
The city is located on the banks of the Tuxpan River, which reaches the Gulf of Mexico downstream.
===Climate===
Tuxpan experiences a tropical climate with warm winters and hot summers.


==Transport==

===Port of Tuxpan===
Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Puerto de Tuxpan&quot;, the port is able to handle supertanker-sized cargo ships.
Due to increasing commercial shipping traffic in the city of Veracruz, Tuxpan is now the headquarters for the Mexican Navy&#x27;s Gulf fleet. As such, it is the home port for several warships including three frigates named , and . These ships were originally s built in the 1960s. They were purchased from the United States Navy in the mid to late 1990s after their decommissioning.

Tuxpan was also the port of departure for the yacht &quot;Granma&quot; that was used to transport Fidel Castro, his brother Raúl, Che Guevara and other fighters of the Cuban Revolution from Mexico to Cuba in 1956 for the purpose of overthrowing the regime of Fulgencio Batista. A small museum near the river has photographs and other related memorabilia.

==Education==

Universidad Veracruzana has two campus in the city. The first, Biological and Agricultural Sciences Faculty opened in 1975 and offers careers related to the fields of Biology, Veterinary and Agricultural Engineering. The second one, the Accountancy Faculty offers careers related to administration and was opened in 1990.

<doc id="1008539" wikidata="Q281918" url="?curid=1008539" title="Calendering (textiles)">
<text>Calendering of textiles is a finishing process used to smooth, coat, or thin a material. With textiles, fabric is passed between calender rollers at high temperatures and pressures. Calendering is used on fabrics such as moire to produce its watered effect and also on cambric and some types of sateens.

In preparation for calendering, the fabric is folded lengthwise with the front side, or face, inside, and stitched together along the edges. The fabric can be folded together at full width, however this is done less often as it is more difficult. The fabric is then run through rollers at high temperatures and pressure that polish the surface and make the fabric smoother and more lustrous. Fabrics that go through the calendering process feel thin, glossy and papery.

The wash durability of a calendered finish on thermoplastic fibers like polyester is higher than on cellulose fibers such as cotton, though each depends on the amount and type of finishing additives used and the machinery and process conditions employed. Durability of blended fabrics reflects the above, and the proportion of synthetic fiber component.

==Variations==
Various finishes can be achieved through the calendering process by varying different aspects of the process. The main types are &quot;beetling&quot;, &quot;watered&quot;, &quot;embossing&quot;, and &quot;Schreiner&quot;.

===Beetled===
Beetling is a finish given to cotton and linen cloth, and makes it look like satin. In the beetling process the fabric goes over wooden rollers and is beaten with wooden hammers.

===Watered===
The watered finish, also known as moire, is produced by using ribbed rollers. These rollers compress the cloth and the ribs produce the characteristic watermark effect by differentially moving and compressing threads. In the process some threads are left round while others are flattened somewhat.

===Embossed===
The embossing process uses rollers with engraved patterns, which become stamped onto the fabric, which gives the fabric a raised and sunken look. This works best with soft fabrics.

===Schreiner===
Similar to the watered process, the Schreiner process used ribbed rollers, though very fine, with as many as six hundred ribs per inch. Pressed flat under extremely high pressure, the threads receive little lines, which causes the fabric to reflect light better than a flat surface. The high luster of cloth finished with the Schreiner method can be made more lasting by heating the rollers.

==History==
Historically calendering was done by hand with a huge pressing stone. For example, in China huge rocks were brought from the north of the Yangtze River. The pressing stone was cut into a bowl shape, and the surface of the curved bottom made perfectly smooth. After a piece of cloth was placed underneath the stone the worker would stand on the stone and rock it with his feet to press the cloth.

<doc id="1008558" wikidata="Q161729" url="?curid=1008558" title="Wülfrath">
<text>Wülfrath is a town in the district of Mettmann (district), in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Geography==
The town is situated on the mountain spurs of the Bergische Land, between the Rhine, Ruhr and Wupper rivers. It is located in the central part of the Berg region, approx. 12 km northeast of Düsseldorf.

The old town centre lies in the small valley of the Angerbach, a brook which rises nearby and flows through the town. The newer parts of the town are built on the valley slopes.

==History==
Wülfrath was one of the first settlements to be made in a clearing in the great Imperial forest of the early Middle Ages. The name means &quot;clearing of a man named Wolf&quot; and its date of origin is thought to be about 713. Around this has grown up the legend of a settler called Wolf who had been expelled from his clan and who is supposed to have made a clearing in the then luxuriant forest on the site of the present village centre.
In 875 the hundreds (&quot;Honnschaften&quot;) and present suburbs of Flandersbach (&quot;Flatmarasbeki&quot;, i.e., Flattmar&#x27;s brook) and Rützkausen (&quot;Hrotsteninghuson&quot;, i.e., the houses of Hrotse&#x27;s people) are named in a description of the places owing tithes to Werden Abbey on the Ruhr. In around 1100 the placename Wülfrath (&quot;Wolverothe&quot;) itself is at last mentioned in a document written in a monk&#x27;s hand at the religious house at Kaiserswerth.
The boundaries are given in a deed of grant of the Emperor Henry VI dated 16 October 1165 as the courses of the Rhein, Ruhr and Düssel (&quot;Tussella&quot;) rivers. The eastern boundary was the old highway of the &quot;Kölnische Straße&quot; (&quot;strata colonensis&quot;), which ran from the bridge over the Ruhr at Werden via Velbert and Wülfrath along the Düssel towards Cologne. The centre of the mediaeval village was a demesne farm or manor (Mollmershof), which as part of the lordship of Hardenberg was sold to the Counts of Berg. Possession of this manor, to which an extensive group of scattered farms belonged, particularly in the hundreds of Erbach and Püttbach, also gave control of the advowson of the church, that is, the right to appoint the priest.

As early as 1265 the presence of a smith can be demonstrated from the tax and rent register. The estate of Puttbach in the hundred of the same name was in the possession of the Teutonic Knights in 1392. It became the administrative centre for the order&#x27;s scattered properties, where every year the manorial court was held.

In 1578 the village was destroyed by a great fire, which also burnt the roof and tower of the church. To help mitigate the severe losses of the inhabitants, the local prince, Duke Johann Wilhelm IV of Jülich-Kleve-Berg, granted them in 1579 a charter of market rights, permitting his &quot;village and parish of Wulfrod&quot; four free markets a year. But exactly one hundred years after the first fire, another destroyed the entire village centre with more than 70 houses.

After the transfer of the Duchy of Berg to the French and the establishment of the Grand Duchy of Berg, out of the hundreds Erbach, Püttbach, Obschwarzbach, Niederschwarzbach (all previously Amt Mettmann), Flandersbach, Rützkausen (previously Amt Angermund) and Oberdüssel (previously in the lordship of Schöller) was formed in 1808 the municipality (&quot;mairie&quot;) of Wülfrath. In 1809 Obschwarzbach and Niederschwarzbach were added to Mettmann, in return for which, the hundred of Unterdüssel with the village of Düssel were given to Wülfrath.

After the wars of liberation the place came to Prussia, as part of the newly created Rhine Province. By an ordinance of 1827 Wülfrath was entitled to representation as part of the estate of towns in the Rhine Provincial Parliament. In 1856 it finally received full municipal rights with the passing of the town ordinance for the Rhine Province.

==Church and other buildings==
At the time of the first recorded reference in c. 1100, the first church building could already have been standing on the site of the present church square, a small early mediaeval church with a square choir. Since the 11th century a romanesque church stood there, which was extended and enlarged in the 15th century with Gothic additions. In the mid-15th century it was referred to as Saint Cornelius&#x27; church. The tower and north aisle with the wall separating it from the nave are romanesque, probably from the 12th century. The nave is Gothic, from the 14th century. The south aisle in Late Gothic style was completed, according to a capstone, in 1524. The church is surrounded by houses and shops built round it in a circle, forming a beautiful enclosed church square typical of the ancient Berg region.

The surrounding houses remain for the most part in their original state and are protected buildings, although others have been rebuilt. Each of them had (and still has) a name as well as a house number: &quot;Auf&#x27;m Keller&quot; (1678), &quot;Hamels&quot; (1678), &quot;Melanders&quot; (1678), &quot;Op der Ley&quot; (about 1600 - refurbished 1911), &quot;Auf&#x27;m Haus&quot; (1678),&quot; Großer Klaus&quot; (1686 - rebuilt 1964), &quot;Kleiner Klaus&quot; (1678), &quot;Scholle&quot; (1678), &quot;Hinter&#x27;m Turm&quot; (1678), &quot;Jostenhaus&quot; (refurbished about 1738), &quot;Hechtsteinhaus&quot; (1678), &quot;Op de Trapp&quot; (1678) and &quot;Leonhards&quot; (rebuilt 1955).

In 2001 a part of the historic Old Town yet again fell victim to the flames. During the night of 21 January 2001 a fire broke out which destroyed three of the old half-timbered houses. They had to be demolished, and have been replaced by modern buildings.

==Economics==
By the mid-19th century, more than 100 companies and businesses had established themselves, most of which were largish cottage industries, principally weaving on looms. After 1850, the first large-scale businesses, aided by steam technology, were created. Despite the strong industrialization of that time, the village&#x27;s agricultural character was not completely lost, but today only isolated agricultural enterprises exist.

Of particular significance was the arrival of quarrying in Wülfrath, with the establishment of the &quot;Rheinisch-Westfälische Kalkwerke Dornap&quot; in 1887, and the &quot;Rheinische Kalksteinwerke Wülfrath&quot; in 1903. Wülfrath now has the largest chalk and limestone quarries in Europe. These undertakings have been a decisive influence on the development of the town, and have remained the principal component of Wülfrath&#x27;s industrial life until now.

There continued to be numerous home-based weaving enterprises, as well as businesses involved in finishing leather and many other small firms. A branch of the Ford works at Cologne was founded here, rising out of the coachwork company &quot;Josef Hebmueller Soehne&quot;, established 1889, and still extant as &quot;(Tedrive)&quot;.

==Coat of arms==
After 1840, the Wülfrath coat of arms, modelled on an old seal of the Lutheran Reformed municipality, was designed by the Düsseldorf heraldic and painter Wolfgang Pagenstecher. In 1938 the arms were again re-designed and officially recognized by the President of the Rhine Province. The arms, showing a shepherd in mediaeval costume fending off a wolf with his staff, symbolize the victory of good over evil and refer to the town&#x27;s name, although not particularly to the settler Wolf.

<doc id="1008567" wikidata="Q1164393" url="?curid=1008567" title="HDMY Dannebrog (A540)">
<text>His Danish Majesty&#x27;s Yacht &quot;Dannebrog&quot; (A540) () was launched by Queen Alexandrine at Copenhagen in 1931, and commissioned on 26 May 1932. The yacht now serves as the official and private residence for King Frederik X, and members of the Royal Family when they are on official visits overseas and on summer cruises in Danish waters. When at sea, the Royal Yacht also participates in surveillance and sea-rescue services.

==Features==
The &quot;Dannebrog&quot;, named after the flag of Denmark, was built in 1931–1932 at the Naval Dockyard in Copenhagen. She replaced the previous royal vessel, an 1879 paddle steamer, also called &quot;Dannebrog&quot;. The yacht originally had dual functions: to serve as the Royal Yacht in peacetime and to become a hospital ship in time of war. Given her age, however, it is highly unlikely that she would be called upon to resume the latter role in the 21st century. 

The ship&#x27;s hull is of rivetted steel construction on transverse frames. The ship has a clipper bow and an elliptical (&#x27;counter&#x27;) stern. Viewed from the side, the ship may be divided into two sections. Forward of the funnel there is space for the crew, any cargo, and the engine. At the rear is the Royal Apartment, which could accommodate patients if ever the yacht were needed as a hospital ship. On visits to Danish and foreign ports the covered quarterdeck is used for receptions.

The Royal accommodation comprises studies for the King and the Queen Consort, a Dining Saloon, Lounge, Bedrooms, etc. The parents of the current King took a personal interest in fitting out the vessel and the choice of furnishings. The Royal Apartment contains furniture and fittings from the previous 1879 Royal vessel.

The Royal Yacht &quot;Dannebrog &quot;is an independent command, administered by the Chief of the King&#x27;s Naval Household, who is a member of the Royal Household. The crew of the &quot;Dannebrog &quot;comprises 9 officers, 7 sergeants, 2 enlisted able-seamen and 34 conscripts. The officers are normally seconded for periods of two to four years, whereas the conscripts stay for just one summer.

==History==

Since she was commissioned in 1932, the Dannebrog has travelled more than and visited most of the ports of Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands. The yacht has also visited European ports, especially in France and cruised the Mediterranean and the Caribbean Seas. Following Operation Safari, in 1943, Dannebrog was the only ship left untouched by the Germans. On 7 July 1956, &quot;Dannebrog&quot; collided with the British sloop , breaking her bowsprit.

Jørgen Hviid served as one of the ship&#x27;s captains. A major overhaul was carried out in 1980–81 to extend the life of the yacht into the 21st century. She is still in excellent condition, with major improvements having been made, including replacement of the main engines.

<doc id="1008575" wikidata="Q167993" url="?curid=1008575" title="Pella, Jordan">
<text>Pella (, ) was an ancient city in what is now northwest Jordan, and contains ruins from the Neolithic, Chalcolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Canaanite, Hellenistic and Islamic periods. It is located near a rich water source within the eastern foothills of the Jordan Valley, close to the modern village of Ṭabaqat Faḥl () some south of the Sea of Galilee (Lake Tiberias). The site is situated north of Amman: a drive of about two hours (due to the difficult terrain), and an hour southwest by car from Irbid, in the north of the country. Pella&#x27;s ruins – predominantly temples, churches, and housing – have been partially excavated by teams of archaeologists; they attract thousands of tourists annually but especially in spring, during which time the area is awash with spring flowers.

==Tourism==
During the Roman period, Pella was a thriving city with evidence of urban planning, public spaces, and luxurious villas. The city’s location along ancient trade routes contributed to its prosperity.
==Name==
The Semitic name of the ancient, pre-Hellenistic site, was Pahil or Pihil. Pehal is the name under which the city is mentioned in early Egyptian (Bronze Age) historical texts.

Pella is the name of Alexander the Great&#x27;s birthplace in Macedonia. It is not known (as of 2006) who founded the Hellenistic town of Pella in Transjordan, which makes it hard to assess who exactly gave it its Greek name and precisely why. Stephanos (fl. 6th century CE), a quite late source, seems to indicate that it was founded by Alexander himself, and Ptolemy III Euergetes is another possible founder. &quot;The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites&quot; write that it was founded by veterans of Alexander&#x27;s army, and named it after the Pella in Greece which was the birthplace of Alexander. Getzel M. Cohen sees it as plausible that the name Pella was chosen either due to its similarity with the older Semitic name, or due to a common characteristic of both the Macedonian and Transjordan sites: their richness in springs. For the Greek meaning of the name, see the Etymology paragraph in the article on the original Pella. The town is said to have been called Pihilum.

Berenike in Greek, often Latinised to Berenice, is another name of Pella from the Hellenistic period, based on only one source: Stephanos. The Macedonian name Berenike was often used in the royal family of Ptolemaic Egypt, who conquered southern Syria and thus Pella in 301, and ruled over the city until 218 BCE, when they lost it to the Seleucid king Antiochos III. It is not possible to assess after which Ptolemid the city was renamed, possible candidates being the wife of Ptolemy I, a daughter of Ptolemy II, and the wife of Ptolemy III. Cohen presumes that under Seleucid rule, the city reverted right away to being called Pella.

Philippeia is another name of the city from the Roman period,
 seen by Cohen as an attempt of claiming Marcius Philippus as its founder as a reaction to other cities in the region claiming an illustrious, but fictitious pedigree.

The Arab geographer of Greek origin, Yaqut (1179–1229), could find no Arabic meaning for the modern name Fahl and believed it to be of foreign origin.

==History and archaeology==
Pella has been almost continuously occupied since Neolithic times. During the Hellenistic period, the town formed with other like-minded towns in the region a political and cultural league known as the &quot;Decapolis&quot;, an alliance that grew in stature and economic importance to become regionally influential under Roman jurisdiction. However, Pella expanded to its largest size during the Byzantine period, when it was a bishopric in the province of Palaestina Secunda. In Islamic times, after 635 CE, the town became part of the Jund al-Urdunn (Province of Jordan), but in time was negatively impacted by natural calamities and eclipsed by the geo-political successes of the nearby towns of Amman, Beisan and especially Tabariyah (Tiberias).

===Neolithic===
The University of Sydney&#x27;s Pella Excavation Project discovered at Tabaqat Fahl the remains of Neolithic housing dated to ca. 6000 BCE.

===Chalcolithic===
The Australian teams also found storage complexes from the Chalcolithic period (ca. 4200 BCE). Since being headed by Stephen Bourke in the 1990s, the excavation has been focusing on the site&#x27;s Bronze Age and Iron Age temples and administrative buildings.

=== Early Bronze ===
In May 2010 Bourke announced to the press the discovery of a city wall and other structures dating back to 3400 BCE and some even to 3600 BCE, indicating that the city standing at the top of Pella&#x27;s Tell Husn at the time was a &quot;formidable&quot; city-state around 3400-3200 BCE, at the same time the cities of Sumer were taking shape. The official University of Sydney excavation page only mentions Early Bronze Age stone defensive platforms from ca. 3200 BCE.

=== Middle Bronze ===

The Middle Bronze Age IIA city of ca. 1800 BCE boasted massive mud-brick city walls. Australian archaeologists also discovered Middle and Late Bronze Age temples and palatial residences (ca. 1800-1200 BCE). The city was first mentioned in the 19th century BCE in Egyptian execration texts, and it continued to flourish throughout the Bronze Age. A Canaanite temple was uncovered during the 1994-2003 campaigns.

=== Late Bronze ===
In the Amarna Period (c. 1350 BC), Pella was the site of an Egyptian &quot;governor&#x27;s residence&quot; containing clay tablets. The Amarna Archive contains letters showing that the city was ruled by ruled by Mutbaal, a son of Labaya of Shechem. Apparently, they rebelled and expanded their territory and associated with the Habiru.

=== Iron Age ===
The urban heart of the Iron Age city-kingdom seems to have suffered a major destruction in the later 9th century, from which it did not recover.

===Hellenistic period===
Re-established as an urban centre under the early Seleucids, its ancient name must still have been known, for its new, Greek name was a close synonym, Pella – the birthplace of Alexander the Great in Macedon.

As yet no public buildings from the Hellenistic period have been identified, although well-appointed private houses attest to their integration into the wider norms of urban living, such as wall-paintings and statuary. Several of these houses suffered what appears to be the same fiery destruction in the Late Hellenistic period. This has been attributed to a massive destruction by the Hasmonean king, Alexander Jannaeus, about 83 or 82 BCE (Josephus, &quot;The Jewish War&quot; 14.4.8; &quot;Antiquities&quot; 14.4.4). From Josephus, it is clear that Pella had been damaged and so needed some restoration by Pompey decades afterwards, but his specific reference to the destruction of Pella by Jannaeus because its inhabitants refusing to follow Jewish customs, seems to refer to a different place (&quot;Antiquities&quot;, XIII.395-397): it is listed as if amongst southern Levantine cities and out of its more normal sequence between Gadara, Gerasa and Scythopolis.

===Roman period===
In 63 BCE, the Roman General Pompey integrated the region into the Eastern portion of the Roman Empire, converting the old Seleucid empire into the province of Coele-Syria and incorporating Judaea as a client kingdom. A group of cities claiming Greek Hellenistic foundations asked Pompey to avoid incorporation within Rome&#x27;s new client-state of Hasmonaean Judaea. Pompey agreed, and these cities were called the Decapolis – literally, the ten cities – although the lists which have survived vary in composition and number. Pella, however, is consistently a &quot;Decapolis&quot; city, and the city in the northernmost bounds of the region known as Perea. If these cities had previously dated their years from their foundation under Alexander the Great or Seleucis I Nicator, they now honoured Pompey by counting 63 BC as a new &quot;Year One&quot;. Like most cities within the empire, Pella would have had its own town council. It also minted coins in the Roman period.

Pella was incorporated within Roman Judaean territory (&quot;Jewish Wars&quot; 3.5). According to Josephus, Scaurus &quot;laid waste the country around Pella&quot; (&quot;The Jewish War&quot; 1.8.1). Pella was one of eleven administrative districts (toparchies) in Roman Judea. During the outbreak of the First Jewish-Roman War, when the Syrian inhabitants of Caesarea had slain its Jewish citizens, there was a general Jewish uprising against neighboring Syrian villages, who sought revenge for the murder of their countrymen, during which time Pella was ransacked and destroyed. Growing Jewish dissent over Roman military occupation in Judea brought about Roman reprisals against Jewish enclaves in the regions of Galilee, the coastal plains of Judea, Idumea and Perea, until, at length, the Roman army had subdued all insurgents and their military governors established during the Jewish revolt.

University of Sydney digs unearthed the theatre, baths, and nymphaeum of the Roman city of ca. 150 CE.

====First Christians: the &quot;flight to Pella&quot;====
In what is known as the &quot;flight to Pella&quot;, sometime before the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, tradition holds that a Jewish-Christian sect of Nazoreans made their way to Pella and settled in the city which became a Jewish Christian hub during the early days of Christianity. According to Epiphanius, the disciples had been miraculously told by Christ to abandon Jerusalem because of the siege it was about to undergo.

Epiphanius claims that after the destruction, some returned to Jerusalem. Similarly to Epiphanius, Eusebius of Caesarea recounts how Pella was a refuge for Jerusalem Christians who were fleeing the First Jewish–Roman War in the 1st century CE. Pella is alleged to have been the site of one of Christianity&#x27;s earliest churches, but no evidence has been found of this. According to historian Edward Gibbon, the early Church of Jerusalem fled to Pella after the ruin of the temple, staying there until their return during the reign of Emperor Hadrian, making it a secondary pilgrimage site for early Christians and modern Christians today.

===Byzantine period===
In the late Roman and Byzantine periods, the town extended over the ancient tell (archaeological mound), across the broad central valley of the town today known as the &quot;Wadi al-Jirm&quot; (see photograph), and over the slopes and summit of the southern hill known as &quot;Tell al-Husn&quot;. By the Byzantine era, Pella had reached its maximum size and, probably, prosperity. Being part of the province of &quot;Palaestina Secunda&quot; (&quot;second Palestine&quot;), it certainly had a bishop by the year AD 451. At least three triapsidal churches have been identified within the city: the West Church at the western foot of the tell; the Civic Complex church in the &quot;Wadi al-Jirm&quot; at the southeast foot of the tell and which, due to its size and location, was probably the cathedral; and the elevated East Church on the higher slopes of the &quot;Jebel Abu el-Khas&quot;. A Bishop&#x27;s palace from ca. 550 CE was also discovered. On the tell, the entire summit was leveled off and a new gridded urban zone constructed during the time of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I. The access streets were lined with newly built shops and large buildings, serving both commercial and residential functions. This concern with urban development matched similar activities in other Decapolis towns, such as Gadara (Umm Qays) and Gerasa (Jerash/Jarash), and reflects the role of regional centres in serving local populations during late antiquity.

===Early Islamic period===
On the plain of the Jordan Valley below Pella, a historically decisive battle took place in January 635 CE (13 AH) between a Muslim army and the Byzantine forces stationed at Pella and Scythopolis (Beit She&#x27;an; Beisan). This encounter, one of the earliest between Muslims and Byzantines, came to be known as the Battle of Fihl (also Battle of Fahl, Fahl being a later variant of Fihl). As the Byzantine forces practically annihilated in this battle, the Muslims forces continued to the town of Pella, where they faced little resistance with the town of Pella surrendering by treaty, thereby avoiding occupation by military conquest. Accordingly, the archaeological record shows no disruption attributable to the arrival of Islam, as was the case for nearly all the towns of Bilad al-Sham. Rather, the churches, markets and houses of Pella continued in use, with the archaeology showing their progressive modification to meet evolving social and political conditions, as in many of the other towns of the Decapolis alliance in north Jordan. In particular, a large market and workshop area was installed adjacent to the Civic Complex church at the heart of the Byzantine town plan.
Umayyad Pella, which by the eighth century CE had officially returned to its original Semitic name of Fihl (variant of Pihil), was totally devastated by the massive 749 Galilee earthquake, as a Jordan Valley rift fault line runs directly under the site. The stone and mudbrick two-storeyed houses on the top of the tell (main mound) collapsed in on themselves, thereby trapping the inhabitants – human and animal – and preserving a rich collection of finds sourced from distant regions, such as Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula.

Subsequent settlement at Pella, dated from the later eighth to eleventh centuries CE (from the Abbasid into the Fatimid period), was reduced in size, but featured an enclosed double-courtyard architectural complex in the valley immediately north of the tell. The configuration of the complex suggests markets (khans), with commercial activities such as glass workshops. An Abbasid khan (caravanserai) dating to ca. 950 CE was unearthed at Pella. Recent work on the tell has identified widespread rebuilding following the 749 earthquake, as indicated by wall foundations, plastered floors and refuse pits filled with finely worked bone and moulded glassware.

===Later history===
Evidence for a presence in the Crusader period (12th century CE) is slight – a few pottery sherds only – but in the following Ayyubid and Mamluk periods the flat summit of the tell was inhabited by a large village, featuring a stone-built mosque with a minbar (pulpit), residential compounds defined by lane ways, and a large cemetery. Australian archaeologists discovered a Mameluke mosque and administrative compound (ca. 1350 CE). Late 16th century Ottoman &quot;defter&quot;s list a village called Fahl el Tahta in the administrative district of Ajlun where wheat, barley, and sesame were grown and taxes collected on goats, beehives and water-driven mills.

=== Recent excavations ===

The site was first published as part of a regional survey by G. Schumacher, but the first excavation was conducted by Funk and Richardson only in 1958, revealing Bronze and Iron Age material in two soundings. From 1966–1967, R. H. Smith led a team from Wooster College (Ohio) to prepare a plan of the site and its environs, and begin excavations, but was interrupted by the Six Day War. A joint project with the University of Sydney (Australia), but with separate excavation teams and seasons, explored the city from 1978–1985. The Australian expedition was initially directed by Prof. J. B. Hennessy and Dr A. W. McNicoll. Wooster stopped excavations in 1985, but the Australian project continues. Between 1994 and 1996, Pam Watson (at the time, Asst Director of the British Institute at &#x27;Amman) and Dr Margaret O&#x27;Hea of the University of Adelaide conducted the Pella Hinterland Survey to identify land-use in an area approx. 30 square km around the city. 
Since the 1990s, with the project headed by Stephen Bourke, the focus has been on the site&#x27;s Bronze and Iron Age temples and administrative buildings. A Canaanite temple was uncovered between 1994 and 2003. In 2010 Stephen Bourke announced the discovery of a city wall and other structures, some dating back to the mid-4th millennium BCE.

<doc id="1008588" wikidata="Q11038979" url="?curid=1008588" title="Cult">
<text>Cult is a term often applied to new religious movements and other social groups which have unusual, and often extreme, religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs and rituals. Extreme devotion to a particular person, object, or goal is another characteristic often ascribed to cults. The term has different, and sometimes divergent or pejorative, definitions both in popular culture and academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study.

Beginning in the 1930s, new religious movements became an object of sociological study within the context of the study of religious behavior. Since the 1940s, the Christian countercult movement has opposed some sects and new religious movements, labeling them cults because of their unorthodox beliefs. Since the 1970s, the secular anti-cult movement has opposed certain groups, which they call cults, accusing them of practicing brainwashing.

Groups labelled cults are found around the world and range in size from small localized groups to some international organizations with up to millions of members.

== Definition and usage ==
The word &quot;cult&quot; is derived from the Latin term , which means worship. In English the term &quot;cult&quot; usually carries derogatory connotations. The term is variously applied to abusive or coercive groups of many categories, including gangs, organized crime, and terrorist organizations.

An older sense of the word cult, which is not pejorative, indicates a set of religious devotional practices that is conventional within its culture, is related to a particular figure, and is frequently associated with a particular place, or generally the collective participation in rites of religion. References to the imperial cult of ancient Rome, for example, use the word in this sense. A derived sense of &quot;excessive devotion&quot; arose in the 19th century, and usage is not always strictly religious.

Sociological classifications of religious movements may identify a cult as a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults, saying that they arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. Cults have been compared to miniature totalitarian political systems. Such groups are typically perceived as being led by a charismatic leader who tightly controls its members. It is in some contexts a pejorative term, also used for new religious movements and other social groups which are defined by their unusual religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs and rituals, or their common interest in a particular person, object, or goal. This sense of the term is weakly definedhaving divergent definitions both in popular culture and academiaand has also been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. 
According to Susannah Crockford, &quot;[t]he word ‘cult’ is a shapeshifter, semantically morphing with the intentions of whoever uses it. As an analytical term, it resists rigorous definition.&quot; She argued that the least subjective definition of cult referred to a religion or religion-like group &quot;self-consciously building a new form of society&quot;, but that the rest of society rejected as unacceptable. The term cult has been criticized as lacking &quot;scholarly rigour&quot;; Benjamin E. Zeller stated &quot;[l]abelling any group with which one disagrees and considers deviant as a cult may be a common occurrence, but it is not scholarship&quot;. However, it has also been viewed as empowering for ex-members of groups that have experienced trauma. Religious scholar Catherine Wessinger argued the term was dehumanizing of the people within the group, as well as their children; following the Waco siege, it was argued by some scholars that the defining of the Branch Davidians as a cult by the media, government and former members is a significant factor as to what lead to the deaths. The term was noted to carry &quot;considerable cultural legitimacy&quot;.

In the 1970s, with the rise of secular anti-cult movements, scholars (though not the general public) began to abandon the use of the term &quot;cult&quot;, regarding it as pejorative. By the end of the 1970s, the term cult was largely replaced in academia with the term &quot;new religion&quot; or &quot;new religious movement&quot;. Other proposed alternative terms that have been used were &quot;emergent religion&quot;, &quot;alternative religious movement&quot;, or &quot;marginal religious movement&quot;, though new religious movement is the most popular term. The anti-cult movement mostly regards the term &quot;new religious movement&quot; as a euphemism for &quot;cult&quot; that loses the implication that they are harmful.

== Scholarly studies ==

Beginning in the 1930s, new religious movements perceived as cults became an object of sociological study within the context of the study of religious behavior. The term in this context saw its origins in the work of sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920). Weber is an important theorist in the academic study of cults, which often draws on his theorizations of charismatic authority, and of the distinction he drew between churches and sects. This concept of church-sect division was further elaborated upon by German theologian Ernst Troeltsch, who added a &quot;mystical&quot; categorization to define more personal religious experiences. American sociologist Howard P. Becker further bisected Troeltsch&#x27;s first two categories: &quot;church&quot; was split into &quot;ecclesia&quot; and &quot;denomination&quot;; and &quot;sect&quot; into &quot;sect&quot; and &quot;cult&quot;. Like Troeltsch&#x27;s &quot;mystical religion&quot;, Becker&#x27;s &quot;cult&quot; refers to small religious groups that lack in organization and emphasize the private nature of personal beliefs.Later sociological formulations built on such characteristics, placing an additional emphasis on cults as deviant religious groups, &quot;deriving their inspiration from outside of the predominant religious culture.&quot; This is often thought to lead to a high degree of tension between the group and the more mainstream culture surrounding it, a characteristic shared with religious sects. According to this sociological terminology, &quot;sects&quot; are products of religious schism and therefore maintain a continuity with traditional beliefs and practices, whereas &quot;cults&quot; arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices.

Scholars William Sims Bainbridge and Rodney Stark have argued for a further distinction between three kinds of cults: cult movements, client cults, and audience cults, all of which share a &quot;compensator&quot; or rewards for the things invested into the group. In their typology, a &quot;cult movement&quot; is an actual complete organization, differing from a &quot;sect&quot; in that it is not a splinter of a bigger religion, while &quot;audience cults&quot; are loosely organized, and propagated through media, and &quot;client cults&quot; offer services (i.e. psychic readings or meditation sessions). One type can turn into another, for example the Church of Scientology changing from audience to client cult. Sociologists who follow their definition tend to continue using the word &quot;cult&quot;, unlike most other academics; however Bainbridge later stated he regretted having used the word at all. Stark and Bainbridge, in discussing the process by which individuals join new religious groups, have even questioned the utility of the concept of &quot;conversion&quot;, suggesting that &quot;affiliation&quot; is a more useful concept.

In the early 1960s, sociologist John Lofland studied the activities of Unification Church members in California in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships. Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled &quot;The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes&quot;, and in 1966 in book form by as &quot;Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization and Maintenance of Faith&quot;. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion.

J. Gordon Melton stated that, in 1970, &quot;one could count the number of active researchers on new religions on one&#x27;s hands.&quot; However, James R. Lewis writes that the &quot;meteoric growth&quot; in this field of study can be attributed to the cult controversy of the early 1970s. Because of &quot;a wave of nontraditional religiosity&quot; in the late 1960s and early 1970s, academics perceived new religious movements as different phenomena from previous religious innovations.

== Types ==
=== Destructive cults ===
&quot;Destructive cult&quot; is a term frequently used by the anti-cult movement. Members of the anti-cult movement typically define a destructive cult as a group that is unethical, deceptive, and one that uses &quot;strong influence&quot; or mind control techniques to affect critical thinking skills. This term is sometimes presented in contrast to a &quot;benign cult&quot;, which implies that not all &quot;cults&quot; would be harmful, though others apply it to all cults. Psychologist Michael Langone, executive director of the anti-cult group International Cultic Studies Association, defines a destructive cult as &quot;a highly manipulative group which exploits and sometimes physically and/or psychologically damages members and recruits.&quot;

In &quot;Cults and the Family&quot;, the authors cite Eli Shapiro, who defines a &quot;destructive cultism&quot; as a sociopathic syndrome, whose distinctive qualities include: &quot;behavioral and personality changes, loss of personal identity, cessation of scholastic activities, estrangement from family, disinterest in society and pronounced mental control and enslavement by cult leaders.&quot; Writing about Bruderhof communities in the book &quot;Misunderstanding Cults&quot;, Julius H. Rubin said that American religious innovation created an unending diversity of sects. These &quot;new religious movements…gathered new converts and issued challenges to the wider society. Not infrequently, public controversy, contested narratives and litigation result.&quot; In his work &quot;Cults in Context&quot; author Lorne L. Dawson writes that although the Unification Church &quot;has not been shown to be violent or volatile,&quot; it has been described as a destructive cult by &quot;anticult crusaders.&quot; In 2002, the German government was held by the Federal Constitutional Court to have defamed the Osho movement by referring to it, among other things, as a &quot;destructive cult&quot; with no factual basis.

Some researchers have criticized the term &quot;destructive cult&quot;, writing that it is used to describe groups which are not necessarily harmful in nature to themselves or others. In his book &quot;Understanding New Religious Movements&quot;, John A. Saliba writes that the term is overgeneralized. Saliba sees the Peoples Temple as the &quot;paradigm of a destructive cult&quot;, where those that use the term are implying that other groups will also commit mass suicide.

=== Doomsday cults ===

&quot;Doomsday cult&quot; is a term which is used to describe groups that believe in apocalypticism and millenarianism, and it can also be used to refer both to groups that predict disaster, and groups that attempt to bring it about. In the 1950s, American social psychologist Leon Festinger and his colleagues observed members of a small UFO religion called the Seekers for several months, and recorded their conversations both prior to and after a failed prophecy from their charismatic leader. Their work was later published in the book &quot;When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group that Predicted the Destruction of the World&quot;.

In the late 1980s, doomsday cults were a major topic of news reports, with some reporters and commentators considering them a serious threat to society. A 1997 psychological study by Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter found that people turned to a cataclysmic world view after they had repeatedly failed to find meaning in mainstream movements.

=== Political cults ===
A political cult is a cult with a primary interest in political action and ideology. Groups that some have described as &quot;political cults&quot;, mostly advocating far-left or far-right agendas, have received some attention from journalists and scholars. In their 2000 book &quot;On the Edge: Political Cults Right and Left&quot;, Dennis Tourish and Tim Wohlforth discuss about a dozen organizations in the United States and Great Britain that they characterize as cults.

==Anti-cult movements==

===Christian countercult movement===

In the 1940s, the long-held opposition by some established Christian denominations to non-Christian religions and heretical or counterfeit Christian sects crystallized into a more organized Christian countercult movement in the United States. For those belonging to the movement, all religious groups claiming to be Christian, but deemed outside of Christian orthodoxy, were considered cults. The countercult movement is mostly evangelical protestants. The Christian countercult movement asserts that Christian groups whose teachings deviate from the belief that the bible is inerrant, but also focuses on non-Christian religions like Hinduism. Christian countercult activist writers also emphasize the need for Christians to evangelize to followers of cults.

===Secular anti-cult movement===

Starting in the late 1960s, a different strand of anti-cult groups arose, with the formation of the secular anti-cult movement (ACM). This was in response to the rise of new religions in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the events at Jonestown and the deaths of nearly 1000 people. The organizations that formed the secular anti-cult movement (ACM) often acted on behalf of relatives of &quot;cult&quot; converts who did not believe their loved ones could have altered their lives so drastically by their own free will. A few psychologists and sociologists working in this field suggested that brainwashing techniques were used to maintain the loyalty of cult members.

The belief that cults brainwashed their members became a unifying theme among cult critics and in the more extreme corners of the anti-cult movement techniques like the sometimes forceful &quot;deprogramming&quot; of cult members was practised. In the mass media, and among average citizens, &quot;cult&quot; gained an increasingly negative connotation, becoming associated with things like kidnapping, brainwashing, psychological abuse, sexual abuse, and other criminal activity, and mass suicide. While most of these negative qualities usually have real documented precedents in the activities of a very small minority of new religious groups, mass culture often extends them to any religious group viewed as culturally deviant, however peaceful or law abiding it may be.

While some psychologists were receptive to these theories, sociologists were for the most part sceptical of their ability to explain conversion to NRMs. In the late 1980s, psychologists and sociologists started to abandon theories like brainwashing and mind control. While scholars may believe that various less dramatic coercive psychological mechanisms could influence group members, they came to see conversion to new religious movements principally as an act of a rational choice.

==Governmental policies and actions==

The application of the labels &quot;cult&quot; or &quot;sect&quot; to religious movements in government documents signifies the popular and negative use of the term &quot;cult&quot; in English and a functionally similar use of words translated as &#x27;sect&#x27; in several European languages. Sociologists critical to this negative politicized use of the word &quot;cult&quot; argue that it may adversely impact the religious freedoms of group members. At the height of the counter-cult movement and ritual abuse scare of the 1990s, some governments published lists of cults. Groups labelled &quot;cults&quot; are found around the world and range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.

While these documents utilize similar terminology, they do not necessarily include the same groups nor is their assessment of these groups based on agreed criteria. Other governments and world bodies also report on new religious movements but do not use these terms to describe the groups. Since the 2000s, some governments have again distanced themselves from such classifications of religious movements. While the official response to new religious groups has been mixed across the globe, some governments aligned more with the critics of these groups to the extent of distinguishing between &quot;legitimate&quot; religion and &quot;dangerous&quot;, &quot;unwanted&quot; cults in public policy.

=== China ===

For centuries, governments in China have categorized certain religions as &quot;xiéjiào&quot; (), translated as &quot;evil cults&quot; or &quot;heterodox teachings&quot;. In imperial China, the classification of a religion as did not necessarily mean that a religion&#x27;s teachings were believed to be false or inauthentic; rather, the label was applied to religious groups that were not authorized by the state, or it was applied to religious groups that were believed to challenge the legitimacy of the state. Groups branded &quot;&quot; face suppression and punishment by authorities.

===Russia===
In 2008 the Russian Interior Ministry prepared a list of &quot;extremist groups&quot;. At the top of the list were Islamic groups outside of &quot;traditional Islam&quot;, which is supervised by the Russian government. Next listed were &quot;Pagan cults&quot;. In 2009 the Russian Ministry of Justice created a council which it named the &quot;Council of Experts Conducting State Religious Studies Expert Analysis.&quot; The new council listed 80 large sects which it considered potentially dangerous to Russian society, and it also mentioned that there were thousands of smaller ones. The large sects which were listed included: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and other sects which were loosely referred to as &quot;neo-Pentecostals&quot;.

=== United States ===
In the 1970s, the scientific status of the &quot;brainwashing theory&quot; became a central topic in U.S. court cases where the theory was used to try to justify the use of the forceful deprogramming of cult members. Meanwhile, sociologists who were critical of these theories assisted advocates of religious freedom in defending the legitimacy of new religious movements in court. In the United States the religious activities of cults are protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which prohibits governmental establishment of religion and protects freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly; however, no members of religious groups or cults are granted any special immunity from criminal prosecution.

In 1990, the court case of &quot;United States v. Fishman&quot; (1990) ended the usage of brainwashing theories by expert witnesses such as Margaret Singer and Richard Ofshe. In the case&#x27;s ruling, the court cited the Frye standard, which states that the scientific theory which is utilized by expert witnesses must be generally accepted in their respective fields. The court deemed brainwashing to be inadmissible in expert testimonies, using supporting documents which were published by the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control, literature from previous court cases in which brainwashing theories were used, and expert testimonies which were delivered by scholars such as Dick Anthony.

=== Western Europe ===

The governments of France and Belgium have taken policy positions which accept &quot;brainwashing&quot; theories uncritically, while the governments of other European nations, such as those of Sweden and Italy, are cautious with regard to brainwashing and as a result, they have responded more neutrally with regard to new religions. Scholars have suggested that the outrage which followed the mass murder/suicides perpetuated by the Solar Temple, have significantly contributed to European anti-cult positions. In the 1980s, clergymen and officials of the French government expressed concern that some orders and other groups within the Roman Catholic Church would be adversely affected by anti-cult laws which were then being considered.

<doc id="1008593" wikidata="Q1536163" url="?curid=1008593" title="State of Sequoyah">
<text>The State of Sequoyah was a proposed state to be established from the Indian Territory in eastern present-day Oklahoma. In 1905, with the end of tribal governments looming, Native Americans (the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole) in Indian Territory proposed to create a state as a means to retain control of their lands. Their intention was to have a state under Native American constitution and governance. Their efforts failed to gain support in Congress, and the territory was annexed to the United States in 1907.

== Background ==

Starting in 1890, when Congress passed the Oklahoma Organic Act, the land that now forms the State of Oklahoma was made up of two separate territories: Oklahoma Territory to the west and the Indian Territory to the east. The Indian Territory had a large Native American population. The territory had been reduced by required land cessions after the Civil War, land runs, and other treaties with the United States. In the 1900 US Census, Native Americans composed 13.4 percent of the population in the future state. By 1905, the Five Civilized Tribes comprised about 10% of the Indian Territory&#x27;s total population of around 600,000 people.

Despite having been previously exempt from the 1887 General Allotment Act, the Curtis Act of 1898 allowed Congress to set a date (March 4, 1906) for the breakup of tribal governments and communal lands in the territory. Until 1903, the Five Civilized Tribes and other tribes in Indian Territory had generally opposed all local and national efforts for statehood, whether they were single or joint with Oklahoma Territory. That changed as the termination deadline approached.

== Constitutional convention ==

The desire of tribal leaders to retain their historic authority and for the territory to be admitted as a single state, apart from Oklahoma Territory, culminated in July 1905 with the Cherokee Chief W.C. Rogers and Choctaw Chief Green McCurtain calling for a constitutional convention that August. The convention met in Muskogee, on August 21, 1905. The new state was to be named for the Cherokee statesman Sequoyah, who invented the tribe&#x27;s written language. General Pleasant Porter, Principal Chief of the Creek Nation, was selected as president of the convention, while Creek journalist Alexander Posey served as Secretary. The elected delegates decided that the executive officers of the Five Civilized Tribes would also be appointed as vice-presidents of the convention. These were:

* William C. Rogers, Principal Chief of the Cherokees
* Green McCurtain, Principal Chief of the Choctaws
* John Brown, Principal Chief of the Seminoles
* Charles N. Haskell, a non-Native selected to represent the Creeks (as General Porter had been elected president) 
* William H. Murray, an intermarried white appointed by Chickasaw Governor Douglas H. Johnston (who opposed the convention) to represent the Chickasaws

The convention, which met as a whole on August 21 and 22 and September 5 to 8, during which over 150 delegates drafted a constitution, drew up a plan of organization for the government, put together a map showing the counties to be established (such as Hitchcock and Pushmataha), and elected delegates to go to the United States Congress to petition for statehood, along with 2 Democrats and 2 Republicans who were to serve as congressmen. As the convention closed, Chief Porter made a final impassioned appeal for Sequoyah Statehood:

Single-state supporters and Indian nation leaders pressed the campaign in the weeks leading to the November 7, 1905, election, with the legislatures of each of the Five Tribes endorsing the measure. A month before the scheduled vote, The New York Times cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election. However, on Election Day, voters in the territory approved the constitution and statehood petition by 56,279 in favor to 9,073 against. Following this success, Porter, Posey, Haskell, Murray, and the four congressmen brought the proposed constitution to Washington, D.C. to lobby for its passage. Republicans Arthur P. Murphy of Missouri and Porter James McCumber of North Dakota introduced statehood bills to the House and Senate, respectively. Murray, however, known for his eccentricities and political astuteness, predicted their efforts would fail:

== Annexation ==

Congress, however, did not support statehood for Sequoyah. President Theodore Roosevelt, long a proponent of annexation, spoke plainly in his Fifth Annual Message to Congress on December 5, 1905:

Roosevelt proposed a &quot;compromise&quot; that would join Indian Territory with Oklahoma Territory to form a single state and resulted in passage of the Oklahoma Enabling Act, which he signed June 16, 1906.

Although the State of Sequoyah never came into existence, its constitution made an important contribution to Oklahoma history as it formed the majority of the later Oklahoma Constitution. The delegates who wrote it, including Haskell and Murray, shared an underlying populist distrust of elected officials. The convention also catapulted Haskell, Murray, and others further into the public arena, securing for Indian Territory a solid seat at the debate at the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention. Oklahoma became the 46th state on November 16, 1907, with Haskell as its first Governor and Murray as its first House Speaker.

== Aftermath ==

Following Oklahoma statehood, Haskell and Murray had segregation enshrined into law. The five tribes, diminished in power, faced further marginalization and discrimination, both racially and politically during the first half of the twentieth century. Termination efforts continued against them until 1970, when Richard Nixon repealed the Termination Act of 1959. Following this, the tribes began to elect their own chiefs and governments independent of federal oversight, and built separate agreements with the state government in Oklahoma City to protect their autonomy.

On July 9, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States determined in &quot;McGirt v. Oklahoma&quot; that the reservations of the Five Tribes, comprising much of Eastern Oklahoma, were never disestablished by Congress and thus are still &quot;Indian Country&quot; for the purposes of criminal law. In late 2024, Sac and Fox writer and professor Donald Fixico theorized that the Five Tribes could revive the Sequoyah Movement for separate statehood following the &quot;McGirt&quot; decision.

== In fiction ==
In the &quot;Southern Victory&quot; series by Harry Turtledove, Indian Territory is annexed by the Confederate States in 1862, later becoming the State of Sequoyah, where the Five Civilized Tribes are granted autonomy and special protections, similar to the historical Sequoyah proposal. After the state is annexed by the United States following the First Great War, a failed plebiscite to return the state to the Confederacy serves as a casus belli for the Second Great War.

<doc id="1008594" wikidata="Q1734331" url="?curid=1008594" title="Wisconsin Central Railway (1897–1954)">
<text>The Wisconsin Central Railway Company was created in 1897 when the Wisconsin Central Railroad (1871–99) was reorganized from bankruptcy. In 1954, it reverted to the name Wisconsin Central Railroad Company. The railroad was merged into the Soo Line Railroad in 1961.

==History==

After a proposed merger with Northern Pacific Railway fell through in 1908, Wisconsin Central was leased by the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad, the &quot;Old&quot; Soo Line, in 1909. Controlling interest in the Soo Line, along with Wisconsin Central, was held by the Canadian Pacific Railway. Wisconsin Central entered receivership in 1932, declared bankruptcy in 1944, and finally re-emerged from administration in 1954 as the Wisconsin Central Railroad. It was entirely merged into the new Soo Line Railroad in 1961, which acquired the Milwaukee Road in 1985 and was absorbed into the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1990.

<doc id="1008600" wikidata="Q661264" url="?curid=1008600" title="HMAS Perth (D29)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Perth was one of three [[Leander-class cruiser (1931)|modified &quot;Leander&quot;-class]] [[light cruiser]]s used by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) during the early part of [[World War II]]. She was built for the [[Royal Navy]] (RN) in the mid-1930s and was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] asHMS &quot;Amphion in 1936. The ship spent the next several years as flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Africa before she was transferred to the RAN in 1939 and renamed as HMAS &quot;Perth&quot;.

At the start of World War II in September, the ship patrolled the Western Atlantic and the Caribbean in search of German shipping and escorting convoys for six months before she was ordered home in early 1940. The ship continued the same types of duties in Australian waters before she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1940. &quot;Perth&quot; then helped to escort numerous convoys to Malta in early 1941 and played a minor role in the Battle of Cape Matapan in March. She escorted convoys to Greece and Crete and helped to evacuate Allied troops from both places in the face of the victorious Axis forces. The ship was badly damaged by Axis aircraft in May during the evacuation of Crete.

After repairs were completed in June, &quot;Perth&quot; provided naval gunfire support to Allied forces ashore during the Syria-Lebanon Campaign and bombarded Vichy French targets. She returned to Australia in mid-1941 and was tasked with the same sorts of missions as she had been performing at the beginning of the war. The ship continued to perform these tasks after the start of the Pacific War in December until she was transferred to the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command in February 1942 to help defend the Dutch East Indies against the Japanese. &quot;Perth&quot; was not damaged during the Battle of the Java Sea, but was torpedoed and sunk by the Imperial Japanese Navy at the Battle of Sunda Strait immediately afterwards.

Over half her crew was killed in the battle and only about two-thirds of the survivors survived captivity to return home after the war. The ship&#x27;s wreck was discovered in 1967 and was essentially intact; by 2013 the wreck had been partially stripped by unauthorised Indonesian marine salvagers and was in even worse condition four years later.

==Design and description==
The design of the &quot;Leander&quot;-class cruisers was adapted for the 1932–1933 Naval Programme to separate their propulsion machinery arranged into separate units. This was intended to improve their survivability as each unit of paired boilers and steam turbines could operate independently and a single hit could not immobilise the ship. As built &quot;Amphion&quot; had an overall length of , a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. The ship displaced at standard load and at deep load. This gave her a metacentric height of at deep load. Her crew numbered 36 officers and 586 ratings.

The modified &quot;Leander&quot;s were powered by four Parsons geared turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by four Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines, rated at , were intended to give the ships a maximum speed of The unit system necessarily meant that each machinery unit had its own funnel. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at .

===Armament and protection===

The main battery of the Modified &quot;Leander&quot; class consisted of eight BL Mk XXIII guns arranged in two pairs of superfiring twin-gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. Their secondary armament consisted of four QF Mk V guns in open single mounts abreast the aft funnel. For short-range air defence, the ship was fitted with three quadruple mounts for Vickers AA machineguns. They were also armed with eight torpedo tubes in two above-water quadruple mounts, one on each broadside.

Most of the armour protecting parts of the ship consisted of non-cemented armour. The machinery spaces were protected by a waterline belt and the deck above them consisted of of high-tensile steel. The sides of the magazines consisted of armour plates and their roofs were protected by plates. The gun turrets had thick sides and roofs.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Amphion&quot; was originally ordered for the RN as part of the 1931–1932 Naval Programme, but the order was suspended until the design of the Modified &quot;Leander&quot; class was finished. The ship was laid down at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth on 26 June 1933 and was launched by the Marchioness of Titchfield on 27 July 1934. &quot;Amphion&quot; was commissioned on 15 June 1936 and was completed on 6 July. The cruiser served as the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Africa and the 6th Cruiser Squadron (Vice-Admiral Sir Francis Tottenham) from 1936 to 1938.

In early 1939 the ship was refitted and her Mk V four-inch guns were replaced by four twin-gun mounts for QF four-inch Mk XVI dual-purpose guns. The base for a rotating aircraft catapult and its associated crane were also installed.

===Australian service===
&quot;Amphion&quot; was sold to the RAN and was commissioned into service on 29 June 1939. She was renamed HMAS &quot;Perth&quot; on 10 July by Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. On entry into Australian service, the ship&#x27;s company stood at 646 (35 officers and 611 ratings). Most of the ship&#x27;s company had departed Australia in May 1939 aboard : the enlisted men had to live and sleep in the ship&#x27;s livestock holds. In early August, while en route to Australia, &quot;Perth&quot; was used to represent her nation at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. While at New York City, there was a minor &quot;mutiny&quot; aboard. The cause was orders that sailors ashore for shore leave would have to return to the ship at 18:00 and change from white uniforms to blue uniforms, although the overall treatment of the sailors by the officers had been an issue since the cruiser was taken over by the RAN. Over 60 sailors gathered on the ship&#x27;s forecastle, where they were confronted by officers with side arms (the first time RAN officers had been armed to deal with a mutiny) and were ordered below decks, but they refused. The warship&#x27;s commanding officer, Captain Harold Farncomb, next approached the sailors and informed them that if they did not follow orders to disperse, he would treat their actions as a mutiny. The standoff could be seen from the wharfside, and a heavily armed force from the New York City Police Department was dispatched but did not intervene. Farncomb successfully defused the situation by making the offer that any sailor wanting to wear blue uniform all day ashore could do so after asking permission; an offer taken up by almost every sailor taking shore leave.

===World War II===

While still en route to Australia, &quot;Perth&quot; was steaming off the coast of Venezuela when World War II began. As she was initially the only British Commonwealth warship in the Caribbean and western Atlantic, the cruiser began searching the region for German shipping and escorting convoys. &quot;Perth&quot; did not leave the area until March 1940, sailing via the Panama Canal to reach Australian waters for the first time on 31 March. On arrival, &quot;Perth&quot; was refitted at Sydney&#x27;s Garden Island Naval Base until 29 April, during which her catapult was installed. She initially carried a Supermarine Seagull V, later a Supermarine Walrus. The ship was assigned to convoy escort duty and patrols along the Australian coasts in May. On 6 June Captain Sir Philip Bowyer-Smyth, Bt. assumed command of &quot;Perth&quot; and Rear-Admiral John Crace hoisted his flag aboard the cruiser as commander of the Australian Squadron. These duties continued through November 1940, when she was sent to the Mediterranean to relieve her sister ship . Escorting a troop convoy from Australia to the Red Sea en route, &quot;Perth&quot; reached Alexandria, Egypt, on 24 December, after a short spell of escort duty in the Red Sea. She was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet.

During Operation Excess in early January 1941, the ship escorted a convoy from Malta to Alexandria along with other elements of the Mediterranean Fleet. While docked in Grand Harbour, Malta, on 16 January, &quot;Perth&quot; was damaged by a near-miss from a bomb that temporarily knocked out her power and caused some flooding. During the bombing, her crew helped to put out the fire aboard the ammunition ship and rendered assistance to the damaged aircraft carrier . The cruiser departed Malta that evening and reached Alexandria on the 18th where she entered the dockyard for temporary repairs. On 22 January she departed to rendezvous with &quot;Illustrious&quot; and escort her to Alexandria and then returned to Greece where she patrolled the sea between Crete and Piraeus, Greece. While returning to Alexandria for more permanent repairs, &quot;Perth&quot; encountered a severe sandstorm while approaching the harbour on the night of 6/7 February, only to find out that the ship was going to be inspected by the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies, the following morning and thus had to be cleaned before his arrival.
The ship entered the floating drydock on 9 February and remained there for 10 days. During this time, her catapult was removed and replaced by a pair of captured Italian Breda AA guns, one on each side of the catapult mount. In addition, a non-rotating Type 286 search radar was installed. On the morning of the 27th, she was one of the escorts for destroyers carrying reinforcements for Operation Abstention, the attack on the island of Kastellorizo, off the Turkish coast in the Italian Dodecanese Islands. Arriving there that night, the British ships found that the Italians had reinforced their garrison; after landing the reinforcements, the army commanders decided to evacuate the island as they were outnumbered by the garrison.

===Battle of Greece===
Beginning on 7 March, &quot;Perth&quot; supported the Allied reinforcement of Greece by transporting soldiers from Alexandria to Piraeus along with patrolling the waters between Greece and Crete. On 17–24 March she escorted another convoy to Malta. &quot;Perth&quot; played a minor role in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 26–29 March as her squadron was spotted by the Italian fleet and pursued as they retreated towards the main body of the British fleet. Undamaged during the battle, she resumed her previous duties. Sometime in April, the ship was fitted with a quadruple 2-pounder () Mk VIII &quot;pom-pom&quot; AA gun mounted on the catapult base. She escorted a convoy to Malta during 18–20 April and on the return journey, she covered the battleships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they bombarded Tripoli Harbour, in Italian Libya, on the morning of 21 April. On 25 April the ship was assigned to help in the evacuation of Allied troops from Greece. The troops and refugees were loaded at night to minimise the ability of the Axis forces to interfere with them and the ships had strict orders to depart in time to be well away from the coast by dawn, even if troops remained ashore. On the night of 28/29 April, Bowyer-Smyth was in charge of the force sent to evacuate troops from Kalamata. He sent a destroyer forward to reconnoitre the situation in the port while his other ships remained offshore. When the destroyer reported fighting in the harbour, he decided that it was not worth risking his ships being silhouetted again the fires and explosions in the port and ordered a return to Crete. By the time that the destroyer was able to report that the harbour had been secured, Bowyer-Smyth felt it was too late to return.

The cruiser was one of the escorts for the Tiger Convoy between Malta and Alexandria in early May. When the Germans invaded Crete on 20 May, &quot;Perth&quot; was part of Force C that consisted of two cruisers and four destroyers, patrolling in the vicinity of the Kasos Strait, northeast of Crete. The following day they were repeatedly attacked by German and Italian aircraft that sank one of the destroyers. Now assigned to Force D, &quot;Perth&quot; and her consorts intercepted a German invasion convoy of small ships on the morning of the 22nd, escorted by the Italian torpedo boat . &quot;Perth&quot; sank a straggler from another convoy before the main convoy was spotted at 08:47. The torpedo boat had been trying to collect stragglers and her commander ordered his convoy to disperse while he laid a smokescreen and then engaged the Allied ships with little effect. His diversion and the lack of visibility caused by his smokescreen, coupled with repeated aerial attacks that peppered the ships with shrapnel, allowed the convoy to escape with only the loss of two ships. Upon her return to Alexandria, &quot;Perth&quot; spent a few days under repair.

On the evening of 28 May, the ship was assigned to Force D, three cruisers, three destroyers and a troopship, which was sent to evacuate soldiers from Sphakia, a small port on the southern coast of Crete, after their defeat by German paratroopers. &quot;Perth&quot; carried two small landing craft to ferry troops aboard. The Allied ships were not attacked during the following day as they embarked the soldiers and they departed before dawn on the 30th. Beginning at 09:30 Force D was repeatedly attacked by German aircraft, with &quot;Perth&quot; suffering several near-misses before being struck by a bomb which exploded in the forward boiler room shortly before 10:00 with 4 of her sailors and 9 of the 1,188 embarked soldiers killed. The explosion temporarily knocked out her power and the cruiser came to a halt before it could be restored a half-hour later. It also bent the starboard inner propeller shaft and badly damaged the galley, the high-angle fire-control computer, the Admiralty Fire Control Table for the six-inch guns and started many leaks in the hull plating.

The cruiser was able to reach Alexandria the next day and was under repair until 22 June. &quot;Perth&quot; sailed for Haifa, British Palestine, three days later to participate in the invasion of Vichy Syria and Lebanon. On the 27th she helped to lay a minefield off Damour and then provided gunfire support to Allied forces and bombarding Vichy facilities through to the end of the campaign before returning to Alexandria on 15 July. While she was waiting to be relieved by her sister , the quadruple &quot;pom-pom&quot; and the two Breda guns were removed and her catapult was reinstalled.

===Return to the Pacific Ocean===
&quot;Perth&quot; returned to Australia for permanent repairs, arriving in Sydney on 12 August. The release of her crew for shore leave was delayed by a speech from Menzies that same day that was not well-received. In addition to the required repairs, the Type 286 radar was removed and two quadruple 0.5-inch machinegun mounts were reinstalled on her quarterdeck. She also probably received four 20-millimetre Oerlikon AA guns in single mounts installed on the superfiring turrets&#x27; roofs and in the superstructure near the bridge. Bowyer-Smith was relieved of his command and sent back to Britain on 1 September and Captain Hector Waller assumed command on 24 October. Completion of the refit at Cockatoo Island was delayed by a month after a fire melted the electrical cables leading to the director-control tower on the roof of the bridge; on 24 November the ship conducted her full-power sea trials. After the refit&#x27;s completion, &quot;Perth&quot; and the heavy cruiser steamed on 12 December from Sydney to Brisbane. Three days later, they met with the light cruiser , and formed up as the heavy escort for the Pensacola Convoy. &quot;Perth&quot; continued convoy escort duties in home waters until the end of January 1942.
&quot;Perth&quot; was scheduled to remain in eastern home waters within the ANZAC Area while the &quot;Canberra&quot; underwent refit. The War Cabinet agreed to meet a request by the United States for deployment of &quot;Perth&quot; to the American-British-Dutch-Australian (ABDA) Area immediately and, in doing so, escort a convoy proceeding to ABDA. On 31 January &quot;Perth&quot; sailed from Sydney, reaching Fremantle, Australia, on 10 February and relieved the old light cruiser on 15 February as escort for the convoy of four empty oil tankers and two cargo vessels on a mission to claim as much oil from the Dutch East Indies as possible before the Japanese invaded. After Singapore was captured (endangering the destination port of Palembang), all but &quot;Perth&quot; and the cargo vessel were ordered to return to Fremantle. Although joined en route by the Dutch ships and , the operation was cancelled on 21 February, when the ships were from the Sunda Strait, separating Java and Sumatra. &quot;Perth&quot; escorted the three other vessels back to within of Fremantle before turning north to join ABDA&#x27;s Western Strike Force. She arrived at Tanjung Priok, Java, on 24 February and was not damaged by a Japanese air raid later in the day.

====Battle of the Java Sea====

After a Dutch reconnaissance aircraft spotted the Japanese eastern invasion fleet on the 25th, heading to their landing site west of Surabaya, Java, &quot;Perth&quot;, together with the British heavy cruiser and destroyers , and , then proceeded to Surabaya, where they joined ABDA&#x27;s eastern strike force under Rear-Admiral Karel Doorman. The force now consisted of the heavy cruisers &quot;Exeter&quot; and , three light cruisers (Doorman&#x27;s flagship , and &quot;Perth&quot;), five modern destroyers (three British and two Dutch) and four elderly American destroyers. On the evening of the 26th, they sortied in an unsuccessful search for the Japanese ships.

The Japanese received reports that the Allied ships were near their planned route at 11:00 on the 27th. Their cruisers launched floatplanes to confirm these reports and they spotted Doorman&#x27;s ships heading east at 12:35. Five minutes later Doorman turned south to refuel in Surabaya. The Japanese observed this turn and they decided to continue with the landing at 13:40. Shortly after the Allied ships had passed through the minefield protecting the harbour entrance, Doorman received a report at 14:27 that the Japanese ships were northwest of Surabaya. He reversed course almost immediately intending to attack the convoy. The Japanese floatplanes observed his movements, despite attacks by Allied fighters at 14:18 and 14:30, and their report caught the invasion force widely separated as it prepared to conduct the landing that evening.

&quot;Electra&quot; spotted the Japanese light cruiser at 16:12 which turned southwest and opened fire at a range of shortly afterwards. The heavy cruiser , trailing far behind, opened fire at at 16:17. The Allied heavy cruisers returned &quot;Nachi&quot;″s fire three minutes later. At 16:21 Doorman turned slightly southwards to prevent the Japanese from crossing his &#x27;T&#x27; and Rear-Admiral Takeo Takagi, commander of the invasion escort force, turned slightly away to open up the range as the shooting on both sides had been accurate, although no hits were made. Doorman turned west southwest at 16:27 to better prevent his &#x27;T&#x27; from being crossed, a manoeuvre that kept the range too far for the Allied light cruisers to contribute their gunfire. Both Japanese destroyer squadrons were manoeuvring during this time to make torpedo attacks using their powerful Type 93 &quot;Long Lance&quot; torpedoes.

Both squadron flagships opened fire beginning at 16:30 with the destroyers of Rear Admiral Shoji Nishimura&#x27;s 4th Destroyer Squadron following between 16:40 and 16:45 at ranges from with a total of 31 torpedoes aimed at the Allied ships, all of which missed. &quot;Nachi&quot;″s sister contributed eight torpedoes at 16:52 at long range, which also missed. The gunfire duel continued while the torpedoes were being launched and &quot;Perth&quot; reported &quot;tight salvos landing around [the ship], first short, then 25 yards over&quot;. About ten minutes later, Takagi realised that the Allied ships were closing in on the invasion convoy&#x27;s route and he ordered an all-out attack to prevent them from reaching the convoy. About the same time, Doorman turned slightly northwards, closing the range. At 17:08, one of &quot;Haguro&quot;″s 203-millimetre shells struck &quot;Exeter&quot; at a distance of 22,000 yards, detonating inside one of her boiler rooms. The shell set the ship on fire and knocked six of her eight boilers offline, and cut her speed to 5 knots. The British cruiser fell out of formation and rapidly began to lose speed. The following cruisers assumed that this turn was deliberate and followed &quot;Exeter&quot;; once Waller realised that she had been crippled, he ordered &quot;Perth&quot; to circle her, laying a smokescreen to conceal her. &quot;Haguro&quot; then launched her torpedo battery again at 22,000 yards, with a single torpedo hitting the destroyer Kortenaer, which blew in half and sank.

Doorman needed some time to reorganise his forces and ordered &quot;Exeter&quot; to head back to Surabaya, escorted by the British destroyers and the surviving Dutch destroyer. The remaining ships laid copious amounts of smoke and circled around as the Japanese attempted to sink the crippled ship with torpedoes. The light cruisers were the first to fire at 17:50 and were followed by the heavy cruisers and the destroyers; a total of 98 torpedoes that all missed. Two of the British destroyers charged through the smoke in an attempt to disrupt the attacks, &quot;Electra&quot; being sunk in the manoeuvre, and the Allied cruisers took up a course parallel to &quot;Exeter&quot;″s. At 18:10 the American destroyers also charged out of the smoke and fired 24 of their torpedoes at &quot;Nachi&quot; and &quot;Haguro&quot;, all of which missed. By this time, Takagi could see the lighthouse at Surabaya and he decided to break contact in the gathering darkness lest any of his ships enter a minefield defending the port. At 18:12 &quot;Perth&quot; claimed a hit on &quot;Haguro&quot;, but postwar research showed that the cruiser was not damaged during the battle.

Doorman was determined to continue the battle and reversed course at 18:31 and his ships were spotted on their new course at 18:46. The Japanese ships were widely dispersed after their attacks and it took Takagi some time to organise them. In the meantime, Nishimura ordered the invasion convoy to turn westward at 19:04. After a brief engagement with &quot;Jintsū&quot;, Doorman decided to disengage and then circle around to the south and try to get behind the Japanese escorts at 21:00. The American destroyers, low on fuel and out of torpedoes, independently decided to return to Surabaya at that same time. As Doorman was turning his ships north at 21:25, &quot;Jupiter&quot; struck a Dutch mine and lost all power before sinking. During this time, Takagi was aware of Doorman&#x27;s movements as one of &quot;Jintsū&quot;″s floatplanes was dropping flares to track the Allied ships. At 21:20 &quot;Naka&quot;″s floatplane relieved it, but it lost contact with Takagi at 22:00 which left both sides searching blindly.

At 23:02 &quot;Nachi&quot;″s lookouts spotted the Allied cruisers and the sisters manoeuvred to deliver a torpedo attack. Doorman&#x27;s ships spotted the Japanese cruisers about the same time and they opened fire at 23:10. &quot;Nachi&quot; fired her torpedo battery, and it was one of these torpedoes that struck &quot;Java&quot;, which broke in half and sank. Meanwhile, &quot;Haguro&quot; followed up with her torpedo battery, one of which hit &quot;De Ruyter&quot;, which sank to progressive flooding over three hours. &quot;Perth&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot; were the only large Allied ships to survive the battle, and they withdrew to Tanjung Priok afterwards on the morning of 28 February. The two ships attempted to resupply, but fuel shortages meant that &quot;Perth&quot; could only load half her normal fuel capacity, and a lack of ammunition left her with only the 160 six-inch shells remaining after the previous day. The cruisers and the Dutch destroyer were ordered to sail for Tjilatjap via the Sunda Strait that night.

====Battle of Sunda Strait====

&quot;Perth&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot; sailed at 19:00 (&quot;Evertsen&quot; was delayed), low on fuel and ammunition, with &quot;Perth&quot; leading as Waller was in overall command as the senior officer present. The Allies believed that Sunda Strait was free of enemy vessels, but the Japanese western invasion force had assembled at Bantam Bay on the northwestern tip of Java without their knowledge. The cruisers were heading west when they were spotted at 22:39 by the destroyer on patrol east of the bay at a range of . After reporting to Rear Admiral Kenzaburo Hara, commander of the escort force, the destroyer trailed the Allied ships. Hara&#x27;s flagship, the light cruiser , saw them at 22:48 at a range of ; Hara concluded that the silhouettes were enemy cruisers at 22:59 and intended to use &quot;Natori&quot; as bait to lure &quot;Perth&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot; away from the transports.

At 23:06 lookouts on &quot;Perth&quot; sighted an unidentified ship and challenged it, expecting to see one of the Australian corvettes supposedly on station. When an unintelligible reply was received in return and the ship turned away and made smoke, Waller recognised the silhouette of a Japanese destroyer (), turned north to follow and opened fire at 23:15. &quot;Fubuki&quot; was behind &quot;Houston&quot; when the Allied ships turned north and she fired nine older 61-centimetre Type 90 torpedoes as she turned in pursuit as well as 16 rounds from her guns; all of which missed. Realizing that Waller was reacting to the nearby destroyer movements, Hara cancelled his plan when Waller opened fire and summoned all of his ships to attack. &quot;Harukaze&quot;″s sister was the first to close firing her guns at &quot;Perth&quot; before she turned northeast at 23:38. The cruiser was struck twice by light shells, once at 23:26 and again six minutes later, but was only slightly damaged.

Shortly before 23:40, the destroyers and closed to before emptying all nine of their torpedo tubes and turning away under the cover of smoke. &quot;Perth&quot; hit the latter&#x27;s bridge with a six-inch shell, killing 1 man and wounding 11 more. None of these torpedoes hit their targets and Waller&#x27;s ships continued to loop around to the south and west. &quot;Harukaze&quot;, &quot;Hatakaze&quot; and their sister closed to attack, although the former ship was struck at least three times by Allied shells that killed three men and wounded 15. She was forced to fall out of formation and &quot;Hatakaze&quot; could not fire because of the frequent near-misses surrounding the cruisers. &quot;Asakaze&quot; was able to fire her six torpedoes, but they missed as well. At 23:44 &quot;Natori&quot; engaged &quot;Perth&quot; with 29 shells from her guns and fired four torpedoes with no known effect before turning away two minutes later. By this time, the destroyers were no longer in the line of fire of the heavy cruisers and her sister which targeted &quot;Perth&quot; with six torpedoes each at a range of at 23:49, none of which hit their target. About this time &quot;Perth&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot; began shooting at the Japanese heavy cruisers, but consistently shot ahead of them, possibly because both ships were streaming paravanes which increased the size their bow waves and made the Allied ships overestimate their speed. &quot;Perth&quot; received an inconsequential hit around 23:50.

After reversing course and slightly closing the range, &quot;Mogami&quot; and &quot;Mikuma&quot; opened fire at &quot;Houston&quot; with their main guns at a range of at 23:52 using their searchlights. Three minutes later the Allied ship hit &quot;Mikuma&quot;, killing six and wounding eleven men. With &quot;Perth&quot; down to firing practice rounds, &quot;Harukaze&quot; and &quot;Hatakaze&quot; closed in to before firing eleven torpedoes between them during 23:56–23:58. Two minutes later the destroyers and fired nine apiece at and &quot;Natori&quot; contributed four more at . About this time, a near-miss damaged the propeller of the Japanese destroyer , which was escorting the heavy cruisers.

At 00:05 five of &quot;Mogami&quot;″s torpedoes that had missed &quot;Perth&quot; struck and sank four transports and blew a minesweeper in half. About this time, Waller ordered his ship to try to force a way through to the Sunda Strait. Just as &quot;Perth&quot; settled on her new heading, she was hit by a torpedo in the forward engine room, probably from &quot;Harukaze&quot;. A second torpedo hit two minutes later that punched a hole in the hull near the bridge and two others followed shortly after, probably from &quot;Shirakumo&quot; and &quot;Mirakumo&quot;. Waller gave the order to abandon ship after the second torpedo impact. After some further close-range fire from the destroyers, &quot;Perth&quot; &quot;capsized&quot; to port and sank at 00:25 on 1 March 1942, with 353 killed: 342 RAN (including Waller), 5 Royal Navy, 3 Royal Australian Air Force, and 3 civilian canteen workers. &quot;Houston&quot; was torpedoed and sank about 20 minutes later. Of the 328 survivors, 5 died after reaching shore, while the rest became prisoners of war; 106 died during their internment: 105 naval and 1 RAAF, including 38 killed by Allied attacks on Japanese &quot;hell ships&quot;. The surviving 218 were repatriated after the war.

===Unauthorised salvage===
The wreck was discovered by David Burchell in 1967; at the time, the ship was reasonably intact, lying on its side at a depth of about . In late 2013, divers found that the wreck of &quot;Perth&quot; was being stripped by unauthorised Indonesian marine salvagers. Reports in September indicated that crane-equipped barges had stripped off most of the wreck&#x27;s superstructure, forward turrets, and forward decking, and that explosives had been used to break the ship up for easier recovery. These actions compromised the structural integrity of the wreck site, and have potentially exposed live munitions and oil tanks. &quot;Perth&quot;″s wreck is not protected as a war grave, either through the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage (Australia and Indonesia are not signatories to the treaty) or through legislation in either nation. The stripping of &quot;Perth&quot;″s wreck was not publicly reported until December 2013; the Australian Broadcasting Corporation speculated that the government departments made aware of the issue tried to keep it under wraps to avoid further deterioration of relations between Australia and Indonesia, particularly following the Australia–Indonesia spying scandal.

In October 2015, United States Navy and Indonesian Navy divers embarked aboard undertook a nine-day survey of &quot;Perth&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot;. Divers documented the condition of the two shipwrecks, and identified signs of unauthorised salvage. The operation was a prelude to a conference in Jakarta on preserving and preventing the unauthorised salvage of wartime shipwrecks in the Java Sea.

The wreck was surveyed by a team from the Australian National Maritime Museum, the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries and the Indonesian National Research Centre for Archaeology (ARKENAS) in May 2017. As of that date, the ship&#x27;s six-inch gun turrets, starboard-side armour belt and its associated hull plating and the propellers had all been removed, as had almost all of the propulsion machinery, most likely because it is low-background steel. &quot;ARKENAS has proposed that the site be declared a Situs Cagar Budaya (Cultural Heritage Site) under Indonesian cultural heritage legislation, while the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries also intends to list the site as a Marine Conservation Zone.&quot;

==Legacy==
The cruiser&#x27;s wartime service was later recognised with the battle honours &quot;Atlantic 1939&quot;, &quot;Malta Convoys 1941&quot;, &quot;Matapan 1941&quot;, &quot;Greece 1941&quot;, &quot;Crete 1941&quot;, &quot;Mediterranean 1941&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1941–42&quot;, and &quot;Sunda Strait 1942&quot;. The RAN named a submarine, , after Captain Waller.

The HMAS &quot;Perth&quot; Memorial Regatta is held annually by the Nedlands Yacht Club, Perth, in honour of Waller, the crew, and the ship. The original ships&#x27; bells of the cruiser &quot;Perth&quot; and the Cold War-era destroyer of the same name are displayed at the Perth Town Hall. There is a memorial plaque in St John&#x27;s Anglican Church, King&#x27;s Square, Fremantle, and a memorial service is held annually in the church in late February.

HMAS &quot;Perth&quot; is the only foreign warship commemorated in the grounds of Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, VA.

<text>The Georgia national football team () represents Georgia in men&#x27;s international football matches, and is controlled by the Georgian Football Federation, the governing body for football in Georgia. It is a member of UEFA in Europe and FIFA in global competitions. 

The Georgian team&#x27;s first match took place on 27 May 1990 against Lithuania, while Georgia was still part of the Soviet Union. The team have attempted to qualify for each major tournament from Euro 1996 onwards. Their efforts culminated in their first successful qualification for a major tournament, the UEFA Euro 2024, secured with a win against Greece in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying play-off final.

The team is colloquially referred to as Jvarosnebi (The Crusaders) and has adopted Saint George as their symbol, which is a patron of Georgia.

Upon its admission into FIFA ranked 156th, Georgia ascended to their peak World Ranking of 42nd in 1998. The team plays their home games at the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena in Tbilisi.

==History==
=== 20th century ===
Football was introduced to Georgia by English sailors in early 20th century. British ships that docked at the harbors of Poti and Batumi frequently hosted football matches among their crew, attracting the attention of Lelo burti players, who quickly embraced and adapted the sport. While the exact date of the first football match in Georgia remains uncertain, football was first mentioned in the Georgian press in 1890.

From 1923 to 1990, Georgian football players were part of the USSR national team, with two of them, Murtaz Khurtsilava and Aleksandre Chivadze, serving as captains at different times. During the early Soviet era, Georgia competed in the Trans-Caucasian Championship, hosting the 1926 edition. Georgia&#x27;s first game came against Azerbaijan in Tbilisi, losing 4–2 in Tbilisi. The Georgian SSR&#x27;s first win came in their second game, beating Armenia 7–0. Georgia would later host the 1927 and 1928 editions of the Trans-Caucasian Championship, winning the latter edition after a 5–1 and 6–0 win over Armenia and Azerbaijan respectively. After a six year hiatus, Georgia played in the 1934 competition in Azerbaijan, before once against hosting the 1935 Trans-Caucasian Championship, winning it once again.

During this period, the USSR national team included players from various Soviet republics, including Georgian SSR. Georgian players made significant contributions to the team, with several becoming key figures and achieving notable success, such as Slava Metreveli scoring in the 1960 European Nations&#x27; Cup final. One of the most famous Georgian footballers who played for the USSR national team was Murtaz Khurtsilava, who captained the team and played a crucial role in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, where the USSR finished in fourth place. Another prominent player was Vitaly Daraselia, known for his performances in the 1980s, along with David Kipiani.

Following Soviet rule in Georgia, the contemporary history of the Georgia national football team began in 1990, when the team played their first international match against Lithuania, the first country to accept an invitation. The match was held on 27 May 1990 at the national stadium. Georgia were coached by Givi Nodia. The friendly match ended in a 2–2 draw. This was the only match prior to the declaration of independence on 9 April 1991. Soon afterwards the team played another friendly match against Moldova.

The Georgian Football Federation became a member of both UEFA and FIFA in 1992, enabling Georgia to play competitive matches. The first of these came in September 1994, a 1–0 defeat to Moldova as part of the qualifiers for Euro 1996. Georgia finished third in their group, ahead of Moldova, Wales and Albania, but seven points behind second-placed qualifier Bulgaria.

Georgia failed to qualify for the 1998 World Cup in France, obtaining 10 points and finishing in fourth place, level on points with Poland. At this time Georgia reached 42nd place in the FIFA World Ranking. 

=== 21st century ===
During UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying the Georgia national team won one match, drew two and finished at the bottom of the group with five points.

The team finished fifth (and last) with seven points in their qualifying group for Euro 2004, although they defeated Russia with a goal scored by Malkhaz Asatiani.

In the 2006 World Cup qualifiers Georgia beat Albania 2–0 at home and Kazakhstan away 2–1. They finished sixth of seven with ten points in Group 2.

Georgia were sixth out of seven teams in the Euro 2008 qualifying group with ten points. They defeated Scotland 2–0 at home and the Faroe Islands 6–0 away and 3–1 at home.

Héctor Cúper became the manager of Georgia in August 2008. During the qualification round for the 2010 FIFA World Cup Georgia failed to win any matches and finished sixth (and last) with three points. Cuper didn&#x27;t extend his contract, and on 6 November 2009, Temur Ketsbaia was appointed as the new manager of the Georgian national team. Ketsbaia resigned as manager after a 4–0 defeat at home to Poland in the Euro 2016 qualifiers on 14 November 2014, having previously stated he would do so before the match regardless of the result.

In June 2016, Georgia beat the two-time reigning European champions Spain 1–0 in their final pre-Euro 2016 friendly.

In 2018, they were the first team to earn promotion in the new UEFA Nations League. They scored the event&#x27;s first goal in a UEFA Nations League D game in Kazakhstan before beating Latvia twice and Andorra, with two games still to spare and earned their first-ever playoff berth. In the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying, Georgia had a disappointing run, with their only two wins came over Gibraltar. In the Path D playoff semi-final, Georgia managed to beat Belarus 1–0 and thus the hope to qualify for UEFA Euro 2020 increased, but it went in vain after the Georgians suffered a heartbreaking home defeat to North Macedonia in the decisive match and thus missed the opportunity to make a historic debut in a major competition.Georgia showed improvements with a strong 2–0 win over Sweden at the 2022 World Cup qualification on 11 November 2021. They continued their improvement by winning the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League C Group 4, getting promoted to 2024-25 UEFA Nations League B, and qualified for their second-ever play-off berth. Georgia won 2–0 against Luxembourg, earning them a spot in the final of the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying play-offs. They defeated Greece 4–2 on penalties after a 0–0 draw in the playoff final, which guaranteed Georgia&#x27;s qualification for their first ever international tournament at Euro 2024. 

During Euro 2024, Georgia were placed in Group F; they subsequently lost 3–1 in the match against Turkey, where Georges Mikautadze scored the first-ever goal in Georgia&#x27;s history in the Euros, and drew 1–1 against the Czech Republic. Their 2–0 victory against Portugal was considered one of the biggest upsets in European Championship history, and was enough to propel Georgia to the round of 16 in their first international tournament appearance. Georgia subsequently played eventual Champions Spain in the Round of 16, and lost by a score of 4–1.
Georgia&#x27;s Georges Mikautadze finished the Euro 2024 campaign as the joint-UEFA European Football Championship Top Goalscorer.

<text>Hovhannes Tumanyan (, classical spelling: Յովհաննէս Թումանեան,  – March 23, 1923) was an Armenian poet, writer, translator, and literary and public activist. He is the national poet of Armenia.

Tumanyan wrote poems, quatrains, ballads, novels, fables, and critical and journalistic articles. His works were mostly written in the style of realism, frequently revolving around the everyday life of his time. Born in the historical village of Dsegh in the Lori region, at a young age Tumanyan moved to Tiflis, which was the centre of Armenian culture under the Russian Empire during the 19th and early 20th centuries. He soon became known to the wide Armenian society for his simple but very poetic works.

Many films and animated films have been adapted from Tumanyan&#x27;s works. Two operas, &quot;Anush&quot; (1912) by Armen Tigranian and &quot;Almast&quot; (1930) by Alexander Spendiaryan, were written based on his works.

==Biography==


Hovhannes Tumanyan was born on February 19, 1869, in the village of Dsegh, Tiflis Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Lori Province, Armenia).

His father, Aslan (1839–1898), was the village priest known as Ter-Tadevos. He was an offspring of an Armenian princely family of Tumanyan, branch of the famous royal house of Mamikonian that settled in Lori in 10th and 11th centuries from their original feudal fief of Taron.

His mother, Sona (1842–1936), was an avid storyteller with a particular interest in fables. Young Tumanyan was the oldest of eight children; his siblings were Rostom (1871–1915), Osan (1874–1926), Iskuhi (1878–1943), Vahan (1881–1937), Astghik (1885–1953), Arshavir (1888–1921), Artashes (1892–1916).

From 1877 to 1879, Tumanyan attended the parochial school of Dsegh. From 1879 to 1883 he went to a school in Jalaloghly. Tumanyan moved to Tiflis in 1883, where he attended the Nersisyan School from 1883 to 1887. Tumanyan&#x27;s wrote his first poem at the age of 12, while studying in Jalaloghly school. He lived at the teacher&#x27;s house for a while and fell in love with the teacher&#x27;s daughter Vergine. Since 1893, Tumanyan worked for &quot;Aghbyur&quot;, &quot;Murtch&quot;, &quot;Hasker&quot; and &quot;Horizon&quot; periodicals and also was engaged in public activism.

In 1899, Tumanyan came up with an idea of organizing meetings of Armenian intellectuals of the time at his house on 44 Bebutov Street in Tiflis (present-day Amaghleba 18, in Sololaki). Soon it became an influential literary group, which often gathered in the garret of Tumanyan&#x27;s house. Vernatun means garret in Armenian, which was the name the group was referred to. Prominent members of the collective were Avetik Isahakyan, Derenik Demirchyan, Levon Shant, Ghazaros Aghayan, Perch Proshyan, Nikol Aghbalian, Alexander Shirvanzade, Nar-Dos, Vrtanes Papazyan, Vahan Terian, Leo, Stepan Lisitsyan, Mariam Tumanyan, Gevorg Bashinjagyan and many other significant Armenian figures of early 20th century. With some pauses, it existed until 1908.

In 1912 Tumanyan was elected the president of the Company of Caucasus Armenian Writers.

In the fall of 1921, Tumanyan went to Constantinople to find support of Armenian refugees. After months spent there, he returned ill. After surgery in 1922, he started to get better. But in September, Tumanyan&#x27;s disease started to progress again. He was transferred to a hospital in Moscow, where he died on March 23, 1923.

In 1888, at the age of 19, Hovhannes Tumanyan married Olga Matchkalyan, age 17. They had 10 children: Musegh (1889–1938), Ashkhen (1891–1968), Nvard (1892–1957), Artavazd (1894–1918), Hamlik (1896–1937), Anush (1898–1927), Arpik (1899–1981), Areg (1900–1939), Seda (1905–1988), Tamar (1907–1989).

==Political and public activism==
During the government-provoked Armenian–Tatar massacres of 1905–1907, Tumanyan took the role of a peacemaker, for which he was arrested twice. Tumanyan also deeply criticized the Georgian–Armenian War of 1918. Tumanyan was also actively engaged in preaching the Gospel. As he put in one of his verses, &quot;There is only one way of salvation; through Jesus Christ abiding inside every one of us&quot;.

In October 1914 Tumanyan joined the &quot;Committee for Support of War Victims&quot;, which later helped Armenian Genocide refugees settled in Etchmiadzin.

In 1921 in Tiflis he founded the House of Armenian Art.

==Literary work==

Eduard Jrbashyan describes Tumanyan&#x27;s language as &quot;simple, natural and at the same time poetically inspired and beautiful.&quot; Many expressions from Tumanyan&#x27;s works have become common phrases and sayings in Armenian.

Tumanyan is usually regarded in Armenian circles as &quot;All-Armenian poet&quot;. He earned this title when the Catholicos of Armenia had ordered that Armenian refugees from the west not enter certain areas of his church and house, since he is considered to be &quot;The Catholicos of all Armenians&quot;. Tumanyan in response decried that decision claiming that the refugees could seek relief in the Catholicos&#x27; quarters under order of &quot;The Poet of all Armenians&quot;.

He created lyrics, fables, epic poems and translations into Armenian of Byron, Goethe and Pushkin.

Tumanyan&#x27;s most famous works include:

<doc id="1008622" wikidata="Q759716" url="?curid=1008622" title="Tanya Tagaq">
<text>Tanya Tagaq (Inuktitut syllabics: ᑕᓐᔭ ᑕᒐᖅ, born Tanya Tagaq Gillis, May 5, 1975), also credited as Tagaq, is a Canadian Inuk throat singer, songwriter, novelist, actor, and visual artist from Cambridge Bay (Iqaluktuuttiaq), Nunavut, Canada, on the south coast of Victoria Island.

==Early years==
At the age of 15, after attending school in Cambridge Bay, Tagaq went to Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, to attend Sir John Franklin High School where she first began to practice throat singing. During this time Tagaq, like most other students from the central Arctic lived at Akaitcho Hall, the residential facility for Sir John Franklin High School. She later studied visual arts at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design and while there developed her own solo form of Inuit throat singing, which is normally done by two women. Her decision to go solo was a pragmatic one: she did not have a singing partner.

== Career ==
Tagaq was a popular performer at Canadian folk festivals, such as Folk on the Rocks in 2005, and first became widely known both in Canada and internationally for her collaborations with Björk, including concert tours and the 2004 album &quot;Medúlla&quot;. She has also performed with the Kronos Quartet and Shooglenifty and has been featured on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network.

In 2005, her CD entitled &quot;Sinaa&quot; (Inuktitut for &quot;edge&quot;) was nominated for five awards at the Canadian Aboriginal Music Awards. At the ceremony on 25 October 2005, the CD won awards for Best Producer/Engineer, Best Album Design and Tagaq herself won the Best Female Artist award. &quot;Sinaa&quot; was nominated for the 2006 Juno Awards as the Best Aboriginal Recording.

Although primarily known for her throat singing, Tagaq is also an accomplished artist and her work was featured on the 2003 Northwestel telephone directory.

Her 2008 album &quot;Auk/Blood&quot; (&quot;ᐊᐅᒃ&quot; Inuktitut syllabics) features collaborations with Mike Patton, among others. In 2011, she released a live album titled &quot;Anuraaqtuq&quot;. It was recorded during Tagaq&#x27;s performance at the Festival International de Musique Actuelle in Victoriaville.

In 2012 Tagaq performed the theme music for the CBC television show &quot;Arctic Air&quot;.

Tagaq released her third album, &quot;Animism&quot;, on May 27, 2014, on Six Shooter Records. The album was a shortlisted nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize, her first nomination for that award, and won the $30,000 award on September 22, 2014. The album also won the Juno Award for Aboriginal Recording of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2015, and was nominated for Alternative Album of the Year.

Her fourth album &quot;Retribution&quot; was released in October 2016. Her show in Toronto in November was sold out.

In May 2018, Tagaq announced her first book, a blend of fiction and memoir titled &quot;Split Tooth&quot;, which was published in September 2018 by Penguin Random House. The book was named as a longlisted nominee for the 2018 Scotiabank Giller Prize and was shortlisted for the 2019 Amazon.ca First Novel Award.

Her fifth album &quot;Tongues,&quot; released in 2022, was inspired by &quot;Split Tooth&quot; and was recorded mostly before the COVID-19 pandemic with New York poet Saul Williams as producer, but the album was placed on hold for over a year. During that time, mixer Gonjasufi reworked the album to give it a &quot;grimier&quot; sound.

Tagaq appears in the fourth season of &quot;True Detective&quot;. This is her first performance as an actor.

In 2025 she is slated to appear in the television series &quot;North of North&quot;.

== Collaborations ==
In 2005, Tagaq collaborated with Okna Tsahan Zam, a Kalmyk Khoomei throat singer, and Wimme, a Sami yoiker from Finland, to release the recording &quot;Shaman Voices&quot;.

She began collaborating with the Kronos Quartet in 2005. Since then, they have performed together at venues across North America, from the January 2006 debut of the project &quot;Nunavut&quot; at the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts in Vancouver, British Columbia, through to the New York&#x27;s Spring for Music Festival at Carnegie Hall presentation of composer Derek Charke&#x27;s &quot;13 Inuit Throat Song Games&quot; (2014). In 2015, Tagaq was commissioned to write a piece for the Kronos Quartet&#x27;s &quot;Fifty for the Future&quot; project.

In 2012, Toronto International Film Festival commissioned Tagaq to create a live soundscape for &quot;Nanook of the North&quot;, as part of the festival&#x27;s film retrospective First Peoples Cinema: 1500 Nations, One Tradition. Tagaq collaborated with composer Derek Charke, percussionist Jean Martin and violinist Jesse Zubot, and the work was performed at the 2012 TIFF and Under the Radar Festival at New York&#x27;s Public Theater, 2016, amongst other places. Despite some of the film&#x27;s more stereotyped depictions of Inuit lives in 1922, Tagaq also found the film the perfect source material: &quot;There are moments in the movie where … my ancestors, they’re so amazing.&quot; She said to CBC news. &quot;They lived on the land and I just still can’t believe that. Growing up in Nunavut and just the harshness of the environment itself, the ability for people to be able to survive with no vegetation, and just the harshest of environments, it’s just incredible to me.&quot;

Tagaq collaborated with composer Christos Hatzis, author Joseph Boyden and the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra on the score for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet&#x27;s &quot;Going Home Star: Truth and Reconciliation&quot; (2015), which won a 2017 Juno Award for Classical Album of the Year – Large Ensemble.   

In 2017, Tagaq and fellow Polaris laureate Buffy Sainte-Marie collaborated on the single &quot;You Got to Run (Spirit of the Wind)&quot;, which appeared on Sainte-Marie&#x27;s album &quot;Medicine Songs&quot;. The song was inspired by George Attla, a champion dog sled racer from Alaska. Tagaq has also appeared as a guest vocalist on songs by July Talk (&quot;Beck + Call&quot;) and Weaves (&quot;Scream&quot;).

In 2022, Tagaq and Chelsea McMullan collaborated on the documentary film &quot;Ever Deadly&quot;.

== Activism ==
Tagaq is a vocal supporter of traditional Inuit sealing and Indigenous land rights.

In March 2014, Ellen DeGeneres donated $1.5 million to the Humane Society of the United States, an outspoken critic of the Canadian seal hunt. As a counter-response, people began posting &quot;sealfies&quot; — pictures of themselves wearing sealskin or eating seal meat.

As part of this viral media campaign, Tagaq posted a picture of her young daughter lying beside a dead seal on Twitter. The seal had been killed to feed a group of local elders and is an essential part of an Inuk diet, eaten by necessity and tradition. The image caused backlash by animal rights activists, who directed online abuse and threats towards Tagaq.

During her Polaris Music Prize acceptance speech, she encouraged people to wear and eat seal, and shouted, &quot;Fuck PETA&quot;, which enraged animal rights activists. Inuit have been arguing since the 1980s that any attack on the seal hunt is an attack on the Indigenous hunt, because it destroys the market for furs. Subsequently, Tagaq tweeted, &quot;I had a scrolling screen of 1200 missing and murdered indigenous women at the Polaris gala but people are losing their minds over seals.&quot; In 2016, Tagaq reported that she had been banned from Facebook for posting a photo of a sealskin coat.

The Aboriginal Peoples Television Network named Tagaq one of the 16 Indigenous &quot;movers and shakers to watch in 2016.&quot; The list praised Tagaq&#x27;s activism against &quot;to expose hard truths about systemic racism in governments, missing and murdered Indigenous women and proudly supporting the practices and preservation of her culture such as seal hunting.&quot;

In 2020 she provided narration in the music video for &quot;End of the Road&quot;, a protest song about the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women by the rock band Crown Lands.

<text>A headshell is a head piece designed to be attached to the end of a turntable&#x27;s or record player&#x27;s tonearm, which holds the cartridge. Standard catridges are secured to the headshell by a couple of 2.5 mm bolts spaced 1/2&quot; apart. Older, non-metric cartridges used #2 (3/32&quot;) bolts.

Some headshells are designed to allow variable weights to be attached. For example, the H4-S Stanton headshell comes with 2g and 4g screw-in weights. Extra weight can be useful to prevent skipping if the DJ is scratching the record.

==H-4 Bayonet Mount==
Most headshells use a standard H-4 Bayonet Mount, which will fit all S shape tonearms. The bayonet has a standard barrel whose dimensions are 8 mm diameter and 12 mm length, with its four pins connected to the four colour-coded head-shell lead wires.

==Headshell lead wires colours==

The colour standards for the contact connections are as follows:

*White: Left channel cartridge positive.
*Blue: Left channel cartridge negative.
*Red: Right channel cartridge positive.
*Green: Right channel cartridge negative.

<text>Baddeley&#x27;s model of working memory is a model of human memory proposed by Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch in 1974, in an attempt to present a more accurate model of primary memory (often referred to as short-term memory). Working memory splits primary memory into multiple components, rather than considering it to be a single, unified construct.

Baddeley and Hitch proposed their three-part working memory model as an alternative to the short-term store in Atkinson and Shiffrin&#x27;s &#x27;multi-store&#x27; memory model (1968). This model is later expanded upon by Baddeley and other co-workers to add a fourth component, and has become the dominant view in the field of working memory. However, alternative models are developing, providing a different perspective on the working memory system.

The original model of Baddeley &amp; Hitch was composed of three main components: the &quot;central executive&quot; which acts as a supervisory system and controls the flow of information from and to its &quot;slave systems&quot;: the &quot;phonological loop&quot; and the &quot;visuo-spatial sketchpad&quot;. The phonological loop stores verbal content, whereas the visuo-spatial sketchpad caters to visuo-spatial data. Both the slave systems only function as short-term storage centers.

Baddeley and Hitch&#x27;s argument for the distinction of two domain-specific slave systems in the older model was derived from experimental findings with dual-task paradigms. Performance of two simultaneous tasks requiring the use of two separate perceptual domains (i.e. a visual and a verbal task) is nearly as efficient as performance of the tasks individually. In contrast, when a person tries to carry out two tasks simultaneously that use the same perceptual domain, performance is less efficient than when performing the tasks individually.

A fourth component of Baddeley&#x27;s model was added 25 years later to complement the central executive system. It was designated as &quot;episodic buffer&quot;. It is considered a limited-capacity system that provides temporary storage of information by conjoining information from the subsidiary systems, and long-term memory, into a single episodic representation.
==Components==

===Central executive===
The central executive is a flexible system responsible for the control and regulation of cognitive processes. It directs focus and targets information, making working memory and long-term memory work together. It can be thought of as a supervisory system that controls cognitive processes, making sure the short-term store is actively working, and intervenes when they go astray and prevents distractions.

It has the following functions:
* Updating and coding incoming information and replacing old information
* Binding information from a number of sources into coherent episodes
* Coordination of the slave systems
* Shifting between tasks or retrieval strategies
* Inhibition, suppressing dominant or automatic responses
* Selective attention

The central executive has two main systems: the visuo-spatial sketchpad, for visual information, and the phonological loop, for verbal information.

Using the dual-task paradigm, Baddeley and Della Salla have found, for instance, that patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s dementia are impaired when performing multiple tasks simultaneously, even when the difficulty of the individual tasks is adapted to their abilities. Two tasks include a memory tasks and a tracking task. Individual actions are completed well, but as the Alzheimer&#x27;s becomes more prominent in a patient, performing two or more actions becomes more and more difficult. This research has shown the deteriorating of the central executive in individuals with Alzheimer&#x27;s.

Recent research on executive functions suggests that the &#x27;central&#x27; executive is not as central as conceived in the Baddeley &amp; Hitch model. Rather, there seem to be separate executive functions that can vary largely independently between individuals and can be selectively impaired or spared by brain damage.

===Phonological loop===

The phonological loop (or articulatory loop) as a whole deals with sound or phonological information. It consists of two parts: a short-term &quot;phonological store&quot; with auditory memory traces that are subject to rapid decay and an &quot;articulatory rehearsal component&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;articulatory loop&quot;) that can revive the memory traces.

Any auditory verbal information is assumed to enter automatically into the phonological store. Visually presented language can be transformed into phonological code by silent articulation and thereby be encoded into the phonological store. This transformation is facilitated by the articulatory control process. The phonological store acts as an &quot;inner ear&quot;, remembering speech sounds in their temporal order, whilst the articulatory process acts as an &quot;inner voice&quot; and repeats the series of words (or other speech elements) on a loop to prevent them from decaying. The phonological loop may play a key role in the acquisition of vocabulary, particularly in the early childhood years. It may also be vital for learning a second language.
Five main findings provide evidence for the phonological loop:

# The effect of phonological similarity:Lists of words that sound similar are more difficult to remember than words that sound different. Semantic similarity (similarity of meaning) has comparatively little effect, supporting the assumption that verbal information is coded largely phonologically in working memory.
# The effect of articulatory suppression:Memory for verbal material is impaired when people are asked to say something irrelevant aloud. This is assumed to block the articulatory rehearsal process, leading memory traces in the phonological loop to decay.
# Transfer of information between codes:With visually presented items, adults usually name and sub-vocally rehearse them, so the information is transferred from a visual to an auditory encoding. Articulatory suppression prevents this transfer, and in that case the above-mentioned effect of phonological similarity is erased for visually presented items.
# Neuropsychological evidence:A defective phonological store explains the behavior of patients with a specific deficit in phonological short-term memory. Aphasic patients with developmental verbal dyspraxia are unable to set up the speech motor codes necessary for articulation, caused by a deficiency of the articulatory rehearsal process.
# On the other hand, patients with dysarthria, whose speech problems are secondary, show a normal capacity for rehearsal. This suggests that it is the subvocal rehearsing that is crucial.

====Evidence in support of a phonological short-term store====
An accumulation of literature across decades has lent strong support to the theory of phonological STS. In a 1971 study, Stephen Madigan demonstrated that a larger recency effect is seen during forward serial recall when people are presented a list auditorally as opposed to visually. (A smaller effect is seen in backwards serial recall.) In his study, auditory presentation led to greater recall of the most recently studied items. Catherine Penney expanded on this discovery to observe that modality effects can also be found in the case of free recall tasks. In 1965, Dallett had discovered that this observed modality effect is greatly reduced by the addition of a &quot;suffix&quot; item to the presented list; this suffix is a distractor item that is not to be recalled. Robert Greene utilized this observation in 1987 to discover that this suffix effect has a larger impact on lists learned auditorally as opposed to visually. The culmination of all of these findings results in strong support of the theory that there is a short-term store that phonologically stores recently learned items. In addition, Bloom and Watkins found that the suffix effect is greatly diminished when the suffix is not interpreted as linguistic sound, which agrees with the phonological short term store theory as it would be largely unaffected by non-linguistic distractors.

===Visuo-spatial working memory===

Alan Baddeley&#x27;s theory of working memory has yet another aspect to which memory can be stored short term. The visuo-spatial sketchpad is the store that holds visual information for manipulation. The visuo-spatial sketchpad is thought to be its own storage of working memory in that it does not interfere with the short term processes of the phonological loop. In research, it has been found that the visuo-spatial sketchpad can work simultaneously with the phonological loop to process both auditory and visual stimuli without either of the processes affecting the efficacy of the other. Baddeley re-defined the theory of short-term memory as a working memory to explain this phenomenon. In the original theory of short-term memory, it is understood that a person only has one store of immediate information processing which could only hold a total of 7 items plus or minus two items to be stored in a very short period of time, sometimes a matter of seconds. The digit-span test is a perfect example of a measurement for classically defined short-term memory. Essentially, if one is not able to encode the 7 plus or minus two items within a few minutes by finding an existing association for the information to be transferred into long-term memory, then the information is lost and never encoded.

However, visuo-spatial short-term memory can retain visual and/or spatial information over brief periods of time. When this memory is in use, individuals are able to momentarily create and revisit a mental image that can be manipulated in complex or difficult tasks of spatial orientation. There are some who have disparities in the areas of the brain that allow for this to happen from different types of brain damage. There can also be a misunderstanding here in the differences between transient memories such as the visual sensory memory. A transient memory is merely a fleeting type of sensory memory; therefore, as the visual sensory memory is a type of sensory memory, there is a store for the information, but the store lasts for only a second or so. A common effect of the visual sensory memory is that individuals may remember seeing things that weren&#x27;t really there or not remembering particular things that were in their line of sight. The memory is only momentary, and if it isn&#x27;t attended to within a matter of seconds, it is gone.

There are two different pathways in the brain that control different functions of what is known inclusively as the visuo-spatial sketchpad. The sketchpad consists of the spatial short-term memory and the object memory. The spatial short-term memory is how one is able to learn and thus remember &quot;where&quot; they are in comparative representation to other objects. The object memory of the visuo-spatial sketchpad is essential in learning and remembering &quot;what&quot; an object is. The differences between these two differing visual abilities is due in large part because of different pathways of each of the abilities in the brain. The visual pathway in the brain that detects spatial representation of a person to and within their environment is the dorsal stream. The visual pathway that determines objects shapes, sizes, colors and other definitive characteristics is called the ventral stream. Each of these two streams runs independent of one another so that the visual system may process one without the other (like in brain damage for instance) or both simultaneously. The two streams do not depend on one another, so if one is functioning manipulatively, the other can still send its information through.

====Logie&#x27;s elaboration of the visuospatial sketchpad====
Logie has proposed that the visuo-spatial sketchpad can be further subdivided into two components:
# The visual cache, which stores information about form and color.
# The inner scribe, which deals with spatial and movement information. It also rehearses information in the visual cache and transfers information to the central executive.

Three main findings provide evidence for the distinction between visual and spatial parts of the visuospatial sketchpad:

# There is less interference between visual and spatial tasks than between two visual tasks or two spatial tasks.
# Brain damage can influence one of the components without influencing the other.
# Results from brain-imaging show that working memory tasks with visual objects activate mostly areas in the left hemisphere, whereas tasks with spatial information activate more areas in the right hemisphere.

===Episodic buffer===
In 2000 Baddeley added a fourth component to the model, the episodic buffer. This component is a limited capacity passive system, dedicated to linking information across domains to form integrated units of visual, spatial, and verbal information with time sequencing (or episodic chronological ordering), such as the memory of a story or a movie scene. The episodic buffer is also assumed to have links to long-term memory and semantic meaning.

The episodic buffer &quot;acts as a buffer store, not only between the components of Working Memory, but also linking Working Memory to perception and Long-Term Memory&quot;. Baddeley assumes that &quot;retrieval from the buffer occurred through conscious awareness&quot;. It allows individuals to use integrated units of information they already have to imagine new concepts. Since this is likely &quot;an attention-demanding process...the buffer would depend heavily on the Central Executive&quot;.

The main motivation for introducing this component was the observation that some (in particular, highly intelligent) patients with amnesia, who presumably have no ability to encode new information in long-term memory, nevertheless have good short-term recall of stories, recalling much more information than could be held in the phonological loop. &quot;The episodic buffer appears...capable of storing bound features and making them available to conscious awareness but not itself responsible for the process of binding&quot;.

It is assumed that &quot;conscious access to the phonological loop or sketchpad may operate via the buffer&quot;. This is based on the assumption that both the visuo-spatial sketchpad and phonological loop act as minor buffers, combining information within their sensory area. The episodic buffer may also interact with smell and taste.

==Biology/neuroscience==
There is much evidence for a brief memory buffer, as distinct from the long term store. The phonological loop seems to be connected to activation in the left hemisphere, more specifically the temporal lobe. The visuo-spatial sketchpad activates different areas depending on task difficulty; less intense tasks seem to activate in the occipital lobe, whereas more complex tasks appear in the parietal lobe. The central executive is still a mystery, although it would seem to be more or less located in the frontal lobes of the brain. The episodic buffer seems to be in both hemispheres (bilateral) with activations in both the frontal and temporal lobes, and even the left portion of the hippocampus. In terms of genetics, the gene ROBO1 has been associated with phonological buffer integrity or length.

==Validity of the model==
The strength of Baddeley&#x27;s model is its ability to integrate a large number of findings from work on short-term and working memory. Additionally, the mechanisms of the slave systems, especially the phonological loop, has inspired a wealth of research in experimental psychology, neuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience.

However, criticisms have been raised, for instance of the phonological-loop component, because some details of the findings are not easily explained by the original Baddeley and Hitch model, including the controversy regarding the 7±2 rule.

The episodic buffer is seen as a helpful addition to the model of working memory, but it has not been investigated extensively and its functions remain unclear.

<text>Michael Hayden Armacost (born April 15, 1937) is a retired American diplomat and a fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Freeman Spogli Institute. He was acting United States Secretary of State during the early days of the administration of President George H. W. Bush, before Secretary James Baker was confirmed by the Senate. Armacost also served as United States Ambassador to Japan and the president of the Brookings Institution from 1995 to 2002.

==Diplomatic career==
In the 1960s, Armacost taught international relations and foreign policy at Pomona College.

Armacost was a White House Fellow in 1969-1970. Founded in 1964, the White House Fellowship is one of America’s most prestigious programs for leadership and public service. The Fellowship, awarded on a strictly non-partisan basis, offers exceptional young leaders first-hand experience working at the highest levels of federal government. 

In January 1977 Armacost was selected as a member of the National Security Council to handle East Asian and Chinese affairs under the Carter administration until July 1978, when he was replaced by Nicholas Platt. Years later he was appointed to be the United States Ambassador to Japan from 1989 to 1993, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs from 1984 to 1989, and United States Ambassador to the Philippines from 1982 to 1984, during a critical period of political upheaval during the Ferdinand Marcos presidency.

Armacost served as Acting Secretary of State from January 20, 1989, to January 25, 1989. Between 1995 and 2002, he served as president of the Brookings Institution.

Armacost has received the President&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award, the Defense Department&#x27;s Distinguished Civilian Service Award, and the Secretary of State&#x27;s Distinguished Services Award.

Armacost is the author of three books, the most recent of which, &quot;Friends or Rivals?&quot;, was published in 1996 and draws on his tenure as ambassador. He also co-edited, with Daniel Okimoto, &quot;The Future of America&#x27;s Alliances in Northeast Asia&quot;, published in 2004 by Stanford Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center. Armacost has served on numerous corporate and nonprofit boards, including TRW, AFLAC, Applied Materials, USEC, Inc., Cargill, Inc, Carleton College, and The Asia Foundation.

Armacost received a Bachelor of Arts in international relations (1958) and an honorary degree (1989) from Carleton College. He was an international fellow of the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University in 1961. He earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1965. 

Armacost is a Fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration. He was chairman of Carleton College&#x27;s board of trustees from 2004 to 2008.

<doc id="1008642" wikidata="Q3434499" url="?curid=1008642" title="Robert Baltovich">
<text>Robert Baltovich (born July 17, 1965) is a Canadian man who was wrongly convicted in 1992 of the murder of his girlfriend, Elizabeth Bain, in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada. He spent eight years in prison and nearly another decade trying to clear his name, before being found not guilty in a retrial on April 22, 2008.

== Elizabeth Bain murder ==

On June 8, 1990, Baltovich graduated with a degree in psychology and history from the University of Toronto at Scarborough. There he met fellow student Elizabeth Bain and a relationship developed. Bain disappeared on June 19, 1990, after telling her mother she was going to &quot;check the tennis schedule&quot; on campus. On June 22, her car was found with a large bloodstain in the back seat, later identified to be Bain&#x27;s blood. Her body was never found. Detectives Brian Raybould and Steve Reesor took over the case.

== First trial and conviction ==

On November 19, 1990, Baltovich was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. Justice John O&#x27;Driscoll presided over his case, with crown prosecutors John McMahon and Paul Amenta. His trial lawyers were William Gatward and Michael Engel. His case continued in the courts for several years, during which he consistently maintained his innocence. His lawyers suggested that the so-called &quot;Scarborough rapist&quot; (the term used for the then unidentified serial killer Paul Bernardo) might be responsible for the murder.

On March 31, 1992, Baltovich was convicted of second-degree murder.

== Appeal, retrial and acquittal ==

On December 2, 2004, the Court of Appeal for Ontario set aside the conviction, delivering what news reports called &quot;a scathing attack&quot; on the conduct of the original trial judge. This fell short of the acquittal that Baltovich&#x27;s counsel had argued for. On July 15, 2005, Ontario&#x27;s Ministry of the Attorney-General announced that Baltovich would face a new trial on charges of second-degree murder, at an unspecified date, and remain free on bail in the meantime. During that time, Baltovich worked as a librarian for the Government of Ontario.

In 1999, Baltovich got in contact with the Association in Defense of the Wrongly Convicted (now Innocence Canada). James Lockyer and Joanne McLean took over his case and filed for an appeal. On March 31, 2000, Baltovich was released on bail, pending the outcome of his appeal. In September 2004 his appeal was finally processed; once more his case gained national attention when his lawyers alleged that he had been wrongfully convicted and that Bernardo was guilty of Bain&#x27;s murder. They pointed to circumstantial evidence suggesting links to Bernardo, evidence not available during Baltovich&#x27;s original trial because Bernardo&#x27;s identity as the &quot;Scarborough rapist&quot; was then unknown. Asked about the matter, Bernardo denied involvement in Bain&#x27;s disappearance. Baltovich&#x27;s defense also pointed to issues with hypnotizing eyewitnesses to &#x27;help with their memory&#x27;. The case &quot;R v. Trochym&quot; (2007) deemed that any evidence obtained through hypnosis is inadmissible in court.

On March 31, 2008, jury selection began in the second-degree murder trial. The trial, slated to begin in Toronto on April 14, 2008, was delayed, with the Crown (prosecution) giving no reason. When the trial resumed, the Crown declined to call any of the more than 50 witnesses they had planned, citing &quot;recent developments, including the cumulative effect of the pre-trial evidentiary rulings rendered to date in this case, other evidentiary issues, and changes to case law&quot;. With no Crown case, the judge directed the jury to make a finding of not guilty on April 22, 2008.

== Civil Suit ==

In January 2010, the Attorney-General concluded that the payment of financial compensation was not appropriate.

On April 21, 2010, a civil suit alleging malicious prosecution, negligent investigation and negligent representation was filed on behalf of Baltovich. The defendants named include John McMahon, now a judge with the Superior Court of Ontario, and Paul Amenta, a practicing Crown Attorney in Toronto. Det. Sgt. Brian Raybould and Det. Sgt. Steve Reesor, the two lead detectives in the case, are also named as defendants.

In May 2014, Baltovich&#x27;s lawyers applied to amend his statement of claim. Media reported that during examinations for discovery related to Baltovich&#x27;s civil suit, previously undisclosed forensic evidence had surfaced indicating that Det. Sgt. Brian Raybould had met with two forensic experts three days after Baltovich&#x27;s arrest in November 1990 during which time he was told that the police theory of the crime - that Baltovich had killed Elizabeth Bain on June 19, 1990, hidden her body nearby in Colonel Danforth Park and that he had returned three days later to retrieve her body and drive it out of Scarborough in her car - was not supported by the forensic evidence found in Bain&#x27;s car and that, according to Baltovich&#x27;s lawyers, the theory presented at Baltovich&#x27;s first trial was &quot;flawed and untenable.&quot; It is also alleged that Det. Sgt. Brian Raybould doctored his notes in an effort to conceal the existence of the meeting by removing pages referencing the meeting and replacing them with another page from his notes from a later date.

<doc id="1008644" wikidata="Q3064951" url="?curid=1008644" title="Psychomotor retardation">
<text>Psychomotor retardation involves a slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movements in an individual. It can cause a visible slowing of physical and emotional reactions, including speech and affect.

Psychomotor retardation is most commonly seen in people with major depression and in the depressed phase of bipolar disorder; it is also associated with the adverse effects of certain drugs, such as benzodiazepines. Particularly in an inpatient setting, psychomotor retardation may require increased nursing care to ensure adequate food and fluid intake and sufficient personal care. Informed consent for treatment is more difficult to achieve in the presence of this condition.

== Causes ==
* Psychiatric disorders: anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, schizophrenia, severe depression, etc.
* Psychiatric medicines (if taken as prescribed or improperly, overdosed, or mixed with alcohol)
* Parkinson&#x27;s disease
* Genetic disorders: Qazi–Markouizos syndrome, Say–Meyer syndrome, Tranebjaerg-Svejgaard syndrome, Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome, Wilson&#x27;s disease, etc.

== Examples ==

Examples of psychomotor retardation include the following:
* Unaccountable difficulty in carrying out what are usually considered &quot;automatic&quot; or &quot;mundane&quot; self care tasks for healthy people (i.e., without depressive illness) such as taking a shower, dressing, grooming, cooking, brushing teeth, and exercising.
* Physical difficulty performing activities that normally require little thought or effort, such as walking up stairs, getting out of bed, preparing meals, and clearing dishes from the table, household chores, and returning phone calls.
* Tasks requiring mobility suddenly (or gradually) may inexplicably seem &quot;impossible&quot;. Activities such as shopping, getting groceries, taking care of daily needs, and meeting the demands of employment or school are commonly affected.
* Activities usually requiring little mental effort can become challenging. Balancing a checkbook, making a shopping list, and making decisions about mundane tasks (such as deciding what errands need to be done) are often difficult.

In schizophrenia, activity level may vary from psychomotor retardation to agitation; the patient experiences periods of listlessness and may be unresponsive, and at the next moment be active and energetic.

<text>The Deal barracks bombing was an attack by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) on the Royal Marine Depot, Deal, England. It took place at 8:22 am on 22 September 1989, when the IRA exploded a time bomb at the Royal Marines School of Music building. The building collapsed, killing 11 marines from the Royal Marines Band Service and wounding another 21.

==Background==
The Royal Marines School of Music is a professional training centre for musicians of the Royal Marines Band Service, the musical arm of the Royal Navy. Originally created at Portsmouth in 1930, it moved to Deal in 1950 and in 1989 was still there as part of the Royal Marine Depot, Deal. Throughout the 1980s, the IRA had been waging a paramilitary campaign against targets in Britain and Northern Ireland with the stated aim of achieving the separation of Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom. These operations had included an attempt to kill the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984 and a similar attack on a military band in London in 1982.

==Explosion==
At 8:22am on 22 September 1989, a time bomb detonated in the recreational centre changing room at the Royal Marines School of Music. The blast destroyed the recreational centre, levelled the three-storey accommodation building next to it and caused extensive damage to the rest of the base and nearby civilian homes. The blast was heard several kilometres away, shaking windows in the centre of Deal, and creating a large pall of smoke over the town. Most of the personnel who used the building as a barracks had already risen and were practising marching on the parade ground when the blast occurred. These marines witnessed the buildings collapse, and many of the teenaged personnel were in a state of shock for days afterwards.

Some marines had remained behind in the building, and thus received the full force of the explosion. Many were trapped in the rubble for hours and military heavy lifting equipment was needed to clear much of it. Kent Ambulance Service voluntarily agreed to end its industrial strike action to aid those wounded by the blast. Ten marines died at the scene with most trapped in the collapsed building, although one body was later found on the roof of a nearby house. Another 21 were seriously injured and received treatment at hospitals in Dover, Deal and Canterbury. One of these men, 21-year-old Christopher Nolan, died of his injuries on 18 October 1989. Three of those killed were buried nearby at the Hamilton Road Cemetery, Deal. The names of the victims were - Msn Mick Ball, 24, Msn Andy Cleatheroe, 25, Msn Trevor Davis, 39, Msn Richard Fice, 22, Msn Richard &quot;Taff&quot; Jones, 27, Band Cpl David &quot;Mac&quot; McMillan, 26, Msn Christopher Nolan, 21, Band Cpl Dean Pavey, 31, Msn Mark Petch, 26, Msn Tim Reeves, 24 and Msn Bob Simmonds, 34. 

==Reactions==

The IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing, saying it was a continuation of their campaign to rid Northern Ireland of all British troops who had been deployed there since 1969. Many British people were shocked by the attack, carried out on a ceremonial military band whose military training was mostly geared towards saving lives. The public were also shocked by the ages of those killed, as many were new recruits to the School and most of those injured were teenagers.

The British Government also condemned the IRA&#x27;s attack. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher made a statement from Moscow, where she was on an official visit, saying that she was &quot;shocked and extremely sad&quot;. Leader of the opposition, Neil Kinnock, described the attack as an &quot;awful atrocity&quot; and said, &quot;Even the people who say they support what the IRA calls its cause must be sickened by the way in which such death and injury is mercilessly inflicted&quot;.

The Commandant General Royal Marines Lieutenant-General Sir Martin Garrod appeared on television soon after the bombing, condemning the bombers as &quot;thugs, extortionists, torturers, murderers and cowards – the scum of the earth&quot; and &quot;We will emerge stronger and more determined than ever before to end and destroy this foul and dark force of evil.&quot;

The base&#x27;s security caused controversy as this was partly provided by a private security firm. This arrangement prompted a thorough review of security procedures at all British military bases and the replacement of the firm&#x27;s employees at Deal with Royal Marine guards.

One week after the bombing, the staff and students of the School of Music marched through the town of Deal, watched and applauded by thousands of spectators. They maintained gaps in their ranks to mark the positions of those unable to march through death or serious injury. A memorial bandstand was constructed at Walmer Green to the memory of those who &quot;only ever wanted to play music&quot;. A memorial in the Deal Barracks chapel was destroyed when the building burnt down in 2003, but the site is now a memorial garden. The surviving barracks at Deal were converted into flats when the base was decommissioned in 1996, and the School of Music is once again based in Portsmouth.

Every year the Royal Marines Band from Portsmouth visit the memorial bandstand in Deal to pay their respects to those who died in the bombing. In July 2009, a memorial concert and re-dedication ceremony was held at the bandstand on Walmer Green, attended by thousands. The event drew over 12,000 spectators in 2019, which marked the 30th anniversary of the bombing.

Deal Parochial Church of England School now stands in the former barracks&#x27; Drill Fields. A large carved stone bearing the Globe and Laurel (the cap badge and emblem of the Royal Marines) sits at the entrance of the school. It originally adorned one of the buildings facing the parade square in the barracks. On Tuesday 22 September 2015, the 26th anniversary of the bombing, following a restoration of the stone by the school&#x27;s Year 6 pupils, the school held a re-dedication service to mark the role played by the Royal Marines in the town.
No one has ever been arrested or convicted in connection with the Deal bombing.

<doc id="1008667" wikidata="Q156630" url="?curid=1008667" title="BayArena">
<text>BayArena () is a football stadium in Leverkusen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, which has been the home ground of Bundesliga club Bayer 04 Leverkusen since 1958.

==History==
The stadium was originally known as &quot;Ulrich-Haberland-Stadion&quot; (; ), named after a former chairman of Bayer AG, the club&#x27;s founders. Its original capacity was 20,000.

In 1986, a rebuilding project began to convert it into a modern facility; the project continued over the following decade and was completed in 1997, creating a modern all-seater stadium with a capacity of 22,500. The stadium was renamed &quot;BayArena&quot; in 1998. The former name was then used for the youth team stadium next to it.

In 1999, a hotel attached to the stadium was completed, with some rooms having a view of the pitch. The stadium complex also includes a restaurant, which also overlooks the pitch, and conference facilities.

The city of Leverkusen originally bid to become a venue for the 2006 World Cup, with an expanded Bay Arena as the site. However, the city, Bayer Leverkusen, and the German organizing committee soon agreed that expanding Bay Arena to the FIFA-mandated minimum 40,000 capacity for World Cup matches would not be practical, and the city withdrew its bid. Instead, it was agreed that Bay Arena would be the main training facility for the German national team during the 2006 finals. Jürgen Klinsmann, former national coach, however decided against Leverkusen and opted for Berlin as the main training facility. As compensation, BayArena would supposedly host two national matches, though they were never played.

==2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup==
On 30 March 2007 Bayer AG agreed on the extension of the stadium to a capacity of over 30,000. Construction works began end of 2007 and were expected to be finished at the beginning of the 2009–10 season.
On 30 September 2008, Bay Arena was selected as one of nine venues to be used during the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup to house three group and one quarterfinal match.

===2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup matches===
==Design==
As the new stadium design was planned in the 80s, it was based on the design of the then Ruhrstadium in Bochum. A steep single-tier football stadium without a running track with seating for 35,000 spectators. The stadium was intended to be constructed section by section over time in order to save costs and grow with the demands of the club, starting with the east stand in 1986, the west in 1989 and the north in 1991. In the middle of the rebuild, the demands of modern football stadiums changed. Suites and VIP Areas became necessary, a family friendly section as well as design modification to all-seater following the Bundesliga riots of the 1990s and the demands for international matches.

As a lesson from the World Cup 1994 in the USA the north section was redesignated as a so-called &quot;Family Street&quot;, the first section of a German stadium aimed at attracting a younger audience. This concept proved to be a rousing success and demanded the moving of the Family Street to the larger east section for the 1996–97 season. In the process the BayArena was the first stadium in Germany to turn into an all-seater and to remove part of the fences which had separated the tiers from the pitch, starting again in the east and later expanded to the whole stadium. Due to the demands for larger VIP areas, the original plans for closing the gap in the south with a stand the same layout as the north were dropped in 1995. Instead the south section was built as box suites, making the stadium unique in the Bundesliga with its South American style horseshoe design. With the work finished in 1997 the BayArena was judged as the most comfortable and modern stadium in Germany.

The expansion and renovation of 2007–2009 added a second tier over the east, north and west sections, new VIP suites between the two tiers, a new oval roof covering all seats as well as the complete rebuild of the club&#x27;s main facilities in the west section. It also saw the reintroduction of pure standing areas for the home supporters in the corner north/east. After summer 2013, the pure standing area was stretched over the complete first rows of the north section of the stadium.

<text>The Ukraine national football team ( ) represents Ukraine in men&#x27;s international football, and is governed by the Ukrainian Association of Football, the governing body for football in Ukraine. Ukraine&#x27;s home ground is the Olimpiyskiy Stadium in Kyiv. The team has been a full member of UEFA and FIFA since 1992.

After the restoration of the Ukrainian independence, they played their first match against Hungary on 29 April 1992. The team reached the quarter-finals in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their debut in the finals of a major championship. Apart from Russia, Ukraine is the only post-Soviet state to qualify for the FIFA World Cup finals.

As the host nation, Ukraine automatically qualified for UEFA Euro 2012. Four years later, Ukraine finished third in their qualifying group for Euro 2016 and advanced via the play-off route to reach a UEFA European Championship tournament through the qualifiers for the first time. This marked the first time in Ukraine&#x27;s six play-off appearances that it managed to win such a tie, having lost previous play-off ties for the 1998 World Cup, Euro 2000, the 2002 World Cup, the 2010 World Cup and the 2014 World Cup, and would lose again in the 2022 World Cup play-offs.

Ukraine&#x27;s best performances in the UEFA European Championship and in the World Cup were in 2020 and 2006 respectively, in both cases reaching the quarter-finals for the first time.

==History==

===Ukrainian SSR (1924–1990)===
The national team was formed in the early 1990s and was recognized internationally soon afterwards. It is not widely known, however, that Ukraine previously had a national team in 1924–1935. Just like the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic had its own national team. The national team included the players Andriy Ponomarenko, Ivan Privalov, Volodymyr Fomin, H. Syrota, Mykola Fomin, Anatoliy Lisnyi, Oleksandr Shatokha (goalkeeper), Dmytro Kyryllov, Dmytro Starusev, Serhiy Kopeiko, Petro Parovyshnykov (first team); Valentyn Prokofyev, Fedir Tyutchev, H. Yakubovskyi, Ivan Vladymyrskyi, Serafim Moskvin (goalkeeper), Kazymyr Piontkovskyi, Mykhailo Pashuta, Vasiliy Yepishin, Adam Bem, K. Us, Volodymyr Prasolov (second team).

The earliest record of games played by Ukraine can be traced back to August 1928. A championship among the national teams of the Soviet republics as well as the Moscow city team was planned to take place in Moscow; at the All-Soviet tournament, Ukraine reached the final where it lost to Moscow 1–0, after defeating Belarus and Transcaucasus.

In 1929, Ukraine beat Lower Austria in an exhibition match in Kharkiv 4–1, and played in another Soviet tournament. Ukraine lost to Transcaucasus 3–0.

===Official formation===
Before 1991, Ukrainian players were represented by the Soviet Union national team. After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Russia took place in the qualifying tournament for the 1994 World Cup. The national team of Ukraine did not manage to enter the tournament on account of it not yet being admitted to FIFA. Meanwhile, some of the best Ukrainian players of the beginning of the 1990s (including Andrei Kanchelskis, Viktor Onopko, Sergei Yuran, Yuriy Nikiforov, Ilya Tsymbalar and Oleg Salenko) chose to play for Russia. At that time Vyacheslav Koloskov was the only top official from the former Soviet Union and later Russia who served as a vice-president of UEFA in 1980–1996 and represented the Soviet Union and later the Commonwealth of Independent States.

The Soviet Union&#x27;s five-year UEFA coefficient, despite being earned in part by Ukrainian players (for example, in the final of the last successful event, Euro 1988, under the direction of Valery Lobanovsky, 7 out of the 11 starting players were Ukrainians), were transferred to the Russia national team. As a result, a crisis was created for both the national team and the domestic league.

Another reason for the occurred harsh crisis in the Ukrainian football was lack of adequate funding of teams, due to the general economic crisis that has affected all of the CIS countries. There also was a reverse influx of players; Viktor Leonenko agreed on transfer from Dynamo Moscow to Dynamo Kyiv. The Russian club did not want to release him, but Leonenko did not want to continue to play in Moscow.

In the following years, the Ukrainian team improved, showcasing talents like Andriy Shevchenko, Serhiy Rebrov, and Oleksandr Shovkovskyi.

===First official games (Prokopenko)===
Soon after being accepted to FIFA and UEFA as a full member in 1992, Ukraine selected its first manager by members of a coaching council which consisted of Anatoliy Puzach (manager of Dynamo Kyiv), Yevhen Kucherevskyi (FC Dnipro), Yevhen Lemeshko (Torpedo Zaporizhzhia), Yukhym Shkolnykov (Bukovyna Chernivtsi) and Viktor Prokopenko (Chornomorets Odesa). Later, they were joined by Valeriy Yaremchenko (Shakhtar Donetsk). The circle was narrowed to three specialists; Prokopenko eventually became the manager.
Ukraine played their first match on 29 April 1992 against Hungary in Uzhhorod at the Avanhard Stadium, losing 3–1 with the sole Ukrainian goal scored by Ivan Hetsko. With the creation of &quot;fantom&quot; (transitional) CIS team in place of the Soviet Union playing its own friendly against the England in Moscow in preparation to the UEFA Euro 1992, the Ukrainian team lost some notable players to that team. Following a couple of losses to Hungary and a draw to the United States, Prokopenko resigned and the last season game that year for the national team was led by his assistants Mykola Pavlov and Leonid Tkachenko.

===Euro 1996 qualification (Bazylevych)===

Ukraine appointed another head coach, Oleh Bazylevych, who made his debut with the national team in the spring of 1993 in Odesa during a friendly against Israel, a 1–1 draw. Less than a month later Ukraine finally won, in Vilnius in an away friendly against Lithuania. During the summer they lost 3–1 to Croatia; Ukraine was later seeded in Group 4 of the UEFA Euro 1996 qualification.

Ukraine was defeated by Israel in March 1994, and drew Bulgaria and the United Arab Emirates. On 7 September 1994, the national team started its first official qualification campaign with a surprising home loss 2–0 to Lithuania. Following the defeat and a weak performance in preceding friendlies Bazylevych was fired and on the tour to South Korea the team was led by the Bazylevych assistants Pavlov and Muntyan as a temporary replacement until Federation signs a contract with Valeriy Lobanovsky. on 24 September, the Football Federation of Ukraine appointed Yozhef Sabo as an acting manager until the end of the year after Lobanovsky signed a contract with Kuwait.

With the new manager, their next home game against Slovenia ended goalless and they then beat Estonia 3–0 gaining their first win in official competitive game. At the beginning of the year the Football Federation confirmed Anatoliy Konkov as the new head coach on 5 January 1995.

With Konkov the team started with away losses of 4–0 to Croatia and 3–0 to Italy. After that there was a three-game winning streak including a home victory against Croatia and theoretical hopes which were abruptly cut after a loss to Slovenia and the team finished in the fourth place in its first qualification campaign behind Lithuania.

===1998–2004: near misses===
Following the expiration of a year-long contract with Konkov, in 1996 the Federation appointed Sabo as a head coach and received a preliminary agreement that Lobanovsky will become available following his contract with Kuwait.

Ukraine participated in 1998 World Cup qualification, where the team was drawn into Group 9. Ukraine took second place, only behind Germany and ahead of Portugal but was defeated in a play-off stage 3–1 on aggregate by Croatia. The qualification campaign became notable as the beginning of the international career for Shevchenko as well as more play time for some other players such as Oleksandr Shovkovsky and Serhiy Rebrov.

In UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying, Ukraine, assigned in Group 4, finished above Russia, thanks to an important draw in Moscow and a home victory, but still only qualified for the playoff behind the French side despite being undefeated. Ukraine then fell to Slovenia 3–2 on aggregate. Following the qualification campaign, the Federation finally signed a contract with Valery Lobanovsky, ending Sabo&#x27;s tenure as a head coach.

The 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification saw Ukraine in Group 5. With Lobanovsky as a head coach, there were expectations of the first qualification to the finals. Yet, Ukraine suffered a home loss to Poland in their opening match, and many draws had resulted in Ukraine qualifying for the playoff again, losing to Germany, 5–2 on aggregate. Under public pressure, particularly the Higher League head coaches who argued that the national team head coach cannot competently serve for both club and national, as well as the health issues of Lobanovsky himself, the Federation decided not to renew a contract with Lobanovsky letting him concentrate on Dynamo Kyiv.

In UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying, Ukraine with the new head coach and another former Dynamo Kyiv star Leonid Buryak was assigned into Group 6, with Spain and Greece. Ukraine failed to qualify.

===2006 World Cup===
After Euro 2004 qualifying, Ukraine appointed Oleg Blokhin as the national team&#x27;s head coach. Placed in Group 2, Ukraine went on to qualify as a group winner for their first-ever FIFA World Cup on 3 September 2005 after drawing 1–1 against Georgia in Tbilisi and ahead of Turkey, Denmark and the last campaign rivals Greece among others. This also was the first successful qualification campaign for Ukraine despite a poor home turf performance.

In the 2006 World Cup, they were in Group H with Spain, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. After losing 4–0 in the first match against Spain, the Ukrainians won the next two matches to face Switzerland in the round of 16. Drawing goalless, Ukraine took Switzerland to a penalty shoot-out where two saves from Oleksandr Shovkovsky secured a positive outcome for his side despite the first kick miss by Andriy Shevchenko. Switzerland which did not lose or yield a single goal was sent home early with Ukraine advancing to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, Ukraine, facing Italy, was defeated with two second half two goals from Luca Toni, securing a comfortable 3–0 win for the future 2006 World Cup champions.

===2006–2012===
After the World Cup, Ukraine was placed in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group B, along with Italy and France; Ukraine had also performed poorly against Scotland, Georgia and Lithuania, ultimately finishing in fourth place. Due to the bleak performance of the national team Oleg Blokhin resigned and surprisingly signed with the recently established FC Moscow.

With another Soviet football star player Oleksiy Mykhaylychenko as the new head coach, 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification saw Ukraine in Group 6, drawing Croatia and winning against England, sending Ukraine to the playoff. Greece, which had been eliminated by Ukraine in the qualifiers four years earlier, would eventually get revenge. Following the failure to qualify, the Federation decided not to renew the contract with Mykhaylychenko.

As co-hosts, Ukraine qualified automatically for Euro 2012, marking their debut in the UEFA European Championship. The Federation decided to appoint Myron Markevych to prepare and lead the national team in the Euro finals. However, following a few friendlies Markevych resigned due to the off-pitch politics and having held coaching office of both the national team and Metalist Kharkiv. For the next several games in 2010 and 2011 the national team was led by caretaker Yuriy Kalitvintsev who starred for Ukraine back in its first qualification campaign for the Euro 1996.

On 21 April 2011, Blokhin was again appointed head coach of the Ukraine national team signing a four-year contract. With Blokhin at helm in their opening game against Sweden, Ukraine won 2–1 in Kyiv. In Donetsk, Ukraine was eliminated after a 2–0 loss to France and a 1–0 defeat to England.

===2014–present===
Drawn into UEFA Group H for 2014 World Cup qualification, Ukraine qualified for yet another playoff after two wins over Poland and two draws over England, where they would play against France. Ukraine beat France at home 2–0 but suffered a 3–0 loss away. Blokhin stepped down due to health concerns in the autumn of 2012 soon after the first home game against England and was replaced by Andriy Bal and later Oleksandr Zavarov. While considering hiring a first foreign specialist, the Federation finally appointed Mykhailo Fomenko as a head coach by the end of 2012. Even though Fomenko did not manage to qualify for the World Cup, the Federation decided to retain his services until the end of 2015.
With the ongoing Russian aggression, Ukraine in Euro 2016 qualifying was drawn against Spain, Slovakia, Belarus, Macedonia and Luxembourg. Despite having won all matches apart from those against Spain and Slovakia, they finished third due to the results against the top two teams in the group. They defeated Slovenia in the playoff, marking the first time they qualified for a major tournament through the playoffs.

Ukraine lost all three games at Euro 2016 without scoring a goal; a 2–0 loss to Germany, a 2–0 loss to Northern Ireland, and Poland 1–0.

Following the Euro 2016, Fomenko was replaced with Andriy Shevchenko as a head coach who served as his assistant during the Euro finals. Seeded in the UEFA Group I, Ukraine started with a home draw to Iceland in 2018 World Cup qualifying and an away draw to Turkey. This was followed by two home wins, 3–0 against Kosovo and 1–0 against Finland. After a 1–0 away loss to Croatia, they beat Finland 2–1 away and Turkey 2–0 at home, they lost 2–0 away to Iceland and won a 2–0 away win against Kosovo. Losing to Croatia at home, they failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying and in all its previous World Cup qualifications.

In the inaugural UEFA Nations League, Ukraine was drawn with the Czech Republic and Slovakia in League B. They beat the Czech Republic 2–1 away and Slovakia 1–0 at home, before earning a promotion to League A with a 1–0 home win to the Czech Republic.
Ukraine was placed in a group with Euro 2016 champions Portugal as well as Serbia. In its opening game of the qualifying campaign Ukraine visited Portugal which was led by returning star Cristiano Ronaldo. The match ended 0–0. The second game, against Luxembourg, ended up as a 2–1 win, preceding Ukraine&#x27;s 5–0 win against Serbia, along with a narrow 1–0 win against Luxembourg. Two matches—away and home against Lithuania (winning 3–0 and 2–0 respectively) saw Ukraine with 16 points and in need of only a point against Portugal. Ukraine won 2–1 and the group before drawing Serbia 2–2.

Ukraine was drawn with Switzerland, Spain, and Germany in the next Nations League. The Ukrainians started their campaign by overcoming Switzerland at home 2–1 to temporarily take first place. However, their next opponent Spain won 4–0. Germany then won 2–1 in Kyiv. Ukraine then defeated Spain for the first time with a 1–0 win. Germany swept Ukraine after a 1–0 deficit was canceled for a 3–1 victory.

As the COVID-19 crisis in Ukraine worsened, eight players from the starting squad tested positive (including one positive SARS-CoV-2 test upon arrival to Lucerne), and as a result, the entire delegation was put into quarantine by the Department of Health of the Canton of Lucerne. Their game against Switzerland away was subsequently cancelled. Ukraine faced relegation if the game was to be awarded 3–0 to Switzerland, or if the result is decided by a drawing of lots and Switzerland was to be handed a 1–0 victory. Eventually, UEFA decided that the match result would be 3–0 in favour of Switzerland and the CAS subsequently upheld the result, meaning that Ukraine had been officially relegated after just one year in League A.
Ukraine qualified for the knockout stages in the European Championship for the first time in the 2020 tournament, postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19, as one of the best third-placed teams. They beat Sweden 2–1 in the round of 16, after Artem Dovbyk scored the winning goal in the first minute of the second half in extra time. They were then defeated by England in the quarter-final, recording their best finish at a major tournament since 2006.

Ukraine drew 1–1 in both games against France in 2022 World Cup qualifying. Ukraine would then qualify for the playoff after breaking the record set by Australia for the most consecutive draws in World Cup qualification, with five straight draws. After five years and under the spell of draws in the recent campaign, Shevchenko announced his resignation in August 2021 and was replaced with Oleksandr Petrakov who had recently led the Ukraine U-20 team to the World Cup victory. Ukraine eventually picked up a much-needed victory over Finland, ending their run of draws and giving them a two-point lead over Bosnia and a three-point lead over Finland. However, both Bosnia and Finland had a game in hand over Ukraine, who qualified for the playoffs after a 2–0 win over Bosnia and a Finnish loss to France. Ukraine faced Scotland in the Group A playoff semifinals, postponed in March 2022 to June after Russia invaded the country in February, winning 3–1 at Hampden Park, but ultimately losing 1–0 to Wales in an emotional playoff final at the Cardiff City Stadium.

Ukraine, who were relegated to League B in the 2nd Nations League due to their last-place finish (2 wins to 4 losses), failed to gain promotion to League A in the following Nations League, finishing 2nd in their group in the 3rd Nations League, beaten by Scotland against whom they lost in Glasgow in contrast to the play-off semi-final (0–3) and unable to beat the &quot;Tartan Army&quot; on neutral ground in the return leg (0–0).

In the qualifiers for the Euro 2024, Ukraine finished third in their highly competitive group, with four wins, two draws and two defeats. However, Italy finished ahead of the &quot;Zbirna&quot; only thanks to a favourable head-to-head record despite having the same number of points, while in the decisive Ukraine/Italy match (0–0) on neutral ground in Leverkusen, Germany, a refereeing error was made to the Ukrainians&#x27; disadvantage with a penalty not whistled for an Italian foul at the end of match.

Eligible for the play-offs as the best non-group winner, Ukraine initially defeated Bosnia 2–1 away in the semi-finals of the Path B play-offs on March 21, 2024. Five days later, on March 26, 2024, Ukraine qualified for Euro 2024 in Germany, beating Iceland 2–1 in the play-off final at the Wrocław Stadium in Poland. In this decisive final, as in the semi-final against Bosnia, Ukraine conceded the opening goal on each occasion and managed to turn the match around, winning by a narrow margin at the very end. Having been drawn into Group E with Romania, Belgium and Slovakia, Ukraine finished level with all the other teams in the group on four points, but were knocked out on goal difference.

==Stadiums==

Most matches are held at Kyiv&#x27;s Olimpiyskyi National Sports Complex.

During the Soviet era (before 1991), only three stadiums in Ukraine were used in official games, the Olimpiysky NSC in Kyiv (known then as Republican Stadium), the predecessor of Chornomorets, BSS Central Stadium in Odesa, and the Lokomotiv Stadium in Simferopol.

Since May 2022, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, home game matches have been taking place in Łódź.

<text>Koynanagar is a town in Maharashtra, India. It is situated on the Chiplun-Sangli state highway on the banks of Koyna River. The town is small but famous for Koyna Dam and the Koyna Hydroelectric Project which is the largest completed hydroelectric project of India. An earthquake in 1967 flattened the city and left 180 people dead.

Koyna Nagar is nestled in the Western Ghats, about above sea level, and hence has a tolerable climate for most of the year.

<text>The Koyna River (Marathi pronunciation: ) is a tributary of the Krishna River which originates in Mahableshwar, Satara district, western Maharashtra, India. It rises near Mahabaleshwar, a famous hill station in the Western Ghats. Unlike most of the other rivers in Maharashtra which flow East-West direction, the Koyna river flows in North-South direction. The Koyna River is famous for the Koyna Dam and the Koyna Hydroelectric Project. Koyna Hydroelectric Project is the 2nd largest completed hydroelectric project in India. The reservoir – Shivasagar Lake, is a huge lake of 50 km in length.

Due to its electricity generating potential through Koyna Hydroelectric Project, Koyna river is known as the Life Line of Maharashtra.

The river meets the Krishna River, which is one of the three largest rivers in southern India by Karad at Pritisangam.

The river is just about 100 meters in width and is slow-flowing. It is an olive shade of green during the dry months and a bluish-brown in the monsoon months attributed to much algae and aquatic plant life. The impounded water of the Koyna Dam though has submerged a significant amount of Rain forest of the Western Ghats, it has helped a lot to the surrounding forest by supplying water all round the year. Hence a wide biodiversity of plants and animals is observed in the evergreen forest surrounding the river.

== Geography and history ==
Mahabaleshwar is the source of five rivers namely Krishna River, Koyna, Venna (Veni), Savitri, and Gayatri. The source is at the Panchaganga temple in old Mahabaleshwar. The legendary source of the river is a spout from the mouth of a statue of a cow in the ancient temple of Mahadev in Old Mahabaleshwar. Legend has it that Krishna is Lord Vishnu himself as a result of a curse on the trimurtis by Savitri. Also, its tributaries Venna and Koyana are said to be Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma themselves. An interesting thing to notice is that 4other rivers including Koyna come out from the cow&#x27;s mouth apart from Krishna and they all travel some distance before merging into Krishna. The biggest river Krishna River that flows across Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

<text>The Lubbock Cotton Kings were a professional ice hockey team formerly based in Lubbock, Texas as members of the Western Professional Hockey League and the Central Hockey League. The team played home games at City Bank Coliseum.

==History==
The Lubbock Cotton Kings played their first game in Lubbock Municipal Coliseum (later City Bank Coliseum) in October 1999. During the inaugural season, the Cotton Kings went 42–24–4 and lost in the second round of the Western Professional Hockey League (WPHL) playoffs. In the 2000–01 season, the Cotton Kings advanced to the WPHL Championship where they lost to the Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs.

After the WPHL merged with the Central Hockey League, the team only made one playoff appearance in the 2004–05 season.

===Suspended operations===
In June 2007, after the Cotton Kings failed to reach an agreement with the city of Lubbock for use of City Bank Coliseum, the Central Hockey League announced that the Cotton Kings must take a year off, suspending operations for the 2007–08 season. The team attempted to return to Lubbock or move to San Angelo, Texas, however, this never happened and the CHL folded seven years later.

<doc id="1008734" wikidata="Q1637975" url="?curid=1008734" title="Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla">
<text>Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla (or Saint Christopher, Nevis, and Anguilla) was a British colony in the West Indies from 1882 to 1983, consisting of the islands of Anguilla (until 1980), Nevis, and Saint Christopher (or Saint Kitts). From 1882 to 1951, and again from 1980, the colony was known simply as Saint Christopher and Nevis. Saint Christopher and Nevis gained independence in 1983 as the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, while Anguilla would remain a British overseas territory.

==History==

The islands of Saint Christopher and Nevis had been British colonies since the 17th century, though were always administered separately. A union of Saint Christopher and Nevis had been proposed as early as 1867, when Captain James George Mackenzie was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Saint Christopher with a mandate to seek an amalgamation of the administrations of the two islands. This proposal met with strong opposition, however, and was withdrawn the following year. In 1871, Saint Christopher and Nevis became presidencies within the Federal Colony of the Leeward Islands, with Anguilla being attached to Saint Christopher as a dependency in the same year. However, in 1882, the legislature of the Leeward Islands passed legislation merging the two presidencies, forming a combined Presidency of Saint Christopher and Nevis.

In 1951, the name of the colony was changed to include Anguilla. The Leeward Islands Colony was disbanded in 1958, due to frequent tension between its members. From 1958 to 1962, Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla formed a province of the West Indies Federation, electing two members to the House of Representatives and also having two senators, appointed by the Governor-General. In 1967, the territory of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla was granted full internal autonomy, as an Associated State of the United Kingdom. The UK retained responsibility for defence and external affairs, while a new judicial system was established, the West Indies Associated States Supreme Court (although the Privy Council remained the highest court of appeal). Later in 1967, Anguilla&#x27;s leaders expelled the Federation&#x27;s police from the island, and declared its independence as the Republic of Anguilla. On 7 November 1970, a commission led by Hugh Wooding, former Chief Justice of Trinidad and Tobago, published report which unanimously refused both the idea of independent Anguilla and the return of the status of a British colony and recommended that the island should instead remain a part of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla. The report was welcomed by Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw while the Council of Anguilla rejected it. Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister Joseph Godber stated in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom that his government will analyze the report in light of discussions with all interested parties and that no decision unacceptable to the people of Anguilla will be made. A series of interim agreements followed that resulted in direct rule of the island from Britain, although it was not formally separated until December 1980, when it was made a separate Crown colony.

Nevis had also attempted to separate from the federation on several occasions, but the island&#x27;s leaders were unsuccessful in their efforts. However, they did manage to secure greater autonomy for Nevis in the years leading up to independence, which occurred in September 1983 after a delay of several years to allow for negotiations. Sir Frederick Albert Phillips, the first governor of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla, wrote in 2013:

==Politics==

===List of administrators===

==Sport and culture==

The national football team debuted in 1938, in a friendly against Grenada, but played only sporadically. It has played more regularly since independence. In cricket, the Anguilla, Nevis, and Saint Kitts national teams competed separately at regional level, although combined teams were occasionally fielded in the past. Delegations from Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla were sent to several editions of the CARIFTA Games, winning medals in 1977 and 1983. At the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, the federation sent four competitors (two runners and two cyclists, all male), but failed to win a medal.

<text>Virunga National Park is a national park in the Albertine Rift Valley in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was created in 1925. In elevation, it ranges from in the Semliki River valley to in the Rwenzori Mountains. From north to south it extends approximately , largely along the international borders with Uganda and Rwanda in the east. It covers an area of .

Two active volcanoes, Mount Nyiragongo and Nyamuragira, are located in the park. They have significantly shaped the national park&#x27;s diverse habitats and wildlife. More than 3,000 faunal and floral species have been recorded, of which more than 300 are endemic to the Albertine Rift including eastern gorilla (&quot;Gorilla beringei&quot;) and golden monkey (&quot;Cercopithecus kandti&quot;). The park is also home to Tchegera Island.

In 1979, the national park was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its rich diversity of habitats, exceptional biodiversity and endemism, and its protection of rare mountain gorilla habitat. It has been listed in the List of World Heritage in Danger since 1994 because of civil unrest and increased human presence in the region.

There have been several deadly attacks in the park by rebel groups, and several park rangers have been killed.

== Politics ==
There have been plans to drill for oil in the Congo Basin since the 2000s. Preventing these plans the park gained further protection by an agreement sealed between DRCs president Felix Tshisekedi and Boris Johnson at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. To improve the country&#x27;s economic situation the government undermined that very protection by auctioning oil exploration blocks inside the park by the end of July 2022. Tullow Oil Plc, TotalEnergies, ENI and China National Offshore Oil Corporation Ltd (CNOOC) were interested in acquiring drilling permissions. Local and global groups, such as Greenpeace, are warning about the social and ecological impact of devastating the forest for oil production. Campaigners trying to create public awareness are threatened and intimidated on social media.

==History==
In the early 1920s, several proponents of the European conservation movement championed the idea of creating a protected area in northeastern Belgian Congo, among them Victor van Straelen, Jean Massart and Jean-Marie Derscheid. When Albert National Park was established in April 1925 as the Congo&#x27;s first national park, it was conceived as a science-oriented nature reserve with the aim of studying and preserving wildlife and so-called &quot;primitive&quot; hunter-gatherer African Pygmies. In 1926, Derscheid headed the first Belgian mission to map Albert National Park, which encompassed an area of around the extinct volcanoes Mount Karisimbi and Mount Mikeno. The protected area was extended in 1929 by Virunga National Park, which encompassed the Virunga Mountains, parts of the Rutshuru Territory, and the plains south of Lake Edward. Its initial size of was enlarged step by step in subsequent years. Indigenous people lost their traditional land rights in this process, and were evicted from the protected area. Between the late 1930s and 1955, an estimated 85,000 Rwandophone people were moved to nearby Masisi in North Kivu.

In 1934, the &quot;Institut des Parcs Nationaux du Congo Belge&quot; was founded as the governing body for national parks in the Belgian Congo.
Between the early 1930s and 1961, several expeditions to Albert National Park were carried out by Belgian scientists, the second headed by Gaston-François de Witte. They studied and collected zoological specimens of wildlife for the &quot;Musée Royal d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle de Belgique&quot;; explored the ethnic groups in this area; studied volcanic activity, and fossils.

In the late 1950s, Tutsi herders and their cattle entered the park, destroying natural habitat up to an altitude of , which was thought to threaten the park&#x27;s gorillas.

Land laws were reformed in the 1960s after Belgian Congo became independent as the Republic of the Congo, and the land declared property of the state, much to the disadvantage of local people. Illegal hunting inside protected areas increased. In 1969, the two parks were merged under the name Virunga National Park, which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.

In 1996, the national park was listed as a Ramsar site of international importance.

In 2011, the British company Soco International was granted a concession for extracting crude oil in the surroundings of and in large parts of the national park. Government officials supported exploration activities by Soco International mission members, whereas park management opposed. In the course of increasing tensions, the park&#x27;s chief warden, Emmanuel de Mérode, was assailed in April 2014.
Following international protests, the company stopped exploring activities and consented to refrain from starting similar operations in the vicinity of World Heritage sites.

In August 2015, the Minister of Tourism and Culture inaugurated four key initiatives including the tourist destination Tchegera Island and the Rugari–Bukima road section that facilitates access to the Mount Mikeno sector.
By 2016, four hydropower dams were constructed that provide electricity to small businesses and benefit more than 200,000 rural people.

=== Armed conflict ===
Since the early 1990s, the protected area was impacted by political turmoil in the African Great Lakes region. Following the Rwandan genocide, thousands of refugees fled to the Kivu region, and the presence of military increased. The First and Second Congo Wars further destabilised the region. Anti-poaching patrols inside the park were obstructed, and park personnel and wildlife were killed. About 850,000 refugees lived around the national park in 1994. Up to 40,000 people entered the park daily in search of firewood and food, and deforested huge areas. In 1994, Virunga National Park was entered into the List of World Heritage in Danger.

After the Second Congo War was over, confrontations between park personnel and rebel groups continued; 80 park staff were killed between 1996 and 2003.
Several armed rebel groups operate in the park, including Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and National Congress for the Defence of the People (FDLR). Latter controlled the Mikeno sector of Virunga National Park between December 2006 and January 2009.

In 2005, the European Commission (EC) recommended a public-private partnership between the country&#x27;s government and the British non-governmental organisation African Conservation Fund. The latter organisation is responsible for park management since 2010; about 80% of management costs are subsidised by the EC. Park protection efforts were militarised in the following years to deter armed rebel groups and poachers from operating inside the park. Park personnel are given paramilitary training and high-quality weaponry, and operate together with the military and state security services.

These tactics, criticised as &quot;militarization of conservation&quot;, has been blamed for further violence and dispossession faced by local indigenous people. Communities, such as the Mbuti, which previously relied on the lands included in the park for food and shelter have been forced out, or risk being arrested or killed by armed park rangers.

Increasing militarisation of nature conservation has been accused of fuelling armed mobilisation of militias. The inhabitants inside the national park, whether native or refugees, rely on farming, hunting, fishing, logging and producing charcoal for their livelihoods, all prohibited activities. The local community has nowhere else to turn for security, and relies on the protection of armed groups, for which fees are levied off the prohibited activities. According to a 2010 report by the United Nations Security Council, 80% of the charcoal consumed by the city of Goma is sourced from the park, representing an annual value of US$28–30 million. Both state security services and such groups also resort to armed robberies and kidnapping for income.

Efforts at nature conservation have had contradictory effects, for example when farms were destroyed within Kibirizi, and soldiers and park guards were sent in to patrol, people migrated even further within the park to land controlled by the FDLR, where they could rent small plots of land. Clashes occurred in 2015 when a local Mai-Mai group in Binza (north Bwisha) attempted to take back control of region, with the objective of reinstalling fishing activities and allowing the population to return, killing a park guard and 11-15 soldiers.

Five rangers were killed in August 2017 near Lake Edward in a militia attack. Five rangers and a driver were killed in April 2018. Since beginning of the armed conflict, armed groups killed 175 park rangers until April 2018. In May 2018, a ranger was killed when defending two tourists who were kidnapped. They were subsequently released unharmed. As a consequence, the park remained closed to visitors from June 2018 until February 2019.

In April 2020 at least 12 park rangers were killed by militia men attacking a civilian convoy. Again in January 2021, armed men killed at least six rangers and wounded several others in an ambush in the national park.

On 22 February 2021, Italy&#x27;s ambassador to the DRC who was travelling with the World Food Programme about 15 km north of Goma, Luca Attanasio, as well as Italian military police officer Vittorio Iacovacci and Congolese driver Moustapha Milambo, were killed in the gunfire when a militia that had kidnapped their convoy, and had brought them into the park, was met by park rangers who managed to free four people.

==Geography==

Virunga National Park is located in the Congo − Nile watershed area. Its northern sector encompasses part of the Semliki River basin, as well as savanna and montane forest of the Albertine Rift.
In altitude, this sector ranges from in the Puemba River valley to the highest peak of Mount Stanley at within . The national park&#x27;s central sector encompasses about two thirds of Lake Edward up to the international border with Uganda in the east. A narrow corridor of width along the lake&#x27;s western bank connects the northern and southern sectors of the national park. The southern sector stretches to the shores of Lake Kivu and encompasses Nyamulagira, Nyiragongo and Mikeno volcanoes with montane forests on their slopes.

The northern sector of Virunga National Park is contiguous with Uganda&#x27;s Semuliki park, the Rwenzori Mountains National Park, and the central sector with Queen Elizabeth National Park. The southern sector borders Rwanda&#x27;s Volcanoes National Park.

=== Climate ===
The climate in the Albertine Rift is influenced by the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. March to mid May and September to November are the main rainy seasons.
Mean monthly rainfall in the savanna around Lake Edward is ; this is the driest part of the landscape. The northern sector receives a monthly mean precipitation of up to , and the southern sector of up to .
Average temperatures in lower altitudes vary from , and in higher altitudes from , rarely dropping below .

==Flora==

Virunga National Park&#x27;s flora encompasses 2,077 plant species, including 264 tree species and 230 plants that are endemic to the Albertine Rift.
The plains of Virunga National Park are dominated by wetlands and grasslands with papyrus sedge (&quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot;), jointed flatsedge (&quot;C. articulatus&quot;), common reed (&quot;Phragmites mauritanica&quot;), sacaton grasses (&quot;Sporobolus consimilis&quot;), ambatch (&quot;Aeschynomene elaphroxylon&quot;), conkerberry (&quot;Carissa spinarum&quot;), paperbark thorn (&quot;Vachellia sieberiana&quot;) and kowai fruit (&quot;Coccinia grandis&quot;).
Remains of dicots such as African caper (&quot;Capparis tomentosa&quot;), &quot;Maerua&quot; species, wild cucurbits, and nightshades were found in dung balls of African elephants (&quot;Loxodonta&quot;) that play a significant role for seed dispersal in the grasslands.

The montane forest between in the southern sector is dominated by &quot;Ficalhoa laurifolia&quot; and &quot;Podocarpus milanjianus&quot; with up to high trees. African alpine bamboo (&quot;Yushania alpina&quot;) grows at altitudes of . The vegetation above is subalpine with foremost African redwood (&quot;Hagenia abyssinica&quot;) growing up to . Tree heath (&quot;Erica arborea&quot;), heather and mosses cover humid slopes up to elevation. &quot;Senecio&quot; and &quot;Lobelia&quot; species grow on vast clearings and attain heights of up to .

== Fauna ==

Virunga National Park&#x27;s faunal species include 196 mammals, 706 bird species, 109 reptiles and 65 amphibians as of 2012.

African bush elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;), hippopotamus (&quot;Hippopotamus amphibius&quot;) and African buffalo (&quot;Syncerus caffer&quot;) inhabit the national park&#x27;s central sector.
Okapi (&quot;Okapia johnstoni&quot;), blue duiker (&quot;Philantomba monticola&quot;), bay duiker (&quot;Cephalophus dorsalis&quot;), Weyns&#x27;s duiker (&quot;C. weynsi&quot;), yellow-backed duiker (&quot;C. silvicultor&quot;), water chevrotain (&quot;Hyemoschus aquaticus&quot;), red river hog (&quot;Potamochoerus porcus&quot;), aardvark (&quot;Orycteropus afer&quot;) and bongo (&quot;Tragelaphus eurycerus&quot;) were recorded in the northern sector in 2008.
Harnessed bushbuck (&quot;T. scriptus&quot;) and giant forest hog (&quot;Hylochoerus meinertzhageni&quot;) are present in the southern sector. All of the topi (&quot;Damaliscus lunatus jimela&quot;) cluster to the south of Lake Edward in the Ishasha Flats region, and regularly cross the border into Uganda. Other ungulates present include Ugandan kob (&quot;Kobus kob thomasi&quot;), waterbuck (&quot;K. ellipsiprymnus&quot;), and common warthog (&quot;Phacochoerus africanus&quot;).

Virunga National Park together with the adjacent Queen Elizabeth National Park forms a &quot;Lion Conservation Unit&quot;. The area is considered a potential lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;) stronghold, if poaching is curbed and prey species recover.
In the national park&#x27;s northern sector, African leopard (&quot;P. pardus pardus&quot;), marsh mongoose (&quot;Atilax paludinosus&quot;), giant pangolin (&quot;Smutsia gigantea&quot;), tree pangolin (&quot;Phataginus tricuspis&quot;), crested porcupine (&quot;Hystrix cristata&quot;), Lord Derby&#x27;s scaly-tailed squirrel (&quot;Anomalurus derbianus&quot;), Boehm&#x27;s bush squirrel (&quot;Paraxerus boehmi&quot;), western tree hyrax (&quot;Dendrohyrax dorsalis&quot;), Emin&#x27;s pouched rat (&quot;Cricetomys emini&quot;) and checkered elephant shrew (&quot;Rhynchocyon cirnei&quot;) were recorded during surveys in 2008.

<text>Kashtin were a Canadian folk rock duo in the 1980s and 1990s, one of the most commercially successful and famous musical groups in First Nations history.

==Career==

The band was formed in 1984 by Claude McKenzie and Florent Vollant, two Innu musicians from the Maliotenam reserve on the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec. The name &quot;Kashtin&quot; means &quot;tornado&quot; in the Innu-aimun language, but was also chosen as a pun on the English language phrase &quot;cashed in&quot;, in response to friends who alleged that the band was selling out by pursuing attention and success beyond their own community. They began as a cover band, performing songs by Pink Floyd, U2, Bob Dylan, Neil Young and The Beatles in Innu communities, before beginning to write and perform original material. Their music followed a mainstream folk rock style, but incorporated traditional Innu makushan drums. Around the same time as the launch of the band, Vollant and McKenzie were involved in the creation of Innu Nikamu, a music festival celebrating indigenous music.

In 1988 they were featured in a television documentary on the Innu people, increasing their public profile throughout Quebec. They were soon invited to Montreal by producer Guy Trépanier to record, and released their self-titled debut album in 1989. Although that album was recorded in their native Innu-aimun language, spoken by just 12,000 people in the world, the album quickly became a major hit in Quebec, Greenland and soon in English Canada as well, eventually being certified double platinum and winning the Prix Félix for Best Debut Album. The singles &quot;E Uassiuian&quot; and &quot;Tshinanu&quot; were popular hits for the band.

In 1990, the band toured Europe and made commercial breakthroughs there, most notably becoming Top 10 stars in France after performing there as an opening act for Louis Chedid. In the same year, however, they were briefly a subject of controversy when radio stations CKAC and CFGL-FM briefly stopped playing their music during the Oka crisis, although the stations eventually backed off following criticism of the move. 

In 1991, the band embarked on their first full cross-Canada tour in the spring and summer, and released their second album, &quot;Innu&quot;, in the fall. That album spawned the band&#x27;s biggest Canadian hit single, &quot;Ishkuess&quot;, and included a cover of Willie Dunn&#x27;s &quot;Son of the Sun&quot;, the only song the band ever recorded in English. The album was a shortlisted Juno Award nominee for the Best World Beat Recording and Best Roots and Traditional Album awards at the Juno Awards of 1992. 

In 1992, they were featured in an episode of CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Ear to the Ground&quot;, and headlined the televised concert &quot;Indian Time II: Fly With Eagles&quot;. The following year, McKenzie was arrested for impaired driving, and spent several months in jail in 1994.

For their third album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Akua Tuta&quot;, Kashtin signed with Columbia Records. Robbie Robertson included the title track from that album on his album &quot;Music for The Native Americans&quot;. Their songs also appeared on the soundtracks to the film &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot; and the television shows &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; and &quot;Due South&quot;, and the album received a Juno Award nomination for Best Aboriginal Recording at the Juno Awards of 1995.

Following &quot;Akua Tuta&quot;, Vollant announced that he wanted to take a break from music, and McKenzie released his debut solo album &quot;Innu Town&quot; in 1996, while Vollant reemerged in 1999 with the solo album &quot;Nipaiamianan&quot;. They have not released another album as Kashtin, although they have continued to perform occasional live shows together. They also collaborated with hip hop musician Samian on his 2010 remake of &quot;Tshinanu&quot;.

<text>The General Post Office, Mumbai, is the central post office of the city of Mumbai, India. The post office handles most of the city&#x27;s inbound and outbound mail and parcels. Situated in the vicinity of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, the Mumbai General Post Office (GPO) is a paradigm of Indo-Saracenic architecture.

Mumbai GPO is one of the five Philatelic Bureaus in the country (others being Chennai GPO, Kolkata GPO, Parliament Street, and New Delhi GPO) that are authorised to sell the United Nations stamps.

==The building==
The GPO is modelled on the Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur, Karnataka. It was designed by British architect John Begg, a consultant architect to the British government. Begg designed the structure in 1902, and construction began on 1 September 1904. It was completed on 13 March 1913 at a cost of 1,809,000. Black basalt, with a dressing of yellow Kurla stone and white stones from Dhrangdra are the predominant materials used.

The building has an area of 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) and replaced the current Central Telegraph Office at Flora Fountain as the new GPO. The chief feature of the architecture of this building is an ethereal central hall which rises up to the great dome.

==Operations==

As the chief post office of the city, the GPO handles huge volumes of mail and passes them on to other post offices in the city. The GPO has the Postal Index Number (PIN) 400 001. Due to its proximity to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Mumbai&#x27;s central station, it is ideally situated to dispatch and receive mail to and from other cities in India. It also controls the smaller post offices in Mumbai, issues stamps, and prints new inland letterheads and postcards. It also has a philately section for enthusiasts.

==War memorial==

A war memorial plaque commemorating the Post Office of India employees in the service of the British Indian Army who died in the First World War exists in the building.

==GPO construction plaque==
This plaque indicates the date of completion of the building in 1913. The total cost was 1,809,000.

<text>Pierre Le Gloan (6 January 1913 – 11 September 1943) was a French flying ace of World War II. Unique in the annals of wartime flying, he scored victories against German, Italian and British forces. Flying in the French and Vichy French air forces, his career has led some to call him the only pilot to become a flying ace on both sides of the war. He was killed in a landing accident in September 1943.
==Early years==
Pierre Le Gloan was born on 6 January 1913 in Kergrist-Moëlou, Brittany, France. The commune in France where he lived has a street that bears his name. During his teen years, he won a civil aviation scholarship, funded by the French government, which gave him his first real taste of flying. Le Gloan applied to a civilian aviation school, intending to follow a career in aviation.

==Military career==
At the age of 18, Le Gloan joined the French Air Force. At the outbreak of the war, as part of the air defence of Paris and the lower Seine, he served in the GC III/6 fighter squadron, flying the Morane-Saulnier MS.406 from Chartres. With his wingman, on 23 November 1939, Le Gloan shot down his first German aircraft, a Do 17P reconnaissance bomber. A second Dornier fell to him on 2 March 1940, and during the Battle of France, Le Gloan accounted for two Heinkel He 111 bombers.

During the winter of 1939–1940, GC III/6 was based at Wez-Thuizy near Rheims, but saw little action. In April 1940, the unit was assigned to protect Belgium, but soon moved again to Chissey, near the Alps with the French VIII Army. When a German attack in Belgium necessitated moving back to that theatre, this time to patrol the Lille-Bapaume-Cambrai area.

On 1 June 1940, Le Gloan&#x27;s squadron was moved towards southern France to Le Luc airfield and re-equipped with the new Dewoitine D.520 fighters. Their mission was to protect the port of Toulon.

Following Italy&#x27;s declaration of war on France and the Italian air force commencing bombing raids, Le Gloan shot down two Fiat BR.20 bombers on 13 June. On 15 June Le Gloan with another pilot attacked 12 Italian Fiat CR.42 fighters. Le Gloan shot down three of them while Cpt. Assolent shot down another. While returning to the airfield Le Gloan shot down another CR.42 and a BR.20 bomber. For this outstanding achievement of destroying five aircraft in one flight he was promoted to 2nd lieutenant.

Due to the military situation of France on 20 June GC III/6 was withdrawn to Algiers in Algeria. After the armistice between France and Germany, and the subsequent British attacks on the French navy, French forces in North Africa, including Le Gloan&#x27;s unit, became subordinated to the Vichy government.

In May 1941 GC III/6 was moved to the French colony of Syria. In June 1941, Allied forces, including some Free French units, attacked Syria and Lebanon. On 8 June 1941, Le Gloan shot down his first RAF fighter, a Hawker Hurricane. By 5 July he had claimed five Hurricanes and a Gloster Gladiator. Later the depleted GC III/6 was withdrawn back to Algiers.

During Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942, French fighter squadrons based in Algiers, unlike those in Oran or Casablanca, did not oppose the Allied landings. Soon all French forces in North Africa had sided with the Allies. In May 1943 Le Gloan&#x27;s unit, then renamed GC 3/6 &quot;Roussillon&quot;, was re-armed with new Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters. In August Le Gloan took the command of 3rd &quot;escadrille&quot; (flight) of the squadron. The unit&#x27;s primary task at the time were offshore patrols.

On 11 September 1943, Le Gloan flew on patrol with another pilot. Over the sea smoke started to come out of Le Gloan&#x27;s engine. He returned towards the shore but the engine stopped. He attempted a forced landing on the shore but, probably forgetting that his Airacobra still had an underbelly fuel tank attached (which were not used on earlier French fighters), the fuel in his plane exploded while trying to land, killing him instantly.

During his complicated combat career Pierre Le Gloan shot down 18 aircraft (four German, seven Italian and seven British), which made him the fourth leading French flying aces of the war.

<text>Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche () is a lama in the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism and abbot of the Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre, Scotland, the first and largest of its kind in the West.

==Early years==

Born in 1943 into a farming family in Kham, East Tibet, he was given the name &quot;Jamphel Drakpa&quot;, or &quot;Jamdrak&quot; for short. He spent his early childhood close to nature helping with the family sheep and yaks and playing with the other children in the village; the children received no education as such. This changed when at 12 years old he was selected to go with his elder brother Choje Akong Rinpoche—who had been recognised as a tulku by the 16th Karmapa—to the Dolma Lhakang Monastery where he was to receive an education. Although Akong was only three years older than Jamdrak, it was the tradition that where a tulku is the abbot of a monastery one of his brothers goes to assist him. It is claimed that many auspicious signs had been seen when Jamdrak was born and he had also been recognised as a tulku, but not officially confirmed due to the political turbulence of the time. At Dolma Lhakang Jamdrak was a reluctant but diligent scholar under a succession of lamas, but his studies were interrupted by the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1959.

==Escape to India==
Jamdrak set off with his brother in a party of 300 to flee Tibet. As the Chinese occupied Lhasa the party was forced to take an alternative route which involved a perilous journey across the Himalaya mountains. The arduous journey involved high altitudes, raging rivers, evading capture and near starvation. Of the three hundred that set off only thirteen, including Jamdrak and his brother Akong Rinpoche arrived safely in India. The others were killed, captured or died of starvation.

Even in India the refugees were not safe. Another of Jamdrak&#x27;s elder brothers died of tuberculosis, and he suffered from smallpox and tuberculosis himself. He survived but only after major surgery involving the removal of one of his lungs.

He continued his education at the Young Lamas Home School in Dalhousie, where he was groomed for a well paid post as an administrator of a large Tibetan settlement in India.

He did indeed briefly take up this post before leaving in 1967 to serve as private secretary to the 16th Karmapa at Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim. Although still a layperson he had a privileged position receiving teachings from high lamas.

==Rebellious youth==
He later described himself during his time in India as &quot;selfish and full of pride&quot;, and later &quot;surly and miserable&quot;. He developed a love of cars—never having seen one until he was 15—and survived a series of crashes.

Meeting young American Peace Corps volunteers, Jamdrak became curious about the West. With the help of Chögyam Trungpa and Akong Rinpoche he obtained a visa and plane ticket to travel to Samye Ling in Scotland in 1969.

His arrival in 1960s Britain coincided with the peak of the hippie movement. Jamdrak mixed with the young, rich and famous people flocking to Samye Ling, and he shared their hedonistic lifestyle with enthusiasm. His brother, busy running the monastery, tolerated his excesses hoping that he would grow out of them eventually.

The turning point for Jamdrak was a fishing trip to Orkney with a friend. With his Buddhist upbringing, he was uncomfortable with the idea of fishing but he went along with it to please his friend and soon caught many fish, which his friend killed with a blow to the head. His friend took a proud picture of all the dead fish and showed this to Akong Rinpoche on their return. Akong Rinpoche was deeply sad at seeing this picture—killing is against all the tenets of Buddhism—and lamented how he had promised their parents he would look after his younger brother and felt that he had failed.

This turned the heart of the young rebel back to the Buddha Dharma. He heard that the Karmapa was going to the United States at the invitation of Chögyam Trungpa, and requested that he be allowed to join him on a tour of the United States and Canada. On the tour a Chinese benefactor donated a large tract of land for a Buddhist centre in New York. Jamdrak was appointed secretary and treasurer. With many visiting lamas, Jamdrak had the opportunity to establish the preliminary practises of the four foundations. Wishing to take his practise further he became a monk in 1980, and was ordained by the 16th Karmapa, and named Yeshe Losal.

==Long retreat==
Yeshe Losal practised hard and retreated in a small quiet cottage. Soon the tranquility was shattered by building work on a nearby shrine room and it became increasingly uncomfortable as electricity, water and sanitation were disconnected. Remembering the trials of Milarepa, Yeshe Losal carried on with his practice. Moreover, beavers built a nest beneath his retreat house while raccoons and skunks fighting over territory left stinking reminders of their presence. After five years of retreat and enduring many hardships he emerged and was recognised as a lama. It has been said that his body was almost skeletal, but his mind crystal clear.

Akong Rinpoche requested that Lama Yeshe move to Purelands, a purpose-built retreat centre at Samye Ling, and in time he became the retreat master in 1988. At Akong Rinpoche&#x27;s request, in 1995 Lama Yeshe was confirmed as abbot of Samye Ling by the Tai Situpa.
==Holy Isle==
In 1990 Kay Morris came to Samye Ling with a strange request. She was the owner of Holy Isle a small island near the Isle of Arran in the Firth of Clyde. She wished to sell the Island and had had a vision of Mary, the mother of Jesus who asked her to approach the Buddhists at Samye Ling. Lama Yeshe visited the island in December and felt an immediate affinity for the rugged landscape, reminiscent of his homeland. Looking out over the lights of Lamlash bay, he was reminded of a vision he had while practising dream yoga on retreat. He had experienced flying over a beautiful island surrounded by lights. In April 1992 the Holy Isle was bought by the Rokpa Trust. Since then Lama Yeshe has been instrumental in establishing the Centre for World Peace and Health, an environmentally designed residential venue for courses, conferences and retreats on Holy Island, and a monastery on the southern end of the Island for nuns on three year retreats.

The island is a sanctuary for wild life, and Lama Yeshe is active in promoting the case for Lamlash Bay to be &quot;no take zone&quot;, a wildlife reserve for marine life, perhaps an echo of his own life-changing fishing trip.

<doc id="1008761" wikidata="Q4690709" url="?curid=1008761" title="Aftercare (BDSM)">
<text>Aftercare refers to the process of providing emotional, psychological, and/or physical support to participants following BDSM activities. These activities can be mentally, emotionally, and/or physically intense, often leaving participants in need of comfort, reassurance, or physical tenderness. Aftercare may also involve a review or debriefing of the session to reflect on the experience and address any concerns and/or successes.

==Overview==
Participants may experience a range of emotions after a scene, from exhilaration to exhaustion or, in some cases, distress. While aftercare often includes physical closeness, such as hugging, kissing, hair-stroking, or cuddling, it can also involve verbal affirmations, gratitude, or even &quot;vanilla&quot; sexual activities like fellatio. Additionally, some participants may prefer to be alone or other ways of processing their experiences, particularly if they feel unsafe or need rest.

Contrary to common assumptions, aftercare is not limited to submissive participants alone. Dominant participants may require equal or greater levels of support depending on the intensity of the scene, their experience, and personal needs. The need for aftercare is highly individual and unrelated to a participant&#x27;s role as dominant or submissive.

In long-distance BDSM relationships, aftercare can include the exchange of emotionally significant items to provide reassurance and maintain connection. The effectiveness of such practices depends on the emotional investment of both parties.

== Emotional after-effects ==
Emotional responses to BDSM activities can vary significantly, ranging from euphoria to feelings of sadness or depression. While these responses are not exclusive to BDSM, studies highlight the prevalence of such experiences. For instance, research published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that 46% of women and 41% of men polled reported feeling depressed after sex at least once in their lives. Although these studies were conducted on a limited population, they emphasize the importance of addressing emotional aftereffects as part of aftercare.

== Building trust and communication ==
Trust and communication are foundational to BDSM practices. Partners are encouraged to clearly express their desires, establish boundaries, and agree on a safeword or signal to stop activities if necessary. Aftercare, which often includes affectionate and caretaking behaviors, is essential for decompressing after a scene and strengthening intimacy between participants. These practices not only promote emotional recovery but also help reinforce trust through post-scene discussions, allowing partners to address what worked and what didn&#x27;t.

== Common aftercare practices ==
Aftercare practices can vary widely depending on individual preferences and the intensity of the BDSM scene. Some common practices include:

Cuddling: Cuddling is a low-energy activity that helps release oxytocin, a hormone known for reducing stress and increasing intimacy.

Rehydration and Snacks: Drinking water and having snacks nearby can replenish energy and provide comfort after an intense scene.

Addressing Minor Injuries: For those engaging in more extreme forms of BDSM, such as blood or knife play, aftercare may involve disinfecting and patching up wounds to ensure safety and well-being.

Sleeping Together: Taking a nap or sleeping together fosters intimacy and physical connection, often accompanied by more cuddling.

Watching a Movie: A lighthearted or funny movie offers a way to relax completely while sharing cuddles and snacks.

Recounting the Scene: Partners may discuss the scene, sharing what they liked, disliked, or wish to try in the future. This communication builds trust and ensures mutual understanding.

Kissing or Slow Sex: For some, slow and sensual sexual activity can function as a form of aftercare, helping reconnect participants to themselves and their partner rather than their roles during the scene.

Words of Affirmation: Affirming your partner by telling them they are loved and safe, or praising their performance, can provide reassurance and emotional support.

Massage: Gentle massages, accompanied by soothing music and dim lighting, allow partners to wind down while sharing physical affection.

Pierre Lachenay, a middle-aged married father and well-known writer, lecturer, and editor of a literary magazine, takes a plane to Lisbon. As he disembarks, photographers approach Pierre and ask him to pose for a picture with Nicole, a young stewardess.

After delivering a lecture in a sold-out auditorium, Pierre returns to his hotel, which is also where Nicole is staying. He shares the elevator with her and then, having noticed the room number on her key, calls her from his room to ask if she would like to get a drink. She declines, but, shortly after hanging up, calls back. They agree to go out for drinks the following evening, even though Pierre had been scheduled to catch a plane at noon.

On their date, Pierre and Nicole talk in a bar until sunrise, and then return to their hotel and have sex. She slips him her phone number on the flight back to Paris, and Pierre tries to call Nicole that night while he and his wife Franca are entertaining friends. However, Nicole is not at home.

When Pierre gets hold of Nicole the next day, they meet up. He begins to use excuses to get away and meet Nicole at the airport between her flights. They arrange to spend the night together, though not at her apartment, as the landlady knows her parents. They go to a nightclub and plan to stay at a hotel, but they do not check in, as the circumstances begin to make them feel sordid. Pierre takes Nicole home and invites her to go on an overnight trip to Reims the following week. She agrees, and, not wanting him to return to Franca, invites Pierre up to her apartment.

Pierre and Nicole drive to Reims and check in to a hotel. He only agreed to his friend Clément&#x27;s request to introduce a screening of Marc Allégret&#x27;s 1951 documentary &quot;Avec André Gide&quot; so he could be alone with Nicole. However, he has to go to a dinner, give his speech, and then go out for drinks with Clément, while Nicole sits alone at the hotel, cannot get tickets to the sold-out screening, and is repeatedly propositioned by a man in the street. To avoid going to a reception after the screening, Pierre says that he has to return to Paris, but then Clément asks for a ride. Pierre agrees, only to ditch Clément and get Nicole from the hotel.

After driving through the night, Pierre and Nicole reach an inn. They enjoy themselves, until Pierre calls Franca to say that he had to extend his stay in Reims and learns that she knows that he is lying. Pierre drops Nicole off at her apartment and goes home, where Franca accuses him of having an affair. He says that he just needed time alone, but she does not believe him and says that they should separate. Calling Franca&#x27;s bluff, Pierre does not argue and goes to sleep at his office.

Franca informs Pierre that she is initiating divorce proceedings. When he goes to get his things, she vacillates between treating him coolly, hitting him, begging him for forgiveness, and kissing him. They end up having sex. As Pierre is leaving, Franca asks if he wants to return to her, but he replies that it would never work. Franca&#x27;s friend Odile later sees the state Franca is in. Odile fears that Franca may attempt suicide and throws away sleeping pills she finds in the bathroom.

At a restaurant, Pierre gets embarrassed by Nicole&#x27;s loud talking, and she asks him to take her home. Pierre apologizes and says that he has had a hard week and that he misses seeing his daughter. When Pierre later shows Nicole the apartment he plans for them to share, she says that she has realized that they are incompatible and breaks off their relationship. Meanwhile, Franca uses a receipt from the pocket of one of Pierre&#x27;s jackets to pick up photographs taken by Pierre and Nicole on their romantic weekend. Franca then goes to a restaurant that Pierre frequents, tosses the photos at him, and shoots him with a shotgun. Dropping the weapon, she sits down and smiles.

==Cast==
The film&#x27;s screenwriters both have uncredited cameos: François Truffaut is the voice of the employee at the gas station at which Pierre and Nicole stop on the way to Reims, and Jean-Louis Richard is the man who incurs Franca&#x27;s wrath after accosting her on the street in Paris.

===Reception===
It received generally positive reviews from critics upon its release, however, and its stature has continued to grow over the years. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 89% based on reviews from 28 critics, with an average score of 7.8/10.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;uncannily prophetic&quot;, and J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote a glowing review of the film, in which he said: &quot;François Truffaut&#x27;s fourth feature, &quot;The Soft Skin&quot;, has never gotten much respect -- even though many people (myself included) regard it as one of his best.&quot; Conversely, Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote that &quot;Francois Truffaut&#x27;s latest film is a failure. His triangle story is disappointingly trite in every regard and the conclusion, alas, is laughingly melodramatic.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
===Home media===
The film was released on home video in the United States by The Criterion Collection, which described it as a &quot;complex, insightful, and underseen French New Wave treasure&quot;.

<doc id="1008763" wikidata="Q229747" url="?curid=1008763" title="Erica Durance">
<text>Erica Durance (; born June 21, 1978) is a Canadian actress known for her roles as Lois Lane in the superhero television series &quot;Smallville&quot; (2004–2011) and as Dr. Alex Reid in the medical drama series &quot;Saving Hope&quot; (2012–2017). She has also appeared in films such as &quot;The Untold&quot; (2002), &quot;The Butterfly Effect 2&quot; (2006), &quot;Final Verdict&quot; (2009) and &quot;Painkillers&quot; (2015).

==Early life==
Durance was born in Calgary to parents Gail and Joel Durance and grew up on a turkey farm with her older brother and sister in Three Hills, Alberta, Canada. Durance moved to Vancouver in 1999 to pursue her interest in acting professionally and study at the Yaletown Actors Lab. 

==Career==
Durance began her career with background work. She appeared in commercials for Kokanee Beer. She has guest-starred in television series, including &quot;Andromeda&quot;, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Harry&#x27;s Law&quot; and &quot;Private Eyes&quot;.

In 2004, Durance was cast in her breakout role as Lois Lane on the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;. Durance was acting part-time and working as an agent for background actors and booking photo doubles for TV series and had considered quitting acting. &quot;I was at a point in my life where I was a bit frustrated with the business,&quot; Durance said. &quot;[my manager] had to talk me into going out for it.&quot; Producer Kelly Souders said they knew Durance was Lois for the series after seeing her casting tape, &quot;there were a lot of wonderful actresses who came in for the role but I remember the entire writing staff watching her tape and just saying, that&#x27;s her. She had everything. She had attitude but she was loveable and brought all of it in her audition tape.&quot; Durance played a sassy, teenage Lois in season four in a recurring role. She was promoted to series regular in season five and became part of the &quot;Smallville&quot; cast. She played the character for seven seasons. &quot;Everyone has their specific idea of who Lois Lane is for them, and you have your overall blueprint, but then you have to try to make it your own. That&#x27;s the only way to try to stay truthful to what you&#x27;re doing,&quot; Durance on playing Lois Lane. 

In 2012, Durance began starring in the lead role in the CTV medical drama television series &quot;Saving Hope&quot;, as Chief Surgical Dr. Alex Reid. She was also a producer on the series and directed the season four episode &quot;Torn and Frayed&quot;. In season 3, Durance&#x27;s real-life pregnancy was worked into her character Alex Reid and the series. &quot;Saving Hope&quot; ended its run in 2017.

Durance appeared in the television series &quot;Supergirl&quot; in a recurring role as Kara&#x27;s Kryptonian mother, Alura Zor-El. In 2019, Durance and her &quot;Smallville&quot; co-star Tom Welling reprised their roles as Lois and Clark in the &quot;Batwoman&quot; episode of the Arrowverse crossover event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

Durance has appeared in several Lifetime and Hallmark films, including &quot;I Me Wed&quot; (2007), &quot;Wedding Planner Mystery&quot; (2014), &quot;Color My World with Love&quot; (2022) and &quot;A Scottish Love Scheme&quot; (2024).

==Personal life==
Durance was previously married to Wesley Parker. In 2001, she began dating Canadian actor David Palffy and married him in 2005. The couple amicably separated in April 2023. Durance and Palffy have two sons. She also has a stepson from her husband&#x27;s previous relationship.

Durance is a supporter of World Vision Canada. In August 2006, she co-hosted the Superman/Batman #26 art auction with Jeph Loeb at the Wizard World Chicago convention. The auction raised $70,000. The event honored Loeb&#x27;s son, Sam Loeb, who died at age 17 after a long battle with bone cancer, and all of its proceeds went to the Sam Loeb College Scholarship Fund.

==Accolades==
Durance was ranked No. 38 on &quot;FHM&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Sexiest Women in the World&quot; in 2006 and #20 in 2007, #15 in 2008, and #14 in 2009. She has also appeared on the cover of &quot;FHM&quot; and &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine. In 2009, Durance was on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Sci-fi Hotties Women. BuddyTV ranked her #26 on its TV&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Women of 2009, and #16 on its 2010 list. In 2012, BuddyTV ranked Durance #9 on their list of Summer 2012&#x27;s Sexiest Stars. &quot;Hello!&quot; magazine listed her as one of Canada&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People in 2012.
