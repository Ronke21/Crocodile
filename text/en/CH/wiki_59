<text>Lions Bay (, ) is a small residential community in British Columbia, Canada, located between Vancouver and Squamish on the steep eastern shore of Howe Sound. In the 2021 census the community had a population of 1,390, BC&#x27;s 36th smallest municipality by population. At , it is BC&#x27;s 10th smallest municipality by land area. Originally a boat-access summer camping destination for Vancouverites, Lions Bay began to be permanently settled in the 1960s. The community incorporated as a village municipality in January 1971.

== History ==
In 1889, distinctive twin peaks in the North Shore mountains were dubbed the Lions by a Judge Gray, for their supposed resemblance from Vancouver to the lion statues around Nelson&#x27;s Column on London&#x27;s Trafalgar Square. They are the Transformed Sisters, Ch&#x27;ich&#x27;iyúy Elxwíkn, of Coast Salish legend. The small bay on Howe Sound where pre-road climbers were dropped off to climb them was the &quot;Lions Bay.&quot;

The extensions of the CN railway in 1954 and Highway 99 in 1958 spurred permanent residences, the area having previously mostly been summer cottages. In the 1960s, Lions Bay became a Water Improvement District. In 1999 Lions Bay amalgamated with the neighbouring unincorporated community of Brunswick Beach.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lions Bay had a population of 1,390 living in 506 of its 557 total private dwellings, an increase of from its 2016 population of 1,334. With a land area of , population density was .

==Amenities==
Lions Bay Beach Park has restroom and change facilities, a sandy beach protected by a log boom, and a float. Pay parking is available.

The Kelvin Grove Beach and Marine park 500 meters south also has a restroom and is a popular scuba destination and dog beach.

In the 2017–18 school year, School District 45&#x27;s Lions Bay School had about 30 K-3 pupils, down from peak levels in prior years of 60–80. After Grade 3, public school students bus to the K-7 Gleneagles Elementary (approx. 60 Lions Bay students out of 240) and the Grade 8–12 Rockridge Secondary (approx. 80 students from Lions Bay out of 800).

Volunteer-maintained trails run through the community, and there is multi-day pay parking available at the Sunset North trailhead.

Commercial amenities include a general store with Rural Liquor Outlet, a café (including on-tap beers for on-premise consumption), a real estate office, a 150-boat dry-storage marina and a marine service centre.

==Infrastructure==
Under license from the Province, water is drawn at intake weirs on Harvey and Magnesia Creeks, and disinfected in two modern dual-barrier (UV and chlorine) treatment plants. Supply is sufficient for a consumption on the order of per day in winter and per day in summer (a relatively high per-capita consumption rate regionally). With no reservoirs possible in the steep terrain, and climate projections calling for longer, hotter summers with more-intense rainfall, a long-range study underway in partnership with UBC&#x27;s Civil Engineering department is modelling hydrological characteristics of the snowfields and groundwater catchments above the village, both to know when to implement short-term consumption restrictions, and to understand long-term flow trends to have time to plan for deep wells, additional creek intakes or pipelining. In 2017 the municipality purchased the last piece of available waterfront land to hold in long-term reserve for a future peak-shaving desalination plant.

100 houses in the Kelvin Grove neighbourhood are on central sewer connected to a small secondary treatment plant renewed in 2020; remaining residences and businesses rely on individual onsite wastewater systems.

As a member of the regional TransLink public transit network, Lions Bay is served by the hourly 262 bus route. The provincial Sea-to-Sky Highway (four lanes and three overpass/underpass intersections) and CN Rail (three at-grade road crossings) run through the community.

Lions Bay is not supplied with natural gas (the pipeline runs to the north, from Coquitlam over the North Shore mountains to Squamish), so wintertime heating is by baseboard and underfloor electrical resistance heating at standard tariffs, heat pumps, oil furnaces and propane for houses with forced air ducting, and wood heat in appliances ranging from open fireplaces to airtights and pellet stoves. Despite occasionally poor wintertime air quality, Lions Bay negotiated reduced compliance with regional wood appliance regulations that started in 2019.

==Geography==

=== Geology ===
Local geology comprises lower-Cretaceous Gambier Group marine sedimentary and volcanic bedrock. Upslope, the headwaters of Magnesia, Alberta and Harvey Creeks are underlain by mid-Cretaceous era &quot;Coast Plutonic Complex&quot; rock, which has intruded into the older Gambier rocks. Outcrops primarily consist of greenish volcanic rock that is highly fractured (10 cm fracture spacing) with red oxidation on exposed surfaces. Prominent northwest trending faults and jointing create structural discontinuities that cause instability.

=== Geomorphology ===
Geomorphology in the area is a product of recent glaciation and post-glacial erosion. The last, or Fraser, glaciation began 33,500 years ago and reached its peak 17,500 years ago. Ice retreat was delayed several thousand years by floating glaciers grounding on the seabed, with several minor readvances. Glacial marine sedimentation (mud and rock dropped from icebergs) is believed to have ceased by 10,600 years before present. The weight of ice had depressed the land surface, so during deglaciation the sea flooded the land up to 220 m higher than it is today. Sea-level fell rapidly as the land rebounded, such that by about 10,000 years ago sea level was 10 m below present. By 5700 years ago it was at approximately modern levels. With the ice gone, water erosion and mass wasting (debris slides and flows, rockfall, avalanches) rapidly reworked unstable glacial sediments, declining over time such that by no later than 7,500 years ago the landscape was similar to today. Steep rockfall aprons developed on mid to lower slopes. Magnesia, Alberta and Harvey Creeks reincised their debris cones and alluvial fans have formed at their mouths into the ocean.

=== Climate ===
Howe Sound at Lions Bay experiences a maritime climate with a moderate temperature regime and a winter precipitation peak. Temperatures are cool December through February, and warm July and August. A pronounced precipitation peak starts in October and extends through January. Precipitation increases with elevation due to orographic uplift, because air masses condense when they cool as pressure drops when they are driven upward by mountain slopes. Annually, approximately 2000 mm of precipitation falls at sea-level, increasing to 4000 mm at the ridge crest 1200 to 1400 m above. At mid and high elevations, both rain and rain-on-snow are important drivers of winter runoff and groundwater recharge, both being quantified in the Lions Bay-UBC Long-Range Hydrology Study.

==Government &amp; politics==
Lions Bay is a self-governing municipality with an elected mayor and four councillors setting policy. Execution of policy and administration is managed by a chief administrative officer through five staff working out of the municipal offices, and five at the Frank Smith Works Yard. The village&#x27;s Klatt Public Safety Building houses the 30-volunteer Fire Department, an ambulance station leased to the BC Ambulance Service, and Lions Bay Search &amp; Rescue. Policing is provided by the Squamish RCMP detachment. Lions Bay is part of the Metro Vancouver Regional District, although does not currently participate in its water, drainage or sewer functions. The mayor is a member of Mayors&#x27; Council, one of Translink&#x27;s several quasi-governing bodies.

In 2018 Lions Bay&#x27;s average residential non-rural property assessment of $1.62 million was the fourth-highest of all assessment areas in the province, behind only the University Endowment Lands ($3.51 million), West Vancouver ($3.24 million) and Anmore ($1.65 million).

In the 2017 provincial election, 567 of Lions Bay&#x27;s approx. 1000 eligible voters voted 43% Liberal (centre-right), 28% Green, and 18% NDP (left). Politics besides, Lions Bayers tend to support environmental causes, such as the UNESCO Biosphere initiative for Howe Sound and glass-sponge reef protection, and are generally opposed to reindustrialisation of Howe Sound (such as Woodfibre LNG, McNabb Creek gravel mining and clearcut wood harvesting).

The municipality is small, with a 2017 operating budget of $3.3 million (raised 50% by property taxes and 50% by fees plus grants). 2017 average per-parcel taxes, utility and fees of $7,647 were the 2nd highest in BC. The 2017 operating budget was:
* $1.2 mil. for 11.15 staff
* $819,000 water operating cost ($1,420 per connection)
* $416,000 volunteer fire department ($720 per residence)
* $865,000 everything else.

Capital spending is funded by federal and provincial grants, debt, and occasionally taxation when the spend is overdue. In 2017, for example, a $2.71 million capital project to replace and remove four water tanks and improve water distribution network was 50% funded by the federal government, 33% by the provincial government, and 17% by 30-year debt funding for the local contribution (with 92% voter approval in a referendum).

=== Lions Bay Fire Rescue ===
A volunteer fire department with 30+ trained members provides in-village and forest interface firefighting and MVA rescue services on Highway 99. Many members go on to permanent roles at professional departments; a training at Lions Bay Fire Rescue is considered one of the best available in western Canada.

=== Lions Bay Search And Rescue ===
Lions Bay Search And Rescue was established in the 1980s following a series of landslides which caused a number of deaths and briefly cut the highway and isolated the village. Although initially set up to provide the village with a measure of self-sufficiency in an emergency, the SAR team has developed over time into a primarily mountain rescue group. Trails and peaks accessible from Lions Bay attract large numbers of hikers and climbers, especially in warmer months. Hiking trails in the area are demanding; a hike from Lions Bay to the top of the West Lion gains 1500 meters in elevation with a round trip travel time of 6–8 hours for fit hikers. Every year an increasing number of hikers are injured, lost or caught out in the dark while hiking in this area, increasing demand on Lions Bay Search and Rescue in cooperation with the Provincial Emergency Program.

== Geographic names around Lions Bay ==
* In 1792, Capt. Vancouver named Howe Sound for Adm. Richard Howe, and Anvil Island for its shape.
* In 1857–1861, Capt. Richards of the survey sloop HMS Plumper named many features in Howe Sound after the ships and officers of Howe&#x27;s 1 June 1794 naval battle (&quot;The Glorious First&quot;) against the First French Republic during the French Revolutionary wars:
** Mt. Harvey, Harvey Creek, Mt. Brunswick and Brunswick Beach for Capt. John Harvey of HMS Brunswick
** Gambier Island for Capt. James Gambier, and the Defense Islands for his ship, HMS Defence
** Bowyer Island for Adm. George Bowyer, whose flagship was HMS Barfleur under Capt. Cuthbert Collingwood, commemorated in Barfleur Passage between Keats and Pasely Islands, and Collingwood Channel, between Keats and Bowen Islands. Captain Sir Richard Goodwin Keats was not present at the Glorious First, but a well known Royal Navy officer of the day.
** Bowen Island for James Bowen, master of HMS Queen Charlotte, and Pasely Island for Rear-Admiral Thomas Pasley on HMS Bellerophon.
* Alberta Bay, Alberta Creek: perhaps after the province, which was named for a daughter of Queen Victoria.
* Kelvin Grove, a mid-1980s developer name, ultimately from Glasgow&#x27;s Kelvin river.

<doc id="1028178" wikidata="Q53939" url="?curid=1028178" title="Françoise Hardy">
<text>Françoise Madeleine Hardy (; 17 January 1944 – 11 June 2024) was a French singer-songwriter who was known for singing melancholic, sentimental ballads. Hardy rose to prominence in the early 1960s as a leading figure in French yé-yé music and became a cultural icon in France and internationally. In addition to her native French, she also sang in English, Italian, and German. Her musical career spanned more than 50 years, with over 30 studio albums released. She also represented Monaco at the Eurovision Song Contest 1963.

Born and raised in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, Hardy made her musical debut in 1962 on French label Disques Vogue and found immediate success through the song &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot;. Drifting away from her early rock and roll influences, she began to record in London in 1964, which allowed her to broaden her sound with albums such as &quot;Mon amie la rose&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;amitié&quot;, &quot;La maison où j&#x27;ai grandi&quot;, and &quot;Ma jeunesse fout le camp....&quot; In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she released &quot;Comment te dire adieu&quot;, &quot;La question&quot;, and &quot;Message personnel&quot;. During this period, she worked with songwriters such as Serge Gainsbourg, Patrick Modiano, Michel Berger, and Catherine Lara. Between 1977 and 1988, she worked with producer Gabriel Yared on the albums &quot;Star&quot;, &quot;Musique saoûle&quot;, &quot;Gin Tonic&quot;, and &quot;À suivre&quot;. Her 1988 record &quot;Décalages&quot; was publicized as her final album, although she returned eight years later with &quot;Le danger&quot;, which reinvented her sound as harsher alternative rock. Her following albums of the 2000s — &quot;Clair-obscur&quot;, &quot;Tant de belles choses&quot;, and &quot;(Parenthèses...)&quot; — saw a return to her mellow style. In the 2010s, Hardy released her final three albums: &quot;La pluie sans parapluie&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;amour fou&quot;, and &quot;Personne d&#x27;autre&quot;.

In addition to music, Hardy landed film roles as a supporting actress in &quot;Château en Suède&quot;, &quot;Une balle au cœur&quot;, and the American production &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. She became a muse for fashion designers such as André Courrèges, Yves Saint Laurent, and Paco Rabanne, and collaborated with photographer Jean-Marie Périer. Hardy developed a career as an astrologer, having written extensively on the subject from the 1970s onwards. She was also an author of fiction and non-fiction books from the 2000s. Her autobiography, &quot;Le désespoir des singes...et autres bagatelles&quot;, was a best-seller in France.

As a public figure, Hardy was known for her shyness, disenchantment with celebrity life, and self-deprecatory attitude, which were attributed to her lifelong struggles with anxiety and insecurity. She married French singer-songwriter Jacques Dutronc in 1981. Their son, Thomas, also became a musician. Hardy remains one of the best-selling singers in French history and continues to be regarded as an important and influential figure in both French pop music and fashion. In 2006 she was awarded the &quot;Grande médaille de la chanson française&quot;, an honorary award given by the Académie française, in recognition of her career in music. Hardy died of cancer in Paris in June 2024, aged 80.

==Early life and education==

Françoise Madeleine Hardy was born on 17 January 1944 at the Marie-Louise Clinic in the 9th arrondissement of Paris in German-occupied France during World War II. She was born during an air raid and the windows of the clinic exploded. She related being born in this violent context to her &quot;abnormally anxious temperament&quot; as an adult. Her younger sister, Michèle, was born eighteen months later and their mother, Madeleine Hardy (1921–1991), who came from an ordinary background, raised Françoise and Michèle as a single parent. Her father, Étienne Dillard, was a married man who came from a wealthy family. He did little to help them financially and was an absent figure in their upbringing, only visiting the children a couple of times a year. Hardy&#x27;s mother raised her daughters strictly in a modest apartment on the 9th arrondissement&#x27;s Rue d&#x27;Aumale. Hardy had an unhappy and troubled childhood and mostly engaged in solitary activities like reading, playing with dolls, or listening to the radio.

At the insistence of their father, the girls went to a Catholic school called Institution La Bruyère, under the tutelage of Trinitarian nuns. The socio-economic gap between Hardy and her classmates was a source of lifelong insecurity. Her mental health was worsened by her maternal grandmother, who &quot;told [her] repeatedly that [she] was unattractive and a very bad person&quot;. Between 1952 and 1960, Hardy and her sister were sent every summer to Austria to learn German, encouraged by her mother&#x27;s new lover, an Austrian baron. Her father played piano and Hardy was introduced to piano lessons as a very young child, which she dropped after experiencing stage fright when she was required to perform on stage at the Salle Gaveau.

At age 16, Hardy finished her secondary education and passed her &quot;baccalauréat&quot;. To mark the occasion her father asked her what gift she would like and she chose a guitar, with which she began to sing her own songs. Following her mother&#x27;s orders, she enrolled in the Paris Institute of Political Studies while still a teenager, but finding it too challenging she left the Institute and enrolled at the Sorbonne to study German. Hardy used the time left from her courses to compose songs and began to perform in a small venue, where she played every Thursday &quot;in front of an audience of retirees&quot;. Around this time she auditioned for record label Pathé-Marconi after seeing an ad in &quot;France-Soir&quot;. She was rejected, but was pleased that she had held the directors&#x27; attention for longer than she expected. She also felt encouraged after hearing her recorded voice, which she found &quot;less off-key and tremulous than [she] feared&quot;.

==Music career==
=== 1961–1962: Career beginnings ===
Hardy went to Philips Records and was recommended to take singing lessons. She auditioned for &quot;Le Petit Conservatoire de la chanson&quot; in 1961, a school for performers that aired on radio and television. The head of the program, Mireille Hartuch, was known for being selective. However, she saw Hardy enter the classroom and immediately accepted her before she could play. They developed a &quot;mother-daughter relationship&quot; and a friendship based on mutual esteem.

On 14 May 1961, Hardy auditioned for the French label Disques Vogue. Her looks caught the attention of their sound engineer André Bernot, who felt that she &quot;would make a nice record cover&quot;, and offered to teach her music theory to improve her sense of rhythm. Bernot later recorded a four-track demo with her which he submitted to the label&#x27;s directior Jacques Wolfsohn. Wolfsohn was looking for a female singer to record &quot;Oh oh chéri&quot;, a French-language version of Bobby Lee Trammell&#x27;s song &quot;Uh Oh&quot;, and after auditioning Hardy Wolfsohn offered her a one-year contract, which she signed on 14 November 1961.

Upon hearing Hardy&#x27;s new record deal, Hartuch presented her on the &quot;Petit Conservatoire&quot; TV show on 6 February 1962. Hardy performed her original song &quot;La fille avec toi&quot; on guitar, after which she was asked what the English-language &quot;yeah! yeah!&quot; in her lyrics meant. The transliteration &quot;yé-yé&quot; was later popularized by sociologist Edgar Morin through an article published in &quot;Le Monde&quot; on 7 July 1963, in which he analyzed the burgeoning youth-led pop music scene. The yé-yé phenomenon was coined by the radio program &quot;Salut les copains,&quot; created by Daniel Filipacchi,and its magazine of the same name.

=== 1962–1963: Yé-yé sensation ===
Vogue released Hardy&#x27;s first extended play (EP) in May 1962, which included &quot;Oh oh chéri&quot; together with her compositions &quot;Il est parti un jour&quot;, &quot;J&#x27;suis d&#x27;accord&quot; and the sentimental ballad &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot;. In early October, Hardy filmed a black-and-white music video for &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot;, directed by Pierre Badel, which appeared on the TV show &quot;Toute la chanson&quot;. The song was Hardy&#x27;s choice, and also that of the show&#x27;s producer André Salvet, despite Wolfsohn&#x27;s reluctance to promote it. Hardy was introduced to a wider audience on 28 October when the clip was rebroadcast during a commercial break in the televised results of the presidential election referendum. The song instantly became popular among the youth in France, particularly teenage girls, and was widely played on radio stations, starting with Europe n° 1. &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot; was further popularized by a Scopitone music video directed by Claude Lelouch.

Vogue quickly released two more EPs of Hardy&#x27;s songs. These were later compiled, with the first EP for her debut studio album, which became known as &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot;. In France the LP format was initially viewed with skepticism and Hardy&#x27;s first series of albums were compilations of previously released four-track 7-inch records, a format known as &quot;super 45 [rpm]&quot;. Most of her full-length records were released without a title, with only her name on the cover, and they came to be known by the title of the most popular song of the collection. Hardy&#x27;s debut studio album was awarded the Trophée de la Télévision and the prestigious Grand Prix du Disque award given by the Académie Charles Cros. By early 1963, 500,000 copies of &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot; had been sold in France, and the total rose to 2.5 million in the following months.

Hardy&#x27;s singles &quot;J&#x27;suis d&#x27;accord&quot;, &quot;Le temps de l&#x27;amour&quot;, and &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot; topped the French singles chart in late 1962 and early 1963. She signed a new five-year contract with Vogue and an agreement with Editions Musicales Alpha, created by Wolfsohn. She met Michel Bourdais, a young designer recently discovered by Charles Aznavour, who created the first portrait of Françoise Hardy. (Which Hardy, artistically seduced, acquired.) 

In March 1963, she represented Monaco at the Eurovision Song Contest 1963, recorded in London. She performed the song &quot;L&#x27;amour s&#x27;en va&quot;, which came fifth in the contest. When the song was released as a single, it reached No. 5 on the French charts in June 1963. In October, Hardy released her second studio album, &quot;Le premier bonheur du jour&quot;. That month she received the &quot;Youth&quot; Edison Award at the Grand Gala du Disque in Scheveningen, Netherlands. She was presented with the trophy by the author Godfried Bomans, who praised her as a &quot;creative artist&quot; who knew how to impose &quot;a personal style without trying to imitate the Americans&quot;.

As a leading figure of the yé-yé craze, Hardy found herself at the forefront of the French music scene and became the country&#x27;s most exportable female singer. Beginning in 1963, translated re-recordings of &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot; were exported to Italian, German, and English-speaking markets. The first non-French-speaking country in which the singer found success was Italy, where the song became &quot;Quelli della mia età&quot; and sold 255,000 copies. It topped the singles chart between April and October, dropping to second place between July and August behind Rita Pavone&#x27;s &quot;Cuore&quot;. At the end of the summer in Milan, she recorded new songs which were included in the Italian release &quot;Françoise Hardy canta per voi in italiano&quot;. The single &quot;L&#x27;età dell&#x27;amore&quot; / &quot;E all&#x27;amore che penso&quot; also topped the Italian charts.

===1964–1968: International stardom===
In 1963, Hardy went to London record new music. At the height of the British Invasion, Hardy sought to modernize her music, opting to leave the poor quality of French studios and sound engineers and record her songs at Pye Records studios. Working with producer Tony Hatch in February 1964, she recorded an EP that included a cover of &quot;Catch a Falling Star&quot; and three adaptations of her hits &quot;Find Me a Boy&quot; (&quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot;), &quot;Only Friends&quot; (&quot;Ton meilleur ami&quot;) and &quot;I Wish It Were Me&quot; (&quot;J&#x27;aurais voulu&quot;). English audiences initially preferred her recordings in French, with &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot; entering the UK Singles Chart on 1 July 1964 at number thirty-six.

Her 1965 English-language single &quot;All Over the World&quot; was a hit in the UK, reaching the Top 20 and staying on the charts for fifteen weeks. It was also successful in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, making it possibly her most popular recording among English-speaking audiences. 

In 1965 Hardy flew to New York to sign a record deal with Kapp to distribute her records in the United States. The label released her debut studio album under the title &quot;The &quot;Yeh-Yeh&quot; Girl From Paris!&quot; and the single &quot;However Much&quot;, an English version of the previously released track &quot;Et même...&quot; A German language album &quot;In Deutschland&quot; was released which contained five original compositions and translated versions of her previous songs. The most popular track in Germany was &quot;Frag&#x27; den Abendwind&quot;, which remained on the national singles chart for twenty-four weeks.On 12 April 1966, Hardy was among forty-six performers who took part in a group photograph shot by Jean-Marie Périer for &quot;Salut Les Copains.&quot; The image became a symbol of the yé-yé era and came to be known in France as the &quot;photo of the century&quot; (French: &quot;photo du siècle&quot;).

Beginning in late 1967, Hardy took Wolfsohn&#x27;s suggestion to release her records through her own production company, Asparagus, although Vogue continued to distribute them. She later regretted this decision, recalling in 1999: &quot;The CEO of Vogue, Léon Cabat, was also in this production company and between them, they owned the majority of the shares. This has given rise to a lot of harassment lawsuits.&quot; Her seventh French album &quot;Ma jeunesse fout le camp,&quot; the first one produced under Asparagus, was released in November 1967.

On the advice of English producer Noel Rodgers, Hardy recorded her second English album in the spring of 1968, known variously as &quot;En anglais&quot;, &quot;The Second English Album&quot;, &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;Loving&quot;, depending on the country.

In 1968, Hardy released a French cover of Vera Lynn&#x27;s &quot;It Hurts to Say Goodbye&quot;, titled &quot;Comment te dire adieu&quot;, on the album of the same name. Its French lyrics were written by Serge Gainsbourg and it became one of her most successful releases.

===1969–1976: Transition to artistic maturity===

In 1970 she broke with the label and signed a three-year contract with Sonopresse, a subsidiary of Hachette. She also created a new production company called Hypopotam, and founded her own music publishing company, Kundalini. Hardy received large advances from Sonopresse, which allowed her to finance her own projects. She described this period as &quot;the happiest time&quot;, as she was now able to work independently on her music. This transitional period in her career began with the 1970 releases of several compilation albums, including the French &quot;Françoise&quot;, as well as the studio albums &quot;One-Nine-Seven-Zero,&quot; recorded in English, and &quot;Träume&quot;, her last German-language release.

Her first French studio album produced under Hypopotam was , was released in the spring of 1970. It featured numerous arrangers, including Bernard Estardy, Jean-Claude Vannier, Jean-Pierre Sabar, Mick Jones, Saint-Preux, Simon Napier-Bell, and Tommy Brown from Nero and the Gladiators. In the summer of 1970, Hardy released her penultimate Italian-language single, &quot;Lungo il mare&quot;, written by Giuseppe Torrebruno, Luigi Albertelli and Donato Renzetti. Both this and the next Italian single, which included translated versions of &quot;Soleil&quot; (&quot;Sole ti amo&quot;) and &quot;Le crabe&quot; (&quot;Il granchio&quot;), were unsuccessful. She also recorded in Spanish for the first time, for a single that contained translated versions of &quot;Soleil&quot; (&quot;Sol&quot;) and &quot;J&#x27;ai coupé le téléphone&quot; (&quot;Corté el teléfono&quot;). In the spring of 1971, Hardy released singer-songwriter Patrick Dewaere&#x27;s single &quot;T&#x27;es pas poli&quot;, having been impressed by his performances at the Café de la Gare in Paris. Dewaere and Hardy performed the song on several television shows to promote it, but it was not a success.

In 1970 Hardy met Tuca (Valeniza Zagni da Silva), a Brazilian singer and guitarist based in Paris, and they became close friends. Hardy made an album with Tuca after attending the Festival Internacional da Canção in Rio de Janeiro and discovering the music of Brazil This was the first time in her career that she had worked on material with another songwriter before going into the studio. She was also able to participate in the choice of string arrangements. The resulting album, &quot;La question&quot;, was released on 16 October 1971 and was promoted with the singles &quot;Le martien&quot;, &quot;Même sous la pluie&quot; and &quot;Rêve&quot;. Although acclaimed by the French press, the album was not a success.

Following the poor commercial performance of &quot;La question&quot;, Hardy moved towards a different sound and enlisted British arranger Tony Cox to produce her next album. Known as &quot;Et si je m&#x27;en vais avant toi&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;éclairage&quot;, or in reference to its cover, &quot;The Orange Album&quot;, the record was released in November 1972 and promoted through the single &quot;La berlue&quot; (released earlier in June). After finishing &quot;Et si je m&#x27;en vais avant toi&quot;, Hardy and Cox recorded the English-language album &quot;If You Listen&quot;, which included cover versions of little-known American and British songs. When Hardy&#x27;s contract with Sonopresse expired it was not renewed.

Around 1972, Hardy recruited songwriter and producer Michel Berger after being impressed by his work with Véronique Sanson He wrote two of the record&#x27;s twelve songs, &quot;Message personnel&quot; and &quot;Première rencontre&quot;, and found the other ten, although Hardy felt they were weak. After a period of artistic independence, she again found herself working under the hectic schedule of a demanding producer. She later described Berger as &quot;a man in a hurry, with a thousand things to do, a thousand things to think about, a thousand people to see&quot;. Recording sessions for the album took place in July 1973, soon after Hardy had given birth to her son Thomas Dutronc. &quot;Message personnel&quot; was released that year on Warner Bros. Records, with whom Hardy signed a three-year contract, and was a commercial and critical success. Its title track reignited the singer&#x27;s career in France. She promoted the album with appearances on French TV shows, including &quot;Dimanche Salvador&quot;, &quot;Sports en fête&quot;, &quot;Top à&quot;, &quot;La Une est à vous&quot;, &quot;Midi trente&quot;, &quot;Minuit chez vous&quot;, &quot;Tempo&quot;, &quot;Averty&#x27;s Follies&quot;, and &quot;Domino&quot;.

Hardy wrote ten songs with a common theme for the next album, and her friend Catherine Lara put the words to music. She also worked with Jean-Pierre Castelain and Gérard Kawczynski (with whom she had worked on &quot;Message personnel&quot;), André Georget, and Michel Sivy. Produced by Hughes de Courson, the concept album &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot; was released in November 1974 and promoted through the songs &quot;Ce soir&quot;, &quot;Je te cherche&quot;, and &quot;Il y a eu des nuits&quot;. It was a commercial failure and Hardy took a break from music to devote more time to raising her child. She released two singles in 1975-76. The first was Jean-Michel Jarre&#x27;s &quot;Que vas-tu faire?&quot;, backed by &quot;Le compte a rebours&quot; which sold poorly. The second was &quot;Femme parmi les femmes&quot;, the theme song of Claude Lelouch&#x27;s film &quot;Si c&#x27;était à refaire&quot;, featuring lyrics by Pierre Barouh and music by Francis Lai.

Around 1976, Berger contacted Hardy again, wanting to sign her to his new record label, Apache, and she sent him the songs &quot;Ton enfance&quot;, &quot;Star&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;impasse&quot;. Berger proposed to release an album of her songs with compositions structured around a unifying concept, but Hardy declined and signed a three-year deal with Pathé-Marconi.

=== 1977–1995: Work with Gabriel Yared and hiatus===

For 1977&#x27;s &quot;Star&quot;, her first album released under Pathé-Marconi, Hardy enlisted Gabriel Yared as producer and arranger. The &quot;patchwork album&quot; contained six tracks written by Hardy and songs written by Serge Gainsbourg, William Sheller, Catherine Lara, Luc Plamondon, Roland Vincent, and Michel Jonasz. At first Hardy&#x27;s relationship with Yared was tense and &quot;Star&quot; was recorded under a &quot;strained atmosphere&quot;, earning her the nickname &quot;ice queen&quot;. According to Frédéric Quinonero, &quot;the singer deemed it necessary to immediately dispel any misunderstanding, physical or sentimental, before being integrated into a faithful friendship.&quot; &quot;Star&quot; was a commercial success that put Hardy back in the media spotlight and introduced her work to a new generation of young people. Despite their stiff relationship in the recording studio, Hardy and Yared continued to work together for nearly six years and recorded five albums. In 1991 the singer recalled her experience of working with the producer:

[Yared] is demanding… in work as in friendship. He had great influence over me. The five albums we made together were not easy… but I consider that it was one of the great chances of my life to find myself again under the guidance of a musician of this dimension.
Hardy&#x27;s 1978 follow-up, &quot;Musique saoûle,&quot; included compositions by Yared, Alain Goldstein and Michel Jonasz. The album changed Hardy&#x27;s musical direction to a more danceable sound and it was a commercial success, aided by the popularity of the lead single &quot;J&#x27;écoute de la musique saoûle&quot;, especially in its extended remixed version. &quot;Musique saoûle&quot; was promoted through televised appearances which showed the singer &quot;awkwardly&quot; performing the track amid a dancing crowd. In 1980, Yared and collaborator Bernard Ilous gave her next album, &quot;Gin Tonic,&quot; an even more commercial style. The album cover, photographed by a collaborator from &quot;Façade&quot;, a French magazine modelled after Andy Warhol&#x27;s journal &quot;Influence,&quot; projected a &quot;furiously modern&quot; image of the singer and &quot;Gin Tonic&quot; was promoted with the singles &quot;Jazzy rétro Satanas&quot; and &quot;Juke-box&quot;. Hardy&#x27;s next album, &quot;À suivre,&quot; was released in April 1981 on the Flarenasch label, in breach of her contract with Pathé-Marconi, and featured a new array of collaborators, with Yared enlisting composers Louis Chedid, Pierre Groscolas, Jean-Claude Vannier, Michel Bernholc, Daniel Perreau, Jean-Pierre Bourtayre, and Étienne Roda-Gil. &quot;À suivre&quot; was promoted through the singles &quot;Tamalou&quot; and &quot;Villégiature&quot;. The next album, &quot;Quelqu&#x27;un qui s&#x27;en va,&quot; was released in the spring of 1981 and featured a cover photographed by Serge Gainsbourg. &quot;Décalages,&quot; released on 2 May 1988, was promoted as Hardy&#x27;s final album. It was a commercial success and certified gold for selling 100,000 copies.

In 1990 Hardy wrote &quot;Fais-moi une place&quot; for Julien Clerc and the song was included on his album of the same name. Hardy resumed her music career in the 1990s, signing a contract with Virgin Records in December 1994. In 1995 Hardy collaborated with English band Blur for the French version of &quot;To the End&quot;, recorded at Abbey Road Studios. It was included as a B-side to band&#x27;s single &quot;Country House&quot;.

=== 1996–2021: Final albums and retirement ===
In 1997 Hardy collaborated with French duo Air on the track &quot;Jeanne&quot;, a B-side on their maxi-single &quot;Sexy Boy&quot;.

In 2005 Hardy received the &#x27;Female Artist of the Year&#x27; award for her album &quot;Tant de belles choses&quot; at the Victoires de la Musique. In 2006 she received the Grande médaille de la chanson française award, given by the Académie Française in recognition of her music career.

In 2012 Hardy celebrated her 50th anniversary in music with the release of her first novel and an album, both titled &quot;L&#x27;Amour fou&quot;. Recently diagnosed with laryngeal cancer, the singer declared &quot;L&#x27;Amour fou&quot; to be her last album, but returned nearly five years later with the 2018 release &quot;Personne d&#x27;autre&quot;.

In March 2021, Hardy announced that she could no longer sing as a result of her cancer treatments.

==Acting career==

Hardy had film roles, but did not embark on a serious career as an actress and did not wish to do so. She reluctantly accepted acting work offered to her in the 1960s on the advice of Jean-Marie Périer. While she liked the idea of working with well-known film directors, she still preferred music over cinema. 

In 1963 Hardy made her film debut as Ophelia in Roger Vadim&#x27;s &quot;Château en Suède&quot;. Before casting her, Vadim tested Hardy&#x27;s acting abilities by directing her in a reading of Cécile de Roggendorf&#x27;s love letters to Giacomo Casanova. During the making of &quot;Château en Suède&quot;, Vadim mocked Hardy for her &quot;infinite apathy&quot;, which marked the &quot;beginning of her dread for filming sessions and the movie business in general&quot;. As promotion for the film Hardy attended the Cannes Film Festival, where she wore a black coat by Pierre Cardin.

After a cameo in &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;, Hardy landed a role in Jean-Daniel Pollet&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;Une balle au cœur&quot;, which was shot on location on a remote Greek island. She disliked the experience, saying, &quot;after a day or two, I realized that the director was hopelessly bad and his film was a disaster.&quot; Building on her music career success in Italy, Hardy made appearances as a performer in &quot;musicarelli&quot; films, including &quot;I ragazzi dell&#x27;Hully Gully&quot; (1964), &quot;Questo pazzo, pazzo mondo della canzone&quot; (1965), &quot;Altissima pressione&quot; (1965), and &quot;Europa canta&quot; (1965). She appeared in the 1968 television special &quot;Monte Carlo: C&#x27;est La Rose&quot;, hosted by Grace Kelly.

The American director John Frankenheimer spotted Hardy as she was leaving a London club and thought she would be perfect in his Formula One film &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966). Despite remaining uninterested in an acting career, Hardy accepted the role because it was well-paid. She made a cameo in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;Masculin féminin&quot; wearing a head-to-toe look by André Courrèges. In 1969 she starred in the television film &quot;L&#x27;homme qui venait du Cher&quot; alongside Eddy Mitchell. In the 1970s, she made brief appearances in Jean-Claude Lord&#x27;s &quot;The Doves (Les Colombes)&quot; (1972) and Claude Lelouch&#x27;s &quot;If I Had to Do It All Over Again (Si c&#x27;était à refaire)&quot; (1976).

==Astrological career==

Hardy also developed a career as an astrologer, having written extensively on the subject. She aligned herself with the so-called &quot;conditionalist&quot; school of thought, outlined by Jean-Pierre Nicola in his 1964 book, &quot;La condition solaire,&quot; which proposed a non-divinatory character for the discipline and said that it should be used while taking into account other factors such as hereditary, educational, and socio-cultural determinants.

Hardy first became interested in the subject after consulting astrologer André Barbault in the mid-1960s. She took public courses, learned to draw up a birth chart and read many specialized books before meeting Catherine Aubier, who recommended her teacher to Hardy. Hardy was taught traditional astrology for two years by Madame Godefroy in Paris. She became more dedicated to astrology after meeting Nicola in 1974, who asked her to be part of a new magazine he was developing. The singer described Nicola as &quot;the best astrologer in the world&quot; and wrote: &quot;[he] initiated me into an intelligent understanding of astrology and trained me to use it, by his side, to the best of my ability.&quot; Besides astrology, Hardy was initiated into the reading of the Tarot of Marseilles by Alejandro Jodorowsky. As a complement to her astrological knowledge, she also took courses with graphologist Germaine Tripier, the dean of the French Society of Graphology.

Between recording sessions for her album &quot;Gin Tonic&quot; in 1979, Hardy collaborated on a book series on the zodiac signs by Tchou Editions, and worked on the book dedicated to Virgo with fellow astrologer Béatrice Guénin. She also collaborated with the magazine &quot;Quinze Ans&quot;. In late 1980, Hardy was asked by Pierre Lescure of the RMC radio station to provide the daily horoscope and a weekly show. In 1982 Hardy began a new weekly broadcast, titled &quot;Entre les lignes, entre les signes&quot;, in which she interviewed a film or music figure using their birth chart, and graphologist Anne-Marie Simmond, whose courses Hardy had taken, drew up a psychological portrait using their handwriting. A compilation of the interviews and profiles was published by RMC in 1986.

In 1990, Hardy continued her astrological work by writing articles in Swiss newspaper &quot;Le Matin&quot; and by hosting a weekly section in Thierry Ardisson&#x27;s program &quot;Télé Zèbre&quot; on Antenne 2. On 7 May 2003, Hardy published &quot;Les rythmes du zodiaque,&quot; which had taken over two years to write and which she intended to be &quot;a book that would allow me to make my little contribution to modern astrology&quot;.

== Writing career ==
In her later years Hardy became an author of fiction and non-fiction. She also wrote an autobiography, &quot;Le désespoir des singes... et autres bagatelles (The Despair of Monkeys and Other Trifles),&quot; which was published on 9 October 2008. It sold 250,000 copies and became a bestseller in France. The book was translated and published in Spanish by the San Sebastián-based independent publisher Expediciones Polares in 2017. An English-language edition, translated by Jon E. Graham, was published by Feral House in 2018.
In 2012 Hardy published her first novel, &quot;L&#x27;amour fou,&quot; on Éditions Albin Michel. It was released in conjunction with a music album of the same name. She had begun working on the story, which dealt with an obsessive romantic relationship, thirty years before but had shelved the manuscript and had not intended to release it. She was urged to do so by her editor and agreed after being encouraged by her friend, Jean-Marie Périer. Hardy felt it was appropriate to publish the book to mark the fiftieth year of her musical career, as it told &quot;the story that has been the matrix of almost all of my lyrics from the start&quot;. In 2013 an Italian-language edition of the novel was released by Florence&#x27;s Edizioni Clichy.
Following poor sales of the albums &quot;La pluie sans parapluie&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Amour fou&quot;, Hardy decided to distance herself from music and dedicate herself to writing. This resulted in the essay &quot;Avis non autorisés&quot; &quot;(Unauthorised Opinions)&quot;, released in 2015 on Éditions des Équateurs, in which she described the difficulties of reaching old age. In this book she also shared views on current affairs which were deemed &quot;politically incorrect&quot;. &quot;Avis non autorisés&quot; was a commercial success. A year later, she published &quot;Un cadeau du ciel (A Present from Heaven),&quot; in which she reflected on her hospitalization in March 2015 for cancer during which she nearly died. In the early 2020s, after being unable to continue singing, and claiming that she had &quot;nothing else to do&quot;, Hardy dedicated herself assembling a song book, &quot;Chansons sur toi et nous,&quot; a compilation of all of her lyrics with commentaries. &quot;Chansons sur toi et nous&quot; was published in 2021 on Éditions des Équateurs.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===

Although Hardy&#x27;s music covered a wide range of genres, she maintained a signature sound from the beginning of her career which was defined by breathy alto vocals and a predilection for melancholic songs. &quot;Rock &amp; Folk&quot;″s Basile Farkas described her as the &quot;queen of melancholy&quot;, and Hardy herself stated in 2012: &quot;In music, I like above all the slow, sad melodies… Not in a way that plunges, but in a way that uplifts… I still aspire to find the heartbreaking melody that will bring tears to my eyes. A melody whose quality gives it a sacred dimension.&quot; Cosette Schulz of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; described her as a &quot;master of crafting simple but stellar tracks&quot;. Writers have likened Hardy&#x27;s music to that of English singer Marianne Faithfull. Comparing both singers, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Keith Altham wrote in 2014: &quot;They both sing sad songs with a simple folksy style. They both have the same shy, wistful, almost waif-like appeal about them. They both have a dramatic, &#x27;all-alone&#x27; quality about their voices which commands sympathy and attention.&quot;

Aside from original compositions, much of her 1960s repertoire consisted of versions of foreign artists that spanned a wide range of styles, including American girl-groups, early rockabilly, pre-Beatles British rock and roll, country music, folk, folk-rock and, to a lesser extent, doo-wop and soul. The recurring themes of her lyrics are sadness, personal pain, heartache, one-sided love, sleeplessness, boredom, loneliness, and confinement. Her deadpan delivery, characterized by its &quot;cool, aloof air&quot;, has also been compared to that of German singer Nico. 

Hardy was known for being meticulous about her music, such as her decision to leave low-quality French studios for higher-quality studios in London. As she matured, Hardy honed her own despairing songwriting, but she also chose from the works of leading professionals. Producer Erick Benzi recalled: &quot;From when she was 18, she knew she was different. She was capable of going in front of big artists like Charles Aznavour and saying, &#x27;Your song is crap, I don&#x27;t want to sing it.&#x27; She never made compromises.&quot; Tony Cox recalled his experience working with Hardy: &quot;Françoise was good in that she liked things to be slightly more adventurous than the norm. There was a bit of the Left Bank about her – she&#x27;s not your average pop singer, that&#x27;s for sure.&quot;

Although she is regarded as one of the greatest exponents of yé-yé, she was apart from her peers in writing much of her own material. She was also known for downplaying her skills as a singer and musician. Her compositions became less frequent, as she told &quot;Rock &amp; Folk&quot; in 2018: &quot;I understood that even if I did learn things, I would never be able to do as well as real melodists. That&#x27;s why I thought it was best to bring in musicians whose work touched me.&quot;

=== Influences ===
Her earliest musical tastes were French &quot;chanson&quot; singers, including Cora Vaucaire, Georges Guétary, Charles Trenet, and Jacques Brel, since in the 1950s this was the only music played on the radio. She said that Trenet touched her more than the others because his music was &quot;sad and light&quot;. Hardy was also a big fan of singer and songwriter Barbara, who had inspired her to write her own compositions. In the early 1960s, she was introduced to English-language rock and roll and Brill Building pop through Radio Luxembourg and took inspiration from artists such as Brenda Lee, the Everly Brothers, the Shadows, Cliff Richard, Neil Sedaka, Connie Francis, and especially Elvis Presley and Paul Anka. Hardy said she was &quot;completely spellbound&quot; by these young foreign artists and began to sing and play the guitar to try to imitate them. She recalled in 2008: &quot;I immediately identified with them, because they expressed teenage loneliness and awkwardness, over melodies that were much more inspiring than their lyrics&quot;.

Hardy&#x27;s music during the second half of the decade incorporated influences from the British Invasion pop phenomenon and &quot;a strong comeback of the traditional values of French &quot;chanson&quot;, neither yé-yé nor &#x27;Left Bank&#x27;, but rather romantic&quot;. Her 1964 album &quot;Mon amie la rose&quot; incorporated influences of Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound technique, as well as Italian composer Ennio Morricone. Brazilian guitarist and arranger Tuca, introduced Hardy to bossa nova, which culminated to the 1971 album &quot;La Question&quot;. 

Hardy was an admirer of English folk singer-songwriter Nick Drake. She recalled: &quot;For me, he didn&#x27;t belong to a particularly British tradition… It is the soul which comes out of his songs that touched me deeply – romantic, poetic… but also the refined melodies. As well as the very individual timbre of his voice, which adds to the melancholy of the whole thing.&quot; Their personalities, voices, and tastes in chords and harmony were perceived to be similar. 

In 1972, Véronique Sanson&#x27;s debut album made an impression on Hardy, who began to feel that her own music was outdated. She described her impression of Sanson in her autobiography: &quot;It was as if the English and American influences that yé-yé had been happy to simply copy… had been thoroughly digested and allowed for the emergence of something much more musically mature, as well as more personal.&quot; Hardy&#x27;s 1996 output &quot;Le danger&quot; incorporated influences from English band Portishead and the grunge, Britpop, and roots rock genres.

===Development===
====1962–1967====
Hardy&#x27;s rockabilly-tinged, full-length debut album &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot; was the closest she came to the yé-yé genre. The album was noted for its simple, minimalist accompaniment of acoustic and electric guitar, bass, and jazz-influenced percussion. Her next album, &quot;Le premier bonheur du jour,&quot; incorporated more complex instrumentation and lyricism, with electric organs and &quot;weeping&quot; string arrangements and included compositions inspired by jazz music and American girl groups such as the Crystals and the Ronettes. 

In the mid-1960s, her music became lusher and richer after she moved to London to record with arranger Charles Blackwell, who allowed her to &quot;reach new levels of sophistication.&quot; The album &quot;Mon amie la rose,&quot; released in 1964, revealed a growing complexity in her music, with stronger vocals and increased experimentation in song structure. Hardy&#x27;s 1965-66 output showed her style maturing, with productions that &quot;moved from the tinny sound of yeh-yeh pop into a fuller brand of rock arrangements.&quot; The overall sound of her follow-up album, &quot;L&#x27;amitié,&quot; was considerably more expansive. According to Pitchfork&#x27;s Hazel Cills: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t until her fifth record, &quot;La maison où j&#x27;ai grandi,&quot; that Hardy grew into a more grown-up, baroque sound, one that matched the depth of her sorrow and its complexities.&quot; Warfield considered that this was the album in which she had &quot;really settled into her sound, giving us a glimpse of the performer we can still recognise as a 70-year-old&quot;. With &quot;Ma jeunesse fout le camp&quot;, her last 1960s album recorded in London, she &quot;moved toward a more adult, sedate form of orchestrated pop balladry&quot; which has been described as &quot;her farewell to the yé-yé years&quot;.

==== 1968–1974 ====

With Hardy&#x27;s return to French recording studios 1968&#x27;s &quot;Comment te dire adieu&quot; was more MOR-oriented than her previous releases. Richie Unterberger considered its music to be &quot;perhaps even sadder and more sentimental&quot; than usual. As the yé-yé era faded away following the May 68 protests in France, Hardy &quot;reinvented herself as an elusive folk-rock/jazz &quot;chanteuse&quot;&quot; with her early 1970s releases. She developed a more mature, less-pop oriented style to reflect more of her inner. Described as &quot;the first truly personal Françoise Hardy record&quot;, the 1971 album &quot;La question,&quot; moving toward a less commercial sound with no apparent hooks, was regarded as an important turning point in her career. It was one of her sparsest efforts, with subdued and acoustic-flavored arrangements featuring guitar, touches of bass and subtle orchestration. Hardy&#x27;s vocals have been described as &quot;sultry&quot; and &quot;breathy&quot;, at times &quot;[substituting] melodic humming in the place of singing, wordlessly articulating the emotional essence of the song.&quot; &quot;La question&quot; was also first time that Hardy had a part in choosing the string arrangements for her work.

Following &quot;La question&quot;, Hardy progressed to a more folk and rock-influenced sound. This led producer Joe Boyd to suggest that Nick Drake write an album of songs for Hardy, to be produced by Tony Cox. The two singers met several times, including a visit by Drake to Hardy&#x27;s recording sessions in London, but the project was never carried out. Cox was keen to work with Hardy, and in late 1971 recorded &quot;If You Listen&quot;, which featured a &quot;crack team&quot; of British folk-rock musicians. Influenced by Drake, the album featured &quot;cinematic&quot; arrangements that emphasized acoustic guitar and light strings. In the same year, Hardy released &quot;Et si je m&#x27;en vais avant toi&quot;, which incorporated influences from American blues, folk, and rock music and featured, unusually, a slightly humorous tone and catchier rhythms.

Hardy enlisted Michel Berger, the producer of Véronique Sanson&#x27;s debut album, to oversee production of her 1973 album &quot;Message personnel.&quot; The album featured arrangements by Michel Bernholc, who directed &quot;a basic rock band backed by a lush set of strings, [underlining] Hardy&#x27;s wispy yet compelling vocals.&quot; The album had a sad, introspective mood and &quot;classy, adult tone&quot;. The 1974 release &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot; was Hardy&#x27;s first attempt at a concept album, with lyrics that narrated &quot;the successive phases of a one-night stand between a stranger and a young woman, who, abandoned by the man she loves, is looking to give him a taste of his own medicine.&quot; It featured orchestral arrangements by Del Newman, who had recently worked on Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; and Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot;.

==== 1975–2018 ====
1977&#x27;s &quot;Star,&quot; a &quot;jazz-oriented pop&quot; record, was Hardy&#x27;s first album to be arranged by Gabriel Yared, who produced her output for the next ten years. In 1978, as disco dominated the music industry, Yared sought to adapt her sound to the era with the release of &quot;Musique saoûle&quot;, which incorporated rhythms influenced by funk music. The singer said later that she had felt uncomfortable and embarrassed when singing over dance rhythms. The 1988 album &quot;Décalages,&quot; noted for its layered, atmospheric sound, incorporated the use of a Synclavier synthesizer, despite the singer&#x27;s wishes to avoid fashionable digital sounds in favor of an acoustic style.

In 1996, inspired by the alternative rock scene, Hardy veered into an assertive, guitar-oriented, modern rock style with &quot;Le danger&quot;, her first album in seven years. Pitchfork&#x27;s Jazz Monroe described its music as &quot;adult-contemporary space rock&quot;. The album&#x27;s harsh sound and lyrics reflect the &quot;very dark&quot; period the singer was in at the time. The commercial failure of &quot;Le danger&quot;, among other reasons, caused Hardy to return to her earlier soft and light style for the next album, &quot;Clair-obscur&quot;, released in 2000, and her final five albums were characterized by an elegant and melancholic sound. 2006&#x27;s &quot;(Parenthèses...)&quot; was a collection of twelve duets with production that kept tricks and slick mixing to a minimum, drawing comparisons to previous uncluttered releases such as &quot;La question&quot;. 

Compared to previous albums, 2010&#x27;s &quot;La pluie sans parapluie&quot; featured a &quot;sunnier&quot; sound, with some of its songs driven by a rhythm track of drums and bass rather than piano or strings. Her 2012 album &quot;L&#x27;amour fou&quot; featured half-sung, half-spoken vocals and had a &quot;resigned, philosophical&quot; mood, with &quot;classy&quot; pianos, minor chords and brushed drums as backing. The lyrics of her last album, &quot;Personne d&#x27;autre&quot;, released in 2018, dealt with her advancing years and her own mortality. She had survived a major health crisis since the release of her previous record, and the vocal performances on the album were affected by her illness. The dark, lyrical subject matter of &quot;Personne d&#x27;autre&quot; contrasted with the singer&#x27;s earlier delicate and intimate sound.
== Live performances ==

On 11 May 1962, Hardy made her debut as a live performer alongside other young singers at the Disco Revue gala in Nancy. She performed on Christmas Eve in Brussels and undertook a successful tour in Southern France from late 1962 to early 1963. In February 1963, she appeared on the TV show &quot;Cinq colonnes à la une&quot; alongside Sylvie Vartan and Sheila. They were later considered to be the three biggest idols of the yé-yé era, each one embodying a different modern girl archetype. She made her first appearance at the Olympia concert venue in Paris, where she opened for Richard Anthony. Between 26 February and 10 April, Hardy took part in the Gala des Stars concert tour, sponsored by Europe n° 1 and &quot;Salut les copains&quot;. 

Between tour dates she represented Monaco at the Eurovision Song Contest in London, singing &quot;&quot;, and finished fifth with 25 points in a tie with France&#x27;s Alain Barrière. Between 7 November and 18 December 1963, Hardy appeared again as Anthony&#x27;s opening act at the Olympia in Paris and was well received by the press, who had previously criticized her stiff live performances. On 11 October, Hardy performed in Barcelona, Spain, as part of the fourth Great Gala of the Sedería Española. In November, she embarked on her first Italian tour, which mostly visited small coastal towns. The singer was also successful in Portugal and travelled to Lisbon in late 1963 to appear on TV shows.

On 21 February 1964, Hardy promoted &quot;Catch a Falling Star&quot; on the British TV show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; and on the same show performed &quot;All Around the World&quot;. She also played on &quot;Ollie and Fred&#x27;s Five O&#x27;Clock Club&quot;, &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;, and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. In the United States, Hardy made her first appearance on NBC&#x27;s program &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, where she performed &quot;However Much&quot;, a bilingual version of Charles Trenet&#x27;s &quot;Que reste-t-il de nos amours ?&quot;, and a rendition of &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;.

Hardy became famous overnight in Germany after her 28 April 1965 television appearance in &quot;Portrait in Musik,&quot; a series of staged musical performances directed by Truck Branss. Pressured by her French and Italian record companies, Hardy took part in the Sanremo Music Festival 1966, where she reached the finals with the Edoardo Vianello-penned song &quot;Parlami di te&quot;.

Hardy gave her last three live performances in Kinshasa, Congo, in June 1967. She suffered from stage fright, which led to her quitting live performances altogether in 1968.

==Public image==
===Personality===
As a public figure, Hardy was renowned for her shyness and reservedness, and observers have emphasized her &quot;anti-social nature as a celebrity&quot;. She was open in her autobiography and in interviews about her struggles with anxiety, self-doubt, loneliness and inferiority complex. &quot;Uncut&quot;″s Tom Pinnock noted that &quot;it was her refusal to play the showbusiness game that made her something of an icon.&quot; The singer&#x27;s sudden celebrity status was a source of great discomfort for her, as she claimed in 2011: &quot;I didn&#x27;t enjoy at all everything, the trappings, when all of a sudden you become very famous. (...) [Being taken up by fashion houses] was work, things I had to do, a chore—I didn&#x27;t enjoy it at all... It is quite impossible to stand—to be admired too much—it is not a normal situation. I don&#x27;t like that at all. I am not comfortable with my professional life really, so the word &#x27;icon&#x27;—it&#x27;s as though you were talking about someone else, it&#x27;s not me really.&quot; She was also disenchanted with the jet-set and high society lifestyle.

=== Fashion trend-setter ===

As Hardy&#x27;s almost exclusive photographer and agent during the decade, Jean-Marie Périer became a Pygmalion-like figure for her, and transformed the singer&#x27;s public image from &quot;a shy, gauche-looking schoolgirl&quot; into a &quot;modern young trend-setter.&quot; She wrote: &quot;…[Périer] tried to open my mind and help me in all domains with his characteristic generosity… under his tutelage I realized the importance of aesthetics, which became one of my major criteria. He taught me how to carry myself and to dress, and gave me advice on social skills&quot;. He persuaded the singer to begin modelling and she soon became &quot;a star of the international fashion world as well as the French music scene.&quot; She was photographed by Gered Mankowitz, William Klein and Richard Avedon for &quot;Vogue&quot; and other publications. Her regular appearance on magazine covers gave her a reputation of being the quintessential French cover girl of the 1960s. In 1968, Hardy told a reporter that: &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for the way I dress, no one would notice me&quot;. Likewise, she told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 2018: &quot;My songs had little interest compared to the Anglo-Saxon production. So I took it to heart to dress well every time I went to London or New York. I was above all a fashion ambassador.&quot; 

As an &quot;it girl&quot; and fashion leader, Hardy was considered the epitome of &quot;the &#x27;Modern Woman&#x27;&quot; and of 1960s French chic and cool, known for her avant-garde and futuristic fashion choices. Brett Marie of PopMatters noted that &quot;her sense of style and &#x27;60s-era model figure made her as much an icon of fashion as a music-business star.&quot; She recalled in 2008 that at the start of the 1960s, her slender build which had made her self-conscious suddenly became fashionable. She began to be regarded as an &quot;égérie&quot; &#x27;muse&#x27; by top French fashion designers of the time, including André Courrèges, Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent. Hardy championed the first incarnation of Saint-Laurent&#x27;s rupturist 1966 design Le Smoking, and the designer recalled that when he took her to the Paris Opera dressed in one of his tuxedos, &quot;People screamed and hollered. It was an outrage&quot;.

Hardy was an early fan of Paco Rabanne, making the Spanish designer popular by wearing his creations for photoshoots and television performances. In 1968, she modeled a plated mini-dress made of pure gold at the International Diamond Fair. Made out of 1,000 gold plaques, 300 carats of diamonds, and weighing 20 pounds, it was considered to be &quot;the most expensive dress in the world in 1968&quot;. Rabanne&#x27;s designs, including the gold dress, would become some of Hardy&#x27;s most famous looks.

Hardy modelled creations of the nascent &quot;prêt-à-porter&quot; industry, a new wave of French female designers known as the &quot;yé-yé school&quot; or &quot;the &quot;stylistes&quot;&quot;, who rebelled against the &quot;strictures of &quot;haute couture&quot;&quot;. She helped to launch the career of Sonia Rykiel by wearing her influential &quot;poor boy sweater&quot; on the cover of &quot;Elle&quot;, and was photographed by David Bailey wearing Emmanuelle Khanh&#x27;s color-blocking coat for &quot;Vogue&quot;. Fashion Institute of Technology&#x27;s Colleen Hill considered Hardy&#x27;s style to be the most enduring of all the yé-yé girls, noting that &quot;her nonchalance is an important part of her appeal. Hardy&#x27;s fashion choices, such as her white Courrèges pantsuits and Yves Saint Laurent&#x27;s first Le Smoking, were distinctly &#x27;60s and streamlined, yet they also have an edge.&quot;

Hardy was also known for a pared-down style with discreet hairdos and makeup, often wearing a simple sweater and pants combination. Her signature look was defined by her bangs and use of white boots by Courrèges, and she was one of the first people to wear miniskirts. She also experimented with androgynous silhouettes. She was described as the &quot;anti-Bardot&quot;, imposing a beauty ideal that &quot;rendered the exaggerated femininity of the sex-kitten of the time old-fashioned&quot;. By the 1970s she had abandoned the image of a &quot;fashionable young girl about town&quot; that Périer had created for her.

===1960s universal myth===
Her public image and style during the 1960s made an impact on international pop culture, something that overshadowed her skills as a singer outside of France. In 1967, teen magazine &quot;Special Pop&quot; wrote: &quot;[Hardy] manages to attract both kids and their parents, men and women alike. More than a singer, she&#x27;s becoming a universal myth with whom thousands of young girls dream of identifying.&quot;

In the second half of the decade, Hardy became known as an inspiring cultural personality and was made a muse by numerous creative people. She was the subject of portraits by artists , Bernard Buffet, Gabriel Pasqualini and Jean-Paul Goude. In 1965, Jacques Prévert wrote a poem dedicated to the singer titled &quot;Une plante verte&quot;, which was read as part of Hardy&#x27;s performance at the Olympia. She was also the subject of a poem by Manuel Vázquez Montalbán and an open letter by Paul Guth. Belgian illustrator Guy Peellaert used Hardy as a model for the title character of his 1968 pop art and psychedelic-inspired comic &quot;Pravda la Survireuse&quot;, made in collaboration with French screenwriter Pascal Thomas.

The singer was admired by Spanish artist Salvador Dalí, who invited her to spend a week with him in Cadaqués in 1968. Hardy was also admired in the Swinging London scene and she acknowledged having been a &quot;source of fascination for the English pop musicians&quot;. Malcolm McLaren described her as the &quot;utmost of the pinup girl, pinned to the walls of every trendy pop apprentice&#x27;s bedroom down in Chelsea. Many bands in their prime, like the Beatles or the Stones, dreamt of dating her.&quot; Her image fascinated the young David Bowie, Mick Jagger (who described her as his &quot;ideal woman&quot;), Brian Jones, Morrissey, and Richard Thompson.

Bob Dylan was infatuated by Hardy and included a beat poem dedicated to her on the back cover of his 1964 album &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;. It began: &quot;for françoise hardy/at the seine&#x27;s edge/a giant shadow/of notre dame/seeks t&#x27; grab my foot/sorbonne students/whirl by on thin bicycles/swirlin&#x27; lifelike colors of leather spin...&quot; In 2018, Hardy told &quot;Uncut&quot; that she had drafts of the poem that Dylan had left in a café. She said, &quot;... I was very moved. This was a young man, a very romantic artist, who had a fixation on somebody only from a picture. You know how very young people are... I realised it had been very important for him.&quot; Hardy and Dylan met in May 1966, behind the scenes of his performance at Olympia. Noticing that Hardy was in the audience, Dylan had refused to go back on stage to perform the second half unless she went to his dressing room. She and other singers later joined Dylan at his suite in the Four Seasons Hotel George V, where he gave her early pressings of &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot; and &quot;I Want You&quot;.

===Political views===
As a public figure, Hardy was known for her frankness regarding her political views, which have been described as right-wing. She was raised in a Gaullist family and she told &quot;Télérama&quot; in 2011: &quot;I don&#x27;t like everything that is said or done on the right, and I don&#x27;t denigrate everything that is done or said on the left… basically I&#x27;m pretty centrist.&quot; In her 2008 autobiography, she wrote that she &quot;only 
identif[ed] with ecology&quot;, which she considered &quot;neither right nor left&quot;.

While promoting her album &quot;Décalages&quot;, Hardy was interviewed by the magazine &quot;Rockland.&quot; The conversation strayed into politics, the 1988 French presidential election having taken place the day before, and believing that an off-the-record discussion would not be included in the final article, Hardy expressed contempt for people on the left. She was outraged when the political part of the interview was published, and defended herself in a televised interview on 13 May with Thierry Ardisson, in which she recounted an altercation with singer Renaud, claiming that he had insulted her for her support of Minister of Culture François Léotard. In the &quot;Rockland&quot; interview, she commented about racism in France, saying &quot;We do not talk about anti-French racism, that there are places where you are more likely to enter if you are not French&quot;, as well as about antisemitism, suggesting that &quot;those who see it everywhere could actually be sowing its seeds.&quot; The singer wrote in her autobiography that she distanced herself from these remarks.

Hardy was an opponent of the solidarity tax on wealth (French: &quot;impôt de solidarité sur la fortune&quot;; ISF). She defended the tax shield put in place by the government of Nicolas Sarkozy in 2010 and denounced François Hollande&#x27;s tax program during the 2012 French presidential election, telling &quot;Paris Match&quot;: &quot;I believe that most people do not realize the tragedy that the ISF causes to people in my category. I am forced, almost 70 years old and ill, to sell my apartment and move out.&quot; This prompted her son Thomas Dutronc to write on Twitter: &quot;But no mom, don&#x27;t worry I&#x27;ll invite you over to my place just in case...&quot; Hardy later denied claims that she would be homeless and clarified that &quot;the tragedy is the people who are losing their jobs because of offshoring and the [European debt] crisis&quot;.

Hardy expressed her support for legalising abortion, while distancing herself from feminism. In 2015, the singer criticized feminist activists in her essay &quot;Avis non autorisés ...&quot;, in which she wrote: &quot;I find them surly, ugly, that is to say not feminine for two cents. I have never been able to identify in anything with feminists. There are, however, some that I could have idealized...&quot;

During the 2017–2018 protests in France, Hardy expressed her support for President Emmanuel Macron. She said &quot;We must let him reform France. Part of the French people don&#x27;t want to see the reality and are stuck in the Marxist ideology. What I like about President Macron is that he is an idealist but not an ideologue and is firmly grounded in reality.&quot; During the 2023 French pension reform strikes, she told &quot;Le Journal du Dimanche&quot; that she was &quot;ashamed of what was happening&quot; in France, fearing that &quot;repeated strikes&quot; would deter tourists, and defended the pension reform bill.

==Legacy and influence==

Hardy was celebrated as a &quot;French national treasure&quot; and one of the greatest figures in French music. She was one of the best-selling music artists in French history, with over 7.6 million records sold by November 2017. American critic Richie Unterberger described her as &quot;indisputably the finest pop-rock artist to emerge from that country in the 1960s&quot; and said he would like to see Hardy inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2011, Hardy was included in &quot;Le Petit Larousse Illustré&quot;.

Long after her heyday in the 1960s, Hardy continued to be regarded as an important and influential figure in fashion history. During his time at Balenciaga, designer Nicolas Ghesquière described her in &quot;Vogue&quot; as &quot;the very essence of French style&quot;. The photographs of the singer wearing a Paco Rabanne metal-plated dress inspired Lizzy Gardiner&#x27;s design of the costumes of &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; and her own Oscars dress. Hardy was a muse to Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo, who named her label Comme des Garçons after a lyric in the song &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot;.

Over her career, Hardy amassed a large fanbase among gay men and was regarded as a gay icon by the community. She said on several occasions that her most devoted friends and fans were gay.

Hardy&#x27;s musical influence is found in the work of Francophone acts such as Coralie Clément, La Femme, Juliette Armanet, Melody&#x27;s Echo Chamber, Keren Ann and Carla Bruni, who imitated Hardy&#x27;s style for her musical debut. Writers have pointed to her influence on the music of English avant-pop group Stereolab, including similarities in Hardy&#x27;s vocals and those of lead singer Lætitia Sadier. Outside the French-speaking world, she has been mentioned as an inspiration to female singer-songwriters like Caroline Polachek, Charli XCX, Angel Olsen, Candie Payne, Erin Rae, Heather Trost, Violetta Zironi, Zooey Deschanel and Cat Power. Hardy has also influenced alternative music acts such as Broadcast, Goldfrapp, Jeremy Jay, The Chap and Xeno &amp; Oaklander. In an article for Into Creative, Filmmaker Grant McPhee described her as &#x27;A poster-girl for shy people and a fantasy figure for believing they too can be cool&#x27; In 2021, Rivers Cuomo of American rock band Weezer cited Hardy as one of his &quot;sonic ideals&quot;, and side he was particularly influenced by her album &quot;Message personnel&quot;. Greg Gonzalez of American dream pop band Cigarettes After Sex called Hardy one of his biggest musical influences, stating in 2016: &quot;&quot;La question&quot; is just so perfect, I wanted that kind of beauty.&quot;

The 1971 cult album &quot;La question&quot; appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s &quot;1000 albums to hear before you die&quot;. The album would gain a cult following after its release and it became regarded as Hardy&#x27;s artistic peak.

In 2017, Pitchfork ranked &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot; ninetieth on its list of &quot;The 200 Best Albums of the 1960s&quot;, with Marc Hogan describing it as &quot;an enduring middle ground between rockabilly shimmy and Gallic introspection, delivered by the most glamorous wallflower in France.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Hardy at number 162 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

=== Personal assessment on career ===
Hardy was critical of her first albums, &quot;Tous les garçons et les filles&quot; and &quot;Le premier bonheur du jour&quot;, despite their popularity. She said in interviews in 2018 that she &quot;felt very frustrated because I wanted to have beautiful electric guitars… Instead, I had very bad French musicians and a terribly bad musical production.&quot; After she went to London in 1963 to record new albums, she felt able &quot;to make another kind of music, not this mechanical music I had been trapped in.&quot;

Despite the poor commercial performances of her early 1970s releases, &quot;La question&quot;, &quot;Et si je m&#x27;en vais avant toi&quot;, and &quot;If You Listen,&quot; Hardy felt artistically vindicated. She felt especially proud of &quot;La question&quot;, stating in 2008: &quot;while it did not enjoy great success with the public at large, at least I can claim that it did touch another audience… Often an ambitious record can be more or less ignored when it is released but ends up having a long life.&quot; In 1996 interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, Hardy said she believed that most people did not know her artistry, and that she always had to talk about the 1960s and the Beatles.

== Personal life ==

===Family===

In 1962 Hardy formed a romantic and professional relationship with &quot;Salut Les Copains&quot; photographer Jean-Marie Périer. They did not live together and were constantly apart because of their work obligations, which took a toll on the relationship. They broke up in 1966 but remained close friends and collaborators. Hardy began a highly publicized relationship with singer Jacques Dutronc in 1967. After the birth of their only child, a son Thomas, on 16 June 1973, Hardy and Dutronc moved into in a three-story house near Parc Montsouris in the autumn of 1974. The family moved every summer to a house owned by Dutronc in Lumio on the island of Corsica. As an adult, Hardy&#x27;s son Thomas Dutronc also developed a career as a musician.

Hardy and Dutronc were married on 30 March 1981 in a private ceremony. According to Hardy, they formalized their relationship for &quot;fiscal reasons&quot;, and on the advice of Hardy&#x27;s lawyer for health and safety reasons. The couple separated in 1988 due to infidelities on both parts and Dutronc&#x27;s alcoholism. They never divorced and their relationship became a &quot;special friendship&quot;. In 2016, She told &quot;Le Parisien&quot; that although Dutronc had a new partner, he did not want a divorce from Hardy.

In the early 1980s, she learned that her distant father had led a double life as a closeted gay man when one of his young lovers bragged about his financial support to one of Dutronc&#x27;s friends. He died in a hospital on 6 February 1981 after being assaulted, probably by a young male prostitute, which was not reported in the press at the time. Hardy&#x27;s sister Michèle was raised without the affection of their parents, and developed suicidal and paranoid schizophrenic tendencies. In May 2004 she was found dead at her home in L&#x27;Île-Rousse from a probable suicide.

===Health and death===
Between late 2004 and early 2005 Hardy was diagnosed with MALT lymphoma, which inaugurated a &quot;hellish period&quot; that disrupted her life. She underwent chemotherapy treatment that was initially successful. In March 2015, her condition worsened and she had to be admitted to hospital, where she was put into an artificial coma and nearly died. While in hospital, she broke her hip and elbow. She told &quot;Le Figaro&quot; in 2015: &quot;I also have a lot of difficulty walking… There are times when I absolutely cannot see anyone and I cannot go out. But I remain positive… I avoid thinking about it, it does not obsess me.&quot; 

Hardy underwent further chemotherapy and immunotherapy sessions. Her health worsened, and in 2021 she made news as an advocate for the legalization of physician-assisted suicide in France. She said in interviews that if her condition became unbearable to the point where she can no longer &quot;do the things that [her] life requires&quot;, she would resort to euthanasia, but would not have the consultation to do so. In the same year, she disclosed that she could no longer sing as a result of the effects of the treatments.

Francoise Hardy died of laryngeal cancer in Paris, on 11 June 2024, at the age of 80. Prior to her death she had also experienced several falls and bone fractures. Her son announced her death on Instagram, writing &quot;Mom is gone…&quot;

 a farewell ceremony took place at Père Lachaise Cemetery at the crematorium and columbarium building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figaro/AFP 2024-06-15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The Eagle Eye program began in 1993 with the TR911X 7/8th scale prototype. The composite airframe was originally designed and built for Bell by the California research company &quot;Scaled Composites&quot;. The two demonstrator aircraft were powered by an Allison 250-C20 turboshaft engine mounted in the center fuselage, with a transmission system driving a tilting rotor at the end of each wing.

The aircraft had its maiden flight on March 6, 1998, and then entered a flight test program. Phase 1 (land-based operations testing) was completed in April 1998. Phase 2 (sea-based testing) started shortly after that. The first prototype was destroyed in an accident, but the second successfully completed the test program.

These successes led to the entry into the Deepwater program in 2002 and construction of the full size vehicle, called the TR918, powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW207D turboshaft engine.

Bell had promoted the Eagle Eye for a decade without finding a buyer, but in the summer of 2002, the United States Coast Guard ordered the UAV as part of the service&#x27;s broad Deepwater re-equipment effort. The Coast Guard machine was slightly scaled up from the company demonstrator and was designated as Bell HV-911. It had a maximum speed of 200 kts (370 km/h) and an endurance of 5.5 hours with a 200-pound (90 kilogram) payload. The USCG then put funds marked for development and procurement of the vehicle on hold.

The US Navy and Marine Corps also expressed some interest, and there were inquiries from various foreign governments. In the summer of 2004, Bell established a relationship with Sagem in France and Rheinmetall Defense Electronics in Germany to sell variants of the Eagle Eye to European governments. Bell proposed to provide raw airframes, the European partners would provide payloads and other gear as specified by customers, and Bell would perform system integration.

The Eagle Eye prototype crashed in 2006, and Bell could not get enough interest or money to keep the program going. However, in January 2016, the U.S. Army said it was searching for a mid-sized &quot;runway independent&quot; UAV, years after losing interest in the Northrop Grumman MQ-8 Fire Scout. Although the Army has not specified whether it wants a rotorcraft, VTOL, tiltrotor, launch and recover, or other runway independent design, Bell sees potential for the Eagle Eye to meet Army requirements.

<doc id="1028180" wikidata="Q470038" url="?curid=1028180" title="Mediatised houses">
<text>The mediatised houses (or mediatized houses, ) were ruling princely and comital-ranked houses that were mediatised in the Holy Roman Empire during the period 1803–1815 as part of German mediatisation, and were later recognised in 1825–1829 by the German ruling houses as possessing considerable rights and rank. With few exceptions, these houses were those whose heads held a seat in the Imperial Diet when mediatised during the establishment of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806–07, by France in 1810, or by the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15. The mediatised houses were organised into two ranks: the princely houses, entitled to the predicate &quot;Durchlaucht&quot; (Serene Highness), which previously possessed a vote on the Bench of Princes (&quot;Furstenbank&quot;); and the comital houses that were accorded the address of &quot;Erlaucht&quot; (Illustrious Highness), which previously possessed a vote in one of the four Benches of Counts (&quot;Gräfenbank&quot;). Although some form of mediatisation occurred in other countries, such as France, Italy and Russia, only designated houses within the former Holy Roman Empire legally comprised the mediatised houses.

==Privileges==
Mediatised houses generally possessed greater rights than other German noble families. Whilst they lost sovereignty and certain rights (such as legislation, taxation, appellate jurisdiction, and control over policing and conscription) in their territories, they often still retained their private estates and some feudal rights, which may have included exclusive or primary access to local forestry, fishing, mining or hunting resources, jurisdiction over policing and lower level civil and criminal court cases. Mediatised houses also possessed the right to settle anywhere within the German Confederation while retaining their territorial prerogatives. The Congress of Vienna specified that the mediatised houses were recognised as the first vassals in their respective states, were usually entitled to membership in the legislative upper chambers in which their lands lay (such as the Austrian or Prussian House of Lords), and held rank equivalent to ruling houses. However the Congress of Vienna did not specify which families were considered mediatised.

Members of mediatised houses possessed a rank higher than other German ducal, princely and comital families which held the same or even a higher hereditary title. For example, a prince (&quot;Fürst&quot;) of a mediatised house ranked higher than a duke (&quot;Herzog&quot;) of a family that had never possessed Imperial immediacy, even though in Germany, nominally, a duke is of higher rank than a prince.

==Equality of birth==
Most importantly, members of the mediatised houses were recognized as entitled to retain the equality of birth their families had enjoyed under the Holy Roman Empire with Germany&#x27;s reigning dynasties, who inter-married by right with the other ruling houses of Europe. Although this privilege did not automatically require that every ruling family had to accept all members of mediatised families as eligible for dynastic inter-marriage (see Countess Auguste von Harrach), each mediatised family was allowed to impose its own marital standards by house law, and could be accepted by ruling families without legal demur. This had practical effects in determining whether a marriage was considered morganatic or not, and what rights the children of such a marriage might possess.

It was ultimately left up to each of the sovereign states to determine which families were counted as part of the mediatised houses and which were not, leading to discrepancies between the roster of the Imperial Diet in 1806 and the families counted amongst the mediatised. Prior to 1806, the term &quot;exemption&quot; was used to refer to states which surrendered their immediacy and high jurisdiction rights to another state but retained their votes in the Imperial Diet. Not all &quot;exempt&quot; houses were counted amongst the mediatised houses. Further discrepancies exist because the houses were mediatised between 1806–1814 and the rosters of the princely and comital mediatised houses were not drawn up until 1825 and 1829 respectively, during which period some families had become extinct or sold those of their territories to which the rights of mediatisation appertained.

From 1836 the &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot; listed the mediatised houses in a section of their own, separate from both ruling dynasties and from princely and ducal families which were not recognized as having exercised sovereignty since the Congress of Vienna.

The rights of the mediatised houses in Austria and Czechoslovakia were abolished in 1919 following the defeat of Austria-Hungary in World War I and the establishment of republics in those countries. Rights were also abolished in Germany in 1919, however the abolition was not initially enforced.

The following lists are exhaustive, including all of the mediatised houses.

==List of Princely mediatised houses (&quot;Durchlaucht&quot;)==
==List of Comital mediatised houses (&quot;Erlaucht&quot;)==
==List of Houses not considered as part of the mediatised houses==
Listed below are houses that for one reason or another were not counted amongst the mediatised houses. Usually this is because
*they became extinct before the formalisation of the mediatised houses in 1825/9, 
*they divested their immediate territories just before the German mediatisation in 1806, or
*they surrendered their mediate rights before 1825/9.

The formal list of the mediatised Houses generally does not include the families of imperial immediacy bearers belonging to old Imperial States outside the German Confederation (France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands).

<doc id="1028184" wikidata="Q2907803" url="?curid=1028184" title="Bob Runciman">
<text>Robert William &quot;Bob&quot; Runciman (born August 10, 1942) is a Canadian politician and former provincial Leader of the Opposition in the Ontario Legislature. First elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1981, he held the seat continuously for Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario for the next 29 years. On January 29, 2010, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada as a Conservative, where he served until August 10, 2017.

==Early career==
Before going to Queen&#x27;s Park, Runciman owned a local weekly newspaper, and sat as a municipal councillor in Brockville from 1972 to 1981. He also worked in production management in the chemical industry.

==Provincial politics==
He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1981 provincial election as a Progressive Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Leeds in eastern Ontario. He was returned in each subsequent provincial election, and later represented the riding of Leeds—Grenville.

===Miller cabinet===
Runciman served as Minister of Government Services from February 8 to May 17, 1985, and as Minister of Consumer Relations from May 17 to June 26, 1985, in the short-lived cabinet of Ontario Premier Frank Miller.


===Opposition===
With the defeat of Miller&#x27;s government on a vote of confidence, Runciman joined his party on the opposition benches. He was nearly defeated by Liberal Jim Jordan in the 1987 election, winning by only 198 votes. On all other occasions, he has been re-elected without difficulty. Despite being on the right-wing of the party, Runciman endorsed Red Tory Larry Grossman for the party leadership in November 1985.

===Harris and Eves cabinet===
When the Tories returned to power in the 1995 election, Runciman became Solicitor General and Minister of Correctional Services in the government of Mike Harris, holding the position from June 26, 1995, to June 17, 1999. During this period, he championed privately owned prisons, and was criticized on one occasion for revealing the name of a young offender in the legislature. On June 17, 1999, he was moved to the portfolio of Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations, and on February 8, 2001, was named Minister of Economic Development and Trade.

Runciman supported Ernie Eves&#x27;s successful bid to succeed Harris as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in 2002. On April 15, 2002, Eves re-appointed Runciman to the position of Minister of Public Safety and Security (as the position of Solicitor General became known in the period following the September 11 attacks).

On August 6, 2003, Runciman made controversial comments in the wake of tensions between Toronto&#x27;s black community and the city&#x27;s police. &quot;I think some people make a living off this,&quot; Runciman said. &quot;People who don&#x27;t accept any degree of responsibility to solve the challenges and misunderstandings.&quot; After confirming that he was referring to members of the black community, he went on to say that &quot;some folks here appear to have, in my view, a vested interest in seeing this kind of tension continue to exist.&quot; His comments were later condemned by the Canadian Race Relations foundation and several other opposition MPP&#x27;s.


===Return to opposition===
Runciman returned to the opposition benches with the defeat of the Eves government in the 2003 election. He supported John Tory in the leadership election to succeed Eves. Tory won the contest, and, not having a seat in the legislature, named Runciman to the position of interim Leader of the Opposition in September 2004.

Although Runciman holds strongly conservative views on matters such as criminal justice, he was not regarded as one of the more ideological members of his caucus. In recent years, he has played a significant role in his party&#x27;s leadership transitions.

Runciman resumed the position of opposition leader following the 2007 provincial election in which John Tory failed to win a seat in the Legislature, losing to Liberal Minister Kathleen Wynne. Tory stayed on as Party Leader until March 2009 when he lost a subsequent bid to get elected in a by-election and resigned. Following Tory&#x27;s resignation as Party Leader in March 2009, members of the PC Caucus selected Runciman as interim Party Leader until Tim Hudak was elected to the position in June 2009.





==Federal politics==
Runciman supported Tom Long&#x27;s bid to lead the Canadian Alliance in 2000. When Long was dropped from the contest after the first ballot, he turned his support to Stockwell Day, the eventual winner.

In the 2004 federal Conservative leadership campaign, Runciman was an early supporter of eventual winner Stephen Harper.

On May 17, 2005, Runciman was chastised for remarks he made about federal member of Parliament Belinda Stronach&#x27;s decision to cross the floor from the Conservative Party of Canada to the Liberal Party of Canada. Runciman said, &quot;She sort of defined herself as something of a dipstick, an attractive one, but still a dipstick.&quot;

Runciman was appointed to the Canadian Senate on the recommendation of Prime Minister Harper on January 29, 2010. He is seen as an ally of Harper in advocating of Senate reform and a &quot;law and order&quot; agenda. He served in the Senate until reaching the mandatory retirement age on August 10, 2017.

== Memoirs ==
Runciman officially released his memoirs of his 45-year career at an event at the Royal Brock Centre in Brockville, Ontario on June 30, 2023, two days after launching his website. In the memoirs, Runciman discusses the Ipperwash shooting of Dudley George, his resignation as Solicitor-General over a breach of the Young Offenders Act which was later determined he was not guilty of, and addresses his controversial remarks about Belinda Stronach after she crossed the floor from the Conservative Party to the Liberal Party in 2005. He also shares stories including hiding on the floor of the Ontario Legislature to avoid votes, his supportive relationship with father, Publisher and Musician Sandy Runciman, and his marriage to Jeannette Runciman (née Bax), who died in a tragic accident in 2020, and who has an island named for her in the Thousand Islands region of Eastern Ontario.

<text>The Tecopa pupfish (Cyprinodon nevadensis calidae) is an extinct subspecies of the Amargosa pupfish (&quot;Cyprinodon nevadensis&quot;). The small, heat-tolerant pupfish was endemic to the outflows of a pair of hot springs in the Mojave Desert of Inyo County, California. Habitat modifications, the introduction of non-native species and hybridization with the related Amargosa River pupfish led to its extinction around 1979.

==Taxonomy==
The Tecopa pupfish is member of the genus &quot;Cyprinodon&quot; of the pupfish family Cyprinodontidae, a taxon of killifish most diverse in North America. Most divergence of local &quot;Cyprinodon&quot; species likely took place during the early-to-mid Pleistocene, a time when pluvial lakes intermittently filled the now-desert region, though some may have occurred during the last 10,000 years. The evaporation of the lakes resulted in the geographic isolation of small &quot;Cyprinodon&quot; populations in remnant wetlands and the speciation of &quot;C. nevadensis&quot;.

&quot;C. n. calidae&quot; was first described as a subspecies in 1948 by Robert Rush Miller, after six years of study. Miller also identified five other subspecies: the Amargosa River pupfish (&quot;C. n. amargosae&quot;), the Ash Meadows pupfish (&quot;C. n. mionectes&quot;), the Saratoga Springs pupfish (&quot;C. n. nevadensis&quot;), the Warm Springs pupfish (&quot;C. n. pectoralis&quot;), and the Shoshone pupfish (&quot;C. n. shoshone&quot;).

Other local &quot;Cyprinodons&quot; include the Death Valley pupfish (&quot;Cyprinodon salinus&quot;), the Devil&#x27;s Hole pupfish, (&quot;Cyprinodon diabolis&quot;) the desert pupfish (&quot;Cyprinodon macularius&quot;) and the Owens pupfish (&quot;Cyprinodon radiosus&quot;).

==Description and behavior==
The fish were about 1–1.5 inches (2.5–4 cm) in length. The dorsal fin was positioned closer to the tail than the head. The pelvic fin was small or sometimes absent, and had six lepidotrichia. Similar to some other &quot;Cyprinodons&quot;, breeding males displayed a bright blue coloration. Females had between six and ten vertical stripes.

&quot;C. n. calidae&quot; primarily ate cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). Invertebrates such as mosquito larvae provided occasional nutrition. The fish were capable of surviving water temperatures of 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 °C) or more.

==Decline and extinction==
Tecopa Hot Springs lies at an elevation of 1,411 feet (430 m), about 2 miles north of the town of Tecopa in Inyo County, California. The outflows of the two hot springs are tributaries of the Amargosa River, and were the only place where &quot;C. n. calidae&quot; existed.

The popularity of the springs in the 1950s and 1960s led to the extensive alteration of the pupfishes&#x27; habitat. During the construction of bathhouses, the hot spring pools were enlarged and the outflows diverted. In 1965, the outflows of the northern and southern hot springs were re-channeled and merged. The resulting swifter currents caused downstream water temperatures to rise above a level to which the pupfish were adapted. Modifications also allowed the related Amargosa River pupfish (&quot;C. n. amargosae&quot;) to migrate upstream from the Amargosa River and hybridize with the Tecopa pupfish.

In 1966, Miller found that the population at Tecopa Hot Springs was nearly extinct. A population was found at a reservoir at a nearby motel two years later, but its smaller scales suggested that it may have already hybridized with the Amargosa River pupfish. In 1970, concerns over this habitat alteration and the presence of non-native species such as the bluegill and the western mosquitofish led to its inclusion in both Federal and California lists of endangered species.

The last confirmed specimens of &quot;C. n. calidae&quot; were collected on February 2, 1970, and the subspecies was probably extinct by the next year. Further surveys in 1972 and 1977 returned no examples of the fish. In 1978, United States Fish and Wildlife Service announced that it was considering delisting the fish, with Assistant Secretary of the Interior Robert L. Herbst calling the loss &quot;totally avoidable&quot; and saying, &quot;The human projects which so disrupted its habitat, if carefully planned, could have ensured its survival.&quot; In 1981, after an exhaustive search of over 40 locations, the Fish and Wildlife Service officially declared the fish extinct. It was the first animal removed from the provisions of the 1973 Endangered Species Act as a result of its extinction.

<text>Code page 437 ([[CCSID]] 437) is the character set of the original IBM PC (personal computer). It is also known as CP437, OEM-US, OEM 437, PC-8, or MS-DOS Latin US. The set includes all printable ASCII characters as well as some accented letters (diacritics), Greek letters, icons, and line-drawing symbols. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;OEM font&quot; or &quot;high ASCII&quot;, or as &quot;extended ASCII&quot; (one of many mutually incompatible ASCII extensions).

This character set remains the primary set in the core of any EGA and VGA-compatible graphics card. As such, text shown when a PC reboots, before fonts can be loaded and rendered, is typically rendered using this character set. Many file formats developed at the time of the IBM PC are based on code page 437 as well.

==Display adapters==

The original IBM PC contained this font as a 9×14 pixels-per-character font stored in the ROM of the IBM Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and an 8×8 pixels-per-character font of the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) cards. The IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) contained an 8×14 pixels-per-character version, and the VGA contained a 9×16 version.

All these display adapters have text modes in which each character cell contains an 8-bit character code point (see details), giving 256 possible values for graphic characters. All 256 codes were assigned a graphical character in ROM, including the codes from 0 to 31 that were reserved in ASCII for non-graphical control characters.

Various Eastern European PCs used different character sets, sometimes user-selectable via jumpers or CMOS setup. These sets were designed to match 437 as much as possible, for instance sharing the code points for many of the line-drawing characters, while still allowing text in a local language to be displayed.

== Alt codes ==
A legacy of code page 437 is the number combinations used in Windows Alt codes. A DOS user could enter a character by holding down the Alt key and entering the character code on the numpad and many users memorized the numbers needed for CP437 (or for the similar CP850). Although Microsoft Windows used different character sets such as CP1252, the original numbers were emulated so users could continue to use them; Microsoft added the ability to type a code from the Windows character set by typing 0 before the digits.

== Character set ==
The following tables show code page 437. Each character is shown with its equivalent Unicode code point (when it is not equal to the character&#x27;s code). A tooltip, generally available only when one points to the immediate left of the character, shows the Unicode code point name and the decimal Alt code. See also the notes below, as there are multiple equivalent Unicode characters for some code points.

Although the ROM provides a graphic for all 256 different possible 8-bit codes, some APIs will not print some code points, in particular the range 0-31 and the code at 127. Instead, they will interpret them as control characters. For instance, many methods of outputting text on the original IBM PC would interpret hex codes 07, 08, 0A, and 0D as BEL, BS, LF, and CR, respectively. Many printers were also unable to print these characters.

When translating to Unicode some codes do not have a unique, single Unicode equivalent; the correct choice may depend upon context.
== History ==

The repertoire of code page 437 was taken from the character set of Wang word-processing machines, according to Bill Gates in an interview with Gates and Paul Allen that appeared in the 2 October 1995 edition of &quot;Fortune Magazine:&quot;

: &quot;... We were also fascinated by dedicated word processors from Wang, because we believed that general-purpose machines could do that just as well. That&#x27;s why, when it came time to design the keyboard for the IBM PC, we put the funny Wang character set into the machine—you know, smiley faces and boxes and triangles and stuff. We were thinking we&#x27;d like to do a clone of Wang word-processing software someday.&quot;

According to an interview with David J. Bradley (developer of the PC&#x27;s ROM-BIOS) the characters were decided upon during a four-hour meeting on a plane trip from Seattle to Atlanta by Andy Saenz (responsible for the video card), Lew Eggebrecht (chief engineer for the PC) and himself.

The selection of graphic characters has some internal logic:
* Table rows 0 and 1, codes 0 to 31 (00hex to 1Fhex), are assorted dingbats (complementary and decorative characters). The isolated character 127 (7Fhex) also belongs to this group.
* Table rows 2 to 7, codes 32 to 126 (20hex to 7Ehex), are the standard ASCII printable characters.
* Table rows 8 to 10, codes 128 to 175 (80hex to AFhex), are a selection of international text characters.
* Table rows 11 to 13, codes 176 to 223 (B0hex to DFhex), are box drawing and block characters. This block is arranged so that characters 192 to 223 (C0hex to DFhex) contain all the right arms and right-filled areas. The original IBM PC MDA display adapter stored the code page 437 character glyphs as bitmaps eight pixels wide, but for visual enhancement displayed them every nine pixels on screen. This range of characters had the eighth pixel column duplicated by special hardware circuitry, thus filling in gaps in lines and filled areas. The VGA adapter allows this behaviour to be turned on or off.
* Table rows 14 and 15, codes 224 to 254 (E0hex to FEhex) are devoted to mathematical symbols, where the first twelve are a selection of Greek letters commonly used in physics.

Most fonts for Microsoft Windows include the special graphic characters at the Unicode indexes shown, as they are part of the WGL4 set that Microsoft encourages font designers to support. (The monospaced raster font family Terminal was an early font that replicated all code page 437 characters, at least at some resolutions.) To draw these characters directly from these code points, a Microsoft Windows font called MS Linedraw replicates all of the code page 437 characters, thus providing one way to display DOS text on a modern Windows machine as it was shown in DOS, with limitations.

Code page 1055, also known as HP symbol set 0L, is a subset which includes the box-drawing, half-blocks, black circles (the black circle replaces the bullet, which replaces the middle dot in this code page), and black square, and moves them to the upper half; the space is also included.

== Internationalization ==

Code page 437 has a series of international characters, mainly values 128 to 175 (80hex to AFhex). However, it only covers a few major Western European languages in full, including English, German and Swedish, and so lacks several characters (mostly capital letters) important to many major Western European languages:
* Spanish: Á, Í, Ó, and Ú
* French: À, Â, È, Ê, Ë, Î, Ï, Ô, Œ, œ, Ù, Û, and Ÿ
* Portuguese: Á, À, Â, Ã, ã, Ê, Í, Ó, Ô, Õ, õ, and Ú
* Catalan: À, È, Í, Ï, Ò, Ó, and Ú
* Italian: À, È, Ì, Ò, and Ù
* Icelandic: Á, Ð, ð, Í, Ó, Ú, Ý, ý, Þ, and þ
* Danish/Norwegian: Ø and ø. Character number 237 (EDhex), the small phi (closed form), could be used as a surrogate even though it may not render well (furthermore, it tends to map to Unicode, and/or render in Unicode fonts, as the open-form phi or the closed-vertical-form phi, which are even further from the O with stroke). To compensate, the Danish/Norwegian and Icelandic code pages (865 and 861) replaced cent sign (¢) with ø and the yen sign (¥) with Ø.
* Most Greek alphabet symbols were omitted, beyond the basic math symbols. (They were included in the Greek-language code pages 737 and 869. Some of the Greek symbols that were already in code page 437 had their glyphs changed from mathematical or scientific forms to match the actual use in Greek.)

Along with the cent (¢), pound sterling (£) and yen/yuan (¥) currency symbols, it has a couple of former European currency symbols: the florin (ƒ, Netherlands) and the peseta (₧, Spain). The presence of the last is unusual, since the Spanish peseta was never an internationally relevant currency, and also never had a symbol of its own; it was simply abbreviated as &quot;Pt&quot;, &quot;Pta&quot;, &quot;Pts&quot;, or &quot;Ptas&quot;. Spanish models of the IBM electric typewriter, however, also had a single position devoted to it.

Later DOS character sets, such as code page 850 (DOS Latin-1), code page 852 (DOS Central-European) and code page 737 (DOS Greek), filled the gaps for international use with some compatibility with code page 437 by retaining the single and double box-drawing characters, while discarding the mixed ones (&quot;e.g.&quot; horizontal double/vertical single). All code page 437 characters have similar glyphs in Unicode and in Microsoft&#x27;s WGL4 character set, and therefore are available in most fonts in Microsoft Windows, and also in the default VGA font of the Linux kernel, and the ISO 10646 fonts for X11.

<doc id="1028189" wikidata="Q7562451" url="?curid=1028189" title="Sony Connect">
<text>Sony Connect, stylised Sony CONNECT, was the name for a series of related software products by Sony, most notably the Connect Music Store online music store. Sony CONNECT Inc. was a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America.

Sony Connect was Sony&#x27;s second attempt at online music following PressPlay.

==Connect Music Store==
The CONNECT Music Store was Sony&#x27;s music store built within the SonicStage music management application for Microsoft Windows-based personal computers. It was one of the world&#x27;s largest online music download stores with over 2.5 million tracks to preview and purchase, with over 10,000 new songs added every Tuesday.

In 2003, Robert Shahnazarian began producing exclusive recording only available to users of Sony Connect. These sessions were the brain child of Ty Braswell and Neil Schield to provide exclusive content to users of Sony Connect&#x27;s music platform. These session were recorded at Sony Studios in Santa Monica along with Westlake Recording Studios. These “exclusive” sessions were known as the Live from the Connect living-room series, and were recorded and mixed by Robert Shahnazarian. Over 350 sessions were recorded for this series and included such artists as Taylor Swift, John Legend, David Crosby &amp; Graham Nash, Tears for Fears, and Brand Carlile to name just a few.

The CONNECT Music Store closed in North America and Europe on 31 March 2008, and the website has been unavailable from 1 March 2008. However, in late 2008, Sony launched a new online music store called &quot;bandit.fm&quot; on a trial basis in several countries, particularly Australia and New Zealand. The store was never launched globally, and closed in 2016. In 2010, Sony also launched another store named Music Unlimited which at first was compatible with PlayStation devices.

&quot;Sony Connect&quot; was also the name given to the software used to manage book, music and image content on the Sony Reader; it has since been renamed Sony eBook Library.

The SonicStage software transferred music tracks to Sony media devices like Network Walkman, CD Walkman, Hi-MD, PSP (via the Memory Stick), Clie handheld or Vaio computers, but did not transfer to non-Sony hardware.

==Connect Video==
Sony CONNECT Video was a division within Sony CONNECT developing digital service platforms to enable distribution of next-generation entertainment to Sony devices.

Users could download video content directly to their device wirelessly or by means of using the USB port and their computer.

==Connect Player==

CONNECT Player was a media player application, developed by Sony Connect, a division of Sony Corporation of America in 2005. It was released for European and Japanese market in November 2005 to be used with Sony&#x27;s new HDD digital music players - the NW-A Series Walkman (A1000 and A3000).

In January 2006, Sony Europe recommended users to change to SonicStage (Sony&#x27;s earlier media player) pending potential further updates to the CONNECT Player software due to thousands of reports regarding its many problems. In May 2006, Connect Player was absorbed into a newly released SonicStage version called SonicStage CP (the letters bearing the name).

==Compatibility==
The CONNECT Music Store was only accessible via Internet Explorer on computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system.

Files downloaded from the CONNECT Music Store were encrypted using Sony&#x27;s digital rights management, in the OpenMG (*.omg &amp; *.oma) file format. Audio content is encrypted using an OpenMG compliant program — SonicStage — and stored on a computer&#x27;s hard disk for playback or transfer to a Sony media device. The file format is ATRAC3, Sony&#x27;s proprietary compressed music format.

<doc id="1028193" wikidata="Q701990" url="?curid=1028193" title="Hisashi Owada">
<text>is a Japanese former jurist, diplomat and law professor. He served as a judge on the International Court of Justice from 6 February 2003 until 7 June 2018, and was president of the court from 2009 to 2012. He is the father of Empress Masako and the father-in-law of the incumbent Emperor of Japan, Naruhito.

==Early life and family==
Owada was born in Shibata, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, the third of seven children.

Owada&#x27;s father Takeo is descended from the Owada clan, whose head Shinroku—Masako&#x27;s 4th-great-grandfather—was called to Murakami in 1787 to serve the Naito clan which the Tokugawa shōgun had installed as the city&#x27;s rulers sixty-seven years earlier. After the fall of the shogunate, the Owadas participated in a salmon-fishing cooperative, the proceeds of which provided schooling for many local children, including Takeo.

Takeo became principal of a prefectural high school in modern-day Joetsu city and head of its board of education. Takeo and his wife would have seven children, all of whom survived infancy to graduate from university or teaching college. His five sons all graduated from the University of Tokyo—Akira, who would become assistant professor at the University of London and professor at Senshu University; Takashi, who would become a lawyer; Hisashi; Osamu, who would become head of the Japan National Tourist Organization; and Makoto, who would become an inspector at the Ministry of Transportation&#x27;s Ports and Harbors Bureau. His two daughters Yasuko and Toshiko would marry highly, the former to managing director of Krosaki-Harima Tadashi Katada and the latter to one-time managing director of the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ) Kazuhide Kashiwabara.

==Career==

After earning a B.A. from the University of Tokyo in 1955, Owada passed the civil service examinations to join the Diplomatic and Consular Service, now known as the Foreign Service.

===Educator===

Owada received sponsorship from the Foreign Ministry to study at Trinity College, Cambridge in the United Kingdom where he earned a law degree in 1959 and later a doctorate of philosophy. Overall he served as a law professor for three decades at the University of Tokyo, Harvard Law School, New York University Law School, Columbia Law School, The Hague Academy of International Law, Waseda University, and the University of Cambridge. In between postings he took semesters as a visiting professor in international treaty law, his specialty, at Harvard and at Oxford. He also served as the Bright International Jurist-in-Residence at the University of Hawaii&#x27;s William S. Richardson School of Law in 2010. He has received honorary degrees from Keiwa College, Banaras Hindu University, and Waseda University.

===Diplomat===

Owada&#x27;s first foreign assignment was Moscow, serving from 1963 to 1969. Immediately following, from 1969 to 1971, was a post at the United Nations in New York, New York.

Returning to Japan, Owada was chosen to accompany Emperor Hirohito on his first postwar trip outside Japan to Europe. From 1976 to 1978, he served as private secretary to Takeo Fukuda, the Prime Minister of Japan.

From 1979 to 1981, while serving as visiting professor at Harvard Law School, Owada &quot;remain[ed] on the Foreign Ministry payroll with the title of Minister at the Embassy in Washington, and would resume his career with another plum posting the following year.&quot; After this, however, the Owadas would move again to Moscow save for Masako, who would stay behind to enroll as a student at Harvard University.

In 1988, Owada was appointed Japanese ambassador to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris. He served for a year before returning to Japan, working first as Deputy Minister and from 1991 to 1993 as Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs.

From 1994 to 1998, he served as Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, where he served twice as United Nations Security Council President.

From 1999 to 2000 Owada then served as senior adviser to the President of the World Bank. Owada was president of the Japan Institute of International Affairs and adviser to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs until 2003.

===Post-Diplomat===
Having been re-elected to the ICJ in 2011, Owada&#x27;s term was set to expire on 5 February 2021 prior to his retirement in June, 2018. He received 170 out of 192 votes in the General Assembly on the first round, more than any other candidate, and 14 out of 15 votes in the Security Council on the first round. Owada had been nominated by the Japanese national group of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (as well as the national groups of 32 other countries).

He is currently a member of the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute&#x27;s International Council, and a member of the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative Advisory Council, a project of the Harris Institute at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis to establish the world’s first treaty on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity.

==Personal life==

In 1962, at age 30, Hisashi married 25 year-old Yumiko Egashira, introduced to him by a mutual friend and later employer Takeo Fukuda. A year later, their eldest daughter Masako was born at Toranomon Hospital in Tokyo, followed by twins Reiko and Setsuko in the summer of 1966 in Geneva, Switzerland.

In 1993, Hisashi&#x27;s daughter Masako Owada, a diplomat in her own right, married Crown Prince Naruhito, the heir to the Japanese Chrysanthemum Throne. Following Emperor Akihito&#x27;s 2019 abdication, she became empress consort.

<text>Warsaw School of Mathematics is the name given to a group of mathematicians who worked at Warsaw, Poland, in the two decades between the World Wars, especially in the fields of logic, set theory, point-set topology and real analysis. They published in the journal &quot;Fundamenta Mathematicae&quot;, founded in 1920—one of the world&#x27;s first specialist pure-mathematics journals. It was in this journal, in 1933, that Alfred Tarski—whose illustrious career would a few years later take him to the University of California, Berkeley—published his celebrated theorem on the undefinability of the notion of truth.

Notable members of the Warsaw School of Mathematics have included:
* Wacław Sierpiński
* Kazimierz Kuratowski
* Edward Marczewski
* Bronisław Knaster
* Zygmunt Janiszewski
* Stefan Mazurkiewicz
* Stanisław Saks
* Karol Borsuk
* Roman Sikorski
* Nachman Aronszajn
* Samuel Eilenberg

Additionally, notable logicians of the Lwów–Warsaw School of Logic, working at Warsaw, have included:
* Stanisław Leśniewski
* Adolf Lindenbaum
* Alfred Tarski
* Jan Łukasiewicz
* Andrzej Mostowski
* Helena Rasiowa

Fourier analysis has been advanced at Warsaw by:
* Aleksander Rajchman
* Antoni Zygmund
* Józef Marcinkiewicz
* Otton M. Nikodym
* Jerzy Spława-Neyman

<doc id="1028202" wikidata="Q123774" url="?curid=1028202" title="House law">
<text>House laws () are rules that govern a royal family or dynasty in matters of eligibility for succession to a throne, membership in a dynasty, exercise of a regency, or entitlement to dynastic rank, titles and styles. Prevalent in European monarchies during the nineteenth century, few countries have house laws any longer, so that they are, as a category of law, of more historical than current significance. If applied today, house laws are mostly upheld by members of royal and princely families as a matter of tradition.

Some dynasties have codified house laws, which then form a distinct section of the laws of the realm, e.g., Monaco, Japan, Liechtenstein and, formerly, most of Germany&#x27;s principalities, as well as Austria and Russia. Other monarchies had few laws regulating royal life. In still others, whatever laws existed were not gathered in any particular section of the nation&#x27;s laws. In Germany where many dynasties reigned as more or less independent sovereigns, laws governing dynastic rights constituted a distinct branch of jurisprudence called private princely law ().

The house laws of the German ruling families had a direct influence on Scandinavian kingdoms including Denmark and Sweden.

==Dynastic traditions==

In some cases, house laws are rules or traditions that are treated as if they have the force of law. In the United Kingdom an example of this might be considered the custom whereby a wife shares in her husband&#x27;s hereditary titles and rank. While this is settled common law with respect to the wives of peers and commoners, it is less clear when it comes to consorts of the king and princes. When, in 1923, Prince Albert, Duke of York became the first male member of the British royal family to marry a non-princess in more than 300 years (with the sovereign&#x27;s approval), so an announcement was apparently issued by Buckingham Palace and carried in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;It is officially announced that, in accordance with the settled general rule that a wife takes the status of her husband, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon on her marriage has become Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York, with the status of a Princess&quot;.

This issue was re-visited by the British government in 1937 and 2005, when the marriages of a former and a future king to divorcées cast into doubt what titulature was appropriate for women who were to become, essentially, the &quot;private&quot; wives of royal princes. As can be gleaned from discussions at the time, popular certainty that &quot;a woman is entitled to share her husband&#x27;s status&quot;, has by no means been seen as absolutely clear by government experts and lawyers upon examining the matter.

In the case of the marriage of Prince Charles to Camilla Parker Bowles, in 2005, the matter was settled by the decision that Camilla, whilst legally the Princess of Wales, would only use her secondary title of Duchess of Cornwall, out of respect to public sensibilities and to her predecessor, Diana, Princess of Wales.

==Extraordinary law==

Where they have existed, dynastic house laws have often been extraordinary compared to other national laws. The house laws of the families of the Austrian and German emperors were not made public until after the fall of the monarchy in 1918. Luxembourg&#x27;s grand duke has made modifications to his country&#x27;s dynastic law that remain unknown to the public at present. Russia&#x27;s house laws were applied—or not—at the tsar&#x27;s discretion. Even today, the house laws of the dynasty that has exclusive right to succeed to the throne of Liechtenstein may not be amended by either the parliament or populace of the principality, and until the late 1990s the reigning Prince could not be dethroned except according to the house law—which stipulated that ouster was only possible by a vote of his own family members.

==Royal marriages==
Nearly all house laws have regulated dynasts&#x27; right to marry. Paul I of Russia established the house law of the Romanovs (the Pauline Laws), one of the strictest in Europe. The consorts of Russian dynasts had to be &quot;equally born&quot; (i.e., belong to a royal or ruling house) and be approved by the tsar.

While some German dynasties included in their laws language requiring or urging the monarch to consent to any &quot;equal&quot; marriage, some heads of dynastic houses rejected royal matches on behalf of their family members. The French pretender denied his daughter, Princess Hélène d&#x27;Orléans, the opportunity to become Queen Consort of Britain by refusing her permission to convert to Anglicanism to marry Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence. In the late 19th or early 20th centuries the monarchs of Belgium, Russia, and Spain all withheld consent from members of their families to marry for love into foreign dynasties: Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia and Infante Alfonso de Borbon-Orléans of Spain sought to marry a pair of sisters who were also British princesses, Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh and Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh, choosing to elope and endure (temporary) banishment rather than obey their sovereigns&#x27; commands.

==Evolution of dynastic law==

European dynasties dethroned at the end of World War I continue to enforce their house laws even though they had no legal authority to do so. Some continued doing so through the 20th century (Bourbon-Sicily, Prussia, Württemberg). Governments in extant monarchies, without calling the legal mechanisms &quot;house laws&quot;, have generally strengthened their control over the marriages of members of their royal families since the second half of the 20th century. Previously a prince could often morganatically marry a woman not deemed acceptable as a royal consort, relegating her and their children to a sub-royal status. That is rarely an option anymore. In most Western European monarchies of today, a prince must renounce or membership in the royal house if his chosen spouse is not deemed suitable, e.g., Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau.

<text>Wendy is a given name generally given to girls in English-speaking countries.

In Britain during the English Civil War in the mid-1600s, a male Captain Wendy Oxford was identified by the Leveller John Lilburne as a spy reporting on his activities. It was also used as a surname in Britain from at least the 17th century. Its popularity in Britain as a feminine name is owed to the character Wendy Darling from the 1904 play &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and its 1911 novelisation &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot;, both by J. M. Barrie. Its popularity reached a peak in the 1960s, and subsequently declined. The name was inspired by young Margaret Henley, daughter of Barrie&#x27;s poet friend W. E. Henley. Margaret reportedly used to call Barrie &quot;my friendy&quot;, with the common childhood difficulty pronouncing &quot;R&quot;s this came out as &quot;my fwendy&quot; and &quot;my fwendy-wendy&quot;.

In Germany after 1986, the name Wendy became popular because it is the name of a magazine (targeted specifically at young girls) about horses and horse riding.

<text>The Kraków School of Mathematics () was a subgroup of the Polish School of Mathematics represented by mathematicians from the Kraków universities—Jagiellonian University, and the AGH University of Science and Technology–active during the interwar period (1918–1939). Their areas of study were primarily classical analysis, differential equations, and analytic functions.

The Kraków School of Differential Equations was founded by Tadeusz Ważewski, a student of Stanisław Zaremba, and was internationally appreciated after World War II. 

The Kraków School of Analytic Functions was founded by Franciszek Leja. Other notable members included Kazimierz Żorawski, Władysław Ślebodziński, Stanisław Gołąb, and Czesław Olech.

<doc id="1028216" wikidata="Q448142" url="?curid=1028216" title="Grigory Semyonov (general)">
<text>Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov, or Semenov (; September 25, 1890 – August 30, 1946), was a Japanese-supported leader of the White movement in Transbaikal and beyond from December 1917 to November 1920, a lieutenant general, and the &quot;ataman&quot; of Baikal Cossacks (1919). He was the commander of the Far Eastern Army during the Russian Civil War. He was also a prominent figure in the White Terror. U.S. Army intelligence estimated that he was responsible for executing 30,000 people in one year.

== Early life and career ==
Semyonov was born in the Transbaikal region of eastern Siberia. His father, Mikhail Petrovich Semyonov, was Russian; his mother was a Buryat. Semyonov spoke Mongolian and Buryat fluently. He joined the Imperial Russian Army in 1908 and graduated from Orenburg Military School in 1911. Commissioned first as a khorunzhiy (cornet or lieutenant), he rose to the rank of &quot;yesaul&quot; (Cossack captain), distinguished himself in battle against the Germans and the Austro-Hungarians in World War I, and earned the Saint George&#x27;s Cross for courage.

Pyotr Wrangel wrote:

Semenov was a Transbaikalian Cossack – dark and thickset, and of the rather alert Mongolian type. His intelligence was of a specifically Cossack calibre, and he was an exemplary soldier, especially courageous when under the eye of his superior. He knew how to make himself popular with Cossacks and officers alike, but he had his weaknesses in a love of intrigue and indifference to the means by which he achieved his ends. Though capable and ingenious, he had received no education, and his outlook was narrow. I have never been able to understand how he came to play a leading role.
As somewhat of an outsider among his fellow officers because of his ethnicity, he met another officer shunned by his peers, Baron Ungern-Sternberg, whose eccentric nature and disregard for the rules of etiquette and decorum repelled others. He and Ungern tried to organize a regiment of Assyrian Christians to aid in the Russian fight against the Ottomans. In July 1917, Semyonov left the Caucasus and was appointed commissar of the Provisional Government in the Baikal region and was responsible for recruiting a regiment of Buryat volunteers.

== Russian Civil War in Transbaikal ==
After the October Revolution of November 1917, Semyonov stirred up a sizable anti-Soviet rebellion but was defeated after several months of fighting, and he fled to the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin. He then moved to Manzhouli in Inner Mongolia, where the Chinese Eastern Railway met the Chita Railway, expelled the Bolshevik garrison guarding the rail junction, and recruited an army, mainly from Buryat and Chinese recruits. In January 1918, he invaded Transbaikal, but by February, had been forced by Bolshevik partisans to retreat back to Manzhouli, where he was visited by R.B.Denny, British Military Attache in Beijing, who formed an &quot;extremely favourable impression of him&quot;. On his recommendation, the Foreign Office in London agreed to pay Semyonov £10,000 a month, with no conditions attached. The French government also decided to give him financial aid, while the Japanese placed an intelligence officer, Captain Kuroki Chikayochi, in Semyonov&#x27;s headquarters. The British subsidies ended, by which time &quot;Japanese influence was so strong that Semyonov was for practical purposes a puppet.&quot;

In April 1918, Semyonov launched another raid into Siberia with the help of the Czechoslovak Legion. By August 1918 he had managed to consolidate his positions in the Transbaikal region, where he set up a provisional government. On 6 September, his men captured Chita, and slaughtered 348 of its citizens. He made Chita his capital. Semyonov declared a &quot;Great Mongol State&quot; in 1918 and had designs to unify the Oirat Mongol lands, portions of Xinjiang, Transbaikal, Inner Mongolia, Outer Mongolia, Tannu Uriankhai, Kobdo, Hulunbei&#x27;er, and Tibet into one Mongolian state. 
The region under his control, also called Eastern Okraina, extended from Verkhne-Udinsk near Lake Baikal to the Shilka River and the town of Stretensk, to Manzhouli and northeast some distance along the Amur Railway. In early 1919, Semyonov declared himself &quot;ataman &quot; of the Transbaikal Cossack Host.
In his rule over the Transbaikal, Semyonov has been described as a &quot;plain bandit [who] drew his income from holding up trains and forcing payments, no matter what the nature of the load nor for whose benefit it was being shipped&quot;. He handed out copies of the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; to the Japanese troops with whom he became associated.
With Japanese protection, he recognised no other authority. When Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak, who was based in Omsk, in Siberia, was declared Supreme Ruler by the White Armies, Semyonov refused to submit to him. They had met once, in Manzhouli, in May 1918, when Semyonov insulted Kolchak by failing to be at the railway station to greet him. Kolchak considered sending an army into Transbaikal to remove Semyonov, but had to abandon the idea because Semyonov was protected by the Japanese, who had 72,000 troops in Siberia. In October 1919, Kolchak recognised Semyonov as commander-in-chief of the Transbaikal region.

In December 1919, Semyonov sent a detachment to Irkutsk, which had been the last city west of Lake Baikal still nominally under Kolchak&#x27;s rule until a coalition of Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries seized control. The detachment reached Irkutsk, but did nothing except take 30 men and one young woman hostage. They took their hostages aboard an icebreaker on Lake Baikal, where, on 5 January, they clubbed them to death with a wooden mallet, one by one, and threw them overboard - all except for one man who put up a fight and was thrown alive into the freezing water.

When Kolchak resigned on 4 January 1920 he transferred his military forces in the Far East to Semyonov. However, Semyonov was unable to keep his troops in Siberia under control: they stole, burned, murdered, and raped, developing a reputation for being little better than thugs. In July 1920, the Japanese Expeditionary Corps started a limited withdrawal in accordance with the Gongota Agreement, which was signed on 15 July 1920 with the Far Eastern Republic and undermined support for Semyonov. Transbaikal partisans, internationalists, and the 5th Soviet Army under Genrich Eiche launched an operation to retake Chita. In October 1920, units of the Red Army and guerrillas forced Semyonov&#x27;s army out of the Baikal region. He escaped by plane to Manchuria. In late May 1921 Semyonov travelled to Japan, where he received some support. He returned to the Primorye in the hope of continuing to fight against the Soviets, but was finally forced to abandon all of Russian territory by September 1921.

== In exile ==
He eventually returned to China, where he was given a monthly 1000-yen pension by the Japanese government. In Tianjin, he made ties with the Japanese intelligence community and mobilized exiled Russian and Cossack communities that planned an eventual overthrow of the Soviets. He was also employed by Puyi, the dethroned Emperor of China, whom he wished to restore to power.

While he was an exile in China, he was still backed by the Japanese. His influence was such that when Anastasy Vonsiatsky of the Russian Fascist Party wanted to visit Manchukuo, the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, he needed Semyonov&#x27;s help in getting a visa. Vonsiatsky, however, saw Semyonov as a threat to his dream of being Russia&#x27;s Mussolini, and declared that he should be shot, an outburst that led to the Russian Fascist Party splitting in two. Konstantin Rodzaevsky, who supplanted Vonsiatsky as the leader of the Russian Fascists in China co-operated with Semyonov to placate the Japanese.

In 1934, the Japanese formed the Bureau for Russian Emigrants in Manchuria (BREM; Бюро по делам российских эмигрантов в Маньчжурской империи), which were nominally under the control of the recent Russian Fascist Party and provided identification papers necessary to live, work and travel in Manchukuo. Much more in favor with the Japanese than White General Kislitsin, Semyonov replaced him as BREM&#x27;s chairman from 1943 to 1945.

== Arrest and execution ==

Semyonov was captured in Dalian by Soviet paratroopers in September 1945 during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in which the Red Army conquered Manchukuo. He was taken to Moscow, and put on trial with seven others, including Rodzaevsky in front of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. He pleaded guilty to espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and armed struggle, and was sentenced to death by hanging. Semyonov was executed on August 29, 1946.

<text>John Garcia (born September 4, 1970) is an American singer and songwriter. He is best known as the vocalist and founding member of stoner rock bands Kyuss, Slo Burn, Unida and Hermano. Garcia also performed in Vista Chino, formerly Kyuss Lives!, with former Kyuss members Brant Bjork and Nick Oliveri. Garcia has since decided to pursue his solo career, having formed his band, John Garcia and the Band of Gold, in 2019.

==Musical career==

===Kyuss===

In 1989, while still in high school, Garcia formed Kyuss (originally known as &quot;Katzenjammer&quot; and &quot;Sons of Kyuss&quot;) with Brant Bjork, Chris Cockrell, Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri. Through changing lineups, the band produced five albums in total, all of which featured Garcia on vocals. In October 1995, just three months after releasing the album &quot;...And the Circus Leaves Town&quot;, Kyuss disbanded. Their final official release was a 10&quot; vinyl on the now defunct label Man&#x27;s Ruin Records, which was later re-released on a split CD with Homme&#x27;s post-Kyuss project Queens of the Stone Age. Kyuss had been on an indefinite hiatus ever since. In November 2010, along with former members Oliveri and Bjork, it was announced he would be touring as Kyuss Lives!, and toured Europe, Australia and New Zealand from March to May 2011 with a new studio album expected to follow. Bruno Fevery filled in for Homme, who did not want to participate. In November 2012, following a lawsuit filed by Homme and former Kyuss bassist Scott Reeder, Kyuss Lives! changed their name to Vista Chino.

===Slo Burn===

In 1996, Garcia formed stoner rock band Slo Burn in Palm Desert, California. Releasing just one EP, &quot;Amusing the Amazing&quot;, the band&#x27;s tenure was short-lived, though it was embraced by the former Kyuss fanbase. A total of 9 songs were recorded, but the band did not have enough funds, so the 4 tracks were released as an EP. Bootleg copies of the album that have the remaining 5 tracks exist, unmixed, in varying quality. The band played at Ozzfest in 1997 before disbanding later that year, for reasons never officially revealed. Slo Burn reunited twenty years later in 2017 and went on tour before going on hiatus the same year.

===Unida===
Upon leaving Slo Burn, Garcia formed the band Unida, which at one point included former Kyuss bassist Scott Reeder. Unida released one album, &quot;Coping with the Urban Coyote&quot; and a split EP with the Swedish group Dozer. Unida were signed to Rick Rubin&#x27;s label, American Recordings, and recorded a second album, &quot;El Coyote&quot; (alternatively known as &quot;The Great Divide&quot;) which was unreleased due to company partner, Island/Def Jam, not seeing any commercial potential in the music. The band, however, distributed the album themselves, selling copies at their live shows while on tour. Unida is currently touring without Garcia due to touring with his solo band.

===Hermano===

In 1998, Garcia joined Hermano, a side-project created by producer Dandy Brown. Since 2002, the band has released three studio albums: &quot;Only a Suggestion&quot;, &quot;Dare I Say&quot;, and &quot;Into the Exam Room&quot;, and one live album, &quot;Live at W2&quot;. Hermano currently remains on hiatus due to Garcia&#x27;s commitment to his solo band.

===Vista Chino===

In early 2010, a European tour was announced, starting with a gig at Roadburn Festival in April. Billed as &quot;Garcia Plays Kyuss&quot;, the performances consisted entirely of songs originally recorded by Garcia&#x27;s former band, Kyuss. His backing-band is composed of Belgian and Dutch musicians from Agua de Annique, Kong, Celestial Season and Arsenal. During their performance at Hellfest on June 20, John Garcia was joined on stage by former Kyuss members Brant Bjork and Nick Oliveri while playing &quot;Gardenia&quot; and &quot;Green Machine&quot;.

In November 2010, John Garcia formed Kyuss Lives! with Brant Bjork, Nick Oliveri, and Bruno Fevery. Due to legal pressure in November 2012, Kyuss Lives! announced that they had changed their name to Vista Chino.

Vista Chino released their debut album &quot;Peace&quot; on September 3, 2013, through Napalm Records.

===Various projects and collaborations===

In the mid-1990s, Garcia was chosen to be the lead vocalist for Karma to Burn&#x27;s debut album, however the band ultimately settled on a different singer. One of the songs recorded during their studio sessions together, &quot;Two Times&quot;, appeared on the band&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Appalachian Incantation&quot; as a bonus track.

In 1999, Garcia collaborated with Swedish all-female stoner band Misdemeanor on &quot;Love Song&quot;, the fourth track of their EP, &quot;Five Wheel Drive&quot;.

In 2001, he contributed vocals to the track &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot; along with drummer Jason Bonham, bassist Jeff Pilson (Dokken,) and guitarist Kurdt Vanderhoof for the Metallica tribute album Metallic Assault.

In 2002, Garcia contributed vocals to two tracks on UK band Orange Goblin&#x27;s album &quot;Coup de Grace&quot;, &quot;Made of Rats&quot; and &quot;Jesus Beater&quot;.

In late 2003, Garcia recorded vocals for the song &quot;Born Too Slow&quot; by The Crystal Method. The song became the lead single of &quot;Legion of Boom&quot;. The song did moderately well in terms of radio airplay and is highly popular among fans of The Crystal Method, particularly because of the howling vocals Garcia laid down on the track. Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland played guitar on the song. Garcia has performed the song live several times with The Crystal Method.

On December 20, 2005, Garcia would finally team up with Homme again, making a guest appearance onstage with Queens of the Stone Age during the encore of their set at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles. They performed three Kyuss songs together: &quot;Thumb&quot;, &quot;Hurricane&quot; and &quot;Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop&quot;. This appearance fueled Kyuss reunion rumours, though Homme has stated publicly that a proper Kyuss reunion is unlikely to ever happen.

In 2006, Garcia collaborated with Canadian band Danko Jones on their third album, &quot;Sleep Is the Enemy&quot;, contributing vocals to the track &quot;Invisible&quot;. He would again collaborate with Danko Jones on their 2008 album &quot;Never Too Loud&quot;, appearing on the track &quot;Forest for the Trees&quot; along with Pete Stahl.

Garcia has worked on a solo project under the moniker &quot;Garcia Vs Garcia&quot;, which was originally slated for a September 2008 release but has since been delayed indefinitely. 

In 2008, John Garcia collaborated with Belgian band Arsenal on their album &quot;Lotuk&quot;, contributing lyrics and vocals to two tracks, &quot;Not a Man&quot; and &quot;Diggin&#x27; a Hole&quot;. The band members of Arsenal also shot a film documenting the making of the album, including footage of Garcia driving around in his hometown.

In 2012, Garcia appeared on the Mondo Generator album, Hell Comes to Your Heart, providing backing vocals on two of its tracks, &quot;Won&#x27;t Let Go&quot; and &quot;The Last Train&quot;.

On July 25, 2014, he released his debut solo album, &quot;John Garcia&quot;.

In 2017, Garcia released his second solo album, &quot;The Coyote Who Spoke in Tongues&quot;.

In early 2019, he released his third solo album under the name &quot;John Garcia and the Band of Gold&quot;. Garcia has since toured under the moniker alongside the lineup of guitarist Ehren Groban, bassist Mike Pygmie, and drummer Greg Saenz.

Dutronc played guitar in the rock group El Toro et les Cyclones. He wrote successful songs for singer Françoise Hardy in the 1960s before moving on to pursue a successful solo career. His music incorporated traditional French pop and French rock as well as styles such as psychedelic and garage rock. He was also very important in the &quot;yéyé&quot; music movement and has been a longtime songwriting collaborator with Jacques Lanzmann. According to AllMusic, Dutronc is &quot;one of the most popular performers in the French-speaking world&quot;, although he &quot;remains little known in English speaking territories&quot; aside from a cult following in the UK.

Dutronc later branched out into film acting, starting in 1973. He earned a César Award for Best Actor for the leading role in &quot;Van Gogh&quot; (1991), which was directed by Maurice Pialat. He married Hardy in 1981 and together they have a son, guitarist Thomas Dutronc (born 1973); the couple separated in 1988, but never divorced.

==Early life==
Jacques Dutronc was born on 28 April 1943 at 67 Rue de Provence in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, the home of his parents, Pierre and Madeleine. His father was a manager for the state-run Office of Coal Distribution. Jacques was educated at Rocroy-Saint-Léon elementary school (now a lycée), the (now a drama school) and then at the École Professionnelle de Dessin Industriel, where he studied graphic design from 1959.

==Career ==
===1960s===

In 1960, Dutronc formed a band with himself as guitarist, schoolfriend Hadi Kalafate as bassist, Charlot Bénaroch as drummer (later replaced with André Crudot) and Daniel Dray as singer. They auditioned in 1961 for Jacques Wolfsohn, an artistic director at Disques Vogue, who signed them and gave them the name El Toro et les Cyclones. The group released two singles, &quot;L&#x27;Oncle John&quot; and &quot;Le Vagabond&quot;, but disbanded when Dutronc was obliged to undertake military service.

After being discharged from the army in 1963, Dutronc briefly played guitar in Eddy Mitchell&#x27;s backing band and was also given a job at Vogue as Jacques Wolfsohn&#x27;s assistant. In this capacity, he co-wrote songs for artists such as ZouZou, Cléo and Françoise Hardy.

Wolfsohn asked Dutronc to work with Jacques Lanzmann, a novelist and editor of &quot;Lui&quot; magazine, to create songs for a beatnik singer called Benjamin. Benjamin released an EP in 1966, featuring songs written with Dutronc and a Lanzmann–Dutronc composition, &quot;Cheveux longs&quot; (Long Hair). However, Wolfsohn was disappointed by Benjamin&#x27;s recording of a song titled &quot;Et moi, et moi, et moi&quot;. A second version was recorded, with Dutronc&#x27;s former bandmate Hadi Kalafate on vocals. Wolfsohn then asked Dutronc if he would be interested in recording his own version. The single reached number 2 in the French charts in September 1966.

Cultural historian Larry Portis describes the arrival of Dutronc on the French music scene, along with that of Michel Polnareff at around the same time, as representing &quot;the first French rock music that can be considered a musically competent and non-imitative incorporation of African-American and African-American-British influences&quot;. For Portis, Dutronc marks a break with the literary tradition of French &quot;chanson&quot; in his creative use of the sounds, rather than just the syntax, of the language.

Dutronc&#x27;s self-titled debut album, released at the end of 1966, sold over a million copies and was awarded a special Grand Prix du Disque by the Académie Charles Cros, in memoriam of one of its founders. A second single, &quot;Les play boys&quot;, spent six weeks at number one and sold 600,000 copies.

Dutronc was one of the most commercially successful French music stars of the late 1960s and early 1970s. During that period, he released seven hit albums and more than 20 singles, including two further number ones: &quot;J&#x27;aime les filles&quot; in 1967 and &quot;Il est cinq heures, Paris s&#x27;éveille&quot; in 1968.

According to music critic Mark Deming: &quot;Dutronc&#x27;s early hits were rough but clever exercises in European garage rock ... like Dutronc&#x27;s role models Bob Dylan and Ray Davies, he could write melodies strong enough to work even without their excellent lyrics, and his band had more than enough energy to make them fly (and the imagination to move with the musical times as psychedelia and hard rock entered the picture at the end of the decade)&quot;.

===1970s===

Most of Dutronc&#x27;s songs up to 1975 were written with Jacques Lanzmann, with only two written solely by Dutronc. Lanzmann&#x27;s wife Anne Ségalen is also credited on some songs. Dutronc wrote three songs with comic-book writer Fred, whose stories he also narrated for commercial release in 1970. Two songs were written in 1971 by Lanzmann, Franck Harvel and the composer Jean-Pierre Bourtayre, for a TV adaptation of &quot;Arsène Lupin&quot;. Co-writing credits on Dutronc&#x27;s self-titled 1975 album are split between Lanzmann, Serge Gainsbourg and Jean-Loup Dabadie.

In 1973, was adapted with English lyrics as &quot;Alright Alright Alright&quot; and became a UK No. 3 hit for the group Mungo Jerry.

Also in 1973, Dutronc began a second career as an actor in the film , directed by Jean-Marie Périer. Dutronc&#x27;s second film, &quot;That Most Important Thing: Love&quot;, directed by Andrzej Zulawski, was a major box-office hit in France. In the following years, Dutronc devoted most of his energies toward his acting career, appearing in films directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Lelouch and Maurice Pialat. In 1977, he was nominated for the César Award for best supporting actor, for his role in Claude Sautet&#x27;s &quot;Mado&quot;. Steven Spielberg reportedly considered Dutronc to be the best French actor of his generation, and had the role of René Belloq in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; written with him in mind. Dutronc was not given the role, however, because it transpired that his English was not adequate.

===1980s===
In 1980, Dutronc began work on a new album under the direction of Jacques Wolfsohn, now an executive at . Wolfsohn proposed that Dutronc write with both Jacques Lanzmann and Serge Gainsbourg. During recording, Wolfsohn proposed to Lanzmann and Gainsbourg that they each work on alternative lyrics to go with one of Dutronc&#x27;s instrumental demos. Lanzmann objected to being placed in competition against another writer, and dropped out of the project. The resulting album, &quot;Guerre et pets&quot; (&quot;War and Farts&quot; – a play on the title of Tolstoy&#x27;s novel), consequently only includes two Lanzmann-Dutronc compositions, and is mainly written by Dutronc and Gainsbourg. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;L&#x27;hymne à l&#x27;amour&quot;, received little airplay because its lyric consists primarily of racial epithets (the opening line, roughly translated, is &quot;gook, wog, towel-head, yid&quot;), and the album was only a moderate commercial success. The follow-up, 1982&#x27;s &quot;C&#x27;est pas du bronze&quot;, was written with Anne Ségalen, by now divorced from Jacques Lanzmann, and was released to a frosty critical reception.

Dutronc&#x27;s acting career continued during the 1980s, and he appeared in films such as &quot;Malevil&quot; and Barbet Schroeder&#x27;s &quot;Cheaters (Tricheurs)&quot;. In 1987, he released a further album, &quot;C.Q.F.Dutronc&quot;. Most of the songs were written by Dutronc without a partner, although he collaborated with Etienne Daho on one track and with Jean-François Bernardini of the Corsican folk group I Muvrini on another.

===1990s===
In 1992, Dutronc was awarded the César for Best Actor for the title role in Maurice Pialat&#x27;s biographical film &quot;Van Gogh&quot;. Critic Christopher Null commented that Dutronc &quot;manages to embody the obvious manic depression from Van Gogh&#x27;s later years, all exuding from his scraggly face, sunken eyes, and bony frame... the searing Dutronc is the real reason to sit through the film&quot;.

In November 1992, Dutronc played three comeback concerts at the Casino de Paris, highlights from which were released as a film, directed by Jean-Marie Périer and as a live album, &quot;Dutronc au Casino&quot;. At around this time, Dutronc began work on a new studio album, &quot;Brèves rencontres&quot;, but work progressed slowly and it was not released until 1995.

During the 1990s, Dutronc appeared in two films by Patrick Grandperret and was nominated for a César Award for best supporting actor in 1999, for his role in Nicole Garcia&#x27;s &quot;Place Vendôme.

===21st century===

Dutronc starred in Claude Chabrol&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Merci pour le chocolat&quot;. He was awarded the Best Actor prize at the 2001 Marrakech International Film Festival and was nominated for the César Award for best actor for his role in Jean-Pierre Améris&#x27; &quot;C&#x27;est la vie&quot;. In 2002, he starred in Michel Blanc&#x27;s &quot;Summer Things&quot;.

In 2003, Dutronc reunited with Jacques Lanzmann for &quot;Madame l&#x27;existence&quot;, an album described by rock critic Christophe Conte as &quot;surpassing, without much apparent effort, everything that [Dutronc] has created in the last two decades&quot;.

In 2005, Dutronc was awarded an Honorary César. Since then, he has appeared in films by directors including Gabriel Aghion and Alain Corneau.

In 2010, Dutronc toured for the first time in 17 years, and released recordings from the tour as a live album and DVD, &quot;Et vous, et vous, et vous&quot;.

Dutronc&#x27;s 41st film, &quot;Les Francis&quot;, was released in 2014.

In November 2014, Dutronc performed a series of concerts with Eddy Mitchell and Johnny Hallyday at Paris Bercy, under the name &quot;Les vieilles canailles&quot; (&quot;The Old Gits&quot;). It was reported that, following these performances, Dutronc intended to begin recording a new album with his son Thomas.
Said album, &quot;Dutronc and Dutronc&quot;, was released 4 November 2022 and features 13 songs originally released by Jacques Dutronc during his early career. Father and son rearranged the songs and both sing on the album.

==Reputation and influence==
According to a 1979 editorial in the French magazine &quot;Rock &amp; Folk&quot;, Dutronc is &quot;the one singer who is so closely identified with the 1960s that it has become impossible to talk about them without talking about him&quot;. In 1991, &quot;Il est cinq heures, Paris s&#x27;éveille&quot; was voted the best French-language single of all time in a poll of music critics organised by &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot; for a TV special broadcast on Antenne 2, beating Jacques Brel&#x27;s &quot;Ne me quitte pas&quot; into second place.

Dutronc&#x27;s songs have been covered by Matthieu Chedid, Vanessa Paradis, Mungo Jerry, Etienne Daho, Sylvie Vartan, Miles Kane, the Divine Comedy, Serge Gainsbourg, Black Lips, Zine, the Last Shadow Puppets among others. Dutronc is also mentioned in the lyrics of Jacques Brel&#x27;s &quot;Vesoul&quot; as well as the Cornershop song &quot;Brimful of Asha&quot;.

In 2015, a tribute album was released by Columbia Records with various artists interpreting songs by Jacques Dutronc. The 13-track album titled &quot;Joyeux anniversaire M&#x27;sieur Dutronc&quot; contained performances by artists Julien Doré, Gaëtan Roussel, Zaz, Joeystarr, Nathy (Tüxo), BAGARRE, Thomas Dutronc, Annie Cordy, the duo Brigitte, Miossec, Francis Cabrel, Francine Massiani, Tété and Camélia Jordana in addition to &quot;L&#x27;opportuniste&quot; sung by Jacques Dutronc with Nicola Sirkis. The album charted in France and Belgium.

==Personal life==
Dutronc began a relationship with Vogue label-mate Françoise Hardy in 1967. In 1973, they had a son, Thomas, who grew up to become a successful jazz and pop musician. In 1981, they were married, &quot;for tax reasons&quot;, according to Hardy. In 1998, Jacques began a relationship with a stylist whom he had met on the set of the film &quot;Place Vendôme&quot;. Dutronc and Hardy separated in 1988, but remained married and were reported to have seen each other regularly. Hardy died in 2024.

He currently lives near the town of Monticello, Corsica.

In 2015, Dutronc revealed he had a brief relationship with Romy Schneider that lasted as long as they were shooting the film &quot;That Most Important Thing: Love&quot;.

<text>Harry Heine R.S.M.A. (July 24, 1928 – September 25, 2004) was an artist who specialized in maritime scenes.

==Life and work==
Heine was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. He lived in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada until his death in 2004.

His career as an artist spanned forty years. He was a member of the Royal Society of Marine Artists, to which he was elected the only Canadian member in 1980. He was a Vice President of the Canadian Society of Marine Artists and of the Federation of Canadian Artists. He was made an Honorary Citizen of the City of Victoria in 1985 and an Honorary Alberta Artist in 1983 in recognition of his contribution to the Visual Arts. He was also a member of the Northwest Watercolour Society.

His work is in many public collections including the Legislative Buildings of the Government of British Columbia; Washington State Arts Commission Collection; Captain Cook Birthplace Museum, England; Mystic Seaport Museum, United States; The Provincial Maritime Museum, B.C.; Government House Collection, B.C.; The Mendel Art Gallery, Saskatchewan; Edmonton Art Gallery and the Alberta Art Foundation.

He painted murals for Expo &#x27;86 in Vancouver, Syncrude Canada, the Royal Canadian Legion in Edmonton and the towns of Vegreville, Fort Saskatchewan, Chemainus and Chetwynd. Painting commissions include the Canada I Society (America’s Cup), Telecom Canada, H.M.C.S. Malahat, the Government of B.C. and Beautiful &quot;British Columbia Magazine&quot;. Other works range from carved murals and ship models to posters and book illustrations. He was made a Life Member of the Sail &amp; Life Training Society and the Vintage Vessel Registry.

Heine shared his techniques through demonstrations, workshops and classes throughout Western Canada and overseas as guest lecturer for P&amp;O Lines’ Swan Hellenic Cruises. From 1986 to 2004 he conducted private painting tours to varied locales in Europe, Asia and North America. His co-host on many of those trips was teacher and watercolourist, his elder daughter Caren Heine. His son Mark is an illustrator and fine artist and his youngest daughter Jennifer is an artist and graphic designer. All three children have been involved in gallery exhibitions with their father, including major retrospectives held at Winchester Galleries in June 2005 and 2007. A further Canadian Legacy exhibition added a third generation, as it included photography by Sarah Heine, Mark&#x27;s younger daughter. It was held in May 2017 at the MacMillan Arts Centre in Parksville, BC.

<doc id="1028225" wikidata="Q318060" url="?curid=1028225" title="Henri Salvador">
<text>Henri Salvador (18 July 1917 – 13 February 2008) was a French Caribbean singer, comedian and cabaret artist.

==Biography==

Salvador was born in Cayenne, French Guiana. His father, Clovis, and his mother, Antonine Paterne, daughter of an Indigenous Carib, were both from Guadeloupe, French West Indies. Salvador had a brother, André, and a sister, Alice.

He began his musical career as a guitarist accompanying other singers. He had learned the guitar by imitating Django Reinhardt&#x27;s recordings, and was to work alongside him in the 1940s. Salvador recorded several songs written by Boris Vian with Quincy Jones as arranger. He played many years with Ray Ventura and His Collegians where he used to sing, dance and even play comedy on stage.

He also appeared in movies including &quot;Nous irons à Monte-Carlo&quot; (1950), &quot;Nous irons à Paris&quot; (Jean Boyer&#x27;s film of 1949 with the Peters Sisters) and &quot;Mademoiselle s&#x27;amuse&quot; (1948).

He is known to have recorded the first French rock and roll songs in 1957 written by Boris Vian and Michel Legrand — &quot;Rock&#x27;n Roll Mops&quot;, &quot;Rock hoquet, Va t&#x27;faire cuire un oeuf, man&quot; and &quot;Dis-moi qu&#x27;tu m&#x27;aimes rock&quot; — under the artist name of Henry Cording (a play on the word &quot;Recording&quot;). Despite this historical aspect, he never ceased to claim that he disliked rock and roll and even refused to talk about this subject later on.

In the 1960s, Salvador was the host of several popular television variety shows on French TV. In 1964, he scored a hit with &quot;Zorro est arrivé&quot;, which was adapted from The Coasters&#x27; U.S. hit &quot;Along Came Jones&quot;. He is also famous for his rich, catchy laugh, which is a theme in many of his humorous songs. In 1969, Henri Salvador recorded a variation of &quot;Mah Nà Mah Nà&quot; entitled &quot;Mais non, mais non&quot; (&quot;But No, But No&quot; or &quot;Of Course Not, Of Course Not&quot;), with lyrics he had written in French to Piero Umiliani&#x27;s music.

Henri Salvador and his song &quot;Dans mon île&quot; (1957) were thought to be an influence on Antônio Carlos Jobim in formulating the Brazilian bossa nova style.

Famous Brazilian composer and singer Caetano Veloso made Henri Salvador famous to Brazilian audiences with the song &quot;Reconvexo&quot;, in which he says &quot;quem não sentiu o swing de Henri Salvador?&quot; (&quot;who hasn&#x27;t felt the swing of Henri Salvador?&quot;). Veloso also recorded a version of Salvador&#x27;s song &quot;Dans mon île&quot;.

At the age of 70, Salvador was the voice-over of the crab Sebastian in the 1989 French dubbing of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Recordings of &quot;Embrasse-la&quot; (&quot;Kiss the Girl&quot;) can be found on YouTube.

Salvador discovered singers Keren Ann and Art Mengo.

He died of a ruptured aneurysm at his home in the early hours of 13 February 2008. He was 90 years of age. He was buried next to his wife Jacqueline in Père-Lachaise Cemetery.

He was known as a supporter of Paris Saint-Germain F.C. He obtained four seats for life in the Parc des Princes.

==Legacy==

Henri Salvador continues to be popular today. In 2000, Virgin Records released a CD featuring popular hits such as &quot;Jazz Mediterrannée&quot;, which continues to receive regular air play. In 2002, his album &quot;Chambre avec vue&quot; sold over two million copies. In 2005, Salvador was awarded the Brazilian Order of Cultural Merit, which he received from the acclaimed singer and Minister of Culture, Gilberto Gil, in the presence of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for his influence on Brazilian culture, particularly on bossa nova, to whose invention he contributed. That same year he took 52nd place in the election of Le Plus Grand Français (The Greatest Frenchman).

Salvador became a commander of the French Légion d&#x27;honneur and of the French National Order of Merit. In 2007, he released &quot;Révérence&quot; on V2 Records, featuring Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. He then went on to perform the track &quot;La vie c&#x27;est la vie&quot; from that album on an episode of the BBC programme &quot;Later… with Jools Holland&quot; aired on 4 May 2007.

<doc id="1028226" wikidata="Q5509185" url="?curid=1028226" title="Fungus the Bogeyman">
<text>Fungus the Bogeyman is a 1977 children&#x27;s picture book by British artist Raymond Briggs. It follows one day in the life of the title character, a working class Bogeyman with the mundane job of scaring human beings. The character and all related properties are now owned by Studiocanal.

==Plot==
The book follows a typical day for Fungus the Bogeyman, starting when he wakes up and ending just before he falls asleep. As his day progresses, he undergoes a mild existential crisis, pondering what his seemingly pointless job of scaring surface people is really for. He is a member of the Bogey society, which is very similar to British society, but Bogeymen enjoy things which humans (called &quot;Drycleaners&quot; because of their contrasting environmental preferences) would not be comfortable around; for example darkness, damp, cold and over-ripe food. The book depicts the mundane details of Bogey life in loving detail, with definitions of Bogey slang and numerous annotations concerning the myths, pets, hobbies, literature, clothing and food of the Bogeys.

Much of the humour derives from word play. For example, Bogeymen are shown to enjoy eating and sharing flies in a similar way to human cigarettes; one brand of fly is the &quot;strong French Gallwasp&quot;, a pun on the cigarette &quot;Gauloises&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Over a period of decades, a number of attempts were made to make a film from the book, which was difficult given its lack of an actual plot. In 2002 the BBC began work on a three-part TV comedy series, which ultimately aired in November 2004 and is available as a DVD, starring Clare Thomas as Jessica White, Martin Clunes as her father and Mak Wilson as Fungus. This Gala Films production with screenplay by author Mark Haddon, featuring live-action humans and animated Bogeys, was nominated for five awards. It tells of how Jessica, a human teenager, finds her way into Bogeydom and meets Fungus and his family. The family has an addition, a daughter named Mucus, and Fungus&#x27; son Mould (who featured in the original book) is a teenager going through a rebellious phase: cleaning things instead of dirtying them.

A three-part adaptation, featuring Timothy Spall as the title character, aired on Sky1 in December 2015 and was partly shot at West London Film Studios. This adaption also starred Marc Warren, Keeley Hawes, Joanna Scanlan, Jimmy Akingbola, Paul Kaye, and also Victoria Wood in her final television role before her death in April 2016. It was produced by Andy Serkis&#x27;s motion-capture studio, The Imaginarium, with Serkis also as the narrator.

A stage production, based on the book, was performed at artsdepot in North London between November 2007 and August 2008. A co-production with Pilot Theatre, the show was directed and adapted by Marcus Romer and designed by Ali Allen.

The book also inspired the song &quot;Bogey Music&quot; by Paul McCartney, which was released on &quot;McCartney II&quot;. The liner notes state this inspiration, and also claims the song &quot;is the first record made by &#x27;dry cleaners&#x27; for the expanding Bogey market.&quot;

<text>The Swing Riots were a widespread uprising in 1830 by agricultural workers in southern and eastern England in protest of agricultural mechanisation and harsh working conditions. The riots began with the destruction of threshing machines in the Elham Valley area of East Kent in the summer of 1830 and by early December had spread through the whole of southern England and East Anglia. It was to be the largest movement of social unrest in 19th-century England.

As well as attacking the popularly-hated threshing machines, which displaced workers, the protesters rioted over low wages and required tithes by destroying workhouses and tithe barns associated with their oppression. They also burned ricks and maimed cows.

The rioters directed their anger at the three targets identified as causing their misery: the tithe system, requiring payments to support the established Anglican Church; the Poor Law guardians, who were thought to abuse their power over the poor; and the rich tenant farmers, who had been progressively lowering workers&#x27; wages and introduced agricultural machinery. If captured, the protesters faced charges of arson, robbery, riot, machine-breaking and assault. Those convicted faced imprisonment, transportation and possibly execution.

The Swing Riots had many immediate causes. The historian J. F. C. Harrison believed that they were overwhelmingly the result of the progressive impoverishment and dispossession of the English agricultural workforce over the previous fifty years leading up to 1830. In Parliament, Lord Carnarvon had said that the English labourers were reduced to a plight more abject than that of any race in Europe, with their employers no longer able to feed and employ them. A 2020 study found that the presence of threshing machines caused greater rioting and that the severity of the riots was lowest in areas with abundant employment alternatives and the highest in areas with few alternative employment opportunities.

== Name and etymology ==
The name &quot;Swing Riots&quot; was derived from Captain Swing, the name attributed to the fictitious, mythical figurehead of the movement. The name was often used to sign threatening letters sent to farmers, magistrates, parsons and others. These were first mentioned by &quot;The Times&quot; on 21 October 1830.

&#x27;Swing&#x27; was apparently a reference to the swinging stick of the flail used in hand threshing.

==Background==

=== Enclosure ===
Early 19th-century England was almost unique among major nations in having no class of landed smallholding peasantry. The inclosure acts of rural England contributed to the plight of rural farmworkers. Between 1770 and 1830, about of common land were enclosed. The common land had been used for centuries by the poor of the countryside to graze their animals and grow their own produce. The land was now divided up among the large local landowners, leaving the landless farmworkers solely dependent upon working for their richer neighbours for a cash wage. That may have offered a tolerable living during the boom years of the Napoleonic Era, when labour had been in short supply and corn prices high, the return of peace in 1815 resulted in plummeting grain prices and an oversupply of labour. According to the social historians John and Barbara Hammond, enclosure was fatal to three classes: the small farmer, the cottager and the squatter. Before enclosure, the cottager was a labourer with land; after enclosure, he was a labourer without land.

In contrast to the Hammonds&#x27; 1911 analysis of the events, the historian G. E. Mingay noted that when the Swing Riots broke out in 1830, the heavily-enclosed Midlands remained almost entirely quiet, but the riots were concentrated in the southern and south-eastern counties, which were little affected by enclosure. Some historians have posited that the reason was that in the West Midlands, for example, the rapid expansion of the Potteries and the coal and iron industries provided an alternative range of employment to agricultural workers.

Critically, J. D. Chambers and G. E. Mingay suggested that the Hammonds exaggerated the costs of change, but enclosure really meant more food for the growing population; more land under cultivation and, on the balance, more employment in the countryside. The modern historians of the riots, Eric Hobsbawm and George Rudé, cited only three of a total of 1,475 incidents as being directly caused by enclosure. Since the late 20th century, those contentions have been challenged by a new class of recent historians. Enclosure has been seen by some as causing the destruction of the traditional peasant way of life, however miserable:

Landless peasants could no longer maintain an economic independence and so had to become labourers. Surplus peasant labour moved into the towns to become industrial workers.

=== Precarious employment ===
In the 1780s, workers would be employed at annual hiring fairs, or ‘mops’, to serve for the whole year. During that period, the worker would receive payment in kind and in cash from his employer, would often work at his side, and would commonly share meals at the employer&#x27;s table. As time passed, the gulf between farmer and employee widened. Workers were hired on stricter cash-only contracts, which ran for increasingly shorter periods. First, monthly terms became the norm. Later, contracts were offered for as little as a week. Between 1750 and 1850, farm labourers faced the loss of their land, the transformation of their contracts and the sharp deterioration of their economic situations. By the time of the 1830 riots, they had retained very little of their former status except the right to parish relief, under the Old Poor Law system.

Additionally, there was an influx of Irish farm labourers in 1829, who had come to seek agricultural work which contributed to reduced employment opportunities for other farming communities. Irish labourers would find themselves being threatened from the beginning of the riots the following year.

=== Poor Laws ===
Historically, the monasteries had taken responsibility for the impotent poor, but after their dissolution in 1536 to 1539, responsibility passed to the parishes. the Act of Settlement in 1662 had confined relief strictly to those who were natives of the parish. The poor law system charged a Parish Rate to landowners and tenants, which was used to provide relief payments to settled residents of the parish who were ill or out of work. The payments were minimal, and at times, degrading conditions were required for their receipt. As more and more people became dependent on parish relief, ratepayers rebelled ever more loudly against the costs, and lower and lower levels of relief were offered. Three &quot;one-gallon&quot; bread loaves a week were considered necessary for a man in Berkshire in 1795. However provision had fallen to just two similarly-sized loaves being provided in 1817 Wiltshire. The way in which poor law funds were disbursed led to a further reduction in agricultural wages since farmers would pay their workers as little as possible in the knowledge that the parish fund would top up wages to a basic subsistence level (see Speenhamland system).

=== Tithe System ===
To that mixture was added the burden of the church tithe. This was the church&#x27;s right to a tenth of the parish harvest. The tithe-owner could voluntarily reduce the financial burden on the parish either by allowing the parish to keep more of their share of the harvest. Or the tithe-owner could, again voluntarily, commute the tithe payments to a rental charge. The rioters had demanded that tithes should be reduced, but this demand was refused by many of the tithe-owners.

=== Industrialisation ===
The final straw was the introduction of horse-powered threshing machines, which could do the work of many men. They spread swiftly among the farming community and threatened the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of farmworkers. Following the terrible harvests of 1828 and 1829, farm labourers faced the approaching winter of 1830 with dread.

==Riots==

Starting in the south-eastern county of Kent, the Swing Rioters smashed the threshing machines and threatened farmers who owned them. The first threshing machine to be destroyed was during Saturday night, 28 August 1830 at Lower Hardres. By the third week of October, more than 100 threshing machines had been destroyed in East Kent. The riots spread rapidly and systematically - following pre-existing road networks - through the southern counties of Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex and Hampshire before they spread north into the Home Counties, the Midlands and East Anglia. Originally, the disturbances were thought to be mainly a southern and East Anglian phenomenon, but subsequent research has revealed just how widespread Swing riots really were, with almost every county south of the Scottish border involved.

In all, sixty percent of the disturbances were concentrated in the south (Berkshire 165 incidents, Hampshire 208, Kent 154, Sussex 145, Wiltshire 208); East Anglia had fewer incidents (Cambridge 17, Norfolk 88, Suffolk 40); and the Southwest, the Midlands and the North were only marginally affected.

=== Tactics ===
The tactics varied from county to county, but typically, threatening letters, often signed by Captain Swing, would be sent to magistrates, parsons, wealthy farmers or Poor Law guardians in the area. The letters would call for a rise in wages, a cut in the tithe payments and the destruction of threshing machines, or people would take matters into their own hands. If the warnings were not heeded local farm workers would gather, often in groups of 200 to 400, and would threaten the local oligarchs with dire consequences if their demands were not met. Threshing machines would be broken, workhouses and tithe barns would be attacked and the rioters would then disperse or move on to the next village. The buildings containing the engines that powered the threshing machines were also a target of the rioters and many gin gangs, also known as horse engine houses or wheelhouses, were destroyed, particularly in south−eastern England. There are also recorded instances of carriages being held up and their occupants robbed.

Other actions included incendiary attacks on farms, barns and hayricks in the dead of night, when it was easier to avoid detection. Although many of the actions of the rioters, such as arson, were conducted in secret at night, meetings with farmers and overseers about the grievances were conducted in daylight.

Despite the prevalence of the slogan &quot;Bread or Blood&quot;, only one person is recorded as having been killed during the riots, which was one of the rioters by the action of a soldier or farmer. The rioters&#x27; only intent was to damage property.
Similar patterns of disturbances and their rapid spread across the country were often blamed on agitators or on &quot;agents&quot; sent from France, where the revolution of July 1830 had broken out a month before the Swing Riots had begun in Kent.

Despite all of the different tactics used by the agricultural workers during the unrest, their principal aims were simply to attain a minimum living wage and to end rural unemployment.

A 2021 study that examined how information and diffusion shaped the riots found &quot;that information about the riots traveled through personal and trade networks but not through transport or mass media networks. This information was not about repression, and local organizers played an important role in the diffusion of the riots&quot;.

==Aftermath==
=== Trials ===

The authorities felt severely threatened by the riots and responded with harsh punitive measures. Nearly 2,000 protesters were brought to trial in 1830–1831; 252 were sentenced to death (though only 19 were actually hanged), 644 were imprisoned and 481 were transported to penal colonies in Australia. Not all rioters were farm workers since the list of those punished included rural artisans, shoemakers, carpenters, wheelwrights, blacksmiths and cobblers. One of those hanged was reported to have been charged only because he had knocked the hat off the head of a member of the Baring banking family. Many of the protesters who were transported had their sentences remitted in 1835.

=== Social, economic and political reform ===
Eventually, the farmers agreed to raise wages, and the parsons and some landlords reduced the tithes and rents. However, many farmers reneged on the agreements, and the unrest increased.

Many people advocated political reform as the only solution to the unrest, one of them being the radical politician and writer William Cobbett. The authorities had received many requests to prosecute him for the speeches that he had made in defence of the rural labourer, but it was for his articles in the &quot;Political Register&quot; that he was eventually charged with seditious libel. He wrote an article, &quot;The Rural War&quot;, about the Swing Riots. He blamed those in society who lived off unearned income at the expense of hard-working agricultural labourers; his solution was parliamentary reform. During his trial in July 1831 at the Guildhall, he subpoenaed six members of the cabinet, including the prime minister. Cobbett defended himself by going on the attack. He tried to ask the government ministers awkward questions supporting his case, but they were disallowed by the Lord Chief Justice. However, he was able to discredit the prosecution&#x27;s case, and at great embarrassment to the government, he was acquitted.

A major concern was that the Swing Riots could spark a larger revolt. That was reinforced by the 29 July 1830 revolution in France, which overthrew Charles X, and the independence of Belgium from the Netherlands later in 1830. The support for parliamentary reform was on party lines, with the Tories against reform and the Whigs having proposed changes well before the Swing riots. The farm labourers who were involved in the disturbances did not have a vote, but it is probable that the largely landowning classes, who could vote, were influenced by the Swing Riots to support reform.

Earl Grey, during a House of Lords debate in November 1830, suggested the best way to reduce the violence was to introduce reform of the House of Commons. The Tory Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, replied that the existing constitution was so perfect that he could not imagine any possible alternative that would be an improvement. When that was reported, a mob attacked Wellington&#x27;s home in London. The unrest had been confined to Kent, but during the following two weeks of November, it escalated massively by crossing East and West Sussex into Hampshire, with Swing letters appearing in other nearby counties.

On 15 November 1830, Wellington&#x27;s government was defeated by a vote in the House of Commons. Two days later, Earl Grey was asked to form a Whig government. Grey assigned a cabinet committee to produce a plan for parliamentary reform. Lord Melbourne became Home Secretary in the new government. He blamed local magistrates for being too lenient, and the government appointed a Special Commission of three judges to try rioters in the counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire.

==== Acts of Parliament ====
The riots were a major influence on the Whig government. They added to the strong social, political and agricultural unrest throughout Britain in the 1830s, encouraging a wider demand for political reform, culminating in the introduction of the Great Reform Act 1832. The act was the first of several reforms that over the course of a century transformed the British political system from one based on privilege and corruption to one based on universal suffrage and the secret ballot. In domestic elections before the Great Reform Act 1832, only about three per cent of the English population could vote. Most constituencies had been founded in the Middle Ages and so the newly-industrial northern England had virtually no representation. Those who could vote were mainly the large landowners and wealthy commoners.

The Great Reform Act 1832 was followed by the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, ending &quot;outdoor relief&quot; in cash or kind and setting up a chain of designedly unwholesome workhouses covering larger areas across the country to which the poor had to go if they wanted help.

<text>Colonel William Paterson, FRS (17 August 1755 – 21 June 1810) was a Scottish soldier, explorer, Lieutenant Governor and botanist best known for leading early settlement at Port Dalrymple in Tasmania. In 1795, Paterson gave an order that resulted in the massacre of a number of men, women and children, members of the Bediagal tribe.

==Early years==
A native of Montrose, Scotland, Paterson was interested in botany as a boy and trained in horticulture at Syon in London. Paterson was sent to the Cape Colony by the wealthy and eccentric Countess of Strathmore to collect plants, he arrived in Table Bay on board the &quot;Houghton&quot; in May 1777. He made four trips into the interior between May 1777 and March 1780, when he departed. In 1789 Paterson published &quot;Narrative of Four Journeys into the Country of the Hottentots and Caffraria&quot;, which he dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks.

==Career==
Paterson was originally commissioned as an ensign in the 98th Regiment of Foot and served in India. He later transferred to the 73rd Regiment of Foot after the 98th&#x27;s disbandment in 1787. In 1789, he was promoted to captain in the New South Wales Corps, serving under Major Francis Grose. After some time spent recruiting, he arrived in Sydney in October 1791. From November 1791 until March 1793 he served in command on Norfolk Island. Whilst there he collected botanical, geological and insect specimens and sent them to Banks. He also provided seed to the Lee and Kennedy and Colvill nurseries. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1798.

In 1794 he served for a year as Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales. In 1800 he was re-appointed to the post and served a second term until 1808.

In May 1795, following the alleged killing of two settlers Paterson ordered two officers and 66 soldiers to:

 destroy as many (Aboriginal Australians) as they could meet with ... in the hope of striking terror, to erect gibbets in different places, whereon the bodies of all they might kill were to be hung ...

Seven or eight Bediagal people were killed. A crippled man, some children and five women (one being heavily pregnant) were taken to Sydney as prisoners. One of the women and her baby had serious gunshot wounds. The child died not long after as did the newborn baby of the pregnant woman.

In 1801, Paterson fought a duel with John Macarthur and was wounded in the shoulder.
He led an expedition to the Hunter Region in 1801 and up the Paterson River (later named in his honour by Governor King). The expedition discovered coal in the area that would later become the vast South Maitland Coalfields; it was a discovery of great economic significance. In 1804, he led an expedition to Port Dalrymple, in what is now Tasmania, exploring the Tamar River and going up the North Esk River farther than European had previously gone.

Between 1804 and 1808 Paterson was also appointed Commandant at Port Dalrymple, the administrator of the colony in the north of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. In 1806, Paterson&#x27;s duties as commander of the New South Wales Corps required him to return to Sydney, but he went back to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in 1807, and stayed until December 1808. During this time he corresponded regularly with the eminent naturalist Sir Joseph Banks, sending a number of specimens.

The New South Wales Corps selected Paterson as acting Governor of New South Wales on 1 January 1809 after the deposition of Governor Captain William Bligh in the so-called &quot;Rum Rebellion.&quot; He was replaced by the newly arrived Lachlan Macquarie by the end of the year. He left Sydney for England on 12 May 1810, but died on board HMS &quot;Dromedary&quot; while off Cape Horn just a few weeks later.

His widow Elizabeth married Francis Grose, Paterson&#x27;s predecessor as Lieutenant Governor, in April 1814, but Grose died a month later. Elizabeth died in Liverpool, England in 1839.

Panama finished as runners-up at the CONCACAF Gold Cup in 2005, 2013 and 2023, losing to the United States on the former two occasions and to Mexico in the latter. Panama has also competed in the sub-regional Copa Centroamericana which they won in 2009, beating Costa Rica in the final (0–0 on full-time, 5–3 on penalties). They finished in third place on three occasions (1993, 2011, 2014), and finished as runners-up behind Honduras in the 2017 edition, which they hosted.

The national team is nicknamed &quot;Los Canaleros&quot; (), in reference to the Panama Canal.

==History==

=== Before 21st century ===
=== 2011 Gold Cup ===
In the 2011 Gold Cup, Panama was placed into Group C with Canada, United States, and Guadeloupe. They debuted with a 3–2 win over Guadeloupe. In the next match, they beat the United States 2–1. Then they tied 1–1 against Canada, winning their group for the first time in the Gold Cup. They played against El Salvador in the quarter-finals, beating them 5–3 on penalties. They played against the United States again, this time in the semi-finals, although they lost 1–0.

=== 2013 Gold Cup ===
In the 2013 Gold Cup, Panama began with a 2–1 win over Mexico, with Gabriel Torres scoring both goals. In the second match, Panama beat Martinique 1–0 with Gabriel Torres scoring the only goal. With two victories, they secured their qualification to the knockout stages. Already being qualified, they tied 0–0 against Canada securing the first place in their group. They easily beat Cuba 6-1 and qualified for the semi-finals with Blas Pérez and Gabriel Torres scoring two goals each. They faced Mexico again in the semifinals and beat them 2–1 to advance to the final for the second time in the competition against the United States, which was their opponent in the 2005 final and beat them on penalties. The Panamanians could not get their revenge on them and lost 0–1 with a goal from Brek Shea.

===2014 World Cup qualifying===
Panama came close to advancing out of the fourth round of qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup. In their last match, which was against the United States, they led 2–1 after 90 minutes and were assured to advance to a play-off against New Zealand, but conceded two goals in stoppage time and were eliminated, with Mexico taking the playoff slot instead.

=== 2015 Gold Cup ===
In the 2015 Gold Cup, Panama was drawn into Group A, along with the United States, Haiti, and Honduras. All of their games were a 1–1 draws. However this was enough to advance to the knockout stage as the best ranked third place. In the quarter-finals, they played against Trinidad and Tobago, drawing 1–1 after 90 minutes and defeating them 6–5 on penalties. They advanced to the semi-finals against Mexico; Roman Torres scored on behalf of Panama and Andres Guardado scored for Mexico. The first 90 minutes ended in a 1–1 draw; Panama was then defeated 2–1 in extra time after referee Mark Geiger gave Mexico a penalty, which Andres Guardado also scored. With this result, Panama earned the chance to play the third place playoff against the United States. The score was 1–1 after extra time and Panama won 3–2 on penalties, giving them third place. Mexico ended up defeating Jamaica in the final to crown themselves champions.

===2018 World Cup qualifying===
Four years after failing to qualify for the 2014 World Cup, &quot;Los Canaleros&quot; finally qualified for the World Cup after defeating Costa Rica 2−1 in their final qualifying match, which meant that the United States, who lost to Trinidad and Tobago 2–1, failed to qualify for the first time since 1986. Román Torres, who scored the winning goal in the 87th minute, was subsequently considered a national hero. The day after the match, the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela declared a national holiday to commemorate the achievement, stating on his Twitter profile: &quot;The voice of the people has been heard... Tomorrow will be a national holiday&quot;.

===2018 World Cup===
The national football team of Panama were drawn in Group G, together with European giants Belgium and England and the African side Tunisia. Their debut World Cup match was against Belgium, on 18 June 2018. &quot;Los Canaleros&quot; initially held on, with the score 0–0 at half-time, before eventually suffering a 3–0 loss. Six days later, Panama faced England, and this time succumbed to a 6–1 defeat; Felipe Baloy&#x27;s late goal was the nation&#x27;s first at a World Cup, but it was not enough to save them from elimination. A 2–1 loss to Tunisia in their final game meant that Panama finished bottom of their group - and 32nd and last in the tournament overall - having lost all three of their games and conceded eleven goals.

Many of her songs have been covered by other artists, including Henri Salvador, Jane Birkin, Francoise Hardy, Rosa Passos, Jacky Terasson, Emmanuelle Seigner, Benjamin Biolay and Anna Calvi. Her music has been featured in TV series including &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;Big Love&quot;, and in movies including &quot;Love Me No More&quot; (2008). Her song &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; has been the sound of the &quot;Skyteam&quot; campaign, and in 2008 her song &quot;Lay Your Head Down&quot; was the synch for the international H&amp;M Spring commercial.

In 2008, Keren Ann composed, with Tibo Javoy, the entire sound design for the European TV channel Arte. She co-wrote and co-produced, with Doriand, Emmanuelle Seigner&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Dingue&quot;.

<text>GWN7 was an Australian television network serving all of Western Australia outside metropolitan Perth. It launched on 10 March 1967 as &quot;BTW-3&quot; in Bunbury. It was an affiliate of the Seven Network and served one of the largest geographic television markets in the world—almost one-third of the continent. The network&#x27;s name, &quot;GWN&quot;, is an acronym of Golden West Network, the network&#x27;s name from 1979 to when the current name was adopted in 2011.

In 2021, GWN7&#x27;s parent company Prime Media Group merged with Seven and the brand was retired in 2022.

==History==

===Origins===
GWN began life as a group of smaller, independent stations:

*10 March 1967: BTW–3 Bunbury 
**23 August 1968: GSW–9 Mount Barker – relay
**29 August 1974: GSW–10 Albany – relay
*18 June 1971: VEW–8 Kalgoorlie
**29 November 1971: VEW–3 Kambalda – relay
*21 January 1977: GTW–11 Geraldton 
Prior to these stations signing on, remote Western Australia had been one of the few areas of Australia without local television; the only television outlets in the area were relays of ABC Television out of Perth.

Jack Bendat purchased South West Telecasters (owner of BTW/GSW) in 1979, and changed the company&#x27;s name to Golden West Network.

GWN applied to broadcast an additional service on 31 October 1984, when the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal called for applications to broadcast to Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands via satellite as part of the Remote Commercial Television License (RCTS) scheme. GWN was granted the Remote Commercial Television License (RCTS) in June 1985 and the service went to air on 18 October 1986 using the call-sign &quot;WAW&quot;.

Not long after, GWN continued to expand within Western Australia, acquiring Mid-Western Television (owner of VEW-8 Kalgoorlie) in December 1985 for 7 million, and Geraldton Telecasters (owner of GTW-11) in March 1987 for an undisclosed amount. The takeovers gave the network a monopoly over all commercial television services in regional Western Australia. In 1987, Bendat and Kerry Stokes merged their media interests into joint company BDC Investments. Later that year, Northern Star Holdings purchased BDC for 206 million. Northern Star were forced to sell GWN to satisfy existing media regulations. GWN was sold back to Stokes in December 1988 for 54 million, who upgraded equipment throughout the network. In April 1990, the callsigns BTW and GSW were merged, to become &quot;SSW&quot;. During the late 1980s, GWN was promoted as &quot;GWN Satellite Television&quot; and aired programs from mostly the Nine Network plus a few from Seven and Ten with STW&#x27;s Channel Nine (later National Nine) News (from Perth) providing the national news link.

===1990s to the 2000s===
Kerry Stokes gained control of the Seven Network in 1995, and attempted to sell GWN to Seven in return for more shares. Seven Network shareholders agreed to the trade in April 1996 – a deal which would have seen Seven acquire GWN for 72.8 million thus becoming the regional network affiliate for Western Australia. The arrangement was called off when the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission found that a 15-year exclusive programming deal GWN made with the Nine Network was anti competitive and opposed the acquisition. The Seven Network subsequently dropped their plans to purchase GWN. And as a result, the network soon ended its programming deal with Nine for exclusive broadcast of its shows in regional areas of the state.

Prime Television purchased GWN in November 1996 from Stokes for 71 million. Remote Western Australia was one of the few areas of regional Australia that was not aggregated, given its small population. This ended in 1997, when WIN Television was granted the rights to a second television license in regional Western Australia, ending GWN&#x27;s monopoly of all three Australian commercial channels. In March 1999, GWN opted to become a sole Seven Network affiliate, in-line with its eastern sister, Prime Television. As a result, WIN Television WA picked up both the Nine Network and Network 10 affiliations.

The network&#x27;s transmission operations were moved from Bunbury to Prime Media Group&#x27;s digital broadcast facility in Canberra in April 2005. Programming was delivered to regional Western Australia via a satellite feed.

A proposal for a third television station – a joint venture between GWN&#x27;s parent company Prime Media Group and WIN Corporation – was submitted to the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority in 2006. Similar to Mildura Digital Television, the new channel will operate under a Section 38B licence, as a Network 10 affiliate named Ten West.

===2010 and beyond===
The new decade saw the introduction of digital television, with the Central Wheatbelt, Kalgoorlie, Karratha and Mingenew digital transmitters launching on 10 June 2010. The broadcasters shared a single digital transmitter for GWN, WIN WA and the new Ten West in standard definition.

On 15 January 2011, Prime Media Group reported that GWN and Prime were to rebrand to GWN7 and Prime7 respectively, in connection to their strong relations with the metropolitan stations of the Seven Network. Their news bulletins were quickly renamed as &quot;GWN7 News&quot; and &quot;Prime7 News&quot;. These bulletins were relaunched on 16 January 2011 at 5:57pm.

Digital transmitter upgrades continued on 28 July 2011, with Bunbury and surrounds being introduced to the full suite of digital channels for the first time, including 7two and 7mate. On 30 July 2011, the regional networks began broadcasting on the Viewer Access Satellite Television platform.

On 12 February 2018, GWN7&#x27;s master control facilities (transmission and technical operations) were transferred to Prime Media&#x27;s national playout centre in Canberra, with the WA facilities beamed through satellite and microwave links. Playout of GWN7&#x27;s programming was later transferred to Mediahub located at Sydney&#x27;s suburb of Ingleburn (which houses playout for ABC Television and WIN Television), before once again transferred to a facility operated by Australia&#x27;s telco provider Telstra (shared with hybrid-funded broadcaster SBS Television).

=== 2021: Merger with Seven ===
On 1 November 2021, Seven West Media announced that it would acquire all the shares and subsidiaries of Prime Media Group. This was SWM&#x27;s second attempt at purchasing Prime Media, after its previous attempt in 2019 was thwarted by Australian Community Media boss Antony Catalano and rival WIN Corporation owner Bruce Gordon, citing Seven&#x27;s debt problems at the time and its poor ratings performance as the reason for their refusal. Prime shareholders approved the deal on 23 December, with the sale completed on 31 December. This development would mark an end to the GWN brand name after 33 years in favour of Seven Network&#x27;s branding and would see its statewide news service carrying the Seven News brand. Prior to this, GWN (alongside its sister Prime) was the only commercial network affiliate not carrying full metro network branding across promotions and programming, in contrast to WOW&#x27;s owner WIN which carries the Nine Network branding full-time since its return to carrying Nine&#x27;s programming in 2021. On 23 May 2022, Seven West Media announced that the current branding of GWN7 will be unified into Seven Network branding across the station including for GWN7 Local News officially remains as retiring the GWN7 name. On 25 July 2022, the GWN7 brand was retired.

==Programming==
Since becoming a full Seven affiliate, GWN7&#x27;s on-air schedule had become almost identical to that of its metropolitan counterpart, TVW in Perth. &quot;Seven News Perth&quot; was aired live across the network direct from Perth. GWN7 also produced a weeknightly local news service, &quot;GWN7 Local News&quot;, shown live at 5:30pm. Since the network&#x27;s inception, it has featured a broad range of original regional programming, including the children&#x27;s program &quot;Doopa&#x27;s Club&quot; featuring the station mascot &quot;Doopa Dog&quot;; as well as community service strand &quot;GWN7 InfoNet&quot;, a series of short updates listing local community events.

===GWN7 Local News===
&quot;GWN7 Local News&quot; (now &quot;Seven News Regional WA&quot;, previously known as &quot;Golden West News&quot; or &quot;GWN News&quot;) was the network&#x27;s regional news service. Its main 30-minute program, airing live at 5:30pm on weeknights before &quot;Seven News Perth&quot;, dealt primarily with local news and current affairs. The bulletin was presented by Noel Brunning with news and sport; and Shauna Willis with weather. As of March 2012, GWN7 produced the only dedicated local news program for regional Western Australia.

The bulletin was produced and broadcast from GWN7&#x27;s Spencer Street newsroom in Bunbury CBD with reporters and camera crews also based at newsrooms in Perth, Albany, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Geraldton and Broome.

Since Seven&#x27;s acquisition of Prime Media would mean GWN7 News and Seven News will fall under one corporate umbrella, it is unclear if the network makes changes to its regional WA news production, since Seven West Media&#x27;s headquarters are located in Perth&#x27;s suburb of Osborne Park (where Seven O&amp;O TVW produces news content for the city and the state of WA).

In July 2022, the &quot;GWN7 Local News&quot; branding has been retired and now falls under the Seven News Regional WA brand.

==Availability==

GWN7 was available statewide in digital terrestrial and digital satellite format. The full suite of digital services, including 7TWO, 7mate, ishop TV and RACING.COM, were available in all areas with digital transmissions.

Below is a table showing the logical channel numbers (LCN) for the full suite of digital services.

===Terrestrial===
Digital terrestrial transmissions were available in all populated cities and major towns of regional Western Australia. Analog terrestrial services ceased transmission statewide on 25 June 2013.

===Satellite===
Digital satellite transmissions were available direct-to-home on the Viewer Access Satellite Television platform in areas that were not covered by adequate terrestrial transmissions.

==Logos==
The Golden West Network became a network in 1986, with a shared logo produced and used across the regional stations, featuring the letters &quot;GWN&quot; inside an outlined oval surrounded by an orbiting ring. This logo was used across the network until 1995, when a new logo was introduced with the removal of outlined oval surrounding the letters &quot;GWN&quot;. Following this, 2001 saw the launch of a new simplified yellow logo, with the removal of the orbiting ring. This logo was launched concurrently with a similarly design logo on Prime Television. Following the 2011 relaunch, a new logo was introduced which features the Seven Network logo. The relaunch logo featuring Seven Network was revised in 2013 from multi colour to be a single colour logo.

<doc id="1028253" wikidata="Q4385624" url="?curid=1028253" title="Patsy Palmer">
<text>Julie Anne Merkell (&quot;née&quot; Harris; born 26 May 1972), known professionally as Patsy Palmer, is an English actress and DJ, known for her roles as Natasha in the children&#x27;s drama series &quot;Grange Hill&quot; (1985–1987), and Bianca Jackson in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; which earned her the British Soap Award for Best Actress.

==Early life==
Palmer was born and grew up in Bethnal Green, London where she attended Globe Primary School and then nearby at Haggerston Girls Secondary School. She was brought up along with her two elder brothers, Albert and Harry, by her mother Pat. She also has half siblings named Georgia and Berty. Palmer&#x27;s father, Albert Harris, was Irish. Her mother first spotted her acting talent and encouraged her to go to Anna Scher&#x27;s acting school in London. Palmer was bullied at school, and has said that acting was a form of escape. At age six, she appeared in a West End production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;.

==Career==
===Early career===
Upon enrolling at the Anna Scher Theatre school, and learning about an accomplished actress already with the name Julie Harris, Palmer adopted her current name by using her mother&#x27;s maiden name and changing her given name to her mother&#x27;s pet name, Patsy. Palmer made her screen debut in the television programme &quot;The Gentle Touch&quot; in 1984. Like many other &quot;EastEnders&quot; actors, Palmer appeared on the children&#x27;s drama show &quot;Grange Hill&quot; between 1985 and 1987. She went on to have small roles in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Tricky Business&quot; (1989), &quot;Making News&quot; (1990), &quot;Clarissa&quot; (1991), &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (1992), &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Bill,&quot; where she had four different roles from 1988 to 1993. She also appeared as an acne-ridden teenager in a 1989 Clearasil advert, and in a 1992 BT advert with other future &quot;EastEnders&quot; star Jake Wood.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===

In 1993, she was cast in the role of Bianca Jackson in BBC&#x27;s soap opera, &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Bianca&#x27;s on-screen marriage to Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) in 1997 drew one of the biggest soap audiences ever — more than 22 million. She remained in the role for six years, but left the show in 1999 to spend more time with her family and to concentrate on other projects. She reprised the role in May 2002 in a special entitled, &quot;EastEnders: Ricky and Bianca&quot;. The two-part, hour-long special was filmed in Manchester, which reunited Bianca and Ricky for the first time in over two years.

In 2005, Palmer publicly criticised &quot;EastEnders&quot;, branding the storylines ridiculous and unbelievable and stating that she &quot;wouldn&#x27;t go back to &quot;EastEnders&quot;&quot;. However, in October 2007 the BBC announced that Palmer would be returning to the soap as a full-time character; she made her comeback on-screen in April 2008. Palmer has commented &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to explore what Bianca has been doing with her life and seeing what she is going to get up to next&quot;, and &quot;EastEnders&quot; executive producer, Diederick Santer, added, &quot;I&#x27;m delighted to welcome Patsy Palmer home to &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Bianca is one of the most popular characters the show has ever had&quot;. In 2014, Palmer announced that she was leaving the soap opera. She reprised the role again in the autumn of 2019 for a short stint. In February 2020, it was announced that Palmer would be reprising her role as Bianca again, with scenes set to air later in the year. However, this was later cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic restrictions. In January 2024 it was announced that she would be returning for a short storyline in Spring 2024 and again in the Autumn of 2024. Palmer returned on Monday 23rd September 2024. 

===Other work===

Palmer worked on the first series of &quot;OK TV&quot; with Fiona Phillips in 1999.

Palmer stood in for &quot;GMTV&quot;&#x27;s Lorraine Kelly, presenting her &quot;Lorraine Live&quot; section for a week in 1999, reporting from Miami on fashion, lifestyle, health and fitness. She has also co-hosted Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Big Breakfast&quot; as a guest presenter for a week. Palmer has released a number of hit fitness videos and DVDs: &quot;Patsy Palmer – The Club Workout&quot; (2000), &quot;Patsy Palmer – The Urban Workout&quot; (2002) and &quot;Patsy Palmer&#x27;s Ibiza Workout&quot; (2002). In 2006 Palmer made an appearance in the charity fitness DVD &quot;The Allstar Workout&quot;. Palmer&#x27;s film work includes the shorts &quot;Love Story&quot; (1999) directed by Nick Love, and &quot;Another Green World&quot; (2005) directed by Peter Chipping.

In 2005, Palmer took part in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; show, to raise money for the &quot;Children in Need&quot; fund. She has also made a cameo appearance with Catherine Tate&#x27;s sketch show &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;. In February 2007, she was a jury member on the BBC programme &quot;The Verdict&quot;, where various celebrities ruled on a contemporary and controversial case, based on evidence and examples from real life.

Palmer&#x27;s autobiography &quot;All of Me&quot; was released in the UK on 5 April 2007. In the book, she described her ascent to fame, her struggle with addiction and how she battled to overcome her problems. In 2003, in addition to acting, Palmer and her friend, Charlotte Cutler went into business with marketer Ken Wells and a Kent-based chemical company, to create &quot;Palmer Cutler&quot;, selling beauty and self-tanning products.

In 2008, a short film starring Palmer was released by housing and homelessness charity Shelter. Palmer has been DJing since 2012, including in United States since 2017. In January 2020, Palmer appeared as the Butterfly on the ITV reality singing competition &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. In March, Palmer participated in the third series of &quot;The Great Stand Up to Cancer Bake Off&quot;. In December, she appeared as a guest on &quot;The One Show&quot; in an episode dedicated to the late Barbara Windsor. In 2023, Palmer was a contestant on the fifteenth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. She was paired with Matt Evers and the pair were fourth to be eliminated.

For 10 years, starting in 2004, she lived with her husband and children in Western Terrace and then Kemptown, Brighton, England. Her brother, Harry Harris, is married to Lindsey Coulson, the actress who played her on-screen mother Carol Jackson in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. In April 2014, Palmer and most of her family moved to Malibu, California.

Palmer has said that she has been a drug- and alcohol-addict, and that during her 1990s stint on &quot;EastEnders&quot; she frequently turned up on set either high or hungover. She has said that she started experimenting with alcohol and drugs from the age of 10 and her addiction lasted for 24 years. In 2010, she stated that she had been clean of drugs and alcohol since September 2004 and that &quot;We don&#x27;t have drink in our house&quot;.

<text>The German Langshan is a breed of chicken developed from the exported Croad Langshan in Germany. It is a large, robust breed of exceptional height. Though most often raised for show, it has practical application as a layer and meat bird, as well. The standard-sized German Langshan is uncommon in both the United States and the United Kingdom, but the bantam form is popular in the latter.

== History ==

The Croad Langshan was first shipped to the United Kingdom in 1969, and thence to Germany. Along with the Minorca and Plymouth Rock, the Croad Langshan was used in the creation of the German Langshan. Through selective breeding, this resulted in a brown-tinted fowl, distinctly different from other Langshan varieties which are normally only recognised as having white, black or blue feathering. The German Langshan&#x27;s creation was completed by the early twentieth century.

== Appearance ==


The German Langshan is a large, heavy chicken: roosters weigh about 9 pounds or 4 kilograms. The chickens have a contoured back and a relatively small tail. With its long legs and upright posture the breed&#x27;s profile is often likened to a wine glass. They have a single comb. As said above, their legs are bare.

== Colors ==

The German Langshan is most often found in only three colours: Black, Blue, and White; others are known, but are rather rare.

== Characteristics ==

German Langshans are strong, vital chickens that grow up fast. They lay cream-colored eggs which are quite large. Their weight hinders flight. They can be tamed without much difficulty.

<text>An asterism () is a star-shaped concentration of light reflected or refracted from a gemstone. It can appear when a suitable stone is cut &quot;en cabochon&quot; (i.e. shaped and polished, not faceted).

A gemstone that exhibits this effect is called a star stone or asteria. The best known is star sapphire, but many other minerals can also be asteria, usually due to impurities in the crystal structure.

==Archetype==
The archetypal asteria is the star sapphire, generally corundum with near uniform impurities which is bluish-grey and milky or opalescent, which when lit has a star of six rays. In the red instance stellate reflection is rarer; the star-ruby occasionally found with the star-sapphire in Sri Lanka is among the most valued of &quot;fancy stones&quot;. Other examples are star-topaz (8 rays) and star diopside (4 rays); star garnets may display four-rayed or six-rayed asterisms.

==Description==
Asterism is generated by reflections of light from twin-lamellae or from extremely fine needle-shaped acicular inclusions within the stone&#x27;s crystal structure. A common cause is oriented sub-microscopic crystals of rutile within the gem mineral.

It occurs in rubies, sapphires, garnet, diopside, and spinel when a cabochon is cut from a suitable stone. Star sapphires and rubies display the property from titanium dioxide impurities (rutile) present in them. The star-effect or &quot;asterism&quot; is caused by the difference in refractive index between the host material and that of the dense inclusions of tiny fibers of rutile (also known as &quot;silk&quot;). Rutile causes the relative bright relief of a star in a host material such as corundum, which has a refractive index between 1.760 and 1.778, much lower than that of rutile. The stars are caused by the light reflecting from needle-like inclusions of rutile aligned perpendicularly to the rays of the star. The star-effect may be also caused by the inclusions of hematite. In black star sapphire hematite needles formed parallel to the faces of the second order prism produce asterism. Some star sapphires from Thailand contain both hematite and rutile needles forming a 12-ray star. 

Star-stones were formerly regarded with much superstition. Pliny the Elder&#x27;s example is consistent with a moonstone; he described it as a colourless stone from India within which was the appearance of a star shining with the light of the moon. However, since rutile is present in most common star gemstones, these are almost never completely transparent.

A distinction can be made between two types of asterism:
* Epiasterism, such as that seen in sapphire and most other gems, is the result of a reflection of light on parallel arranged inclusions inside the gemstone.
* Diasterism, such as that seen in rose quartz, is the result of light transmitted through the stone. In order to see this effect, the stone must be illuminated from behind. Rose quartz also exhibits epiasterism.

<text>An asterism is an observed pattern or group of stars in the sky. Asterisms can be any identified pattern or group of stars, and therefore are a more general concept than the 88 formally defined constellations. Constellations are based on asterisms, but unlike asterisms, constellations outline and today completely divide the sky and all its celestial objects into regions around their central asterisms. For example, the asterism known as the Big Dipper or the Plough comprises the seven brightest stars in the constellation Ursa Major. Another asterism is the triangle, within the constellation of Capricornus.

Asterisms range from simple shapes of just a few stars to more complex collections of many stars covering large portions of the sky. The stars themselves may be bright naked-eye objects or fainter, even telescopic, but they are generally all of a similar brightness to each other. The larger brighter asterisms are useful for people who are familiarizing themselves with the night sky.

The patterns of stars seen in asterisms are not necessarily a product of any physical association between the stars, but are rather the result of the particular perspectives of their observations. For example the Summer Triangle is a purely observational physically unrelated group of stars, but the stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt are all members of the Orion OB1 association and five of the seven stars of the Big Dipper are members of the Ursa Major Moving Group. Physical associations, such as the Hyades or Pleiades, can be asterisms in their own right and part of other asterisms at the same time.

==Background of asterisms and constellations==
In many early civilizations, it was common to associate groups of stars in connect-the-dots stick-figure patterns. Some of the earliest records are those of ancient India in the Vedanga Jyotisha and the Babylonians. Different cultures identified different constellations, although a few of the more obvious patterns tend to appear in the constellations of multiple cultures, such as those of Orion and Scorpius. As anyone could arrange and name a grouping of stars there was no distinct difference between a &quot;constellation&quot; and an &quot;asterism&quot;. For example, Pliny the Elder mentions 72 asterisms in his book Naturalis Historia.

A general list containing 48 constellations likely began to develop with the astronomer Hipparchus (c. 190 – c. 120 BCE). As constellations were considered to be composed only of the stars that constituted the figure, it was always possible to use any leftover stars to create and squeeze in a new grouping among the established constellations.

Exploration by Europeans to other parts of the globe exposed them to stars previously unknown to them. Two astronomers particularly known for greatly expanding the number of southern constellations were Johann Bayer (1572–1625) and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1713–1762). Bayer had listed twelve figures made out of stars that were too far south for Ptolemy to have seen. Lacaille created 14 new groups, mostly for the area surrounding South Celestial Pole. Many of these proposed constellations have been formally accepted, but the rest have remained as asterisms.

In 1928, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) precisely divided the sky into 88 official constellations following geometric boundaries encompassing all of the stars within them. Any additional new selected groupings of stars or former constellations are often considered as asterisms. However, technical distinctions between the terms &#x27;constellation&#x27; and &#x27;asterism&#x27; often remain somewhat ambiguous.

== Asterisms consisting of first-magnitude stars ==
Some asterisms consist completely of bright first-magnitude stars, which mark out simple geometric shapes.
* The &quot;Summer Triangle&quot; of Deneb, Altair, and Vega – α Cygni, α Aquilae, and α Lyrae – is prominent in the northern hemisphere summer skies, as its three stars are all of the 1st magnitude. The stars of the Triangle are in the band of the Milky Way which marks the galactic equator, and are in the direction of the Galactic Center.
* The &quot;Winter Triangle&quot; is visible in the northern sky&#x27;s winter and comprises the first magnitude stars Betelgeuse, Sirius and Procyon (the second and fourth closest star or star system visible without aid).
** The larger northern &quot;Winter Hexagon&quot; includes seven of the twenty-two first-magnitude stars visible in the sky, with Pollux, Capella, Aldebaran, Rigel, Sirius and Procyon, and with the 2nd-magnitude Castor on the periphery, and Betelgeuse off-center. Adding Betelgeuse then it is known as the &quot;Heavenly &#x27;G&quot;&#x27;. It encircles the galactic anticenter, as well as incorporates constellations such as Gemini and Orion. It also includes in the background of Aldebaran the Hyades, the nearest star cluster and one of five first-magnitude deep-sky objects, two of which can be seen just north-east of the Hyades, the Pleiades also in the Taurus constellation and the Alpha Persei Cluster (with Alcyone and Mirfak as the brightest stars).
* The northern &quot;Spring Triangle&quot; consists of Arcturus, Regulus and Spica.
** The &quot;Great Diamond&quot; consisting of Arcturus, Spica, Denebola and Cor Caroli, the latter two not being first-magnitude stars. An east-west line from Arcturus to Denebola forms an equilateral triangle with Cor Caroli to the North, and another with Spica to the South. Together these two triangles form the Diamond. Formally, the stars of the Diamond are in the constellations Boötes, Virgo, Leo, and Canes Venatici.

Other asterisms consist partially of multiple first-magnitude stars.
*The &quot;Southern Cross&quot; including the first-magnitude stars Acrux and Mimosa, west of the Carina Nebula (one of five first-magnitude deep-sky objects), and with the first-magnitude stars Alpha Centauri (the closest star to the Sun) and Beta Centauri pointing at the cross, distinguishing the cross from less bright and similar asterisms like the Diamond Cross or False Cross.

All other first-magnitude stars are the only such stars in their asterisms or constellations, with Canopus in the Argo Navis asterism south of Sirius, visually east of the Carina Nebula and near the Large Magellanic Cloud (both being first-magnitude deep-sky objects), Achernar in the Eridanus constellation east of Canopus, Fomalhaut in the Southern Fish constellation east of Achernar and Antares in the Scorpius constellation visually near the Galactic Center.

== Constellation-based asterisms ==

* The &quot;Big Dipper&quot;, also known as &quot;The Plough&quot; or &quot;Charles&#x27;s Wain&quot;, is composed of the seven brightest stars in Ursa Major. These stars delineate the Bear&#x27;s hindquarters and exaggerated tail, or alternatively, the &quot;handle&quot; forming the upper outline of the bear&#x27;s head and neck. With its longer tail, Ursa Minor hardly appears bearlike at all, and is widely known by its pseudonym, the &quot;Little Dipper&quot;.
* The &quot;Northern Cross&quot; in Cygnus. The upright runs from Deneb (α Cyg) in the Swan&#x27;s tail to Albireo (β Cyg) in the beak. The transverse runs from ε Cygni in one wing to δ Cygni in the other.
* The &quot;Southern Cross&quot; is an asterism by name, but the whole area is now recognised as the constellation Crux. The main stars are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and arguably also Epsilon Crucis. Earlier, Crux &quot;was&quot; deemed an asterism when Bayer created it in &quot;Uranometria&quot; (1603) from the stars in the hind legs of Centaurus, decreasing the size of Centaur. These same stars were probably identified by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia as the asterism &#x27;Thronos Caesaris.&#x27;
* The &quot;Fish Hook&quot; is the traditional Hawaiian name for Scorpius. The image will be even more obvious if the chart&#x27;s lines from Antares (α Sco) to Beta Scorpii (β Sco) and Pi Scorpii (π Sco) are replaced with a line from Beta through Delta Scorpii (δ Sco) to Pi forming a large capped &quot;J.&quot; Adding vertical lines to connect the limbs at the left and right in the main diagram of Hercules will complete the figure of the Butterfly.
* Boötes is sometimes known as the &quot;Ice Cream Cone&quot;. It is also known as the &quot;Kite&quot;.
* The stars of Cassiopeia form a W which is often used as a nickname.
* The &quot;Great Square&quot; of Pegasus is the quadrilateral formed by the stars Markab, Scheat, Algenib, and Alpheratz, representing the body of the winged horse. The asterism was recognized as the constellation ASH.IKU &quot;The Field&quot; on the MUL.APIN cuneiform tablets from about 1100 to 700 BC. Alpheratz is now only considered a part of the constellation Andromeda whereas formerly the star was a part of both constellations.
* The &quot;Bowl of Virgo&quot; is formed by the stars Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Eta Virginis. Together with Spica, they form a Y shape.

* The &quot;Three Leaps of the Gazelle&quot; consists of three pairs of stars in Ursa Major aligned in a row spanning about 30 degrees. In Arabic lore, the star pairs are pictured as the hoof prints of a gazelle startled from a pond by Leo the lion. (The &quot;pond&quot; is pictured as the Coma Star Cluster.) The first pair of stars are Xi and Nu, second pair Upsilon and Lambda, third pair Kappa and Iota Ursa Majoris. The pairs also mark three of the bear&#x27;s paws.

Some asterisms refer to portions of traditional constellation figures. These include:

* The &quot;Water Jar&quot; or &quot;Urn&quot; of Aquarius is a Y-shaped figure centered upon Zeta Aquarii and includes Gamma, Eta and Pi. It pours water in a stream of more than 20 stars terminating with the star Fomalhaut.
* The &quot;Crab Breast&quot; of Cancer is a quadrilateral formed by the four stars Gamma, Delta, Eta and Theta Cancri which make up the carapace (inner shell) of the Crab. Contained within is the Beehive Cluster (Messier 44) which includes Epsilon Cancri.
* The &quot;Snake Head&quot; is the westernmost portion of Hydra consisting of the stars Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Rho and Sigma Hydrae.
* &quot;Orion&#x27;s Belt&quot; consists of the three bright stars Zeta (Alnitak), Epsilon (Alnilam) and Delta Orionis (Mintaka) which form the belt of Orion.
* The &quot;Bull&#x27;s Face&quot; of Taurus is a V-shaped figure formed by prominent members of the Hyades cluster, including stars Gamma, Delta¹, Delta², Delta³, Epsilon, Theta Tauri, as well as the bright star Alpha Tauri (Aldebaran) which forms the red eye of the Bull.

== Other particular asterisms ==

Other asterisms are also composed of stars from one constellation, but do not refer to the traditional figures. 
* Four stars (Beta, Upsilon, Theta, and Omega Carinae) form a well-shaped diamond – the &quot;Diamond Cross&quot;.
* The &quot;Saucepan&quot; or &quot;Pot&quot;, being the same stars as the Belt and Sword of Orion. The end of the handle is at ι Orionis, with the far rim at η Orionis.
* The four central stars in Hercules, Epsilon (ε Her), Zeta (ζ Her), Eta (η Her), and Pi (π Her), form the &quot;Keystone&quot;. The bright globular cluster Messier 13 lies along the western segment, between Zeta and Eta.
* The curve of stars at the front end of the Lion from Epsilon (ε Leo) to Regulus (α Leo), looking much like a mirror-image question mark, has long been known as the &quot;Sickle&quot;.
* The brighter stars of Sagittarius form the &quot;Teapot&quot;. (The Large Sagittarius Star Cloud appears to be steam emerging from the &quot;spout&quot;.)
* Northeast of the Teapot asterism lies the fainter &quot;Teaspoon&quot;, consisting of the stars ξ¹, ξ², ο, π, ρ¹ and ρ² Sagitarii.
* Four bright stars in Delphinus (Sualocin or α Delphini, Rotanev or β Delphini, γ Delphini and δ Delphini) form &quot;Job&#x27;s Coffin&quot;.
* The &quot;Terebellum&quot; is a small quadrilateral of four faint stars (Omega, 59, 60, 62) in Sagittarius&#x27; hindquarters.
* Just south of Pegasus, the western fish of Pisces is home to the &quot;Circlet&quot; formed from Gamma (γ Piscium), Kappa (κ Piscium), Lambda (λ Piscium), TX Piscium, Iota (ι Piscium), and Theta (θ Piscium).
* Dubhe and Merak (Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris), the two stars at the end of the bowl of the Big Dipper are often called the &quot;Pointers&quot;: a line from β to α and continued for about five times the distance between them arrives at the North Celestial Pole and the star Polaris (α UMi/Alpha Ursae Minoris), the North Star.
* Rigil Kentaurus (α Centauri) and Hadar (β Centauri) are the &quot;Southern Pointers&quot; leading to the Southern Cross and thus helping to distinguish Crux from the False Cross.

== Asterisms across multiple constellations ==
Other asterisms that are formed from stars in more than one constellation.
* The &quot;Egyptian X&quot; is a large asterism which, like the Diamond of Virgo, is composed of a pair of equilateral triangles. Sirius (α CMa), Procyon (α CMi), and Betelgeuse (α Ori) form one to the North (Winter Triangle) while Sirius, Naos (ζ Pup), and Phakt (α Col) form another to the South. Unlike the Diamond, however, these triangles meet, not base-to-base, but vertex-to-vertex. The name derives from both the shape and, because the stars straddle the Celestial Equator, it is more easily seen from south of the Mediterranean than in Europe.
* The &quot;Lozenge&quot; is a small diamond formed from three stars – Eltanin, Grumium, and Rastaban (Gamma, Xi, and Beta Draconis) – in the head of Draco and one – Iota Herculis – in the foot of Hercules.
* The diamond-shaped &quot;False Cross&quot; is composed of the four stars Alsephina (δ Velorum), Markeb (κ Velorum), Avior (ε Carinae), and Aspidiske (ι Carinae). Although its component stars are not quite as bright as those of the Southern Cross, it is somewhat larger and better shaped than the Southern Cross, for which it is sometimes mistaken, causing errors in astronavigation. Like the Southern Cross, three of its main four stars are whitish and one orange.
* The &quot;Northern Y&quot; is formed by four prominent stars, Arcturus (α Boötis), Seginus (γ Boötis), Alphecca (α Coronae Borealis), and centered on Izar (ε Boötis). From the United Kingdom in particular, where there is serious light pollution in many areas and also twilight much of the night when these constellations appear, this &quot;Y&quot; is often visible while other stars of Boötes and Corona Borealis are not.
* The &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;, aligned north to south, consists of the stars Epsilon Pegasi, Alpha Aquarii, Beta Aquarii and Delta Capricorni. Easily visible to naked eyes even in light polluted skies, the asterism is useful for orienting among three constellations.
* The &quot;Serpent Bowl&quot; is a large curved asterism spanning 3.5 hours of right ascension, from mid-northern latitudes best seen in July and August evenings. From west to east, it includes the stars Delta, Alpha and Epsilon Serpentis, Delta, Epsilon, Upsilon, Zeta and Eta Ophiuchi, Xi Serpentis, Nu and Tau Ophiuchi, Eta and Theta Serpentis.
* The &quot;Eagle Tail Corona&quot; is a flattened curved figure in the tail of Aquila and extending into Scutum. It consists of the stars 14, 15, Lambda and 12 Aquilae, Eta Scuti, HD 174208, R and Beta Scuti. The compact open cluster Messier 11 is also aligned with the curve.

== Telescopic asterisms ==

Asterisms range from the large and obvious to the small, and even telescopic.
* The &quot;37&quot; or &quot;LE&quot; of NGC 2169, in Orion.
* The &quot;Engagement Ring&quot; in Ursa Minor has the north star Polaris as the diamond, at one end of a ring of much fainter stars about one degree across.
* The &quot;Broken Engagement Ring&quot; in Ursa Major at 10:51 / +56°10&#x27; (preceding β Ursae Majoris, Merak).
* The &quot;Christmas Tree&quot; shape of the Christmas Tree Cluster, in Monoceros. It is made up of about approximately 40 stars.
* &quot;The Coathanger&quot;, in Vulpecula, also known as &quot;Brocchi&#x27;s Cluster&quot; (see image at top).
* &quot;Kemble&#x27;s Cascade&quot;, a chain of stars that ends in open cluster NGC 1502, in Camelopardalis.
* &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Hat&quot; (Picot 1), in Bootes (south of α Bootis, Arcturus).
* &quot;The Ring of the Nibelungen&quot; (Ferrero 27) in Draco, named after the 1857 German epic drama, at 15:57 / +62°32&#x27; (near galaxy NGC 6015).
* The V-shaped Messier 73 in Aquarius, determined to be an asterism in 2002.

<text>In typography, an asterism, ⁂, is a typographic symbol consisting of three asterisks placed in a triangle, which is used for a variety of purposes. The name originates from the astronomical term for a group of stars.

The asterism was originally used as a type of dinkus in typography, though increasingly rarely. It can also be used to mean &quot;untitled&quot; or author or title withheld as seen, for example, in some editions of &quot;Album for the Young&quot; by composer Robert Schumann (№ 21, 26, and 30). In meteorology, an asterism in a station model indicates moderate snowfall.

==Dinkus==

A dinkus is a typographical device to divide text, such as at section breaks. Its purpose is to &quot;indicate minor breaks in text&quot;, to call attention to a passage, or to separate sub-chapters in a book. An asterism used this way is thus a type of dinkus: nowadays this usage of the symbol is nearly obsolete. More commonly used dinkuses are three dots or three asterisks in a horizontal row.

<text>R v. S (RD), [1997] 3 SCR 484, is a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision which established rules governing reasonable apprehension of judicial bias in the court system and the consideration of social context, such as systemic racism, when rendering judgement. The accused was defended by Burnley &quot;Rocky&quot; Jones of Halifax, Nova Scotia.

== Facts ==
On October 17, 1993, in the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, a black youth was arrested—referred to in the case under the pseudonym &quot;S&quot;—for allegedly assaulting the police officer Stienburg while he was attempting to arrest another individual. The police officer claimed that the youth ran into him with his bike attempting to free the individual the police officer already had handcuffed. The youth, on the other hand, alleges that he stopped his bike to see what the police officer was doing, as a crowd had amassed at the scene. The youth recognised the individual being arrested and asked him repeatedly if he should call his mother, not once addressing the officer. Hearing the youth, the officer threatened to arrest him. When the youth continued to talk the police officer arrested him.

== Ruling ==
At the trial level, Judge Corrine Sparks acquitted the youth, for the reason that the only evidence was the testimony of the officer and the youth, and both had reasonable credibility. In the end of her judgement, she added,

&quot;I believe that probably the situation in this particular case is the case of a young police officer who overreacted. And I do accept the evidence of Mr. S. that he was told to shut up or he would be under arrest. That seems to be in keeping with the prevalent attitude of the day.&quot;

The last phrase became the focus of all the appeals to follow. Judgements needs to be based solely on the evidence while the phrase suggests some preconceived notions.

It was determined at the trial and appeal level that there was an &quot;apprehension of bias&quot; on the part of Sparks.

However, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal and restored Sparks&#x27; acquittal of RDS. The Court noted that

A judge who happens to be black is no more likely to be biased in dealing with black litigants, than a white judge is likely to be biased in favour of white litigants. All judges of every race, colour, religion, or national background are entitled to the same presumption of judicial integrity and the same high threshold for a finding of bias. (para. 115)
A high standard must be met before a finding of reasonable apprehension of bias can be made. Troubling as Judge Sparks’ remarks may be, the Crown has not satisfied its onus to provide the cogent evidence needed to impugn the impartiality of Judge Sparks. Although her comments, viewed in isolation, were unfortunate and unnecessary, a reasonable, informed person, aware of all the circumstances, would not conclude that they gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. (para. 158)

<text>ClarkNet was an Internet service provider (ISP) located in Ellicott City, Maryland that began operation in April 1993. It was the first ISP local to the Baltimore area and the second ISP native to Maryland. Operations ceased during 2003.

The company&#x27;s incorporated name was Clark Internet Services, Inc., the service was called ClarkNet, and it operated under the domain name of clark.net. ClarkNet was founded by Jamie Clark, son of Maryland State Senator James A. Clark, in April 1993. It was located on the Clark family farm, located between Clarksville, Maryland and Columbia, Maryland, and initially operated out of a working cow barn. Jamie Clark is deaf and most of the early employees were also deaf. As the company grew the offices moved to Columbia and the computer data center remained at the barn.

ClarkNet was a pioneer in many areas. It was the first ISP to provide dial-up TCP/IP access (via SLIP or PPP) targeted for the home user in the Mid Atlantic region. It was one of the first web servers in the world, listed by CERN as one of the first 100 web servers in existence and one of the first in the country to offer free web pages to its customers. It was the first ISP to provide local dial in access numbers to all of Baltimore, and many parts of Maryland. It was the second ISP native to Maryland. It was the country&#x27;s first (only?) deaf owned and operated ISP. It pioneered the use of &quot;Centrex ISDN&quot; which is a 24x7 dedicated flat-rate ISDN line. It hosted, for a time, one of the top ten root Usenet servers.

ClarkNet enjoyed a great deal of press exposure because of its early entry into the Internet, the fact it was a deaf-owned company, its unusual location on a working farm, and its excellent reputation for service. Washington, DC area institutions used ClarkNet as their first exposure to the Internet which included, among many others: NPR (National Public Radio), SANS (the SANS Institute), and The Washington Post. Jamie Clark was interviewed and pictured in Fortune Magazine and was the subject of a feature spot on NPR. ClarkNet was the largest dial-up provider in the Baltimore/Washington area for a time. It won several awards, such as Small Business Administration awards.

The company employed up to 80 people at its largest. The company was structured with five primary teams: Engineering, Customer Service, Sales and Marketing, Web Development, Accounting, along with a senior management team and a board of directors. ClarkNet also rolled out a training curriculum for individuals and businesses to teach basic to advanced courses in web development and Internet research.

Services provided included: Dialup TCP/IP; Dialup shell access; Dedicated circuits such as ISDN, T1, Frame Relay, SMDS; Web hosting; Web development; Colocation hosting. At its largest it had over 20,000 dialup customers and 2,000 dedicated customers.

ClarkNet was purchased by Verio in late 1997 but retained a large degree of local autonomy and continued to grow under the Verio brand with many of the original ClarkNet employees in place. Verio was sold to NTT in 2000 by which time the product focus had shifted away from dial-up and dedicated Internet access to web hosting and most of the original ClarkNet staff, products and network were let-go, dismantled or sold (respectively) over the 2000-2003 period.

The barn on the Clark farm where ClarkNet started burned down in an accident on November 15, 2004, although the company was no longer in existence nor being used by Verio at the time.

<doc id="1028285" wikidata="Q1528903" url="?curid=1028285" title="Gjallarhorn (band)">
<text>Gjallarhorn (, ) is a Finnish band that performs world music with roots in the folk music of Finland and Sweden. The group was formed in 1994. The band&#x27;s music echoes the ancient folk music tradition of Scandinavia with medieval ballads, minuets, prayers in runo-metric chanting and ancient Icelandic rímur epics in a modern way. The group is named after the Gjallarhorn associated with the god Heimdallr from the Norse mythology.

== The music ==
The band is Finnish and hails from Ostrobothnia, a Swedish-speaking region on the west coast of Finland, one of the four regions of the historical province of Ostrobothnia and the only region in Finland outside Åland where more people speak Swedish rather than Finnish.

The music of the band remains Swedish in character. Most of their repertoire is the acoustic folk music of these Swedish-speaking Finns, from the unique minuets and ballads that have only survived in Ostrobothnia, to the old traditional waltzes. The didgeridoo and sub-contrabass recorder offer an underlying drone, a technique shared by some other Nordic bands such as Garmarna. Also notable is their use of the hardanger fiddle and Jenny Wilhelms&#x27; &quot;kulning&quot;, a high-pitched, wordless vocal technique based on traditional Scandinavian cattle-herding calls.

== History ==
Gjallarhorn was formed in 1994 on the west coast of Finland, in the Swedish speaking area, by Jenny Wilhelms, Christopher Öhman (viola, mandola) and Jacob Frankenhaeuser (didgeridoo). The band started as a trio but became a quartet with percussion in 1996. The band has been a quartet ever since.

In 1997 the first CD &quot;Ranarop&quot; was released. The group was selected &quot;Folk music group of the year 1997&quot; and the CD was &quot;Folk music CD of the year 1997&quot; in Finland. In 1998 the band started touring frequently on a professional basis with performances at international world, folk and jazz music festivals. Gjallarhorn has toured in Europe, United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan.

The second CD &quot;Sjofn&quot; was released in 2000 and the third CD &quot;Grimborg&quot; in 2002. In 2003 &quot;Grimborg&quot; was awarded the French &quot;Academie Charles Cros&quot; prize for world music and Gjallarhorn was nominated for the music prize of the Nordic Council of Ministries.

In 2004 the band made a 10th anniversary tour, and the Swedish Cultural Fund of Finland selected the band with Jenny Wilhelms for their annual honor award, given to artists in different fields of cultural and educational work.

In 2005 the band started working on new material. The fourth album &quot;Rimfaxe&quot; was released in 2006. The album was mixed in the US by Bruce Swedien. The didgeridoo was replaced by Göran Månsson&#x27;s sub contrabass recorder as the drone effect and bass of the band.

<doc id="1028291" wikidata="Q450393" url="?curid=1028291" title="Krystyna Kuperberg">
<text>Krystyna M. Kuperberg (born &quot;Krystyna M. Trybulec&quot;; 17 July 1944) is a Polish-American mathematician who currently works as a professor of mathematics at Auburn University, where she was formerly an Alumni Professor of Mathematics.

==Early life and family==
Her parents, Jan W. and Barbara H. Trybulec, were pharmacists and owned a pharmacy in Tarnów. Her older brother is Andrzej Trybulec. Her husband Włodzimierz Kuperberg and her son Greg Kuperberg are also mathematicians, while her daughter Anna Kuperberg is a photographer.

==Education and career==
After attending high school in Gdańsk, she entered the University of Warsaw in 1962, where she studied mathematics. Her first mathematics course was taught by Andrzej Mostowski; later she attended topology lectures of Karol Borsuk and became fascinated by topology.

After obtaining her undergraduate degree, Kuperberg began graduate studies at Warsaw under Borsuk, but stopped after earning a master&#x27;s degree. She left Poland in 1969 with her young family to live in Sweden, then moved to the United States in 1972. She finished her Ph.D. in 1974, from Rice University, under the supervision of William Jaco. In the same year, both she and her husband were appointed to the faculty of Auburn University. From 1996 to 1998, Kuperberg served as an American Mathematical Society Council member at large.

==Contributions==
In 1987 she solved a problem of Bronisław Knaster concerning bi-homogeneity of continua. In the 1980s she became interested in fixed points and topological aspects of dynamical systems. In 1989 Kuperberg and Coke Reed solved a problem posed by Stanislaw Ulam in the Scottish Book. The solution to that problem led to her 1993 work in which she constructed a smooth counterexample to the Seifert conjecture. She has since continued to work in dynamical systems.

==Recognition==
In 1995 Kuperberg received the Alfred Jurzykowski Prize from the Kościuszko Foundation. Her major lectures include an American Mathematical Society Plenary Lecture in March 1995, a Mathematical Association of America Plenary Lecture in January 1996, and an International Congress of Mathematicians invited talk in 1998. In 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

<doc id="1028296" wikidata="Q7831650" url="?curid=1028296" title="Tractor configuration">
<text>In aviation, a tractor configuration is a propeller-driven fixed-wing aircraft with its engine mounted with the propeller in front, so that the aircraft is &quot;pulled&quot; through the air. This is the usual configuration; the pusher configuration places the airscrew behind, and &quot;pushes&quot; the aircraft forward. Through common usage, the word &quot;propeller&quot; has come to mean any airscrew, whether it pulls or pushes the aircraft.

In the early years of powered aviation both tractor and pusher designs were common. However, by the midpoint of the First World War, interest in pushers declined and the tractor configuration dominated. Today, propeller-driven aircraft are assumed to be tractors unless stated otherwise.

==Origins==
The first successful airplanes to have a &quot;tractor&quot; configuration were the 1907 Santos-Dumont Demoiselle and Blériot VII.

The first biplane airplane to have a &quot;tractor&quot; configuration was the Goupy No.2 (first flight on 11 March 1909) designed by Mario Calderara and financed by Ambroise Goupy at the French firm Blériot Aéronautique. It was the fastest airplane when it was made. At that time a distinction was made between a propeller (&quot;pushes the machine&quot;, akin to a ship&#x27;s propeller) and a tractor-[air]screw (&quot;pulls the machine through the air&quot;). The Royal Flying Corps called the tractors &quot;Bleriot type&quot; after Louis Bleriot, and pushers &quot;Farman type&quot;.

==Firing guns through the propeller==
A disadvantage of a single-engine tractor military aircraft was that it was initially impossible to fire a gun through the propeller arc without striking the blades. Early solutions included mounting guns (rifles or machine guns) to fire around the propeller arc, either at an angle to the side – which made aiming difficult – or on the top wing of a biplane so that the bullets passed over the propeller arc.

The first system to fire through the propeller was developed by French engineer Eugene Gilbert for Morane-Saulnier, and involved fitting strong metal &quot;deflector wedges&quot; to the propeller blades of a Morane-Saulnier L monoplane, so that bullets fired when a propeller blade obstructed the line of fire were deflected rather than damaging the propeller. It was employed with immediate success by French aviator Roland Garros and was also used on at least one Sopwith Tabloid of the Royal Naval Air Service.

A better solution was a &quot;gun synchronizer&quot;, which utilized a synchronization gear to shoot only at instants when the line of fire was unobstructed, developed by aircraft pioneer Anthony Fokker and fitted to the Fokker E.I monoplane in 1915. The first British &quot;tractor&quot; designed to be fitted with synchronization gear was the Sopwith 1½ Strutter. which entered service in early 1916.

The problem of firing through the propeller&#x27;s arc was avoided by passing the gun barrel through the propeller&#x27;s hub or spinner  – first used in production military aircraft with the 1917 French SPAD S.XII – or mounting guns in the wings, as was used from the early 1930s until propeller engines were superseded in the jet age.

<doc id="1028302" wikidata="Q7368975" url="?curid=1028302" title="Rosita (Sesame Street)">
<text>Rosita is a Muppet character on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Fluent in both American English and Mexican Spanish, she is the first regular bilingual Muppet on the show. Rosita comes from Mexico and likes to play the guitar.

==History==

Rosita was originally designed to look similar to a fruit bat and bore the name Rosita, La Monstrua de las Cuevas (&quot;the monster of the caves&quot;). Her wings were removed in 2004 (in the show&#x27;s 35th season), but reinstated in 2021 (in the show&#x27;s 52nd season). She wears a ribbon in her hair, but in deference to Zoe she only wears one instead of two.

Rosita was introduced to the series in 1991.

Rosita is performed by Carmen Osbahr, who originally worked on Mexico&#x27;s &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot;.

In July 2022, Sesame Place in Pennsylvania faced criticism after a family claimed in an Instagram post that the character snubbed their two young Black children by ignoring them as they waved to her. The video went viral as other users posted similar incidents of costumed characters and black children at the park, with those on social media calling for a boycott of the park. The park released a statement that the costume had made it difficult for the performer to see the girls. They later followed with another statement that the performer had not intentionally snubbed the girls, but instead rejected a request &quot;from someone in the crowd who asked Rosita to hold their child for a photo which is not permitted.&quot; On July 19, Sesame Place Pennsylvania formally apologized to the family and invited the family back for a personal meet-and-greet with the characters. They also announced that their employees will undergo racial bias training to ensure park guests have an &quot;inclusive, equitable and entertaining&quot; experience.

<doc id="1028303" wikidata="Q697071" url="?curid=1028303" title="Edgar Ende">
<text>Edgar Karl Alfons Ende (23 February 1901 – 27 December 1965) was a German surrealist painter and father of the children&#x27;s novelist Michael Ende.

Ende attended the Altona School of Arts and Crafts from 1916 to 1920. In 1922 he married Gertrude Strunck, but divorced four years later. He remarried in 1929, the same year his son Michael was born. In the 1930s Ende&#x27;s Surrealist paintings began to attract considerable critical attention, but were then condemned as degenerate by the Nazi government. Beginning in 1936 the Nazis forbade him to continue to paint or exhibit his work. In 1940 he was conscripted into the Luftwaffe as an operator of anti-aircraft artillery.

The majority of his paintings were destroyed by a bomb raid on Munich in 1944, making his surviving pre-war work extremely rare. In 1951, Ende met the recognized founder of Surrealism, André Breton, who admired his work and declared him an official Surrealist. He continued to paint surrealist works until his death in 1965 from a myocardial infarction.

Ende&#x27;s paintings are thought to have had a significant influence on his son&#x27;s writing. This is inferred in the scenes depicting the surreal dream-paintings from Yor&#x27;s Minroud in &quot;Die Unendliche Geschichte&quot; (&quot;The Neverending Story&quot;), and is made explicit in Michael Ende&#x27;s book &quot;Der Spiegel im Spiegel&quot; (&quot;The mirror in the mirror&quot;), a collection of short stories based on (and printed alongside) Edgar Ende&#x27;s surrealist works.

<doc id="1028314" wikidata="Q10853981" url="?curid=1028314" title="Penman equation">
<text>The Penman equation describes evaporation (&quot;E&quot;) from an open water surface, and was developed by Howard Penman in 1948. Penman&#x27;s equation requires daily mean temperature, wind speed, air pressure, and solar radiation to predict E. Simpler Hydrometeorological equations continue to be used where obtaining such data is impractical, to give comparable results within specific contexts, e.g. humid vs arid climates.

==Details==
Numerous variations of the Penman equation are used to estimate evaporation from water, and land. Specifically the Penman–Monteith equation refines weather based potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimates of vegetated land areas. It is widely regarded as one of the most accurate models, in terms of estimates.

The original equation was developed by Howard Penman at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, Harpenden, UK.

The equation for evaporation given by Penman is:
:formula_1
where:
:&quot;m&quot; = Slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve (Pa K−1)
:&quot;R&quot;n = Net irradiance (W m−2)
:&quot;ρ&quot;a = density of air (kg m−3)
:&quot;c&quot;p = heat capacity of air (J kg−1 K−1)
:δ&quot;e&quot; = vapor pressure deficit (Pa)
:&quot;g&quot;a = momentum surface aerodynamic conductance (m s−1)
:&quot;λ&quot;v = latent heat of vaporization (J kg−1)
:&quot;γ&quot; = psychrometric constant (Pa K−1)

which (if the SI units in parentheses are used) will give the evaporation &quot;E&quot;mass in units of kg/(m2·s), kilograms of water evaporated every second for each square meter of area.

Remove λ to obviate that this is fundamentally an energy balance. Replace &quot;λ&quot;v with L to get familiar precipitation units &quot;ET&quot;vol, where &quot;L&quot;v=&quot;λ&quot;v&quot;ρ&quot;water. This has units of m/s, or more commonly mm/day, because it is flux m3/s per m2=m/s.

This equation assumes a daily time step so that net heat exchange with the ground is insignificant, and a unit area surrounded by similar open water or vegetation so that net heat &amp; vapor exchange with the surrounding area cancels out. Some times people replace &quot;R&quot;n with and &quot;A&quot; for total net available energy when a situation warrants account of additional heat fluxes.

Temperature, wind speed, relative humidity impact the values of &quot;m&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;c&quot;p, &quot;ρ&quot;, and δ&quot;e&quot;.

==Shuttleworth (1993)==
In 1993, W.Jim Shuttleworth modified and adapted the Penman equation to use SI, which made calculating evaporation simpler. The resultant equation is:

:formula_2

where:
:&quot;E&quot;mass = Evaporation rate (mm day−1)
:&quot;m&quot; = Slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve (kPa K−1)
:&quot;R&quot;n = Net irradiance (MJ m−2 day−1)
:&quot;γ&quot; = psychrometric constant = formula_3 (kPa K−1)
:&quot;U&quot;2 = wind speed (m s−1)
:δ&quot;e&quot; = vapor pressure deficit (kPa)
:&quot;λ&quot;v = latent heat of vaporization (MJ kg−1)

==Some useful relationships==
:δ&quot;e&quot; = (es - ea) = (1 – relative humidity) es
:&quot;e&quot;s = saturated vapor pressure of air, as is found inside plant stoma.
:&quot;e&quot;a = vapor pressure of free flowing air.
:&quot;e&quot;s, mmHg = exp(21.07-5336/&quot;T&quot;a), approximation by Merva, 1975
Therefore formula_4, mmHg/K
:&quot;T&quot;a = air temperature in kelvins

He is most famous for applying the topological concept of retract, introduced by Karol Borsuk, to the study of the solutions of differential equations.

== Biography ==
Ważewski was born in Galicia on the 24 September 1896 to parents Stanisław Ważewski and Anieli Kozlowskich. He would attend schools in Mielec and Przemyśl before attending the Tarnow secondary school in 1914. Ważewski went to, originally, study physics at the Jagiellonian University (Krakow), but after being convinced by Stanisław Zaremba, he would change his degree to mathematics.

Zaremba helped Tadeusz get a scholarship to study at the University of Paris from 1921 to 1923 where he would continue the study of topology and set theory which Zaremba had influenced him to study. In 1924 he attained his Doctorate based on his thesis &quot;On Jordan curves containing no simple closed Jordan curve&quot; (French). Then in 1927 he was awarded the Habilitation at the Jagiellonian University on the basis of the thesis &quot;Rectifiable Continuums in Relation to Absolutely Continuous Functions and Mappings&quot; (Polish).

Two of his advisors were Émile Borel and Arnaud Denjoy at the University of Paris.

In the years after his Habilitation he continued to work at the Jagiellonian University but his focus had moved from topology to analysis. Ważewski was made a professor at the university in 1933.

During World War II Ważewski was taken to the Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg concentration camp where he would be kept until his release in February 1940. Once released he continued to teach in secret.

Ważewski worked as a full-time professor after the war at the Jagiellonian University in 1945. He was the head of the Department of Differential Equations for all of his life in the State Mathematical Institute. Ważewski was given a Doctor of Sciences (Mathematics) in 1953. After this he was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1967 from the university.

In 1923 he was inducted into the Polish Mathematical Society. Ważewski was made the president of the society for two years beginning on 1959 before becoming an honorary member in 1967. He also worked at the State Institute of Mathematics, which was incorporated into the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1952.

Tadeusz died in Rabka-Zdrój on 5 September 1972.

The Wigner semicircle distribution, named after the physicist Eugene Wigner, is the probability distribution defined on the domain [−&quot;R&quot;, &quot;R&quot;] whose probability density function &quot;f&quot; is a scaled semicircle, i.e. a semi-ellipse, centered at (0, 0):

:formula_11

for −&quot;R&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;R&quot;, and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0 if &quot;|x|&quot; &gt; &quot;R&quot;. The parameter R is commonly referred to as the &quot;radius&quot; parameter of the distribution.

The distribution arises as the limiting distribution of the eigenvalues of many random symmetric matrices, that is, as the dimensions of the random matrix approach infinity. The distribution of the spacing or gaps between eigenvalues is addressed by the similarly named Wigner surmise.

== General properties ==
Because of symmetry, all of the odd-order moments of the Wigner distribution are zero. For positive integers , the -th moment of this distribution is
:formula_12
In the typical special case that , this sequence coincides with the Catalan numbers 1, 2, 5, 14, etc. In particular, the second moment is and the fourth moment is , which shows that the excess kurtosis is . As can be calculated using the residue theorem, the Stieltjes transform of the Wigner distribution is given by
:formula_13
for complex numbers with positive imaginary part, where the complex square root is taken to have positive imaginary part.

The Wigner distribution coincides with a scaled and shifted beta distribution: if is a beta-distributed random variable with parameters , then the random variable exhibits a Wigner semicircle distribution with radius . By this transformation it is straightforward to directly compute some statistical quantities for the Wigner distribution in terms of those for the beta distributions, which are better known. 

The Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind are orthogonal polynomials with respect to the Wigner semicircle distribution of radius .

== Characteristic function and Moment generating function ==
The characteristic function of the Wigner distribution can be determined from that of the beta-variate :
:formula_14
where is the confluent hypergeometric function and is the Bessel function of the first kind. 

Likewise the moment generating function can be calculated as
:formula_15
where is the modified Bessel function of the first kind. The final equalities in both of the above lines are well-known identities relating the confluent hypergeometric function with the Bessel functions.

== Relation to free probability ==
In free probability theory, the role of Wigner&#x27;s semicircle distribution is analogous to that of the normal distribution in classical probability theory. Namely,
in free probability theory, the role of cumulants is occupied by &quot;free cumulants&quot;, whose relation to ordinary cumulants is simply that the role of the set of all partitions of a finite set in the theory of ordinary cumulants is replaced by the set of all noncrossing partitions of a finite set. Just as the cumulants of degree more than 2 of a probability distribution are all zero if and only if the distribution is normal, so also, the &quot;free&quot; cumulants of degree more than 2 of a probability distribution are all zero if and only if the distribution is Wigner&#x27;s semicircle distribution.

<doc id="1028334" wikidata="Q204737" url="?curid=1028334" title="Cambodian riel">
<text>The riel (; ; sign: ៛; code: KHR) is the currency of Cambodia. There have been two distinct riel, the first issued between 1953 and May 1975. Between 1975 and 1980, the country had no monetary system. A second currency, also named &quot;riel&quot;, has been issued since 20 March 1980. Since the late 1990s, the riel has had an unofficial fixed exchange rate of 4,100:1 with the United States dollar, Cambodia&#x27;s second &quot;de facto&quot; currency for commercial transactions.

Popular belief suggests that the name of the currency comes from the Mekong river fish &quot;riĕl&quot; (&quot;small fish&quot; in Khmer). It is more likely that it derives from the high-silver content Spanish-American dollar, whose value is eight &quot;reales&quot;, a coin widely used for international trade in Asia and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries.

==Concurrent use with foreign currencies==
In rural areas the riel is used for virtually all purchases, large and small. However, the United States dollar is also used, particularly in urban Cambodia and tourist areas. In areas near the Thai border, the Thai baht is also accepted.

Dollarization started in the 1980s and continued to the early 90s when the United Nations contributed humanitarian aid, refugees began sending remittances home, and inflation as high as 177% per year eroded confidence in the riel. From 1991–1993, the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia stationed 22,000 personnel throughout Cambodia, whose spending represented a large part of the Cambodian economy.

While the riel remains in common use in the provinces, the major cities and tourist areas heavily use the U.S. dollar. The latter is dispensed in ATMs, accepted in virtually all purchases, and USD quotations are required to price hotel rooms, airline tickets and significant financial transactions. Everyone knows the exchange rate of 4,000 KHR/US$ for retail trade, with riel paid out for change in fractions of a dollar.

In June 2020, the National Bank of Cambodia announced the phaseout from wide circulation of small U.S. dollar banknotes of $1, $2 and $5. This is aimed at reducing the cost of keeping the smaller US notes in circulation, as well as increasing the use of the riel in lieu of these notes. No fees were to be charged to collect these small notes before 31 August 2020, but after that date banks were expected to incur costs of transporting these notes.

==History==
===Cambodian tical===
Prior to the year 1875, the tical was the currency of Cambodia as well as Siam and Laos. However, as a result of French intervention in the region, the tical in Cambodia was replaced in 1875 by the Cambodian franc.

===Cambodian franc===
The franc was the currency of Cambodia between 1875 and 1885. It was equal to the French franc and was similarly subdivided into 100 centimes. It replaced the tical and was replaced by the piastre.

===French Indochinese piastre===
The piastre was introduced in French Indochina in 1885 at par with the Spanish-American silver dollar, and was in use until 1952.

===First riel (1953–1975)===
In 1953, the Cambodia branch of the Institut d&#x27;Émission des États du Cambodge, du Laos et du Viet-nam issued notes dual denominated in piastre and riel with the riel being at par with the piastre. At the same time, the two other branches of the &quot;Institut&quot; had similar arrangements with the đồng in South Vietnam and the kip in Laos. The piastre itself was derived from Spanish pieces of eight (pesos).

The riel was at first subdivided into 100 &quot;centimes&quot; (abbreviated to cent. on the coins) but this changed in 1959 to 100 &quot;sen&quot; (). For the first few years, the riel and piastre circulated alongside each other. The first riel banknotes were also denominated in piastres.
* First issue, 1955–56: 1 riel, 5 riels, 10 riels, 50 riels.
* Second issue, 1956: 1 riel, 20 riels, 50 riels, 100 riels, 500 riels.
* Third issue, 1956: 100 riels, 500 riels.
* Fourth issue, 1963: 5 riels, 10 riels, 100 riels.
* Fifth issue, 1972: 100 riels*, 500 riels, 1,000 riels*, 5,000 riels*. (* &quot;Unissued.&quot;)

Coins: The 10, 20 and 50 centimes of 1953 and sen coins were minted in aluminum and were the same size as the corresponding att and xu (su) coins of Laos and South Vietnam (though without the holes in the Lao coins). A 1 riel coin about the size of a U.S. nickel was to be issued in 1970, as part of the United Nations&#x27; Food and Agriculture Organization&#x27;s coin program, but was not released, perhaps due to the overthrow of the government of Norodom Sihanouk by Lon Nol.

===Khmer Rouge (1975–1980, 1993–1999)===

Although the Khmer Rouge printed banknotes, they were not issued as money was abolished after the Khmer Rouge took control of the country.
* Sixth issue, 1975: 0.1 riel (1 kak), 0.5 riels (5 kaks), 1 riel, 5 riels, 10 riels, 50 riels, 100 riels.

In 1993, they printed a series of coloured banknotes for limited use on territories controlled by them.
* Regional issue, 1993: 5 riels, 10 riels, 20 riels, 50 riels, 100 riels

==Second riel (1980–present)==
After the Vietnamese attacked Khmer Rouge in 1978, the riel was re-established as Cambodia&#x27;s national currency on 20 March 1980, initially at a value of 4 riels = 1 U.S. dollar. It is subdivided into 10 kaks (from the Hokkien &quot;kak&quot;) or 100 sens (from the French ). Because there was no money for it to replace and a severely disrupted economy, the central government gave away the new money to the populace in order to encourage its use. Near the same time, the United Nations gave humanitarian aid to Cambodia in U.S. dollars, and placed people in Cambodia to get it started, and the populace prefer the more stable U.S. dollar. As the supply of riels grew rapidly during the early 1990s, the riel devalued from 4 riels to 1 dollar in 1980 to a rate of around 4000 KHR/USD in the 2000s and around 4100 KHR/USD in the 2020s, where it has remained stable ever since.

* Seventh issue, 1979: 0.1 riel (1 kak), 0.2 riels (2 kaks), 0.5 riels (5 kaks), 1 riel, 5 riels, 10 riels, 20 riels, 50 riels.
* Eighth issue, 1987: 5 riels, 10 riels.
* Ninth issue, 1990–92: 50 riels, 100 riels, 500 riels.
* Tenth issue, 1992–93: 200 riels, 1,000 riels*, 2,000 riels*. (* &quot;Unissued.&quot;)
* Eleventh issue, 1995: 1,000 riels, 2,000 riels, 5,000 riels, 10,000 riels, 20,000 riels, 50,000 riels, 100,000 riels.
* Twelfth issue, 1995–99: 100 riels, 200 riels, 500 riels, 1,000 riels.
* Thirteenth issue, 2001–07: 50 riels, 100 riels, 500 riels, 1,000 riels, 2,000 riels, 5,000 riels, 10,000 riels, 50,000 riels.
* Fourteenth issue; 2008: 20,000 riels
* Fiftheeth issue; 2012–22: 100 riels, 200 riels, 500 riels, 1,000 riels, 2,000 riels, 5,000 riels, 10,000 riels, 20,000 riels, 50,000 riels, 100,000 riels.
* Commemorative issue; 2012-2024: 1,000 riels, 2,000 riels, 15,000 riels, 30,000 riels, 200,000 riels

===Banknotes===

* 100,000 riels (1995 and 2013-05-14)

===Coins===
The first coins were 5 sen pieces, minted in 1979 and made of aluminum. No more coins were minted until 1994, when denominations of 50, 100, 200 and 500 riels were introduced. However, these are rarely found in circulation.

<doc id="1028338" wikidata="Q2629013" url="?curid=1028338" title="Wassily Chair">
<text>The Wassily Chair, also known as the Model B3 chair, was designed by Marcel Breuer in 1925–1926 while he was the head of the cabinet-making workshop at the Bauhaus, in Dessau, Germany. 

Despite popular belief, the chair was not designed specifically for the non-objective painter Wassily Kandinsky, who was on the Bauhaus faculty at the same time. Kandinsky had admired the completed design, and Breuer fabricated a duplicate for Kandinsky&#x27;s personal quarters. The chair became known as &quot;Wassily&quot; decades later when it was re-released by Italian manufacturer Gavina which had learned of the anecdotal Kandinsky connection in the course of its research on the chair&#x27;s origins.

==History==
A champion of the modern movement and protégé of Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer is equally celebrated for his achievements in architecture and furniture. Breuer was an outstanding student and subsequently a master carpenter at the Bauhaus in the early 1920s. His entire body of work, both architecture and furniture, embodies the driving Bauhaus objective to reconcile art and industry. While at the Bauhaus, Breuer revolutionized the modern interior with his tubular-steel furniture collection – inspired by bicycle construction and fabricated using the techniques of local plumbers. His first designs, including the Wassily, remain among the most identifiable icons of the modern furniture movement.

The chair later known as the &quot;Wassily&quot; was first manufactured in the late 1920s by Thonet, the German-Austrian furniture manufacturer most known for its bent-wood chair designs, under the name Model B3. It was first available in both a folding and a non-folding version. In this early iteration, the straps were made of fabric, pulled taut on the reverse side with the use of springs.

The fabric used was made from &quot;Eisengarn&quot; (&#x27;iron yarn&#x27;), a strong, shiny, waxed-cotton thread. It had been invented in the 19th century, but Margaretha Reichardt (1907–1984), a student at the Bauhaus weaving workshop, experimented and improved the quality of the thread and developed cloth and strapping material for use on Breuer&#x27;s tubular-steel chairs. 

The Thonet produced version of the chair is most rare, and went out of production during World War II.

Most of Breuer&#x27;s early designs were produced under license by the Berlin-based manufacturer, Standard-Möbel, Lengyel &amp; Company. The Wassily chair was the only significant early Breuer design not offered by Standard-Möbel, Lengyel &amp; Co.

After the War years, Gavina picked up the license for the Wassily, along with the Breuer designs previously sold by Standard-Möbel, Lengyel &amp; Co., and introduced the more recognized Wassily version that replaced the fabric with black leather straps, though the fabric version was still made available. In 1968 Knoll bought the Gavina Group of Bologna. This brought all of Breuer&#x27;s design into the Knoll catalog.

This chair was revolutionary in the use of the materials (bent tubular steel and &quot;Eisengarn&quot;) and methods of manufacturing. In 1925 Breuer purchased his first bicycle and he was impressed with the lightness of its tubular steel frame. This inspired him to experiment with using the material in furniture design. The design (and all subsequent steel tubing furniture) was technologically feasible only because the German steel manufacturer Mannesmann had recently perfected a process for making seamless pipe. . Previously, steel tubing had a welded seam, which would collapse when the tubing was bent.

The Wassily chair, like many other designs of the modernist movement, has been mass-produced since the late 1920s, and continuously in production since the 1950s. A design classic is still available today. Though patent designs are expired, the trademark name rights to the design are owned by Knoll of New York City. Reproductions are produced around the world by other manufacturers, who market the product under many names.

<doc id="1028345" wikidata="Q896660" url="?curid=1028345" title="Stanisław Zaremba (mathematician)">
<text>Stanisław Zaremba (3 October 1863 – 23 November 1942) was a Polish mathematician and engineer. His research in partial differential equations, applied mathematics and classical analysis, particularly on harmonic functions, gained him a wide recognition. He was one of the mathematicians who contributed to the success of the Polish School of Mathematics through his teaching and organizational skills as well as through his research. Apart from his research works, Zaremba wrote many university textbooks and monographies.

He was a professor of the Jagiellonian University (since 1900), member of Academy of Learning (since 1903), co-founder and president of the Polish Mathematical Society (1919), and the first editor of the &quot;Annales de la Société Polonaise de Mathématique&quot;.

He should not be confused with his son Stanisław Krystyn Zaremba, also a mathematician.

==Biography==

Zaremba was born on 3 October 1863 in Romanówka, present-day Ukraine. The son of an engineer, he was educated at a grammar school in Saint Petersburg and studied at the Institute of Technology of the same city obtaining his diploma in engineering in 1886. The same year he left Saint Petersburg and went to Paris to study mathematics: he received his degree from the Sorbonne in 1889. He stayed in France until 1900, when he joined the faculty at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. His years in France enabled him to establish a strong bridge between Polish mathematicians and those in France.

He died on 23 November 1942 in Kraków, during the German occupation of Poland.

<doc id="1028348" wikidata="Q2478746" url="?curid=1028348" title="Eschar">
<text>An eschar (; ; ) is a slough or piece of dead tissue that is cast off from the surface of the skin, particularly after a burn injury, but also seen in gangrene, ulcer, fungal infections, necrotizing spider bite wounds, tick bites associated with spotted fevers and exposure to cutaneous anthrax. The term ‘eschar’ is not interchangeable with ‘scab’. An eschar contains necrotic tissue whereas a scab is composed of dried blood and exudate.

Black eschars are most frequently attributed in medicine to cutaneous anthrax (infection by &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;), which may be contracted through herd animal exposure and also from &quot;Pasteurella multocida&quot; exposure in cats and rabbits. A newly identified human rickettsial infection, &quot;R. parkeri&quot; rickettsiosis, can be differentiated from Rocky Mountain spotted fever by the presence of an eschar at the site of inoculation. 
Eschar is sometimes called a &quot;black wound&quot; because the wound is covered with thick, dry, black necrotic tissue.

Eschar may be allowed to slough off naturally, or it may require surgical removal (debridement) to prevent infection, especially in immunocompromised patients (e.g. if a skin graft is to be conducted).

If eschar is on a limb, it is important to assess peripheral pulses of the affected limb to make sure blood and lymphatic circulation is not compromised. If circulation is compromised, an escharotomy, or surgical incision through the eschar, may be indicated.

==Escharotic==
An &quot;escharotic&quot; is a substance that kills unwanted or diseased tissue, usually skin or superficial growths like warts, leaving them to slough off. Examples include:&lt;br&gt;
* inorganic reagents, such as strong acids and alkalis, or cytotoxic salts of heavy metals, for example zinc or silver
* organic compounds such as sanguinarine, salicylic acid, and certain medicines like imiquimod
* Irritant or corrosive fluids from plants, such as latex or resins from various species of &quot;Ficus&quot;, &quot;Euphorbia&quot;, &quot;Carica&quot;, or &quot;Taraxacum&quot;
* refrigerants, which kill the tissue by freezing; examples include liquid nitrogen, solid carbon dioxide, and its solution in ether 

Escharotics have long been used in medicine. In conventional modern practice some still are useful for topical treatment of growths such as warts. For lack of anything better in the past, escharotics once were more widely used, and for example, popular products included so-called black salves, with ingredients such as zinc chloride, plus sanguinarine in the form of bloodroot extract. These and others were traditional as topical treatments for localised skin cancers in herbal medicine. They combined unreliability in eradication of the cancer, with harmful effects such as scarring, serious injury, and disfigurement. Consequently escharotic salves now are strictly regulated in most western countries, and available on prescription only. Some prosecutions have been pursued over unlicensed sales of escharotic products such as Cansema.

<doc id="1028352" wikidata="Q1539986" url="?curid=1028352" title="Phellodendron">
<text>Phellodendron, or cork-tree, is a genus of deciduous, dioecious trees in the family Rutaceae, native to east and northeast Asia. It has leathery, pinnate leaves and yellow, clumped flowers. The name refers to the thick and corky bark of some (but not all) species in the genus.

==Fossil record==
&quot;Phellodendron&quot; seeds are known from the Early Oligocene of eastern North America, from the Mid Oligocene to the Pliocene of Europe and from the Pliocene of Asia and Japan.

One fossil seed of &quot;Phellodendron&quot; has been extracted from bore hole samples of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland.
Several &quot;Phellodendron&quot; macrofossils have been recovered from the late Zanclean stage of Pliocene sites in Pocapaglia, Italy.

==Cultivation and uses==
As an ornamental plant, &quot;Phellodendron&quot; is a tree for all seasons. In spring it has yellow flowers, in summer it provides foliage and shade, in fall the leaves turn bright yellow, and the textured bark and winding branches add interest in the winter. The female bears black drupes that attract birds and other wildlife through the late fall and winter.

The cork-tree is resistant to drought and insects, and it can thrive in a variety of soils. It is hardy to zone 4 and it is easy to maintain, sometimes to the point of being invasive. One drawback is that the drupes fall and scatter, which may be undesirable on a formal lawn.

The bark in some species is thick, resembling that of the cork oak, but is not thick enough for commercial cork production. It has been used to produce a yellow dye.
One species, &quot;Phellodendron amurense&quot; (Chinese: 黄柏; pinyin: huáng bǎi; or 黄檗; pinyin: huáng bò; Russian: Бархат амурский &quot;Barkhat Amurskiy&quot; (Amur Velvet), also бархатное дерево, пробковое дерево), is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine. Recently, &quot;Phellodendron&quot; has also attracted scientific attention because of the phytochemicals it produces:
* Berberine has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties
* Jatrorrhizine may be anti-mutagenic
* Phellodendrine has promise as an immune suppressant
* Palmatine may be a vasodilator

The phytochemical descriptions are included for informational purposes only and not for treatment purposes. The research at this stage is very preliminary. Traditionally, the bark is the principal part of the plant used medicinally, although oil from the fruit is also used. The species grows in Northern China, and in the Khabarovsk and Primorskiy regions of Russia.

Already identified as a significant forest invader in the mid-Atlantic region, &quot;Phellodendron amurense&quot; is an emerging species of concern in New England, and is identified as invasive or having invasive tendencies by state and private conservation authorities. Because the fruit is plentiful and high in sugars, Amur cork-tree attracts birds and mammals which help disperse its seeds. Because of its phytochemical profile and because the seedlings grow thickly, &quot;Phellodendron&quot; can out-compete other species. By suppressing reproduction of native hardwoods, Amur cork-tree can come to dominate native forests under favorable conditions. As a relatively new species of concern, its invasion biology and response to control are not well understood.

<text>Zina Lynna Garrison (born November 16, 1963) is an American former professional tennis player. Garrison was the runner-up in singles at the 1990 Wimbledon Championships, a three-time major mixed doubles champion, and an Olympic gold and bronze medalist from the women&#x27;s doubles and singles events, respectively, at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. She reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 4, on 20 November 1989.

==Career==
The youngest of seven children, Garrison started playing tennis at the age of 10 and entered her first tournament at the age of 12. At 14, she won the national girls&#x27; 18s title. In 1981, she won both the Wimbledon and US Open junior titles and was ranked the world No. 1 junior player. Garrison graduated from Sterling High School in Houston, Texas in 1982.

Garrison began suffering from the eating disorder bulimia when she was 19, following the death of her mother. &quot;I had never been comfortable with my looks and felt I had lost the only person who loved me unconditionally&quot;, Garrison told the &quot;Observer Sport Monthly&quot; in 2006. &quot;The pressure of being labeled &#x27;the next Althea Gibson&#x27; only made things worse. I felt I was never going to be allowed to grow into just becoming me.&quot;

Garrison turned professional in 1982, and skipped her graduation at Ross Sterling High School to compete in the French Open, her first tournament as a professional, where she reached the quarterfinals. She was awarded the WTA Newcomer of the Year in 1982.

Despite battling bulimia during her first few years on the tour, Garrison enjoyed notable success on-court. She reached the Australian Open semifinals in 1983, her first full year on the tour, and finished the year ranked world No. 10. She won her first top-level singles titles in 1984 at the European Indoor Championships in Zürich. In 1985, Garrison beat world no. 3 Hana Mandlíková and world no. 2 Chris Evert on her way to winning the Amelia Island Championships. She was also a Wimbledon semifinalist in 1985, and in 1986, she won her first tour doubles at the Canadian Open (partnering Gabriela Sabatini).

At the Australian Open in 1987, Garrison won the mixed doubles (partnering Sherwood Stewart) and finished runner-up in the women&#x27;s doubles (partnering Lori McNeil). A year later, Garrison and Stewart captured the mixed doubles title at Wimbledon.

At the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Garrison teamed with Pam Shriver to win the women&#x27;s doubles gold medal for the United States, defeating Jana Novotná and Helena Suková of Czechoslovakia in the final. Garrison defeated Shriver in the quarterfinals of the singles event, where she won a bronze medal. At the US Open, she defeated defending champion Navratilova for the first time in her career, advancing to the semifinals, where she lost to Sabatini.

In 1989, Garrison defeated Chris Evert 7–6, 6–2 in the quarterfinals of the US Open in Evert&#x27;s final tournament. Garrison lost to Navratilova in the semifinals. She finished 1989 ranked at career-high No. 4 in singles.

The highlight of Garrison&#x27;s career came in 1990 at Wimbledon, as she defeated Samantha Smith, Cecilia Dahlman, Andrea Leand, Helena Suková, then French Open champion Monica Seles in the quarterfinals 3–6, 6–3, 9–7, and defending Wimbledon champion and world No. 1, Steffi Graf, in the semifinals 6–3, 3–6, 6–4 to reach her only Grand Slam singles final, becoming the first African-American woman to do so since Gibson. Moreover, it ended Graf&#x27;s record 13-time streak of Grand Slam finals. Then, she lost to Navratilova 4–6, 1–6, who thus won her record ninth women&#x27;s singles title at Wimbledon. Garrison claimed her third mixed-doubles title at Wimbledon that year (partnering Rick Leach).

In 1992, Garrison finished runner-up in the Australian Open women&#x27;s doubles (partnering Mary Joe Fernández).

At Wimbledon in 1994, Garrison beat world No. 2 Arantxa Sánchez Vicario on the way to her 15th and final Grand Slam quarterfinal appearance.

Garrison retired from professional tennis in 1996. From 1982 to 1995, she remained uninterrupted in the world&#x27;s top 25. During her career, she won 14 top-level singles titles and 20 doubles titles.

==Personal life and post-tennis career==
Garrison married Willard Jackson in September 1989; however, the marriage ended in divorce in 1997.

Since retiring from the tour, Garrison has worked as a television commentator and maintained active roles in the community and in tennis. She founded the Zina Garrison Foundation for the Homeless in 1988, and the Zina Garrison All-Court Tennis Program, which supports inner-city tennis in Houston, in 1992. She has also served as a member of the United States President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. She is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

Garrison has maintained a presence on the professional tennis scene, and was the captain for the U.S. Federation Cup (later Fed Cup) team. Garrison also led the U.S. women&#x27;s team at the 2008 Beijing Games tennis event where team members Venus and Serena Williams won a gold medal in doubles.

After &quot;piling on weight&quot; in her 40s, Garrison participated in season 16 of the reality TV competition &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;, titled &quot;The Biggest Loser: Glory Days&quot;, which premiered September 11, 2014 on NBC. Despite losing 8 lbs., she was the first person eliminated from the program.

==Playing style==
Garrison played an attacking style. It was common for her to slice her backhand and attack the net (a chip-and-charge tactic). Garrison had excellent volleys and overheads. She was able to rally when she wanted to but her main game plan was to get to the net so she could finish with the volley.

<text>Nathalie Tauziat (born 17 October 1967) is a French former professional tennis player and coach. She was the runner-up in women&#x27;s singles at the 1998 Wimbledon Championships and runner-up in the women&#x27;s doubles at the 2001 US Open partnering Kimberly Po-Messerli. She reached a career-high ranking of world No. 3 in both singles and doubles.

She previously coached Canadian tennis player Bianca Andreescu and compatriot Harmony Tan.

==Early life==
Tauziat was born in Bangui, Central African Republic, where she lived for the first eight years of her life. She is a first cousin of Didier Deschamps, former captain and current manager of the French football team. About a week after Tauziat reached the Wimbledon final on 4 July 1998, Deschamps led France to win the World Cup on 12 July 1998.

==Career==
Tauziat turned professional in 1984. She won her first singles title in 1990. She reached her only Grand Slam singles final at the 1998 Wimbledon Championships, beating Haruka Inoue, Iva Majoli, Julie Halard-Decugis, Samantha Smith, Lindsay Davenport and Natasha Zvereva before losing to Jana Novotná. Her appearance in this final was the first by a Frenchwoman since Suzanne Lenglen in 1925.

Tauziat was runner-up with partner Kimberly Po in the 2001 US Open women&#x27;s doubles final, losing to the team of Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. She and partner Alexandra Fusai were doubles runners-up at the 1997 and 1998 Chase Championships. She was also part of the 1997 French Fed Cup team, which won its first title in the history of the competition.

Tauziat reached her career-high singles ranking of world No. 3 at the age of 32 years and 6 months in the spring of 2000, making her the oldest woman to debut in the top three and the fourth oldest to be ranked in the top three. She retired from the WTA Tour after the 2003 French Open, after having played only doubles in 2002 and 2003. Tauziat won 8 singles titles and 25 doubles titles on the WTA Tour in her career.

She wrote a book with the title &quot;Les Dessous du tennis féminin&quot; (published in 2001 in French) in which she gave her insights about life on the women&#x27;s professional tennis circuit. In 2004 Tauziat received a state honour – le chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur – from French President Jacques Chirac for her contributions to international tennis. She was an official WTA Tour mentor to French tennis player Marion Bartoli, beginning in 2003.

<doc id="1028368" wikidata="Q6517338" url="?curid=1028368" title="Titirangi">
<text>Titirangi is a suburb of West Auckland in the Waitākere Ranges local board area of the city of Auckland in northern New Zealand. It is an affluent, residential suburb located to the southwest of the Auckland city centre, at the southern end of the Waitākere Ranges. In the Māori language &quot;Titirangi&quot; means &quot;hill reaching up to the sky&quot;.

==Geography==

Titirangi is bordered to the south by Manukau Harbour, to the west and north west by the rest of the Waitākere Ranges&#x27; native bush clad hills consisting of the large Centennial Memorial Park and water catchment areas which supply much of Auckland&#x27;s water. The main road into the Waitākeres, Scenic Drive, begins in Titirangi. To the east and north are a number of more urban suburbs.

The Waitākere Ranges lie on the west coast of the North Island in the path of the prevailing winds from the Tasman and consequently attract a high rainfall. The native bush is home to many native birds, such as the fantail, tūī, kererū or &quot;wood pigeon&quot;, morepork and white-eye, and geckos and rare native frogs. The landscape of Titirangi ranges from Titirangi Beach on the Manukau Harbour to 400 metre (1300&#x27;) high parts of the Waitākere Ranges.

Mt Atkinson is in the foothills of Titirangi, not far from the village centre. In the early 20th century, this was known as Bishop&#x27;s Hill. There is a short scenic walk, with expansive views of Titirangi Village and the Manukau and Waitemata harbours. There is also &#x27;Zig Zag Track&#x27; walk, which winds its way through native bush from the village centre to Titirangi Beach. Exhibition Drive, a well-formed track very popular with walkers, joggers and cyclists, is located from the village centre.

==History==

The area is within the traditional rohe of Te Kawerau ā Maki, an iwi that traces their ancestry to some of the earliest inhabitants of the Auckland Region. The name was chosen for the area by Rakataura, the senior tohunga of the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory canoe. It was used to describe the area between the Motukaraka sandbank of the Manukau Harbour and Little Muddy Creek, and was named in commemoration of a hill in his Pacific homeland, and can be translated as &quot;hill reaching up to the sky&quot;. Other translations of the name include &quot;long streaks of cloud in the sky&quot; and &quot;fringe of heaven&quot;.

In the mid-19th century, the Manukau Harbour shoreline was primarily used for kauri logging. In December 1855, John Bishop and Thomas Canty acquired 227 acres of land from John Langford, a land dealer who acquired the area from a Crown grant. Most of the kauri forest was harvested for wood by the early settlers.

The first landowner at Titirangi was John Kelly, who bought in 1848. Most of Titirangi and the surrounding area developed as farmland in the 1860s. For communities in the south of Titirangi, most contact to the outside world was through docks along the Manukau Harbour, which linked the settlements to the port of Onehunga. In 1902 at the suggestion of local engineer Henry Atkinson, the wooden precursor to the Upper Nihotupu Dam was constructed, to supply Auckland with a more constant water supply. Atkinson donated land at Titirangi for the project, which involved piping water from the dam to Titirangi, and then on to Auckland City. The dam finished construction in 1923.

Titirangi remained primarily farmland until the advent of World War I, when the number of farm workers in the area plummeted and native plants began to recolonise the area. The Titirangi township greatly developed in the 1910s, because of a need for the laborers working on Scenic Drive (then known as Exhibition Drive) to have lodgings. Exhibition Drive opened on 24 January 1914. In the early 20th century, Wood Bay, French Bay and other Manukau Harbour beaches became popular destinations for Aucklanders.

In 1930, the Hotel Titirangi (now known as Lopdell House) was established as a modern hotel, however the hotel faced difficulties securing a liquor license due to the prohibition of alcohol in West Auckland, and closed less than six months later.

As road access improved in the 1960s, the community became increasingly suburban. Artist Colin McCahon lived at Otitori Bay in Titirangi in the 1950s, during which he painted a number of artworks inspired by the Titirangi landscape. McCahon House is an artists residency. Artists include Tanu Gogo Emily Karaka, Cora-Allan Wickliffe, Judy Millar, Luise Fong, Eve Armstrong, Lisa Reihana and Ava Seymour.

==Culture==
Titirangi is characterised by houses built within the native bush of the Waitākere Ranges, sometimes with views of the Manukau Harbour. Some of the residential properties are of unusual design. For instance, some houses were raised on poles so that they could be built in the bush without harming the roots of trees surrounding the house.

The name &quot;Titirangi&quot; is often linked with Titirangi Golf Course. The course is actually located on the border of the nearby suburbs of New Lynn and Green Bay. Other areas surrounding Titirangi include Oratia, Nihotupu, Glen Eden, Woodlands Park, Laingholm and Waiatarua.

For a long time the area had a reputation for bohemianism. A number of well known New Zealand musicians, artists, writers and potters currently live or have lived in the area, including singer/songwriter Tim Finn (who wrote the song &quot;I Hope I Never&quot; there), actress Alma Evans-Freake, author Maurice Shadbolt, feminist artist Alexis Hunter, photographers Brian Brake and David Prentice, poet John Caselberg, potter Len Castle and glass artist Ann Robinson. The former house of painter Colin McCahon has been preserved as a museum and residence for artists and writers since 1998.

The sculpture on the round-about connecting Titirangi Road, Atkinson Road, Kohu Road, Scenic Drive and Huia Rd has been a symbol of Titirangi for many years, although it is a controversial presence. Designed by student artist-jeweller Lisa Higgins in 1993, it was originally erected with the intention of only being in place for five years but has remained permanently. This was part of a Waitakere City Council programme of involving artists in public developments. Its original pink colour was toned down to a teal green in 2009.

An active local theatre, cinema, community art gallery and radio station are based in historic Lopdell House. Located next door, Te Uru Waitakere Contemporary Gallery is West Auckland&#x27;s regional art gallery. Many short walks or tramps in the Waitakeres start from Titirangi.

<doc id="1028380" wikidata="Q259324" url="?curid=1028380" title="Olga Morozova">
<text>Olga Vasilyevna Morozova (; born 22 February 1949) is a Russian former professional tennis player. Competing for the Soviet Union, she was the runner-up in women&#x27;s singles at the 1974 French Open and 1974 Wimbledon Championships, and the first Soviet player to win a major, in women&#x27;s doubles at the 1974 French Open. Her ground-breaking playing career, combined with her distinguished coaching career, has led to Morozova being labelled the &quot;Godmother of Russian tennis&quot;.

==Career==
Morozova started playing tennis at the age of 10, with Nina Teplyakova as her first and career-long coach. By 16, Morozova had improved so quickly that she was invited to represent the USSR at Wimbledon in the girls singles.

Travelling internationally for the first time and playing on grass for the first time, Morozova won the 1965 Wimbledon Junior Girls&#x27; singles title.

Morozova would go on to become the first Soviet tennis player, male or female, to reach the singles final of any major tournament when she was the runner-up at the 1972 Italian Open. However, the peak of Morozova&#x27;s career came during the summer of 1974 when she was the women&#x27;s singles runner-up at both Wimbledon and the French Open, losing to Chris Evert on both occasions. At Wimbledon she shocked the defending champion Billie Jean King in straight sets in the quarters, and then came back from a set down against Virginia Wade to win the semi-final 6–4 in the third. She rose to No. 3 in the world going into the US Open that year – the highest ranking she achieved in her career.

Morozova became the first Soviet tennis player, male or female, to win a Grand Slam title when she teamed with Evert to win the women&#x27;s doubles championship at the French Open in 1974. She was the first Soviet player to lead her team to the Federation Cup semifinals in 1978 (and again in 1979). She and Alex Metreveli were the first USSR players to reach a Grand Slam final when they teamed at Wimbledon in 1968, losing to Margaret Court and Ken Fletcher. In addition to winning the French Open doubles in 1974, Morozova was the runner-up at the 1975 Australian Open (teaming with Margaret Court), the 1975 French Open (teaming with Julie Anthony) and the 1976 US Open (teaming with Virginia Wade).

Morozova&#x27;s playing career was cut short in 1977 because of the USSR&#x27;s policy against allowing their athletes to compete with South Africans. At this point, she retired early from the professional tour. Morozova then began a coaching career. She became head coach of the Soviet Union ladies squad through the 1980s leading the Soviets to their first appearance in a Federation Cup Final (1988, losing to Czechoslovakia). Morozova also helped pioneer the creation of the Kremlin Cup.

In 1990, the LTA hired Morozova as head of girls tennis, based at the national performance centre in Bisham Abbey, UK. Morozova became a fixture in UK tennis for much of the 1990s. In December 1996, in a Russian interview, she noted a key difference in the approach to sport between the UK and Russia: &quot;For them [the English], participation is considered more important than winning. They fancy Coubertin a lot. For us, Russians, it is still important to win&quot;.

In 2003, Morozova began working individually with notable players, including amongst others Elena Dementieva, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Sergiy Stakhovsky, Laura Robson and more recently Harriet Dart. Morozova has been widely credited as one of the few female coaches to work at the very highest levels of the tour.

In 1998, she was awarded the Sarah Palfrey Danzig Trophy for character, sportsmanship, manners, spirit of cooperation, and contribution to the growth of the game as well as the help she rendered to professional players and junior players.

In 2000, the Russian Tennis Federation awarded Morozova the honour of Russian Tennis Player of the Twentieth Century. 

Morozova&#x27;s husband is Viktor Roubanov (1971 champion of Moscow in singles), and he also was one of the first coaches of Anna Kournikova. He also coached Shirli-Ann Siddall during her first breakthrough — winning a match in the Wimbledon main draw — period.

<doc id="1028388" wikidata="Q413779" url="?curid=1028388" title="Nitrosamine">
<text>Nitrosamines (or more formally &quot;N&quot;-nitrosamines) are organic compounds produced by industrial processes. The chemical structure is , where R is usually an alkyl group. Nitrosamines have a nitroso group () that are &quot;probable human carcinogens&quot;, bonded to a deprotonated amine. Most nitrosamines are carcinogenic in animals. A 2006 systematic review supports a &quot;positive association between nitrite and nitrosamine intake and gastric cancer, between meat and processed meat intake and gastric cancer and oesophageal cancer, and between preserved fish, vegetable and smoked food intake and gastric cancer, but is not conclusive&quot;.

==Chemistry==

The organic chemistry of nitrosamines is well developed with regard to their syntheses, their structures, and their reactions. They usually are produced by the reaction of nitrous acid () and secondary amines, although other nitrosyl sources (e.g. , , RONO) have the same effect:
The nitrous acid usually arises from protonation of a nitrite. This synthesis method is relevant to the generation of nitrosamines under some biological conditions. The nitrosation is also reversible, particularly in acidic solutions of nucleophiles. Aryl nitrosamines rearrange to give a &quot;para&quot;-nitroso aryl amine in the Fischer-Hepp rearrangement. 

With regards to structure, the core of nitrosamines is planar, as established by X-ray crystallography. The N-N and N-O distances are 132 and 126 pm, respectively in dimethylnitrosamine, one of the simplest members of a large class of N-nitrosamines.

Nitrosamines are not directly carcinogenic. Metabolic activation is required to convert them to the alkylating agents that modify bases in DNA, inducing mutations. The specific alkylating agents vary with the nitrosamine, but all are proposed to feature alkyldiazonium centers.

==History and occurrence==
In 1956, two British scientists, John Barnes and Peter Magee, reported that a simple member of the large class of N-nitrosamines, dimethylnitrosamine, produced liver tumours in rats. Subsequent studies showed that approximately 90% of the 300 nitrosamines tested were carcinogenic in a wide variety of animals.

===Tobacco exposure===
A common way ordinary consumers are exposed to nitrosamines is through tobacco use and cigarette smoke. Tobacco-specific nitrosamines also can be found in American dip snuff, chewing tobacco, and to a much lesser degree, snus (127.9 ppm for American dip snuff compared to 2.8 ppm in Swedish snuff or snus).

===Dietary exposure===
=== Medication impurities ===
There have been recalls for various medications due to the presence of nitrosamine impurities. There have been recalls for angiotensin II receptor blockers, ranitidine, valsartan, duloxetine, and others.

The US Food and Drug Administration published guidance about the control of nitrosamine impurities in medicines. Health Canada published guidance about nitrosamine impurities in medications and a list of established acceptable intake limits of nitrosamine impurities in medications.

<text>Jean Redpath MBE (28 April 1937 – 21 August 2014) was a Scottish folk singer.

==Career==
Jean Redpath was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, to musical parents. Her mother knew many Scots songs and passed them on to Jean and her brother, and her father played the hammered dulcimer. She was raised in Leven, Fife, Scotland, and later returned to Edinburgh, taking medieval studies at the University of Edinburgh. To help pay her way through her studies, she sang for beer money and undertook part-time work as a driving instructor and undertaker&#x27;s assistant.

The Scottish poet and folk-song collector Hamish Henderson was working in the School of Scottish Studies at the university and Redpath took a keen interest in the archive of tapes and discs of music and songs. She learned about 400 songs, together with the oral folklore that went with them. In March 1961, at the age of 24, she arrived in the United States with just eleven dollars in her pocket. Her first performance was in San Francisco. Later she met up with Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott and Bob Dylan in Greenwich Village. The natural warmth and power of her voice brought her to perform at Gerde&#x27;s Folk City. In 1963, following a concert performance, she signed with Elektra Records. In 1975, she switched to the Philo label. From 1972 to 1976, Redpath was artist-in-residence at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. She lectured in folklore and acted as cultural resource in the local school system.

In 1976, Redpath embarked on a project to record all the songs of Robert Burns, some being folk songs, some Burns&#x27;s own compositions, and most a mixture of the two. Twenty-two volumes were planned, but when her collaborator, the composer Serge Hovey, died after seven volumes, the project came to a premature end. Hovey had done the instrumental arrangements for 323 songs, and Redpath felt no other musician could replace him. The albums won critical praise from around the world. In 1986, she recorded &quot;Lady Nairne&quot;, a collection of songs written by Scottish women. Redpath sensitively reconstructed songs that might otherwise have been lost. Between 1974 and 1987, Redpath appeared regularly on Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; APM radio show. She also appeared on Robert J. Lurtsema&#x27;s &quot;Morning pro musica&quot; broadcast from WGBH in Boston.

Redpath toured throughout the U.S. and Canada, played venues in South America, Hong Kong, and Australia, including the Sydney Opera House, and performed often at the Edinburgh Folk Festival. In 1977, Royal Jubilee Year, Redpath appeared at a royal banquet at Edinburgh Castle for Queen Elizabeth II.

Starting in 1979, Redpath was a lecturer at the University of Stirling, Scotland, with occasional trips to teach at Wesleyan University. She gave courses for ten years in Scottish Song at the Heritage of Scotland Summer School at the University of Stirling.

She was awarded the MBE in 1987, as well as being named a Kentucky colonel by the Governor of Kentucky. Redpath also received honorary doctorates from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, University of Stirling and the University of St Andrews, and was inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame in 2008. A portrait of Redpath by Alexander Fraser hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. In 1996, she launched the Burns International Festival.

In 2009, Redpath made an appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, singing &quot;Some Kind of Love&quot; by the late John Stewart of The Kingston Trio. Letterman promoted her album &quot;By Request&quot; during her appearance, although the song &quot;Some Kind of Love&quot; does not appear on that album. This led to some confusion for viewers who wished to obtain a recorded version of the song.

In 2011, she returned to her alma mater to become artist-in-residence at the University of Edinburgh’s Department of Celtic and Scottish Studies. She kept her links to Scotland, owning a house in Elie during her life.

==Death and legacy==
Redpath died from cancer on 21 August 2014 at a hospice in Tucson, Arizona.

In the town where Redpath was raised, Leven in Fife, there is a street named in her honour: Jean Redpath Wynd.

<doc id="1028394" wikidata="Q1373679" url="?curid=1028394" title="Kazimierz Żorawski">
<text>Paulin Kazimierz Stefan Żorawski (June 22, 1866 – January 23, 1953) was a Polish mathematician. Żorawski&#x27;s main interests were invariants of differential forms, integral invariants of Lie groups, differential geometry and fluid mechanics. His work in these disciplines was to prove important in other fields of mathematics and science, such as differential equations, geometry and physics (especially astrophysics and cosmology).

==Biography==
Kazimierz Żorawski was born in Szczurzyn near Ciechanów, in the Russian Empire, now in Poland, to Juliusz Bronisław Wiktor Żórawski and Kazimiera Żórawska. In 1884 he completed secondary school in Warsaw. From 1884 to 1888 he studied mathematics at the University of Warsaw. In 1889 he was selected to continue his mathematics studies on the strength of a paper on observations that he had made at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory.

In the years that followed he studied the theory of conversion groups and analytical mechanics in Leipzig, and differential equations in Göttingen. In 1891 he was awarded a PhD (under M. Sophius Lie) in Leipzig for his thesis on the applications of group conversion theory to differential geometry. In 1892 he became a lecturer at the Polytechnic Higher School of Lwów where he taught mathematics and, in 1893, assumed the Chair of Mechanical Science.

In 1893, Żorawski received a doctorate in mathematics from Jagiellonian University in Kraków, and in 1895 he traveled to Berlin to study higher level geodesy. He later returned to Kraków where, he was named assistant professor and, in 1898, full professor of mathematics at Jagiellonian where he taught higher analysis, geometry (analytic, differential and projective), theory of algebraic curves and theory of singularities. In 1900 he was elected a member of the Academy of Learning (from 1919 Polish Academy of Learning) in Kraków.

In 1905, Żorawski became a Dean of the Faculty of philosophy at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, and in 1910, he became an associate member of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague. In 1911, he became a president of the Societies of the Scientific Committee. Two years later he took part in the Organizational Committee of Academy of Maining in Kraków. From 1917 to 1918, he was a rector and from 1918 to 1919 vice-rector of the Jagiellonian University

In 1919, Żorawski settled in Warsaw where he became a full professor in mathematics at the Warsaw University of Technology, while at the same time teaching courses on the application of geometric analysis at the University of Warsaw. That same year he became a member of the Polish Society of Mathematics.
In 1920, Żorawski was elected to the Warsaw Society of Science and Letters, and from 1926 to 1931, served as its president. To honor his services, the Society struck a commemorative medal (see picture) in 1931. At the same time, he became an active member of the Warsaw Technical Academy of Science, and in 1926, a full professor of mathematics at the University of Warsaw. He was a Polish delegate for the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation which was formally established in January 1922 (Marie Curie was a prominent member of this organization).

Żorawski announced his retirement in 1935 after 46 years devoted to professorship. Upon his retirement, the University of Warsaw conferred upon him the title of Professor Emeritus in mathematics and natural science.

Both before World War II and during the Nazi occupation of Poland, Professor Żorawski worked on analytical geometry, primarily in the area of first- and second-degree plane figures and differential properties of real andicomplex plane figures. His work was three-quarters completed when the Warsaw Uprising occurred. Żorawski, like tens of thousands of Warsaw residents, was expelled from the capital and sent to Pruszków. His apartment, which contained all of his property, including many of his scientific papers, was destroyed by fire.

Upon his release from the camp of Pruszków along with a group of other scientists, Zorawski took refuge in Nieborów, staying at the home of the Radziwill family. After the Red Army occupied Poland, Żorawski returned to a destroyed Warsaw and lived for a time with his daughter Leokadia Paprocka. Shortly thereafter, the Ministry for Education gave him a small bedroom with a kitchen at the Students House at the Narutowicz Square in Warsaw, one of the few buildings not destroyed by the Germans during the war. There he rewrote the nearly two-thirds (2650 pages) of his work that had been destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising.

In 1952, Żorawski was named a full member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. He was also decorated with the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta and the Gold Cross of Merit.

Żorawski died in 1953.

After his death, the importance of his work to the development of Polish mathematics was recognized by many scientists. A telegram addressed to his family by Bronisław Knaster, Edward Marczewski, Hugo Steinhaus, and Władysław Ślebodziński expressed this recognition: &quot;[W]e wish to express to the family of Professor Kazimierz Żorawski our deep compassion. He was the first of the scientists of his generation to bring the name of Poland to the forefront of world mathematics.&quot;

==Accomplishments==

Kazimierz Żorawski dealt with a particularly difficult field of mathematics – continuous invariants of Lie groups, and the results of his work have been applied to other fields of mathematics and science, especially differential equations, geometry and physics.

The seventy scientific works of Professor Żorawski relate mainly to analytical geometry, differential geometry, Lie groups, differential equations, kinematics of continuous symmetry, and non-Euclidean complex geometry.

===Kraków School of Mathematics===

At the turn of the 20th century, groups of mathematicians worked in the Polish scientific centers of Lwów, Kraków and Warsaw and created the &quot;mathematical Schools&quot; of Warsaw, Lwów and Kraków. Kazimierz Żorawski, along with Stanisław Zaremba, (both faculty members of Jagiellonian University) was a cofounder of the Kraków School of Mathematics, to which professors Franciszek Leja, Władysław Ślebodziński and Tadeusz Ważewski also belonged. Thus, Jagiellonian became the center of traditional analysis of differential equations and analytical functions.

===Polish Mathematical Society===

On April 2, 1919, Żorawski chaired the inaugural meeting, in Kraków, of the Mathematical Society, which soon changed its name to the Polish Mathematical Society. Żorawski is considered one of the key founders of this Society.

===Development of Polish mathematics===

In 1958, Polish Mathematical Society member Władysław Ślebodziński recalled the importance of the role played by Stanisław Zaremba and Kazimierz Żorawski in the development of Polish mathematics:
===Lie groups===

Żorawski was a student of eminent Norwegian professor Sophus Lie, the author of the theory of continuous groups (Lie groups). Żorawski developed several areas close to the theory of Lie groups and other theories which were based upon it—in particular the theories of differential equations and differential geometry, as well as topics from the theory of integral invariants (new at that time), and selected problems of kinematics.

While a professor in Leipzig, Lie wrote the following regarding Żorawski&#x27;s work devoted to Lie groups: 
==Personal life==

In 1863, Żorawski&#x27;s mother, Kazimiera, took part in the January Uprising against the Russian Empire. This uprising started as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Russian Army and was soon joined by politicians and high ranking Polish officers from the tsarist army. While the uprising failed militarily, it succeeded in blunting the effect of the Tsar&#x27;s abolition of serfdom in the Russian partition. Kazimiera was captured and imprisoned by the Russian authorities, and her father was imprisoned in the citadel at Warsaw, where he later died.

Żorawski had five siblings, one of whom, Stanislaw, became proprietor of the Obrebiec Estate, near Przasnysz. In 1940, his property was seized by the Nazis and Stanislaw was arrested and interned at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, where he died.

Żorawski fell in love with the family governess, Maria Skłodowska (later better known as Marie Curie), whose father was a relative of the Żorawskis. The two discussed marriage, but Żorawski&#x27;s parents rejected Maria due to her family&#x27;s poverty. Nevertheless, their hopes of marriage continued until 1891, when a dispirited Maria moved to Warsaw and then to Paris, where she eventually married Pierre Curie and earned two Nobel Prizes.

Żorawski married Leokadia Jewniewicz, a pianist. Her father, Hipolit, was a professor at the Institute of Technology in St. Petersburg, specializing in applied mathematics. One of his works, &quot;The Theory of Elasticity&quot;, was published posthumously in Warsaw in 1910.

Żorawski and his wife had three children: Juliusz, Leokadia, and Maria. Juliusz became an architect, often compared with Le Corbusier; after World War II he was a professor of architecture at the Kraków Polytechnic.

<text>Papatoetoe is a suburb in Auckland, New Zealand. It is the largest suburb in Auckland by population and is located to the northwest of Manukau Central, and 18 kilometres southeast of Auckland CBD.

Papatoetoe was traditionally an important area for Tāmaki Māori, who used a waka portage between the Tāmaki River and Waokauri Creek to reach the Manukau Harbour, as an alternative to the Ōtāhuhu portage to the north. The area developed as a farming community in the 19th century, and grew significantly in the 1950s and 1960s after the Auckland Southern Motorway was constructed. Papatoetoe is now known for its significant population of Indian New Zealanders.

==Etymology==

Papatoetoe means &quot;grounds where toetoe grows&quot;, referring to species of &quot;Austroderia&quot; grasses that traditionally grew in the area. The name Papatoetoe was first used by English settlers from the 1850s onwards. The spelling Papatoitoi was common in English in the 19th century, and was gradually replaced with Papatoetoe after the local post office began using this spelling.

==Geology==
Papatoetoe is low-lying flat area in South Auckland, located south of the Auckland isthmus and east of the Māngere peninsula. Some features of the Auckland volcanic field can be found around Papatoetoe, including Kohuora, a tuff ring that erupted an estimated 34,000 years ago, becoming a wetland after the crater gradually filled with water and sediment, and Crater Hill, which erupted an estimated 30,000 years ago. The low-lying volcanic features of South Auckland were collectively known by the name Nga Tapuwae a Mataoho (&quot;The Sacred Footprints of Mataoho&quot;) to Tāmaki Māori peoples, referring to the deity who was involved in their creation.

Papatoetoe is a flat area between the catchments of the Manukau Harbour in the west and the Tāmaki River to the north-east. Major waterways in the area include the Waokauri Creek, the Puhinui Creek to the south, and the north-flowing Tāmaki River and Ōtara Creek.

The area was forested before human occupation, and by the 1840s was covered in a mix of fern and scrub, including plants such as kānuka, mānuka and toetoe.

==History==
===Māori history===
The first evidence of Tāmaki Māori in the coastal Manukau Harbour area comes from the 14th century, with evidence of the first settlements later in the 15th century. Papatoetoe formed an important part of the Waokauri / Pūkaki portage, connecting the Manukau Harbour and Tāmaki River, and was often used by Tāmaki Māori to avoid the Te Tō Waka and Karetu portages, controlled by the people who lived at Ōtāhuhu / Mount Richmond. Papatoetoe is within the traditional rohe of Waiohua, including the modern Tainui/Waiohua iwi Te Ākitai Waiohua. A Te Ākitai whakatauki (proverb) defines the boundaries of Papatoetoe:

Compared to other parts of Tāmaki Makaurau (the Auckland Region), there are few fortified pā sites in Papatoetoe due to the flat land. There is one known pā in the Papatoetoe area, at Cemetery Crater (Hillside South Park). The pā is known by the name Te Pā-o-te-tū-tahi-atu, a name that describes the pā as temporary, due to the surrounding flat landscape not being ideal for fortifications.

The Waokauri / Pūkaki portage was actively used during the early colonial era until the 1860s, as a way to transport goods to Papatoetoe.

===Colonial era===
In January 1836 missionary William Thomas Fairburn brokered a land sale between Tāmaki Māori chiefs, Pōtatau Te Wherowhero and Turia of Ngāti Te Rau, covering the majority of modern-day South Auckland between Ōtāhuhu and Papakura. The sale was envisioned as a way to end hostilities in the area, but it is unclear what the chiefs understood or consented to. Māori continued to live in South Auckland, unchanged by this sale. Fairburn was criticised for the sheer size of the purchase, and in 1842 the Crown significantly reduced the size of his land holdings, and the Crown partitioned much of the land for European settlers.

In April 1851, the Tāmaki Bridge was constructed along the Great South Road, spurring growth in the Papatoetoe area. In 1855 the road was metalled, and coach services to Auckland began in 1857 when the road reached as far south as Drury. European settlers began settling in the area from the 1850s, primarily Scottish and Irish Presbyterians. The area was sparsely populated, featuring large country houses such as Hillside, Puhi Nui and Papahinu. The first St Johns Presbyterian Church was built in 1855 (later replaced by wooden Gothic and brick churches). In 1861, Governor George Grey ordered the construction of the Great South Road further into the Waikato, to improve supply lines through swampy and thickly forested country, prior to the Invasion of the Waikato. On 9 July 1863, due to fears of the Māori King Movement, Governor Grey proclaimed that all Māori living in the South Auckland area needed to swear loyalty to the Queen and give up their weapons. Most people refused due to strong links to Tainui, leaving for the south. During this time, the Te Ākitai Waiohua rangatira Īhaka Takaanini was arrested and died on Rakino Island. After the war, the Crown confiscated 1.2 million acres of Māori land around the Waikato, including Waiohua land in South Auckland.

The first local government in the area was the Papatoitoi Highway District, which was defined in 1865 and began meeting from in 1868. In 1875, the Papatoetoe railway station opened, connecting Papatoetoe to Auckland in the north. The new township began developing around the railway station, and by the 1880s dairy farming had become popular in the area.

===Suburban growth===

Housing estates began developing in Papatoetoe in the early 1900s, primarily to the east of the railway station. These included the Kolmar Estate (1903), Central Estate (1912), the Ideal Estate (1913), Llanforda Estate (1913), Station Estate (1913), and the Green Park Estate (1914). By 1911, the population of Papatoetoe had doubled to 400 people. In March 1912, a temporary military camp was established for the 3rd (Auckland) Regiment at Puhinui.

In 1918, a public hall was constructed for Papatoetoe, and in the following year growth in the area meant that Papatoetoe became a town district. Papatoetoe became one of the fastest growing areas of Auckland in the 1920s, and a second commercial area began to develop in Papatoetoe, at the motor bus service terminus on Great South Road, near the Hunter&#x27;s tearooms, which developed into Hunters Corner. During the Great Depression, growth slowed in Papatoetoe, and the area became known for poultry farming. In 1929, the Waitemata Brewery opened near Papatoetoe, operated by the Dominion Brewery.

During World War II, the Cambria Park estate was requisitioned by the Public Works Department, who constructed a military camp for 6,000 troops from the United States Army. Middlemore Hospital opened in 1947, intended as a temporary military hospital, later becoming permanent.

Papatoetoe grew large enough to become a borough in 1946. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Māori Affairs Department of the New Zealand Government encouraged growth in the Papatoetoe area, leading to an influx of Urban Māori moving from rural areas of the country.

The development of the Auckland Southern Motorway led to an explosion in the population of Papatoetoe, with the population increasing four times in the post-World War II period. The motorway opened between Ellerslie and Redoubt Road in 1955. In 1958, the first modern supermarket in New Zealand was opened in Papatoetoe, by Tom Ah Chee, Norm Kent and John Brown, and in 1962 Nestlé opened a factory at Cambria Park in Papatoetoe, becoming a major employer in the area.

Papatoetoe became a city in 1965, and was amalgamated into Manukau City in 1989. In 1991, the Hunters Plaza mall was opened. Population growth had mostly ceased and remained stagnant throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, however a significant increase in population occurred after 2006 due to high rates of immigration and changes to the Auckland Unitary Plan allowing more intensive infill housing on large sections. Papatoetoe has the unofficial title of Auckland&#x27;s Little India, with 40 percent of the suburb&#x27;s population being of Indian ethnicity according to the 2018 census. 

==Local government==

The first local government in the area was the Papatoitoi Highway District, which was defined in 1865. This was succeeded by the Papatoetoe Town Board in 1919. In 1946, population growth led to Papatoetoe becoming a borough, and by 1965 Papatoetoe became a city. With the local government reforms of 1989, Papatoetoe was amalgamated into the Manukau City. In November 2010, all cities and districts of the Auckland Region were amalgamated into a single body, governed by the Auckland Council. The old Papatoetoe City Council building is at 91 Cambridge Terrace, Papatoetoe.

Papatoetoe is a part of the Ōtara-Papatoetoe local board, who elect members to the Ōtara-Papatoetoe Local Board, as well as two Manukau ward councillors who sit on the Auckland Council.

==Economy==
===Papatoetoe Town Centre===

===Hunter&#x27;s Corner===
Hunter&#x27;s Corner has become a popular shopping area for shoppers of Indian origin. Hunter&#x27;s Corner accounts for 60 retail outlets of which about 40 have some form of Indian flavour.

Hunter&#x27;s Corner used to be a notorious area for prostitution in the early 2000s due to it being relatively safer compared to similar town centres in South Auckland, however prostitution has largely disappeared in recent times after strong opposition from local residents.

===Hunters Plaza===

The Hunters Plaza shopping mall opened in 1991 and was upgraded in 2015. It features 47 stores, including Kmart and Woolworths.

<text>Ace Troubleshooter, often shortened to Ace, was an American pop punk band. Formed in December 1995 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, they released five albums through Tooth &amp; Nail Records.

== Background ==

Formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the band gained attention in 1996 by winning a national battle of the bands competition, sponsored by Sam Goody. Warne came up with the band&#x27;s name after reading the phrase, &quot;ace troubleshooter&quot;, in a history book.

The Ace Troubleshooter lineup changed several times, they started as a three-piece: John Warne, Josh Abbott and Matt Pacyga. They added Isaac Deaton as the second guitarist in 1998. Only two original members, John Warne and Josh Abbott, remained when the band came to an end. They had both played in the short-lived band Guerilla Rodeo shortly before Ace disbanded.

Relient K was often known as the &quot;brother band&quot; to Ace Troubleshooter. The two bands performed multiple tours together, and the members were all friends with each other. Dave Douglas, the drummer for Relient K, filled-in as a guitarist for a short time. Warne filled in as bassist for Relient K when Brian Pittman first left. Relient K&#x27;s Matt Thiessen said in 2000 that they were allowed by Ace to live on their bus, as Relient K was just starting out.

In February 2005 Toby David posted the announcement of the band&#x27;s breakup on their message board. Warne left to play bass guitar for Relient K. Abbott went on to play for My Red Hot Nightmare.

<text>Waltham is an inner suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand, located approximately south-east of the city centre. State Highway 76, part of Christchurch&#x27;s ring road system, and known there as Brougham Street, runs through the suburb, as does the Lyttelton Line rail corridor. Amenities include Lancaster Park, Christchurch&#x27;s former sports venue, now a community park, and Waltham pool. 

Approximate boundaries of the suburb are Waltham Road, Moorhouse Avenue, Ferry Road, Ensors Road, and the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River. Waltham was originally part of the Sydenham borough and was incorporated into the City of Christchurch in 1903 when the borough was ended. In the early 1980s local residents and the Christchurch city council tried to name the western part of the suburb, Charleston, between Ferry Road and Ensors Road. This was done to maintain the residential nature of the area against perceived industrial expansion. The attempt was partly successful and that area today is referred to as both Waltham and Charleston.

The full suburb is a mixture of residential and both light and heavy industry.

== History ==
An early Christchurch settler, Charles Prince, owned a large house, called Waltham House, on nearby Colombo Street South. In 1866, a meeting of local residents was held at the house and it unanimously agreed to name the district of the present day suburb, Waltham.

The Christchurch gasworks was located at the inner boundary of Waltham until its closure around 1980.

Waltham was home to a malt works and a collection of warehouses on Waltham road. These were demolished and redeveloped into 88 two and three bedroom townhouses after the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes.

<text>Sam and Friends is an American live-action and puppet sketch comedy television series and a lead-in to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; created by puppeteer Jim Henson and his eventual wife Jane Nebel. It was aired live twice daily as a local series in Washington, D.C., on WRC-TV in black and white, and later color, on weeknights from May 9, 1955, to December 15, 1961. However, most of the original episodes were never recorded, and are considered lost. A few surviving episodes can be viewed at the Paley Center for Media but many can also be found on video websites like YouTube, such as those digitally archived by The Jim Henson Company. Some have been documented by either the Henson Archives or newspaper articles published while the show was still on air.

==Plot==
The series focused mostly on Sam, a bald-headed, big-eared human who escaped the harshness of everyday life with the help of abstract friends that he created based on parts of his life. His friends included Yorick, Harry the Hipster, Professor Madcliffe, Chicken Liver, and a lizard-like character named Kermit (who later evolved into Kermit the Frog).

Early in its run, the show mostly featured the puppets lip-syncing to popular songs of the day (if the song was by a female performer, the puppet would wear a wig while singing). Later, formal sketches were drawn up, many spoofing well-known television shows at the time, including the series which followed &quot;Sam and Friends&quot; in the Washington market, &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot;.

A popular early sketch that would be used often in subsequent Henson productions was &quot;Glowworm&quot;, in which a character, often Kermit, would nibble on what looked like a worm, but would ultimately turn out to be the tongue or nose of the monster Big V, who would devour him.

Bob Payne once substituted for Jim Henson while he was in Europe. Jerry Juhl also worked on the show toward the end of its run where he substituted for Jane Henson. Starting in 1959, advertisements for Esskay Meats would appear at the end of the show, as well as Wilkins Coffee (the latter featured two Muppets created exclusively for the spots, Wilkins and Wontkins).

While Payne, Juhl, and Jane Henson all puppeteered in the series alongside him, Jim Henson provided all of the voices himself (unless the voices were taken from a record).

== Broadcast Time ==
==Characters==
* Sam (performed by Jim Henson) – A bald-headed humanoid-like character who is the main character. Only footage of him lip-syncing to a song currently survives. His head was made from papier-mâché.
* Kermit (performed by Jim Henson) – A reptilian-amphibious creature. He was prominently featured in many sketches that lead him to popularity, though he would not be referred to as a frog until a decade later.
* Harry the Hipster (performed by Jim Henson) – A beatnik. He resembled a black sock puppet with shades and spoke in a hip slang. Harry was one of the first Muppets designed and built by Jim Henson.
* Yorick (performed by Jim Henson) – A voracious puppet that resembled a rock head. Yorick has been known for appearing with supporting Muppets, whom he would attempt to eat. His puppet was made of papier-mâché with a tube in his mouth that allowed him to swallow things.
* Professor Madcliffe (performed by Jim Henson) – A tall-headed professor with big eyes and a mustache. He had a loud and energetic personality. He made most of his appearances in commercials.
* Chicken Liver (performed by Jim Henson) – A humanoid character with a tall head and a big nose. He has been described as &quot;a dramatic storyteller&quot;, and believed that the show lacked culture.
* Hank and Frank – Two bald humanoids that served as the show&#x27;s bit players. They took on the roles of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley in a spoof interview with Kermit.
* Mushmellon – A small yellow monster with a permanent grimace. He was a favorite among younger audiences.
* Icky Gunk – A sinister-looking green snake-like character sporting a pair of arms.
* Henrietta (performed by Jerry Juhl) – A pink female creature of indeterminable species. 
* Moldy Hay – A humanoid character with orange-red skin, a big nose, and hair over his eyes.
* Omar (performed by Jim Henson) – A beaked humanoid with a papier-mâché face. He was described as &quot;the nomadic type&quot;.
* Pierre the French Rat (performed by Jim Henson) – He was one of Jim Henson&#x27;s first puppets. Pierre was embodied as a puppet made from plastic wood.
* Bernice (performed by Bob Payne) - A female humanoid.

==Cast==
==Surviving episodes==
* Powder-Burn (August 20, 1959): A pun-filled &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; parody with Marshall Dilly (Chicken Liver) preparing for a showdown with Black Bart (Yorick) which results in a game of chess.
* Poison to Poison (October 29, 1959): Lip-synching to the Spike Jones track &quot;Poisen to Poisen&quot;, Harry the Hipster (as &quot;Ed Burrow&quot;) interviews Chicken Liver (as Alfred Hitchcock) in his rather horrifying home.
* The Westerners (circa November 1960): Lip-synching to a recording of Bob and Ray&#x27;s act The Westerners, Kermit and Chicken Liver play two cowboys who are having a little trouble getting off their horses.
* Huntley and Brinkley (January 6, 1961): In a parody of &quot;The Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;, Kermit hosts an interview with NBC News anchormen Chet Huntley and David Brinkley (as Hank and Frank).
* Visual Thinking (circa April 1961): In a mix of puppetry and animation, Harry demonstrates the Art of Visual Thinking to Kermit—and what it does to you once it gets out of control.
* Weather Warehouse (September 29, 1961): Harry demonstrates to a skeptical Kermit his new business for selling weather, and gives him a tour of the warehouse.
* Chef Omar (November 13, 1961): Omar prepares a chef salad, which blows up in his face when he serves it flaming.
* Final Episode (December 15, 1961): Kermit sings a song, then discusses the end of the series with Harry—who blows up all the scenery and equipment since they won&#x27;t need it anymore.

===Songs===
* C&#x27;est Si Bon (January 19, 1959): In a French village setting, Moldy Hay lip-synchs to Stan Freberg&#x27;s rendition of &quot;C&#x27;est Si Bon&quot;, with Hank and Frank repeating his dialogue too literally as a backup choir.
* Glow Worm (circa April 1961): Humming along to &quot;The Glow-Worm&quot;, Kermit is bugged by some inchworm-like fingers and is later met with a human hand.
* A Horse Named Bill: Kermit lip-synchs and plays the banjo to a recording of &quot;A Horse Named Bill.&quot;
* Hunger is From (February 12, 1960): Lip-synching to &quot;Hunger is From&quot;, Yorick details his midnight snacking while eating a plate full of food.
* I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin (195?): Icky Gunk (sporting a blonde, curly wig), and Hank and Frank serve as chorus singers in a lip-synched rendition of Stan Freberg&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin&quot; while Kermit, in spoken dialogue, messes up the lyrics.
* Singin&#x27; in the Rain (November 19, 1959): A little girl Muppet lip-synchs to an uptempo version of &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; as water begins to pour. Eventually, she is submerged in a water-filled bucket.
* That Old Black Magic (January 26, 1959): Kermit and Sam lip-synch to a recording of &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot; by Louis Prima and Keely Smith. To date, this is the only surviving &quot;Sam and Friends&quot; episode to feature Sam himself. 
*Miss Cone (December 9, 1960): An animated episode made with cutouts and synced to the titular song by Ken Nordine and The Frank Katz Group. 

==In popular culture==
&quot;Sam and Friends&quot; is mentioned in chapter 2 of Kermit the Frog&#x27;s book &quot;Before You Leap&quot;, under the heading of &quot;My First Big Splash&quot;.

Yorick made a cameo in a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; sketch in Season 1.

Henrietta appeared in &quot;The Muppets on Puppets&quot; during Rowlf the Dog&#x27;s mixed-up fairy tale sketch portraying the fairy godmother. In this appearance, Henrietta was also performed by Jerry Juhl.

Sam, Harry the Hipster, and Yorick appeared in &quot;The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years&quot;.

In Spring 2010, early puppet characters were rejoined in Henson Alternative&#x27;s &quot;Stuffed and Unstrung&quot;, for two musical pieces that aren&#x27;t improvised and no cuss words.

In August 2010, Jane Henson donated ten puppets from the show (including the original Kermit) to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History.

In July 2016, Hyattsville, Maryland, installed a memorial to Jim Henson in the city&#x27;s Magruder Park, featuring a large planter embossed with images of characters from &quot;Sam and Friends&quot; and benches inscribed with quotes from Henson.

Yorick made a visual appearance in the 2021 &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; episode &quot;Summer&#x27;s Disaster-Piece&quot;, where he replaces the head on Thomas Gainsborough&#x27;s painting &quot;The Blue Boy&quot;.

<doc id="1028404" wikidata="Q7132483" url="?curid=1028404" title="Papanui">
<text>Papanui is a major suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand. It is situated five kilometres to the northwest of the city centre. Papanui has a population of 3,645 consisting predominantly of Pākehā (New Zealand European &amp; Others) 86.9%, Asian 7.6%, Māori 5.3%, Pacific peoples 3.1%, Middle Eastern/Latin American/African 0.7% (2013 census). The suburb is located at the junction of three busy thoroughfares; Papanui Road leading to the city, the Main North Road that leads to North Canterbury and Harewood Road that leads to Christchurch International Airport. However, as with most Christchurch suburbs, Papanui has no defined borders.

Over the last 160 years Papanui has developed into a major suburban centre and is a satellite centre for Government and City Council services. These include the central government &#x27;Super Centre&#x27; in Winstone Avenue, Housing New Zealand in Restell Street and the Council Service Centre and Library on Langdons Road. The area has two high schools and five primary schools. There is little farm land left in the suburb with most of it having been developed into residential and commercial properties.

==Etymology==
The Māori name Papanui literally translated means &#x27;Big plain&#x27; (&quot;papa&quot; means flat and &quot;nui&quot; means big), a name which would aptly suit most of central Christchurch, which is one of New Zealand&#x27;s flattest cities. Another meaning, equally applicable to the district in the early days, is a platform set in the branches of a tree to accommodate a bird-spearer. A third meaning for the word Papanui comes from a Māori Legend and refers to a large funeral pyre. According to the legend, Tuhaitara, a Ngāi Tahu princess, sent her eldest son, Tamarairoa to Papanui to kill her former husband Marukore. But Marukore was aware of his son&#x27;s intentions and when Tamarairoa and his younger brother arrived, Marukore killed them both and burnt their bodies on a huge pyre.

==History==

===Pre-European===

Before European settlement Papanui, like much of Christchurch, was mostly marshy ground covered with native flax, toetoe and raupō brush. There was an abundance of forest birds which were hunted for food by the area&#x27;s Māori inhabitants. It is believed in 1800 possibly as many as 5000 Māori lived in Canterbury, but from disease like measles and influenza, introduced through the early whaling settlements on Banks Peninsula, and through tribal wars the number had fallen to around 500 in 1840. While most of the plains in the South Island of New Zealand were deforested by either the Māori or the so-called moa hunters in the mid-1300s, Papanui Bush was one of the few stands of pine and tōtara left in the Canterbury region at the time of European colonisation.

===European colonisation===

The Canterbury Association&#x27;s surveyor Captain Joseph Thomas and his team of surveyors arrived in Lyttelton (originally named Port Cooper) on 15 December 1848 on the ship &quot;Fly&quot;. They began to survey the Port Hills and Canterbury Plains around what would become Christchurch and its suburbs. As chief agent for the association Thomas was also responsible for preparing the infrastructure for the arrival of the first settlers at Lyttelton in December 1850. The First Four Ships, &quot;Charlotte Jane&quot;, &quot;Randolph&quot;, Sir &quot;George Seymour&quot; and &quot;Cressy&quot; landed 773 colonists. By the first anniversary of the first landing fifteen more ships had arrived bringing the colonist population to 3,000. By 1876 the estimated population of the city and suburbs was around 23,000 with the number increasing to 44,000 by 1886.

===Papanui Bush===

When the pilgrims first began to settle in Christchurch in the early 1851, Papanui Bush attracted a number of who made a living from milling tōtara and pine timber for construction and fire wood. Near the bush a settlement sprung up along on the old Māori track leading north to Kaiapoi which eventually became the Main North Road. The settlement soon boasted a hotel, store, blacksmiths, clothing shop, butchers, chemist, dispensers, and a school room appeared in 1853. Due to the pressing need for building materials in Christchurch, Papanui Road was one of the first roads built outside the city boundaries. The Papanui Bridge was also built over the Avon River in March 1852 to allow the timber to be brought by bullock drawn wagons directly into the Market Square near the city centre. In 1857 sawmilling had attracted a population of 692 to the Papanui village compared with 953 in Christchurch in the same year.

===Farm land===

By 1857 most of the trees in the area were felled and market gardening and orchards began to flourish. The land around Papanui proved to be remarkably fertile for farming once ditches and drains were dug to relieve the swampy areas. Gradually more immigrants settled in Papanui, crops were sown and sheep and dairy farms were established in the surrounding areas. Exports of wheat and wool soon became the main source of income for the province. From the mid-1880s frozen mutton shipments, from the nearby Canterbury Frozen Meat Company in Belfast, to the U.K. grew steadily and eventually surpassed other exports to become the main export earner. In the 1890s butter shipments joined the export trade with the Fernleaf brand becoming as well known as &#x27;Canterbury Lamb&#x27;. As settlement of Christchurch continued farms were sold for residential and commercial developments with Papanui being transformed into a suburb which became part of Christchurch city in 1923.

===Hotels===

One of the first buildings in the area was the Sawyers Arms Hotel which was opened by an American named Robert Carr. The hotel was built on the Main North Road near the corner of Sawyers Arms Road which derived its name from the hotel. Henry Roil was also &quot;mine host&quot; at the hotel in the early years as a partner of Carr&#x27;s. The hotel burnt down twice, firstly in November 1874 and was reopened by the current licensee John Wild in June 1875. The second fire occurred in September 1898 and was rebuilt by the licensee John Cooper and was renamed The Phoenix (the beautiful bird rising from the ashes) for its third incarnation. This building was finally demolished in February 1989 in a Supermarket redevelopment with the site eventually being encompassed by the Northlands Shopping Centre.

The Papanui Hotel was originally built in the early 1850s as a parsonage for the Reverend Bradley. The building was bought in 1859 by William Meddings, a local blacksmith and store keeper, who opened it as a hotel. In 1865 the hotel was bought by William Lawrence who rebuilt the front section in 1871. Lawrence passed the hotel on to his son William in 1898, and it is believed it remained in the Lawrence family ownership until 1906. The grounds boasted gardens, lawns, fruit trees, walkways and a skittle bowling alley. In 1957 a new public and lounge bar complex was built on the corner of the Main North Road and Winstone Avenue adjacent to the old building which was finally demolished in March 1969 having served as a landmark for 110 years.

=== 2010–2011 earthquakes ===

Papanui&#x27;s location in the north western area of the city saved it from the worst of the liquefaction that was suffered by the eastern and southern areas.
The Papanui Building (the first photo on this page) at 1 Main North Road was severely damaged by the first two main earthquakes and demolition commenced on 23 February 2011, the day after the second earthquake.
All of the churches in the area were damaged to some extent. The St Paul&#x27;s Vicarage was particularly badly damaged and has been demolished. St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church is still under repair with the scaffolding now being removed from the bell tower. A source close to the parish says it will reopen in September 2013.
St Giles Presbyterian Church was also un-repairable and has been demolished. Only the parish centre now remains there.
The status of St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church and the Papanui North Methodist Church repair or demolition has still not been resolved.
The Sanitarium factory was also significantly damaged and although production was halted for a while it is online with repairs being made. Many of the older shops in the Papanui Village were substantially damaged and demolished.

Unemployment in Papanui is currently low — 3.4% according to figures from the Ministry of Social Development (end of 2007).

===Industry===
For much of the 20th century, Papanui was a light industrial area. In 1900, Edward Halsey, a baker trained at Sanitarium in Michigan in the United States, emigrated to New Zealand and began making health foods in a wooden shed in Papanui, including Granola, New Zealand&#x27;s first breakfast cereal. Halsey&#x27;s business was successful, and the Sanitarium Health Food factory was built on the side of Halseys shed in 1919. It is still in operation today; however it was rebuilt in 1966 after being destroyed in a fire. Over recent decades Sanitarium&#x27;s Harewood Road factory has been awarded many honours for its prize winning gardens.

The building of the Firestone (now Bridgestone) tyre factory, in Langdons Road, was commenced on land, some of which was a 5-acre orchard purchased from the Cone family, in 1945. Firestone produced New Zealand&#x27;s first pneumatic tyre in 1948. This factory remained the only tyre manufacturer in the South Island.On 23 October 2009, it was announced that Bridgestone&#x27;s Australia and New Zealand manufacturing operations were to close. The announcement affected 275 jobs in Christchurch. In November 2010 the company has returned 3.2 acres of the former orchard land alongside the railway line to the city to be used as a public wetlands.

The delicatessen meat company, Verkerks, built a factory on Vagues Road in 1961, and has been stocking the small goods shelves ever since.

Though both of these factories are still in operation today but not so for the Ovaltine factory on the Main North Road and the Birdseye Frozen Foods factory which used to be sited next to the railway line in Harewood Road.

===Retail===

The original Papanui shopping village is located at the Papanui Junction.

Northlands Shopping Centre opened in Papanui in 1967. It covers 32,201 m2, with 103 shops and 1,251 carparks. The mall&#x27;s anchor tenants are The Warehouse, Pak&#x27;nSave, Countdown and Farmers.

==Features==

===Churches===

The area is home to one of the oldest parishes on the Canterbury plains. Established in 1853, St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church on Harewood Road was enlarged twice before being rebuilt using Kauri timber in 1877 to the design of the notable architect Benjamin Mountfort. In 1880 a peal of five bells was presented to the church by Mr J T Matson. This was the first ring of bells suitable for change ringing to be installed in New Zealand and is the only ringable set in the country of eight bells housed in a wooden tower. St Paul&#x27;s has the additional distinction of being the only parish church in New Zealand with bells for change ringing – the other rings are in cathedrals. The original ring of five bells was ordered in 1878. Some time later, ringing was suspended because the tower was no longer strong enough but a new one was constructed in 1912 and it was again strengthened in 1981 by an internal steel frame. The set is a light weight ring for change ringing with the tenor at 317 kg which protects the tower. A sixth bell was added in 1970 and two more in 1983.

The second oldest church in the area is the Papanui Methodist Church which was established in 1859. The second church was built in 1870 and the third and present church was opened in 1913 on the corner of Harewood Road and Chapel Street.

This was followed By St Giles Presbyterian Church which was first built in 1877 on the Main North Road three doors past the current Catholic church. In 1895 the church was further enlarged but this eventually proved to be insufficient and in 1924 a new church was built on the corner of Papanui Road and Frank Street.

St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church conducted services in the St Josesph&#x27;s School Chapel, designed by Mr Jacobson and built on Vagues Road, from 1878 until the current church was built on the corner of the Main North Road and Vagues Road in March 1922. The Parish was formally established in 1924 with Fr Hanrahan as the first incumbent priest.

The Papanui Baptist Church was established in 1958 and is located on Sawyers Road opposite to Morrison Avenue.

The Papanui Seventh-day Adventist Church is located on Grants Road adjoining the Christchurch Adventist School.

===Parks===

There are numerous reserves and parks within the suburban boundaries, the two most notable of these are as follow:

The Papanui Domain sited on Sawyers Arms Road where the Papanui Bush was clear felled in the 1850s. It is predominantly used for rugby league and softball, with the rugby league clubrooms adjoining on the southern boundary. In the early days it was also used for cycle racing.

St James Park, most likely named after its road frontage, is predominantly used for croquet, cricket and soccer. It is probably one of the most beautiful parks in the city with tree lined walkways and gardens. The park in the heart of Papanui is probably the best location to see overwintering monarch butterflies. On a warm sunny late autumn or early winter&#x27;s day head to the children&#x27;s play ground and look into the largely leafless old trees. There you will see monarchs clustering together often holding on to the remaining leaves for support. It ís a great spot for a picnic beneath the trees with monarchs fluttering in the air above.

===Landmarks===

In the 1920s the residents wanted a fitting memorial to the fallen soldiers of World War I. Duly the Memorial Hall and Library (pictured above) was built and opened in the heart of Papanui 1923. This building served as the Town Hall, library and picture theatre for over 50 years, until it was demolished in the late 1970s with the land reverting to a reserve. In 1997 the Returned Services Association prevailed upon the council to redevelop the site as a war memorial reserve and to include the names of the fallen soldiers from World War II.

==Transportation==
From the first days of colonisation horses and bullocks provided the pulling power for wagons, drays, coaches, cabs, vans, traps, gigs and carts of all dimensions. This gave rise to stable, blacksmith, farrier and saddlery businesses in the Papanui area. Hitching posts and water troughs were common place especially at &#x27;watering holes&#x27; like the Papanui Hotel.

When Canterbury&#x27;s first railways were built the Main North Line was opened through Papanui on 27 April 1872. The current Railway Station, though planned and designed in 1872 was not opened until 1900. In the 28 intervening years a 25x8 foot shed did &#x27;Station&#x27; duty. A tram line was laid on Papanui Road in 1880 terminating at the Papanui Railway Station. The first Trams were steam and horse drawn until the introduction of electric trams on the Papanui line in 1905.

The Northcote extension to St Bede&#x27;s College was opened on 28 February 1913 and closed on 30 September 1930. With the exception of the first few tram-cars, which were brought from the United States, the trams were made by a local firm, Boon &amp; Co. The last tram to Papanui ran in 1954 with the trams being replaced by bright red buses run by the Christchurch Transport Board (later Red Bus Ltd.).

==Policing==

As the city expanded a police station was built in Papanui in proximity to the railway line on the corner of Winstone Ave. It was opposite to the current railway station in Restell Street and was opened on 8 October 1879. The buildings erected were a watch house with two cells, and a six-room cottage at a cost of £824. The Papanui police area was huge at that time and went westward to Sheffield and Colgate. The first officer in charge was Constable Daniel Flanagan and he held the post for nearly seven years.
In 1949 the police operations were moved to 103 St James Avenue using the existing house on the section (dating from 1925) and the original watch house(1879). In 1959 a new police station and residence was opened on Papanui Road just south of the Blighs Road intersection. In 1979 the senior sergeant&#x27;s residence was converted into offices with a CIB office being opened in the same year. Detective Sergeant Roy Powell was the first appointee. The first policewoman stationed at Papanui, in September 1978, was Constable Diane Smith.
For Papanui residents in the 1950s and 1960s the name &#x27;Handlebar Harry&#x27; will bring back memories of a tall policeman on a push bike. Constable Ronald Miles was the local enquiry officer and had the habit of riding the streets of Papanui with his typewriter strapped to the handlebars of his cycle. However it was not the position of the typewriter that earned him the nickname, it was his wonderful &#x27;Jimmy Edwards&#x27; style flowing moustache.
The current police station is opposite Langdons Road on the corner of the Main North Road and Mary Street and was opened on 30 October 1991.
As an interesting foot note the Watch House has survived the years and can now be seen amongst Lady Isaac&#x27;s collection of heritage buildings at McArthurs Road, Harewood.

==Parks==

St James Park was originally &#x27;glebe land&#x27; belonging to St Paul&#x27;s church and was divorced from the main church property by the laying of the Main North Railway line in the early 1870s. It is believed to have been farmed by James Triggs, the St Paul&#x27;s Church verger, and part of it was developed as a cricket ground by the Papanui Cricket Club under the captaincy of John Matson with the permission of Rev. Lorenzo Moore. By 1874 the new incumbent at St Paul&#x27;s, the Rev Brittan, had joined the Cricket Club as a player, but had also leased some of the land to Mr Jackson, another club member, for stock grazing. The land appears in an 1880 map as a cricket ground, but was later abandoned by the cricket club and sold to Ivorys Cool Stores in 1916. The land was purchased by the City in 1924 after residents, led by Rev Griffin, petitioned the council for a park and has both main entrances sited on St James Avenue. It was named in a Public Notice drawn up by the Christchurch City Council Bylaws and Finance committee chaired by Councilor Andrews on 30 April 1924. Rev Griffin did not live to see the park opened, and as a mark of respect Memorial Gates and a rose garden we jointly funded by the residents and the Council in his honour.

==Education==
The main educational centre is Papanui High School opened in 1936 which is located adjacent to the rear of Northlands Shopping Centre on Langdons Road. It has a roll of students.

The other high school in the area is St Bede&#x27;s College, a Catholic state-integrated school which was established in 1911 on Ferry Road and relocated to its current site on the Main North Road in 1920 as a day and boarding school. It has students.

Papanui Primary School was established in 1871 on Winters Road. The school was rebuilt further along Winters Road on of land in September 1926. It has students. Paparoa Street Primary School opened in 1953. It has students.

St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School (Catholic) opened on Vagues Road in 1878. Christchurch Adventist School opened on Grants Road in 1925. They have rolls of and students, respectively. Loreto College (Catholic) opened on Windermere Road in 1930 but was closed in 1978.

All these schools except St Bede&#x27;s and Loreto are coeducational. Rolls are as of

<doc id="1028429" wikidata="Q1784209" url="?curid=1028429" title="Cud">
<text>Cud is a portion of food that returns from a ruminant&#x27;s stomach to the mouth to be chewed for the second time. More precisely, it is a bolus of semi-degraded food regurgitated from the reticulorumen of a ruminant. Cud is produced during the physical digestive process of rumination.

== Rumination ==

The alimentary canal of ruminants, such as cattle, giraffes, goats, sheep, alpacas, and antelope, are unable to produce the enzymes required to break down the cellulose and hemicellulose of plant matter. Accordingly, these animals rely on a symbiotic relationship with a wide range of microbes, which largely reside in the reticulorumen, and which are able to synthesize the requisite enzymes. The reticulorumen thus hosts a microbial fermentation which yields products (mainly volatile fatty acids and microbial protein), which the ruminant is able to digest and absorb. This allows the animals to extract nutritional value from cellulose which is usually undigested.

The process of rumination is stimulated by the presence of roughage in the upper part of the reticulorumen. The chest cavity is stretched, forming a vacuum in the gullet that sucks the semi-liquid stomach content into the esophagus. From the esophagus it is taken back to the mouth with retro peristaltic movements. When the stomach content, or the cud, arrives in the mouth of the ruminant, it is pushed against the palate with the tongue to remove excess liquid, the latter is swallowed and the solid material is chewed thoroughly so the cattle can extract the minerals present in the cud brought to the surface during rumination. The function of rumination is that food is physically refined to expose more surface area for bacteria working in the reticulorumen, as well as stimulation of saliva secretion to buffer the rumen pH.

When food has been degraded sufficiently it passes from the reticulorumen through the reticulomasal orifice to the omasum followed by the abomasum to continue the digestion process in the lower parts of the alimentary canal. No enzymes are secreted in the rumen. Enzymes and hydrochloric acid are only secreted from the abomasum (fourth stomach) onwards, and ruminants function from that point onwards much like monogastric animals, such as pigs and humans.

== Chemistry ==
The reticulorumen has an optimum pH of 6.5 for the microbe population to thrive. Consumption by ruminants of an insufficiently fibrous diet leads to little cud formation and therefore lowered amounts of saliva production. This in turn is associated with rumen acidosis, where the rumen pH can fall to 5 or lower. Rumen acidosis is associated with a lowered appetite which leads to still lower rates of saliva secretion. Eventually, a collapse of the microbial ecosystem in the rumen will occur because of the low pH. Acute rumen acidosis can lead to death of the animal, and will occur if the animal is allowed to eat a diet with no roughage but high levels of highly digestible starchy concentrate. Some dairy cows in intensive systems of milk production may have sub-acute acidosis because of the high rates of cereals in their diets relative to an insufficient amount of forage. However, most producers provide adequate fodder in the form of hay to prevent this.

== Jewish dietary laws ==
Jewish dietary laws state that an animal that chews the cud and has a cloven hoof is acceptable for consumption. Any animal that doesn&#x27;t chew the cud and have a cloven hoof is unclean.

== Cuisine ==
Goat cud is sometimes an ingredient in Pinapaitan.

<doc id="1028430" wikidata="Q3322842" url="?curid=1028430" title="Urban revolution">
<text>In anthropology and archaeology, the urban revolution is the process by which small, kin-based, illiterate agricultural villages were transformed into large, socially complex, urban societies. 

==Overview==
Australian archaeologist V. Gordon Childe introduced the term &quot;urban revolution&quot; in the 1930s. Childe also coined the term &quot;Neolithic Revolution&quot; to describe the earlier process by which hunter-gatherer societies domesticated crops and animals and began a farming lifestyle. Childe was the first to synthesize and organize the large volume of new archaeological data in the early-20th century in social terms. Whereas previous archaeologists had concentrated on chronology and technology, Childe applied concepts and theories from the social sciences to interpret archaeological finds.
Childe first discussed the urban revolution in his 1936 book, &quot;Man Makes Himself&quot;, and then in his 1950 article in the journal &quot;Town Planning Review&quot; brought the concept to a much larger audience. In that paper, he presented a 10-point model for the changes that characterized the urban revolution:

# In point of size the first cities must have been more extensive and more densely populated than any previous settlements.
# In composition and function the urban population already differed from that of any village … full-time specialist craftsmen, transport workers, merchants, officials and priests.
# Each primary producer paid over the tiny surplus he could wring from the soil with his still very limited technical equipment as tithe or tax to a deity or a divine king who thus concentrated the surplus.
# Truly monumental public buildings not only distinguish each known city from any village but also symbolise the concentration of the social surplus.
# But naturally priests, civil and military leaders and officials absorbed a major share of the concentrated surplus and thus formed a &quot;ruling class&quot;.
# Writing.
# The elaboration of exact and predictive sciences – arithmetic, geometry and astronomy.
# Conceptualized and sophisticated styles 
# Regular “foreign” trade over quite long distances.
# A state organisation based now on residence rather than kinship.

Childe&#x27;s own work highlighted the urban revolution which he identified as occurring in Mesopotamia in the course of the 4th millennium BCE.

Although sometimes interpreted as a model of the origins of cities and urbanism, Childe&#x27;s concept in fact describes the transition from agricultural villages to state-level, urban societies. Scientists generally recognise this change,
which occurred independently in several parts of the world, as a significant development in human sociocultural evolution.
Although contemporary models for the origins of complex urban societies have progressed beyond Childe&#x27;s original formulation, there is general agreement that he correctly identified one of the most far-reaching social transformations
prior to the Industrial Revolution, as well as the major processes involved in the change.

<text>Glenhaven is a semi rural suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 32 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of The Hills Shire, part of the Hills District.

==History==
The area was originally called Sandhurst, which remains Glenhaven&#x27;s most prominent street. Crego Road, which runs off Sandhurst is the highest. There was some confusion with mail because of a suburb in Melbourne with the same name. A public meeting was held to have the name changed to reflect its valley location. The upper portion of the valley was known as &quot;The Glen&quot;, and the lower portion as &quot;The Haven&quot;, hence the choice Glenhaven.

Glenhaven is on the route of the Great North Road that linked Parramatta with the Hunter Valley. John Evans, one of the first settlers in the area, used a bullock team to drag timber, and the route he used became known as Evans Road. The area had many wild flowers, including waratahs, Christmas bush, boronias, native roses, and a variety of orchids which thrived there.

Sandhurst Post Office opened on 11 July 1892 and was renamed Glenhaven on 1 January 1893. It closed in 1972.

<doc id="1028435" wikidata="Q7544013" url="?curid=1028435" title="Smart Tag">
<text>Smart Tag is the former name of a transponder-based electronic toll collection system implemented by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). It was launched as Fastoll on April 15, 1996. Fastoll was rebranded as Smart Tag in 1998, and was placed under the umbrella of Smart Travel. In November 2007, the Smart Tag brand name was retired in favor of E-ZPass Virginia, several years after the Smart Tag system became a part of the E-ZPass network.

Originally, Smart Tag only operated at certain toll roads and crossings in Virginia. The system became interoperable with the E-ZPass toll collection system on October 27, 2004, although Richmond Metropolitan Authority owned toll roads—Boulevard Bridge, the Downtown Expressway, and the Powhite Parkway (excluding the extension)—did not begin accepting E-ZPass until August 3, 2005; E-ZPass integration had been delayed due to damages from Tropical Storm Gaston. Smart Tag branded transponders operate throughout the E-ZPass network, and E-ZPass branded transponders operate at all E-ZPass Virginia (formerly Smart Tag) toll collection points.

Roads and crossings that accept Smart Tag/E-ZPass Virginia/E-ZPass:

*Dulles Toll Road from Falls Church to Dulles International Airport (DC suburbs).
*Dulles Greenway, a privately owned highway from Dulles to Leesburg.
*Downtown Expressway in Richmond.
*Powhite Parkway and Powhite Parkway Extension in Richmond and Chesterfield County.
*Boulevard Bridge (the &quot;Nickel Bridge&quot;, though it costs 45 cents now) in Richmond
*Pocahontas Parkway in Chesterfield and Henrico County.
*Chesapeake Expressway in Chesapeake.
*George P. Coleman Bridge, across the York River near Newport News (U.S. Highway 17).
*Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel
*Any road or crossing in the E-ZPass network.

<doc id="1028436" wikidata="Q7232025" url="?curid=1028436" title="Portland Rose Festival">
<text>The Portland Rose Festival is an annual civic festival held during the month of June in Portland, Oregon. It is organized by the volunteer non-profit Portland Rose Festival Foundation (named the Portland Rose Festival Association until the 2000s) with the purpose of promoting the Portland region. It includes three separate parades, along with a number of other activities.
==History==
The Portland Rose Society, founded by Georgiana Pittock and friends in 1888, began with a backyard rose show in Pittock&#x27;s garden. The annual fundraising event drew more crowds each year. By 1904, the rose society was hosting its annual rose show along with additional festivities, including a parade and pageant. In 1905, Portland Mayor Harry Lane is remembered for his rousing speech at the Lewis and Clark Exposition, telling the large crowd that Portland needed a &quot;festival of roses&quot;. In 1906, the first Rose Festival and Flower Parade was held in Portland. Pittock and neighbors contributed roses from their gardens to decorate floats, wagons, people and horses for the parade. In 1907, the Portland Rose Festival Association was incorporated and Portland hosted its first official Portland Rose Festival.

The Grand Floral Parade is the centerpiece of the festival and the second largest all-floral parade in the United States after the Tournament of Roses Parade. More than 500,000 spectators line the route, making this flower parade the largest single-day spectator event in Oregon. The first parade, in 1907, was called the Rose Carnival, but eventually came to be known as the Rose Festival Parade and later still the Grand Floral Parade. The 1907 festival also included an &quot;electric parade&quot; with illuminated floats; this evolved into the Merrykhana Parade but after a two-season suspension was renamed the Starlight Parade in 1976.

Since 1930 a queen has been selected from a court of high school seniors from each school in the area. The members of the court are called princesses. For a brief period starting in 1997 they were officially called &quot;ambassadors&quot;, but the term &quot;princesses&quot; was reinstated in January 2007. A college scholarship is awarded to a 14-member &quot;royalty&quot;. Starting in 2009, the Rose Festival Foundation opened one place on the court to someone from a school outside the Portland city limits.
There are drivers for the Princesses, who are chosen from each high school. The first African American driver (escort) was Sam Whitney from Benson High School in 1954. 
A Junior Rose Festival, focused on children, began unofficially in 1921, on the city&#x27;s east side, and included its own parade and junior court. It became an official part of the Rose Festival in 1936. The festival&#x27;s annual Junior Parade takes place in the city&#x27;s Hollywood district. The Junior Parade has grown to an event involving nearly 10,000 children, making it the world&#x27;s largest parade for children.
During Fleet Week, ships from United States Navy, Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers and the Royal Canadian Navy dock along the seawall of Tom McCall Waterfront Park.

The festival also hosts the Starlight Parade, a fireworks display, and carnival rides along the Portland waterfront, among other events. Dragon boat races on the Willamette River have been included every year since 1989.

The Golden Rose Ski Classic is an annual ski race originating in 1936. It is the oldest known organized ski race in America, and is the only USSA-sanctioned summer race.

An air show was added to the Rose Festival in 1988 and remained part of the festival through 2002. Held at the Hillsboro Airport, it was named the Rose Festival Air Show, with the name generally preceded by a sponsor&#x27;s name, but after the 2002 and 15th show the Rose Festival Association decided to discontinue its relationship with the event. In 2003, the show was reorganized as the Oregon International Air Show, with different sponsors and no longer a Rose Festival event.

No festival was held in 1917 and 1918 because of World War I or from 1942 through 1945 because of World War II. From 2007 to 2016, the festival began with the 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade. The parade was cancelled in 2017, but returned in 2018. COVID-19 pandemic concerns canceled the 2020 and 2021 parades, but the parade would return in 2022.

<text>2MCE FM Bathurst is a local community radio station, located on the campus of Charles Sturt University in Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia. It broadcasts to the communities of Bathurst and Orange and their surrounds.

2MCE FM is supported by CSU&#x27;s School of Information and Communication Studies in conjunction with the local community, and operates two frequencies:
*92.3 MHz in the Bathurst area, broadcasting from a transmitter atop Mount Panorama, with a power output of 1,000 watts.
*94.7 MHz in the Orange area, broadcasting from a transmitter atop Mount Canobolas, with a power output of 500 watts.

==History==
The station is one of Australia&#x27;s oldest non-metropolitan licensed community radio stations. The station began full-time broadcasting in May 1976. Run by dedicated staff and members of the community, the early broadcasts came from a 170 watt transmitter and a bizarre aerial on top of the library.

A 1 kW transmitter was installed on Mount Panorama in 1977, and replaced in 1994. A translator service to Orange (with a separate transmitter on Mount Canobolas) came on-line in 1987.

In 1989 renovations increased the number of studios from one small studio to three somewhat larger work areas, located on the university&#x27;s Bathurst campus. The studios are also used by students for their course work, and feature broadcast-standard tools and equipment.

==Facilities==
The station includes two broadcast studios plus three production studios.
A separate studio houses a newsroom and produce the nationally networked news service for community stations, the National Radio News. 

==Name==
The &quot;2&quot; in the callsign is the New South Wales prefix for radio stations. The &quot;MCE&quot; in the callsign stands for the University&#x27;s Bathurst antecedent, &quot;Mitchell College of Advanced Education&quot;, now Charles Sturt University.

<text>John H. Gaffney (June 29, 1855 – August 8, 1913), nicknamed the &quot;King of Umpires&quot; and &quot;Honest John&quot; was an American umpire and manager in Major League Baseball. He was baseball&#x27;s first great umpire, and played a pioneering role in the use of multiple umpires in baseball games.

==Biography==
Born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, Gaffney&#x27;s family moved to Worcester when he was 11. He began playing baseball as a third baseman, but his promising career was ended when he injured his arm throwing a snowball in 1880, reportedly just before being promoted to the National League. He became a printer, and started umpiring college games involving nearby Ivy League teams in 1883.

He joined the National League&#x27;s umpiring staff in August 1884, with his first game being an 11-inning, 1–0 game between the two teams battling for first place, Providence and Boston. He quickly gained wide respect as a top officiator, and as the league&#x27;s best judge of balls and strikes. In the middle of his third season, his knowledge of the game was so highly regarded that he was offered the managing position of the Washington Nationals, and he took over the team on August 21, 1886. The team, mired in last place, finished the last third of the season without improving its position; but Gaffney continued in the post for the entire 1887 campaign, with a slight improvement to 7th place. He finished his managing career with 61 wins against 101 losses. He was much-liked by the players, and while he was traveling during the 1887 world championship series, his players – including catcher Connie Mack and future umpiring great Hank O&#x27;Day – boarded his train during a Washington stopover and surprised him with the gift of a diamond ring in appreciation of his efforts.

Into the 1880s, baseball had always been played with the use of a single umpire, but by late in the decade it was becoming apparent that this was an unsatisfactory arrangement for the most important games. The 1886 World&#x27;s Championship Series had witnessed a two-game experiment in which each team selected an umpire – both positioned behind the catcher – with a third official, called a referee, positioned behind the pitcher and able to move about the bases. However, the referee was only permitted to make calls when the two umpires either disagreed or requested his decision; this system was deemed a failure by all observers. The following year, Gaffney was selected by the NL as one of the two umpires to work the 1887 series, along with Kick Kelly, who was regarded as the best umpire in the American Association from 1883 to 1886 before managing that league&#x27;s Louisville team in 1887. The two worked out a system whereby one umpire would work behind home plate, calling balls and strikes, while the other positioned himself in the field to make calls on the bases. This format was a decided success, and although it was not until almost 1910 that two umpires per game became standard, it formed the basis for the multiple umpire systems which followed. Gaffney later umpired in the 1888 and 1889 championship series, and again for three games in the 1892 NL championship series, for a total of 37 postseason games – a 19th-century record.

After the 1887 series, Gaffney and Kelly both returned to umpiring, although they switched leagues in the process – Kelly moved to the NL for the 1888 season, while Gaffney switched to the American Association for 1888–89, where he received a salary of $2,500 plus road expenses, making him easily the best-paid umpire. In the American Association, Gaffney pioneered the practice of moving from behind the catcher to behind the pitcher when a batter reached first base, a crucial move in the days of solitary umpires. He made other innovations, including calling balls fair or foul depending on where they cleared the fence rather than where they landed, and creating a shirt in which extra baseballs could be stored. After each season, he reported omissions and inadequacies in the rules to the league, and many of his suggested revisions were enacted.

Mack, who was a rookie catcher for Gaffney&#x27;s 1887 team and later caught for 5 years in which Gaffney umpired, described him as the perfect umpire; umpiring legend Bill Klem noted that he was the first to be widely called &quot;King of Umpires&quot;.

Gaffney moved to the Players&#x27; League for its sole season in 1890 before returning to the NL in September 1891. The stress of 19th century umpiring, when players and fans demonstrated tremendous abusiveness and hostility toward the lone umpires, began to take its toll, however, and Gaffney was released by the NL after the 1893 season due to his increasing drinking. After beginning 1894 in the Eastern League, he returned to the NL in mid-season, but his alcohol abuse continued and he was again let go. He umpired in the Eastern League again from 1895 to 1897 before coming back to the NL in 1899–1900, joining Tom Lynch in becoming one of only two men to umpire in 12 major league seasons in the 19th century.

He umpired college games near Worcester after 1900, and later moved to New York City, where he worked as a night watchman.

Gaffney died in poverty at age 58 in New York City. Following his death, Mack arranged a benefit game in Worcester between his Philadelphia Athletics and the Boston Red Sox, played on October 5, 1916, to pay for a monument for Gaffney&#x27;s grave. In 1946, Gaffney was included in the Honor Rolls of Baseball.

==Quotes==
*&quot;I have studied the rules thoroughly. I keep my eyes wide open, and I follow the ball with all possible dispatch. With the players I try to keep as even tempered as I can, always speaking to them gentlemanly yet firmly. I dislike to fine, and in all my experience have not inflicted more than $300 in fines, and I never found it necessary to order a player from the field. Pleasant words to players in passion will work far better than fines.&quot; – as quoted in &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, April 25, 1891
*&quot;He was perfect. He would follow a ball all the way from the pitcher, and when he made his decision, he would say, &#x27;That was one-eighth of an inch outside&#x27; – or &#x27;That was one-eighth of an inch too low,&#x27; and he was right. There has never been another umpire like him.&quot; – Connie Mack, in &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, April 8, 1943

<doc id="1028445" wikidata="Q7167348" url="?curid=1028445" title="Percy Folio">
<text>The Percy Folio is a folio book of English ballads used by Thomas Percy to compile his &quot;Reliques of Ancient Poetry&quot;. Although the manuscript itself was compiled in the 17th century, some of its material goes back well into the 12th century. It was the most important of the source documents used by Francis James Child for his 1883 collection &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot;.

==The manuscript==
Those who owned the manuscript before Percy did not treat it well; its owners had probably regarded its Middle English and border dialect as incomprehensible and worthless. When Percy first came across the manuscript, in the house of its former owner Humphrey Pitt at Shifnal, Shropshire, pages were being used by his housemaids to start fires. Percy had the manuscript bound, and the bookbinder inflicted additional damage in trimming the edges of the sheets, losing first or last lines on many pages. Percy did not treat the manuscript particularly well himself; he wrote notes and comments in it and tore out some pages after binding.

The original folio is in the British Library, known as Additional MS. 27879. In its present form the manuscript consists of some 520 paper pages, containing 195 individual items. The works were transcribed in the middle decades of the 17th century. The handwriting in the manuscript appears to be the same throughout and bears some similarity with that of Thomas Blount but it cannot be determined for certain if he originally collected the work. The loose leaves that comprise the manuscript are now individually mounted and covered with gauze.

==Contents==
In addition to the ballads culled and compiled by Percy and Child, the folio contains an alliterative poem in Middle English entitled &quot;Death and Liffe&quot; and &quot;Scottish Feilde&quot;, which is a poem on the Battle of Flodden. The manuscript contains ballads, for the most part, but also metrical romances such as &quot;Sir Degaré&quot; and &quot;The Squire of Low Degree&quot;. There are several Arthurian texts, including &quot;King Arthur and King Cornwall&quot;, &quot;Sir Lancelott of Dulake&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Sir Gawain&quot;, &quot;Merline&quot;, &quot;The Carle of Carlisle&quot;, &quot;The Greene Knight&quot;, &quot;The Boy and the Mantle&quot; and &quot;The Turke and Gowin&quot;. The last three narratives are entirely unknown outside the Percy Folio. The manuscript also preserves eight Robin Hood ballads: &quot;Robin Hood&#x27;s Death&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood and the Butcher&quot;, &quot;The Jolly Pinder of Wakefield&quot;, &quot;Little John a Begging&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood Rescuing Three Squires&quot;, and &quot;Robin Hood and Queen Katherine&quot;.

==Reception and significance==
Percy published several pieces from the manuscript, many of which were &quot;repaired&quot; or frankly rewritten, especially in his &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot;, but did not allow fellow historians access to the original manuscript during his lifetime.

Percy&#x27;s book was the constant companion of Gottfried August Bürger, a childhood hero of Novalis, one of the chief influences of George MacDonald, whom C.S. Lewis considered his master. And thus the manuscript, through Percy&#x27;s book had a direct line of influence on Lewis&#x27;s works.

Despite its losses, the Percy Folio ranks alongside the Exeter Book, the &quot;Pearl Manuscript,&quot; and the Cotton library&#x27;s &quot;monstrarum librarum&quot; of the &quot;Beowulf&quot; manuscript as one of the most important documents in English poetry. A full edition of the folio&#x27;s contents was not published until 1867, with a supplement of &quot;loose and humorous&quot; songs the following year.

<text>Up the Down Staircase is a novel written by Bel Kaufman, published on January 27, 1965, which spent 64 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. In 1967 it was released as a film starring Sandy Dennis, Patrick Bedford, Ruth White, Jean Stapleton and Eileen Heckart.

==Plot==
Sylvia Barrett, an idealistic English teacher at an inner city high school, hopes to nurture her students&#x27; interest in classic literature (especially Chaucer and writing). She quickly becomes discouraged during her first year of teaching, frustrated by bureaucracy, the indifference of her students, and the incompetence of many of her colleagues. The title of the book is taken from a memo telling her why a student was being punished: he had gone &quot;up the down staircase&quot;. She decides to leave the public school (government-funded) system to work in a smaller private setting. She changes her mind, though, when she realizes that she has, indeed, touched the lives of her students.

The novel is epistolary; aside from opening and closing chapters consisting entirely of dialogue the story is told through memos from the office, fragments of notes dropped in the trash can, essays handed in to be graded, lesson plans, suggestions dropped in the class suggestion box, and most often by inter-classroom notes that are a dialogue between Sylvia and an older teacher. Sylvia also writes letters to a friend from college who chose to get married and start a family rather than pursuing a career. The letters serve as a recap and summary of key events in the book, and offer a portrait of women&#x27;s roles and responsibilities in American society in the mid-1960s.

An inter-classroom note in which the older teacher, Bea Schachter, is translating the jargon of the memos from the office includes the memorable epigram Let it be a challenge to you&#x27; means you&#x27;re stuck with it.&quot; Calling a trash can a circular file comes from the same memo: Keep on file in numerical order&#x27; means throw in waste-basket.&quot; Another, &quot;It has come to my attention&quot; means &quot;You&#x27;re in trouble.&quot;

==Adaptations==
The novel has been adapted to film and the stage. Tad Mosel wrote the screenplay for the 1967 film version starring Sandy Dennis as Sylvia Barrett. The play is frequently performed in high school drama classes. The film version was parodied in &quot;Mad&quot; magazine as &quot;In the Out Exit&quot; in regular issue #118, April 1968. &quot;Up the Down Staircase&quot; title was parodied by the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Up the Down Steroid&quot;. The title of Porcupine Tree&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Up The Downstair&quot; is an homage to the novel.

<text>George Gale (June 3, 1756 – January 2, 1815) was an American politician and the first representative of the fifth congressional district of Maryland.

Gale was born in Somerset County in the Province of Maryland in 1756. He attended public school and served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. When Maryland convened its convention to ratify the United States Constitution in 1788, Gale was a member. He was then elected to the First United States Congress as a member of the House of Representatives; he had also narrowly lost as a candidate for the U.S. Senate in that Congress, receiving 40 votes from the Maryland legislature against John Henry&#x27;s 42. He served from 1789 to 1791, when George Washington appointed him supervisor of distilled liquors for the district of Maryland.

Gale died in Cecil County, Maryland in 1815. He is buried in what was formerly the Gale family cemetery. It is now on the grounds of St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Perryville, MD.

His son, Levin Gale, later followed in George&#x27;s footsteps and became a U.S. Representative.

<doc id="1028460" wikidata="Q1834" url="?curid=1028460" title="Death Note">
<text>Death Note (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from December 2003 to May 2006, with its chapters collected in 12 volumes. The story follows Light Yagami, a genius high school student who discovers a mysterious notebook: the &quot;Death Note&quot;, which belonged to the Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. The series centers around Light&#x27;s subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free society, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named &quot;Kira&quot;, and the subsequent efforts of an elite Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him.

A 37-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Madhouse and directed by Tetsurō Araki, was broadcast on Nippon Television from October 2006 to June 2007. A light novel based on the series, written by Nisio Isin, was also released in 2006. Additionally, various video games have been published by Konami for the Nintendo DS. The series was adapted into three live-action films released in Japan in June, November 2006, and , and a television drama in 2015. A miniseries titled &quot;Death Note: New Generation&quot; and a fourth film were released in 2016. An American film adaptation was released exclusively on Netflix in August 2017, and a series is reportedly in the works. Two one-shot manga sequels, &quot;C-Kira&quot; and &quot;a-Kira&quot;, were published in 2008 and 2020, respectively; they were later collected in a single volume titled &quot;Death Note: Short Stories&quot;, alongside other standalone stories, in 2021. An online social deduction game, &quot;Death Note: Killer Within&quot;, was released by Bandai Namco Entertainment for the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Windows via Steam in 2024.

&quot;Death Note&quot; media, except for video games and soundtracks, is licensed and released in North America by Viz Media. The episodes from the anime first appeared in North America as downloadable from IGN before Viz Media licensed it. The series was aired on YTV&#x27;s Bionix programming block in Canada and on Adult Swim in the United States with a DVD release following. The live-action films briefly played in certain North American theaters, in 2008, before receiving home video releases. By April 2015, the &quot;Death Note&quot; manga had over 30 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series.

==Plot==

In Tokyo, a disaffected high school student named Light Yagami finds the &quot;Death Note&quot;, a mysterious black notebook with rules that can end anyone&#x27;s life in seconds as long as the writer knows both the target&#x27;s true name and face. Light uses the notebook to kill high-profile criminals and is visited by Ryuk, a and the Death Note&#x27;s previous owner. Ryuk, invisible to anyone who has not touched the notebook, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light&#x27;s actions.

Global media suggest that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious murders and name them . Interpol requests the assistance of the enigmatic detective L to assist in their investigation. L tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him to kill a decoy. Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. L deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police investigation, led by Light&#x27;s father, Soichiro Yagami. L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the families of those connected with the investigation and designates Light as the prime suspect. Light graduates from high school to college. L recruits Light into the Kira Task Force.

Actress-model Misa Amane obtains a second Death Note from a named Rem and makes a deal for eyes, which reveal the names of anyone whose face she sees, at the cost of half her remaining lifespan. Seeking to have Light become her boyfriend, Misa uncovers Light&#x27;s identity as the original Kira. Light uses her love for him to his advantage, intending to use Misa&#x27;s eyes to discern L&#x27;s true name. L deduces that Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. Rem threatens to kill Light if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem pass the Death Note to Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. 

With memories of the Death Note erased, Light joins the investigation and, together with L, deduces Higuchi&#x27;s identity and arrests him. Light regains his memories and uses the Death Note to kill Higuchi, regaining possession of the book. After restoring Misa&#x27;s memories, Light instructs her to begin killing as Kira, causing L to cast suspicion on Misa. Rem realizes Light&#x27;s plan to have Misa sacrifice herself to kill L. After Rem kills L, she disintegrates and Light obtains her Death Note. The task force agrees to have Light operate as the new L. The investigation stalls but crime rates continue to drop.

Four years later, cults worshiping Kira have risen. L&#x27;s potential successors are introduced: Near and Mello. Mello joins the mafia whilst Near joins forces with the US government. Mello kidnaps Director Takimura, who is killed by Light. Mello kidnaps Light&#x27;s sister and exchanges her for the Death Note, using it to kill almost all of Near&#x27;s team. A Shinigami named Sidoh goes to Earth to reclaim his notebook and ends up meeting and helping Mello. Light uses the notebook to find Mello&#x27;s hideout, but Soichiro is killed in the mission. Mello and Near exchange information and Mello kidnaps Mogi and gives him to Near. Kira&#x27;s supporters attack Near&#x27;s group, but they escape. Shuichi Aizawa, one of the task force members, becomes suspicious of Light and meets with Near. As suspicion falls again on Misa, Light passes Misa&#x27;s Death Note to Teru Mikami, a fervent Kira supporter, and appoints newscaster Kiyomi Takada as Kira&#x27;s public spokesperson. Near has Mikami followed whilst Aizawa&#x27;s suspicions are confirmed. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her. Takada kills Mello but is killed by Light. Near arranges a meeting between Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light tries to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the task force members, but Mikami&#x27;s Death Note fails to work, having been replaced with a decoy. Near proves Light is Kira discovering Mikami had not written down Light&#x27;s name. Light is wounded in a scuffle and begs Ryuk to write the names of everyone present. Ryuk instead writes down Light&#x27;s name in his Death Note, as he had promised to do the day they met, and Light dies.

One year later, the world has returned to normal and the Kira Taskforce Members are conflicted over whether they made the right decision. Meanwhile, cults continue to worship Kira.

=== &quot;C-Kira&quot; (one-shot sequel) ===
Three years later, Near, now functioning as the new L, receives word that a new Kira has appeared. Hearing that the new Kira is randomly killing people, Near concludes that the new Kira is an attention-seeker and denounces the new Kira as &quot;boring&quot; and not worth catching. A named Midora approaches Ryuk and gives him an apple from the human realm, in a bet to see if a random human could become the new Kira, but Midora loses the bet when the human writes his own name in the Death Note after hearing Near&#x27;s announcement. Ryuk tells Midora that no human would ever surpass Light as the new Kira.

=== &quot;a-Kira&quot; (one-shot sequel) ===
Another ten years later, Ryuk returns to Earth and gives the Death Note to Minoru Tanaka, the top-scoring student in Japan, hoping that he will follow in Light Yagami&#x27;s footsteps. On explaining the rules to Minoru, Ryuk is surprised when he returns the notebook and tells him to return it and his memory of their encounter to him in two years&#x27; time. Two years later, on receiving the notebook back from Ryuk, Minoru reveals he has no plans to use it himself but rather he plans to auction it off to the governments of the world, with Ryuk&#x27;s help sending his offer out as &quot;a-Kira&quot;, having waited two years until he was old enough to have a bank account to allow his plan to work. Elsewhere, Near (as L) is revealed to be developing technology meant to track and eventually find a method of destroying Shinigami, although it is not yet advanced enough to be useful. After selling the Death Note to U.S. President Donald Trump for a sum that would ensure every Japanese citizen under the age of 60 would be financially set for life, Minoru relinquishes his ownership and memory of his plan to Ryuk, assuring his own anonymity, while Trump is left unable to use the Death Note after the King of Death creates a new rule disallowing the Death Note to be sold, and he secretly returns it to Ryuk. Minoru collapses to the ground in the bank after withdrawing his savings. It is revealed that Ryuk wrote his name in the Death Note next to Light&#x27;s. He longs for a human who will use the notebook for a longer period of time.

==Production==
===Development===
The &quot;Death Note&quot; concept derived from a rather general concept involving and &quot;specific rules&quot;. Author Tsugumi Ohba wanted to create a suspense series because the genre had some suspense series available to the public. After the publication of the pilot chapter, the series was not expected to receive approval as a serialized comic. Learning that &quot;Death Note&quot; had received approval and that Takeshi Obata would create the artwork, Ohba said, they &quot;couldn&#x27;t even believe it&quot;. Due to positive reactions, &quot;Death Note&quot; became a serialized manga series.

&quot;Thumbnails&quot; incorporating dialogue, panel layout and basic drawings were created, reviewed by an editor and sent to Takeshi Obata, the illustrator, with the script finalized and the panel layout &quot;mostly done&quot;. Obata then determined the expressions and &quot;camera angles&quot; and created the final artwork. Ohba concentrated on the tempo and the amount of dialogue, making the text as concise as possible. Ohba commented that &quot;reading too much exposition&quot; would be tiring and would negatively affect the atmosphere and &quot;air of suspense&quot;. The illustrator had significant artistic licence to interpret basic descriptions, such as &quot;abandoned building&quot;, as well as the design of the Death Notes themselves.

When Ohba was deciding on the plot, they visualized the panels while relaxing on their bed, drinking tea, or walking around their house. Often the original draft was too long and needed to be refined to finalize the desired &quot;tempo&quot; and &quot;flow&quot;. The writer remarked on their preference for reading the previous &quot;two or four&quot; chapters carefully to ensure consistency in the story.

The typical weekly production schedule consisted of five days of creating and thinking and one day using a pencil to insert dialogue into rough drafts; after this point, the writer faxed any initial drafts to the editor. The illustrator&#x27;s weekly production schedule involved one day with the thumbnails, layout, and pencils and one day with additional penciling and inking. Obata&#x27;s assistants usually worked for four days and Obata spent one day to finish the artwork. Obata said that when he took a few extra days to color the pages, this &quot;messed with the schedule&quot;. In contrast, the writer took three or four days to create a chapter on some occasions, while on others they took a month. Obata said that his schedule remained consistent except when he had to create color pages.

Ohba and Obata rarely met in person during the creation of the serialized manga; instead, the two met with the editor. The first time they met in person was at an editorial party in January 2004. Obata said that, despite the intrigue, he did not ask his editor about Ohba&#x27;s plot developments as he anticipated the new thumbnails every week. The two did not discuss the final chapters with one another and continued talking only with the editor. Ohba said that when they asked the editor if Obata had &quot;said anything&quot; about the story and plot, the editor responded: &quot;No, nothing&quot;.

Ohba claims that the series ended more or less in the manner that they intended for it to end; they considered the idea of L defeating Light Yagami with Light dying but instead chose to use the &quot;Yellow Box Warehouse&quot; ending. According to Ohba, the details had been set &quot;from the beginning&quot;. The writer wanted an ongoing plot line instead of an episodic series because &quot;Death Note&quot; was serialized and its focus was intended to be on a cast with a series of events triggered by the Death Note. &quot;13: How to Read&quot; states that the humorous aspects of &quot;Death Note&quot; originated from Ohba&#x27;s &quot;enjoyment of humorous stories&quot;.

When Ohba was asked, during an interview, whether the series was meant to be about enjoying the plot twists and psychological warfare, Ohba responded by saying that this concept was the reason why they were &quot;very happy&quot; to place the story in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;.

===Concepts===
====The notebooks====
The core plot device of the story is the &quot;Death Note&quot; itself, a black notebook with instructions (known as &quot;Rules of the Death Note&quot;) written on the inside. When used correctly, it allows anyone to commit a murder, knowing only the victim&#x27;s name and face. According to the director of the live-action films, Shusuke Kaneko, &quot;The idea of spirits living in words is an ancient Japanese concept... In a way, it&#x27;s a very Japanese story&quot;.

Artist Takeshi Obata originally thought of the books as &quot;Something you would automatically think was a Death Note&quot;. Deciding that this design would be cumbersome, he instead opted for a more accessible college notebook. Death Notes were originally conceived as changing based on time and location, resembling scrolls in ancient Japan, or the Old Testament in medieval Europe. However, this idea was never used.

====Themes====
Writer Tsugumi Ohba had no particular themes in mind for &quot;Death Note&quot;. When pushed, he suggested: &quot;Humans will all eventually die, so let&#x27;s give it our all while we&#x27;re alive&quot;. In a 2012 paper, author Jolyon Baraka Thomas characterised &quot;Death Note&quot; as a psychological thriller released in the wake of the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack, saying that it examines the human tendency to express itself through &quot;horrific&quot; cults.

===Pilot chapter===
The &quot;Death Note&quot; process began when Ohba brought thumbnails for two concept ideas to Shueisha; Ohba said that the &quot;Death Note&quot; pilot, one of the concepts, was &quot;received well&quot; by editors and attained positive reactions from readers. Ohba described keeping the story of the pilot to one chapter as &quot;very difficult&quot;, declaring that it took over a month to begin writing the chapter. He added that the story had to revive the killed characters with the Death Eraser and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t really care&quot; for that plot device.

Obata said that he wanted to draw the story after he heard of a &quot;horror story featuring &quot;. According to Obata, when he first received the rough draft created by Ohba, he &quot;didn&#x27;t really get it&quot; at first, and he wanted to work on the project due to the presence of and because the work &quot;was dark&quot;. He also said he wondered about the progression of the plot as he read the thumbnails, and if &quot;Jump&quot; readers would enjoy reading the comic. Obata said that while there is little action and the main character &quot;doesn&#x27;t really drive the plot&quot;, he enjoyed the atmosphere of the story. He stated that he drew the pilot chapter so that it would appeal to himself.

Ohba brought the rough draft of the pilot chapter to the editorial department. Obata came into the picture at a later point to create the artwork. They did not meet in person while creating the pilot chapter. Ohba said that the editor told him he did not need to meet with Obata to discuss the pilot; Ohba said &quot;I think it worked out all right&quot;.

===Anime adaptation===
Tetsurō Araki, the director, said that he wished to convey aspects that &quot;made the series interesting&quot; instead of simply &quot;focusing on morals or the concept of justice&quot;. Toshiki Inoue, the series organizer, agreed with Araki and added that, in anime adaptations, there is a lot of importance in highlighting the aspects that are &quot;interesting in the original&quot;. He concluded that Light&#x27;s presence was &quot;the most compelling&quot; aspect; therefore the adaptation chronicles Light&#x27;s &quot;thoughts and actions as much as possible&quot;. Inoue noted that to best incorporate the manga&#x27;s plot into the anime, he &quot;tweak[ed] the chronology a bit&quot; and incorporated flashbacks that appear after the openings of the episodes; he said this revealed the desired tensions. Araki said that, because in an anime the viewer cannot &quot;turn back pages&quot; in the manner that a manga reader can, the anime staff ensured that the show clarified details. Inoue added that the staff did not want to get involved with every single detail, so the staff selected elements to emphasize. Due to the complexity of the original manga, he described the process as &quot;definitely delicate and a great challenge&quot;. Inoue admitted that he placed more instructions and notes in the script than usual. Araki added that because of the importance of otherwise trivial details, this commentary became crucial to the development of the series.

Araki said that when he discovered the &quot;Death Note&quot; anime project, he &quot;literally begged&quot; to join the production team; when he joined he insisted that Inoue should write the scripts. Inoue added that, because he enjoyed reading the manga, he wished to use his effort.

===Light novels===
A light novel adaptation of the series has been written by Nisio Isin, called &quot;Death Note Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases&quot;. The novel was released by Shueisha on August 1, 2006. It serves as a prequel to the manga series, with Mello narrating the story of L&#x27;s first encounter with Naomi Misora during the Los Angeles &quot;BB Serial Murder Case&quot; mentioned in volume 2 of the manga. Besides Naomi&#x27;s character, the novel focuses on how L works and one of the criminals L has to chase down. Insight was given into Watari&#x27;s orphanage and how the whole system of geniuses such as L, Mello, Beyond Birthday, Matt and Near were put to work. Viz released the novel in English on February 19, 2008. The film &quot;&quot; was also adapted into a light novel with the same name on December 25, 2007, by &quot;M&quot;, While the novel is similar to the film, there are many significant changes to the plot (for example, Near is not a Thai boy, but the same Near that appears in the manga). It also reveals more information about L and his past. Viz released it on October 20, 2009.

===Anime===
The &quot;Death Note&quot; anime, directed by Tetsurō Araki and animated by Madhouse, began airing on Nippon TV on October 4, 2006, and finished its run on June 27, 2007, totaling 37 episodes. The series aired on the network &quot;every Tuesday at 0:56&quot;, which is effectively Wednesday. The series was co-produced by Madhouse, Nippon Television, Shueisha, D.N. Dream Partners and VAP. In North America, the series was licensed by Viz for residents in the United States to use &quot;Download-to-Own&quot; and &quot;Download-to-Rent&quot; services while it was still airing in Japan. This move was seen as &quot;significant because it marked the first time a well known Japanese anime property was made legally available in the 
United States for domestic audiences to download while the title was still airing on Japanese television&quot;. The downloadable episodes contained the original Japanese audio track and English subtitles, and were made available through IGN&#x27;s Windows-only Direct2Drive service. DVDs of the series have also been released, containing both an English dubbed audio track, produced by Ocean Productions, and the original Japanese audio track with optional English subtitles. Viz announced at Anime Expo 2007 that the first DVD was officially released on November 20, 2007, in both regular and special editions, and also confirmed at San Diego Comic-Con in 2007 that the first 15,000 copies of each DVD contain collectible figures.

&quot;Death Note&quot; was slated to make its North American television premiere in Canada, as part of YTV&#x27;s Bionix programming block, on September 7, 2007. However, the show was removed from the schedule at the last minute and the Canadian premiere was pushed back to October 26, 2007, at 10:00 p.m. The series premiered in the U.S. on October 20, 2007, at 12:00 a.m. on Adult Swim and ran until January 10, 2010, when its contract expired. The last episode aired on YTV, July 4, 2008, and would later air on Adult Swim two days later. The show was removed from YTV&#x27;s schedule on July 5, 2008, with its last airing being a rerun of the final episode at 1:30 a.m. ET. Soon after, Bionix became a 2-hour block on Saturday nights. The show also streamed online free on Adult Swim Video, with a new episode available every Saturday afternoon, on the day of its broadcast premiere. On July 26, 2017, Starz announced that they would be offering episodes of the series for their video on demand service starting on August 1 of that same year.

A two-hour animated TV special aired on Nippon Television in Japan on August 31, 2007, at 8:00 p.m. It is a recap which takes place after the series end, where a approaches Ryuk in the realm in order to learn more about the human world. Instead, Ryuk tells him of all the events leading up to the last story arc, about Light Yagami and his rival L. Originally, this special was advertised as a retelling told from Ryuk&#x27;s point of view, but it does not give a different point of view from what was originally told. However, it contains updated dialog, as well as a few new scenes.

Nippon TV aired the special on August 22, 2008. Like the first special, this new compilation summarized a part of the 2006–2007 anime television series. Specifically, it recounted the final half of the suspenseful supernatural story, including the investigators Near and Mello&#x27;s confrontations with the vigilante Kira. This version features more updates than the previous one, most notably omission of the mafia plot.

===Video games===
A &quot;Death Note&quot; video game developed and published by Konami for the Nintendo DS, titled , was released on February 15, 2007. &quot;Kira Game&quot; is a strategy game where the player takes on the role of Kira or L. These are just titles, as any character can be Kira or L. The player will attempt to deduce who their enemy is (Kira will try to uncover L&#x27;s identity and vice versa). This will play out in three phases: investigation, where the player will discuss the case and clues with other characters; voting, where each member of the investigation team casts a vote on who they suspect is L or Kira based on the player&#x27;s performance in the previous phase; L/Kira, where the player can either focus their investigation on one member to see if they are Kira (L part), or force a member off of the team (Kira part). A sequel to the game, , was released in Japan on July 12, 2007. The storyline is based on the second part of the manga, featuring characters such as Mello and Near.

A third game, , was released for the Nintendo DS in Japan on February 7, 2008. The player assumes the role of a rookie FBI agent who awakens in a strange hotel and attempts to escape with the help of L, who provides assistance via an in-game PDA. The story is set before the Kira investigation in the original series. Several characters from &quot;Death Note&quot; appear in &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot; and &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;, a fighting game featuring multiple characters from &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; titles. Light, Ryuk, and L appear in &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot; as support characters. Misa, Near, and Mello are added as support characters in &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot; as well. The 2019 video game &quot;Jump Force&quot; features Light and Ryuk as non-playable characters, playing a key role in the game&#x27;s story mode.

An online social deduction game, titled &quot;Death Note: Killer Within&quot;, was released by Bandai Namco Entertainment for the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Windows via Steam on November 5, 2024. In the game, up to ten players are split into two teams—Kira and his followers and L and the police investigation team. Kira&#x27;s team aims to kill all its target with the Death Note and L&#x27;s team must seize and dispose of the Death Note. Both teams try to uncover the identities of the opposing players. The players are represented by pawns, akin to those used by Near in the original series.

===Musical===

In 2015, a musical adaptation of the manga called &quot;Death Note: The Musical&quot; ran in both Japan and South Korea. It was originally composed in English by Broadway composer Frank Wildhorn, with lyrics by Jack Murphy and book by Ivan Menchell. An English production was announced in May 2023 to play at the London Palladium for two nights on August 21–22, 2023, directed by Nick Winston starring Joaquin Pedro Valdes as Light, Dean John-Wilson as L and Frances Mayli McCann as Misa.

==Reception==
===Manga===
By April 2015, the &quot;Death Note&quot; manga had over 30 million copies in circulation. On ICv2&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Shonen Properties Q2 2009&quot;, &quot;Death Note&quot; was the third best-selling manga property in North America. The series ranked second on Takarajimasha&#x27;s &quot;Kono Manga ga Sugoi!&quot; list of best manga of 2006 and 2007 for male readers. It was nominated for the 38th Seiun Awards in the Best Comic category in 2007. The manga received the Grand Prize of Best Manga and Best Screenplay at the Japan Expo Awards 2007. The series won the 2008 Eagle Award for Favourite Manga as voted by UK fans. According to a survey conducted in 2007 by the Ministry of culture of Japan, occupies the tenth place among the best manga of all time. It also received several nominations such as Best Manga at the 2006 American Anime Awards, the 2007 Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize, an Official Selection at Angoulême International Comics Festival 2008, and Obata was nominated for Best Penciller/Inker at the 2008 Eisner Awards. In 2007, the first three volumes of &quot;Death Note&quot; were on the American Library Association&#x27;s 2007 Great Graphic Novels for Teens Top Ten list.

Douglas Wolk of &quot;Salon&quot; said that a rumor circulated stating that the creators intended to create &quot;Death Note&quot; to last half as long as its actual run and Ohba and Obata had been persuaded to lengthen the storyline when &quot;Death Note&quot;″s popularity increased, noting that the rumor &quot;makes sense, since about halfway through the series, there&#x27;s a point that seems like a natural ending&quot;. In addition, he said that fans wrote &quot;thousands&quot; of &quot;Death Note&quot; fan fiction stories and posted them on the internet. In 2006, Japanese fans pointed out the similarities between &quot;Death Note&quot; and the 1973 one-shot manga by Shigeru Mizuki. Comipress reported that the only difference between the story and &quot;Death Note&quot; is that there are no &quot;shinigamis&quot;.

&quot;Anime News Network&quot; writer Zac Bertschy called &quot;Death Note&quot; a &quot;surprisingly gripping and original suspense tale that raises a handful of interesting questions about morality&quot;. He noted that the difference between the series and other manga from the same demographic was very big due to the murders the main character commits as well as how he hides his identity of Kira. Although Bertschy mentioned some manga readers will be surprised with the dark themes of &quot;Death Note&quot;, he praised the series for its &quot;great art, great story, [and] compelling characters&quot;. Briana Lawrence from the same website stated that what makes &quot;Death Note&quot; so interesting is that there is no villain, &quot;instead it had two opposing sides that both believe in the same thing: justice&quot;. She felt that once vital characters fading into the background, the ending brings back what the fans loved about the first volume and the supporting cast are &quot;given a chance to shine&quot;. She also mentioned that the epilogue made no mention of what happens with Misa Amane and how Near and Mello were still treated like parts of L. Julie Rosato from &quot;Mania Entertainment&quot; found the story to be very entertaining, having liked Light&#x27;s development in the story and L&#x27;s introduction as well as how the latter starts suspecting the former&#x27;s identity. Additionally, she praised the story as it is &quot;building a climax&quot; with each detail introduced in the first chapter, making the reader look forward to upcoming chapters. Jolyon Baraka Thomas, in a &quot;Japanese Journal of Religious Studies&quot; article, describes the manga as having a &quot;somber narrative&quot; with a &quot;dark cast&quot;. Obata&#x27;s art is &quot;[rendered] in stark strokes characterized---fittingly---by a complex interplay of light and shadow&quot;.

===Anime===
The anime was commended with Tom S. Pepirium of IGN saying that &quot;Death Note&quot;″s &quot;heavy serialized nature&quot; is what &quot;makes the show so engaging and discussion worthy&quot;. Pepirium, saying that translating &quot;Death Note&quot; is &quot;no small task&quot;, stated that Stephen Hedley created an English dub with &quot;nothing clunky&quot;. He added that Karl Willems, director of the dub, assembled a &quot;stunning voice cast of professionals&quot; with a &quot;solid tone minus some of the cheesy yelling and screaming of other dubs&quot;. On the NPR show &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, John Powers said that &quot;Death Note&quot; is &quot;at least as addictive as a show like &quot;Lost&quot;&quot;. &quot;Hyper&quot; wrote: Jacob Hope Chapman from &quot;Anime News Network&quot; praised Teru Mikami&#x27;s role as bloody and flashy and even better than that of Near, Mello, and Misa. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s Henry St. Leger wrote, &quot;What starts as a moral fable about the corruption of power becomes a slow-burning game of cat-and-mouse as Light is chased down by the world&#x27;s greatest detective. Some droning voice acting leadens what is otherwise a brilliantly terse noir.&quot; &quot;Vulture&quot;&#x27;s Maya Phillips wrote, &quot;Beyond its deft twists and turns, &quot;Death Note&quot; also addresses questions about morality, justice, and capital punishment. All this, plus beautiful animation and well-written dialogue and plot, makes &quot;Death Note&quot; the cream of the animated crop.&quot;

The &quot;Death Note&quot; anime was one of the series to win Best TV Anime at the 2007 Tokyo International Anime Fair. In 2009, &quot;Death Note&quot; was listed as the 51st best animated show in IGN&#x27;s Top 100 Animated Series.

===Light novels===
A.E. Sparrow of &quot;IGN&quot; reviewed the novel &quot;Another Note&quot; and gave it a 9.5 out of 10. Sparrow said that the author understood &quot;what made these characters click so well&quot; and &quot;captures everything that made the manga the compelling read that it is&quot;. Sparrow said that fans of &quot;Death Note&quot; who read &quot;Another Note&quot; will &quot;find a welcome home&quot; in Nisio Isin&#x27;s work which &quot;adds a few more fun layers&quot; to the &quot;Death Note&quot; franchise. The novelization of &quot;L: Change the World&quot; became the second top-selling light novel in Japan during 2008.

==Legacy and controversies==
The series release outside Japan has inspired other works, as well as individuals making their own mock &quot;Death Notes&quot;, including one that was associated with a real-life murder. According to &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, &quot;Death Note&quot; &quot;[turned] Japan&#x27;s most-popular print medium into an internationally controversial topic that has parents wondering whether they should prohibit their kids from reading manga entirely&quot;. Live-action director Shusuke Kaneko commented in response, &quot;If preventing them from seeing this movie is going to make kids better, then why not prevent them from watching all bad news?&quot;.

In regards to the 2019 &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Comedian&quot;, Rosie Knight of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that Samir&#x27;s story appears to take a large influence from &quot;Death Note&quot;. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has parodied &quot;Death Note&quot; in both comic books and animation with the 2008 comic book story &quot;Murder, He Wrote&quot; in &quot;The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror&quot; #14, where Bart receives the notebook from the Ryuk-ified ghost of Krusty the Clown, and the &quot;Death Tome&quot; segment of the 2022 television episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXXIII&quot;, with Lisa receiving the titular book.

===Bans and attempted bans===
Early in 2005, school officials in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning (People&#x27;s Republic of China), banned &quot;Death Note&quot;. The immediate cause was that students had been altering notebooks to resemble Death Notes and then writing the names of acquaintances, enemies, and teachers in the books. The ban was designed to protect the &quot;physical and mental health&quot; of students from horror material that &quot;misleads innocent children and distorts their mind and spirit&quot;. Jonathan Clements has suggested that the Chinese authorities acted partly against &quot;superstition&quot;, but also against illegal, pirate publishers of &quot;Death Note&quot;. The ban has been extended to other Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Lanzhou in Gansu Province. Legally published Chinese-language versions of &quot;Death Note&quot; are published in Hong Kong. On June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed &quot;Death Note&quot; among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China.

In 2007, the education bureau in Pingtung County, Taiwan asked teachers to pay attention to any negative influence on elementary school students reading the manga. In May 2010, the Albuquerque Public Schools in New Mexico held a hearing to ban the &quot;Death Note&quot; manga from their district&#x27;s schools; it was unanimously voted down. After volumes of &quot;Death Note&quot; were found at the February 2013 suicide of a 15-year-old girl in Yekaterinburg, Russia, a local parents&#x27; group began campaigning to regulate all media based on the series, saying that it had an adverse effect on the minds of children. In March 2014, investigators concluded that the manga did not cause the girl to commit suicide.

===Imitations of the series===

There have been various imitations around the world of the premise of &quot;Death Note&quot;. At least one instance was linked to a crime - on September 28, 2007, two notes written with Latin characters stating , were found near the partial remains of a Caucasian male in Belgium. The case has been called the &quot;Mangamoord&quot; (Dutch for &quot;Manga Murder&quot;) in Belgian media. It was not until 2010 that four people were arrested in connection to the murder. A senior at the Franklin Military Academy in Richmond, Virginia, United States was suspended in 2007 after being caught possessing a replica &quot;Death Note&quot; notebook with the names of fellow students. The school&#x27;s principal wrote a letter to the student&#x27;s parents linking to an unofficial website where visitors can write names and circumstances of death for people they want to die.

In South Carolina in March 2008, school officials seized a &quot;Death Note&quot; notebook from a Hartsville Middle School student. District officials linked the notebook to the anime/manga. The notebook listed seven students&#x27; names. The school planned a disciplinary hearing and contacted the seven students&#x27; parents. In Gadsden, Alabama in April 2008, two sixth-grade boys were arrested for possession of a &quot;Death Note&quot; that listed names of several staff members and fellow students. According to Etowah County Sheriff&#x27;s Department Sgt. Lanny Handy, the notebook was discovered the previous afternoon by a staffer. The students were suspended from the county&#x27;s schools, pending a juvenile court hearing. The students, their parents, and school officials had met with Handy and a junior probation officer. In Gig Harbor, Washington, one middle school student was expelled and three were suspended on May 14, 2008, for having 50 names in their own &quot;Death Note&quot; book, including President George W. Bush.

It was reported in September 2009, that a Year Eight boy in Sydney, Australia, created a &quot;Death Note&quot; that along with names contained a &quot;battle plan&quot; detailing where bombs could be placed inside his school. In December 2009, two students at an elementary school in Oklahoma were disciplined for a &quot;Death Note&quot; with the names and descriptions of deaths of two girls that had angered them. A Michigan middle school student was suspended indefinitely in March 2010 for a &quot;Death Note&quot;. In May 2010, a middle school student in Avonworth School District in Pennsylvania was suspended for a &quot;Death Note&quot; with names of fellow students and pop singer Justin Bieber. In February 2015, a fifth-grade student of an elementary school near Pittsburgh was suspended for owning a &quot;Death Note&quot; and writing other students&#x27; names in it.
