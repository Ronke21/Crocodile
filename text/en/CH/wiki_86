<text>A mutual organization, also mutual society or simply mutual, is an organization (which is often, but not always, a company or business) based on the principle of mutuality and governed by private law. Unlike a cooperative, members usually do not directly contribute to the capital of the organization, but derive their right to profits and votes through their customer relationship.

A mutual exists with the purpose of raising funds from its membership or customers (collectively called its &quot;members&quot;), which can then be used to provide common services to all members of the organization or society. A mutual is therefore owned by, and run for the benefit of, its members – it has no external shareholders to pay in the form of dividends, and as such does not usually seek to maximize and make large profits or capital gains. Mutuals exist for the members to benefit from the services they provide and often do not pay income tax.

Surplus revenue made will usually be re-invested in the mutual to sustain or grow the organization, though some mutuals operate a dividend scheme similar to a cooperative.

== Background ==
The primary form of financial business set up as a mutual company in the United States has been mutual insurance. Some insurance companies are set up as stock companies and then mutualized, their ownership passing to their policy owners. In mutual insurance companies, what would have been profits are instead rebated to the clients in the form of dividend distributions, reduced future premiums or paid up additions to the policy value.

This is a competitive advantage to such companies—the idea of owning a piece of the company could be more attractive to some potential clients than the idea of being a source of profits for investors. In the typical stock company, profits go to shareholders. In contrast, a mutual manages the company in the best interests of the customers. Furthermore, a mutual company is able to focus on a longer horizon than a typical company. Some mutual insurance companies make this claim explicitly.

In more general terms, mutual organizations are able to minimize the principal–agent problem by removing one stakeholder, the investor-owner, in favor of one of the other stakeholders, usually the customer, who becomes both user and joint owner of the business.

However, the mutual form of ownership also has disadvantages. One example is that mutual companies have no shares to sell and hence no access to equity markets.

At one time, most major U.S. life insurers were mutual companies. For many years, the tax status of such organizations was open to dispute, as they were technically nonprofit organizations. Eventually, it was agreed that federal taxation would be based on their share of business: for instance, in years in which mutual companies represented half of the business, they would be responsible for half of the taxes paid by the industry.

Many savings and loan associations were also mutual companies, owned by their depositors.

As a form of corporate ownership the mutual has fallen out of favor in the U.S. since the 1980s. Savings and loan industry deregulation and the late 1980s savings and loan crisis led many to change to stock ownership, or in some cases into banks. Many large U.S.-based insurance companies, such as the Prudential Insurance Company of America and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company have &quot;demutualized&quot;, with shares of stock being distributed to their policyholders to represent the ownership interest they formerly had in the form of their interest as mutual policyholders.

The Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company has also investigated demutualization, even though its form of ownership is embedded in its name. It is noted that other formerly mutual companies such as Washington Mutual, a former savings and loan association, have been allowed to demutualize and yet retain their names.

The approximate British equivalent of the savings and loan is the building society. Building societies also went through an era of demutualisation in the 1980s and 1990s, leaving only one large national building society and around forty smaller regional and local ones. Significant demutualisation also occurred in Australia and South Africa in the same era.

Cooperatives are very similar to mutual companies. They tend to deal in primarily tangible goods and services such as agricultural commodities or utilities rather than intangible products such as financial services. Nevertheless, banking institutions with close ties to the co-operative movement are usually known as credit unions or cooperative banks rather than mutuals.

== Modern mutuality ==
Various types of financial institutions around the world are mutuals, and examples include:
* Mutual building societies
** Nationwide Building Society – United Kingdom
** Coventry Building Society – United Kingdom
** Nelson Building Society – New Zealand
* Mutual banks and mutual savings banks
** Greater Bank – Australia
** SBS Bank – New Zealand
* Mutual healthcare providers
** Benenden Healthcare Society – United Kingdom
* Mutual insurance companies
** Shepherds Friendly Society – United Kingdom
** Protection and indemnity insurance

Some mutual financial institutions offer services very similar to (if not the same as) those of a commercial bank. In some markets, mutuals offer very competitive interest rates and fee tariffs on savings and deposit accounts, mortgages and loans. The members who save and borrow with the mutual ultimately own the business.

== Conversion ==
Mutualization or mutualisation is the process by which a joint stock company changes legal form to a mutual organization or a cooperative, so that the majority of the stock is owned by employees or customers, thereafter known as members. 

Demutualization or demutualisation is the reverse process, whereby a mutual may convert itself to a joint-stock company. In the United States, this process became increasingly common in the 1980s as a result of deregulation. Conversion may be full, to a public company, or in many states, partial, to a mutual holding company.

<text>Krantikari Manuwadi Morcha (&quot;Revolutionary Manuvadi Front&quot;, KMM) is a Hindu ultra-conservative political organisation in India, formed in 2000.

In the Uttar Pradesh state assembly elections in 2002 KMM nominated Dara Singh, the accused of the murder of Australian Christian missionary Graham Staines, from the Muzaffarnagar and Ghaziabad constituencies. KMM also openly defended Singh&#x27;s actions. The nomination sparked protests from the Christian community, and the All India Christian Council demanded that KMM ought to be banned. The nomination was later withdrawn.

In 2012, the Krantikari Manuwadi Morcha along with Utkal Christian Council and Apostolic Churches Alliance approached the Supreme Court to challenge a 2009 Delhi High Court order decriminalising homosexual acts.

<doc id="1037298" wikidata="Q7453220" url="?curid=1037298" title="Serenity (Firefly episode)">
<text>&quot;Serenity&quot; is the original intended pilot for the American science fiction television series &quot;Firefly&quot; created by Joss Whedon. It was the first episode produced for the series and premiered as the show&#x27;s series finale on Friday, December 20, 2002 on Fox. With studio executives unsatisfied with the episode for the series premiere, the show&#x27;s second episode, &quot;The Train Job&quot;, was re-written and produced as a second pilot to be aired first. The episode shares its name with the 2005 feature film &quot;Serenity&quot;, which serves as a continuation to &quot;Firefly&quot;.

In the early 26th Century, Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and Zoe Washburne (Gina Torres) are survivors of their rebel unit in the Battle of Serenity Valley during the Unification War, in which their side lost. Six years later, they are eking out an existence on the edges of space in their &quot;Firefly&quot;-class spaceship &quot;Serenity&quot;, taking odd jobs even if they involve petty crime. They also take on passengers to supplement their income, including a man with a secret that will change the path of their lives forever.

In 2003, the episode won the award for &quot;Best Visual Effects in a Television Series&quot; from Visual Effects Society, and was nominated for a Hugo Award in 2003 for &quot;Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form&quot;.

== Plot ==

===Part 1===
In 2511, a squad of &quot;Independents&quot;, led by Sergeant Malcolm &quot;Mal&quot; Reynolds and Corporal Zoe Alleyne, fight in the Battle of Serenity Valley during the Unification War. Despite Mal&#x27;s insistence that the battle can be won with air support, Zoe receives orders to surrender from the leaders of the rebellion. Mal is forced to watch in horror as Alliance ships sweep the battlefield unopposed, destroying the rest of the Independents.

Six years later, Mal is the captain of his own transport ship, an older-model &quot;Firefly&quot;-class vessel he named &quot;Serenity&quot;, with Zoe as his second-in-command. The rest of the ship&#x27;s crew consists of Wash (Alan Tudyk), who is the pilot and Zoe&#x27;s husband; Kaylee (Jewel Staite), the engineer; and Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin), an untrustworthy gun-for-hire. Inara (Morena Baccarin), a &quot;Companion&quot; (a very high-class courtesan) who rents one of &quot;Serenity&quot;″s two shuttles, normally travels with them, but she is currently away on business.

While the crew are illegally salvaging some crates off a derelict Alliance spaceship, they are spotted by an Alliance cruiser. To escape capture, Mal has Wash deploy a fake distress beacon. The Alliance cruiser falls for the deception, but broadcasts a bulletin that a &quot;Firefly&quot;-class ship is carrying stolen Alliance goods.

The crew of &quot;Serenity&quot; travel to Persephone to deliver the stolen goods to Badger (Mark Sheppard), the small-time crime lord who hired them for the heist. However, Badger reneges on their deal after learning that the Alliance has put a bulletin on Mal&#x27;s crew. He also does not like the way Mal looks down on him. Mal decides to try selling the cargo to Patience, an old business associate who lives on Whitefall. Zoe has misgivings, since Patience shot Mal the last time they met, but Mal is desperate to get rid of the hot cargo. The crew picks up passengers before leaving Persephone for extra income, and Inara rejoins the ship. The new passengers are a preacher named Shepherd Book (Ron Glass), a bumbling man named Dobson (Carlos Jacott), and a wealthy doctor named Simon Tam (Sean Maher) who brings aboard a mysterious large crate.

En route to Whitefall, Wash discovers that someone on board sent a message hailing the nearest Alliance cruiser. Suspecting that Simon is the mole, Mal confronts him, only to discover that Dobson is actually an undercover Alliance lawman. Dobson surprises Mal by telling them it&#x27;s Simon he wants to arrest, not Mal. During the tense confrontation, a nervous Dobson accidentally shoots Kaylee in the stomach before being overpowered by Book, who manages to easily disarm and subdue him. When an Alliance cruiser orders them to dock for prisoner transfer, Simon threatens not to treat Kaylee if they do not flee. Mal reluctantly agrees (after being prodded by Inara to do so), but then has Jayne restrain Simon while he opens Simon&#x27;s mysterious crate, only to be surprised to find a naked young woman inside in cryonic sleep.

===Part 2===
The woman in the crate is River Tam (Summer Glau), Simon&#x27;s younger sister. Simon explains that his sister was a brilliant child prodigy who was sent to an elite, but secretive Alliance academy when she was fourteen. After River sent him an encoded letter for help, he discovered that the Alliance was experimenting on the academy students. Simon abandoned his career as a successful trauma surgeon to rescue her and spent all of his money to get her smuggled out of the academy. The Alliance wants River back very badly. Mal decides to proceed to Whitefall as planned and drop off both the goods and the Tam siblings.

Mal tells Jayne to interrogate Dobson to find out what he told the Alliance about them. Once Jayne finds out that the Alliance knows nothing, Dobson tries to bribe him, offering him enough money to buy his own ship.

Soon after, they discover that a Reaver ship is approaching. Zoe explains to Simon that &quot;If they take the ship, they&#x27;ll rape us to death, eat our flesh and sew our skins into their clothing. And if we&#x27;re very very lucky, they&#x27;ll do it in that order.&quot; Luckily, the Reaver ship passes by without incident.

&quot;Serenity&quot; lands on Whitefall. Not trusting Patience, Mal sends Jayne to take out her hidden sniper while he and Zoe meet Patience and some of her henchmen in a barren valley. Mal gives Patience a sample of the cargo (&quot;Genuine A grade foodstuffs... protein, vitamins... immunization supplements&quot; that looks like a chocolate). As expected, Patience tries to kill them after learning where they have buried the rest, but Mal, Zoe and Jayne gun down Patience&#x27;s men. Mal leaves Patience alive, but takes the money he was promised. Jayne is warned by Wash that the Reavers turned around and followed them to Whitefall.

Meanwhile, back on the ship Dobson escapes, knocking out Book and grabbing River. Mal returns and calmly shoots Dobson in the head, dumping his body off the ship as they start to lift off, the Reavers hot on their tail.

Mal orders Inara, Book, Simon and River to go to Inara&#x27;s shuttle, just in case the ship is boarded. Jayne carries the still-convalescing Kaylee to the engine room, and Book offers to help her. With Jayne and Book carrying out Kaylee&#x27;s instructions, Wash is able to pull off a &quot;Crazy Ivan&quot; (VIFF), and &quot;Serenity&quot; manages to shake the pursuing Reavers.

Jayne tells Mal that they should dump the siblings since Dobson had told him that the Alliance will keep coming after River. Mal asks Jayne why he did not turn against him. Jayne responds that the money Dobson offered was not enough. Mal suggests to Simon that he and River might be safer on the move, and points out that &quot;Serenity&quot; is always moving, and in need of a qualified ship&#x27;s medic. Simon reluctantly accepts his offer.

== Deleted scenes ==
This episode has two deleted scenes.
* An alternate opening scene showing the aftermath of the Battle of Serenity Valley. Most of the Independent soldiers are dead. Mal and the survivors witness the long-awaited arrival of the medships; when Zoe says &quot;Thank God&quot; for the ships&#x27; arrival, Mal bitterly asks whose side God is on. This scene was deleted because the studio wanted a more action-packed opening scene. This scene would have explained why Mal, who is seen kissing a cross on his neck during the battle, lost his faith in God.
* A scene where Simon is taking care of the wounded Kaylee. Book asks why Simon chose to come aboard Serenity and Simon replies that it seemed disreputable. Book suggests that Simon lacks a knowledge of history. Simon researches the Battle of Serenity Valley on his encyclopedia and Zoe tells him about how many soldiers died during the battle and its aftermath. She tells Simon that Mal will not kill him unless he&#x27;s got no other option. When Simon asks why Mal named the ship after such a horrible battle, Zoe replies that &quot;once you&#x27;ve been in Serenity, you never leave.&quot;

== Arc significance ==
This episode introduces a major story arc of the short-lived series: that of River and Simon. It reveals Simon&#x27;s deep, selfless love for his sister and that his life is now defined by her.

Despite the script stating that Dobson is killed by Mal, Joss Whedon had planned to bring the character back. Although the series was cancelled, Dobson coming back for revenge was a key part of the plot in &quot;&quot;, a three-issue comic book miniseries intended to bridge the television series and the movie &quot;Serenity&quot;.

== Themes ==
As Joss Whedon points out in the commentary for this episode, every show he does is &quot;about creating family&quot;. To achieve the sense of family, he centers some action around a dinner scene at a table, and directs warm light into the faces of the characters. Strengthening this theme is the interaction between Simon and his sister River. Simon has done a selfless act in rescuing his sister, and his life is now defined by it. Whedon wanted to show a relationship like that that was not a parent-child relationship.

Another theme is the fusion of Asian and frontier culture. As Brett Matthews said, you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better mission statement for the show than the shot of Mal with a Western tin cup and chopsticks. He then contrasts this to the tall, vertical Alliance cruiser that detects them, as he wanted to show how inefficient the Alliance government was.

He also wanted to show a lifestyle that was very tactile and physical, and contrast it to the lifestyle of the contemporary audience where things &quot;fall in your lap.&quot;

== Production ==
Production on the pilot episode began on March 20, 2002. The episode&#x27;s beginning sequence was reshot before it aired, to provide more of the &quot;action&quot; that Fox wanted. The pilot reportedly cost more than $8 million.

Rebecca Gayheart initially played the role of Inara Serra, but was replaced by Baccarin early in the episode&#x27;s filming. In anticipation of the role being recast, Whedon shot scenes of the character interacting with the crew in singles, so the only portions that would have to be reshot would be the shots of Inara.

After the Reavers are introduced, the screen goes to near black to end the act. Whedon wanted to give the audience time to &quot;breathe&quot; before the beginning of commercials, but a true black would automatically cue the ads, so he went with a color that was as close to black as possible without causing this.

== Guest cast ==
* Carlos Jacott as Lawrence Dobson, an Alliance &quot;Fed.&quot; This is also one of Whedon&#x27;s &quot;hat tricks&quot; for the episode: an actor that has appeared on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;, as well as &quot;Firefly&quot;.
* Mark Sheppard as Badger, the crime boss located on Persephone.
* Andy Umberger as the captain of the Alliance cruiser &quot;Dortmunder.&quot; He is also a &quot;hat trick.&quot; In &quot;Buffy&quot;, though, he wore the heavy makeup of an important recurring character, the demon D&#x27;Hoffryn, Anyanka&#x27;s boss, so he&#x27;s barely recognizable, as Fillion notes in the DVD commentary.
* Philip Sternberg as Inara&#x27;s client.
* Eddie Adams as Bendis, one of the members of Mal and Zoe&#x27;s unit in the Battle of Serenity Valley.
* Colin Patrick Lynch as Radio Operator.
* Bonnie Bartlett as Patience.

<text>Incredicoaster is a steel launched roller coaster located at Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, California, United States. Manufactured by Intamin, the ride was originally opened to the public as California Screamin&#x27; in early 2001. It is the only roller coaster with an inversion at the Disneyland Resort and it is the fastest, reaching a maximum speed of . With a track length of , Incredicoaster is the sixth-longest steel roller coaster in the world.

California Screamin&#x27; permanently closed on the late evening of January 7, 2018 for a transformation and reopened as the Incredicoaster with the debut of Pixar Pier on June 22, 2018. Its theme is inspired by &quot;The Incredibles&quot; film franchise.

==History==
In October 1998, following months of construction on the new California Adventure theme park next to Disneyland, Disney announced additional details about the park&#x27;s rides and attractions set to open in 2001. Among them would be a state-of-the-art launched roller coaster named California Screamin&#x27;, which uses linear induction motor (LIM) launch technology to propel its riders to a maximum speed of . Although made of steel, the ride would be designed to resemble a classic wooden coaster, and it would include a vertical loop in the signature shape of Mickey Mouse&#x27;s head.

California Screamin&#x27; debuted with the park&#x27;s grand opening on February 8, 2001. Designed by Werner Stengel and built by Intamin, it features a track length of , making it the sixth-longest steel coaster in the world and third-longest in the US behind Fury 325 at Carowinds and Millennium Force at Cedar Point. Materials used to build the attraction included of concrete for the footers, of electric cables, of conductors, and of steel. It also became the longest roller coaster in the world to feature an inversion after the vertical loop on Son of Beast at Kings Island was removed in 2006.

In addition to the LIM launch that propels the train up the first hill, an additional LIM Boost is used on the main lift midway through the ride. These motors are used in lieu of a traditional lift hill chain. The coaster is one of Disney Parks&#x27; fastest attractions, accelerating guests from zero to in four seconds. Since the resort was located next to a residential area, Disney had installed tunnels throughout the ride to block the screams from riders and reduce noise complaints from nearby residents of Anaheim and neighboring Garden Grove.

Like several other coasters in Disney Parks, California Screamin&#x27; featured an onboard audio soundtrack during the ride, created by Gary Hoey and George Wilkins. On January 3, 2007, as part of the &quot;Rockin&#x27; Both Parks&quot; campaign, the audio track was temporarily replaced by a remixed version of &quot;Around the World&quot; by Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the attraction was renamed Rockin&#x27; California Screamin&#x27;. This was promoted along with Rockin&#x27; Space Mountain, a similar change made to Space Mountain in Disneyland, though that ride&#x27;s audio was changed to the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; cover version of &quot;Higher Ground&quot;. The standard audio track was restored when the campaign ended.

After the refurbishment of Disney California Adventure, from 2008 to 2009 the Mickey Mouse head located behind the vertical loop was changed to a sunburst icon with the Paradise Pier logo.

On July 15, 2017, Disney announced a complete renovation of Paradise Pier, renaming it Pixar Pier. Meanwhile, rumors began to circulate that California Screamin&#x27; would be rethemed to Pixar Animation Studios&#x27; &quot;The Incredibles&quot;. On November 2, it was confirmed that the ride would be remodeled. California Screamin&#x27; closed on January 8, 2018, for the transformation into Incredicoaster. The remodel would include a new queue line, engineering reboots of the existing launch system, new storyline, enclosed scream tunnels and a new soundtrack. The new trains were unveiled in April. Incredicoaster opened on June 23, 2018, to coincide with the release of &quot;Incredibles 2&quot;.

==Pre-show and ride==
TV screens display news footage of the Incredibles and Edna Mode being interviewed for a classic roller coaster&#x27;s rebranding as Incredicoaster. While they are being interviewed, Jack-Jack uses his unpredictable superpowers, much to his family&#x27;s frustration and Edna&#x27;s amusement. As the guests board the cars and take off from the station, Elastigirl asks Edna to look after Jack-Jack. The guests pass by the VIP room where Edna watches Jack-Jack as he teleports around. Moments later, Edna announces that Jack-Jack has escaped. The Incredibles then take off throughout the ride trying to catch Jack-Jack as he uses his vast array of super powers to &quot;attack&quot; certain points on the ride as the coaster arrives in the launch area.

After Dash gives the countdown, the train is launched at 55 mph into the first tunnel, accompanied by a stream of water jets that glow red to simulate Dash&#x27;s super speed. In the first tunnel, Dash tries to use his super speed to catch Jack-Jack, while Jack-Jack shoots lasers from his eyes. The train then exits the tunnel as it descends the drop and rises uphill onto the first block brake and then navigates a right hand turn around Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind before passing under the outbound track and climbing up the main lift, which uses LIMs to propel the train. When new, this was the first use of Linear Induction Motor (LIM) technology that allowed a roller coaster vehicle to travel on an inclined angle.

As the train crests the hill, it enters the second tunnel, where Elastigirl tries using her stretching powers to grab Jack-Jack while he is phasing in and out of the tunnel wall. Past the crest of the hill, Mr. Incredible has used his super strength to smash through the wall and is trying to catch Jack-Jack by offering him a cookie, after which the train drops out of the tunnel. Exiting this tunnel, the ride goes through a three-quarter turn before diving into the vertical loop. Following this, the train dives through the third tunnel, which Jack-Jack has set ablaze with his fire powers, forcing Violet to put an invisible forcefield around the tunnel to put out the flames and keep the riders safe as they make another loop around the Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind.

After hitting the second block brake section, the track passes through a series of airtime filled bunny hop hills as it passes over Toy Story Midway Mania, where Jack-Jack makes multiple versions of himself pop up everywhere. The train then rises into the third and final block brake section. After dropping off the block brakes the train traverses through a 270-degree downward spiral that leads into a straight section of track with one last bunny hop. Which is followed by a final 100-degree left turn into the final brake run, as Jack-Jack makes it back safely. This time he has increased in size, but Edna manages to keep him calm by giving him a cookie. The train then makes another left turn before returning to the station.

==Safety design==
The original safety announcements were recorded by Dee Bradley Baker. On November 5, 2010, the announcements were updated with the voice of Neil Patrick Harris. Baker and Harris also recorded audio for the launch, counting down for guests. There are 108 acoustic devices to play the onboard audio aboard each train, including high-range speakers in the headrests, mid-range speakers near riders&#x27; ears, and subwoofers under each rider&#x27;s seat.

The tubes through which the coaster shoots enable the coaster to comply with Orange County sound ordinances, projecting noise in the direction of the park, in addition to concealing scenes with characters.

==Cast==
* Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible 
* Holly Hunter as Elastigirl
* Sarah Vowell as Violet Parr
* Huck Milner as Dash Parr
* Brad Bird as Edna Mode

==Incidents==

In August 2001, Dr. David Heber, a Milwaukee surgeon, suffered a neurological disorder and whiplash after his restraint locked at eye level. He sued Disney in 2003, alleging equipment failure, lack of lubrication and ride operators failing to notice his unlocked restraint. However, Heber lost.

On July 29, 2005, multiple guests were injured when the purple train rear-ended the orange train. Of the 48 guests aboard the two trains, 15 were taken to the hospital for treatment of minor injuries. The accident occurred on the section of track about short of the loading station. A full ride stop was activated with the orange train stopped. The brake segment that was supposed to have stopped the purple train failed, and the purple train continued until it collided with the stopped orange train. An investigation showed that a faulty brake valve, installed a few days earlier by Disney (not by the ride manufacturer Intamin) was the cause.

On July 22, 2011, 23 people were rescued from California Screamin&#x27; by firefighters when a rider&#x27;s backpack fell out of a train and landed on the track, causing the orange train to valley between the loop and the next block section. It reopened two days later after the train was winched up the next hill, had its damaged wheels replaced and was allowed to complete the circuit.

On August 6, 2016, passengers on the ride were stranded for 45 minutes before being rescued when a fallen purse triggered an automatic stop.

<doc id="1037302" wikidata="Q332223" url="?curid=1037302" title="Fast-roping">
<text>Fast-roping is a technique for descending a thick rope, allowing troops to deploy from a helicopter in places where the aircraft cannot touch down. 

The person holds onto the rope with gloved hands (with or without using their feet) and slides down it. Several people can slide down the same rope simultaneously, provided that there is a gap of about between them, so that each one has time to get out of the way when they reach the ground.

Fast roping is quicker than abseiling (rappelling), although more dangerous, particularly if the person is carrying a heavy load, because the rope is not attached to them with a descender. The technique is particularly useful for naval infantry, who can use it to board ships at sea.

== History ==
The technique was first developed by the UK with British rope manufacturer Marlow Ropes, and first used in combat during the Falklands War. The original rope was made of thick nylon that could be used in a manner akin to a fireman&#x27;s pole. The special ropes used today are braided (plaited), producing a pattern on the outer circumference that is not smooth and so is easier to grip. Originally, each person would hold the rope for the next person, but this has been phased out.

The rope must be thick, typically 40 mm (1.57 in) diameter, to prevent it from being wildly jerked about from the rotor blast of the helicopter. Some types have a weighted core, the ballast helping to combat the blast effect.

===Glove techniques===
Fast-ropers use heat-resistant gloves to protect their hands from the heat of friction while descending. Such gloves are generally not dextrous enough to be useful after the descent has been completed, though specialized gloves have been developed for this purpose. More often, a glove-inside-glove technique is used, with tactical gloves worn inside heavy leather metalworking gloves. After descending the rope, the wearer removes the outer gloves to regain dexterity.

===Use of feet===

In the U.S. Marine Corps, fast-ropers are trained to control the speed of descent by using their legs and feet in addition to their hands (instructors claim that some Marines have let go of their rope because their gloves became too hot, causing injury). Deployment of around 25 fast-ropers onto a ship can take about 30 seconds.

The British military advises against use of the feet as this can make the descent for following personnel more dangerous: boot polish or the leather of the boot can make the rope extremely slippery.

<doc id="1037321" wikidata="Q586807" url="?curid=1037321" title="Paula Kelly (actress)">
<text>Paula Alma Kelly (October 21, 1942 – February 8, 2020) was an American actress, singer, dancer and choreographer in films, television and theatre. Kelly&#x27;s career began during the mid–1960s in theatre, making her Broadway debut as Mrs. Veloz in the 1964 musical &quot;Something More!&quot;, alongside Barbara Cook. Kelly&#x27;s other Broadway credits include &quot;The Dozens&quot; (1969), &quot;Paul Sills&#x27; Story Theatre&quot; (1971), &quot;Ovid&#x27;s Metamorphoses&quot; (1971), and &quot;Sophisticated Ladies&quot; (1981), based on the music of Duke Ellington, appearing with Gregory Hines and Phyllis Hyman.

==Early life and education==
Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Kelly was one of three daughters born to Ruth and Lehman Kelly, a jazz musician. By age six, Kelly&#x27;s family had relocated to Harlem neighborhood of New York City. For high school, Kelly attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art, majoring in music. Kelly continued her studies at the Juilliard School of Music, where she majored in dance under Martha Hill. Graduating in 1964 with an M.S. degree, Kelly performed as a soloist with major modern dance companies such as Martha Graham, Donald McKayle, and Alvin Ailey.

==Career==
 Kelly performed as guest artist and sometimes assistant choreographer for numerous television musical specials, including &quot;Sammy and Friends&quot; (starring Sammy Davis Jr.); co-choreographer of the BBC production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, in which she also performed the role of Tiger-Lily; Quincy Jones&#x27; TV tribute to Duke Ellington, &quot;We Love You Madly&quot;; &quot;The Richard Pryor Show&quot;; and Gene Kelly&#x27;s &quot;New York, New York&quot;, in which the two Kellys performed a duet.

Kelly performed a dance solo at the 41st Academy Awards for the nominated title song from &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968). She appeared on the London stage in &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; with dancer and actress Juliet Prowse, for which Kelly won the London Variety Award for Best Supporting Actress. She starred in the record-breaking west coast premiere of &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me, I Can&#x27;t Cope&quot; at the Mark Taper Forum, for which she was awarded the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award, Variety, and the first of three NAACP Image Awards. Kelly posed for a pictorial in the August 1969 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, photographed by Lawrence Schiller.

Kelly&#x27;s film credits include the Bob Fosse-directed film &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;; &quot;Soylent Green&quot;; &quot;The Spook Who Sat by the Door&quot;; &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;; &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot;; &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot;; &quot;Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling&quot;; &quot;Drop Squad&quot;; and &quot;Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored&quot;.

Kelly had a regular role as Liz Williams on the first season of the sitcom &quot;Night Court&quot;, for which she received an Emmy Award nomination. Kelly also guest-starred in a variety of television movies and sitcoms, including &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Good Times&quot;, &quot;Any Day Now&quot; and in the Oprah Winfrey-produced TV mini-series &quot;The Women of Brewster Place&quot; (based on the 1982 novel of the same name by Gloria Naylor), in which she portrayed one half of a lesbian couple (with Lonette McKee) struggling against homophobia in an inner-city ghetto. Kelly was nominated for a second Emmy for her role in &quot;The Women of Brewster Place&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
On September 15, 1985, Kelly married British film director Don Chaffey. Chaffey died in November 1990.

Her partner since 2003 was George Parkington.

Kelly died of heart failure on February 8, 2020, at age 77.

<text>In geometry, the kappa curve or Gutschoven&#x27;s curve is a two-dimensional algebraic curve resembling the Greek letter . The kappa curve was first studied by Gérard van Gutschoven around 1662. In the history of mathematics, it is remembered as one of the first examples of Isaac Barrow&#x27;s application of rudimentary calculus methods to determine the tangent of a curve. Isaac Newton and Johann Bernoulli continued the studies of this curve subsequently.

Using the Cartesian coordinate system it can be expressed as
:formula_1
or, using parametric equations,
:formula_2

In polar coordinates its equation is even simpler:
:formula_3

It has two vertical asymptotes at , shown as dashed blue lines in the figure at right.

<text>Bolliger &amp; Mabillard, officially Bolliger &amp; Mabillard Consulting Engineers, Inc. and often abbreviated B&amp;M, is a roller coaster design consultancy based in Monthey, Switzerland. The company was founded in 1988 by engineers Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard, both of whom had worked for Giovanola.

B&amp;M has pioneered several new ride technologies, most notably the inverted roller coaster and the box-section track. In 2016, the company completed its 100th roller coaster. B&amp;M currently produces ten types of coaster models: Stand-Up Coaster, Inverted Coaster, Floorless Coaster, Flying Coaster, Hyper Coaster, Dive Coaster, Sitting Coaster, Wing Coaster, Family Coaster, and most recently, the Surf Coaster. Though B&amp;M has not used the term, the company has also manufactured three giga coasters.

==History==

=== Roots ===
Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard started working for Giovanola, a manufacturing company which supplied rides to Intamin, in the 1970s. During their time at Giovanola, they helped design the company&#x27;s first stand-up roller coaster, &quot;Shockwave&quot; (at Six Flags Magic Mountain). They also worked on other projects, such as &quot;Z-Force&quot; (at Six Flags Great America). Bolliger &amp; Mabillard left Giovanola, but the company continued to use that track design; the company&#x27;s roller coasters &quot;Goliath&quot; (at Six Flags Magic Mountain) and &quot;Titan&quot; (at Six Flags Over Texas), use a track style very similar to B&amp;M&#x27;s.

=== Launch ===
In 1987, Giovanola underwent a change of management, and the pair decided to leave and create their own company. At the time, B&amp;M employed four people, including two draftsmen: Bolliger and Mabillard. When B&amp;M was created, the pair had agreed not to make any more amusement attractions. However, Robert Mampe, Six Flags Great America&#x27;s staff engineer, had worked with both men during the construction of &quot;Z-Force&quot;; he contacted the newly-formed company and asked them to reconfigure the cars for its Giovanola-built, Intamin bobsled coaster, to be relocated from Six Flags Great Adventure.

Following that project, Mampe asked the new company to design and build a stand-up roller coaster for Six Flags Great America, similar to &quot;Shockwave&quot; at Six Flags Magic Mountain. B&amp;M accepted the offer and hired two more draftsmen. But B&amp;M had a problem regarding how and where to manufacture the track pieces for the roller coaster. With the favorable history of the work done by Clermont Steel Fabricators (on &quot;Vortex&quot;, Kings Island, and &quot;Shockwave&quot;, Six Flags Great America), Walter Bolliger went to the steel plant and asked if they would be interested in manufacturing the track. Clermont Steel Fabricators accepted, and to this day, manufactures all of B&amp;M&#x27;s roller coaster track pieces for all of North America. Now with a company to manufacture the track, B&amp;M built its first roller coaster, a stand-up roller coaster, &quot;Iron Wolf&quot;, which opened in 1990 at Six Flags Great America. Two years later, Bolliger &amp; Mabillard built another project for Six Flags Great America, &quot;&quot;, the world&#x27;s first inverted roller coaster, which brought them to prominence in the industry.

=== Development ===
Bolliger &amp; Mabillard also invented the Floorless Coaster and the Dive Coaster. The company also built its first launched roller coaster, the &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot;, which is at Islands of Adventure. In 2010, B&amp;M unveiled its new Wing Coaster and premiered the prototype model, named &quot;Raptor&quot;, at Gardaland in 2011. It has two seats on each side on the car that hang riders over the sides of the track. there are fifteen in operation. In 2015, B&amp;M constructed &quot;Thunderbird&quot; at Holiday World &amp; Splashin&#x27; Safari, its first in-house launched coaster.

By 2010, B&amp;M employed twelve engineers, twelve draftsmen and two draftswomen. The company has made other contributions to the roller coaster industry. The company built the trains for the &quot;Psyclone&quot;, a now-demolished wooden roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain. The trains were later used on the park&#x27;s &quot;Colossus&quot; wooden roller coaster (until it was refurbished by Rocky Mountain Construction), but were only used during October each year. The trains faced backward and usually raced against trains on the second track, which ran forward.

In 2013, the company launched the construction of Banshee, the world&#x27;s longest inverted roller coaster. B&amp;M supplied new trains for Steel Dragon 2000, built by D. H. Morgan Manufacturing in 2000. As of 2012, Bolliger &amp; Mabillard had 85 operating roller coasters worldwide. Of these, twenty-two were listed among that year&#x27;s &quot;Amusement Today&quot; Golden Ticket Awards Top 50 Steel Coasters List for 2012 and five were in the top 10.

By 2016, Bolliger &amp; Mabillard had completed its 100th coaster, and had built more roller coasters than any other manufacturer on the Golden Ticket Awards Steel Coasters list.

==Features==

Bolliger &amp; Mabillard currently manufactures ten different roller coaster styles: Stand-Up Coaster, Inverted Coaster, Floorless Coaster, Flying Coaster, Hyper Coaster, Dive Coaster, Sitting Coaster, Wing Coaster, Family Coaster and most recently, the . Bolliger &amp; Mabillard has been involved in developing new technologies and concepts in roller coasters almost since its inception. It has often worked with engineer Werner Stengel and with designers and management of client theme parks.

===Lift hills===
Early Bolliger &amp; Mabillard coasters feature an element known as a &quot;pre-drop&quot;, a short drop after the top of the lift hill and before the start of the first drop, designed to reduce stress on the lift chain. The flat section between the pre-drop and the first drop serves as a shelf to support the weight of the train, reducing related stresses on the chain. On most coasters without a pre-drop, the weight of the train tends to pull on the lift chain as it begins its descent because the latter half of the train is still being lifted by the chain. Pre-drops have not been used on the company&#x27;s Dive or Flying coasters, or on hyper coasters built after 1999. &quot;OzIris&quot; at Parc Astérix was the first B&amp;M inverted roller coaster that does not feature a pre-drop. Ever since, no coaster built by B&amp;M has featured a pre-drop because the chain accelerates to acquire the same speed as the train when it is being taken over by gravity after it passes the crest.

===Trains===
Most of Bolliger &amp; Mabillard&#x27;s roller coaster trains use four-abreast seating. Each car has one row of four seats, while the train length can vary between coasters. All of the company&#x27;s coaster models, except the Dive Coaster, Wing Coaster, Family Inverted Coaster and Surf Coaster use this configuration. The Dive Coaster uses six, seven, eight or ten-abreast seating, with two or three rows of seats. For example, &quot;Griffon&quot; at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, uses ten seats in three rows, while &quot;Krake&quot; at Heide Park uses six-across seating in three rows. On recent hyper coaster projects, B&amp;M has used a new car design that has two rows of two seats; the two seats in the rear of the car pushed out from the centerline so that the four seats resemble a V formation. This formation has only been used on &quot;Behemoth&quot; at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, &quot;Diamondback&quot; at Kings Island, Thunder Striker at Carowinds, and &quot;&quot; at PortAventura Park, in the resort PortAventura World. In 2013, B&amp;M introduced a new car design that has two rows of two seats, however, they are not in a V formation.

All B&amp;M hyper coasters use a type of restraint called a &quot;T-bar&quot; or &quot;Clamshell&quot; restraint, which consists of bar with a cushioned lap bar with two handles for riders to hold on to. This type of restraint generally does not use a seat belt, however seat belts have been added to &quot;Behemoth&quot; and &quot;Leviathan&quot; at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, &quot;Diamondback&quot; and &quot;Orion&quot; at Kings Island, and &quot;Intimidator&quot; and &quot;Fury 325&quot; at Carowinds. Bolliger &amp; Mabillard also uses over-the-shoulder restraints, in that the restraint is placed over the riders&#x27; shoulders and sits and extends to the riders&#x27; laps. This type of restraint is used on Dive, Inverted, Sitting, Flying, Floorless, Stand-up and Wing Coasters. Bolliger &amp; Mabillard has recently begun using a vest like over the shoulder restraint, which reduces headbanging found on the older, more common padded over the shoulder restraints. These have been met with some criticism from the coaster community, due to the nature in which they tighten during the ride; stapling riders to their seats, resulting in less airtime (negative g-forces) being felt.
===Track===
A notable feature of Bolliger &amp; Mabillard roller coasters is the box-section track. The running rails are connected to a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a one-of-a-kind whooshing sound, which is sometimes nicknamed the “B&amp;M roar” by roller coaster enthusiasts. However, on some Bolliger &amp; Mabillard roller coasters, such as &quot;Talon&quot; at Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom and &quot;GateKeeper&quot; at Cedar Point, the track is filled with a proprietary sound dampening material to reduce this noise.

Also, depending on the model of the roller coaster, the track size can vary. Models such as the Flying, Wing and Dive Coaster have heavier trains which require a larger track size while models with lighter trains, such as the Stand-Up and Hyper Coaster, do not and use a smaller sized track.

===Brakes===
As of 2016, Bolliger &amp; Mabillard uses three types of braking systems: friction, magnetic, and water.

====Friction brakes====
When B&amp;M was first founded, the linear magnetic eddy brake had yet to be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted on the vehicle chassis between the wheel assemblies. On the brakes, similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train come into contact with the brakes, friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.
====Magnetic brakes====
Magnetic brakes provide smoother deceleration than friction brakes; most B&amp;M roller coasters built after 2001 (starting with Nitro) have at least one set of magnetic brakes. Magnetic brakes do not make contact with the train. Metal fins that run parallel to the train are fitted on the vehicle chassis between the wheel assemblies. As the fins pass through the brakes, the magnetic field created by the brakes slows the train. Magnetic brakes have also been used as an alternate type of trim brake on B&amp;M roller coasters such as &quot;Leviathan&quot; at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland.

====Water brakes====
Water brakes were first introduced on &quot;SheiKra&quot; at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in 2005. Water brakes can only be used when a splashdown element, in which a body of water surrounds a section of track, is present within the layout of the roller coaster. When scoops on the last car of each train come in contact with the surrounding water, the train slows down and the water is sprayed several feet into the air behind it.

==Notable roller coasters==





According to the Roller Coaster DataBase, Bolliger &amp; Mabillard has built 127 roller coasters since its founding in 1988, beginning with Iron Wolf, which opened at Six Flags Great America in 1990. Some have either been relocated, renamed or closed. In North America, B&amp;M coaster designs are manufactured by Ohio company Clermont Steel Fabricators.

<doc id="1037330" wikidata="Q613649" url="?curid=1037330" title="2004 Slovenian parliamentary election">
<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Slovenia on Sunday, 3 October 2004 to elect the 90 deputies of the National Assembly. A total of 1,390 male and female candidates ran in the election, organized into 155 lists. The lists were compiled both by official political parties and the groups of voters not registered as political parties. Five candidates applied for the seat of the representative of the Hungarian &quot;national community&quot; (as minorities are officially called in Slovenia) and only one candidate applied for the seat of the representative of the Italian national community. In the previous election (2000), fewer than 1000 candidates on 155 lists applied.

==Electoral system==
In Slovenia, elections in the National Assembly are held in eight voting units, each of which further divides into 11 districts. Different candidates apply in each of the eighty-eight districts. From each of eight units, 11 deputies get elected; however, not necessarily one deputy from each district (from some districts nobody gets elected, from others up to four candidates enter the parliament). Deputy&#x27;s mandates are distributed at two levels: at the level of the voting unit and at the level of the state. In practice, at the level of voting units two thirds of mandates get allotted, while one third gets allotted at the level of the state. In this manner, 88 mandates get distributed. The remaining two seats are assigned to the representatives of the Italian and Hungarian minorities, which get elected separately (in the ninth and tenth voting units) by the Borda count. Altogether, 90 deputies are elected in the parliament. The election threshold for a party to enter the parliament is four per cent.

<text>Preston is a provincial electoral district in the Halifax Regional Municipality in Nova Scotia, Canada. It has existed from 1993 to 2013 and since 2021 and elects one member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. 

The electoral district includes the majority African Nova Scotian communities of North Preston and East Preston, plus the communities of Cherry Brook, Lake Loon, Lake Echo, Mineville, Montague Gold Mines, Westphal, and part of the Tam O&#x27;Shanter Ridge neighbourhood of Dartmouth.

The electoral district was created in 1991 and was conceived to provide representation to the area&#x27;s rural Black community. The electoral district was abolished following the 2012 electoral boundary review when the provincial government wanted all of the province&#x27;s ridings to have equal representation. It was largely replaced by the new electoral district of Preston-Dartmouth. The riding was re-created following the 2019 boundary review, mostly out of Preston-Dartmouth, but also out of parts of Waverley-Fall River-Beaver Bank, Cole Harbour-Portland Valley, Eastern Shore and a small part of Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley. The riding was reinstated after a court challenge that also re-instated the province&#x27;s three protected Acadians ridings.

It was the first riding in all of Nova Scotia to feature an entirely African Nova Scotian slate of candidates in the 2021 provincial election.

<doc id="1037341" wikidata="Q3408612" url="?curid=1037341" title="The Duchess of Malfi">
<text>The Duchess of Malfi (originally published as The Tragedy of the Dutchesse of Malfy) is a Jacobean revenge tragedy written by English dramatist John Webster in 1612–1613. It was first performed privately at the Blackfriars Theatre, then later to a larger audience at The Globe, in 1613–1614.

Published in 1623, the play is loosely based on events that occurred between 1508 and 1513 surrounding Giovanna d&#x27;Aragona, Duchess of Amalfi (d. 1511), whose father, Enrico d&#x27;Aragona, Marquis of Gerace, was an illegitimate son of Ferdinand I of Naples. As in the play, she secretly married Antonio Beccadelli di Bologna after the death of her first husband Alfonso I Piccolomini, Duke of Amalfi.

The play begins as a love story, when the Duchess marries beneath her class, and ends as a nightmarish tragedy as her two brothers undertake their revenge, destroying themselves in the process. Jacobean drama continued the trend of stage violence and horror set by Elizabethan tragedy, under the influence of Seneca. The complexity of some of the play&#x27;s characters, particularly Bosola and the Duchess, and Webster&#x27;s poetic language, have led many critics to consider &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; among the greatest tragedies of English renaissance drama.

==Characters==
*The Duchess – The protagonist, sister to Ferdinand and the Cardinal. At the beginning she is a widow whose brothers take every precaution to keep from marriage, though later she secretly marries Antonio, and for this her brothers arrange to have her strangled. She is described as having a sweet countenance and noble virtue, unlike her brothers. She is also witty and clever, helping her keep up with her brothers&#x27; banter, and has a tenderness and warmth which they lack. She has three children, two sons and a daughter by Antonio. (There is an inconsistency surrounding earlier children by her deceased husband, put down to a careless mistake by Webster.) Based on Giovanna d&#x27;Aragona, Duchess of Amalfi
*Antonio Bologna – Antonio returned from France, full of scorn for the Italian courtiers whom he sees as more corrupt than the French. Antonio is the steward of the Duchess of Malfi&#x27;s palace. His honesty and good judgment of character are traits well known to the other characters. He accepts the Duchess&#x27; proposal of marriage because of her disposition rather than her beauty. Her marrying beneath her status is a problem, however, and their marriage has to remain a secret, as Antonio shares neither her title nor her money.
*Delio – A courtier, who tries to woo Julia. Based on Matteo Bandello&#x27;s self-depiction under this name, his purpose is to be the sounding board for his friend Antonio. Because he asks so many pertinent questions, he serves as a source of important information to the audience, and is privy to the secrets of Antonio&#x27;s marriage and children.
*Daniel de Bosola – A former servant of the Cardinal, now returned from a sentence in the galleys for murder. Publicly rejected by his previous employer the Cardinal, he is sent by Ferdinand to spy on the Duchess as her Provisor of Horse. (Ferdinand hopes to keep her away from marriage.) Bosola is involved in the murder of the Duchess, her children, Cariola, Antonio, the Cardinal, Ferdinand, and a servant. Witnessing the nobility of the Duchess and Antonio facing their deaths, he finally feels guilty, and seeks to avenge them. This change of heart makes him the play&#x27;s most complex character. A malcontent and cynic, he makes numerous critical comments on the nature of Renaissance society. (He is based on the historical Daniele de Bozolo, about whom little is known.)
*The Cardinal – The brother to the Duchess and Ferdinand. A corrupt, icy cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church who keeps a mistress. He has arranged a spy (Bosola) to spy upon his sister – all this on the quiet, however, leaving others ignorant of his plotting. Of remorse, love, loyalty, or even greed, he knows nothing, and his reasons for hating his sister are a mystery. (Historically, his name was Luigi d&#x27;Aragona.)
*Ferdinand – The Duke of Calabria and twin brother of the Duchess. Unlike his rational brother the Cardinal, Ferdinand has rages and violent outbursts disproportionate to the perceived offence. As a result of his regret for hiring Bosola to kill the Duchess, he gradually loses his sanity—he believes he is a wolf and digs up graves (lycanthropia). (In reality, his name was Carlo, Marquis of Gerace.)
*Castruchio (Castruccio) – An old lord. His name plays on the word &quot;castrated&quot;, suggesting impotence. He&#x27;s the conventional elderly man with a young, unfaithful wife (Julia). He is genial and easygoing, attempting to stay on good terms with all.
*Roderigo – A courtier
*Grisolan – A courtier
*Silvio – A courtier
*Pescara – A marquis, possibly Fernando d&#x27;Avalos
*Cariola – The Duchess&#x27;s waiting-woman who is privy to her secrets. She witnesses the Duchess&#x27;s wedding and delivers her children. She dies tragically by strangling following the murder of the Duchess and the youngest children. Her name plays on the Italian &quot;carriolo&quot;, meaning &quot;trundle-bed&quot;, where personal servants would have slept.
*Julia – Castruchio&#x27;s wife and the Cardinal&#x27;s mistress. She dies at the Cardinal&#x27;s hands from a poisoned Bible.
*Malateste – A hanger-on at the Cardinal&#x27;s court. The name means &#x27;headache&#x27;. Referred to as a &quot;mere stick of sugar candy&quot; by the Duchess, he is yet another interchangeable courtier serving the sycophantic court.
*Doctor – Sent for to diagnose Ferdinand&#x27;s madness and his supposed &quot;lycanthropia&quot;.

There are also minor roles including courtiers, servants, officers, a mistress, the Duchess&#x27;s children, executioners, etc.

==Synopsis==
The play is set in the court of Malfi (Amalfi), Italy, from 1504 to 1510. The recently widowed Duchess falls in love with Antonio, a lowly steward. Her brothers, Ferdinand and the Cardinal, forbid her from remarrying, seeking to defend their inheritance and desperate to avoid a degrading association with a social inferior. Suspicious of her, they hire Bosola to spy on her. She elopes with Antonio and bears him three children secretly. Bosola eventually discovers that the Duchess is pregnant but does not know who the father is.

Ferdinand, shown by now to be a depraved lunatic, threatens and disowns the Duchess. In an attempt to escape, she and Antonio concoct a story that Antonio has swindled her out of her fortune and must flee into exile. The Duchess takes Bosola into her confidence, unaware that he is Ferdinand&#x27;s spy, and arranges for him to deliver her jewellery to Antonio at his hiding-place in Ancona. She will join them later, while pretending to make a pilgrimage to a nearby town. The Cardinal hears of the plan, instructs Bosola to banish the two lovers, and sends soldiers to capture them. Antonio escapes with their eldest son, but the Duchess, her maid, and her two younger children are returned to Malfi and die at the hands of Bosola&#x27;s executioners, who are under Ferdinand&#x27;s orders. This experience leads Bosola to turn against the brothers, and he decides to take up the cause of &quot;revenge for the Duchess of Malfi&quot; (5.2).

The Cardinal confesses his part in the killing of the Duchess to his mistress, Julia, then murders her with a poisoned Bible. Bosola overhears the Cardinal plotting to kill him, so he visits the darkened chapel to kill the Cardinal at his prayers. Instead, he mistakenly kills Antonio, who has just returned to Malfi to attempt a reconciliation with the Cardinal. Bosola then stabs the Cardinal, who dies. In the brawl that follows, Ferdinand and Bosola stab each other to death.

Antonio&#x27;s elder son by the Duchess appears in the final scene and takes his place as the heir to the Malfi fortune. The son&#x27;s decision is in spite of his father&#x27;s explicit wish that he &quot;fly the court of princes&quot;, a corrupt and increasingly deadly environment.

The conclusion is controversial for some readers because they find reason to believe the inheriting son is not the rightful heir of the Duchess. The play briefly mentions a son who is the product of her first marriage and would therefore have a stronger claim to the duchy. Other scholars believe the mention of a prior son is just a careless error in the text.

==Plot==

=== Act 1 ===

* Scene 1—The Duchess&#x27;s palace in Malfi: Antonio and Delio are discussing the former&#x27;s return from France, and discussing how the French king runs his court, comparing it to an easily poisoned fountain. They are interrupted by the entry of Bosola and the Cardinal. Antonio and Delio hold their conversation, stepping to the background to watch as Bosola angrily tries to gain the Cardinal&#x27;s pardon, speaking of the time he has spent in the galleys in penal servitude, and in the service of the Cardinal. Bosola declares that he is surely done with service, but the Cardinal is not interested in Bosola&#x27;s new merit and takes his leave. Bosola compares himself to Tantalus, never able to acquire the thing he most desires, like an injured soldier who can only depend on his crutches for support of any kind. When he leaves, Antonio and Delio comment on his past offence, and how he will surely come to no good if he is kept in neglect. Ferdinand comes into the palace, talking to his courtiers about a tournament that Antonio has just won. When the Cardinal, Duchess, and Cariola enter to speak with Ferdinand, Antonio and Delio have a moment to themselves to discuss the Cardinal&#x27;s character; he is found to be a very dishonest, disagreeable person, as is his brother, Ferdinand. Only their sister, the Duchess, earns the approval of everyone, a very pleasant and gracious woman. After the two gentlemen leave, Ferdinand petitions his sister to make Bosola the manager of her horses; when everyone else leaves, Ferdinand and the Cardinal reveal that it is because Bosola is to spy on their sister. When Bosola is brought in and made aware of this plan, he at first refuses, but ultimately is given no choice. The Cardinal and Ferdinand then turn their attention to their sister, urging her not to marry again, now that she is a widow, going so far as to threaten her with death, in Ferdinand&#x27;s case. She refuses to be bullied, and once her brothers are out of sight, she proposes to Antonio by giving him her wedding ring. Having Cariola, the Duchess&#x27;s maid, as their witness, this private ceremony is legally binding and the Duchess and Antonio become husband and wife.

=== Act 2 ===

* Scene 1—The Duchess&#x27;s palace in Malfi, nine months later: Bosola and Castruchio enter, Bosola criticising his companion&#x27;s appearance, and telling him that he would make a ridiculous judge. When an old woman intrudes on their conversation, Bosola&#x27;s insults turn on her, calling her hideous to the point that no amount of make-up would help. He also accuses her of being too like a witch; the old lady and Castruchio leave Bosola alone to muse on the mysterious way the Duchess is acting of late. He believes she is pregnant (no one but Delio and Cariola know that the Duchess and Antonio are married), and aims to prove it by using apricots both to spark her pregnant appetite and to induce labour, as apricots were believed to do. The Duchess, when she enters, accepts the fruit from Bosola, and quickly starts going into labour. She then retires to her chamber claiming to be ill, with a worried Antonio following in her wake.
* Scene 2—Same place and time as the previous scene: Bosola, alone, realises that the Duchess is indeed pregnant. After accosting the hapless old lady again, he watches as Antonio and the servants in a commotion about a Swiss mercenary who had invaded the Duchess&#x27;s room, and the loss of several jewels and gold utensils. Even with all the uproar, Antonio is not distracted from his wife&#x27;s &quot;illness&quot;; she is actually in labour. Cariola, the lady&#x27;s maid, enters with good news once Antonio is alone—he is the father of a son.
* Scene 3—Same place and time as the previous scene: Bosola re-enters the now empty room, having heard a woman (the Duchess) shriek. Antonio discovers him and questions his purpose in being there, since everyone had been commanded to keep to their rooms. Antonio tells him to stay away from the Duchess since he doesn&#x27;t trust Bosola. In Antonio&#x27;s agitation, he accidentally drops a horoscope for his son&#x27;s birth, which Bosola retrieves. He realises what it means, and resolves to send it to the Duchess&#x27;s brothers with Castruccio.
* Scene 4—The Cardinal&#x27;s rooms: The Cardinal and his mistress, Julia, are discussing their rendezvous when a messenger calls the Cardinal away with an important message. Delio enters to find Julia alone. He was once a suitor of hers and offers her money. Julia leaves to meet her husband, Castruccio, and Delio fears that her husband&#x27;s arrival means Antonio&#x27;s secret marriage is about to be revealed.
* Scene 5—Rome, in Ferdinand&#x27;s private apartments: An enraged Ferdinand, with the letter from Bosola, and his brother the Cardinal, meet to discuss what they think is an awful treachery by their sister. Ferdinand is angry to the point of shouting about his sister&#x27;s &quot;whorish&quot; behaviour (he knows of the child, but not of the marriage), and the Cardinal struggles to control his brother&#x27;s temperamental outburst. Ferdinand resolves to discover the man his sister is seeing, threatening all and sundry.

=== Act 3 ===

* Scene 1—The Duchess&#x27;s palace in Malfi, after some time has passed: Antonio greets the returning Delio, who has come from Rome with Ferdinand. Antonio reveals that the Duchess has had two more children in the time Delio was gone. Antonio fears the wrath of the recently arrived Ferdinand, and Delio tells him the ordinary people think the Duchess is a whore. While they talk, the Duchess and Ferdinand enter. He tells her that he has found a husband for her, the Count Malateste. She disregards this, as she is already married (still secretly of course) to Antonio. When left alone, Ferdinand consults with Bosola to discover the father of the three seemingly illegitimate children; Bosola has acquired a skeleton key to the Duchess&#x27;s room, which Ferdinand takes, telling him to guess what will happen next.
* Scene 2—The Duchess&#x27;s bedchamber: Antonio comes up to the Duchess&#x27;s bedroom to spend the night, and they banter back and forth about the point of lovers just sleeping together. Antonio and Cariola leave to allow the Duchess to complete her night-time preparations, but she is not alone; Ferdinand sneaks in and startles her. He gives her a knife, intending her to kill herself, and his fury increases when she tells him she is married without his knowledge. Ferdinand leaves, declaring he will never see her again. He exits just in time, for Antonio bursts in brandishing a pistol, but the Duchess forces him to leave again when Bosola knocks at the door. Bosola informs the Duchess that Ferdinand has left for Rome again, and she tells him that Ferdinand&#x27;s bills of exchange (he has so far dealt with her accounts) will no longer work, since Antonio has been false with her accounts. This is, of course, a trick to get Antonio out of Malfi; she calls Antonio back in (once Bosola exits) to tell him to flee to Ancona, where she will send him all her treasure and valuables. The couple puts on a show argument for the benefit of the returning Bosola and officers, where she criticises his faulty record keeping and banishes him. Bosola does not believe the Duchess was justified in banishing Antonio, and tells her that Antonio is a good, honest man. This speech prompts the Duchess to confide the secret marriage to Bosola. He is then left on stage to lament his role as a spy, for now he must reveal all to Ferdinand.
* Scene 3—A room in a palace at Rome: The Cardinal, Ferdinand, Malateste, Pescara, Silvio and Delio are discussing the new fortifications that are being made in Naples. Ferdinand and his men, leaving the Cardinal and Malateste to speak privately, are very harsh in their critique of Malateste, considering him too cowardly to fight in an upcoming battle. Bosola, meanwhile, interrupts the Cardinal&#x27;s private conference with news of his sister. The Cardinal leaves to petition for her and her family&#x27;s exile from Ancona, while Bosola goes to tell the Duchess&#x27;s first child (from her first husband) what has happened with his mother. Ferdinand goes to find Antonio.
* Scene 4—The shrine of Our Lady of Loreto, Italy, in the Ancona province: Two pilgrims are visiting the shrine in Ancona, and witness the Cardinal being symbolically prepared for war. The Cardinal then proceeds to take the Duchess&#x27;s wedding ring, banish her, Antonio, and their children, while the pilgrims muse over the reason for what they have just seen.
* Scene 5—Near Loreto: The newly banished family, and the maid Cariola, enter Loreto. Shortly after their arrival, Bosola comes and presents the Duchess with a letter from Ferdinand, which indirectly states that Ferdinand wants Antonio dead. Antonio tells Bosola that he will not go to Ferdinand, and the Duchess urges him to take the oldest child and go to Milan to find safety, which he promptly does. Bosola and masked guards then take the Duchess and her remaining children captive, on the orders of her brothers.

=== Act 4 ===

* Scene 1—A prison (or the Duchess&#x27;s lodgings serving as a prison) near Loreto: Ferdinand comes in with Bosola, who is describing to him how the Duchess is dealing with her imprisonment. It seems she is not affected to Ferdinand&#x27;s satisfaction, and he leaves angrily. Bosola greets the Duchess, telling her that her brother wishes to speak with her, but will not do so where he can see her. She agrees to meet with her brother in the darkness. Once the lights are out, Ferdinand returns. He presents her with a dead man&#x27;s hand, leading her to believe that it is Antonio&#x27;s, with her wedding ring on it. He then exits, leaving Bosola to show the Duchess lifelike figures of her husband and children, made to appear as though her family was dead. The Duchess believes them to be the genuine articles, and resolves to die—her despair is so deep it affects Bosola. When she leaves, Ferdinand re-enters; Bosola pleads with him to send his sister to a convent, refusing to be a part of the plot any more. Ferdinand is beyond reason at this point, and tells Bosola to go to Milan to find the real Antonio.
* Scene 2—Same place and time as the previous scene: The Duchess and her maid, Cariola, come back, distracted by the noises being made by a group of madmen (Ferdinand brought them in to terrorise her). A servant tells her that they were brought for sport, and lets in several of the madmen. Bosola, too, sneaks in with them, disguised as an old man, and tells the Duchess that he is there to make her tomb. When she tries to pull rank on him, executioners with cords and a coffin come in. Cariola is removed from the room, leaving Bosola and the executioners with the Duchess. The Duchess makes a brave show, telling the executioners to &quot;pull, and pull strongly&quot;, welcoming her strangulation. Cariola is brought back, and after struggling fiercely, she too is strangled. Ferdinand comes to view the scene, and is also shown the bodies of his sister&#x27;s children, who were murdered as well. Ferdinand reveals that he and the Duchess were twins, and that he had hoped, if she had remained a widow, to inherit all her wealth. Bosola, sensing that Ferdinand is ready to turn on him next, demands payment for his atrocities. Ferdinand, distracted, leaves him alone with the bodies. Astonishingly, the Duchess is not dead. A shocked Bosola has no time to call for medicine; he manages to tell the Duchess that Antonio is not really dead; that the figures she saw were fake, before she finally dies. Bosola, remorseful at last, takes her body to the care of some good women, planning to leave immediately thereafter for Milan.

=== Act 5 ===

* Scene 1—Outside Ferdinand and the Cardinal&#x27;s palace in Milan: Antonio returns to see if he can reconcile with Ferdinand and the Cardinal, but Delio is dubious as to the wisdom of this. Delio asks Pescara, a marquis, to give him possession of Antonio&#x27;s estate for safekeeping, but Pescara denies him. Julia presents Pescara with a letter from the Cardinal, which states that she should receive Antonio&#x27;s property, and which Pescara grants to her. When Delio confronts him about this, Pescara says that he would not give an innocent man a property that was taken from someone by such vile means (the Cardinal took the property for himself once Antonio was banished), for it will now become an appropriate place for the Cardinal&#x27;s mistress. This statement impresses the hidden Antonio. When Pescara leaves to visit an ill Ferdinand, Antonio decides to pay a night-time visit to the Cardinal.
* Scene 2—Inside the same palace: Pescara, come to visit Ferdinand, is discussing his condition with the doctor, who believes Ferdinand may have lycanthropia: a condition whereby he believes he is a wolf. The doctor thinks there is a chance of a relapse, in which case Ferdinand&#x27;s diseased behaviour would return; namely, digging up dead bodies at night. Pescara and the doctor make way for the mad Ferdinand, who attacks his own shadow. The Cardinal, who has entered with Ferdinand, manages to catch Bosola, who has been watching Ferdinand&#x27;s ravings. The Cardinal assigns Bosola to seek out Antonio (by following Delio) and then slay him. After the Cardinal leaves, Bosola does not even make it to the door before he is stopped by Julia, who is brandishing a pistol. She accuses him of having given her a love potion, and threatens to kill him to end her love. Bosola manages to disarm her and convince her to gather intelligence for him about the Cardinal. Bosola then hides while Julia uses all of her persuasive powers to get the Cardinal to reveal his part in the death of his sister and her children. The Cardinal then makes Julia swear to keep silent, forcing her to kiss the poisoned cover of a bible, causing her to die almost instantly. Bosola comes out of hiding to confront the Cardinal, although he declares that he still intends to kill Antonio. Giving him a master key, the Cardinal takes his leave. However, once he is alone, Bosola swears to protect Antonio, and goes off to bury Julia&#x27;s body.
* Scene 3—A courtyard outside the same palace: Delio and Antonio are near the Duchess&#x27;s tomb; as they talk, an echo from the tomb mirrors their conversation. Delio leaves to find Antonio&#x27;s eldest son, and Antonio leaves to escape the distressing echo of his wife&#x27;s resting place.
* Scene 4—The Cardinal&#x27;s apartments in Milan: The Cardinal enters, trying to dissuade Pescara, Malateste, Roderigo and Grisolan from staying to keep watch over Ferdinand. He goes so far as to say that he might feign mad fits to test their obedience; if they come to help, they will be in trouble. They unwillingly exit, and Bosola enters to find the Cardinal planning to have him killed. Antonio, unaware of Bosola, sneaks in while it is dark, planning to seek audience with the Cardinal. Not realising who has entered, Bosola attacks Antonio; he is horrified to see his mistake. He manages to relate the death of the Duchess and children to the dying Antonio, who is glad to be dying in sadness, now that life is pointless for him. Bosola then leaves to bring down the Cardinal.
* Scene 5—The same apartments, near Julia&#x27;s lodging: The Cardinal, unaware of what has just happened, is reading a book when Bosola enters with a servant, who is bearing Antonio&#x27;s body. He threatens the Cardinal, who calls for help. Help is not forthcoming, for the gentlemen from the beginning of the previous scene, while they can hear him calling, have no desire to go to his aid (because of his previous order to not at any cost try to help Ferdinand). Bosola kills the servant of the Cardinal first, and then attacks The Cardinal and stabs him in the chest. Ferdinand burst in to attack Bosola and succeeds in stabbing him as well, but Bosola turns and kills him with a wound to the heart. As Bosola and The Cardinal prepare to finish each other off, they both collapse, dead.

==Sources==
Webster&#x27;s principal source was in William Painter&#x27;s &quot;The Palace of Pleasure&quot; (1567), which was a translation of François de Belleforest&#x27;s French adaptation of Matteo Bandello&#x27;s &quot;Novelle&quot; (1554). Bandello had known Antonio Beccadelli di Bologna in Milan before his assassination. He recounted the story of Antonio&#x27;s secret marriage to Giovanna after the death of her first husband, stating that it brought down the wrath of her two brothers, one of whom, Luigi d&#x27;Aragona, was a powerful cardinal under Pope Julius II. Bandello says that the brothers arranged the kidnapping of the Duchess, her maid, and two of her three children by Antonio, all of whom were then murdered. Antonio, unaware of their fate, escaped to Milan with his oldest son, where he was later assassinated by a gang led by one Daniele Bozzolo.

Webster&#x27;s play follows this story fairly faithfully, but departs from the source material by depicting Bozzolo as a conflicted figure who repents, kills Antonio by mistake, then turns on the brothers killing them both. In fact the brothers were never accused of the crime in their lifetimes and died of natural causes.

==Main themes==

===Corruption===

A vein of corruption runs throughout the play, notably in the character of the deadly Cardinal, a man ready to employ lesser beings (such as Bosola) to commit murders for him, then cast them aside as rotten fruit. He is no stranger to murder himself, however, as he slays his own mistress by making her kiss a poisoned bible. Antonio describes him thus:

The Cardinal gambles, keeps the wife of one of his courtiers as a mistress, and fights duels. Conspiracy and intrigue are the air he breathes. Duke Ferdinand is his brother&#x27;s willing conspirator in villainy, and at times his rages shock even the Cardinal&#x27;s sense of decorum. The Duke&#x27;s corruption in the end destroys his sanity: incestuous desire for his own sister. Realizing she has married and borne children by Antonio, his rage drives him to do everything in his power to bring his sister to despair, madness and death, but in the end he is driven mad himself.

These two perverse villains destroy or poison all that is within their reach, all semblance of warmth or human affection.

===Abuse of power===

The brothers repeatedly abuse their power. Ferdinand is caught committing adultery but is not punished. The Cardinal abuses his ecclesiastical powers to have Antonio&#x27;s property confiscated and to have the Duchess and her family banished from the state of Ancona. Ferdinand and the Cardinal order the death of the Duchess without any proper judgement passed by a court of law.

===Status of women and responsibility for the tragedy===

The ideal quality her brothers would foist on the Duchess is that of being submissive to (their) male control, though ironically widowhood was often the first time women might be independent of the control of husbands or male relatives. However, the Duchess went against her brothers&#x27; wishes and remarried. Her assertion of her freedom of choice is best illustrated in her soliloquy following her conversation with her brothers when they strictly advise her to not even think about remarrying. Immediately after telling her brothers that she will never remarry, she says to herself: &quot;If all my royal kindred / Lay in my way unto this marriage, / I&#x27;d make them my low foot-steps.&quot; The central conflict of the play involves the Duchess&#x27; desire to marry for love and her brothers&#x27; desire to prevent her from remarrying (either to inherit her estate and control her choices, or perhaps out of Ferdinand&#x27;s potentially incestuous love for his sister). Throughout, she refuses to submit to her brothers&#x27; attempts at control and even asserts her identity and self-control at the moment of her death, announcing &quot;I am Duchess of Malfi still&quot; (4.2).

The internal struggle faced by the Duchess when fighting her brothers and hiding her marriage was all part of Webster&#x27;s intention to reflect and refer to the Roman paradigms and Senecan tragedies. This is compelled through the Duchess&#x27;s speech and actions.

===Cruelty===
The relationship between the Duchess and her brothers is rooted in cruelty. The brothers often try to manipulate her and drive her mad. This cruelty is first evident when the Cardinal and Ferdinand lock the Duchess in her own home. Ferdinand deceives the Duchess into thinking that he cares: &quot;I come to seal my peace with you. / Here&#x27;s a hand, / To which you have vowed much love. / The ring upon&#x27;t / You gave&quot;(4.1 42–44). In the darkness, the Duchess thinks that Ferdinand is asking for her forgiveness when he reaches out his hand, and so she kisses it; when the lights come on she sees the dead bodies of her husband and children, and believes she just kissed her husband&#x27;s severed hand. But in reality, Ferdinand used wax figures to trick her into thinking her family is dead. This deception and cruelty cause the Duchess physical and emotional torment throughout the play. At the end of the play, the Duchess is strangled at the request of her brothers.

=== Class ===
The Duchess argues that high class is not an indicator of a good man. At the time, Italy was moving into capitalism and one no longer needed to be born into wealth to obtain it. Though the Duchess and her brothers are aware of this, her brothers, concerned with wealth and honour, nevertheless strive to dismantle her marriage to Antonio while disapproving of their sister&#x27;s love life. Ferdinand is particularly obsessed with the idea of inheriting the fortune to which his sister is entitled, because it would protect his social and financial status. Ultimately the Duchess is put to death for remarrying into a lower class.

=== Objectification ===
The Duchess is often criticised (Clifford Leech condemned her for her &#x27;irresponsible overturning of a social code&#x27;) for stepping out of the societal expectations of a widow in sixteenth century England. As a widow, the Duchess gains a new power and independence, which angers her brothers. As a female in a position of power, she is expected to hold the throne and obey the patriarchal figures in the court, specifically her two brothers, the Cardinal and Ferdinand. The Cardinal and Ferdinand are in line to receive the inheritance if the Duchess does not have any children, so controlling her sexual affairs becomes their singular focus. Rather than respecting her autonomy and wishes, they aim to control her sexuality and diminish her independence. In Act I, Scene I, Ferdinand makes this clear when he states, &quot;Nay, / I mean the tongue: variety of courtship. / What cannot a neat knave with a smooth tale / Make a woman believe? Farewell, lusty widow&quot; (1.1.247–250). He is solely focused on preserving her chastity, so he views her as an object, rather than a human being. The continued objectification of the Duchess from her brothers conveys males&#x27; perceived ability to control a woman&#x27;s body in the society of the 16th century.

==Theatrical devices==
The play makes use of various theatrical devices, some of them derived from Senecan Tragedy which includes violence and bloodshed on the stage. Act III, Scene IV is a mime scene, in which a song is sung in honour of the Cardinal, who gives up his robes and invests himself with the attire of a soldier, and then performs the act of banishing the Duchess. The whole scene is commented upon by two pilgrims, who condemn the harsh behaviour of the Cardinal towards the Duchess. That the scene is set against the backdrop of the Shrine of Our Lady of Loretto, a religious place, adds to its sharp distinction between good and evil, justice and injustice.

Act V, Scene iii, features an important theatrical device, echo, which seems to emanate from the grave of the Duchess, in her voice. In its totality, it reads: &quot;Deadly accent. A thing of sorrow. That suits it best. Ay, wife&#x27;s voice. Be mindful of thy safety. O fly your fate. Thou art a dead thing. Never see her more.&quot; The echo repeats the last words of what Antonio and Delio speak, but is selective. It adds to the sense of the inevitability of Antonio&#x27;s death, while highlighting the role of fate.

==Historical staging==

&quot;Set and props&quot;: As this play would have first been produced in the Globe, the set would probably been a bare stage with movable set pieces such as tables, stools, beds, hangings, and altars, all of which would have been stock pieces used in every show. Props would also have been minimal, with essentials like swords, pistols, and candles, and dummies. The traveller and future translator of Castiglione&#x27;s &quot;Cortegiano&quot;, Thomas Hoby, together with his friend Peter Whitehorne, translator of Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;Art of War&quot;, were lavishly entertained by a subsequent Duchess of Malfi and her son, Innico, in the Castello di Amalfi in 1550. Hoby was clearly very impressed by the decor, by implication superior to what he was used to in England, describing the chamber in which they were accommodated as: &#x27;hanged with clothe of gold and vellett, wherein were two beddes, th&#x27;one of silver worke and the other of vellett, with pillowes bolsters and the shetes curiouslie wrowght with needle worke.&#x27;

&quot;Lighting&quot;: Lighting for a theatre like the Globe is completely dependent upon the sun. Performances would occur in the afternoon so as to see the performers, since no other sources of lighting were accessible. However, indoor playhouses would have been lit with candles.

&quot;Costumes&quot;: This was the Jacobean era, and Renaissance clothing, often hand-me-downs from noble patrons, would have been appropriate during this time. Especially since this play takes place among wealthy, prestigious characters who belong to The Royal Court, there would have been long dresses with elaborate sleeves and headpieces for most female characters, and doublets for most of the men as a general rule. Men would wear hose and codpieces, very royal members of The Court might wear doublets and jerkins and both men and women would be able to wear clothing with some type of colour to it. Due to the sumptuary laws, deep purple was restricted to the nobility of the times. During this period, and until the Restoration (1660) women were not generally accepted on stage. Because of this, the roles of women were played by apprentice boys or the younger men. Padding would be built into their costumes, their heads would be adorned with wigs, and extra make-up would be applied to their faces.

==The 1623 quarto==
The Duchess of Malfi was first performed between 1613 and 1614 by the King&#x27;s Men, an acting group to which Shakespeare belonged. The printer was Nicholas Okes and the publisher was John Waterson. However, the play was not printed in quarto (a smaller, less expensive edition than the larger folio) until 1623. The title page of this particular edition tells us that the play was printed privately. The title page also informs readers that the play text includes numerous passages that were cut for performance. The 1623 quarto is the only substantive version of the play in circulation today, and modern editions and productions are based on it. Notable is that, on the title page of the 1623 quarto, a clear distinction is drawn between the play in performance and the play as a text to be read. 
==Reception and performance history==

The play was written for and performed by the King&#x27;s Men in 1613 or 1614. The double cast lists included in the 1623 quarto suggest a revival around 1619. Contemporary reference also indicated that the play was performed in 1618, for in that year Orazio Busino, the chaplain to the Venetian ambassador to England, complained of the play&#x27;s treatment of Catholics in the character of the Cardinal.

The quarto&#x27;s cast list allows more precision about casting than is usually available. Richard Burbage and Joseph Taylor successively played Ferdinand to Henry Condell&#x27;s Cardinal. John Lowin played Bosola; William Ostler was Antonio. Boy player Richard Sharpe played the title role not in the original 1612 production, presumably due to his age, but in the revival of 1619–23. Nicholas Tooley played Forobosco, and Robert Pallant doubled numerous minor roles, including Cariola.

The quarto title page announces that the play was performed at both the Globe Theatre and at Blackfriars; however, in tone and in some details of staging (particularly the use of special lighting effects) the play is clearly meant primarily for the indoor stage. Robert Johnson, a regular composer for Blackfriars, wrote incidental music for the play and composed a setting for the &quot;madmen&#x27;s song&quot; in Act 4.

The play is known to have been performed for Charles I at the Cockpit-in-Court in 1630; there is little reason to doubt that it was performed intermittently throughout the period.

The play remained current through the first part of the Restoration. Samuel Pepys reports seeing the play several times; it was performed by the Duke of York&#x27;s company under Thomas Betterton.

By the early eighteenth century, Webster&#x27;s violence and sexual frankness had gone out of taste. In 1733, Lewis Theobald wrote and directed an adaptation, &quot;The Fatal Secret&quot;; the play imposed neoclassical unities on the play, for instance by eliminating the Duchess&#x27;s child and preserving the Duchess at the end. By mid-century, the play had fallen, with Webster, out of the repertory, where it stayed until the Romantic revival of Charles Lamb and William Hazlitt.
In 1850, after a generation of critical interest and theatrical neglect, the play was staged by Samuel Phelps at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, with Isabella Glyn in the title role. The text was adapted by Richard Henry Horne. The production was favourably reviewed by &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;; George Henry Lewes, however, registered disapproval of the play&#x27;s violence and what he termed its shoddy construction: &quot;Instead of &#x27;holding the mirror up to nature,&#x27; this drama holds the mirror up to Madame Tussauds.&quot; These would become the cornerstones of criticisms of Webster for the next century. Still, the play was popular enough for Glyn to revive her performance periodically for the next two decades.

Shortly after, &quot;Duchess&quot; came to the United States. Working with Horne&#x27;s text, director James Stark staged a production in San Francisco; this version is noteworthy for a sentimental apotheosis Stark added, in which the Duchess and Ferdinand are reunited in heaven. The most popular American productions, however, were produced by Wilmarth Waller and his wife Emma.

William Poel staged the play at the Opera Comique in 1892, with Mary Rorke as the Duchess and Murray Carson as Bosola. Poel&#x27;s playscript followed Webster&#x27;s text closely apart from scene rearrangements; however, reaction had set in, and the production received generally scathing reviews. William Archer, England&#x27;s chief proponent of Ibsen&#x27;s new drama, took advantage of the occasion to lambast what he saw as the overestimation of Elizabethan theatre in general.

In 1919, the Phoenix Society revived the play in London for the first time in two decades. The production featured Cathleen Nesbitt as the Duchess; Robert Farquharson played Ferdinand. The production was widely disparaged. For many of the newspaper critics, the failure indicated that Webster had become a &quot;curio&quot;; T. S. Eliot, conversely, argued that the production had failed to uncover the elements that made Webster a great dramatist—specifically his poetry. A 1935 production at the Embassy Theatre received similarly negative reviews; Ivor Brown noted that the audience left &quot;rather with superior smiles than with emotional surrender.&quot; In 1938, a production was broadcast on BBC television; it was no better received than the previous two stage productions.

In 1937, it was performed in Dublin, Ireland, at the Abbey Theatre, with incidental music composed by Arthur Duff.

In the aftermath of World War II, George Rylands directed a production at the Haymarket Theatre that at last caught the public mood. John Gielgud, as Ferdinand, accentuated the element of incestuous passion in that character&#x27;s treatment of the Duchess (played by Peggy Ashcroft). Cecil Trouncer was Bosola. Edmund Wilson was perhaps the first to note that the play struck an audience differently in the wake of the revelation of the Holocaust; this note is, from 1945 on, continually struck in discussions of the appropriateness of Webster for the modern age. A 1946 production on Broadway did not fare as well; Rylands attempted to duplicate his London staging with John Carradine as Ferdinand and Elisabeth Bergner as the Duchess. W. H. Auden adapted Webster&#x27;s text for the modern audience. However, the production&#x27;s most notable innovation was in the character of Bosola, which was played by Canada Lee in whiteface. The production received savage reviews from the popular press, and it fared little better in the literary reviews.

The first successful postwar performance in America was staged at the off-Broadway Phoenix Theatre in 1957. Directed by Jack Landau, who had earlier staged a brief but well-reviewed &quot;White Devil&quot;, the production emphasised (and succeeded as) Grand Guignol. As Walter Kerr put it, &quot;Blood runs right over the footlights, spreads slowly up the aisle and spills well out into Second Avenue.&quot;

Ashcroft returned as the Duchess in a 1960 production at the Aldwych Theatre. The play was directed by Donald McWhinnie; Eric Porter played Ferdinand and Max Adrian the Cardinal. Patrick Wymark played Bosola. The production received generally favourable but lukewarm reviews. In 1971, Clifford Williams directed the play for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Judi Dench took the title role, with Geoffrey Hutchings as Bosola and Emrys James as the Cardinal. Dench&#x27;s husband Michael Williams played Ferdinand, casting which highlighted the sexual element of the play&#x27;s siblings.

In 1980, Adrian Noble directed the play at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester. This production received excellent notices; it was transferred to London, where it won the London Drama Critic&#x27;s Award for best play. Helen Mirren played the title role; Mike Gwilym played Ferdinand, and Bob Hoskins played Bosola. Pete Postlethwaite was Antonio. Mirren&#x27;s performance received special acclaim.

The actor-centred troupe led by Ian McKellen and Edward Petherbridge chose Webster&#x27;s play as one of their first productions. The production opened in January 1986 in the Lyttelton Theatre of the Royal National Theatre and was directed and designed by Philip Prowse. The staging was highly stylised, the scenic backdrop segmented, and the actors&#x27; movements tightly controlled. The result, as Jarka Burian noted, was &quot;a unified, consistent mise-en-scene...without enough inner turbulence to create a completely satisfying theatre experience.&quot; Eleanor Bron played the Duchess; McKellen played Bosola, Jonathan Hyde Ferdinand, and Petherbridge the Cardinal.

In 1995, Juliet Stevenson and Simon Russell-Beale played the Duchess and Ferdinand respectively in a production at Greenwich Theatre, directed by Philip Franks.

In 2010, the production was staged for Stage on Screen at the Greenwich Theatre, London. It was directed by Elizabeth Freestone and starred Aislin McGuckin in a production that set the play in the first half of the twentieth century. In The Guardian, the reviewer noted that &#x27;Much of the pleasure of this revival lies in re-encountering Webster&#x27;s language...full of savage poetry.&#x27; The production is now available on DVD.

In July 2010, English National Opera and Punchdrunk collaborated to stage the production, which had been commissioned by the ENO from composer Torsten Rasch. The production was staged in a promenade style and performed at a mysterious vacant site at Great Eastern Quay in London&#x27;s Royal Albert Basin.

From March to June 2012, London&#x27;s Old Vic Theatre staged a production, directed by Jamie Lloyd and starring, amongst others, Eve Best.

In January 2014, Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe staged a production directed by Dominic Dromgoole and starring Gemma Arterton as the Duchess, James Garnon as the Cardinal, David Dawson as Ferdinand, Alex Waldmann as Antonio, and Sean Gilder as Bosola. It was the first production performed in the Globe&#x27;s Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. The production was filmed and broadcast on BBC4 on 25 May 2014. This production coincided with a representation of the aforementioned Theobald text of 1736 as part of the Globe&#x27;s Read Not Dead series – directed by David Oakes.

In 2018, a production was staged in Stratford-upon-Avon by the Royal Shakespeare Company.

In 2024, Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe staged a production at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, with Francesca Mills as the Duchess. This production was a part of the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse 10th Anniversary collection, the 2014 production opening the theatre 10 years prior.

Also in 2024 a production starring Jodie Whittaker and directed by Zinnie Harris ran from 5 October to 20 December at the Trafalgar Theatre; it was not very well critically received, with reviews suggesting that powerful performances by the cast were spoiled by a contrived production.

<text>The Bell X-14 (Bell Type 68) is an experimental VTOL aircraft flown in the United States in the 1950s. The main objective of the project was to demonstrate vectored thrust horizontal and vertical takeoff, , transition to forward flight, and vertical landing.

==Design and development==

Bell constructed the X-14 as an open-cockpit, all-metal (duralumin) monoplane for the USAF. It was powered by two Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engines equipped with thrust deflectors sited at the aircraft&#x27;s centre of gravity. The engines are fixed in position; transition from vertical to horizontal flight is achieved with a system of movable vanes that control the direction of engine thrust. Top speed was with a service ceiling of . The X-14 was designed using existing parts from two Beechcraft aircraft: wings, ailerons, and landing gear of a Beech Bonanza and the tailcone and empennage of a Beech T-34 Mentor.

==Operational history==
The X-14 first flew on 19 February 1957 as a vertical takeoff, hover, then vertical landing. The first transition from hover to horizontal flight occurred on 24 May 1958. In 1959, its Viper engines were replaced with General Electric J85 engines. That year the aircraft was delivered to the NASA Ames Research Center as the X-14A. During the development of the P.1127, Hawker test pilots Bill Bedford and Hugh Merewether visited NASA Ames to fly the X-14 and acquaint themselves with jet V/STOL aircraft handling prior to the first flights of the prototype P.1127. It served as a test aircraft with NASA until 1981.

The X-14 project provided a great deal of data on VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) type aircraft and flight control systems.

In 1971, the X-14A was fitted with new engines (General Electric J85-GE-19) and redesignated the X-14B. An onboard computer and digital fly-by-wire control system were also installed to enable emulation of landing characteristics of other VTOL aircraft.

The aircraft was obtained by NASA and repurposed as a Moon-landing simulator. Neil Armstrong flew the aircraft on numerous occasions, running out of fuel more than once.

The X-14B was used in this test role until it was damaged in a landing accident on 29 May 1981 and never repaired. At the time, there were plans to develop an X-14C with an enclosed cockpit. There were also plans for an X-14T trainer. None of these further versions got beyond the planning stage.

During all of its years of service, the X-14 was flown by numerous pilots with no serious incidents or injuries.

===Aircraft serial numbers===
Although there was only one airframe, it changed serial numbers with every major upgrade.
*X-14 - &quot;USAF&quot; &quot;56-4022&quot;
*X-14A - &quot;NASA 234&quot; (N234NA)
*X-14B - &quot;NASA 704&quot; (N704NA)

==Surviving aircraft==
The X-14B was rescued from the scrap yard in 1991 and is undergoing renovation as part of the Ropkey Armor and Aviation Museum.

<doc id="1037346" wikidata="Q5272886" url="?curid=1037346" title="Dick Enberg">
<text>Richard Alan Enberg (January 9, 1935 – December 21, 2017) was an American sportscaster. Over the course of an approximately 60-year career, he provided play-by-play of various sports for several radio and television networks, including NBC (1975–1999), CBS (2000–2014), and ESPN (2004–2011), as well as for individual teams, such as UCLA Bruins basketball, Los Angeles Rams football, and California Angels and San Diego Padres baseball.

Enberg was well known for his signature on-air catchphrases &quot;Touch &#x27;em all&quot; (for home runs) and &quot;Oh, my!&quot; (for particularly exciting and outstanding athletic plays). He also announced or hosted the Tournament of Roses Parade for many years, sometimes with the help of family members. Enberg retired from broadcasting in 2016, after seven seasons as the Padres&#x27; primary television announcer.

==Early life and education==
Enberg was born on January 9, 1935, in Mount Clemens, Michigan, as the first child to Belle Elizabeth (Weiss) and Arnie Enberg. His paternal grandparents were Finnish immigrants, whose original name was &quot;Katajavuori&quot;, which means juniper mountain. Before they lived in America, they changed their name to the Swedish-sounding Enberg. His mother was of English, French, German and Native American descent. He had a younger brother, Dennis. Enberg&#x27;s family first moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut, when he was two years old, then to southern California in 1940 for several years, and then back to a farm near Armada, Michigan.

Following high school in Armada, Enberg attended Central Michigan University, where he played college baseball and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1957. In his senior year at Central Michigan, Enberg was elected president of the student body. During this time, he was employed at WSAM in Saginaw, Michigan, then a Detroit Tigers radio affiliate. Enberg then went on to graduate school at Indiana University Bloomington, where he earned master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees in health sciences. While at Indiana, Enberg voiced the first radio broadcast of the Little 500, the bicycle racing event popularized in the film &quot;Breaking Away&quot;.

He was also the play-by-play announcer for Indiana Hoosiers football and basketball games and in 1961 called his first NCAA basketball tournament event, the championship game between Cincinnati and Ohio State. From 1961 to 1965, he was an assistant professor and baseball coach at Cal State Northridge, then known as San Fernando Valley State College. Enberg was also a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity.

==Career in Los Angeles==
In the late 1960s, Enberg began a full-time sportscasting career in Los Angeles, working for KTLA television (anchoring a nightly sports report and calling UCLA Bruins basketball) and KMPC radio (calling Los Angeles Rams football and California Angels baseball). After every Angels victory, he would wrap up his broadcast with &quot;And the halo shines tonight&quot; in reference to the &quot;Big A&quot; scoreboard at Anaheim Stadium and the halo at the top, which would light up for everyone in the area to see, particularly from the adjacent freeway. Enberg was named California Sportscaster of the Year four times during this period.

In the 1960s, Enberg announced boxing matches at L.A.&#x27;s Olympic Auditorium. Enberg also presided over the Trophy presentation for Super Bowl VII in 1973.

In 1968, Enberg was recommended by UCLA athletic director J.D. Morgan to be the national broadcaster for the syndicated TVS Television Network to cover the &quot;Game of the Century&quot; between the Houston Cougars, led by Elvin Hayes, and the UCLA Bruins, led by Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar).

In the 1970s, Enberg called the 1979 NCAA Championship game between Michigan State, led by Magic Johnson, and Indiana State, led by Larry Bird. He also hosted the syndicated television game show &quot;Sports Challenge&quot; and co-produced the Emmy Award-winning sports-history series &quot;The Way It Was&quot; for PBS.

==NBC Sports (1975–1999)==
In 1973, Enberg hosted the game show &quot;Baffle&quot;, which lasted just a year before being cancelled in 1974. A year later, producer Monty Hall hired Enberg to host the shorter-lived &quot;Three for the Money&quot;.

In 1975, Enberg joined NBC Sports. For the next 25 years, he broadcast a plethora of sports and events for NBC, including the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the U.S. Open golf championship, college football, college basketball, the Wimbledon and French Open tennis tournaments, heavyweight boxing, Breeders&#x27; Cup and other horse racing events, and the Olympic Games.

Enberg replaced Curt Gowdy as lead play-by-play announcer for the &quot;NFL on NBC&quot; in 1979, and on the network&#x27;s telecast of the Rose Bowl in January 1980. He was in the booth in Pasadena for nine straight years, until ABC took over the broadcast in 1989.

===&quot;The NFL on NBC&quot;===
While on &quot;The NFL on NBC&quot;, Enberg called eight Super Bowls (alongside such former NFL players Merlin Olsen, Bob Trumpy, Phil Simms, and Paul Maguire), the last being Super Bowl XXXII in January 1998. Enberg also anchored NBC&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl XIII (called by Curt Gowdy) in 1979. He also called three Canadian Football League games in 1982 during the NFL strike.

Among the notable games called by Enberg was the 1986 Week 3 51–45 shootout between the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins and the 1987 AFC Championship Game between the Denver Broncos and Cleveland Browns.

===&quot;Major League Baseball on NBC&quot;===
In 1977, Enberg provided play-by-play for Game 2 of the American League Championship Series and Game 4 of the National League Championship Series Series alongside Don Drysdale. Two years later, Enberg teamed with Wes Parker and Sparky Anderson to call the ALCS for NBC. And then in 1981, Enberg alongside Tom Seaver, called the National League Division Series between the Montreal Expos and Philadelphia Phillies and then, the NLCS between Montreal and the Los Angeles Dodgers.

According to his autobiography, &quot;Oh My!&quot;, Enberg was informed by NBC that he would become the lead play-by-play voice of &quot;Major League Baseball Game of the Week&quot; beginning with the 1982 World Series (for which he served as pregame host and shared play-by-play duties with Joe Garagiola alongside analyst Tony Kubek) and through subsequent regular seasons. He wrote that on his football trips, he would read every &quot;Sporting News&quot; to make sure he was current with all the baseball news and notes. Then he met with NBC executives in September 1982, and they informed him that Vin Scully was in negotiations to be their lead baseball play-by-play man (teaming with Garagiola while Kubek would team with Bob Costas) and would begin with NBC in the spring of 1983.

According to the book, Enberg wasn&#x27;t pleased about the decision (since he loved being the California Angels&#x27; radio and television voice in the 1970s and was eager to return to baseball) but the fact that NBC was bringing in Scully, arguably baseball&#x27;s best announcer, was understandable. Enberg added that NBC also gave him a significant pay increase as a pseudo-apology for not coming through on the promise to make him the lead baseball play-by-play man. Enberg returned to the Angels&#x27; radio booth to call 40 games in 1985, citing a desire to reconnect with the sport, which he has described as having been &quot;in my DNA since I was in diapers&quot;.

Enberg hosted NBC&#x27;s pregame shows of the 1985 National League Championship Series with Joe Morgan. It was Enberg who broke the news to most of the nation that Vince Coleman was injured before Game 4. NBC even aired an interview with one of the few people who actually saw the incident, a Dodger batboy. Enberg was also in Toronto to do the pregame for Games 1 and 7 of the 1985 American League Championship Series alongside Rick Dempsey (who was still active with Baltimore at the time).

NBC planned to use Enberg as one of its announcers for The Baseball Network coverage in 1994, but the players&#x27; strike that year ended the season before he had the opportunity to call any games.

===Wimbledon Championships===
As NBC&#x27;s voice of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, the last tournament for him being in 1999 (alongside Bud Collins and, later, John McEnroe), Enberg regularly concluded NBC&#x27;s coverage of the two-week event with thematically appropriate observations accompanied by a montage of video clips.

==CBS Sports (2000–2014)==
Enberg was hired by CBS Sports in 2000, serving as a play-by-play announcer for CBS&#x27;s NFL, college basketball, and US Open Tennis coverage. For several years he also contributed to CBS&#x27;s coverage of The Masters and PGA Championship golf as an interviewer and essayist.

Enberg during his tenure at CBS, was notably on the call alongside Dan Dierdorf for an NFL game between the New England Patriots and New York Jets on September 23, 2001. It was during this game that New York linebacker Mo Lewis injured the Patriots&#x27; starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe. Bledsoe&#x27;s injury resulted in Tom Brady becoming New England&#x27;s quarterback, beginning the Brady–Belichick era for the Patriots that saw them enjoy nearly two decades of dominance and win six Super Bowl titles. As a result, Lewis&#x27; hit on Bledsoe is often noted for its impact on NFL history.

One of the more notable games Enberg also called was the 2005 AFC Divisional matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Indianapolis Colts that saw the Steelers go on to upset the Colts 21-18 en route to their victory in Super Bowl XL in what is considered one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. Coincidentally, Enberg also called a previous playoff game between the two teams for NBC, the 1995 AFC Championship Game, a 20-16 Steelers victory that is often marked as one of the NFL&#x27;s greatest games.

Another enduring element of Enberg&#x27;s broadcasting legacy was his ability to provide warm and poignant reflections on the sporting events he covered. &quot;Enberg Essays&quot;, as they came to be known, were a regular feature of CBS&#x27;s coverage of college basketball&#x27;s Final Four.

On March 27, 2010, Enberg called his final college basketball game for CBS, an East Regional tournament final featuring the Kentucky Wildcats versus the West Virginia Mountaineers. After becoming the Padres&#x27; play-by-play announcer, Enberg said he hoped to continue calling late-season NFL games for CBS, but his name was omitted from the network&#x27;s announcing roster for 2010. He continued to call the US Open for CBS through 2011.

Enberg returned to call one match and serve as an essayist during the 2014 US Open, to help commemorate CBS&#x27;s last year covering the event before ESPN took over in 2015.

On September 14, 2009, Juan Martín del Potro defeated Roger Federer to win the Men&#x27;s US Open Championship. Enberg hosted the post-match ceremony during which del Potro requested to address his fans in Spanish. Enberg declined the request saying that he was running out of time but went on to list the corporate sponsored prizes del Potro won. A couple of minutes later, Del Potro made the same request again and only then Enberg relented saying &quot;Very quickly, in Spanish, he wants to say hello to his friends here and in Argentina&quot;. An emotional del Potro finally spoke a few sentences in Spanish to a cheering crowd. Many viewers expressed disappointment with Enberg and CBS over the interview. A CBS executive later defended Enberg, noting that the contract with the United States Tennis Association required that certain sponsors receive time during the ceremony.

==ESPN (2004–2011)==
Beginning in 2004, Enberg served as a play-by-play announcer for ESPN2&#x27;s coverage of the Wimbledon and French Open tennis tournaments, adding the Australian Open the following year. Enberg came to ESPN on lease from CBS, where he already called the US Open, the one Grand Slam tournament not covered by ESPN until 2009. At the 2004 French Open, Enberg called a match per day and also provided his &quot;Enberg Moments&quot;. At Wimbledon in 2004, he participated in a new one-hour morning show called &quot;Breakfast at Wimbledon&quot;. ESPN asked CBS for permission to use Enberg during the summer of 2004 at both the French Open and Wimbledon. Enberg then surprised his new bosses by volunteering for the 2005 Australian Open in January 2005. &quot;I&#x27;ve never been to Australia,&quot; he said. &quot;At my age then [69], to be able to work a full Grand Slam is something I&#x27;d like to have at the back of my book.&quot; Enberg stopped calling the French Open after 2009 due to his Padres commitments, though he continued to call the Wimbledon and Australian Open tournaments over the next two years. In June 2011, it was reported that his ESPN contract had ended and that the 2011 Wimbledon tournament would be his final one for ESPN.

==San Diego Padres==

In December 2009, Enberg was hired as a television play-by-play announcer by the San Diego Padres, signing a multi-year deal to call 110–120 games a season for channel 4SD. Enberg primarily teamed with Mark Grant on the Padres&#x27; telecasts.

In his debut season as a Padres broadcaster, Enberg took some criticism from fans over a perceived lack of enthusiasm for the home team. Told that he was regarded by some viewers as getting &quot;too excited&quot; over plays by opposing players, Enberg responded, &quot;I find that a real compliment.&quot; He did move to placate the critics, however, by limiting the use of his signature home run call of &quot;Touch &#x27;em all!&quot; to Padres home runs.

In 2012, Enberg returned as play-by-play voice of the Padres as they moved their telecasts from 4SD to Fox Sports San Diego, in the first year of a 20-year deal between the team and the newly formed network. On September 23, 2015, Enberg indicated he would call Padres games for one more season in 2016, then retire.

On May 21, 2016, Enberg served as a special guest play-by-play broadcaster for the Detroit Tigers in their home game with the Tampa Bay Rays, calling the game on Fox Sports Detroit alongside analyst Kirk Gibson. The Tigers were Enberg&#x27;s boyhood team, as he lived in the Detroit area. Enberg also called a weekend series for the Tigers post retirement, an interleague series between the Tigers and the Dodgers, August 18–20, 2017 for FSD and one game for FS1.

Enberg&#x27;s last game with the Padres was October 2, 2016. In his last week on air, he made a guest appearance with Los Angeles Dodgers announcer Vin Scully, who also was retiring at the end of the baseball season, after a 67-year career.

==Other appearances==
In 2006 and 2007, Enberg called Thursday night and postseason NFL games for Westwood One radio. Also in 2006, he began narrating a documentary style television series for Fox Sports Net called &quot;In Focus on FSN&quot;. For Fox Sports Net, he called his final college basketball game on November 11, 2012, aboard the alongside Steve Kerr.

In addition to his career in sports broadcasting, Enberg hosted three game shows besides the aforementioned &quot;Sports Challenge&quot;: &quot;The Perfect Match&quot; in 1967, &quot;Baffle&quot; on NBC from 1973 through 1974, and &quot;Three for the Money&quot; on NBC in 1975. He also lent his voice to the animated CBS cartoon series &quot;Where&#x27;s Huddles?&quot; (1970), the film &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975), and the American-dubbed version of the animated UK Christmas special &quot;Robbie the Reindeer: Hooves of Fire&quot; (2002); made appearances in the films &quot;Two-Minute Warning&quot; (1976), &quot;Gus&quot; (1976), &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978), &quot;The Longshot&quot; (1986), &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; (1988), and &quot;Mr. 3000&quot; (2004); and appeared as himself in episodes of such television programs as &quot;The King of Queens&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In addition, Enberg was seen in a series of commercials for GTE during the 1980s and early 1990s, and was the voice of the announcer in the classic &quot;Talking Football&quot; tabletop game from Mattel.

==Honors==
Enberg garnered many awards and honors over the years, including 13 Sports Emmy Awards (as well as a Lifetime Achievement Emmy), nine National Sportscaster of the Year awards from the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association (and induction into that organization&#x27;s Hall of Fame), five Sportscaster of the Year awards from the American Sportscasters Association (which also ranked Enberg tenth in its 2009 listing of the Top 50 Sportscasters of All Time), the Pete Rozelle Award from the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Curt Gowdy Award from the Basketball Hall of Fame, the Ford Frick Award from the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Enberg is the only sportscaster thus far to win Emmys in three categories (broadcasting, writing, and producing), and in 1973 became the first U.S. sportscaster to visit the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Enberg was inducted into Central Michigan University&#x27;s Athletics Hall of Fame in 1993. The university named an academic center for him in 2007. A student-athlete award in Enberg&#x27;s name is presented annually to a Central Michigan student.

Enberg was raised in Armada, Michigan and was responsible for the naming of the Armada High School yearbook, the Regit (Tiger spelled backwards), a name it has to this day. A hallway in the Macomb Academy of Arts and Sciences, which is run by Armada school district and shares the building with its administration office, was named after him.

UCLA named its Media Center in Pauley Pavilion after Enberg in 2017 in his honor.

Indiana University awarded Enberg an honorary doctorate of humane letters in 2002. He would be inducted into the Indiana University Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame in the fall of 2006.

Enberg also received honorary doctorates of humane letters from his alma mater Central Michigan University in 1980 and Marquette University in 2009, and gave the addresses at both universities&#x27; May commencement ceremonies.

In 1997, the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) honored Enberg with an award in recognition of his longtime support of the organization&#x27;s Academic All-America program. The Dick Enberg Award is given annually to a person whose actions and commitment have furthered the meaning and reach of the Academic All-America Teams Program and/or the student-athlete while promoting the values of education and academics. Past recipients include Gerald Ford, Mike Krzyzewski, Pat Summitt, and Joe Paterno. Enberg continued to be an avid supporter of the program, often lending his voice to video presentations related to CoSIDA&#x27;s annual Academic All-America Hall of Fame ceremony.

In 2006, Enberg was Awarded the Ambassador Award of Excellence by the LA Sports &amp; Entertainment Commission for his involvement in the community.

For his contributions to the Rose Bowl game and parade through the years, Enberg was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame on December 31, 2011.

The National Baseball Hall of Fame named Enberg the 2015 recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award for excellence in baseball broadcasting. He was presented with the award in a ceremony during the Hall&#x27;s induction weekend on July 25, 2015. Enberg was the second American sportscaster (after Curt Gowdy) to be selected for broadcasting awards from each of the Halls of Fame in professional football, basketball and baseball.

On August 20, 2017, the Detroit Sports Media (formerly Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association) named Enberg the 2017 recipient of the DSM Ernie Harwell Lifetime Contribution Award for a lifetime of service to the sports broadcasting community.

==Personal life==
Although Enberg was Finnish on his paternal side, his surname was of Swedish origin. During an ESPN television broadcast from the Wimbledon tennis championships on June 24, 2010, Enberg said his father was born in Finland, and changed his name from the Finnish &quot;Katajavuori&quot; to the Swedish equivalent Enberg on arrival in the U.S. as he felt it would be a simpler name. The surname means &quot;juniper mountain.&quot; Enberg said it pleased him that Jarkko Nieminen was doing so well as Finland is close to his heart and it is a small nation with few tennis facilities.

While working at Saginaw, Michigan radio station WSAM early in his career, Enberg considered changing his name professionally to &quot;Dick Breen&quot; after being told that &quot;Enberg&quot; was too Jewish-sounding. The story of his surname is also detailed in his autobiography, &quot;Oh My!&quot;

Enberg was the father of actor Alexander Enberg, actor-musician Andrew Enberg, and daughter Jennifer Enberg by former wife Jeri Taylor. At the time of his death, he was married to his second wife, Barbara (née Almori), with whom he had one son, Ted Enberg (also a sportscaster), and two daughters, Nicole and Emily.

Ted Enberg is a play-by-play broadcaster for ESPN, Pac-12 Network and called the U.S. Open Tennis Championships in 2017. Ted currently resides in San Diego and has a sports podcast with PodcastOne entitled, &quot;Sound of Success&quot;. He is married to Sara Elizabeth Miller. Ted would ultimately portray his father in the 2022 HBO series &quot;Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty&quot;.

Enberg penned a one-man theatrical play titled &quot;COACH&quot;, as a tribute to his former television broadcast partner and late friend, Al McGuire, the extraordinary college basketball coach and commentator. It debuted at Marquette University&#x27;s Helfaer Theater in 2005. It drew positive reviews as an accurate portrayal of the eccentric coach. At the 2007 NCAA Final Four in Atlanta, Enberg presented three performances of &quot;COACH&quot; at the Alliance Theater. Those attending the April 1 matinée included Hall of Famers coach Dean Smith (whom McGuire defeated in the 1977 NCAA Championship in Atlanta) and former UCLA All-American center Bill Walton. The play was then performed at Hofstra University, near Al&#x27;s old neighborhood on Long Island in New York. It has since been booked in San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago, Portland, Maine, North Carolina and Indiana. The most recent performance was at the New York Athletic Club in Manhattan. Actor Cotter Smith portrayed McGuire in the one-man show.

Enberg served as Chairman of the American Sportscasters Association from 1983 until 2017. He was also a board member for the Lott IMPACT Trophy, which is named after Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Ronnie Lott and is given annually to college football&#x27;s Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year.

==Death==
Enberg died on December 21, 2017, in La Jolla, California, from a suspected heart attack. He was 82.

<text>The Internet Broadway Database (IBDB) is an online database of Broadway theatre productions and their personnel. It was conceived and created by Karen Hauser in 1996 and is operated by the Research Department of The Broadway League, a trade association for the North American commercial theatre community.

==History==
Karen Hauser, research director for the Broadway League, developed the Internet Broadway Database, which was launched in 1996 or 2001. Prior to that, she served as the League&#x27;s media director. She has written on the economic health of Broadway and how it contributes to New York City&#x27;s economy as well as that of the cities that touring productions visit. Hauser co-produced the 2000 production of Keith Reddin&#x27;s &quot;The Perpetual Patient&quot;.

==Overview==
This comprehensive history of Broadway provides records of productions from the beginnings of New York theatre in the 18th century up to today. Details include cast and creative lists for opening night and current day, song lists, awards and other interesting facts about every Broadway production. Other features of IBDB include an extensive archive of photos from past and present Broadway productions, headshots, links to cast recordings on iTunes or Amazon, gross and attendance information.

Its mission was to be an interactive, user-friendly, searchable database for League members, journalists, researchers, and Broadway fans.

The League recently added Broadway Touring shows to the database for ease of tracking shows that play in theatres across the country.

It is managed by Michael Abourizk of the Broadway League.

<doc id="1037351" wikidata="Q2442912" url="?curid=1037351" title="Tony Warren">
<text>Anthony McVay Simpson (8 July 1936 – 1 March 2016), publishing under pen name Tony Warren, was an English television screenwriter and actor, best known for creating the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. He created other television dramas and wrote critically acclaimed novels.

==Early life==
Warren was born in Harrogate but raised at 3 Wilton Avenue, Pendlebury, Lancashire. He attended Clarendon Road Primary School and Eccles Grammar School. He trained at the Elliott-Clarke theatre school in Liverpool. He adopted Warren as a stage name in his early acting career. He became a regular on BBC Radio &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; and acted in many radio plays, performing with many actors who later became household names through &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, most notably Violet Carson who played Ena Sharples and Doris Speed who played Annie Walker.

In his memoirs, &quot;Over the Airwaves&quot;, &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; producer Trevor Hill explains how Warren was an excitable young teenager at rehearsals, so much so that on one occasion Violet Carson warned &quot;If that boy doesn&#x27;t shut up, I&#x27;ll smack his bottom!&quot; During a later unexpected transmission break from London while performing at the Leeds studio, Carson played and sang to the children a dialect song called &quot;Bowtons Yard&quot; in which the storyteller speaks about his neighbours. Starting at Number 1 and ending at Number 12, the storyteller describes each person in turn and Warren later admitted this is what gave him the inspiration for &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

==Career==
Warren acted on stage and in several early ITV &quot;Plays of the Week&quot;.

According to BBC producer Olive Shapley who had worked with Warren on &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, the idea for &quot;Florizel Street&quot; (which became &quot;Coronation Street&quot;) came to him late one night in 1959 while they were returning to Manchester by train. Shapley recalled:

In 1960, Harry Elton at Granada commissioned a script from Warren for a show about &quot;a street out there&quot;. Warren wrote all 13 episodes of the serial that ITV initially decided to air. When the show became a success, as creator of the show, he continued to write scripts until 1968, after which he moved on to other fields. However, he continued to write occasional scripts until the late-1970s. He was also retained by ITV Studios as a consultant to &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. &quot;Created by Tony Warren&quot; appears in the closing credits of every &quot;Coronation Street&quot; episode to this day.

Warren made a cameo appearance in the 50th anniversary live episode of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in December 2010. He was played by David Dawson in the BBC drama &quot;The Road to Coronation Street&quot; in September that year.

In the 1990s he wrote a series of critically acclaimed novels: &quot;The Lights of Manchester&quot; (1991), &quot;Foot of the Rainbow&quot; (1993), &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; (1995) and &quot;Full Steam Ahead&quot; (1998).

He was the subject of a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; television programme on 11 October 1995.

==Awards and honours==
Warren won a number of awards, all in relation to devising &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. He received a Special Achievement Award in Soap at the 2000 British Soap Awards and the National Television Landmark Award in 2005. At the Royal Television Society awards, he was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award. The society described the show as &quot;the most successful television programme in British history&quot;.

In 1994, Warren was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire. In 2008 he was awarded an honorary degree from Manchester Metropolitan University &quot;in recognition for his contribution to ground-breaking television and creative writing which has helped put Manchester and Salford on the cultural map&quot;. In 2016, following his death, the British Soap Awards announced that they would be renaming their Outstanding Achievement Award (Off Screen) award to the Tony Warren Award.

==Personal life==
Warren was openly gay from his early years of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, at a time when homosexual acts were illegal. Warren battled with drug and alcohol addiction before attending rehabilitation.

He lived in Swinton, Salford, for over thirty years.

==Death==
Warren died on 1 March 2016 after a short illness, aged 79. His death was announced on &quot;Coronation Street&quot; Twitter account.

<text>Club de Fútbol Motagua (), formerly Club Deportivo Motagua up to 2017, is a professional association football club, located in Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras.

F.C. Motagua was founded as &quot;Club Deportivo Motagua&quot; on 29 August 1928. The club competes in the Honduran top division playing its home games at the Estadio Nacional Chelato Uclés. The club is one of the most successful and renowned in Honduras.

==History==

The club was founded on 29 August 1928. Three previous clubs, América, Honduras Atlética and Águila, were in the process of falling apart. Marco Antonio Ponce and Marco Antonio Rosa called a meeting and proposed that the clubs unite to form a new club, Motagua (named for a nearby river). After the success of the meeting, a board of directors was appointed.

The first game, played on 25 November 1928, was against Tejeros del España at La Isla. Constantine Gálvez &quot;Tatino&quot; was the captain and Daniel Bustillo was the manager. The team fought to a 1–1 draw.

The first international game was played on 9 April 1939 against Costa Rican side Orión at the San Felipe field in Tegucigalpa; Motagua were managed by Honduran coach Lurio Martínez and won the match 3–0 with three goals from &quot;Gorgojo&quot; Ramos.

===Professional Era===

The team debuted professionally in the 1965–66 season. It took them only three years to win their first-ever championship. Under the leadership of manager Rodolfo Godoy, Motagua surged past two-time defending champions Olimpia to win the 1968–69 title, with 39 points to the Olimpia&#x27;s 36. Godoy&#x27;s club completed the double that season by winning the first-ever Honduran Cup.

This was the beginning of a long run at or near the top of the table for Motagua; they finished second behind Olimpia in 1969–70, then won the 1970–71 crown. That last season ended with Motagua and Olimpia level on points, with Motagua hoisting the crown on goal difference. They would likely have won a third championship in 1972–73, as they led the table halfway through the season. However, the season was cancelled at its midway point, and the records expunged.

The rest of the 1970s remained a good time for Motagua. They won titles in 1973–74 and 1978–79, while finishing second in 1974–75 and 1976–77. The club had become established as one of the nation&#x27;s strongest, and when the Honduras national football team qualified to the World Cup Finals, they featured five Motagua players.

However, the 1980s were not as strong. Between 1979 and 1992, the club was locked out of the Honduran crown. It wasn&#x27;t until the end of the 1991–92 season that the drought was over. They claimed that title by beating Real España 1–0 in the championship playoffs. With the drought broken, Motagua began winning titles regularly. They claimed the Honduran Cup in 1993 and 1995, then claimed an unexpected championship in the 1998 Apertura, beating Real España 5–2 on aggregate in the championship final. They repeated as champions that October, beating Olimpia 1–0.

They did it again in 1999–2000, beating Olimpia on penalties in both the Apertura and Clausura finals. They added another title in the 2002 Apertura, beating Marathón on penalties in a thrilling 5–3 shootout. After a drought of nearly five years, Motagua returned to the top with a title in the 2006 Apertura (over Olimpia) and 2011 Clausura (again over Olimpia).

In 2013, a new golden age began. Diego Vásquez, a veteran Honduran keeper who had played in two stints for Motagua, took over. In just his second full season, Vasquez steered Motagua to the 2014 Apertura crown, beating Real Sociedad 2–1 in the championship final (Rubilio Castillo&#x27;s header was the winner). Three near misses followed, but in 2016–2017, Vasquez would lead the team to new heights.

It started with the 2016 Apertura. After taking 4th in the regular season, Motagua battled their way through the quarterfinals and semi-finals (beating Olimpia). Then they held off Platense 2–1 on aggregate to win the Apertura title. 
In the Clausura, they finished 2nd in the regular season, then stormed to the title, crushing Honduras Progreso 7–1 on aggregate.

Vasquez, who remains Motagua&#x27;s manager, is the longest tenured manager in the history of Honduras&#x27;s top-flight; he has managed 200 consecutive matches with Las Aguilas.

Overall, between both amateur and professional seasons, Motagua has won 27 titles. They have won 16 professional titles. The club has participated in all Honduran top division seasons since its inception in 1965 and is one of the few unrelegated teams.

==The club==

===Colours and badges===


Motagua&#x27;s traditional colour is dark blue representing the blue waters of the Motagua River. This is because at the time the club was founded, the Motagua River was in dispute between Honduras and Guatemala. Since 2011, Motagua has worn pink jerseys for all their games during the month of October for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

The Motagua badge has a blue eagle. This is because one of the three clubs that united to become Motagua was named CD Águila, or Eagle in Spanish.

===Stadium===
Motagua plays their home matches at Estadio Nacional Chelato Uclés in Tegucigalpa. The stadium is named after Honduran football player and manager Chelato Uclés. The stadium is divided into &quot;Sol Norte, Sol Sur, Sol Centro, Preferencia, Silla&quot; and &quot;Palco&quot;. The Motaguan supporters &quot;&quot;La Revo&quot; are located at &quot;Sol Norte&quot; and the &quot;Macro Azurra&quot;&quot; sits in &quot;Sol Centro&quot;.

===Traditions===
There are some traditions within the Motagua institution.

Debuting players– When a new player debuts, he must shave his head. This is optional, most of the players that do shave are recently promoted from the reserve team or are young of age.

===Supporters===
Motagua has many supporters throughout Honduras. Motagua has one Barra Brava and three other supporters&#x27; groups. The barra brava is &quot;Los Revolucionarios del Motagua 1928&quot;, who call themselves &quot;La Revo&quot;. This fan group has &quot;bandas&quot; or smaller groups inside La Revo such as (from Tegucigalpa) &quot;Los Fuser&quot;, &quot;Los Dementes&quot;, &quot;Escuadron 57&quot;, &quot;Comando 21&quot;, &quot;Los Poltershe&quot;, &quot;Irreverentes&quot;, &quot;Capone&quot;, &quot;Infernales&quot;, &quot;Danger&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Anarkia&quot;, etc. (from Comayagua) &quot;C26&quot;, (from San Pedro Sula) &quot;Los Del Norte&quot;, (from La Ceiba) &quot;Revo Ceiba&quot;, (from Choluteca) &quot;Revo Choluteca&quot;, (from El Progreso) &quot;Revo Progreso&quot;, (from Siguatepeque) &quot;Revo Sigua&quot;. All of the &quot;bandas&quot; hang &quot;mantas&quot; or huge pieces of cloth saying their banda&#x27;s name inside the stadium. They also hang one with the barra&#x27;s website and many of Che Guevara. Matches from Motagua against Olimpia it&#x27;s illegal to hang these mantas because some of the members go to steal them and cause great scandal so police prefer banning this. La Revo don&#x27;t cause many scandals between other barras bravas in Honduras only with Olimpia&#x27;s Ultra Fiel. Throughout 2006–07 La Revo had problems with Marathon&#x27;s Furia Verde but they came to peace under the same belief in all of Honduras. &quot;Por Una Honduras Libre De Chucos&quot; which translates to &quot;For a Honduras free of Dirtbags&quot; (Chucos being Olimpia). Marathon, Real España and Motagua&#x27;s barra bravas all have a manta with this phrase.

Another of the biggest fan group is named &quot;Macro Azurra&quot; which is supported by the club. They can be easily be spotted in the stadium because they generally always have blue ballons. This group is bigger in the northern territory and is sponsored by the club and by FedEx

There are also two smaller groups one being &quot;Fortaleza Azul&quot; and &quot;JAH&quot; which stands for &quot;Justicia Amor y Humildad&quot; which means &quot;Justice Love and Humbleness&quot;. JAH is a religious based fan group which was founded by seven members of the Jehová es Nuestro Pastor church. JAH say that their trips are paid by God.

==Rivalries==

===Superclásico===

&quot;El Clasico Capitalino&quot; (The Capital&#x27;s Classic) or &quot;Superclásico Hondureño&quot; (Honduran Super Classic) is played between Motagua and Club Deportivo Olimpia. Their matches are also known as El Clasico Local (The Local Classic) in Tegucigalpa. There is a huge rivalry between the clubs and their fans; (&quot;La Ultra Fiel&quot; [of Olimpia] and &quot;La Revo&quot; [of Motagua]).

===Clásico de las M&#x27;s===
&quot;El Clásico de las M&#x27;s&quot; (The M&#x27;s Classic) or &quot;El Derbi de las M&#x27;s&quot; (The M&#x27;s Derby), is a derby football match played between Motagua from Tegucigalpa and C.D. Marathón from San Pedro Sula, two of the most successful and popular football teams in Honduras.

===Motagua–Real España===

The Motagua–Real España derby is not as fierce as the other two already mentioned as these both teams have a good relationship with each other from the players, to the board and the fans; however they had played seven intense league finals, four won by Real España and three by Motagua. It is one of the most even all-time series in the league.

===Short Lived===
One smaller rivalry, which might be called extinct, was against Universidad (also known as UNAH). The club named Universidad, represented the Honduran National Autonomous University in Tegucigalpa, and therefore shared the city with Motagua. This inspired a local derby until UNAH was relocated to Choluteca. UNAH, in various occasions left Motagua out of the play-offs, intensifying the rivalry. This derby can now be called extinct since Universidad were relegated to the Liga de Ascenso. The club was eventually sold to, and renamed, &quot;Universidad Pedagogica Nacional-Francisco Morázan&quot; (also known as UPNFM) (National Pedagogical University-Francisco Morázan).

==Honours==
Motagua is the second most successful club in Honduras having won 19 domestic leagues since the inauguration of the Honduran Liga Nacional in 1965–66.

<text>North Preston is a community located in Nova Scotia, Canada within the Halifax Regional Municipality.

The community is populated primarily by Black Nova Scotians. North Preston is the largest Black community in Nova Scotia by population, and has the highest concentration of African Canadians in Canada.

==History==

The community traces its origins from several waves of migration in the 18th and 19th centuries. The American Revolution brought Black Loyalists to the Preston area. The 1790s brought a different group of Black settlers to the regions, the Maroons from Jamaica. While many Maroons later left for Sierra Leone, a number stayed in Preston and Guysborough County. These groups were joined shortly after by a third migration starting in 1813, of Black refugees from the War of 1812. The Black Refugees came to Nova Scotia mostly from the Southern US states, bringing with them a strong Baptist tradition. These three major waves of migrants were also periodically joined by runaway slaves. In recent times, lifelong residents have been joined by small numbers of migrants from Ontario, the Caribbean, Africa, and the United States – many of whom are married into families in North Preston.

In 1842, the First Preston Church was organized for the area. In 1854, the African Baptist Association was organized by Richard Preston and Septimus Clarke to band together the Baptist churches across Nova Scotia, whose members were primarily black. A second church was organized in North Preston in 1856. This second church was called the “South Church” until 1879, when the congregation erected a new building. The church was renamed St. Thomas Church after their first pastor, John R. Thomas.

William Brown Sr. and William Arnold purchased land on the southern shore of Bedford Basin in the City of Halifax. In 1846, people migrated out of Preston (and Hammonds Plains) and began settling in the area, which gradually became known as Africville.

In 2014, a multi-purpose community centre designed to serve 5,000 residents was opened on Simmonds Road. An RCMP detachment was built adjoining the community centre, and serves North Preston, East Preston, Cherry Brook and Lake Loon. A $300,000 olympic-sized basketball court was constructed next to the community centre in 2019, as a result of the fundraising efforts of North Preston resident Shaquille Smith.

==Present day==

North Preston has a high home-ownership rate and a stable population, and has resisted gentrification through urban sprawl which has occurred in other Black Nova Scotian settlements. At $33,233, North Preston has a higher average income compared with the average of $31,795 for Nova Scotia. The community remains relatively isolated from the rest of Halifax, in its rural setting.

North Preston Day is an annual community festival and parade occurring each July 4. Many members of the community attend; the event is free and guests from outside of the community attend.

North Preston is served by Nelson Whynder Elementary School. A number of community buildings, a day care, a medical centre, a volunteer fire department and several local businesses are located in North Preston. Saint Thomas United Baptist Church forms the spiritual heart of the community.

There is some discrepancy about how many residents live in the community. The population estimates range from a low of 805 by the area&#x27;s city Councillor, to a high of 4,100 by The Globe and Mail.

<doc id="1037363" wikidata="Q5096756" url="?curid=1037363" title="Chief Illiniwek">
<text>Chief Illiniwek was the mascot of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), associated with the university&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic programs, from October 30, 1926, to February 21, 2007. Chief Illiniwek was portrayed by a student to represent the Illiniwek, the state&#x27;s namesake, although the regalia worn was from the Sioux. The student portraying Chief Illiniwek performed during halftime of Illinois football and basketball games, as well as during women&#x27;s volleyball matches.

Since the 1970s, Chief Illiniwek had been the center of a controversy between fans and alumni who view the mascot as part of the UIUC tradition; while Native American individuals and organizations, social scientists, and educators view such mascots as cultural appropriation of indigenous images and rituals, which perpetuate stereotypes about American Indian peoples. In 2005, Chief Illiniwek was one of 19 mascots cited as &quot;hostile or abusive&quot; by the NCAA in a policy that banned schools from full participation in postseason activities as long as they continued to use such mascots.

The University of Illinois retired Chief Illiniwek in 2007, with his last official performance on February 21, 2007. UIUC has not selected a replacement. A non-binding resolution to make &quot;Alma Otter&quot; the official mascot was placed on the spring 2019 student election ballot, but failed to receive a majority, although some see the vote as a sign of progress. In 2020, the belted kingfisher received a majority of student votes as a possible new mascot. In September 2020, the University Senate overwhelmingly endorsed the kingfisher as the new mascot, voting 105 to 2 with 4 abstaining. Support is building on campus and among alumni for the kingfisher, but as of December 2022, some alumni are opposed to the new mascot, and several online petitions continue to advocate for the return of Chief Illiniwek.

Supporters of Chief Illiniwek sometimes object to the use of the term &quot;mascot&quot;, and instead refer to the Chief as a &quot;symbol&quot; of the university.

==Background==
Chief Illiniwek and the Chief Illiniwek logo—a stylized front view of an American Indian face and headdress—are trademarks of the University of Illinois. Licensed use of the logo by the university has been increasingly restrictive as a result of the ongoing controversy. Chief Illiniwek is not based on an actual American Indian chief, nor did a historical figure with this name ever exist.

Since he performed many of the functions of other schools&#x27; mascots, Chief Illiniwek is generally referred to as the university&#x27;s &quot;mascot&quot; in media reporting and academic sources regarding the controversy. Chief Illiniwek predates the use of mascots by most sports teams, adding strength to the claim that the portrayal was never a mascot at all. In the final years he did not perform at road games, since other Big Ten universities refused to allow the character to perform at their home games, citing him as offensive.

During sporting events, Chief Illiniwek was portrayed by a student selected via audition and wearing authentic Lakota (Sioux) clothing. The portrayal also included a dance that originated from the first three portrayers&#x27; experience in the Boy Scouts of America, as taught by Ralph Hubbard, who had traveled widely in Europe and America staging &quot;Indian pageants&quot;. This dance corresponded to the music and lyrics of the &quot;Three in One&quot; performed by the university band, which is an arrangement of three original songs entitled &quot;The March of the Illini&quot;, &quot;Hail to the Orange&quot;, and &quot;Pride of the Illini&quot;.

==History==
The origin of Chief Illiniwek dates to 1926, when Ray Dvorak, assistant director of bands at the University of Illinois, conceived the idea of having a Native American war dance performed during halftime of Illinois football games. The first performance occurred on October 30, 1926 at Memorial Stadium during the halftime of a game against the University of Pennsylvania. At the conclusion of his performance, Illinwek was met at midfield by a drum major dressed as the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Quaker mascot, offered a peace pipe, and walked off the field arm in arm. Student Lester Leutwiler, an Eagle Scout, created the original costume and performed the dance based upon his experience as a Boy Scout. The expression Illiniwek (meaning &quot;the complete human being - the strong, agile human body, and the indomitable human spirit&quot;) was first used in conjunction with the University of Illinois football team by football coach Bob Zuppke, referring to the Illinois Confederation of Native Americans who historically had inhabited much of present-day Illinois.

Another student, A. Webber Borchers, was the only Chief to ride on horseback around the field and solidified the Chief tradition, continuing the performances and soliciting contributions for a permanent costume in 1930. Since then, the costume has been replaced several times, most recently in 1982. The current costume was sold to the university marching band by Frank Fools Crow, chief of the Oglala Sioux (a nation unrelated to the Illiniwek), after being sewn by his wife. He visited the campus in 1982 to present the regalia during halftime of a football game at the request of then-Assistant Director of Bands and Director of Athletic Bands Gary Smith. The costume contained real eagle feathers, but because eagle feathers are sacred to Native Americans, and because they came from a species protected by the Lacey Act of 1900, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (1940), the Migratory Bird Act, and at that time the Endangered Species Act, the feathers in the headdresses worn by the Chief were replaced with dyed turkey feathers after requests from the family of Chief Fools Crow.

A total of 36 different students officially performed the role of the Chief. All but one have been men: one woman, Idelle (Stith) Brooks, served in 1943 due to the shortage of male students during World War II; she was called &quot;Princess Illiniwek.&quot; No student portraying Chief Illiniwek was of American Indian heritage during the 82 year span, although Brooks, a journalism major who had grown up on the Osage Reservation in Fairfax, Oklahoma, was described as an &quot;honorary princess of the Osage Indian tribe&quot;. Brooks weighed 90 pounds and her Chief regalia weighed 50.

The actual descendants of the Illiniwek opposed the Chief (see Controversy, below). Whereas, when in May 1995, a WICD reporter interviewed members of the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, Chief Don Giles said, &quot;We do not have a problem with the mascot.&quot;, by 2000, the tribal council, under a new chief, passed a resolution opposing the use of the Chief by the university. On January 17, 2007, the executive committee of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council, issued a resolution asking that the University of Illinois return the regalia to the family of Frank Fools Crow and cease the use of the Chief Illiniwek mascot. The resolution was delivered to the university&#x27;s board of trustees, UI President B. Joseph White, and Chancellor Richard Herman. The campus&#x27; Native American House was authorized by the Oglala Sioux to distribute the resolution to the public.

The Chief appeared at the university&#x27;s homecoming parade and pep rally until 1991.

==Controversy==
From the mid-1970s, the Chief was the subject of debate at the University of Illinois. In October 1989, Charlene Teters, a graduate student from the Spokane tribe, began protesting the Chief at athletic events after her young son and daughter&#x27;s reaction to the Chief&#x27;s dance at a basketball game. Soon, individuals and organizations, some from outside of the university, began to support the Chief&#x27;s elimination. Some academic departments adopted official stances in favor of retirement of the mascot. External organizations including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Education Association, Amnesty International, the Modern Language Association, and Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas also took positions in favor of retiring the Chief. In November 1989, the Illinois state legislature passed a resolution in support of the Chief.

Student and alumni organizations, such as the Honor the Chief Society and Chief Illiniwek Educational Foundation, are dedicated to explaining and preserving the tradition of Chief Illiniwek. The Students for the Chief group formed in 1990. Among the national Native American organizations which called for the retirement of the mascot were the National Congress of American Indians and the National Indian Education Association. At the Urbana-Champaign campus, the Native American House, the American Indian Studies program, and the Native American student organizations all called for its retirement.

Those in favor of retiring the Chief contended that the Chief misappropriates and misrepresents Native American culture and perpetuates harmful racial and ethnic stereotypes. They argued that this obstructed the creation of a diverse and tolerant learning community, harmed the reputation of the university, and promoted an inaccurate image of Native Americans. Those in support of the mascot claimed that he was a revered symbol representing not only a proud people but the great spirit of a great university.

A 1995 ruling by the United States Department of Education found that the mascot did not violate Native American students&#x27; civil rights. Also in 1995, the state legislature approved a bill making the Chief the &quot;official symbol&quot; of the university, but Governor Jim Edgar&#x27;s amendatory veto allowed the decision to remain with the university.

On January 13, 2000, the board of trustees of the University of Illinois passed a resolution concerning the issue of the continuation of the Chief Illiniwek performances at its athletic events. The resolution acknowledged the existence of a controversy. Pursuant to this resolution, the board retained Louis B. Garippo, a former circuit court judge in Cook County, to assist in conducting a dialogue on Chief Illiniwek. The Special Intake Session on Chief Illiniwek was held in Foellinger Auditorium on the Urbana campus on April 14, 2000. Garippo presided over the session, reviewed and compiled communications on the issue, and prepared a report to the board. Garippo&#x27;s task was to convey respondents&#x27; opinions to the board, not to make a recommendation on the status of Chief Illiniwek.

In 2006, the University Board of Trustees opted to study the issue and passed a resolution calling for &quot;a consensus conclusion to the matter of Chief Illiniwek.&quot; Many on both sides of the issue found this resolution problematic, given that former trustee Roger Plummer determined that a compromise on the issue was not possible. At that point, the board of trustees had not consulted on the matter with the faculty of the American Indian Studies Program.

In the past few years, opinion polls on the subject have not been much help in defining Native American opinion on the subject. In 2002, a Peter Harris Research Group poll of those who self-declared Native American ethnicity on a U.S. census showed that 81% of self-identified Native Americans support the use of Indian nicknames in high school and college sports, and 83% of Native Americans support the use of Indian mascots and symbols in professional sports. However, the methods and results of this poll have been disputed. A separate poll conducted by the Native-run newspaper &quot;Indian Country Today&quot; in 2001 reported that 81% of those polled &quot;indicated use of American Indian names, symbols and mascots are predominantly offensive and deeply disparaging to Native Americans.&quot;

A non-binding student referendum on Chief Illiniwek was conducted in March 2004. Of the approximately one-third of the student body who cast ballots, 69% of the voters favored retention of the Chief. Faculty have tended to be critical of the Chief. Another non-binding student referendum on Chief Illiniwek was conducted in February 2008. Of the approximately 23% of the student body who cast ballots, 79% (7,718) voted to show support for Chief Illiniwek, while 21% (2,052) voted to not show support.

===Position of the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma===
The Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma are the closest living descendants of the Illinois Confederation, having been relocated to Oklahoma in the 19th century. The position of the tribal leadership has evolved over the years. In a television interview with WICD-TV in 1995, Don Giles, then Chief of the Peoria Tribe, said, &quot;To say that we are anything but proud to have these portrayals would be completely wrong. We are proud. We&#x27;re proud that the University of Illinois, the flagship university of the state, a seat of learning, is drawing on that background of our having been there. And what more honor could they pay us?&quot; Supporting Chief Giles was another tribal elder, Ron Froman, who stated that the protesters &quot;don&#x27;t speak for all Native Americans, and certainly not us.&quot;

Ron Froman was later elected Chief, by which time his views on the Chief Illiniwek mascot had changed. In April 2000, following meetings with American Indian students attending the university, the tribal council, with Chief Froman&#x27;s support, passed by the margin of 3 to 2 a resolution requesting &quot;the leadership of the University of Illinois to recognize the demeaning nature of the characterization of Chief Illiniwek, and cease use of this mascots [sic]&quot;. Froman said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what the origination was, or what the reason was for the university to create Chief Illiniwek. I don&#x27;t think it was to honor us, because, hell, they ran our (butts) out of Illinois.&quot; This puts Chief Illiniwek in a position different from that of the mascots of other schools such as Florida State University, whose American Indian mascots are not opposed by the leadership of the corresponding tribes. In 2005, a new Chief, John P. Froman, when asked his position by the NCAA, indicated that &quot;the Chief was not representative of our tribe and culture, mainly because the costume is Sioux.&quot; In 2006, in response to a widely published column by journalist George Will in support of the mascot&#x27;s use, he wrote a letter reiterating the Peoria Tribe&#x27;s opposition to the mascot and decrying that the &quot;University of Illinois has ignored the tribe&#x27;s request for nearly five years.&quot;

===NCAA involvement===

In August 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the primary governing board for intercollegiate athletics, instituted a ban on schools that use what they call &quot;hostile and abusive American Indian nicknames&quot; from hosting postseason games, beginning February 2006. The University of Illinois was among the 18 schools subject to the ban which, among other things, prohibited the University from hosting NCAA-sponsored tournaments. The ban was soon expanded to include Bowl Championship Series-sponsored bowl games, starting with the 2006 football season. The university appealed the ban in October on the grounds that it violates NCAA bylaws and violated institutional autonomy.

On November 11, 2005, the NCAA, stating that it had &quot;found no new information relative to the mascot, known as &#x27;Chief Illiniwek&#x27; or the logo mark used by some athletics teams that depicts an American Indian in feathered headdress,&quot; upheld the ban on the University of Illinois. However, it did allow the continued use of the nicknames &quot;Illini&quot; and &quot;Fighting Illini&quot; by the university because they are based on the name of the state and not of American Indian descent. The university appealed the decision again on January 30, 2006, mere days before the deadline. While the NCAA Executive Committee granted an extension to April 28, the committee&#x27;s next meeting, to other schools affected by the ban, the University of Illinois requested a longer stay until May 15, the end of the current semester. The executive committee ignored the request for a longer stay and denied the university&#x27;s second appeal while indicating that no further appeals would be entertained.

The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; reported on August 31, 2006 that Chief Illiniwek would &quot;no longer be an official university mascot&quot; after the 2006–2007 basketball season. The paper also reported that the ownership of the Chief would be transitioned to an organization called the &quot;Council of Chiefs&quot; and made up of a number of people who have previously portrayed Chief Illiniwek. The next day, however, the university disputed the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; report. University sources confirmed that several former Chiefs had met with university officials to discuss preserving the mascot&#x27;s tradition but stated that the so-called &quot;Council of Chiefs&quot; did not exist as a formally organized group. A University spokesman stated that &quot;no decisions have been made&quot; regarding the mascot&#x27;s fate.

==Chief Illiniwek and the Fighting Illini==
Some have incorrectly linked Chief Illiniwek with the nickname Fighting Illini. Though many assume that both are based on Illinois&#x27; American Indian traditions, the name &quot;Illini&quot; was first associated with the school by the student newspaper, which in 1874 changed its name from &quot;The Student&quot; to &quot;The Illini&quot;.

The addition of the adjective &quot;fighting&quot; originated about five years before the appearance of Chief Illiniwek, as a tribute to Illinois soldiers killed in World War I. Similarly, the on-campus football venue, Memorial Stadium, was named in honor of those fallen soldiers. As stated above, the NCAA has exempted the names &quot;Illini&quot; and &quot;Fighting Illini&quot; from its ban on American Indian imagery, as these names are purely based on the name of the state, and not a Native American tribe.

The state of Illinois was named by French explorers after the indigenous Illiniwek people, a consortium of Algonquian tribes which thrived in the area.

The word &quot;Illiniwek&quot; or &quot;iliniwek&quot; is the plural form of &quot;ilinwe&quot; and means &quot;those who speak in the ordinary way,&quot; although it has often been mistranslated as &quot;tribe of superior men.&quot;

==Retiring Chief Illiniwek==
On February 16, 2007, Lawrence Eppley, chair of the board of trustees issued a unilateral ruling retiring Chief Illiniwek. Chief Illiniwek&#x27;s last performance, by the final Chief, Dan Maloney of Galesburg, Illinois, took place on February 21, 2007 at the last men&#x27;s home basketball game of the 2006–2007 regular season against Michigan, in Assembly Hall. As at the time, Chief Illiniwek also performed at women&#x27;s home basketball games, the first halftime performance without the portrayal of Chief Illiniwek was the following night, February 22, 2007, at the women&#x27;s basketball game against Michigan State.

On March 13, 2007, the University of Illinois board of trustees voted to retire Illiniwek&#x27;s name, image and regalia.

In February 2007, the National Congress of American Indians thanked the university and commended them for retiring Chief Illiniwek.

==After retirement==
On October 4, 2009, the University of Illinois gave the Chief Illiniwek regalia to the Oglala Lakota. The media were denied entry to this event, which was called a &quot;private function&quot; by associate director of athletics Dana Brenner. The university did not offer a public statement about the return.

Students and fans still chant &quot;Chief&quot; during the performance of Three In One during halftime. Since neither the NCAA nor the university have any control over what the fans chant, opposition groups have called to additionally ban the Three In One performance.

In April 2014, an indigenous student, Xochitl Sandoval, sent a letter to the university administration (which she also posted on her Facebook page) describing her thoughts of suicide resulting from the daily insults she felt due to the continued presence of &quot;The Chief&quot; on campus, including other students wearing the old image and name on sweatshirts and the continued &quot;unofficial&quot; performances by the current &quot;Chief&quot;, Ivan A. Dozier. She stated that these thoughts came as a result of her feeling that she had no recourse because the university had not enforced its own policies regarding racism and the creation of a hostile environment for indigenous students such as herself; but had instead stated her only recourse would be personal action. Soon afterward there was a gathering on the Quad organized by the president of the Native American Indigenous Student Organization in support of Sandoval, and calling for further action by the university to eliminate the presence of the Chief on campus. The Campus Faculty Association (CFA) also issued a statement in support of Sandoval.

In May 2016, the university announced that a process was underway to select a &quot;first-ever athletic mascot&quot; for the university—the phrase evidently recognizing the argument by some Chief supporters that the Chief was not a mascot but a &quot;symbol.&quot;

In August 2017, University Chancellor Robert Jones made the decision to ban the school&#x27;s &quot;War Chant&quot;, in response to critic claims that said the music stereotyped Native Americans and prolonged the divisive debate over Chief Illiniwek. &quot;&quot;Debating it was not going to do anything but kind of re-initiate a lot of the agony and the angst that have been a cancer that has been eating away at this university for more than a decade,&quot; Jones said of the closed-session ruling.
Later in 2017, a protest interrupted the school&#x27;s homecoming parade in response to the Unofficial chief marching with the Honor the Chief Society. Though touted as &quot;peaceful&quot;, both the Chancellor and the Chief portrayer were escorted away by police after an officer was assaulted on the hood of the Chancellor’s car. As of 2017, no one had been charged or held responsible. The following morning, a number of members of one Sioux nation hosted a powwow on campus bearing a banner reading &quot;The Fighting Sioux Support the Fighting Illini&quot;. These performers were part of an organization known as NAGA (Native American Guardians Association). &quot;...the idea is to educate, not eradicate, and the idea is to improve what you have but never give up the opportunity to teach about Native Americanism.&quot; said Andre Billeaudeaux, executive director of NAGA.

===Proposed replacement mascots===

UIUC has not yet selected a replacement. A non-binding resolution to make &quot;Alma Otter&quot; the official mascot was placed on the spring 2019 student election ballot, but failed to receive a majority, although some saw the vote as a sign of progress. In 2020 the belted kingfisher received a majority of student votes as a possible new mascot. In September 2020 the University Senate overwhelmingly endorsed the kingfisher as the new mascot, voting 105 to 2 with 4 abstaining.

The belted kingfisher, a bird local to Illinois whose female is orange and blue, has been proposed as a replacement mascot. The kingfisher as a mascot has been endorsed by the American Indian Center of Chicago, the Chicago Tribune editorial board, and the Champaign Audubon Society. In December 2022, the National Congress of American Indians endorsed efforts to find a replacement mascot, though the kingfisher was not explicitly mentioned. Supporters of the Kingfisher have dubbed the bird &quot;naturally true to the orange and blue.&quot;

In February 2023, the Association on American Indian Affairs endorsed adopting a new mascot, saying, “Retiring harmful imagery is commendable but not formally replacing that imagery allows for stereotypes to continue and fails to give the University community a new identity that is truly representative of them.”

In July 2023, the Native American Rights Fund endorsed the belted kingfisher as a replacement mascot.

In 2023, a group of students and faculty created a costume for the unofficial kingfisher mascot, and the kingfisher has made appearances on campus.

===Selection of unofficial chief portrayers===
In April 2008, the &quot;Council of Chiefs&quot;, a group of previous Chief Illiniwek performers, named a student to portray the chief, although this portrayal is not sanctioned or endorsed by the university. Logan Ponce, a Latino student, was chosen as the 37th portrayer. Ponce expressed the ultimate goal of returning the Chief to the university. &quot;It&#x27;s unique to Illinois and has been such an important part of our history,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s part of our heritage. We look forward to continuing it.&quot;

In May 2010 the Students for Chief Organization chose a new student to serve as the 38th chief portrayer: Ivan A. Dozier, who is of Cherokee ancestry. (The Cherokee Nation officially opposes American Indian mascots.) Dozier performed as Chief at the &quot;Next Dance&quot; event over homecoming weekend at the university in 2010. He also appeared in regalia at numerous sporting events throughout the years. Bennett Kamps was select to replace Dozier upon his graduation, with an initial appearance in February, 2016. In 2017 the portrayer was Omar Cruz Aranda.

===Unofficial performances and events===
An event called &quot;Students for Chief Illiniwek Presents: The Next Dance,&quot; happened on November 15, 2008 following the football game against Ohio State University, in the Assembly Hall. &quot;We want to do this event on a very exciting day for Illini fans and we want it to be a complement to that day&#x27;s game,&quot; said Roberto Martell Jr., former president of Students for Chief Illiniwek and a junior in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. An open letter was sent forth by the Native American House encouraging the entire university community to speak out against the event.

On February 26, 2010 the webpage of Students for Chief Illiniwek posted nearly fifty email correspondences, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, of several members of the university administration attempting to prevent the &quot;Next Dance&quot; portrayals. Parties involved include Renee Romano, Anna Gonzalez, Robert Warrior, and then-Chancellor Richard Herman. The emails include conversations between Romano and Richard Herman appreciating &quot;the fact that we&#x27;ve been trying to get in the way of allowing the students for the chief to perform a dance in the assembly hall and &quot;trying to think of a reason to deny them access to Assembly Hall on Oct. 2.&quot; The revelation of free speech violations by the administrators was criticized by free-speech advocates, including the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which currently gives the University of Illinois a yellow light rating.

In October 2012, the Chief made an unsanctioned halftime appearance at Memorial stadium, in the Homecoming football game against Indiana.

In January 2015, an unofficial appearance at Tuscola High School, by former portrayer Ivan A. Dozier, was cancelled. School officials removed the announcement post from social media saying they did not have the time or personnel to address the bad language and personal attacks that were made in the online comments. The School District announced via Twitter that the appearance was cancelled &quot;In order to ensure highest level of student/community safety.&quot;

The Council of Chiefs, Students for Chief Illiniwek, and Honor the Chief Society posted events on Facebook encouraging fans to wear &quot;Chief&quot; gear to the basketball game with Purdue on February 22, 2018. Entitled &quot;Paint the Hall Chief&quot;, and started by several female members of the community, the posting prompted the university to request that Facebook remove the events due to copyright infringement of the original Chief Illiniwek logo; which Facebook refused to do because the image used is significantly different than the original, constituting legal &quot;fair use&quot;. At the game, about 100 protestors assembled at the main entrance to the State Farm Center displaying signs and chanting opposition to the Chief.

University employee Jay Rosenstein was arrested for allegedly stalking and invasion of privacy after he followed Dozier and the current unofficial portrayer of the Chief into a public bathroom at the Assembly Hall on January 22, 2018, and allegedly recorded them in a state of undress. No charges were filed by the states attorney. Dozier filed suit against Rosenstein in January 2019; the judge rejected Rosenstein&#x27;s motion to dismiss and the lawsuit can proceed.

===Chancellor&#x27;s Commission===
The effort to resolve the controversy by the current chancellor, Robert J. Jones has included the work of a committee that issued a report of its &quot;critical conversations&quot; that included over 600 participants representing all sides, which remain sharply divided. The chancellor has appointed a Commission on Native Imagery: Healing and Reconciliation to implement the recommendations of the committee.

In 2019 the Office of the Chancellor issued a report with four goals and recommendations.
#&quot;Provide closure, healing and reconciliation for stakeholders&quot; - Recommendations include a formal event recognizing the public retirement of Chief Illiniwek, establishing a plaque or monument outside Memorial Stadium commemorating the history, the original intent of the Chief, and the University’s decision to retire the tradition to better align with current educational perspectives on diversity and inclusion.
#&quot;Facilitate the establishment of new traditions&quot; - Engaging all key stakeholders in identifying new tradition(s) such as music, symbols, branding, marketing, or a mascot that do not rely upon Native American images or traditions.
#&quot;Remember the history of the Chief with a focus on both the intent and impact of the tradition&quot; - Development of an historically accurate account documenting the Illini, Fighting Illini, and Chief Illiniwek.
#&quot;Honor and partner with the Native Nations for whom Illinois is their ancestral home&quot;

Both sides of the debate immediately criticized the report. Pro-chief members of the commission characterized the exclusion of Native American imagery from future traditions as &quot;discriminatory&quot; while opponents view the Chief as a racist past that should be not be commemorated.

Subsequent to the release of the commission report, several dozen current and former faculty (out of over 2,000 on campus) signed a letter urging the NCAA to once again prohibit the UI from hosting postseason competitions until it “fully complies” with NCAA policies on the use of native imagery in sports. The continued presence of the Chief&#x27;s image on campus and the use of the nickname &quot;Fighting Illini&quot; were cited as examples of policy violations. Chancellor Jones responded that these were not violations.

====Implementation Plan on Native Imagery====
In December 2020 chancellor Robert J. Jones announced the Implementation Plan on Native Imagery, a set of reforms planned for the following three years. These included expanding the school&#x27;s American Indian Studies program, repatriating sacred artifacts to indigenous people, offering in-state tuition to students from federally recognized tribal nations, having a campus historian develop an accurate history of the school&#x27;s use of Native American symbols, and creating a council to develop new traditions for the student body. The plan does not address the adoption of a new sports mascot, or the possibility of changing the name of the Fighting Illini sports teams.

<text>Club Social y Deportivo Municipal, also known as Municipal or Los Rojos (the Reds), are a Guatemalan professional football club based in Guatemala City.

They compete in the Liga Nacional, the top tier of Guatemalan football, and play their home matches at the &quot;Estadio El Trébol&quot;. As of 2015, they are the team that has remained the most years at the top level in Guatemala, having done so since the inception of the national league in 1942. They have won the domestic league 32 times, most recently winning the 2024 &quot;Clausura&quot; tournament. They won the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup in 1974.

Municipal are the most popular football club in Guatemala and are traditional rivals of Comunicaciones, who are also based in Guatemala City, and with whom they share the lead in all-time league titles in the country with 32 each as of 2024.

==History==
The club was founded on May 17, 1936, by workers of the &quot;Ayuntamiento&quot; (city hall) of the Guatemala City municipality, hence the name &quot;Municipal&quot;. They were first promoted to the top division, (then called &quot;Liga Capitalina)&quot; in 1938. They finished in second place in their debut season, and have since remained in the top division.

===Early domestic success (1940s–1960s)===
The team won its first national league title in the 1942–43 tournament, the first ever official national league championship in Guatemala. They won three of the following six tournaments, the other three being won by Tipografía Nacional, whom which they had their first known rivalry. Municipal were coached by Manuel Felipe Carrera, one of the original founders of the club, and whose name was later given to the stadium where the team currently practices.

During the 1940s and early 1950s, Municipal&#x27;s most iconic player was the forward Carlos &quot;Pepino&quot; Toledo, who wore the red shirt throughout his career. He helped the club win their first four league titles, the last of them coming at the 1954–55 tournament (also the year Toledo retired). His career total of 129 goals remains the fourth-highest in club history. His national level talent called him to the national team. Later, he became Municipal&#x27;s coach.
In 1948, Municipal won its first international honors at a friendly tournament held in Havana, Cuba to commemorate the Cuban Independence. That squad featured Toledo, Mario Camposeco, and goalkeeper José Pedro &quot;Tarzán&quot; Segura.

The end of the 1950s were a darker time for Municipal. Toledo had retired and Comunicaciones had dethroned them at the top of the league, winning it three consecutive seasons. Municipal struggled through an eight-year title drought. They managed to break that drought with three championships in the 1960s (1963–64, 1965–66, and 1969–70), but Comunicaciones remained Guatemala&#x27;s dominant team, winning seven titles in 14 years from 1956–72. The Comunicaciones-Municipal match emerged as a high-profile local derby, the biggest in the country. Another rivalry developed with a third Guatemala City club, Aurora, which also won three titles during this time.

===1970s: First international success===
In 1973, Uruguayan coach Rubén Amorín arrived at Municipal. He managed a group of players that included defender Alberto López Oliva, midfielders Benjamín Monterroso and José Emilio &quot;Pepe&quot; Mitrovich, and forward Julio César Anderson. Anderson would become the club&#x27;s highest-ever goalscorer, and help lead the team to its era of greatest glory. Municipal won league championships in both 1973 and 1974 (their first repeat titles). In 1974, the same year they were marching to a dominant repeat championship, they became the first Guatemalan club to win the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. The &quot;Rojos&quot; then went on to play the &quot;Copa Interamericana&quot; against Argentina&#x27;s &quot;red team&quot;, Independiente.

The first leg was played in Guatemala on November 24, 1974, and Independiente won, 1-0. However, Municipal surprised the continent by winning 1-0 in Argentina two days later. The hero was Argentine-born José Emilio &quot;Pepe&quot; Mitrovich in the second half. With both teams equal in points and goal difference, the match went to extra time. No further goals were scored, and the match went into penalty kicks. Misses by Julio César &quot;Morocho&quot; Anderson and Benjamín &quot;Mincho&quot; Monterroso allowed Independiente to prevail, 4-2, but Municipal had earned continental respect.

===1980s: Almost relegated===
Municipal&#x27;s glory years continued with another league title in 1976, but their results began to fade. They finished 8th in 1979-80, and in 1981 they fell even further to 11th, forcing them into a relegation mini-league. Ironically, their safety was secured when old rivals Tipografía Nacional were relegated instead. In 1982, the club came even closer to oblivion, finishing 9th in the regular season. That result put them back in the relegation mini-league, and this time they escaped only on goal differential. Over the next several years, Municipal put some distance between themselves and the bottom of the table, but they would not seriously challenge for another title until 1987.

===1980s and 1990s: Return to the top===
1987 was the year that Argentine coach Miguel Ángel Brindisi arrived in Guatemala City. A former midfield star who had won two Argentine titles and played a stint in Spain, he came to Municipal with just one year of managerial experience. His two years in Guatemala saw brilliant success. In 1987, they beat Aurora 4-2 on penalties to win a championship playoff and claimed another Guatemalan title since 1976. A year later, they repeated as champs for the first time since the early 1970s. Brindisi moved on to manage Barcelona SC in Ecuador, but successor Walter Ormeño kept the momentum by guiding the team to a third consecutive title.

In 1990-91, Municipal came within one match of a fourth consecutive title, but bowed 1-0 to Comunicaciones in the championship final. They avenged that defeat in 1991-92, beating Comunicaciones 2-1 in a championship playoff replay. That made it four titles in five years.

The team reached the finals of the CONCACAF Champions Cup in December 1993, narrowly losing to Costa Rican champions Saprissa. They did manage to claim some silverware from the season, winning the Guatemalan championship for the fifth successive time in seven seasons.

===2000s: A Decade of Success===
In 2000, after the league&#x27;s competition format was changed to two yearly tournaments on the Apertura and Clausura fashion, Municipal won the title again after Comunicaciones had set a record by winning the previous four; Municipal surpassed that record in 2006 when they won the 2006 &quot;Apertura&quot; tournament, their fifth consecutive title, under coach Enzo Trossero. They also added third and fourth Central American titles by winning the Copa Interclubes UNCAF in 2001 and 2004.

==Colours and crest==
Initially, the team&#x27;s uniform colors consisted of a red-and-black striped shirt and black shorts. The colors soon changed to the current red shirt and blue shorts for home matches, and all blue for away matches, although other colors have been used for away matches.

The club&#x27;s logo is based in the emblem of the &quot;Municipalidad de Guatemala&quot;, which is itself based in the original coat of arms of the city of &quot;Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala&quot;, with the image of Apostle Santiago (Saint James) over the stylized scenery of the region. The team&#x27;s version includes an image of the type of ball used at the time the club was founded, next to a blue and red striped canton in between the former two elements. The circular field is surrounded by the name of the team on a red background.

==Stadium==
Throughout the years, Municipal has used the Estadio Doroteo Guamuch Flores as their home ground, sharing it with Comunicaciones since the 1950s until 1991, and again starting in 2005. Other stadiums hosted Municipal in the beginning, namely the &quot;Estadio Autonomía&quot;. The Estadio La Pedrera has been used when the Mateo Flores has not been available and houses a soup kitchen in the basement. The Estadio Manuel Felipe Carrera, also known as &quot;Estadio El Trébol&quot;, has been the training venue for the team, and it has been occasionally used for official matches by the club; Municipal had an undefeated streak of 33 official matches in this ground from July 9, 1991, until March 7, 2008, when they lost to Deportivo Petapa 1–0 for the 2008 Clausura tournament.

==Supporters==
Municipal is believed to have the largest fan base of all Guatemalan clubs, and that their popularity have earned them nicknames like &quot;El mimado de la afición&quot; (Fans&#x27; pampered team) and &quot;El equipo del pueblo&quot; (People&#x27;s team).

==Statistics and records==
Municipal has set a record in Guatemalan football by being the club that has spent the most consecutive seasons in the maximum division, having remained there uninterruptedly since 1938.

Juan Carlos Plata is the team&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer in league matches and overall. As of the end of 2010, Plata has scored 299 league goals and 403 overall goals with Municipal, the only club he has played for.

<text>Indian Union Muslim League (abbreviated as the IUML or Muslim League) is a political party primarily based in Kerala. It is recognised as a State Party in Kerala by the Election Commission of India.

After the Partition of India, the first Council of the Indian segment of the All-India Muslim League was held on 10 March 1948 at the south Indian city of Madras (now Chennai). The party renamed itself as the &#x27;Indian Union Muslim League&#x27; and adopted a new constitution on 1 September 1951.

IUML is a major member of the opposition United Democratic Front, the INC-led pre-poll state level alliance in Kerala. Whenever the United Democratic Front rules in Kerala, the party leaders are chosen as important Cabinet Ministers. The party has always had a constant, albeit small, presence in the Indian Parliament. The party is a part of the INDIA in national level. The League first gained a ministry (Minister of State for External Affairs) in Indian Government in 2004.

The party currently has five members in Parliament - E. T. Mohammed Basheer, M. P. Abdussamad Samadani and Kani K. Navas in the Lok Sabha and P. V. Abdul Wahab and Adv. Haris Beeran in the Rajya Sabha - and fifteen members in Kerala State Legislative Assembly.

==History ==

The first Muslim political agency in the region was the Kerala Muslim Majlis formed in 1931. It joined the federal setup of All-India Muslim League later.

After the partition of India in 1947, the All-India Muslim League was virtually disbanded. It was succeeded by the Indian segment of the Muslim League in the new Dominion of India (first session on 10 March 1948 and constitution passed on 1 September 1951). M. Muhammad Ismail, the then President of the Madras unit of the Muslim League was chosen as the Convener of the Indian segment of the party. The Travancore Muslim League (the States&#x27; Muslim League) was merged with the Malabar League in November 1956.

Indian Union Muslim League contests General Elections under the Indian Constitution. The party is normally represented by two members in the Indian Lower House (the Lok Sabha). B. Pocker, elected from Malappuram Constituency, was a member of the First Lower House (1952–57) from the Madras Muslim League. The party currently has four members in Parliament.

Apart from Kerala and West Bengal, the League had Legislative Assembly members in Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, Maharastra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Assam. In West Bengal, the League had won Assembly seats in the 1970s, and A. K. A. Hassanussaman was a member of the Ajoy Mukherjee cabinet.

Indian Union Muslim League first gained a ministry in Kerala Government as part of the Communist Party of India Marxist-led United Front in 1967. The party switched fronts in 1969 and formed an alliance with the Congress in 1976. It later became a chief constituent in a succession of Indian National Congress-led ministries.

==Controversies==

The party when in control of the local self-government department, issued a circular which legalised marriage for Muslim women between ages of 16 and 18 and Muslim men below age 21.The circular was later amended after backlash.

The Muslim League has opposed the Supreme Court of India verdict regarding entry of adult women to Sabarimala temple. It is also at odds with several LGBTQ rulings from the Supreme Court. The party also supports the primacy of Muslim Personal Law among Indian Muslims.

IUML opposes implementing gender neutrality and comprehensive sex education in school curriculum saying that it promotes homosexuality, leads to sexual anarchy and is part of an atheist-liberal conspiracy to destroy religious values.

An article by the current president of the Muslim League, on Hagia Sophia, seemed to support the views of political Islam.

Muslim League generally presents itself as a conservative political party in Kerala. In 2021, ten female leaders from the disbanded Haritha state committee lodged a police complaint against the state president of the Muslim Students Federation (MSF) and the Malappuram district general secretary, accusing them of making sexual remarks.

In July 2023, following the Manipur violence where a woman was paraded naked in public, members of the Muslim League raised anti Hindu slogans in Kanhangad, located in the Kasaragod district of Kerala. The following day, Kerala Police arrested five of those members. Upon criticism over the incident, the State President of IUML Panakkad Sayyid Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal responded on 28 July, saying no one has the right to hurt the sentiments and faith of others.

<text>The Knight of the Burning Pestle is a play in five acts by Francis Beaumont, first performed at Blackfriars Theatre in 1607 and published in a quarto in 1613. It is the earliest whole parody (or pastiche) play in English. The play is a satire on chivalric romances in general, similar to &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, and a parody of Thomas Heywood&#x27;s &quot;The Four Prentices of London&quot; and Thomas Dekker&#x27;s &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot;. It breaks the fourth wall from its outset.

==Text==

It is most likely that the play was written for the child actors at Blackfriars Theatre, where John Marston had previously had plays produced. In addition to the textual history testifying to a Blackfriars origin, there are multiple references within the text to Marston, to the actors as children (notably from the Citizen&#x27;s Wife, who seems to recognise the actors from their school), and other indications that the performance took place in a house known for biting satire and sexual innuendo. Blackfriars specialised in satire, according to Andrew Gurr (quoted in Hattaway, ix), and Michael Hattaway suggests that the dissonance of the youth of the players and the gravity of their roles combined with the multiple internal references to holiday revels because the play had a Shrovetide or midsummer&#x27;s day first production (Hattaway xxi and xiii). The play is certainly carnivalesque, but the date of the first performance is purely speculative. The second quarto publication came in 1635, with a third the same year. The play was omitted from the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647 but included in the second folio of 1679. The play was later widely thought to be the joint work of Beaumont and John Fletcher.

==Plot==
Scene: London and the neighbouring Country, except for Act IV Scene ii which is set in Moldavia.

As a play called &quot;The London Merchant&quot; is about to be performed, a Citizen and his Wife &#x27;in the audience&#x27; interrupt to complain that the play will misrepresent the middle-class citizens of the city. The Citizen, who identifies himself as a grocer, climbs onto the stage, bringing his Wife up to sit with him. They demand that the players put on a play of their own choosing and suggest that the Citizen&#x27;s own apprentice, Rafe, should be given a part. Rafe demonstrates his dramatic skills by quoting Shakespeare, and a part is created for him as a knight errant. He refers to himself as a &#x27;Grocer Errant&#x27; and has a burning pestle on his shield as a heraldic device.

This meta-plot is intercut with the main plot of the interrupted play, &quot;The London Merchant,&quot; in which Jasper Merrythought, the merchant&#x27;s apprentice, is in love with his master&#x27;s daughter, Luce, and must elope with her to save her from marriage to Humphrey, a City man of fashion. Luce pretends to Humphrey that she has made an unusual vow: she will only marry a man who has the spirit to run away with her. She knows that Humphrey will immediately inform her father. She intends to fake an elopement with Humphrey, knowing that her father will allow this to happen, but then to drop him and meet up with Jasper.

Meanwhile, Jasper&#x27;s mother has decided to leave her husband, Old Merrythought, who has spent all his savings in drinking and partying. When Jasper seeks his mother&#x27;s help, she rejects him in favour of his younger brother Michael. She tells Michael that she has jewellery that she can sell to live on while he learns a trade. They leave Merrythought, and lose themselves in a wood where she misplaces her jewellery. Jasper arrives to meet Luce and finds the jewels. Luce and Humphrey appear. Jasper, as planned, knocks over Humphrey and escapes with Luce. The Grocer Errant arrives, believing when he sees the distraught Mrs Merrythought that he has met a damsel in distress. He takes the Merrythoughts to an inn, expecting the host to accommodate them chivalrously without charge. When the host demands payment, the Grocer Errant is perplexed. The host tells him there are people in distress he must save from an evil barber named Barbaroso (a barber surgeon who is attempting cures on people with venereal diseases). He effects a daring rescue of Barbaroso&#x27;s patients.

The Citizen and his Wife demand more chivalric and exotic adventures for Rafe, and a scene is created in which the Grocer Errant must go to Moldavia where he meets a princess who falls in love with him. But he says that he has already plighted his troth to Susan, a cobbler&#x27;s maid in Milk Street. The princess reluctantly lets him go, lamenting that she cannot come to England, as she has always dreamed of tasting English beer.

Jasper tests Luce&#x27;s love by pretending he intends to kill her because of the way her father has treated him. She is shocked, but declares her devotion to him. Humphrey and her father arrive with other men. They attack Jasper and drag Luce away. The merchant locks Luce in her room. Jasper feigns death and writes a letter to the merchant with a pretend dying apology for his behaviour. The coffin, with Jasper hiding within, is carried to the merchant&#x27;s house, where Luce laments his demise. Jasper rises and explains his plan to save her from marriage to Humphrey: Luce is to take Jasper&#x27;s place in the coffin while Jasper remains hidden in the house. When the merchant enters, Jasper pretends to be his own ghost and scares the merchant into expelling Humphrey. A chastened Mrs Merrythought returns to her husband. Jasper reveals he is still alive. The merchant asks for Old Merrythought&#x27;s forgiveness and consents to Jasper&#x27;s match with Luce.

The Citizen and his Wife demand that Rafe&#x27;s part in the drama should also have an appropriate ending, and he is given a heroic death scene. Everyone is satisfied.

==Satire==

The play hits a number of satirical and parodic points. The audience is satirised, with the interrupting grocer, but the domineering and demanding merchant class is also satirised in the main plot. Beaumont makes fun of the new demand for stories of the middle classes for the middle classes, even as he makes fun of that class&#x27;s actual taste for an exoticism and a chivalry that is entirely hyperbolic. The Citizen and his Wife are bombastic, sure of themselves, and certain that their prosperity carries with it mercantile advantages (the ability to demand a different play for their admission fee than the one the actors have prepared).

The broader humour of the play derives from innuendo and sexual jokes, as well as joking references to other dramatists. The players, for example, plant a winking joke at the Citizen&#x27;s expense, as the pestle of Rafe&#x27;s herald is a phallic metaphor, and a burning pestle/penis implies syphilis, on the one hand, and sexual bravado, on the other. The inability of the Citizen and Wife to comprehend how they are satirised, or to understand the main plot, allows the audience to laugh at itself, even as it admits its complicity with the Citizen&#x27;s boorish tastes.

==Staging==

If written for Blackfriars, &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot; would have initially been produced in a small private theatre, with minimal stage properties. However, the private theatres were first to introduce the practice of having audience members seated on the stage proper (according to Gurr, &quot;op cit.&quot; in Hattaway ix), which is a framing device for this play&#x27;s action. Additionally, the higher cost of a private theatre (sixpence, compared to a penny at some public theatres) changed the composition of the audience and would have suggested a more critically aware (and demanding) crowd. The play makes use of several &quot;interludes,&quot; which would have been spare entertainments between the acts (but which are integrated into the performance in this case), again emphasising the smallness and spareness of the initial staging (as interludes would have allowed for technicians to arrange the lights and scenery and to put actors in place).

Revivals of the play are largely undocumented, but some are attested. Hattaway suggests that it was performed in the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane in 1635, at court the next year, and then after the Restoration at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in 1662 and again in 1665 and 1667 (Hattaway xxix). The play &quot;has proved popular with amateur and university groups,&quot; according to Hattaway, but not with professional troupes.

==Reception==
The play was a failure when it was first performed, although it won approval over the next generation or two. In Richard Brome&#x27;s &quot;The Sparagus Garden&quot; (1635), the character Rebecca desires to see it &quot;above all plays.&quot; Beaumont&#x27;s comedy was performed at Court by Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men on 28 February 1636 (new style).

==Revivals==

===London revivals===

The play was revived in London in 1904, with Nigel Playfair in the principal role of Rafe. In 1920 the young Noël Coward starred as Rafe in a Birmingham Repertory Theatre production which transferred to the West End. &quot;The Times&quot; called the play &quot;the jolliest thing in London&quot;. In 1932 the play was staged at the Old Vic, with Ralph Richardson as Rafe and Sybil Thorndike as the Citizen&#x27;s Wife. The Greenwich Theatre presented the play in 1975, with Gordon Reid as Rafe. The Royal Shakespeare Company performed it in 1981, with Timothy Spall in the lead. In a 2005 revival at the Barbican Theatre Rafe was played by Spall&#x27;s son Rafe, who was named after the character in the play. The play was performed as part of the opening season of the Sam Wanamaker Theatre in 2014.

===American productions===
In 1957 the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego presented &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot;. The American Shakespeare Center (then the Shenandoah Shakespeare Express) staged it in 1999 and revived it in 2003 at the Blackfriars Playhouse in Staunton, Virginia, a recreation of Shakespeare&#x27;s Blackfriars Theatre. In 1974 the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, CT, presented a shortened adaptation by Brooks Jones that turned it into a musical comedy with new songs by Peter Schickele. The American Shakespeare Center&#x27;s &quot;Rough, Rude, and Boisterous tour&quot; of 2009 to 2010 also included the play. The Theater at Monmouth staged the play in the summer of 2013. In June 2016, Theatre Pro Rata, a small professional theater in St. Paul, Minnesota, staged a 90-minute version of the play with eight actors, four in the play–within–the–play playing multiple roles. With a cast of 12, The Independent Shakespeare Company of Los Angeles staged a full performance in Griffith Park in July 2022. In 2023, the play is being presented at the Lucille Lortel Theatre by Red Bull Theater in association with Fiasco Theater in the first major New York revival in over 50 years.

===1938 TV film===
A 90-minute television film version was broadcast by BBC Television on 19 and 30 December 1938. The film had music by Frederic Austin and starred Frederick Ranalow as Merrythought, Hugh E. Wright as The Citizen, Margaret Yarde as Wife, Manning Whiley as Tim and Alex McCrindle as George Greengoose.

<text>Ratafia is a broad term used for two types of sweet alcoholic beverages, a flavouring essence whose taste resembles bitter almonds, later to a ratafia flavoured biscuit, a biscuit to be eaten along with ratafia, and later still, to a cherry variety.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; lists the word&#x27;s earliest date of use as 1699.

==Liqueur==
Ratafia liqueurs are alcoholic beverages compound liqueurs or cordials made by the maceration of ingredients such as aromatics, fruits, in pre-distilled spirits, followed by filtration and sweetening, the flavouring ingredients being merely infused in it. Ratafia may be flavoured with kernels (almond, peach, apricot, or cherry), lemon peel and spices in various amounts (nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, mint, rosemary, anise, etc.), typically combined with sugar. Other flavourings can be used, such as vegetables and fresh herbs. 

The liqueur is typical of the Mediterranean areas of Spain, Italy, and north-east of France (Champagne and Burgundy). In the south-central region of Italy, (specifically Molise and Abruzzo) ratafià is made exclusively with fresh cherries and Montepulciano d&#x27;Abruzzo wines.

Lazzaroni Amaretto, Luxardo Albicocca, Kahlua, Heering Original Cherry Liqueur, Alpenz Saint Elizabeth Allspice Dram, Carlshamms Flaggpunsch, Seale John D. Taylor&#x27;s Velvet Falernum are ratafia liqueurs.

The liqueur form of ratafia is mentioned humorously in the lyrics of the song &quot;The Unfortunate Miss Bailey&quot;, written by Lou Gottlieb and released by the Kingston Trio in 1959 on their album &quot;Here We Go Again!&quot;.

==Fortified wine==
The second type, &quot;ratafia de Champagne&quot;, a fortified wine, is a type of &quot;mistelle&quot;, a mixture of marc (grappa) and the unfermented juice of the grape, and is the type produced in France.
D.H. Lescombes, in New Mexico, uses Moscato grapes fortified with brandy to stop the fermentation early, which keeps the residual sugar high.

==Biscuit==
a small macaroon flavoured with almonds&lt;br&gt;− &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot;
Ratafia biscuits are made with ratafia essence, sweet almonds, apricot kernels, rosewater, egg white, sugar. Originally made with sweet and bitter almonds, now apricot kernels. Amaretto is a ratafia liquor, thus the ratafia biscuits.

In 1727, &quot;The Compleat Housewife&quot; by Eliza Smith included a recipe for &quot;To make Ratafia Bisket&quot;, with the ingredients: bitter almonds, sugar and egg white, making it a confection that is very similar to a modern macaroon.

In 1789, &quot;The Complete Confectioner&quot;, by Frederick Nutt, a confectioner, formerly apprenticed with Domenico Negri, an Italian who opened The Pot and Pineapple confectionery shop at 7-8 Berkeley Square, London, founded 1757, included a recipe, &quot;No. 29. Ratafia Biscuits&quot;:
Take half a pound of sweet almonds, and half a pound of bitter almonds, and pound them in a mortar very fine, with whites of eggs; put three pounds of powdered sugar, mix it well with the whites of eggs, to the proper thickness into a bason; put two or three sheets of paper on the plate you bake on; take your knife, and the spaddle made of wood, and drop them on the paper, let them be round, and about the size of a large nutmeg; put them in the oven, which must be quick, let them have a fine brown, and all alike, but be careful they are not burnt at bottom, else they will not come off the paper when baked; let them be cold before you take them off.
==Other uses==
Ratafia essence was suggested in a BBC recipe in their 1940 publication &quot;Food Facts For The Kitchen Front&quot;, for making mock marzipan, along with soya flour, margarine and sugar.

<text>Erick Arnoldo Scott Bernard (born 21 May 1981) is a Costa Rican professional footballer who currently plays for Limón.

==Club career==
Scott joined the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer on loan in March 2004, after several exceptional years with Alajuelense, with whom he had played since May 2001. Scott scored 13 goals in the 2001-02 season, and another 20 in the 2002-03 season, propelling Alajuelense to two straight league titles. Scott also scored several goals against MLS and Mexican league teams in the CONCACAF Champions Cup, and was a key player during his first episode with Alajuelense.

After joining the Crew, however, Scott saw minimal playing time, and did not return for the 2005 season. He was picked up by Real Salt Lake with the last pick of the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft, but was not brought into the squad. Instead, he stayed in Costa Rica and returned to Alajuelense.

Scott found himself playing with a different squad and a different manager at Alajuelense, and his performances were not up to the level they were when he left the squad less than a year earlier. Accordingly, he wasn&#x27;t involved in many matches during what was left of the 2005 Clausura tournament. Observers expected him to begin the following Apertura tournament in the starting line-up but due some differences with fans and some members of the managerial team, he was sent on loan for 6 months to Marathón in Honduras.

He returned to fitness and started playing well for Marathón, scoring important goals as the club won the 2007 championship. This resulted in attention from clubs in the Chinese Super League, and ultimately in a move to Shanghai Shenhua in January 2008 along with Honduran player Emil Martinez. They were teammates at Alajuelense and at Marathón and were acquired together by the Chinese team. He returned to Marathón ahead of the 2009 Clausura.

In summer 2010, Scott moved to Salvadoran side Luis Ángel Firpo after Alajuelense did not want to renew his contract. In summer 2011, Scott joined Saprissa from San Carlos only to leave them in January 2012 for Santos de Guápiles.

In June 2013, Scott joined Cartaginés, only for the club to release him a year later.

==International career==
Scott has made 28 appearances for the senior Costa Rica national team, scoring 7 goals in the process. At the youth level, he appeared in the 2001 World Youth Championship held in Argentina as well as the 2004 Summer Olympics. Scott made his debut for the senior team in a friendly match against Ecuador on October 16, 2002. He has appeared in the UNCAF Nations Cup 2003 and UNCAF Nations Cup 2005, as well as the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup held in the United States. Additionally, he appeared in five qualifying matches for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Scott was recently called into the Costa Rica national team for a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match, where he was an unused substitute.

<doc id="1037400" wikidata="Q1212765" url="?curid=1037400" title="Sanctuary (Faulkner novel)">
<text>Sanctuary is a 1931 novel by American author William Faulkner about the rape and abduction of an upper-class Mississippi college girl, Temple Drake, during the Prohibition era. The novel was Faulkner&#x27;s commercial and critical breakthrough and established his literary reputation, but was controversial given its themes. It is said Faulkner claimed it was a &quot;potboiler&quot;, written purely for profit, but this has been debated by scholars and Faulkner&#x27;s own friends.

The novel provided the basis for the films &quot;The Story of Temple Drake&quot; (1933) and &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (1961). It also inspired the novel &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot; as well as the film of the same title and &quot;The Grissom Gang&quot;, which derived from &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot;. The story of the novel can also be found in the 2007 film &quot;Cargo 200&quot;.

Faulkner later wrote &quot;Requiem for a Nun&quot; (1951) as a sequel to &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The novel is set in Faulkner&#x27;s fictional Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi and takes place in May and June 1929.

In May 1929, Horace Benbow, a lawyer frustrated with his life and family, suddenly leaves his home in Kinston, Mississippi, and hitchhikes his way back to Jefferson, his hometown in Yoknapatawpha County. There, his widowed sister, Narcissa Sartoris, lives with her son and her late husband&#x27;s great-aunt, Miss Jenny. On the way to Jefferson, he stops for a drink of water near the &quot;Old Frenchman&quot; homestead, which is occupied by the bootlegger Lee Goodwin. Benbow encounters a sinister man called Popeye, an associate of Goodwin, who brings him to the decrepit mansion where he meets Goodwin and the strange people who live there with him. Later that night, Benbow catches a ride from Goodwin&#x27;s place into Jefferson. He argues with his sister and Miss Jenny about leaving his wife, and meets Gowan Stevens, a local bachelor who recently has been courting Narcissa. That night, Benbow moves back into his parents&#x27; house, which has been sitting vacant for years.

After meeting Benbow, Gowan leaves to go to a dance in Oxford that same night. Gowan has returned to Jefferson after graduating from the University of Virginia, where he &quot;learned to drink like a gentleman.&quot; He is from a wealthy family and prides himself on having adopted the worldview of the Virginia aristocracy. His date that night is Temple Drake, a student at the University of Mississippi (&quot;Ole Miss&quot;), who has a reputation of being a &quot;fast girl.&quot; Temple also comes from a wealthy Mississippi family and is the daughter of a powerful judge. While they are out, Gowan and Temple make plans to meet the next morning to travel with her classmates to Starkville for a baseball game. But, after taking Temple home after the dance, Gowan learns from some locals where he can find moonshine and spends the night drinking heavily. He passes out in his car at the train station where he is supposed to have a rendezvous with Temple the next morning.

Gowan wakes the next morning to discover that he&#x27;s missed Temple&#x27;s train. He speeds to the next town to intercept it, meeting Temple in Taylor, and persuading her to ride with him to Starkville—a violation of the university&#x27;s rules for young women. On the way, Gowan, still drunk, and an obvious alcoholic, decides to stop at the Goodwin place to find more moonshine. He crashes his car into a tree that Popeye had felled across the drive in case of a police raid. Popeye and Tommy, a good-natured &quot;halfwit&quot; who works for Goodwin, happen to be nearby when the accident happens, and take Temple and Gowan back to the old mansion. Temple is terrified, both by Gowan&#x27;s behavior and by the strange people and circumstances into which he has brought her. Upon arriving at the Goodwin place, she meets Goodwin&#x27;s common-law wife, Ruby, who advises her to leave before nightfall. Gowan is given more liquor to drink.

After nightfall, Goodwin returns home and is upset to find Gowan and Temple staying there. All the men continue to drink; Gowan and Van, a member of Goodwin&#x27;s bootlegging crew, argue and provoke each other. Van makes crude advances toward Temple, rousing in the drunken Gowan a sense that he needs to protect Temple&#x27;s honor. By this point, Temple is deeply distressed. She is apprehensive of the bootleggers, truant from school, and afraid of being discovered for fear of her family&#x27;s disapproval. She is condescending, which angers Popeye, and tries to hold court in the room where the men are drinking despite Ruby&#x27;s advice that she stay away from them. After being harassed, Temple finds a bedroom in which to hide. Gowan and Van finally fight, and Gowan is knocked out. The other men carry him into the room where Temple is cowering and throw him on the bed. Ruby and Tommy keep the men, including Popeye, from bothering Temple. Finally, the men leave on a whiskey run in the middle of the night.

The next morning, Gowan wakes and silently leaves the house, abandoning Temple. Tommy, who dislikes and fears Goodwin&#x27;s other men, hides Temple in a corn crib in the barn. But Popeye, who has obviously been devising a scheme, soon discovers them there. He murders Tommy with a gunshot to the back of the head and then proceeds to rape Temple with a corncob. Afterward, he puts her in his car and drives to Memphis, Tennessee, where he has connections in the criminal underworld.

Meanwhile, Goodwin discovers Tommy&#x27;s body at his barn. When the police arrive on the scene, they assume Goodwin committed the crime and arrest him. Goodwin knows of Popeye&#x27;s guilt, but doesn&#x27;t implicate him out of fear of retaliation. In Jefferson, Goodwin is jailed, and Benbow takes up his legal defense, even though he knows that Goodwin cannot pay him. Benbow tries to let Ruby and her sickly infant child stay with him in the house in Jefferson, but Narcissa, as half-owner, refuses because of the Goodwin family&#x27;s reputation. In the end, Benbow has no choice but to put Ruby and her son in a room at a local hotel.

Benbow tries unsuccessfully to get Goodwin to tell the court about Popeye. He soon finds out about Temple and her presence at Goodwin&#x27;s place when Tommy was murdered; he heads to Ole Miss to look for her. He discovers that she has left the school. On the train back to Jefferson, he runs into an unctuous state senator named Clarence Snopes, who says that the newspaper is claiming that Temple has been &quot;sent up north&quot; by her father. In reality, Temple is living in a room in a Memphis bawdy house owned by Miss Reba, an asthmatic, widowed madam, who thinks highly of Popeye and is happy that he&#x27;s finally chosen a paramour. Popeye keeps Temple at the brothel for use as a sex slave. However, because he is impotent, he brings along Red, a young gangster, and forces Temple and him to have sex while he watches.

When Benbow returns from Oxford, he learns that the owner of the hotel has kicked out Ruby and her child. After Narcissa again refuses to give them shelter, Benbow finds a place outside of town for Ruby to stay. Meanwhile, Snopes visits Miss Reba&#x27;s brothel and discovers that Temple is living there. Snopes realizes that this information might be valuable to both Benbow and Temple&#x27;s father. After Benbow agrees to pay Snopes for the information, Snopes divulges Temple&#x27;s whereabouts in Memphis. Benbow immediately heads there and convinces Miss Reba to let him talk to Temple. Miss Reba is sympathetic to the plight of Goodwin and his family, but she still admires and respects Popeye. Temple tells Benbow the story of her rape at Popeye&#x27;s hands. Benbow, shaken, returns to Jefferson. Upon his return home, he reflects on Temple and is reminded his stepdaughter, of Little Belle. He looks at a picture of Little Belle and becomes ill, disturbed by images of her naked, conflated with images from what he has heard from Temple about her night at the old mansion.

At this point, Temple has become corrupted thoroughly by life in the brothel. After bribing Miss Reba&#x27;s servant to let her leave the house, she runs into Popeye, who is waiting outside in his car. He takes Temple to a roadhouse called The Grotto, intending to settle whether she will permanently stay with Popeye or Red. At the club, Temple drinks heavily and tries to have furtive sex with Red in a back room, but he spurns her advances for the moment. Two of Popeye&#x27;s friends frog-march her out of the club and drive her back to Miss Reba. Popeye kills Red, which turns Miss Reba against him. She tells some of her friends what has happened, hoping he will be captured and executed for the murder.

Narcissa visits the District Attorney and reveals she wants Benbow to lose the case as soon as possible, so that he will cease his involvement with the Goodwins. After writing to his wife to ask for a divorce, Benbow tries to get back in touch with Temple through Miss Reba, who tells him that both she and Popeye are gone. At around this time, Goodwin&#x27;s trial begins in Jefferson. On the second day of the trial, Temple makes a surprise appearance and takes the stand, giving false testimony that it was Goodwin, not Popeye, who had raped and brutalized her, and that Goodwin had shot Tommy dead. The district attorney also presents the stained corncob used in Temple&#x27;s rape as evidence.

The jury finds Goodwin guilty after only eight minutes of deliberation. Benbow, devastated, is taken back to Narcissa&#x27;s house. After wandering from the house that evening, he finds that Goodwin has been lynched by the townsfolk with his body set ablaze. Benbow is recognized in the crowd, which threatens to lynch him, too. The next day, a defeated Benbow returns home to his wife. Ironically, on his way to Pensacola, Florida to visit his mother, Popeye is arrested and hanged for a crime he never committed. Temple and her father make a final appearance in the Jardin du Luxembourg, having found sanctuary in Paris.

==Characters==

===Major characters===
* Popeye – Criminal with an unsavory past, involved in the Goodwin bootlegging operation. Also has unspecified ties to the Memphis criminal underworld. His mother had syphilis when he was conceived. He is impotent and has various other physical afflictions. He rapes Temple with a corncob and then takes her to Memphis and keeps her in a room at Miss Reba&#x27;s brothel.
* Horace Benbow – Lawyer who represents Mr. Goodwin in the trial for Tommy&#x27;s murder. He is well-meaning and intelligent, but proves ineffective and powerless in the face of a troubled marriage and Temple&#x27;s false testimony.
** He does not appear in the 1961 film adaptation.
* Tommy – &quot;Halfwit&quot; member of the Goodwin bootlegging crew. He is murdered by Popeye while he is trying to protect Temple.
** He does not appear in the 1961 film adaptation.
* Lee Goodwin – Bootlegger who is accused of Tommy&#x27;s murder, for which he is tried, wrongly convicted, and lynched.
** He does not appear in the 1961 film adaptation.
* Ruby Lamar – Goodwin&#x27;s common-law wife and mother of his child. She is shunned and reviled by most of the cityfolk for &quot;living in sin&quot; with Goodwin.
** In the portions of the 1961 &quot;Sanctuary&quot; adapted from the first novel, Nancy Mannigoe (played by Odetta), who in the novels appears only in the &quot;Requiem for a Nun&quot;, takes the role originally used by Ruby.

She is raped and kidnapped by Popeye. At the trial, she lies and says Lee Goodwin killed Tommy.
** Degenfelder wrote that the author mainly gave a &quot;flat&quot; characterization to Temple in the novel. The reviewer added that &quot;Faulkner sees woman as the instrument who instigates and perpetuates this pattern of evil&quot; and that the use of Temple was &quot;attacking the chivalric code of the South&quot;.
* Gowan Stevens – Vain, self-important, alcoholic man who takes Temple to the Goodwin house, where he hopes to buy some whisky. He gets drunk, gets beaten up by Van, and passes out. He leaves the house by himself the next morning, abandoning Temple, who then falls into Popeye&#x27;s hands.
* Miss Reba – Owns a Memphis brothel where Temple lives under Popeye&#x27;s control; she thinks highly of Popeye until he brings Red in as a &quot;stud&quot;, which shocks and scandalizes her.

==Development==
Faulkner stated that he wrote the novel for financial gain and was not motivated by internal passion. He did the first draft in a three-week period in 1929 and later made a new version with toned-down elements when the publisher expressed reluctance to publish the original.

According to Muhlenfeld, initially Temple was not the primary character, but this was changed in a revision. E. Pauline Degenfelder of Worcester Public Schools argued that Temple, Popeye, and Horace were all main characters even though the work presented itself as mainly being about Temple.

==Reception==
Most reviews described the book as horrific and said that Faulkner was a very talented writer. Some critics also felt that he should write something pleasant for a change.

In June 1932, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; was banned from importation to Canada by the Canadian Department of National Revenue.

Faulkner once headed a troop of Boy Scouts but the administrators removed him from his position after the release of the book.

Gene D. Phillips of Loyola University of Chicago wrote that because audiences were preoccupied with lurid scenes instead of its moral philosophy, the book was a &quot;best seller for all of the wrong reasons&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; commented that &quot;A favorite question on Shakespeare examinations is &#x27;Distinguish between horror and terror.&#x27; &quot;Sanctuary&quot; is both. The horrors of any ghost story pale beside the ghastly realism of this chronicle. [...] When you have read the book you will see what Author Faulkner thinks of the inviolability of sanctuary. The intended hero is the decent, ineffectual lawyer. But all heroism is swamped by the massed villainy that weighs down these pages. Outspoken to an almost medical degree, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; should be let alone by the censors because no one but a pathological reader will be sadistically aroused.&quot;

==Editions==
On February 9, 1931, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; was published by Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith. In 1932, a cheaper hardcover edition was published by Modern Library. This second edition is notable in that it contains an introduction by Faulkner explaining his intentions in writing the book and a brief history of its inception. In it, Faulkner explains that he wished to make money by writing a sensational book. His previous books were not quite as successful as he had hoped. However, after submitting the manuscript in 1929, his publisher explained that they would both be sent to prison if the story was ever published. Faulkner forgot about the manuscript. Two years later, Faulkner, surprised, received the galley copies and promptly decided to rewrite the manuscript as he was not satisfied with it. He thought that it might sell 10,000 copies. This version was published in 1931. All later editions featured the text from the 1931/32 editions; however, a plethora of typographical errors existed, some of which were corrected in the later editions.

In 1958, a new edition was published by Random House with the co-operation of Faulkner, the entire text was reset and errors corrected. The copyright year is listed as &quot;1931, 1958&quot; in this edition. In 1981, Random House published another edition titled &quot;Sanctuary: The Original Text&quot;, edited by Noel Polk. This edition features the text of Faulkner&#x27;s original manuscript as submitted in 1929, with errors corrected.

In 1993, another version was published by Vintage Books titled &quot;Sanctuary: The Corrected Text&quot; which corrects additional errors. This is the only edition currently in print, though reprints of it bear the original novel&#x27;s title, simply &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.

==Analysis==
Various observers had their own interpretations on the themes of the novel. André Malraux characterized it as, in the words of E. Pauline Degenfelder of Worcester Public Schools, &quot;a detective story with overtones of Greek tragedy&quot;. Cleanth Brooks believed that the work was a &quot;mood piece&quot; on, in Degenfelder&#x27;s words, &quot;the discovery of evil&quot;.

Doreen Fowler, author of &quot;Reading for the &quot;Other Side&quot;: &quot;Beloved&quot; and &quot;Requiem for a Nun&quot;,&quot; wrote that &quot;it could be argued that the title&quot; refers to the main character&#x27;s sexual organs, which are attacked by Popeye.

==Adaptations==
In 1933, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; was adapted into the Pre-Code film &quot;The Story of Temple Drake&quot; starring Miriam Hopkins, with the rapist character &quot;Popeye&quot; renamed &quot;Trigger&quot; for copyright reasons. According to film historian William K. Everson, the film was largely responsible for the Motion Picture Production Code crackdown on risque and controversial subject matter.

The novel was later a co-source, with its sequel &quot;Requiem for a Nun&quot; (1951), for the 1961 film &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, starring Lee Remick as Temple and Yves Montand as her rapist, now renamed &quot;Candy Man&quot;.

Faulkner stated that initially he wished to end the plot at the end of &quot;Sanctuary&quot; but he decided that, in Degenfelder&#x27;s words, &quot;Temple&#x27;s reinterpretation would be dramatic and worthwhile.&quot; Degenfelder believes that he may have gotten inspiration for the sequel from &quot;The Story of Temple Drake&quot; due to common elements between the two.

Phillips wrote that due to the difficulties of adapting the novel into a film with the same spirit that would attract major audiences, &quot;no film so far has retold Faulkner&#x27;s story of Temple Drake with quite the impact of the original. And at this point it seems safe to predict that none ever will.&quot;

==Legacy==
Phillips wrote that the novel &quot;earned him the reputation of being a sordid Gothic writer that he still holds in the popular mind.&quot;

Phillips wrote that &quot;It is a matter of record that James Hadley Chase&#x27;s lurid novel &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot; was heavily indebted to &quot;Sanctuary&quot; for its plot line.&quot; According to Phillips, that means both film adaptations, &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot; and &quot;The Grissom Gang&quot;, received inspiration from &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.

A Russian film with a similar plot – &quot;Cargo 200&quot;, set in 1984 Russia – was made in 2007.

<text>The 1913 rail (MIL-STD-1913 rail) is an American rail integration system designed by Richard Swan that provides a mounting platform for firearm accessories. It forms part of the NATO standard STANAG 2324 rail. It was originally used for mounting of telescopic sights atop the receivers of larger caliber rifles. 

Once established as United States Military Standard, its use expanded to also attaching other accessories, such as: iron sights, tactical lights, laser sights, night-vision devices, reflex sights, holographic sights, foregrips, bipods, slings and bayonets.

An updated version of the rail is adopted as a NATO standard as the STANAG 4694 NATO Accessory Rail.
== History ==

Attempts to standardize the Weaver rail mount designs date from work by the A.R.M.S. company and Richard Swanson in the early 1980s. Specifications for the M16A2E4 rifle and the M4E1 carbine received type classification generic in December 1994. These were the M16A2 and the M4 modified with new upper receivers where rails replaced hand guards. 

The MIL-STD-1913 rail is commonly called the &quot;Picatinny Rail&quot;, in reference to the Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey. Picatinny Arsenal works as a contracting office for small arms design (they contracted engineers to work on the M4). 

Picatinny Arsenal requested Swan&#x27;s help in developing the rail, but did not draft blueprints or request paperwork for a patent. That credit goes to Richard Swanson of A.R.M.S., who conducted research and development &quot;and&quot; acquired a patent for the rail in 1995. Swan has litigated in civil court against Colt and Troy industries regarding patent infringement. The courts found that Troy had developed rifles with rail mounting systems nearly identical to the MIL-STD-1913 rail. 

A metric-upgraded version of the 1913 rail, the STANAG 4694 NATO Accessory Rail, was designed in conjunction with weapon manufacturers like Aimpoint, Beretta, Colt, FN Herstal and Heckler &amp; Koch, and was approved by the NATO Army Armaments Group (NAAG), Land Capability Group 1 Dismounted Soldier (LCG1-DS) on May 8, 2009.

Many firearm manufacturers include a MIL-STD-1913 rail system from the factory, such as the Ruger Mini-14 Ranch Rifle.

== Design ==
The rail consists of a strip undercut to form a &quot;flattened T&quot; with a hexagonal top cross-section, with cross slots interspersed with flats that allow accessories to be slid into place from the end of the rail and then locked in place. It is similar in concept to the earlier commercial Weaver rail mount used to mount telescopic sights, but is taller and has wider slots at regular intervals along the entire length.

The MIL-STD-1913 locking slot width is . The spacing of slot centres is and the slot depth is .

== Comparison to Weaver rail ==

The only significant difference between the MIL-STD-1913 rail and the similar Weaver rail mount are the size and shapes of the slots. Whereas the earlier Weaver rail is modified from a low, wide dovetail rail and has rounded slots, the 1913 rail has a more pronounced angular section and square-bottomed slots. This means that an accessory designed for a Weaver rail will fit onto a MIL-STD-1913 rail whereas the opposite might not be possible, unless the slots in the Weaver rail are modified to have square bottoms.

While some accessories are designed to fit on both Weaver and 1913 rails, most 1913 compatible devices will not fit on Weaver rails. From May 2012, most mounting rails are cut to MIL-STD-1913 standards. Many accessories can be secured to a rail with a single spring-loaded retaining pin.

Designed to mount heavy sights of various kinds, a great variety of accessories and attachments are now available and the rails are no longer confined to the rear upper surface (receiver) of long arms but are either fitted to or machine milled into the upper, side or lower surfaces of all manner of weapons from crossbows to pistols and long arms up to and including anti-materiel rifles.

== Impact ==
Because of their many uses, 1913 rails and accessories have replaced iron sights in the design of many firearms and are available as aftermarket add-on parts for most actions that do not have them integrated, and they are also on the undersides of semi-automatic pistol frames and grips.

Their usefulness has led to them being used in paintball, gel blasters and airsoft.

<text>Old Nanny Town was a village in the Blue Mountains of Portland Parish, northeastern Jamaica, used as a stronghold of Jamaican Maroons (escapee slaves). During the early 18th century, the region was led by an Ashanti escapee slave known as Queen Nanny, or Granny Nanny, who gave the town its namesake. The town was steadfast, and held-out against repeated attacks from the colonial militia before being abandoned in 1734.

==Origins==
One story is that Nanny of the Maroons (also known as Queen Nanny and Granny Nanny) was born in what is now Ghana, West Africa, as a member of the Ashanti nation, part of the Akan people. Allegedly, she was enslaved, along with her five &quot;brothers-in-arms&quot;, and brought to eastern Jamaica. She and her five &quot;brothers&quot;, Cudjoe, Accompong, Johnny, Cuffy and Quao, quickly decided to flee the oppressive conditions of the sugar cane plantations to join the autonomous African communities of Maroons which had developed in the mountains.

These communities of Free black people in Jamaica originated from people formerly enslaved by the Spanish, who had refused to submit to British control. The Maroons of Nanny Town claim descent from escaped African slaves and Taino men and women.

The Maroon communities grew as many more slaves escaped the plantations and joined them. Angered by continued raiding of plantations and armed confrontations, the colonial government mounted the First Maroon War of the 1730s in an effort to defeat and capture the runaway slaves.

One story is that Nanny and her &quot;brothers&quot; split up in order to continue the resistance to the plantation slave economy across Jamaica. Cudjoe went to Clarendon, where he was soon joined by about a hundred Maroons from Cottawood; while Accompong went to St. Elizabeth, where a Maroon community was later named for him. Nanny and Quao made their way to Portland and the Blue Mountains.

A more likely origin for the Leeward Maroons occurred in 1690, when there was a Coromantee rebellion on Sutton&#x27;s estate in western Jamaica, and most of these slaves ran away to form the Leeward Maroons. Cudjoe is probably the son of one of the leaders of this revolt. While Cudjoe emerged as the leader of the Leeward Maroons of the west, Nanny came to prominence as one of the main leaders of the Windward Maroons of the east.

==First Maroon War==
By 1720, Nanny and Quao had organized and were leading the settlement of Windward Maroons; it was known as Nanny Town. Nanny Town was organized similarly to a typical Ashanti tribe in Africa. After the First Maroon War, a deed from the colonial government granted Nanny more than 500 acres (2.4 km2) of land where the Maroons could live and raise animals and grow crops.

In addition to what they raised and produced, the Maroons sent traders to the coastal towns to exchange food for weapons and cloth. During the First Maroon War, the Maroons of Nanny Town raided plantations for weapons and food, burnt plantations, and led liberated slaves to join them at Nanny Town.

Nanny Town was an excellent location for a stronghold, as it overlooked Stony River via a 900-foot ridge, making a surprise attack by the British very difficult. The Maroons organized look-outs for such attacks, and warriors could be summoned by the sound of a horn called an &quot;abeng&quot;.

Granny Nanny allegedly freed more than 800 slaves over the span of 50 years. She also had a vast knowledge of herbs due to her role as a spiritual leader. However, during the First Maroon War, and especially between 1728 and 1734, the British attacked Nanny Town time and time again, but each time the colonial militias captured and occupied Nanny Town, the Windward Maroons regained it shortly afterwards. This was accomplished due to the skill of the Maroons skilled in fighting in an area of high rainfall as well as disguising themselves as bushes and trees. The Maroons also used decoys to trick the British into a surprise attack. This was done by having non-camouflaged Maroons run out into view of the British and then run in the direction of the fellow Maroons who were disguised, leading the British into ambushes time and time again.

After another Windward Maroon leader, Quao, signed the treaty of 1740 with the British, the Windward Maroons split up. Quao&#x27;s supporters moved to what later became known as Crawford&#x27;s Town, while the Maroons of Nanny Town relocated to Moore Town.

<doc id="1037406" wikidata="Q7921958" url="?curid=1037406" title="Verne Citadel">
<text>Verne Citadel is a 19th-century citadel on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. Located on the highest point of Portland, Verne Hill, it sits in a commanding position overlooking Portland Harbour, which it was built to defend. In 1949, it became HM Prison The Verne.

==History==
The citadel was built between 1857 and 1881, as Portland Harbour&#x27;s main fortification. Naturally inaccessible from the north and east, the south and west sides were protected by the digging of a large ditch. Both East Weare Battery and East Weare Camp, located below the eastern side of the Verne, were considered part of the citadel&#x27;s outworks.
The citadel was designed with open gun emplacements on the north, east and west sides. As its defensive role came to an end, by 1903 the citadel had become an infantry barracks. During World War I and II, the Verne became the Headquarters of Coast Artillery. During World War II, a Chain Home Low Radar set was installed within the citadel, and the main magazine became a hospital. After the war, the last military use of the fort was by the Royal Engineers.

The citadel was turned into a prison in 1949, becoming a Category C prison for 575 adult males, serving medium-to-long term sentences. In 2013, the prison closed and became an immigration removal centre for 600 detainees awaiting deportation in 2014. The centre was transformed back into a prison in 2017–18.

==Grade listed features==

The citadel, including the Verne High Angle Battery, is a scheduled monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. In recent years, the Citadel has been listed on English Heritage&#x27;s Risk Register.

Both the North and South Entrances, as well as the south west and south east casemates, are Grade II* Listed. The railings at the approach to the north entrance form part of the original construction and are Grade II Listed. The prison&#x27;s reception centre is also Grade II Listed. In September 1978, five other features of the citadel became Grade II Listed: the prison&#x27;s blacksmith&#x27;s shop, the prison chapel, the officer&#x27;s block B, the prison gymnasium, and the detached Governor&#x27;s house.

The East Weare Battery, and the detention barracks of East Weare Camp (built circa 1880), both became Grade II Listed in May 1993. The Verne High Angle Battery was built in 1892, approximately 150 metres south of the citadel&#x27;s southern entrance, as part of Britain&#x27;s Coastal Defences. Decommissioned in 1906, it became Grade II Listed in May 1993 too.

<text>Indian National League (INL) is an Indian political party formed in 1994 under the leadership of the then IUML leader Ebrahim Sulaiman Sait. The party is currently a member of the CPIM-led LDF in Kerala. INL leader Ahamed Devarkovil, MLA from Kozhikode South Constituency, serves as a minister in the Second Pinarayi Vijayan ministry.

PMA Salam was the first INL candidate to get elected to the Kerala Assembly (2006). INL was formally inducted into the LDF in the late 2010s.

== History ==

* Indian National League was formed as a reaction to the continued alliance of IUML with INC post Babri Masjid Demolition.
* Opposition raised by several CPIM leaders, who saw the National League as a communal party, ensured that the National League had to stay outside the LDF for over two decades (1994 - 2018).
* The Indian National League mostly allied with the CPIM unofficially in certain seats in the various Kerala Assembly elections between 1994 and 2018.
* Indian National League was associated with the UDF briefly in 2010-11.
* A group under leadership of Abdul Wahab left INL and formed his own party &quot;National League&quot;

== Controversies ==

* It was alleged that INL had &#x27;sold&#x27; the post of the member of KPSC for Rs 40 lakh.

<text>Shirebrook is a town and civil parish in the Bolsover District of Derbyshire, England. It had a population of 13,300 at the 2021 Census. The town is on the B6407 road and close to the A632 road which runs between the towns of Mansfield, Worksop and Bolsover. The town is close to the Bassetlaw and Mansfield Districts of Nottinghamshire.

==Economy==
===History===
According to David Mills in &quot;A Dictionary of British Place-Names&quot;, the area was first named in records in 1202 written in Old English as Scirebroc. This can be interpreted as Boundary or Bright Brook.

Prior to the intense and swift development of the Colliery at the turn of the 20th century, Shirebrook, even as late as 1872 it was little more than a chapelry of the larger Pleasley. Wilsons&#x27; Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales of 1870–72 describes &quot;SHIREBROOK, a chapelry in Pleaseley parish, Derby; 3¾ miles NNW of Mansfield r. station. It was constituted in 1849, and it has a post-office under Mansfield. Pop., 342. Houses, 70. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Lichfield. Value, £90.* Patron, the Rector of Pleaseley. The church was built in 1843.&quot;

Shirebrook Colliery was sunk in 1896–1897 by the Shirebrook Coal and Iron company on land owned by the Duke of Devonshire, Joseph Paget (a Pleasley Mills partner and the builder of Stuffynwood Hall), and the Nicholson and Fowler farming families. Professor Arnold Lupton of Sheffield was the mining engineer. The sinking of two shafts, plus a pumping shaft, was based on independent surveys by Henry Hall and Matthew Fisher, managers of working collieries. The shafts, wide, met the &#x27;Top Hard&#x27; seam at .

By 1897, a &#x27;model village&#x27; was already being built close to the colliery to house workers. &quot;The Derbyshire Times&quot; of 30 July 1897 reported that &quot;About half a mile away a model village is springing up, some 150 houses have already been erected and about 420 are to be built.&quot;
Shirebrook Colliery operated in the town until April 1993. It had previously been linked underground to nearby Pleasley Colliery. The workforce was about evenly split during the strike of 1984–85, leading to deep community divisions between strikers and workers, and briefly earned the nickname &quot;the Belfast of England&quot;.

In addition to two ongoing fabrication-engineering businesses at nearby Langwith, Shirebrook has a large furniture retailer.

===Regeneration===

The 93-acre former Shirebrook Colliery site was reclaimed for development at a cost of £24million, funded by English Partnerships and administered by East Midlands Development Agency.

The former Great Northern pub in Main Street was converted in 2016 to an alcohol-free homeless shelter for a maximum of 15 men as an outpost-mission by Lighthouse Homes, a church project originally based in Rotherham.

===Sports Direct hub===
Re-titled as Brook Park, half of the entire business park designated as Zone 1 was allocated to Sports Direct after a planning application to Bolsover District Council in 2004 for four giant warehouses totalling 111,000 square metres, with a training facility, helipad and a retail store. 


===Community building===
In December 2017, the government through their Minister for Faith and Communities, Lord Bourne, announced a £1.26 million aid-package from the &quot;Controlling Migration Fund&quot;, after a bid from local networking groups Bolsover Partnership and Shirebrook Forward NG20 due to the large influx of Eastern European workers.

The money is a two-year investment intended to improve access to public services, stage community events, improve the shopping and Market Square area and ease pressures on housing, schooling and health services resulting from recent migration.

The project named &quot;Building Resilience&quot; will see investment into seven core areas:

*Community resilience
*Market Square Enlivenment
*Migrant community access
*Improve access and quality of private sector housing
*Social Norms and UK Laws
*Additional GP resources
*Healthy Workforce Programme

Shirebrook Town Hall was constructed as a new build on the site of a former storage unit on the market square. It opened in 2019 as a &#x27;one stop shop&#x27; with customer contact centre and payment counter at ground floor level, and offices for Town Council and Bolsover District business above. The council&#x27;s claim is &quot;...we believe it to be one of the largest, if not the largest town centre square in England&quot;.

===Housing===
As part of the government&#x27;s Levelling Up initiative, a plan to create affordable homes on part of the former colliery site has seen the &quot;First Homes &quot; pilot scheme established to allow local first-time buyers and key workers to buy new builds at a 30% discount of the market price.

==Education==
Shirebrook Academy on Common Lane is the local secondary school for pupils aged 11–16.

Shirebrook also has many primary schools and nurseries such as:
* Park Infant &amp; Nursery Schools
* Park Junior School
* Stubbin Wood Special School
* Brookfield Primary School

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and BBC East Midlands on BBC One and by ITV Yorkshire and ITV Central on ITV1. Television signals are received from either the Belmont or Waltham TV transmitters. 

The town is served by both BBC Radio Sheffield on 94.7 FM and BBC Radio Nottingham on 95.5 FM. Other radio stations including Capital East Midlands on 96.5 FM, Mansfield 103.2 FM, Greatest Hits Radio North Derbyshire on 107.4 FM and online community radio station Elastic FM.

The town is served by the local newspapers the &quot;Mansfield and Ashfield Chad&quot; and the &quot;Derbyshire Times&quot;.

==Railway==
Shirebrook once had three railway stations. The last remaining station was on the Midland Railway (later part of the LMS) route from Nottingham to Worksop via Mansfield, and was originally known as Shirebrook West, despite being on the eastern edge of the town. The route lost its passenger services in October 1964, leaving Shirebrook without a station, but the line remained open as a goods route. On the site of the goods yard a diesel locomotive fuelling depot was opened in the mid-1960s. The station was re-opened in 1998 as Shirebrook railway station for the new Robin Hood Line services from Nottingham to Worksop via Mansfield. A wagon repair and manufacturing business have a rail link with the main line.
Shirebrook North station (originally known as &quot;Langwith Junction&quot;, until renamed in June 1924), was opened by the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway (later part of the Great Central Railway and subsequently the London &amp; North Eastern Railway) in March 1897 and closed in September 1955. By then only one of the four routes converging on it was left- that to Lincoln: the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s &quot;Leen Valley Extension&quot; line to Pleasley and Sutton-in-Ashfield had closed in September 1931; the LD&amp;ECR line to Beighton via Clowne in September 1939, and that to Chesterfield via Bolsover in December 1951, due to the unsafe condition of Bolsover Tunnel. The filling in of the tunnel began on 10 October 1966, and used waste from Bolsover Colliery. The mouth of the old tunnel can be found on the southern edge of Scarcliffe, emerging just south of Ridgdale Road, Bolsover.

Shirebrook South station was on the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s &quot;Leen Valley Extension&quot; line mentioned above, opened in November 1901 and closed in September 1931.

==Sport==
The town&#x27;s football club Shirebrook Town play in the First Division of the Northern Counties East Football League, and are based at Langwith Road. Before the current club was formed, Shirebrook Miners Welfare F.C. was the senior team in the area, competing in the FA Cup on occasion.

<text>Aranda de Duero is a city and municipality, capital of the Ribera del Duero comarca, in the south of the province of Burgos, in Castile and León, Spain. It has a population of roughly 33,000 people and lies on the River Duero.

==Description==
The municipality of Aranda de Duero is made up of three towns: Aranda de Duero (seat or capital), La Aguilera and Sinovas.

Aranda de Duero is the capital of the Ribera del Duero wine region. The town is unique for having wine cellars that interconnect below the streets of the town centre. Wine clubs (&quot;peñas&quot;) celebrate special events in these cellars.

==Location==
Aranda de Duero is at the junction of several transport routes across Spain. The N1 &quot;autovía&quot; (known as A-1) runs north / south by Aranda, along which visitors and import/export goods travel between Madrid and the south coast. Another important road running east to west connects Portugal with important cities on the way (e.g. Zamora, Valladolid, Soria) and the east coast. Its location at the juncture of these routes has led to Aranda de Duero acquiring a growing recognition and function as a business centre. Several multinational corporations, such as Michelin and GlaxoSmithKline have large facilities in the area.

==Climate==
Aranda de Duero has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) with cold winters.

==History==
The Council of Aranda, an ecclesiastical synod, was held at Aranda de Duero in 1473 by Alfonso Carillo, Archbishop of Toledo, to overcome the ignorance and evil lives of ecclesiastics. Among the twenty-nine canons of the council is one which says that orders shall not be conferred on those who are ignorant of Latin. Several canons deal with clerical concubinage, simony, clandestine marriages, etc.

==Culture==
A dish called &quot;Lechazo&quot; is a local speciality. This is roast suckling lamb and is usually served with a basic salad and much &quot;torta&quot; bread for dipping in the meat juices.

===Festivals and events===
The Fiestas to honour la Virgen de las Viñas (Our Lady of the Vines) take place on the first Sunday after 8 September. They last for nine days from the eve of that Sunday (the Big Day) until the following Sunday when the Fiestas end with the traditional fireworks at midnight, followed by &quot;the sardine burial&quot;.

The annual Sonorama music festival is held in the city in mid-August.

== Gallery ==
=== Wine caves ===
==Places of interest==
santa María la Real is a church built by Simon de Colonia during the 15th and 16th centuries. Its most notable feature is the main doorway. Above the doorway, three carved stone reliefs show Christ carrying the Cross, The Crucifixion and The Resurrection. The doorway is topped by the coat of arms of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile. Aranda&#x27;s own coats of arms is also present along with scenes from the Nativity and other Christian celebrations. Due to their deterioration, the church doors have been replaced by exact copies, the original ones are kept in the Museo Sacro.

San Juan, a church, older than Santa Maria and gothic in style, San Juan still has its fortified defensive tower. The Council of Aranda took place in San Juan in 1473. Nowadays San Juan houses the Museo Sacro.

The Virgen de las Viñas Sanctuary is a 17th-century hermitage. It is situated on a small hill to the north of the town. The patron saint of the town is the Virgen de las Viñas, the local legend says that she was found in a vineyard, hence the name.

The Train museum is situated in the old train station &quot;Chelva&quot; and documents the history of Spanish railways.

The Pottery museum houses pottery from all over Spain, with the largest collection from Castile and León.

The Berdugo&#x27;s palace is a Renaissance mansion.

Bodegas; under the town centre there is a labyrinth of cellars, they were dug between the 12th and 17th centuries.

<doc id="1037424" wikidata="Q5346032" url="?curid=1037424" title="Edward Zander">
<text>Edward J. Zander is an American business executive. He was CEO and Chairman of the Board of Motorola from January 2004 until January 2008, remaining as chairman until May 2008. His work in the technology sector included management positions at Data General and Apollo Computer before joining Sun Microsystems in 1987, where he was later promoted to Chief Operating Officer and President.

After leaving Sun in 2002, he became managing director at Silver Lake Partners, a private-equity firm. He also serves on the board of directors for Jason Foundation for Education, on the science advisory board of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (where he received a degree in electrical engineering), the advisory board for IOCOM Communications, and the advisory board of the Boston University School of Management (where he received his Master of Business Administration and later an honorary D.H.L.). He was also a member of the board of directors at Seagate Technologies from 2002 to 2004, and at Time Warner Inc. from January to May 2007. He has been a member of the board of directors at EagleView Technologies Inc. since 2008.

==Personal==

Zander is the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland (father) and Greece (mother), who couldn&#x27;t afford college but stressed education to their children. His father reportedly dreamed of being a lawyer but instead settled for a job as a furrier in order to support his ill parents. Growing up, he was given the nickname &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; by his friends because, according to a Boston Globe article, he frequently demonstrated the &quot;hustle of a street kid spoiling for a good fight.&quot; Zander himself remarked, &quot;I&#x27;m from New York, so I&#x27;m New York fast&quot; (June 19, 2000). Zander attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and graduated in the class of 1968. Zander is married to Mona Zander, and the couple have two sons.

== Career at Sun Microsystems ==
Edward Zander&#x27;s career at Sun Microsystems began in 1987. Throughout the 1990s, he rose through the ranks, taking the role of vice president of corporate marketing, and then becoming president of Sun&#x27;s software division in 1991, moving to the same position for Sun&#x27;s systems division in 1995. In January 1998, he was promoted to COO for the entire company and was given the additional role of President of Sun in April 1999. Zander was responsible for Sun&#x27;s seven product divisions which included engineering, product development, sales, service, and marketing. The CTO and corporate brand marketing also reported to him.

After Zander left the company in 2002, CEO Scott McNealy reassumed the duties of President and COO until the promotion of Jonathan Schwartz to those roles on April 2, 2004.

== Career at Motorola ==
On January 5, 2004, Zander was selected by the Motorola board of directors to succeed Chris Galvin who retired in September 2003, ending a three generation reign of his family at the head of the electronics giant.

The primary candidates considered to replace him were Zander and Mike Zafirovski, though well-known executives such as AT&amp;T Corporation&#x27;s President Betsy Bernard, Qwest Communications International&#x27;s Richard Notebaert, and Verizon Communications&#x27;s Lawrence Babbio were also considered. Earlier, Zafirovski had proved himself an excellent executive at Motorola. He arrived from General Electric and led the cell phone business to profitability. Unfortunately for him, the board was looking for a more radical change in leadership. Even though Zafirovski was virtually an outsider himself (having served at the corporation for only three years), the board of directors went with someone with more experience in a complex organization like Motorola. Zander’s impressive career at Sun and his radical &quot;mover and shaker&quot; attitude won the board over and he was given the position. Zafirovski was disappointed and was expected to leave the company, especially with his history of reported run-ins with the board of directors but stayed until 31 January 2005, when he resigned.

Zander&#x27;s first task was to oversee the new spin-off that Motorola had begun just shortly before he joined, Freescale Semiconductor. He announced that he would focus the company on its consumer electronics business and start taking better care of its customers (he even assigned the Chief Information Officer, Samir Desai, to one of their largest and angriest customers, Nextel). During his time, he acquired 12 companies and wound down poor-performing businesses. He also ramped up the business units that sell radio equipment to the government, cable set-top box components, and wireless communications products.

Zander came into a tough corporate culture - Motorola&#x27;s departments have been referred to as &quot;warring tribes&quot;. He created a bonus structure that based 25% of all bonuses on customer satisfaction, meeting product deadlines, cooperation between departments, etc. He started looking to target major corporations for communications gear and services, instead of just aiming at customers of the phones and telecom companies with wireless gear. A reorganization of Motorola&#x27;s business divisions became likely. Zander wanted to see new types of products that focused on melding Internet technologies with wireless phone technologies. He established the philosophy of &quot;seamless mobility&quot; to integrate Motorola&#x27;s products and create a sense of unity within the company.

After Motorola posted a $181 million loss for the first quarter of 2007, Zander came under increased pressure, with Carl Icahn first demanding a share buyback, then a seat on the board of directors.

Zander has since been named a defendant in a securities fraud class action, on behalf of investors who purchased Motorola stock between July 19, 2006 and January 4, 2007, as a result of allegedly false and misleading public statements issued by Motorola during that time. Zander received $12.5 million in incentive-based pay, much of it dependent on Motorola&#x27;s financial results, as well as $1.5 million in salary during 2006.

Zander capitalized on the success of the Motorola RAZR too long and was slow adopting 3G. The company lost market share to Samsung and LG Electronics. By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process. Under Zander, Ron Garriques (who was responsible for the successful RAZR) departed for Dell Inc., while Stu Reed failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division. Only after Sanjay Jha took the reins of Motorola&#x27;s Mobile Devices Unit did it finally managed to right itself.

In January 2007, he rode a yellow bike onto the stage in Las Vegas for his keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show. Instead of developing new and exciting products, Motorola placed Razrs into colored lingerie (red in February for Valentine&#x27;s Day) while Apple Inc. unveiled the revolutionary new iPhone.

Zander stepped down as CEO on 1 January 2008, succeeded by Greg Brown, who was prior to then President and Chief Operating Officer. He was succeeded as chairman by former AT&amp;T CEO David Dorman in May 2008.

<text>Liga Deportiva Alajuelense (LDA, ), commonly known as Alajuelense and nicknamed La Liga (), is a Costa Rican multisport club based in the borough of El Llano, Alajuela, Alajuela province. Although they compete in a number of different sports, Alajuelense is mostly known for its association football team. It plays in the Primera División de Costa Rica, the top tier of the Costa Rican football league system. Alajuelense is one of two clubs to have never been relegated, along with Herediano.

Alajuelense was founded on the former Paris Hall, west of Alajuela&#x27;s Central Park, on June 18, 1919, by six former players of a historic city club, &quot;Once de Abril&quot;, with the intention of uniting all the sportsmen and associations present at that time in Alajuela under a single banner. However, it wouldn&#x27;t be until 1928 when Alajuelense managed to become national champions for the first time in a season that saw the club&#x27;s first star: Alejandro Morera. Morera, who would later go on to become Barcelona&#x27;s main striker for two seasons, is regarded as one of the finest players Costa Rica has ever produced. He would later manage Alajuelense to their second national title in 1939 as well as two others in 1941 and 1945. Since then, Alajuelense has become one of the most supported football clubs in Costa Rica.

Alajuelense is one of the most successful teams in Costa Rica and Central America, having won 30 national championships, 2 CONCACAF Champions Cup titles, 1 CONCACAF League, 2 CONCACAF Central American Cup, 3 UNCAF Interclub Cup and 1 Campeonato Centroamericano y Caribe. Alajuelense was the first Costa Rican club to win an official international competition when they defeated Suranamese club Transvaal in the final series in 1986. Alajuelense has also participated in the Copa Interamericana, Copa Merconorte, and Copa Sudamericana. In 1996, Alajuelense became the first club in the world to reach 100 points in any national league, finishing with a total of 102 points. This feat was repeated in 1998 and 2000 with 105 and 102 points gained, respectively.

Alajuelense plays its home matches at the Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto. Alajuelense&#x27;s home kit is composed of red and black vertical striped shirts, with black shorts, accompanied by red or black socks. This combination has been used since the club&#x27;s foundation. Kelme are the kit manufacturers. Alajuelense holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably against Saprissa, Herediano, and Cartaginés. It has contributed many key and famous players towards Costa Rica&#x27;s FIFA World Cup squads such as José Carlos Chaves, Óscar Ramírez, Mauricio Montero, Wilmer López, Luis Marín, Jhonny Acosta, and Patrick Pemberton.

==History==
The team was created in 1919 when a group of friends that used to play in a team called the &quot;Electra&quot; at first and then &quot;Once de Abril&quot; (April the 11th) met at &quot;Salon París&quot;. They wanted to give the city a team that could represent them at a national level. They played their first official game on August 2 of that same year against Cartaginés getting their first victory, 3–1.

Alajuelense was part of the 7 teams that built and formed the National League in Costa Rica, back in 1921, along with La Libertad, Gimnástica Española, Herediano, Cartaginés, CS Tres Rios de La Union, and Sociedad Gimnástica Limonense. They won their first championship in 1928. They are the only team to win the championship with a perfect record; in 1941 they won all 6 games. In 1960, the team made a tour around the world, leaving Costa Rica on September 17. In 78 days, the team played 24 games, winning 12, losing seven and drawing five. They scored 71 goals and allowed 47, with a remarkable performance from Juan Ulloa Ramírez, the best player and top scorer of this tour.

Throughout their history, Alajuelense has generated a lot of great players and stunning performances. They are known as one of the best teams in the Central America area. Their best decade was the 1990s, during which they won 4 Championships and 4 sub-championships (runner up) as well. In addition to that, by the end of the 90&#x27;s and the middle of the 2000s, they won a total of 5 local championships (4 of them in a row), 2 Copa Interclubes UNCAF Trophies and a CONCACAF Club Championship, being the base for the Costa Rican football team in the Korea and Japan 2002 FIFA World Cup, with 9 players.

By November 11, 2000, and after participating in the Copa Merconorte, Alajuelense was ranked 27th in IFFHS&#x27;s Club World Ranking. It is the best rank any Central American club has reached.

The club struggled with financial and administrative problems in the second part on the 2000s decade, so they decided to end contract with a lot of their regular and known players and started to build a team based on their younger divisions and make some structural changes. Nowadays the club is free of debts and with a team averaging 25-year-old players is still one of the best teams in the area and one of the teams with most fans in Costa Rica. On June 10, 2019, the club celebrated its 100th anniversary, being the second Costa Rican team to do so.

On 2023, Alajuelense participated on the 2023 CONCACAF Central American Cup, and they would advance to quarter-finals after being leaders on the Group D. They would face Cartaginés, that they would defeat 6–1 on aggregate, advancing to semifinals, where they would face Herediano, defeating them 5–4 on penalties after a 4–4 aggregate draw. In the final, they would face Real Estelí, but they would defeat them easily after a 4–1 victory on aggregate, being the first champions of the CONCACAF Central American Cup, and qualifying directly for the round of 16 of the 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup.

==Stadium==

The Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto is the home of Alajuelense and is owned and operated by La Liga Deportiva Alajuelense. It is located in &quot;El Llano&quot; neighborhood of Alajuela.

On July 20, 1966, due to a motion by the Municipality of Alajuela, the stadium was renamed in honor of Alejandro Morera, nicknamed &quot;el mago del balón&quot;, which means &quot;the magician of the ball&quot;. He was a notable former player of Alajuelense, Barcelona, and Hércules, and for commercial purposes, in an agreement with the financial institution Scotiabank in 2011, the name Scotiabank was added.

The project to find a proper site for a permanent home started in 1938, when the director of the club, Carlos Bolaños, proposed that the club should purchase its own land. The land was purchased on October 7, 1940, but the terrain would not be football-ready until when the first game was played on January 18, 1942, when Alajuelense played against Cartaginés; the stadium only had a simple wooden stand that was previously used in the Estadio Nacional.

On September 27, 1949, a professor from a local high school named Armando Morux Sancho started what was called &quot;La marcha del ladrillo&quot;, meaning &quot;The March of Bricks&quot; in which every student would donate a brick to help build the walls and stands of the stadium. The first stands to be built were located in north, west and east around the pitch.

On March 19, 1970, the stadium saw its first night game when Alajuelense faced Honduran club Motagua, beating them 4–1.

In 1979, the enlargement of the stadium was initiated with the project of building a second stand on top of the existing stand and adding an additional stand over the dressing and conference rooms (south) and also adding a roof to the stands located to the east and the south. The project was fully completed in 1984. The stadium was re-inaugurated that year along with the new illuminations, which were amongst the best illuminations systems at the time.

On 8 April 2021, the team announced plans for a new stadium, with an expected opening by January 2025.

==Mascot==
The team is now represented by a Lion and Lioness dressed with the team uniform and wearing cleats as if he was going to play.

In every home game, the mascot comes out at the pitch before the game starts and plays on the field with fans, jokes with rival&#x27;s fans, walk through the pitch with models giving away gifts from their sponsors and cheers the team with a huge team&#x27;s flag. Before the game starts and during the half-time break, the Lion walks among the crowd and stands for pictures with the children.

The original mascot used to be a Mango, this because the team is located in Alajuela that is known as &quot;La Ciudad de los Mangos&quot; (&quot;The Mangoes&#x27; City&quot;) because of the high amount of Mango Trees that could be located in the province due its weather, but later on in the early 80&#x27;s, the mascot was changed into a Lion.

The Lion was chosen years ago because it represents four main attributes of the major king of the jungle, that are reflected on the team&#x27;s vision and mission: Courage, Strength, Dynamism and Fidelity.

<text>Acrobatic Tenement is the debut studio album by American post-hardcore band At the Drive-In, released on August 18, 1996, on Flipside. The album was reissued by Fearless Records in 2004, along with the band&#x27;s subsequent albums &quot;In/Casino/Out&quot; and &quot;Relationship of Command&quot;, and was re-released again in 2013.

Only one track from &quot;Acrobatic Tenement&quot; appeared on the band&#x27;s 2005 retrospective compilation album &quot;This Station Is Non-Operational&quot;, with &quot;Initiation&quot; appearing as a live BBC recording.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Acrobatic Tenement&quot; was initially released on August 18, 1996, exclusively on compact disc through the Los Angeles–based independent record label/fanzine &quot;Flipside&quot;, after some of its editors saw the band perform in Los Angeles. The record was recorded at Commercial Soundworks in Hollywood for only $600 () after the band concluded a tour of the United States. The album has been noted for its lack of guitar distortion, due to guitarist Jim Ward believing that his distortion-free recorded parts would not be used for the final master.

Reflecting upon the aftermath of recording &quot;Acrobatic Tenement&quot;, frontman Cedric Bixler recalled in 2013: &quot;Before [the album&#x27;s release], the band had broken up. We did a U.S. tour and we decided to split up. I always needed Jim to be there, but he&#x27;d had a falling out with Omar [Rodríguez-Lopez]. We&#x27;d made a bunch of dumb moves at the time—kicked the drummer [Ryan Sawyer] who was on the record out, and then the other guitar player [Adam Amparan]—but then Tony [Hajjar] and Paul [Hinojos] came and played. Omar switched to guitar at the time, because he played bass on that album, so when we played live, it was a lot different.&quot;

Much of the album, particularly the track &quot;Ebroglio,&quot; was inspired by the life and suicide of Julio Venegas, a friend of the band. Venegas&#x27; death later inspired the concept album storyline of &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot;, the debut album by Bixler and Rodríguez&#x27; subsequent project the Mars Volta.

<doc id="1037430" wikidata="Q1638741" url="?curid=1037430" title="Portland Castle">
<text>Portland Castle is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, between 1539 and 1541. It formed part of the King&#x27;s Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the Portland Roads anchorage. The fan-shaped castle was built from Portland stone, with a curved central tower and a gun battery, flanked by two angular wings. Shortly after its construction it was armed with eleven artillery pieces, intended for use against enemy shipping, operating in partnership with its sister castle of Sandsfoot on the other side of the anchorage. During the English Civil War, Portland was taken by the Royalist supporters of King Charles I, and then survived two sieges before finally surrendering to Parliament in 1646.

Portland continued to be used as a fort until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, when it was converted into a private house. Fresh concerns over invasion led to the War Office taking it over once again in 1869, but the castle was not rearmed and was instead formed as accommodation for more modern neighbouring fortifications. During the First and Second World Wars it was used as offices, accommodation and as an ordnance store. In 1949, the War Office relinquished control, and in 1955 it was opened to the public by the state. In the 21st century it is managed by English Heritage and operated as a tourist attraction, receiving 22,207 visitors in 2010. Historic England consider the castle to form &quot;one of the best preserved and best known examples&quot; of King Henry&#x27;s forts.

==History==

===16th century===

Portland Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Basic defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.

In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Paul III in order to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, and he took the annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England appeared certain. In response, Henry issued an order, called a &quot;device&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.

As a consequence, Lord Russell inspected the coast along an anchorage known as Portland Roads, and concluded that two castles, Portland and Sandsfoot, should be constructed to protect it from naval attack. Work began that summer, with Oliver Lawrence acting as the royal paymaster for the project, and was completed by 1541, at a cost of £4,964. Thomas Mervin was appointed as captain, with a garrison of four gunners and two other men. In 1545, Mervin was replaced by John Leweston, who also took on responsibilities as the Lieutenant of Portland, along with a larger garrison of 13 men, paid for out of the proceeds of the recent Dissolution of the Monasteries. A survey between 1547 and 1548 reported that the castle was equipped with one brass demi-cannon, two brass demi-culverins, four breech-loading portpieces and four slings; it also held eight hagbushes–a type of early arquebus–along with twenty-three bows, twenty-nine bills and twelve pikes.

The threat of a French invasion passed, and peace was declared in 1558. Attention shifted away from Portland, and a 1574 survey reported that the castle was in a poor condition, with similar concerns being repeated in 1583. Tensions with Spain grew and military attention focused on the threat to the south-west of England. War broke out in 1585, and £228 was spent on renovating Portland Castle. In 1596, the garrison still comprised a captain and 13 men.

===17th–19th centuries===

In the early 1600s, England was at peace with France and Spain and the coastal forts, included Portland, received little attention. A 1623 survey reported that the castle was equipped with three culverins, nine demi-culverins and a saker, but that the fortifications had suffered badly from sea erosion and required extensive repairs. Fourteen years later, the castle had 15 guns and a garrison of a captain and 12 men.

When the English Civil War broke out in 1642, Portland was initially controlled by Parliamentary forces. The castle was captured in 1643 by a group of Royalists who gained access by pretending to be Parliamentary soldiers. As the war turned against the King in the south-west, Parliamentary forces besieged the castle for four months in 1644, and once again the following year. The castle finally surrendered to Vice-Admiral William Batten in April 1646. It is uncertain why the castle, which was not easily defensible on the landward side, proved so difficult to take; the historian Peter Harrington has suggested that its low-lying position may have made it difficult for Parliament to bombard it from the sea.

During the Interregnum, Portland Castle continued to be garrisoned and used a prison, with a unit of 103 men attached to it in 1651. It was used to defend the Portland Roads during the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1653, seeing action in a three-day long naval battle between English and Dutch forces. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660, he reduced the garrison to its pre-war levels but repaired the fortifications in the light of the continuing Dutch threat; in 1676 the castle was equipped with 16 guns.

Portland Castle continued in use through the 18th century, primarily protecting vessels against privateers, including merchant vessels carrying stone from the local Portland quarries. Reports in 1702 and 1715 complained about the dilapidated condition of the fortification – the sea had washed away of its foundations – and the number of artillery pieces was reduced to seven. By 1779, the castle had a caretaker garrison of three men and eight guns, and reportedly had not been repaired in the previous 30 years. During the Napoleonic Wars, the castle&#x27;s guns were increased to comprise six 24-pounder, six 12-pounders and two 9-pounder guns (10.9 kg, 5.4 kg and 4.1 kg respectively), but the fortification remained in a poor condition overall.

Following the final defeat of Napoleon, the castle was disarmed and leased to John Manning, a Portland churchman, who converted it from a fortress into a private house. John&#x27;s son, Charles Manning, took over the house in 1834 and continued to develop it. Among the Mannings&#x27; work was the conversion of an older house alongside the main castle, which had once housed the master gunner, into a grander property, known today as the Captain&#x27;s House. In the late 1840s, the Portland Roads were converted into an artificial harbour through the construction of a breakwater, and new forts were built on the Verne heights and the sea front to protect it, although the structure of the old castle itself was left untouched by the growing complex of forts. Charles died in 1869 and, amid ongoing invasion fears, the War Office took over the castle again for use as accommodation for commissioned officers, including as a house for the adjutant of the Verne Citadel.

===20th–21st centuries===

In the early years of the 20th century, the War Office and the Office of Works held discussions on how to manage the castle. In 1908, Portland was placed onto what was known as the Schedule C list, which meant that the Army would continue to use and manage the historic property, but with input on repairs from the Office of Works. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Portland Harbour became an important naval base and the castle was used an ordnance store. The castle became a military residence again in the interwar years, and during the Second World War it was used for accommodation and offices by British and US soldiers, with part of the castle used once again for storing ordnance. A concrete pillbox, since demolished, was constructed alongside the castle early on in the war.

After the conflict, Portland Castle was transferred to the Ministry of Works in 1949 and opened to the public in 1955. The Ministry decided to present the interior as it might have looked in the 16th century and removed most of the 19th- and 20th-century additions and changes. The Captain&#x27;s House and the adjacent gardens were used by the neighbouring HMS Osprey helicopter base until 1999, but with the facility&#x27;s closure, this part of the fort was also opened to visitors, the house being turned into a visitor facility.

In the 21st century the castle is operated by English Heritage as a tourist attraction, receiving 22,207 visitors in 2010. The main castle is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building, and the Captain&#x27;s House as a Grade II* building. 2023 saw the highest ever amount of annual visitors to Portland Castle of 30,000.

==Architecture==

The heart of the castle is the keep, across, comprising a central tower with two wings on either side and a gun battery to the front, together forming an unusual, fan-shaped design overlooking the sea. This is surrounded by a walled courtyard, approximately , with two gun platforms on either side of the keep. The Captain&#x27;s House occupies the western side of the courtyard, and the Governor&#x27;s Garden lies beyond the eastern wall. The castle is entered through an outer gateway on the southern side, surmounted by Charles II&#x27;s coat of arms.

When first built, the castle would have held three tiers of artillery, two in the front battery and a third layer in the central tower. The keep was originally protected by a moat, since filled in, with a drawbridge, of which only the slots now survive. The castle could have been protected at short-range with hand guns, although the gunloops for these were of an antiquated design for the period, and a moated earthwork, , was subsequently built to the rear of the castle to provide additional protection.

The keep is two storeys high, built of ashlar Portland stone. Historic England considers it to form &quot;one of the best preserved and best known examples&quot; of the Henrician forts. In the centre of the ground floor is the octagonal great hall, now fitted with large Victorian windows, which would have originally providing living space for the garrison. Off the great hall are wings holding the gunners&#x27; quarters and the castle&#x27;s kitchen, the latter equipped with a large, 16th-century fireplace. Running around the front of the keep is the gun room. This was originally a two-storey gun battery with embrasures for five guns on the ground floor and four more above on the first floor, with the southern end of the ground floor subdivided into four barrack rooms. The ground-floor embrasures were designed with vents to allow the smoke from the guns to escape. Both the wooden roof that formed the first-floor gun platform and the internal wooden partitions have been dismantled, however, and the chamber is now open to the air. It now houses a variety of 18th and 19th century cannons.

On the first floor is the upper hall and the captain&#x27;s chamber, used in the 16th century as a living and working space by the castle&#x27;s commander, and converted into a dining room and a bedroom in the 19th century. On the opposite side to the captain&#x27;s private chamber are two other bedrooms, possibly originally for the use of the castle&#x27;s lieutenant.

The current Governor&#x27;s Garden was created in 2002 by the horticulturist Christopher Bradley-Hole, as part of a wider programme of work across English Heritage properties. The maritime-themed garden features circular designs, echoing those in the adjacent castle, and uses local Portland stone.

<text>In/Casino/Out (stylized as in/CASINO/OUT) is the second studio album by American post-hardcore band At the Drive-In, released on August 18, 1998, through Fearless Records. Produced by Alex Newport, it is the band&#x27;s first full studio album to feature bass guitarist Paul Hinojos and drummer Tony Hajjar, who joined the band in 1996 for the tour in support of their debut album, &quot;Acrobatic Tenement&quot;.

&quot;In/Casino/Out&quot; is a live-in-studio album, recorded as such with the intention of better capturing the energy and sound of the band&#x27;s live shows. The album marks a middle ground between the raw, lo-fi production of &quot;Acrobatic Tenement&quot; and the sleeker, more produced sound subsequently heard on their third album, &quot;Relationship of Command&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album at #20 in their &quot;40 Greatest Emo Albums of All Time&quot; list.

==Background and recording==
During the recording of the album, At the Drive-In was initially unable to find a label willing to release it. By that point in time, Flipside, the label that issued &quot;Acrobatic Tenement&quot;, had ceased operations, and Offtime Records, which had released the &quot;El Gran Orgo&quot; EP the previous year, was not in the financial position to issue more releases. The group considered self-releasing the album until Fearless Records offered their support.

Recording for the album took place in early June 1998 at Messenger&#x27;s Studio in Hollywood. The entire recording was done live by the band, with little to no overdubs. Production duties were held by Alex Newport, with assistance from Doug Messenger at Harddrive Analog in North Hollywood; Newport also mixed the album &quot;half asleep&quot; at Paramount in Hollywood. Frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala recalled in 2015 that the band were &quot;rushed&quot; during the sessions and unable to &quot;&quot;&quot;execute maybe 30% of the ideas that were initially planned for the record because of a lack of time&quot;, though he also felt that the band benefited from the pressure.

&quot;In/Casino/Out&quot; marks founding member Jim Ward&#x27;s return to the band after not appearing on &quot;El Gran Orgo&quot;; the &quot;In/Casino/Out&quot; track &quot;Hourglass&quot; was the first At the Drive-In song for which he provided lead vocals.

<text>124 (one hundred [and] twenty-four) is the natural number following 123 and preceding 125.

==In mathematics==

124 is an untouchable number, meaning that it is not the sum of proper divisors of any positive number.

It is a stella octangula number, the number of spheres packed in the shape of a stellated octahedron. It is also an icosahedral number.

There are 124 different polygons of length 12 formed by edges of the integer lattice, counting two polygons as the same only when one is a translated copy of the other.

124 is a perfectly partitioned number, meaning that it divides the number of partitions of 124. It is the first number to do so after 1, 2, and 3.

<text>East Weare Battery is a former 19th-century gun battery to the east of the Verne Citadel on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. The battery was built in the 1860s as a result of the Royal Commission to guard the new Portland harbour and Royal Navy institutions on the island. Five open batteries were built housing 20 9&quot; and 10&quot; RMLs. After 1877 the batteries were designated by letter &#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;E&#x27;.

In 1900 the batteries were re-armed with more modern breech loading guns. &#x27;A&#x27; battery received two 9.2 inch Breech Loading (BL) guns and &#x27;B&#x27; battery received three BL 6 inch Mk VII guns on Central Pivot Mk II mounts. By 1919 the 6-inch guns had been removed, but the 9.2-inch guns remained in place until the dissolution of Coast Artillery in 1956.

The site was then used for training by the Royal Navy, which has damaged some of the gun positions. The batteries are derelict and there is no public access. Parts of the batteries are now listed as Ancient Monuments by Historic England.

<doc id="1037451" wikidata="Q1060600" url="?curid=1037451" title="The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life">
<text>The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life is a double-disc live album by American musician Frank Zappa, released in 1991. The album was one of four that were recorded during the 1988 world tour; the other three were &quot;Broadway the Hard Way&quot; (released in 1988), &quot;Make a Jazz Noise Here&quot; (released in 1991), and &quot;Zappa &#x27;88: The Last U.S. Show&quot; (posthumously released in 2021). 

Each of the first three accounts of the 1988 tour has a different emphasis: &quot;Broadway the Hard Way&quot; mainly consists of new compositions; &quot;Make a Jazz Noise Here&quot; is a sampler of classic Zappa tunes, most of them instrumental; and &quot;The Best Band...&quot; devotes itself to cover songs. Some of these are unlikely, such as &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; by Led Zeppelin, while many are from Zappa&#x27;s extensive back catalogue. His mid-1970s output is emphasized in the selection, but there is also some material from the Mothers of Invention&#x27;s late 1960s recordings and one song (&quot;Lonesome Cowboy Burt&quot;) from &quot;200 Motels&quot;. It was re-issued in 1995 and 2012 along with his entire catalogue.

The album is also notable for its extended section of potshots against American Pentecostal televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who had then just confessed to transgressions with a prostitute on live television; the speech was later dubbed his &quot;I have sinned&quot; speech. &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Burt&quot;, &quot;More Trouble Every Day&quot; and &quot;Penguin in Bondage&quot; feature entirely rewritten lyrics to capitalize on and satirize the scandal.

== Cover artwork ==
The original album simply featured a photograph of Frank Zappa and his band against a black background with blue lettering, but upon discovering that the photograph had been used without the permission of the photographer, Bruce Malone, Zappa simply continued issuing the cover with the photograph replaced with an empty black space. 

When the album was remastered and reissued worldwide in 1995 by Rykodisc, it featured artwork by long-time Zappa artist Cal Schenkel that had been created for the album&#x27;s original Japanese release. The Japanese kanji at the top of the sign on this version do not together form any meaningful sentence to a speaker of Japanese, but can be read with the on readings of fu-ran-ku-za-pa, an approximation of Frank Zappa in Japanese sounds. 

Schenkel used characters from his artwork on the cover of Zappa&#x27;s 1972 release &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot;, such as Stu (AKA Uncle Meat) and a man from the playing a Mystery Horn. In addition there is a red sofa, that while not an exact duplicate, is reminiscent of the red sofa from his art on Zappa&#x27;s 1975 &quot;One Size Fits All&quot;. In 2012, when the album was reissued, it returned the cover to the version featuring a blank space in place of the photograph.

== Track listing ==

<doc id="1037453" wikidata="Q3066755" url="?curid=1037453" title="The Soup Dragons">
<text>The Soup Dragons are a Scottish alternative rock band of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Named after a character in the 1970s children&#x27;s television series &quot;Clangers&quot;, the group is best known for its cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; song &quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot;, which was a top 5 hit in the United Kingdom in 1990; and &quot;Divine Thing&quot;, a top 40 hit in the United States in 1992.

==History==
The Soup Dragons formed in Bellshill, a town near Motherwell, in 1985. The line up was Sean Dickson (vocals, lead guitar, keyboards) (born 1966), Jim McCulloch (guitar, second voice) who replaced Ian Whitehall, and Sushil K. Dade (bass) (born Sushil Kumar Dade, 1966, Glasgow). The original drummer Ross A. Sinclair (born 1966, Bearsden, Glasgow) left the group after the first album &quot;This Is Our Art&quot; to pursue a career in art, and he was replaced by Paul Quinn (born 9 August 1963). Most of their songs were written by Sean Dickson.

The Soup Dragons recorded their first demo tape &quot;You Have Some Too&quot; after playing a few local gigs, and this was followed by a flexi disc single &quot;If You Were the Only Girl in the World&quot;. They signed to The Subway Organization in early 1986, and their first EP &quot;The Sun in the Sky&quot; was Buzzcocks-inspired pop punk. The band&#x27;s breakthrough came with their second single for Subway, &quot;Whole Wide World&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the UK Independent Chart in 1986. Dickson and McCulloch also played in BMX Bandits at this time. The band were signed by former Wham! co-manager Jazz Summers&#x27; label Raw TV with further indie hits (and minor UK Singles Chart hits) following during 1987 and 1988. Over the course of six singles (the first three collected in 1986 on a US-only compilation, &quot;Hang Ten&quot;), they gradually developed a complex rock guitar sound, which culminated in their first album &quot;This Is Our Art&quot;, now signed to major label Sire Records. After one single from the album - &quot;Kingdom Chairs&quot; - was released, they then returned to original label Raw TV and Big Life Records.

In the year after &quot;This Is Our Art&quot;, The Soup Dragons&#x27; sound underwent a change from an indie rock sound, to the rock-dance crossover sound; this was mainly due to being without a drummer and buying a sampler and drum machine and experimenting with sound with the release of the album &quot;Lovegod&quot;. This change can be attributed to the rise of the ecstasy-fueled acid house rave scene in the UK. In 1990, they released &quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot;, their most successful hit single in the UK and an up-tempo cover of a Rolling Stones song with an added toasting overdub by reggae star Junior Reid, which reached No. 5. The single later appeared on the soundtrack for the film &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot; (2013).

Subsequent albums continued in the band&#x27;s own style and in 1992, they enjoyed their biggest US hit with &quot;Divine Thing&quot;, which reached No. 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also hit No. 3 on the Modern Rock chart and its video was nominated by MTV as one of the year&#x27;s best, though beaten by Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.

The Soup Dragons disbanded in 1995. Paul Quinn joined Teenage Fanclub. Sushil K. Dade formed the experimental post rock group Future Pilot A.K.A. Sean Dickson formed The High Fidelity and has released many records and albums with other artists like Bootsy Collins, Yoko Ono, Crystal Waters and David McAlmont. Jim McCulloch joined Superstar, wrote and recorded music with Isobel Campbell, and formed the folk group Snowgoose. Ross A. Sinclair had a successful career in art, winning a number of international awards and becoming a Research Fellow at Glasgow School of Art, and still makes music to this day.

The story of the Soup Dragons is traced as part of the 2017 documentary &quot;Teenage Superstars&quot;.

The group announced on 27 March 2023 that the original line-up will play six reunion shows in the UK in October and November 2023. Support acts will be the Vaselines, BMX Bandits and a DJ set from the Pastels.

The band features in the book &quot;Postcards from Scotland&quot; detailing the 1980s and 1990s independent music scene in Scotland.

<doc id="1037457" wikidata="Q426101" url="?curid=1037457" title="...And the Circus Leaves Town">
<text>...And the Circus Leaves Town is the fourth and final studio album by American stoner rock band Kyuss, released on July 11, 1995, nearly a year before their breakup. Drummer Alfredo Hernández (Yawning Man) replaced Brant Bjork, who left Kyuss in 1993. The album features a tighter and more straightforward sound, both in songwriting and production, than the band&#x27;s preceding efforts. The album was not as commercially or critically successful as the previous &quot;Blues for the Red Sun&quot; and &quot;Welcome to Sky Valley&quot;. Critic Dean Brown attributes this partly to a lack of promotion and the band&#x27;s breakup, but also notes that the album &quot;deserves to be cherished as much as the two molten hot records that came right before it.&quot; A video was released for &quot;One Inch Man&quot;, the album&#x27;s only official single.

== Reception ==

The album received a positive review in &quot;Tharunka&quot;, an Australian student publication, in August 1995. The review described the lead single, &quot;One Inch Man&quot;, as &quot;unrepresentative&quot; of the album&#x27;s sound. Two of the tracks, &quot;Jumbo Blimp Jumbo&quot; and &quot;Catamaran&quot;, were compared favorably to Black Sabbath and Sonic Youth respectively, and the reviewer noted, &quot;What is admirable here too is singwriter/guitarist Josh&#x27;s seeming ability to formulate brilliantly executed songs, despite the regular adoption of atypical song-writing structures.&quot;

== Track listing ==
Writing credits adapted from the album&#x27;s liner notes.
== Notes ==

*The song &quot;Catamaran&quot; is a cover of a song originally recorded by drummer Alfredo Hernández&#x27; previous band Yawning Man.
*Hidden track &quot;Day One&quot; was originally released in Germany as part of the &quot;Demon Cleaner&quot; extended CD single under the title &quot;Day One (To Dave and Krist)&quot;. It was dedicated to the remaining Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, after Kurt Cobain&#x27;s suicide.
*The song &quot;Hurricane&quot; is featured in the 2006 video game &quot;Need for Speed: Carbon&quot;. An early recording of the song, as well as &quot;El Rodeo&quot;, was released on the &quot;Demon Cleaner&quot; single in 1994.

<text>Castleknock () is an affluent suburb located west of the centre of Dublin city, Ireland. It is centred on the village of the same name in Fingal.

In addition to the suburb, the name &quot;Castleknock&quot; also refers to older units of land division: a townland, a civil parish and a barony.

==Etymology==
In a poem relating to the earliest centuries after Christ, the origin of the name Cnucha is connected with Conn of the Hundred Battles, and the name is said to have been borne by his foster mother: —

As the word &quot;Castle&quot; did not come into use in Ireland until Norman times we know that &quot;Castleknock&quot; is a name of comparatively recent origin. Documents from the 12th and 13th centuries refer to the place as Castrum Cnoc, simply Cnoc and also Chastel-cnoc or Castel-Cnoc. So it seems that the name Castleknock is rooted in the topography of the hill or &quot;cnoc&quot; located at the centre of the modern neighbourhood and/or the personal name of the mother of a semi-legendary High King i.e. &quot;Cnucha&quot; and the building of a castle by Normans on this site in the 12th century.

==History==

===Gaelic period===
There is some documentary evidence in chapter 72 of the Life of St. Patrick by Jocelin of Furness to support the belief that when St. Patrick had finished his visit to the City of Dubh Linn he came to Castleknock to try to convert Murinus, the local ruler of the place. Despite his efforts Patrick was unsuccessful and departed while imparting a curse on the King.

According to the Four Masters in the year 726 the death occurred of Congalach of Cnucha.

In 916 the Annals tells us that Niall Glindubh of the Northern Uí Neill became High King of Ireland and is referred to as &quot;Niall of Cnucha&quot; which signifies both the ascent of Cnucha (Castleknock) in prominence as well as the descent of Tara as a royal seat. In September 919, Niall gathered the Irish Chiefs and their armies at Castleknock from where they led a fight against the Danes who had regained their power over Dublin. The Battle of Islandbridge, also known as the Battle of Áth Cliath, proved to be Niall&#x27;s last battle. He was slain along with five other Irish Chiefs and their armies were subdued.

===Feudal period===
In 1171, the High King of Ireland, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, gathered his forces at Cnucha to counter the Norman invasion of Ireland. Ua Conchobair was comfortable at Cnuch having overcome his Danish vassals in the Kingdom of Dublin some years previously. The siege exerted pressure on the forces of the Cambro-Norman leader, Strongbow, who asked the Archbishop of Dublin, Lawrence O&#x27;Toole to negotiate with the High King at Cnucha. Strongbow&#x27;s offer to recognise Ua Concubhair as High King was rejected. He was commanded to depart from Ireland immediately. Strongbow was furious but Maurice de Prendergast, who had accompanied Archbishop O&#x27;Toole, had observed that the Irish troops were largely inactive and unready for battle. His report to Strongbow spurred him to lead a successful attack against the High King&#x27;s armies. Ua Concubhair fell back from Cnucha and the other Irish Chiefs returned to their territories. The battle was lost and the Norman conquest of Ireland was successful. Following the siege, the Normans realised the strategic importance of the location which looked over the city of Dublin. Consequently in 1177, a feudal barony of Castleknock was created out of the Lordship of Meath by Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath who granted it to Hugh Tyrrel. It was held for three and a half knight&#x27;s fees, owed to the superior Lord of Fingal.

The title and lands of Castleknock were held by the Tyrell family until 1370 when Hugh Tyrell and his wife died of the plague. It passed by inheritance to the Burnell family. The first Baron, Hugh Tyrrel, gave lands in the barony at Kilmainham to the Knights of St. John whose legacy continues in the area today in the form of St. John Ambulance. Later, civil parishes, based on the boundaries of the ecclesiastical parishes of the Established church were used to sub-divide the barony.

In 1185, the second baron, Richard de Tyrell, gave a grant of land to the Benedictine Monks of the Abbey of Little Malvern, Worcestershire, to endow a religious house at Castleknock in honour of Saint Brigid. Later they built a chapel, the White Chapel at Coolmine, which served the parish of Clonsilla. In 1219 the great tithes of the parish were appropriated by Archbishop Henry de Londres to the Priory of Malvern on condition that they should add five monks to their number. In 1225 the monks granted half of the tithes of the manor of Castleknock to the use of St Patrick’s Cathedral, renouncing to the Archbishop all rights to the vicarage and its small tithes and oblations. In 1226 the first Prebendary of Castleknock, Richard De Gnouessale, was appointed. However, by 1468 the church and lands at Castleknock were transferred to the ownership of the Abbey of St Mary in Dublin city.

===Modern period===
Following the English Reformation and the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII of England, the Priory at Castleknock was destroyed and in 1609 a church was built on the site for the use of the Church of Ireland. The foundation stone of the church, which is in use today, still on the site of the Abbey, was laid in 1803. The spire was added in 1864 by friends of the late James Hans Hamilton as a memorial to the 1st Baron Holmpatrick of Abbottown and MPfor the County of Dublin.

Castleknock eventually came to be divided among a number of important families and their country estates. These included the Guinnesses at Farmleigh, and Knockmaroon, the Laidlaws at Abbey Lodge, the Godleys at Oatlands, and the Brookes at Sommerton House. The Earl of Iveagh&#x27;s principal seat was at Farmleigh until 1999 when it was purchased by the Government of Ireland. It was restored and converted into a State Guest House and opened to the public in 2001. Although they left Farmleigh in 1999, the Guinness family are still present in Castleknock at Knockmaroon House and its Demesne, located on Carpenterstown Road and the seat of Lord Moyne. The Brooke Baronets lived at Sommerton House until they sold it in 1911 to the Laidlaw family who were resident at Sommerton and Abbey Lodge until the 1980s.

==Castleknock today==

The neighbourhood has developed and extended around the old village, which is a busy commercial centre with several supermarkets and other retail outlets. There are several cafes and restaurants, and a post office.

===Location and access===
Castleknock contains three townlands, Castleknock, Carpenterstown, and Diswellstown and is divided across two electoral divisions. 

The neighbourhood is located mostly between Phoenix Park and the Royal Canal. The neighbourhood is bordered to the west by the large suburb of Blanchardstown, to the east by the Phoenix Park, to the north by Dunsink and to the south by the village of Chapelizod above the Liffey valley. The suburb is in the Dublin 15 postal area.

The area can be accessed from Junction 6 on the M50 motorway, on either side of which it lies, from the R147 Navan Road, from Chesterfield Avenue and the Castleknock Gate of the Phoenix Park, and via Knockmaroon Hill in Chapelizod. Dublin Bus operate a number of services through Castleknock. These include Route 37 which runs from Blanchardstown Town Centre to Wilton Terrace, Baggot Street, and Route 38 from Burlington Road, in the southern part of Dublin city centre, towards Damastown and vice versa.

Irish Rail operate suburban train services on the Western Suburban Railway Line or Maynooth Line from Dublin Connolly to Maynooth. An earlier railway station called Blanchardstown was designed by John Skipton Mulvaney and completed in 1849 at Castleknock. The station was closed in 1937 and the landmark was later demolished in the late 1980s to make way for the M50 motorway. A new modern Castleknock railway station was built close by and opened on 2 July 1990.

The Royal Canal was completed in 1817 to transport freight and passengers from the River Liffey in the City of Dublin to Longford. Having fallen into disuse at the start of the 20th century the canal is now restored and mostly used for pleasure. The canal&#x27;s 12th lock is located at Castleknock Marina.

The Diswellstown Stream rises in two branches in the area. One branch comes from Carpenterstown, where Bracken Park Drive now lies and is culverted for its first stretch. The other comes from south of Park Avenue in Castleknock village and flows in the open along the western edge of the Castleknock College grounds. The branches come together near the area known as the Sand Holes or Sandpits in Diswellstown, and the stream flows directly south to join the Liffey.

===Education===
There are three primary schools in the village: Castleknock National School (Church of Ireland), St Brigid&#x27;s Primary School (Catholic), and Educate Together (non-denominational). Outside the village proper, &quot;Scoil Thomáis&quot; (co-educational) is located in the Laurel Lodge district, while St Patrick&#x27;s (co-educational) is in the townland of Diswellstown. A state secondary school, Castleknock Community College (multi-denominational), is located on Carpenterstown Road. A fee-paying secondary school for girls, Mount Sackville, under the care of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny, is located on Tower Road, Knockmaroon Hill, Chapelizod. The suburb is also home to Castleknock College, a voluntary Vincentian secondary school for boys which has produced numerous alumni in the fields of arts, politics, sports, science and business.

===Religion===
In the Church of Ireland, the church of St Brigid, sited on the ruins of an ancient monastery, is located in the middle of the village. In the Catholic Church, there are two parishes in the area: &quot;Our Lady Mother of the Church&quot;, located close to the village and St Thomas the Apostle parish, Laurel Lodge. Both St Brigid&#x27;s and St Thomas the Apostle contain windows from the Harry Clarke Studios. The window in St Brigid&#x27;s was commissioned in 1927 by R.F. Brookes of Somerton House, Castleknock, to commemorate members of his family, whereas the Harry Clarke window in St Thomas the Apostle was donated by the Dominican Order after their convent at Dún Laoghaire closed in 1991. It depicts the Immaculate Conception of Mary.

====Holy wells====
In the townland of Diswellstown, there is a historic &quot;rag well&quot; - a holy well near which rags were left. Although it still flows, it was &quot;buried&quot; by Dublin County Council, and its site is now marked by a carved flagstone. It used to be attended especially on the eve of 1 May.

A second holy well, dedicated to St Brigid is located near the Church of Ireland church in Castleknock village; its spring, still flowing, has been covered by a pump for many years. Adjacent are stones with two quotations from the Bible. Local tradition held that the water of the well was safe for humans and hazardous for &quot;lower animals&quot;.

===Government and representation===
Castleknock is located in the &quot;Castleknock ward&quot; for the purposes of elections to Fingal County Council. For national polls, it is in the Dublin West Dáil constituency and for European Parliament elections, the Dublin constituency.

<text>Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford, (19 November 1870 – 14 November 1949), was a prominent Liberal and later National Liberal politician in the United Kingdom. His 1938 diplomatic mission to Czechoslovakia was key to the enactment of the British policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany preceding the Second World War.

== Background ==
Runciman was the son of the shipping magnate Walter Runciman, 1st Baron Runciman. He was educated at South Shields High School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with an MA degree in history in 1892.

== Political career ==

===1899–1913===
Runciman unsuccessfully contested Gravesend in a by-election in 1898, but was elected as a member of parliament (MP) in a two-member by-election for Oldham in 1899, defeating the Conservative candidates, James Mawdsley and Winston Churchill. After winning, Runciman is reported to have commented to Churchill: &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I don&#x27;t think this is the last the country has heard of either of us.&quot; The following year in the 1900 general election Churchill stood against Runciman again and defeated him.

Runciman soon returned to Parliament for Dewsbury in a by-election in January 1902 and steadily rose through the ranks of the Liberal Party. A progressive, centrist reformer who supported progressive measures such as old age pensions, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Local Government Board by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman in 1905, a post he held until 1907. Runciman&#x27;s friends in Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s cabinet were Sydney Buxton, Charles Hobhouse and John Morley, all on the left.

He then served as Financial Secretary to the Treasury until 1908. In April of the latter year he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed to his first Cabinet post, President of the Board of Education, by the new prime minister, H. H. Asquith, which position he retained for three years. Runciman approved of financing the purchase of land in Ireland, but the policy was becoming prohibitively expensive. He was one of the small group, that included Reginald McKenna, who believed in sound public finances; they had witnessed the lax administration of the Chief Secretary for Ireland. 

Runciman, along with McKenna and Lord Haldane, pressured Prime Minister H. H. Asquith to reject Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George&#x27;s 1910 People&#x27;s Budget raising taxes on the landed aristocracy and upper class to pay for welfare programs.

He then served another three years as President of the Board of Agriculture. Runciman did not want war with the German Empire and favoured an understanding with her, but like others in the Cabinet was not able to exert much influence over foreign policy.

=== Other policies ===
Runciman was a personal friend of Margot Asquith, and a highly valued colleague in Cabinet. He supported the Haldane Mission of 1912, in a purged cabinet dominated by like-minded Liberal Leaguers. He and his allies believed that there would be peace in the long run, as the Imperial German Navy was &#x27;a luxury&#x27; too expensive for the Reich to maintain. Runciman was also in the McKenna dining group that opposed escalation of the Anglo-German naval arms race, and in January 1914 opposed First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill&#x27;s high naval estimates. The left-wing cabinet members desired specificity to Admiralty reductions, but the admirals themselves opposed them.

Runciman joined Lloyd George&#x27;s &quot;Council of War&quot; on 13 June, which was mainly designed to exculpate Lloyd George of any involvement in the Marconi scandal. Runciman had done much to encourage Lloyd George as Chancellor in increasing levels of trade.

Runciman encouraged political dialogue, socialism, and James Larkin&#x27;s movement in Ireland, which the cabinet swiftly sought to decriminalise. Runciman was one of those who agreed to fight the Larne gun-running incident by seizure of weapons. The cabinet banned all arms shipments to Ireland on 25 November.

Runciman was also sympathetic to addressing issues concerning rural areas, such as improved wages for agricultural labourers and the provision of housing.

=== Opposing total war ===
In 1914, on the British entry into World War I, the President of the Board of Trade, John Burns, resigned and on Sunday 2 August Runciman was appointed to succeed him.

The Board of Trade reported in October 1914 a build-up of German shipping at Hamburg; a record 187 ships entered British ports on 15 October, meaning the war seemed to be good for business. He approved food for Belgian refugees. On 12 January 1915, he agreed to send a memo to the US government to ban all copper imports to Ireland.

Runciman was wholly sympathetic to Lloyd George&#x27;s proposal to actively intervene in union wage disputes since &quot;men were not malingering, but worn out...&quot;. The statement preceded the mass employment of women in factories. Runciman proposed a bill &quot;commandeering&quot; the armaments factories for the national war effort. Sitting between McKenna and Hobhouse, he announced an industrial agreement to pay a guaranteed 15% dividend, plus depreciation. They discussed bringing German-owned dye industries into British ownership and a prohibition of coal exports.

Runciman encouraged Kitchener at dinner to remove Sir John French from command of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). They also discussed Asquith&#x27;s removal since his wife, Hilda Runciman, had called the Prime Minister &quot;brains in aspic&quot;. Runciman was against any suggestion of internment of aliens, yet they were nonetheless confined in large numbers.

===Board of Trade===

In May 1915, after seeking Sir Edward Grey&#x27;s counsel at the Foreign Office, Runciman agreed to serve in Asquith&#x27;s new coalition government. Asquith had formed this without consulting most of the outgoing Liberal cabinet; a week later he was promoted to President of the Board of Trade. By October, the cabinet was in open conflict, with the Conservatives (and Chancellor Lloyd George) demanding the introduction of conscription. He threatened to resign over the issue but in the end did not do so when it was carried into law in the Military Service Act 1916.

Like McKenna, Runciman was against total warfare of which Compulsory Service formed a major part. He resented the Conservative Army interests pre-eminent in government from spring 1916. General Haig had been convinced they intended to split the cabinet against Asquith. Runciman and his allies continued to argue that conscription would damage the war effort by &quot;depleting industry&quot;; Margot Asquith had already tried to split up the axis within the Cabinet by inviting Runciman and then McKenna to tea separately. However, Runciman continued to enjoy good relations with the Chancellor because they shared the aims of improving trade receipts, reducing debt, and increasing output.

Runciman resigned along with the rest of Asquith&#x27;s government in December 1916. He did not serve in the new coalition headed by David Lloyd George. In the splits that were to rage in the Liberal Party for the next seven years, Runciman remained prominent in opposition to Lloyd George, especially when the latter became Leader of the Liberal Party in 1926.

He lost his seat in the 1918 general election, and failed to get elected in the 1920 Edinburgh North by-election but was returned for Swansea West in the 1924 general election.

===1929–1940===

In the 1929 general election, the Liberals emerged holding the balance of power between the Conservatives and Labour. Runciman took the seat of St Ives, which his wife Hilda had won in a by-election the previous year. Capt. Sydney Augustus Velden, Liberal Agent for St. Ives was instrumental in Runciman&#x27;s successful election. The Runcimans were the first man and wife to sit concurrently in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Liberals soon found themselves heavily divided over how to respond to the Great Depression, whether or not to continue supporting the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald and even over the basic direction of the party.

In 1931, the cause of the strife was seemingly removed when the Labour government was succeeded by an all-party National Government. Further division emerged, however, when it was proposed that the National Government call a general election to seek a mandate to introduce protective tariffs, a policy that was anathema to Runciman and many other Liberals. Officially, the Liberals threatened to withdraw from the government, but a group led by Sir John Simon emerged as the Liberal Nationals, mainly composed of those who had been opposed to Lloyd George&#x27;s leadership and who were prepared to continue to support the National Government. A compromise was worked out whereby each party in the National Government campaigned on its own manifesto.

After the National Government won a massive majority in the 1931 general election, the Cabinet was reconstructed. It was felt prudent to balance the key Cabinet committee that would take the decisions on tariffs; and so Runciman was appointed President of the Board of Trade once more, in the belief that he would serve as a counterbalance to the protectionist Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain. However, like the other Liberal Nationals, Runciman came to accept the principle of tariffs, amended in November 1931 to 10% in favour of a balance of trade recommended by a Tariff Board. When in late 1932 the official Liberals (the Samuelites) resigned their ministerial posts, Runciman very nearly resigned with them. In 1933 the official Liberals withdrew completely their support for the National Government but Runciman remained in office, despite holding the presidency of the extra-Parliamentary National Liberal Federation until 1934. He concluded the Roca-Runciman Treaty with Argentina (one of the events of the Infamous Decade), initiated by that country to avoid the curtailment of Argentine beef imports. 

In a 1934 speech Runciman defended the record of the National Government, citing measures such as a town and country planning country act, “the opening of the greatest crusades against slums ever attempted in any country,” and an upcoming unemployment insurance bill.

Runciman remained as President of the Board of Trade until May 1937 when Stanley Baldwin retired and his successor, Neville Chamberlain, only offered Runciman the sinecure position of Lord Privy Seal, an offer Runciman declined. In June 1937 he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Runciman of Doxford, of Doxford in the County of Northumberland. Four years earlier his father had been created Baron Runciman and &quot;of Doxford&quot; was consequently used to differentiate from his father&#x27;s title. This was a rare case of a father and son sitting in the House of Lords at the same time, with the son holding a superior title. A few months later his father died, and he inherited both the barony and his father&#x27;s shipping business.

===Mission to Czechoslovakia===

Runciman returned to public life in early August 1938, when Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain sent him on a mission to Czechoslovakia to mediate in a dispute between the Government of Czechoslovakia and the Sudeten German Party (SdP), which represented most of the ethnic Germans of the border regions, which were known as the Sudetenland. Unknown to Runciman, the SdP, which ostensibly called for autonomy for the Sudetenland, followed instructions from Nazi Germany not to reach any agreement on the matter, and thus the attempts at mediation failed. With international tension rising in Central and Eastern Europe, Runciman was recalled to London on 16 September 1938.

The published outcome of the mission, known as the Runciman Report, was issued by the mediator on 21 September 1938 in the form of letters addressed to Neville Chamberlain and Edvard Beneš, the President of Czechoslovakia. The report held the SdP responsible for breaking off negotiations with the Czechoslovak government although the revised government proposals met &quot;almost all the requirements&quot; of the SdP. Runciman considered the actions of the Czechoslovak authorities to be &quot;not actively oppressive, and certainly not &#x27;terroristic&#x27;&quot; but &quot;marked by tactlessness, lack of understanding, petty intolerance and discrimination&quot;. The multiple complaints of economic and political discrimination voiced by the Sudeten Germans were, he believed, &quot;in the main justified&quot; and gave rise to a feeling of &quot;hopelessness&quot;, but &quot;the rise of Nazi Germany gave them new hope&quot;. Runciman, therefore, considered &quot;their turning for help towards their kinsmen and their eventual desire to join the Reich as a natural development in the circumstances&quot;. This led him to conclude &quot;that these frontier districts should at once be transferred from Czechoslovakia to Germany&quot;.

Chamberlain agreed to the transfer of the border regions of Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany at the Munich Conference on 30 September 1938. Archival evidence suggests that the recommendations of the Runciman Report were amended at a late stage of the drafting to provide justification for Chamberlain&#x27;s policy of territorial transfer.

Further controversy arose from Runciman&#x27;s use of his weekend leisure time in Czechoslovakia. That was spent mostly but not entirely on the country estates of members of the SdP-supporting Sudeten German aristocracy in a social and political environment hostile to the Czechoslovak government.

In October 1938, after the Munich Agreement, Chamberlain reshuffled his Cabinet and appointed Runciman as Lord President of the Council. He held that post until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939.

== Family ==
Lord Runciman of Doxford married Hilda, daughter of James Cochran Stevenson, in 1898. They had two sons and three daughters. Their daughter Margaret Fairweather (married Douglas Fairweather who established the Air Movements Flight in 1942, later joined by Margaret) was the first woman to fly a Spitfire and was one of the original eight female pilots selected by Pauline Gower to join the Air Transport Auxiliary. Margaret was killed in 1944 whilst landing a Proctor. Their second son, the Honourable Sir Steven Runciman, was a historian. Lord Runciman of Doxford died in November 1949, aged 78, and was succeeded in the viscountcy by his eldest son, Leslie. Lady Runciman died in 1956, aged 87.

<text>Coolock () is a large suburban area, centred on a village, on Dublin city&#x27;s Northside in Ireland. Coolock is crossed by the Santry River, a prominent feature in the middle of the district, with a linear park and ponds. The Coolock suburban area encompasses parts of three Dublin postal districts: Dublin 5, Dublin 13 and Dublin 17.

The extensive civil parish of Coolock takes in the land between the Tonlegee Road (as far as Donaghmede) and the Malahide Road, as well as the lands on either side of the Malahide Road between Darndale and Artane, and the lands either side of the Oscar Traynor Road on the approach to Santry.

Coolock is also the name of the barony which accounts for most of north Dublin city, from the coast as far as Phoenix Park, and stretching north as far as Swords.

==History==
Coolock has a history dating back over 3,500 years – a Bronze-Age burial site in the area dates back to 1500 BC. The settlement grew up around a small early-Christian church. A Catholic church, St. John&#x27;s, was later built in the area (see Parish of Coolock (Roman Catholic) and Coolock parish (Church of Ireland) for more). The feudal barony of Coolock was granted in 1199 by Henry II to the Archbishop of Dublin.

Coolock remained a small village until the 1950s, with lands around the village being further developed over time, notably Bonnybrook and Kilmore West, between which a new centre to the area formed. At one time the old village was on the Malahide Road but that road was diverted and now passes slightly to the east of the village; in the meantime, a secondary hamlet, Newtown Coolock, developed further north.

Later again, lands in the north of Coolock were developed to form the new districts of Darndale and Priorswood.

==Nature==
Coolock lies on either side of the valley of the Santry River and includes a diversion from the little Naniken River. It is a relatively flat area a little above sea level, with a linear park around the Santry, and small green areas scattered through residential developments.

==Location / character==

Coolock lies at the centre of the majority working-class Northside suburbs such as Kilbarrack, Donaghmede and the Edenmore part of Raheny, and itself includes localities such as Ayrfield, Bonnybrook, Darndale, Priorswood, Greencastle and Kilmore West. As with other large suburban areas, such as Tallaght or Swords, there is no legal definition for Coolock, and so no definitive population figures, but it is one of Dublin&#x27;s largest residential areas. It is crossed by the Oscar Traynor Road, running from the Malahide Road to Santry, and named for the War of Independence politician, later long-serving minister, Oscar Traynor.

The majority of Coolock, excluding Ayrfield, was built-up by the then city authority, Dublin Corporation, as part of a programme of the phased inner-city slum clearance (between, roughly, 1952 and 1987). Dublin City Council calculates that addresses containing &quot;Coolock&quot; comprise the largest stock of local authority houses within its jurisdiction and the area is central to the linear range of local authority building that took place between the 1960s and the 1980s across Dublin&#x27;s Northside - i.e. Ballymun including Poppintree, Kilmore, Coolock, Edenmore, Kilbarrack and Donaghmede.

The permanent Traveller halting site estates (which differ in layout to traditional halting sites) of Cara Park and Dominick Park, found in the Belcamp area (along the N32) are among the largest halting site facilities provided by local authorities in Ireland. They contain an adult education centre and pre-school facilities for the local Traveller population, both located beside Dominick Park. At least one smaller, more traditional, Traveller settlement is found in the area, close to the Clare Hall Shopping Centre.

==Amenities==


Public parks in the area include the Santry River Linear Park and in Bonnybrook the Stardust Memorial Garden which is dedicated to the 48 people who lost their lives in the Stardust nightclub. Parnells GAA club is based in Coolock village.

Coolock is also a centre of local government activity, with a Dublin City Council major centre, NEAR FM community radio station, a Health Services Executive centre and a recycling centre.

==Localities==
* Ayrfield, an area beginning on the north side of the Tonlegee Road, predominantly within the Dublin 13 postal code, opposite Edenmore, and near Donaghmede and Darndale, containing several estates such as Rathvale, Limewood (part of Dublin 5), Millbrook, Slademore, Foxhill, Greenwood and Ard na Greine. Ayrfield has one primary school, St. Pauls Junior and Senior National School. The main access road, Blunden Drive, is the home of Ayrfield Credit Union, Ayrfield Community Centre and O&#x27;Tooles GAC clubhouse and playing pitches. Ayrfield is also a parish in the Howth deanery of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin. It is served by the Church of St Paul. It is also home to Ayrfield United F.C. which has pitches beside the credit union.
*Belcamp, today comprising some housing between Darndale and Priorswood but historically referring to a broader rural area. It is situated near the site of the former Belcamp Cottage and included cottages demolished to make way for the N32 road. Belcamp Hall, designed by architect James Hoban is a feature.
*Bonnybrook, a locality within the core of Coolock, above the original village, site of the main shopping centre, and with its own Catholic church and primary school.
*Clonshaugh (), (now in Dublin 17) stretching from the large Clonshaugh Industrial Estate opposite Kilmore all the way to the AUL, close to Baskin Lane. This includes Riverside, a housing estate at the side of the Santry River, with over 500 residents, first described as being in Santry, but with the postal district changed from Dublin 5 (old main Coolock code) to Dublin 17, and Newbury, situated behind Riverside, accessed from the Clonshaugh Road.
*Darndale, built as a range of social housing estates, east of Clonshaugh and west of Clare Hall. It comprises Buttercup Park, Marigold Court, Primrose Grove, Snowdrop Walk and Tulip Court.
*Greencastle, a locality within the core of Coolock, above the original village.
*Kilmore as a whole is a large area west of the Malahide Road and east of the M1, where Coolock meets Artane and Beaumont; of this, Kilmore West is entirely within Coolock and includes the sub-locality of Cromcastle, which features numerous multi-storey council flat blocks in the same style as blocks in Kilbarrack.
*Priorswood, a small, densely populated locality found between Belcamp and Clonshaugh, comprising the housing estates of Moatview, Fairfield and Ferrycarrig.
*St. Brendan&#x27;s Estate, located across the Malahide Road from Coolock village proper, and comprises St. Brendan&#x27;s Drive, Avenue and Park, Moatfield and Dunree Park.

Located between Donaghmede and Coolock is Clare Hall, a later housing estate, which includes a small shopping precinct, and the large Clarehall Shopping Centre which is anchored by Tesco Extra.

There are a number of roads named after the 1969 Moon landing, including Tranquility Grove (after Tranquility Base), Eagle Park (Lunar Module Eagle), Apollo Way (Apollo 11), Armstrong Walk (Neil Armstrong) and Aldrin Walk (Buzz Aldrin).

==Religion==
Coolock has given its name to religious divisions over a long period, and the primary historical ones are discussed at Parish of Coolock (Roman Catholic), and (from the Act of Supremacy), Parish of Coolock (Church of Ireland). Both Catholic (multiple) and Church of Ireland buildings stand within the area today. In the Catholic divisions, additional parishes today include Bonnybrook and Ayrfield (encompassing the Greenwood estate).

==Education==
* Chanel College, a large boys secondary school and adult education source, founded in 1955

* The Donahies Community School, a large secondary school and adult education source, founded in 1977
* Coláiste Dhúlaigh Post Primary, Co-ed secondary school in Coolock, located beside Northside Shopping Centre.
* Coláiste Dhúlaigh College of Further Education provides third-level courses (QQI, BTEC and FETAC)
* Mercy College is a voluntary, Catholic girls secondary school
* St. Pauls Junior and Senior National School, Ayrfield
* St. Francis, Priorswood
* The now-defunct Catholic Belcamp College secondary school in the nearby area of Balgriffin, which operated from 1893–2004

==Businesses and retail facilities==

The outskirts of Coolock host several factories and industrial estates. Cadbury Ireland has been manufacturing chocolate products since 1957, for both the Irish market and for export. The nearby Tayto Crisps factory manufactured snack foods until it closed in 2005.

Notable retail facilities include Northside Shopping Centre, Ireland&#x27;s first covered shopping centre, situated near accesses to the M1 and M50, with more than 70 outlets and a city council swimming pool.

==Popular culture==
Famous historical figures linked to the area included Henry Grattan of Belcamp Park, and the novelist Charles Lever.

===Film and television===
The Coolock area was featured extensively during location shooting for the 1991 film &quot;The Commitments&quot;, directed by Alan Parker and starring a mainly unknown cast at the time.

==Transport==
Coolock, which is not crossed by any rail systems, is serviced by main roads, including the N32 and Oscar Traynor Roads which link to the M1, and by the following Dublin Bus routes:
* N6 - Kilbarrack to Finglas (Finglas Village)
* 27 - Jobstown to Coolock (Clare Hall Avenue)

<doc id="1037464" wikidata="Q7070261" url="?curid=1037464" title="Nursing bra">
<text>A nursing bra is a specialized brassiere that provides additional support to women who are lactating and permits comfortable breastfeeding without the need to remove the bra. This is accomplished by specially designed bra cups that include flaps which can be opened with one hand to expose the nipple. The flap is usually held closed with a simple clasp or hook.

==Purpose==

A nursing bra is designed to provide quick and easy access to the breast for the purpose of breastfeeding an infant. It typically has flaps or panels that can be unclipped and folded down or to the side with one hand. Nursing bras can be worn under a variety of outer garments.

===Changes during pregnancy===

Measurements for an appropriate nursing bra can be performed by a lactation consultant. Women can choose nursing bras with strong side and undercup support and an extra-wide back for optimal support. Nursing bras usually have up to four rows of hooks in the rear closure to allow the woman to adjust her band size to a limited extent. Experts recommend a soft-cup bra made of a blend of cotton and Lycra with cups that stretch to accommodate changes in breast size. Most women buy two or more nursing bras so they can alternate between them. Small-breasted women who do not usually wear a bra may choose to wear a nursing bra to support their larger breasts or simply to prevent milk from leaking onto their clothes. Women should consider buying a maternity bra as soon as their regular bras begin feeling uncomfortable or notice their breasts are changing. This is normally around the 4 months mark.

===Breast sizes change===

A woman&#x27;s breasts grow during pregnancy, usually 1 to 2 cup sizes, and potentially several cup sizes. A woman who wore a C-cup bra prior to her pregnancy may need to buy a larger bra while nursing. Once the baby is born and about 50 to 73 hours after birth, the mother will experience her breasts filling with milk (sometimes referred to as “milk coming in”) and at that point changes in the breast happen very quickly. Once lactation begins, the woman&#x27;s breasts swell significantly and can feel achy, lumpy and heavy (which is referred to as engorgement).

===Changes during nursing===
To provide proper support and fit, to facilitate nursing, and to avoid engorged breasts or other complications that prevent an infant from nursing effectively, it is important to wear nursing bras that fit well. When a woman wears a bra that is too tight, her milk supply may be reduced, and she can experience plugged milk ducts and an extremely painful infection called mastitis. Mastitis can physically and emotionally affect the mother&#x27;s ability to breastfeed.

==Types of nursing bras==
There are an increasing variety of nursing bra designs, including softcup, underwire, seamless, and lounging styles. Some nursing bras can also serve as a sports bra, allowing a nursing mother to exercise more easily. Some outerwear like tank tops and T-shirts have nursing bras that are built into the garment, and there are also padded and plus-size nursing bras. Some experts advise against wearing an underwire nursing bra because they can restrict the flow of milk and cause mastitis. Most nursing bras have traditionally been white, but manufacturers now offer an increasing selection of colors and styles, including brown, teal, floral, and floral animal prints, and some are accessorized with lace and ribbon.

Different manufacturers use different methods for fastening the flap to the cup, including squeeze, snaps, clasps and hooks. Most nursing bras are designed with cup flaps that fasten at the apex of the bra, at the point where the shoulder straps attach, allowing the mother to simply pull the top half of the cup down to facilitate access to the nipple. Other designs include flaps that fasten between the cups at the center of the bra, zippers under each cup, and a cross-over design that allows the woman to slip her breast out. Experts recommend that before buying a nursing bra women should try on the bra and experiment with opening the flap with one hand. Some designs utilizing stretchable fabric are suitable for smaller-breasted women, allowing them to pull the entire bra up over the breast to facilitate nursing.

Experts recommend nursing bras that are stretchy, absorbent, and don&#x27;t bind the breasts in any way that could interfere with milk flow. Women are recommended to wear a bra that is 100 percent cotton or a cotton-Lycra blend or other stretchy synthetic. It is not necessary to wear a bra at night, although if a woman&#x27;s breasts leak excessively, she can wear a loose tanktop at night.

==Bras and breastfeeding==

Choosing a functional nursing bra is important to help the mother feel comfortable nursing in various circumstances. In some Western cultures, while nearly nude or nude breasts are displayed openly on beaches and in magazines and movies, there is a taboo against showing breasts in public during breastfeeding.

==History==

The first US patent for a bra was granted in 1913 to Mary Phelps Jacob. Her invention is the most widely recognized as the predecessor to the modern bra and consequently the nursing bra.

In October 1932, the S.H. Camp and Company correlated breast size and the degree they sag to letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, and D. Camp&#x27;s advertising featured letter-labeled profiles of breasts in the February 1933 issue of &quot;Corset and Underwear Review&quot;. These procedures were only designed to help women with the then-standard sizes A through D up to a size 38 band size and were not intended to be used for larger-breasted women. In 1937, Warner began to feature cup sizing in its products. Other companies like the Model and Fay-Miss (renamed in 1935 as the Bali Brassiere Company) also began to offer A, B, C and D cups in the late 1930s. Catalog companies continued to use the designations Small, Medium and Large through the 1940s. In the 1930s, Dunlop chemists were able to reliably transform rubber latex into elastic thread. Man-made fibres were quickly adopted by the industry because of their easy-care properties. Since a brassiere must be laundered frequently, this was of great importance. In 1937, Warners added cup sizes (A, B, C and D) to their product line, and other manufacturers gradually followed, but Britain did not take up the American standard until the 1950s. Maidenform introduced brassieres with seamless cups in 1933, but resisted using cup sizes for its products until 1949.

===Innovations and patents===

The first patent for a device called a &quot;nursing brassiere&quot; was obtained in 1943 by Albert A. Glasser. After World War II, the post-war baby boom stimulated a large increase in the market for nursing bras. Nursing bras saw little innovation for some time and the market was dominated by larger lingerie companies who would simply add a clip.

The nursing bra industry is very segmented. It includes traditional brassiere manufacturers such as Wonderbra. Their product is designed to accommodate the needs of women whose breast size can fluctuate up to a single cup size hourly while nursing. Another innovator is Mary Sanchez, who received a patent in 1991 for the one-handed fastening method and variable adjustment of cup size.

For women who pump their breast milk, specialized nursing bras are available that allow hands-free pumping.

<text>El Gran Orgo is the third EP by American post-hardcore band At the Drive-In. It was recorded and released in 1997 without the presence of Jim Ward, whose guitar duties were filled by Ben Rodriguez and Omar Rodriguez, the latter of whom had previously played bass on &quot;Acrobatic Tenement&quot;.

The title &quot;El Gran Orgo&quot; is taken from one of the characters of the movie &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; by Alejandro Jodorowsky. Both Omar Rodríguez-López and Cedric Bixler-Zavala are declared fans of Jodorowsky&#x27;s work.

The band intended to embark on a 100 day long tour to support the EP&#x27;s release, but release date delays and the falling out between Ben Rodriguez and the rest of the band caused the tour to end after only 2 weeks. The group, unhappy with the delays of the EP, parted ways with Offtime Records, and attempted to file a lawsuit against the label to obtain the masters. They have encouraged their fans to illegally download it in the past, stating, &quot;when you buy &quot;El Gran Orgo&quot; you do not support ATDI, you support DISHONESTY!!&quot;

<doc id="1037467" wikidata="Q434165" url="?curid=1037467" title="Howth">
<text>Howth ( ; ; ) is a peninsular village and outer suburb of Dublin, Ireland. The district as a whole occupies the greater part of the peninsula of Howth Head, which forms the northern boundary of Dublin Bay, and includes the island of Ireland&#x27;s Eye, which holds multiple natural protection designations.

Howth has been settled since prehistoric times, and features in Irish mythology. A fishing village and small trading port from at least the 14th century, Howth has grown to become a busy and affluent suburb of Dublin, with a mix of suburban residential development, wild hillside and heathland, golf courses, cliff and coastal paths, a small quarry and a busy commercial fishing port. The only neighbouring district on land is Sutton. Howth is also home to one of the oldest occupied buildings in Ireland, Howth Castle, and its estate.

Howth is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Coolock.

==Location and access==
Howth is located on the peninsula of Howth Head, which begins around east-north-east of Dublin&#x27;s GPO, on the north side of Dublin Bay. The village itself is located just over by road from Dublin city centre (the ninth of a series of eighteenth-century milestones from the Dublin General Post Office (GPO) is in the village itself). The settlement spans much of the northern part of Howth Head, which was once an island but now is connected to the rest of Dublin via a narrow strip of land (a tombolo) at Sutton. Howth is located in the administrative county of Fingal, within the traditional County Dublin. The village is bounded by the sea and undeveloped land except along two roads, one rising towards the Summit, one running at sea level near the coast, towards Sutton Cross.

Howth is at the end of a regional road (R105) from Dublin. One branch of the DART suburban rail system has its physical terminus by the harbour, the other northern terminus being Malahide&#x27;s station, which is actually on a through line for mainline rail towards Belfast. Under the bus route network for Dublin overseen by the National Transport Authority, Dublin Bus serves Howth with route H3, and the local route 290 which goes over the hill and through Sutton to Sutton DART station. For decades prior to 2021, Howth was served by the 31 series of routes. There was previously also a tram service.

Howth, in addition to its fishery harbour, hosts a substantial marina, and seasonal boat service to the uninhabited Ireland&#x27;s Eye. Howth is also a waypoint for aircraft approaching Dublin Airport.

==Etymology==
The Irish name for Howth is &quot;Binn Éadair,&quot; meaning Éadar&#x27;s Peak or Hill. In Old Irish, the name is recorded as Etar, which was first plundered by the Vikings around 819. One of the possible origins of the Irish name is from Étar, wife of one of the five Fir Bolg chieftains who is reported to have died at Howth.

The name &quot;Howth&quot; is thought to be of Norse origin, perhaps being derived from the Old Norse &quot;Hǫfuð&quot; (&quot;head&quot; in English). Norse vikings colonised the eastern shores of Ireland and built the settlement of Dyflinn (one of two settlements which became Dublin) as a strategic base between Scandinavia and the Mediterranean.

==History==

On the grounds of Howth Castle is a 3000 year old dolmen tomb known as Aideen&#x27;s Grave. According to legend it is the resting place of the mythological figure Aideen. This legend is the subject of the poem &#x27;Aideen&#x27;s Grave&#x27; by Samuel Ferguson.

In ancient history Ptolemy&#x27;s second-century map of Ireland shows Howth as an island named &quot;Edri Deserta&quot; (sometimes rendered as &quot;Edros&quot;).

===11th to 16th centuries===
After Brian Ború, the High King of Ireland, defeated the Norse in 1014, many Norse fled to Howth to regroup and remained a force until their final defeat in Fingal in the middle of the 11th century. Howth still remained under the control of Irish and localised Norse forces until the invasion of Ireland by the Anglo-Normans in 1169.

Without the support of either the Irish or Scandinavian powers, Howth was isolated and fell to the Normans in 1177. One of the victorious Normans, Armoricus (or Almeric) Tristram, was granted much of the land between the village and Sutton. According to the historian Samuel Lewis:

In 1177, Sir Amorey Tristram and Sir John de Courcy landed here at the head of a large military force, and totally defeated the Danish inhabitants in a sanguinary battle at the bridge of Evora, over a mountain stream which falls into the sea near the Baily lighthouse. This victory secured to Sir Amorey the lordship of Howth, of which his descendants have continued in possession to the present day, under the name of St. Laurence, which Almaric, third baron, assumed in fulfilment of a vow previously to his victory over the Danes near Clontarf, in a battle fought on the festival of that saint. The territory of Howth was confirmed to Almaric de St. Laurence by King John...

Tristam built his first castle overlooking the harbour and the St. Lawrence link remained until 2019 (see Earl of Howth). The original title of Baron of Howth was granted to Almeric St. Lawrence by Henry II of England in 1181, for one Knight&#x27;s fee.

Howth was a minor trading port from at least the 14th century, with both health and duty collection officials supervising from Dublin, although the harbour was not built until the early 19th century.

A popular tale concerns the clan leader and sometime pirate Gráinne O&#x27;Malley, who was rebuffed in 1576 while attempting a courtesy visit to Howth Castle, home of the Earl of Howth. In retaliation, she abducted the Earl&#x27;s grandson and heir, and as ransom, she exacted a promise that unanticipated guests would never be turned away again. She also made the Earl promise that the gates of Deer Park (the Earl&#x27;s demesne) would never be closed to the public again, and the gates are still open to this day, and an extra place is set for unexpected guests during formal dinners in the dining room.

===19th century===
In the early 19th century, Howth was chosen as the location for the harbour for the mail packet (postal service) ship. Construction began in 1807. One of the arguments used against Howth by the advocates of Dún Laoghaire was that coaches might be raided in &quot;the badlands of Sutton&quot; (at the time Sutton was open countryside). However, due to silting, the harbour needed frequent dredging to accommodate the packet and the service was relocated to Dún Laoghaire in 1809, after £350,000 had been spent on Howth. English King George IV visited the harbour in August 1821, which is remembered today by an imprint of his shoes (see left picture) carved by a local stonemason on the West Pier.

Irish poet and writer William Butler Yeats was a resident of Howth in the 19th century. There is a blue plaque dedicated to Yeats at Balscadden House on Balscadden Road which was his cottage home from 1880 to 1883. The plaque contains the couplet “I have spread my dreams under your feet/ Tread softly because you tread on my dreams” from his poem &#x27;Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven&#x27; (1899). Howth would feature in Yeats writings. The first time is the 1893 essay &#x27;Village Ghosts&#x27; recounting the paranormal folklore of the village and the second is in the poem &#x27;Beautiful Lofty Things&#x27; (1938); &quot;Maud Gonne at Howth station waiting a train&quot;.

===20th century to present===
On 26 July 1914, 900 rifles were landed at Howth by Erskine Childers for the Irish Volunteers. Many were used against the British in the Easter Rising and in the subsequent Anglo-Irish War. Among the members of the Howth branches of the Irish Volunteers and Cumann na mBan who participated in this event were the well-known writers Padraic Colum and Mary Colum. Members of both the Howth Volunteers and Baldoyle section of the Irish Citizen Army participated in the Easter Rising in Dublin city and in Fingal. A strong local branch of Sinn Féin developed in the area and there was considerable local involvement in both the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War.
The harbour was radically rebuilt by the Office of Public Works in the late 20th century (a documentary was done on the much-delayed project in 1986), with distinct fishing and leisure areas formed, and the installation of a modern ice-making facility. A new lifeboat house was later constructed, and Howth is today home to units of both the RNLI (lifeboat service) and the Irish Coastguard.

In 2019, Howth Castle and its demesne, including Ireland&#x27;s Eye, were sold to Tetrarch Investment group, with an element of the site close to the demesne gate immediately sold on again for development, to Glenveagh Properties.

==Nature==
===Natural features===
Howth Head is one of the dominant features of Dublin Bay, with a number of peaks, the highest of which is Black Linn. In one area, near Shielmartin, there is a small peat bog, the &quot;Bog of the Frogs&quot;. The wilder parts of Howth can be accessed by a network of paths (many are rights of way) and much of the centre and east is protected as part of a Special Area of Conservation of , as well as by a Special Amenity Area Order.

The peninsula has a number of small, fast-running streams, three of which run through the village, with more, including the Bloody Stream, in the adjacent Howth Demesne. The streams passing through the village are, from east to west, Coulcour Brook (falling to Balscadden Bay), Gray&#x27;s Brook or the Boggeen Stream (falling to the eastern end of the harbour), and Offington Stream (passing under Findlater&#x27;s to the western side of the harbour). Other streams are met along the cliff walks, including the Whitewater Brook, with a tributary in a sunken area of plants and ponds, and then the Balsaggart Stream.
The island of Ireland&#x27;s Eye, part of the Special Area of Conservation, lies about a kilometre north of Howth harbour, with Lambay Island some 5 km further to the north. A Martello tower exists on each of these islands with another tower overlooking Howth harbour (opened as a visitor centre and Ye Olde Hurdy Gurdy Museum of Vintage Radio on 8 June 2001) and another tower at Red Rock, Sutton. These are part of a series of towers built around the coast of Ireland during the 19th century.
===Special amenity area order (SAAO)===
More than half of Howth Head, and of the Howth area, totalling around 1,500 acres, is subject to a Special Amenity Area Order, a provision of Irish law designed to protect areas of natural beauty or biodiversity. Prepared by the local authority, after a consultative process under a community environmental process known as SEMPA, and formally proposed by Brendan Howlin as a minister, the order was developed in cooperation with a unit of Trinity College Dublin. It was made in 1999, confirmed in 2000, and is subject to 5-yearly reviews, the most recent having been conducted in 2015. At the time of its making the majority of the lands covered formed part of the Howth Estate, with the other significant landowners being developers Treasury Holdings (85 hectares) and Gerry Gannon (33 hectares), and Howth Golf Club (48 hectares). The Council stated that the order was needed to protect the environment of the designated area by restricting development there, while recognising the need &quot;to encourage tourism-related developments in the remainder of Howth&quot;.

The SAAO area runs from the vicinity of Bottle Quay northeast to Muck Rock, east to the reservoir at Balkill, east and south around the Loughoreen Hills and Black Linn, then to the Summit, turning north along the line of the Coulcour Brook, then taking in a narrow part of Howth village, including the Martello Tower and East Pier, and Ireland&#x27;s Eye. It also covers a network of over 20 km of designated footpaths and rights of way, and it was stated that &quot;all existing scenic views and prospects from the entire length of public footpaths and roads in the area are to be protected&quot;.

Fingal County Council explained the need for the order, noting that between the 1940s and the present day &quot;Howth has been transformed from a rural area to a suburban extension of Dublin city&quot; and that its natural or &quot;semi-natural&quot; areas had shrunk from over 70% to around 40% of land area, while highly developed areas had risen from 14% to 30%.

===Flora and fauna===
As a semi-isolated area, Howth&#x27;s flora and fauna have been studied in some detail, and a &quot;Flora of Howth&quot;, for example, was issued in 1887.

==Built heritage==
Howth Castle, and its estate, at least part of which is known as Deer Park, are key features of the area. Corr Castle also previously formed part of the estate.

===Aideen&#x27;s Grave===
On the grounds of Howth Castle lies a collapsed megalithic dolmen (portal tomb), known locally as Aideen&#x27;s Grave.

===Bailey Lighthouse===

At the southeast corner of Howth Head, in the area known as Bail(e)y (historically, the Green Bayley) is the automated Baily Lighthouse, successor to previous aids to navigation, at least as far back as the late 17th century. This is the subject of a picture, &quot;Howth Lighthouse, from the Needles&quot;, by George Petrie, which appears in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1835, with an attached poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. At the end of the East Pier of Howth Harbour are the Howth Harbour Lighthouse, built in the 19th century and no longer in service, and the pole-mounted light which replaced it.
===St. Mary&#x27;s Church===

In Howth village are St. Mary&#x27;s Church and its graveyard, overlooking the harbour. The earliest church on this site was built by Sitric, King of Dublin, in 1042. It was replaced around 1235 by a parish church, when that function was moved from the church on Ireland&#x27;s Eye, and then, in the second, half of the 14th century, the present church was built. The building was modified in the 15th and 16th centuries, when the gables were raised, a bell cote was built and a new porch and south door were added. The St. Lawrence family, of nearby Howth Castle, also modified the east end to act as a private chapel; inside is the tomb of Christopher St Lawrence, 2nd Baron Howth, who died in 1462, and his wife, Anna Plunkett of Ratoath.

===The College===
Also of historic interest is a building known as &quot;The College&quot; or &quot;The Old College&quot;, on Abbey Street which was primarily constructed in the late 15th or early 16th century but also with earlier medieval elements.

===Other structures===

Drumleck Castle on a promontory in the Censure area of Howth was formerly on the Record of Protected Structures but removed as there were no structural elements remaining above ground to warrant retention. Alternative protection remains under the National Monuments Acts 1930–2004, as a Record Monument RMP Ref No. DU019-007.

==Amenities and businesses==
Howth remains an active centre of the fishing industry, one of Ireland&#x27;s &quot;tier 2&quot; fishing ports, with some processing performed in the fishing harbour area, and some boat maintenance. There is a State Fisheries Centre, including an ice-making plant, and a dry dock.

The area is active commercially, with a range of retail and leisure outlets, including multiple restaurants, two convenience stores and a post office, although the nearest supermarket is at Sutton Cross and the nearest service stations are in Baldoyle and Bayside.

Howth, having once held at least seven hotels, four still as of 1990, saw the last, the Deer Park Hotel, on the Howth Estate, close in April 2014, although the premises continued to trade as a bar, and base for the Deer Park golf courses and a &#x27;FootGolf&#x27; course, and later housed refugees. The area has multiple bed-and-breakfast establishments, and Airbnb hosts. The nearest operational hotel, The Marine Hotel (formerly the Golfers Hotel and the Strand Hotel), is located at Sutton Cross, approximately 2.5 km from Howth harbour. Other hotels that have closed include The Howth Lodge Hotel (formerly the Claremont Hotel), The Baily Court Hotel (formerly The Royal Hotel), The Saint Lawrence Hotel, Sutton Castle Hotel (part of its grounds were located in a remote part of Howth), the Waverley Hotel on Kitestown Road (burned down in the 1960s) and the Asgard Hotel (formerly The Dalriada Hotel) on Balscadden Bay. The Asgard hotel was famously owned by Phil Lynott and operated by his mother Philomena Lynott when it burned down in 1982, later being replaced by apartments.

==Recreation==
Large numbers of tourists visit Howth annually in order to avail of the views from the summit, to walk the piers, and to taste locally sourced seafood.
Howth is a common area for birdwatching and sailing, and is also popular with anglers. Fish like cod and ray can be caught from Howth&#x27;s rocky shore marks. Sea mammals, such as seals, are common sights in and near the harbour. It used to be popular to feed the seals but authorities banned the practice for a variety of reasons. Birds seen regularly include razorbill, guillemot, fulmar, kittiwake, cormorant, stonechat, linnet, whitethroat, yellowhammer, skylark, wheatear, swallow, house martin, peregrine, buzzard and kestrel.

Howth is also a destination for cyclists, joggers and hill-walkers alike, particularly on weekends. One attraction is the six-kilometre long Cliff Path Loop. The loop walk takes about two hours to complete, is rated with an easy to moderate difficulty, and begins and ends at the Howth DART [Railway] Station. Another common walk is the original Cliff Walk to Red Rock in Sutton.

==Administration and representation==
Howth was within County Dublin from the introduction of the shire structure by the Normans, and within North Dublin rural district from its creation under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. In 1918, Howth became a separate urban district with the consent of the Local Government Board for Ireland and despite the opposition of North Dublin rural district council. In 1942, it was transferred to Dublin county borough, with Dublin Corporation superseding the urban district council. In 1985, it was removed from the city and reassigned to the county. In 1994, it was in the area that became Fingal, the successor north of the River Liffey to County Dublin. At the 2019 Irish local elections, the Howth–Malahide local electoral area elected 7 councillors to Fingal County Council.

Howth is in the Dáil constituency of Dublin Bay North and the European Parliament constituency of Dublin.

==Popular culture==
Howth has been a filming location for movies such as &quot;The Last of the High Kings&quot;, &quot;Boy Eats Girl&quot;, &quot;Love, Rosie&quot; and &quot;Sing Street&quot;.

<text>Jean-Jacques Pierre (born 23 January 1981) is a Haitian football coach and former professional footballer who played as a centre-back. He is the former head coach of the Haiti national team.

==Club career==
Born in Léogâne, Pierre began his career in the youth ranks of Haitian club Cavaly. After impressing with the island club, Pierre moved to Argentina, joining Arsenal de Sarandí. After one season with Arsenal, Pierre joined Deportivo Morón and went on to score seven goals as a defender. His play with Morón earned him a move to historic Uruguayan side Peñarol. While with Peñarol, Pierre was a regular starter for the club and also featured during the Copa Libertadores. He was voted as the best defender of the Uruguayan championship in 2004–05.

In August 2005, he joined French club Nantes. Upon joining Nantes, Pierre quickly became a first team regular. He made his debut for Nantes on 10 September 2005 in a 1–0 loss to Troyes AC. In six seasons in France, he appeared in 143 league matches (including 68 Ligue 1 matches) and scored 4 goals.

==International career==
Pierre was the captain of the Haiti national under-23 football team and emerged as an important player for the full national squad. He made his full national team debut in a December 2001 friendly match against El Salvador and was a Haiti squad member at the 2002 and 2007 Gold Cups. He played in two World Cup qualifying matches in 2004. According to the Haitian press, on 25 March 2009, Pierre announced his retirement from the national side, citing false accusations against him and that he was not as much valued in the national team as he was with Nantes. However, he returned to the national team and participated in 2010 World Cup qualifying.

<doc id="1037471" wikidata="Q1798906" url="?curid=1037471" title="Lucan, Dublin">
<text>Lucan ( ; ) is a suburban village to the west of Dublin, Ireland, located 12 km from Dublin city centre, on the River Liffey. It is near the Strawberry Beds and Lucan Weir, and at the confluence of the River Griffeen. It is mostly in the local government area of South Dublin, with the exception of the North Lucan areas of Laraghcon, Coldblow and Saint Catherine&#x27;s Park, which are in Fingal. Lucan is in a townland and civil parish of the same name, in the barony of Newcastle. Road access to Lucan is from the N4, and the M50 motorway at Junction 7.

==Etymology==
In the Irish language, refers to the marsh-mallow plant, used up to modern times in folk medicine (for sprains and chest infections) and sweet manufacture, and so the name could be rendered as &quot;place of marsh-mallow plants&quot; or &quot;land abounding in marsh-mallows.&quot; The plant grows in the Liffey Valley and surrounds, as recorded in the 1837 , reported by Jackson (1914). In 1615, the area was described as &#x27;a marshy place&#x27;... The alternative meaning is derived from the Irish for elm, leamhán, and has been more popularised, although both definitions could be equally valid, with both mallows and elms still growing in the Lucan area, and etymological experts unable to definitively choose one meaning over the other, as is evidenced on logainm.ie.

==History==
===Early history===
Evidence of prehistoric settlement in the Lucan area includes sites in the Cooldrinagh townland of Lucan, with early Mesolithic flints found in significant quantities, as well as the remains of two small kerbed passage tombs. In the area around Vesey Park, there are remains of a hillfort (Knockanardousk &quot;hill of the high water&quot;) that may have been the house and enclosure of an early lord of Lucan in medieval times. This enclosure also contained a souterrain, excavated in the 18th century by George Petrie and of which, some of the finds are in the National Museum of Ireland. Another notable archaeological site is St Finian&#x27;s Esker church and graveyard, which is listed by both the National Monuments Service and the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage. There are two other medieval churches in Lucan also; the Church of the Blessed Virgin, Lucan village (an enclosed gated graveyard &amp; medieval church site with attached chantry or tower house, and the medieval parish church of Aderrig, Lucan, off Tubber Lane.

===Sarsfields and Veseys===
When Oliver Cromwell came to Ireland, Lucan was a village of 120 inhabitants.

In 1566, Sir William Sarsfield acquired Lucan Manor, and the property became closely associated with the Sarsfield family. Patrick Sarsfield, the Irish Jacobite leader, was born in the castle that had occupied the manor grounds and was granted the title Earl of Lucan by James II.

Lucan House was built on the site of Sarsfield&#x27;s castle in 1772, by the Rt Hon. Agmondisham Vesey, who was descended from the Sarsfield family. The circular ground floor dining room is said to have been an inspiration for the Oval Office of the White House. The decorative plasterwork was carried out by Michael Stapleton. Over the years, the house passed out of the Vesey family and, from 1942 until 2024, was the residence of the Italian ambassador to Ireland.

===Developments===
The discovery of a sulphurous spa in Lucan in 1758 brought the district into prominence, and it became a destination for weekend parties from Dublin and the surrounding countryside. Several developments followed in the vicinity, and by 1795 a ballroom and a later hotel had been erected. Many of the structures in Lucan village were constructed as part of a large redevelopment around 1815. Later, Lucan was a terminus on the combination of tram lines serving Lucan and Leixlip from Dublin city centre.

Described by Weston St. John Joyce in 1912 as a &quot;pretty town&quot;, as of the early 21st century, Lucan&#x27;s village core &quot;remained largely intact&quot;. Between 1971 and 1976, Lucan&#x27;s population increased from 4,245 to 12,451. By the time of the 2006 census it had a population of approximately 37,300. This growth was precipitated by development of housing estates in the surrounding area with a study, undertaken in the early 21st century, noting a disconnect between Lucan village and some of the surrounding housing developments.

==Transport and access==
Lucan village is located north of the N4/M4 national primary route to the west and northwest of Ireland. The village is approximately west of the M50 Dublin ring road. An outer-orbital distributor called the Outer Ring Road, designated as R136, from the N4 (Woodies) interchange to the N81 Tallaght Bypass, was completed in 2008.

As the first non-toll bridge located to the west of the paid West-Link toll bridge, Lucan Bridge and the roads approaching it witness a large volume of traffic on a daily basis as north and south-bound motorists use it as a rat run to save money. Speaking of the impact this has had on the local community, Fianna Fáil local election candidate Caitríona McClean was quoted as saying &quot;The people of Lucan not only have to deal with the excessive traffic and the inconvenience this has on their daily lives but it also impacts the local environment given the dirt it creates, the air pollution and the noise. Old Rectory and Sarsfield Park residents are particularly impacted [...] with cars bumper to bumper blocking the entrance and exit to their estates during rush hours in particular&quot;.

Lucan is located between two major national/commuter railway lines. The original Lucan North (Leixlip) Station on the north/northwest line, and Lucan South station on the south/southwest line, were closed in 1941 and 1947, respectively. The greenfield development of the Lucan townlands as a major residential area was predicated on the location between the motorways and railways. Adamstown railway station re-opened in 2007 to serve the Adamstown area; it is located south of Finnstown, Lucan.
Dublin Bus provides several bus services to the area. Feeder routes, such as the L52, run through Lucan from Adamstown station to Blanchardstown. Some independent bus operators also serve Lucan.

Weston Airport is located to the west of Lucan near the Dublin/Kildare border. This facility conducts pilot training and serves privately-owned light aircraft and helicopters.

==Features==
===King John&#x27;s Bridge===
King John&#x27;s Bridge in Griffeen Park is reputed to be the oldest surviving bridge in Ireland, having apparently been constructed sometime during the reign of John, King of England from 1199 to 1216. Originally composed of three arches, only one arch survives today - and it is in a ruinous state. The bridge is situated in quiet parkland and crosses the narrow Griffeen River; it is sited close to the ruins of Old Esker Church. Postcards were printed of the bridge in the 1930s such was its notability. South Dublin County Council have proposed €20,000 be made available to carry out conservation work on the bridge to make it a more prominent historical landmark.

===Lucan House===

Lucan House is a seven-bay two-storey over basement Palladian country villa. Agmonisham Vesey cleared the previous residence and began construction in 1772. The architecture is the work of Vesey and William Chambers, with Michael Stapleton responsible for the plasterwork. The estate passed through the Sarsfield, Vesey and Colthurst families through marriage and also was once the residence of Charles Hugh O&#x27;Conor, the third son of Charles Owen O&#x27;Conor and then, in 1954, it was purchased by the Italian Government for use as the residence of the Italian Ambassador to Ireland. The remainder of the estate land is now Liffey Valley Park.

===Ruined medieval church ===
Another notable feature is St Finian&#x27;s medieval church and graveyard at Esker.

==Amenities==
The Griffeen Valley Park runs along the Griffeen River, with some smaller outlying park areas among housing developments to the west. The main area of the park is split by the Lucan bypass, with Vesey Park on one side and Griffeen Park on the other. A feature of the park is the old woodland in Vesey Park that was retained when the park was formed. This woodland is most extensive along the Griffeen River and contains mature deciduous and coniferous trees. An area of the park, along the river, contains a wet woodland with extensive fern and bryophyte growth. The woodland also provides a habitat for the protected species .

Lucan Library is part of a network of libraries in South Dublin.

==Education==

Lucan has a number of schools. St. Mary&#x27;s Boys National School (BNS) is the oldest school which dates back to 1833.

==Media==
Lucan has a free magazine, &quot;The Link&quot;, that contains items of local interest. The &quot;Lucan Newsletter&quot;, used by local organizations to report on activities and meetings, was first published in 1967 and is produced and published weekly by volunteers. Local newspapers include the &quot;Liffey Champion&quot; (a weekly newspaper for the Lucan area of South Dublin and North Kildare), &quot;The Echo&quot; (published in Lucan as the &quot;Lucan Echo&quot;), and the &quot;Lucan Gazette&quot;.

Liffey Sound Communications Co-operative Society Limited, a not-for-profit organisation, runs Liffey Sound FM, the local community radio station. Liffey Sound FM is another local media source run entirely by volunteers. The station has been broadcasting since July 2006.

==Economy==
In terms of retail, the main street contains the newsagent Centra, bookmakers, boutiques, banks, charity shops, IT shops and cafés. The Lucan Shopping Centre includes SuperValu, Dunnes Store, Peter Mark, and McDonald&#x27;s, along with a Community Library.

The area is primarily a residential one, but employers in the area include the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, Citywest and Tallaght in southwest Dublin, Intel in Leixlip, County Kildare, and eBay&#x27;s European operation in Blanchardstown.

== Local organisations and charities ==

Pieta House is a charity which provides assistance to people experiencing depression and suicidal thoughts. It first opened, in Lucan, in 2006.

Lucan Disability Action Group was established, in October 2000, to address the needs of people with disabilities in the Lucan area.

==Sport==

Lucan has three Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) teams. Lucan Sarsfields, the largest sports organisation in the town, was founded in 1886. Its grounds are located on the 12th Lock on the Grand Canal. Lucan Sarsfields were runners up on the 2013 Dublin Senior Hurling Championship final. Club members have included the former Dublin hurling captain Johnny McCaffrey.

Westmanstown Gaels are also located in north Lucan at the Westmanstown Sports Centre, which has diversified from its roots as a leisure centre for the Garda Síochána.

An Irish-language GAA club, Na Gaeil Óga CLG, started their juvenile structure in the area in September 2014 and is based in Gaelscoileanna and a Gaelcholáiste in the area, Gaelscoil Naomh Pádraig, Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada and Coláiste Cois Life.

<doc id="1037473" wikidata="Q1092238" url="?curid=1037473" title="Vaya (EP)">
<text>Vaya is the fourth EP by American post-hardcore band At the Drive-In, released in 1999.

==Writing==
&quot;198d&quot; was written about drummer Tony Hajjar&#x27;s grandmother, who was buried in a mass grave in Lebanon. The title was taken from an inscription on her gravestone. 

The sound of the album bridges the musical gap between &quot;In/Casino/Out&quot; and their following album, &quot;Relationship of Command&quot;.

==Artwork==
The EP&#x27;s cover features a Conion 100CF boombox which belonged to the band, and was used as a frequent prop during &quot;Vaya&quot; period, appearing in their photoshoots, gig flyers and on stage during most of their live performances. Additionally, it would appear in the music video for &quot;Metronome Arthritis&quot; and was later featured on the label of their 2000 split 7-inch with The Murder City Devils as well as the cover of the 2005 compilation album &quot;This Station Is Non-Operational&quot;.

==Release==
The EP was first released in 1999 by Fearless Records. To promote it, the band toured with Rage Against the Machine and the Foo Fighters in November and December 1999. It saw a limited of 500 vinyl release at 2012&#x27;s Coachella Music Festival to celebrate the band&#x27;s first performances together in 11 years. The 10-inch was then re-released as a hot-pink vinyl on June 5, 2012, with 1,500 copies in North American and 1,500 copies elsewhere. A vibrant red edition of 1,000 of the 10-inch was also available from Hot Topic stores.

<text>Mulhuddart () is an outer suburb situated 12 km (7.456 miles) north-west of Dublin, Ireland. The River Tolka passes near the village.

Mulhuddart is also a civil parish in the barony of Castleknock in the traditional County Dublin.

==History==

===Placenames===

The origins and meaning of the name Mulhuddart are unknown. However a number of explanations are offered, the most likely being that the name came from the Irish &quot;Mullach Eadartha&quot; meaning &quot;the hill of the milking place&quot;. In ancient Ireland, cows were driven out onto upland pastures during the summer months and special places were designated for their milking.

Many townland names surrounding the village owe their origins to Norman settlers who colonised the area after the Norman capture of Dublin in 1170. &quot;Buzzardstown&quot; is so-called after the family of William Bossard and &quot;Tyrrellstown&quot; is named after a branch of the Tyrrells, who were created barons of Castleknock in 1173.

The townland of Goddamendy is perhaps the only townland in Ireland containing a prayer in its name. Tradition has it that when a priest arrived late for the anointing of a dying man, the dead man&#x27;s relative cursed the priest, who replied &quot;May God amend thee!&quot;

===Built heritage===

There are a number of antiquities and old houses in the area. These include the ruins of the Church of Mary, Our Lady&#x27;s Well which was used widely by pilgrims back in the early century, Mulhuddart National School and Parlickstown House. The Ordnance Survey of Ireland Sheet 50 map also shows a graveyard and burial ground at Cloghran.

Muluddart Church, the Church of Mary, stands above the village on a hill. The church stands on a curved mound, suggesting it was built on the site of an earlier church which was protected by an enclosure. The current ruins post-date the Anglo-Norman settlement of the area.

=== 1916 Easter Rising centenary monument ===

In May 2016, a centenary monument was unveiled at the main junction of Mulhuddart, to commemorate the executed leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising. As well as including the names of the executed leaders, the monument is inscribed with the 1916 Proclamation on the front. On the back, it is inscribed with the Democratic Programme adopted by the First Dáil. The memorial was funded entirely by donations from the local community at the cost of €14,000.

==Location and access==
The N3 dual carriageway now bypasses the village. It is located near Blanchardstown, now one of the largest suburbs of Dublin. It is bordered by County Meath to the west and by the civil parishes of Ward to the north, Finglas to the east and Clonsilla to the south.

Mulhuddart village essentially comprises a main street, which was the old Navan Road, on which there is a petrol station, a few shops and cafés. Though the village has been bypassed, an underpass connects the main street to Blakestown. Mulhuddart includes the suburban localities of Ladyswell, and Manorfield, together with townlands such as Priesttown. Newer estates to the west of the village such as Swallowbrook and Pheasant&#x27;s Run are within the townland of Mulhuddart.

Located on the outskirts of the village is the Damastown Industrial Estate, one of Dublin&#x27;s largest industrial estates which includes a large IBM campus employing over 4,000 people. To the north is the village of Tyrrelstown, with a sizable modern housing development.

Public transport in Mulhuddart is provided by Dublin Bus routes 38, 38a, 38b, 39n and 220.

==Education==
Primary schools in the area include St Patrick&#x27;s National School (boys and girls, Roman Catholic, in the parish of Corduff), and &quot;Scoil An Cheathair Alainn&quot; (boys and girls, also Roman Catholic, located in Mulhuddart).

==Administration and politics==
Mulhuddart is administered by Fingal County Council. For elections to Dáil Éireann, it is in the Dublin West constituency. It is in the European Parliament constituency of Dublin.

==Religion==
Mulhuddart is a parish in the Blanchardstown deanery of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin.

<text>The Royal Albert Dock is a complex of dock buildings and warehouses in Liverpool, England. Designed by Jesse Hartley and Philip Hardwick, it was opened in 1846, and was the first structure in Britain to be built from cast iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood. As a result, it was the first non-combustible warehouse system in the world. It was known simply as the Albert Dock until 2018, when it was granted a royal charter and had the honorific &quot;Royal&quot; added to its name.

At the time of its construction the dock was considered to be revolutionary in its design because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from or to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world&#x27;s first hydraulic cranes. Due to its open yet secure design, the dock became a popular store for valuable cargoes such as brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. However, despite its advanced design, the rapid development of shipping technology meant that, within 50 years, larger and more open docks were required, although the Albert Dock remained a valuable store for cargo.

During the Second World War, the dock was requisitioned by the Admiralty serving as a base for ships of the British Atlantic Fleet. The complex was damaged during air raids on Liverpool, notably during the May Blitz of 1941. In the aftermath of the war, the financial problems of the owners and the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock was uncertain. Numerous plans were developed for the re-use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed. Having lain derelict for nearly ten years, the redevelopment of the dock began in 1981, when the Merseyside Development Corporation was set up, with the Albert Dock being officially re-opened in 1984.

Today the Royal Albert Dock is a major tourist attraction in the city and the most visited multi-use attraction in the United Kingdom, outside London. The five warehouses which make up the complex cover 1.25m sq ft in size, the biggest such group of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in the UK.

==History==
===Grand beginnings and early history===
The history of the Albert Dock dates back to 1837, when Jesse Hartley first began the development of plans for a combined dock and warehouse system. The plans drawn up by Hartley and fellow civil engineer Philip Hardwick for the Albert Dock were at the time considered quite &#x27;radical&#x27;, as they envisioned the loading and unloading of ships directly from the warehouses. However, this idea was not new, and as far back as the 1803 Warehousing Act, legislation had been passed to allow this form of development to occur, whilst the concept was first actually used in the construction of St Katharine&#x27;s Dock in London, which was opened in 1828. As part of the development process, Hartley was eager to test the fire resistance of any particular design by constructing an by dummy structure, filling it with timber and tar, and setting it alight. After testing several structural designs he settled on the combination of cast iron, brick, sandstone and granite. The design was submitted for planning permission in 1839 although it was not until 1841, when the bill authorising the design of the dock was eventually passed by Parliament, that construction was allowed to begin.

The site chosen for the dock to be built on was an area of land bordered by Salthouse Dock to the east, the entrance channel to Canning Dock to the north and by Duke&#x27;s Dock to the south. The land earmarked for the site had to be cleared, with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a pub, several houses and the Dock Trustee&#x27;s Dockyard. Upon the clearance of this land both the Salthouse and Canning docks were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert Dock to be constructed, whilst hundreds of &quot;navvies&quot; were employed to dig out the dock basin and construct the new river wall. The dock basin was completed by February 1845, allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock, although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to allow these boats to &quot;lay-up&quot;.

The dock complex was officially opened in 1846 by Albert, Prince Consort, husband of Queen Victoria and the man in honour of whom it was named. This event marked the first occasion in Liverpool&#x27;s history in which a member of the Royal Family had made a state visit to the city and as a result the occasion was marked with a major celebrations. Many thousands of people turned out for the Royal visit with the newspaper &quot;The Pictorial Times&quot; noting the reception Prince Albert received:

His reception was most enthusiastic; balconies were erected along the line of procession, and these and the windows of houses were filled with gay and animated parties. There was a most brilliant display of flags, banners &amp; c. [sic]. All business is suspended. There are 200,000 strangers in town, and all the inhabitants are in the streets. All is gaiety and splendour. (&quot;The Pictorial Times&quot;, 1846).

The Prince was taken on a processional tour through the city, including a visit to the town hall where the royal address was made, before departing aboard the ferry across to the Cheshire side of the Mersey and then northwards towards the Albert Dock. Again this stage of the procession route was laden with onlookers with &quot;The Pictorial Times&quot; describing the Prince&#x27;s entrance into the Albert Dock:

From the Cheshire side of the river the Fairy crossed to the Liverpool side, and returned along the line of docks amidst the cheers of assembled thousands and the roar of artillery. The sight was really magnificent, all the ships in the docks were decked out in gayest colours and the river was crowded with boats filled with people. At half-past two the fairy entered the dock, where were assembled two thousand ladies and gentlemen, the elite of the town; they cheered enthusiastically, which his Royal Highness returned, and in order to gratify the crowd sailed round the dock. (&quot;The Pictorial Times&quot;, 1846).

Despite the official opening taking place in 1846, the construction of the Albert Dock was not fully completed until 1847. In 1848, a new dock office was built and the dock itself was upgraded to feature a hydraulic cargo handling hoist system, the first of its kind in the world. Over the next decade several more buildings were added including houses for the piermaster, his assistant, and the warehouse superintendent; and a cooperage. Warehousing in the dock was also expanded to meet the increasing demand by joining together the eastern and western ends of the Southern Stack.

===Changing fortunes and role in the Second World War===
The enclosed design of the Albert Dock and the direct loading and unloading of goods from warehouses, meant that the complex was more secure than other docks within Liverpool. As a result, it became a popular store for valuable cargoes including brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory, and sugar. Their openness to natural light and well ventilated stores, meant natural goods such as hemp or sugar could be kept fresher longer. The dock came to dominate Liverpool&#x27;s far eastern trade, with over 90% of the city&#x27;s silk imports from China coming through it and more generally half of all the far eastern trade income.

Despite the great prosperity the dock afforded the city, within 20 years of its construction the Albert Dock was beginning to struggle. Designed and constructed to handle sailing ships of up to 1,000 tonnes, by the start of the 20th century only 7% of ships into the Port of Liverpool were sailing vessels. The development of steam ships in the later 19th century meant that soon the dock simply was not large enough, as its narrow entrances prevented larger vessels from entering it. Its lack of quayside was also becoming an issue. Generally steamships could be loaded and unloaded far quicker than sailing ships, and in a cruel twist of irony, the dockside warehouses that had once made the Albert Dock so attractive, were now hindering its future development. Nonetheless the Albert Dock remained an integral part of the dock system in Liverpool, and in 1878 the pump house was built as part of redevelopment that saw the majority of the cranes converted to hydraulic use. In 1899, part of the north stack was converted to allow for ice production and cold storage.

By the 1920s, virtually all commercial shipping activity had ceased at the dock, although its warehouses did remain in use for the storage of goods transported by barge, road or rail. The onset of the Second World War, in 1939, saw the Albert Dock requisitioned by the Admiralty and used as base for the British Atlantic fleet. This included submarines, small warships, and landing craft docking. During the war, the dock was struck on several occasions by German bombs. This included one bombing raid in 1940 that damaged ships within the dock. More destructively, during the May Blitz of 1941, bombing caused extensive damage to the south west stack. By the end of the war, almost 15 per cent of the dock&#x27;s floor space was unavailable due to bomb damage.

===Post War history and decline===

By the time the Second World War had finished the Albert Dock&#x27;s future looked bleak. The owners of the dock, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB), were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting an attitude of &quot;if it&#x27;s not broke don&#x27;t fix it, and if it is broke we still won&#x27;t fix it&quot;. At the same time a change in geopolitical orientation towards Europe, coupled with the advent of containerisation, meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the UK. Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I listed building status.

Despite this recognition, the increasing debts of the MDHB meant that by the 1960s the company was eager to get rid of the Albert Dock. Having considered demolishing the buildings and redeveloping the land, the MDHB soon entered negotiations to sell the land to Oldham Estates, a property developer owned by Harry Hyams. Many plans for the site were developed including one that envisioned the development of a mini city that would provide 10m sq feet of letting space, hotels, restaurants, bars and underground parking in the drained dock basin. With the council reluctant to allow such a &quot;grandiose&quot; development to occur and with the huge public opposition to it (inspired at least in part by the work of Quentin Hughes), Oldham Estates were forced into scaling-down the plan and so in 1970 returned with a new vision known as &quot;Aquarius City&quot;, which had as its centrepiece a 44-storey skyscraper. Once again the plan failed to develop and no sooner had it been announced, than the MDHB&#x27;s financial problems reached crisis point, Oldham Estates withdrew their deposit and the whole scheme fell through.

With the MDHB on the verge of bankruptcy a decision was taken to shut down and sell off the whole of the south docks system. The warehouses were emptied and in 1972 the Albert Dock finally closed down. The Brunswick Dock gates, which separated the South Docks system from the River Mersey, were opened allowing tidal movements in and the process of the clogging up the docks with sewage polluted silt began. In many senses just as the Albert Dock&#x27;s development had symbolised the prosperity in the Liverpool at the time of its construction, its subsequent decline after the Second World War symbolised the collapse of the local economy as a whole.

Throughout the early 1970s plans continued to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock site and the whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council&#x27;s suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now Liverpool John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.

The creation of Merseyside County Council (MCC) in 1974 brought new hope that the Albert Dock could be redeveloped, with the MCC placing a high priority on its development. They soon entered negotiations with the MDHC and in 1979 eventually negotiated a deal to take over the running of the south docks. Despite this seeming step forward political wrangling between the MDHC (the dock owners), Liverpool City Council (the local planning authority) and Merseyside County Council (the group now responsible for redeveloping the docks) continued to hinder any development plans. Fed up with the infighting the newly elected Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher decided that the city was incapable of handling regeneration initiatives itself and under the guidance of the &#x27;Minister for Merseyside&#x27; Michael Heseltine, set up the Merseyside Development Corporation in 1981 to take over the responsibility of regenerating and redeveloping Liverpool&#x27;s south docks.

===The MDC and regeneration of the Albert Dock===

The creation of the Merseyside Development Corporation (MDC) in 1981 was part of a new initiative launched by the then Conservative government that earmarked the regeneration of some of Liverpool&#x27;s south docks, by using public sector investment to create infrastructure within an area that could then in turn be used to attract private sector investment. Thus the MDC was not directly responsible for regeneration programmes but rather acted as a spearhead, guiding the development process. Upon its formation it immediately created an initial strategy for the area placing a high priority on restoring those buildings that could be restored &amp; demolishing the rest, restoring a water regime within the dock system (including the removal of up to of silt) and general environmental landscaping. As part of the strategy two flagship schemes were set up: the redevelopment of a site in Otterspool for the International Garden Festival and the regeneration of the Albert Dock.

In 1982 the MDC entered into negotiations with London-based developers Arrowcroft in order to secure much needed private sector investment. On a visit to the site, Arrowcroft&#x27;s chairman Leonard Eppel spoke of how the buildings &quot;talked to him&quot; and upon his return to London set about persuading the company&#x27;s board to take on the project. In September 1983 a deal was signed between Arrowcroft plc and the MDC leading to the creation of the Albert Dock Company, which could now start the process of regenerating the Albert Dock.

One of the first priorities of the regeneration was the restoration of the dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced &amp; bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac Construction to renovate the dock&#x27;s vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley&#x27;s design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.
Development within the Albert Dock was rapid and the newly renovated Edward Pavilion (formerly north east stack) was ready in time for the 1984 Cutty Sark Tall Ships&#x27; Races. The race was a big success for the city with over one million visitors into Liverpool over a period of four days, of which 160,000 visited the Albert Dock. In total it is estimated that the two flagship regeneration schemes of the MDC, the tall ships race and International Garden Festival, attracted over 3.5 million visitors to Liverpool in 1984. The same year, the renovation of the dock traffic office was completed; it was fitted out and leased to Granada Television.

Spurred by the success of the tall ships race and the International Garden Festival, Arrowcroft pushed on with the Albert Dock&#x27;s renovation. With the Edward Pavilion refurbishment a success soon the company started on the Britannia and Atlantic pavilions (formerly the south and south east stacks), the latter of which required major structural repairs because of bomb damage it received during World War II. In 1986 the Merseyside Maritime Museum completed its move into the Albert Dock, having moved some exhibitions into the building in 1984. The museum, developed by Merseyside County Council had previously been located in the pilotage building and a salvage shed nearby. 1986 also saw work begin on the largest of the dock warehouses, the Colonnades (formerly west stack). Ground floor shops were created with office space on the mezzanine level and apartments on the remaining floors. The first 37 of these apartments were completed by 1988 and the speed with which they sold was likened to &#x27;sales day at Harrods&#x27;.

The Albert Dock was officially re-opened in 1988 by The Prince of Wales, the great-great-great-grandson of Prince Albert, the man who had originally opened the docks. It was timed to coincide with the opening of the newly finished Tate Liverpool, which was dubbed the &#x27;Tate of the north&#x27; and at the time the only one outside London. The decision to locate a Tate gallery in Liverpool was seen as a major success for the city, as it made Liverpool home to the National Collection of modern art in the North of England.

In 1988, ITV&#x27;s new morning television show &quot;This Morning&quot;, hosted by Richard and Judy, began broadcasting from a studio inside the Albert Dock. As part of the show, weather presenter Fred Talbot used a floating map of the British Isles to report the forecast. Two years later, in 1990, The Beatles Story museum opened, the only Beatles-themed visitor attraction in Britain, providing yet another draw to the Albert Dock.

Throughout the 1990s development continued including a new hotel and the conversion of vacant space for use by larger companies such as Telewest (Now Virgin Media). Finally in 2003, some 22 years after the renovation of the Albert Dock started, the last remaining undeveloped space was brought into use with the opening of a new Premier Lodge hotel in the Britannia Pavilion.

In anticipation of the dock&#x27;s 175th anniversary in 2021, the owners of the dock applied for a royal charter. At an event at Tate Liverpool on 6 June 2018 the royal charter was handed over. The dock became formally known as Royal Albert Dock Liverpool, to avoid confusion with the Royal Albert Dock in London.

==Structural design and construction==

When it was constructed the Royal Albert Dock was considered a state of the art docking system. Built almost entirely from cast iron, stone and brick, the Albert Dock was designed to be fireproof, and on completion was the world&#x27;s first non-combustible warehouse system. It provided of warehouse space and its dock basin had a water area of . In its construction over 23 million bricks were used and 47,000 tonnes of mortar. In total it cost £782,265 (approximately £41m today), whilst today its estimated to be worth £230 million.

The building&#x27;s design complements many existing construction techniques with, what were considered at the time, radical solutions. The warehouses are supported by large load-bearing walls that range from being thick at the base to on the fourth level. One of the most advanced architectural features is the use of stressed skin roofing, which at the time of construction was virtually unheard of. Huge iron trusses are crossed with rivetted and galvanised wrought iron plates, creating a shape similar to an upturned boat hull that acts to support the roof above. The floors in the warehouses are supported by large iron columns and the spaces between were considered &#x27;highly flexible&#x27;, as new windows, stairwells and lift shafts could be added without risk to the building&#x27;s structural integrity.

The advanced design stretches far beyond what can be seen from the ground. The structures are free from wood, but their foundations contain 13,729 piles of timber, which would stretch for in length if laid end to end. Such heavily supportive foundations were needed because the construction land was reclaimed from the River Mersey to build on. Given the &#x27;quicksand&#x27; nature of the Mersey&#x27;s tidal silt the piles were needed to provide maximum stability. The resultant effect of the dock being constructed where it was is that the north and west stacks (now Merseyside Maritime Museum and Colonnades) rise and fall with every tide.

One of the most notable features of the Albert Dock are the huge cast iron columns that line the quayside. At high and almost in circumference, the columns are based upon the Greek Doric style of architecture. Hartley&#x27;s decision to use cast iron was an economic one as at the time it was cheaper than granite. Nonetheless, because of the huge dock walls that were built, the Albert Dock&#x27;s construction required so much granite that the dock trustee&#x27;s had to open their own mine in Kirkcudbrightshire in Scotland. The quality of the build materials used as well as the docks sheer size are considered a strong illustration of the great prosperity that the Port of Liverpool afforded the city at the time and the building&#x27;s style is described as cyclopean classicism.

==Albert Dock today==

As well as being the number one tourist attraction in Liverpool, the Albert Dock is also the most visited multi-use attraction in the United Kingdom outside London, with in excess of four million visitors per year. Amongst the many attractions at the Albert Dock are the Merseyside Maritime Museum, the Beatles Story and the Tate Liverpool. There are also two hotels within the Albert Dock: a Holiday Inn and Premier Inn both located in the Britannia Pavilion. All the five warehouses around the dock, referred to as A, B, C, D and E, are Grade I listed buildings. Collectively they cover 1.25m sq ft in size, the biggest such group of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in the UK. Also listed Grade I is the former dock traffic office. Other buildings around the dock are listed Grade II; they are the former hydraulic pumping station, and the swing bridge leading from the dock towards the Pierhead.

In the aftermath of the dock&#x27;s regeneration in the 1980s a policy had been adopted to try to attract retailers into the newly created premises within. However, after many years of struggling to compete with other major shopping areas in the city, the Albert Dock Company Ltd announced in 2007 a shift into attracting more bars and restaurants. As of 2008, bars and restaurants resident in the Albert Dock include Maray, Panam Bar &amp; Restaurant, Revolution Bar, and Whats Cooking?

<text>Palmerstown (; officially Palmerston, see spelling) is a civil parish and suburb in western Dublin on the banks of the River Liffey. It forms part of the South Dublin local authority and the Dublin Mid-West parliamentary constituency. The area is bordered to the north by the River Liffey and the Strawberry Beds, to the west by Lucan, to the south-west by Clondalkin, to the south by Ballyfermot and to the east by the village of Chapelizod. Palmerstown village is situated near the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre. The area is situated near the major junction of the M50 motorway and the N4. It lies approximately 7 km west of O&#x27;Connell Street in Dublin city centre. The Old Lucan Road, once the main route from the city to the west, passes through the centre of Palmerstown village.

==Name origin and spelling==
A &quot;palmer&quot; in medieval times was a pilgrim who returned from the Holy Land with a palm branch or leaf. Between 1185 and 1188 Ailred the Palmer and his wife took religious vows and founded a priory and monastic hospital of Crutched Friars outside the West Gate of Dublin, on the road to Kilmainham, which they endowed with all their property. In 1188 Pope Clement III confirmed the priory&#x27;s grants, including both the parish of Palmerstown west of Kilmainham and the other parish of Palmerstown northwards in Fingal. Gerard Lee notes an association of palmers with leper hospitals, of which there was one dedicated to Saint Laurence in the townland of the Saint Laurence in Palmerstown.

The spelling &quot;Palmerston&quot; rather than &quot;Palmerstown&quot; was fixed by the Ordnance Survey of Ireland in the 1830s; this remains the legal spelling and is officially recognised by South Dublin County Council. Locals generally use &quot;Palmerstown&quot;, and road signs have used both. A plebiscite of residents is required for a legal name change. In 2009 a plebiscite to change to &quot;Palmerstown&quot; received a majority of votes cast but not of eligible voters. The area concerned was the townlands of Palmerston Upper and Palmerston Lower with an estimated electorate of 8,000. Supporters of the change argued that the wording of the ballot confused some voters who wanted &quot;Palmerstown&quot; but voted No. They also argue the spelling without W creates confusion with Palmerston Park further east in Rathmines. Opponents argue the cost of changing road signs is prohibitive. Others argue that the name &quot;Palmerston&quot; legally applies only to the civil parish and townland, and that the locality known as &quot;Palmerstown&quot; has a separate identity. In 2014, another plebiscite was held, restricted to the electoral division (ED) of Palmerston Village (bounded by the Liffey, M50, and N4) and excluding the adjoining ED of Palmerston West. The electorate was 641, of whom 425 voted in favour and 17 against; the change to &quot;Palmerstown Village&quot; was formally approved at the county council meeting in January 2015.

The title Viscount Palmerston created in 1722 in the Peerage of Ireland derives from the place; its spelling also varied, but the form &quot;Lord Palmerston&quot; is now usual for the Victorian prime minister.

==Townlands==
The civil parish of Palmerstown is the most northerly parish in the former Barony of Uppercross. Much of Palmerstown has been developed for residential, transportation and commercial purposes over the last half century. Townlands include:
* Palmerston Lower 
* Palmerston Upper 
* Irishtown
* Saint Laurence
* Johnstown
* Palmerstown Manor
* Yellow Walls
* Fonthill
* Redcowfarm
* Woodfarm 
* Quarryvale
* Brooklawn
* Liffey Valley

===Palmerstown village===
The townlands of Palmerstown Upper and Palmerstown Lower straddle the old Lucan Road which was the ancient western highway. Many of Palmerstown&#x27;s local amenities are located in a cluster along the road. Robin Villas and Hollyville were labourers&#x27; cottages built at the beginning of the last century. The old national school is now a community centre. Stewarts Hospital, (formerly the residence of the Hely-Hutchinson family, the Roman Catholic Church of St. Philomena, the National School, the Palmerstown House Pub and Restaurant and a variety of general enterprises, including a bank and convenience stores are located here. Stewartscare is a health care facility at the Stewarts buildings and grounds which overlook the meandering Liffey valley. The Stewarts complex houses the administration of the Irish Health Service Executive. Stewarts Sports and Leisure centre is open to the general public. It also hosts an annual summer camp.

===Redcow Farm and Glenaulin Park===

This area was the location of the first modern housing development in Palmerstown, constructed between 1955 and 1965. Centred on Manor road, this area contains several shops, the local credit union and a doctor&#x27;s surgery. To the east of Redcow Farm, adjacent to the &quot;California Hills&quot; Park, is Glenaulin Park, a public park also home to St. Patricks GAA club. The park contains a short stretch of a local stream, the &quot;Glenaulin Stream&quot;, a Liffey tributary most of which runs in culvert.

The name &#x27;California Hills&#x27; was given by the children of the area to a small wasteland in Ballyfermot to the northeast of Glenaulin Park, which had been a builders&#x27; dump during the construction of the main Palmerstown Estate in the mid to late 1960&#x27;s. The wasteland had a series of small hills which were in fact mounds of rubble which had been buried under clay and eventually over grown with wild grass. The children of the area sometimes shortened the name to &#x27;The Caliers&#x27; and this name is also still in use today. The hills or mounds were flattened some years ago and the area landscaped for communal/public use.

===Palmerstown Lower===
Mill Lane leads to the original Palmerstown settlement and centre of industry, which once employed over 600 millhands, craftsmen, and labourers. This seventeenth-century low-lying waterside industrial village was complete with flax, seed, oil, flour and cloth mills. The ruin of a pre-Norman church and the remains of the once prosperous thriving community are situated near the river. A small ferry crossed the Liffey here, to where the Wren&#x27;s Nest pub was situated on the North side. A football ground opposite the river Liffey is home to Palmerstown F.C. Muhammad Ali visited Stewarts Hospital on 15 July 1972 when the hospital was hosting its annual sporting fete.

===Palmerstown Manor===
Palmerstown&#x27;s largest housing estate was built in the early 1990s in the south east of the area. Adjacent to the Coldcut and Kennelsfort roads and the M50 motorway, the estate marks the &#x27;border&#x27; between Palmerstown with Ballyfermot and Clondalkin.

===Woodfarm Acres===
The townland of Woodfarm Acres was mostly farmland, with a few council cottages previously existed on the site. This housing development was built during the 1970s. The estate is bounded by the M50 motorway and N4. Adjacent to Woodfarm Acres is another shopping centre containing a local SuperValu market, a gym, the youth center,and other amenities. Access to the local cemetery is adjacent to this centre. The Silver Granite Pub is located nearby, as is &quot;Pobalscoil Isolde&quot;, a secondary-level community school which opened in the 1980s.

===Oakcourt===
The Oakcourt housing estate lies in the western part of the 59-acre Johnstown townland, behind Pobalscoil Iosolde. It was originally developed in the 1970s, and expanded in the mid-1990s. The Johnstown townland extends due west from the Georgian Johnstown House (now St. John&#x27;s College) on Le Fanu Rd. It runs west to Kennelsfort Road and lies between St. Laurence townland (the St. Laurence House is now the West County Hotel) from the River Liffey and Chapelizod in the north, to Ballyfermot Upper/Blackditch on the south.

==Transport==
Palmerstown has some of the finest transport links of any Dublin suburb. The main public transport is Dublin Bus running via the N4 at Palmerstown village. Scheduled services run east to the city and west to Lucan, Celbridge, Leixlip and Maynooth. Route 26 operates from Liffey Valley to Dublin city via Kennelsfort Road Upper and Chapelizod. Route 18, a circular city route runs from the Old Lucan Road to Sandymount Green via many south Dublin suburbs including Walkinstown, Crumlin and Rathgar. Route G2 operates via the Coldcut road to Spencer Dock via Dublin city. Routes C1, C2, C3 and C4 operate via the Chapelizod Bypass to Ringsend or Sandymount via Dublin City.
Palmerstown railway station on the Dublin and Lucan tramway, later part of the Dublin United Transport Company tram system, opened in November 1881 and closed on 13 April 1940.

==Palmerstown Cemetery==
Palmerstown Cemetery was originally opened in 1978. It is located on Kennelsfort Road, adjacent to Woodfarm Acres. It is currently being managed as part of the Glasnevin Trust.

<doc id="1037484" wikidata="Q2639382" url="?curid=1037484" title="Saggart">
<text>Saggart () is a village in County Dublin, Ireland, south west of Dublin city, in the local government area of South Dublin. It lies between the N7 (Naas Road), Rathcoole, Citywest and Tallaght. It is one of the fastest-growing settlements in Ireland, with its population doubling between 2011 and 2022. The village is in a townland and civil parish of the same name, in the barony of Newcastle.

==Name==
A monk called Mosacra founded a settlement on the site of the village in the 7th century. The name Saggart derives from which means &quot;house of Sacra&quot; in Irish.

==History==
A monastery existed just outside the village in the 7th century. The remains of this monastery are found on the grounds of an equestrian centre approximately 1.5 km from today&#x27;s Saggart Village. After St Mosacra died, it became a nunnery with over 80 nuns living there until the Viking attacks of the 9th century.

By 1207, Saggart, or Tasagart, as it was then called by the Normans, had been made a prebend of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin. In 1615, the church was reported as being in good repair but fifteen years later the church is stated to have fallen down, and the Protestant parishioners attended Rathcoole church. The current church was built in 1847.

From 1888 to 1932, the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway stopped at Saggart.

===Historical artifacts===
Several objects of archaeological interest are located in Saggart, including a pair of megalithic standing stones in Boherboy, that are known locally as Adam and Eve. Nearby is the Raheen Standing Stone, a megalithic standing stone in a field on the Blessington Road, near Crooksling.

==Nature==
Saggart lies at the northern end of a mountain valley, the Slade of Saggart, with Brittas at the other side. The River Camac flows through this valley, passing around the village on the way to meet the River Liffey by Heuston Station. The great spotted woodpecker, Ireland&#x27;s newest breeding bird, has been seen here.

==Religion==
The Roman Catholic parish boundaries include the areas of Rathcoole and Brittas and the parish works in conjunction with the neighbouring parish of St. Finian&#x27;s, Newcastle. Dedicated in 1849, the Roman Catholic Church is named after &quot;The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;. The current Parish Priest is Fr. John Gilligan.

==Amenities==
Saggart is a heritage village. It is home to the Citywest Hotel, which hosts many annual events including the Irish Masters, award ceremonies, and political ard fheiseanna. Citywest Business Campus is located just to the north of Saggart village and is home to many companies. The Citywest Shopping Centre, anchored by Dunnes Stores, is the only major shopping centre in the area and has a pharmacy, cafes and a range of other shops. There is also a service/petrol station, restaurants and a 4,000-seat convention centre at Citywest. The Citywest Business Campus also includes a Dublin City University facility. Jacob&#x27;s Bar was established as a public house in the village by members of the Jacob family in 1901.

A new walking trail incorporating the Slade Valley is expected to be completed in the coming years. The section of the trail adjacent to Saggart Reservoir is currently under construction and runs alongside the boundary of the site. The development of the Slade Valley trail was marked as one of the Key Actions under the South Dublin County Council Tourism Strategy 2015-2020 where it is intended to take in Rathcoole, Saggart and Brittas with looped access to villages and other attractions.

==Transport==
===Luas===
Saggart Luas stop is one of two western termini for the Luas Red Line, the other being Tallaght. The line provides a direct link to Dublin city with a journey duration of 45 minutes.

===Bus===
Saggart is served by the Dublin Bus routes number 69 and GoAhead Ireland W6.

==Sport==
St Mary&#x27;s GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club and was founded in 1906.

Coolmine Equestrian Centre was established here in 1989. The equestrian centre is home to the remains of the 7th-century monastery of St Mo Sacra. The centre and CEAD-Ireland host equestrian activities and competitions and CEAD-Fest during the summer months.

==Politics==
For elections to South Dublin County Council, Saggart is part of the local electoral area of Clondalkin, along with Citywest, Rathcoole and Newcastle. Saggart is part of the Dáil constituency of Dublin Mid-West.

<doc id="1037486" wikidata="Q2268677" url="?curid=1037486" title="Skerries, Dublin">
<text>Skerries () is a coastal town in Fingal, in the north of County Dublin, Ireland. Skerries was historically a fishing port and later a centre of hand embroidery. These industries declined in the early 20th century, however, and it became both a resort town and a commuter town for Dublin to the south. Offshore from the town are several islands, one of which is a nature reserve, Rockabill.

==Etymology==
The name Skerries comes from the Old Norse word (), referring to a skerry − a small rocky island or reef which may be covered during high tide. In Irish this is pluralised as .

==Geography==
Skerries is on gently sloping land approaching the coast, which is partly overlooked by low bluffs. There are hills around, including Mill Hill, where a windmill has long been sited. The town itself is built around three long streets - Strand Street, Church Street and Balbriggan Road, and between the surrounding hills and beaches. Skerries South Strand is a long sandy beach (2.5 km; 1½ miles long). Red Island, Mill Hill, Hillside, the nearby Ardgillan Park and Demesne, Barnageeragh and to a lesser extent Baldungan Castle, provide vantages overlooking the town.

The town has five islands off its coast: Shenick Island, St Patrick&#x27;s, Colt and the island formation of Rockabill, which comprises &quot;The Cow&quot; and &quot;The Calf&quot;, separated by a narrow channel. There is also Red Island, which is a tied island.

Rockabill has the largest number of breeding roseate terns in Europe. It is also the farthest set of islands from the town and has a lighthouse which is 4 miles from the nearest path on the mainland at Red Island.

The Martello tower on Shenick Island is one of a number of defensive towers erected during the Napoleonic Wars along the Irish coast by the British. The tower is situated 1 mile from the great windmill and a similar distance from both the Monument on Strand Street and the other Martello tower on Red Island. This forms an almost perfect arc through the major tall secular structures in the town with the Martello tower on Shenick at the centre. Shenick Island is accessible on foot at the lowest tides, but potentially problematic, due to turning tides. The other islands are harder to reach, but it is possible by boat. St Patrick&#x27;s Island is so-called because Saint Patrick is reputed to have landed on the island.

==History==
===Invasions and saints===
Early writers tell how an island off Skerries was used as a landing place for an invasion, which happened in the second century C.E. This island was either Shenick or Red Island, which would have been a tidal island at the time. When the invaders landed, they formed ranks and at low tide marched to the mainland, where they were promptly defeated at the ancient settlement of Knocknagin, north of Balbriggan. The islands were previously known as the &quot;Islands of Cor&quot; possibly after the original inhabitants.

As noted, in AD 432, St. Patrick landed on Church Island, and according to the Annals of Inisfallen Saint Mochonna founded a monastery shortly afterwards.

In AD 797, the Vikings (or Danes) carried out one of their earliest raids in Ireland when they plundered the monastery on Church Island. As the origin of the name is Norse and many localities have Norse-based names, it is assumed that the Vikings did settle and occupy the area. Sitric, who was a son of a Dane called Murchard, re-founded the monastery on Church Island in 1120. He dedicated it to St. Patrick, the Apostle of Ireland. By this time, the Hiberno-Norse who had settled in Ireland had become Christians.

In 1148, Saint Malachy, Archbishop of Armagh, arranged a synod on St. Patrick&#x27;s island to settle differences between the Irish Christians and the Pope. Fifteen bishops, two hundred priests, and other clergy, were present.

===The Middle Ages===
In 1320, the manor of Skerries was granted to Sir Michael le Veel; his descendants Anglicised their name to Calf.

The Prior of Holmpatrick received permission to build a pier in 1496 from King Henry VII. At this time, Skerries was the property of the monastery of Holmpatrick and was known as the Port of Holmpatrick.

===Reformation era===
In 1565, after the Reformation, the monastery and its lands became the property of Thomas Fitzpatrick.

In the autumn of 1583, while the Catholic Church was illegal and underground, Archbishop Dermot O&#x27;Hurley arranged for a sea captain to smuggle him into Ireland from the French port of Le Croisic and drop him upon Holmpatrick Strand in Skerries. Archbishop O&#x27;Hurley, who later became one of the 24 Irish Catholic Martyrs, was met at Skerries by a priest named Fr. John Dillon, who accompanied him to Drogheda.

In 1605 the manor and lands of Holmpatrick were granted to Donogh O&#x27;Brien, 4th Earl of Thomond. The last Earl, Henry O&#x27;Brien, 8th Earl of Thomond, sold the manor and lands in 1721, including the town of Skerries, to the Hamilton family of Hacketstown. Comparisons between maps of Skerries drawn in 1703 and 1760 suggest that the Hamilton family was responsible for setting out the streets of the town as they are today.

Between 1863 and 1865 a monument to the memory of James Hans Hamilton, the local landlord and MP, was erected in Skerries. In 1897, Hamilton&#x27;s son was granted the title of Lord Holmpatrick.

===Early 20th century===
After the 1916 rising, a British destroyer landed troops at Skerries to help the Dublin garrisons suppress the rising. 200 men of the North Staffordshire Regiment landed under the command of Captain Clay. To try to impede their progress to Dublin, local rebels blew up the bridge over the railway in Donabate. During the Irish Civil War in 1922, senior Anti-Treaty IRA leader Harry Boland was mortally wounded, officially while resisting arrest, by two officers of the National Army inside his lodgings at the Skerries Grand Hotel.

====Holiday camps====

The town&#x27;s former school holiday camp, Gentours Children&#x27;s Holiday Camp, was initially a &quot;boys only&quot; camp. Later it became Gentours Children&#x27;s Holiday Camp.

In the late 1940s, a family holiday camp was built on Red Island by the Quinn family, founders of the Superquinn chain of supermarkets. The camp had 250 bedrooms all under one roof, along with dining and entertainment areas. In this respect, the accommodation at Red Island differed from more typical chalet facilities at other camps, such as Butlin&#x27;s. The holiday business closed in the early 1970s. The ballroom continued in use as a concert venue, until all the buildings were demolished in the 1980s. Much of the Red Island site is now laid out as a public park.

===Late 20th century===
With a restoration starting in the late 20th century, the Skerries Mills consists of two restored and working windmills, a watermill, a museum and coffee shop. Now operated as a local amenity and tourist attraction, the sails on one of the windmills were damaged during storms in January 2007, but subsequently repaired.

In common with much of Dublin&#x27;s hinterland, Skerries saw growth in residential property and associated prices during the late 1990s and early 21st century.
== Education ==
The town has one second-level institution, Skerries Community College, originating from a merger in 1982 of the De La Salle College, Skerries Vocational School, and the local Holy Faith convent school. It is a co-educational school, unlike the institutions from which it formed. There are five primary schools in the town: Réalt na Mara National School, St. Patrick&#x27;s National School, Holmpatrick National School, Milverton National School and Educate Together Skerries National School.

== Transport ==
The town is served by Skerries railway station, with most services terminating at Connolly and Pearse stations, Drogheda, and Dundalk. The 33 and 33A bus routes (operated by Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland respectively) pass through Skerries. The M1 motorway is the nearest major road to the town.

== Martello towers ==
The two Martello towers in Skerries, at Red Island and Shenick Island, are part of a chain of 29 Martello towers in the Greater Dublin Area constructed in the early 19th century. They were built by the British, along the Irish and English coasts. They were to serve as protection from Napoleonic French armies (in the scenario of an invasion) and as an early warning system against an attack. The tower on Red Island was used as part of the Red Island Holiday Camp. Since that was demolished in the 1980s, the tower has stood alone.

===Literary references===
In Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s book &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot;, Skerries is the location of the narrator&#x27;s meeting with James Joyce. The narrator has heard a rumour that Joyce has returned from the continent and is working in a small country pub. He tracks him down to a place on the outskirts of Skerries, but Joyce denies all knowledge of &quot;that filthy book&quot; &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

Casey, one of Reegan&#x27;s subordinate officers in John McGahern&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Barracks&quot;, is described as having previously been stationed in Skerries where he also met his wife, Teresa. In conversation with Elizabeth Reegan, the novel&#x27;s protagonist, Casey describes his &quot;great life there, near the city; the market gardening, places you couldn&#x27;t throw a stone without breaking glass&quot;, while Teresa recalls the evening she met her husband: &quot;You could still hear the music from the pavilion and it was comin&#x27; across from Red Island too, Mick Delahunty playing there that night. There was a big moon over the masts of the fishin&#x27; fleet. I knew he was mad for a court&quot;.

===Music===
Musicians from Skerries range from &quot;Tony Keeling and the Graduates&quot; in the showband days, through to extreme metal band Primordial which was formed in Skerries in the 1980s.

==Folklore==
According to local legend, while living on St Patrick&#x27;s Island near Skerries, Saint Patrick only had a goat as company. On one occasion, while travelling from the island to convert those on the mainland, the goat was reputedly stolen and eaten. The legend then tells that Patrick took away the people of Skerries&#x27; ability to speak, reducing them to shrieking and bleating like goats and it was only when they admitted their crime that their voices returned. The goat is sometimes used as a symbol for Skerries.

<doc id="1037487" wikidata="Q3055934" url="?curid=1037487" title="She-tragedy">
<text>The term she-tragedy, also known as pathetic tragedy refers to a vogue in the late 17th and early 18th centuries for tragic plays focused on the sufferings of a woman, sometimes innocent and virtuous but often a woman who had committed some sort of sexual sin. Prominent she-tragedies include Thomas Otway&#x27;s &quot;The Orphan&quot; (1680), John Banks&#x27; &quot;Virtue Betrayed, or, Anna Bullen&quot; (1682), Thomas Southerne&#x27;s &quot;The Fatal Marriage&quot; (1694), Mary Pix&#x27;s &quot;Ibrahim, the Thirteenth Emperor of the Turks&quot; and Nicholas Rowe&#x27;s &quot;The Fair Penitent&quot; (1703) and &quot;Lady Jane Grey&quot; (1715). Rowe was the first to use the term &quot;she-tragedy,&quot; in 1714.

== Overview ==
When English drama was reborn in 1660 with the re-opening of the theatres, the leading tragic style was the male-dominated heroic drama which celebrated powerful, aggressively masculine heroes and their pursuit of glory, as rulers and conquerors as well as lovers. In the 1670s and 1680s, a gradual shift occurred from heroic to pathetic tragedy, where the subject was love and domestic concerns, even though the main characters might be public figures. After the phenomenal success of Elizabeth Barry in moving the audience to tears in the role of Monimia in Otway&#x27;s &quot;The Orphan&quot;, she-tragedy became the dominant form of pathetic tragedy and remained highly popular for nearly half a century.

The realm of pathetic tragedy became an exploration of the female experience as the private female sphere, that of the domestic, was put on the stage and publicized. The she-tragedies demonstrated the psychology and behavior of women in their private sphere and presented it for public consideration, a new concept that emerged as women began to star in main roles instead of only supporting characters. For the first time, plays were written that had a woman as the main character and that followed her experiences and emotions. She-tragedies brought what was once solely internal (emotions and thoughts) out for external display. The rise of pathetic tragedy commodified the female experience and women themselves with the transition from men (dressed as women) playing the female roles to women acting on the stage themselves. Actresses, while not unusual in Continental Europe, were just beginning to be accepted as a novelty by the predominantly male audience. The idea of the woman, occupier of the private sphere, as a public figure was bizarre. As a result, actresses often had a bad moral reputation as before the Restoration, public women were immoral women. However, royal sanction gave actresses more opportunities and opened the way for new dramatic possibilities.

== Components of she-tragedy ==
She tragedies are known for having focused on the hardships of women rather than those suffered by men. A she-tragedy during the 1680s derived its power from the ability to create titillating scenes that portrayed the suffering of an innocent woman. Pathetic tragedies would begin by presenting the heroine and establishing that she was desirable. Unlike the other popular new genre, horror, the she-tragedy did not depend on violence and gore to become the spectacle of the heroine but rather used the physical suffering that was inflicted on the blameless female victims. The women, who were the subject of the play, would usually become victims of adversity and crimes that sexually exploited them such as rape or unsolicited adultery. During the scenes of rape the woman would be abducted and carried off stage. The act of rape, or adultery, would be conveyed to the audience by screams from the woman as the villain completed the evil deed. After the scene the woman would return onstage. Evidences of ravished womanhood such as disheveled hair, disordered clothing, and phallic dagger were trademark of Restoration rape and prominent in she-tragedy. Playwrights would utilize other ill fortune such as the loss of a husband or child and a single mother&#x27;s struggle to raise her children as another means of causing hardship in the heroine&#x27;s life. After suffering these hardships throughout the play the female protagonist would be overcome by madness, commit suicide or murder as a result of the burden with which she had suffered. The success of a she-tragedy was dependent upon the emotion that the actress conveyed to the audience, but the emotion that the audience felt as they watched the performance. She-tragedy also focused on making the heroine and not the hero the focus of the play. Attention would be placed on the female actress and her sexuality as playwrights used specific dialogue and devices to focus on the sexuality of the woman. One example of this is seen in &quot;The Orphan&quot; by Otway. In a scene Monimia is accompanied by a page who states to her
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;&quot;Madam, Indeed I&#x27;d serve you with my soul;&quot;
&quot;But n the morning when you call me to you&quot;
&quot;As by your bed I stand and tell you stories,&quot;
&quot;I am asham&#x27;d to see your swelling Breasts, &quot;
&quot;It makes me blush, they are so very white&quot;.&quot; (1.221-25)&lt;/poem&gt;
Here Otway is directing the audience&#x27;s eyes to the actress&#x27; breasts, making her the focal point, and also sexualizing the actress and the character of Monima.

== Use in political propaganda ==
While she-tragedies were highly entertaining to the public, playwrights would also use them to voice political opinions. In Rowe&#x27;s &quot;Jane Grey&quot; the character Jane represents a symbol of virtue whose desires are second to the political good. During the 1690s the rape in she-tragedies leaned towards Whig beliefs and became a symbol for the justification for displacing proper rule. The spectacle of rape within the tragedy was used to convey the belief that the sexual assault on the female victim was a visual representation of assault on the subjects&#x27; liberties.

== Actresses and royal support ==
One reason that the Carolinian court was more accepting of the addition of women to the world of theater was the experience of the new monarch, Charles II, before he ascended to the throne. Charles I was executed during the English Civil War, and his son (the future Charles II) went into exile. Charles II spent much of his exile living at the French court and learning French tastes and manners. Although practically unheard of in England, it was not uncommon for women to take part in French and Italian theater, and Charles II would have been exposed to this. As a result, after he returned to England in 1660, Charles II did not have the same qualms as his countrymen when it came to the more public presence of women.

In addition, in 1662, a law was passed that women&#x27;s roles were to be played by women and no longer by men. It is speculated that this change was at least partially due to the influence of the Puritans, who &quot;took offence&quot; at men cross-dressing to play women, something that was seen as going against the biblical Book of Deuteronomy (22:5). Ironically, this attempt to reclaim morality in theater led to further scandals as the practice of &quot;breeches roles&quot; developed. These were roles played by woman while wearing men&#x27;s clothing, either as part of a disguise required by the script or to give the actresses more license to behave as society allowed men to. These roles, while often part of elaborate plots, were sometimes used to exploit the physical aspects of women – as men&#x27;s clothing did not disguise the body&#x27;s form as much as the dresses traditionally worn by women.

== Women in tragedy ==
The new focus on women in tragedy may be linked with a growing political disillusion with the old aristocratic ideology and its traditional masculine ideals (see Staves). Other possible explanations for the great interest in she-tragedy are the popularity of Mary II, who often ruled alone in the 1690s while her husband William III was on the Continent, and the publication of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, the first periodical aimed at women. Elizabeth Howe has argued that the most important explanation for the shift in taste was the emergence of tragic actresses whose popularity made it unavoidable for dramatists to create major roles for them. With the conjunction of the playwright &quot;master of pathos&quot; Thomas Otway and the great tragedienne Elizabeth Barry in &quot;The Orphan&quot;, the focus shifted decisively from hero to heroine.

<text>Stillorgan (, also and previously or ), formerly a village in its own right, is now a suburban area of Dublin in Ireland. Stillorgan is located in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, and contains many housing estates, shops and other facilities, with the old village centre still present. Stillorgan is at least partly contiguous with Kilmacud and neighbours other southside districts such as Mount Merrion, Sandyford, Leopardstown, Dundrum, Blackrock, Goatstown and Foxrock.

The population of all electoral divisions labelled as Stillorgan, an area considerably larger than Stillorgan village, was 18,212 at the 2022 census. Stillorgan is in a civil parish of the same name, in the barony of Rathdown.

==Name==
It is popularly believed that the name Stillorgan is either a Danish or Anglo-Norman corruption of Teach Lorcán, &#x27;the house or church of Lorcán&#x27;, possibly signifying Saint Lorcán Ua Tuathail. Another belief is that it is named after a Danish or Irish chief of a similar name: what may have been his burial chamber was discovered in Stillorgan Park in 1716. The original Irish name for Stillorgan was Áth na Chill (&#x27;Athnakill&#x27;) – &#x27;Ford of the Church&#x27;. In the fourteenth century, the manor of Stillorgan (Stalorgan) was held by the Cruise or Cruys family, from whom it passed to the Derpatrick family, and subsequently to the Fitzwilliams. It was held as leasehold from the English Crown, and in 1389 Sir John Cruys was excused from paying the rent of 40 shillings on the estate.

The local Roman Catholic parish church of St. Laurence is usually presumed to be named after Lorcán Ua Tuathail (whose first name has been traditionally anglicised as Laurence, although the two names are etymologically unrelated). Lorcán, who was born at Diseart Diarmada (Castledermot), County Kildare in 1128, and died at Eu, Normandy, France in 1180, was canonized in 1225 by Pope Honorius. He was one of four sons of an Ua Broin (O&#x27;Byrne) princess and Muirchertach Ua Tuathail, King of the Uí Muirdeaigh III.

==Development==

In the 1930s, 60 houses were built at Beaufield Park. The Merville Estate was subsequently built in the 1950s on land belonging to the Jolly family dairy farm. St Laurence&#x27;s Park was completed in October 1954.

The first bowling alley in Ireland, the Stillorgan Bowl opened in December 1963 and since 1996 was run under LeisurePlex until it was demolished in May 2021.
Ireland&#x27;s first shopping centre was opened in Stillorgan by recently-retired Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, on 1 December 1966. It had three supermarkets, Powers, Liptons and Quinnsworth The road in front of the shopping centre was completely lined with cottages built during the early 19th century and, to enable the construction of the centre, they were knocked down. They extended from the Christian Brothers&#x27; school Oatlands College to the end of the Dublin Road and up the Lower Kilmacud Road. The rubble was used to fill in and level the lands that are now Páirc De Burca, the playing field of Kilmacud Crokes. Discussions have been ongoing for many years about expanding and updating the centre. It was planned to be redeveloped by Treasury Holdings in 2008. The &#x27;Blakes&#x27;/&#x27;Burn Nightclub&#x27; site has also planning permission for a multi-story apartment complex with some commercial units.

==Places of interest==

Samuel Lewis&#x27; &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot; (1837) lists a number of &quot;handsome seats and pleasing villas&quot; in the area. These included Stillorgan House (of the Verschoyle family), Carysfort House (home of William Saurin, Attorney General for Ireland), Mount Eagle (later Stillorgan Castle/St John of God Hospital), and several other large residences.

The location of Stillorgan Castle became the House of St John of God when the Hospitaller Order moved there in 1883; it is now a psychiatric hospital. One of the most prominent architectural features is the large 18th-century obelisk designed by Edward Lovett Pearce for the second Viscount Allen; Pearce resided in Stillorgan in a house known as The Grove, which was demolished to make way for Stillorgan Bowl.

The present St. Brigid&#x27;s Church of Ireland was built in 1706 on the site of an earlier church, thought to have been linked to St. Brigid&#x27;s Monastery in Kildare.

A large open reservoir, called Stillorgan Reservoir, is situated near the Sandyford Industrial Estate. The water is piped from the Vartry Reservoir near Roundwood in County Wicklow. It was built in the 19th century as part of Dublin Corporation&#x27;s waterworks on the lands of an 18th-century house called Rockland, later known as Clonmore.

Stillorgan&#x27;s oldest pub is Bolands, latterly styled &quot;Bolands on the Hill&quot;. While it was reopened as &#x27;McGowan&#x27;s&#x27; following a change of lease-holder in 2010, it reverted to &#x27;Bolands&#x27; in 2012. In its older manifestation it was a local drinking refuge of many South Dublin writers, among them Brian O Nuallain (Myles na gCopaleen) and Maurice Walsh. Henry Darley&#x27;s brewery was opened in the 1800s and is located near what is now The Grange, Brewery Road. Cullen&#x27;s was a grocery shop as well as a pub in the 1920s and 1930s. It is now the site of the Stillorgan Orchard which was thatched in the 1980s. It was previously called The Stillorgan Inn.

The first Ormonde Cinema was built and opened in 1954, seating 980 people with a large car park to the side. It was completely demolished in 1978, the site being occupied by the AIB Bank at Stillorgan Plaza. The new Ormonde Cinema opened in the early 1980s as a smaller multi-screen venue. In summer 2011, the Ormonde Cinema was refurbished and opened as a UCI cinema, and later Odeon.

==Education==
Primary and secondary schools in the area include Oatlands College (boys/Catholic), Mount Anville (girls/Catholic), St. Benildus College (boys/Catholic), St. Brigid&#x27;s (mixed, Church of Ireland), St. Laurence&#x27;s (boys/Catholic), and St. Raphaela&#x27;s School (girls/Catholic). Ireland&#x27;s first Montessori school &quot;Children&#x27;s House Montessori School&quot; was created here in 1952 by Veronica Ryan.

Third level institutions in Stillorgan include Stillorgan College of Further Education.

==Sports==
Stillorgan is home to the Kilmacud Crokes Gaelic Athletic Association club, whose clubhouse and grounds, Glenalbyn, are located directly opposite the shopping centre. It is also home to Stillorgan Rugby Club. 

UCD Marian Basketball Club plays most of their underage games in Oatlands College.

==Transport==
===Road===
The N11 road leads out from the city, passing through Stillorgan, towards the major commuter town of Bray. It bypassed Stillorgan&#x27;s centre since the mid-1970s when the Stillorgan Bypass was opened to the east. The N11 hosts the &#x27;Stillorgan Bus Corridor&#x27; (QBC) which runs along the road in both directions from St. Stephen&#x27;s Green to Foxrock. Stillorgan is a major bus interchange and the Stillorgan QBC is the most heavily used in Ireland, featuring two of Dublin&#x27;s busiest and most frequent bus routes, the E2 to Dún Laoghaire, the E1 to Bray. Other bus routes serving Stillorgan include the 11, 47 and L25 as well as the peak time-only routes X1, X2, 116 and 118. All of these are operated by Dublin Bus. Go-Ahead Ireland also used to operate the 75 through Stillorgan until 26 November 2023 when it was replaced with the L25. Aircoach provides a direct link to the Dublin Airport via Dublin city centre.

===Rail===
The Luas Green line runs on the border of Stillorgan and Sandyford between the reservoir and the Sandyford Industrial Estate over the route of the old Harcourt Street line from Dublin to Bray. Stillorgan is served by two Luas stops, the eponymous Stillorgan Luas stop, and Sandyford; both stops opened with the line in 2004. The Stillorgan stop is approximately south-west of the village with park and ride facilities, a commuter bus link to the shopping centre and a journey time to Dublin O&#x27;Connell street of about half an hour. Sandyford is situated 450 metres south of Stillorgan with the Luas depot behind it. It was the original terminus of the green line, but the Luas has since been extended away from the course of the old railway line to Brides Glen, though some services still terminate at Sandyford. The earlier Stillorgan railway station was situated to the south of the current Luas depot, past Sandyford stop. It opened on 10 July 1854 following the opening of the Dublin and Wicklow Railway, closed for goods traffic in 1937, and finally closed altogether on 1 January 1959 when CIÉ mothballed the Harcourt Street line. The station building became a private residence and the pumping station near the reservoir is all that survives with it. The nearest railway station today is Blackrock, which a 10-minute drive and 36 minute walk from the village.

A National Transport Authority consultation paper, published in 2018, proposed that the MetroLink would stop alongside Stillorgan&#x27;s Luas station on its way from Estuary to Sandyford. This was dropped the following year, as it was feared it would disrupt the Luas for a few years, and the updated Metrolink proposal projects a stop at Charlemont instead.

==Representation==
The Stillorgan Ward is one of six wards in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council. The Ward includes Clonskeagh, Mount Merrion, Kilmacud, Stillorgan, Leopardstown and Foxrock. The Stillorgan Ward was established with the 1985 Irish local elections, prior to which much of the Stillorgan Ward was part of the Dundrum Ward.

In the 2019 local elections, six councillors were elected to the ward with three representing Fine Gael, one Fianna Fáil, one Green Party and one independent.

<text>Cleavant Derricks Jr. (born May 15, 1953) is an American stage and screen actor, Tony Award winning singer and songwriter, who may be best known for his role of Rembrandt Brown on &quot;Sliders&quot;.

==Biography==
Derricks was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, to pianist mother Cecile G. and Baptist preacher/composer Cleavant Derricks Sr., known for his popular gospel music hymn &quot;Just a Little Talk with Jesus&quot;. His twin brother is actor and musician Clinton Derricks-Carroll. Derricks began his career as a Nashville gospel songwriter. With his father, he wrote the gospel album &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot;. He was the musical director and composer for the musical &quot;When Hell Freezes Over I&#x27;ll Skate&quot;.

Derricks went to New York City to study acting with Vinnette Carroll at the Urban Arts Theatre. He received rave reviews for his performance in his Broadway shows, including &quot;But Never Jam Today&quot; and the 1977 revival of &quot;Hair&quot;. He also won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical, for creating the role of James &quot;Thunder&quot; Early in &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;. Off-Broadway he was in the William Finn musical &quot;Romance in Hard Times&quot; in 1989. He also starred in the Broadway musical &quot;Brooklyn&quot; as the Streetsinger.

Soon afterwards, Derricks appeared in films such as &quot;Moscow on the Hudson&quot;, Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Slugger&#x27;s Wife&quot; and Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;. He was a series regular on the short-lived television series &quot;Thea&quot; with Thea Vidale and Brandy, and &quot;Good Sports&quot; with Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O&#x27;Neal. His role as Rembrandt Brown on &quot;Sliders&quot; with Jerry O&#x27;Connell, Sabrina Lloyd and John Rhys-Davies was the only &quot;Sliders&quot; character to appear throughout the entire series. In addition, Derricks has had numerous guest-starring roles in series such as &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;A Different World&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, and many others.

<text>Fort Hubberstone, on the west side of Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, is a Grade II* Listed Building which belongs to a series of forts built as part of the inner line of defence of the Haven following the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom. Together with Popton Fort on the opposite shore, it provided an interlocking field of fire, and represented the last layer of defence before reaching the Royal Naval dockyard at Pembroke Dock. Construction began in 1860 and was completed in 1863 at a cost of £55,000. It is a large battery, with eleven guns in casemates, eight in an open battery above, with another nine in an open flank battery, and a large barracks to the rear. It is a D-shaped structure, with a bomb-proof roof which protected the barracks and other buildings from mortar projectiles. On its landward side, it was protected by a deep ditch, and on the seaward side by a counter-scarp gallery. The associated casemate battery is located further down the headland and separated from the fort.

The barracks had capacity for 250 men, sourced from the Royal Pembrokeshire Artillery and the 24th Regiment of Foot. Recruitment however was frequently constrained by the isolation of the fort, lacking the appeal of more urban stations. The fort was often required to fire live practice rounds, and in 1894 participated in experiments to illuminate targets with searchlights so they could be engaged at night. Notoriously, in 1875 Lieutenant Walter of the militia was murdered by a Doctor Alder in a drunken brawl.

The fort was abandoned after World War I as a consequence of the Haldane Reforms. A 1919 proposal to convert the structure into social housing came to nothing. World War II saw the fort once again in active use, when it was used as an air raid shelter and army camp for American military personnel.

On a good site, the fort has fallen into disrepair. Under the ownership of Milford Haven Port Authority, there were various unsuccessful plans to restore the structure. The site is not currently open to the public, and has been the scene of non-fatal injuries to trespassers. In 2011 it was named as the fifth most endangered archaeological site in the UK by British Archaeology, which prompted a campaign to seek a long-term sustainable use of the site. In 2019, plans were announced to convert the site into a military-based residential camp for former service men and women. These plans were subsequently dropped due to a media scandal involving Camp Valour. 

Names of the new owners of the fort:
05.07.2024) PROPRIETOR: KELSEY ISRAEL DAVID TRATTNER and ALYSON IRENE

RAWES of Fort Hubberston, Fort Rise, Hakin, Milford Haven SA73 3P

PIn September 2020, the site was purchased by Guy Anderson, a private investor and local councillor, who announced it would be open it to the public as a ‘living ruin’.

In 2021 it featured on the BBC television programme &quot;Hidden Wales: Last Chance to Save&quot;..

<doc id="1037513" wikidata="Q2737350" url="?curid=1037513" title="Bondi Junction railway station">
<text>Bondi Junction railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Eastern Suburbs line, serving the Sydney suburb of Bondi Junction in the Australian state of New South Wales. It is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T4 Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line services and NSW TrainLink&#x27;s South Coast Line services.

==History==

As a long-standing major commercial area in Sydney&#x27;s east, a railway line had long been considered to Bondi Junction. The suburb was variously proposed to have been the intermediate or the ultimate terminus of an Eastern Suburbs Railway since 1916. In 1967, tenders were awarded for the construction of the Eastern Suburbs line as far as Bondi Junction. Construction began shortly thereafter.

===Construction plans===
Although a subway station, construction required the demolition of a block of mixed commercial-residential buildings to permit staging of the project, the construction of a works compound and, once the railway was completed, to be the location of the bus interchange facility.

The line was to be eventually constructed to Kingsford, but the first stage would run only so far as Bondi Junction. As the planned interim terminus of the line, terminus facilities were provided at the station. These consisted of a turnback tunnel between the main running tunnels and a trailing crossover.

An underground shopping complex was proposed to be constructed at the concourse level of the station (similar to that which exists at Martin Place). Additionally, an underground walkway would be provided to the then proposed (later constructed) Bondi Junction Plaza shopping centre.

===Construction realities===
Construction of the Eastern Suburbs Railway generally proceeded from the Erskineville tunnel portals to Bondi Junction. As such Bondi Junction was the last developed station site.

In 1976, the Wran Government sought to reduce costs on the railway&#x27;s construction. As a result of an inquiry by an Eastern Suburbs Railway Board of Review, a number of recommendations were made and accepted by the government. Relevantly these included:
*Eastern Suburbs Railway not be constructed beyond Bondi Junction and the route to Kingsford be abandoned
*Line be fully integrated with the Illawarra line (not be run independently)
*Shopping centre on the station concourse not be constructed
*Tunnel to the Bondi Junction Plaza not be constructed
*Level of finish at the station be reduced and only four escalators be provided from the concourse level to the platform level
*Scale of the bus interchange be reduced

As a result of these changes, Bondi Junction became the permanent terminus of the Eastern Suburbs and Illawarra railway lines. However no provision was made for an upgraded turnback facility.

===Opening===
The Eastern Suburbs Railway was opened on 23 June 1979 by the Premier, Neville Wran.

===Rebuilding the bus interchange===

The bus interchange facility opened in 1979 was basic. The location of the station meant the land and airspace on which it was located was highly valuable. This in turn led to various proposal throughout the 1990s to sell the airspace and redevelop the interchange. In 1998, Woollahra Council, then controlling the site of the bus interchange, finalised an agreement to sell the airspace above the site to Meriton who commenced construction of a new bus interchange together with two residential apartment towers and a small shopping centre in April 1999. The new interchange was temporarily opened in September 2000 for the Sydney Olympics but subsequently closed for further work. The new bus interchange, two apartment towers and the shopping centre opened in July 2001. The shopping centre known as Tiffany Plaza (renamed to Meriton Retail Precinct Bondi Junction in 2018) featured a McDonald&#x27;s outlet, a gym, a child care centre and seven other retailers.

Reconstruction of the bus terminal altered the locations of commuter access to the station concourse. As such, alterations were required to the station concourse. The resulting renovation of Bondi Junction station primarily involved upgrading station staff facilities, the installation of toilets and the general updating of the station, hitherto a time capsule to the 1970s.

The renovation was conducted coincidentally with the Easy Access upgrade to the station and the replacement of the original incandescent lamp platform indicators with plasma display indicators.

==Clearways Project upgrade==
Constructed as a part of the Rail Clearways Program, a second turnback facility was built. The major work consisted of the construction of a new crossover tunnel on the city side of the station. This created an X-shaped or diamond junction allowing terminating trains to arrive at either platform. The changes allowed the full line capacity of 20 trains per hour to be turned at Bondi Junction, the prior limit being 14.

In addition, extra stabling facilities were provided by utilitising unused sections of tunnels beyond the station. These tunnels were constructed on anticipation of continued tunnelling towards Kingsford. They have had track laid and overhead wire installed for a length of two eight-car trains in each tunnel. This gives a total stabling capacity of five eight-car trains (two in each siding and one in the turnback tunnel).

Complementing the stabling capacity at the station is the erection of a staff meal and waiting room on the platform level.

Construction began on the site in October 2004 while the station was closed and trains terminated at Edgecliff. Commissioning took place in April 2006.

<text>The Australian Army Inventions Board was established in 1900, and played a significant role in Allied Research and Development during World War I. However, by the late 1930s it had been allowed to become mostly inactive. It was revived in early 1940 under the name &#x27;Army Central Inventions Board&#x27;, though it was still generally known by its older name. In 1942 the board was reorganized into the Army Inventions Directorate (circa 1942–1946). It was a government body of the Commonwealth of Australia, set up in 1942 to handle the thousands of inventions submitted by the public. These inventions numbered some 27,000; a mere 127 of which were eventually accepted by the Army as being of notable value or suitable for military purposes. The best known invention accepted by the Army Inventions Board was the Australian-designed Owen Gun, a machine carbine which took a few years to get off the ground.

The Army Inventions Directorate was located at Victoria Barracks in Melbourne.

<doc id="1037524" wikidata="Q5210442" url="?curid=1037524" title="Dale Fort">
<text>Dale Fort is a mid-19th-century coastal artillery fort at Dale Head, a rocky promontory near Dale, Pembrokeshire, west of Milford Haven in Wales. It is one of the centres run by Field Studies Council and offers residential and non-residential fieldwork for schools, colleges and universities, holiday accommodation and professional and leisure courses in natural history and arts.

==History==

Although there was a proposal for an artillery battery on this site in 1829, the present fort is a result of a recommendation by Sir John Fox Burgoyne, the Inspector-General of Fortifications, in 1850. There is no record of when construction started, but the work was completed by 1858 and a date of 1856 is inscribed above the main gate. The fort was intended to protect the anchorage at the mouth of Milford Haven by providing interlocking fire with the nearby forts at Thorn Island and West Blockhouse. In 1876 there was a recommendation that the fort be re-armed with larger and more modern guns, but this was never implemented. The fort was the site for trials of Edmund Zalinski&#x27;s Pneumatic Dynamite Gun in the 1890s, but the design was not adopted.

In 1902, the fort was sold to Lieutenant-Colonel A. Owen-Evans of the Royal Engineers, who converted it into a home for his family, but it changed hands when he died in 1925. During the Second World War, the fort was requisitioned by the Admiralty for use as a degaussing and mine-watching station, but was returned to the owner at the end of hostilities. The West Wales Field Society purchased Dale Fort for £6,000 in 1946 which it leased to the Council for the Promotion of Field Studies in August. The Wardens of Skokholm operated from Dale Fort initially. In 1959, it was sold to the Field Studies Council (formerly CPFS) at cost price plus an interest-free mortgage of £1,800 transferred to the Council. It has been run by the Field Studies Council as a field centre, and is now used by many thousands of students each year. 70% of the students are A-Level biologists working on the nearby shores to understand ecology.

==Description==

The fort occupies the easternmost end of the promontory; it is protected by a ditch cut into the rock, which extends across the promontory and down to the shoreline on either side. The landward (western) side of the fort facing the ditch consists of a loopholed wall, in the centre of which is a D-shaped bastion with embrasures for three guns. In the northwest corner is a defensible building of three ranges. The central one facing the ditch consists of guardrooms, between which the main entrance of the fort passes in a passageway, having crossed the ditch by means of a bridge. The northern range is a barracks for the ordinary soldiers and the southern range contains various storerooms. Further along the northern edge is the officers&#x27; quarters and the main magazine, now with a modern accommodation building over it. The gun battery is at the eastern end of the fort on the cliffs overlooking the haven. There are seven positions intended for 68-pounder guns firing &quot;en barbette&quot; (i.e. on open mountings firing over a parapet), the southernmost four being on a higher level than the other three. Originally there was an expense magazine to support these positions, but it has been demolished. The site of the Dynamite Gun position is close to the present dining area, towards the north of the fort.

<doc id="1037525" wikidata="Q1754699" url="?curid=1037525" title="New American Gospel">
<text>New American Gospel is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Lamb of God, as well as their first album under that name (they were originally known as Burn the Priest). It was released in 2000 through Prosthetic Records. &quot;New American Gospel&quot; is also the first release with Willie Adler on guitar, who replaced Abe Spear.

Metal Blade Records reissued a remastered version of &quot;New American Gospel&quot; in 2006 with four bonus tracks. The remastered version contains a note on the inlay that explains that the sound of the album is less polished than their newer work, in part due to time constraints as well as heavy drinking. It has sold over 100,000 copies in the United States.

==Reception==

&quot;Revolver&quot; magazine called &quot;New American Gospel&quot; one of the &quot;69 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. NME said the album &quot;harks back to the days when Slayer ruled the kingdom of metal with speedy riffs and nihilism&quot;, and described the sound as &quot;ferocious&quot;. CMJ described &quot;New American Gospel&quot; as &quot;grindcore and death metal for the hardcore kids&quot;. Exclaim! compared &quot;New American Gospel&quot; to bands such as Pantera and Meshuggah, noted its &quot;truly killer snare drum sound&quot;, and described the album in general as &quot;a thoroughly satisfying listen and an innovative, real, heavy and scary metal album&quot;.

In 2020, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 2000 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

Stewart took the magazine with her when she bought out her contract with Time Inc. in 1997, and &quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot; became the flagship brand of the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia media empire. In 2015, Meredith Corporation assumed editorial and operational control of &quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot; and &quot;Martha Stewart Weddings&quot;.

&quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot; magazine featured lifestyle content around food, home decorating, entertaining, crafts/DIY, travel, and tastemakers, with monthly columns including &quot;From Martha&quot;, &quot;Good Things&quot;, &quot;Good Living&quot;, and &quot;Everyday Food&quot;. Martha Stewart was the Founder and Chief Creative Officer of the magazine. The magazine&#x27;s editorial staff was led by editor-in-chief, Elizabeth Graves, and included a staff of industry-recognized editors including Sarah Carey, Editorial Director of Food &amp; Entertaining, Melissa Milrad Goldstein, Beauty Director, and Melissa Ozawa, Features &amp; Garden Editor.

During the period 2005–2013, &quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot; made a profit only in 2007.

The magazine discontinued its print edition and went online only in May 2022.

==Television program==

The &quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot; television show debuted as a weekly half-hour syndicated program in September 1993. Intended to complement the magazine, the program featured Stewart as host of each episode where she presented segments on things such as cooking, gardening, craft making and decorating. It expanded to weekdays in 1997, became a full hour-long program in 1999 (with a 30-minute weekend edition) and went on hiatus in autumn of 2004 following Stewart&#x27;s stock trading case and conviction.

The show was distributed by Group W Productions from 1993 to 1995, Eyemark Entertainment from 1995 to 2000 following the CBS-Westinghouse merger, then King World Productions from 2000 to 2004 following CBS&#x27; merger with King World. It was succeeded by &quot;The Martha Stewart Show&quot; after Stewart&#x27;s release from prison in 2005 and ran until it was cancelled in 2012.

==Accolades==
Both the magazine and the television show won numerous awards.

<text>USS &quot;E-2&quot; (SS-25) was an E-class submarine of the United States Navy. Originally named Sturgeon, the boat was launched on 15 June 1911 by the Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Ms. Margaret Nelson Little; renamed &quot;E-2&quot; on 17 November 1911; and commissioned on 14 February 1912.

==Service history==
Serving in the Atlantic Submarine Flotilla, &quot;E-2&quot; sailed out of Newport, Rhode Island for developmental exercises and training. From 5 January-21 April 1914, she cruised to Guantanamo Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. She returned to Naval Station Newport on 27 July, for training operations for the remainder of the summer and from February–May 1915 off Florida.

On 19 June, she entered New York Navy Yard for overhaul. While sitting in dry dock Number 2,
 &quot;E-2&quot; was victim of a violent explosion and fire on 15 January 1916 when hydrogen gas ignited during conditions of severe battery testing; tests made under the direction of the Edison Storage Battery Company. At the time, &quot;E-2&quot; was the test submarine for new nickel battery designed to eliminate the danger from chlorine gas asphyxiation. There were 32 men aboard the submarine at the time of the explosion, consisting of both crew and civilian electricians and mechanics making repairs. Four men were killed and seven injured. The government investigation, led by then Lieutenant Chester W. Nimitz, pointed blame away from the submarine&#x27;s commanding officer, then Lieutenant Charles M. Cooke, Jr.

On 13 March, &quot;E-2&quot; was placed out of commission for use as a laboratory, for exhaustive tests of the Edison storage battery. Recommissioned on 25 March 1918, &quot;E-2&quot; served in training and experimental work at New London until 16 May. Two days later she arrived at Norfolk to operate against enemy submarines off Cape Hatteras. From 21 May-27 August, she made four war patrols, sighting a large enemy submarine for which she made extended submerged search on her last patrol. &quot;E-2&quot; was commended by the Chief of Naval Operations for two of these anti-submarine patrols, which were exceptionally long for a submarine of her size.

Returning to New London on 31 August 1918, &quot;E-2&quot; made two more patrols before the end of the war, then returned to training student officers and qualifying men for duty in submarines. She sailed from New London to Norfolk on 19 April 1920, arriving two days later. There she was placed in commission in ordinary on 18 July 1921. On 17 September, she sailed for Philadelphia Navy Yard where she was decommissioned on 20 October and sold on 19 April 1922.

<text>Sandsfoot Castle, also known historically as Weymouth Castle, is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII near Weymouth, Dorset. It formed part of the King&#x27;s Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the Weymouth Bay anchorage. The stone castle had an octagonal gun platform, linked to a residential blockhouse, and was completed by 1542 at a cost of £3,887. Earthwork defences were built around the landward side of the castle, probably in 1623. Sandsfoot saw service during the English Civil War, when it was held by Parliament and Royalists in turn during the conflict. It survived the interregnum but, following Charles II&#x27;s restoration to the throne, the fortress was withdrawn from military use in 1665.

By the early 18th century, Sandsfoot was in ruins, its stonework taken for use in local building projects. The clay cliffs on which the castle had been built had always been unstable and subject to erosion. The castle&#x27;s gun platform began to collapse into the sea and, by the 1950s, had been entirely destroyed. The ruins were closed to visitors on safety grounds, although civic gardens were planted alongside it in 1951. Repairs were undertaken between 2009 and 2012 at a total cost of £217,800, enabling the site to be reopened to the public. Historic England considers Sandsfoot to be &quot;one of the most substantial examples&quot; of the 16th-century blockhouses to survive in England. The ruins were once again closed to visitors on safety grounds in January 2021. It remains closed to the public .

==History==
===16th century===
Sandsfoot Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.
After 1533, Henry broke with popes Pope Clement VII and Paul III in order to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, and Charles took the annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England appeared certain. In response, Henry issued an order, called a &quot;device&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.

Sandsfoot Castle was built to protect the Weymouth Bay anchorage, being placed on cliffs overlooking the waterway, opposite Portland Castle on the other side. Sandsfoot was a blockhouse, intended to defeat enemy ships using a battery of heavy artillery, and had minimal protection against an attack from the land. It was completed by 1541, run by a captain appointed by the Crown, and cost £3,887 to build. There was probably an early agreement that the nearby village of Wyke Regis had a responsibility to support the castle, and in exchange they came to traditionally enjoy an exemption from taxes and militia duties. The antiquarian John Leland visited the castle soon after its construction, describing it as &quot;a right goodlie and warlyke castle&quot; with &quot;one open barbican&quot;, probably referring to the castle&#x27;s gun platform.

Coastal erosion quickly began to threaten the castle, causing what was reported as a &quot;great gulf&quot; on its seaward side, and repairs costing £383 were necessary by 1583, completed by John Wadham of Catherston, MP and Recorder for Weymouth and “Captain of the Queen’s Majestie at Sandesfoot Castle” who died in 1584. During the invasion scare that accompanied the Spanish Armada of 1588, the normal garrison of Sandsfoot was supplemented by another 50 men.

===17th–19th centuries===

Repairs were made to the castle between 1610 and 1611 by the captain, Sir George Bampfield, at a cost of £211. A survey in 1623 carried out by Sir Richard Morryson showed the castle to be equipped with ten iron guns – one culverin, five demi-culverins, two sakers, a minion and a falcon – and garrisoned by its captain, five gunners and three soldiers. It was in a poor condition, and one corner of the gun platform had been undermined by the sea; Morryson&#x27;s team estimated the likely costs of repairs to amount to £459.

During the English Civil War between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, Weymouth was predominantly Parliamentarian in loyalty and the surrounding forts were held by their garrisons. Robert Dormer, the Earl of Carnarvon, entered Dorset with an army in 1643 and Weymouth surrendered, resulting in Sandsfoot Castle being controlled by the Royalists between August 1643 and June 1644. During this period the castle may have been used as a Royalist mint. Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex, then retook the county for Parliament; Colonel William Ashburnham, the Royalist governor of Weymouth, retreated to Portland Castle without a fight. Devereux approached Sandsfoot and, after three hours of negotiations, the fort surrendered to him. In 1647, Parliament ordered the garrison at the castle to be demobilised but this did not occur, and John Hayne was appointed as its new captain.

Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 and the next year a fresh order was given to demobilise the garrison at Sandsfoot. An argument then broke out between Humphrey Weld, the lieutenant-governor of Portland and captain of Sandsfoot Castle, and Charles Stewart, the Duke of Richmond, over the control of the local defences. The village of Wyke Regis petitioned Weld in a bid to prevent the demobilisation, concerned that their traditional exemptions from militia service would be revoked by the Duke. Weld championed their case but was dismissed from his post as lieutenant-governor, and the Duke occupied Sandsfoot with his militia. Weld appealed to the government and in 1665 a compromise was announced in which Weld would be reappointed to his role as lieutenant-governor, while Sandsfoot would be declared redundant and be demolished. The order for its destruction was never carried out, and the castle was used as a storehouse until at least 1691.
By 1725, the castle had become ruinous. Early in the century, the remains of the castle was sold to the town of Weymouth, whose people reused some of the stone to construct their new town bridge. Local tradition in the 19th century maintained that several houses in Weymouth were also constructed using stone taken from the castle. In 1825, the carved stone Elizabethan arms of the castle were moved to All Saints Church in Wyke Regis. Captains continued to be formally appointed, however, and Gabriel Stewart held the post as late as 1795.

The majority of the gun platform collapsed into the sea as the cliffs eroded. It is uncertain precisely when this occurred; in a prolonged historical debate over this during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the historian Henry Symonds argued that the first falls occurred during the 18th century, W. Norman placed the main fall in 1835, and T. Groves argued in favour of a more recent collapse in the second half of the 19th century. The ruined castle was drawn and painted by various artists in the 18th and 19th centuries, including Samuel Buck, J. H. Grimm, C. Sawyer and Edward Pritchard. The castle featured in Joseph Drew&#x27;s short novel &quot;the Poisoned Cup&quot; in 1876.

===20th–21st centuries===

In 1902, the Weymouth Corporation purchased the castle for the town from the Department of Woods and Forests for a total of £150. During the Second World War the castle housed an anti-aircraft battery as part of the defences created around Portland Harbour. Despite the construction of the Portland breakwaters nearby, the unstable clay cliffs remained vulnerable to erosion; in 1930 the ruins were closed to the public due to safety concerns and the remaining embrasure of the gun platform collapsed in the 1950s.

In 2009, £23,100 was awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund for an initial survey of the site, which by now had been placed on English Heritage&#x27;s register of listed buildings at risk of decline, followed by a further £194,700 in 2011 for substantial repair work. As part of the work, a three-dimensional laser scan of the stonework was undertaken, and a steel and oak walkway was installed around the interior of the castle. The castle reopened to the public in 2012, and the following year it was removed from English Heritage&#x27;s at risk register. The castle is protected under UK law as a grade II* listed building and as a scheduled monument.

The castle was once again closed to the public in 2021 after vertical cracks on an internal wall were found to have widened. Permanent metal fencing now surrounds the castle preventing public access.

==Architecture==

Sandsfoot Castle was built from Portland stone with ashlar facings and a rubble core. It comprised a main blockhouse attached to an octagonal gun room, overlooking the sea. The two-storey blockhouse is across, with a gate-tower on its landward side. It probably originally had four rooms for the accommodation and cooking facilities for the garrison, with staircases leading up to the first floor and down into its basement. The gate-tower held a small room on the first floor and was designed to hold a portcullis. The one-storey gun room was approximately across with five embrasures for guns and a flat roof that also probably supported artillery. Both the gun room and the main block were probably protected by parapets.

The gun room has been lost to erosion, although the south-western embrasure is still visible where it fell onto the beach below. The ashlar facings of the blockhouse have been largely robbed, although some elements remain, and the roof and floors have been lost. Historic England considers that the castle &quot;represents one of the most substantial examples&quot; of an unaltered 16th-century blockhouse in England.

The castle originally had an outer ward, reached over a bridge, and stables, although these have been both been lost. Protective rectangular earthworks were constructed to protect the castle on the landward side, probably in 1623, with two bastions in the north and west corners, and some form of stone structure along the earthworks. In the 18th century these earthworks were described as forming a &quot;deep trench&quot; and mid-19th century accounts suggested that they were around deep. Now only of the bank and ditch survives, with the earthworks approximately wide overall and deep between the top of the bank and the base of the ditch. The north bastion still survives largely intact, although the west has been mostly destroyed. Outside the entrance to the earthworks are the Sandsfoot Gardens, civic gardens dating from 1951, designed in a Tudor style with an ornamental pond.

<doc id="1037542" wikidata="Q300426" url="?curid=1037542" title="A Greek–English Lexicon">
<text>A Greek–English Lexicon, often referred to as Liddell &amp; Scott () or Liddell–Scott–Jones (LSJ), is a standard lexicographical work of the Ancient Greek language originally edited by Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, Henry Stuart Jones, and Roderick McKenzie and published in 1843 by the Oxford University Press. 

It was most recently revised for its ninth edition of 1940. Abridged versions and a supplement exist. It was initially the basis for the 2021 &quot;Cambridge Greek Lexicon&quot;, although subsequently that became a complete rewrite from scratch.

==Liddell and Scott&#x27;s lexicon (1843–1940)==
The lexicon was begun in the 19th century, and is now in its ninth (revised) edition, published in 1940. It was based on the earlier by the German lexicographer Franz Passow (first published in 1819, fourth edition 1831), which in turn was based on Johann Gottlob Schneider&#x27;s . The &quot;Lexicon&quot; has served as the basis for all later lexicographical work on the ancient Greek language, such as the ongoing Greek–Spanish dictionary project (DGE).

It is now conventionally referred to as &quot;Liddell &amp; Scott&quot;, &quot;Liddell–Scott–Jones&quot;, or &quot;LSJ&quot;, and its three sizes are sometimes referred to as &quot;The Little Liddell&quot;, &quot;The Middle Liddell&quot; and &quot;The Big Liddell&quot; or &quot;The Great Scott&quot;. The LSJ main edition has 116,502 entries.

According to Stuart Jones&#x27;s preface to the ninth (1925) edition, the creation of the &quot;Lexicon&quot; was originally proposed by David Alphonso Talboys, an Oxford publisher. It was published by the Clarendon Press at Oxford rather than by Talboys, who died before the first edition (1843) was complete. The second through seventh editions appeared in 1845, 1849, 1855, 1861, 1869, and 1883.

The first editor of the LSJ, Henry George Liddell, was Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, and the father of Alice Liddell, the eponymous Alice of the writings of Lewis Carroll. The eighth edition (1897) was the last edition published during Liddell&#x27;s lifetime.

The LSJ is sometimes compared and contrasted with &quot;A Latin Dictionary&quot; by Lewis and Short, which was also published by Oxford University Press (OUP). It is also sometimes compared with the Bauer lexicon, which is a similar work focused on the Greek of the New Testament.

The LSJ&#x27;s definitions reflect the Victorian morality of its time, using euphemism. For example, (, &#x27;to shit&#x27;), is translated as &quot;ease oneself, do one&#x27;s need&quot;; (, &#x27;to fuck&#x27;) as &quot;inire, coire, of illicit intercourse&quot;; and (, &#x27;to suck cocks&#x27;) as &quot;to wench&quot;.

===Condensed editions (1843, 1889)===
Two condensed editions of LSJ were published by Oxford University Press and remain in print.

In 1843, the same year as the full lexicon&#x27;s publication, &quot;A Lexicon: Abridged from Liddell and Scott&#x27;s Greek–English Lexicon&quot;, sometimes called &quot;the Little Liddell&quot; was published. Several revised editions followed. For example, a reprint, re-typeset in 2007, of the 1909 edition is available from Simon Wallenberg Press.

In 1889, an intermediate edition of the lexicon, &quot;An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon&quot;, was prepared on the basis of the seventh edition (1883) of LSJ. In comparison to the smaller abridgement, this &quot;Middle Liddell&quot; contains more entries covering the essential vocabulary of most commonly read Ancient Greek literature, adds citations of the authors to illustrate the history of Greek usage (without identifying the passages), and provides more help with irregular forms.

===The Supplement (1968)===
After the publication of the ninth edition in 1940, and shortly after the deaths of both Stuart Jones and McKenzie, the OUP maintained a list of (&quot;additions and corrections&quot;), which was bound with subsequent printings. However, in 1968, these were replaced by a Supplement to the LSJ. Neither the nor the Supplement has ever been merged into the main text, which still stands as originally composed by Liddell, Scott, Jones, and McKenzie. The Supplement was initially edited by M. L. West. Since 1981, it has been edited by P. G. W. Glare, editor of the &quot;Oxford Latin Dictionary&quot; (not to be confused with Lewis and Short&#x27;s &quot;A Latin Dictionary&quot;). Since 1988, it has been edited by Glare and Anne A. Thompson. As the title page of the &quot;Lexicon&quot; makes clear (and the prefaces to the main text and to the Supplement attest), this editorial work has been performed &quot;with the cooperation of many scholars&quot;.

The Supplement primarily takes the form of a list of additions and corrections to the main text, sorted by entry. The supplemental entries are marked with signs to show the nature of the changes they call for. Thus, a user of the &quot;Lexicon&quot; can consult the Supplement after consulting the main text to see whether scholarship after Jones and McKenzie has provided any new information about a particular word. , the most recent revision of the Supplement, published in 1996, contains 320 pages of corrections to the main text, as well as other materials.

Here is a typical entry from the revised Supplement:

The small &quot;x&quot; indicates that this word did not appear in the main text at all; &quot;S.&quot;fr&quot;.&quot; refers to the collected fragmentary works of Sophocles.

One interesting new source of lexicographic material in the revised Supplement is the Mycenean inscriptions. The 1996 revised Supplement&#x27;s Preface notes:

===Electronic editions===
The ninth edition of LSJ has been freely available in electronic form since 2007, having been digitized by the Perseus Project. Diogenes, a free software package, incorporates the Perseus data and allows easy offline consultation of LSJ on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux platforms. Marcion is another open source application that includes the Perseus LSJ.

For mobile devices, both the Kindle E-Ink and the iPhone/iPod Touch feature data ported from Perseus. The Android market also currently offers the intermediate LSJ as an offline downloadable app for free or for a small price. A CD-ROM version published and sold by Logos Bible Software also incorporates the Supplement&#x27;s additions to the ninth edition of LSJ. A new online version of LSJ was released in 2011 by the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG). The TLG version corrects &quot;a large number of typographical errors&quot;, and includes links to the extensive TLG textual corpus. A Kindle version, the &quot;Complete Liddell &amp; Scott&#x27;s Lexicon with Inflections&quot;, is also available: it allows searches of most Classical Greek word-forms and supports a growing number of Ancient/Classical Greek texts for the device.

===Translations===
The Lexicon has been translated into Modern Greek by Xenophon Moschos, ed.: Michael Konstantinidis and was published by Anestis Konstantinidis in 1904 with the title &quot;H. Liddell – R. Scott – Α.&quot; (). Reprinted also by other publishers. Also, a supplement compiled by a group of Greek philologists.&lt;br&gt;
An Italian translation of the &quot;Intermediate Liddell-Scott&quot;, entitled was published in 1975 by Le Monnier, edited by Q. Cataudella, M. Manfredi and F. Di Benedetto.

== &quot;Cambridge Greek Lexicon&quot; (2021) ==

LSJ was the basis of the project of John Chadwick and James Diggle at Cambridge to publish the &quot;Cambridge Greek Lexicon&quot; of 2021. Although it was initially conceived as a mere update of LSJ, the editors eventually decided to start afresh since they considered LSJ &quot;too antiquated in concept, design and content&quot;. The CGL has a smaller scope than the LSJ (and also the &quot;Brill Dictionary of Ancient Greek&quot;), and is unlikely to replace it; however, it is still more comprehensive than the Middle Liddell, which it intends to replace. The &quot;Cambridge Greek Lexicon&quot; uses contemporary language for its definitions and, unlike the LSJ, no longer elides the meaning of words considered offensive in Victorian times.

<doc id="1037544" wikidata="Q1753825" url="?curid=1037544" title="Wallerian degeneration">
<text>Wallerian degeneration is an active process of degeneration that results when a nerve fiber is cut or crushed and the part of the axon distal to the injury (which in most cases is farther from the neuron&#x27;s cell body) degenerates. A related process of dying back or retrograde degeneration known as &#x27;Wallerian-like degeneration&#x27; occurs in many neurodegenerative diseases, especially those where axonal transport is impaired such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Primary culture studies suggest that a failure to deliver sufficient quantities of the essential axonal protein NMNAT2 is a key initiating event. Some studies also have found irreversible electroporation, a potential clinical treatment being researched in porcine models to determine efficacy to treat spinal cord injuries, has contributed to Wallerian degeneration of lumbar nerve roots. 

Wallerian degeneration occurs after axonal injury in both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). It occurs in the section of the axon distal to the site of injury and usually begins within 24–36 hours of a lesion. Prior to degeneration, the distal section of the axon tends to remain electrically excitable. After injury, the axonal skeleton disintegrates, and the axonal membrane breaks apart. Axonal degeneration is followed by degradation of the myelin sheath and infiltration by macrophages. The macrophages, accompanied by Schwann cells, serve to clear the debris from the degeneration.

Schwann cells respond to loss of axons by extrusion of their myelin sheaths, downregulation of myelin genes, dedifferentiation and proliferation. They finally align in tubes (Büngner bands) and express surface molecules that guide regenerating fibers. Within 4 days of the injury, the distal end of the portion of the nerve fiber proximal to the lesion sends out sprouts towards those tubes and these sprouts are attracted by growth factors produced by Schwann cells in the tubes. If a sprout reaches the tube, it grows into it and advances about 1 mm per day, eventually reaching and reinnervating the target tissue. If the sprouts cannot reach the tube, for instance because the gap is too wide or scar tissue has formed, surgery can help to guide the sprouts into the tubes. Regeneration is efficient in the PNS, with near complete recovery in case of lesions that occur close to the distal nerve terminal. However recovery is hardly observed at all in the spinal cord. One crucial difference is that in the CNS, including the spinal cord, myelin sheaths are produced by oligodendrocytes and not by Schwann cells.

==History==
Wallerian degeneration is named after Augustus Volney Waller. Waller experimented on frogs in 1850, by severing their glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves. He then observed the distal nerves from the site of injury, which were separated from their cell bodies in the brain stem. Waller described the disintegration of myelin, which he referred to as &quot;medulla&quot;, into separate particles of various sizes. The degenerating axons formed droplets that could be stained, thus allowing for studies of the course of individual nerve fibres.

==Axonal degeneration==
Although most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts, axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration (AAD), which is rapid separation of the proximal (the part nearer the cell body) and distal ends within 30 minutes of injury. After separation, dystrophic bulb structures form at both terminals and the transected membranes are sealed. A brief latency phase occurs in the distal segment during which it remains electrically excitable and structurally intact. Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma, and eventually the formation of bead-like axonal spheroids. The process takes roughly 24 hours in the PNS, and longer in the CNS. The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are currently poorly understood. However, research has shown that this AAD process is calcium–independent.

Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner organelles occurs after axolemma degradation. Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the paranodal regions at the site of injury. Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate. The depolymerization of microtubules occurs and is soon followed by degradation of the neurofilaments and other cytoskeleton components. The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases (caused by influx of calcium ion), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process and not a passive one as previously misunderstood. Thus the axon undergoes complete fragmentation. The rate of degradation is dependent on the type of injury and is also slower in the CNS than in the PNS. Another factor that affects degradation rate is the diameter of the axon: larger axons require a longer time for the cytoskeleton to degrade and thus take a longer time to degenerate.

==Myelin clearance==
Myelin is a phospholipid membrane that wraps around axons to provide them with insulation. It is produced by Schwann cells in the PNS, and by oligodendrocytes in the CNS. Myelin clearance is the next step in Wallerian degeneration following axonal degeneration. The cleaning up of myelin debris is different for PNS and CNS. PNS is much faster and efficient at clearing myelin debris in comparison to CNS, and Schwann cells are the primary cause of this difference. Another key aspect is the change in permeability of the blood-tissue barrier in the two systems. In PNS, the permeability increases throughout the distal stump, but the barrier disruption in CNS is limited to just the site of injury.

===Clearance in PNS===
The response of Schwann cells to axonal injury is rapid. The time period of response is estimated to be prior to the onset of axonal degeneration. Neuregulins are believed to be responsible for the rapid activation. They activate ErbB2 receptors in the Schwann cell microvilli, which results in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Although MAPK activity is observed, the injury &quot;sensing&quot; mechanism of Schwann cells is yet to be fully understood. The &#x27;sensing&#x27; is followed by decreased synthesis of myelin lipids and eventually stops within 48 hrs. The myelin sheaths separate from the axons at the Schmidt-Lanterman incisures first and then rapidly deteriorate and shorten to form bead-like structures. Schwann cells continue to clear up the myelin debris by degrading their own myelin, phagocytose extracellular myelin and attract macrophages to myelin debris for further phagocytosis. However, the macrophages are not attracted to the region for the first few days; hence the Schwann cells take the major role in myelin cleaning until then.

Schwann cells have been observed to recruit macrophages by release of cytokines and chemokines after &quot;sensing&quot; of axonal injury. The recruitment of macrophages helps improve the clearing rate of myelin debris. The resident macrophages present in the nerves release further chemokines and cytokines to attract further macrophages. The degenerating nerve also produce macrophage chemotactic molecules. Another source of macrophage recruitment factors is serum. Delayed macrophage recruitment was observed in B-cell deficient mice lacking serum antibodies. These signaling molecules together cause an influx of macrophages, which peaks during the third week after injury. While Schwann cells mediate the initial stage of myelin debris clean up, macrophages come in to finish the job. Macrophages are facilitated by opsonins, which label debris for removal. The 3 major groups found in serum include complement, pentraxins, and antibodies. However, only complement has shown to help in myelin debris phagocytosis.

Murinson et al. (2005) observed that non-myelinated or myelinated Schwann cells in contact with an injured axon enter cell cycle thus leading to proliferation. Observed time duration for Schwann cell divisions were approximately 3 days after injury. Possible sources of proliferation signal are attributed to the ErbB2 receptors and the ErbB3 receptors. This proliferation could further enhance the myelin cleaning rates and plays an essential role in regeneration of axons observed in PNS. Schwann cells emit growth factors that attract new axonal sprouts growing from the proximal stump after complete degeneration of the injured distal stump. This leads to possible reinnervation of the target cell or organ. However, the reinnervation is not necessarily perfect, as possible misleading occurs during reinnervation of the proximal axons to target cells.

===Clearance in CNS===
In comparison to Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes require axon signals to survive. In their developmental stages, oligodendrocytes that fail to make contact to axon and receive axon signals undergo apoptosis.

Experiments in Wallerian degeneration have shown that upon injury oligodendrocytes either undergo programmed cell death or enter a state of rest. Therefore, unlike Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes fail to clean up the myelin sheaths and their debris. In experiments conducted on rats, myelin sheaths were found for up to 22 months. Therefore, CNS rates of myelin sheath clearance are very slow and could possibly be the cause for hindrance in the regeneration capabilities of the CNS axons as no growth factors are available to attract the proximal axons. Another feature that results eventually is glial scar formation. This further hinders chances for regeneration and reinnervation.

Oligodendrocytes fail to recruit macrophages for debris removal. Macrophage entry in general into CNS site of injury is very slow. In contrast to PNS, microglia play a vital role in CNS Wallerian degeneration. However, their recruitment is slower in comparison to macrophage recruitment in PNS by approximately 3 days. Further, microglia might be activated but hypertrophy, and fail to transform into fully phagocytic cells. Those microglia that do transform, clear out the debris effectively. Differentiating phagocytic microglia can be accomplished by testing for expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II during Wallerian degeneration. The rate of clearance is very slow among microglia in comparison to macrophages. Possible source for variations in clearance rates could include lack of opsonin activity around microglia, and the lack of increased permeability in the blood–brain barrier. The decreased permeability could further hinder macrophage infiltration to the site of injury.

These findings have suggested that the delay in Wallerian degeneration in CNS in comparison to PNS is caused not due to a delay in axonal degeneration, but rather is due to the difference in clearance rates of myelin in CNS and PNS.

==Regeneration==
Regeneration follows degeneration. Regeneration is rapid in PNS, allowing for rates of up to 1 millimeter a day of regrowth. Grafts may also be needed to allow for appropriate reinnervation. It is supported by Schwann cells through growth factors release. CNS regeneration is much slower, and is almost absent in most vertebrate species. The primary cause for this could be the delay in clearing up myelin debris. Myelin debris, present in CNS or PNS, contains several inhibitory factors. The prolonged presence of myelin debris in CNS could possibly hinder the regeneration. An experiment conducted on newts, animals that have fast CNS axon regeneration capabilities, found that Wallerian degeneration of an optic nerve injury took up to 10 to 14 days on average, further suggesting that slow clearance inhibits regeneration.

===Schwann cells and endoneural fibroblasts in PNS===
In healthy nerves, nerve growth factor (NGF) is produced in very small amounts. However, upon injury, NGF mRNA expression increases by five to seven-fold within a period of 14 days. Nerve fibroblasts and Schwann cells play an important role in increased expression of NGF mRNA. Macrophages also stimulate Schwann cells and fibroblasts to produce NGF via macrophage-derived interleukin-1. Other neurotrophic molecules produced by Schwann cells and fibroblasts together include brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, insulin-like growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor. These factors together create a favorable environment for axonal growth and regeneration. Apart from growth factors, Schwann cells also provide structural guidance to further enhance regeneration. During their proliferation phase, Schwann cells begin to form a line of cells called &quot;Bands of Bungner&quot; within the basal laminar tube. Axons have been observed to regenerate in close association to these cells. Schwann cells upregulate the production of cell surface adhesion molecule ninjurin further promoting growth. These lines of cell guide the axon regeneration in proper direction. The possible source of error that could result from this is possible mismatching of the target cells as discussed earlier.

Due to lack of such favorable promoting factors in CNS, regeneration is stunted in CNS.

==Wallerian degeneration slow==
Mice belonging to the strain C57BL/&quot;Wlds&quot; have delayed Wallerian degeneration, and, thus, allow for the study of the roles of various cell types and the underlying cellular and molecular processes. Current understanding of the process has been possible via experimentation on the &quot;Wlds&quot; strain of mice. The mutation occurred first in mice in Harlan-Olac, a laboratory producing animals the United Kingdom. The &quot;Wlds&quot; mutation is an autosomal-dominant mutation occurring in the mouse chromosome 4. The gene mutation is an 85-kb tandem triplication, occurring naturally. The mutated region contains two associated genes: nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1) and ubiquitination factor e4b (UBE4B). A linker region encoding 18 amino acids is also part of the mutation. The protective effect of the WldS protein has been shown to be due to the NMNAT1 region&#x27;s NAD+ synthesizing active site.

Although the protein created localizes within the nucleus and is barely detectable in axons, studies suggest that its protective effect is due to its presence in axonal and terminal compartments. The protection provided by the WldS protein is intrinsic to the neurons and not surrounding support cells, and is only locally protective of the axon, indicating an intracellular pathway is responsible for mediating Wallerian degeneration.

===Effects of the WldS mutation===
The mutation causes no harm to the mouse. The only known effect is that the Wallerian degeneration is delayed by up to three weeks on average after injury of a nerve. At first, it was suspected that the &quot;Wlds&quot; mutation slows down the macrophage infiltration, but recent studies suggest that the mutation protects axons rather than slowing down the macrophages. The process by which the axonal protection is achieved is poorly understood. However, studies suggest that the &quot;Wlds&quot; mutation leads to increased NMNAT1 activity, which leads to increased NAD+ synthesis. This in turn activates SIRT1-dependent process within the nucleus, causing changes in gene transcription. NAD+ by itself may provide added axonal protection by increasing the axon&#x27;s energy resources. More recent work, however, raises doubt that either NMNAT1 or NAD+ can substitute for the full length &quot;Wlds&quot; gene. These authors demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo methods that the protective effect of overexpression of NMNAT1 or the addition of NAD+ did not protect axons from degeneration. However, later studies showed that NMNAT1 is protective when combined with an axonal targeting peptide, suggesting that the key to the protection provided by WldS was the combination of NMNAT1&#x27;s activity and the axonal localization provided by the N-terminal domain of the chimeric protein.

The provided axonal protection delays the onset of Wallerian degeneration. Schwann cell activation should therefore be delayed, as they would not detect axonal degradation signals from ErbB2 receptors. In experiments on &quot;Wlds&quot; mutated mice, macrophage infiltration was considerably delayed by up to six to eight days. However, once the axonal degradation has begun, degeneration takes its normal course, and, respective of the nervous system, degradation follows at the above-described rates. Possible effects of this late onset are weaker regenerative abilities in the mice. Studies indicate that regeneration may be impaired in &quot;WldS&quot; mice, but this is likely a result of the environment being unfavorable for regeneration due to the continued existence of the undegenerated distal fiber, whereas normally debris is cleared, making way for new growth.

== SARM1==

The Wallerian degeneration pathway has been further illuminated by the discovery that sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (SARM1) protein plays a central role in the Wallerian degeneration pathway. The gene was first identified in a &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; mutagenesis screen, and subsequently knockouts of its homologue in mice showed robust protection of transected axons comparable to that of WldS.

SARM1 catalyzes the synthesis and hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD+ to ADP-ribose. SARM1 activation locally triggers a rapid collapse of NAD+ levels in the distal section of the injured axon, which then undergoes degeneration. This collapse in NAD+ levels was later shown to be due to SARM1&#x27;s TIR domain having intrinsic NAD+ cleavage activity. The SARM1 protein has four domains, a mitochondrial localization signal, an auto-inhibitory N-terminus region consisting of armadillo/HEAT motifs, two sterile alpha motifs responsible for multimerization, and a C-terminus Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor that possesses enzymatic activity. Activation of SARM1 is sufficient to collapse NAD+ levels and initiate the Wallerian degeneration pathway.

The activity of SARM1 helps to explain the protective nature of the survival factor NMNAT2, as NMNAT enzymes have been shown to prevent SARM1-mediated depletion of NAD+. This relationship is further supported by the fact that mice lacking NMNAT2, which are normally not viable, are completely rescued by SARM1 deletion, placing NMNAT2 activity upstream of SARM1. Other pro-degeneration signaling pathways, such as the MAP kinase pathway, have been linked to SARM1 activation. MAPK signaling has been shown to promote the loss of NMNAT2, thereby promoting SARM1 activation, although SARM1 activation also triggers the MAP kinase cascade, indicating some form of feedback loop exists. One explanation for the protective effect of the WldS mutation is that the NMNAT1 region, which is normally localized to the soma, substitutes for the labile survival factor NMNAT2 to prevent SARM1 activation when the N-terminal Ube4 region of the WldS protein localizes it to the axon. The fact that the enhanced survival of WldS axons is due to the slower turnover of WldS compared to NMNAT2 also helps explain why SARM1 knockout confers longer protection, as SARM1 will be completely inactive regardless of inhibitor activity whereas WldS will eventually be degraded. Possibles implications of the SARM1 pathway in regard to human health may be found in animal models which exhibit traumatic brain injury, as mice which contain &quot;Sarm1&quot; deletions in addition to WldS show decreased axonal damage following injury. Specific mutations in NMNAT2 have linked the Wallerian degeneration mechanism to two neurological diseases.
