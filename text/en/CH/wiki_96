<text>Nicolas Alfred Hager (born 1958) is a New Zealand investigative journalist. He has produced seven books since 1996, covering topics such as intelligence networks, environmental issues and politics. He is one of two New Zealand members of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

==Early life==
Hager was born in Levin to a middle-class &quot;socially aware&quot; family. His father was from Vienna, Austria, a clothing manufacturer who emigrated to New Zealand as a refugee from the Nazis. His mother was born in Zanzibar (part of Tanzania), where her father studied tropical medicine, and later grew up in Kenya and Uganda. His surname &quot;Hager&quot; is pronounced Har-gar, rhyming with &quot;lager&quot;.

Hager studied physics at Victoria University of Wellington, where he also did an honours degree in philosophy. He stood as a Values Party candidate for Pahiatua in the 1978 general election.

==Early career==
After graduating from university, Hager worked at the ecology division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), and later worked with his brother-in-law building and renovating houses.

==Journalism career==
Hager is an investigative journalist who has written seven books. , the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), an international network that has 249 investigative reporters in over 90 countries, has Hager as one of only two New Zealand members.

Hager works on a number of projects at any given time, gathering information about them and looks for sources and mentors. Some projects &quot;come together&quot; but others can continue for a number of years.

===&quot;Secret Power&quot;===
&quot;Secret Power: New Zealand&#x27;s Role in the International Spy Network&quot;, published in 1996, was Hager&#x27;s first book.

The book investigates various spying techniques, including signals intelligence (Sigint), a form of electronic eavesdropping between countries. The information was taken from interviews with staff in New Zealand&#x27;s Sigint agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), who revealed the workings of the agency in minute detail: the intelligence targets, equipment, operating procedures, security systems and training, as well as the staff and layout of the intelligence agency&#x27;s facilities. The book makes special mention of GCSB&#x27;s facilities at Waihopai and Tangimoana.

It revealed aspects of New Zealand&#x27;s participation in the UKUSA Agreement facilitating intelligence gathering and sharing between the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Since the Edward Snowden revelations, this partnership has become more commonly known as the Five Eyes.

As a result, the insights into the inner workings of the GCSB provide information about the allied agencies as well. In particular, Hager documented the US-coordinated ECHELON system, through which the five agencies intercept and process huge volumes of international e-mail, fax and telephone communications. Hager was one of the earliest to write about the secretive ECHELON worldwide electronic spy network. As a result of his book, in 2001 he testified before the European Parliament on his research into the network.
The book contained two forewords, one written by former New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange and one by Jeffrey T. Richelson, a leading author on U.S. intelligence agencies and the author of the books &quot;America&#x27;s Secret Eyes in the Sky&quot; and &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;.

===&quot;Secrets and Lies&quot;===

&quot;Secrets and Lies: The Anatomy of an Anti-Environmental PR Campaign&quot; was co-authored with Bob Burton and published in 1999. It documents the public relations information put out by Timberlands West Coast Limited in order to win public support for logging of native forests on the West Coast of New Zealand.

The material is based on a large amount of documentation leaked by a staff member from the local branch of Shandwick (now Weber Shandwick Worldwide), a global public relations company, which had been hired by Timberlands to run a secret campaign against environmental groups such as Native Forest Action between 1997 and 1999.

The book describes its tactics of surveillance of meetings, monitoring the press and responding to every letter to the editor, greenwashing, the use of strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPPs), cleaning anti-logging graffiti and blotting out campaign posters in public places, and managing to install its pro-logging educational materials into schools.

The year after the book&#x27;s publication, the new Labour government passed the Forests (West Coast Accord) Act 2000, which halted the logging of publicly owned native forests and provided a $120 million transition package for the West Coast economy.

===&quot;Seeds of Distrust&quot;===

&quot;Seeds of Distrust: The Story of a GE Cover-up&quot; was a study of government processes and decision-making under New Zealand&#x27;s Labour-led government. 
The book details an incident in November 2000, during the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification, when government officials were alerted to evidence of an accidental release of genetically modified corn plants, which was illegal under New Zealand law. The book traces the stages of industry lobbying and government decision making leading up to a decision to regard the incident as insignificant and keep it secret from the public.

The book was released in July 2002, just as a snap election was called, and helped make genetically modified organisms a major election issue.

At a media conference of government officials convened immediately after the book&#x27;s release, the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment, Barry Carbon, conceded that the book was largely accurate but disputed the interpretation of the material.

The Christchurch newspaper &quot;The Press&quot; studied the official documents and concluded:
===&quot;The Hollow Men&quot;===
In November 2006 Hager&#x27;s book &quot;The Hollow Men: A Study in the Politics of Deception&quot; was published. The book details a wide range of National Party internal party documents including emails which were leaked by six National Party insiders. The documents were written by the party leader Don Brash and a wide range of people associated with him.

The origin of the book was the exposing of Exclusive Brethren secret funding of National Party election advertising during the 2005 general election. It describes the National Party strategy discussions and the techniques the party advisors used to try to win the 2005 national elections. The thinking behind major speeches, media management, election advertising and election messages is shown in the participants&#x27; own words. Many of the party&#x27;s previously anonymous major donors are identified and relations with them are documented.

The book was initially prevented from being published when Brash obtained an injunction preventing anyone from publishing material from emails that had been stolen from him. At the time Brash was unaware that Hager had completed and was about to launch his book. However, on 23 November 2006, Brash announced his resignation from the leadership of the National Party. The following day he had the injunction lifted, allowing the book to be released.

The Hollow Men was made into a theatrical piece by playwright Dean Parker. Hager assisted with the feature-length documentary of the book, made by Alister Barry, that was released in July 2008.

===&quot;Other People&#x27;s Wars&quot;===
In August 2011 Hager published &quot;Other People&#x27;s Wars&quot;, an investigation into New Zealand&#x27;s role in the &quot;War on Terror&quot;. Using leaked military information, Hager highlights the difference between what New Zealand was told about its role in Afghanistan and Iraq, and what the leaked documents show.

The book demonstrates the role of public relations in blurring the lines between the idea of military as a public service and the agendas that the New Zealand Defence Force was orchestrating for foreign interests. Hager concludes that New Zealand needs greater accountability and neutrality in its armed forces. 

It was recognised internationally, with investigative journalist Seymour Hersh stating in a review, &quot;Nicky Hager has more knowledge and understanding of the American intelligence world in Afghanistan – both its good and its very bad points – than any reporter I know.&quot;

&quot;Other People’s Wars&quot; was also adapted into a play by Dean Parker in 2012.

In late November 2022, the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS) apologised to Hager and paid NZ$66,400 in compensation and legal fees after it illegally accessed his phone records in 2012. The spy agency believed that a member of the Defence Force had illegally provided Hager with information for his book &quot;Other People&#x27;s War&quot;. The NZSIS had seized two months&#x27; worth of his home phone&#x27;s metadata in an attempt to track down the NZDF member. Ultimately, the phone data found no link between Hager and the suspected NZDF member. In August 2019, the acting Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security found that the spy agency had no reasonable grounds for suspecting espionage and had failed to exercise caution when investigating Hager&#x27;s source.

===&quot;Dirty Politics&quot;===
In August 2014, Hager published &quot;Dirty Politics: How attack politics is poisoning New Zealand’s political environment&quot;, featuring leaked emails between National Party figures and right-wing bloggers. According to Hager the book aims to tell the story of &quot;how attack politics is poisoning NZ&#x27;s political environment&quot;.

Among the claims in the book are that during the 2011 election campaign a right-wing blogger, Cameron Slater, who is the son of former National Party President John Slater, obtained a database of Labour Party members, emails and donations which were used to attack the Labour Party. Also in 2011 the PM&#x27;s office used its knowledge of secret SIS documents to tip off a right-wing blogger and arrange an attack on Labour leader Phil Goff, and drafted Official Information Act requests for a right-wing blogger to use in other attacks.

In mid-June 2018, Hager accepted an apology and compensation for &quot;substantial damages&quot; from the New Zealand Police for raiding his home in 2014 as part of their investigation into the hacking that led to the &quot;Dirty Politics&quot; book. The Police also acknowledged accessing his financial records as part of the apology settlement.

===Jordan Williams&#x27; lawsuit against Colin Craig===

On 21 September 2016, Nicky Hager was subpoenaed by Colin Craig&#x27;s lawyers to testify as part of the latter&#x27;s defence in a defamation suit filed by Jordan Williams, the co-founder of the New Zealand Taxpayers&#x27; Union. Hager had initially volunteered to give evidence, however decided he did not want to after Mr Williams gave evidence in relation to Craig&#x27;s treatment of his former press secretary, Rachel MacGregor. Craig gave evidence that he had read Hager&#x27;s book &quot;Dirty Politics&quot; before producing his pamphlet &quot;Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas&quot;, which was found to have defamed Williams. Hager took the stand as an expert witness and alleged that publications linked to Jordan Williams on Cameron Slater&#x27;s blog attacked Craig and followed a similar pattern that had been documented in his book. After testifying for fifteen minutes, Hager was not cross-examined by Williams&#x27; lawyers and was allowed to leave by the judge.

===&quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot;===

In March 2017, Hager and fellow journalist Jon Stephenson published &quot;Hit &amp; Run: The New Zealand SAS in Afghanistan and the meaning of honour&quot;. The book explored the New Zealand Special Air Service&#x27;s involvement in Operation Burnham, a retaliatory military raid on two Afghan villages, Naik and Khak Khuday Dad, in Afghanistan&#x27;s Tirgiran Valley in August 2010. The NZSAS soldiers had attacked a village while pursuing Taliban fighters following the death of a New Zealand soldier in a roadside bomb. According to Hager and Stephenson, none of the fighters were found but 15 civilians were wounded and six killed. The authors asserted that the NZSAS actions could be considered war crimes and alleged a cover up by the New Zealand Defence Force.

The New Zealand Defence Force Chief Lieutenant-General Tim Keating challenged the book&#x27;s accuracy and denied that NZ forces had operated in the Naik and Khak Khuday Dad villages. He asserted that the raid had taken place at the nearby &quot;Tirgiran Valley village&quot; and that the raid was carried out to protect New Zealand&#x27;s Provincial Reconstruction Team in neighbouring Bamiyan Province. In response, the Tirgiran Valley villagers&#x27; lawyers including Richard McLeod responded that &quot;Tirgiran Valley village&quot; did not exist and challenged Keating&#x27;s assertions. Hager and Stephenson acknowledged getting the exact location of the villages wrong but asserted that other information including the villages&#x27; names were correct. In late March 2017, the Tirgiran Valley villagers&#x27; lawyers McLeod, Rodney Harrison, and Deborah Manning requested that the New Zealand Government undertake a formal inquiry into the events at Naik and Khak Khuday Dad villages.

Hager and Stephenson&#x27;s book attracted considerable media coverage and commentary in New Zealand. University of Otago law professor Andrew Geddis opined that Operation Burnham damaged the NZDF&#x27;s trust and credibility. Left-wing blogger Martyn &quot;Bomber&quot; Bradbury supported Hager and Stephenson&#x27;s assertions that New Zealand forces had committed war crimes. The conservative blogger Matthew Hooton, Amnesty International New Zealand&#x27;s Executive Director Grant Bayldon, and Fairfax political editor Tracey Watkins supported calls for an independent inquiry into New Zealand war crimes. The-then Prime Minister Bill English rejected calls for an inquiry into NZSAS actions on the grounds of inaccuracies in &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot;. In August 2017, the Afghan villagers&#x27; three lawyers took the New Zealand Government to court over its refusal to hold an inquiry into Operation Burnham.

Following the formation of a new Labour-New Zealand First-Greens coalition government after the 2017 general election, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Defence Minister Ron Mark announced in early November that they would hold an inquiry into the allegations raised by &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot;. On 13 March 2018, the New Zealand Defence Force confirmed that the location of an Afghan village mentioned in the book &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot; was the same place where the NZSAS raid Operation Burnham took place but maintained that claims of civilian casualties were &quot;unfounded.&quot; On 19 March, the NZDF confirmed that the photos published in &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot; were taken in the same location where Operation Burnham had taken place.

On 9 April 2018, the Chief Ombudsman Peter Boshier ruled in favour of the New Zealand Defense Force&#x27;s decision to withhold most of the information relating to Operation Burnham. On 11 April, Attorney-General David Parker announced that the Government would be holding an inquiry into Operation Burnham and the allegations in &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot;.

===IGIS Reference Group===
On 16 April 2018, Nicky Hager was appointed as a member of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security&#x27;s Reference Group, an advisory group of journalists, lawyers, academics, and advocates that would scrutinise the legality of the actions of New Zealand&#x27;s intelligence agencies, the NZSIS and GCSB. Hager&#x27;s appointment was criticised by the National Party&#x27;s GCSB and NZSIS spokesperson Gerry Brownlee, who pointed to his previous criticism of the NZSIS.

==Honours and awards==
In the 2023 King&#x27;s Birthday and Coronation Honours, Hager was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to investigative journalism.

==Personal life==
Hager lives in Wellington in a house that he built.

<text>Montauban-de-Picardie (, literally &quot;Montauban of Picardie&quot;; ) is a commune in the Somme department in Hauts-de-France in northern France. Its inhabitants are called &quot;Montalbanais&quot; in French.

==Geography==
The commune is situated on the D64 road, some northeast of Amiens.
==History==

===First World War===
The village lies on the First World War battlefield of the Somme. Montauban lay close behind the German front-line and was turned into a fortified strongpoint. On 1 July 1916, the first day on the Somme, the village was seized by the British 30th Division in one of the few successful British advances of the day. In the village itself there is a monument to the Liverpool and Manchester &#x27;Pals&#x27;, who, as part of the 30th Division, were the first to reach the village.

<doc id="1041129" wikidata="Q1193299" url="?curid=1041129" title="Temminck's lark">
<text>Temminck&#x27;s lark (Eremophila bilopha) or Temminck&#x27;s horned lark, is a bird species of the family Alaudidae. It breeds across much of north Africa, through northern Saudi Arabia to western Iraq. It is mainly resident, but some populations of this passerine bird are partially migratory, moving further south in winter. This bird&#x27;s common name commemorates the Dutch naturalist Coenraad Jacob Temminck. The population is declining in Israel and may also be declining elsewhere, probably as a result of habitat loss. Nevertheless, this is a common bird in many parts of its wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Temminck&#x27;s lark was originally placed in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot; before being re-classified to &quot;Eremophila&quot;.

==Description==
Unlike most other larks, Temminck&#x27;s lark is a distinctive looking species on the ground, similar to the other, larger, member of its genus, the horned lark. The adult is mainly reddish brown-grey above and pale below, and it has a striking black and white face pattern and a distinctive black patch on its breast. The summer male has black &quot;horns&quot;, which give this species its alternative name. The juvenile of this species is reddish above and pale below, quite unlike the juvenile horned lark. The adult Temminck&#x27;s lark differs from the horned lark in its reddish, rather than brown-grey plumage, and the lack of yellow in the face pattern. It has a similar but less harsh metallic call.

==Distribution and habitat==
Temminck&#x27;s lark is native to North Africa and the Middle East. Its range includes Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia and Western Sahara.

This lark is a bird of open stony semi-desert. Its nest is on the ground, with two to four eggs being laid. Its food is seeds supplemented with insects in the breeding season.

<text>Listed below are the dates and results for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] qualification rounds for [[CONCACAF|North, Central America and the Caribbean]]. A total of 34 teams took part (out of 35 eligible – only Puerto Rico declined to participate), competing for 3.5 places in the World Cup.

The qualification process was divided in four stages. In the first stage, the 34 teams were divided in 10 groups of three teams each and two groups of two teams each. Groups with three teams had two rounds, with the best ranked team according to FIFA in each group entering the competition in the second round. In each group, teams were paired 2-by-2 and played home-and-away matches.

The 12 winners of the second stage advanced to the third stage, where they were divided into three groups of four teams each. Teams in each group would play against each other home-and-away, and the two teams with most points in each group would advance to the final round.

In the fourth stage, the six teams were put in a single group, and played against each other home-and-away. The three teams with most points qualified to the World Cup. The fourth placed team advanced to the AFC–CONCACAF play-off against the winner of a play-off between third placed teams in the third round of Asia.

==Format==
The first and second rounds reduced the 34 entrants to 24 and 12 teams, respectively. The remaining 12 teams were then placed into three third round groups of four, with the top two teams in each group advancing to the fourth and final qualification group. The third round began in August 2004 and ended in November 2004. The top three teams from the fourth round group of six (held from February 2005 to October 2005) qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The fourth-placed team competed in a home-and-away play-off against the fifth-placed team from Asia.

<doc id="1041133" wikidata="Q383054" url="?curid=1041133" title="Tullamarine Freeway">
<text>The Tullamarine Freeway (commonly referred to as The Tulla), is a major urban freeway in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, linking Melbourne Airport to the Melbourne City Centre. It carries up to 210,000 vehicles per day and is one of Australia&#x27;s busiest freeways. The entire stretch of the Tullamarine Freeway bears the designation M2 (previously Metro Route 43 from 1989 to early 2018).

==Route==
The Tullamarine Freeway starts just outside Melbourne Airport, where it intersects with Sunbury Road, and runs southeast as a six-lane dual-carriageway freeway through Gladstone Park, eventually meeting with the Western Ring Road in a major interchange. Heading further south as eight lanes, it skirts the western and southern boundaries of Essendon Airport through Airport West, where it meets the Calder Freeway and widens further to ten lanes. East of the intersection with Bulla Road, it officially becomes CityLink&#x27;s Western link, running south to eventually meet the West Gate Freeway in Port Melbourne: before being subsumed into CityLink in 1999, the southern end of the Tullamarine Freeway ran south through the Moonee Ponds Creek reserve to terminate just north of central Melbourne in Parkville.

The section through Airport West is frequently congested due to the combination of freight traffic to/from the Hume Highway (accessed from the Western Ring Road interchange), and traffic to/from the airport. The usual peak period travel time is between 19 and 30 minutes.

==History==
The Tullamarine Freeway is one of the oldest freeways in Melbourne. The core of the freeway through Airport West began as a deviation of Lancefield Road from the north-west of Essendon Airport, constructed during the 1945/46 financial year as a new single carriageway along the western and southern boundaries of the airport, east of the existing service road (today Matthews Avenue) and tram-way, totalling , planned to reconnect at Sunbury Road (today Bulla Road) in Essendon North. A satisfactory alignment at the eastern end could not be obtained without the demolition of numerous residences however, therefore only the section following the western boundary of the aerodrome was constructed, with a temporary connection to Melbourne-Bendigo Road (today Keilor Road) via Treadwell Road, Essendon North; the rest of the deviation to Sunbury Road was built during the 1959/60 financial year as a dual-carriageway road. Lancefield Road was progressively duplicated during the 1960s, including from Treadwell Road to north of Vaughan Street, and from Hawker Street to Parer Road.

The first stage of construction on a new Tullamarine By-pass Road was completed in the 1965/66 financial year, between Mickleham Road and &quot;the Tullamarine Jetport Terminal area&quot; (Melbourne Airport), with the initial section between Tullamarine Airport and Lancefield Road at the north-western corner of Essendon Airport officially opening early in 1968. From Essendon, a new section heading east from Lancefield Road at Bulla Road, over Pascoe Vale Road, to link directly with Bell Street, incorporating 2 miles of divided road and 4 miles of ramps and known at the time as Strathmore By-pass Road, began construction early in 1968, with further construction to extend the freeway south along the Moonee Ponds Creek reserve to Mount Alexander Road at Flemington Bridge, carried out by the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW). All three sections - the Tullamarine By-pass Road, the Strathmore By-pass Road, and the MMBW&#x27;s southern extension to Flemington Bridge - were officially opened as the Tullamarine Freeway on 3 February 1970, by Premier of Victoria Sir Henry Bolte MLA, in time for the official opening of Tullamarine Airport (now renamed Melbourne Airport) in mid-1970; this new section replaced Mount Alexander Road as the main route to the city. In 1974, the section constructed by the MMBW was transferred to be under the direct responsibility of the Country Roads Board; the Board&#x27;s declaration of the Tullamarine Freeway was extended to Flemington Bridge as a direct result. In 1979, the section of Lancefield Road running along the western edge of Essendon Airport was upgraded to freeway standard, with the elimination of all at-grade intersections (at English and Vaughan Streets, and an access road to Matthews Avenue near Parer Road), and the opening of a grade-separated, diamond-interchange with English Street, effectively completing the freeway.

With its completion, city-bound heavy vehicles from Hume Highway were diverted here via Pascoe Vale Road. In the 1990s, the completion of the Western Ring Road increased traffic tremendously. It was only relieved by the completion of CityLink in 1999, widening the freeway to 8 lanes (two of these being transit lanes) and extending it south to the West Gate Freeway at Port Melbourne. The improved sections, starting east of Bulla Road, were subsumed into CityLink as the northern half of the Western link, and are now tolled.

Lancefield Road was signed as Metropolitan Route 40 between Essendon North and Tullamarine in 1965, with Metropolitan Route 40 continuing north along Sunbury Road to eventually terminate in Bulla. When the Tullamarine By-pass Road opened in 1968 between Essendon Airport and Tullamarine Airport, Metropolitan Route 40 was re-routed onto the new freeway. It was re-routed again from Bell Street onto the Strathmore By-pass Road section of the freeway, once it and the Bell Street interchange opened in 1970. Once the Tullamarine Freeway southern extension opened in 1970, the entire freeway from Tullamarine to Travancore was signed as Freeway Route 81, sharing concurrency with Metropolitan Route 40 from Tullamarine to Pascoe Vale South, and also another concurrency with National Route 79 from Essendon North to Travancore once the Calder Freeway bypass of Niddrie opened in 1972. Metropolitan Route 40 was re-routed onto Calder Freeway in 1989: Metropolitan Route 43 replaced it from Essendon North to Tullamarine in 1989, while Freeway Route 81 was abolished in the same year. When CityLink opened in 1999, Metropolitan Route 43 was extended along the entire freeway, including the Western link, to its end in Port Melbourne. With Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, the vestige of National Route 79 was finally abolished in 2013 (Calder Freeway had already converted to M79 in 1997), and conversion of Metropolitan Route 43 to route M2 began, finally completed in 2018. The concurrency with Metropolitan Route 40 was abolished in 2020, when it was re-aligned to terminate at Bell Street interchange.

The freeway is used by SkyBus services to Melbourne Airport, and in 2002 the Victorian government contributed $3 million to a $10 million plan to expand and improve these services, after a feasibility study into an airport rail link found the number of passengers using a train would not make the scheme economically viable.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared Tullamarine Freeway (Freeway #1810) from Melbourne-Lancefield Road (today Sunbury Road) at Melbourne Airport to Mount Alexander Road (sign-posted as Bulla Road) in Strathmore, south of Essendon Airport.

Upgrades to the interchange with Calder Freeway were announced in January 2005, which underwent dramatic reconstruction to alleviate congestion. Entry and exit ramps between both freeways were decommissioned and replaced, an additional two lanes inbound were added, with dedicated Bulla Road-Calder Freeway spurs to eliminate weaving, notorious for many accidents in the area; the new inbound lanes towards the city were completed in October 2006 (ten months early), and new outbound lanes towards Melbourne airport were completed in February 2007 (five months early). Another project completed later that year was a new bridge and northern entrance to the Essendon Airport through the interchange of Melrose Drive, to provide easy access for the people living in the northern suburbs to access the Essendon Airport district. Both projects were planned, designed and constructed under an alliance agreement between VicRoads, Baulderstone Hornibrook and Parsons Brinckerhoff.

===1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan===
The freeway was originally designated in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as the F14 Freeway corridor.

== CityLink–Tulla Widening (2015–2018)==
=== Project Overview ===
In August 2015 a proposal to Widen the Citylink and Tullamarine Freeway was put in order which consists of 2 Stages which would increase the road&#x27;s daily capacity as well as shorten trips between Melbourne Airport and The CBD During Morning Peak and Afternoon Peak Times. The following upgrades started in October 2015 (Stage 1) and May 2016 (Stage 2). The entire project was completed in late 2018.

==== Stage 1 (Bulla Road to Power Street) ====
* Lane use management signs to manage which lanes are open
* Variable speed limit signs above all lanes
* Ramp signalling – stop and go traffic lights to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion as traffic enters the freeway from on-ramps
* CCTV cameras – to monitor for incidents, help response times and minimise disruptions
* Travel time information signs so people can plan their journey
* Electronic message signs – to notify road users of planned changes or disruptions
* Automatic incident detection system – to alert Road Managers incidents in real time
* 2 Dedicated Lanes Inbound to Bell Street from the Tullamarine Freeway and Calder Freeway
* New Bell Street to Pascoe Vale Road
* Improvements To Flemington Road/ Mount Alexander Road Freeway Interchange
* Additional Outbound Lane Between Moreland and Ormond Road
* Ramp Widening Between Bolte Bridge and West Gate Freeway
* One Additional Inbound Lane between Montague Street and Ingles Street
* One Additional Inbound Lane between Montague Street and Power Street

==== Stage 2 (Melbourne Airport to Bulla Road) ==== 
* A new structure with dedicated lanes from the Tullamarine Freeway and Mickleham Road to the M80 Ring Road inbound to ease congestion and reduce traffic weaving 
* An extra lane entering the Tullamarine Freeway city bound from Mickleham Road 
* Reconstruction and widening of the English Street overpass and all ramps to increase capacity into and out of Essendon Fields 
* Ramp signals on the city bound entry from Kings Road in Taylors Lakes to the Tulla Calder interchange to regulate the flow of traffic getting onto the Tullamarine Freeway from the Calder Freeway

==== Extra Lanes ====
Part of The Upgrade is adding more lanes between Melbourne Airport and the West Gate Freeway. Between The Citylink (Western Link) and The West Gate Freeway one additional lane in each direction will be added consuming the emergency lanes as well as lower the speed limit from 100 km/h down to 80 km/h. New Emergency Stopping Bays Similar to the Monash Freeway&#x27;s Emergency Stopping Bays will be provided where Possible.

<text>Forbidden Love (called Honor Lost: Love and Death in Modern Day Jordan in the United States) is a 2003 book 
written by Norma Khouri, purporting to tell a true story about her best friend in Jordan, Dalia. The story describes Dalia&#x27;s love for a Christian soldier, Michael, which is kept secret from her Muslim father due to conflicts in religion. Her father eventually finds out, and stabs Dalia to death in a so-called honor killing. A year after publication, it was discovered that the story was entirely fabricated by Khouri.

==Plot summary==
The novel centers on the life of Dalia, a young Muslim woman living in Amman, Jordan. When she falls in love with Michael, a young Catholic major in the British Army, she is forced to keep the relationship a secret and rely on her friend Norma to act as an intermediary. Although the lovers are only able to be alone together on a handful of occasions and Dalia&#x27;s virginity remains intact, her father is so enraged when he hears of the affair from her older brother that he kills her two months after her twenty-sixth birthday. Khouri claimed that as a result, she had been forced to seek asylum in Queensland, Australia.

==Hoax scandal==
Questions about Khouri&#x27;s story surfaced almost immediately. Several readers wrote on message boards that much of the book didn&#x27;t ring true, and others located 73 factual errors, anachronisms, and exaggerations (e.g. claiming that Jordan borders Kuwait, &quot;fanciful&quot; depictions of Amman, incorrect statements about Jordanian law, and banknotes that were not printed at the time the book supposedly took place). Khouri also aroused suspicions because she spoke perfect American English, despite her claims to have never lived in the United States. 

Further, Khouri had promised to donate most of the proceeds to the Jordanian National Association for Women, but had only sent $100, while the group was suspicious of her claims from the start, contending that it would have known about such a crime given Jordan&#x27;s size. 

After conducting an investigation, they wrote to Random House Australia in September 2003, but Random House stood by Khouri.

In July 2004, a year after the book&#x27;s release, &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; literary editor Malcolm Knox wrote a series of articles that exposed Khouri as a complete fraud. Based on an 18-month investigation, he concluded Khouri had fabricated the story and sold it untruthfully as a memoir. 

Khouri had not lived in Jordan since 1973, and had in fact lived in Chicago for most of her life, where she was married with two children. Her family had not heard from her since 2000, when she abruptly left Chicago to write the book. 

Khouri continued to insist she&#x27;d told the truth, even when confronted with public records which proved beyond all doubt she had spent most of her life in the United States. Knox also unearthed evidence that suggested Khouri had left Chicago when legal problems arose with several real-estate transactions.

As a result, Random House pulled the book from the shelves in Australia and the UK indefinitely. Knox and fellow Australian journalist Caroline Overington won the 2004 Walkley Award for investigative journalism for the exposé.

==&quot;Forbidden Lie$&quot;==

In September 2007, a documentary entitled &quot;Forbidden Lie$&quot; was released. Director Anna Broinowski tells the story of how Khouri&#x27;s book became a best-seller, and then follows Khouri to Jordan. Since Khouri still insists that the story is true, Broinowski gives her the opportunity to prove that it is fully or at least partly truthful; however, the evidence Broinowski uncovers indicates not only that Khouri&#x27;s book is fabricated (in spite of her father&#x27;s claim that it was true) but that Khouri had committed a number of scams even before the book.

<doc id="1041137" wikidata="Q5705406" url="?curid=1041137" title="Helio Courier">
<text>The Helio Courier is a cantilever high-wing light STOL utility aircraft designed in 1949.

Around 500 of these aircraft were manufactured in Pittsburg, Kansas, from 1954 until 1974 by the Helio Aircraft Company. The design featured four leading edge slats that deployed automatically, and large trailing edge flaps. The engine was the 295 hp Lycoming GO-480, which had a gearbox that lowered the output RPM and allowed for the use of a large three-bladed propeller to further improve takeoff performance. Couriers were famous for their takeoffs, which often took only a few plane lengths and then climbed at very high angles. During airshow demonstrations, it was common for the aircraft to actually take off across a 100 – 200 foot wide runway.

During the early 1980s, new owners (Helio Aircraft Ltd.) made an attempt to build new aircraft with direct-drive Lycoming engines, to replace troublesome and expensive geared engines. In a further effort to reduce weight, a new composite landing gear was featured. The new models also featured modest winglets. Two models were produced, the H-800 and H-700. A total of 18 aircraft were built. The rights to the Helio Stallion and Helio Courier were acquired by Helio Aircraft of Prescott, Arizona.

==Design and development==
Professor Otto C. Koppen designed aircraft for the Stout Metal Airplane Division of the Ford Motor Company, including the Ford Flivver, an aircraft that was supposed to be mass-produced by Ford. Koppen went on to design the Helio Courier.

The demonstrator for the Courier&#x27;s concept, &quot;Helioplane #1&quot;, was converted by the then-local Wiggins Airways firm from a Piper PA-17 Vagabond Trainer, one of the so-named &quot;short-wing Pipers&quot; in production following World War II. Only the cabin area of the PA-17&#x27;s original airframe remained unmodified, with the fuselage lengthened by four feet (1.2 meters), given a taller fin-rudder unit, clipped the Vagabond&#x27;s stock 29 ft-3 inch (8.92 meter) wingspan down to only some 28.5 feet (8.7 meters), fitted the shortened wings with full-span leading-edge slats, long-span wing flaps that forced the ailerons to be much diminished in their span - only occupying the two outermost rib bays inboard of the wingtip; and a longer-travel main landing gear of a taller design, not unlike that of the 1930s-origin Fieseler Fi 156 Storch German military short take-off and landing (STOL) pioneer aircraft. The powerplant for the demonstrator was switched to the Continental C85 boxer-four cylinder air-cooled engine, upgraded with fuel-injection, and uniquely equipped with a multi-belt speed reduction unit to drive its Aeroproducts nine-foot (2.75 meter) diameter, variable-pitch two-blade propeller, which contributed greatly to the amazing STOL flight characteristics of the demonstrator aircraft. The demonstrator&#x27;s first flight took place on April 8, 1949, flying from what was then called the Boston Metropolitan Airport.

For the construction of the production Courier aircraft, its all aluminum-clad airframe features a welded 15G steel-tube center section fuselage, with shoulder harnesses that protect the occupants in an emergency. The wings are of conventional aluminum construction, but feature Handley Page leading-edge slats that deploy automatically when the aircraft&#x27;s airspeed falls below a certain value — 55 to 60 miles per hour (89 to 97 km/h). The slats contribute to the Helio&#x27;s outstanding short takeoff and landing capability, and allow for stall/spin-proof controllable flight. In conjunction with the leading-edge slats, 74% of the trailing edge incorporates high-lift slotted flaps, which together with interrupter blades atop each wing when roll control is lost at very low airspeed, allows for a tight turning radius. The Helio Courier could maintain control at speeds as low as .

The design of the Helio features a large vertical tail surface and rudder for control at very low flight speeds. However, on conventional geared aircraft (taildraggers), the airplane tends to be sensitive to crosswinds, thus a crosswind gear option is available, allowing the main tires to caster left or right 20 degrees, increasing the crosswind component to . The Helio has its main gear placement far forward of the cabin, enabling hard braking on unprepared landing areas. A tricycle-gear model was produced, but is unsuitable for unprepared rough terrain.

Helios are also capable of being equipped with floats; both straight and amphibious floats being offered.

==Operational history==


With a minimum-control speed of around 28 mph, the Courier is perfectly suited for confined off-airport operations. The first one was certified in July 1954 and powered by the 260 hp Lycoming GO-435-C2B2. The first production Courier (Serial Number 001, dubbed &quot;Ol&#x27; Number 1&quot;)&quot;C-G001&quot; was previously owned and operated by JAARS as &quot;N242B&quot; until 2010. Jaars Helio Courier has been a frequent airshow performer at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh for decades, displaying its slow flight capability in front of thousands and serving as a drop plane for the Liberty Parachute Team.

In 1957, a &quot;Strato Courier&quot; set an altitude record over Mexico City, Mexico at 31,200 ft powered by a geared Lycoming GSO-480-A1A5 (340 hp), only one was built. The Super Courier, a more powerful derivative, was used by the U.S. Air Force from 1958 onward, by the U.S. Army Special Forces in the 1960s and 1970s and by Air America during the Vietnam War as the U-10. In U.S. Army and Air Force service, the U-10 Super Courier was used for liaison work, light cargo and supply drops, psychological warfare, forward air control (Air Force), insertion and extraction by land and sea (Army), and reconnaissance. Various versions were produced up through the 1980s, including turbine-powered variants.

The Super Courier saw military service in the United States as the U-10 (ex L-28). Over 120 were built: The L-28A (2, later redesignated U-10A), U-10A (26), U-10B extended range and paratrooper doors (57), and the U-10D with a higher gross weight(36). There was no U-10C.

Helios remain very popular among bush pilots in Canada (32 current) and Alaska and missionaries who fly into rough, relatively unprepared jungle airstrips because of its superior STOL abilities. Some operators use the Helio Couriers for aerial observation. Both Winged Vision Inc. of Gaithersburg, Maryland and the Pima County, Arizona, Sheriff&#x27;s Department each operate two of the rare tri-gear model and mount gyro-stabilized cameras under the wing for aerial observation. Pima County mounts a FLIR camera for law enforcement, and Winged Vision mounts a high definition television camera for coverage of major sports events.

<text>In a relational database, a row or &quot;record&quot; or &quot;tuple&quot;, represents a single, implicitly structured data item in a table. A database table can be thought of as consisting of rows and columns. Each row in a table represents a set of related data, and every row in the table has the same structure.

For example, in a table that represents companies, each row might represent a single company. Columns might represent things like company name, address, etc. In a table that represents &quot;the association&quot; of employees with departments, each row would associate one employee with one department.

The implicit structure of a row, and the meaning of the data values in a row, requires that the row be understood as providing a succession of data values, one in each column of the table. The row is then interpreted as a relvar composed of a set of tuples, with each tuple consisting of the two items: the name of the relevant column and the value this row provides for that column.

Each column expects a data value of a particular type.

For example, one column might require a unique identifier, another might require text representing a person&#x27;s name, another might require an integer representing hourly pay in dollars.

<text>David Draper (April 16, 1942 – November 30, 2021) was an American bodybuilder, actor and author.

==Early life==
Draper was born in Secaucus, New Jersey, on April 16, 1942. His weight training began at the age of ten and was a well-formed habit by the time he was about 12, in the mid-1950s. In high school he participated in wrestling, gymnastics and swimming, but was most inspired by training with weights. In 1962, his physique having attracted the attention of Joe Weider, he began working at the Weider Barbell company in New Jersey as a part-time shipping clerk.

==Career==
===Bodybuilding===
At age 21, he won the Mr. New Jersey title. Six months later he moved to Santa Monica, California, where he worked for the Weider Barbell Company until 1969. Weider magazine coverage and advertising made Draper an icon of the California beach and muscle lifestyle. &quot;That I was a West Coast beach boy to a world of bodybuilding fans eluded me,&quot; Draper wrote. At the time, he said, &quot;There wasn&#x27;t a whole bunch of encouragement or inspiration from a society which considered you either stupid or egotistical and probably a sissy.&quot;

In California, Draper trained initially at a gym many called &quot;The Dungeon&quot;, which he described as &quot;a large, awful space dug out of the ground on the corner of 4th and Broadway,&quot; and later at the original Gold&#x27;s Gym. He trained in the company of the world&#x27;s top bodybuilders, which included Frank Zane, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbu, Mike Katz, and Robby Robinson. He later admitted to his use of anabolic steroids: &quot;I was ten years into my training, 235 pounds and already Mr. America before steroids came on the scene. I used them sparingly under a doctor&#x27;s supervision and noticed marked improvement in my muscularity and separation.&quot;

Draper was 6&#x27;0&quot; (1.83 m) tall, and his bodybuilding competition weight was approximately 235 lb. (106,6 kg). His nickname &quot;The Blond Bomber&quot; was bestowed on him by Joe Weider when Weider was pushing &quot;muscle bombing&quot; (intense weight-training) in his muscle magazines in the 1960s. Draper hated it at first but eventually embraced it.

===Television appearances===
Draper appeared as movie host David the Gladiator on KHJ Channel 9 in Los Angeles from 1964 to 1965 to introduce sword-and-sandal films on Saturday nights.

Draper played himself in the 1967 episode of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; titled, &quot;Mr. Universe Muscles In&quot;, in which Granny Clampett thinks that Draper is ill with &quot;the barbell bloat.&quot; The storyline includes Draper suggesting that Ellie May is pretty enough to be &quot;Miss Universe&quot;, leading the Clampetts to think that he wants to marry Elly May, not understanding that &quot;Universe&quot; is not his last name.

He appears in the 1967 movie &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Waves&quot;, co-starring opposite Sharon Tate.

He appears in &quot;The Monkees&quot; playing Bulk, in the October 16, 1967, episode &quot;I Was a 99-lb. Weakling&quot;. He appears in &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; in the December 19, 1969, episode, &quot;Lorenzo Bush&quot;.

==Personal life==
In December 1961, Draper married Kathleen &quot;Penny&quot; Koenemund. They had a daughter.
After a reported battle with alcoholism in the late 1970s and, with rehabilitation, gaining sobriety in 1983, Draper resumed his bodybuilding career to guest-pose at bodybuilding competitions and appear at exhibitions.

Draper&#x27;s marriage to Koenemund ended in divorce. In 1988, he married Laree Setterlund, with whom he opened and ran the Santa Cruz and Scotts Valley World Gyms.

Draper continued to train with weights into his 70s, and to write, including a free weekly newsletter, emailed and published on his website until 2021. He died of congestive heart failure on November 30, 2021, at the age of 79, a condition that his widow said he suffered from for almost 40 years.

<text>John Wright Oakes (9 July 1820 – 8 July 1887) was an English landscape painter.

He was born at Sproston House, near Middlewich, Cheshire, which had been in the possession of his family for several generations. He was educated in Liverpool, and studied art under John Bishop in the school attached to the Liverpool Mechanics&#x27; Institution. His earliest works were fruit-pieces. These he exhibited in 1839 and the following years at the Liverpool Academy, of which he became a member, and afterwards honorary secretary for several years.

About 1843 Oakes began painting landscapes from nature, and in 1847 the first picture exhibited by him in London, &#x27;Nant Frangcon, Carnarvonshire,&#x27; appeared at the British Institution, and was followed in 1848 by &#x27;On the River Greta, Keswick,&#x27; at the Royal Academy. He continued to send pictures, chiefly of Welsh mountain, moorland, and coast scenery, to these exhibitions, as well as to the Society of British Artists, Dudley Gallery, Portland Gallery, and elsewhere, and in 1859 came to reside in London.

He painted also in water-colours, and in 1874 was elected an associate of the Institute of Painters in Water-Colours, but resigned this position in 1875. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1876, and an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1883. During the last six years of his life ill-health greatly interfered with the practice of his art. He still, however, exhibited annually at the Royal Academy, where a picture entitled &#x27;The Warren&#x27; appeared the year after his death. Among his best works were &#x27;A Carnarvonshire Glen,&#x27; &#x27;A Solitary Pool,&#x27; &#x27;Glen Derry,&#x27; &#x27;Malldraeth Sands,&#x27; &#x27;Aberffraw Bay,&#x27; &#x27;Marchlyn Mawr,&#x27; &#x27;Linn of Muick,&#x27; &#x27;Dunnottar Castle,&#x27; &#x27;The Bass Rock,&#x27; &#x27;The Fallow Field,&#x27; &#x27;The Border Countrie,&#x27; &#x27;The Dee Sands,&#x27; and &#x27;Dirty Weather on the East Coast.&#x27;

Oakes died at his residence, Leam House, Addison Road, Kensington, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery.

As of 1894, the South Kensington Museum had an oil painting by him entitled &#x27;Disturbed,&#x27; an effect of early spring twilight. &#x27;A North Devon Glen&#x27; was in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, and &#x27;Early Spring&#x27; in the Glasgow Corporation galleries.

<doc id="1041150" wikidata="Q1266617" url="?curid=1041150" title="Dupont's lark">
<text>Dupont&#x27;s lark (Chersophilus duponti) is a species of lark in the family Alaudidae of the monotypic genus &quot;Chersophilus&quot;. It is found in northern Africa and Spain.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Dupont&#x27;s lark was originally described by Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1820 and placed in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot;. It was named for the French naturalist Léonard Puech Dupont, who had collected the species and showed it to Vieillot.

=== Subspecies ===
Two subspecies are recognized: 
* North-western Dupont&#x27;s lark (&quot;C. d. duponti&quot;) - : Found in southern Spain, northern Morocco, northern Algeria and northern Tunisia
* South-eastern Dupont&#x27;s lark (&quot;C. d. margaritae&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species in the genus &quot;Alaemon&quot;. Found from central Algeria to western Egypt

==Description==
Like most other larks, Dupont&#x27;s lark is an undistinguished looking species on the ground. It is 17–18 cm long, slim, with a long neck, long legs and a fine slightly curved bill. It has a thin pale crown stripe and a dark-streaked breast. The north-western Dupont&#x27;s lark of Europe and north-west Africa is mainly brown-grey above and pale below. The south-eastern Dupont&#x27;s lark, which occupies most of the rest of the African range, has rufous upperparts.

===Vocalisations===
Its song is a repeated thin, melancholic whistling phrase, very ventriloquial (difficult to locate) and a nasal whistle given mainly at dawn and dusk or at night.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds across much of northern Africa, from Algeria to Egypt, and in Spain. It is a non-migratory resident. It is a species that commonly inhabits chaparral areas. However, it experiences a 3.9% annual population decrease in Spain with a 32.8% decrease from 2008 to 2018, shifting its conservation status to vulnerable on the national level and endangered in the regions of Andalusia and Castile-León.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This is a very shy species, which runs for cover when disturbed. It is difficult to see while running among vegetation but it sometimes sings, standing upright on the edge of a low bush.

===Breeding===

This is a bird of open sandy semi-desert or steppe with some grass. Its nest is on the ground, with three or four eggs being laid. Its food is seeds and insects.

<doc id="1041154" wikidata="Q1164854" url="?curid=1041154" title="Script for a Jester's Tear">
<text>Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear is the debut studio album by British neo-prog band Marillion, released in the United Kingdom on 14 March 1983 by EMI Records. The album reached number seven and spent 31 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, eventually achieving a platinum certificate, and produced the top 40 single &quot;He Knows You Know&quot; and the top 20 single &quot;Garden Party&quot;. &quot;Prog Magazine&quot; ranked it at #40 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Prog Albums of All Time.&quot;

&quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; is the only studio album by Marillion to feature the band&#x27;s original drummer and founding member Mick Pointer, who was dismissed following the album&#x27;s UK tour. In Martin Popoff&#x27;s 2016 biography of Yes, the album is credited with being part of a &quot;new wave&quot; of British progressive rock which also helped to give a second life to earlier bands.

==Background and recording==
Marillion released their first single, &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot;, on 25 October 1982. It was a minor hit, peaking at number 53 on the UK Singles Chart. It was produced by David Hitchcock, who was also contracted to work on the group&#x27;s first full-length album. He was seriously injured in a car accident when he drove home after completing work on the single. EMI took advantage of the opportunity and persuaded the group to replace him with Nick Tauber, a producer known for his work with new wave band Toyah and regarded by the record label as more modern.

Neither &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot;, nor the B-sides of the 12&quot; single, &quot;Three Boats Down from the Candy&quot; and the 17-minute-long epic &quot;Grendel&quot;, were included on &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot;, although a short radio segment of the A-side can be briefly heard prior to &quot;Forgotten Sons&quot;. As stated in the original liner notes, the music from the album was composed, arranged and performed by Marillion and the lyrics were written by Fish alone. In the 1997 remastered edition, four out of six songs are additionally credited to bass player Diz Minnit and keyboard player Brian Jelliman, who were both the initial members of the group. The recording sessions for the album started in December 1982 at The Marquee Studios in London and finished in February 1983, with Tauber producing and Simon Hanhart engineering.

The cover artwork was designed by Mark Wilkinson, who would be commissioned to the role on all Marillion releases through &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot; (1988).

In later years, both Fish and Steve Rothery have spoken critically of their work on the album. Fish said in 2016, &quot;I hear somebody singing in very bad keys! Sometimes I don&#x27;t even recognise the guy who&#x27;s singing on that album. That high falsetto voice, it was very forced. But I was young. I didn&#x27;t understand anything about music and keys, and I was singing very high.&quot; Rothery was not satisfied with his guitar sound. He said in 2022, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have the experience, I didn&#x27;t know the sound I wanted, so I was using maybe my old Yamaha SG-2000. I think I had an Orange amp in the early days. I can&#x27;t remember when I switched to Marshalls. Anyway, it wasn&#x27;t a sound that I was in love with.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 13 March 1983 by EMI on vinyl housed in a gatefold sleeve. In the United States and Canada, it was available through Capitol Records.

===Critical reception===
In his review for &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Dave Dickson said, &quot;As a debut album this is extremely impressive, fully living up to the band&#x27;s previous promise&quot;. John Franck gave the album a retrospective rating of four-and-a-half stars out of five on AllMusic. He called it &quot;a vital piece for any Marillion head and an essential work for any self-respecting first- or second-generation prog rock fan&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; was a commercial success, reaching number seven in the United Kingdom and spending 31 weeks on the charts, the second-longest album chart residency for Marillion. It was awarded a platinum certification by British Phonographic Industry on 5 December 1997 for over 300,000 copies sold. In the United States, it failed to make any impact, peaking at number 175 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

The album generated two hit singles in the United Kingdom. The first single, &quot;He Knows You Know&quot;, preceded the release of &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; and launched the group into the top 40, reaching number 35. The second single, &quot;Garden Party&quot;, was released on 6 June 1983 and peaked at number 16. &quot;He Knows You Know&quot; gained some airplay in the United States and reached number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart.

===Reissues===
&quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; was first released on CD in 1985. As part of a series of Marillion eight studio albums made on a contract with EMI, the album was 24-bit digitally remastered between April and July 1997 and expanded with a second disc containing bonus tracks, including all tracks from the debut single. This edition was issued on 29 September 1997 and has been in print to date. The remastered version was also issued without the second disc in 2000 and contained a pared-down booklet. A new 180g heavy weight vinyl edition featuring a gatefold sleeve and the original artwork was released in 2012.

In 2020, EMI released a deluxe version of the album with four CDs and a Blu-ray disc that contains new remixes of the original album, the full &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; 12&quot; single (except for the original version of &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; which is replaced by the &quot;Battle Priest&quot; version), and a previously unreleased live set from 1982 at London&#x27;s Marquee Club. In addition to that, the Blu-ray also includes the previously released &quot;Recital of the Script&quot; video and, as extras, promo films of some tracks from the album. It was the penultimate release of Fish era Marillion albums in a recent deluxe reissue campaign that also includes &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;, &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot;, &quot;Brave&quot;, and &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot;. &quot;Fugazi&quot; is the last album put out in this format so far, having been released on September 1, 2021.

==Track listing==
All writing credits are adapted from the 1997 remastered edition. According to the liner notes of the original version, the whole group is listed as writers, arrangers, and performers; all lyrics are credited to Fish.

<doc id="1041160" wikidata="Q1474920" url="?curid=1041160" title="Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell">
<text>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell is the debut novel by British writer Susanna Clarke. Published in 2004, it is an alternative history set in 19th-century England around the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Its premise is that magic once existed in England and has returned with two men: Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange. Centred on the relationship between these two men, the novel investigates the nature of &quot;Englishness&quot; and the boundaries between reason and unreason, Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Dane, and Northern and Southern English cultural tropes/stereotypes. It has been described as a fantasy novel, an alternative history, and a historical novel. It inverts the Industrial Revolution conception of the North–South divide in England: in this book the North is romantic and magical, rather than rational and concrete.

The narrative draws on various Romantic literary traditions, such as the comedy of manners, the Gothic tale, and the Byronic hero. The novel&#x27;s language is a pastiche of 19th-century writing styles, such as those of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. Clarke describes the supernatural with careful detail. She supplements the text with almost 200 footnotes, outlining the backstory and an entire fictional corpus of magical scholarship.

Clarke began writing &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot; in 1992; ten years later she submitted the manuscript for publication. It was accepted by Bloomsbury and published in September 2004, with illustrations by Portia Rosenberg. Bloomsbury were so sure of its success that they printed 250,000 hardcover copies. The novel was well received by critics and reached number three on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. It was longlisted for the 2004 Man Booker Prize and won the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Novel.

== Plot summary ==
=== Volume I: Mr Norrell ===
The novel opens in 1806 in northern England with The Learned Society of York Magicians, whose members are &quot;theoretical magicians&quot; who study magical texts and history, after the decline of magic in England several hundred years earlier. The group is stunned to learn of a &quot;practical magician&quot;, Mr Gilbert Norrell. Norrell proves his skill as a magician by making the statues in York Cathedral speak, thereafter compelling the society to disband. John Childermass, Mr Norrell&#x27;s factotum, convinces a member of the group, John Segundus, to write about the event for the London newspapers.

Segundus&#x27;s article generates interest in Mr Norrell, who moves to London to revive practical English magic. He enters society with the help of two gentlemen about town, the superficial and foppish Christopher Drawlight and the shrewd Henry Lascelles, and meets a Cabinet Minister, Sir Walter Pole. To ingratiate himself, Mr Norrell attempts to resurrect Sir Walter&#x27;s fiancée, Emma Wintertowne, from the dead. He summons a fairy — &quot;the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair&quot; — who strikes a bargain with Norrell to restore Emma: the price being half of her returned life will be spent with the fairy. After news spreads of Emma&#x27;s resurrection and happy marriage to Sir Walter, magic becomes respected, and the government seeks Norrell&#x27;s aid in their ongoing war against Napoleon.

While living in London, Norrell encounters Vinculus, a disreputable street-magician vagabond, who relates a prophecy about a &quot;nameless slave&quot; and two magicians in England, but Norrell dismisses it and has Vinculus banished. While travelling, Vinculus later meets Jonathan Strange and recites the same prophecy, prompting Strange to become a magician. Meanwhile, the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair takes a liking to Stephen Black, Sir Walter&#x27;s butler, and promises to make him a king. Emma (now Lady Pole) lapses into lassitude; she rarely speaks and is distraught by bells, music, and parties. Each night she and Stephen are forced to attend balls held by the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair in the Faerie kingdom of Lost-Hope, where they dance all night long; their attempts to communicate their situation are confounded by magic, with their speech rendered into nonsense.

=== Volume II: Jonathan Strange ===
In 1809, Strange learns of Mr Norrell and travels to London to meet him. They immediately clash over the importance of John Uskglass (the legendary Raven King) to English magic. Strange argues that &quot;without the Raven King there would be no magic and no magicians&quot; while Norrell retorts that the Raven King abandoned England and should be forgotten. Despite their differing opinions and temperaments, Norrell acknowledges Strange&#x27;s magical ability and takes him on as a pupil, but deliberately keeps some knowledge from him.

The Stranges become a popular couple in London. Lady Pole and Strange&#x27;s wife, Arabella, become friends; during a visit, Arabella meets the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair, whom she assumes is a relative of the Poles. The Cabinet ministers find Strange easier to deal with than Norrell, so they send him to assist the Duke of Wellington on his Peninsular Campaign. For over a year, Strange helps the army: he creates roads, moves towns, and makes dead men speak. After he returns, he fails to cure George III&#x27;s madness, but manages to save him from the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair, who is determined to make Black the king in his place. On Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba and return to power, Strange goes back to the assistance of Wellington helping defeat Napoleon and the French at the horrific Battle of Waterloo.

Upon returning to England, Strange finds that Drawlight has been stealing money from English citizens with prospects of fulfilling their wishes through Strange&#x27;s magic. Drawlight&#x27;s schemes are publicized and he is arrested. Norrell strongly wishes for him to be hanged for magic-related crimes, but has insufficient political influence. Lascelles becomes closer to Norrell, challenging the relationship between Childermass and his master.

Frustrated with being Norrell&#x27;s pupil, Strange pens a scathing review of a book outlining Norrell&#x27;s theories on modern magic; in particular, Strange challenges Norrell&#x27;s views of the Raven King. The English public splits into &quot;Norrellites&quot; and &quot;Strangites&quot;. Norrell confides to Strange that he wasted years attempting to summon the Raven King, but Strange disagrees that the effort is futile; the two agree to part company, although not without regret. Strange returns home and works on his own book, &quot;The History and Practice of English Magic&quot;. Arabella goes missing, then suddenly reappears, sick and weak. Three days later she dies.

=== Volume III: John Uskglass ===
In 1816, Lady Pole attempts to shoot Mr Norrell. Childermass takes the bullet himself, but is not killed. Lady Pole is sent to the countryside and cared for by John Segundus, who has an inkling of the magic surrounding her. During travels in the north, Black meets Vinculus, who recites his prophecy: &quot;the nameless slave shall be a king in a strange country ...&quot; Stephen believes it applies to him, but the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair argues that it applies to the Raven King.

Strange travels to Venice and meets Flora Greysteel there. They become fond of each other and Strange&#x27;s friends believe he may marry again. However, after experimenting with dangerous magic that threatens his sanity to gain access to the Faerie kingdom, he discovers that Arabella is alive and being held captive alongside Lady Pole in Lost-Hope; he realizes the bargain Norrell struck with the fairy. The Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair curses Strange with an &quot;Impenetrable Darkness&quot;, a pillar of darkness that engulfs him and follows him wherever he goes. Thereafter, Strange&#x27;s strenuous efforts to rescue Arabella take their toll: his letters to his friends appear crazed and so his public reputation suffers. At Strange&#x27;s request, Flora moves with her family to Padua and secludes herself, along with a mirror given to her by Strange. Drawlight is sent by Lascelles and Norrell to Venice to find out more about Strange&#x27;s activities and on his arrival he is magically brought before Strange. Strange instructs him to deliver messages to Norrell, Childermass, and the magical community within England before dismissing him. Strange then re-invokes the old alliances that exist in England between the forces of nature and John Uskglass. This sparks a magical renaissance, reopening roads to Faerie, and causing many to spontaneously perform magic, but Norrell fails to grasp its significance.

Drawlight attempts to deliver the messages but is intercepted by Lascelles, who murders him, because if Norrell learnt the truth it would damage Lascelles&#x27;s control over Norrell. Strange, bringing the Impenetrable Darkness with him, asks Norrell to help him undo Arabella&#x27;s enchantment by summoning John Uskglass. Childermass explores a corner of Faerie and stumbles upon a castle where he is challenged to a duel by its guardian; he declines the duel. Lascelles challenges the guardian himself, wishing to preserve English honour, and succeeds in killing him, but is magically entrapped into the position of the guardian himself.

Meanwhile, Childermass eventually receives the message meant for him by Strange; he and Segundus use magic to break the enchantment over Lady Pole. Enraged by this, the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair determines to place a second deadly curse on Lady Pole, as Faerie tradition demands. En route, the Gentleman hangs and kills Vinculus after they encounter him, with Black forced to watch. During these events, Norrell and Strange attempt a spell that would cause the natural forces of England to pay homage to John Uskglass. Not knowing his true name, they dedicate it to the &quot;nameless slave&quot;. However, instead the power is vested in Black, who uses his momentary control of all of English magic to destroy the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair. Then, leaving England forever by one of the Faerie roads, Black sheds his name and becomes the new king of the now-blossoming kingdom of Lost-Hope.

Childermass discovers Vinculus&#x27;s body and notes that it is tattooed with the last work of John Uskglass. A man appears; he calls Childermass his servant, though Childermass does not recognize him, then brings Vinculus back to life and performs other feats of magic with ease. The mysterious man, heavily implied to be John Uskglass himself, then disappears, removing Childermass&#x27;s and Vinculus&#x27;s memories of the encounter.

As a result of the imprecision of the fairy&#x27;s curse, which was placed on &quot;the English magician&quot;, Norrell and his library are trapped along with Strange within the Impenetrable Darkness, and they cannot move more than a certain distance from each other. Upon the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair&#x27;s death, Arabella comes through the mirror in Padua, where Flora is waiting for her upon instruction of Strange. Childermass informs the Learned Society of York Magicians that their contract is void, and they can study magic again. He shows the now-restored Vinculus as proof that John Uskglass&#x27;s &quot;Book of Magic&quot; remains, tattooed upon his body. Two months later, Strange has a conversation with Arabella, who is still living in Padua. He explains that he and Norrell are studying magic together and intend to learn to remove the Darkness they are both trapped in, but will adventure into other worlds in the meantime. Neither wishes to take Arabella to Faerie again, so he instead promises to return to her when he has dispelled the Darkness and tells her not to be a widow till then, to which she agrees.

== Composition and publication ==
Clarke first developed the idea for &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot; during a year spent teaching English in Bilbao, Spain: &quot;I had a kind of waking dream ... about a man in 18th-century clothes in a place rather like Venice, talking to some English tourists. And I felt strongly that he had some sort of magical background – he&#x27;d been dabbling in magic, and something had gone badly wrong.&quot; She had also recently re-read J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and afterwards was inspired to &quot;trying writing a novel of magic and fantasy&quot;.

After she returned from Spain in 1993, Clarke began to think seriously about writing her novel. She signed up for a five-day fantasy and science-fiction writing workshop, co-taught by writers Colin Greenland and Geoff Ryman. The students were expected to prepare a short story before attending, but Clarke only had &quot;bundles&quot; of material for her novel. From this she extracted &quot;The Ladies of Grace Adieu&quot;, a story about three women secretly practising magic who are discovered by the famous Jonathan Strange. Greenland was so impressed with the story that, without Clarke&#x27;s knowledge, he sent an excerpt to his friend, the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman. Gaiman later said, &quot;It was terrifying from my point of view to read this first short story that had so much assurance ... It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano for the first time and she plays a sonata.&quot; Gaiman showed the story to his friend, science-fiction writer and editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden. Clarke learned of these events when Nielsen Hayden called and offered to publish her story in his anthology &quot;Starlight 1&quot;, which featured pieces by well-regarded science-fiction and fantasy writers. She accepted, and the book won the World Fantasy Award for best anthology in 1997.

Clarke spent the next ten years working on the novel in her spare time, while editing cookbooks full-time for Simon &amp; Schuster in Cambridge. She also published stories in &quot;Starlight 2&quot; and &quot;Starlight 3&quot;; according to the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;, her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet. She was never sure, however, if she would finish her novel or if it would be published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30 am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not the reader, &quot;clung to this method&quot; because &quot;I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [the novel] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I had known it was going to take me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next.&quot; Clarke and Greenland moved in together while she was writing the novel. Greenland did not read the novel until it was published.

Around 2001, Clarke &quot;had begun to despair&quot;, and started looking for someone to help her finish and sell the book. Giles Gordon became her agent and sold the unfinished manuscript to Bloomsbury in early 2003, after two publishers rejected it as unmarketable. Bloomsbury were so sure the novel would be a success that they offered Clarke a £1 million advance. They printed 250,000 hardcover copies simultaneously in the United States, Britain, and Germany. Seventeen translations were begun before the first English publication was released. &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot; was first published in the United States on 8 September 2004, in the United Kingdom on 30 September, and in other countries on 4 October.

== Style ==
Clarke&#x27;s style has frequently been described as a pastiche, particularly of nineteenth-century British writers such as Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and George Meredith. Specifically, the novel&#x27;s minor characters, including sycophants, rakes, and the Duke of Wellington, evoke Dickens&#x27; caricatures. Laura Miller, in her review for &quot;Salon&quot;, suggests that the novel is &quot;about a certain literary voice, the eminently civilized voice of early 19th-century social comedy&quot;, exemplified by the works of Austen. The novel uses obsolete spellings—&quot;chuse&quot; for &quot;choose&quot; and &quot;shewed&quot; for &quot;showed&quot;, for example—to convey this voice as well as the free indirect speech made famous by Austen. Clarke herself notes that Austen&#x27;s influence is particularly strong in the &quot;domestic scenes, set in living rooms and drawing rooms where people mostly &quot;chat&quot; about magic&quot; where Dickens&#x27;s is prominent &quot;any time there&#x27;s more action or description&quot;. While many reviewers compare Clarke&#x27;s style to that of Austen, Gregory Feeley argues in his review for &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; that &quot;the points of resemblance are mostly superficial&quot;. He writes that &quot;Austen gets down to business briskly, while Clarke engages in a curious narrative strategy of continual deferral and delay.&quot; For example, Clarke mentions Jonathan Strange on the first page of the novel, but only in a footnote. He reappears in other footnotes throughout the opening but does not appear as a character in the text proper until a quarter of the way through the novel.

In &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot;, Clarke infuses her dry wit with prosaic quaintness. For example, the narrator notes: &quot;It has been remarked (by a lady infinitely cleverer than the present author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised to life in the early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week.&quot; As Michel Faber explains in his review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;here we have all the defining features of Clarke&#x27;s style simultaneously: the archly Austenesque tone, the somewhat overdone quaintness (&#x27;upon the Tuesday&#x27;), the winningly matter-of-fact use of the supernatural, and drollness to spare.&quot; Gregory Maguire notes in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Clarke even gently ridicules the genre of the novel itself: &quot;[A gentleman] picks up a book and begins to read ... but he is not attending to what he reads and he has got to Page 22 before he discovers it is a &quot;novel&quot; – the sort of work which above all others he most despises – and he puts it down in disgust.&quot; Elsewhere, the narrator remarks, &quot;Dear Emma does not waste her energies upon novels like other young women.&quot; The narrator&#x27;s identity has been a topic of discussion, with Clarke declaring that said narrator is female and omniscient rather than a future scholar from within the real storyline as some had suggested.

Clarke&#x27;s style extends to the novel&#x27;s 185 footnotes, which document a meticulous invented history of English magic. At times, the footnotes dominate entire pages of the novel. Michael Dirda, in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, describes these notes as &quot;dazzling feats of imaginative scholarship&quot;, in which the anonymous narrator &quot;provides elaborate mini-essays, relating anecdotes from the lives of semi-legendary magicians, describing strange books and their contents, speculating upon the early years and later fate of the Raven King&quot;. This extensive extra-textual apparatus is reminiscent of postmodernist works, such as David Foster Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; (1996) and Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; (1997), particularly as Clarke&#x27;s notes humorously refer to previous notes in the novel. Clarke did not expect her publisher to accept the footnotes.

Feeley explains that Romantic poet John Keats&#x27;s &quot;vision of enchantment and devastation following upon any dealings with &quot;faeries&quot;&quot; informs the novel, as the passing reference to the &quot;cold hillside&quot; makes clear. The magic in &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot; has been described as &quot;wintry and sinister&quot; and &quot;a melancholy, macabre thing&quot;. There are &quot;flocks of black birds, a forest that grows up in the canals of Venice, a countryside of bleak moors that can only be entered through mirrors, a phantom bell that makes people think of everything they have ever lost, a midnight darkness that follows an accursed man everywhere he goes&quot;. The setting reflects this tone, as &quot;dark, fog, mist and wet give the book much of its creepy, northern atmosphere&quot;. According to Nisi Shawl in her review for &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, the illustrations reinforce this tenor: &quot;Shadows fill the illustrations by Portia Rosenberg, as apt as Edward Gorey&#x27;s for Dickens&#x27; &quot;Bleak House&quot;.&quot; Author John Clute disagrees, arguing that they are &quot;astonishingly inappropriate&quot; to the tone of the novel. Noting that Clarke refers to important nineteenth-century illustrators George Cruikshank and Thomas Rowlandson, whose works are &quot;line-dominated, intricate, scabrous, cartoon-like, savage and funny&quot;, he is disappointed with the &quot;soft and wooden&quot; illustrations provided by Rosenberg.

== Genre ==
Reviewers variously describe &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot; as a fantasy novel, an alternative history, a historical fiction, or as a combination of these styles. Clarke herself says, &quot;I think the novel is viewed as something new ... blending together a few genres – such as fantasy and adventure and pastiche historical – plus there&#x27;s the whole thing about slightly knowing footnotes commenting on the story.&quot; She explains in an interview that she was particularly influenced by the historical fiction of Rosemary Sutcliff as well as the fantasies of Ursula K. Le Guin and Alan Garner, and that she loves the works of Austen.

In his review for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, John Freeman observes that Clarke&#x27;s fantasy, like that of Franz Kafka and Neil Gaiman, is imbued with realism. He argues that the footnotes in particular lend an air of credibility to the narrative: for example, they describe a fictional biography of Jonathan Strange and list where particular paintings in Norrell&#x27;s house are located. In an interview, Clarke describes how she creates this realist fantasy: &quot;One way of grounding the magic is by putting in lots of stuff about street lamps, carriages and how difficult it is to get good servants.&quot; To create this effect, the novel includes many references to real early-nineteenth century people and things, such as: artists Francisco Goya, Cruikshank, and Rowlandson; writers Frances Burney, William Beckford, &quot;Monk&quot; Lewis, Lord Byron, and Ann Radcliffe; Maria Edgeworth&#x27;s &quot;Belinda&quot; and Austen&#x27;s &quot;Emma&quot;; publisher John Murray; politicians Lord Castlereagh and George Canning; &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Edinburgh Review&quot;; Chippendale and Wedgwood furnishings; and the madness of King George III. Clarke has said that she hopes the magic is as realistic as that in Le Guin&#x27;s Earthsea trilogy. This realism has led other reviewers, such as Polly Shulman, to argue that Clarke&#x27;s book is more of an historical fiction, akin to the works of Patrick O&#x27;Brian. As she explains, &quot;Both Clarke&#x27;s and O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s stories are about a complicated relationship between two men bound together by their profession; both are set during the Napoleonic wars; and they share a dry, melancholy wit and unconventional narrative shape.&quot; Shulman sees fantasy and historical fiction as similar because both must follow rigid rules or risk a breakdown of the narrative.

As well as literary styles, Clarke pastiches many Romantic literary genres: the comedy of manners, the Gothic tale, the silver-fork novel, the military adventure, the Byronic hero, and the historical romance of Walter Scott. In fact, Clarke&#x27;s novel maps the literary history of the early nineteenth century: the novel begins with the style and genres of Regency England, an &quot;Austenian world of light, bright, sparkling dialogue and well-mannered gentility&quot;, and gradually transforms into a dark, Byronic tale. Clarke combines these Romantic genres with modern ones, such as the fantasy novel, drawing on the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, Philip Pullman, T. H. White, and C. S. Lewis. As Maguire notes, Clarke includes rings of power and books of spells that originate in these authors&#x27; works. In contrast, Sacha Zimmerman suggests in &quot;The New Republic&quot; that while Tolkien&#x27;s world is &quot;entirely new&quot;, Clarke&#x27;s world is more engaging because it is eerily close to the reader&#x27;s. Although many reviewers compare &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot; to the Harry Potter series, Annie Linskey contends in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; that &quot;the allusion is misleading&quot;: unlike J. K. Rowling&#x27;s novels, Clarke&#x27;s is morally ambiguous, with its complex plot and dark characters.

== Themes ==

=== Friendship ===
Reviewers focus most frequently on the dynamic between Norrell and Strange, arguing that the novel is about their relationship. In her review for the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Roz Kaveney writes that the two illustrate Harold Bloom&#x27;s notion of the &quot;anxiety of influence&quot; in addition to romantic friendship. The two are a &quot;study in contrasts&quot;, with Norrell &quot;exceptionally learned but shy and fussy&quot; while Strange is &quot;charming, young, fashionable and romantic&quot;. As one reviewer remarks, &quot;Clarke could have called the book &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; if the title weren&#x27;t already taken.&quot;

=== Reason and madness ===
The novel is not about the fight between good and evil but rather the differences between madness and reason—and it is the fairy world that is connected to madness (mad people can see fairies, for example). Lady Pole, who is taken away into the fairyland of Lost-Hope every night, appears insane to those around her. She is hidden away, like the character type examined by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in their seminal book &quot;The Madwoman in the Attic&quot; (1979). Developing a &quot;divided consciousness&quot;, she is passive and quiet at home, but at the same time is vengeful and murderous in the fairy land.

=== Englishness ===

Clarke&#x27;s book is identified as distinctively English not only because of its style but also because of its themes of &quot;vigorous common sense&quot;, &quot;firm ethical fiber&quot;, &quot;serene reason and self-confidence&quot;, which are drawn from its Augustan literary roots. The &quot;muddy, bloody, instinctual spirit of the fairies&quot; is equally a part of its Englishness, along with &quot;arrogance, provincialism and class prejudice&quot;. The fairy tradition that Clarke draws on is particularly English; she alludes to tales from children&#x27;s literature and others which date back to the medieval period. As Feeley notes, &quot;The idea of fairies forming a hidden supernatural aristocracy certainly predates Spenser and Shakespeare, and seems to distinguish the English tales of wee folk from those of Scotland and Ireland.&quot; In these medieval English stories, the fairies are depicted as &quot;capricious, inconsistent in their attitude toward humankind, [and] finally unknowable&quot;, characteristics which Clarke integrates into her own fairies. Clarke notes in an interview that she drew the idea of unpredictable, amoral fairies from the works of Neil Gaiman.

In an interview with &quot;Locus&quot;, Clarke explains why and how she integrated the theme of &quot;Englishness&quot; into &quot;Jonathan Strange&quot;: &quot;I wanted to explore my ideas of the fantastic, as well as my ideas of England and my attachment to English landscape. ... Sometimes it feels to me as though we don&#x27;t have a fable of England, of Britain, something strong and idealized and romantic. I was picking up on things like Chesterton and Conan Doyle, and the sense (which is also in Jane Austen) of what it was to be an English gentleman at the time when England was a very confident place&quot;. In particular, &quot;it&#x27;s the sort of Englishness which is stuffy but fundamentally benevolent, and fundamentally very responsible about the rest of the world&quot;, which connects Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes to Clarke&#x27;s Jonathan Strange.

=== Historical otherness ===
Using techniques of the genre of alternative history, Clarke creates events and characters that would have been out of place in the early nineteenth century. She also explores the &quot;silencing&quot; of under-represented groups: women, people of colour, and poor whites. Both Strange and Norrell suppress the voices of these groups in their rise to power. Mr Norrell, for example, attempts to buy up all the books of magic in England to keep anyone else from acquiring their knowledge. He also barters away half of Emma Wintertowne&#x27;s (Lady Pole&#x27;s) life for political influence, a deal about which, due to an enchantment, she cannot speak coherently.

Clarke explores the limits of &quot;English&quot; magic through the characters of Stephen Black and Vinculus. As Clarke explains, &quot;If you put a fairy next to a person who is also outside English society ... suddenly the fact that there is this alien race seems more believable, because you&#x27;ve got another alien and the two of them can talk about the English in this very natural way.&quot; The gentleman with the thistle-down hair idealizes Stephen as a noble savage and enslaves him by taking him to the Lost-Hope—like Lady Pole, Stephen is silenced. Both &quot;suffer under a silencing spell that mimics gaps in the historical record&quot;. Furthermore, the gentleman&#x27;s desire to acquire Stephen for his dancing hall is reminiscent of the objectification of black slaves in European society. Stephen vows to eternally hate all white men after he hears the circumstances of the death of his enslaved mother, but when the thistle-down haired gentleman kills the white Vinculus in front of Stephen, he weeps. Both Strange and Norrell see the essence of Englishness in the Raven King, a character who was raised by fairies and could not speak English. As Elizabeth Hoiem explains, &quot;The most English of all Englishmen, then, is both king and slave, in many ways indistinguishable from Stephen Black. This paradox is what ultimately resolves the plot. When Strange and Norrell summon &#x27;the nameless slave&#x27;, the Raven King&#x27;s powerful alliances with nature are transferred to Stephen Black, allowing Stephen to kill the Gentleman and free himself from slavery.&quot; In the end, it is Strange and Norrell who are trapped in everlasting darkness while the silenced women, people of colour, and poor whites defeat the antagonist.

== Reception ==
To promote &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot;, Bloomsbury—who also published the Harry Potter series—launched what &quot;The Observer&quot; called &quot;one of the biggest marketing campaigns in publishing history&quot;. Their campaign included plans for newspaper serialisations, book deliveries by horse and carriage, and the placement of &quot;themed teasers&quot;, such as period stationery and mock newspapers, in United States coffeeshops. 7,500 advance readers&#x27; copies were sent out, a limited number wrapped in paper and sealed with wax. These sold for more than US$100 each on eBay in England in the weeks leading up to publication. By 2005, collectors were paying hundreds of pounds for signed copies of a limited edition of the novel.

The book made its debut at No. 9 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, rising to No. 3 two weeks later. It remained on the list for eleven weeks. Four weeks after the book&#x27;s initial publication, it was in Amazon&#x27;s top ten. Clarke went on a 20-city tour to promote the novel, after its near-simultaneous publication in 20 countries. Endorsements from independent booksellers helped the book sell out its first printing; by the end of September 2004, it had gone through eight printings.

The novel met with &quot;a crackle of favorable reviews in major papers&quot;. On Metacritic, the book received a 83 out of 100 based on 25 critic reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. According to Book Marks, the book received &quot;positive&quot; reviews based on 12 critic reviews with 5 being &quot;rave&quot; and 2 being &quot;positive&quot; and 4 being &quot;mixed&quot; and 1 being &quot;pan&quot;. &quot;The BookScore&quot; gave it an aggregated critic score of 8.1 based on an accumulation of British and American press reviews. On November/December 2004 issue of Bookmarks, the book received a (4.0 out of 5) based on critic reviews with a critical summary saying, &quot;Critics have billed Clarke’s first novel, &quot;longlisted&quot; for the Booker Prize, as the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; for adults (as if Harry didn’t appeal to us in the first place!). Critics agree that &quot;Jonathan Strange&quot;, which &quot;almost&quot; lives up to the hype, dredges up more magic and originality than Harry’s golden snitch&quot;. Globally, Complete Review on the review consensus &quot;Not quite a consensus, but many enthralled&quot;.

&quot;The New Republic&quot; hailed it as &quot;an exceptional work&quot;, both &quot;thoughtful and irrepressibly imaginative&quot;. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; described Clarke as &quot;a superb character writer&quot;, and the &quot;Denver Post&quot; called her a &quot;superb storyteller&quot;. The reviews praised Clarke&#x27;s &quot;deft&quot; handling of the pastiche of styles, but many criticised the novel&#x27;s pace, &quot;The Guardian&quot; complaining that &quot;the plot creaks frightfully in many places and the pace dawdles&quot;. In his review for &quot;Science Fiction Weekly&quot;, Clute suggested that &quot;almost every scene in the first 300 pages should have been carefully and delicately &quot;trimmed&quot;&quot; (emphasis in original) since they do little to advance the story. He argued that, at times, Clarke&#x27;s Austenesque tone gets in the way of plot development. On the other hand, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; found the novel &quot;a quick read&quot;. Complaining that the book leaves the reader &quot;longing for just a bit more lyricism and poetry&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reviewer noted, with others, that &quot;sex plays virtually no role in the story ... [and] one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent&quot;. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; reviewer, Amanda Craig, praised the novel as &quot;a tale of magic such as might have been written by the young Jane Austen – or, perhaps, by the young Mrs Radcliffe, whose Gothic imagination and exuberant delicacy of style set the key.&quot; However, she also criticised the book: &quot;As fantasy, it is deplorable, given that it fails to embrace the essentially anarchic nature of such tales. What is so wonderful about magicians, wizards and all witches other than Morgan le Fay is not just their magical powers, but that they possess these in spite of being low-born. Far from caring about being gentlemen, wizards are the ultimate expression of rank&#x27;s irrelevance to talent&quot;. However, reviewers were not in universal agreement on any of these points. Maguire wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot;:

What keeps this densely realised confection aloft is that very quality of reverence to the writers of the past. The chief character in &quot;Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell&quot; isn&#x27;t, in fact, either of the magicians: it&#x27;s the library that they both adore, the books they consult and write and, in a sense, become. Clarke&#x27;s giddiness comes from finding a way at once to enter the company of her literary heroes, to pay them homage and to add to the literature.

While promoting the novel, Neil Gaiman said that it was &quot;unquestionably the finest English novel of the fantastic written in the last 70 years&quot;, a statement which has been read hyperbolically by Clute. However, Clute explains what Gaiman meant was that &quot;Jonathan Strange&quot; is &quot;the finest English novel of the fantastic since Hope Mirrlees&#x27;s great &quot;Lud-in-the-Mist&quot; (1926), which is almost certainly the finest English fantasy about the relationship between England and the fantastic yet published&quot;. Gaiman himself concurred with this view, stating that he had had &quot;Lud-in-the-Mist&quot; in mind when making his promotion and that, when asked about Tolkien&#x27;s place in English fantasy, &quot;I would explain that I did not, and do not, think of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as English fantasy but as high fantasy&quot;. Clute writes that &quot;a more cautious claim&quot; would be: &quot;if Susanna Clarke finishes the story she has hardly begun in &quot;Strange&quot; ... she may well have then written the finest English novel of the fantastic about the myth of England and the myth of the fantastic and the marriage of the two ever published, bar none of the above, including Mirrlees.&quot;

=== Film ===

On 15 October 2004, New Line Cinema announced that it had bought a three-year option on the film rights to &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot;. Clarke received an undisclosed &quot;seven-figure sum&quot;, making the deal &quot;one of the biggest acquisitions of film rights for a book in recent years&quot;. New Line chose Christopher Hampton, whose adaptation of &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; won an Academy Award, to write it; New Line executives Mark Ordesky and Ileen Maisel were overseeing the production. On 7 November 2005, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Hampton had finished the first draft: &quot;As you can imagine, it took a fair amount of time to work out some way to encapsulate that enormous book in a film of sensible length ... [b]ut it was lots of fun – and very unlike anything I have ever done before.&quot; At that time, no director or cast had yet been chosen. As of June 2006, Hampton was still working on the screenplay. Julian Fellowes then took over writing duties before the collapse of New Line Cinema.

=== Television ===

A seven-part adaptation of the book by the BBC began broadcast on BBC One on Sunday 17 May 2015. The book was adapted by Peter Harness, directed by Toby Haynes, starring Bertie Carvel and Eddie Marsan as the titular magicians, in a production by Cuba Pictures and Feel Films. A number of co-producers joined the project, including BBC America, Screen Yorkshire, Space and Far Moor, and it is to be distributed by Endemol Shine Group and Acorn Media.

Pre-production began in April 2013, with filming later in the year, including locations in England, primarily in Yorkshire, as well as in Canada and Croatia.

=== Audio book ===
The 32-hour audio book of &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot; was released by Audio Renaissance in 2004. According to a review in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, reader Simon Prebble &quot;navigates this production with much assuredness and an array of accents. ... Prebble&#x27;s full voice is altered to a delicate softness for young ladies of a certain breeding, or tightened to convey the snarkiness often heard in the costive Norrell.&quot; Prebble interrupts the main text to read the footnotes, announcing them with the word &quot;footnote&quot;. According to the &quot;AudioFile&quot; review, the &quot;narrative flow suffers&quot; because of these interruptions and the reviewer recommends listening &quot;with text in hand&quot;. Each note is on its own track, so listeners have the option of skipping them without missing text from the main narrative. When doing public readings, Clarke herself skips the notes.

=== Sequel ===
In 2004, Clarke mentioned that she was working on a book that begins a few years after &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot; ends, intended to centre on characters such as Childermass and Vinculus who, as Clarke says, are &quot;a bit lower down the social scale&quot;. She commented in 2005 and 2007 that progress on the book had been slowed by her ill health. In 2006 it was reported that she suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome, although she has since received a wide assortment of diagnoses. In promotional interviews for her second novel, &quot;Piranesi&quot;, she commented that her illness would have made the effort required to research and write another book of the same scope &quot;insurmountable&quot; even when partially recovered, and that she had instead devoted her time to an older, &quot;much more feasible&quot; idea, which became &quot;Piranesi&quot;. The sequel, she said, is &quot;a long way off&quot;:

<doc id="1041167" wikidata="Q2102543" url="?curid=1041167" title="Column (database)">
<text>In a relational database, a column is a set of data values of a particular type, one value for each row of a table. A column may contain text values, numbers, or even pointers to files in the operating system. Columns typically contain simple types, though some relational database systems allow columns to contain more complex data types, such as whole documents, images, or even video clips. A column can also be called an attribute.

Each row would provide a data value for each column and would then be understood as a single structured data value. For example, a database that represents company contact information might have the following columns: ID, Company Name, Address Line 1, Address Line 2, City, and Postal Code. More formally, a row is a tuple containing a specific value for each column, for example: (1234, &#x27;Big Company Inc.&#x27;, &#x27;123 East Example Street&#x27;, &#x27;456 West Example Drive&#x27;, &#x27;Big City&#x27;, 98765).

== Field ==

The word &#x27;field&#x27; is normally used interchangeably with &#x27;column&#x27;. However, database perfectionists tend to favor using &#x27;field&#x27; to signify a specific cell of a given row. This is to enable accuracy in communicating with other developers. Columns (really column names) being referred to as field names (common for each row/record in the table). Then a field refers to a single storage location in a specific record (like a cell) to store one value (the field value). The terms record and field come from the more practical field of database usage and traditional DBMS system usage (This was linked into business like terms used in manual databases e.g. filing cabinet storage with records for each customer). The terms row and column come from the more theoretical study of relational theory.

Another distinction between the terms &#x27;column&#x27; and &#x27;field&#x27; is that the term &#x27;column&#x27; does not apply to certain databases, for instance key-value stores, that do not conform to the traditional relational database structure.

<text>Haltdalen is a village in Holtålen Municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. The village is located along the river Gaula, about northwest of the village of Renbygda and about southwest of the village of Aunegrenda. The village of Haltdalen has approximately 600 inhabitants (2004). It is situated along the Rørosbanen railway line connecting the town of Røros and the village of Støren.

Haltdalen-Røros-Brekken is home to the Haltdalen Training Center, which is used as a training camp for cold-weather warfare by Norwegian and American forces.

==History==
From 1838 until 1972, the village was the administrative centre of the old Haltdalen Municipality. Haltdalen is known for the old Haltdalen Stave Church that was built in the 12th century. The original can be seen at the Sverresborg Museum in Trondheim Municipality. In 2004, a copy of the old stave church was constructed on the grounds of the Haltdalen Church. Also, a replica of the Haltdalen stave church was built in Heimaey in Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland as a gift from Norway to Iceland.

<text>Jack and Jill is a format of competition in partner dancing, where the competing couples are the result of random matching of leaders and followers. Rules of matching vary. 

The name and format were created by Jack Carey at Hank &amp; Stans in Norwalk, California in the early 1950s to encourage a variety of dancers to enter competitions.
The gender-ambiguous term &quot;Pat and Chris&quot; has been used, particularly in LGBT dance venues, to refer to events where the gender of lead and follow isn&#x27;t specified. In the swing dance community, the name &quot;Mix &amp; Match&quot; (M&amp;M) is now used as a gender-neutral, more inclusive name.

In dance competitions J&amp;J is included as a separate division (or divisions, with additional gradations).
J&amp;J is popular at Swing conventions, as well as at ballroom dance competitions in the US.

J&amp;J competitions are intended to test social dance skills, whereas fixed partner &quot;showcase&quot; competitions test performance dance skills.

== Rules ==

Rules vary, depending on country and dance style.

In the UK, it is normal to randomly assign fixed couples, and then keep those couples fixed throughout the competition (for example, if there are multiple rounds). Thus, the winner is largely decided by luck of the draw, with the winning couple often being regular dance partners who were lucky enough to be paired together. As a result, DWAS (Dance With A Stranger) competitions are not taken as seriously as fixed partner competitions.

In the US, Jack &amp; Jill contests are extremely popular in the national West Coast Swing and Lindy Hop communities. Rules vary in events across the country but three rules seem to be standard in most Jack &amp; Jill contests: 1) no pre-arranged choreography is allowed (which would generally be impractical anyway, as partners are assigned randomly), 2) no costumes are allowed, and 3) acrobatic elements such as lifts are not allowed, or only allowed when deemed safe by the judges. However, at the Champion or Invitational level, event organizers will occasionally opt for an &quot;anything goes&quot; Jack &amp; Jill in which no rules apply. Music for each dance is selected at random without the participants&#x27; prior knowledge, though some competitions will allow them to select the tempo (speed) or a sub-style within their dance&#x27;s music (e.g. Blues or contemporary within West Coast Swing). 

Although it is not the case in &quot;every&quot; Jack &amp; Jill contest, it is somewhat typical for dancers to be judged individually, then dancers who make any elimination rounds redraw for new partners. Depending on rules specific to the event/competition, a Jack &amp; Jill competitor may or may not be allowed to dance with their regular competition partner (one that they compete with in a choreographed division). At some events/competitions they are required to redraw; and some events that don&#x27;t have the redraw rule give dancers the option to decline if they draw their regular competition partner but do not &quot;require&quot; them to do so. Some dancers who draw their regular [choreographed division] partner see this &quot;luck&quot; as more of a competition handicap, feeling that the crowd and possibly the judges will more closely scrutinize them, expecting even more of their competition performance than competitors who do not draw their regular partners.

One of the key elements of a Jack &amp; Jill contest in the US West Coast Swing and Lindy Hop communities is the element of improvisation, which is why choreography is not allowed. This improv-based feature can prove to be extremely entertaining as dancers try to coordinate dancing with this new partner while dancing to the specific characteristics of a random song or &quot;expressing musicality&quot;. Since the spirit of improvisation can possibly be dampened by the dancers having drawn their partner, it is often more difficult for the dancers to perform to the expectations of the spectators and the judges. Some dancers, however, are able to perform at or above the expectations depending on various factors, usually unpredictable factors such as the song, the consistency of the dance floor, or even just the simple factor of how they feel at that particular time. This can be compared to the American football adage &quot;(on) Any Given Sunday&quot;.

<doc id="1041190" wikidata="Q1135808" url="?curid=1041190" title="Wet Tropics of Queensland">
<text>The Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Site consists of approximately 8,940 km2 of Australian wet tropical forests growing along the north-east Queensland portion of the Great Dividing Range. The Wet Tropics of Queensland meets all four of the criteria for natural heritage for selection as a World Heritage Site. World Heritage status was declared in 1988, and on 21 May 2007 the Wet Tropics were added to the Australian National Heritage List.

The tropical forests have the highest concentration of primitive flowering plant families in the world. Only Madagascar and New Caledonia, due to their historical isolation, have humid, tropical regions with a comparable level of endemism.

The Wet Tropics rainforests are a biodiversity hotspot and recognised internationally for their ancient ancestry and many unique plants and animals. The area covers 0.1% of the Australian landmass but contains 50 per cent of all the nation&#x27;s species. Many plant and animal species in the Wet Tropics are found nowhere else in the world. The Wet Tropics has the oldest continuously surviving tropical rainforests on earth.

== Indigenous Peoples ==
On 9 November 2012, the Australian Government also acknowledged the Indigenous heritage of the area as being nationally significant. The Aboriginal Rainforest People of the Wet Tropics of Queensland have lived continuously in the rainforest environment for at least 5000 years, and this is the only place in Australia where Aboriginal people have permanently inhabited a tropical rainforest environment.

==Geography==
The Wet Tropics of Queensland stretches in part from Townsville to Cooktown, running in close parallel to the Great Barrier Reef (another World Heritage Site).

The terrain is rugged. The Great Dividing Range and a number of small coastal ranges, highlands, tablelands, foothills and an escarpment dominate the landscape.

The heritage site contains the northern section of the Queensland tropical rain forests including the Daintree Rainforest. 16 different structural types of rainforest have been identified.

The World Heritage area includes Australia&#x27;s highest waterfall, Wallaman Falls. In total it spans 13 major river systems including the Annan, Bloomfield, Daintree, Barron, Mulgrave, Russell, Johnstone, Tully, Herbert, Burdekin, Mitchell, Normanby and Palmer River. Copperlode Falls Dam, Koombooloomba Dam and Paluma Dam are found within the World Heritage Area.

===Protected areas===
15% of the area is protected as national park. Among the national parks included within the Wet Tropics are:
* Barron Gorge National Park
* Kalkajaka National Park
* Cedar Bay National Park
* Daintree National Park
* Girramay National Park
* Girringun National Park
* Kirrama National Park
* Kuranda National Park
* Macalister Range National Park
* Wooroonooran National Park
and over 700 protected areas including privately owned land.

The Wet Tropics Management Authority was established in 1983; it is responsible for managing the site according to Australia&#x27;s obligations under the World Heritage Convention. The agency employed 20 staff in 2012 as a unit within the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection. It is headed by a board of directors responsible to the Wet Tropics Ministerial Council which contains both Queensland and Federal Government representatives.

==Flora==
The site contains many unique features such as over 390 rare plant species, which includes 74 species that are threatened. There are at least 85 species that are endemic to the area, 13 different types of rainforest and 29 species of mangrove, which is more than anywhere else in the country. Of the 19 families of primitive flowering plants worldwide, 12 are found in the Wet Tropics including two families found nowhere else. This includes at least 50 individual species which are endemic to the area.

90 species of orchids have been noted. The large rare trees Stockwellia or Vic Stockwell&#x27;s Puzzle &quot;Stockwellia quadrifida&quot; (Myrtaceae) grow only in restricted areas of &quot;well developed upland rain forest&quot; in the Wet Tropics. They continue living today as descendants of, and very similar to, the ancient Gondwanan fossil species considered one of the Eucalypts&#x27; fossil ancestors, which diversified into so many different species forms of all the Eucalypt plants today. 65% of Australia&#x27;s fern species are protected here, including all seven of the ancient fern species.

==Fauna==
370 species of bird have been recorded in the area. 11 species of those are found nowhere else.

The southern cassowary and rare spotted-tailed quoll are some of the many threatened species, while the musky rat-kangaroo is one of 50 animal species that are unique to this area. The musky rat-kangaroo is significant because it represents an early stage in the evolution of kangaroos. Other rare animals include the yellow-bellied gliders and brush-tailed bettong. 107 mammal species have been identified. Australia&#x27;s rarest mammal, the insectivorous Flores tube-nosed bat (&quot;Murina florium&quot;), is also found here. One quarter of Australia&#x27;s rodent species are found within the Wet Tropics.

113 species of reptiles including 24 endemic species are found in the area and there are 51 amphibian species, of which 22 are endemic. One reason for the very high level of endemism is that the geomorphology is diverse, resulting in habitat islands where distinct subspecies have evolved. Some species are endemic to a specific mountain or groups of mountains.

Around 225 species of butterflies have been discovered in the area, with six endemic species and 14 endemic subspecies. It constitutes approximately 57% of the entire Australian butterfly fauna.

==Climate==
Rainfall in the area varies considerably, with elevation and orientation of the coastline being the major influences. Rainfall averages from 1,200 millimetres (mm) to over 8,000 mm annually. The highest mountains along the escarpment between Cairns and Tully receive the highest rainfall, mainly owing to orographic factors. Mount Bellenden Ker is the wettest recording station in the area with other high peaks and eastern slopes favouring high rainfall. Most of the rainfall occurs from November to April. Tropical cyclones may impact the area.

==Environmental threats==
The expansion of the sugarcane industry in lowland plains poses a significant threat to some endangered ecosystems. Some are fragmented and their natural vegetation is degraded. Invasive pest species are another concern along with internal fragmentation by road and power lines. Insect and mite species are of particular concern because some of them are hard to detect. Some areas are off-limits to the general public to prevent the introduction of Phytophthora. The southern cassowary is often killed by motor vehicles. Feral cats prey on native species. The cats compete with spotted-tailed quolls for food and habitat.

<doc id="1041191" wikidata="Q3570277" url="?curid=1041191" title="Wāpuro rōmaji">
<text>, or kana spelling, is a style of romanization of Japanese originally devised for entering Japanese into while using a Western QWERTY keyboard.

In Japanese, the more formal name is , literally &quot;Roman character kana conversion&quot;. One conversion method has been standardized as JIS X 4063:2000 (Keystroke to KANA Transfer Method Using Latin Letter Key for Japanese Input Method); however, the standard explicitly states that it is intended as a means of input, not as a method of romanization.

 is now frequently employed in general-purpose computer input as well as word processing, but the name lives on. Wāpuro-style romanizations are also frequently used by native speakers of Japanese in informal contexts, as well as by many fans of anime and other aspects of Japanese culture. A common characteristic of these (often online) cases is the avoidance of hard-to-type circumflexes or macrons. Also, some ambiguities in spelling may exist. Spellings are seen that would fail to produce the desired kana when typed on a computer, for example failure to distinguish between (properly entered as &quot;zu&quot;) and (properly entered as &quot;du&quot;).

==Spelling conventions==

In practice, there are as many variants of wāpuro rōmaji as there are manufacturers of word processing and IME software. Many aspects of Hepburn, Kunrei and Nihon-shiki romanizations are accepted, so that both &quot;si&quot; (Kunrei/Nihon-shiki) and &quot;shi&quot; (Hepburn) resolve to . Some conventions, however, differ from standard romanizations:
* Owing to the difficulty of entering diacritics like macrons or circumflexes with standard keyboards (as well as the ambiguity of ō, etc., which in Hepburn can represent either or ) long vowels are almost universally entered following kana spelling rules; thus, &quot;kou&quot; for and &quot;koo&quot; for .
*The Nihon-shiki forms of romanization take precedence over other romanizations. Thus &quot;du&quot; usually produces rather than .
* Small kana can be entered by prefacing them with an &quot;x&quot; or &quot;l&quot;, e.g. &quot;xa&quot; for , or &quot;ltu&quot; for . This is commonly employed for modern katakana combinations like , which would be entered &quot;texi&quot;, &quot;thi&quot;, or &quot;t&#x27;i&quot;. However, on some systems &quot;l&quot; is treated the same as &quot;r&quot; when followed by a vowel or &quot;y&quot;.
* , and may also be romanized as &quot;jya&quot;, &quot;jyu&quot; and &quot;jyo&quot; respectively. This matches the kana closely, but is used by neither Nihon-shiki/Kunrei (which would be &quot;zya, zyu, zyo&quot;) nor Hepburn (&quot;ja, ju, jo&quot;).
* The Hepburn spelling &quot;tchi&quot; for may be rejected, and &quot;tti&quot; or &quot;cchi&quot; may be required instead.
* The Hepburn spelling &quot;mma&quot; is likely to be rendered , not the intended (&quot;nma&quot;). This is not an issue for revised Hepburn, which eliminates the &quot;-mm-&quot; forms in favor of &quot;-nm-&quot;.
* Moraic &quot;n&quot;, , can be entered as &quot;nn&quot;, &quot;n&quot; or &quot;n&#x27;&quot;. While moraic &quot;n&quot; can be typed in simply as &quot;n&quot; in some cases, in other cases it is necessary to type in a non-ambiguous form to prevent the IME from interpreting the &quot;n&quot; as belonging to a kana from the &quot;na&quot; column ( &quot;na&quot;, &quot;ni&quot;, &quot;nu&quot;, &quot;ne&quot;, &quot;no&quot;).
* Phonetic names can often be used for Japanese typographic symbols not found on standard keyboards. For example, in some IMEs ～ can be entered as &quot;nami&quot; (wave) or &quot;kara&quot; (from) and an ellipsis (...) can be entered as &quot;tenten&quot; (point point).

==Phonetic accuracy==
Unlike Kunrei and Hepburn, wāpuro style is based on a one-to-one transcription of the kana. Wāpuro thus does not represent some distinctions observed in spoken Japanese, but not in writing, such as the difference between (long vowel) and (o+u). For example, in standard Japanese the kana can be pronounced in two different ways: as meaning &quot;king&quot; (), and as meaning &quot;to chase&quot; (). Kunrei and Hepburn spell the two differently as &quot;ô&quot;/&quot;ō&quot; and &quot;ou&quot;, because the former is a long vowel while the latter has an &quot;o&quot; that happens to be followed by a &quot;u&quot;; however, wāpuro style simply transcribes the kana and renders them both as &quot;ou&quot;. Likewise, the irregularly spelled particles &quot;wa&quot; (), &quot;e&quot; () and &quot;o&quot; () must be entered as written (&quot;ha&quot;, &quot;he&quot; and &quot;wo&quot; respectively), not as pronounced (unlike Kunrei and Hepburn, which transcribe the pronunciation).

<text>David Robert Hall (5 March 18746 September 1945) was a politician and lawyer in New South Wales, Australia. He came from a political family which included Maggie Hall and he went to leading positions including Attorney General of New South Wales.

==Life==
Hall was born in Harrietville, Victoria. His sisters were Margaret Cable Hall who was known as Maggie, Jeanette and Marion and he had several brothers. His parents, Marion and Thomas had a guest house which was used for political meetings including a visit by Ramsay MacDonald.

He studied law at the University of Sydney before becoming a barrister in 1903. By that time, he had already become involved in state politics, having been elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for the rural electorate of Gunnedah in 1901.

Hall made a switch to federal politics at the 1906 election, contesting the House of Representatives seat of Werriwa for the Labor Party. He was successful, defeating Alfred Conroy, the sitting Free Trade Party member. Hall represented the electorate until 1912, when he resigned mid-term to return to State politics. At the subsequent by-election, the new Labor candidate, Benjamin Bennett, once again defeated Conroy.

On 2 April 1912 New South Wales Premier James McGowen appointed Hall to the Legislative Council and as Minister of Justice. Two days later he was also appointed Solicitor General. Hall moved to the Legislative Assembly when he won the seat of Enmore in December 1913, holding it until 1920. He was Attorney General between 1914 and 1919. Hall was Attorney General in the Holman Labor ministry from 1914 until November 1916 when Holman and his supporters, including Hall, were expelled from the Labor Party for supporting conscription. Holman continued as Premier with the support of the Liberal Reform Party, and Hall continued to be Attorney General, but was no longer Minister of Justice. In 1919 he became Minister for Housing and Vice-President of the Executive Council until February 1920.

Hall was appointed Agent-General for New South Wales in London in February 1920, but this appointment was cancelled in April by the incoming Storey Labor government.

Hall subsequently had a successful career as a solicitor and ran unsuccessfully for the United Australia Party in the Senate in 1937.

He died in Vaucluse on .

<doc id="1041202" wikidata="Q2061070" url="?curid=1041202" title="Wide Awake (1998 film)">
<text>Wide Awake is a 1998 American comedy-drama film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and produced by Cathy Konrad and Cary Woods. Starring Denis Leary, Dana Delany, Joseph Cross, and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, the film follows Cross as a ten-year-old boy who struggles with his grief and Christian faith after the recent loss of his grandfather.

Released by Miramax Films, it was Shyamalan&#x27;s first release by a major studio after his independently produced debut &quot;Praying with Anger&quot; in 1992, and was originally completed in 1995, although creative differences between Shyamalan and executive producer Harvey Weinstein led to significant delays. Being released before Shyamalan&#x27;s widely successful next film &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999), &quot;Wide Awake&quot; went mostly unnoticed upon release, receiving mixed reviews and becoming a box-office failure.

==Plot==

During his fifth grade year, ten-year-old Joshua A. Beal begins a personal search to find answers about life and death — a journey triggered by the passing of his beloved grandfather.

Josh attends Waldron Mercy Academy, a private Catholic boys&#x27; school in Philadelphia. He says that boys who wear a uniform do not smile much. His best friend Dave is often up to mischief, finding ways to cut class. Small for his age, he often gets picked on.

Very close to his grandfather, he misses him terribly. The adults in his world have not been able to convince him that he is in good hands, so he sets out on a personal mission to find God.

In their varying ways Josh is guided on his metaphorical journey by Dave and a Philadelphia Phillies-loving nun who teaches at Waldron. Dave creates a distraction so that Josh can sneak into the girls&#x27; school to meet the cardinal, who he hopes can help him with his faith. However, seeing him up close makes him see that he&#x27;s a fragile old man. Josh tries to convince his family to travel to Rome over the winter break, but his parents quickly realise it&#x27;s part of his quest for God and shoot down his proposal.

Hope, a girl who helps him in the girls&#x27; school, becomes Josh&#x27;s first crush. They meet again at a boy&#x27;s birthday party, and he confesses his feelings for her. Another day, when the boys&#x27; school is invited to watch a ceremony in which the girls&#x27; school offer flowers to the virgin, Hope gives her rose to Josh for his quest.

A series of events happen with Josh&#x27;s classmates. One oddly kidnaps the school&#x27;s framed portrait of the pope, his bully has to leave the school for insufficient funds, after getting stuck in a turnstile with Frank he finally agrees to spend time with him and Dave is diagnosed with epilepsy.

==Cast==

In addition, Julia Stiles appears as Neena Beal, while Michael Craig Bigwood plays the little boy who Joshua learns is an angel.

==Production and release==
The script was written in 1991. Shyamalan has described &quot;Wide Awake&quot; as a comedy that he hoped would also make people cry. While the film was completed in 1995, problems arose upon Shyamalan&#x27;s submission of his final cut with Harvey Weinstein voicing his intentions to recut the film. Shyamalan and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell confronted Weinstein about his decision and the film was buried until 1998 when it was given a very limited release after Shyamalan&#x27;s high profile sale of the spec script for &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Wide Awake&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. 
On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a approval rating based on reviews, with an average score of . In a positive review, Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; characterized it as &quot;a wonderful family film.&quot; He praised Cross as &quot;a marvel, a terrific young actor who expresses beautifully Joshua’s conflicting emotions, his clear intelligence and staunch character.&quot; In a negative review, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized the film as &quot;insufferable.&quot;

==Awards and accolades==
&quot;Wide Awake&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Family Feature – Drama&quot; and &quot;Best Performance in a Feature Film – Leading Young Actor&quot; at the 1999 Young Artist Awards.

<doc id="1041204" wikidata="Q5596712" url="?curid=1041204" title="Granular computing">
<text>Granular computing is an emerging computing paradigm of information processing that concerns the processing of complex information entities called &quot;information granules&quot;, which arise in the process of data abstraction and derivation of knowledge from information or data. Generally speaking, information granules are collections of entities that usually originate at the numeric level and are arranged together due to their similarity, functional or physical adjacency, indistinguishability, coherency, or the like.

At present, granular computing is more a &quot;theoretical perspective&quot; than a coherent set of methods or principles. As a theoretical perspective, it encourages an approach to data that recognizes and exploits the knowledge present in data at various levels of resolution or scales. In this sense, it encompasses all methods which provide flexibility and adaptability in the resolution at which knowledge or information is extracted and represented.

== Types of granulation ==
 
As mentioned above, &quot;granular computing&quot; is not an algorithm or process; there is no particular method that is called &quot;granular computing&quot;. It is rather an approach to looking at data that recognizes how different and interesting regularities in the data can appear at different levels of granularity, much as different features become salient in satellite images of greater or lesser resolution. On a low-resolution satellite image, for example, one might notice interesting cloud patterns representing cyclones or other large-scale weather phenomena, while in a higher-resolution image, one misses these large-scale atmospheric phenomena but instead notices smaller-scale phenomena, such as the interesting pattern that is the streets of Manhattan. The same is generally true of all data: At different resolutions or granularities, different features and relationships emerge. The aim of granular computing is to try to take advantage of this fact in designing more effective machine-learning and reasoning systems.

There are several types of granularity that are often encountered in data mining and machine learning, and we review them below:

=== Value granulation (discretization/quantization) ===
One type of granulation is the quantization of variables. It is very common that in data mining or machine-learning applications the resolution of variables needs to be &quot;decreased&quot; in order to extract meaningful regularities. An example of this would be a variable such as &quot;outside temperature&quot; (), which in a given application might be recorded to several decimal places of precision (depending on the sensing apparatus). However, for purposes of extracting relationships between &quot;outside temperature&quot; and, say, &quot;number of health-club applications&quot; (), it will generally be advantageous to quantize &quot;outside temperature&quot; into a smaller number of intervals.

==== Motivations ====
There are several interrelated reasons for granulating variables in this fashion:
* Based on prior domain knowledge, there is no expectation that minute variations in temperature (e.g., the difference between ) could have an influence on behaviors driving the number of health-club applications. For this reason, any &quot;regularity&quot; which our learning algorithms might detect at this level of resolution would have to be &quot;spurious&quot;, as an artifact of overfitting. By coarsening the temperature variable into intervals the difference between which we &quot;do&quot; anticipate (based on prior domain knowledge) might influence number of health-club applications, we eliminate the possibility of detecting these spurious patterns. Thus, in this case, reducing resolution is a method of controlling overfitting.
* By reducing the number of intervals in the temperature variable (i.e., increasing its &quot;grain size&quot;), we increase the amount of sample data indexed by each interval designation. Thus, by coarsening the variable, we increase sample sizes and achieve better statistical estimation. In this sense, increasing granularity provides an antidote to the so-called &quot;curse of dimensionality&quot;, which relates to the exponential decrease in statistical power with increase in number of dimensions or variable cardinality.
*Independent of prior domain knowledge, it is often the case that meaningful regularities (i.e., which can be detected by a given learning methodology, representational language, etc.) may exist at one level of resolution and not at another.
For example, a simple learner or pattern recognition system may seek to extract regularities satisfying a conditional probability threshold such as formula_1 In the special case where formula_2 this recognition system is essentially detecting &quot;logical implication&quot; of the form formula_3 or, in words, &quot;if formula_4 then The system&#x27;s ability to recognize such implications (or, in general, conditional probabilities exceeding threshold) is partially contingent on the resolution with which the system analyzes the variables.

As an example of this last point, consider the feature space shown to the right. The variables may each be regarded at two different resolutions. Variable formula_5 may be regarded at a high (quaternary) resolution wherein it takes on the four values formula_6 or at a lower (binary) resolution wherein it takes on the two values formula_7 Similarly, variable formula_8 may be regarded at a high (quaternary) resolution or at a lower (binary) resolution, where it takes on the values formula_9 or formula_10 respectively. At the high resolution, there are no detectable implications of the form formula_11 since every formula_12 is associated with more than one formula_13 and thus, for all formula_14 formula_15 However, at the low (binary) variable resolution, two bilateral implications become detectable: formula_16 and formula_17, since every formula_18 occurs &quot;iff&quot; formula_19 and formula_20 occurs &quot;iff&quot; formula_21 Thus, a pattern recognition system scanning for implications of this kind would find them at the binary variable resolution, but would fail to find them at the higher quaternary variable resolution.

====Issues and methods====
It is not feasible to exhaustively test all possible discretization resolutions on all variables in order to see which combination of resolutions yields interesting or significant results. Instead, the feature space must be preprocessed (often by an entropy analysis of some kind) so that some guidance can be given as to how the discretization process should proceed. Moreover, one cannot generally achieve good results by naively analyzing and discretizing each variable independently, since this may obliterate the very interactions that we had hoped to discover.

A sample of papers that address the problem of variable discretization in general, and multiple-variable discretization in particular, is as follows: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 

=== Variable granulation (clustering/aggregation/transformation) ===
Variable granulation is a term that could describe a variety of techniques, most of which are aimed at reducing dimensionality, redundancy, and storage requirements. We briefly describe some of the ideas here, and present pointers to the literature.

====Variable transformation====
A number of classical methods, such as principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling, and their relatives, fall under the genus of &quot;variable transformation.&quot; Also in this category are more modern areas of study such as dimensionality reduction, projection pursuit, and independent component analysis. The common goal of these methods in general is to find a representation of the data in terms of new variables, which are a linear or nonlinear transformation of the original variables, and in which important statistical relationships emerge. The resulting variable sets are almost always smaller than the original variable set, and hence these methods can be loosely said to impose a granulation on the feature space. These dimensionality reduction methods are all reviewed in the standard texts, such as , , and .

====Variable aggregation====
A different class of variable granulation methods derive more from data clustering methodologies than from the linear systems theory informing the above methods. It was noted fairly early that one may consider &quot;clustering&quot; related variables in just the same way that one considers clustering related data. In data clustering, one identifies a group of similar entities (using a &quot;measure of similarity&quot; suitable to the domain — ), and then in some sense &quot;replaces&quot; those entities with a prototype of some kind. The prototype may be the simple average of the data in the identified cluster, or some other representative measure. But the key idea is that in subsequent operations, we may be able to use the single prototype for the data cluster (along with perhaps a statistical model describing how exemplars are derived from the prototype) to &quot;stand in&quot; for the much larger set of exemplars. These prototypes are generally such as to capture most of the information of interest concerning the entities.
Similarly, it is reasonable to ask whether a large set of variables might be aggregated into a smaller set of &quot;prototype&quot; variables that capture the most salient relationships between the variables. Although variable clustering methods based on linear correlation have been proposed (;), more powerful methods of variable clustering are based on the mutual information between variables. Watanabe has shown (;) that for any set of variables one can construct a &quot;polytomic&quot; (i.e., n-ary) tree representing a series of variable agglomerations in which the ultimate &quot;total&quot; correlation among the complete variable set is the sum of the &quot;partial&quot; correlations exhibited by each agglomerating subset (see figure). Watanabe suggests that an observer might seek to thus partition a system in such a way as to minimize the interdependence between the parts &quot;... as if they were looking for a natural division or a hidden crack.&quot;

One practical approach to building such a tree is to successively choose for agglomeration the two variables (either atomic variables or previously agglomerated variables) which have the highest pairwise mutual information . The product of each agglomeration is a new (constructed) variable that reflects the local joint distribution of the two agglomerating variables, and thus possesses an entropy equal to their joint entropy.
(From a procedural standpoint, this agglomeration step involves replacing two columns in the attribute-value table—representing the two agglomerating variables—with a single column that has a unique value for every unique combination of values in the replaced columns . No information is lost by such an operation; however, if one is exploring the data for inter-variable relationships, it would generally &quot;not&quot; be desirable to merge redundant variables in this way, since in such a context it is likely to be precisely the redundancy or &quot;dependency&quot; between variables that is of interest; and once redundant variables are merged, their relationship to one another can no longer be studied.

=== System granulation (aggregation) ===

In database systems, aggregations (see e.g. OLAP aggregation and Business intelligence systems) result in transforming original data tables (often called information systems) into the tables with different semantics of rows and columns, wherein the rows correspond to the groups (granules) of original tuples and the columns express aggregated information about original values within each of the groups. Such aggregations are usually based on SQL and its extensions. The resulting granules usually correspond to the groups of original tuples with the same values (or ranges) over some pre-selected original columns.

There are also other approaches wherein the groups are defined basing on, e.g., physical adjacency of rows. For example, Infobright implemented a database engine wherein data was partitioned onto &quot;rough rows&quot;, each consisting of 64K of physically consecutive (or almost consecutive) rows. Rough rows were automatically labeled with compact information about their values on data columns, often involving multi-column and multi-table relationships. It resulted in a higher layer of granulated information where objects corresponded to rough rows and attributes - to various aspects of rough information. Database operations could be efficiently supported within such a new framework, with an access to the original data pieces still available .

=== Concept granulation (component analysis) ===
The origins of the &quot;granular computing&quot; ideology are to be found in the rough sets and fuzzy sets literatures. One of the key insights of rough set research—although by no means unique to it—is that, in general, the selection of different sets of features or variables will yield different &quot;concept&quot; granulations. Here, as in elementary rough set theory, by &quot;concept&quot; we mean a set of entities that are &quot;indistinguishable&quot; or &quot;indiscernible&quot; to the observer (i.e., a simple concept), or a set of entities that is composed from such simple concepts (i.e., a complex concept). To put it in other words, by projecting a data set (value-attribute system) onto different sets of variables, we recognize alternative sets of equivalence-class &quot;concepts&quot; in the data, and these different sets of concepts will in general be conducive to the extraction of different relationships and regularities.

====Equivalence class granulation====
We illustrate with an example. Consider the attribute-value system below:

When the full set of attributes formula_22 is considered, we see that we have the following seven equivalence classes or primitive (simple) concepts:

:formula_23

Thus, the two objects within the first equivalence class, formula_24 cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes, and the three objects within the second equivalence class, formula_25 cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes. The remaining five objects are each discernible from all other objects. Now, let us imagine a projection of the attribute value system onto attribute formula_26 alone, which would represent, for example, the view from an observer which is only capable of detecting this single attribute. Then we obtain the following much coarser equivalence class structure.

:formula_27

This is in a certain regard the same structure as before, but at a lower degree of resolution (larger grain size). Just as in the case of value granulation (discretization/quantization), it is possible that relationships (dependencies) may emerge at one level of granularity that are not present at another. As an example of this, we can consider the effect of concept granulation on the measure known as &quot;attribute dependency&quot; (a simpler relative of the mutual information).

To establish this notion of dependency (see also rough sets), let formula_28 represent a particular concept granulation, where each formula_29 is an equivalence class from the concept structure induced by attribute set . For example, if the attribute set consists of attribute formula_26 alone, as above, then the concept structure formula_31 will be composed of 
:formula_32 
The dependency of attribute set on another attribute set , formula_33 is given by

:formula_34

That is, for each equivalence class formula_29 in formula_36 we add up the size of its &quot;lower approximation&quot; (see rough sets) by the attributes in , i.e., formula_37 More simply, this approximation is the number of objects which on attribute set can be positively identified as belonging to target set formula_38 Added across all equivalence classes in formula_36 the numerator above represents the total number of objects which—based on attribute set —can be positively categorized according to the classification induced by attributes . The dependency ratio therefore expresses the proportion (within the entire universe) of such classifiable objects, in a sense capturing the &quot;synchronization&quot; of the two concept structures formula_31 and formula_41 The dependency formula_42 &quot;can be interpreted as a proportion of such objects in the information system for which it suffices to know the values of attributes in to determine the values of attributes in &quot; (Ziarko &amp; Shan 1995).

Having gotten definitions now out of the way, we can make the simple observation that the choice of concept granularity (i.e., choice of attributes) will influence the detected dependencies among attributes. Consider again the attribute value table from above:

Consider the dependency of attribute set formula_43 on attribute set formula_44 That is, we wish to know what proportion of objects can be correctly classified into classes of formula_31 based on knowledge of formula_41 The equivalence classes of formula_31 and of formula_48 are shown below.

The objects that can be &quot;definitively&quot; categorized according to concept structure formula_31 based on formula_48 are those in the set formula_51 and since there are six of these, the dependency of on , formula_52 This might be considered an interesting dependency in its own right, but perhaps in a particular data mining application only stronger dependencies are desired.

We might then consider the dependency of the smaller attribute set formula_53 on the attribute set formula_44 The move from formula_43 to formula_53 induces a coarsening of the class structure formula_36 as will be seen shortly. We wish again to know what proportion of objects can be correctly classified into the (now larger) classes of formula_31 based on knowledge of formula_41 The equivalence classes of the new formula_31 and of formula_48 are shown below.

Clearly, formula_31 has a coarser granularity than it did earlier. The objects that can now be &quot;definitively&quot; categorized according to the concept structure formula_31 based on formula_48 constitute the complete universe formula_65, and thus the dependency of on , formula_66 That is, knowledge of membership according to category set formula_48 is adequate to determine category membership in formula_31 with complete certainty; In this case we might say that formula_69 Thus, by coarsening the concept structure, we were able to find a stronger (deterministic) dependency. However, we also note that the classes induced in formula_31 from the reduction in resolution necessary to obtain this deterministic dependency are now themselves large and few in number; as a result, the dependency we found, while strong, may be less valuable to us than the weaker dependency found earlier under the higher resolution view of formula_71

In general it is not possible to test all sets of attributes to see which induced concept structures yield the strongest dependencies, and this search must be therefore be guided with some intelligence. Papers which discuss this issue, and others relating to intelligent use of granulation, are those by Y.Y. Yao and Lotfi Zadeh listed in the #References below.

====Component granulation====
Another perspective on concept granulation may be obtained from work on parametric models of categories. In mixture model learning, for example, a set of data is explained as a mixture of distinct Gaussian (or other) distributions. Thus, a large amount of data is &quot;replaced&quot; by a small number of distributions. The choice of the number of these distributions, and their size, can again be viewed as a problem of &quot;concept granulation&quot;. In general, a better fit to the data is obtained by a larger number of distributions or parameters, but in order to extract meaningful patterns, it is necessary to constrain the number of distributions, thus deliberately &quot;coarsening&quot; the concept resolution. Finding the &quot;right&quot; concept resolution is a tricky problem for which many methods have been proposed (e.g., AIC, BIC, MDL, etc.), and these are frequently considered under the rubric of &quot;model regularization&quot;.

==Different interpretations of granular computing==
Granular computing can be conceived as a framework of theories, methodologies, techniques, and tools that make use of information granules in the process of problem solving. In this sense, granular computing is used as an umbrella term to cover topics that have been studied in various fields in isolation. By examining all of these existing studies in light of the unified framework of granular computing and extracting their commonalities, it may be possible to develop a general theory for problem solving.

In a more philosophical sense, granular computing can describe a way of thinking that relies on the human ability to perceive the real world under various levels of granularity (i.e., abstraction) in order to abstract and consider only those things that serve a specific interest and to switch among different granularities. By focusing on different levels of granularity, one can obtain different levels of knowledge, as well as a greater understanding of the inherent knowledge structure. Granular computing is thus essential in human problem solving and hence has a very significant impact on the design and implementation of intelligent systems.

<text>Michael Barrett Watson known professionally as Barry Watson (born April 23, 1974) is an American actor known for his roles of Matt Camden on &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, Brian Davis in &quot;What About Brian&quot;, Todd Deepler in &quot;Samantha Who?&quot; and Lachlan Murdoch in &quot;The Loudest Voice&quot;.

==Early life==
Watson was one of four children of Karen, a paralegal, and Michael Watson, an attorney.

==Career==
Watson had guest spots in several television series such as &quot;Baywatch&quot; and &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;. Eventually he was chosen for a minor role on the Aaron Spelling series &quot;Malibu Shores&quot;. Though his role was brief, it led him to Aaron Spelling&#x27;s next project, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;.

It was on The WB&#x27;s &quot;7th Heaven&quot; that Watson finally gained much recognition for his portrayal as Matt Camden. Watson said in 2016 that his mindset at the time was one of wanting to get paid despite his unsureness in the project or why the people involved wanted him to participate in the first place. He stopped being a full-time regular after the sixth season, mainly due to his cancer diagnosis, but continued in a recurring and guest star status on the show until its 10th season. In his break from acting on &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, he was brought in to write an episode by series creator and producer Brenda Hampton. He did not appear at all during the eleventh and final season.

In 1999, he starred in his first feature film with fellow WB star Katie Holmes in &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot;. Watson hoped that his role in the film would help him avoid being pigeonholed by his role in &quot;7th Heaven&quot;. During the production, Watson felt &quot;strange&quot; at times due to his being the only male on set, but had &quot;an amazing experience&quot; working with his co-stars. Watson directed two episodes of &quot;7th Heaven&quot; in 2005, and likewise directed one episode of &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot; in 2010. 

In 2002, Watson had a starring role as Dave and his alter ego Daisy in &quot;Sorority Boys&quot;; his performance was met with a mixed reception amid the film being panned. In a negative review, Lindy Keffer of pluggedin.com lamented that Watson&#x27;s presence in the film would bring it additional attention. 
On April 16, 2006, Watson starred as the lead character, Brian Davis, in the ABC series &quot;What About Brian&quot;. The show ended its run on March 26, 2007. Watson also starred as Todd in the ABC series &quot;Samantha Who?&quot; In 2011, he played Pax in &quot;My Future Boyfriend&quot;, an ABC Family original movie. In 2012, Watson appeared on &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; as Serena Van der Woodsen&#x27;s boyfriend.

In 2014, he enjoyed guest-starring roles on the television shows &quot;Masters of Sex&quot; and &quot;Hart of Dixie&quot;. He also starred in the television films &quot;Far from Home&quot; and &quot;The Santa Con&quot;.

In 2019, Watson starred in the Showtime drama &quot;The Loudest Voice&quot;, which tells the story of Roger Ailes and the rise of Fox News. Watson played Lachlan Murdoch, the son of media mogul and owner of News Corp, Rupert Murdoch.

==Personal life==
Watson has been married three times. His first marriage was to Laura Payne-Gabriel, whom he met through actress Tori Spelling. He and Tracy Hutson had their first son, Oliver, in May 2005, and their second son in November 2007, Felix Watson. They parted in 2010. In May 2012, Watson and girlfriend Natasha Gregson Wagner, daughter of actress Natalie Wood, had a daughter. They married on December 21, 2014.

<doc id="1041213" wikidata="Q1186804" url="?curid=1041213" title="Norwegian Trekking Association">
<text>The Norwegian Trekking Association (, DNT) is a Norwegian association which maintains mountain trails and cabins in Norway. The association was founded on 21 January 1868 with the scope &quot;to help and develop tourism in this country&quot;. Today the goal is to work for simple, secure and environmentally friendly outdoor activities. DNT has currently more than 300,000 individual members, and 57 local chapters. It also has several &quot;honorary members&quot;, prominent people who have shown a keen interest in Norwegian nature and given the country publicity as a tourist destination, among them Kofi Annan and Katie Melua. The secretary-general of the association is Dag Terje Klarp Solvang.

The mountains of Norway have always been utilised by the Norwegian people since the first Norwegians followed the reindeer when the ice cap retracted ten thousand years ago.

DNT&#x27;s first hut was Krokan by the Rjukan waterfall. The waterfall was later harnessed for hydropower production and the hut was sold. Today it is re-opened, situated by the main road from Tinn to Vinje. Together with local organisations all over Norway, it operates more than 550 cabins in Norwegian mountains and forest areas.

Olav Thon, a Norwegian real-estate investor and hobby trekker, has so far donated to the association. The money has been spent to build new and refurbish existing cabins.

==Using the huts==
Forty one of the huts are staffed. The rest are self-service, some with provisions and some without. The self-service huts are occasionally locked, and to use them it is necessary to get a key from the DNT for a NOK 100 deposit (if the key is returned, so is the money). Every self-service hut contains a stack of debit/credit card forms for payment. This form must be filled out at the conclusion of a stay and dropped into the payment box. You must register before using a bunk.

Most self-service huts have solar panels, and therefore electricity, but no running water, so they are usually located very close to a river from which buckets may be filled. Before leaving a self-service hut, it is considered good etiquette to carry in firewood, do the dishes, clean the floor and (if necessary) lock the door behind you.

<doc id="1041214" wikidata="Q643003" url="?curid=1041214" title="Proportional counter">
<text>The proportional counter is a type of gaseous ionization detector device used to measure particles of ionizing radiation. The key feature is its ability to measure the energy of incident radiation, by producing a detector output pulse that is &quot;proportional&quot; to the radiation energy absorbed by the detector due to an ionizing event; hence the detector&#x27;s name. It is widely used where energy levels of incident radiation must be known, such as in the discrimination between alpha and beta particles, or accurate measurement of X-ray radiation dose.
A proportional counter uses a combination of the mechanisms of a Geiger–Müller tube and an ionization chamber, and operates in an intermediate voltage region between these. The accompanying plot shows the proportional counter operating voltage region for a co-axial cylinder arrangement.

==Operation==
In a proportional counter the fill gas of the chamber is an inert gas which is ionized by incident radiation, and a quench gas to ensure each pulse discharge terminates; a common mixture is 90% argon, 10% methane, known as P-10. An ionizing particle entering the gas collides with an atom of the inert gas and ionizes it to produce an electron and a positively charged ion, commonly known as an &quot;ion pair&quot;. As the ionizing particle travels through the chamber it leaves a trail of ion pairs along its trajectory, the number of which is proportional to the energy of the particle if it is fully stopped within the gas. Typically a 1 MeV stopped particle will create about 30,000 ion pairs.

The chamber geometry and the applied voltage is such that in most of the chamber the electric field strength is low and the chamber acts as an ion chamber. However, the field is strong enough to prevent re-combination of the ion pairs and causes positive ions to drift towards the cathode and electrons towards the anode. This is the &quot;ion drift&quot; region. In the immediate vicinity of the anode wire, the field strength becomes large enough to produce Townsend avalanches. This avalanche region occurs only fractions of a millimeter from the anode wire, which itself is of a very small diameter. The purpose of this is to use the multiplication effect of the avalanche produced by each ion pair. This is the &quot;avalanche&quot; region.

A key design goal is that each original ionizing event due to incident radiation produces only one avalanche. This is to ensure proportionality between the number of original events and the total ion current. For this reason, the applied voltage, the geometry of the chamber and the diameter of the anode wire are critical to ensure proportional operation. If avalanches start to self-multiply due to UV photons as they do in a Geiger–Muller tube, then the counter enters a region of &quot;limited proportionality&quot; until at a higher applied voltage the Geiger discharge mechanism occurs with complete ionization of the gas enveloping the anode wire and consequent loss of particle energy information.

Therefore, it can be said that the proportional counter has the key design feature of two distinct ionization regions:
#Ion drift region: in the outer volume of the chamber – the creation of number ion pairs proportional to incident radiation energy.
#Avalanche region: in the immediate vicinity of the anode – charge amplification of ion pair currents, while maintaining localized avalanches.

The process of charge amplification greatly improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the detector and reduces the subsequent electronic amplification required.

In summary, the proportional counter is an ingenious combination of two ionization mechanisms in one chamber which finds wide practical use.

===Gas mixtures===
Usually the detector is filled with a noble gas; they have the lowest ionization voltages and do not degrade chemically. Typically neon, argon, krypton or xenon are used. Low-energy x-rays are best detected with lighter nuclei (neon), which are less sensitive to higher-energy photons. Krypton or xenon are chosen when for higher-energy x-rays or for higher desired efficiency.

Often the main gas is mixed with a quenching additive. A popular mixture is P10 (10% methane, 90% argon).

Typical working pressure is 1 atmosphere (about 100 kPa).

==Signal amplification by multiplication==
In the case of a cylindrical proportional counter the multiplication, M, of the signal caused by an avalanche can be modeled as follows: 
: formula_1
Where a is the anode wire radius, b is the radius of the counter, p is the pressure of the gas, and V is the operating voltage. K is a property of the gas used and relates the energy needed to cause an avalanche to the pressure of the gas. The final term formula_2 gives the change in voltage caused by an avalanche.

==Applications==

===Spectroscopy===
The proportionality between the energy of the charged particle traveling through the chamber and the total charge created makes proportional counters useful for charged particle spectroscopy. By measuring the total charge (time integral of the electric current) between the electrodes, we can determine the particle&#x27;s kinetic energy because the number of ion pairs created by the incident ionizing charged particle is proportional to its energy. The energy resolution of a proportional counter, however, is limited because both the initial ionization event and the subsequent &#x27;multiplication&#x27; event are subject to statistical fluctuations characterized by a standard deviation equal to the square root of the average number formed. However, in practice these are not as great as would be predicted due to the effect of the empirical Fano factor which reduces these fluctuations. In the case of argon, this is experimentally about 0.2.

===Photon detection===
Proportional counters are also useful for detection of high energy photons, such as gamma-rays, provided these can penetrate the entrance window. They are also used for the detection of X-rays to below 1 keV energy levels, using thin-walled tubes operating at or around atmospheric pressure.

===Radioactive contamination detection===
Proportional counters in the form of large area planar detectors are used extensively to check for radioactive contamination on personnel, flat surfaces, tools, and items of clothing. This is normally in the form of installed instrumentation because of the difficulties of providing portable gas supplies for hand-held devices. They are constructed with a large area detection window made from such as metalized mylar which forms one wall of the detection chamber and is part of the cathode. The anode wire is routed in a convoluted manner within the detector chamber to optimize the detection efficiency. They are normally used to detect alpha and beta particles, and can enable discrimination between them by providing a pulse output proportional to the energy deposited in the chamber by each particle. They have a high efficiency for beta, but lower for alpha. The efficiency reduction for alpha is due to the attenuation effect of the entry window, though distance from the surface being checked also has a significant effect, and ideally a source of alpha radiation should be less than 10mm from the detector due to attenuation in air.

These chambers operate at very slight positive pressure above ambient atmospheric pressure. The gas can be sealed in the chamber, or can be changed continuously, in which case they are known as &quot;gas-flow proportional counters&quot;. Gas flow types have the advantage that they will tolerate small holes in the mylar screen which can occur in use, but they do require a continuous gas supply.

===Guidance on application use===
In the United Kingdom the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has issued a user guidance note on selecting the correct radiation measurement instrument for the application concerned. This covers all radiation instrument technologies and is a useful comparative guide to the use of proportional counters.

<doc id="1041230" wikidata="Q402880" url="?curid=1041230" title="Beeline (brand)">
<text>Beeline () is a mobile network operator brand operating in Russia under PJSC VimpelCom, and in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan under VEON Ltd. Beeline is Russia&#x27;s fourth-largest mobile network operator, and main competitors being MTS, MegaFon and T2.

Since 2009, PJSC VimpelCom had been a subsidiary of the Amsterdam based VimpelCom Ltd, which became VEON in 2017. On 9 October 2023, VEON sold Beeline in Russia and completed its exit from Russia, leaving the brand &quot;Beeline&quot; owned by PJSC VimpelCom in Russia and by VEON Ltd. in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.

The commercial service was launched under the Beeline brand, a brand developed by Fabela in late 1993 to differentiate the company as a youthful and fun company, rather than a technical company. The name comes from the English term &quot;beeline&quot;, meaning the most direct way between two points. VimpelCom relaunched Beeline with the current characteristic black-and-yellow striped circle in 2005 with a campaign to associate the brand with the principles of brightness, friendliness, effectiveness, simplicity, and positive emotions; with a new slogan &quot;Живи на яркой стороне&quot; (&quot;Live on the vibrant side&quot;). The rebranding campaign was hugely successful and the principles associated with the brand &quot;captured hearts and minds&quot;, in the words of the company.

==Current markets==
===Russia===
OJSC VimpelCom was founded in 1992 and initially operated AMPS/D-AMPS network in the Moscow area. In 1996 it became an Extel GSM, the first Russian company listed on the New York Stock Exchange ().

In November 2005, OJSC VimpelCom stepped further with foreign acquisitions by acquiring 100% of Ukrainian RadioSystems, a marginal Ukrainian GSM operator operating under the Wellcom and Mobi brands. The deal has been surrounded by a controversy involving two major shareholders of VimpelCom: the Russian Alfa Group and Telenor, the incumbent Norwegian telecommunications company.

By July 2008, the company&#x27;s license portfolio covered a territory where 97% of Russia&#x27;s population resides, as well as 100% of the territory of Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Georgia and Armenia. VimpelCom also has a 49.9% stake in Euroset, the largest mobile retailer in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). In May 2010, VimpelCom merged with Kyivstar to form VimpelCom Ltd., the largest telecom operator group in the CIS. Alexander Izosimov, CEO of OJSC VimpelCom, was appointed president.

In August 2024, Beeline abandoned the 3G frequency range in Moscow, the first Russian mobile operator to complete a project to redistribute its own frequency bands from 3G to 4G. On 13 December 2024, Beeline abandoned the 3G frequency range in Saint Petersburg and the Leningrad Oblast.

===Kazakhstan===
In 2004, PJSC VimpelCom, in its first move outside Russia&#x27;s territory, acquired Kazakhstani cellular operator KaR-Tel (brand names K-Mobile and Excess).

===Kyrgyzstan===

Beeline is active in Kyrgyzstan and it is one of the most popular cellular carriers in the country. The first call on GSM network of Kyrgyzstan was made on 1 August 1998. In 2001, the trade name MobiCard was established that turned into the brand Mobi in 2007. In 2009, the company started to provide services under international brand Beeline. As of 2022, the company provides services in standards of GSM-900/1800 and WCDMA/UMTS 2100/900 (3G) and LTE 800/1800/2100/2600 (4G).

===Uzbekistan===
Beeline is active in Uzbekistan and it is one of the most popular cellular carriers in Uzbekistan.

==Former markets==
===Armenia===

On 16 November 2006, PJSC VimpelCom acquired the 90% share of Armentel CJSC (renamed to VEON Armenia in 2017), held by the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA (OTE) for €341.9 million.

In 2020, Team CJSC, founded by Armenian businessmen Hayk and Alexander Yesayan, acquired 100% of the shares of &quot;VEON Armenia&quot; and started offering services under the name &quot;Team&quot;.

===Australia===
In November 2018, it was observed that Beeline owned a range of 1000 numbers with the +61 country code, from +61497906000 to +61497906999. Unfortunately, numbers in this range have been used for a technical support scam, posing as a Windows Help Desk in cold calls to Australian and New Zealand numbers.

===Georgia===

The first mobile call with VEON Georgia (brand Beeline) was initiated on 15 March 2007. From this time onward, the company has been actively developing and as of today, it provides 1.3 million customers with 2G GSM 900/1800 MHz, 3G 2100 MHz, 4G 800/1800 MHz and 5G wireless services under the name &quot;Cellfie&quot;. Beeline was later bought out by a Georgian businessman and is no longer owned by Vimpelcom or VEON, being later rebranded to &quot;Cellfie&quot;.

===Laos===
In 2011, Beeline entered Laos as VimpelCom Lao, replacing former Tigo. 22% shareholding remains with the Lao government. 3G HSPA+ services began in January 2012. Numbers on Beeline Laos are 020-7xxx-xxxx. Beeline Laos 4G LTE is expected to be launched soon. Now it is on a trial period.

=== Ukraine ===

Beeline Ukraine (known as Ukrainian RadioSystems (URS) before February 2007) was a mobile operator in Ukraine with 2.22 million GSM subscribers (February 2007). The company operated under Beeline brand. In 2010 Beeline merged with Kyivstar. Now all Beeline Ukraine subscribers became Kyivstar subscribers.

The company was founded in 1995, and Motorola acquired 49% of the company in 1996. URS obtained a GSM-900 license in 1997, but Motorola backed off the venture the same year due to an alleged government favoritism to another mobile operator. The Korean Daewoo acquired ownership, although it failed to grow the business, and eventually sold it to a Ukrainian financial group in 2003. In November 2005, 100% of the company&#x27;s ownership was acquired by the Russian VimpelCom for $230 million. The deal was surrounded by a controversy involving two major shareholders of VimpelCom: the Russian Alfa Group and Telenor, a Norwegian telecom conglomerate.

Following the acquisition by VimpelCom, all of the company&#x27;s services have been rebranded as Beeline, similar to a VimpelCom&#x27;s major mobile assets in Russia. In 2010 Beeline Ukraine (URS) was merged with Kyivstar. Now the company operates only under Kyivstar brand.

===Vietnam===
In July 2009, VimpelCom cooperated with a Vietnamese telecommunication company, GTel Telecommunications, to open a new mobile phone network in Vietnam called Beeline Vietnam. However, in 2012, after three years of business losses, Beeline withdrew from the joint venture and the Vietnamese market in general. Gtel Mobile continues to exploit the remaining base in Vietnam with a new brand, Gmobile.

<text>Álex Mauricio Pineda Chacón (born 19 December 1969) is a retired Honduran footballer who played as a midfielder.

==Professional career==
Chacón spent most of his career with Club Olimpia of Honduras, joining the side in 1988, and leading the team to two Honduran championships and a CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup in 1988. He later played with UA Tamaulipas of Mexico during the 1993–94 season, and then for Sporting Cristal of Peru during the 1994–95 season, appearing in four Copa Libertadores matches.

In 2001, Chacón joined Major League Soccer side Miami Fusion. During the 2001 season, Chacón played a crucial attacking role on a team stacked with offensive talent, including Preki, Diego Serna, Ian Bishop, and Chris Henderson. Chacón registered 19 goals and 9 assists for the team and led the league in goals and points. He was recognized with the MLS Most Valuable Player Award.

The Fusion were contracted after the 2001 season along with the Tampa Bay Mutiny, and he was unable to recapture the form that served him well in his first year. He was selected by the New England Revolution in the 2002 MLS Dispersal Draft, but the emergence of Taylor Twellman and the arrival of a new manager Steve Nicol led to a diminished role on the squad for Chacón. He moved to the Los Angeles Galaxy after the 2002 season and soon later to the Columbus Crew, but neither move reinvigorated his career.

After the 2003 season, Chacón, without a place in MLS, moved to the American A-League, where he found plenty of playing time for the Atlanta Silverbacks. Although he only registered 3 goals and 2 assists in 2004, Chacón&#x27;s leadership was recognized with a selection to the A-League All-League first team.

==International career==
Pineda Chacón made his debut for Honduras in a December 1992 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Costa Rica and has earned a total of 45 caps, scoring 5 goals. He has represented his country in 12 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and played at the 1993 UNCAF Nations Cup as well as at the 1993, 1996, 1998 and 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cups.

His final international was an April 2000 FIFA World Cup qualification against Nicaragua.

===International goals===
==Coaching career==
Chacón joined the Silverbacks as an assistant coach in 2007. The squad when on hiatus for the 2008 and 2009 seasons, but Chacón remained in the role. While the club was being restructured, he coached youth soccer club Forsyth Fusion, now known as the United Futbol Academy.

After four years with the club as an assistant, he was named head coach on 7 November 2011.

Álex Pineda Chacón has been released from his duties Coaching the Silverbacks in June 2012 after an unsuccessful season.

<doc id="1041240" wikidata="Q1754791" url="?curid=1041240" title="Louder Than Bombs">
<text>Louder Than Bombs is a compilation album by English rock band the Smiths, released as a double album in March 1987 by their American record company, Sire Records. It peaked at number 62 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. Popular demand prompted their British record company, Rough Trade, to issue the album domestically as well. Upon its release in the UK in May 1987, it reached No. 38 on the British charts. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 365 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and ranked No. 369 on a 2012 revised list. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1990.

==Release==
The album was released as the American counterpart to their recent British compilation &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; and consisted of all singles and nearly all B-sides that had not at that point been available in the United States, either on single or album, with a few other tracks added. The title is borrowed from a line in Elizabeth Smart&#x27;s extended prose poem &quot;By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept&quot;.

The album was intended to be a substitute for both &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; and their 1984 compilation &quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot;, as these had not been released in the United States. This is why the non-single track &quot;This Night Has Opened My Eyes&quot; from &quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot; was included. Single A-sides &quot;This Charming Man&quot; and &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; had already been released in the US as bonus cuts on the LPs &quot;The Smiths&quot; and &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot;, respectively.

As with &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot;, this compilation includes the scrapped single &quot;You Just Haven&#x27;t Earned It Yet, Baby&quot; (passed over in favour of &quot;Shoplifters of the World Unite&quot;), albeit in a different, shorter mix. However, this shorter version of the song was replaced when &quot;Bombs&quot; was reissued in 2011. Additionally, the &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot; version of &quot;Stretch Out and Wait&quot; is the version from the B-side of &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sister&quot;, which features slightly different lyrics. Also of note is the fact that &quot;Ask&quot; appears on both &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot; and &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; in a slightly different and longer mix than its single version.

Due to the album offering several B-sides (as well as the band&#x27;s then-latest single &quot;Sheila Take a Bow&quot;) that had never been collected onto an album before, &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot; became very popular on import with fans in the UK. To avoid high import prices being paid, the Smiths&#x27; UK record company, Rough Trade, decided to release the album as well. The double album retailed at single album price, to help soften criticism from some fans who had already purchased &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; three months earlier.

After WEA acquired the Smiths&#x27; back catalogue in 1992, all Smiths albums were re-released at mid price, including &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot;.

===Packaging===
The cover art for &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot;, designed by Morrissey, features British playwright Shelagh Delaney of Salford, Greater Manchester. The photograph was originally published in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; after Delaney, at the age of 19, made her literary debut with the play &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;. The play inspired many early lyrics written by Morrissey, and the song &quot;This Night Has Opened My Eyes&quot; (included here) is based on the plight of the play&#x27;s heroine, Jo, an unwed mother.

<text>Targeting in politics is widely used in determining the resources of time, money, and manpower to be deployed in political campaigns. Political parties, campaign committees and political action committees prefer to place their resources disproportionately in constituencies where victory is possible, but not assured.

==In the US==
A given constituency may be targeted for one purpose, but not for another. In the US, inner city neighborhoods, with heavy Democratic populations, may not be targeted for legislative seats because the districts are safely Democratic, but will be targeted for Presidential elections to offset strong Republican areas elsewhere.

Targeting has had important side effects. Heavily Democratic or Republican states tend to get little resources because of the emphasis on targeted states. Similarly, heavily Democratic or Republican legislative or Congressional districts are downplayed in significance.

Targeting leads to the magnification of political trends. A constituency that might give the minority party 25% or 30% instead may fall to 10% or 15% over time because of lack of effort by its minority party. Local minority parties may atrophy and die: the majority party may rise to over 95% of the vote in some constituencies.

Because of the negative effects on minority parties in ignored or downplayed constituencies, targeting is becoming increasingly controversial. One strong critic of targeting, Pennsylvania State Rep. Mark B. Cohen of Philadelphia, has opposed targeting by new political organizations, warning that &quot;targeting is counterproductive to the long-range interests of the Democratic Party. Elections are not short-term one-shot events, but recurring long-term events that require long-term organizational efforts in as many places as possible.&quot;

==In the UK==
In the UK, similar processes affect the ways in which some constituencies get far more party attention than others. For example, usually the marginal constituencies in the Midlands receive far more attention from campaigners than either Surrey or the North-East, as they are solidly Conservative and Labour strongholds respectively. Other strategies may inform how seats are targeted, however. In the 2005 UK General Election, the Liberal Democrats targeted seats held by the Conservatives that had comparatively small majorities and were held by prominent Tory MPs such as Oliver Letwin, David Davis and even Michael Howard. In the event, this so-called &quot;decapitation&quot; strategy had hardly any success. Only Tim Collins lost his seat of those targeted.

==In Canada==
In Canada, which has a Westminster system similar to that found in the UK, the spread and effects of targeting are similar to that found in the United Kingdom. Canada, which has seen regionalism play a role in its national politics, will see odd targeting patterns, where a province, Alberta for example, might be ignored by a party which usually does not do well there, the Liberals for example, while an Edmonton, a large city in Alberta, will see heavy targeting as the Liberals attempt to win at least some representation from that province. The biggest contrast with the US system is the idea of a “Full Slate”; That is running a candidate in every possible seat. US congressional elections can pass with some members being elected without opposition, whereas in Canada, parties will normally try to field a full slate of Candidates.

<text>Anita Louise Lane (18 March 1960 – 27 April 2021) was an Australian singer-songwriter who was briefly a member of the Bad Seeds with Nick Cave and Mick Harvey and collaborated with both bandmates. Lane released two solo albums, &quot;Dirty Pearl&quot; (1993) and &quot;Sex O&#x27;Clock&quot; (2001).

== Early life ==
Anita Louise Lane was born in Melbourne in 1960. She began singing and writing songs at the age of 16. She was a classmate of Rowland S. Howard while both were students at the Prahran College of Advanced Education, undertaking the Tertiary Orientation Programme.

==Music career==
===1979–1983 : The Birthday Party ===

Lane met Nick Cave in 1977 and the pair began an intermittent personal relationship. Cave, on lead vocals, was a member of a new wave group the Boys Next Door with Mick Harvey on guitar, Phill Calvert on drums and Tracy Pew on bass guitar. By December 1978, Rowland S. Howard had joined the line up on lead guitar. In February 1980, the Boys Next Door were renamed as the Birthday Party and Lane and Cave moved to London with the group.

Lane and Cave co-wrote the lyrics for &quot;A Dead Song&quot;, which appeared on their debut album &quot;Prayers on Fire&quot; which was released in April 1981. AllMusic&#x27;s Greg Maurer praised the album and noted Lane&#x27;s song writing contribution. George Sarostin of Only Solitaire felt that, on this track, Cave &quot;sounds, with all of his whiny &#x27;okay okay&#x27;, just like one of those poor innocent or half-innocent victims with a bloody nose and a gun at their temple in a gangster movie&quot;.

For their second album, &quot;Junkyard&quot;, which was released in May 1982, Lane and Cave co-wrote &quot;Dead Joe&quot; and &quot;Kiss Me Black&quot;. Session and touring musician Barry Adamson provided bass guitar on &quot;Kiss Me Black&quot;. The group relocated to West Berlin in August 1982 prior to their cessation in June of the following year.

===1984–2001: Collaborations and solo career===
Lane was briefly a member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds playing piano, along with singing backing and occasional lead vocals. She was a member alongside Cave, Harvey, Adamson, Blixa Bargeld and Hugo Race. She supplied lyrics for &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot;, the title track of their debut album (June 1984). She left the group soon after.

Lane co-wrote &quot;Stranger Than Kindness&quot; with Bargeld, which appears on Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds&#x27; fourth album, &quot;Your Funeral... My Trial&quot; which was released in November 1986. Chris Long of BBC Music reviewed the album in May 2009 and found that &quot;Stranger Than Kindness&quot; was a &quot;twisted love song. At once both beautiful and startling, it is a song that sounds like a held breath, never letting slip the power that swells within it&quot;.

Lane added her lead vocals over a musical score by Bargeld, Cave and Harvey for the soundtrack of the 1988 Australian film &quot;Ghosts... of the Civil Dead&quot;, including the track &quot;A Prison in the Desert&quot;. Jon Behm of Reviler.org praised her &quot;ethereal howling/whispering vocals, which due to her babydoll voice sound a bit like the ravings of a mentally disturbed child. It&#x27;s a pretty intriguing tune for any fan of moody, somewhat frightening music&quot;.

Lane had a &quot;sporadic solo career&quot; beginning with her four-track extended play &quot;Dirty Sings&quot; in 1988 on Mute Records. For the recording, she was joined by Adamson, Cave, Harvey and Thomas Wydler on drums (of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, ex-Die Haut); while Harvey produced the EP.

She also provided guest vocals on &quot;The Bells Belong to the Ashes&quot; for the album &quot;Headless Body in Topless Bar&quot; in 1988 by German post-punk post-rock band Die Haut.

In 1989, Lane was featured on Adamson&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Moss Side Story&quot;; with Harvey, she was part of the Freedom Choir on &quot;Suck on the Honey of Love&quot; and &quot;Free at Last&quot;. She supplied vocals again for his second solo effort, the soundtrack for the film &quot;Delusion&quot; (1991).

In 1992, she performed a duet with Kid Congo Powers on Die Haut&#x27;s track &quot;Excited&quot; and another with Bargeld on &quot;How Long (Have We Known Each Other Now)&quot; for the German group&#x27;s album &quot;Head On&quot;. Lane and Bargeld duetted again on &quot;Blume&quot; for his group, Einstürzende Neubauten&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; (1993). The track is co-written by Lane, Bargeld and his group members.

In 1993, Lane issued her debut solo studio album &quot;Dirty Pearl&quot;, recorded from 1982 to that year. It consists of her work with The Birthday Party, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Einstürzende Neubauten and Die Haut, as well as exclusive album tracks. The album was co-produced by Bargeld, Cave, Harvey, Johannes Beck, John Cafferty, Die Haut, Einstürzende Neubaten, Sven Röhrig, and The Birthday Party. An expanded CD version includes all four &quot;Dirty Sings&quot; tracks. Ned Raggett of AllMusic noted that &quot;Dirty Pearl&quot; was a &quot;collection organized in reverse chronological order&quot;, which was &quot;a bit fragmented as a result [it] still makes for an involving listen, demonstrating clearly that her work is worth taking on its own terms instead of simply being a Cave footnote&quot;. He praised her singing &quot;a good if at points girlish voice, albeit one that she&#x27;s shown more control over with time ... she has a taste for smoky sonic settings for her vocals, sometimes low-key and sly, other times frenetic even as she keeps her cool&quot;. Consumable Online&#x27;s Reto Koradi felt the music &quot;glooms in the dark, slow and almost hypnotic. The lyrics paint pictures of dreams, love, sex, religion and death&quot;. Most of the original tracks were co-written by Lane with Harvey. The album provided Lane&#x27;s single &quot;The World&#x27;s a Girl&quot;, which appeared on 5 June 1995. Koradi declared that it was &quot;an obvious choice as a single, it&#x27;s the most radio-friendly track&quot;. The lead track was co-written with Harvey. The two B-sides were duets with Cave for cover versions of &quot;Bedazzled&quot; – originally by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore for their 1967 film of the same name; and &quot;I Love You... Nor Do I&quot; – originally by Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot in French as &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus&quot; (recorded in 1967).

In 1995, Lane contributed vocals to Harvey&#x27;s Serge Gainsbourg tribute album &quot;Intoxicated Man&quot;. She returned in 1997 for his second Gainsbourg-inspired album &quot;Pink Elephants&quot;. Over the two albums, Harvey had Lane &quot;singing the female parts originally performed by the likes of Jane Birkin, Brigitte Bardot and Anna Karina&quot;.

For &quot;Murder Ballads&quot;, released in February 1996, the ninth studio album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Lane sang a verse of their cover version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Death Is Not the End&quot; and vocals for &quot;The Kindness of Strangers&quot;.

Lane&#x27;s second solo studio album &quot;Sex O&#x27; Clock&quot; was released on 23 October 2001, produced by Harvey. AllMusic&#x27;s Stewart Mason found it &quot;mixes sleek, creamy, and often danceable R&amp;B-tinged pop tunes with the sort of lyrical plain-spokenness implied by the title&quot;. He could not decide whether her delivery which is &quot;so deadpan that it&#x27;s hard to tell if the sexually-obsessed (and to be honest, rather trite) lyrics ... are meant as parodies of Tori Amos and/or Alanis Morissette, or if Lane takes ... [her lines] seriously&quot;.

&quot;Sex O&#x27;Clock&quot; includes a cover version of Gil Scott-Heron&#x27;s song &quot;Home Is Where the Hatred Is&quot;, which Mason lists as one of its &quot;best tracks&quot;. Another of Mason&#x27;s favourites is &quot;I Hate Myself&quot;, co-written by Doc Pomus and Ken Hirsch. Lane and Adamson duet on a cover version of Lee Hazlewood&#x27;s &quot;These Boots Were Made for Walking&quot;. In May 2008, Guy Blackman of &quot;The Age&quot; felt the album was under-appreciated, it was &quot;a classic of suggestive orchestral pop. It should have set the world alight, but didn&#x27;t&quot;.

Anita Lane&#x27;s vocals, sourced from a telephone recording, are sampled by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in the 2024 Wild God track &quot;O Wow O Wow (How Wonderful She Is)&quot;.

== Cover versions ==
Digital hardcore band Lolita Storm covered &quot;Stranger Than Kindness&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Eyes for an Eye: A Tribute to Nick Cave&quot; in 1996. Swedish singer Karin Dreijer (under their pseudonym, Fever Ray) also covered it in November 2009, which was accompanied by a music video. It was issued as a single in support of Dreijer&#x27;s self-titled debut album. &quot;A Dead Song&quot; was performed by US artists, Get Hustle, for a tribute album, &quot;Release the Bats – The Birthday Party as Heard Through the Grinder of Three One G&quot; (2006). Australian singer-songwriter Tim Rogers tackled &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot; on &quot;Straight to You – Triple J&#x27;s Tribute to Nick Cave&quot; in February 2012.

== Personal life ==
From 1977, Lane and Nick Cave had a personal and professional relationship; they separated as a couple in 1983 but intermittently worked together professionally into the 1990s. In 1984, Lane formed a personal relationship with Australian journalist and writer Nicolas Rothwell. They lived together for a short time in New York where Rothwell was then working. In the mid-1980s, she lived back in Sydney, Australia, in a relationship with Andrew Foote before returning to Berlin, where she had spent some time with Cave in the early 1980s, and resumed her relationship with Cave. It would, however, be short lived.

After the relationship with Cave ended, Lane stayed on in Berlin. By the early 1990s, she had married German man Johannes Beck, with whom she had her first child in 1990. After the breakdown of the marriage, she lived in Essaouira, Morocco in 1994/95 where she commenced a relationship with Sicilian man Andrea Libonati. This resulted in two more sons. In 2003, Lane moved back to Australia with Libonati and her children and took up residence in Byron Bay, before moving back to Melbourne in 2008 with her children to her original family home in the suburb of Glen Iris. From early 2020, Lane had moved by herself into a house in Melbourne&#x27;s inner suburb of Collingwood where she lived until her death.

On 27 April 2021, Lane died at age 61. No cause of death was given. She was less active in her career in the final years of her life primarily due to health issues.

<text>A wire chamber or multi-wire proportional chamber is a type of proportional counter that detects charged particles and photons and can give positional information on their trajectory, by tracking the trails of gaseous ionization.
The technique was an improvement over the bubble chamber particle detection method, which used photographic techniques, as it allowed high speed electronics to track the particle path.

==Description==
The multi-wire chamber uses an array of wires at a positive dc voltage (anode)s, which run through a chamber with conductive walls held at a lower potential (cathode). The chamber is filled with gas, such as an argon/methane mix, so that any ionizing particle that passes through the tube will ionize surrounding gaseous atoms and produce ion pairs, consisting of positive ions and electrons. These are accelerated by the electric field across the chamber, preventing recombination; the electrons are accelerated to the anode, and the positive ions to the cathode. At the anode a phenomenon known as a Townsend avalanche occurs. This results in a measurable current flow for each original ionising event which is proportional to the ionisation energy deposited by the detected particle. By separately measuring the current pulses from each wire, the particle trajectory can be found.
Adaptations of this basic design are the &quot;thin gap, resistive plate&quot; and &quot;drift&quot; chambers. The drift chamber can also be subdivided into ranges of specific use in the chamber designs known as time projection, microstrip gas, and those types of detectors that use silicon.

==Development==
In 1968, Georges Charpak, while at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), invented and developed the multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC). This invention resulted in him winning the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1992. The chamber was an advancement of the earlier bubble chamber rate of detection of only one or two particles every second to 1000 particle detections every second. The MWPC produced electronic signals from particle detection, allowing scientists to examine data via computers. The multi-wire chamber is a development of the spark chamber.

==Fill gases==
In a typical experiment, the chamber contains a mixture of these gases:

* argon (about )
* isobutane (just under )
* freon (0.5%)

The chamber could also be filled with:

* liquid xenon;
* liquid tetramethylsilane; or
* tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene (TMAE) vapour.

==Use==
For high-energy physics experiments, it is used to observe a particle&#x27;s path. For a long time, bubble chambers were used for this purpose, but with the improvement of electronics, it became desirable to have a detector with fast electronic read-out. (In bubble chambers, photographic exposures were made and the resulting printed photographs were then examined.) A wire chamber is a chamber with many parallel wires, arranged as a grid and put on high voltage, with the metal casing being on ground potential. As in the Geiger counter, a particle leaves a trace of ions and electrons, which drift toward the case or the &quot;nearest&quot; wire, respectively. By marking off the wires which had a pulse of current, one can see the particle&#x27;s path.

The chamber has a very good relative time resolution, good positional accuracy, and &quot;self-triggered&quot; operation (Ferbel 1977).

The development of the chamber enabled scientists to study the trajectories of particles with much-improved precision, and also for the first time to observe and study the rarer interactions that occur through particle interaction.

==Drift chambers==
If one also precisely measures the timing of the current pulses of the wires and takes into account that the ions need some time to drift to the nearest wire, one can infer the distance at which the particle passed the wire. This greatly increases the accuracy of the path reconstruction and is known as a drift chamber.

A drift chamber functions by balancing the loss of energy from particles caused by impacts with particles of gas with the accretion of energy created with high-energy electrical fields in use to cause the particle acceleration. Design is similar to the multi-wire proportional chamber but with a greater distance between central-layer wires. The detection of charged particles within the chamber is possible by the ionizing of gas particles due to the motion of the charged particle.

The Fermilab detector CDF II contains a drift chamber called the Central Outer Tracker. The chamber contains argon and ethane gas, and wires separated by 3.56-millimetre gaps.

If two drift chambers are used with the wires of one orthogonal to the wires of the other, both orthogonal to the beam direction, a more precise detection of the position is obtained. If an additional simple detector (like the one used in a veto counter) is used to detect, with poor or null positional resolution, the particle at a fixed distance before or after the wires, a tri-dimensional reconstruction can be made and the speed of the particle deduced from the difference in time of the passage of the particle in the different parts of the detector. This setup gives us a detector called a time projection chamber (TPC).

For measuring the velocity of the electrons in a gas (drift velocity) there are special drift chambers, velocity drift chambers, which measure the drift time for a known location of ionisation.

<text>Chan Wah-shun ( 1836 – 1913), nicknamed Money Changer Wah (找錢華) and Money Clutcher Wah (爪錢華), was a student of the Wing Chun grandmaster Leung Jan (梁贊). He is noted for being the martial arts teacher of Ip Man.

==Background==
Born in Shunde District, Foshan in 1836, Chan ran a currency exchange stall near Dit Da and Wing Chun practitioner Leung Jan&#x27;s herbal medicine clinic in Foshan. He carried heavy loads of coins every day, and so developed great strength over the years. In 1884, his son Chan Yu-gum (陳汝錦) was born.

In 1888, Leung Jan&#x27;s physical health had begun to decline and his sons, including Leung Bik (梁壁 Liáng Bì; loeng4 bik1) and Leung Chun (梁春 loeng4 cheun1), had left Foshan to make a living. They had no intention of taking over his training hall, named Wing Sang Tong (榮生堂), also known as Jan Sang Tong (贊生堂), which was looked after by his student Lee Wah (李華), nicknamed Woodman Wah (木人華).

While searching for a successor, Leung took in Chan as his student. Leung would later often return to his hometown Gulao Village (古勞), and Chan continued to be trained by Lee. Chan also learned traditional Chinese medicine Dit Da from Leung. Chan eventually closed his money changing business and helped ran a Dit Da clinic.

Upon the death of Lee in the following year in 1889, Chan took over the operations of the training hall, while Leung went back and forth between Foshan and Gulao. Wing Sang Tong was later renamed to Hang Chai Tong (杏濟堂).

Chan started training his young son in Wing Chun in 1892. Chan assisted Leung for only four years.

With the death of Leung Jan in 1901, Chan left Hang Chai Tong and worked at a ceramic shop at Lianhua Street.

In 1906, he rented a huge ancestral hall at Yejia Village, Chancheng District at Foshan for teaching Wing Chun, which was where he accepted his 16th and last student, Ip Man. Chan was only able to teach the students for three years when in 1909, he suffered a mild stroke. Chan asked his second student, Ng Chung-sok (吳仲素), to take over the hall and continue with students&#x27; trainings before retiring back to his village at Shunde. Chan died of illness in 1913 and was buried there.

<text>Silje Nergaard (born 19 June 1966) is a Norwegian jazz vocalist and songwriter. She is one of the best-selling jazz artists on the official sales chart in Norway. She became known worldwide after the release of the international bestseller &quot;Tell Me Where You&#x27;re Going&quot; featuring Pat Metheny on guitar.

==Career==
Nergaard entered the music scene at the age of 16 when she accidentally had a jam session with Jaco Pastorius Band in 1982. Her first hit single in 1990, &quot;Tell Me Where You&#x27;re Going&quot; featuring guitarist Pat Metheny made it to no. 1 in Japan as well as top 10 in Norway and other countries. Her album &quot;At First Light&quot; (2001) is the best-selling Norwegian jazz album ever recorded and entered the official sales chart in Norway at No. 1 in its first week. The album &quot;A Thousand True Stories&quot;, which Nergaard recorded with the Metropole Orchestra in 2008, was a great success in both Europe and Asia. Nergaard is one of the few Norwegian artists to have been commercially released all around the globe, on most continents and major music markets including Japan, Brazil, Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

Nergaard has recorded and performed songs with Al Jarreau, Pat Metheny, Toots Thielemanns, and Morten Harket of A-ha. She has had Tord Gustavsen and Jarle Vespestad as two pillars in her bands. Vince Mendoza received a Grammy Award Nomination for the Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) Award for the song &quot;A Thousand True Stories&quot; in 2011.

In the spring of 2012, Nergaard released her new album &quot;Unclouded&quot;, based on recordings with her two guitarists Hallgrim Bratberg and Håvar Bendiksen. It was released on 9 March in Norway and 23 March internationally. Nergaard has written 9 new songs for &quot;Unclouded&quot; and has two covers on this album: &quot;Human&quot; by The Killers and &quot;The Moon&#x27;s a Harsh Mistress&quot; by Jimmy Webb. For &quot;Unclouded,&quot; Nergaard has also invited the American guitarist John Scofield to contribute along with Georg Wadenius, Knut Reiersrud, and Nils Petter Molvær.

==Personal life==
She is married to the singer Heine Totland. They have two daughters and one son together.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Jablonec&quot; is of Czech origin and means &#x27;little apple tree&#x27; (&quot;jablonče&quot; was a diminutive of the old Czech &quot;jabloň&quot; – &#x27;apple tree&#x27;), for the village was founded on a place where an apple tree grew. German-speaking settlers who came to the village during the 16th century adjusted the name to &quot;Gablonz&quot;. During the 19th century, the attribute &quot;German&quot; was often added to the name (like in the 1848 , German: &quot;Deutsch-Gablonz&quot;). In 1904, the official attribute in both Czech and German became &#x27;on the Neisse&#x27;, which described the location of the city upon the Lusatian Neisse River.

==Geography==

Jablonec nad Nisou is located about southeast of Liberec and northeast of Prague. Most of the built-up area lies in the eastern tip of the Zittau Basin, and it is surrounded with the Jizera Mountains in the north, east and south. The northern part of the municipal territory also belongs into the Jizera Mountains Protected Landscape Area. The highest point of Jablonec nad Nisou is located on the slopes in the southeastern part of the territory, with an altitude of .

Jablonec nad Nisou is situated at the confluence of the rivers Lusatian Neisse and Bílá Nisa. The Mohelka River originates in Jablonec nad Nisou-Kokonín. The Mšeno Reservoir in the city belongs to the largest inner city areas in Europe. It was built in 1906–1909 and has an area of around .

==History==

The first written mention of Jablonec was in a Latin document from 1356 as &quot;Jablonecz&quot;. According to this document, Jablonec was founded in the 14th century. In August 1469, the village was burned to the ground by troops of rebelling Lusatians in the war between them and King George of Poděbrady. The village was then resettled in the 1530s and 1540s by mostly German-speaking colonists.

In the first half of the 17th century, Jablonec was owned by Albrecht von Wallenstein, who sold it to the Desfours family. In 1643, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Jablonec was burned down for the second time. Glass production began to flourish in the second half of the 17th century and Jablonec began to develop rapidly. In the 18th century, the first bijou was produced and the first exporter, J. F. Schwann, spread the villages&#x27;s name throughout Europe. Jablonec was promoted to a market town by Emperor Francis II on 21 April 1808.

Further development followed the construction of the road in the 1840s. Jablonec was then promoted to a town by Emperor Franz Joseph I on 28 March 1866. Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871 damaged competitors in the production of glass and jewelry, and the Jablonec traders seized the foreign markets. A steady supply of a wide range of glass and artificial jewellery products flowed out of the town. This industrial advancement also improved the quality of life, and Jablonec&#x27;s appearance changed dramatically.

Historian Peter Hinks, writing about the various types of Late Victorian jewellery sold by British and American companies at the turn of the 20th century, noted that &quot;The Bohemian garnet jewellery sold by Moore and Evans [in Chicago] was the product of an industry based in the town of Gablonz, now Jablonec. These very effective jewels were set with locally mined garnets, rose cut and set in gold mounts of very formal design.&quot;

However, the worldwide economic crisis resulting from the Wall Street crash of 1929 damaged the glass and jewellery industry and the crisis of the 1930s. Changing trends and the growth of foreign competition also hurt the local industry. In October 1938, Jablonec was annexed to Nazi Germany after the Munich Agreement, and was administered as a part of Reichsgau Sudetenland until 1945.

Between 1945 and 1949, most of the Germans were expelled under the terms of Beneš decrees. After the war, the expelled German-speaking citizens of Jablonec founded a new settlement in Bavaria and called in remembrance of their hometown &quot;Neugablonz&quot; (&quot;New Jablonec&quot;). Today, it is one of the districts of the city of Kaufbeuren.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Jablonec nad Nisou holds the Czech Mint after Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia (the Czechoslovak mint, also known as the Kremnica Mint, is now in Slovakia).

The city has a long tradition of costume jewelry and beads production.

The biggest industrial employers with headquarters in the city are Preciosa (glass products manufacturer) are TI Automotive AC (production of car air conditioners).

The Liberec-Jablonec agglomeration was defined as a tool for drawing money from the European Structural and Investment Funds. It is an area that includes the cities of Liberec and Jablonec nad Nisou and their surroundings, linked to the cities by commuting and migration. It has about 227,000 inhabitants.

==Transport==
Jablonec nad Nisou shares the tramway line which connects it to its neighbouring city of Liberec.

The city is located on the railway line from Liberec to Szklarska Poręba. The territory is served by four stations and stops.

==Sport==
Jablonec has a swimming pool, three football and athletic stadiums, and an ice hockey arena.

The city is represented by FK Jablonec in the Czech First League. The club has been a stable member of the league since 1994.

Before the World War II, a number of ethnic German football clubs existed in Gablonz, &quot;Fortuna&quot;, &quot;DSK&quot; and &quot;BSK&quot;. These were merged into &quot;NSTG Gablonz&quot; in 1939 by the Nazis, &quot;NSTG&quot; standing for &quot;Nationalsozialistische Turngemeinde&quot;. &quot;NSTG&quot; played in the Gauliga Sudetenland but disappeared with the end of the war. &quot;BSK&quot; however was reformed in 1950 in Bavaria, under the name of BSK Neugablonz.

==Sights==

The historical city centre is formed by squares Dolní, Mírové, Horní, and Anenské, which lies close to each other, and their surroundings. The Old Town Hall with a typical square tower was built on Dolní Square in 1867–1869. Today it serves as a library.

The current city hall is called New Town Hall and is located on Mírové Square. It is a functionalistic building, built in 1930–1933. It is an excellent example of interwar modern architecture. For its value, it has been protected as a national cultural monument since 2024.

There are several churches in the city: Church of Saint Anne (built in the Baroque style in 1865–1867), Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus (a brick building, built 1930–1931), Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (built in the Art Nouveau style in 1900–1902; one of the most important sacral Art Nouveau buildings in Europe), and Protestant Dr. Farský Church (a pseudo-Gothic building from 1892).

The tradition of costume jewellery production is presented in the Museum of Glass and Costume Jewellery. It was founded in 1904 and it is located in an Art Nouveau building.

<text>Distributed Processing Programming Executive is a discontinued operating system introduced by IBM, pre-installed on the IBM 8100 and later ported to the ES/9370.

==Brief history==
* It was first introduced on the IBM 8100 series, which was released in 1978.
* 1987 saw the release of Distributed Processing Programming Executive System Product (DPPX/SP) Release 4.
* In 1986, IBM decided to cease the IBM 8100 architecture to consolidate its hardware and software families.
* In 1988, they released DPPX/370 which ran on the ES/9370 processors (an S/370 model).
* By the end of June 1997, DPPX/370 was officially retired.

==Architecture==

DPPX was written in Programming Language for Distributed Systems (PL/DS), a PL/I-derived systems programming language, similar to the PL/S systems programming language used for MVS and VM. Part of the DPPX/370 development process was developing a PL/DS 2 language, which was based on PL/DS, but with changes necessitated by the changed instruction set. (PL/DS, like PL/S, is a high-level language which encourages significant use of inline assembly.)

The user interfaces (e.g., command line) of DPPX were very clean and easy to use, the syntax of the commands, the whole concept and ideas of DPPX looked very straightforward and consistent (command line, online help, etc.), and each and every aspect was documented online and in a rich set of well organized printed manuals. A DPPX system could be operated truly operator-less and remote (hence the &quot;Distributed&quot; part of the name). One benefit of this clean design was that programs could be written in modern dialects of COBOL, and dialogs could be developed interactively.

DPPX had a native DBMS with simple key-lookup architecture, and ability to move forward through a table after starting from a specific key value by issuing a read-forward command. A limitation of the DPPX DBMS was the lack of read-previous capability, which made it difficult, for example, to code page-back functionality for a screen loaded from a DPPX DBMS table. This limitation was mitigated by an enterprising young programmer (K. Riley of Anchorage, Alaska) who suggested at the application layer creating alternate keys for the DPPX tables that needed read-previous functionality. The alternate keys could then be loaded with the binary 1&#x27;s complement of the primary key, at which point reading forward on the alternate key was equivalent to reading previous on the primary key.
==Software==

In addition to the expected functions of an operating system, DPPX included several functions which allowed for remote administration, such as Distributed Host Command Facility (DHCF), which allowed a Host Command Facility (HCF) user on a mainframe to log on in either full-screen mode or line mode to execute commands as though logged on locally, and Distributed Systems Network (or Node) Executive (DSNX), which allowed a Distributed Systems Executive (DSX) (later NetView/DM) job to manage files.

Separate additional products were also available, including COBOL and Fortran compilers, the Distributed Transaction Management System (DTMS), Command Facilities Extensions (CFE), which provided easy support for full-screen applications, Data Stream Capability (DSC) to allow DPPX users to log on to applications on the mainframe, and Performance Tool (PT).

<text>Walther Müller (6 September 1905, in Hanover – 4 December 1979, in Walnut Creek, California) was a German physicist, most well known for his improvement of Hans Geiger&#x27;s counter for ionizing radiation, now known as the Geiger-Müller tube.

Walther Müller studied physics, chemistry and philosophy at the University of Kiel. In 1925 he became the first PhD student of Hans Geiger, who had just got a professorship in Kiel. Their work on ionization of gases by collision lead to the invention of the Geiger-Müller counter, a now indispensable tool for measuring radioactive radiation.

After some time as professor at the University of Tübingen he worked for the rest of his professional life as industrial physicist (i. e. a physicist working in industrial R&amp;D) in Germany, then as an advisor for the Australian Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department Research Laboratories in Melbourne, and then as an industrial physicist in the United States, where he also founded a company to manufacture Geiger–Müller tubes.

<text>Coolangatta is a coastal suburb in the City of Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. It is the Gold Coast&#x27;s southernmost suburb and it borders New South Wales. In the , Coolangatta had a population of 6,491 people.

== History ==
Coolangatta is situated in the Bundjalung traditional Aboriginal country. The Yugambeh people are local custodians in the Bundjalung traditional Aboriginal country. Yugambeh language (also known as Yugumbir, Jugambel, Jugambeir, Jugumbir, Jukam, Jukamba) is one of the Australian Aboriginal languages in areas that include the Beenleigh, Beaudesert, Gold Coast, Logan, Scenic Rim, Albert River, Coolangatta, Coomera, Logan River, Pimpama, Tamborine and Tweed River Valley, within the local government boundaries of the City of Gold Coast, City of Logan, Scenic Rim Regional Council and the Tweed River Valley.

=== Early settlement ===

Coolangatta was one of the earliest settlements on the Gold Coast. Once again focused on a steep headland at Point Danger the area was occupied by Europeans from at least 1828 by a convict station and red cedar getters soon followed.

=== Wreck of the &quot;Coolangatta&quot; ===
On 18 August 1846, the schooner &quot;Coolangatta&quot; was wrecked on Kirra / Bilinga Beach adjacent to a creek during a storm.
A topsail schooner of in length and , &quot;Coolangatta&quot; was built by John Blinksell in 1843 for Alexander Berry whose property, Coolangatta Estate, adjoined Coolangatta mountain located on the northern bank of the Shoalhaven River, New South Wales.

On 6 July 1846, the ship sailed under Captain Steele from Brisbane, carrying two convict prisoners (George Craig in irons, and William George Lewis), to load red cedar logs at the Tweed River for Sydney. Steele found the river entrance closed by silt forming a bar, so he anchored in the lee of Point Danger off Kirra Beach. Red cedar logs were then hauled overland from Terranora Inlet and rafted from the beach, but in six weeks less than half of the contracted 70,000 feet of red cedar had been loaded. Meanwhile, five ships loaded with red cedar were bar-bound inside the river.

On 18 August 1846, while Steel was ashore, a south-east gale blew up. Steele&#x27;s boat was damaged while getting through the surf and he watched from the beach as the gale intensified. Eventually, the prisoners were freed and all hands abandoned ship and swam for shore as the anchors dragged. The ship parted its anchors and washed ashore near what was later called Coolangatta Creek.

The survivors walked north to Amity Point in six days, fed each night by different groups of friendly indigenous Australians, and were taken into Brisbane on board the &quot;Tamar&quot;.

=== Township develops ===
Selectors followed in the 1860s and a small settlement was established.

In 1883 a township was surveyed. A map of the town in 1885 shows the results of a recent land sale where several town lots were sold. Government surveyor Henry Schneider named the area Coolangatta after the shipwreck while surveying in 1883 for the land auction in March 1884.

As a border town Coolangatta included a customs office, boatshed and government wharf.

=== Twentieth century ===

The South Coast railway was extended from Nerang railway station to Tweed Heads in New South Wales and opened on 10 August 1903. Coolangatta railway station was located to the south of the intersection of Griffith and Dutton Streets (). The terminus Tweed Heads railway station was in Tweed Heads near Thomson Street (). The railway guaranteed the success of Coolangatta as a holiday township and it flourished from that time forward.

The Tweed Heads Surf and Life Saving Club was established on Friday 26 January 1909. Tweed Heads and Coolangatta Surf Life Saving Club building opened on 13 September 1911. Guesthouses and hotels were erected and a commercial centre soon followed.

Land was advertised for sale in December 1912, being allotments in sections 3, 14, 25, [16 &amp; 17], town of Coolangatta and portion 44 (special lease) parish of Tallebudgera, with 7 allotments facing either Marine Parade or Griffith Street. A further 35 allotments immediately south of Coolangatta railway station and 2 further allotments facing McLean Street were also advertised for sale.

Prior to 1914, Coolangatta was administered by the Nerang Divisional Board, which became the Shire of Nerang in 1903. In 1914, Coolangatta had its own local government, the Town of Coolangatta, but in 1949 it was amalgamated into the Town of South Coast, which later became City of Gold Coast.

The &quot;Coolangatta Star&quot; newspaper was published from 1916 to 1927. In May 1927, the Tweed Heads and Coolangatta star amalgamated with the &quot;Coolangatta Chronicle&quot; to become the &quot;Border Star&quot;. The &quot;Border Star&quot; newspaper ceased publication in 1942.

In January 1919, the border between Queensland and New South Wales was closed to all traffic in response to the 1918 flu pandemic in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease north into Queensland. People found themselves stranded on the one side of the border unable to return to their homes or employment on the other side. Quarantine stations and camps were established to house travelers and stranded residents. One impact on the border closure was the need to duplicate services across the twin towns on the Queensland side of the border, as at 1 February 1919, Coolangatta had no doctor, no pharmacist, no milkman, no butcher and no undertaker. Nor did Coolangatta have a school nor a post office. The border remained closed until May 1919.

One of the services that required duplication was a school for 56 children living in Coolangatta but attending school in Tweed Heads. Previously on 28 June 1918 the Queensland Department of Public Instruction had indicated their intention to establish a school at Coolangatta but no progress had been made. When the Coolangatta children were unable to return to their Tweed Heads school in February 1919, the Coolangatta Town Council made a meeting room available in their council chambers for use as a temporary school room and the Queensland Department of Public Instruction sent school furniture and one teacher from Brisbane, and Coolangatta Provisional School commenced operation on 10 February 1919. The next task was to construct a school building with two classrooms on the school reserve at 1 Garrick Street (corner of Powell Street, ) on Kirra Hill. Although expected to be completed in six months, it was not until the start of the 1920 school year that the new Coolangatta State School opened with 67 students under headmaster Claude de Jersey and another teacher. It was officially opened on 2 October 1920 by Queensland Governor Matthew Nathan. Growth in the school over the decades subsequently led to its relocation to Stapylton Street, officially opening there on 26 November 1977. The old school bell from Kirra Hill was relocated to the Stapylton Street where it remains in daily use.

There was a stump-capping ceremony held for the Coolangatta Methodist Memorial Church on Sunday 8 June 1924. The church was officially opened at 26-28 Lanham Street () on Sunday 27 September 1924 by Reverend Dr George Edward Rowe. Following the Methodist Church amalgamating into the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977, the church became Coolangatta Uniting Church. In June 1988 the Uniting Church in Coolangatta and Tweed Heads merged to form the Twin Towns Uniting Church. In 1992 the growing population in Banora Point in New South Wales resulted in the decision to open a Uniting Church there and in the late 1990s, that church became a parish in its own right with the Twin Towns parish now serving only Coolangatta.

On Monday 31 April 1925 Archbishop James Duhig laid the foundation stone of St Augustine&#x27;s Catholic Church. On Sunday 19 December 1926 Duhig returned to officially open and bless the church. The church was built in a commanding position overlooking the Pacific Ocean in the Italian Romanesque style. The tower is high.

St Augustine&#x27;s Catholic School was established in 1926 by the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart. From 1950 the school was operated by Missionary Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception. On 27 January 1987 the school relocated to a new site in Currumbin Waters. In 1992 the sisters ended their association with the school which is now under lay administration.

The foundation stone of St Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church at 34 Lanham Street (corner of Dutton Street, ) was laid on 31 October 1937 by Archbishop William Wand. It was dedicated in 1938 by Wand. Its closure circa 2013 was approved by Archbishop Philip Aspinall.

An unnamed cyclone crossed the coast at Coolangatta on the night of 20 February 1954. The storm quickly cleared from Queensland skies but moved south, causing widespread loss of life and flooding in New South Wales.

The railway line closed in 1961 due to the rising use of cars.

Little remains of the earliest structures at Coolangatta but some evidence remains of subsequent development in the early years of the twentieth century including the Coolangatta Hotel, Kirra Beach Hotel and St Augustine&#x27;s Catholic Church (Coolangatta). In addition to the former Coolangatta State School, the Anzac Memorial (Coolangatta), Jazzland Coolangatta, the Kirra Beach Pavilion, Kirra Beach Shelter Shed and the remains of Jack Evans Porpoise Pool are on the Gold Coast Local Heritage Register.

The border fence and gates that until recently were a characteristic of the area have now been removed but the sense of the border remains at Boundary Street running along the ridge of the headland between Queensland and New South Wales. The headland itself is an important landmark and tourist destination and is the site of the Point Danger Lighthouse. Coolangatta symbolises the terminus of the Gold Coast and the long strip of beach that begins at Main Beach forty kilometres to the north.

Coolangatta and its surrounds were the home of two early tourist attractions on the Gold Coast. Jack Evans Porpoise Pool which was built at Snapper Rocks in 1957 and Gilltraps Auto Museum which was established at Kirra in 1959.

Coolangatta Special School opened on 1 January 1979 on the Kirra Hill site vacated by the Coolangatta State School. On 1 July 2006 the school was relocated to Currumbin Waters and renamed Currumbin Community Special School. Following local agitation from the &quot;Save Kirra Hill&quot; group, the school buildings at the Kirra Hill site were transferred to the Gold Coast City Council in 2008 for community purposes. The Council spent $3 million in restoration and refurbishment before officially opening the site as the Kirra Hill Cultural and Community Centre in October 2011. The Kirra Hill site is listed on the Gold Coast Local Heritage Register.

To commemorate the centenary of Coolangatta, in 1984 a stone from the Coolangatta Estate homestead was donated by the citizens of Coolangatta near Berry, New South Wales and was mounted on a plinth of granite from Aberdeen, Scotland, the birthplace of Alexander Berry.

=== Twenty-first century ===
The Coolangatta library opened in 2013.
During 2020 and 2021, the Queensland borders were closed to most types of traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Border crossing points were either closed or had a Queensland Police checkpoint to allow entry to those with an appropriate permit. Griffith Street at Coolangatta was one of the police checkpoints, while other crossing points were closed.

== Geography ==
Coolangatta and its immediate neighbouring &quot;Twin Town&quot; Tweed Heads in New South Wales have a shared economy. The Tweed River supports a thriving fishing fleet, and the seafood is a local specialty offered in the restaurants and clubs of the holiday and retirement region on both sides of the state border.

There are three hills in Coolangatta:

* Kirra Hill ( ) at above sea level on the coast, which was named in 1883 by surveyor Schneider (1883) using an Aboriginal word which might mean &quot;white cockatoo&quot; or &quot;fire&quot;
* Greenmount Hill ( ) at above sea level on the coast, which was named for the Greenmount Guest House, operated from 1905 by Patrick J. Fagan, and named after his birthplace in County Meath, Ireland
* Murraba ( ) at above sea level on the border with New South Wales

Point Danger is a headland on the Queensland/New South Wales border (). It was widely believed to be named by Lieutenant James Cook on his 1770 exploration of the eastern Australia coastline in HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot;, but this is only partially correct. Cook did create the name, but he applied it to another headland further south (now known as Fingal Head). This was confirmed in the 1823 map produced by explorer John Oxley. However a map published in 1831 based on the 1828 survey conducted on HMS Rainbow applied the name Point Danger to the headland north of the Tweed River. So while Cook created the name, he did not assign it to the current location.

Rainbow Bay is offshore from the south-east of the suburb (). It was originally called Shark/Sharks Bay until 1926 when the Coolangatta Town Council decided to rename it after HMS Rainbow, a sixth-rate frigate, commanded by Captain Henry John Rous, used in surveys of the area in 1828.

There are three neighbourhoods within Coolangatta:

* Kirra () which takes its name from Kirra Hill
* Greenmount ( ) named after the guest house

Funded by 39 businesses, it is believed to be the first jingle written to promote an Australian tourist destination. In 2008 the song was used as the theme for a Gold Coast Heritage exhibition about the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s on the Gold Coast, featuring oral histories and objects of Gold Coast residents.

<doc id="1041279" wikidata="Q2623363" url="?curid=1041279" title="ANSI art">
<text>ANSI art is a computer art form that was widely used at one time on bulletin board systems. It is similar to ASCII art, but constructed from a larger set of 256 letters, numbers, and symbols — all codes found in IBM code page 437, often referred to as extended ASCII and used in MS-DOS and Unix environments. ANSI art also contains special ANSI escape sequences that color text with the 16 foreground and 8 background colours offered by ANSI.SYS, an MS-DOS device driver loosely based upon the ANSI X3.64 standard for text terminals. Some ANSI artists take advantage of the cursor control sequences within ANSI X3.64 in order to create animations, commonly referred to as &quot;ANSImations&quot;. ANSI art and text files which incorporate ANSI codes carry the &quot;de facto&quot; file extension.

==Overview==
ANSI art is considerably more flexible than ASCII art, because the particular character set it uses contains symbols intended for drawing, such as a wide variety of box-drawing characters and block characters that dither the foreground and background color. It also adds accented characters and math symbols that often find creative use among ANSI artists.

The popularity of ANSI art encouraged the creation of a powerful shareware package called TheDraw coded by Ian E. Davis in 1986. Not only did it considerably simplify the process of making an ANSI art screen from scratch, but it also included a variety of &quot;fonts&quot;, large letters constructed from box and block characters, and transition animations such as &quot;dissolve&quot; and &quot;clock&quot;. No new versions of TheDraw emerged after version 4.63 in 1993, but in later years a number of other ANSI editors appeared, some of which are still maintained today.

The popular game creation system (GCS) &quot;ZZT&quot; used ANSI graphics exclusively. A later GCS based on the same concept, &quot;MegaZeux&quot;, allowed users to modify the extended ASCII character set as well.

Trade Wars 2002, a multiplayer BBS game that remains popular decades after its release in 1986, used ANSI graphics to depict ships, planets, and important locations, and included cutscenes and even a cinema with ANSI animations. Many of these ANSI graphics were created by Drew Markham, who went on to form Xatrix Entertainment/Gray Matter Studios and develop &quot;Redneck Rampage&quot; and &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, among other titles.

The rise of the internet caused the decline of both BBSes and DOS users, which made ANSI graphics harder to create and to view due to the lack of software compatible with the new dominant operating system Microsoft Windows.

In the end of 2002, all traditional ANSI art groups like ACiD, ICE, CIA, Fire, Dark and many others, were no longer making periodic releases of artworks, called &quot;artpacks&quot; and the community of artists almost vanished. Since then this form of art is no longer practiced to the degree it once was, but was still kept alive by fewer newly created groups like SENSE, 27inch and the late Blocktronics Textmode Art Collective, founded in 2008, and that currently releases artpacks created by artists from all around the world.

Nowadays ANSI graphics have a niche utility for a few telnet BBSes still active and is mainly created by artists for the sake of it and exhibited as an example of retro digital art. The creation of newer Microsoft Windows compatible software like ACiDDraw, and TundraDraw, allowed the small number of remaining artists to keep creating ANSI art. ANSI Art is also practised among demoscene hobbyists still in the 2020s and ANSI art compos (competitions) are regularly held at various demoparties.

== Scene ==
The ANSI artform found wide popularity and distribution on BBS systems throughout North America and the world. Its use of standard computer symbols and colors by particularly talented individuals made it somewhat of &quot;cult&quot; art form and provided a springboard for talented computer artists in later years.

This form gave rise to a &quot;scene&quot;, or subculture community of artists who created competitive groups, similar to hackers (and sometimes overlapping these groups). These groups would assemble their best, most current art into downloadable &quot;packs&quot; for distribution on BBS systems. These could be simply zipped packs of loose art with some text files explaining them, or encoded programs that displayed the art, sometimes with accompanying music in MOD format.

<doc id="1041281" wikidata="Q943742" url="?curid=1041281" title="Olympic Studios">
<text>Olympic Studios was a British independent recording studio based on Church Road, Barnes, London. It is best known for its recordings of many artists throughout the late 1960s to the first decade of the 21st century, including Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Ella Fitzgerald, Queen, Ray Charles, the Who, B. B. King, Traffic, Prince, the Eagles, Eric Clapton, Family, Adele, Björk and MIKA. It is often regarded as being as significant as Abbey Road Studios, and remains an important cultural landmark. The studio&#x27;s sound mixing desks became famous when the technology and design they pioneered was manufactured commercially.

Although much of Olympic has returned to its original purpose as a cinema, it also still maintains a small recording facility, designed with the help of original members of the studio&#x27;s staff, who are now also involved in the construction of a much larger studio, performance and teaching space, to run alongside Olympic&#x27;s cinema at the iconic location.

== First locations ==
The first home of Olympic Sound Studios was in Central London in the late 1950s. It was owned by Angus McKenzie, who had purchased Larry Lyons&#x27;s Olympia Studio in Fulham. McKenzie then took on a lease for a derelict synagogue situated at Carlton Street, in London&#x27;s West End.

In conjunction with Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Swettenham, McKenzie opened Olympic&#x27;s Studio One, with a valve-based recording console from the Olympia Studio. Swettenham designed the first professional transistorised desk in the world, which was installed into Studio One during 1960, along with the first four-track tape recorder in England. The studio first came to prominence in 1958, when its senior sound engineer John Timperley recorded music which was listed in the music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s top ten ratings. John Timperley&#x27;s assistant was Roger Savage, who quickly gained a reputation as a good sound balancer. In 1962, Terry Allen joined the company as an electronic engineer, assisting Dick Swettenham with his new transistorised sound desk. Allen became studio manager, and Timperley left the studios in late 1962, when Keith Grant was given the position of senior sound engineer. Another employee was Michael Ross-Trevor, who later joined CBS Records at the start of a long career in classical music recording. Across both the studio&#x27;s original locations, several other young staff began their careers at Olympic Studios, among them Gus Dudgeon, who began as a tape operator and was later associated with Elton John, using Olympic Studios for sessions with him as his producer.

Studio One was used by many influential groups, such as the Yardbirds, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Dave Mason, Alexis Korner, the Seekers and Graham Bond. The Rolling Stones recorded their first single &quot;Come On&quot; at the studio, and Dusty Springfield hits and the Troggs&#x27; single &quot;Wild Thing&quot; were also recorded at Olympic during the 1960s. Olympic was a preferred recording studio with A&amp;R staff who worked for record companies including Decca, EMI, Pye and Philips. The studios also hosted London Weekend Television music recordings.

== Relocation to Barnes ==
In 1966, after the lease on the Carlton Street premises was not renewed, McKenzie sold his share of the business to Cliff Adams and John Shakespeare, who moved the studios to Barnes, under the guidance of Keith Grant. Grant oversaw the development of the new studios, bringing in his father, Robertson Grant, as an architect.

Situated at 117 Church Road, the Barnes building was constructed in 1906 and known as Byfeld Hall, a theatre for the Barnes Repertory Company. In its first decade, it was a venue associated with the bioscope, an early form of cinema combined with music hall and instrumentation. Between the 1930s and the post-Second World War era, it was once more a cinema. In the 1950s, the building became television production studios. Actors who played there included John Gielgud and Claude Rains.

== Barnes studios recording history ==
As Grant added to and completed the studio, engineer Eddie Kramer recounted that in 1967 &quot;Olympic Studios was at the cutting edge of technology. We were very innovative and of course we had [I think] the best console in England and possibly the world at the time&quot;. &quot;We were ahead in terms of design.&quot;

The Rolling Stones were among the first clients of the new Olympic Studios in Barnes, consecutively recording six of their albums there between 1966 and 1973, and becoming such regular visitors that Mick Jagger even contributed to the design of parts of the studio himself. The Stones continued recording, mixing and overdubbing at the studio from 1989 to 1992. 

Having been happy with their recording of &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re A Rich Man&quot; earlier that year, in the summer of 1967 it was at Olympic in Barnes that the Beatles conceived the first parts and ideas of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, which a fortnight later debuted as part of &quot;Our World&quot;, the first ever global satellite broadcast to millions worldwide.

With both bands regularly sharing the studio in the summer of 1967, Lennon and McCartney joined the Rolling Stones recording of &quot;We Love You&quot;.

Having moved to the UK in the mid-1960s, Jimi Hendrix also spent a significant proportion of his entire recording career at Olympic, recording large parts of his albums&quot; Are You Experienced&quot; (1967), &quot;&quot; (1967), and &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; (1968) at the studio.

For his seminal recording of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, Hendrix was joined by two other musicians regularly to be found at Olympic; Dave Mason of Traffic and Brian Jones, the original founder of the Rolling Stones. Hendrix returned to Olympic for sessions in 1969, and, having recently returned from the U.S., for the last time in the first few months of 1970.

In mid-1969, the Beatles were back again at Olympic, this time recording the first parts of &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;, as well as ideas for their planned &quot;Get Back&quot; album. With the band entering their final year and amid periodic disagreements, McCartney on occasion stayed behind on his own to record with other musicians to be found at the studio.

By now, Olympic had also already started being extensively used by Led Zeppelin, who recorded at the studio for all their 1969 debut &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;, through to all their studio albums inclusive of &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; in 1975, and extending to their single, &quot;Kashmir&quot;, of the same year.

In 1969, Ella Fitzgerald arrived to record at the studio, and in 1971 B. B. King arrived to record his &quot;In London&quot; LP with some of the rock musicians regularly to be found at Olympic.

The Who came to Olympic for their albums &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; (1971), &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; (1973), and &quot;Who Are You&quot; (1978). Queen recorded part of their landmark album &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1975), shortly after David Bowie had completed his album &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;. Olympic also saw the production of numerous other landmark albums and singles, by the Small Faces, Traffic, Hawkwind, Deep Purple, Soft Machine, Blind Faith, the Seekers and the Moody Blues. Procol Harum recorded all tracks for their eponymous first album &quot;Procol Harum&quot; (1967) at Olympic, including the single &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;.

In 1969, Grant commissioned his father to re-design Studio Two, as the now unexpectedly popular studio was causing problems with sound transmission to Studio One. Studio One for example might be recording classical music by Elgar, while Studio Two would be hosting sessions with the Rolling Stones. Robertson Grant successfully innovated a completely floating space weighing seventeen tons, supported by rubber pads. The décor and furnishing of the new Studio Two was designed by Jagger. Later on, Grant added probably the first instant acoustic change, using rough sawn wooden slats which could cover or reveal sound-absorbing panels behind them and change the acoustic sound. This made the room suitable for the recording of both rock and orchestral music, at the pull of a cord.

By the turn of the 1970s, many orchestral works and film scores, such as the original album version of the rock musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, were also being recorded at Olympic. The studio produced film music for &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1968), &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969), the movie version of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1973), &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (recorded in Studio Two in 1975) and &quot;Life of Brian&quot; (1979), amongst others.

Olympic Studios&#x27; sound mixing desks were a creation of the maintenance staff and built specially for the studios. They became known as Olympic desks and were developed by Dick Swettenham, Keith Grant, and later Jim McBride in conjunction with Jim Dowler. Swettenham later started to manufacture the consoles commercially as Helios desks. The first desk of this type was commissioned by Grant as Helios One for Studio Two. Olympic desks and their Helios spin-offs are still highly regarded and sought-after for their sonic qualities today.

== Virgin Music era ==
For many years, copyright problems with the use of the word &quot;Olympic&quot; prevented the history of the studio from being more widely promoted, which became an important factor in its arch-rival Abbey Road Studios attracting greater recognition, due to promotion by EMI.

In 1987, Virgin Music bought the studios and the property was refitted to a different practical and acoustic specification, further to consulting with Sam Toyoshima, a Japanese studio builder, who declared the studio &quot;unfit to record music in&quot;. Barbara Jefferies, then studio manager for Virgin Music at Olympic Studios, instructed that the master tapes of the studio&#x27;s vast library of recording sessions be discarded. The disposal of these tapes was unsecured. They were put into skips outside the building, remaining there for days. Some were recovered by people unassociated with the studio, and ended up as highly sought-after bootlegs. The revamped studio continued to attract many leading artists during the period of the 1990s and 2000s, such as Adele and Björk.

In December 2008, the Virgin EMI group announced that the longstanding studio facilities would be closed, which occurred the following February.

== New Olympic Studios cinema and studio complex ==

The London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspaper reported that a buyer for the building as a studio could not be found and it seemed likely that Olympic Studios would lose its musical and cinematic history due to a development of flats and shops. After four years of closure, Olympic Studios re-opened on 14 October 2013 as a cinema with two screens, a café with dining room and a recording studio. The conversion of part of the original building to a small recording studio was undertaken by architect Robertson Grant and the acoustics completed by original studio designer Keith Grant and Russel Pettinger. The new studio facility operates alongside the building&#x27;s historical role as a cinema using Flare Audio cinema sound. The cinema also uses a Flare sound system.

<doc id="1041286" wikidata="Q864682" url="?curid=1041286" title="Wakame">
<text>Wakame &quot;(Undaria pinnatifida)&quot; is a species of kelp native to cold, temperate coasts of the northwest Pacific Ocean. As an edible seaweed, it has a subtly sweet, but distinctive and strong flavour and satiny texture. It is most often served in soups and salads.

Wakame has long been collected for food in East Asia, and sea farmers in Japan have cultivated wakame since the eighth century (Nara period).

Although native to cold, temperate coastal areas of Japan, Korea, China, and Russia, it has established itself in temperate regions around the world, including New Zealand, the United States, Belgium, France, Great Britain, Spain, Italy, Argentina, Australia and Mexico. , the Invasive Species Specialist Group has listed the species on its list of 100 worst globally invasive species.

Wakame, as with all other kelps and brown algae, is plant-like in appearance, but is unrelated to true plants, being, instead, a photosynthetic, multicellular stramenopile protist of the SAR supergroup.

==Names==
The primary common name is derived from the Japanese name (, , , ).
*In English, it can also be called &quot;sea mustard&quot;.
*In Chinese, it is called () or ()
*In French, it is called or (&#x27;sea fern&#x27;).
*In Korean, it is called ().

==Etymology==
In Old Japanese, stood for edible seaweeds in general as opposed to standing for algae. In kanji, such as , and were applied to transcribe the word. Among seaweeds, wakame was likely most often eaten, therefore especially meant wakame. It expanded later to other seaweeds like kajime, hirome (kombu), arame, etc. &quot;Wakame&quot; is derived from + (, lit. &#x27;young seaweed&#x27;). If this is a eulogistic prefix, the same as the of &quot;tamagushi&quot;, &quot;wakame&quot; likely stood for seaweeds widely in ancient times. In the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, in addition to and (both are read as ), (, soft wakame) can be seen. Besides, (, lit. &#x27;beautiful algae&#x27;), which often appeared in the , may be wakame depending on poems.

==History in the West==
The earliest appearance in Western documents is probably in the Portuguese &quot;Nippo Jisho&quot; (1603), as &quot;Vacame&quot;.

In 1867 the word &quot;wakame&quot; appeared in an English-language publication, &quot;A Japanese and English Dictionary&quot;, by James C. Hepburn.

Starting in the 1960s, the word &quot;wakame&quot; started to be used widely in the United States, and the product (imported in dried form from Japan) became widely available at natural food stores and Asian-American grocery stores, due to the influence of the macrobiotic movement, and in the 1970s with the growing number of Japanese restaurants and sushi bars.

==Aquaculture==

Japanese and Korean sea-farmers have grown wakame for centuries, and are still both the leading producers and consumers. Wakame has also been cultivated in France since 1983, in sea fields established near the shores of Brittany.

Wild-grown wakame is harvested in Tasmania, Australia, and then sold in restaurants in Sydney and also sustainably hand-harvested from the waters of Foveaux Strait in Southland, New Zealand and freeze-dried for retail and use in a range of products.

==Cuisine==
Wakame fronds are green and have a subtly sweet flavour and satiny texture. The leaves should be cut into small pieces as they will expand during cooking.

In Japan and Europe, wakame is distributed either dried or salted, and used in soups (particularly miso soup), and salads (tofu salad), or often simply as a side dish to tofu and a salad vegetable like cucumber. These dishes are typically dressed with soya sauce and vinegar, possibly rice vinegar.

&quot;Goma wakame&quot;, also known as seaweed salad, is a popular side dish at American and European sushi restaurants. Literally, it means &quot;sesame seaweed&quot;, as sesame seeds are usually included in the recipe.

In Korea, wakame is used to make a seaweed soup called &quot;miyeok-guk,&quot; in which wakame is stir-fried in sesame oil and boiled with meat broth.

==Health effects==

A study conducted at Hokkaido University found that a compound in wakame known as fucoxanthin may help burn fatty tissue in mice and rats. Studies in mice have shown that fucoxanthin induces expression of the fat-burning protein UCP1 that accumulates in fat tissue around the internal organs. Expression of UCP1 protein was significantly increased in mice fed fucoxanthin. Wakame is also used in topical beauty treatments. See also Fucoidan.

Wakame is a rich source of eicosapentaenoic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid. At over 400 mg/(100 kcal) or almost 1 mg/kJ, it has one of the higher nutrient-to-energy ratios for this nutrient, and among the very highest for a vegetarian source. Wakame is a low calorie food. A typical 10–20 g (1–2 tablespoon) serving of wakame contains roughly and provides 15–30 mg of omega-3 fatty acids. Wakame also has high levels of sodium, calcium, iodine, thiamine and niacin.

In Oriental medicine it has been used for blood purification, intestinal strength, skin, hair, reproductive organs and menstrual regularity.

In Korea, &quot;miyeok-guk&quot; soup is popularly consumed by women after giving birth as sea mustard () contains a high content of calcium and iodine, nutrients that are important for new nursing mothers. Many women consume it during the pregnancy phase as well. It is also traditionally eaten on birthdays for this reason, a reminder of the first food that the mother has eaten and passed on to her newborn through her milk.

==Invasive species==

Native to cold temperate coastal areas of Japan, Korea, China, and Russia, in recent decades it has become established in temperate regions around the world, including New Zealand, the United States, Belgium, France, Great Britain, Spain, Italy, Argentina, Australia and Mexico. It was nominated one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world. &quot;Undaria&quot; is commonly initially introduced or recorded on artificial structures, where its r-selected growth strategy facilitates proliferation and spread to natural reef sites. &quot;Undaria&quot; populations make a significant but inconsistent contribution of food and habitat to intertidal and subtidal reefs. &quot;Undaria&quot; invasion can cause changes to native community composition at all trophic levels. As well as increasing primary productivity, it can reduce the abundance and diversity of understory algal assemblages, out-compete some native macroalgal species and affect the abundance and composition of associated epibionts and macrofauna, including gastropods, crabs, urchins and fish. Its dense congregation and capability to latch onto any hard surface has caused it to become a major cause of damage to aquaculture apparatus, decreasing efficiency of fishing industries by clogging underwater equipment and fouling boat hulls.

Eradication of wakame within a localized area usually involves getting rid of the plants underwater, often via regular inspection of aquatic environments. Removing the plants underwater without disrupting native flora is accomplished by humans diving underwater and manually removing the reproductive parts of the wakame to reduce its spread. Proper and regular cleaning of underwater apparatus reduces the potential vectors for wakame spores, reducing the spread of the plant.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, &quot;Undaria pinnatifida&quot; was declared as an unwanted organism in 2000 under the Biosecurity Act 1993. It was first discovered in Wellington Harbour in 1987 and probably arrived as hull fouling on shipping or fishing vessels from Asia. In 2010, a single &quot;Undaria pinnatifida&quot; plant was discovered in Fiordland, which has since quickly spread from a small clump and localized itself throughout Fiordland.

Wakame is now found around much of New Zealand, from Stewart Island to as far north as the subtropical waters of Karikari Peninsula. It spreads in two ways: naturally, through the millions of microscopic spores released by each fertile organism, and through human mediated spread, most commonly via hull fouling and with marine farming equipment. It is a highly successful and fertile species, which makes it a serious invader. Its capability to grow in dense congregations on any hard surface allows it to outcompete native flora and fauna for sunlight and space. Although the effects of wakame in New Zealand are not fully understood, with the severity varying depending on the location, the negative impact of wakame is projected to be significant against the fishing and tourism industries in Fiordland, as well as overcrowding in popular diving locations.

Even though it is an invasive species, farming of wakame is permitted in already heavily infested areas of New Zealand, as part of a control program established since 2010. In 2012, the government allowed for the farming of wakame in Wellington, Marlborough and Banks Peninsula. Farmers of wakame must obtain permission from Biosecurity New Zealand to access approval of Sections 52 and 53 from the Biosecurity Act 1993, which deal with exceptions to the possession of pests and unwanted creatures. Furthermore, any farmed wakame must only be naturally settled in pre-existing marine farms; mussel farms are a commonly infested area for wakame. As an exceptional case of permitted farming purely as pest control, profitting from wakame is not permitted, with exception of Ngāi Tahu, in which the iwi&#x27;s revenue from catching wakame is funded for further pest control.

===United States===
The seaweed has been found in several harbors in southern California. In May 2009 it was discovered in San Francisco Bay and aggressive efforts are underway to remove it before it spreads.

<doc id="1041288" wikidata="Q7579155" url="?curid=1041288" title="Spoon busk">
<text>The spoon busk was a specialised kind of busk—the rigid element of a corset placed at the centre front. As its name implies, it was shaped like a spoon, with the bottom part of the busk widening and taking a dished form. It was invented in 1879 by Joseph Beckel of New York City. 

The spoon busk allowed a greater reduction in waist size without producing a bulge of flesh at the bottom edge of the corset. This was a problem experienced when corsets with straight busks of even width were tightly laced: as the flesh of the abdomen was, essentially, squeezed out of place and appeared where there was no pressure. The wide, dished part of a spoon busk accommodated the abdomen, and at the same time compressed and controlled it. Corsets with spoon busks usually descended to a point lower than the level of the hips at the front.

Despite the extra control given by spoon busks, they are not favoured by modern tightlacers as the bottom point of a spoon busk will dig in when a corset is very tight. If a spoon busk is used, it is in a modified version with no dished shape.

==Steel spoon busks==
Galvanized steel spoon busks are not suited for tight lacing because the steel becomes brittle during the manufacturing process. Stainless steel spoon busks, on the other hand, are suitable if reinforced with a layer of flat steel behind the busk. Wissner, a busk and boning manufacturer in Germany makes stainless steel busks. They stopped making galvanized spoon busks because they were breaking under the pressure of tight lacing. If a person buys a spoon busk, they should make sure it is stainless steel and reinforce it with flat boning behind the busk. 

There is still no guarantee that the spoon busk will stand up to tight lacing.

<doc id="1041297" wikidata="Q20758461" url="?curid=1041297" title="Fretless guitar">
<text>A fretless guitar is a guitar with a fingerboard without frets, typically a standard instrument that has had the frets removed, though some custom-built and commercial fretless guitars are occasionally made. 
The classic fretless guitar was first pioneered in 1976 by Turkish musician Erkan Oğur. Fretless bass guitars are readily available, with most major guitar manufacturers producing fretless models.

On the fretless guitar, the performer&#x27;s fingers press the string directly against the fingerboard, as with a violin, resulting in a vibrating string that extends from the bridge (where the strings are attached) to the fingertip instead of to a fret.

== Technique ==

Musicians employ a standard harmony and the twelve-tone technique as a base for exploring tones, using a fretless guitar. Fretless guitars offer musicians an ability to use just intonation in any key and mode and explore new sounds through using microtonal harmonies and folk melodies in a jazz-groove context. A detailed article on extended techniques for fretless electric guitar - written by British guitarist Rich Perks - was published by &quot;Music and Practice&quot; journal in 2019. 

Musicianship with fretless guitars differ from fretted guitars:
* They require greater finger position precision, because the position of the node of the string is continuously variable (being established by the position of the finger) rather than fixed (established by the position of a fret). As a consequence of this, chordal playing in particular is more difficult to achieve accurately.
* The string resonance is reduced, requiring more forceful plucking or modified amplification (pickups) to achieve desired volume.
* The smooth surface of the fingerboard allows legato playing, with smooth transitional slurs between notes

Fretless guitars are uncommon in most forms of western music and generally limited to the electrified instruments, due to their decreased acoustic volume and sustain. The fretless bass guitar has found popularity in many forms of western music, from pop to jazz. The first use of fretless bass guitars dates back to Bill Wyman in the early 1960s. 
Festivals featuring live fretless guitar music have been held for several years both in the US and in Europe. In New York, the first NYC Fretless Guitar Festival was held in 2005. In the Netherlands, the Dutch Fretless Guitar Festival has taken place since 2006.

<doc id="1041298" wikidata="Q1144637" url="?curid=1041298" title="Uniscribe">
<text>Uniscribe is the Microsoft Windows set of services for rendering Unicode-encoded text, supporting complex text layout. It is implemented in the dynamic link library . Uniscribe was released with Windows 2000 and Internet Explorer 5.0. In addition, the Windows CE platform has supported Uniscribe since version 5.0.

&quot;USP&quot; is an initialism for Unicode Scripts Processor. Its features include:
* arranging input text from the input sequence to visual sequence;
* substituting glyphs according to context (e.g., different forms of Arabic characters);
* ordering displayed text based on text flow direction, such as left-to-right or right-to left, horizontal or vertical.

Although Uniscribe continues to be maintained as of 2021, its intended replacement DirectWrite, which has more features, was introduced with Windows 7.

==USP10.DLL Versions==
Below are listed some common versions of codice_1, as well as the methods by which they are distributed.
Features are added according only the &quot;major.minor&quot; part of the version number, the third part in the full version number is used for system target identification numbers for which the DLL was ported by Microsoft, and the last part is the build number on each target system version (which may change within regular system/software updates). Some hotfixes provide upgrades only for specific applications (notably in the Office installation directory), and are not suitable for use in the Windows system directory (whose version of the DLL should never be updated and is often protected by the system):

File sizes may vary depending on specific localizations of the DLL (depending on the target system or application for which it was compiled); those given here are for the US-English localization.

==Universal Shaping Engine==
Scripts with complex text layout have contextual and non-linear requirements to render their typography correctly. These requirements include: ligatures, where two consecutive characters are combined into one shape (Latin, Devanagari); reordering, where some characters are written before the letter they follow in pronunciation (Bengali, Sinhala, and other Indic scripts); and context-shaping, where some letters have to change shape depending on whether they occur in the beginning, middle, or the end of the word (Arabic, Mongolian).

Uniscribe uses several script-specific shaping engines for handling typography in supported complex scripts; these are implemented in addition to a generic engine for non-complex scripts (such as Latin or Cyrillic). The currently used engines include Indic (Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, etc.), Arabic, Hangul, Hebrew, Khmer, Myanmar, and Thai/Lao variants.

The complexity of the Unicode standard and ambiguities in OpenType specification often result in incomplete or erroneous implementations of complex text layout. Script-specific shaping engines work on a case-by-case basis and do not consistently handle common features of OpenType fonts, which makes it difficult for OS programmers and font developers to support new scripts. Implementation errors are very hard or impossible to correct at a later stage without breaking up backward compatibility for existing documents and fonts, often requiring new OpenType layout features and a redesign of existing fonts and typography rendering engines.

In Windows 10, major refactoring work was done for Uniscribe to implement a generalized shaping model, the Universal Shaping Engine (USE). This engine is directly based on glyph properties defined in the Unicode standard, in the hope that any complex script with a suitable font would be supported without the time and effort required to create a dedicated shaping engine.

USE builds on a generalized &quot;universal cluster model&quot; developed for the Indic scripts, which models a superset of human writing systems. The engine classifies each character of a complex script into several categories, base classes and subclasses. For example, a provisional Indic classification includes general, syllabic and positional categories, further divided into base (number, consonant, tone letter, dependent vowel, etc.), base vowel (independent vowel), number (Brahmi joining number), final, medial, and modifier consonants, medial consonants, as well as top, bottom, left and right consonants and vowels. Unicode symbol strings are converted into collections of USE classes using well-defined rules, making glyph composition a standard procedure and allowing inter-character interactions not possible with current language features defined in OpenType specifications.

The Universal Shaping Engine was presented at the OpenType Developer Meeting in 2014; a compatible approach was also implemented by the open source HarfBuzz text shaper. As of 2020, the USE in Windows 10 handles a total of 70 complex scripts: Adlam, Ahom, Balinese, Batak, Bhaiksuki, Brahmi, Buginese, Buhid, Chakma, Cham, Chorasmian, Dives Akuru, Duployan, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, Elymaic, Grantha, Gunjala Gondi, Hanifi Rohingya, Hanunoo, Javanese, Kaithi, Kayah Li, Kharoshthi, Khitan Small Script, Khojki, Khudawadi, Lepcha, Limbu, Mahajani, Makasar, Mandaic, Manichaean, Marchen, Masaram Gondi, Medefaidrin, Meitei Mayek, Miao, Modi, Mongolian, Multani, Nandinagari, Newa, N’Ko, Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong, Pahawh Hmong, Phags-pa, Psalter Pahlavi, Rejang, Saurashtra, Sharada, Siddham, Sinhala, Sogdian, Old Sogdian, Soyombo, Sundanese, Syloti Nagri, Tagalog, Tagbanwa, Tai Le, Tai Tham (limited support), Tai Viet, Takri, Tibetan, Tifinagh, Tirhuta, Wancho, Yezidi, and Zanabazar Square.

==Versions==
Although Uniscribe has been available since Windows 2000, new versions of Uniscribe have provided more functions to the system, namely, support for other writing systems. An earlier update of it supports the display of Arabic and Hebrew, then Thai and Vietnamese. Since Windows XP, more South Asian and Assyrian scripts are supported.

Born Lucinda Mary Hughes, Turnbull is the daughter of Tom Hughes, a former Attorney-General of Australia. Her great-grandfather was Sir Thomas Hughes, the first Lord Mayor of Sydney. She was educated at Kincoppal-Rose Bay, Frensham School in Mittagong, Sydney Girls High School and the University of Sydney, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1982. Turnbull also holds a Master of Business Administration from the Australian Graduate School of Management of the University of New South Wales. In September 2017, Turnbull received an honorary Doctorate of Letters for her substantial and sustained service and contribution to the University and to the Greater Western Sydney region.

==Political career==

Turnbull was elected to Council in 1999 on the Living Sydney independent platform and was immediately elevated to the position of Deputy Lord Mayor, serving under Lord Mayor Frank Sartor. When Sartor resigned as Lord Mayor to enter NSW politics, Turnbull was elected as his replacement. In early 2004, the Carr Labor government dismissed the City of Sydney and South Sydney Councils and forced their amalgamation. Turnbull was subsequently appointed as one of three Commissioners assigned with the responsibility of establishing a new governance structure for the merged council entity. Turnbull, feeling the pressure of the Carr Labor government, approached Clover Moore and encouraged her to run as Lord Mayor in the hope that Labor would not gain control of the City of Sydney.

As Lord Mayor, Turnbull awarded Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi the keys to the city of Sydney in 2003.

==Business and community involvement==

With a background in commercial law and investment banking, Turnbull is a Director and Secretary of Turnbull &amp; Partners Pty Ltd, a private investment company. From October 2010 to November 17, 2017 she was Non-Executive Chairman of biotechnology company Prima BioMed Limited. She was appointed on 25 February 2022 as a Non-Executive Director of ASX listed Immutep (formerly Prima BioMed Ltd).

Turnbull has a long-standing interest in cities and their planning, governance and management, as well as the importance of technological innovation to the national economy. In 1999, she published a book called &quot;Sydney: Biography of a City&quot;. She was an independent member of the Sydney Metropolitan Development Authority, which was charged with the urban renewal and revitalisation of several precincts in Sydney, including Redfern–Waterloo. She was an independent member of the Redfern–Waterloo Authority from its establishment in 2004 until its repeal in December 2011. She is a former board member of the Australian Technology Park, Redfern. From 2004 until 2011, Turnbull served as Deputy Chair of the Committee for Sydney, a think tank for Greater Sydney representing public, private and not-for-profit sectors and focused on the future of the metropolitan city, and chaired it from 2011 until 2015.

Turnbull is a former deputy chair of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) City Expert Advisory Panel (appointed July 2010), which reported to the COAG Reform Council. The Expert Panel was charged with preparing a report published on 1 March 2012, advising COAG Reform Council on whether metropolitan planning systems were consistent with agreed COAG criteria.

Turnbull has also been active in the not-for-profit sector. She serves on boards of the Biennale of Sydney, the Redfern Foundation Limited and the Turnbull Foundation. She is the Patron of DICE Kids, an organisation created at Policy Hack in 2015 and Patron of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. She is also a board member of the NSW Cancer Institute. She has previously chaired the Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospital Foundation, the Sydney Cancer Centre and the Sydney Festival Limited. From 2006–2010, she was a board member of Melbourne IT and before that a board member of WebCentral Limited.

On 26 January 2011, Turnbull was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for her distinguished service to the community, particularly through philanthropic contributions to, and fundraising support for, a range of medical, social welfare, educational, youth and cultural organisations, to local government, and to business.

In 2012, Turnbull was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Business by the University of NSW, and in 2016 was appointed adjunct professor at the Faculty of Built Environment, University of NSW. In 2017, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters from Western Sydney University which she received for her substantial and sustained service and contribution to the University and the Greater Western Sydney region.

Turnbull chaired the Committee for Sydney from 2012 to 2015. In 2015 she was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Greater Sydney Commission, a role she fulfilled until March 2020 when she resigned to work with her husband in their family business.

Turnbull was appointed chair of the Sydney Opera House Trust, commencing 1 January 2021.

==Personal life==

Lucy Hughes was aged 19 when she met Malcolm Turnbull, who was aged 23. Their first date was a dinner with Bob Carr and his wife Helena. Hughes and Turnbull were married on 22 March 1980 in Cumnor, Oxfordshire, England, United Kingdom by a Church of England priest, despite Turnbull then being Presbyterian and Hughes Roman Catholic. After two miscarriages, Lucy and Malcolm Turnbull had two children, Alex (b. 1982) and Daisy (b. 1985). Malcolm Turnbull was a member of the House of Representatives for Wentworth between 2004 and 2018, representing the Liberal Party. He had two stints as the party&#x27;s leader, and in that capacity, in his second term served as the 29th Prime Minister of Australia, in the Turnbull government.

During her husband&#x27;s term as prime minister, the couple resided at The Lodge. They own properties in Sydney, the Hunter Valley and an apartment in Canberra. They also own an apartment in New York City.

<text>The Ethiopian calendar (; ; ), or Geʽez calendar (Geʽez: ; Tigrinya: , ) is the official state civil calendar of Ethiopia and serves as an unofficial customary cultural calendar in Eritrea, and among Ethiopians and Eritreans in the diaspora. It is also an ecclesiastical calendar for Ethiopian Christians and Eritrean Christians belonging to the Orthodox Tewahedo Churches (Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church), Eastern Catholic Churches (Eritrean Catholic Church and Ethiopian Catholic Church), and Eastern Protestant Christian P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay (Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelical) Churches. The Ethiopian calendar is a solar calendar that has much in common with the Coptic calendar of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and Coptic Catholic Church, but like the Julian calendar, it adds a leap day every four years without exception, and begins the year on 11 or 12th of September in the Gregorian calendar (from 1900 to 2099). A gap of seven to eight years between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternative calculation in determining the date of the Annunciation.

The Ethiopian calendar has twelve months, all thirty days long, and five or six epagomenal days, which form a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Geʽez. A sixth epagomenal day is added every four years, without exception, on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the corresponding Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian calendar year, 1 Mäskäräm, for years between 1900 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September (Gregorian). It falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year, however.

== New Year&#x27;s Day ==
The Ethiopian New Year is called &quot;Kudus Yohannes&quot; in Geʽez and Tigrinya, while in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia, it is called &quot;Enkutatash&quot; meaning &quot;gift of jewels&quot;. It occurs on 11 September in the Gregorian calendar; except for the year preceding a leap year, when it occurs on 12 September. The Ethiopian Calendar Year 1998 &quot;Amätä Məhrät&quot; (&quot;Year of Mercy&quot;) began on Gregorian calendar 11 September 2005. The Ethiopian calendar years 1992 and 1996, however, began on the Gregorian dates of 12 September in 1999 and 2003 respectively.

This date correspondence applies for Gregorian years 1900 to 2099. The Ethiopian calendar leap year is every four without exception, while Gregorian centurial years are only leap years when exactly divisible by 400; thus, a set of corresponding dates will most often apply for a single century. As the Gregorian year 2000 is a leap year, the current correspondence lasts two centuries instead.

The start of the Ethiopian calendar year (the Feast of El-Nayrouz) falls on 29 or 30 August (on the year just before the Julian leap year). This date corresponds to the Old-Style Julian calendar; the start of the year has been transferred forward in the currently used Gregorian calendar to 11 or 12 September (on the year just before the Gregorian leap year). This deviation between the Julian and the Gregorian Calendar will increase with the passing of the time.

== Eras ==
=== Incarnation Era ===
To indicate the year, followers of the Ethiopian and Eritrean churches today use the &quot;Incarnation Era&quot;, which dates from the Annunciation of the Incarnation of Jesus on 25 March AD 9 (Julian), as calculated by Annianus of Alexandria &quot;c.&quot; 400; thus, its first civil year began seven months earlier on 29 August AD 8. Meanwhile, Europeans eventually adopted the calculations made by Dionysius Exiguus in AD 525 instead, which placed the Annunciation nine years earlier (Anno Domini#New year) than had Annianus. This causes the Ethiopian year number to be eight years less than the Gregorian year number from January 1 until 10 or 11 September, then seven years less for the remainder of the Gregorian year.

=== Past Eras ===
In the past, a number of other eras for numbering years were also widely used in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and the Kingdom of Aksum.

==== Era of Martyrs ====

The most important era – once widely used by Eastern Christianity, and still used by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt – was the Era of Martyrs, also known as the Diocletian Era, or the era of Diocletian and the Martyrs, whose first year began on 29 October 328.

Respective to the Gregorian and Julian New Year&#x27;s Days, 3½ to 4 months later, the difference between the Era of Martyrs and the Anno Domini is 285 years (285= 15×19). This is because in AD 525, Dionysius Exiguus decided to add 15 Metonic cycles to the existing 13 Metonic cycles of the Diocletian Era (15×19 + 13×19 = 532) to obtain an entire 532 year medieval Easter cycle, whose first cycle ended with the year Era of Martyrs 247 (= 13×20) equal to year DXXXI. It is also because 532 is the product of the Metonic cycle of 20 years and the solar cycle of 28 years. It has 13 months in a year.

==== Anno Mundi ====

===== According to Panodoros =====
Around AD 400, an Alexandrine monk called Panodoros fixed the Alexandrian Era (Anno Mundi = in the year of the world) and the date of creation, on 29 August 5493 BC. After the 6th century AD, the era was used by Egyptian, Ethiopian, and Eritrean chronologists. The twelfth 532 year-cycle of this era began on 29 August AD 360, and so 4×19 years after the Era of Martyrs.

===== According to Anianos =====
Bishop Anianos preferred the Annunciation as New Year&#x27;s Day, 25 March. Thus he shifted the Panodoros era by about six months (to begin on 25 March 5492 BC). In the Ethiopian calendar this was equivalent to 15 Magabit 5501 B.C. (E.C.). The Anno Mundi era remained in usage until the late 19th century.

== Leap year cycle ==
The four-year leap year cycle is associated with the four Evangelists: the first year after an Ethiopian leap year is named the John-year, followed by the Matthew-year, and then the Mark-year. The year with the sixth epagomenal day is traditionally designated as the Luke-year.
The leap year has 7 days every 700 years as opposed to 6 days every four years for the thirteenth month -Pagumen.The pagumen(ጳጉሜን) month has 5 days during the non-leap years.

== Months ==

These Gregorian dates are valid only from March 1900 to February 2100. This is because 1900 and 2100 are not leap years in the Gregorian calendar, while they are in the Ethiopian calendar, meaning dates before 1900 and after 2100 will be offset.

<text>Patrick Stewart Onstad (born January 13, 1968) is a Canadian former professional soccer goalkeeper who serves as the General Manager of the Houston Dynamo. During his career, Onstad played with a variety of clubs in Canada and the United States and was a three-time winner of MLS Cup. He was inducted into the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame in November 2015.

==Youth and college==
Onstad began playing organized soccer with the West Point Grey, Marpole United, and Coquitlam Metro-Ford youth soccer clubs. He then went on to tend goal at the University of British Columbia, who he led to three CIAU National Championships. He was also a two-time Academic All-Canadian, and holds degrees in Human Kinetics and Education.

==Club career==
After graduating, Onstad joined the Vancouver 86ers of the Canadian Soccer League in 1987. From 1988 to 1989, he played for the Winnipeg Fury, also of the CSL. He moved to a third CSL team, the Toronto Blizzard, for 1990 and 1991. Onstad returned to the Fury in 1992, winning both the CSL Championship and the CSL Goalkeeper of the Year Award.

Onstad moved to the APSL in 1994, playing for the Toronto Rockets. After a season with the Rockets, he moved to the Montreal Impact for 1995. In 1996, he played indoor soccer for the Edmonton Drillers of the NPSL. He returned to outdoor soccer in 1997, playing for the Toronto Lynx, again of the A-League.

===United States and Scotland===
In 1998, Onstad moved to his first American team, the Rochester Raging Rhinos, with whom he won the A-League title, and was also named the league&#x27;s Goalkeeper of the Year, after allowing only 13 goals in 26 regular season games. Onstad remained with Rochester for 1999, was named All-League second team, and helped the Rhinos become the only lower league team to win the U.S. Open Cup since the foundation of Major League Soccer.

In 1999, Onstad was signed by Dundee United of Scotland for the 1999–2000 and 2000–2001 seasons, but as third-string goal keeper behind Alan Combe and Paul Gallacher, he did not see any playing time with the first team.

He returned to Rochester in 2001, and although a wrist injury kept him out of action for most of the year, he finished second in the league in goals against the following year.

===Major League Soccer===
On March 13, 2003, Onstad was signed as a discovery player by the San Jose Earthquakes as a replacement for Joe Cannon. Onstad filled in quite well, helping lead the Earthquakes to their second MLS Cup in three years, and winning the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Award. He had another excellent year in 2005, supporting the Earthquakes as they went undefeated at home (the first time any team did that in MLS history) and winning the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield, and winning the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Award for a second time. He was named to the MLS Best XI in both 2003 and 2005.
Along with the rest of his Earthquakes teammates, he moved to Houston for the 2006 season. Onstad played every minute of the regular season for the Dynamo.

After the 2010 MLS season Houston declined Onstad&#x27;s contract option. He elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft, but was not selected in the Re-Entry draft. Shortly thereafter, Onstad announced his retirement on December 21, 2010.

==International career==
Onstad played for Canada at the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship and the 1987 Pan American Games.

Onstad made his senior debut for the Canadian national team on February 18, 1988, against Bermuda, and played a total of 60 games over a 22-year period for the squad. He represented Canada in 15 FIFA World Cup qualification matches in three unsuccessful World Cup qualifying campaigns. His final official international game was an August 2008 World Cup qualification match against Jamaica. He played his last match for Canada in a friendly against Argentina on 24 May 2010, thus becoming the oldest player in Canada&#x27;s history at the age of 42 years and 131 days, breaking the previous record set by David Norman in 1994.

==Coaching career==
Onstad joined D.C. United as an assistant coach alongside Chad Ashton.
It was announced on February 17, 2011, that Onstad would come out of retirement to play for D.C. due to the injuries to Steve Cronin and Bill Hamid. His contract with D.C. United expired on May 31, 2011, and Onstad returned solely to his duties as an assistant coach. Onstad left D.C. in January 2013.

He joined Toronto FC as Chief Scout and Manager of Football Partnerships. Shortly after the firings of general manager Kevin Payne, and director of team and player operations Earl Cochrane, Onstad left the organization.

On January 10, 2014, he joined Columbus Crew SC as an assistant coach, with head coach Gregg Berhalter stating that &quot;Pat is very professional in how he approaches the game, and he brings versatility to his new role. He has great league experience and a winning pedigree, and those are attributes that attracted us to bringing him onboard.&quot; When Gregg Berhalter left Columbus to coach the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team, Onstad was promoted to technical director by Crew president and general manager Tim Bezbachenko.

On November 1, 2021, Onstad was hired as general manager of the Houston Dynamo.

<doc id="1041308" wikidata="Q5330513" url="?curid=1041308" title="Eastern Suburbs railway line">
<text>The Eastern Suburbs Railway (ESR) is a commuter railway line in Sydney constructed in the 1970s. It is operated by Sydney Trains and has stations at Martin Place, Kings Cross, Edgecliff and Bondi Junction. In addition, it has dedicated platforms at Town Hall, Central and Redfern stations. All of these stations are underground. The Eastern Suburbs railway connects with the Illawarra line at Erskineville, forming the Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line. The line features turnbacks at Central, Martin Place and Bondi Junction. There was also previously a rarely used cross-over at Edgecliff. It operates a service every 3 to 5 minutes during weekday peak hours and 8 to 10 minutes at all other times.

== Design ==

The twin-track Eastern Suburbs line consists of eight stations connected mainly by viaduct and tunnel. The stations are finished in terrazzo and colourful tiles.

=== Alignment ===

From a tunnel portal north of Erskineville, the Eastern Suburbs line runs north to Redfern, then Central. The line then heads north-west to Town Hall, then east to Martin Place before emerging near the Art Gallery of New South Wales onto a viaduct across the suburb of Woolloomooloo. The line goes back underground at Kings Cross, before emerging onto a viaduct across Rushcutters Bay. The line goes back underground at Edgecliff, then heads south-east through tunnel to emerge at a cutting in Woollahra, the site of a vestigial station. The lines go back underground at Bondi Junction.

==History==
Proposals for a line to the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney had first been associated with demands in the 1860s that the railway be extended into Sydney&#x27;s city, rather than terminating at the original Sydney station on the south of city. However, priorities in connecting country areas, and the high cost of a city railway meant that such plans were put aside. In the 1880s, the population of the Eastern Suburbs was small, and a railway would not have been viable. Successive Royal Commissions in 1890 &amp; 1896 recommended a railway be built into the city, with the provision for an Eastern Suburbs extension, but both requests were ignored. Preference at the time, however, was for tramway construction: The &quot;Tramways Extension Bill 1880&quot; was passed in 1880 and the tramway network in the Eastern Suburbs spread rapidly, reaching Bondi Beach in 1894, Rose Bay in 1898 and Watsons Bay in 1909. Two other tram lines were also built to Randwick.

===Bradfield&#x27;s plans===

The Eastern Suburbs Railway was a part of engineer Dr John Bradfield&#x27;s scheme for Sydney&#x27;s railways (the Bradfield Scheme). The alignment and profile for the line was set in 1926 and construction on the railway was started by the NSW Department of Railways. Construction commenced with the building of stub tunnels at St James station. These tunnels ran southward from St James rising to clear the City Circle lines and turned east towards the Eastern Suburbs. They then halted pending further construction after the completion of the railway from Central to St James and Wynyard.

The railway was planned to continue approximately parallel to Oxford Street to Bondi Junction. However, the intervention of the Great Depression and World War II halted construction on all Bradfield&#x27;s plans including the Eastern Suburbs Railway causing its abandonment.

===The 1947 plan===
Post War, the construction of the railway returned to government agenda. Two lines would be built: one proceeding on a viaduct out to Kings Cross, then eventually to Bondi Beach. Another line would head from St James via Taylor Square and the Sydney Cricket Ground, extending to Kingsford, with a proposal to extend from Taylor Square to Coogee.

The &quot;City and Suburban Electric Railways (Amendment) Act&quot;, Act No. 13 of 1947, made provision for the construction of further electric railways in the City of Sydney, serving the eastern, southern and south eastern suburbs. This Act amended the earlier scheme proposed by Bradfield in 1916, which had provided for the previous construction work. The City and Suburban Electric Railways (Amendment) Act of 1947 made provision for the construction of of new suburban electric railways. New construction was carried out including the construction of four underground platforms beside Central Station at Chalmers Street (only two would be used for the Eastern Suburbs line, the other two would be used for the Southern Suburbs line). These works were a diversion from Bradfield&#x27;s plan which had trains emanating from St James not Central. Further, instead of running parallel to Oxford Street, the line would run via Kings Cross to Bondi Junction. The second stage of works would extend the line through North Bondi (Muriverie Road Station) and Rose Bay (Dover Road Station).

Construction commenced in late 1951 on sites around Central and Redfern stations with preliminary railway tunnels blasted below Martin Place but ceased in 1952 due to a recession. Works on the four platforms at Central was approximately 30% completed when the project was abandoned again. The project was not revived until the mid-1960s.

===The 1967 plan===

In 1967, the New South Wales Government awarded the contract for the civil and structural design of the entire line to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority (SMA), the federal government agency responsible for the design and construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme in south-eastern Australia. The line was planned to run to Bondi Junction via Kings Cross, as planned in 1947, but then continue to Kingsford via Randwick and the University of New South Wales. Various station options were considered including a station at Rushcutters Bay, but the final conclusion was the line would run Central (by finishing the incomplete platforms), Town Hall (making use of two hitherto unutilised platforms), Martin Place, Kings Cross, Edgecliff, Woollahra, Bondi Junction, Charing Cross, Frenchmans Road, Randwick Junction, University of New South Wales and Kingsford (Nine Ways).

Terrain factors caused the line to be composed of dual single-bore tunnels and have two significant twin track concrete viaduct structures at Woolloomooloo and Rushcutters Bay. The route from Bondi Junction to Kingsford was selected, primarily because of the ease of tunneling through sandstone along the high topological ridgeline that runs from the existing terminus at the Junction, via Waverley, northern Randwick, Randwick Junction and to the eastern side of the University of New South Wales. The intended terminus at Kingsford, where the terrain drops closer to sea level, may have been an above ground station with potential for stabling yards on then government-owned land near the suburb of Daceyville.

To reduce costs and more effectively stage the project, the line was curtailed to Bondi Junction (original plans suggested Edgecliff, but Bondi Junction provided a better option for patronage and road congestion relief reasons). Further, only a single-track connection would be made to the existing Sydney network at Erskineville, with provision for double-tracking at a later stage (along with a new underground platforms at Redfern).

The final contract for the line involved approximately of single track tunnel structures and crossovers, four underground stations (Martin Place, Kings Cross, Edgecliff and Bondi Junction; Town Hall already existed and Central was partially complete) and one surface station (Woollahra, in a cutting), two concrete viaducts and a further of surface works. At Kings Cross a road tunnel bypass of the commercial centre would be constructed coincidentally.

===1976 review===

Work progressed slowly and at significant expense. Industrial action spurred by ethnic tensions delayed the works, as did an injunction taken out by residents of the exclusive suburb of Woollahra to prevent round-the-clock tunnelling works, spawning a chain of legal action that culminated in the High Court of Australia three years after construction finished in 1979. When the Wran government came to power in May 1976, a Board of Review of the Legislative Assembly was set up to examine the merits and feasibility of the Eastern Suburbs Railway project. All tunnelling works had been completed to Bondi Junction and much of the track was laid, but the stations were mostly incomplete. The Board was asked primarily whether the project continue or be abandoned yet again.
The Board made the following recommendations:
* The line be completed and opened to Bondi Junction
* The line be abandoned beyond Bondi Junction
* Stations be scaled back: the report suggested &quot;inter alia&quot; no shopping plaza be constructed at Bondi Junction as planned (Martin Place, being further advanced, should retain its shopping plaza), the number of escalators be reduced, platforms be tiled only four carriage lengths as only four carriage trains would be used at opening, and that the size, scale and finish of bus-rail interchanges at Bondi Junction and Edgecliff be reduced
* New work be commissioned to integrate the line to the existing Illawarra line, including: constructing a second track from Central to Erskineville, underground platforms at Redfern station and a turnback tunnel (for trains coming from the Illawarra Line) at Martin Place

The recommendations were almost entirely accepted: the line would be truncated to Bondi Junction (but platforms would be tiled their full length). Further, due to residents&#x27; demands, costs and poor patronage expectations, Woollahra station would not be completed (there remains a vestigial station on site, with platform walls in place). Lastly, it was decided to build the Bondi Junction Bypass section of the Eastern Suburbs Freeway (a road otherwise unbuilt), now Syd Einfeld Drive.

===Opening===
The Eastern Suburbs line was finally opened on 23 June 1979 by then-New South Wales premier Neville Wran around 50 years after it was first planned and 31 years after construction began – construction had taken place at a rate of approximately 250 metres per year on average. Only double-deck rolling stock was used on the line – the first line in Sydney to become all double-deck. When opened, the integration with the rest of the Sydney network (announced as a result of the 1976 report) had not been completed, so the line operated as a short-lived self-contained shuttle service between Central and Bondi Junction at five-minute frequencies during the day and peak. The additional works were completed for the 1980 timetable change integrating the line into the Illawarra line, thus helping to relieve congestion by removing Illawarra line services from the City Circle.

The new stations on the line were equipped with magnetic stripe ticketing and turnstiles, but that technology was not extended to the remainder of the network, leaving the majority of stations within the suburban network issuing Edmondson tickets. This situation did not change until both ticketing systems were replaced by the Automated Ticketing System in 1992–1993.

Bondi Junction had originally been intended only as an intermediate turnback station before the extension to Kingsford was abandoned. In 1990, the land set aside for this extension in Randwick and Kingsford was sold.

As part of the Rail Clearways Program, the $77 million Bondi Junction Turnback project saw a new rail crossover built between the single-track tunnels, enabling 20 trains an hour, up from 14, to use the station. The small number of services which ran from the Illawarra Line onto the City Circle were also transferred onto the Eastern Suburbs Line at this time. The work was completed in time for the introduction of a new timetable on 28 May 2006.

In 1999, a private proposal to extend the railway to Bondi Beach at a cost of $197 million received backing from the Federal Government but the scheme did not go ahead. The project proposed to extend the Eastern Suburbs Railway from its current terminus at Bondi Junction to a new underground station at Bondi Beach. The Bondi Beach Railway Company, owned by Lendlease and Macquarie Bank, proposed to build and maintain the railway and to operate it for a 30-year term. The physical works involved the extension eastwards of the existing tunnels at Bondi Junction with the construction of a new single-track tunnel to the proposed Bondi Beach station site under South Bondi Park.

Local residents opposed several aspects of the project, including the site chosen for the station, the impact on bus services and the proposed station use fare surcharge. When the Airport Link Company, the operator of the Airport line, went into receivership due to low patronage in 2000, interest in constructing the Bondi Beach extension collapsed. In 2001, the government rejected the proposed extension to Bondi Beach as a public-private partnership.

<text>Phytoplasmas are obligate intracellular parasites of plant phloem tissue and of the insect vectors that are involved in their plant-to-plant transmission. Phytoplasmas were discovered in 1967 by Japanese scientists who termed them [[mycoplasma]]-like organisms. Since their discovery, phytoplasmas have resisted all attempts at &quot;in vitro&quot; culture in any cell-free medium; routine cultivation in an artificial medium thus remains a major challenge. Phytoplasmas are characterized by the lack of a cell wall, a pleiomorphic or filamentous shape, a diameter normally less than 1 μm, and a very small genome.

Phytoplasmas are pathogens of agriculturally important plants, including coconut, sugarcane, sandalwood, and cannabis, as well as horticultural crops like sweet cherry, peaches, and nectarines. They cause a wide variety of symptoms ranging from mild yellowing, small fruit, and reduced sugar content to death. Phytoplasmas are most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. They are transmitted from plant to plant by vectors (normally sap-sucking insects such as leafhoppers) in which they both survive and replicate.

==History==
References to diseases now known to be caused by phytoplasmas can be found as far back as 1603 (mulberry dwarf disease in Japan). Such diseases were originally thought to be caused by viruses, which, like phytoplasmas, require insect vectors and cannot be cultured. Viral and phytoplasmic infections share some symptoms. In 1967, phytoplasmas were discovered in ultrathin sections of plant phloem tissue and were termed mycoplasma-like organisms due to their physiological resemblance. The organisms were renamed phytoplasmas in 1994 at the 10th Congress of the International Organization for Mycoplasmology.

==Morphology==
Phytoplasmas are Mollicutes that are bound by a triple-layered membrane rather than a cell wall. The phytoplasma cell membranes studied to date usually contain a single immunodominant protein of unknown function that constitutes most of the protein in the membrane. A typical phytoplasma is pleiomorphic or filamentous in shape and is less than 1 μm in diameter. Like other prokaryotes, phytoplasmic DNA is distributed throughout the cytoplasm instead of being concentrated in a nucleus.

==Symptoms==
Phytoplasmas can infect and cause various symptoms in more than 700 plant species. One characteristic symptom is abnormal floral organ development, including phyllody (the production of leaf-like structures in place of flowers), virescence (the development of green flowers attributable to a loss of pigment by petal cells), and fasciation (abnormal change in the apical meristem structure). Phytoplasma-harboring flowering plants may become sterile. The expression of genes involved in maintaining the apical meristem or in the development of floral organs is altered in the morphologically affected floral organs of phytoplasma-infected plants.

A phytoplasma infection often triggers leaf yellowing, probably due to the presence of phytoplasma cells in the phloem, which can affect phloem function and carbohydrate transport, inhibit chlorophyll biosynthesis, and trigger chlorophyll breakdown. These symptoms may be attributable to stress caused by the infection rather than a specific pathogenetic process.

Many phytoplasma-infected plants develop a bushy or &quot;witches&#x27; broom&quot; appearance due to changes in their normal growth patterns. Most plants exhibit apical dominance, but infection can trigger the proliferation of axillary (side) shoots and a reduction in internode size. Such symptoms are actually useful in the commercial production of poinsettias. An infection triggers more axillary shoot production; the poinsettia plants thus produce more than a single flower.

==Effector (virulence) proteins==
Many plant pathogens produce virulence factors, or effectors, that modulate or interfere with normal host processes to the benefit of the pathogens. The first phytoplasmal virulence factor, a secreted protein termed “tengu-su inducer” (TENGU; ), was identified in 2009 from a phytoplasma causing yellowing of onions. TENGU induces characteristic symptoms, including witches&#x27; broom and dwarfism. Transgenic expression of TENGU in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; plants induced sterility in male and female flowers.
TENGU contains a signal peptide at its N-terminus. After cleavage, the mature protein is only 38 amino acids long. Although phytoplasmas are restricted to the phloem, TENGU is transported from the phloem to other cells, including those of the apical and axillary meristems. TENGU was suggested to inhibit both auxin- and jasmonic acid-related pathways, thereby affecting plant development. Surprisingly, the N-terminal 11 amino acid region of the mature protein triggers symptom development in &quot;Nicotiana benthamiana&quot; plants. TENGU undergoes proteolytic processing by a plant serine protease &quot;in vivo&quot;, suggesting that the N-terminal peptide alone induces the observed symptoms. TENGU homologs have been identified in AY-group phytoplasmas. All such homologs undergo processing and can induce symptoms, suggesting that the symptom-inducing mechanism is conserved among TENGU homologs.

In 2009, 56 genes for secreted proteins were identified in the genome of aster yellows witches&#x27; broom phytoplasma strain (AY-WB); these were named secreted AY-WB proteins (SAPs) and considered effectors. Also in 2009, effector SAP11 was shown to target plant cell nuclei and unload from phloem cells in AY-WB-infected plants. SAP11 was later found to induce changes in leaf shapes of plants and stem proliferations which resembled the witches&#x27; broom symptoms of AY-WB-infected plants. In addition, it was demonstrated that SAP11 interacts with and destabilizes plant class II TCP protein domain transcription factors that lead to shoot proliferation and leaf shape changes. TCPs also control the expression of lipoxygenase genes required for jasmonate biosynthesis. Jasmonate levels are decreased in phytoplasma-infected &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; plants and plants that transgenically express the AY-WB SAP11 effector. The downregulation of jasmonate production is beneficial to phytoplasmas because jasmonate is involved in plant defenses against herbivorous insects such as leafhoppers. Leafhoppers lay increased numbers of eggs on AY-WB-infected plants, at least in part because of SAP11 production. For example, the leafhopper &quot;Macrosteles quadrilineatus&quot; laid 30% more eggs on plants expressing SAP11 transgenically than control plants and 60% more eggs on plants infected with AY-WB. Phytoplasmas cannot survive in the external environment and are dependent upon insects such as leafhoppers for transmission to new (healthy) plants. Thus, by compromising jasmonate production, SAP11 encourages leafhoppers to lay more eggs on phytoplasma-infected plants, thereby ensuring that newly hatched leafhopper nymphs feed upon infected plants to become phytoplasma vectors. SAP11 effectors are identified in a number of divergent phytoplasmas and these effectors also interact with TCPs and modulate plant defenses. SAP11 is the first phytoplasma virulence protein for which plant targets and effector functions were identified. TCPs were found to be targeted by a number of other pathogen effectors.

The AY-WB phytoplasma effector SAP54 was shown to induce virescence and phyllody when expressed in plants, and homologs of this effector were found in at least three other phytoplasmas. Two SAP54 homologs, PHYL1 of the onion yellows phytoplasma and PHYL1PnWB of the peanut witches&#x27; broom phytoplasma, also induce phyllody-like floral abnormalities. These results suggest that PHYL1, SAP54, and their homologs form a phyllody-inducing gene family, the members of which are termed phyllogens. MADS-box transcription factors (MTFs) of the ABCE model play critical roles in floral organ development in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;. Phyllogens interact directly with class A and class E MTFs, inducing protein degradation in a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent manner that, at least for SAP54, is dependent on interactions with the proteasome shuttle factor RAD23. Interestingly, RAD23 mutants do not show phyllody when infected with phytoplasma indicating that RAD23 proteins are susceptibility factors; i.e. phytoplasmas and SAP54 require these plant proteins to induce phyllody symptoms. The accumulation of mRNAs encoding class B MTFs, the transcription of which is positively regulated by class A and class E MTFs, is drastically decreased in Arabidopsis constitutively expressing PHYL1. Phyllogens induce abnormal floral organ development by inhibiting the functions of these MTFs. RAD23 proteins are also required for promoting leafhopper vector egg laying on plants that express SAP54 and are infected with AY-WB phytoplasma.

==Transmission==

===Movement between plants===
Phytoplasmas are spread principally by insects of the families Cicadellidae (leafhoppers), Fulgoridae (planthoppers), and Psyllidae (jumping plant lice),
which feed on the phloem of infected plants, ingesting phytoplasmas and transmitting them to the next plant on which they feed. Thus, the host range of phytoplasmas is strongly dependent upon that of the insect vector. Phytoplasmas contain a major antigenic protein constituting most of the cell surface protein. This protein associates with insect microfilament complexes and is believed to control insect-phytoplasma interactions. Phytoplasmas can overwinter in insect vectors or perennial plants. Phytoplasmas can have varying effects on their insect hosts; examples of both reduced and increased fitness have been noted.

Phytoplasmas enter the insect body through the stylet, pass through the intestine, and then move to the hemolymph and colonize the salivary glands. The entire process can take up to 3 weeks. Once established in an insect host, phytoplasmas are found in most major organs. The time between ingestion by the insect and attainment of an infectious titer in the salivary glands is termed the latency period.

Phytoplasmas can also be spread via dodders (&quot;Cuscuta&quot;) or by vegetative propagation such as the grafting of infected plant tissue onto a healthy plant.

===Movement within plants===
Phytoplasmas move within phloem from a source to a sink, and can pass through sieve tube element. However, as phytoplasmas spread more slowly than solutes, and for other reasons, passive translocation within plants is thought to be unimportant

==Detection and diagnosis==
Before the molecular era, the diagnosis of diseases caused by phytoplasma was difficult because the organisms could not be cultured. Thus, classical diagnostic techniques, including symptom observation, were used. Ultrathin sections of phloem tissue from plants with suspected phytoplasma-infections were also studied. The empirical use of antibiotics such as tetracycline was additionally employed.

Molecular diagnostic techniques for phytoplasma detection began to emerge in the 1980s and included enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based methods. In the early 1990s, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques were developed. These are far more sensitive than ELISAs, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis allowed the accurate identification of various phytoplasma strains and species.

More recent techniques allow infection levels to be assessed. Both quantitative PCR and bioimaging can effectively quantify phytoplasma titers within plants. In addition, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is now available as a commercial kit, allowing all known phytoplasma species to be detected in about 1 h, including the DNA extraction step.

Although phytoplasmas have recently been reported to be grown in a specific artificial medium, experimental repetition has yet to be reported.

==Control==
Phytoplasmas are normally controlled by the breeding and planting of disease-resistant crop varieties and by the control of insect vectors.

Tissue culture can be used to produce healthy clones of phytoplasma-infected plants. Cryotherapy, the freezing of plant samples in liquid nitrogen, prior to tissue culture increases the probability of producing healthy plants in this manner.

Plantibodies targeting phytoplasmas have also been developed.

Tetracyclines are bacteriostatic to phytoplasmas. However, disease symptoms reappear in the absence of continuous antibiotic application. Thus, tetracycline is not a viable agricultural control agent, but it is used to protect ornamental coconut trees.

==Genetics==
The genomes of four phytoplasmas have been sequenced: &quot;onion yellows&quot;, &quot;aster yellows witches&#x27; broom&quot; (&quot;&quot;Candidatus&quot; Phytoplasma asteris&quot;), &quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; Phytoplasma australiense&quot;, and &quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; Phytoplasma mali&quot;. Phytoplasmas have very small genomes with extremely low GC content (sometimes as little as 23%, which is thought to be the lower threshold for a viable genome). In fact, the Bermuda grass white-leaf phytoplasma (&quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; P. cynodontis&quot;) has a genome size of only 530 kilobases (kb), one of the smallest known genomes of all living organisms. The larger phytoplasma genomes are around 1350 kb in size. The small genome size of phytoplasma is attributable to reductive evolution from &quot;Bacillus&quot;/&quot;Clostridium&quot; ancestors. Phytoplasmas have lost ≥75% of their original genes, and can thus no longer survive outside of insects or plant phloem. Some phytoplasmas contain extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.

Despite their small genomes, many predicted phytoplasma genes are present in multiple copies. Phytoplasmas lack many genes encoding standard metabolic functions and have no functioning homologous recombination pathway, but they do have a &quot;sec&quot; transport pathway. Many phytoplasmas contain two rRNA operons. Unlike other Mollicutes, the triplet code of UGA is used as a stop codon in phytoplasmas.

Phytoplasma genomes contain large numbers of transposons and insertion sequences, as well as a unique family of repetitive extragenic palindromes termed PhREPS, for which no role is known. It is theorized that the stem-loop structures in PhREPS play a role in transcription termination or genome stability.

==Taxonomy==
Phytoplasmas belong to the monotypic order Acholeplasmatales. In 1992, the Subcommittee on the Taxonomy of Mollicutes proposed the use of &quot;&#x27;Phytoplasma&#x27; rather than &#x27;mycoplasma-like organisms&#x27; for reference to the phytopathogenic mollicutes&quot;. In 2004, the generic name Phytoplasma was adopted and is currently of Candidatus (Ca.) status (used for bacteria that cannot be cultured). As phytoplasma cannot be cultured, methods normally used to classify prokaryotes are not available. Phytoplasma taxonomic groups are based on differences in fragment sizes produced by restriction digests of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences (RFLPs) or by comparisons of DNA sequences from 16S/23S spacer regions. The actual number of taxonomic groups remains unclear; recent work on computer-simulated restriction digests of the 16Sr gene suggested up to 28 groups, whereas others have proposed fewer groups with more subgroups. Each group includes at least one &quot;Ca.&quot; Phytoplasma species, characterized by distinctive biological, phytopathological, and genetic properties.

<text>The Royal Wessex Yeomanry is a reserve armoured regiment of the British Army Reserve consisting of five squadrons. Formerly part of 43 (Wessex) Brigade, the regiment joined 3rd Division in July 2014, to provide armoured (main battle tank) resilience to the three armoured regiments within the Reaction Force. In 2015 the regiment was moved from the operational command of 3rd Division to 1st Armoured Infantry Brigade, and later to 12th Armoured Brigade Combat Team, but members of the regiment still wear the 3rd Division formation badge to reflect their role in supporting the three armoured regiments in the division.

==History==
The regiment can trace its history back to 4 June 1794, when a meeting of country gentlemen at the Bear Inn in Devizes decided to raise a body of ten independent troops of yeomanry for the county of Wiltshire, which became the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry. The Wessex Yeomanry was formed on 1 April 1971 by re-raising cadres from the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry, the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars and the Royal Devon Yeomanry to form four squadrons. The Wessex Yeomanry was granted its royal title, becoming the Royal Wessex Yeomanry, on 8 June 1979. Initially designated as infantry, in the 1980s it was redesignated as a reconnaissance regiment and became one of the Military Home Defence Reconnaissance regiments. Following the Strategic Defence Review, the regiment merged with the Dorset Yeomanry in July 1999 and was reorganised.

Before the Army 2020 plan, the regiment had three roles:

*The training of Challenger 2 main battle tank crewmen as Turret Crew Replacements. This commitment was provided by B (RWY), C (RGH) and D (RDY) Squadrons.
*Armour Replacement, provided by A (DY) Squadron.
*The provision of skilled officers and senior non-commissioned officers to support the Regular Army on operations as &#x27;watchkeepers&#x27; and liaison officers. This was provided by all four squadrons.

Since 2013, the regiment has been the United Kingdom&#x27;s only Armoured Reinforcement Regiment, providing armoured (main battle tank) resilience to the three remaining regular Army armoured regiments: the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars (QRH), the King&#x27;s Royal Hussars (KRH) and the Royal Tank Regiment (RTR). All five squadrons train Challenger 2 crewmen. The RWxY has conducted Challenger 2 driver training at Bovington, Sennelager (Germany), and Salisbury Plain Training Area, and live firing at Lulworth and Castlemartin Ranges.

Each squadron maintains the traditions of its forebear regiment, maintaining a sense of pride and rivalry. In 2011, there was a Regimental Celebration of 40 years since the founding of the Royal Wessex Yeomanry, although, at this time, the Dorset Yeomanry was not part of the regiment. The Earl of Wessex, the Regimental Colonel, visited, met members of the regiment and their families and also participated in a private guided tour of the neighbouring Tank Museum.

==Recruitment==
Like all of the regiments within the British Army, the regiment accepts recruits from all over the country. However, this regiment traditionally recruits from Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Shropshire and Wiltshire, along with neighbouring counties such as Cornwall, Hampshire, Oxfordshire and Somerset.

==Organisation==
Each squadron keeps within its title the name of its antecedent, county, yeomanry regiment:

*Regimental Headquarters, at Allenby Barracks, Bovington Camp BH20
*A (Dorset Yeomanry) Squadron, at Allenby Barracks, Bovington Camp BH20
*B (Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry) Squadron, at Army Reserve Centre, Old Sarum SP4
*C (Royal Gloucestershire Hussars) Squadron, at Army Reserve Centre, Somerford Road, Cirencester GL7
**C (Cassino) Troop, at Venning Barracks, Donnington TF2
*D (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Squadron, at Wyvern Barracks, Exeter EX2
**Barnstaple Troop, at Fortescue Lines, Barnstaple EX32
*Y (Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry) Squadron, at Army Reserve Centre, Swindon SN1
Under the Future Soldier Programme, C and Y Squadrons will amalgamate into a single C Squadron.

Unusually, B Squadron is the senior of the regiment&#x27;s five squadrons. This is because the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry is the senior Yeomanry regiment in the Yeomanry Order of Precedence, having been raised in 1794. It is not designated as A Squadron (which would be the usual practice) because there was already a Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry squadron in the Royal Yeomanry with which it could be confused. In summer 2014, this Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry Squadron joined the Royal Wessex Yeomanry, becoming Y Squadron.

The Earl of Wessex is the Royal Honorary Colonel of the Royal Wessex Yeomanry.

==Uniform==

The Royal Wessex Yeomanry Tactical Recognition Flash (TRF) is taken from the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, whose insignia was a broken spur in a black diamond during the First World War. It signifies that its units were once mounted but now serve as infantry. The TRF took its colour scheme from the facings of the collars and cuffs of the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars (buff), and the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry, Dorset Yeomanry and Royal Devon Yeomanry (all scarlet). In 2016, the colour scheme of the TRF was changed, replacing the scarlet with blue, and the &#x27;broken spur&#x27; replaced by a complete spur.

The regiment wears a brown beret, similar to that worn by the King&#x27;s Royal Hussars, with a square black patch behind the cap badge to represent the RTR affiliation. Until July 2014, each squadron wore the cap badge of its antecedent Yeomanry regiment, meaning that, unlike most other British Army regiments, the RWxY still had four cap badges. On 5 July 2014 all squadrons, including Y Squadron (formerly A Squadron the Royal Yeomanry), adopted a single unifying cap badge featuring the white dragon of England.

<text>Turnov (; ) is a town in Semily District in the Liberec Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 15,000 inhabitants. It is a traditional centre for gemstone polishing, glass craftsmanship and arts. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

Turnov lies near the Bohemian Paradise Protected Landscape Area which makes it a place for tourists and summer residents. The town is an important traffic crossroads. Turnov has a large museum, three galleries, six churches and a synagogue. The small old town of Middle Ages urbanism is surrounded by modern garden neighbourhoods and large parks representing an organic connection between urban areas and nature.

==Administrative division==
Turnov consists of 13 municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Turnov (11,261)
*Bukovina (131)
*Daliměřice (1,148)
*Dolánky u Turnova (33)
*Hrubý Rohozec (39)
*Kadeřavec (94)
*Kobylka (109)
*Loužek (9)
*Malý Rohozec (308)
*Mašov (660)
*Mokřiny (15)
*Pelešany (396)
*Vazovec (39)
==Etymology==
The origin of the name is uknown. According to one theory, the initial name of the settlement was Trnov and the name was derived from the adjective (i.e. &#x27;thorny&#x27;), referring to the local vegetation, but there is no evidence.

==Geography==
Turnov is located about south of Liberec. The Jizera River flows through the town. It lies in the Jičín Uplands. The highest point is the hill Cestník at above sea level. Turnov lies at the edge of the Bohemian Paradise Protected Landscape Area.

==History==
The first written mention of Turnov is in a deed of King Ottokar II from 1272. Turnov was founded around 1250 by Jaroslav and Havel of Markvartice on a spur of rock overlooking the Jizera River. A Dominican cloister was founded by Saint Zdislava, wife of Sir Havel. During the later medieval period, Turnov came into the possession of the Wartenberg and Smiřický noble houses. The medieval town was frequently vulnerable to fires – it was burnt by Lusatian crusaders in 1468 and during the Thirty Years&#x27; War by Swedes in 1643, as well as a conflagration in 1707.

Turnov has long been known for its expertise with gemstones. It attracted many medieval craftsmen and artisans who produced jewelry out the local Bohemian garnet. The first European technical school for the processing of gemstones, metals and jewelry, nowadays the Applied Arts Secondary School, was founded in Turnov in 1884 and still exists as one of the best schools of this type in the world.

===Jewish community===
The Turnov Jewish community was first documented in 1527. After it ceased to exist at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries, new Jewish settlers were invited to the town by Albrecht von Wallenstein in 1623. The Jewish ghetto was established in 1647. Most of the Jewish population were killed during the Holocaust and only 19 of them returned to Turnov after World War II. The Jewish community officially ceased to exist in 1961.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
Turnov is an important traffic crossroads. The D10 motorway from Prague ends just beyond the municipal limits and runs through the town as the I/10 road (part of the European route E65). The I/35 road (the section from Liberec to Hradec Králové, part of the European route E442) also runs through the town.

Turnov is the terminus of the railway line Prague–Turnov. The town is also located on the interregional railway line from Liberec to Hradec Králové and Pardubice.

==Sights==

The Renaissance town hall in Turnov dates from 1562, while its three historical churches date from throughout the 14th–19th centuries. In a suburb lies the Hrubý Rohozec Castle, built in 1250 and later reconstructed into a château; today it is admissible to the public. The municipality itself is now the owner of the Valdštejn Castle, the cradle of the famous Waldstein family, which is also open for tourists.

The former synagogue in Turnov dates from 1779. Between the 1950s and 2003, the building was used as a warehouse. In 2003, the building was bought by the Town of Turnov and it was restored to become a concert place and a memorial. The Jewish cemetery was founded in the 17th century. The oldest preserved tombstone dates from 1649.

Museum of the Bohemian Paradise in Turnov has a significant collection of gemstones and jewelry, as well as exhibits on geology, archaeology and folklore. It was founded in 1886.

<doc id="1041319" wikidata="Q1618844" url="?curid=1041319" title="Hilltop Hoods">
<text>Hilltop Hoods is an Australian hip hop group that formed in 1994 in Blackwood, Adelaide, South Australia. They are regarded as pioneers of the &quot;larrikin-like&quot; style of Australian hip hop. The group was founded by Suffa (Matthew David Lambert) and Pressure (Daniel Howe Smith), who were joined by DJ Debris (Barry John M. Francis) after fellow founder, DJ Next (Ben John Hare), left in 1999. The group released its first extended play, &quot;Back Once Again&quot;, in 1997 and have subsequently released eight studio albums, two &quot;restrung&quot; albums and three DVDs.

Six of their eight albums have peaked at number one on the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Charts, recently setting the record for most No. 1 Albums by an Australian band or group: &quot;The Hard Road&quot; (2006), &quot;State of the Art&quot; (2009), &quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot; (2012), &quot;Walking Under Stars&quot; (2014), &quot;Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Great Expanse&quot; (2019). Three tracks have reached the top 10 on the ARIA Singles Chart—&quot;Chase That Feeling&quot; (2009), &quot;I Love It&quot;, featuring Sia (2011) and &quot;Higher&quot;, featuring James Chatburn (2015) — while a further two tracks — &quot;Cosby Sweater&quot; (2014) and &quot;1955&quot; (2016) — reached the top 5. &quot;1955&quot;, featuring Montaigne &amp; Tom Thum, peaked at number 2 in the Australian charts.

Hilltop Hoods have toured both in Australia and overseas, including playing at music festivals: T in the Park, Oxegen, the Big Day Out, Clipsal 500, Southbound, The Great Escape, Splendour in the Grass, Bassinthegrass, Groovin&#x27; The Moo, Falls Festival, Pyramid Rock Festival, Rollercoaster, Come Together Festival and Make Poverty History.

The band hold the record for the most recurrent artist in the history of the Triple J Hottest 100, with 23 songs voted into the annual countdowns since their first appearance in 2003. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006 they won &quot;Best Independent Release&quot; and &quot;Best Urban Album&quot; for &quot;The Hard Road&quot;. In 2007, they won &quot;Best Urban Album&quot; for their remix album, &quot;The Hard Road: Restrung&quot; (2007). They won the same category in 2009 for &quot;State of the Art&quot; and in 2012 for &quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot;. In 2009, Debris also won &quot;Engineer of the Year&quot; for his work on &quot;State of the Art&quot;. The band received their seventh ARIA award in 2014 when &quot;Walking Under Stars&quot; won in the Best Urban Album category at the 28th ARIA Awards.

==History==
===1987–2001: Formation and early years===
Two of Hilltop Hoods&#x27; founders first met in early 1990s when MC Suffa (aka Matthew David Lambert) and Pressure (Daniel Howe Smith) attended Blackwood High School in Eden Hills – a suburb of Adelaide. In 1996 they joined up with DJ Next (Ben John Hare) through a mutual friend and formed an Australian hip hop group. Their name was supplied by fellow local MC Flak (from Cross Bred Mongrels) – the suburb of Blackwood is known by locals as the Hilltop. The band&#x27;s influences include American hip hop artists: Notorious B.I.G., KRS-One, Gang Starr, Wu-Tang Clan and Public Enemy.

At live shows DJ Next was the group&#x27;s DJ, for recording he contributed audio engineering and all the scratching/turntablism on their early works. He regularly competed in the local DMC World DJ Championships (DMC) tournaments, winning the South Australian DMC championships multiple times. Hilltop Hoods recorded a demo, &quot;Highlanders&quot;, which was released on cassette tape only. As well as Pressure and Suffa on vocals, the group included MC Summit aka DJ Sum-1, but he did not appear on later Hilltop Hoods work.

The group&#x27;s first official release in 1997, available on vinyl and cassette only, was a seven-track extended play, &quot;Back Once Again&quot;. Production was handled by DJ Debris (Barry John M Francis), turntablism and audio engineering by DJ Next, vocals by Pressure and Suffa. The third track, &quot;Shades of Grey&quot;, features Debris with a verse, and was co-written by Francis, Hare, Lambert and Smith. Fifth track, &quot;Mankind Must Suffa&quot; also features a guest verse from Quromystix (aka Quro, Andrew Michael Bradley) – a member of Finger Lickin&#x27; Good and later the Fuglemen. &quot;Mankind Must Suffa&quot; is credited to Lambert, Smith, Francis and Bradley. &quot;Back Once Again&quot; is out of print and unavailable for retail purchase.

The group&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;, was released in 1999 on CD only. As with &quot;Back Once Again&quot;, it is now unavailable for retail purchase. All scratching/turntablism is performed by DJ Next, a track, &quot;Let Me Show You&quot;, has no vocals – solely showcasing his turntable skills. American MC Bukue One (Tion Torrence) appears for a guest verse on &quot;Deaf Can Hear&quot;. The track is credited to Lambert, Smith, Francis, Hare and Torrence. The album was released independently but with financial assistance from Arts SA – the band were inspired, in 2005, to set up their own Hilltop Hoods Initiative, to help local artists. After the album appeared, DJ Next left the group and moved to Melbourne. In 2004 he moved to London. In 1999 Debris, who was also a member of the Cross Bred Mongrels, replaced Next and became the Hilltop Hoods&#x27; full-time DJ.

Hilltop Hoods founded the Certified Wise Crew – a hip-hop collaborative – with local groups Terra Firma, Cross Bred Mongrels and After Hours. Certified Wise Crew has since expanded to include MCs Trauma, Blockade, Kolaps, Flea, with Vents and Funkoars joining in later years. Hilltop Hoods received two nominations for the Hip Hop Act of the Year Award at the Australian Dance Music Awards and again at the 3D World Music Awards in 2001 and 2002. In 2001 the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Left Foot, Right Foot&quot;, was released with Lambert, Francis and M. Veraquth producing.

===2003–2007: &quot;The Calling&quot; and &quot;The Hard Road&quot;===
On 22 September 2003, Hilltop Hoods released their third album, &quot;The Calling&quot;, which became a commercial breakthrough. In an interview after the release of their fourth album, Suffa revealed that &quot;The Calling&quot; was recorded on his mother&#x27;s computer and the simplicity of their &#x27;studio&#x27; is the reason why some of the music on the album is in monaural (&#x27;mono&#x27;) sound.

&quot;The Calling&quot; entered the ARIA Albums Chart in March 2004 and reached No. 53 before exiting the top 100 in September of the same year. By December 2006 it was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 units, becoming the first Australian hip hop album to achieve platinum status. In March 2012, it re-entered the chart and peaked at No. 50 – eight-and-a-half years after its first release. It featured two singles, &quot;The Nosebleed Section&quot; and &quot;Dumb Enough&quot;, which were listed in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2003. &quot;The Nosebleed Section&quot; was ranked No. 17 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time in 2009. Hilltop Hoods&#x27; chart and commercial success was a turning point in the Australian Hip Hop scene because it demonstrated widespread support for the genre that reached beyond an underground fan base.

On 1 April 2006, the group followed with their fourth album, &quot;The Hard Road&quot;, which peaked at number one. It was the first Australian hip hop album to do so. It was certified gold within a week of being released. Its lead single, &quot;Clown Prince&quot;, reached the top 30 on the related ARIA Singles Chart. It featured guest verses from New York rapper, Omni, and British MCs, Mystro and Braintax. The Hilltop Hoods received the inaugural Australian Independent Record (AIR) Award for Independent Artist of the Year and Best Performing Independent Album for &quot;The Hard Road&quot; in 2006. The track, &quot;The Blue Blooded&quot;, is a collaboration with Australian MCs: Funkoars, Hau from Koolism, Mortar, Vents, Drapht, Muph &amp; Plutonic, Pegz and Robby Balboa. On 27 April of the same year, Hilltop Hoods performed at the Bass in the Grass music festival in Darwin alongside fellow hip hop group, The Herd. That same day they issued a second single, the title track from the album. Its video includes fellow members from the Certified Wise Crew – Cross Bred Mongrels, Terrafirma and Funkoars.

Following the success of The Hard Road Tour in early 2006, the Hilltop Hoods began their second national tour for the year, The Stopping All Stations Tour, which visited more regional areas of Australia as well as the capital cities. They were supported by Koolism and Mystro. Late that year, Hilltop Hoods released their third single from the album, &quot;What a Great Night&quot;. The video shows the group at a club with camera shots panning up and down to reveal a new location. It used special effects and is one of the most expensive video clips for an Australian hip hop group, mirroring the group&#x27;s rise in success and popularity. Also late in the year the band won the J Award for best album of the year from Triple J. They performed the Homebake Festival and Falls Festival before the end of the year. &quot;The Hard Road&quot; received the AIR Award for Best Independent Hip Hop/Urban Release in 2007.

===2007–2009: &quot;The Hard Road Restrung&quot; and &quot;State of the Art&quot;===
On 12 May 2007, Hilltop Hoods released their next album &quot;The Hard Road: Restrung&quot; which is a remix of their previous studio album, &quot;The Hard Road&quot;, featuring the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra and Okwerdz. It peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Like its predecessor &quot;The Hard Road&quot;, it took out &quot;Best Urban Release&quot; at the ARIA Awards of 2007, with the group going back-to-back in the category. The lead single from the album &quot;Recapturing the Vibe Restrung&quot;, its video clip was on high rotation on rage and jtv. That year the group performed at the Southbound Festival (WA), The Great Escape at Newington Armory over Easter, and embarked on a UK tour with a Sydney-based string quartet. They finished the year by headlining the Pyramid Rock Festival on Victoria&#x27;s Phillip Island over New Year&#x27;s Eve 2007. In 2008 they performed at the Big Day Out festivals, at Glastonbury Festival and Islington Academy in London. In December their DVD, &quot;The City of Light&quot;, was released and was nominated as Best Music DVD at the 2008 ARIA Awards.
Hilltop Hoods left their longtime home of Obese Records to start their own label, Golden Era Records, to release their future material. In November 2008 Pressure announced on Triple J&#x27;s breakfast program that the next studio album, &quot;State of the Art&quot;, would be recorded with session musicians: &quot;We realised with this one after doing Restrung and having an orchestra that we were a bit less limited. So we&#x27;re going to have some session musos come in on this one and stuff like that&quot;. The album was released on 12 June, with the lead single, &quot;Chase That Feeling&quot;, issued as a digital download on 8 May, and featured a return guest appearance by a quartet from the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra. The album debuted at number one on the albums chart while &quot;Chase That Feeling&quot; peaked at No. 8 on the related singles chart. By 2010 &quot;State of the Art&quot; was certified 2× platinum for shipment of 140,000 units.

In early 2009 the Hilltop Hoods performed at the Groovin the Moo festival in Townsville, Maitland and Bendigo. They also performed at Triple J&#x27;s One Night Stand in Sale, Victoria on 30 May, and at Fat as Butter festival in Newcastle on 25 October where they played several of the tracks from the album. To promote its release the band started a national tour starting on 18 July and performed at most major cities including state capitals. The second national tour that year followed on 11 November with support provided by Vents.

===2010–2017: &quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot; and &quot;Walking Under Stars&quot;===
On 28 July 2010, Hilltop Hoods completed work on a zombie movie, &quot;Parade of the Dead&quot;, that the group wrote, filmed, and starred in. Using the title from a &quot;State of the Art&quot; track, it was released on 22 October with the eponymous single. Filmed mostly in Adelaide, the former Adelaide Gaol was used as a &quot;key location&quot;.

In late November 2011, the band premiered the single, &quot;I Love It&quot;, on the Triple J breakfast show. Featuring Sia, the song peaked at No. 6 on the ARIA chart and was the lead single from their sixth album, &quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot;, which was released on 9 March 2012. During December 2011, they supported Eminem and Lil Wayne during the Australian leg of Eminem&#x27;s world tour. The song has since been certified 4× Platinum by ARIA, denoting sales of more than 280,000 units.

Three music videos for &quot;I Love It&quot; were published online in December 2011 by DJ Debris. Three versions were commissioned by the band, involving three different directors: Nash Edgerton of Blue Tongue Films; the Animal Logic animation company; and independent Melbourne, Australia, film-maker Carl Allison.

In January 2012, the group &quot;leaked&quot; a song from the sixth album following the emergence of interest on their Facebook page: &quot;Let&#x27;s have some fun. If we get 5000 likes on this post we&#x27;re going to leak a track off &quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot;&quot;—they received more than 7,500 likes within 10 minutes. Surprised with the magnitude of the response, the band subsequently posted: &quot;Wow. Give me a minute.&quot; and posted a link to a new track, &quot;Rattling the Keys to the Kingdom&quot;, on YouTube shortly afterward. &quot;Rattling the Keys to the Kingdom&quot; was certified Gold by ARIA in 2018.

&quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot; became their third number-one album in Australia and also charted on the New Zealand Albums Chart top 40. In mid-April 2012, the music video for &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, was published online. Directed by Toby Grimes, the video features Chali 2na and graffiti murals from Brisbane, Australia, artist Sofles.

On 10 May 2012, Hilltop Hoods issued a new EP, &quot;The Good Life in the Sun&quot;, to celebrate the launch of the &#x27;Speaking in Tongues Tour&#x27;, which includes tracks from &quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot; remixed by Suffa. The post contained a link to their website where the EP can be downloaded for free. In July 2012, the video for the third single, &quot;Shredding the Balloon&quot;, was published on the band&#x27;s YouTube channel. Directed by Selina Miles of Unity Sound and Visual, the video had received nearly 1.5 million views as of 1 October 2014. The single was released on 20 July 2012.

In August 2012, Triple J uploaded video footage of the group&#x27;s tribute to Beastie Boys&#x27; member, Adam &quot;MCA&quot; Yauch, who died in May 2012. The group selected &quot;So What&#x27;cha Want&quot;, from Beastie Boys&#x27; album, &quot;Check Your Head&quot;.

In late September, the music video for &quot;Rattling the Keys to the Kingdom&quot; was published online. It featured numerous Australian hip-hop artists, including Drapht, Urthboy, Def Wish Cast, Dazastah, Layla, Maya Jupiter and Hunter. The band explained in the production notes for the video:
Not only did we want to do something unifying, we also wanted to use the platform we have to promote artists that we think deserve more exposure. Of course, not everyone involved in the filmclip needs exposure, as many of the artists involved have huge followings in their own right. But having these artists involved in the filmclip just further serves to unify and consolidate the scene ... We need to point out that this is by no means a representation of every relevant artist involved in the culture past or present. It&#x27;s more a cross-section of who we have contact with, who was available and so on.

In November 2012, Hilltop Hoods performed a live show on UStream and announced that the title of the group&#x27;s next album would be &quot;Walking Under Stars&quot;—this was then confirmed on the official Hilltop Hoods Twitter and Facebook pages, following their Best Urban Album win at the 2012 ARIA Awards ceremony. The band&#x27;s Facebook post read:
So it&#x27;s now one year to the day since we dropped &#x27;I Love It&#x27; and started the &#x27;Drinking from the Sun&#x27; journey. Thanks to everyone that&#x27;s supported us over the last 12 months, it&#x27;s been amazing. We hope you join us late next year for &#x27;Walking Under Stars&#x27;. Thankyou, Suffa, Pressure &amp; Debris

The announcement corresponds with a sample on &quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot; that refers to a band writing with the clear intention of formulating enough material for two albums: &quot;They were recording enough for two albums; that was premeditated.&quot; The sample appears on the track, &quot;The Thirst Pt. 3 (Interlude)&quot;.

In April 2013, the Hilltop Hoods stated that the development of &quot;Walking Under Stars&quot; was &quot;well underway&quot;, with the trio calling the album &quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot; &quot;part two&quot;—the latter received a double platinum sales certification in the same month. Additionally, American clothing company Zoo York announced a partnership with the Hilltop Hoods in April 2013, in preparation for the brand&#x27;s 20th-anniversary celebrations in 2014. Lambert explained: &quot;We&#x27;ve always been fans of Zoo York, they understand hip hop culture, and that&#x27;s why we can&#x27;t wait to work with them.&quot;

On 21 June 2014—after the band successfully received the 20,000 likes they requested for a Facebook post—the first preview of &quot;Walking Under Stars&quot;, titled &quot;The Art of the Handshake&quot;, was uploaded to the band&#x27;s SoundCloud profile—the song is the fourth on the album&#x27;s track-list. Lambert revealed on 6 August that the song was inspired by the Notes to Self song &quot;All of the Above&quot;, which reminded him of &quot;the ridiculous handshakes&quot; of his youth. As part of the songwriting process, Lambert spent a day researching the status of the handshake in countries such as Sweden and India.

The album&#x27;s first official single, &quot;Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot;—featuring Irish singer Maverick Sabre—was released on 27 June 2014. Writing for the Faster Louder website, Matt Shea revealed in early August that the first single was met with a mixed reaction from existing fans of the band: &quot;While many loved it, plenty of Hoods fans at the very least declared it a radio friendly single that had little to do with hip-hop. Others outright disliked it.&quot; Lambert explained in media interviews during the week prior to the album&#x27;s release that the song was recorded at the Red Bull Studios in both London, UK and New York City, US, while the lyrical content is about the partners of the band members and the difficulties of being in a relationship with touring musicians. The single&#x27;s musical content features Italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari singing a rendition of Ph.D&#x27;s hit &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot;.

During the band&#x27;s performance at the 2014 Splendour in the Grass festival, held from 25 to 27 July in Byron Bay, Australia, Lambert exclaimed to the audience prior to the song &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;, from the &quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot; album:
The Hilltop Hoods do not give a fuck what race you are! The Hilltop Hoods do not give a fuck what religion you are! The Hilltop Hoods do not give a fuck what sex you are! The Hilltop Hoods do not give a fuck what sexuality you are! We are one people under the music!

Lambert explained that his announcement, a reaffirmation of the sentiment in &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;, is &quot;very important&quot; to the band.

The band announced the release date for &quot;Walking Under Stars&quot; as 8 August 2014 in mid-July and, while the album is a Golden Era Records recording, Universal Music Australia acquired the exclusive licensing rights for the domestic market—Universal will also use the license to distribute the album in Canada, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Benelux, while Golden Era continues its partnership with Fontana for the US release. &quot;Walking Under Stars&quot; was conceived before &quot;Drinking From the Sun&quot; was written and Lambert referred to the former as &quot;a companion piece&quot; in an August 2014 interview. Lambert also explained that &quot;I&#x27;m a Ghost&quot; is four-years-old, while a segment of &quot;Brainbox&quot; originally appeared on the 2012 Golden Era mixtape.

Similar to the band&#x27;s previous album releases, numerous collaborators appear on &quot;Walking Under Stars&quot;. Lambert explained on 5 August that &quot;we [Hilltop Hoods] try to do it in the same room&quot; when guest artists record and, for the seventh studio album, the band worked with Sabre, New Zealand soul singer Aaradhna, Brother Ali, Dan Sultan, Drapht, Canadian voice-over artist Dave Pettitt and One Above, the Adelaide producer who also worked on &quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot;. Lambert explained to TheMusic.com.au website that Sultan is a &quot;gifted&quot; artist who the band loves &quot;as a person as well&quot;, and &quot;it was really good to work with [Brother] Ali, who&#x27;s an artist that we admire so much.&quot;

&quot;Walking Under Stars&quot; debuted in the number-one position of the ARIA album charts during the week beginning 11 August 2014, providing the band with their fourth chart-topping album since &quot;The Hard Road&quot; in April 2006. As of 16 August 2014, the Hilltop Hoods have garnered a total of six weeks at the top of the ARIA charts from four number-one albums, three of which are Golden Era Records releases. During the promotion for a national Australian tour in late August 2014, the band revealed that a secret release will &quot;manifest itself&quot; in 2015 and will be the culmination of a multi-album creative project that began with &quot;Drinking From The Sun&quot;.

&quot;Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot; was performed live on the Australian &quot;AFL Footy Show&quot; television program on 7 August 2014, during an episode that was filmed in Adelaide. The music video for &quot;Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot; was published on the Hilltop Hoods YouTube channel on 19 August 2014. Directed by Richard Coburn of the Kojo production company, the video features a narrative in which manufactured pigs heads are used.

The music video for the &quot;Cosby Sweater&quot; single was released on the Hilltop Hoods YouTube channel while the group was engaged in the third stage of their 2014 world tour in North America. Published on 15 September, the video was again directed by Coburn and also features Golden Era artists Briggs, K21 and Trials. The single became the group&#x27;s first top 5 ARIA single on 15 November 2014, during the fourth, Australian stage of the world tour, on the same date as the group&#x27;s Melbourne performance at the Rod Laver Arena. &quot;Cosby Sweater&quot; was also performed at the 28th ARIA Awards ceremony on 26 November 2014, where the band also won the Best Urban Album award.

On 30 April 2016, Hilltop Hoods performed their final concert of the &#x27;Drinking from the Sun, Walking Under the Stars&#x27; at Perth Arena.I

===2018–present: &quot;The Great Expanse&quot;===
On 13 July 2018, Hilltop Hoods released single &quot;Clark Griswold&quot; with Adrian Eagle, an ode to the character from the &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; movies.

On 23 November 2018, Hilltop Hoods released the single &quot;Leave Me Lonely&quot; and announced their forthcoming 2019 album &quot;The Great Expanse&quot;. The album, which features platinum single &quot;Leave Me Lonely,&quot; gold selling ARIA Award-winning single &quot;Clark Griswold&quot; ft. Adrian Eagle, and new single &quot;Exit Sign&quot; ft. Illy and Ecca Vandal, was released on 22 February 2019 and debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Charts. The chart debut made it the group&#x27;s sixth number one, setting a new ARIA record for most No. 1 Albums by an Australian band or group.

In March 2022, the Hilltop Hoods have released a new single with US soul singer Eamon &quot;Show Business&quot;.

On 15 May 2022, Hilltop Hoods celebrated the 15th anniversary of &quot;The Hard Road Restrung&quot; with a post on their official Facebook &amp; Instagram pages, and announced they were working on a third installment in their &#x27;restrung&#x27; releases, following &quot;The Hard Road Restrung&quot; (2007) and &quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot; and &quot;Walking Under Stars Restrung&quot; (2016). Accompanying photos of both of their previous restrung album covers, was an image containing songs for the third installment.

In 2022, Hilltop Hoods reunited with Montaigne and Tom Thum and released the song &quot;A Whole Day&#x27;s Night&quot; on 26 August 2022.

==Touring==
Hilltop Hoods have toured both in Australia and overseas, including playing at music festivals: T in the Park, Oxegen, the Big Day Out, Adelaide 500, Southbound, The Great Escape, Splendour in the Grass, Bassinthegrass, Groovin&#x27; The Moo, Falls Festival, Pyramid Rock Festival, Rollercoaster, Come Together Festival and Make Poverty History.

On 8 December 2012, the Hilltop Hoods were one of two headlines acts (the other was American band, Blondie) for the 2012 &quot;Global Edition&quot; of the popular Australian music, film, comedy and arts festival, Homebake.

A North American &quot;Drinking From The Sun&quot; tour was announced in late February 2013 and the band revealed that it would perform in American cities such as Seattle (the tour&#x27;s debut location), New York and San Francisco, and the Canadian cities, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary and Toronto; the tour was scheduled to end in Los Angeles on 9 May 2013. However, on 23 February 2013, the hip hop group announced the indefinite postponement of the entire tour due to a &quot;serious family matter&quot;. The Hilltop Hoods were also one of the bands on the &quot;Concerts&quot; roster for the V8 Clipsal 500 Adelaide car racing event, held between 28 February 2013 and 3 March 2013—other Australian hip hop artists, such as Drapht and Vents, also performed at the event.

The group performed at the 2014 occurrence of the Australian festival Splendour in the Grass, performing alongside other musicians, such as Illy, Outkast, and Lily Allen. The band announced an August–September 2014 North American tour in June 2014—including dates in Vancouver and Toronto, Canada, and San Francisco, US—with Minnesota, US, artist Sims, from Doomtree.

In late August 2014, the &quot;Cosby Sweater Australian Tour&quot; was announced in support of the &quot;Walking Under Stars&quot; album release. The domestic tour run from October to December 2014, and the support acts were Thundamentals and K21.

In February 2019, the group supported Eminem&#x27;s concert tour around Australia and New Zealand, performing to audiences in venues such as ANZ Stadium in Sydney and the MCG in Melbourne.

===ARIA Awards===
In 2006 Hilltop Hoods were nominated for five ARIA Awards – the first ever for an Australian hip hop group – winning in two categories: &#x27;Best Urban Release&#x27; and &#x27;Best Independent Release&#x27;. The following year they won &#x27;Best Urban Release&#x27; at the ARIA Awards for &quot;The Hard Road: Restrung&quot;. The album was also nominated for &#x27;Best Independent Release&#x27; and &#x27;Best Cover Art&#x27; by John Engelhardt. The DVD &quot;City of Light&quot; was nominated as &#x27;Best Music DVD&#x27; at the 2008 ARIA awards. At the 2009 ARIA Awards they won &#x27;Best Urban Album&#x27; for a third time – for &quot;State of the Art&quot; and DJ Debris won an award for &#x27;Engineer of the Year&#x27; for his work on that album. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2012, Hilltop Hoods won its fourth award in the &#x27;Best Urban Album&#x27; category for &quot;Drinking from the Sun&quot;; as of November 2012, the group has won six awards from twenty nominations.

At the 2012 ARIA Awards, established Aboriginal Australian band, Yothu Yindu, was inducted into the Hall of Fame. A photograph of Suffa holding the award in the presence of the band was posted on the Hilltop Hoods&#x27; Instagram profile, accompanied by the following comment: &quot;A memory I&#x27;ll take to the grave. Meeting Yothu Yindi and having them let me hold their Hall of Fame ARIA. What a beautiful induction.&quot;

The band was nominated in three ARIA categories in 2014: Best Group, Best Urban Album, and Engineer of the Year. In an October 2014 radio interview, Smith said that the band does not expect to win an award, but wishes the best for the winners; however, the Best Urban Album award was given to the band on 26 November 2014, providing the band with their seventh ARIA award. As from November 2020 they have won ten awards from thirty-six nominations.

===Hilltop Hoods Initiative===
In 2005 the annual &quot;Hilltop Hoods Initiative&quot; was established in association with Arts SA, made possible by a donation from the Hilltop Hoods. Valued at A$10,000 (originally $3000), the Hilltop Hoods initiative helped young and emerging South Australian hip-hop artists to manufacture and distribute a CD. The initiative also included two mentorship sessions with Hilltop Hoods&#x27; former manager, PJ Murton. It acknowledges the important role South Australian government assistance played in the development of the careers of the Hilltop Hoods. In 2009, the initiative became a national grant available to entry for any emerging Australian hip-hop artist who have not issued a professional album.

In a Hilltop Hoods newsletter, released on 4 December 2012, the group communicated the following announcement:
In 2013 The Hilltop Hoods and APRA are teaming up again to give a career changing $10K to the most impressive emerging Hip Hop/Soul act in Australia. Aimed at helping fund the manufacturing and marketing of an album release, the grant is open to any act who hasn&#x27;t yet released anything professionally. Applications will open in early 2013 along with details on how to enter.
Recipients are:
* General Knowledge, a three-piece group (2006)
* Subsketch, a solo artist (2007)
* Jimblah, a solo artist (2008)
* K21, a solo artist (2009)

===Hilltop Hoods Remix Shoe===
The Hilltop Hoods and DC Shoes collaborated on the production of a limited-edition shoe called &quot;The Hilltop Hoods Remix Shoe&quot;—it was released in stores on 1 February 2008. They are the first Australian music group to design and release their own signature-model shoe. Illustration and Design by John Engelhardt injected its unique style

===Golden Era Records===
Following its departure from the Obese record label, the group launched its own label in 2009, entitled Golden Era Records. The label&#x27;s title is described by the band on the label website:
To some people the golden era of Hip Hop was &#x27;94. Ask someone a little older and they&#x27;ll tell you Hip Hop&#x27;s renaissance was back in &#x27;88. Ask one of our revered pioneers and they&#x27;ll tell you that the golden era came and went three decades ago, before most of today&#x27;s Hip Hop heads were born. Whatever the case these so-called golden eras weren&#x27;t only defined by the music or the fashion – they were characterised by something less tangible – an atmosphere, a movement.

This label wasn&#x27;t established to release throw-back records; instead we hope to make music that throws you back to the way you felt during the golden era of Hip Hop.

Whatever year that was for you.

The label is based in Stirling, South Australia, and, as of December 2012, its roster consists of the Hilltop Hoods, Briggs, Funkoars, Vents, Adfu, K21, and most recently, Shadow.

In January 2012, Fontana, an independent marketing, sales and distribution company under the Universal Music Group umbrella, signed an exclusive agreement with Golden Era Records for the American release of &quot;Drinking From The Sun&quot;, as well as back catalogue titles.

===Charity===
The CanTeen youth cancer charity announced that the 2-CD fundraising album &quot;Australian Hip Hop Supports CanTeen&quot; had raised over AU$122,000 as of 15 October 2014. Released in late 2013, the album features contributions from Hilltop Hoods, as well as numerous other Australian hip-hop artists. The initiative was originally conceived of by Robert Hunter, an MC who rapped under the name &quot;Hunter&quot; (SBX), who died from cancer prior to the release of the album.

===Through the Dark interactive film===
On 11 November 2016 Hilltop Hoods released an interactive film called &quot;Through the Dark&quot;, which featured their song of the same name. The interactive film project was a collaboration with Google Play Music and was directed by Mike Daly.

<text>Adolf Østbye (February 1868 – September 5, 1907) was a Norwegian revue artist and barber who became the first person to make a recording in Norway. The earliest playable Norwegian phonograph cylinder dates from 1889.

During the years 1889–1904, Østbye made a series of cylinders, announced &quot;Østbye Record&quot;. Several of these are made with cooperation with the Norwegian Pathé manager, William Farre.

==The first recording in Norway==
In December 1904, Østbye became the first to make a gramophone record in Norway. The record was &quot;Parodi paa Terje Vigen&quot;. Edvard Grieg (1843–1907), had made nine records in Paris during the spring of 1903. 
Østbye&#x27;s Norwegian recording sessions were held at the Grand Hotel, Kristiania.

Østbye recorded several cylinders and gramophone records. He mainly recorded for Pathé and The Gramophone Company (HMV) – whose masters were released as Victor records in the US, as well as Columbia cylinders and records. Many of these sold very well, and the most popular title &quot;Bal i Hallingdal&quot; together with Carl Mathisen (September 25, 1870 Holmsbu, Norway – 1933 Ray, North Dakota, US) at accordion remained in the HMV catalogues until the late 1930s.

Østbye also began to start up his own record company, &quot;Ekko - Kristiania&quot; during 1906–07. These plans were cut short by his illness in 1907. Only two Ekko records are reported to exist today. These records seem to be earlier Pathé and &quot;Østbyes record&quot;s that have been transferred. The reason for this might be that Østbye, at the time, was too ill to record &quot;live&quot;. He died in Kristiania (Oslo), aged 39.

On several record labels, Østbye&#x27;s last name has also been spelled: Östby(e), Østby(e) and Ostby(e).

<text>The Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry was a yeomanry regiment of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Territorial Army. It served in the armoured replacement role, providing replacement tank crews for regular armoured regiments.

==History==
The regiment was formed in November 1992 by the amalgamation of The Queen&#x27;s Own Mercian Yeomanry and The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Own Yeomanry as part of the Options for Change. In 1999, it absorbed a squadron from The Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry, bringing it to a strength of four squadrons plus the headquarters squadron.

In October 2006, the RMLY became a single cap badge regiment, when the individual cap badges of each squadron were replaced by the newly designed RMLY cap badge. This incorporated the Mercian Eagle from the Queen&#x27;s Own Mercian Yeomanry with the Red Rose from the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Own Yeomanry. This was also the point at which H-Det joined the regiment, to provide a Recce troop. H-Detachment was renamed Manoeuvre and Support Squadron in 2011, when it was given Squadron status; it still consisted of the Recce troop, but now also housed the &quot;hoop&quot; (communications for the squadron).

In July 2013, it was announced that the RMLY would be restructured under the Army 2020 plan. A Squadron and B Squadron resubordinated to The Royal Yeomanry, while C Squadron and D Squadron resubordinated to The Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry. The regiment was disbanded in April 2014.

==Organisation==
The RMLY consisted of a Recce Troop, a Command Troop (within the detachment based in Hereford) and four sabre squadrons. Each of the sabre squadrons perpetuates a historic Yeomanry regiment, which is reflected in their subtitles:

*A (Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry) Squadron
*B (Shropshire Yeomanry) Squadron
*C (Cheshire Yeomanry) Squadron
*D (Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Own Yeomanry) Squadron
* Manoeuvre and Support Squadron (Hereford) - The Herefordshire (Light Infantry) Squadron

<text>Leung Jan (born Leung Tak-wing; 1826–1901) was a Chinese martial artist and Wing Chun practitioner from Heshan, Guangdong. He was known in Foshan as &quot;Mr. Jan of Foshan&quot; and &quot;King of Wing Chun Kuen&quot;.

Leung Jan is one of the earliest well-documented practitioners of Wing Chun, which was mainly passed down verbally from teacher to student prior to Leung Jan.

==Background==
Leung Jan was born Leung Tak-wing in 1826 in Heshan, Guangdong. He had an elder brother, Leung Tak-nam, who would later become a successful businessman. His father later moved to Kuai Zi, Foshan and there Leung helped run a traditional Chinese medicine Dit Da clinic. At the age of 18, he was trained by Leung Yee-tai in Southern Shaolin skills. Yee-tai later introduced Jan to his partner Wong Wah-bo, who was also a Gulao (古勞) resident like Jan. Wong taught Jan the entire Wing Chun skill set.

From 1870 onwards, under the nickname Leung Jan, he succeed his father medical business and work within the Wing Sang Tong (榮生堂), also known as Jan Sang Tong, in Foshan and would occasionally take in students to train them in Wing Chun privately. His name eventually became well known due to his wins in competitive bouts and he was respected by other martial artists. He was called &quot;Mr. Jan of Foshan&quot; (佛山贊先生). He later became a government official and was known as &quot;King of Wing Chun Kuen&quot; (詠春拳王). His training and medical hall was looked after by his student Lee Wah (李華), nicknamed Woodman Wah (木人華).

==Personal life==
Leung had three wives, nine sons and eight daughters. His first wife Ms. Wong (黃氏), bore him no children. His second wife Ms. Cheng (鄭氏), bore him seven sons. His third wife Ms. Poon (潘氏), bore him two sons.

His nine sons were:
* 1st: Leung Yuen-fuk (梁元福), courtesy name Yan-wah (恩華) – with Ms. Poon, learned Wing Chun from his father, and on later years went to Vietnam with him to do business there, he had a son, and died at the age of 24.
* 2nd: Leung Bik-wo (梁璧和), courtesy name Tai-wah (態華) – with Ms. Cheng, born in 1845, learned Wing Chun from his father and grand-teacher Wong Wah-bo, later moved to Hong Kong with a friend to set up a clothing business there. He had two sons. He further trained Ip Man in 1909 and died in 1911 at the age of 65.
* 3rd: Leung Chi-yin (梁賜賢), courtesy name Hin-wah (憲華) – with Ms. Poon, he had no children.
* 4th: Leung Yu-chun (梁遇春), courtesy name Mou-wah (懋華) – with Ms. Cheng, born during the Tongzhi period in Year 9, April 12, he was more verse into his father&#x27;s medical practices and medical ethics, but later switched to business, he had six sons and three daughters and died at age 54.
* 5th: Leung Chung-wah (梁忠華) – with Ms. Cheng, died prematurely.
* 6th: Leung Shu-wah (梁恕華) – with Ms. Cheng, died prematurely.
* 7th: Leung Ko-peng (梁高明), courtesy name Yue-wah (愈華) – with Ms. Cheng, born during the Tongzhi period, year of Wuchen, he had two sons.
* 8th: Leung Nim-wah (梁念華) – with Ms. Cheng, died prematurely.
* 9th: Leung Pak-jau (梁百就), courtesy name Sai-wun (世煥) – with Ms. Cheng, due to death of his mother, he was supposed to be sent to a wet nurse for breast-feeding, however along the way he was abducted and was sold to a new family.

There is currently no available historical information on any of Leung&#x27;s eight daughters.

==Later life and death==
In 1888, his physical health began to decline and his five remaining sons had since left Foshan to make a living and they had no intention to take over his training and medical hall. Notably, Leung Yuen moved to Vietnam, while Leung Bik moved to Hong Kong.

While searching for a successor, Leung took in a money changer Chan Wah-shun as his student. Leung later often went back and forth between Foshan and his hometown Gulao Village, and Chan continued to be trained by Lee. Leung also taught Chan in Dit Da. Chan eventually closed his money changing business and helped run a Dit Da clinic.

After the death of Lee Wah on the following year in 1889, Chan took over the operations of the training and medical hall, while Leung continued to go back and forth between Foshan and Gulao. Wing Sang Tong was later renamed to Hang Chai Tong (杏濟堂).

Around the age of 70, Leung retired permanently back to his hometown, there he taught a group of four youths, including his nephew Wong Wah-sum, a modified form of Wing Chun which focused on side-facing positions (known as Kulo village Pin Sun Wing Chun in present day). Leung died in 1901.

== Lineage ==
==In popular culture==
In the 1978 film &quot;Descendants of Wing Chun&quot;, he was portrayed by Melvin Wong.

He was portrayed by Bryan Leung in the 1978 film &quot;Warriors Two&quot; as the master role as a more disciplined and older man. He takes up the student Chan Wah-shun alongside a few other ones he is already training, but is caught up in an elaborate scheme by Foshan&#x27;s new mayor. The mayor plans to remove all top martial artists from the town, so he may rule with an iron fist. Putting both Cashier Wah (Chan Wah-shun), and Leung Jan himself on the mayor&#x27;s hit list.

In the 1981 TVB television drama series &quot;Kung Fu Master of Fat Shan&quot;, he was portrayed by Kwan Hoi-san.

Leung Jan, as an already somewhat skilled martial artist, is featured in a student role in the 1981 film &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;. In this fictional tale of his life, Yuen Biao as Leung Jan, is a young man determined to learn real martial arts after a humiliating defeat by undercover Wing Chun master Leung Yee-tai who is a seemingly harmless man, despite Leung Jan being known as Foshan&#x27;s &quot;kung fu king&quot;.

Leung was portrayed by Yuen Biao again in the Hong Kong TV series &quot;Real Kung Fu&quot;, which aired on TVB in 2005, along with &quot;Wing Chun&quot; a year later or two from 2006 to 2007.

<text>The Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry (QOY) is one of the Army Reserve light armoured reconnaissance regiments.

==History==
The Queens Own Yeomanry was initially formed on 1 April 1971 as the 2nd Armoured Car Regiment from five of the yeomanry units across the North and Middle of England and South West Scotland. During the Cold War The Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry was a British Army of the Rhine Regiment with an Armoured Reconnaissance role in Germany. With the Strategic Defence Review in 1999 the geographical locations of the regiment changed to encompass East Scotland and Northern Ireland. Soldiers from the regiment have served both in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Under Army 2020, three squadrons transferred to the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry and it gained two squadrons from the Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry. The unit is paired with the Light Dragoons and uses the Jackal 1.

==Recruitment==
The regiment recruits its soldiers mainly from the following counties: Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, County Durham, Lancashire, Cheshire, Northumberland and Merseyside.

==Organisation==
The Regiment is part of 19th Infantry Brigade. It is part of the Royal Armoured Corps and consists of four squadrons:
* A (Yorkshire Yeomanry) Squadron
* B (The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Own Yeomanry) Squadron
* C (Cheshire Yeomanry (The Earl of Chester&#x27;s)) Squadron
* D (Northumberland Hussars) Squadron

==Order of precedence==
For the purposes of parading, the Regiments of the British Army are listed according to an order of precedence. This is the order in which the various corps of the army parade, from right to left, with the unit at the extreme right being the most senior.

==Guidon==
The Guidon, which is awarded by The Queen, is a flag of crimson silk damask embroidered and fringed with gold with the Regimental Battle Honours emblazoned upon it and the Regimental emblem embroidered in the centre. On 22 September 2007 Prince Charles, in his capacity as Royal Honorary Colonel of The Queen&#x27;s Own Yeomanry, presented a new Guidon to the Regiment in an hour-long ceremony in the grounds of Alnwick Castle. This was the first Guidon the QOY has received since its formation.

==Armoured Vehicles==
In late 2013, with the phasing out of CVR(T) across the British Army, the regiment was re-equipped with the Land Rover Defender-based RWMIK, a light armoured vehicle, equipped with the General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG) and the Browning .50 Heavy Machine Gun (HMG), as well as individual BOWMAN digital battlefield communications systems and specialised surveillance optics, including thermal imaging. In 2018 the regiment re-equipped with Jackal 1&#x27;s to harmonise vehicles with its sister regiment, The Light Dragoons.

==Uniform==

===Badges===

The whole Regiment wears a variation of the running fox cap badge of the old East Riding Yeomanry. However, each of the Squadrons wears its own collar badges and buttons.

===Stable Belt and Shoulder Flash===
The Regimental Stable Belt or shoulder flashes are worn to show a soldier or officer is serving with the QOY in various forms of dress. The colour of both is Prussian blue with two horizontal stripes of cavalry gold (yellow): 



==Lineage==
==Freedoms==
The regiment has received the Freedom of several locations throughout its history; these include:
* 1971: Newcastle upon Tyne (Originally Granted to the Northumberland Hussars on 8 January 1969).
* 3 December 2009: York.
* 3 May 2014: South Ayrshire.
* 12 October 2019: On 12 October 2019, C (The Duke of Chester&#x27;s Cheshire Hussars (Yeomanry)) Squadron was granted the freedom of the city of Chester following the 225th anniversary of the yeomanry and 80th anniversary of the Royal Armoured Corps. The squadron was last awarded the honour in 1996 and their bi-centenary in 1997.

<text>is a type of pickled daikon popular in Tokyo, a sort of tsukemono. It is made by pickling daikon with sugar, salt, and sake without filtering koji. The name &quot;bettarazuke&quot; is taken from the stickiness of koji left over from the pickling process. Bettarazuke has a crisp sweet taste.
Bettarazuke has similar figure to takuan, but bettarazuke contains a lot of moisture because it doesn&#x27;t need sun-drying process.

On the night of every October 19 in the area around Takarada Ebisu shrine, &quot;Bettara Ichi&quot; (literally, &quot;bettara fair&quot;) is held to sell the year&#x27;s freshly pickled bettarazuke.

<text>The little village of Santa Marina del Sil is situated by the river Sil, 7 km from the town of Congosto in Spain, and 15 km from the town of Ponferrada, in the province of León, in Spain. Its name refers to Saint Marina.

The village has 85 inhabitants and is located near the Sil river, a tributary of the river Miño.

It is well known for the summer party of La Carpa, during July. This is a famous fishing contest held on the river very near the village. An inhabitant of the village, Angel González, was the founder of the CIT (Centro de Iniciativas Turísticas, Touristic Initiative Center), that organizes the contest.

The inhabitants of the town are traditionally employed in coal mining and chestnut harvesting. By now most of them are working in the town of Ponferrada, Toreno, or are retired.

<text>Hermannus Jantinus van Veen (born 14 March 1945) is a Dutch stage performer, actor, author, singer-songwriter and musician. He worked with accompanists Laurens van Rooyen and Erik van der Wurff, both of whom were pianists and composers.

In addition to performing internationally, Van Veen is famous as the creator of &quot;Alfred J. Kwak&quot; (1976). The original one-man theatre show was adapted as a Dutch-German-Japanese cartoon (1989), which was broadcast internationally. In addition to creating the show&#x27;s story, Van Veen also wrote, composed and performed most of the show&#x27;s music.

He also performed the voice-overs for the characters &quot;Johan Sebastian Kwak&quot;, &quot;Krabnagel de Kater&quot; and &quot;Professor Paljas&quot; (Professor Buffon) in the Dutch and German versions of &quot;Alfred J. Kwak&quot;.

<doc id="1041349" wikidata="Q464826" url="?curid=1041349" title="Matsumaezuke">
<text>is a pickled dish of dried squid and kelp, native to Hokkaidō, Japan, named in reference to the Matsumae clan which once governed the region, then known as Ezo.

It is made from dried and preserved seafood products from Hokkaidō. &quot;Surume&quot; (dried squid) and konbu are cut into thin strips with scissors, &quot;Kazunoko&quot; (herring roe) are broken up into small bits, with other ingredients added depending on recipe. The ingredients are cured in sweet soy sauce, or marinade of sake, soy sauce and mirin, for several days.

==History==

There are conflicting claims as to the evolution of the dish.

According to the publication from the ex-MITI governmental research body (1987), &quot;matsumaezuke&quot; developed naturally within the Matsumae domain in Ezo (Ainu country), among the immigrating wajin populace (non-native mainland Japanese), using dried squid (surume) and kombu kelp, which were the locally abundant trade commodities. It can probably be dated to around the Kansei era (1789-1801), when &quot;kitamae&quot; ships began to bring readily available supplies of soy sauce, etc., into the area. The name &quot;Matsumae zuke&quot; did not originate then, and the dish was simply called or . The &quot;Matsumaezuke&quot; nickname was coined in the Shōwa era, and though originally a squid and kelp only preserve, a type adding &quot;kazunoko&quot; (herring roe) began to circulate around Showa 3 (1929).

The same government research body in earlier published books provided a different account, stating that the &quot;matsumaezuke&quot;, &quot;as a &quot;chinmi&quot; whose recipe was held as secret &#x27;not to leave its gates&#x27;, was endeared to the successive daimyo lords of the Matsumae feudal clan&quot;.

Alternately, Yamagata-ya of Hakodate which lays claim to &quot;matsumae zuke&quot; explains that this was something &quot;made at home in the southern Hokkaido region, as a salted pickle overnight&quot;, but the company founder changed it to a soy sauce pickling recipe and marketed as a product in Showa 13 (1938). The item would eventually gain name recognition nationwide. 

In the 1950s, Japan&#x27;s herring fisheries collapsed, and with the scarcity, and by the mid 1960s and thereafter, &quot;kazunoko&quot; became more of an &quot;expensive delicacy&quot; item nicknamed &quot;yellow diamond&quot;, though it continues to be used.

As for the naming, it has been observed that the Hokkaido produce which is &quot;ma-kombu&quot; (sweet kelp) went by the nickname (or simply ) and consequently this and other dishes which used kelp often had &quot;Matsumae~&quot; prefixed upon its name (e.g. &quot;Matsumaezushi&quot;, &quot;Matumaeni&quot;, &quot;Matsumaemushi&quot;, &quot;Matsumaemaki&quot;).

== Recipe ==
A soy sauce on the sweet-side, or a marinade blending soy sauce with (sweet) mirin are said to be used.

Nowadays, there a Matsumae zuke sets or kits (precut squid and kelp) available for easy preparation, but to create from scratch, below is a home-cooking recipe published in newspaper:

* The kazunoko must be soaked in dilute saltwater beforehand, overnight.
* The dried squid and kombu should be cleaned by sponging off any debris using wet cloth (paper towel dampened with sake), then cut into fine ribbons using kitchen scissors. The kazunoko are broken up into bits before adding. If carrots are used they should be julienned.
* Moisten and soften the cut squid, and blend with other ingredients in a marinade made from sake, soy sauce, and mirin heated to boil and cooled off.
* Keep refrigerated, stirring several times per day. Ready to serve after about 3 days.

Although use of carrots is not universal, some dictionary references list carrot or or daikon radish. {{Refn|Okuyma lists&quot;kelp, dried squid, daikon, kazunoko, yuzu peel&quot; as an ingredient. A &quot;tai&quot; (sea bream, in sashimi form) is sometimes blended.。

In addition to the flavor and texture, the kombu adds a slimy viscosity considered desirable and healthy, and though traditionally high quality &quot;ma-kombu&quot; is to be used a suggested trending alternative is to admix a more {{linktext|mucusy}} species of kelp known as {{illm|Saccharina sculpera|ja|ガゴメコンブ|lt=&quot;gagome&quot;}}.{{efn|This is also sold precut as &quot;kizami kombu&quot; (&quot;gagome&quot; type), or under such trade names as &quot;natto kombu&quot;.}}

<text>The Airport &amp; South Line (numbered T8, coloured green; commonly called the East Hills Line) is a commuter rail service operated by Sydney Trains, connecting the Sydney central business district with the southwestern suburbs via Sydney Airport.

==History==
The T8 traverses several railway lines; the City Circle, Airport Link, East Hills and Main South Lines. The origins of the current train service can be traced back to the opening of the East Hills Line in 1931. The East Hills line was extended to Glenfield in 1987, where it joins the Main South Line. The Airport Line opened in 2000, providing an additional pair of tracks into the city.

The East Hills line was opened in 1931. Electrification only extended as far as Kingsgrove. Services on the non-electrified section were by CPH railmotor, supplemented by through steam trains from Central in peak hours. The section between Kingsgrove and East Hills was opened for electric services on 17 December 1939. Services generally ran all stations from East Hills via Tempe and Sydenham, to the city. Occasional services terminated at Riverwood, Kingsgrove, and Padstow.

When services on the Glenfield extension commenced, there were only limited services from Campbelltown via East Hills during peak hours only; however, in 1988 an all-day half-hourly service was provided. Local (all stations) services generally ran every 15 minutes from East Hills.

Once the Airport Line opened, the running patterns of trains changed. The &quot;flying junctions&quot; near Central Station were altered to give the Airport line its own platforms (21 &amp; 23) at Central. Local (all stations) trains generally were timetabled to run from East Hills via the airport, peak hour express trains from Campbelltown run along the original route via Sydenham, taking newly built express tracks between Kingsgrove and Wolli Creek Junction.

The Airport Line stations (except Wolli Creek) are operated by a private company, the Airport Link Company, as part of a public private partnership (PPP). Under the deal, the private company would cover the costs of building four of the stations. In return, they would operate those stations for 30 years and have the right to impose a surcharge on fares for their use. The company&#x27;s involvement was predicated on passenger estimates and train reliability guarantees that later proved to be optimistic. The NSW Government would fund (and own) the railway itself and Wolli Creek station. The Airport Link consistently failed to meet patronage targets. In 2000, the Airport Link Company went into receivership, exposing the government to costs of around $800 million; it was put up for sale in early 2006. State Rail blamed &quot;lower than expected patronage&quot; and stated it was working with the company to increase it. In October 2005, the government and the company signed a revised agreement on revenue and patronage, settling the latter&#x27;s claims against the former. The stations were purchased by Westpac. In 2009 the business made a profit of A$5.8 million. In 2010 it increased to A$9.3 million. In March 2011 it was announced that the government would cover the cost of the station access fee at Green Square and Mascot stations, meaning that passengers no longer need to pay a surcharge to access these stations. A fee remains in place for Domestic and International stations. Patronage on the link had been growing at 20% per year, but between March and June 2011 patronage increased by 70% as a result of the reduced fares.
The early 2010s saw a shift in how public transport services are delivered in New South Wales. The state government created a new transport authority, Transport for NSW, in 2011. Sydney Trains replaced CityRail as the operator of Sydney&#x27;s commuter rail services in 2013. These changes saw Transport for NSW take control of the timetabling and branding of services. Transport for NSW introduced a new timetable in late 2013 that saw the Airport and East Hills Line replaced by the T2 Airport, Inner West &amp; South Line. This new line was created by combining three of CityRail&#x27;s lines. Operationally, the services between Macarthur and the city via the East Hills and Airport Lines remained much the same as before.

The 2017 timetable saw the 2013 branding changes partially wound back. The T2 line was split in two. The new T2 consists of services from Leppington to the city via Granville, with a branch to Parramatta being added. Services from Macarthur to the city via Sydney Airport or Sydenham were transferred to the new T8 line. The T8 inherited the green colour of the old T2 and the Airport and East Hills Line. T5 services were also modified to no longer travel to and from Campbelltown, instead starting and terminating at Leppington. These changes mean the section of the network between Glenfield and Macarthur is served exclusively by services operating via the East Hills railway line for the first time.

In September 2024, following the closer of the T3 Bankstown line for conversion into the Southwest Metro, the T8 temporarily took over services between Sydenham and the City Circle before they are permanently moved to the T4 line.

==Operations and stations==
Apart from the Airport Line&#x27;s troubles, the line as a whole also suffered a substantial loss in patronage when the M5 East Tunnel opened in 2001. The tunnel joined the Eastern Distributor and M5 South Western Motorway, shortening road travel times between the city and the south-west. The line was estimated to have lost 384,450 commuters over 12 months after the tunnel opened. Since that time, however, the line appears to have gained commuters again, with a reported 3.5% increase in patronage up to early 2006.

Under the current (2024) timetable, there are generally three stopping patterns on the Airport &amp; South Line:

* Express service: from Macarthur, stopping all stations to Revesby, then express to Wolli Creek, then all stations to the City via the Airport.
* Local service: starting at Revesby and running all stops to the City via the Airport. Some times services start at East Hills.
* Sydenham service: from Sydenham, stopping at St Peters, Erskineville and Redfern

During peak hours, there are additional express services, which skip some stops between Macquarie Fields and Revesby, but some also make additional stops at Padstow and Riverwood. Some express services also operate via Sydenham instead of the Airport. There are also a few services terminating at Turrella.

Occasionally during trackwork on the City Circle, all services will be switched to run via Sydenham in one direction only, with the other direction running via the Airport, due to limitations of the track design at Central. Alternatively services will completely avoid the City Circle, terminating at Central platform 23. When there is trackwork on other lines, there will also occasionally be shuttle services running express to Kingsgrove via Sydenham.&#x27;

<doc id="1041359" wikidata="Q1643082" url="?curid=1041359" title="Hôtel Lambert">
<text>The Hôtel Lambert () is an &quot;hôtel particulier,&quot; a grand mansion townhouse, built between 1640 and 1644 on the Quai Anjou on the eastern tip of the Île Saint-Louis, in the 4th arrondissement of Paris. In the 19th century, the name &quot;Hôtel Lambert&quot; also came to designate a political faction of Polish exiles associated with Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who had purchased the Hôtel Lambert.

==Architectural history==

The house, on an irregular site at the tip of the Île Saint-Louis in the heart of Paris, was designed by architect Louis Le Vau. It was built between 1640 and 1644, originally for the financier Jean-Baptiste Lambert (d. 1644) and continued by his younger brother Nicolas Lambert, later president of the Chambre des Comptes. For Nicolas Lambert, the interiors were decorated by Charles Le Brun, François Perrier, and Eustache Le Sueur, producing one of the finest, most-innovative, and iconographically coherent examples of mid-17th-century domestic architecture and decorative painting in France.

The entrance gives onto the central square courtyard, around which the &quot;hôtel&quot; was built. A wing extends to the right at the rear, embracing a walled garden. At the same time, Louis Le Vau constructed a residence for himself adjacent to the Hôtel Lambert. He lived there between 1642 and 1650. It was where all of his children were born and his mother died. After the architect&#x27;s own death in 1670, his &quot;hôtel&quot; was bought by the La Haye family, who owned the other residence as well. Both buildings were then joined and their façades combined.
Both painters worked on the internal decoration for almost five years, producing the gallant allegories of Le Brun&#x27;s grand Galerie d&#x27;Hercule (still &quot;in situ&quot;, but heavily damaged in the 2013 fire described below) and the small Cabinet des Muses, with five canvases by Le Sueur that were purchased for the royal collection (now in the Louvre) and the earlier ensemble, the Cabinet de l&#x27;Amour, which in its original configuration featured an alcove for a canopied bed upon which the lady of the house would receive visitors, according to the custom of the day. Significantly the alcove was eliminated about 1703. All the ensembles featured themes of love and marriage. However, the paintings have since been dispersed.

In the 1740s, the Marquise du Châtelet and Voltaire, her lover, used the Hôtel Lambert as their Paris residence when not at her country estate in Cirey. The marquise was famed for her &quot;salon&quot; there. Later, the Marquis du Châtelet sold the Lambert to Claude Dupin and his wife Louise-Marie Dupin, who continued the tradition of the &quot;salon&quot;. The Dupins were ancestors of writer George Sand, who, because of her relationship with the Polish composer Chopin, was also a frequent guest of the 19th-century Polish owners of the property.

==A political salon==

In 1843, the &quot;hôtel particulier&quot; was bought by Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, member of the powerful family of Polish magnates. He and his brother, Konstanty Adam, were leaders of the liberal aristocratic faction of the Great Emigration from Poland, following the collapse of the November Uprising of 1830–1831. A political group formed around Adam Czartoryski, and his palatial residence in central Paris, surrounded by the natural &#x27;moat&#x27; of the river Seine, lent its name to his political faction.

The political beliefs of the &quot;Hôtel Lambert&quot; faction were derived from the 3 May Constitution, which its members had supported. The Hôtel Lambert played an important role in keeping the &quot;Polish question&quot; alive in European politics, by continually keeping the Polish cause on the agenda. It also served as a safe harbour for Polish emigés and royalists, exiled from their country after the unsuccessful uprising against Russia. Among other notable politicians who took part in the Hôtel Lambert&#x27;s activities were Władysław Czartoryski, son of Adam, Józef Bem, Henryk Dembiński, Karol Kniaziewicz, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Władysław Stanisław Zamoyski, Władysław Ostrowski and Leon Kaplinski.
Initially a political think tank and a discussion club, the political faction also worked on the preservation and promotion of Polish culture. An Historical and Literary Society began in 1832 and the idea of a Polish library, which exists to this day just along the Quai d&#x27;Orleans nearby, was conceived in the Hôtel Lambert in 1838. Plans laid for two schools teaching Polish (one for girls, one for boys) and were established in Batignolles. There was support for numerous commercial enterprises, especially in the fields of publication and printing. Over time, it became one of the most important hubs of Polish culture in the world, especially after the January Uprising, when Polish language and culture became heavily persecuted during the enforced Russification in the Russian Partition of Poland itself.

The Hôtel Lambert drew some renowned politicians and artists of the epoch, including Alexandre Walewski, Charles Forbes René de Montalembert, Frédéric Chopin, Zygmunt Krasiński, Alphonse de Lamartine, George Sand, Honoré de Balzac, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Eugène Delacroix, and Adam Mickiewicz. In fact, Chopin&#x27;s &quot;La Polonaise&quot; was composed expressly for the Polish ball held there every year.

==20th and 21st centuries==
The Hôtel Lambert was discreetly split into several luxurious apartments. It was once the home of actress Michèle Morgan, Mona von Bismarck, and of Alexis von Rosenberg, Baron de Redé, who rented the ground floor from 1947 until his death. De Redé entertained his lover Arturo Lopez-Willshaw (1900–1962), who continued to maintain a formal residence with wife Patricia in Neuilly. Redé and Lopez-Willshaw&#x27;s dinner parties and balls were at the center of &quot;le tout Paris&quot;. In 1969 de Redé staged his most famous ball, the Bal Oriental, with guests such as Jacqueline de Ribes, Guy de Rothschild, Salvador Dalí, Brigitte Bardot, Dolores Guinness, and Margrethe II of Denmark.

In 1975, the Czartoryski heirs sold the Hôtel Lambert to Baron Guy de Rothschild, whose wife, Marie-Hélène de Rothschild, was a close friend of de Redé; they used it as their Paris residence.

In September 2007, the Hôtel Lambert was sold by the Rothschilds to Prince Abdullah bin Khalifa al-Thani, brother of the Emir of Qatar for the purported sum of 80 million euros ($111 million). A UNESCO World Heritage-listed building, it was in need of restoration, as parts of its wooden structure were rotting, staircases were sagging, and paint was cracked and discoloured.

The Prince&#x27;s plan for a comprehensive overhaul of the building sparked controversy and became the subject of legal action brought by French conservationists. The scheme included plans to install air-conditioning, elevators, an underground car park with an exit through the notable curved garden wall, and a number of security measures. This involved digging under the garden and raising the 17th-century garden wall 80 cm. One heritage architect claimed the plans had &quot;the aesthetics of a James Bond villa&quot;. Former tenant Michèle Morgan suggested that super-rich clients wanting a tailor-made luxury modern residence should consider a larger site on the outskirts of Paris rather than a cramped position limited on all sides by the river Seine and listed monuments. However, Alain-Charles Perrot, the architect in charge of the project, suggested that there was an element of racism in the objections.

After several years of wrangling, a truce was overseen by the Ministry of Culture and Paris City Hall, and the renovation was given the go-ahead under the supervision of Bâtiments de France, which safeguards historic monuments. Work began in 2010.

On 10 July 2013 a portion of the building was severely damaged by a fire which started in the roof during renovation work. The Cabinet des Bains with a series of ceiling frescoes by Eustache Le Sueur was completely destroyed, and another series of frescoes by Charles Le Brun in the Gallery of Hercules was heavily damaged by smoke and water. The restoration and renovation took a further three years.

The restoration by Al Thani eventually cost €120m (£100m); the restored house showcasing a collection of French art and decorative works of the highest quality. These were sent to auction in a series of sales in 2022.

In 2022, the house was sold to French telecom billionaire and art collector Xavier Niel for more than €200 million ($226 million) to be reportedly used as the headquarters for Niel’s cultural foundation.

<text>Carlos Dominguez Cidon (born 1959, León, died 11 May 2009 in León) was a chef and author from Spain.

==Biography==

Cidon&#x27;s grandfather was a food lover and occasional cook. Cidon grew observing his grandfather cook, and he inherited his love for food from him.

In 1975, Cidon got a job in a restaurant named &quot;Akelarre&quot;, alongside Pedro Subijana, a well known chef of the era. In 1977, Cidon decided he wanted to pursue a career as a chef himself.

Cidon&#x27;s presence in modern Spanish cuisine began expanding after he graduated from college, and he became a well-respected cook during the decade of the 1980s, while also studying the relationship between delicate drinks such as wine and food. Eventually, wines became one of his favorite ingredients.

In 1989, he had the opportunity to open his first restaurant, &quot;Vivaldi&quot;. By 1994, Cidon was able to reopen the Leon historical center. He helped the center by cooking some of his most famous plates there.

In 1999, Cidon received the highest award a chef can get in Spain: the &quot;Premio Alimentos&quot;, given by Spain&#x27;s ministry of agriculture. The next year, he inaugurated his second restaurant, &quot;El Cesar&quot;.

In 2004, American tire business giant Michelin gave Cidon their &quot;Estrella de la Guia Michelin&quot; award (&quot;Michelin Guiding Star&quot;), given by that company to Spain&#x27;s top business achievers.

Cidon was named as delegate of Castilla and Leon and commissary of nutrition matters in Brussels. In addition, he has toured many countries as a restaurant guest chef, including the United States, England, Portugal, Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Puerto Rico.

<text>Puncak Jalil (formerly known as Bandar Seri Bukit Jalil) is an 801 acres (3.2 km2) township in Seri Kembangan, Selangor, Malaysia. It is situated near the Technology Park Malaysia along the Puchong-Sungai Besi Highway Federal Route 217 and south of the National Sports Complex.

The Maju Expressway runs through the eastern boundary of the project.

Adjacent townships include Kinrara to the northwest, Lestari Perdana to the southeast and Taman Equine to the south.

The development, which is undertaken by Maxisegar Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Talam, is an integrated and self-contained township comprising 11,651 units of residential and commercial properties.

The Gross Development Value of Puncak Jalil is estimated to be about RM2.5 billion with an expected development period of eight years.

The project was first launched in June 2001.

In 2006, IJM Berhad has agreed to step in to assist the ailing Talam Berhad to revive this project. Beautiful landscaping works are currently in progress and this town would have potential growths as it is situated right between Malaysia&#x27;s new administrative capital city, Putrajaya, with the old administrative capital city, Kuala Lumpur.

The project has wielded various controversies, notably the environmental damage done to the area (including the destruction of a lake with a natural island), the coercive relocation of native Orang Asli settlements and the general failure of the entire project (less than half of the completed housing areas are occupied).

The SMK Bandar Puncak Jalil school was opened in 2016.

<text>Novlene Hilaire Williams-Mills (&quot;née&quot;, Williams; born 26 April 1982) is a retired Jamaican track and field athlete. She won the bronze medal in the 400 metres at the 2007 World Championships. She is also a three-time Olympic silver medallist in the 4×400 metres relay. In 2015 she won relay gold alongside her Jamaican teammates.

== Early life ==
Williams-Mills was born in Saint Ann, Jamaica. She is a graduate of Ferncourt High School, located in Claremont, St. Ann Parish, Jamaica. She attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she was a member of coach Tom Jones&#x27; Florida Gators track and field team. She graduated from the university with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 2004.

In March 2020, Williams-Mills announced that she was pregnant with Twins.

==Athletics career==
At the 2005 World Championships in Athletics, she won (together with Shericka Williams, Ronetta Smith and Lorraine Fenton) a silver medal. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia, she received a bronze medal for her third-place finish in the 400 metres.

At the 2012 Olympic games, Williams-Mills won a silver medal in the 4×400 meter relay. She also placed 5th in the individual 400 m event.

Williams-Mills missed most of the 2013 season due to undergoing treatment for breast cancer.

During the 2014 season, Williams-Mills was very successful. Early in the season, she and three other Jamaican women won a silver medal in the 4 × 400 m relay at the 2014 world relays. Williams-Mills competed at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and won a silver medal in the individual 400 m and a gold in the 4 × 400 m relay, setting a games record in the latter. She was also successful at Diamond League meets, where she was crowned the 2014 Diamond League champion in the 400 m.

In 2015, Williams-Mills again won a silver medal at the world relays as part of the Jamaican 4 × 400 m team. At the 2015 World Championships in Athletics in Beijing, Williams-Mills finished sixth in the 400 m final involving four Jamaican women. In the relay, along with Christine Day, Shericka Jackson and Stephenie Ann McPherson, the individual 4th, 3rd and 5th placers, respectively, the Jamaican team won gold in front of the American favorites by just outsprinting them in the last 50 metres.

In 2016, Williams-Mills only competed in the relay at the 2016 Olympic games, running as the anchor leg for Jamaica trying to pass Allyson Felix of the US, but during the final stretch Allyson manage to hold off Novelene to get gold for the US and Jamaica got silver.

In 2017, Williams-Mills won the 400 m at the Jamaica invitational, winning in a time of 50.56. Later on in the season, she also won the 400 m at the Diamond League meeting in Paris in a time of 51.03.

At the London 2017 World Championships, Williams-Mills made the final of the women&#x27;s 400 m and came in eighth place in a time of 51.49. In the 4 × 400 m relay, which was going to be her last major championship race, she was scheduled to anchor the Jamaican team; however, on the second leg, Anneisha McLaughlin-Wilby pulled up injured, therefore ending the Jamaican team&#x27;s chances of medalling in that event.

During the 2017 season, Williams-Mills announced that she would retire at the end of the 2017 season “ This is my farewell season; I’ve been in this for a long time and I think I’ve done my fair share and represented my country well so sometimes you have to hang up your spikes and move on the next chapter of your life and I think I’ve reached that point where I need to do that now&quot;, said Williams-Mills.

Her last race was on 1 September 2017 at the Brussels Diamond League, where she came 6th place running 51.27.

==Cancer diagnosis==
In July 2013, Williams-Mills told members of the media that she was diagnosed with breast cancer before the 2012 Olympics. Very few people at the time knew about the diagnosis. Despite the diagnosis, she still ran the race and was able to help Jamaica win a bronze medal. After the Olympics, Williams-Mills had a mastectomy and in January 2013, had another operation. She has stated that she would run, &quot;for all the breast cancer survivors out there.&quot;

<doc id="1041369" wikidata="Q1122653" url="?curid=1041369" title="Torse">
<text>In heraldry, a torse or wreath is a twisted roll of fabric laid about the top of the helmet and the base of the crest. It has the dual purpose of masking the join between helm and crest, and of holding the mantling in place.

The torse is sometimes mistakenly said to represent the token, called a favour, such as a handkerchief or sleeve, which the knight&#x27;s lady-love gave him to wear when he left for the wars or participated in tournaments. The purpose of the torse is known to be the masking of the &quot;unsightly joining&quot; of the helmet and the crest. However, it is possible that a knight might &quot;twist [the favour] in and out or over and over the fillet which surrounded the joining-place of crest and helmet.&quot; Thus the favour (lady&#x27;s handkerchief) might be twisted into the torse. 

The torse is blazoned as part of the crest. For example, the crest of the coat of arms of Canada is blazoned &quot;On a wreath of the colours Argent and Gules, a lion passant guardant Or imperially crowned proper and holding in the dexter paw a maple leaf Gules.&quot; The tinctures of the torse are generally not mentioned in the blazon, as they are assumed to be of the principal metal and colour in the shield. Like the mantling, the torse must always be of a metal and a colour; usually the torse and the mantling have the same tinctures. In British heraldry, the torse is generally shown with six twists of material, alternately metal and colour.

The abstracted torse is a modern development in which the twisted cloth of the torse appears as a solid, straight bar or pole, of twisted colors. This later development is due a design simplification of the blazoned torse. 

Occasionally the torse is replaced by a crown or coronet, which is then termed a &quot;crest-coronet&quot;. In the past this practice was widespread amongst all ranks, but is nowadays usually denied to those outside royalty and the peerage, except in special circumstances. Some commoners have bypassed this rule by placing a coronet &quot;on top of&quot; a torse, rather than in place of it.

The torse is also often used as a decoration on a heraldic animal, either across the brow, as a form of circlet, or around the neck. Moors and Saracens are traditionally depicted in heraldry with a torse across their brow.

<doc id="1041388" wikidata="Q3027066" url="?curid=1041388" title="Didier Julia">
<text>Didier Julia (born 18 February 1934) is a French politician. He was in 2007 representing the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) from Seine-et-Marne in the French National Assembly, a post he has held from 1967. He is mainly known for his interference in liberation operations of French hostages detained in Iraq following the US invasion in 2003.

Didier Julia is doctor of State in Literature, &quot;agrégé&quot; in philosophy and university professor. He is in the Gaullist political family, a member of the UMP. He has been elected deputy for Fontainebleau since 1967.

In 1998, he supported accepting the votes of the Front National in the regional Council of the Île-de-France region.

He is a member of the commission of Foreign Affairs. A long-time friend of the government of Saddam Hussein, especially of Tariq Aziz, he was the leader of the pro-Iraqi lobby in the National Assembly until the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States and their allies. He is also a member of groups promoting friendship toward Saudi Arabia, Cameroon, the United States, Iran, Palestine, Syria, Zambia.

Didier Julia is the French member of the National Assembly who hold the record for longevity by the number of terms and years, with Jean Tiberi and Jean-Pierre Soisson (both since 1968), 11 terms and 45 years in the Assembly since 1967. In 2011, he announced that he will not contested his seat again for the legislative elections of 2012.

==The Iraq hostage affairs==
From 14 to 17 September 2002, in a context of growing tensions in the region, he went to Iraq with two other deputies of the UMP, Thierry Mariani and Éric Diard. The journey irritated President Jacques Chirac and Foreign affairs minister Dominique de Villepin, who called them &quot;&quot;pieds nickelés&quot; (a derogatory and mocking expression denoting incompetence and vanity). The three went back to Iraq in March 2003, just before war broke out.

On 30 September 2004, while French diplomacy had been trying to obtain the liberation of Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot, two journalists held hostage by the Islamic Army in Iraq, he went to Damascus. Three days later, he stated that he had succeeded in liberating the hostages, thanks to his contacts all over the world (mainly former baathists, and the President of Ivory Coast Laurent Gbagbo, who provided support, including the Ivorian presidential plane). He later said that he had eventually failed &quot;in extremis&quot;, and went back to France on 4 October, where the press and the political circles called him and his team &quot;pieds nickelés&quot;&quot; again. The executive sought to distance itself from Julia, describing his actions as a &quot;private initiative&quot;, though it had initially given some support to Julia by facilitating his entry into Syria.

The &quot;Figaro&quot;, employer of one of the hostages, called them &quot;dangerous amateurs&quot;, and the government mentioned a &quot;nefarious superchery&quot;. Didier Julia responded on Europe 1 and TF1 by stating that the French diplomacy was totally lost, and said that he was bashed as a scapegoat for their failure. The &quot;Julia Affair&quot; begun, resulting in the arrest of Philippe Brett and Philippe Evano. Along with Dider Julia, they were put under judicial investigation for &quot;conspiracy with foreign powers&quot;. Some commentators pointed out that this prosecution could be a smart move by the government to avoid an embarrassing parliamentary investigation into the matter – since Parliament regulations prohibit investigating a case that is already investigated by justice; the judicial case would end nowhere and embarrassing revelations would not happen. (&quot;Le Canard Enchaîné&quot;)

On 21 December, the hostages were liberated by the DGSE, which said to have proceeded to whole affair. The next day, Georges Malbrunot, arrived in France and qualified Julia and his friends of &quot;imposters&quot; and &quot;mythomanes&quot; who put their lives into jeopardy. Didier Julia accused foreign minister Michel Barnier of influencing the hostages during the four-hour flight from Iraq. Barnier himself, asked on TF1 whether Julia could be excluded from the UMP, said that this would be &quot;a minimum&quot;.

On 1 March 2005, a video footage of Florence Aubenas, a French journalist of &quot;Libération&quot; taken hostage on 5 January 2005, was found in Iraq. Aubenas asks &quot;Monsieur Julia&quot; to rescue her. Didier Julia said that he was ready to offer his services to the government if sanctions taken against him and his friends were dropped. The French foreign minister stated that the case would be processed by regular services and that the investigation on Julia would continue (Florence Aubenas was freed on 11 June).

<doc id="1041389" wikidata="Q1393844" url="?curid=1041389" title="Locking hubs">
<text>Locking hubs, also known as free wheeling hubs are fitted to some (mainly older) four-wheel drive vehicles, allowing the front wheels to rotate freely when disconnected (unlocked) from the front axle. This is done to reduce the mechanical resistance of the front-portion of the drivetrain when four-wheel drive is not in use. The hub, along with the wheel, is designed to engage (lock) onto the axle, to be powered by the drivetrain in four-wheel drive; or the hub can disengage (unlock) from the axle when four-wheel drive is not needed, thus allowing the front wheels to rotate freely within the hub. The hub is a component where the wheel is directly mounted to, and is outside the axle.

The benefits of unlocking hubs for normal road use are mainly found in increased fuel efficiency. When the front hubs are locked, even if no power is sent to the front axle (by means of a transfer case), the turning of the wheels will still spin the front axle, differential, and driveshaft, which puts extra load on the engine. Unlocking the hubs disconnects the wheels from the axle, which eliminates this extra load. Other benefits also include keeping the front-differential free from unnecessary wear, quieter operation, less vibration, and lower wear in other drive line components. However, many manufacturers list engaging the hubs (even in 2WD mode) for several miles a month to lubricate the front drive train as part of the vehicle&#x27;s regular maintenance schedule.

Mechanically activated locking hubs are activated by hand by turning a switch on the end of the axle. The advantage to mechanical hubs is that they are often considered more robust, and less prone to issues due to maintenance negligence. The disadvantage of this is that the driver needs to get out of the vehicle to activate the hubs.

In some other vehicles, automatic locking hubs are used which, as the name implies, engage automatically when 4WD is engaged. The main advantage is that the driver does not need to leave the vehicle to connect the wheels to the axle. The disadvantage with this system is that most designs require the vehicle to move some distance (usually a whole wheel turn, often going backwards) after engaging the hubs in order for the hubs to engage or disengage. This might not be possible if the vehicle gets completely stuck (due to a lack of torque and/or traction) before the hubs have been engaged, meaning automatic hubs require more caution on the driver&#x27;s part. Most modern vehicles with automatic hubs, automatically lock their hubs when using low range gearbox, making it difficult or impossible to use torque multiplication in conjunction with FWD or RWD.

Locking hub mechanisms also generally extend further beyond the wheel than most axles, and exposed hub locks can be broken or damaged by off-road conditions, rendering 4×4 useless and leaving the vehicle stranded. Also, in some axle designs (such as those used on older Land Rovers), the top swivel bearing can become starved for lubrication (which is normally supplied by oil slung up by the rotating axle), unless the hubs are locked every few hundred miles. Also, since locking hubs generally do not require a key to operate, they can be maliciously locked or unlocked by persons other than the vehicle owner.

<doc id="1041392" wikidata="Q720008" url="?curid=1041392" title="Great Emigration">
<text>The Great Emigration () was the emigration of thousands of Poles and Lithuanians, particularly from the political and cultural élites, from 1831 to 1870, after the failure of the November Uprising of 1830–1831 and of other uprisings such as the Kraków uprising of 1846 and the January Uprising of 1863–1864. The emigration affected almost the entirety of political elite in Congress Poland. The exiles included artists, soldiers and officers of the uprising, members of the Sejm of Congress Poland of 1830–1831 and several prisoners-of-war who escaped from captivity.

== Polish emigration after the partitions ==

From the end of the 18th century, a large portion of the Polish political landscape was dominated by those who carried out their activities outside of the country as émigrés. Their exile was the result of the Partitions of Poland, which completely divided the lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth between the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg monarchy of Austria. 

Because of the emigration of political elites, much of the political and ideological activity of Polish intelligentsia in the 18th and the 19th centuries took place outside of the regions of partitioned Poland. Most of the political émigrés based themselves in France.

== After the November Uprising ==
The most important wave of emigration came after the November Uprising of 1830–1831.

According to Rolf Malte, in the fall of 1831, around 50,000 people were forced to emigrate from Congress Poland. J. Zubrzycki estimates that the number of political refugees likely wasn&#x27;t larger than 5,000–6,000 at any point in the period between 1831 and the last quarter of the 19th century. 

Those Poles later fought and provided valuable support during the 1846 and 1848 revolutions in Poland. Their resistance was not limited to Polish revolutionary activity, as they also participated in various lands during the Revolutions of 1848, including France, the small principalities of Germany and Italy, Austria, Hungary, and the Danubian principalities Wallachia and Moldavia, the South American countries Argentina and Uruguay (participating in the &quot;Guerra Grande&quot; of 1839–1852) and in the Crimean War of 1853–1856. Additional waves of émigrés left the Polish lands after the failures of the attempted 1848 revolution and the January Uprising of 1863–1864.

Notable Poles and Lithuanians of the Great Emigration included Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, leader of the Polish government-in-exile in Paris (with embassies in London and Istanbul); politician Joachim Lelewel; national bards Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz Słowacki, Cyprian Kamil Norwid, and Zygmunt Krasiński; as well as Leonard Chodźko, Ignacy Domeyko, Maurycy Mochnacki, Piotr Michałowski, Seweryn Goszczyński, Jozef Bohdan Zaleski, Aleksander Mirecki, Emil Korytko, Antoni Patek, Casimir Gzowski, Aleksander Jełowicki, Ignacy Szymanski and Adolf Zytogorski.

<text>The Monash Freeway is a major urban freeway in Victoria, Australia, linking Melbourne&#x27;s CBD to its south-eastern suburbs and beyond to the Gippsland region. It carries up to 180,000 vehicles per day and is one of Australia&#x27;s busiest freeways. The entire stretch of the Monash Freeway bears the designation M1.

The freeway is named in honour of General Sir John Monash, an esteemed Australian military commander for the allies during World War I.

==History==
The Monash Freeway is an amalgamation of two initially separate freeways: the Mulgrave Freeway (initially designated Freeway Route 81) linking Warrigal Road, Chadstone to the Princes Highway in Eumemmerring; and the South Eastern Freeway (initially designated Metropolitan Route 80, then Freeway Route 80) linking Punt Road, Richmond and Toorak Road, Hawthorn East.

===Mulgrave Freeway===
Plans for a &quot;Mulgrave By-pass Road and Eumemmerring By-pass Road&quot; had been made as far back as 1966, between Warrigal Road in Chadstone and Princes Highway at Eumemmerring. The Country Roads Board started construction in the 1969/70 financial year, with the initial section of road opened to traffic in late 1972 with two names: as Mulgrave Freeway (from Stud Road in Dandenong North to Doveton), and Eumemmerring Freeway (from Doveton to Princes Highway at Eumemmerring); Eumemmerring Freeway was later separated and renamed South Gippsland Freeway in April 1974, and extended further south to Hampton Park in 1976. Through the 1970s and the early 1980s, the Mulgrave Freeway was progressively extended westward to Springvale Road in 1974, Blackburn Road in 1976, Forster Road in 1977, Huntingdale Road in 1979, and finally to Warrigal Road in Chadstone. The Freeway Route 81 designation was removed in 1988, coinciding with the opening of the South Eastern Arterial and its replacement by National Route 1.

At this time the Tullamarine Freeway also carried the Freeway Route 81 shield. This was due to the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan having the two freeways linked to each other from around East Malvern (at the Mulgrave Freeway end) and at Flemington (at the Tullamarine Freeway end), sweeping through the St Kilda area. The plan never came to fruition, but the two freeways have since been linked by the West Gate Freeway extension and the CityLink project.

==== Mulgrave Freeway timeline of construction ====
* 1972: Mulgrave and Eumemmerring Freeways, total from Princes Highway, Eumemmerring to Stud Road, Dandenong North, opened by the Governor of Victoria Sir Rohan Delacombe, 21 November 1972, total cost A$6.8mil.
* 1974: Mulgrave Freeway, extended from Stud Road to Springvale Road, Mulgrave, opened 10 April 1974, costing A$9.3mil.
* 1976: Extended from Springvale Road to Blackburn Road, Glen Waverley, opened 15 December 1976.
* 1977: Extended from Blackburn Road to Forster Road, Mount Waverley, opened 5 April 1977 by Minister for Transport, the Hon J A Rafferty (this section, along with the previous section opened in 1976, cost a total of A$13m).
* 1979: Extended from Forster Road to Huntingdale Road, Oakleigh, with three lanes each direction plus emergency stopping lanes, opened by Minister for Transport, the Hon Rob Maclellan MLA, 12 December 1979, at a cost of $8.7 million.
* 1981: Extended from Huntingdale Road to Warrigal Road, Malvern, with two lanes each direction plus emergency stopping lanes, opened by Minister for Transport, the Hon Rob Maclellan MLA, 24 June 1981, at a cost of $11 million. ‘Opened one week after the 20th anniversary of the opening of Victoria&#x27;s first freeway, the Maltby Bypass Road near Werribee, on 16 June 1961&#x27;.

=== South Eastern Freeway ===
Construction of the initial section of the South Eastern Freeway by the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works had been completed and opened in 1962, connecting Burnley at Burnley Street, through Cremorne via Harcourt Parade, over Punt Road using a new overpass (known as the Morshead Overpass during construction) to end at Anderson Street and the Morell Bridge, with an at-grade intersection with Brunton Avenue and a single-carriageway feeder road to the Swan Street bridge (and Batman Avenue) 800 metres beyond. The freeway was eventually further extended east from Burnley under the MacRobertson Bridge along the Yarra River to Toorak Road in 1970, with a single-carriageway feeder road taking excess traffic to Tooronga Road. The Punt Road overpass and elevated section of road over the Yarra River and Gardiners Creek were designed by Melbourne engineer Bruce Day. Responsibility for the freeway was transferred from the MMBW to the Country Roads Board on 1 July 1974.

Initially designated Metropolitan Route 80 in 1965, it was later signed as Freeway Route 80 in 1970 when the extension to Kooyong opened.

*1970: Extended from Burnley to Toorak Road, Kooyong, 22 May 1970, by Minister for Local Government Rupert Hamer

===South Eastern Arterial road link===
The resulting gap between the Toorak Road end of the South Eastern Freeway and the Warrigal Road end of the Mulgrave Freeway frustrated drivers for many years; motorists had to rely on inadequate feeder roads to connect between the two freeways. Plans to link the two freeways dated from August 1978, while still extending the Mulgrave Freeway, from a Steering Committee appointed by the government in 1976 to carry out the &quot;Gardiners Creek Valley Study&quot;: the study involved the Ministries for Planning, of Transport and for Conservation, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, Town and Country Planning Board, Malvern, Camberwell and Hawthorn City Councils and the Country Roads Board, with an extensive process of public consultation. The subsequent route agreed to was referred to as the &quot;South Eastern Freeway, Malvern Section&quot; and was ultimately the alignment constructed.

Construction of the link as a dual-carriageway road began in 1985, opening to traffic in late 1988, originally with two lanes in each direction, and declared a State Highway. The link road, as well as the South Eastern and Mulgrave Freeways, were all renamed the South Eastern Arterial. This road assumed the National Route 1 route number from the Princes Highway, which became an alternative route. The project attracted a great deal of controversy just before it opened and well afterwards: in order to save costs, only one freeway-style interchange had been constructed (underneath High Street in Glen Iris). Every other interchange with major roads along the route (Toorak, Burke, Tooronga and Warrigal Roads) was an at-grade intersection controlled by traffic-lights, and because the road was constructed through residential areas, reduced speed limits were also enforced. This led to heavy congestion, frequently kilometres long, on the freeway, fuelling anger and frustration, and attracting a moniker of &quot;the South-Eastern Carpark&quot;.

With a change of government some years later and a lot of political showmanship, more money was poured into the road: ramps connecting Police Road (to complement the existing ramps at Jacksons Road) opened in 1993, to improve traffic flow to Waverley Gardens and AFL Park; and on the link road, construction of an overpass across Warrigal Road in 1994, and underpass interchanges at Toorak and Burke Roads (and just an underpass at Tooronga Road) soon afterwards. The name changed from South Eastern Arterial back to South Eastern Freeway for the full length of the freeway after upgrade works (including noise reduction measures, new landscaping and improvements to the adjacent cycle path) were completed in early 1997. The improved road dramatically improved the rate of outbound traffic; however, the bottleneck at the Swan Street Bridge still remained and the queues only got longer.

The previous Freeway Route designations (Freeway Route 80 along the South Eastern Freeway, and Freeway Route 81 along the Mulgrave Freeway) were removed in 1988 with the opening of the South Eastern Arterial, and replaced by National Route 1.

====South Eastern Arterial timeline of construction====
*1988: South Eastern Arterial, from Toorak Road to Warrigal Road, opened 21 December 1988, at a cost of $152 million
*1993: Police Road ramps, opened June 1993, at a cost of $2.2 million
*1994: Warrigal Road overpass, opened June 1994, at a cost of $15 million
*1996: Tooronga Road overpass, opened January 1996
*1997: Conversion to freeway completed, and renamed South Eastern Freeway, official &quot;opening&quot; on 20 March 1997, at a total cost of $112m

===Monash Freeway===
The name changed yet again two years later to the current Monash Freeway in 1999, so named by Premier Jeff Kennett after General Sir John Monash, a renowned Australian soldier, engineer, scholar and nation builder. In the late 1990s, construction of CityLink&#x27;s Southern Link project began, with the aim of linking the north-western end of the freeway (then terminating at Batman Avenue) to the eastern-end of the West Gate Freeway by way of tunnels underneath the city, allowing for an uninterrupted voyage past the CBD. A portion of the existing Monash Freeway at the city end (from Toorak to Punt Roads) was subsumed into the Southern Link, and while this portion was widened and upgraded, as part of the CityLink project it was also tolled, attracting criticism from road users. The Southern Link fully opened and tolling commenced on 28 December 2000.

With Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, the freeway&#x27;s former National Route 1 designation began conversion to the M1 in late 1996, and was completed in 1997.

====Hallam Bypass====
Before this bypass was constructed, the sweeping curve of the freeway at the Hallam end that became the South Gippsland Freeway had its capacity reduced from three lanes to two, resulting in a notorious bottle-neck at peak hours, especially for outbound traffic exiting at the Princes Highway interchange outside Dandenong; the extension finally bypassed the entire problem.

Construction on the Hallam Bypass, linking the Monash Freeway to the Princes Freeway in Berwick, began in the 1999/2000 financial year, and was completed after 3 years of construction to open in July 2003, 17 months ahead of schedule and $10 million under budget for a total cost $165 million. This was due to the omission of one key interchange that should have linked the South Gippsland Freeway with the Hallam Bypass at Eummemmering. This omission causes unnecessary congestion on neighbouring roads as northbound South Gippsland Freeway traffic must exit the freeway at Princes Highway only to join the same freeway again from Belgrave-Hallam Road eastbound.

The Monash Freeway allows travel from Morwell in the central Latrobe Valley, to Colac south-west of Geelong – via CityLink, the West Gate, the Geelong Ring Road and Princes Freeways. Motorists can cover over and only encounter traffic lights at Yarragon and Trafalgar, which are yet to be bypassed. The construction of the bypass also included the Hallam Bypass Trail shared path.

===Road classification===
The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared Monash Freeway (Freeway #1000) from the &quot;Southern Link Tollway&quot; (CityLink&#x27;s Southern Link) at Kooyong to Princes Highway in Narre Warren.

The freeway was originally shown in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as part of the F9 and F14 Freeway corridors.

===Upgrades===
====2007–10====
In 2007, the state government announced a major upgrade widening the lanes from Glenferrie Road through to Heatherton Road. Prior to this, over 160,000 vehicles per day used this freeway resulting in congestion during peak hours. The upgrade started in late 2007 and was completed in 2010. The entire project was known as the Monash-CityLink-West Gate upgrade, and was carried out by VicRoads and Transurban.

====2016–22====

The Monash Freeway (and parts of the Princes Freeway continuing eastward) are to be upgraded to accommodate an extra lane in each direction between Warrigal Road in Chadstone and Cardinia Road in Officer. Stage 1, completed between 2016 and 2018, added extra lanes between EastLink and Clyde Road in Berwick. Stage 2, completed between 2020 and 2022, added extra lanes in the remaining segments, re-connected Police Road with its own outbound ramp and added dedicated ramps to Eastlink from Jacksons Road, upgraded the entire section to use VicRoads&#x27; traffic management system, and upgraded and extended O&#x27;Shea Road to join the Beaconsfield Interchange.

== Route and conditions ==
The freeway officially begins at the southern end of CityLink, at Toorak Road. Here the freeway is five lanes wide. The opposing carriageways of the freeway are relatively near to each other and are separated by a concrete barrier. This section has overhead lighting. This first section of freeway runs through the south-eastern suburbs of Malvern, Glen Iris and Malvern East.

After Warrigal Road, the freeway is built within a much wider road reserve, allowing for a wide grass centre median with steel barrier separating the carriageways. This section does not have overhead lighting and carries four or five lanes on each carriageway. This section runs through south-eastern metropolitan Melbourne, including the suburbs of Chadstone, Mount Waverley, Mulgrave, and Dandenong to Doveton. Finally, the newest portion of the freeway, the Hallam bypass, carries three lanes each way and runs past Hallam to Narre Warren, where it becomes the Princes Freeway.

The M1 route also carries the recently developed VicRoads Traffic Management System which included Freeway On-Ramp metering (with road loops and signals), over-head speed limit and lane signs and electronic message boards; there are also various CCTV cameras and traffic sensors to monitor traffic flow and conditions constantly. Electronic &#x27;Estimated Travel Time&#x27; boards are also used in conjunction with the sensors.

Standard travel time for Monash Freeway/CityLink (Southern link), in both directions, is 32 minutes: 7 minutes between Clyde Road and the South Gippsland Freeway, 5 minutes between the South Gippsland Freeway and EastLink, 8 minutes between EastLink and Warrigal Road, 5 minutes between Warrigal Road and Toorak Road and 7 minutes between Toorak Road and Kings Way (which is outside the Domain Tunnel on the West Gate Freeway).

The usual peak period travel time with traffic congestion is between 45 and 70 minutes. Some of the slowest intersections at these times include the EastLink and South Gippsland Freeway interchanges. In times of extreme congestion or traffic accidents, the travel time can quickly increase to as high as 110 minutes.

<doc id="1041410" wikidata="Q2628322" url="?curid=1041410" title="Majokko Megu-chan">
<text>is a popular magical girl anime series. The manga was created by Tomô Inoue and Makiho Narita, while the 72-episode anime series was produced by Toei Animation between 1974 and 1975. This series is considered an important forerunner of the present day magical girl genre, as the series&#x27; characterization and general structure exerted considerable influence over future shows in the same genre. Most notably, several of the show&#x27;s recurring motifs inspired Toei&#x27;s &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, AIC&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Sammy&quot;, and (to a lesser degree) &quot;Wedding Peach&quot;.

==Story==
&quot;Megu-Chan&quot; follows the experiences of a powerful (but accident-prone) young witch who comes to Earth as part of her initiation into larger society. Megu is a contender for the throne of the Witch World but knows very little of human relationships. Sent to Mid-World (Earth) in her early teens, she is adopted by Mammi Kanzaki, a former witch who gave up her royal ambitions to wed a mortal. Mammi bewitches her husband and their two children, Rabi and Apo, into believing that Megu has always been the eldest child of the family (the concept of using magic to alter memory would turn up again in future magical girl series, such as &quot;Majokko Tickle&quot; and &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;). Under Mammi&#x27;s tutelage, Megu learns to control both her abilities and impulses in order to prove her worthiness for the crown.

This rite of passage subtext is continued throughout the series. A free spirit in the purest sense of the word, Megu-chan discovers emotions she had never known existed – loneliness, compassion, grief, love, desperation, and (perhaps most importantly) self-sacrifice. As the story progresses, she proves the nobility of her character through the various trials and tribulations of youth, evolving from a willful and rather selfish little girl into a kind, generous, loving young woman. She battles monsters, demons, and rival sorcerers (including her nemesis, Non), but quickly realizes that her true enemy is the darker side of human nature.

==Characters==
:Initially, Megu experiences severe difficulties adapting to &#x27;normal&#x27; society, even at the simplest levels. Family relationships are completely beyond her. She argues with her Father and squabbles constantly with her younger siblings, Rabi and Apo, who love to play tricks on her. She confronts Boss, the school bully, in an escalating battle of wills and gets into trouble with her teachers. She falls in love with the new boy and weeps in secret when he returns to his home country. Basically, her behavior resembles that of any other girl her age, given the social norms in mid-1970s Japan. As with the magical girl programs of the 1960s, the main focus was on family and friendship; domestic disputes were normally handled with light hearted humor. In the last episode, she and Non are summoned back to the magic world to conclude their training. 
:Blue-haired and pale-skinned, Non is Megu&#x27;s main contender for the crown. Setting a precedent for many later &quot;mahou shōjo&quot; anime, Non attempts to murder Megu during their very first meeting and continues to plague her throughout the series. Eventually, Non comes to admire her rival&#x27;s innate courage, even joining forces with her against mutual enemies in several episodes. While true friendship is never an option (in Non&#x27;s view anyway), the two reach an uneasy truce by the middle of the series, agreeing to hold off their final confrontation (for possession of the throne) as long as possible, and by the end of the series, Non becomes far frequently a source of help than hindrance to Megu. 
: Megu&#x27;s adopted mother. Like Megu, she is a witch who once competed to become the next queen but fell in love with a human. 
: Megu&#x27;s adopted father. Founder of Kanzaki Promotion. 
: Megu&#x27;s adopted brother. Rabi is a bit of troublemaker, always pulling pranks on Megu. He doesn&#x27;t know how to swim. 
: Megu&#x27;s adopted sister. She has a tendency to hit her siblings with a toy hammer. She&#x27;s very close with a St. Bernard named Gonbei, which the Kanzaki family eventually adopts. 
: Non&#x27;s adoptive mother. Extremely uptight and proper. Like Mami, she gave up her chances of becoming queen to marry a human. 
: An investigator of the witch queen sent to keep an eye on Megu and Non. He intends to sabotage Megu&#x27;s chances of winning the throne. Occasionally he&#x27;ll team up with Megu&#x27;s enemies, such as the evil Saturn. In the final episode he is formally punished by the Queen. His name is a pun on the term &quot;chousakan&quot; (調査官) or &quot;examiner.&quot; 
: A talking cat who acts as Chousan&#x27;s underling. 
: A talking crow who acts as Chousan&#x27;s underling. 
: The school gang leader and Megu and Non&#x27;s classmate. 
: Megu&#x27;s first friend, her family owns a bakery. She stops appearing halfway through the series and is replaced by Emi. 
: She first appears in episode 30. She unknowingly used hypnosis which caused men to hit her. Eventually this was fixed by Minster Joseph. She was brought into the series to promote a fashion doll called &quot;&quot;Fushigiko Emi-chan&quot;.&quot; 
: Megu&#x27;s homeroom teacher. 
: Rabi&#x27;s friend who is good at making paper planes. Appears in episodes 38 and 63. 
: The supreme ruler of all witches. She will ultimately choose her successor. 
: An evil witch and the self-proclaimed &quot;Queen of Darkness.&quot; She wants to eliminate Megu and Non, so she can inherit the throne. At the end of the series she teams up with a few of Megu&#x27;s other enemies. Appears in episodes 27, 33, 56, and 71. She is likely based on Saturn from Roman Mythology. 
: Attorney general of the magic world. She visits the human world following a negative report on Megu by Chousan. Appears in episodes 11. 
: An evil witch who lost a battle against the queen and now lives deep in a forest. Appears in episodes 14. 
: A younger witch who looks up to Megu. She disguises herself as Megu and causes trouble in the human world. In episode 71, she helps Megu defeat Saturn. 
: An old woman who used to be a witch but now sells ice cream. 50 years ago she left the magic world to start a family but both her husband and child died during a war. Mami and Megu help her practice magic again. Appears in episodes 21. 
: An examiner from the magic world. He originally appeared in episode 32 to test Megu and Non. In episode 71, he becomes one of Saturn&#x27;s subordinates and reveals Megu&#x27;s true identity to her family. He is then destroyed by Megu. 
: Saturn&#x27;s minion. She is sent to kill Megu and Non but is quickly defeated. Megu nurses Rosa back to health and teaches her compassion. Appears in episode 33. 
: She is Mami&#x27;s former classmate. Penny visits the Kanzaki household with her fellow witches Cent, Franc, Mark, and Ruble. Penny and the others appear again in episode 71 to help fight Saturn. 
: Twin witches who were exiled for playing pranks. They both appear in episode 37. 
: The winter witch. Originally appearing in episode 46, she returns in episode 71 working under Saturn. She is destroyed by Mami&#x27;s spell. 
: The spring fairy. Once she regains her power, she defeats Samusa. Appears in episode 46. 
: A flower fairy who longed to live in the human world. She poses as a transfer student in Megu&#x27;s class. Saturn blackmails her into killing Megu and Non. Ultimately, Yuri sacrifices herself to save Megu. Appears in episode 56.
: An elderly woman who sells pinwheels. She&#x27;s actually a witch and a former queen candidate. She was banished for abusing her powers and her daughter, Mimi, was taken from her. Thanks to Megu&#x27;s courage, Mimi and Belle are reunited. Appears in episode 49. 
: Belle&#x27;s daughter who was taken from her. She will be pardoned by the Queen and live on earth as a human. Appears in episode 49. 
: Umbrella craftsman from the magic world. Appears in episode 61. 
: An outlaw witch. She poses as substitute teacher at Megu and Non&#x27;s school. Appears in episode 69. 

==Social commentary==
The series dealt with subject matter considered too mature for young children at the time. Complicated social issues such as domestic violence, substance abuse and extramarital relationships were introduced, while loss and mortality frequently underscored Megu&#x27;s hijinks. This was a major break from the traditional juvenile animation in both Asia and the West, perhaps explaining why the series did not find a European market until the early eighties.

Another point of departure was the series’ subtle eroticism. &quot;Majokko Megu-chan&quot; was born of a proposal by Hiromi Productions, which had previously produced the less successful magical girl series &quot;Miracle Shoujo Limit-chan&quot; (1973–74) with Toei, to create a magical-girl series with a slightly naughtier edge than previous shows of the genre. The influence of Megu-chan&#x27;s Toei stablemate, Go Nagai&#x27;s &quot;Cutie Honey&quot;, was apparent in several aspects, from the somewhat racy lyrics of the opening theme song (performed, as was &quot;Cutie Honey&quot;&#x27;s, by Yoko Maekawa) to the fact that the two series shared many of the same staff. While not as overtly sexualized as Nagai&#x27;s heroine, &quot;Megu-chan&quot; was surprisingly voyeuristic for its period. Megu was frequently depicted in various states of undress and the series featured scenes which anticipated the rise of so-called fan service anime; the opening theme song itself features lyrics in which Megu boasts about her breasts and her way of manipulating boys with her looks and coquettish behaviors. (The theme song lyrics were penned by lyricist Kazuya Senke, known for writing hit songs with similarly suggestive lyrics in 1973-74 for then-teenage J-pop idol Momoe Yamaguchi.)

Later kogaru heroines would capitalize on Megu&#x27;s sexuality; it would, in fact, become a hallmark of the genre. There were numerous scenes in which Megu wore sheer nightgowns through which her underwear was plainly visible. Rabi had an arsenal tricks aimed at catching his &quot;big sister&quot; disrobed, from yanking the sheets off Megu&#x27;s bed in the morning to using a fishing rod to lift her skirt.

Rabi was not the only voyeur Megu was forced to contend with; there was the vile Chou-san, an agent of the witch queen sent to sabotage Megu&#x27;s chances of winning the throne. A stereotypical pervert in every sense of the term, Chou spent most of his time spying on Meg and devising ways to publicly humiliate her. In a memorable scene in episode 23, Chou-san rigged Megu&#x27;s bathtub with wheels, causing it to race around the city while Megu was bathing. Earlier in that same episode, Chou attempted to trick Megu into taking off all of her clothes by hypnotizing her with a magical cuckoo clock; only Non&#x27;s intervention at the last minute saved Megu from stripping herself totally naked. In another sequence, Chou-san breaks into the Kanzaki residence, hoping to abduct Megu in her sleep (fortunately she woke up in time and chased him out of the house). While his intentions were never stated explicitly, his underlying motivations were always made obvious.

==Influence on Japanese popular culture==
&quot;Megu-Chan&quot; was not the first magical girl anime, but it has been described as the first &quot;modern&quot; anime series to fall into the genre. Initially overlooked as a minor effort due its relative obscurity following its airing in the seventies, it nonetheless formed a template on which many later scenarios were based. Significantly, many of the show&#x27;s plot devices were recycled in the enormously successful &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; (Toei, 1992–1997) – indeed, two later episodes of &quot;Megu-chan&quot; were directed by Yuji Endo, who later became one of the chief episode directors on &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; – and echoes of Meg&#x27;s tempestuous rivalries can be perceived in seinen parodies such as the &quot;Project A-Ko&quot; franchise. The &quot;fan service&quot; angle would turn up again in countless other future series, such as Gainax&#x27;s &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;.

The program&#x27;s impact on Japanese popular culture should not be underestimated; thematic descendants include the entire magical girl genre, along with some degree of bishōjo, lolicon and hentai material. &quot;Megu&#x27;s&quot; effect on Japan&#x27;s burgeoning manga industry has yet to be documented, but considering the vast number of shōjo titles currently available, it is safe to assume that &quot;Majokko Megu-Chan&#x27;s&quot; animated adventures must have inspired at least a few of them.

==International distribution and reception==
The series gained moderate recognition after it reached the European market (with the heroine&#x27;s name Anglicized to Meg in the French dub, and changed to Bia in the Italian, Portuguese, and Polish versions), but remains largely unknown in the English-speaking world, as it has never been officially translated into English.

The show also received a Spanish dub for the Latin American market, under the name of &quot;Maggie, la brujita&quot;. The show, however, had little to no success in the region. It was broadcast in Peru and Venezuela in the early 80s, after which it was never aired again, and currently only a handful of episodes can be found with this dub.

Outside Japan, the series achieved its greatest popularity in Italy in the early 1980s (as &quot;Bia - la sfida della magia&quot;, or &quot;Bia - The Magical Challenge&quot;); however, the Italian dub skipped seven of the 72 episodes (hence the reason why some sources list the series as consisting of only 65 episodes) and also made a few edits for content in the extant episodes. The undubbed episodes were fairly dark, most of them dealing with suicide. The edits made in the Italian version carried over into the Polish and Portuguese versions, which were adapted from the Italian and not from the original Japanese.

==Episodes==
Of the anime&#x27;s 72 episodes, 7 episodes were omitted from international releases and were never broadcast outside of Japan due to their controversial nature.

==Music==
In episode 27, Megu watches Misty Honey from &quot;Cutie Honey&quot; on TV singing the &quot;Cutie Honey&quot; theme. The same vocalist, Yoko Maekawa, performed the theme songs for both &quot;Cutie Honey&quot; and &quot;Megu-chan&quot;.

The series also reused some incidental music from an earlier magical-girl series by Toei, 1970&#x27;s &quot;Mahō no Mako-chan&quot;. Takeo Watanabe composed the music for both series.

<doc id="1041421" wikidata="Q280136" url="?curid=1041421" title="Iron sights">
<text>Iron sights are a system of physical alignment markers used as a sighting device to assist the accurate aiming of ranged weapons such as firearms, airguns, crossbows, and bows, or less commonly as a primitive finder sight for optical telescopes. Iron sights, which are typically made of metal, are the earliest and simplest type of sighting device. Since iron sights neither magnify nor illuminate the target, they rely completely on the viewer&#x27;s naked eye and the available light by which the target is visible. In this respect, iron sights are distinctly different from optical sight designs that employ optical manipulation or active illumination, such as telescopic sights, reflector (reflex) sights, holographic sights, and laser sights.

Iron sights are typically composed of two components mounted perpendicularly above the weapon&#x27;s bore axis: a &#x27;rear sight&#x27; nearer (or &#x27;proximal&#x27;) to the shooter&#x27;s eye, and a &#x27;front sight&#x27; farther forward (or &#x27;distal&#x27;) near the muzzle. During aiming, the shooter aligns their line of sight past a gap at the center of the rear sight and towards the top edge of the front sight. When the shooter&#x27;s line of sight, the iron sights, and target are all aligned, a &#x27;line of aim&#x27; that points straight at the target has been created.

Front sights vary in design but are often a small post, bead, ramp, or ring. There are two main types of rear iron sight: &#x27;open sights&#x27;, which use an unenclosed notch, and &#x27;aperture sights&#x27;, which use a circular hole. Nearly all handguns, as well as most civilian, hunting, and police long guns, feature open sights. By contrast, many military service rifles employ aperture sights.

The earliest and simplest iron sights were fixed and could not be easily adjusted. Many modern iron sights are designed to be adjustable for sighting in firearms by adjusting the sights for elevation or windage. On many firearms it is the rear sight that is adjustable.

For precision shooting applications such as varminting or sniping, the iron sights are usually replaced by a telescopic sight. Iron sights may still be fitted alongside other sighting devices (or in the case of some models of optics, incorporated integrally) for back-up usage, if the primary sights are damaged or lost.

== Principles ==
 

In the case of firearms, where the projectile follows a curved ballistic trajectory below the bore axis, the only way to ensure it will hit an intended target is by aiming at the precise point on the trajectory at that target&#x27;s intended distance. To do that, the shooter aligns their line of sight with the front and rear sights, forming a consistent &#x27;line of aim&#x27; (known as the &#x27;sight axis&#x27;) and in turn producing what is known as the &#x27;point of aim&#x27; (POA) within their own field of view, which then gets pointed directly (i.e. aimed) at the target. The physical distance between the front and rear sights is known as the &#x27;sight radius&#x27;, the longer of which produces smaller angular errors when aiming.

&quot;Sighting in&quot; is a process in which the sight axis is adjusted to intersect the trajectory of the bullet at a designated distance (typically at 100 yards/meters), in order to produce a pre-determined &quot;point of impact&quot; (POI) at that distance, known as a &quot;zero&quot;. Using that &quot;zero&quot; as a default reference, the point of aim can be readily re-calibrated to superimpose with the bullet&#x27;s point of impact when shooting at different distances. Modern iron sights can all provide some horizontal and vertical adjustments for sighting-in, and often have elevation markings that allow the shooter to quickly compensate (though with rather limited precision) for increasing bullet drops at extended distances. Because the sight axis (which is a straight line) and the projectile trajectory (which is a parabolic curve) must be within the same vertical plane to have any chance of intersecting, it will be very difficult to shoot accurately if the sights are not perpendicularly above the gun barrel (a situation known as canting) when aiming or sighting-in.

Rear sights on long guns (such as rifles and carbines) are usually mounted on a dovetail slot on the back part of the barrel or the receiver, closer to the eye of the shooter, allowing for easy visual pick-up of the notch. Front sights are mounted to the front end of the barrel by dovetailing, soldering, screwing, or staking very close to the muzzle, frequently on a &quot;ramp&quot;. Some front sight assemblies include a detachable hood intended to reduce glare, and if the hood is circular, then this provides a reference where the eye will naturally align one within the other.

In the case of handguns, the rear sight will be mounted on the frame (for revolvers, derringers, and single-shots) or on the slide (for semi-automatic pistols). Exceptions are possible depending on the type of handgun, e.g. the rear sight on a snub-nose revolver is typically a trench milled into the top strap of the frame, and the front sight is the to-be-expected blade. Certain handguns may have the rear sight mounted on a hoop-like bracket that straddles the slide.

With typical blade- or post-type iron sights, the shooter would center the front sight&#x27;s post in the notch of the rear sight and the tops of both sights should be level. Since the eye is only capable of focusing on one focal plane at a time, and the rear sight, front sight and target are all in separate planes, only one of those three planes can be in focus. Which plane is in focus depends on the type of sight, and one of the challenges to a shooter is to keep the focus on the correct plane to allow for best sight alignment. The general advice, however, is to focus on the front sight.

Due to parallax, even a tiny error in the angle of sight alignment results in a trajectory that diverges from the target on a trajectory directly relative to the distance from the target, causing the bullet to miss the target; for example, with a 10 meter air rifle shooter trying to hit the 10 ring, which is merely a diameter dot on the target at and with a diameter pellet, an error of only in sight alignment can mean a complete miss (a point of impact miss). At , that same misalignment would be magnified 100 times, giving an error of over , 1,500 times the sight misalignment. Increasing the sight radius helps to reduce eventual angular errors and will, in case the sight has an incremental adjustment mechanism, adjust in smaller increments when compared to a further identical shorter sighting line. With the front sight on the front end of the barrel, sight radius may be increased by moving the rear sight from the barrel onto the receiver or tang.

Sights for shotguns used for shooting small, moving targets (such as skeet shooting, trap shooting, and clay pigeon shooting) work quite differently. The rear sight is completely discarded, and the rear reference point is provided by the correct and consistent positioning of the shooter&#x27;s head. A brightly colored (generally the bead is made of a polished metal such as brass and silver, or a plastic fluorescent material, such as green and orange) round bead is placed at the end of the barrel. Often, this bead will be placed along a raised, flat &quot;rib&quot;, which is usually ventilated to keep it cool and reduce mirage effects from a hot barrel. Rather than being aimed like a rifle or handgun, the shotgun is pointed with the focus always on the target, and the unfocused image of the barrel and bead are placed below the target (the amount below depends on whether the target is rising or falling) and slightly ahead of the target if there is lateral movement. This method of aiming is not as precise as that of a front sight/rear sight combination, but it is much faster, and the wide spread of shots can allow an effective hit even if there is some aiming error. Some shotguns also provide a &quot;mid-bead&quot;, which is a smaller bead located halfway down the rib, which allows more feedback on barrel alignment. Some shotguns may also come equipped with rifle-style sights. These types of sights are typically found on shotguns intended for turkey hunting.

== Types ==
=== Open sights ===

Open sights generally are used where the rear sight is at significant distance from the shooter&#x27;s eye. They provide minimum occlusion of the shooter&#x27;s view, but at the expense of precision. Open sights generally use either a square post or a bead on a post for a front sight. To use the sight, the post or bead is positioned both vertically and horizontally in the center of the rear sight notch. For a center hold, the front sight is positioned on the center of the target, bisecting the target vertically and horizontally. For a 6 o&#x27;clock hold, the front sight is positioned just below the target and centered horizontally. A 6 o&#x27;clock hold is only good for a known target size at a known distance and will not hold zero without user adjustment if these factors are varied. From the shooter&#x27;s point of view, there should be a noticeable space between each side of the front sight and the edges of the notch; the spaces are called &quot;light bars&quot;, and the brightness of the light bars provides the shooter feedback as to the alignment of the post in the notch. Vertical alignment is done by lining up the top of the front post with the top of the rear sight, or by placing the bead just above the bottom of the V or U-notch. If the post is not centered in the V or U notch, the shot will not be accurate. If the post extends over the V or U-notch it will result in a high shot. If the post does not reach the top of the V or U-notch it will result in a low shot.

&quot;Patridge&quot; sights, named after inventor E. E. Patridge, a 19th-century American sportsman, consist of a square or rectangular post and a flat-bottomed square notch and are the most common form of open sights, being preferred for target shooting, as the majority of shooters find the vertical alignment is more precise than other open sights. &quot;V-notch&quot; and &quot;U-notch&quot; sights are a variant of the patridge which substitute a V- or U-shaped rear notch.

Other common open sight types include the &quot;buckhorn&quot;, &quot;semi-buckhorn&quot;, and &quot;express&quot;. Buckhorn sights have extensions protruding from either side of the rear sight forming a large ring which almost meets directly above the &quot;V&quot; of the notch. The semi-buckhorn is similar but has a wider gently curving notch with the more precise &quot;V&quot; at its center and is standard on classic Winchester and Marlin lever-action rifles. Express sights are most often used on heavy caliber rifles intended for the hunting of dangerous big game, and are in the form of a wide and large &quot;V&quot; with a heavy white contrast line marking its bottom and a big white or gold bead front sight. These sights do not occlude the target as much as some other styles which is useful in the case of a charging animal. In cases where the range is close and speed far outweighs accuracy (e.g. the shooter is being charged by dangerous big-game), the front sight is used like a shotgun bead; the rear sight is ignored, and the bead is placed on the target. When more time is available, the bead is placed in the &quot;V&quot; of the rear sight.

Open sights have many advantages: they are very common, inexpensive to produce, uncomplicated to use, sturdy, lightweight, resistant to severe environmental conditions, and they do not require batteries. On the other hand, they are not as precise as other forms of sights, and are difficult or impossible to adjust. Open sights also take much more time to use—the buckhorn type is the slowest, patridge, &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; type notch sights are only a bit quicker; only the express sight is relatively fast. In addition, open sights tend to block out the lower portion of the shooter&#x27;s field of view by nature, and because of the depth of field limitations of the human eye, do not work as well for shooters with less than perfect vision.

==== Shotgun sights ====
Among those utilizing shotguns for hunting of upland game, directing a shotgun toward its target is considered a slightly different skill than aiming a rifle or pistol. Shotgunners are encouraged to &quot;point&quot; a shotgun versus the accurate aiming of a rifle. Some even espouse a mentality that eliminates the concept of &quot;aim&quot; altogether. Because much of shotgunning involves putting a scatter pattern in the path of moving targets, the concept of a sight is considered a subconscious aid. The front sight of a shotgun is a small spherical &quot;bead&quot; attached to the muzzle, acts as a reference, while the &quot;rear sight&quot; is nothing more than a narrow longitudinal groove on the receiver and barrel rib. When shooting, aligning the rear groove with the front bead is not to be consciously considered, as it comprises only a rough reference allowing the shooter to use their natural point of aim to make the shot.

In the tactical environment, where targets aren&#x27;t moving across the visual field as quickly, sights do have a role. For many, a fiberoptic front sight is the preferred sighting reference in conjunction with a rear leaf. In this instance, the shotgun is used more like a rifle, allowing intentionally aimed shots. Some even equip their shotguns with open or aperture sights akin to a rifle.

Many shotgun bead sights are designed for a &quot;figure 8&quot; configuration, where a proper sight picture uses a bead mounted at the midpoint of the barrel in conjunction with a front bead mounted toward the muzzle. Many shotgun manufacturers, such as Browning, calibrate these sighting systems to produce a shotgun pattern that is &quot;dead-on&quot; when the front bead is stacked just above the mid-bead, producing the figure-8 sight picture.

=== Aperture sights ===

Aperture sights, also known as &quot;peep sights&quot;, range from the &quot;ghost ring&quot; sight, whose thin ring blurs to near invisibility (hence &quot;ghost&quot;), to target aperture sights that use large disks or other occluders with pinhole-sized apertures. In general, the thicker the ring, the more precise the sight, and the thinner the ring, the faster the sight.

The theory of operation behind the aperture sight is often stated that the human eye will automatically center the front sight when looking through the rear aperture, thus ensuring accuracy. However, aperture sights are accurate even if the front sight is not centered in the rear aperture due to a phenomenon called parallax suppression. This is because, when the aperture is smaller than the eye&#x27;s pupil diameter, the aperture itself becomes the entrance pupil for the entire optical system of target, front sight post, rear aperture, and eye. As long as the aperture&#x27;s diameter is completely contained within the eye&#x27;s pupil diameter, the exact visual location of the front sight post within the rear aperture ring does not affect the accuracy, and accuracy only starts to degrade slightly due to parallax shift as the aperture&#x27;s diameter begins to encroach on the outside of the eye&#x27;s pupil diameter. An additional benefit to aperture sights is that smaller apertures provide greater depth of field, making the target less blurry when focusing on the front sight.

In low light conditions the parallax suppression phenomenon is markedly better. The depth of field looking through the sight remains the same as in bright conditions. This is in contrast to open sights, where the eye&#x27;s pupil will become wider in low light conditions, meaning a larger aperture and a blurrier target. The downside to this is that the image through an aperture sight is darker than with an open sight.

These sights are used on target rifles of several disciplines and on several military rifles such as the Pattern 1914 Enfield and M1917 Enfield, M1 Garand, the No. 4 series Lee–Enfields, M14 rifle, Stgw 57, G3 and the M16 series of weapons along with several others.
Rifle aperture sights for military combat or hunting arms are not designed for maximal attainable precision like target aperture sights, as these must be usable under suboptimal field conditions.

==== Ghost ring ====

The ghost ring sight is considered by some to be the fastest type of aperture sight. It is fairly accurate, easy to use, and obscures the target less than nearly all other non-optical sights. Because of this, ghost ring sights are commonly installed on riot and combat shotguns and customized handguns, and they are also gaining ground as a backup sighting system on rifles. The ghost ring is a fairly recent innovation, and differs from traditional aperture sights in the extreme thinness of the rear ring and the slightly thicker front sight. The thin ring minimizes the occlusion of the target, while the thicker front post makes it easy to find quickly. Factory Mossberg ghost ring sights also have thick steel plates on either side of the extremely thin ring. These are to protect the sight&#x27;s integrity in cases where, if the shotgun were to fall and impact a surface in a way that could potentially damage or distort the shape of the ring.

==== Target aperture sights ====


Target aperture sights are designed for maximum precision. The rear sight element (often called &quot;diopter&quot;) is usually a large disk (up to 1 inch or 2.5 cm in diameter) with a small hole in the middle, of approximately or less, and is placed close to the shooter&#x27;s eye. High end target diopters normally accept accessories like adjustable diopter aperture and optical filter systems to ensure optimal sighting conditions for match shooters. Typical modern target shooting diopters offer windage and elevation corrections in to increments at . Some International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) (Olympic) shooting events require this precision level for sighting lines, since the final score of the top competitors last shots series is expressed in tenths of scoring ring points.

The complementing front sight element may be a simple bead or post, but is more often a &quot;globe&quot;-type sight, which consists of a cylinder with a threaded cap, which allows differently shaped removable front sight elements to be used. Most common are posts of varying widths and heights or rings of varying diameter—these can be chosen by the shooter for the best fit to the target being used. Tinted transparent plastic insert elements may also be used, with a hole in the middle; these work the same way as an opaque ring, but provide a less obstructed view of the target. High end target front sight tunnels normally also accept accessories like adjustable aperture and optical systems to ensure optimal sighting conditions for match shooters. Some high end target sight line manufacturers also offer front sights with integrated aperture mechanisms.

The use of round rear and front sighting elements for aiming at round targets, like used in ISSF match shooting, takes advantage of the natural ability of the eye and brain to easily align concentric circles. Even for the maximum precision, there should still be a significant area of white visible around the bullseye and between the front and rear sight ring (if a front ring is being used). Since the best key to determining center is the amount of light passing through the apertures, a narrow, dim ring of light can actually be more difficult to work with than a larger, brighter ring. The precise sizes are quite subjective, and depend on both shooter preference and ambient lighting, which is why target rifles come with easily replaceable front sight inserts, and adjustable aperture mechanisms.

=== Front aperture size selection ===
Front aperture size is a compromise between a tight enough aperture to clearly define the aiming point and a loose enough aperture so as to not cause &#x27;flicker&#x27;. When the aperture is too small, the boundary between the target and front aperture outline becomes indistinct, requiring the shooter to consciously or subconsciously generate small eye movements to measure the distance around the target. USA Shooting recommends a front aperture that creates at least 3 Minutes of Angle (MOA) of boundary space. In research performed by Precision Shooting, it was found that this increased shooter confidence, reduced hold times, and created more decisive shots. There may be an upper bound to the front aperture size that improves performance, however. In 2013, researchers performed experiments with the game of golf, specifically the skill of putting which is another skill that combines visual alignment with motor skills. They found that by manipulating the perceived size of the target (the golf hole) by surrounding it with concentric rings of various sizes, there was a phenomenon that improved performance when the target was surrounded by smaller circles thereby increasing its perceived size. They found that when the target was perceived as larger, performance increased.

==== Non-target aperture sights ====

Aperture sights on military rifles use a larger aperture with a thinner ring, and generally a simple post front sight.

Rifles from the late 19th century often featured one of two types of aperture sight called a &quot;tang sight&quot; or a &quot;ladder sight&quot;. Since the black powder used in muzzleloaders and early cartridges was not capable of propelling a bullet at high speed, these sights had very large ranges of vertical adjustments, often on the order of several degrees, allowing very long shots to be made accurately. The .45-70 cartridge, for example, was tested by the military for accuracy at ranges of up to , which required 3 degrees of elevation. Both ladder and tang sights folded down when not in use to reduce the chance of damage to the sights. Ladder sights were mounted on the barrel, and could be used as sights in both the folded and unfolded states. Tang sights were mounted behind the action of the rifle, and provided a very long sight radius, and had to be unfolded for use, though rifles with tang sights often had open sights as well for close range use. Tang sights often had vernier scales, allowing adjustment down to a single minute of arc over the full range of the sight.

=== Flip up sights ===
Assault rifles and sporterized semi-automatic rifles can have foldable rear and front sight elements that can be readily flipped up or down by the user. Such iron sights are often used as secondary sighting systems in case the main weapon sight (typically an optical sight such as a telescopic sight or red dot sight) malfunctions or becomes unsuitable for the tactical situation at hand, and are therefore referred to as backup iron sights (BUIS). Backup sights are usually mounted via Rail Integration Systems (most often Picatinny rails) in tandem with optical aiming devices, although &quot;offset&quot; BUISs that are mounted obliquely from the bore axis also exist. When used with non-magnifying optics (e.g. reflex or holographic sights), the flip-up rear and front elements often are designed to appear in the same sight picture, known as &quot;cowitnessing&quot;, as the primary optical sights.

== Adjustment ==

Fixed sights are sights that are not adjustable. For instance, on many revolvers, the rear sight consists of a fixed sight that is a groove milled into the top of the gun&#x27;s receiver. Adjustable sights are designed to be adjustable for different ranges, for the effect of wind, or to compensate for varying cartridge bullet weights or propellant loadings, which alter the round&#x27;s velocity and external ballistics and thus its trajectory and point of impact. Sight adjustments are orthogonal, so the windage can be adjusted without impacting the elevation, and vice versa. If the firearm is held canted instead of level when fired, the adjustments are no longer orthogonal, so it is essential to keep the firearm level for best accuracy.

The downside to adjustable sights is the inherent fragility of the moving parts. A fixed sight is a solid piece of metal, usually steel, and if firmly attached to the gun, little is going to be able to damage it beyond usefulness. Adjustable sights, on the other hand, are bulkier, and have parts that must move relative to the gun. Solid impact on an adjustable sight will usually knock it out of adjustment, if not knock it right off the gun. Because of this, guns for self defense or military use either have fixed sights, or sights with &quot;wings&quot; on the sides for protection (such as those on the M4 carbine).

Iron sights used for hunting guns tend to be a compromise. They will be adjustable, but only with tools—generally either a small screwdriver or an Allen wrench. They will be compact and heavily built, and designed to lock securely into position. Target sights, on the other hand, are much bulkier and easier to adjust. They generally have large knobs to control horizontal and vertical movement without tools, and often they are designed to be quickly and easily detachable from the gun so they can be stored separately in their own protective case.

The most common is a rear sight that adjusts in both directions, though military rifles often have a &quot;tangent sight&quot; in the rear, which a slider on the rear sight has pre-calibrated elevation adjustments for different ranges. With tangent sights, the rear sight is often used to adjust the elevation, and the front the windage. The M16A2 later M16 series rifles have a dial adjustable range calibrated rear sight, and use an elevation adjustable front sight to &quot;zero&quot; the rifle at a given range. The rear sight is used for windage adjustment and to change the zero range.

== Enhancements ==
While iron sights are very simple, that simplicity also leads to a staggering variety of different implementations. In addition to the purely geometric considerations of the front blade and rear notch, there are some factors that need to be considered when choosing a set of iron sights for a particular purpose.

=== Glare reduction ===
Glare, particularly from the front sight, can be a significant problem with iron sights. The glare from the front sight can increase the apparent brightness of the light bar on one side of the sight, causing windage errors in aiming, or lower the apparent height of the front sight, causing elevation errors in aiming. Since the direction of the ambient light is rarely constant for a shooter, the resulting changing glare can significantly affect the point of aim.

The most common solution to the problem of glare is a matte finish on the sights. Serrating or bead blasting the sight is a common solution for brightly finished sights, such as blued steel or stainless steel. Matte finishes such as parkerizing or matte black paint can also help. &quot;Smoking&quot; a sight by holding a match or cigarette lighter under the sight to deposit a fine layer of soot is a technique used by many shooters, and special soot-producing lighters are sold for use by competition shooters. Even a thin layer of mud or dirt applied to the sight will help kill the glare, as long as the coating is thin and consistent enough not to change the shape of the sights.

Many target sights are designed with vertical or even undercut front sight blades, which reduces the angles at which light will produce glare off the sight—the downside of these sights is that they tend to snag on clothing, branches, and other materials, so they are common only on target guns. Sight hoods reduce the chances of snagging an undercut sight and are common on some types of rifles, particularly lever-action rifles, but they are prohibited in some shooting disciplines.

=== Contrast enhancements ===

While target shooters generally prefer a matte black finish to their sights, to reduce the chance of glare and increase the contrast between the sights and the light bars, black sights don&#x27;t offer good visibility with dark targets or in low light conditions, such as those often encountered in hunting, military, or self-defense situations. A variety of different contrast enhancements to the basic Patridge type sight and others have been developed to address this deficiency. The contrast enhancement of the front sight has to be somewhat larger compared to the contrast enhancement(s) used for the rear sight if all contrast enhancements should appear about equally large from the shooters perspective.

; Three-dot: On semi-automatic handguns, the most common type of enhancement is a bright white dot painted on the front sight near the top of the blade, and a dot on each side of the rear sight notch. In low lighting conditions the front sight dot is centered horizontally between the rear sight dots, with the target placed above the middle (front) dot. Some sight vendors offer differently colored dots for the front and rear sights.
; White outline rear: A contrast variation which uses a dot front sight with a thick and bright white outline around the rear sight notch.
; Straight eight: Heinie Specialty Products produces a variant of high visibility sights in which a single dot front sight and a rear notch with a dot below can be lined up vertically to form a figure eight.
; Sight inserts: Popular on revolvers, this enhancement consists of a colored plastic insert in the front sight blade, usually red or orange in color.
; Bar / dot or express sight: Similar to the straight eight type, this type of sight is traditional on express rifles and is also found on some handguns. The open, V-shaped rear allows for faster acquisition and wider field of view, though less accurate for longer range precision type shooting. The dot on the front sight is aligned or set directly above the vertical bar on the rear sight, commonly referred to as &quot;dotting the &#x27;I&#x27;&quot;.
; Gold bead: Preferred by many competitors in IPSC and IDPA shooting.
; Night sights: On tactical firearms, the contrast enhancements can consist of small vials containing tritium gas whose radioactive decay causes a fluorescent material to glow. Self-luminous tritium sights provide vital visibility in extremely low light situations where normal sights would be degraded or even useless. The tritium glow is not noticeable in bright conditions such as daylight however. As a result, some manufacturers have started to integrate fiber optic sights with tritium vials to provide bright, high-contrast firearms sights in both bright and dim conditions.
; Fiber optic: A growing trend, started on air rifles and muzzleloaders, is the use of short pieces of optical fiber for the dots, made in such a way that ambient light falling on the length of the fiber is concentrated at the tip, making the dots slightly brighter than the surroundings. This method is most commonly used in front sights, but many makers offer sights that use fiber optics on front and rear sights. Fiber optic sights can now be found on handguns, rifles, and shotguns, both as aftermarket accessories and a growing number of factory guns.

<text>The [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|Borough]] of Ogwr was one of six districts of Mid Glamorgan in Wales, which existed from 1974 to 1996.

==History==
It was formed under the Local Government Act 1972 from the urban districts of Bridgend, Maesteg, Ogmore and Garw and Porthcawl, along with Penybont Rural District from the administrative county of Glamorgan. The district took its name from the Welsh name of the main river through the district, the River Ogmore ().

In 1996 most of Ogwr became part of Bridgend County Borough, with the Vale of Glamorgan taking the communities of Wick, St Brides Major and Ewenny.

==Ogwr Borough Council==
Ogwr Borough Council was a second tier district council of Mid Glamorgan. County councillors were elected from the borough to Mid Glamorgan County Council.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 1996 was held by the following parties:

Ogwr Borough Council comprised 58 councillors at its first elections in 1973, elected from 25 wards. The final full elections were in May 1991.

===Premises===

When the council was created in 1974 it was initially based at new offices called the Municipal Buildings, which had been built as part of The Rhiw shopping centre on Queen Street in Bridgend. In 1986 it moved to a new building called the Civic Offices on Angel Street in Bridgend, on the banks of the river which gave the district its name. Following the council&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the Civic Offices became the headquarters for the new Bridgend County Borough Council.

<doc id="1041423" wikidata="Q3405406" url="?curid=1041423" title="World Fantasy Award—Short Fiction">
<text>The World Fantasy Awards are given each year by the World Fantasy Convention for the best fantasy fiction published in English during the previous calendar year. The awards have been described by book critics such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;prestigious fantasy prize&quot;, and one of the three most prestigious speculative fiction awards, along with the Hugo and Nebula Awards (which cover both fantasy and science fiction). The World Fantasy Award—Short Fiction is given each year for fantasy short stories published in English. A work of fiction is defined by the organization as short fiction if it is 10,000 words or less in length; awards are also given out for longer pieces in the Novel and Novella categories. The Short Fiction category has been awarded annually since 1975, though before 1982—when the category was instated—it was named &quot;Best Short Fiction&quot; and covered works of up to 40,000 words. It was then renamed &quot;Best Short Story&quot; until 2016, when it was renamed to the &quot;Short Fiction&quot; category.

World Fantasy Award nominees and winners are decided by attendees and judges at the annual World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which has the power to break ties. The final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention at the end of October. Winners were presented with a statue in the form of a bust of H. P. Lovecraft through the 2015 awards; more recent winners receive a statuette of a tree.

During the 50 nomination years, 184 authors have had works nominated; 51 of them have won, including ties and co-authors. Only five authors have won more than once: Ramsey Campbell and James Blaylock with two wins out of four nominations each, Stephen King won two out of three, and Tanith Lee and Fred Chappell won both times they were nominated. Of authors who have won at least once, Jeffrey Ford and Kelly Link have the most nominations at five, followed by Dennis Etchison and Avram Davidson, who along with Campbell and Blaylock received four nominations. Charles de Lint has the most nominations without winning at five; he is followed by Michael Swanwick, who has had four nominations without winning.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the work was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.

<doc id="1041425" wikidata="Q1158503" url="?curid=1041425" title="MC Frontalot">
<text>Damian Alexander Hess (born December 3, 1973), better known by his stage name MC Frontalot, is an American rapper and web designer. He is widely credited as a pioneer of the nerdcore hip hop genre, blending elements of hip hop with themes from nerd culture.

==Career==

===Early days===
Hess began releasing music as MC Frontalot in 1999. He gained early recognition through Song Fight!, an online songwriting and recording competition, where he consistently outperformed competitors. Although he has entered only seven songs under the name MC Frontalot, he has never lost a competition. One notable entry, &quot;Romantic Cheapskate,&quot; received 614 votes, far surpassing the next closest competitor with 28 votes. In this song, Frontalot metaphorically compares Song Fight! to a neglected lover who remains loyal despite his indifference.

In 2000, Frontalot released &quot;Nerdcore Hiphop,&quot; which gained popularity in the geek and nerd communities. The rap subgenre of nerdcore, which had been developing among various performers, adopted the title and has since expanded rapidly. Although Hess is often considered the founder of nerdcore, he notes on his website that other early artists also deserve credit. His first studio album, &quot;Nerdcore Rising&quot;, was released on August 27, 2005. The album featured six new songs and ten remixed tracks, with some new material produced by artists from Song Fight!, including indie rock and hip-hop artist Doctor Popular.

===Spotlight===
On March 18, 2002, the popular webcomic &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; named Frontalot their rapper laureate, significantly boosting his popularity. This recognition led to regular performances at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX), where he became a fixture from 2004 until 2013. 

In 2004, 2 songs from MC Frontalot were featured on Roxor Games &quot;In the Groove&quot;, Which MC Was That, and PA Theme (Penny Arcade Theme on the PC/Mac version of In The Groove). 

In 2006, Frontalot wrote and performed &quot;Living At the Corner of Dude and Catastrophe,&quot; a song based on the webcomic Achewood. This track became the webcomic&#x27;s theme song and was later included as a downloadable track for the video game Rock Band in 2008. Around the same time, he appeared on the Baddd Spellah track &quot;Rhyme of the Nibelung,&quot; which won CBC Radio 2&#x27;s Remix the Ring contest. Frontalot&#x27;s track &quot;Final Boss&quot; was featured over the end credits of the video game &quot;Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness&quot; in 2008. Throughout his career, he made occasional appearances in the webcomic &quot;Overcompensating&quot; by Jeffrey Rowland, and was featured in commercials for G4 TV. He also appeared on the show &quot;Freestyle 101,&quot; where he performed parts of his songs with freestyle lines connecting them. 

In 2009, Frontalot&#x27;s song &quot;Origin of Species,&quot; a satirical take on Creation Science, was included as downloadable content for Rock Band during the Penny Arcade Expo. Im 2010, a few magazine articles suggested that nerdcore could be perceived as &quot;racist&quot; if the genre did not pay omage to main hip-hop&#x27;s origin; that it would somehow erase black people from existence (even though zero black people died). With the release of his fourth album &quot;Zero Day&quot;, MC Frontally released a commentary in the title track, stating that he has ready begun the genre and it won&#x27;t be retracted now. The record was ultimately praised for connecting hacking and tech crises with rap’s cultural dynamics, showcasing Hess’s exploration of digital theft amid the genre’s debates on innovation and appropriation.

===Live performances===

Although most of his fanbase is online, Hess gave a handful of live performances while living in San Francisco, and several more after moving to New York City. His first official tour started on May 12, 2006, with shows mostly in the Southeastern United States. When he performs, he plays with a full ensemble, including keyboardist and frequent collaborator Gminor7, bassist Blak Lotus, and drummer The SturGENiUS. Other occasional band members include G.LATINusKY00B, The Categorical Imperative, Vic 20, and 56K. 

Hess completed a tour with Schäffer the Darklord in November 2007 and began another tour in November 2008 with MC Lars and YTCracker. As of June 2010, he has been touring with alternative rock musicians Wheatus on their UK leg of their 10th anniversary tour, occasionally providing guest vocals and performing with Wheatus on some of his tracks.

===Film and television===
Hess starred as &quot;TP Factory Rapper&quot; in the Sesame Street direct-to-video movie &quot;Elmo&#x27;s Potty Time&quot;.

&quot;Nerdcore Rising&quot; is a documentary/concert film starring Hess and various other nerdcore artists such as MC Chris, Optimus Rhyme, and MC Lars, with contributions from &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, Prince Paul, and Brian Posehn. The film, directed and produced by Negin Farsad, premiered at the 2008 South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. It combines interviews about nerdcore and its origins with footage of Frontalot&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Nerdcore Rising&quot; national tour.

Hess was interviewed in Alexandre O. Philippe&#x27;s documentary, &quot;The People vs. George Lucas&quot;, which premiered at the 2010 South by Southwest Film Festival. Hess attended the festival as a musician and panelist.

Hess made an appearance as a judge on the sixth episode of the first season of TBS&#x27;s King of the Nerds, which originally aired on February 21, 2013.

==Musical influences==
Much of Hess&#x27;s early music features samples from other artists&#x27; works, often using music from well-known artists such as Paul Simon, They Might Be Giants, James Brown, and Fiona Apple. One example of this is the song &quot;Good Old Clyde,&quot; which comments on and uses the popular &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; drum break by Clyde Stubblefield.

Since beginning to sell his albums commercially, Hess has collaborated on nearly all his tracks with Baddd Spellah, an electronic musician and hip-hop producer, and Gaby &#x27;Gminor7&#x27; Alter, a composer and keyboardist whose playing forms the basis for many of Frontalot&#x27;s earlier songs. Hess has also worked with other rappers such as MC Hawking and Canadian rapper Jesse Dangerously.

<text>The serial verb construction, also known as (verb) serialization or verb stacking, is a syntactic phenomenon in which two or more verbs or verb phrases are strung together in a single clause. It is a common feature of many African, Asian and New Guinean languages. Serial verb constructions are often described as coding a single event; they can also be used to indicate concurrent or causally-related events.

== Uses ==
The terms &quot;serial verbs&quot;, &quot;serialization&quot;, etc. are used by different authors to denote somewhat different sets of constructions. There are also differences in how the constructions are analyzed, in terms of both syntax and semantics.

In general, a structure described as a serial verb construction will consist either of two (or possibly more) consecutive verbs or of two or more consecutive verb phrases in which each verb may have its own object and possibly other modifiers. There will usually be no marking, by means of affixes or subordinating conjunctions, that one verb is dependent on the other, and they will not be linked by coordinating conjunctions. Some linguists insist that serial verbs cannot be dependent on each other; however, if a language does not mark dependent verbs with affixation, it can be hard to determine whether any dependency relation exists when verbs appear in sequence.

Serial verbs normally denote actions that are closely connected and can be considered to be part of the same event. They may be actions taking place simultaneously, or one may represent the cause, purpose or result of the other. In most cases, the serial verbs in a sequence are understood to share the same subject.

Certain expressions resembling serial verb construction are found in English (surviving from Early Modern English), such as &quot;let&#x27;s go eat and come live with me&quot;. In such constructions, the second verb would normally be regarded as a bare infinitive (and can generally be replaced by a &quot;full&quot; infinitive by the insertion of &quot;to&quot; before it).

== Examples with consecutive verbs ==

The next sentence in Persian contains 19 consecutive verbs: 

which means, &quot;I was heading and I saw she/he is sitting, I thought to ask to see whether he would come or wouldn&#x27;t come, I figure out &quot;I don&#x27;t want to come, and I want to go get some sleep&quot; he said!&quot;

The following example of serialization comes from the Nupe language from Nigeria:

The two verbs &quot;bé&quot; and &quot;lá&quot; appear consecutively, with no linking word (like &quot;and&quot;) or anything else to indicate that one verb is subordinate to the other. The subject, &quot;Musa&quot;, is understood to apply to both verbs. In this example, the second verb also has a direct object. Note that in the English version given, the second verb is translated by an infinitive, &quot;to take&quot;, which is marked as subordinate to the first verb.

Depending on the language, the shared subject may be marked on both verbs or only one. In most of the examples, it is marked only once. However, in the following example from the Baré, in the Upper Amazon, the first person singular subject (&quot;I&quot;) is marked twice:

A similar construction is also found in most varieties of dialectal Arabic. The following example is from Lebanese Arabic:

As a rule, serial verbs cannot be marked independently for categories such as tense, aspect and mood. Either all of the verbs are marked for the same features, or a sole marker is shared by all of them. In the Hindi &quot;&quot; (literally, phone pick-up say (PAST)), &quot;picked up the phone and said&quot;, only the second verb is marked as past tense, but both are understood to refer to the past. In the following example, from the West African Ewe, both verbs appear in their perfective form:

In Japanese, two verbs may come together with the first verb in the continuative form (), as in (&quot;push through&quot;), in which &quot;oshi&quot; is the continuative form of &quot;osu&quot; (&quot;push&quot;), and &quot;tōru&quot; (&quot;get through&quot;) is a finite form whose present tense and indicative mood are understood to apply to &quot;oshi&quot;. Similarly, (&quot;jump in&quot;) in which &quot;tobi&quot; is from &quot;tobu&quot; (&quot;jump&quot;), and &quot;komu&quot; means &quot;go in&quot;; (&quot;be completed&quot;), where &quot;deki&quot; is from &quot;dekiru&quot; (&quot;be able to be done&quot;) and &quot;agaru&quot; means &quot;rise, be offered&quot;. No arguments can come between the two verbs in this construction (in contrast to those described in the following section).

In the case of negation, only one negator can be applied to the whole serial construction, as in the following Baré example:

In Chinese, as in Southeast Asian languages, when a transitive verb is followed by an intransitive verb, the object of the combined verb may be understood as the object of the first verb and the subject of the second: &quot;the tiger bit Zhang to death&quot;, where &quot;Zhang&quot; is understood as the direct object of &quot;yǎo&quot; (&quot;bite&quot;) but as the subject of &quot;sǐ&quot; (&quot;die&quot;). In the equivalent construction in Hindi, the one who dies would be the tiger, not Zhang. (See Chinese grammar for more.)

In the following example from Maonan, a language spoken in southwestern China, up to ten verbs co-occur in a sentence coding a single event without any linking words, coordinating conjunctions or any other markings:

== Examples with intervening elements between verbs ==
In some languages that have verb serialization, the verbs must appear consecutively with nothing intervening. In other languages, however, it is possible for arguments, normally the object of one of the verbs, to come in between the serialized verbs. The resulting construction is a sequence of verb phrases rather than of plain verbs. The following example is from the Nigerian Yoruba:

The object of the first verb intervenes between the verbs, resulting in two consecutive verb phrases, the first meaning &quot;took the book&quot;, the second &quot;came&quot;. As before, the subject (&quot;he&quot; in this case) is understood to apply to both verbs. The combined action of taking the book and coming can be translated as &quot;bringing&quot; the book.

A serial verb construction may be used to introduce an actant (&quot;money&quot; in the following example, from Akan of West Africa): 

In Japanese also, strings of verb phrases can be created, often denoting events that are related causally or in time. Such strings may be translated into English by using &quot;and&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, &quot;(in order) to&quot; or other connectives, but some may have a more compact translation, as in the following example (from Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Mononoke Hime&quot;) in which the actions of &quot;following&quot; and &quot;coming&quot; are simultaneous:

== Contrast with compound verbs ==
A distinction is sometimes made between serial verbs and compound verbs (also known as &quot;complex predicates&quot;). In a compound verb, the first element (verb or noun) generally carries most of the semantic load, while the second element, often called a &quot;vector verb&quot; (light verb) or &quot;explicator verb&quot;, provides fine distinctions (such as speaker attitude or grammatical aspect) and carries the inflection (markers of tense, mood and agreement). The first element may be a verb in conjunctive participle form, as in Hindi and Punjabi. For example, in Hindi, in the second example below, लिया (&quot;liyā&quot;) (from the verb लेना &quot;lenā&quot; &quot;to take&quot;) is a vector verb that indicates a completed action which is done for one&#x27;s own benefit, and खा (&quot;khā&quot;) &quot;eat&quot; is the main or primary verb. In the third example below, डाला (&quot;ḍālā&quot;) (from the verb डालना &quot;ḍālnā&quot; &quot;to put&quot; or &quot;to insert&quot;) is the vector verb, which indicates recklessness, gruesomeness, or an unwanted action. Both खा लिया (&quot;khā liyā&quot;) and खा डाला (&quot;khā ḍālā&quot;) alternate with the corresponding perfective form of the main verb (in this case, खाया &quot;khāyā&quot; &quot;ate&quot;) under partly specifiable semantic and pragmatic conditions.

Negating the compound verbs in the indicative mood usually suppresses the vector verb in favor of their non-compound counterparts. This following sentence makes use of the vector verb लेना (&quot;lenā&quot;) &quot;to take&quot;, which is dropped in the negative: 

However, compound verbs in the subjunctive mood retain the vector verbs when negated.

<doc id="1041429" wikidata="Q585062" url="?curid=1041429" title="Harry Daghlian">
<text>Haroutune Krikor Daghlian Jr. (May 4, 1921 – September 15, 1945) was an American physicist with the Manhattan Project, which designed and produced the atomic bombs that were used in World War II. He accidentally irradiated himself on August 21, 1945, during a critical mass experiment at the remote Omega Site of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico and died 25 days later from the resultant radiation poisoning.

Daghlian was irradiated as a result of a criticality accident that occurred when he accidentally dropped a tungsten carbide brick onto a 6.2 kg bomb core made of plutonium–gallium alloy. This core, subsequently nicknamed the &quot;demon core&quot;, was later involved in the death of another physicist, Louis Slotin.

==Early life and education==
Haroutune Krikor Daghlian Jr., was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, on May 4, 1921, one of three children of Margaret Rose (&quot;née&quot; Currie) and Haroutune Krikor Daghlian. His father was an ethnic Armenian from Gaziantep in what is now Turkey. He had a sister, Helen, and a brother, Edward. Soon after his birth the family moved across state to the coastal town of New London. He was educated at Harbor Elementary School, where he played violin in the school orchestra, and at Bulkeley High School. In 1938, at the age of 17, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, intending to study mathematics, but became interested in physics, particularly particle physics, which was then emerging as an exciting new field. This interest led him to transfer to the West Lafayette, Indiana, campus of Purdue University, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1942. He then commenced work on his doctorate, assisting Marshall Holloway with the cyclotrons. In 1944, while still a graduate student, he joined Otto Frisch&#x27;s Critical Assembly Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory of the Manhattan Project.

==Criticality accident and death==
During an experiment on August 21, 1945, Daghlian was attempting to build a neutron reflector manually by stacking a set of tungsten carbide bricks in an incremental fashion around a plutonium core. The purpose of the neutron reflector was to reduce the mass required for the plutonium core to attain criticality. He was moving the final brick over the assembly, but neutron counters alerted Daghlian to the fact that the addition of that brick would render the system supercritical. As he withdrew his hand, he inadvertently dropped the brick onto the center of the assembly. Since the assembly was nearly in the critical state, the accidental addition of that brick caused the reaction to go immediately into the prompt critical region of neutronic behavior. This resulted in a criticality accident.

Daghlian reacted immediately after dropping the brick and attempted to knock the brick off the assembly without success. He was forced to disassemble part of the tungsten-carbide pile in order to halt the reaction.

Daghlian was estimated to have received a dose of 510 rem (5.1 Sv) of neutron radiation, from a yield of 1016 fissions. Despite intensive medical care, he developed symptoms of severe radiation poisoning, and his sister and mother were flown out to care for him. He fell into a coma and died 25 days after the accident. He was the first known fatality caused by a criticality accident. His body was returned to New London, where he was buried at Cedar Grove Cemetery.

==Legacy==
As a result of the incident, safety regulations for the project were scrutinized and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading to the creation of the Godiva device.

These changes did not prevent another criticality accident from happening at Los Alamos the following year. Louis Slotin, a colleague of Daghlian&#x27;s, was killed in 1946 while performing criticality tests on the same plutonium core. After these two incidents it became known as the &quot;demon core&quot;, and all similar criticality experiments were halted until remote-controlled assembly devices were more fully developed and available.

In 2000, the city of New London erected a memorial stone and flagpole in Calkins Park to honor Daghlian. His surname is misspelled &quot;Daghiian&quot; on the monument. The monument bears an inscription: &quot;though not in uniform, he died in service to his country.&quot;

<text>The World Fantasy Awards are given each year by the World Fantasy Convention for the best fantasy fiction published in English during the previous calendar year. The awards have been described by book critics such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;prestigious fantasy prize&quot;, and one of the three most prestigious speculative fiction awards, along with the Hugo and Nebula Awards (which cover both fantasy and science fiction). The World Fantasy Award—Collection is given each year for collections of fantasy stories by a single author published in English. A collection can have any number of editors, and works in the collection may have been previously published; awards are also given out for anthologies of works by multiple authors in the Anthology category. The Collection category has been awarded annually since 1975, though from 1977 through 1987 anthologies were admissible as nominees. Anthologies were split into a separate category beginning in 1988; during the 10 years they were admissible they won the award 7 times and were 38 of the 56 nominations.

World Fantasy Award nominees and winners are decided by attendees and judges at the annual World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which has the power to break ties. The final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention at the end of October. Winners were presented with a statue in the form of a bust of H. P. Lovecraft through the 2015 awards; more recent winners receive a statuette of a tree.

During the 50 nomination years, 174 writers have had works nominated; 48 of them have won, including ties and co-authors. Only six writers or editors have won more than once. Jeffrey Ford has won the regular collection award three times out of six nominations, while Karen Joy Fowler, Lucius Shepard, and Gene Wolfe won the regular collection award twice, out of two, four, and two nominations, respectively. Charles L. Grant and Kirby McCauley won the award as editors of anthologies while those were eligible; Grant was nominated nine times as an editor and once for a collection, while McCauley won both times he was nominated for anthologies. Grant&#x27;s ten nominations are the most of any writer or editor, followed by Ramsey Campbell, Harlan Ellison, Kelly Link, and Charles de Lint at five, with two of Campbell&#x27;s nominations coming for anthologies. Link has had the most nominations without winning, followed by Peter S. Beagle, Dennis Etchison, Stephen King, Fritz Leiber, and Stuart David Schiff at four; one of Etchison&#x27;s and all of Schiff&#x27;s nominations were for anthologies.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the collection was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the author&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist. If the work was an anthology rather than a collection, the editor&#x27;s name is appended with (editor) to distinguish them from authors of collections.

<text>The Kent and Sharpshooters Yeomanry was a unit of the Territorial Army (&#x27;TA&#x27;) that was established in 1961 as the Kent and County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters). This was achieved through the merger of 297 (Kent Yeomanry) Regiment, Royal Artillery and 3rd/4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters).

==History==
The unit was established in 1961 as the Kent and County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) through the amalgamation of two yeomanry regiments: the 297 (Kent Yeomanry) Regiment, Royal Artillery and the 3rd/4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters). Initially, it served as an armoured reconnaissance regiment until 1967 when the Territorial Army (TA) underwent re-organization. Following the re-organization, the unit was disbanded and reconstituted as three separate units:
*&#x27;C&#x27; Squadron, Royal Yeomanry
*&#x27;R&#x27; Battery, The London and Kent Regiment, Royal Artillery
*&#x27;A&#x27; Company, 8th Battalion, the Queen&#x27;s Regiment

In 1969, the artillery battery was transformed into (265 London &amp; Kent) Squadron, which became a part of 71 (Yeomanry) Signal Regiment of the Royal Signals. In 1971, the squadron was re-designated as 265 (Kent and County of London Yeomanry) Squadron, and in 1987, its lineage was transferred to HQ (Kent and County of London Yeomanry) Squadron, which was also a component of 71 (Yeomanry) Signal Regiment.

==Present day==

Today two squadrons retain the Sharpshooters name:

*&#x27;C&#x27; (Kent and Sharpshooters Yeomanry) Squadron Royal Yeomanry.
* 265 (Kent &amp; County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)) Support Squadron, 71 (City of London) Yeomanry Signal Regiment.
