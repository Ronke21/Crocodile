<text>Major-General Sir Percy Cleghorn Stanley Hobart, (14 June 1885 – 19 February 1957), also known as &quot;Hobo&quot;, was a British military engineer noted for his command of the 79th Armoured Division during the Second World War. He was responsible for many of the specialised armoured vehicles (&quot;Hobart&#x27;s Funnies&quot;) that took part in the invasion of Normandy and later actions.

==Early life==
Hobart was born in Naini Tal, British India, to Robert T. Hobart (of the Indian Civil Service), and Janetta (née Stanley). His mother was born in County Tyrone (Northern Ireland) and lived at Roughan Park, near Newmills, between Cookstown and Dungannon. She married Robert Hobart in Tullaniskin Parish Church, Dungannon, on 7 October 1880.

In his youth, Hobart studied history, painting, literature and church architecture. He was educated at Temple Grove School and Clifton College, and in 1904 he graduated from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and was commissioned into the Royal Engineers. He was first sent to India, but during the First World War he served in France and Mesopotamia (now Iraq). He took part in the Waziristan campaign 1919–1920, when British and Indian Army forces put down unrest in local villages.

Attending the Staff College, Camberley, in 1920, in 1923, foreseeing the predominance of tank warfare, Hobart volunteered to be transferred to the Royal Tank Corps. While there, he gained the nickname &quot;Hobo&quot;, and was greatly influenced by the writings of B. H. Liddell Hart on armoured warfare. He was appointed as an instructor at the Staff College, Quetta, in 1923 where he served until 1927. In November 1928, Hobart married Dorothea Field, the daughter of Colonel C. Field, Royal Marines. They had one daughter. His sister, Elizabeth, married Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.

In 1934, Hobart became brigadier of the first permanent armoured brigade in Britain and Inspector, Royal Tank Corps. He had to fight for resources for his command because the British Army was still dominated by conservative cavalry officers. German General Heinz Guderian kept abreast of Hobart&#x27;s writings using, at his own expense, someone to translate all of Hobart&#x27;s articles being published in Britain.

In 1937, Hobart was made Deputy Director of Staff Duties (Armoured Fighting Vehicles) and later Director of Military Training. He was promoted to major general. In 1938, Hobart was sent to form and train &quot;Mobile Force (Egypt)&quot; although a local general resisted his efforts. While sometimes referred to as the &quot;Mobile Farce&quot; by critics, Mobile Force (Egypt) survived and later became the 7th Armoured Division, famous as the &quot;Desert Rats&quot;.

==Second World War==
General Sir Archibald Wavell dismissed Hobart into retirement in 1940, based on hostile War Office information due to his &quot;unconventional&quot; ideas about armoured warfare. Hobart joined the Local Defence Volunteers (precursor to the Home Guard) as a lance corporal and was charged with the defence of his home town, Chipping Campden. &quot;At once, Chipping Campden became a hedgehog of bristling defiance&quot;, and Hobart was promoted to become Deputy Area Organiser. Liddell Hart criticised the decision to retire Hobart and wrote an article in the newspaper &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;. Winston Churchill was notified and he had Hobart recalled into the army over Chief of the Imperial General Staff Alan Brooke&#x27;s objections in 1941. Hobart was assigned to train the 11th Armoured Division, a task which was recognised as extremely successfully achieved.

Hobart&#x27;s detractors tried again to have him removed, this time on medical grounds but Churchill rebuffed them. He was relatively old (57) for active command and he had been ill. Once again, Hobart was assigned to raise and train a fresh armoured division, this time the 79th Armoured Division.

===79th Armoured Division===
The Dieppe Raid in August 1942 had demonstrated the inability of regular tanks and infantry to cope with fortified obstacles in an amphibious landing. This showed the need for specialised vehicles to cope with natural and man-made obstructions during and after the Allied invasion of Europe.

In March 1943, Hobart&#x27;s 79th Armoured was about to be disbanded, due to lack of resources, but the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), General Sir Alan Brooke, in a &quot;happy brainwave&quot;, invited Hobart to convert his division into a unit of specialised armour. Hobart was reputedly suspicious at first and conferred with Liddell Hart before accepting, with the assurance that it would be an operational unit with a combat role. The unit was renamed the &quot;79th (Experimental) Armoured Division Royal Engineers&quot;. Unit insignia was a black bull&#x27;s head with flaring nostrils superimposed over a yellow triangle; this was carried proudly on every vehicle. Hobart&#x27;s brother-in-law, General Sir Bernard Montgomery, informed the American general Dwight D. Eisenhower of his need to build specialised tanks.

Under Hobart&#x27;s leadership, the 79th assembled units of modified tank designs collectively nicknamed &quot;Hobart&#x27;s Funnies&quot;. These were used in the Normandy landings and were credited with helping the Allies get ashore. The 79th&#x27;s vehicles were offered to the British and Canadian forces taking part in the landings of Operation Overlord, and were demonstrated to American First Army Commander, Lieutenant General Omar Bradley for US use. Bradley immediately understood their usefulness and on 16 February 1944 he requested five companies (about 100) of the Sherman DD (swimming) tanks, twenty-five Sherman flails and one hundred Churchill Crocodile flamethrowers from the British War Office for use on both Omaha and Utah beaches. Unfortunately, not enough of the flails and Crocodiles had been converted to meet the Anglo-Canadian requirements and the new US requests. The American forces benefitted only from the Sherman DDs and Sherman dozers, of which more were available due to many being built in America. Liddell Hart said of him: &quot;To have moulded the best two British armoured divisions of the war was an outstanding achievement, but Hobart made it a &quot;hat trick&quot; by his subsequent training of the specialised 79th Armoured Division, the decisive factor on D-Day.&quot;

The vehicles of the 79th did not deploy as units together but were attached to other units. By the end of the war the 79th had almost seven thousand vehicles. The 79th Armoured Division was disbanded on 20 August 1945.

Hobart returned to retirement in 1946 and died in 1957 in Farnham, Surrey.

A barracks in Detmold, Germany, was named after him. Hobart Barracks has since been handed back to the German government and no longer functions as a barracks.

==Awards and decorations==
In 1943, Hobart was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). After the war, he was awarded the American Legion of Merit. During his career, Hobart also became a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and, for his actions in the First World War, received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and Military Cross (MC). During his military career he was also mentioned in despatches nine times.

<text>Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey (23 December 1621 – 12 October 1678) was an English magistrate whose mysterious death caused anti-Catholic uproar in England. Contemporary documents also spell the name Edmundbury Godfrey.

==Early life==
Edmund Berry Godfrey was born in Sellindge, Kent, between Hythe and Ashford, the eleventh son of eighteen children born to Thomas Godfrey (1586–1664), a member of an old Kentish family and his second wife Sarah, née Isles. He was named after his godfathers, Edmund Harrison and Captain John Berrie (which led to the misconception that his first name was &quot;Edmundbury&quot;). His father had been MP for New Romney in the Short Parliament and owned Hodiford Farm. He studied at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford and after entering Gray&#x27;s Inn became a prominent wood and coal merchant. He became justice of the peace for Westminster and received a knighthood in September 1666 for his services during the Great Plague of 1665 when he had stayed in his post regardless of the circumstances. In 1669 Godfrey was briefly imprisoned for a few days because he had the King&#x27;s physician, Sir Alexander Fraizer, arrested for owing him money. Samuel Pepys&#x27; diary of 26 May 1669 mentions that he went on hunger strike, claiming that the Judges had found for him, but the King, Charles II, had overridden them. He was held at the Porter&#x27;s Lodge of Whitehall Palace.

He was in business with his brother-in-law, James Harrison. Originally their premises was in Greene&#x27;s Lane (beneath present-day Charing Cross Station) but moved in 1670 to Hartshorn Lane, having use of a wharf. This is now Northumberland Avenue. His grave in St Martin-in-the-Fields has since been concreted over. After his death, his papers were retrieved from a trunk in a coffee house at Swan&#x27;s Court, by Somerset House. He lived with a maid named Elizabeth Curtis and his secretary, Henry More and a housekeeper, who were questioned at his inquest, where they gave evidence that in their opinion his death was suicide. He was considered eccentric in choosing to socialise with members of the working class instead of persons of his own class, although he did have a number of influential friends, including Gilbert Burnet and Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham. Recently, correspondence has been retrieved from Ireland detailing his relations with a faith-healer Valentine Greatrakes — the &quot;Irish stroker&quot;. Strictly Anglican in religion, Godfrey had a number of Catholic acquaintances, including Edward Colman, Catholic secretary of the Duke of York, the future James II.

==Peyton Gang==
In a letter to the Secretary of State, Sir Joseph Williamson, the Lieutenant of the Tower of London named Godfrey as a member of the so-called &quot;Peyton Gang&quot;. Sir Robert Peyton was MP for Middlesex and a prominent member of the Green Ribbon Club. This had been founded by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury after he had become aware of the Secret Treaty of Dover in which Charles II agreed to convert himself and England to Roman Catholicism in return for money paid by the French King Louis XIV. The club, unable to confront the king directly, stirred up popular ill feelings against the Roman Catholic Church. Peyton hand-picked twelve men (including himself and Godfrey) who plotted to replace the King with a republic, nominally led by Richard Cromwell. The founding meeting of the Green Ribbon Club was in the Swan Tavern in King Street, Hammersmith. This was owned by Sir Edmund Godfrey, who left it in his will. It has been said that after Titus Oates had left his deposition with Godfrey, Godfrey warned one of the intended scapegoats, Edward Colman, who was later hanged, drawn and quartered, and who was a personal friend.

==Mystery==

In 1678, Godfrey became involved with the schemes of Titus Oates when Oates invented the Popish Plot and began an anti-Catholic campaign. Titus Oates and Israel Tonge appeared before Godfrey and asked him to take their oath that the papers they presented as evidence were based on truth. Godfrey demanded first to know the contents of the papers and when he had received a copy on 28 September, took their depositions. He may have warned Coleman of the content of the accusations.

When Oates&#x27;s accusations became known, the public became concerned. Godfrey had supposedly been concerned that he might be one of the victims of the scare, but he took no extra precautions for his own security; his conversation also became increasingly strange, with references to martyrdom and to being &quot;knocked on the head&quot; (the contemporary phrase for assassination). It was this odd behaviour which led his household to conclude that he had committed suicide, despite the medical evidence to the contrary.

On 12 October 1678, he left his house in the morning but did not return home. He was found dead in a ditch on Primrose Hill on 17 October. Godfrey was lying face down and had been impaled with his own sword.

Two committees unsuccessfully investigated the murder. They received conflicting statements about Godfrey&#x27;s whereabouts before the murder. There was no evidence of a struggle on the spot where the body had been found and Godfrey still had his money and rings. On the other hand, curious people had already trampled the ground when investigators arrived. The body was covered with bruises and a circular mark around Godfrey&#x27;s neck revealed that he had been strangled and his neck broken. The sword wound had not bled, meaning that Godfrey was already dead when he was impaled, maybe for 4–5 days. The authorities announced a reward of £500 for information about the murderers.

Oates exploited the situation and encouraged the public perception that the murder was the work of Catholic plotters. There was a commemorative dagger and medal, sermons and pamphlets. These months were long remembered as &quot;Godfrey&#x27;s Autumn&quot;.

Later &quot;Captain&quot; William Bedloe, who claimed to be a &quot;reformed&quot; Catholic plotter, claimed that he had been taken to Somerset House on the night of 14 October to see the body of Godfrey (although on the previous day he had claimed just the opposite). He said he had seen two men, including Samuel Atkins, secretary to Samuel Pepys. 

Atkins was arrested but was able to prove that he had been on a yacht at Greenwich (and extremely drunk) at that time, and the Court directed an acquittal. Bedloe claimed that Catholic plotters had killed Godfrey in order to steal his papers about the depositions (note that the witnesses whose words had been recorded were still alive). He changed his story several times afterwards but the House of Lords retained him as a witness. 

Perhaps in response to prompting he named John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse, as the mastermind behind the murder. The King, who was increasingly sceptical about the reality of the Plot, burst out laughing at the notion, pointing out that Belasyse was so afflicted with gout that he could hardly stand up.

==Miles Prance==

On 21 December, Miles Prance, Catholic servant-in-ordinary to England&#x27;s Catholic Queen consort, Catherine of Braganza, was arrested and taken to Newgate prison. His lodger John Wren (who was in debt to Prance) testified that he had been away for the four nights before Godfrey&#x27;s body was discovered. Bedloe claimed to recognize him. Both statements are now thought to be lies, but this did not help Prance.

On 23 – 24 December, Prance announced that he had had a part in the murder but that the main instigators were three Catholic priests: Thomas Godden, head of the secular English clergy, and two Irish priests, Kelly and Fitzgerald. These priests witnessed the murder in the courtyard of Somerset House where Godfrey had been lured. Godfrey had been strangled and his body taken to Hampstead. Prance named as the actual killers three working men, Robert Green, Henry Berry and Lawrence Hill, who were arrested. Godden fled the country, while the two Irish priests simply vanished from sight. As with most solutions to the murder, the main weakness was the absence of a plausible motive. Prance could only say, vaguely, that Godfrey had been harassing the two priests in some way, which seems unlikely as he was noted for tolerance in religious matters.

Prance later recanted his confession before the king and the council and was thrown back to prison: he was threatened with torture, and nearly froze to death. As a result, he recanted his recantation and recanted two more times, ending up verifying his original story. At the trial, he was a highly credible witness, although Hill&#x27;s wife rightly prophesied &quot;we shall see him recant after, when it is too late&quot;. The three men were sentenced to death 5 February 1679 and hanged at Primrose Hill. For a time this was known as &quot;Greenberry Hill&quot;, because of the hangings of Green, Berry and Hill.

Prance&#x27;s story was later discredited and he pleaded guilty to perjury. Because the three men were executed on false evidence, and historians accept their complete innocence, the murder remains officially unsolved.

==Solutions==
There have been many theories of what really happened to Godfrey and who killed him. &quot;To the minds of Kennet, Oldmixon, and Christie the Catholics were responsible. North declared that he was murdered by the patrons of Oates, to give currency to the belief in the Plot. Sir James Fitzjames Stephen hazards that Oates himself was the murderer, and is supported by Mr Traill and Mr Lee. L&#x27;Estrange was positive that he committed suicide. Lingard and Sir George Sitwell have given the same verdict. Ralph, Hallam, Macaulay, Ranke, and Klopp pronounce the problem unsolved. Hume has pronounced it insoluble&quot;.

Mystery writer John Dickson Carr wrote that suicide by hanging was impossible as the marks on his neck showed that he had had his neck broken with his cravat, which was too short to effect a breakage by &quot;drop&quot;. An investigation by pathologist Keith Simpson (appendix in John Dickson Carr&#x27;s &quot;The Murder of Sir Edmund Godfrey&quot;) concurred, concluding that if the body had been suspended, the marks would have been higher up on the body than they were. The circumstances of Godfrey&#x27;s death were established and documented by two doctors, Zachariah Skillard and Nicholas Cambridge, for an inquest held at the White House tavern in Primrose Hill.

Historian J. P. Kenyon argues that neither Catholics nor Whigs had a sufficient motive. The Catholics were almost certain to be blamed for the murder, with calamitous consequences; while neither Shaftesbury nor his colleagues, whatever their faults, were likely to murder an innocent man of their own social class whom many of them knew and liked, on the mere speculation that it would bring them some benefit. He discounts Oates&#x27; involvement on the ground that he was a physical coward; Bedloe&#x27;s conduct suggests that he had heard something about the murder from his underworld connections but was not directly involved.

==Modern analysis==
American mystery writer John Dickson Carr analyzed all of these theories in &quot;The Murder of Sir Edmund Godfrey&quot; (1936), exposing their weak points and contradictions. He concluded that Philip Herbert, 7th Earl of Pembroke had taken revenge on Godfrey, who had prosecuted him that April for the murder of Nathaniel Cony. Herbert was convicted of manslaughter and exercised his privilege of peerage to escape punishment, leaving him without the use of that Get Out of Jail Free card which he sorely needed after nearly killing a peer in a dispute shortly after his conviction.

British popular historian Hugh Ross Williamson reached the same conclusion in &quot;Historical Whodunits&quot; (1955). British professional historian J. P. Kenyon concurred (1974), but allowed that the matter could not now be settled with certainty. The author Stephen Knight suggested in &quot;The Killing of Justice Godfrey&quot; (1984) that Herbert murdered Godfrey on the orders of the &quot;Peyton Gang&quot;.

Alan Marshall&#x27;s &quot;The Strange Death of Edmund Godfrey, Plots and Politics in Restoration London&quot; (1999) offers a comprehensive examination of Godfrey&#x27;s life and death. Marshall follows the principle of Ockham&#x27;s razor in concluding that Godfrey most likely killed himself. He suggests Godfrey&#x27;s brothers made the death appear to be a murder to avoid public disgrace and the forfeiture of Godfrey&#x27;s estate. On the other hand, in her biography &quot;King Charles II&quot; (1979), Antonia Fraser argues that &quot;this would have been an elaborate, even over-elaborate, way of going about things&quot;, and that there &quot;is no proof that such a concealment ever took place&quot;. She suggests instead that murder &quot;was the obvious plausible explanation, either by random muggers taking advantage of Godfrey&#x27;s night walk, or by any one of the enemies a magistrate can acquire in the exercise of his profession&quot;, while conceding that &quot;no one theory ... seems able to explain all the known facts.&quot;

==Popular culture==
Godfrey was played by the actor David Bradley in the TV mini-series &quot;Charles II: The Power and the Passion&quot;.

Godfrey is a conspicuous character in Alison Macleod&#x27;s 1976 historical novel &quot;The Portingale&quot;, a biography of Queen Catherine of Braganza. He is depicted as a very honest magistrate, who is reluctant to take part in any persecution, regularly warning both Catholics and Dissenters who are about to be arrested. In a (fictional) scene, Godfrey is depicted as meeting secretly with King Charles II, his brother James and Queen Catherine, and suggesting that they arrest Titus Oates; the King later regrets not having taken this advice. The book does not take a clear stand regarding the circumstances of Godfrey&#x27;s death.

Godfrey&#x27;s murder plays a key role in Kate Braithwaite&#x27;s 2018 novel, &quot;The Road to Newgate&quot;, where an investigation into Godfrey&#x27;s death is pivotal in attempts to prove Titus Oates&#x27; claims of a Popish Plot are baseless.

Colin Haydn Evans&#x27; radio play, &quot;A Walk Across the Green&quot; broadcast on BBC Radio 4 (7 April 1990) depicts Godfrey&#x27;s murder as the work of Protestant conspirators headed by the republican-leaning Earl of Shaftesbury, to foment further anti-Catholic hysteria. The story is narrated by the mysterious (fictional) character, Thomas Wells, an agent provocateur employed by Shaftesbury.

<text>William Edmund Hick (1 August 1912 – 20 December 1974) was a British psychologist, who was a pioneer in the new sciences of experimental psychology and ergonomics in the mid-20th century.

Hick trained as a medical doctor, taking the MB and BSc degrees of the University of Durham in 1938, and the MD of the same university in 1949. He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1941, leaving in 1944 when he moved to Cambridge to join the MRC&#x27;s Applied Psychology Unit at the Cambridge Psychological Laboratory.

He was appointed Reader by the University of Cambridge in 1953, and was also a Fellow of St. John&#x27;s College.

He was a founding member of the Experimental Psychology Group and served as its President in 1958, when it became the Experimental Psychology Society. He was also a founder member of the Ergonomics Society and a member of the Ratio Club.

Probably his most famous contribution to experimental psychology was his paper &quot;On the rate of gain of information&quot; (Hick, 1952), which later became known as Hick&#x27;s law, and widely depended upon in the study of human information processing, for instance using the Jensen box.

<text>The Garamantes (; ) were ancient peoples, who may have descended from Berber tribes, Toubou tribes, and Saharan pastoralists that settled in the Fezzan region by at least 1000 BC and established a civilization that flourished until its end in the late 7th century AD. The Garamantes first emerged as a major regional power in the mid-2nd century AD and established a kingdom that spanned roughly in the Fezzan region of southern Libya. Their growth and expansion was based on a complex and extensive qanat irrigation system (Berber: &quot;foggaras&quot;), which supported a strong agricultural economy and a large population. They subsequently developed the first urban society in a major desert that was not centered on a river system; their largest town, Garama, had a population of around four thousand, with an additional six thousand living in surrounding suburban areas. At its pinnacle, the Garamantian kingdom established and maintained a &quot;standard of living far superior to that of any other ancient Saharan society&quot; and was composed of &quot;brilliant farmers, resourceful engineers, and enterprising merchants who produced a remarkable civilization.&quot;

==Origin and prehistory==

The Garamantes may have descended from Libyco-Berber tribes, Toubou tribes, and Saharan pastoralists, who settled in an area of the Fezzan region by at least 1000 BC. At Takarkori rockshelter, Final Pastoral peoples restructured their society and created burial sites for several hundred individuals that contained non-local, luxury goods and drum-type architecture in 3000 BP, which made way for the development of the Garamantian kingdom. Final Pastoral peoples were also in contact with the Garamantes, who later acquired a monopoly on the oasis-based economy of the southern region of Libya. People of the Tichitt culture in southeastern Mauritania may have also made domestic architectural and ceramic contributions to the Garamantian culture, possibly due to the presence of Sahelian women in Garamantian society as a result of intermarriage. The practice of &#x27;sacking&#x27; women from the south has also been attributed to the Garamantes, as well as to later populations such as the Tuareg and Tebu.

==History==

The earliest known written record to document the Garamantes dates to the 5th century BC. Herodotus includes the Garamantes in his description of the ancient Libyan tribes, describing them as &quot;a very great nation&quot; who herded cattle and farmed dates. According to Herodotus the Garamantes used four-horse chariots to hunt &quot;Troglodyte Ethiopians&quot; in their quest for slaves. Herodotus states that &quot;the Libyans in the north and the Ethiopians in the south of Libya are aboriginal, the Phoenicians and Greeks are later settlers”; Libya being the Greek name for Africa west of the Nile.

Besides Herodotus, historic references to the Garamantes also appear in several other Greco-Roman sources. After conducting a comprehensive review of quotes on the Garamantes from various sources, including Strabo, Arnobius Adv. Gentes, Ptolemy, and Solinus, David Mattingly et al. (2003) concluded:

Clearly, the perception of some of the Roman writers was that some Garamantians were negroid or very dark-skinned, whilst others saw them as essentially aligned with the Berber peoples. This mixed picture most likely reflects the ancient reality ... On the evidence of the sources alone, the likelihood is that the Garamantes encompassed a mixture of racial types: Berber, negro and various levels of miscegenation.

Roman depictions describe the Garamantes as bearing ritual scars and tattoos. Tacitus wrote that they assisted the rebel Tacfarinas and raided Roman coastal settlements. According to Pliny the Elder, in response to continuous Garamantian raiding, Lucius Cornelius Balbus and other Romans captured fifteen of their settlements in 19 BC. In 202 AD, Septimius Severus captured the capital city of Garama.

The decline of the Garamantian culture may have been connected to worsening climatic conditions, or overuse of water resources. Present-day desert in the Sahara was once agricultural land of fairly good quality that was further enhanced through the Garamantian irrigation system. As fossil water is a non-renewable resource, over several centuries of the Garamantian kingdom, the ground water level fell, thereby, contributing to its end in the late 7th century AD.

==Society and culture==

In the 1960s, archaeologists excavated part of the Garamantes&#x27; capital at modern Germa (situated around 150 km west of modern-day Sabha) and named it &quot;Garama&quot; (an earlier capital, Zinkekara, was located not far from the later Garama). Current research indicates that the Garamantes had about eight major towns, three of which have been examined as of 2004. In addition they had a large number of other settlements. Garama had a population of around four thousand and another six thousand living in villages within a 5 km radius. Up to 50,000 people could have lived in the whole wadi. 

Nikita et al. (2011) indicated that the skeletons of the Garamantes do not suggest regular warfare or strenuous activities. Nikita et al. (2011) states: &quot;The Garamantes exhibited low sexual dimorphism in the upper limbs, which is consistent to the pattern found in agricultural populations and implies that the engagement of males in warfare and construction works was not particularly intense. [...] the Garamantes did not appear systematically more robust than other North African populations occupying less harsh environments, indicating that life in the Sahara did not require particularly strenuous daily activities.&quot;

Archaeological ruins associated with the Garamantian kingdom include numerous tombs, forts, and cemeteries. The Garamantes constructed a network of tunnels, and shafts to mine the fossil water from under the limestone layer under the desert sand. The dating of these foggara is disputed, they appear between 200 BC to 200 CE but continued to be in use until at least the 7th century and perhaps later. The network of tunnels is known to Berbers as &quot;Foggaras&quot;. The network allowed agriculture to flourish, and used a system of slave labor to keep it maintained.

===Slave raiding and trading===

Based on Herodotus&#x27; account of Garamantes pursuing &quot;Troglodyte Ethiopians&quot;, Sonja and Carlos Magnavita (2018) say that &quot;Saharan slave raids against Black Africans in classical times&quot; might be a myth, though they admit that &quot;hunting people for other purposes than for enslaving them is admittedly hard to imagine&quot;. Nonetheless, five centuries after Herodotus, Roman merchants established themselves in Leptis Magna (Lybia) and Lixus (Morocco) to purchase the slaves the Berbers brought from Subsaharan Africa.

==Biological anthropology ==

Giuseppe Sergi (1951) analysed human skeletal remains from the Fezzan dating from the end of the Pastoral period up to the Roman period in the first centuries AD. Sergi concluded that the Garamantes were mostly of &#x27;Mediterranean&#x27; type, similar to modern Berbers, which he termed &#x27;Euroafrican&#x27;. He also found an influx of &#x27;Negroid&#x27; types and an increase of &#x27;mixed&#x27; types dating mostly from the Roman period. In a review of the skeletal evidence analysed by Sergi, M.C. Chamla (1968) found that 46.6% of the individuals were of &#x27;Eurafrican&#x27; type (closely related to Berbers), 26.6% were of mixed Eurafrican-Negroid type, and 26.6% were of &#x27;a more predominantly Negroid&#x27; type.

According to David Mattingly et al. (2003):

The Garamantes contained a significant component of light-skinned Libyans and some at least of these people were buried in monumental graves. This picture differs from the situation in the Sahara in the late Neolithic, as Chamla&#x27;s work suggests a higher proportion of negroid types at that date, which might suggest that the creation of Garamantian civilisation involved the in-migration of at least some part of the population from regions to the north or northeast. The cemeteries contain a substantial number (over 50 percent) of individuals of either mixed blood or full negro physionomy. Some of these individuals may have been in poorer graves, but not all of them, suggesting that some individuals of mixed race or black skin were prominent within Garamantian society. Given the literary testimony of Garamantian raids against their &#x27;Ethiopian&#x27; neighbours, it is likely that some of the negroes present were slaves or descendants of slaves. The maintenance of strong non-negroid traits into late and post-Garamantian contexts would seem to indicate that intermixing of the races was not completely open and may have been structured within Garamantian society.

Francesca Ricci et al. (2013) analysed skeletal samples from the Garamantian site of Fewet in the Fezzan and found that they were similar to the Mediterranean &#x27;Euroafrican&#x27; type identified by Sergi, but with some evidence for gene flow from (probably) sub-Saharan populations, &quot;similarly to what Sergi (1951) suggested discussing the possible hybridization between the “Mediterranean” Group I and the “Negroid” Group IV.&quot; This gene flow was more evident in the female skeletons, suggesting an influx of non-local females possibly from the Sahel region.

Marta Mirazón Lahr et al. (2010) conducted research on skeletons from Fezzan dating from the Roman era and found that the skeletons clustered most closely with Neolithic Sahelian samples from Chad, Mali, and Niger, and secondarily to Roman Egyptians from Alexandria and Nubians from Soleb. 1st millennium BC samples from Algeria and Tunisia were somewhat more distant but still rather close to the Fezzan skeletons. Lahr et al. concluded that the Garamantes had connections with both the Sahel and northern Africa.

Efthymia Nikita et al. (2011) examined the biological affinities of the Garamantes using cranial nonmetric traits and the Mean Measure of Divergence and Mahalanobis D(2). They were compared to other North African populations, including the Egyptian, Algerian, Tunisian and Sudanese, roughly contemporary to them. Overall, three clusters were identified: (1) the Garamantes, (2) Gizeh and Kerma, and (3) Soleb, Alexandrians, Algerians and Carthaginians. The analysis concluded that the Garamantes were isolated, with the Sahara playing a role as a barrier to geneflow. The distance between the Garamantes and their neighbors was high and the population appeared to be an outlier.

The remains of a young sub-Saharan African woman, which has been dated to the 1st millennium BC and possessed a lip plug that is associated with Sahelian African groups, was buried among other Sub-Saharan Africans that were part of the heterogenous Garamantian population. Power et al. (2019) states: &quot;This ornament demonstrates that some Garamantes individuals shared aspects of their material culture with Sahelian societies more broadly, either through migration or contact, while their burial within Garamantes cemeteries shows their integration into the normative funerary rituals of contemporary Garamantian society. The combination of morphometric and isotopic work further reinforces the view that Garamantian society included individuals of diverse geographical origin, some of whom may have been first generation Trans-Saharan migrants.&quot; The craniometric results also identified another sub-group within the Garamantes buried in the Wadi al-Ajjal, with a morphology that is widely observed among Mediterranean people.

==Language==

Linguist Roger Blench (2006) stated: “The Garamantes, whose empire in the Libyan Fezzan was overthrown by the Romans, wrote in a Libyan script, although we have no evidence they spoke Berber. What they did speak is open to conjecture; the most likely hypothesis is a Nilo-Saharan language, related either to Songhay or to Teda—the present-day language of the Tibesti.”

===Script===

The Garamantes may have used a nearly indecipherable form of proto-Tifinagh. Blench (2019) states:

One of the most problematic aspects is the language and inscriptions attributed to the Garamantes...Sites in the vicinity of Jarma, the Garamantian capital of what is now known as Fazzan, have abundant inscriptions (Fig. 14.7). 67 They are found cut or painted on dark grey amphorae, in the tombs of Garamantian cemeteries, such as those of Saniat bin Huwaydi.68 A recent project under the auspices of the British Library has digitised most of the known inscriptions and these are described in Biagetti et al.69 Although the inscriptions are in Berber characters, only some are decipherable. Various reasons for this have been suggested; either the messages were deliberately coded, so that only specific readers could understand them. Alternatively, they may have had a ‘ludic’ nature. The most exciting possibility is that they were in a non-Berber language, perhaps Nilo-Saharan or something unknown.

<doc id="1013793" wikidata="Q3504887" url="?curid=1013793" title="Tube socket">
<text>Tube sockets are electrical sockets into which vacuum tubes (electronic valves) can be plugged, holding them in place and providing terminals, which can be soldered into the circuit, for each of the pins. Sockets are designed to allow tubes to be inserted in only one orientation. They were used in most tube electronic equipment to allow easy removal and replacement. When tube equipment was common, retailers such as drug stores had vacuum tube testers, and sold replacement tubes. Some Nixie tubes were also designed to use sockets.

Throughout the tube era, as technology developed, sometimes differently in different parts of the world, many tube bases and sockets came into use. Sockets are not universal; different tubes may fit mechanically into the same socket, though they may not work properly and possibly become damaged.

Tube sockets were typically mounted in holes on a sheet metal chassis and wires or other components were hand soldered to lugs on the underside of the socket. In the 1950s, printed circuit boards were introduced and tube sockets were developed whose contacts could be soldered directly to the printed wiring tracks. Looking at the bottom of a socket, or, equivalently, a tube from its bottom, the pins were numbered clockwise, starting at an index notch or gap, a convention that has persisted into the integrated circuit era.

In the 1930s, tubes often had the connection to the control grid brought out through a metal top cap on the top of the tube. This was connected by using a clip with an attached wire lead. An example would be the 6A7 pentagrid converter. Later, some tubes, particularly those used as radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers or horizontal deflection amplifiers in TV sets, such as the 6DQ6, had the plate or anode lead protrude through the envelope. In both cases this allowed the tube&#x27;s output circuitry to be isolated from the input (grid) circuit more effectively. In the case of the tubes with the plate brought out to a cap, this also allowed the plate to run at higher voltages (over 26,000 volts in the case of rectifiers for color television, such as the 3A3, as well as high-voltage regulator tubes.) A few unusual tubes had caps for both grid and plate; the caps were symmetrically placed, with divergent axes.

==The first tubes==
The earliest tubes, like the &quot;Deforest Spherical Audion&quot; from , used the typical light bulb Edison socket for the heater, and flying leads for the other elements. Other tubes directly used flying leads for all of their contacts, like the &quot;Cunningham AudioTron&quot; from 1915, or the &quot;Deforest Oscillion&quot;. Type C6A xenon thyratrons, used in servos for the U.S. Navy Stable Element Mark 6, had a mogul screw base and L-shaped stiff wires at the top for grid and anode connections. Mating connectors were machined pairs of brass blocks with clamping screws, attached to flying leads (free hanging).

==Early bases==
When tubes became more widespread, and new electrodes were added, more connections were required. Specially designed bases were created to account for this need. However, as the world was suffering from World War I, and the new electronics technology was just emerging, designs were far from being standardized. Usually, each company had their own tubes and sockets, which were not interchangeable with tubes from other companies. By the early 1920s, this situation was finally changing, and several standard bases were created. They consisted of a base (ceramic, metal, bakelite, etc.) with a number of prongs ranging from three to seven, with either a non-regular distribution or with one or two of the prongs of bigger diameter than the other, so that the tube could only be inserted in a certain position. Sometimes they relied on a bayonet on the side of the base. Examples of these are the very common USA bases UX4, UV4, UY5 and UX6, and the European B5, B6, B7, B8, C7, G8A, etc. Tubes in the USA typically had from four to seven pins in a circular array, with adjacent pairs of larger pins for heater connections.

Before alternating current (AC) line/mains-powered radios were developed, some four-pin tubes (in particular, the very common UX-201A (&#x27;01A)) had a bayonet pin on the side of a cylindrical base. The socket used that pin for retaining the tube; insertion finished with a slight clockwise turn. Leaf springs, essentially all in the same plane, pressed upward on the bottoms of the pins, also keeping the bayonet pin engaged.

The first hot-cathode CRT, the Western Electric 224-B, had a standard four-pin bayonet base, and the bayonet pin was a live connection. (Five effective pins: It was an electrostatic-deflection gas-focused type, with a diode gun and single-ended deflection. The anode and the other two plates were common.)

An early exception to these types of bases is the Peanut 215, which instead of using prongs had a tiny bayonet base with four drop-like contacts. Another exception is the European Side Contact series commonly known as P, which instead of using a prong, relied on side contacts at 90 degrees from the tube axis with four to twelve contacts.

==Octal ==

In April 1935, the General Electric Company introduced a new eight-pin tube base with their new metal envelope tubes. The new base became known as the &quot;octal base&quot;. The octal base provided one more conductor with a smaller overall size of the base than the previous line of U. S. tube bases which had provided a maximum of seven conductors. Octal bases, as defined in IEC 60067, diagram IEC 67-I-5a, have a 45-degree angle between pins, which form a diameter circle around a diameter keyed post (sometimes called a &quot;spigot&quot;) in the center. Octal sockets were designed to accept octal tubes, the rib in the keyed post fitting an indexing slot in the socket so the tube could only be inserted in one orientation.

When used on metal tubes, pin 1 was always reserved for a connection to the metal shell, which was usually grounded for shielding purposes. This reservation prevented tubes such as the 6SL7/6SN7 dual triodes from being issued with metal envelopes, as such valves need three connections (cathode, grid, anode) for each triode (making six total) plus two connections for the paralleled heaters. The octal base soon caught on for glass tubes, where the large central post could also house and protect the &quot;evacuation tip&quot; of the glass tube. The eight available pins allowed more complex tubes than before, such as dual triodes, to be constructed. The glass envelope of an octal base tube was cemented into a bakelite or plastic base with a hollow post in the center, surrounded by eight metal pins. The wire leads from the tube were soldered into the pins, and the evacuation tip was protected inside the post.

Matching plugs were also manufactured that let tube sockets be used as eight-pin electrical connectors; bases from discarded tubes could be salvaged for this purpose. Octal sockets were used to mount other components, particularly electrolytic capacitor assemblies and electrical relays; octal-mount relays are still common.

Most octal tubes following the widespread European designation system have penultimate digit &quot;3&quot; as in ECC34 (full details in the Mullard–Philips tube designation article). There is a different, totally obsolete, pre-world-war-II German octal type.

Octal and miniature tubes are still in use in tube-type audio hi-fi and guitar amplifiers. Relays were historically manufactured in a vacuum tube form, and industrial-grade relays continue to use the octal base for their pinout.
==Loctal==

A variant of the octal base, the B8G loctal base or &quot;lock-in&quot; base (sometimes spelled &quot;loktal&quot; — trademarked by Sylvania), was developed by Sylvania for ruggedized applications such as automobile radios. Along with B8B (a British designation out of date by 1958), these eight-pin locking bases are almost identical and the names usually taken as interchangeable (although there are some minor differences in specifications, such as spigot material and spigot taper, etc.). The pin geometry was the same as for octal, but the pins were thinner (although they will fit into a standard octal socket, they wobble and do not make good contact), the base shell was made of aluminium, and the center hole had an electrical contact that also mechanically locked (hence &quot;loctal&quot;) the tube in place. Loctal tubes were only used widely by a few equipment manufacturers, most notably Philco, which used the tubes in many table radios. Loctal tubes have a small indexing mark on the side of the base skirt; they do not release easily from their sockets unless pushed from that side. Because the pins are actually the Fernico or Cunife lead-out wires from the tube, they are prone to intermittent connections caused by the build-up of electrolytic corrosion products due to the pin being of a different metallic composition to the socket contact.

The loctal tube&#x27;s structure was supported directly by the connecting pins passing through the glass &quot;button&quot; base. Octal tube structures were supported on a glass &quot;pinch&quot;, formed by heating the bottom of the envelope to fusing temperature, then squeezing the pinch closed. Sealing the pinch embedded the connecting wires in the pinch&#x27;s glass and gave a vacuum-tight seal. The connecting wires then passed through the hollow base pins, where they were soldered to make permanent connections.

Loctal tubes had shorter connecting lengths between the socket pins and the internal elements than did their octal counterparts. This allowed them to operate at higher frequencies than octal tubes. The advent of miniature &quot;all-glass&quot; seven- and nine-pin tubes overtook both octals and loctals, so the loctal&#x27;s higher-frequency potential was never fully exploited.

Loctal tube type numbers in the USA typically begin with &quot;7&quot; (for 6.3-volt types) or &quot;14&quot; for 12.6-volt types. This was fudged by specifying the heater voltage as &quot;nominally&quot; 7 or 14 volts so that the tube nomenclature fitted. Battery types (mostly 1.4-volt) are coded &quot;1Lxn&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; is a letter and &quot;n&quot; a number, such as &quot;1LA4&quot;. Russian loctals &quot;end&quot; in L, e.g. 6J1L. European designations are ambiguous; all B8G loctals have numbers either in the range:
* 20–29, (such as EBL21, ECH21, EF22) except for early tubes in the series: DAC21, DBC21, DCH21, DF21, DF22, DL21, DLL21, DM21 which have either B9G or octal bases, the change to Sylvania&#x27;s locktal standard coming in 1942 
* or 50–59 (special bases, including the European 9-pin lock-in base), but other types are in the same range (e.g. while EF51 is B8G loctal, the EF55 is 9-pin loctal, B9G, and the EL51 has a side-contact P8A base).

===Other loctals===
* Nine-pin loctal bases, B9G, include the 1938 Philips EF50, EL60 and some type numbers in the European 20–29 and 50–59 range;
* There is a different &quot;loctal Lorenz&quot; in the Mullard–Philips tube designation .

==Miniature tubes==

Efforts to introduce small tubes into the marketplace date from the 1920s, when experimenters and hobbyists made radios with so-called peanut tubes like the Peanut 215 mentioned above. Because of the primitive manufacturing techniques of the time, these tubes were too unreliable for commercial use.

RCA announced new miniature tubes in &quot;Electronics&quot; magazine, which proved reliable. The first ones, such as the 6J6 ECC91 VHF dual triode, were introduced in 1939. The bases commonly referred to as &quot;miniature&quot; are the seven-pin B7G type, and the slightly later nine-pin B9A (Noval). The pins are arranged evenly in a circle of eight or ten evenly spaced positions, with one pin omitted; this allows the tube to be inserted in only one orientation. Keying by omitting a pin is also used in 8- (subminiature), 10-, and 12-pin (Compactron) tubes (a variant 10-pin form, &quot;Noval+1&quot;, is basically a nine-pin socket with an added center contact).

As with loctal tubes, the pins of miniature tube are stiff wires protruding through the bottom of the glass envelope which plug directly into the socket. However, unlike all their predecessors, miniature tubes are not fitted with separate bases; the base is an integral part of the glass envelope. The pinched-off air evacuation nub is at the top of the tube, giving it its distinctive appearance. More than one functional section can be included in a single envelope; a dual triode configuration is particularly common. Seven- and nine-pin tubes were common, though miniature tubes with more pins, such as the Compactron series, were later introduced, and could fit up to three amplifying elements. Some miniature tube sockets had a skirt that mated with a cylindrical metal electrostatic shield that surrounded the tube, fitted with a spring to hold the tube in place if the equipment was subject to vibration. Sometimes the shield was also fitted with thermal contacts to transfer heat from the glass envelope to the shield and act as a heat sink, which was considered to improve tube life in higher power applications.

Electrolytic effects from the differing metal alloys used for the miniature tube pins (usually Cunife or Fernico) and the tube base could cause intermittent contact due to local corrosion, especially in relatively low current tubes, such as were used in battery-operated radio sets. Malfunctioning equipment with miniature tubes can sometimes be brought back to life by removing and reinserting the tubes, disturbing the insulating layer of corrosion.

Miniature tubes were widely manufactured for military use during World War II, and also used in consumer equipment. The Sonora Radio and Television Corporation produced the first radio using these miniature tubes, the &quot;Candid&quot;, in April 1940. In June 1940 RCA released its battery-operated Model BP-10, the first superheterodyne receiver small enough to fit in a handbag or coat pocket. This model had the following tube lineup: 1R5 — pentagrid converter; 1T4 — I.F. amplifier; 1S5 — Detector/AVC/AF Amplifier; 1S4 — Audio Output. The BP-10 proved so popular that Zenith, Motorola, Emerson, and other radio manufacturers produced similar pocket radios based on RCA&#x27;s miniature tubes. Several of these pocket radios were introduced in 1941 and sold until the suspension of radio production in April 1942 for the duration of World War II.

After the war miniature tubes continued to be manufactured for civilian use, regardless of any technical advantage, as they were cheaper than octals and loctals.
=== Miniature seven-pin base ===
The B7G (or &quot;small-button&quot; or &quot;heptal&quot;) seven-pin miniature tubes are smaller than Noval, with seven pins arranged at 45-degree spacing in a 9.53 mm (3/8th inch) diameter arc, the &quot;missing&quot; pin position being used to position the tube in its socket (unlike octal, loctal and rimlock sockets). Examples include the 6AQ5/EL90 and 6BE6/EK90. European tubes of this type have numbers 90-99, 100-109, 190-199, 900-999. A few in the 100-109 series have unusual, non-B7G bases, &quot;e.g.&quot;, Wehrmacht base.
=== Noval base ===
The nine-pin miniature Noval B9A base, sometimes called button 9-pin, B9-1, offered a useful reduction in physical size compared to previous common types, such as octal (especially important in TV receivers where space was limited), while also providing a sufficient number of connections (unlike B7G) to allow effectively unrestricted access to all the electrodes, even of relatively complex tubes such as double triodes and triode-hexodes. It could also provide multiple connections to an electrode of a simpler device where useful, as in the four connections to the grid of a conventional grounded-grid UHF triode, &quot;e.g.&quot;, 6AM4, to minimise the deleterious effects of lead inductance on the high-frequency performance.

This base type was used by many of the United States and most of the European tubes, &quot;e.g.&quot;, 12AX7-ECC83, EF86 and EL84, produced commercially towards the end of the era before transistors largely displaced their use.

The IEC 67-I-12a specification calls for a 36-degree angle between the nine pins of 1.016 mm thickness, in an arc of diameter 11.89 mm.

European tubes of this type have numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 800-899, 8000-8999.

=== Duodecar base ===
The Duodecar B12C base (IEC 67-I-17a) has 12 pins in a 19.1 mm diameter circle and dates from 1961. It was also called the Compactron T-9 construction/E12-70 base It is generally similar in form to a Noval socket, but larger. In the center is a clearance hole for a tube evacuation pip, which is typically on the bottom of a Compactron tube. (It should not be confused with the similar-sounding but differently sized Duodecal B12A base.)

=== Rimlock base ===
The Rimlock (B8A) base is an eight-pin design with a pin circle diameter close to Noval, and uses a nub on the side of the envelope to engage with a guide and retaining spring in the socket wall. This provides pin registration (since the pins are equi-spaced) and also a fair degree of retention. Early tubes with this base type typically had a metal skirt around the lower ~15mm of the envelope to match the socket wall, and this offered a degree of built-in screening, but these were fairly soon replaced by &quot;skirtless&quot; versions, which had a characteristic widening in the glass to compensate physically for the absence of the skirt. In the European naming scheme, rimlock tubes are numbered in the ranges 40-49, 110-119 (with exceptions), and 400-499, &quot;e.g.&quot;, EF40. Although virtually unknown elsewhere, this was a very common base type in European radios of the late 1940s through the 1950s, but was eventually displaced by the ubiquitous B7G and Noval (B9A) base types.

==UHF tubes==

By 1935 new tube technologies were required for the development of radar and telecommunications. UHF requirements severely limited the existing tubes, so radical ideas were implemented which affected how these tubes connected to the host system. Two new bases appeared, the acorn tube and the lighthouse tube, both solving the same problems but with different approaches. Thompson, G.M. Rose, Saltzberg and Burnside from RCA created the acorn tube by using far smaller electrodes, with radial short connections. A different approach was taken by the designers of the lighthouse tube, such as the octal-base 2C43, which relied on using concentric cylindrical metal contacts in connections that minimized inductance, thus allowing a much higher frequency.

Nuvistors were very small, reducing stray capacitances and lead inductances. The base and socket were so compact that they were widely used in UHF TV tuners. They could also be used in small-signal applications at lower frequencies, as in the Ampex MR-70, a costly studio tape recorder whose entire electronics section was based on nuvistors.

==Other socket styles==
There are many other socket types, of which a few are:
* Decal B10B base (IEC 67-I-41a) 10 pins with 1.02 mm diameter in an 11.89 mm diameter circle, e.g. PFL200
* Decar B10G base (IEC E10-73) A 10th pin added to the center of a standard 9-pin miniature base, e.g. 6C9
* Magnoval B9D base (IEC 67-I-36a) 9 pins with 1.27 mm diameter in a 17.45 mm pin circle diameter arc, e.g. EL503, EL509, PD500, etc. - not to be confused with...
* Novar B9E base, 9 pins with 1.02 mm diameter in a 17.45 mm pin circle diameter arc, one of several Compactron types, which looks similar to Magnoval (but a Novar tube in a Magnoval socket will not make good pin contact, and a Magnoval tube in a Novar socket may damage the socket).
* Sub-Magnal B11A base (American), 11-pins. Also used as industrial relay socket and HV power supplies. Amphenol / WirePro (WPI) / Eaton 78-series, Socket (female) part number: 78-S-11. Matching Plug (male) is part number: 86-CP-11
* Neo Eightar base (IEC 67-I-31a) 8 pins in a 15.24 mm diameter circle
* 5-pin sub-miniature wire-ended B5A base (no socket used; e.g. EA76)

A remarkably wide variety of tube and similar sockets is listed and described, with some informal application notes, at a commercial site, Pacific T.V., including nuvistor, eight-pin subminiature, vidicon, reflex klystron, nine-pin octal-like, 10-pin miniature (two types), 11-pin sub-magnal, diheptal 14-pin, and many display tubes such as Nixies and vacuum fluorescent types (and even more). As well, each socket has a link to a clear, high-quality picture. 

Some subminiature tubes with flexible wire leads all exiting in the same plane were connected by subminiature inline sockets. 

Some low-power reflex klystrons such as the 2K25 and 2K45 had small-diameter rigid coaxial outputs parallel to octal base pins. To accommodate the coax, one contact was replaced by a clearance hole.

Vacuum tubes for high-power applications often required custom socket designs. A jumbo four-prong socket was used for various industrial tubes. A specialized seven-pin socket (Septar or B7A), with all pins in a circle with one pin wider than the others, was used for transmitting tubes. Subminiature tubes with long wire leads, introduced in the 1950s, were often soldered directly to printed circuit boards. Sockets were made for early transistors, but quickly fell out of favor as transistor reliability became established. This also happened with early integrated circuits; IC sockets later became used only for devices that may need to be upgraded.

<doc id="1013796" wikidata="Q558130" url="?curid=1013796" title="Dave Hyatt">
<text>David Hyatt (born 28 June 1972) is an American software engineer and a &quot;Shadowrun&quot; game expansion author. Employed by Apple starting in 2002, he was part of the Safari web browser and WebKit framework development team. He also helped develop the HTML 5, XBL, and XUL specifications.

== Computing career ==
Before Apple, Hyatt worked at Netscape Communications from 1997 to 2002 where he contributed to the Mozilla web browser. While at Netscape, he also created Camino (then known as Chimera) and co-created Firefox (originally called Phoenix) with Blake Ross. He is credited with the implementations of tabbed browsing for Chimera and Firefox.

Joining Apple Inc. on 15 July 2002, Hyatt was part of the original development team that shipped the beta releases and 1.0 release of the Safari web browser, and co-developed its underlying WebKit framework.

Hyatt was also one of the lead WHATWG developers of the HTML 5 specifications, being co-editor, with Ian Hickson, of the first public working draft, published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in January 2008. He resigned from the HTML 5 project in March 2010 to concentrate on other work. Hyatt also created and wrote the first specifications for the XBL and XUL markup languages, and has remained a member of W3C&#x27;s CSS Working Group.

== Gaming career ==
As a freelance writer, he also co-authored published material for &quot;Shadowrun&quot; role-playing game, including the expansion packs &quot;Renraku Arcology: Shutdown&quot; (with Brian Schoner) and &quot;Brainscan&quot; (chapters &quot;The Return of the Father&quot; and &quot;Runners Ex Machina&quot;, with Robert Boyle; volume editor, Brian Schoner).

<doc id="1013797" wikidata="Q622950" url="?curid=1013797" title="Aqua Tofana">
<text>Aqua Tofana (also known as Acqua Toffana and Aqua Tufania and Manna di San Nicola) was a strong, arsenic-based poison created in Sicily around 1630 that was reputedly widely used in Palermo, Naples, Perugia, and Rome, Italy. The name Aqua Tofana has eveolved to refer to a category of slow poisons that are incredibly deadly but largely indetectable, just as Aqua Tofana was. These slow posions may have been used frequently throughout the 19th century. It has been associated with Giulia Tofana, or Tofania, a woman from Palermo, purportedly the leader of a ring of six poisoners in Rome, who sold Aqua Tofana to would-be murderers. 

== Original creation ==
The first recorded mention of Aqua Tofana is from 1632–33 when it was used by two women, Francesca la Sarda and Teofania di Adamo, to poison their victims. It may have been invented by, and named after, Teofania. She was executed for her crimes, but several women associated with her including Giulia Tofana (who may have been her daughter) and Gironima Spana moved on to Rome and continued manufacturing and distributing the poison. Once in Rome, the women may have acquired the main ingredient, arsenic, from Father Girolamo of Sant&#x27;Agnese in Agone. Father Girolamo had access of this poison by way of his brother, who was an apothecary. 
Tofana and her circle of trusted women camouflaged Aqua Tofana was camouflagedin a bottle labeled &quot;Manna di San Nicolas&quot; complete with a picture of the saint. Manna di San Nicolas was cosmetic and healing oil said to heal blemishes. This oil was said to be extracted from San Nicolas&#x27;s bones in a church located in Bari, Italy. Over 600 victims are alleged to have died from this poison, mostly husbands.

Aqua Tofana was camouflagedin in bottles wih the &#x27;tradename&#x27; &quot;Manna di San Nicola&quot; (&quot;Manna of St. Nicholas of Bari&quot;), a marketing device intended to divert the authorities, giving the poison an apperence of cosmetic and a devotional object in vials that included a picture of St. Nicholas. Over 600 victims are alleged to have died from this poison, mostly husbands.

Between 1666 and 1676, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers poisoned her father and two brothers, amongst others, and she was executed on July 16, 1676.

== Ingredients ==
The active ingredients of the mixture are known, but not how they were blended. Aqua Tofana contained mostly arsenic and lead, and possibly belladonna. It was a colorless, tasteless liquid and therefore easily mixed with water or wine to be served during meals.

== Symptoms ==
Poisoning by Aqua Tofana could go unnoticed, as the substance is clear and has no taste. Its tasteless properties signify that it was made with a deliberate attempt to hide the potent metallic taste of arsenic, Aqua Tofana&#x27;s key ingredient. It is slow-acting, with symptoms resembling progressive disease or other natural causes. The symptoms seen are similar to the effects of arsenic poisoning. Those poisoned by Aqua Tofana reported several symptoms. The first small dosage would produce cold-like symptoms. The victim was very ill by the third dose; symptoms included vomiting, dehydration, diarrhea, and a burning sensation in the victim&#x27;s throat and stomach. The fourth dose would kill the victim. As it was slow acting, it allowed victims time to prepare for their death, including writing a will and repenting. The antidote often given was vinegar and lemon juice.

== Legend about Mozart ==
The legend that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791) was poisoned using Aqua Tofana is completely unsubstantiated, even though it was Mozart himself who started this rumor.

<doc id="1013798" wikidata="Q84457" url="?curid=1013798" title="Horst Kopkow">
<text>Horst Kopkow (29 November 1910, Ortelsburg, East Prussia, Germany (now Szczytno, Poland) – 13 October 1996, Gelsenkirchen, Germany) was a Nazi German SS major who worked for German Security police and, after the war, was concealed by British intelligence to use his knowledge during the Cold War.

== Life ==
During World War II, Kopkow served in German National Security Headquarters (Reichssicherheitshauptamt) in Berlin. He was responsible for counter-sabotage and counterespionage. In May 1942, SS general Reinhard Heydrich extended his responsibilities to include the capture of Soviet parachute agents in Czechoslovakia and Poland. After Heydrich&#x27;s death following a British-directed Czech resistance attack, Kopkow&#x27;s responsibilities were extended to include all allied parachute agents in the German Reich.

During the war, Kopkow&#x27;s agents captured several hundred Soviet and British agents. Kopkow was informed and consulted over every capture, although he never left his headquarters in Berlin. One of his major efforts was the destruction of Red Orchestra and Rote Drei espionage networks. Security police also captured agents of MI6 and SOE. Kopkow authorized several hundred orders to execute the agents. This continued to the end of the war in 1945. His superiors rewarded him with medals. Kopkow also investigated the 20 July plot, an attempted assassination against Hitler.

At the end of the war, British military police arrested Kopkow in a Baltic village on 29 May 1945. By that time he would have been implicated in deaths of hundreds of Allied agents.

MI5 interrogated Kopkow heavily for the next four years to find out his methods against Soviet Union espionage. Kopkow cooperated and dictated notes to his former secretary Bertha Rose. British intelligence sheltered him from war crimes investigation and made him available only for three times in war crimes trials. They announced his &quot;death&quot; to War Crimes Group in London in January 1948. According to partially declassified MI5 documents released 2004 in the British National Archives, MI6 hid Kopkow in order to utilize his knowledge further. They released him in West Germany in 1949 or 1950 as a textile factory worker in the British occupation zone. Later he gave just two statements to the West German police when they were investigating the disappearance and death of Gestapo chief Heinrich Müller. 

Horst Kopkow died from pneumonia in a hospital in Gelsenkirchen in 1996, aged 85.

<doc id="1013814" wikidata="Q319678" url="?curid=1013814" title="Theodoros Kolokotronis">
<text>Theodoros Kolokotronis (; 3 April 1770 – ) was a Greek general and the pre-eminent leader of the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829) against the Ottoman Empire.

The son of a klepht leader who fought the Ottomans during the Orlov revolt, Kolokotronis also operated as a klepht and an armatolos early in his life. While serving in the British army during the Napoleonic Wars, he became influenced by the revolutionary ideas of the era. On the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, he organized a band of Moreot klephts and captured Tripolitsa in late 1821. Kolokotronis achieved his greatest success at the 1822 Battle of Dervenakia, where he routed the Ottoman forces under the command of Mahmud Dramali Pasha. From 1823 to 1825, he took part in the Greek civil wars and, following the defeat of his faction, he was briefly imprisoned in Hydra. In 1825, Kolokotronis was released and appointed commander-in-chief of the Greek forces in Peloponnese. He defended Greece against an Egyptian intervention.

After the war, Kolokotronis became a supporter of Ioannis Kapodistrias and a proponent of alliance with Russia. After Kapodistrias&#x27;s assassination in 1831, Kolokotronis backed Prince Otto of Bavaria for the Greek throne. He later turned against Otto&#x27;s regency, for which he was charged with treason and sentenced to death, but in 1835 he was pardoned. Kolokotronis died in 1843 in Athens.

==Early life==

Theodoros Kolokotronis was born at Ramavouni (), a mountain in Messenia, and was baptised in the village of Piana. He descended from a family of klephts, originally from the historical village of Roupaki at the border of Messenia and Arcadia, located nearby the settlement of Tourkoleka. He grew up in the village of Libovitsi, Arcadia, in the central Peloponnese.

The Kolokotroneoi were a powerful and respected clan in the surrounding areas in the 18th century. Their legendary pride and insubordination is commemorated in a well-known folk song of that time:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;On a horse they go to church,
On a horse they kiss the icons,
On a horse they receive communion
From the priest&#x27;s hand.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

The Turks chased the family, which was forced to leave the towerKolokotronis was ten years old at the timeand took refuge in Milea, Mani. His father, Konstantinos Kolokotronis, was a former captain of the Armatoloi in Corinth, who took part in an armed rebellion, the Orlov Revolt, instigated by the administration of Catherine the Great of Russia. He was killed in 1780 in an engagement with Ottoman troops, along with two of his brothers, George and Apostolis. Theodoros was named in honour of . Following his father&#x27;s death, at the age of 15, he was taken in and mentored by Mitros Petrovas (Μήτρος Πέτροβας). It was Mitro Petrovas that taught him his first lessons about fighting. Theodoros always called him &quot;uncle&quot; (μπάρμπα) and had him by his side, as an adviser and fighter, throughout his life.
Prior to the Greek Revolution, Theodoros Kolokotronis operated as a &quot;klepht&quot; (a warrior-bandit), an &quot;armatolos&quot; (a Christian irregular of the Ottoman military), and as a &quot;kápos&quot; (a militiaman employed by Greek notables of the Peloponnese). As a kapos, Kolokotronis worked for the Deligiannis family. He acquired wealth by stealing sheep and marrying the daughter of a wealthy Peloponnesian notable.

In 1805 he joined the Russian Navy during the Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812). In 1806 Ottoman attacks against the klefts forced Kolokotronis to flee to the island of Zakynthos (or Zante). When Zakynthos was occupied by the British, he obtained useful military experience while serving under the command of Richard Church, a philhellene, in the 1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry; in 1810, Kolokotronis was promoted to the rank of major. From his service in the British Army, he adopted his characteristic red helmet. While in the Heptanese (a French protectorate from 1807 to 1814), he came in contact with the revolutionary ideas of the era and was influenced by them:

==Greek War of Independence==

===Outbreak===
Kolokotronis returned to the mainland just prior to the outbreak of the war (officially, 25 March 1821) and formed a confederation of irregular Moreot klepht bands. These he tried to train and organize into something resembling a modern army. In May, he was named &quot;archistrategos&quot; or commander-in-chief. He was already 50 years old by this time, a fact which contributed to his sobriquet &quot;O Geros tou Morea&quot; or &quot;The Elder of Morea,&quot; whereby Morea was another name describing the Peloponnese. Kolokotronis&#x27;s first action was the defense of Valtetsi, the village near Tripoli where his army was mustering. Later, he was also the Commander of the Greek forces during the Siege of Tripolitsa.

===As liberator===
Kolokotronis gathered the klephts together to march to the relief of Demetrios Ypsilantis. This was quite a feat in itself, considering the near-collapse of the government and the notoriously quarrelsome nature of the klephtic bands. Even the troublesome Souliotes lent a hand. The Ottoman army from the north commanded by Mahmud Dramali Pasha, after taking Corinth, had marched to the plain of Argos. The castle of Larissa was an excellent position, commanding the whole plain. To leave such a stronghold straddling Ottoman supply lines was far too dangerous. Dramali would have to reduce the fortress before moving on. Scaling the cliffs, breaching the castle&#x27;s stout walls and overcoming its resolute defenders would be no easy task.

Yet, there was one weakness Dramali was unaware of: Larissa, unlike the Acropolis in Athens, had no spring and consequently fresh water had to be supplied from cisterns. Unfortunately for the Greeks, it was July and no rains were falling to fill the cisterns. Ypsilantis bluffed the Ottomans as long as he could, but towards the end of the month had to sneak his men out in the middle of the night. Dramali&#x27;s men plundered the castle the next day, and he was now free to march them toward the coast to resupply (the Greeks had pursued a scorched earth policy, and the large Ottoman force was eating through its food supplies rather quickly). Ypsilantis&#x27;s defense had bought Kolokotronis and the klephts valuable time.

To his dismay, Dramali found himself cut off from his supply fleet, which had intended to land at Nafplio but was successfully blockaded by the Greek fleet under Admiral Andreas Miaoulis.

Dramali reluctantly decided upon a retreat toward Corinth through the Dervenaki Pass, through which he had just come unmolested. This was exactly what Kolokotronis had been hoping for. In August 1822, his quicker-moving guerrilla forces trapped the Ottomans in the pass and annihilated them in the Battle of Dervenakia.

A devastated Sultan Mahmud II in Constantinople was forced to turn to Muhammad Ali, ruler of the nominally Ottoman pashaluk of Egypt, for help.

The Greeks resumed the siege against the fortresses at Nafplio, which fell in December. Kolokotronis is said to have ridden his horse up the steep slopes of Palamidi to celebrate his victory there; a statue in the town square commemorates the event. He is attired in the pseudo-classical uniform of the Greek Light Infantry, which he was fond of wearing.

===Parliamentary crisis===
From December 1823 to February 1825, he took part in the civil wars among the various Greek factions; when his party was finally defeated, he was jailed in Hydra with some of his followers in March 1825, and was released only when an Egyptian army under the command of Ibrahim Pasha invaded the Morea. His eldest son, Panos Kolokotronis, was killed during the second civil war.

===Against Ibrahim===
Ibrahim was fresh from fighting the Wahhabi rebels in Arabia, and so was used to fighting guerrillas. His troops were armed with the most modern equipment and trained by European experts. The sultan had promised his father the island of Crete as an appanage for young Ibrahim if he could crush the rebels. With his eye on the prize, he burned his way through the Peloponnese, gaining much territory but arousing much hostility in western European public opinion, which in the long run proved disastrous for the Ottomans.

The island of Sphacteria and Navarino had already fallen into Ibrahim&#x27;s hands, and to make matters worse for Kolokotronis, he still had to be on guard against the machinations of Petros Mavromichalis even as he was bracing himself against the new threat.

Kolokotronis decided to not confront Ibrahim in an open field battle and used guerrilla tactics and scorched earth policy against him; but given his limited resources, was unable to prevent the widespread destruction that Ibrahim left in his wake. Still, in 1825, in recognition of his military acumen and many services to the Greek cause, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Greek forces in the Peloponnese.

==Postbellum activities==
After the war, Kolokotronis became a supporter of Count Ioannis Kapodistrias and a proponent of alliance with Russia. When the count was assassinated on 8 October 1831, Kolokotronis created his own administration in support of Prince Otto of Bavaria as a King of Greece. Before Otto&#x27;s arrival in Greece however, Alexandros Mavrokordatos and Ioannis Kolettis, considering Kolokotronis as an obstacle to their plans to cover the positions of power, slandered him and sent a letter to Munich that he was preparing an army in order to prevent Otto from setting foot in Greece. When Kolokotronis realized this he put on his uniform and helmet and went to Nafplio to welcome Otto and pay his respects. Then he left to a farm he had outside the city as he writes:

However, later he opposed the Bavarian-dominated regency. On 7 June 1834, he was accused, with Dimitrios Plapoutas, for conspiracy against the regency, charged with treason and sentenced to death, though they were ultimately pardoned in 1835.

Theodoros Kolokotronis died in 1843 in Athens one day after his son Konstantinos&#x27;s (Kollinos) wedding and after a feast at the Royal Palace, in presence of King Otto.

He was buried in a family plot in the First Cemetery of Athens, where he remained interred until 1930, when prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos had his bones exhumed and transported to Tripoli. His bones were interred at the base of his statue in Areos Square, where they remain today.

==Epilogue==
In the twilight of his life, Kolokotronis had learned to write in order to complete his memoirs, which constitute the second best known account of the events of the Greek Revolutionary War after the memoirs of Yannis Makriyannis, and have been translated several times in English and other languages. Kolokotronis&#x27;s famed helmet, along with the rest of his arms and armor, may today be seen in the National Historical Museum of Greece in Athens. In addition to the Nafplio statue mentioned earlier, there is another to be seen in Athens, in the forecourt of the Old Parliament building on Stadiou Street, near Syntagma Square.

==Legacy==
*Kolokotronis is also the name of military barracks near Tripoli.
*A portrait of Kolokotronis was depicted on the Greek ₯5,000 banknote of 1984–2002.
*Theodoros Kolokotronis Stadium (Greek: Γήπεδο Θεόδωρος Κολοκοτρώνης), formerly known as Asteras Tripolis Stadium, is a football stadium in Tripoli. The stadium is the home of Superleague club Asteras Tripolis.

<doc id="1013817" wikidata="Q7900097" url="?curid=1013817" title="Urban beach">
<text>An urban beach (also city beach and sometimes beach club) is an artificially-created environment in an urban setting which simulates a public beachfront, through the use of sand, beach umbrellas, and seating elements. 

There are many variations of urban beaches. Urban beaches are often found along waterways, though some are inserted into town squares or other spaces far from water. The beach may be a seasonal installation over a roadway or parking lot, or it may be permanent.

Urban beaches are not necessarily publicly owned, though they generally remain open to the public (sometimes with an admission fee). Where river or ocean swimming is not possible, many urban beaches include water features -- for example fountains, wading pools or misting towers -- for cooling off. Some urban beaches feature entertainment, or food and beverage areas. A few include sports facilities such as beach volleyball.

Most urban beaches are designed to appeal to a general population, including families, young singles, and older citizens. Although an urban beach may not have facilities for swimming, swimwear is commonly seen alongside the more usual attire seen in major urban centers. 

The popularity of urban beaches increased in the early 21st century as the concept was championed by urban planners, landscape architects and local politicians.

==History==
Natural urban beaches located at the sea have attracted tourists for a long time, such as the Copacabana of Rio, the central beach of San Sebastián or the &quot;City Beach&quot; in Stralsund. However, many of the urban beaches are used especially by the locals for relaxation. A good example of this is the beach of Barcola, which used to be connected to the center of Trieste by tram and now by bus. People of all ages take the opportunity to spend their free time or lunch breaks away from the heat of the city on the cool sea breeze. There are even considerations to rebuild the sandy beach in Barcola, which was largely overbuilt by road construction in the 19th century.

Although many cities had experimented with temporary sand installations for various festivals and artistic projects, the modern urban beach concept as a summertime public amenity in the middle of the city was popularized by the Paris-Plages, a program of seasonal urban beach installations along the Seine. The Paris Plages is the world&#x27;s largest urban beach, and it transforms a stretch of the riverbanks into a beach experience complete with sand, deck chairs, and water activities. Some European urban beaches claim to predate Paris with similar elements and programming.

==Beach bars==
Many waterfront restaurants and bars around the globe have beach-themed sections, and as these have grown larger and added size and features there has been some crossover with urban beaches. For example, the two artificial beaches in New York City and many of the manmade beaches in German cities feature enclosed beach areas open to visitors, but the spaces are managed by private entities as food and drinks venues and close frequently for concerts and events. Strictly speaking, such locations are private enterprises and not true urban beaches, which can include commercial ventures but should maintain an atmosphere of public space.

==List of beaches==

This list is only of urban beaches as defined above, open to the public on a free or admission basis. It does not include fully private artificial beaches, natural beaches that exist in urban areas, playgrounds, dedicated waterparks or hardscape fountain plazas.

<doc id="1013819" wikidata="Q5095840" url="?curid=1013819" title="Chicago Winds">
<text>The Chicago Winds was the World Football League&#x27;s ill-fated 1975 successor to the Chicago Fire. The team was so named because Chicago was nicknamed &quot;The Windy City.&quot; The Winds played at Soldier Field and the team was assigned to the WFL&#x27;s Western Division for 1975 (the league having shrunk from 12 franchises to 11, and from three divisions to two).

==Pursuit of Joe Namath==
Prior to the 1975 season opener, Winds owner Eugene Pullano attempted to sign New York Jets star quarterback Joe Namath to a contract. Namath, who had helped establish the credibility of the Jets and the old American Football League, was wavering about re-signing with New York after the 1974 season. Reports had him retiring, being traded to another NFL team — or jumping to the WFL, perhaps as a player/coach/co-owner. Namath&#x27;s agent Jimmy Walsh asked the Winds for a $500,000 signing bonus, a three-year contract worth $600,000 a year, a $2 million annuity ($100,000 per year for 20 years) and terms for Namath&#x27;s eventual ownership of a WFL franchise in New York. The Winds even dropped red from their team colors and went with just green and white to allow Namath to continue marketing his number 12 jersey in Jets colors.

When Eddie Einhorn, head of the WFL&#x27;s television partner, TVS Television Network, got word that the upstart league was going after Namath, he bluntly told league president Chris Hemmeter that the WFL was literally betting its existence on getting Namath. Nearly all of TVS&#x27; affiliates refused to commit to air any WFL games in 1975 until Namath&#x27;s signing was confirmed. According to Mark Kreigel&#x27;s biography, &quot;Namath&quot;, Chicago apparently accepted the terms of the contract — until Walsh also demanded 15 percent of the WFL&#x27;s total TV package. The Winds, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively (as 85% of television revenue for the league would have been better than having no TV revenue at all), rejected the deal. The Winds had all but promised that Namath would come to Chicago, and their failure to sign him made them and the league look foolish. Namath stayed with the Jets, and TVS dropped its coverage of the WFL, leaving the league without national television coverage in what proved to be its final season.

The team hired former Charlotte Hornets coach Babe Parilli (who coincidentally was Namath&#x27;s backup with the Jets) as its new head coach and general manager. A number of old Fire players returned as well, including running backs Mark Kellar and Cyril Pinder, center Guy Murdock (the Fire&#x27;s MVP), and receivers Steve Wright and Chuck Kogut. With Namath out of the picture, the Winds acquired veteran quarterback Pete Beathard from the Portland Storm, while wide receiver John Gilliam, who originally signed with The Hawaiians, also came to Chicago. Margene Adkins, a former Canadian Football League teenage star who at 28 was beginning to wear down from injury, was also a contributor to the Winds&#x27; offense; the Winds would be Adkins&#x27; last team before he retired from professional football.

==1975 season==

The Winds did not have much success on the field or at the box office. They lost both pre-season games, to Jacksonville (in front of only 2,627 at Soldier Field) and Charlotte (Parilli&#x27;s old team). Unlike the defunct Chicago Fire, which sold 15,000 season tickets in 1974, the Winds managed only 1,600. In late July, the league took swift action by forcing Pulliano to fire Parilli. His replacement was Abe Gibron, who had been fired as head coach of the Chicago Bears after the 1974 season. (An amusing typo in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; indicated Gibron had become coach of the &quot;Chicago &quot;Winos&quot;&quot;.) Leo Cahill left a (relatively) comfortable position as Memphis Southmen GM to the precarious situation with the wobbling Winds. Gibron was given only 48 hours or so to learn about his new team.

The Winds lost their first two regular-season contests, 10-0 in Birmingham and 38-18 in Shreveport, before beating the Portland Thunder, 25-18 in overtime; just 3,501 fans attended the contest, their last at Soldier Field. After two more road losses (at Hawaii and Memphis), the team was 1-4 and swimming in red ink.

Unlike the Fire games from the year before, Winds games were not broadcast on TV or radio. The public address announcer for the two games in Chicago was Les Grobstein, who also worked with Eddie Ryan during Fire games.

==The end==
Due to a dispute over partnership arrangements, two major investors withdrew $175,000 that they&#x27;d deposited with the league. (In a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; story on the death of the WFL, a Winds official referred to the investors as &quot;Bob and Rich from California. I don&#x27;t know their last names, but one&#x27;s an Arab and the other&#x27;s a Greek.&quot;)

The investors&#x27; withdrawal dropped the Winds below league capitalization requirements. Puliano asked for time to find more investors. However, on September 2, the league&#x27;s owners voted 10-1 to expel Chicago from the league, with only the Winds themselves voting to continue. The owners were still reeling from the experience of the previous season, which saw many of the teams so badly underfinanced that they couldn&#x27;t meet basic expenses. For this reason (and the fact that the other owners were no doubt ticked-off at the Winds&#x27; inability to sign Namath and indirectly costing them their national TV contract), they were not willing to give the Winds a second chance.

A team folding in mid-season was not unusual for the WFL (the Jacksonville Sharks and Detroit Wheels had died 14 games into a 20-game regular season in 1974), so the league was prepared. The Winds&#x27; game against the Southern California Sun was canceled. Since there were 11 teams, one had a bye each week; with Chicago out, the bye team simply took the Winds&#x27; place in the schedule. John Gilliam was selected by the Philadelphia Bell in a dispersal draft, but returned to the NFL Minnesota Vikings instead, much to the WFL&#x27;s chagrin. Even this arrangement didn&#x27;t last long. Due in part to the loss of national television revenue, the entire WFL only survived the Winds by a month, folding on October 22.

<text>Charles Augustus Steen (December 1, 1919 – January 1, 2006) was a geologist who made and lost a fortune after discovering a rich uranium deposit in Utah during the uranium boom of the early 1950s.

==Early years==
Charlie Steen was born in 1919 in Caddo, Stephens County, Texas, the son of Charles A. and Rosalie Wilson Steen, and attended high school in Houston. As a teen Steen worked summers for a construction company that helped finance his education; this is the same company that his first stepfather Lisle had died working at. He went on to study at John Tarleton Agricultural College in Stephenville, Texas, where he met his wife Minnie Lee Holland, and in 1940 transferred to the College of Mines and Metallurgy of the University of Texas, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in geology in 1943.

Ineligible for the draft because of his poor eyesight, Steen spent World War II working as a petroleum geologist in the Amazon Basin of Bolivia and Peru. Returning to Texas in 1945, he married Minnie Lee (&quot;M.L.&quot;). He started graduate school at the University of Chicago but after a year returned to Houston to take a job doing field work for the Standard Oil Company of Indiana. However, within two years he had been fired for insubordination and had trouble getting a job as a geologist anywhere in the oil industry.

==The uranium boom==

While unemployed, Steen read in the December 1949 issue of &quot;The Engineering and Mining Journal&quot; that the United States federal government had issued incentives for domestic uranium prospectors. Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission had the authority to withdraw lands from the private sector in order to examine them as possible sites for uranium mining. During World War II, the Manhattan Project had received most of its uranium from foreign sources in Canada and the Belgian Congo. However, it had also received some from vanadium miners in the American Southwest, where uranium was often a by-product of mining (before the atomic bomb uranium was not a valuable metal). There was a concern that the United States would not have enough domestic supply of uranium for its nuclear weapons program.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s the Atomic Energy Commission established itself as the only legal buyer of uranium in the U.S. and artificially manipulated prices to reflect their current uranium needs. By raising the price of uranium, they created an incentive for prospectors in the Four Corners region.

Despite the fact that his three sons, Johnny, Andy and Charles Jr. were all less than four years old and his wife was expecting another child, Steen borrowed $1,000 from his mother and headed for the Colorado Plateau, determined to strike it rich. After being in Colorado for several months, the Steens moved into a tarpaper shack in Cisco, Utah. Steen and his family were struggling to get by and were often hungry so Charlie made the decision to move his family to Tucson, Arizona. Steen worked as a carpenter in Tucson for about a year before he returned to his claims in Utah. He and his family once again packed up and headed to their claims. This final trip back to Utah would be the most detrimental for the family because Steen&#x27;s wife contracted pneumonia, and her medical bills consumed the $350 remaining from the sale of Steen&#x27;s trailer.

Steen could not afford the standard radiation-detecting equipment used by uranium prospectors - the Geiger counter. Instead, he used a secondhand diamond drill rig and his geologic training for his prospecting. At the time, each prospector had his own idiosyncratic theory about where to find uranium. The uranium industry was composed primarily of individual prospectors and geologists who would attempt to find a large deposit and either mine it for themselves or mine it for a large company (such as Union Carbide) who would transport the ore from the mine to the uranium mill where it could be converted into yellowcake. Steen&#x27;s theory on uranium deposits was that they would collect in anticlinal structures in the same manner as oil, which others on the Plateau dismissed as &quot;Steen&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

==Mi Vida uranium deposit==

On July 6, 1952, Steen reached uranium, however he didn&#x27;t realize until three weeks later. He was drilling down through the layers of sandstone when his drill bit broke off at a depth of 197 feet, just 3 feet short of his goal. Finding this massive deposit of uranium ore only became apparent when he took a piece of the blackish core he found while drilling weeks earlier back to Cisco. He stopped to fill up his jeep and decided to have the core tested by a friend with a Geiger counter and they found that the piece made the Geiger counter needle fluctuate wildly. The high grade uranium deposit was located at Big Indian Wash of Lisbon Valley, southeast of Moab, Utah (). Sometimes recognized as one of the most important deposits of any kind found during the last century, the claim was named the &quot;Mi Vida&quot; mine (My Life) by Steen. The Mi Vida mine was one of the first big strikes of the uranium boom. Steen made millions off his claims, and provoked a &quot;Uranium Rush&quot; of prospectors into the Four Corners region, similar to the Gold Rush of the 1850s in California.

In Moab, Steen built a $250,000 hilltop mansion to replace his tarpaper shack, with a swimming pool, greenhouse, and servants&#x27; quarters. the home he built still stands and has been transformed into a restaurant called The Sunset Grill, named because the structure looks over the valley towards the sunset in the west. He also formed a number of companies to continue his uranium work, including the Utex Exploration Company, the Moab Drilling Company, the Mi Vida Company, Big Indian Mines, Inc., and later the Uranium Reduction Company. He made his money well-known, inviting the entire population of Moab to annual parties in a local airport hangar, having his original worn prospecting boots bronzed, and flying to Salt Lake City in his private plane for weekly rumba lessons. He donated $50,000 towards a new hospital in Moab and gave land for churches and schools.

==Political involvement==
Steen was elected to the Utah State Senate in 1958 as a Republican, but quickly became disillusioned with politics. He resigned from office in 1961 and moved to a ranch near Reno, Nevada, building a 27,000 square foot (2,500 m2) mansion near the residence of the Comstock millionaire miner, Sandy Bowers. He sold the Utex Exploration Company and the Uranium Reduction Company in 1962.

==After the uranium rush==
By the late 1950s, the US government had enough uranium for its needs and had stopped supporting high prices of the ore, killing the market by 1960. Steen attempted to diversify his interests by investing in Arabian horse breeding, a marble quarry, an airplane factory, a pickle plant, and real estate. He met with financial losses and misfortune. In 1968 he filed for bankruptcy after the Internal Revenue Service seized his assets to pay back taxes. In 1971 he suffered a severe head injury working on a copper prospect.

==Death==
Long-suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Steen died on January 1, 2006, in Loveland, Colorado. Minnie Lee died on July 14, 1997. Their ashes were scattered at the Mi Vida mine site.

==Legacy==

Steen&#x27;s legacy lives on through his four sons who were once the recipients of a $130 million fortune that their father lost after the decline of the uranium market in the late 1950s. Although Steen lost most of his fortune after the uranium crash due to poor money management and frivolous spending, he is still recognized for his Cold War contributions for supplying the United States with all of the uranium it needed for its weapons program. His story about finding the Mi Vida mine inspired two films and several books along with getting the small desert town of Moab, Utah, on the map as &quot;The Uranium Capital of the World&quot; and the &quot;Richest Town in America&quot;. After Steen struck it rich, he requested that Congress allow him to build his own mill without government funding, resulting in the only major atomic facility to be privately funded.

On November 4, 2016, a historical marker commemorating the Lisbon Valley&#x27;s uranium heritage and noting Charlie Steen&#x27;s discovery was dedicated on the Anticline Overlook road off U.S. 191. The marker was funded entirely by private donations. Artist Michael Ford Dunton created an arch to frame the historical marker and the view to the location of the Mi Vida mine, seven miles east of the marker.

<doc id="1013834" wikidata="Q511263" url="?curid=1013834" title="Beverage antenna">
<text>The Beverage antenna or &quot;wave antenna&quot; is a long-wire receiving antenna mainly used in the low frequency and medium frequency radio bands, invented by Harold H. Beverage in 1921. It is used by amateur radio operators, shortwave listeners, longwave radio DXers and for military applications.

A Beverage antenna consists of a horizontal wire from one-half to several wavelengths long (tens to hundreds of meters; yards at HF to several kilometres; miles for longwave) suspended above the ground, with the feedline to the receiver attached to one end, and the other end of the wire terminated through a resistor to ground. The antenna has a unidirectional radiation pattern with the main lobe of the pattern at a shallow angle into the sky off the resistor-terminated end, making it ideal for reception of long distance skywave (skip) transmissions from stations over the horizon which reflect off the ionosphere. However the antenna must be built so the wire points in the direction of the transmitter(s) to be received. 

The advantages of the Beverage are excellent directivity, a wider bandwidth than resonant antennas, and a strong ability to receive distant and overseas transmitters. Its disadvantages are its physical size, requiring considerable land area, and inability to rotate to change the direction of reception. Installations often use multiple Beverage antennas to provide wide azimuth coverage.

==History==
Harold Beverage experimented with receiving antennas similar to the Beverage antenna in 1919 at the Otter Cliffs Radio Station. He discovered in 1920 that an otherwise nearly long-wire antenna becomes by placing it close to the lossy earth and by terminating one end of the wire with a resistor. In 1921, Beverage was granted a patent for his antenna. That year, Beverage long-wave receiving antennas up to long had been installed at RCA&#x27;s Riverhead, New York, Belfast, Maine, Belmar, New Jersey, and Chatham, Massachusetts receiver stations for transatlantic radiotelegraphy traffic. Perhaps the largest Beverage antenna—an array of four phased Beverages long and wide—was built by AT&amp;T in Houlton, Maine, for the first transatlantic telephone system opened in 1927.

==Description==


The Beverage antenna consists of a horizontal wire one-half to several wavelengths long, suspended close to the ground, usually high, pointed in the direction of the signal source. At the end toward the signal source it is terminated by a resistor to ground approximately equal in value to the characteristic impedance of the antenna considered as a transmission line, usually 400 to 800 ohms. At the other end it is connected to the receiver with a transmission line, through a balun to match the line to the antenna&#x27;s characteristic impedance.

==Operation==
Unlike other wire antennas such as dipole or monopole antennas which act as resonators, with the radio currents traveling in both directions along the element, bouncing back and forth between the ends as standing waves, the Beverage antenna is a traveling wave antenna; the radio frequency current travels in one direction along the wire, in the same direction as the radio waves. The lack of resonance gives it a wider bandwidth than resonant antennas. It receives vertically polarized radio waves, but unlike other vertically polarized antennas it is suspended close to the ground, and requires some resistance in the ground to work.

The Beverage antenna relies on &quot;wave tilt&quot; for its operation. At low and medium frequencies, a vertically polarized radio frequency electromagnetic wave traveling close to the surface of the earth with finite ground conductivity sustains a loss that causes the wavefront to &quot;tilt over&quot; at an angle. The electric field is not perpendicular to the ground but at an angle, producing an electric field component parallel to the Earth&#x27;s surface. If a horizontal wire is suspended close to the Earth and approximately parallel to the wave&#x27;s direction, the electric field generates an oscillating RF current wave traveling along the wire, propagating in the same direction as the wavefront. The RF currents traveling along the wire add in phase and amplitude throughout the length of the wire, producing maximum signal strength at the far end of the antenna where the receiver is connected.

The antenna wire and the ground under it together can be thought of as a &quot;leaky&quot; transmission line which absorbs energy from the radio waves. The velocity of the current waves in the antenna is less than the speed of light due to the ground. The velocity of the wavefront along the wire is also less than the speed of light due to its angle. At a certain angle &quot;θ&quot;max the two velocities are equal. At this angle the gain of the antenna is maximum, so the radiation pattern has a main lobe at this angle. The angle of the main lobe is
:formula_1
where
:formula_2 is the length of the antenna wire,
:formula_3 is the wavelength.
The antenna has a unidirectional reception pattern, because RF signals arriving from the other direction, from the receiver end of the wire, induce currents propagating toward the terminated end, where they are absorbed by the terminating resistor.

==Gain==

While Beverage antennas have excellent directivity, because they are close to lossy Earth, they do not produce absolute gain; their gain is typically from −20 to −10 dBi. This is rarely a problem, because the antenna is used at frequencies where there are high levels of atmospheric radio noise. At these frequencies the atmospheric noise, and not receiver noise, determines the signal-to-noise ratio, so an inefficient antenna can be used. The weak signal from the antenna can be amplified in the receiver without introducing significant noise. The antenna is not used as a transmitting antenna since, to do so, would mean a large portion of the drive power is wasted in the terminating resistor

Directivity increases with the length of the antenna. While directivity begins to develop at a length of only 0.25 wavelength, directivity becomes more significant at one wavelength and improves steadily until the antenna reaches a length of about two wavelengths. In Beverages longer than two wavelengths, directivity does not increase because the currents in the antenna cannot remain in phase with the radio wave.

==Implementation==
A single-wire Beverage antenna is typically a single straight copper wire, between one-half and two wavelengths long, run parallel to the Earth&#x27;s surface in the direction of the desired signal. The wire is suspended by insulated supports above the ground. A non-inductive resistor approximately equal to the characteristic impedance of the wire, about 400 to 600 ohms, is connected from the far end of the wire to a ground rod. The other end of the wire is connected to the feedline to the receiver.

A dual-wire variant is sometimes utilized for rearward null steering or for bidirectional switching. The antenna can also be implemented as an array of 2 to 128 or more elements in broadside, endfire, and configurations, offering significantly improved directivity otherwise very difficult to attain at these frequencies. A four-element broadside/staggered Beverage array was used by AT&amp;T at their longwave telephone receiver site in Houlton, Maine. Very large phased Beverage arrays of 64 elements or more have been implemented for receiving antennas for over-the-horizon radar systems.

The driving impedance of the antenna is equal to the characteristic impedance of the wire with respect to ground, somewhere between 400 and 800 ohms, depending on the height of the wire. Typically a length of 50-ohm or 75-ohm coaxial cable would be used for connecting the receiver to the antenna endpoint. A matching transformer should be inserted between any such low-impedance transmission line and the higher 470-ohm impedance of the antenna.

<text>In Arctic and Antarctic ecology, a hypolith is a community of photosynthetic organisms, and extremophiles, that live
underneath rocks in climatically extreme deserts such as Cornwallis Island and Devon Island in the Canadian high Arctic. The community itself is the hypolithon.

Hypolithons are protected by their rock from harsh ultraviolet irradiation and wind scouring. The rocks can also trap moisture and are generally translucent allowing light to penetrate while omitting incident ultra-violet light. Writing in &quot;Nature&quot;, ecologist Charles S. Cockell of the British Antarctic Survey and Dale Stokes (Scripps Institution of Oceanography) describe how hypoliths reported to date (until 2004) had been found under quartz, which is one of the most common translucent minerals.

However, Cockell reported that on Cornwallis Island and Devon Island, 94-95% of a random sample of 850 opaque dolomitic rocks were colonized by hypoliths, and found that the communities were dominated by cyanobacteria. The rocks chosen were visually indistinguishable from those nearby, and were about 10 cm across; the hypolithon was visible as a greenish coloured band. Cockell proposed that rock sorting by periglacial action, including that during freeze–thaw cycles, improves light penetration around the edges of rocks (see granular material and Brazil nut effect).

Cockell and Stokes went on to estimate the productivity of the Arctic communities by monitoring the uptake of sodium bicarbonate labelled with Carbon-14 and found that (for Devon Island) productivity of the hypolithon was comparable to that of plants, lichens, and bryophytes combined (0.8 ± 0.3 g m−2 y−1 and 1 ± 0.4 g m−2 y−1 respectively) and concluded that the polar hypolithon may double previous estimates of the productivity of that region of the rocky polar desert.

<doc id="1013836" wikidata="Q7385167" url="?curid=1013836" title="Ryle's regress">
<text>In philosophy, Ryle&#x27;s regress is a classic argument against cognitivist theories, and concludes that such theories are essentially meaningless as they do not explain what they purport to. 

==Overview==
The philosopher Gilbert Ryle was concerned with what he called the &quot;intellectualist legend&quot; (also known as the &quot;Dogma of the ghost in the machine,&quot; the &quot;Two-Lives Legend,&quot; the &quot;Two-Worlds Story,&quot; or the &quot;Double-Life Legend&quot;) which requires intelligent acts to be the product of the conscious application of mental rules. In other words Ryle argued against Cartesian dualism. 

A fine summation of the position which Ryle was defeating is the famous statement by Ralph Waldo Emerson that, &quot;The ancestor of every action is a thought.&quot; In sharp contrast to such assertions, which rule out any other possible parentage to actions by the use of the word &quot;every,&quot; Ryle argued in &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; (1949) that the intellectualist legend results in an infinite regress of thought: 

:According to the legend, whenever an agent does anything intelligently, his act is preceded and steered by another internal act of considering a regulative proposition appropriate to his practical problem. [...] Must we then say that for the hero&#x27;s reflections how to act to be intelligent he must first reflect how best to reflect how to act? The endlessness of this implied regress shows that the application of the criterion of appropriateness does not entail the occurrence of a process of considering this criterion. (&quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; (1949), p. 31.)

:The crucial objection to the intellectualist legend is this. The consideration of propositions is itself an operation the execution of which can be more or less intelligent, less or more stupid. But if, for any operation to be intelligently executed, a prior theoretical operation had first to be performed and performed intelligently, it would be a logical impossibility for anyone ever to break into the circle. (&quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; (1949), p. 31.)

Variants of Ryle&#x27;s regress are commonly aimed at cognitivist theories. For instance, in order to explain the behavior of rats, Edward Tolman suggested that the rats were constructing a &quot;cognitive map&quot; that helped them locate reinforcers, and he used intentional terms (e.g., expectancies, purposes, meanings) to describe their behavior. This led to a famous attack on Tolman&#x27;s work by Edwin R. Guthrie who pointed out that if one was implying that every action must be preceded by a cognitive &#x27;action&#x27; (a &#x27;thought&#x27; or &#x27;schema&#x27; or &#x27;script&#x27; or whatever), then what &#x27;causes&#x27; this act? (a physical feeling perhaps?) Clearly it must be preceded by another cognitive action, which must in turn be preceded by another and so on, in an infinite regress (always a sign that something has gone wrong with a theory). Guthrie&#x27;s key point is that Tolman&#x27;s explanation, which attempts to explain animal cognition, does not really explain anything at all. 

As a further example, we may take note of the following statement from &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot;:

:The main object of this chapter is to show that there are many activities which directly display qualities of mind, yet are neither themselves intellectual operations nor yet effects of intellectual operations. Intelligent practice is not a step-child of theory. On the contrary theorizing is one practice amongst others and is itself intelligently or stupidly conducted.

In light of Ryle&#x27;s critique, we may translate the statement by Emerson (still very much in common currency) into: &quot;The ancestor of every action is an action.&quot; (This is so, since Ryle notes that, &quot;theorizing is one practice amongst others.&quot;) - a reminder of Thomas Aquinas. Or we can go even further and argue that, according to Ryle: &quot;The ancestor of every behavior is a behavior&quot;. 

As the use of the word &#x27;behaviour&#x27; in the sentence above indicates, Ryle&#x27;s regress arises from the Behaviorist tradition. Near the end of &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot;, Ryle states

:The Behaviorists’ methodological program has been of revolutionary importance to the program of psychology. But more, it has been one of the main sources of the philosophical suspicion that the two-worlds story is a myth. (&quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; (1949), p. 328.)

Ryle&#x27;s brand of logical behaviorism is not to be confused with the radical behaviorism of B. F. Skinner, or the methodological behaviorism of John B. Watson. Alex Byrne noted that &quot;Ryle was indeed, as he reportedly said, &#x27;only one arm and one leg a behaviorist&#x27;.&quot;

Cognitive scientists have Ryle&#x27;s regress as a potential problem with their theories. A desideratum for those is a principled account of how the (potentially) infinite regress that emerges can be stopped. See also the homunculus fallacy.

== Response to Ryle&#x27;s regress ==
Immanuel Kant anticipated Ryle&#x27;s regress when he wrote in &quot;The Critique of Pure Reason&quot; the following: 

&quot;But of reason one cannot say that before the state in which it determines the power of choice, another state precedes in which this state itself is determined. For since reason itself is not an appearance and is not subject at all to any conditions of sensibility, no temporal sequence takes place in it even as to its causality, and thus the dynamical law of nature, which determines the temporal sequence according to rules, cannot be applied to it.&quot;

In essence, Kant is saying that Reason is outside of the causative elements of the natural world and as such is not subject to the law of cause and effect. Hence, for Kant, Reason needs no prior explanation for any of its choices or volitions. Ryle&#x27;s assumption is that all volitions are physicalistic processes and thus subject to cause and effect. If such is the case, then Ryle would be correct in his regress. However, if some volitions are not subject to cause and effect, per Kant, then Ryle&#x27;s regress fails.

<text>Monstrous Regiment is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the 31st novel in his &quot;Discworld&quot; series. It takes its name from a 16th-century tract by John Knox opposing female rule, titled &quot;The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women&quot;.

The cover illustration of the British edition, by Paul Kidby, is a parody of Joe Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot;. &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot; was nominated for a Locus Award in 2004.

==Plot summary==
The small, belligerent country of Borogravia is a highly conservative nation, whose people live according to the increasingly strange decrees of its deity, Nuggan. The main feature of his religion is the Abominations; a long, often-updated list of banned things. These things include garlic, cats, the smell of beets, people with ginger hair, shirts with six buttons, anyone shorter than three feet (namely dwarves, children and babies), sneezing, jigsaw puzzles, chocolate (which was once Borogravia&#x27;s staple export, plunging the country into increasing poverty), crop rotation (which degraded Borogravia&#x27;s soil and reduced already scarce food supplies), and the colour blue.

Borogravia is in the midst of a war against an alliance of neighbouring countries, caused by a border dispute with the country of Zlobenia. Prince Heinrich of Zlobenia claims to be heir to the Borogravian throne through his aunt, the long-unseen Duchess. Ankh-Morpork has become involved following the destruction of Clacks towers by Borogravia. Rumours that the war is going poorly for Borogravia are denied by the country&#x27;s leadership.

Polly Perks&#x27;s brother Paul is missing in action after fighting in the Borogravian army. Polly is unable to take over the family business (a famous pub known as &quot;The Duchess&quot;), as Nugganitic law does not permit women to own property. If Paul does not return the pub will be lost to their drunken cousin when their father dies. Partly to ensure her own future but mainly to ascertain whether Paul is alive, Polly sets off to join the army in order to find him. Women joining the army are regarded as an Abomination Unto Nuggan, so Polly dresses up as a man and enlists as Private Oliver Perks (taking her name from the folk song &quot;Sweet Polly Oliver&quot;).

While signing up, Polly encounters the repulsively patriotic Corporal Strappi, and the corpulent Sergeant Jackrum. Despite her apprehensions regarding Strappi, she joins up. Due to the shortage of troops, her fellow soldiers include a vampire named Maladict, a troll named Carborundum, and an Igor named Igor, along with humans &quot;Tonker&quot; Halter, &quot;Shufti&quot; Manickle, &quot;Wazzer&quot; Goom, and &quot;Lofty&quot; Tewt.

That night, Polly meets an unknown supporter whilst answering a call of nature, who assures her that although they know that Polly is a girl, they won&#x27;t give her away. They give her some hints on how not to be discovered. Over the next few days, Polly discovers Lofty is also a girl. Since Lofty and Tonker are always together, Polly assumes that Lofty joined the army to follow her man. Later, she finds out that Shufti is also a girl, and pregnant. They joined the army to find the father of Shufti&#x27;s child. Gradually, Polly discovers not only that everyone in her regiment is female, but also receives confirmation of Borogravia&#x27;s bleak situation. Most of her country&#x27;s forces are captured or on the run, and food supplies are limited. 

The regiment, under the leadership of the inexperienced Lieutenant Blouse, makes its way toward the Keep where the enemy is based. Thanks to a chance encounter where the regiment unknowingly subdue and humiliate an elite Zlobenian detachment, including Prince Heinrich, their exploits become known to the outside world through William de Worde and his newspaper, &quot;The Ankh-Morpork Times&quot;. Their progress particularly piques the interest of Commander Vimes, who is stationed as a special envoy with the alliance at the Keep. Vimes has his officers keep track of the regiment, occasionally secretly providing aid. 

Polly and most of the regiment are able to infiltrate the Keep, disguised as washerwomen. Once inside they plot to release the captured Borogravian troops. They manage to do so, and Borogravia is able to retake much of the Keep, but when Polly admits they are women, their own forces remove them from the conflict and they are brought in front of a council of senior officers. With the council about to discharge them and force them to return home, Jackrum barges in and intervenes, revealing that a third of the military&#x27;s top officers (including Chief of the General Staff General Froc) are women as well. In the midst of this revelation, the Duchess, now raised to the level of a small deity by Borogravians&#x27; belief, takes brief possession of Wazzer, her most passionate believer. The Duchess urges all of the generals to quit the war and return home to repair their country, ending their obligation to her. It is revealed that Nuggan is now dead, being reduced to a whisper, with the new Abominations (the last being rocks, ears and accordion players) being produced by the collective anxiety of his &#x27;worshippers&#x27;.

In a private moment with Jackrum, Polly reveals to her Sergeant that she now knows he is a woman and persuades Jackrum to go to the home of his grown son William and reveal himself as William&#x27;s long-lost father. A truce is successfully negotiated, and military rules are changed so that women are allowed to serve openly. Maladict reveals himself as really being Maladicta. Polly finds her brother alive and well and they return home to the Duchess with Shufti, who joins Polly in her refusal to be subjugated on the basis of her gender and marital status. The other members of the regiment go on to lives that they would not have been able to consider before their emancipation.

Sometime later, despite the peace they had desperately fought for, conflict breaks out again. Polly, having received correspondence from Sgt Jackrum, leaves the tavern to seek new ways to fight a war using the influence she gained and finds herself in the role of commander of boy-impersonating young women who are marching off to war, reuniting with Maladicta.

==Reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot; &quot;had serious heft&quot;, comparing Pratchett&#x27;s depiction of &quot;the pity of war&quot; to Wilfred Owen. The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, addressing the 2014 stage adaptation, considered it to be largely &quot;a satire on the flimsiness of traditional gender roles&quot;, while &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; noted its &quot;astute comments on power, religious intolerance and sexual stereotyping&quot;.

At &quot;Boing Boing&quot;, Cory Doctorow lauded Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;capacity for marvellous bathos&quot;, &quot;epic&quot; characterization, and &quot;drum-tight&quot; plotting, commending the &quot;sprightliness&quot; with which the novel&#x27;s philosophical themes are integrated into the text. &quot;PopMatters&quot; felt that the book lacked subtlety, but was &quot;more than one-dimensional&quot;, commending Pratchett for &quot;manag[ing] to walk right on the edge of proselytizing without ever quite crossing over&quot; and for showing that there is no &quot;clear-cut solution&quot; to the issues which led to the Borogravian conflict. &quot;BuzzFeed&quot;, however, was far more negative, calling it &quot;clunky&quot;, and ranking it last among the adult-oriented Discworld novels published prior to the announcement of Pratchett&#x27;s diagnosis with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<text>Movements in cognitive science are considered to be post-cognitivist if they are opposed to or move beyond the cognitivist theories posited by Noam Chomsky, Jerry Fodor, David Marr, and others.

Postcognitivists challenge tenets within cognitivism, including ontological , representational realism, that cognition is independent of processes outside the mind and nervous system, that the electronic computer is an appropriate analogy for the mind, and that cognition occurs only within individuals.

Researchers who have followed post-cognitive directions include James J. Gibson, Hubert Dreyfus, Gregory Bateson, Michael Turvey, Bradd Shore, Jerome Bruner, Vittorio Guidano, Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela.

==Hubert Dreyfus&#x27; critique of cognitivism==

Using the principles of Martin Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy, Dreyfus has been critical of cognitivism from the beginning. Despite continued resistance by old-school philosophers of cognition, he felt vindicated by the growth of new approaches. When Dreyfus&#x27; ideas were first introduced in the mid-1960s, they were met with ridicule and outright hostility. By the 1980s, however, many of his perspectives were rediscovered by researchers working in robotics and the new field of connectionism—approaches now called &quot;sub-symbolic&quot; because they eschew early artificial intelligence (AI) research&#x27;s emphasis on high level symbols. Historian and AI researcher Daniel Crevier writes: &quot;time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus&#x27;s comments.&quot; Dreyfus said in 2007 &quot;I figure I won and it&#x27;s over—they&#x27;ve given up.&quot;

In &quot;Mind Over Machine&quot; (1986), written during the heyday of expert systems, Dreyfus analyzed the difference between human expertise and the programs that claimed to capture it. This expanded on ideas from &quot;What Computers Can&#x27;t Do&quot;, where he had made a similar argument criticizing the &quot;cognitive simulation&quot; school of AI research practiced by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon in the 1960s.

Dreyfus argued that human problem solving and expertise depend on our background sense of the context, of what is important and interesting given the situation, rather than on the process of searching through combinations of possibilities to find what we need. Dreyfus would describe it in 1986 as the difference between &quot;knowing-that&quot; and &quot;knowing-how&quot;, based on Heidegger&#x27;s distinction of present-at-hand and ready-to-hand.

Knowing-that is our conscious, step-by-step problem-solving abilities. We use these skills when we encounter a difficult problem that requires us to stop, step back and search through ideas one at a time. At moments like this, the ideas become very precise and simple: they become context-free symbols, which we manipulate using logic and language. These are the skills that Newell and Simon had demonstrated with both psychological experiments and computer programs. Dreyfus agreed that their programs adequately imitated the skills he calls &quot;knowing-that&quot;.

Knowing-how, on the other hand, is the way we deal with things normally. We take actions without using conscious symbolic reasoning at all, as when we recognize a face, drive ourselves to work, or find the right thing to say. We seem to simply jump to the appropriate response, without considering any alternatives. This is the essence of expertise, Dreyfus argued: when our intuitions have been trained to the point that we forget the rules and simply &quot;size up the situation&quot; and react.

The human sense of the situation, according to Dreyfus, is based on our goals, our bodies, and our culture—all of our unconscious intuitions, attitudes, and knowledge about the world. This &quot;context&quot; or &quot;background&quot; (related to Heidegger&#x27;s Dasein) is a form of knowledge that is not stored in our brains symbolically, but intuitively in some way. It affects what we notice and what we do not, what we expect, and what possibilities we do not consider: we discriminate between what is essential and inessential. The things that are inessential are relegated to our &quot;fringe consciousness&quot; (borrowing a phrase from William James): the millions of things we are aware of but are not really thinking about right now.

Dreyfus did not believe that AI programs, as they were implemented in the 1970s and 1980s, could capture this &quot;background&quot; or do the kind of fast problem solving that it allows. He argued that our unconscious knowledge could &quot;never&quot; be captured symbolically. If AI could not find a way to address these issues, then it was doomed to failure, an exercise in &quot;tree climbing with one&#x27;s eyes on the moon.&quot;

The commune&#x27;s purpose was to raise consciousness through media, specifically full-cast audio dramas. The foundation is &quot;one of the most prolific producers of contemporary radio drama.&quot;

The commune started with 18 people, and an island in the Hudson River was chosen as the location because it was between New York City and Montreal. Eventually, the commune disintegrated, and the foundation moved to create an artists-in-residence program over the next decade. Allen Ginsberg recorded at ZBS in 1981, and Laurie Anderson visited in 1975. Philip Glass also worked on the opera &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; at ZBS. The residency program ended in the mid 1980s.

The foundation also became the outlet for audio dramas written by writer/producer Lopez. His dramatic programs, notably &quot;Ruby the Galactic Gumshoe&quot;, &quot;The Fourth Tower of Inverness&quot; and &quot;Travels with Jack Flanders&quot;, are noted for their meticulous production values and New Age mysticism. Lopez has won numerous awards including the Prix Italia, and his work enjoys a cult following.

ZBS did a 1984–85 radio series, &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Fritz&quot;, later releasing some shows in the series on cassettes and CDs. These productions were recorded binaurally using a Neumann Ku81 Kunstkopf microphone. ZBS also produced a widely acclaimed dramatization of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Mist&quot;, recording in binaural sound.

<text>The AAA battery (or triple-A battery) is a standard size of dry cell battery. One or more AAA batteries are commonly used in low-drain portable electronic devices. A zinc–carbon battery in this size is designated by IEC as R03, by ANSI C18.1 as 24, by old JIS standard as UM-4, and by other manufacturer and national standard designations that vary depending on the cell chemistry. The size was first introduced by The American Ever Ready Company in 1911. In China, they are called #7 batteries, the name originating from the Burgess Battery Company designating his AAA batteries &quot;Number 7&quot;.

An AAA battery is a single cell that measures in diameter and in length, including the positive terminal button, which is a minimum . The positive terminal has a maximum diameter of ; the flat negative terminal has a minimum diameter of . Alkaline AAA batteries weigh around , while primary lithium AAA batteries weigh about . Rechargeable nickel–metal hydride (NiMH) AAA batteries typically weigh .

==Use==
AAA batteries are most often used in small electronic devices, such as TV remote controls, MP3 players and digital cameras. Devices that require the same voltage, but have a higher current draw, are often designed to use larger batteries such as the AA battery type. AA batteries have about three times the capacity of AAA batteries. With the increasing efficiency and miniaturization of modern electronics, many devices that previously were designed for AA batteries (remote controls, cordless computer mice and keyboards, etc.) are being replaced by models that accept AAA battery cells.

As of 2007, AAA batteries accounted for 24% of alkaline primary battery sales in the United States. In Japan as of 2011, 28% of alkaline primary batteries sold were AAA. In Switzerland as of 2007, AAA batteries totaled 30% of primary battery sales and 32% of secondary battery (rechargeable) sales.

<doc id="1013868" wikidata="Q14981199" url="?curid=1013868" title="Lost in Translation (novel)">
<text>Lost in Translation is a novel written by American author Nicole Mones, published by Bantam Dell in 1999. It is the story of an American woman trying to lose her past by living as a translator in China. The novel&#x27;s accolades include the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize, the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Award, and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; Notable Book and Editor&#x27;s Choice.

== Summary ==
Expatriate translator Alice Mannegan spends her nights in Beijing&#x27;s smoky bars, seeking fleeting encounters with Chinese men to blot out the shame of her racist father back in Texas. But when she signs on to an archaeological expedition searching for the missing bones of Peking Man in China&#x27;s remote Northwest deserts, her world cracks open. As the group follows the trail of the Jesuit philosopher/paleontologist Teilhard de Chardin to close in on one of archaeology&#x27;s greatest mysteries, Alice finds herself increasingly drawn to a Chinese professor who is shackled by his own painful memories. Love in all its forms–human, sexual, divine, between a nation and its history, a man and his past, a father and his daughter–drives the story to its breathtaking finish.

== Background ==
In a blog interview discussing her works, Mones described Alice, the main character, as &quot;one of the few characters who really seemed to write herself&quot;. Mones also recalls her past working in China as an inspiration for Alice:When I was young, I was close to a young man whose father was suspected of having committed a racially motivated murder during the Civil Rights movement in the U.S. in the early 1960s. The burden of second-hand guilt lay heavy on my friend, and he moved to Hong Kong and refused to return to America. Then, he was killed in an accident. Looking back, I think I started writing the novel a few years after his death in order to play out his story and give it an ending.

== Reception ==

=== Reviews ===
BookPage&#x27;s Julie Checkoway called &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; an &quot;ambitious debut novel&quot; and highlighted the book&#x27;s driving question: &quot;Isn&#x27;t ancestry, one&#x27;s place in a personal, familial and cultural lineage, a difficult fact to ignore or erase?&quot;

Lisa See, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, discussed how Mones &quot;used her story to talk about race and racism, especially in the ways that Chinese and Americans view each other.&quot; See noted that &quot;while Mones seems to be exploring issues of race and taboo, her treatment of them is finally muddled. Still, her search for [...] that enigmatic place where man and woman fall in love is thought-provoking, sometimes disturbing and undeniably entertaining.&quot;

=== Awards and honors ===
&quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; named &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; a notable book.

<text>Valhalla is a text adventure with graphics published in 1983 by the British studio Legend for the ZX Spectrum. It reached number one in the UK sales charts. The Commodore 64 version of the game was released in 1984 and reached number five.

==Gameplay==

In &quot;Valhalla&quot; the characters move through various Nordic locations with accompanying text at the bottom of the screen detailing all character actions. It is set mainly in Asgard and Midgard, though when the character dies, it reappears in Hell (Niflheim under another name) and is able to walk out.

The game&#x27;s text parser understands most multi-part sentences, as long as they are written using the words listed in the manual. Listing the accepted words was not seen in most similar titles of the time.

The aim is to collect six mythical objects: Ofnir (key), Drapnir (ring), Skornir (shield), Skalir (sword), Felstrong (axe), and Grimnir (helmet). To obtain all the items, the player receives help from various characters from Norse mythology. If the player dies while holding any of the six items, it will be lost and moved to a new location. These objects are required to access otherwise unreachable parts of the game, such as Valhalla, but carrying any of the items saps the player&#x27;s strength. 

The character has an alignment (between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;) that changes depending on which of the other characters are helped. The more the player helps good characters, the more other good characters will help the player in their quest. Characters include gods, goddesses, dwarves, dragons, wolves, a snake, and a raven. 

The characters move and interact independent of any action by the player. If the player does nothing, the game &#x27;plays&#x27; itself, with the characters moving about while the player decides what to do.

Typing in a swear word causes a dwarf to dash onto the screen to punch the player while generating the message &quot;Mary is not amused...&quot;. Mary can be found in El Vinos and even if killed, she returns within a minute.

The game engine has a limit of eight objects to be left in any one location, whether on the ground, in a chest, or in a cupboard. If the player drops an object in an area where the limit has been reached, a character called Klepto appears to steal the item, removing it from the game.

== Development ==
The publishing house Legend, founded and managed by John Peel, had previously published titles under the Microl label which financed the development of &quot;Valhalla&quot;. The game was developed by Richard Edwards, Graham Asher, Charles Goodwin, James Learmont, and Andrew Owen using a system they named &quot;Movisoft&quot; which Peel hoped would become &quot;the adventure game equivalent of CP/M&quot;. The system occupied 4K of the game footprint and used machine code, with the rest of the game engine and text parser written in Sinclair BASIC. The C64 version of the game was released in the first half of 1984 and featured larger and coloured character graphics.

The cover of the game, as well as the loading screen, features a drawing of the Sutton Hoo helmet, an artifact from the 7th century believed to have belonged to King Rædwald of East Anglia.

<text>Alvin Morell Bentley III (August 30, 1918 – April 10, 1969) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. As four-term a U.S. representative from 1953 to 1961, he made national headlines as one of the wounded of the 1954 United States Capitol shooting.

==Early years==
Bentley, the only child of Alvin M. Bentley Jr., and Helen Webb Bentley, was born in Portland, Maine, only three months before his father died serving in France during World War I. Although fatherless, Bentley was heir to a family fortune, from his grandfather who founded the Owosso Manufacturing Company.

He graduated in 1934 from Southern Pines High School in Southern Pines, North Carolina, and in 1936 from Asheville Prep School in Asheville, North Carolina. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1940 from the University of Michigan and attended Turner&#x27;s Diplomatic School, Washington, D.C., to qualify for the U.S. diplomatic service.

==Government service==
He served as vice consul and secretary with the United States Foreign Service, serving in Mexico (1942–1944), Colombia (1945–1946), Hungary (1947–1949), and Italy (1949–1950). He returned to Washington, D.C., on March 15, 1950, for work in the State Department.

Disagreeing with the Truman administration&#x27;s foreign policy, Bentley resigned from the diplomatic service in 1950 and returned to live in Owosso, Michigan. He was a delegate to Republican State conventions in 1950, 1951, and 1952. He was vice president of Lake Huron Broadcasting Company, Saginaw, Michigan, starting in 1952, and a director of Mitchell-Bentley Corporation.

In 1952, Bentley defeated the incumbent Republican U.S. Representative Fred L. Crawford in the primary election for Michigan&#x27;s 8th congressional district and went on to win in the 1952 general election. Bentley was elected to the Eighty-third and to the three succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1953, to January 3, 1961. Bentley voted present on the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1960. He was not a candidate for re-nomination in 1960, instead running for a seat in the United States Senate and losing to Democratic incumbent Patrick V. McNamara in the 1960 general election.

=== 1954 House shooting incident ===
Bentley was one of five Representatives shot in the March 1, 1954 United States Capitol shooting, when four Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire from the visitors&#x27; balcony into the chamber of the United States House of Representatives. Bentley was shot in the chest and abdomen but survived.

==Career during the 1960s==
From 1961 to 1962, Bentley was a delegate from the 15th Senatorial District to the Michigan State Constitutional Convention, which produced the Michigan state constitution adopted in 1963. In 1962, Bentley again ran for the U.S. House for a one-term, at-large seat created as a result of the 1960 U.S. Census, but he lost in the general election to Democrat Neil Staebler. He continued public service by receiving appointments to education-related positions in the state. Also, after leaving Congress in 1961, he had returned to the University of Michigan as a graduate student in the History department.

Alvin M. Bentley served on the board of directors for the National Conference on Citizenship in 1960.

While continuing to maintain offices in Washington, D.C., Bentley commuted by air to Ann Arbor to attend classes. He received an M.A. degree in 1963. In 1966, while pursuing a doctoral degree, Governor George W. Romney appointed him to the board of regents of the University of Michigan.

Bentley died, aged 50, while on vacation in Tucson, Arizona, of an &quot;inflammation affecting the central nervous system&quot;. Bentley had been confined at a wheelchair for two years after &quot;corrective surgery&quot; when his condition suddenly worsened. He is interred in Oak Hill Cemetery in Owosso, Michigan.

==Philanthropy==
In 1961, Bentley established the Alvin M. Bentley Foundation to support educational, scientific, and charitable projects. Through the foundation, Bentley continues to foster academic excellence in the state of Michigan.

In 1983, the foundation established the Bentley Scholarships at the University of Michigan for Michigan residents who have demonstrated academic excellence and promise. The foundation also sponsors Operation Bentley, &quot;a week-long intensive academic program held at Albion College for high school juniors who have been selected to participate in a rigorous and rewarding study of local, state, and national politics.&quot;

In 1967, he contributed money to the University of Michigan to establish an endowed professorship in the Department of History in memory of his parents.

In the mid-1960s, Bentley served as chairman of the &quot;Michigan Freedom from Hunger Council&quot;, a humanitarian organization set up to gather, interpret, and disseminate information about hunger problems in the world, especially in the Western Hemisphere. Bentley also chaired the Michigan branch of the &quot;Partners of the Alliance&quot;, an organization that had begun nationally in 1964, to act as a channel through which civic clubs, unions, business and professional groups, schools, and individuals could work directly with groups, villages, or areas in Latin America to improve the way of life in that particular area. The objective was not charity, but the promotion of self-help programs. The State of Michigan took British Honduras (Belize) as its partner.

== Death and burial ==
He died on April 10, 1969, at the age of 50.
In 1971, his widow, Arvella D. Bentley, gave a generous donation to the University of Michigan&#x27;s &quot;Michigan Historical Collections&quot;, enabling it to construct a new building which was subsequently renamed the Bentley Historical Library.

<text>The Limbu (Limbu: ) are a Sino-Tibetan ethnolinguistic group indigenous to the Himalayan region of eastern Nepal (Limbuwan ᤕᤠᤀᤷᤓᤢᤅ ᤗᤠᤈᤣ), Sikkim, Assam, Nagaland, northern West Bengal (North Bengal), and western Bhutan.

Subba is a title given by the Shah Kings only to Limbu village chiefs. Subba was not an indigenous Limbu terminology, but now the two terms are almost interchangeable. It was how the village chiefs were distinguished from other villagers in Limbu tribe. Family lineage of the village chiefs are often found with their surname as Subba.

Their history is said to be written in a book called Bangsawoli (Genealogy), also known as Bansawali. Some ancient families have kept copies. There are hundreds of Limbu clans and tribes, classified under their tribe or subnational entity or according to their place of origin.

The Chinese text &quot;Po-ou-Yeo-Jing&quot;, translated in 308 AD, refers to the Yi-ti-Sai (barbarians bordering on the north), a name which is an exact equivalent of 
The Limbu, were also one of the earliest inhabitants of Sikkim. The name of the Indian state itself is a combination of two Limbu words: &quot;su&quot;, which means &quot;new&quot;, and &quot;khyim&quot;, which means &quot;palace&quot; or &quot;house&quot;.

The estimated population of the Limbu is 700,000, mainly in the districts of Sankhuwasabha, Tehrathum, Dhankuta, Taplejung, Morang, Sunsari, Jhapa, Panchthar, and Ilam in Nepal. These are all within the Koshi Province or &quot;Limbuwan&quot;. Portions of the Limbu population are also located in the eastern and western districts of Sikkim. A smaller population is scattered throughout the cities of Darjeeling, and Kalimpong in West Bengal, Assam, Nagaland, Bhutan, and Myanmar. Some have migrated to the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, the United States, and other countries.

==Language==
Limbu is one of the few Sino-Tibetan languages of the Central Himalayas that possesses its own pre-20th century scripts.

==Limbu traditional architecture==
The house of the Limbu is a symbolic representation of a goddess of the Limbu community called yuma. The details of the windows and doors are embroidered with wood carvings depicting different flowers which are used by the Limbu during rituals. Some decorative embroideries done in the wood carvings of the door and windows of the house are the direct representation of gold jewelry worn by Limbu women. In a traditional house of the Limbu, the skirting of the wall is generally painted manually with red mud paint. This is also a symbolic representation of the &quot;patuka&quot; or the belt worn by the Limbu women.

The major distinct element of the house in the &quot;muring-sitlam&quot; or the main pillar/column of the house which is in the centre of the house in the ground floor. This pillar is generally believed by the Limbu people as the shrine where Yuma goddess resides in the house. Thus, to pay their gratitude they perform ritualistic prayers and offerings around the pillar, usually twice a year.

These houses can be found at Eastern Nepal and western part of Sikkim, India. These houses are similar to other communities due to acculturation between different communities living in the vicinity. The evolution of the form and spaces of the houses have been inspired by the everyday lifestyle and culture of the people which is similar in many communities. Therefore, nowadays a Limbu house is difficult to identify through an exterior perspective.

Use of geometrical shapes as circle, triangle and square in certain pattern, painted with different colors can be found on the facade of the buildings which is only done by limbu tribe. Besides that, display of the symbol called &quot;Silam-sakma&quot; (a ritualistic element used by the &quot;phedangmas&quot; or tribal priests) in the house elevation has been a symbol/logo for identifying with the Limbu community. This symbol is diamond shaped and has 9 concentric diamond layers supported by two axes at the centre, one vertical and one horizontal. These days, this symbol is seen in places like the entry gates, balcony railing of the house, etc. It is also worn by the community people on their left chest during an event.

Currently, the traditional houses are endangered. People are also unable to bear expenses for wood carvings for the embroideries which has resulted in the extinction of local craftsmen and hence the traditional design itself. 
==Lifestyle==
The Limbu practice subsistence farming traditionally. Rice and maize comprises their principal crops. Although there is an abundance of arable land, productivity is greatly limited by inefficient technology. Excess crops are often traded for food that cannot be grown in the region. Limbu women weave Dhaka fabric cloth on their traditional small hand looms made from bamboo and wood. In the olden days, the Limbu were skilled in silk farming. The limbu were also known as silk traders.

==Wedding practices==
Limbu generally marry within their own community. A Limbu is not allowed to marry within their own clans for up to 3 generations back to ensure that they are not related. Cross-cousin marriage is not allowed in Limbu culture. Marriage between a man and a woman outside the clan is also possible either by arrangement or by mutual consent of the man and woman in question. Being matriarchal tribe, females are given due respect.

The marriages are mostly arranged by parents. Asking for a woman&#x27;s hand is an important ceremony. In that system, the woman can ask for anything, including any amount of gold, silver, etc. This is practiced to confirm that the man is financially secure enough to keep the bride happy. A few days after the wedding, the man&#x27;s family members have to visit the woman&#x27;s house with a piglet and some alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, depending upon the financial status of his house. The most important ceremonies of a Limbu wedding take place in the groom&#x27;s house rather than in the bride&#x27;s because the bride has to stay with her husband. There are two special dances in this ceremony, one is called &quot;Yalakma&quot; or &quot;dhan nach&quot; in Nepali (rice harvest dance) and &quot;Kelangma&quot; or &quot;Chyabrung &quot; in Nepali. The Yalakma is characterized by men and women dancing in a slow circle, whereas the Kelangma consists of complex footwork synchronized with the beat of the drums. Anyone can join the dance, which can last for many hours. The Yalakma can also be a celebration of the harvest season or other social occasions.

It is conventionally said that the customs and traditions of Limbus were established in the distant past by Sawa Yethang (council of eight kings).

==Religion and festivals==

The Limbu follow the social rules and regulation of Mundhum oral &#x27;scripture&#x27; and a religious book. Their religion is known as Kiratism. Traditionally, the Limbu bury their dead, but due to the influence of Hinduism, cremation is becoming popular. Limbu people follow Kirat religion. Some limbu have converted to Christianity. A very different reformist tradition was established by the Limbu guru Phalgunanda, who established the &#x27;Satyahang&#x27; religion.

==Traditional music and singing styles==
 Limbu have a strong belief in. Yumawad is a type of religious scripture which has been kept alive by their religious leaders and handed down verbally from generation to generation. Some of the retellings of Yumawad are also included in Limbu traditional music with social stories, dreams, and everyday life. There has been a rich tradition of the Limbu singing their folk songs. Their folk songs can be divided into the following groups:

==Traditional sports==
For the Limbu people, Archery has always been considered as the main traditional sport. Archery often involves religious demonstrations and rituals. Historically, Limbu cavalry archers were important when resisting invasions before the pre-Nepal era. The word &quot;Limbu&quot; itself came from the word &quot;Lim-pfungh&quot; which in translation means &quot;Shooting-Arrows&quot; or &quot;Act of archery&quot;.

There are legends about the beginning of the Limbuwan–Gorkha War. In these legends, a Gorkha military general met a Limbu hunter in a forest. When the general asked the hunter about his presence and what he was doing, the Limbu hunter replied &quot;Lim-pfungh&quot;. The Gorkha army later experienced the fierceness from the Limbu -Tribes&#x27; horseback archers for years during the Limbuwan–Gorkha War. Thus, the name &quot;Limbu&quot; was recorded on the papers of the Gorkhas to describe the Limbu people. However, after the success of the Gorkha invasion, horse breeding and keeping declined swiftly in Limbu territories.

Bare-hand Wrestling has also been practised among the Limbu men during festivals. This was also used to settle personal matters after a festive drinking in which the losing wrestler would have to pay the winner by buying him a drink or inviting him to his house for a drink of traditional tongba . &quot;naːnt͡ɕʰiŋma&quot; is the term for wrestling in Limbupan.

<text>Located on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Callisto, Valhalla ( ) is the largest multi-ring impact crater in the Solar System. It is named after Valhalla, the hall where warriors are taken after death in Norse mythology.

Valhalla consists of a bright central region 360 km across, an inner ridge and trough zone, and striking concentric rings extending up to about 1,900 km from the center. Several large impact craters and crater chains are superimposed on Valhalla. The multi-ring system may have formed as semi-liquid or liquid material underlying the brittle lithosphere punctured by the impactor slumped towards the center of the crater following the impact.

==General description==

Valhalla is the largest multi-ring basin on Callisto and in the Solar System (with diameter up to 3,800 km). It was discovered by the Voyager probes in 1979–80 and is located on the leading hemisphere of Callisto, in its Jupiter facing quadrant slightly to the north of the equator (at about 18°N latitude and 57°W longitude). From the geological point of view Valhalla consists of three zones: the central zone, the inner ridge-and-trough zone, and the outer trough zone.

The inner zone (diameter of about 360 km) is an example of a palimpsest: a high albedo circular feature of impact origin. The surface in the central zone is relatively smooth and has a mottled appearance. Many impact craters inside it have dark halos. At the high resolution achieved in some &quot;Galileo&quot; images the central part of Valhalla looks like a knobby terrain, where bright knobs are surrounded by dark smooth plains; there is noticeable deficit of small impact craters.

The inner ridge and trough zone surrounds the central palimpsest. The ridges that immediately surround the central zone have steep flanks facing outward. These scarps, when studied at a high resolution, turned out to be discontinuous consisting of a series of small bright knobs surrounded by the smooth dark material. They are obviously very degraded structures. The troughs that are situated further from the center than ridges are sinuous and appear to be graben (about 20 km wide). The inner trough zone extends up to 950 km from the center of Valhalla.

The outer trough zone has a radius of 1500 to 1900 km. Its outer boundary is not well defined. It consists of wide double walled sinuous lineaments (troughs), which like the inner troughs appear to be graben. Although these grabens are wider (up to 30 km) than those in the inner trough zone, they are severely degraded, and are made of a series of small knobs, much like their inner counterparts. There are no indications of volcanic flows or other signs of endogenic activity associated with the graben on the high resolution &quot;Galileo&quot; images as was suggested based on the low resolution Voyager images. So, all structures within Valhalla basin have impact or tectonic origin.

==Craters==

Several prominent impact craters and catenae are located within Valhalla structure. At the northern margin of it Gomul Catena can be found as well as Egdir and Mimir craters. The catena consists of a linear sequence of impact craters and probably resulted from a break-up of a comet (like comet Shoemaker-Levy 9). To the south of Valhalla there are Sarakka and Nar impact craters; to the east of it (at the boundary between the inner and outer trough zones) are Sculd crater and Svol Catena. To the west of Valhalla another large multi-ring basin—Asgard—can be found. The central parts of Valhalla are less cratered than the old plain outside the structure. This indicates that Valhalla is significantly younger than Callisto itself.

==Origin==

The Valhalla multi-ring structure (like other Callistan multi-ring basins) probably resulted from a giant impact, which punctured the outer ridged lithosphere of the moon and entered the underlying layer consisting of a much softer material. The latter can be warm ice or even a liquid ocean, the existence of which can be inferred from magnetometric data. The formation of a ringed structure is caused by the concentric failure of the brittle outer shell (lithosphere) following the impact, after the soft material underlying the lithosphere flows towards the center to fill the cavity excavated by the impact. The absolute age of the Valhalla structure is not known; however, it is the youngest such feature among the five known multi-ring structures on Callisto. Estimates of its age vary from 2 to 4 billion years.

Consistent with this picture, imaging by the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft found no evidence of disruption of the area of Callisto antipodal to Valhalla. Such disrupted terrain normally forms as a result of focusing of the seismic energy at the opposite point after the impact. The absence of such disruption supports the presence of a subsurface ocean, which would have absorbed much of the seismic energy, at the time of Valhalla&#x27;s formation.

==In fiction==
Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Galileo&#x27;s Dream&quot; (2009) contains a detailed description of a large city built around the concentric rings of Valhalla in the 29th century. The same city is briefly mentioned in Robinson&#x27;s &quot;2312&quot;.

<doc id="1013900" wikidata="Q435195" url="?curid=1013900" title="Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.">
<text>Arthur Meier Schlesinger Jr. ( ; born Arthur Bancroft Schlesinger; October 15, 1917 – February 28, 2007) was an American historian, social critic, and public intellectual. The son of the influential historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr. and a specialist in American history, much of Schlesinger&#x27;s work explored the history of 20th-century American liberalism. In particular, his work focused on leaders such as Harry S. Truman, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Robert F. Kennedy. In the 1952 and 1956 presidential campaigns, he was a primary speechwriter and adviser to the Democratic presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson II. Schlesinger served as special assistant and &quot;court historian&quot; to President Kennedy from 1961 to 1963. He wrote a detailed account of the Kennedy administration, from the 1960 presidential campaign to the president&#x27;s state funeral, titled &quot;A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House&quot;, which won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography.

In 1968, Schlesinger actively supported the presidential campaign of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, which ended with Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in Los Angeles. Schlesinger wrote a popular biography, &quot;Robert Kennedy and His Times&quot;, several years later. He later popularized the term &quot;imperial presidency&quot; during the Nixon administration in his 1973 book, &quot;The Imperial Presidency&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Schlesinger was born in Columbus, Ohio, the son of Elizabeth Harriet (née Bancroft) and Arthur M. Schlesinger (1888–1965), who was an influential social historian at Ohio State University and Harvard University, where he directed many PhD dissertations in American history. His paternal grandfather was a Prussian Jew who converted to Protestantism and then married an Austrian Catholic. His mother, a Mayflower descendant, was of German and New England ancestry, as well as a relative of historian George Bancroft, according to family tradition. Schlesinger practiced Unitarianism.

Schlesinger attended the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and received his undergraduate degree at the age of 20 from Harvard College, where he graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1938. After spending the 1938–1939 academic year at Peterhouse, Cambridge, as a Henry Fellow, he was appointed to a three-year Junior Fellowship in the Harvard Society of Fellows in the fall of 1939. At the time, Fellows were not allowed to pursue advanced degrees, &quot;a requirement intended to keep them off the standard academic treadmill&quot;; as such, Schlesinger would never earn a doctorate. His fellowship was interrupted by the United States entering World War II. After failing his military medical examination, Schlesinger joined the Office of War Information. From 1943 to 1945, he served as an intelligence analyst in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA.

Schlesinger&#x27;s service in the OSS allowed him time to complete his first Pulitzer Prize–winning book, &quot;The Age of Jackson&quot;, in 1945. From 1946 to 1954, he was an associate professor at Harvard, becoming a full professor in 1954.

==Political activities before 1960==
In 1947, Schlesinger, together with former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt; Minneapolis Mayor and future Senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; economist and longtime friend John Kenneth Galbraith; and Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr founded Americans for Democratic Action. Schlesinger acted as the ADA&#x27;s national chairman from 1953 to 1954.

After President Harry S. Truman announced he would not run for a second full term in the 1952 presidential election, Schlesinger became the primary speechwriter for and an ardent supporter of Governor Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois. In the 1956 election, Schlesinger, along with 30-year-old Robert F. Kennedy, again worked on Stevenson&#x27;s campaign staff. Schlesinger supported the nomination of Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy as Stevenson&#x27;s vice-presidential running mate, but at the Democratic National Convention, Kennedy came second in the vice-presidential balloting, losing to Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee.

Schlesinger had known John F. Kennedy since attending Harvard and increasingly socialized with Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline in the 1950s. In 1954, &quot;The Boston Post&quot; publisher John Fox Jr. planned a series of newspaper pieces labeling several Harvard figures, including Schlesinger, as &quot;reds&quot;; Kennedy intervened in Schlesinger&#x27;s behalf, which Schlesinger recounted in &quot;A Thousand Days&quot;.

During the 1960 campaign, Schlesinger supported Kennedy, causing consternation to Stevenson loyalists. Kennedy campaigned actively but Stevenson refused to run unless he was drafted at the convention. After Kennedy won the nomination, Schlesinger helped the campaign as a sometime speechwriter, speaker, and member of the ADA. He also wrote the book &quot;Kennedy or Nixon: Does It Make Any Difference?&quot; in which he lauded Kennedy&#x27;s abilities and scorned Vice President Richard M. Nixon as having &quot;no ideas, only methods... He cares about winning.&quot;

==Kennedy administration==
After the election, the president-elect offered Schlesinger an ambassadorship and Assistant Secretary of State for Cultural Relations before Robert Kennedy proposed that Schlesinger serve as a &quot;sort of roving reporter and troubleshooter.&quot; Schlesinger quickly accepted, and on January 30, 1961, he resigned from Harvard and was appointed Special Assistant to the President. He worked primarily on Latin American affairs and as a speechwriter during his tenure in the White House.
In February 1961, Schlesinger was first told of the &quot;Cuba operation,&quot; which would eventually become the Bay of Pigs Invasion. He opposed the plan in a memorandum to the president: &quot;at one stroke you would dissipate all the extraordinary good will which has been rising toward the new Administration through the world. It would fix a malevolent image of the new Administration in the minds of millions.&quot; He, however, suggested:

During the Cabinet deliberations, he &quot;shrank into a chair at the far end of the table and listened in silence&quot; as the Joint Chiefs and CIA representatives lobbied the president for an invasion. Along with his friend, Senator William Fulbright, Schlesinger sent several memos to the president opposing the strike; however, during the meetings, he held back his opinion, reluctant to undermine the President&#x27;s desire for a unanimous decision. Following the overt failure of the invasion, Schlesinger later lamented, &quot;In the months after the Bay of Pigs, I bitterly reproached myself for having kept so silent during those crucial discussions in the cabinet room. ... I can only explain my failure to do more than raise a few timid questions by reporting that one&#x27;s impulse to blow the whistle on this nonsense was simply undone by the circumstances of the discussion.&quot; After the furor died down, Kennedy joked that Schlesinger &quot;wrote me a memorandum that will look pretty good when he gets around to writing his book on my administration. Only he better not publish that memorandum while I&#x27;m still alive!&quot; During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Schlesinger was not a member of the executive committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM) but helped UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson draft his presentation of the crisis to the UN Security Council.

In October 1962, Schlesinger became afraid of &quot;a tremendous advantage&quot;, which &quot;all-out Soviet commitment to cybernetics&quot; would provide the Soviets. Schlesinger further warned that &quot;by 1970 the USSR may have a radically new production technology, involving total enterprises or complexes of industries, managed by closed-loop, feedback control employing self-teaching computers&quot;. The cause was a pre-vision of an algorithmic governance of economy by an internet-like computer network authored by Soviet scientists, particularly Alexander Kharkevich.

After President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Schlesinger resigned his position in January 1964. He wrote a memoir/history of the Kennedy administration, &quot;A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House&quot;, which won him his second Pulitzer Prize in 1966.

==Later career==

Schlesinger returned to teaching in 1966 as the Albert Schweitzer Professor of the Humanities at the CUNY Graduate Center. After his retirement from teaching in 1994, he remained an active member of the Graduate Center community as an emeritus professor until his death.

Schlesinger was a very good friend of Katharine Graham, publisher at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and when she passed away in 2001, he gave one of the eulogies at her funeral at Washington National Cathedral.

==Later politics==
After his service for the Kennedy administration, he continued to be a Kennedy loyalist for the rest of his life, campaigning for Robert Kennedy&#x27;s tragic presidential campaign in 1968 and for Senator Edward M. Kennedy in 1980. At the request of Robert Kennedy&#x27;s widow, Ethel Kennedy, he wrote the biography &quot;Robert Kennedy and His Times&quot;, which was published in 1978.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, he criticized Richard Nixon as a candidate and as president. His prominent status as a liberal Democrat and outspoken disdain of Nixon led to his placement on the master list of Nixon&#x27;s political opponents. Ironically, Nixon would become his next-door neighbor in the years following the Watergate scandal.

After retiring from teaching, he remained involved in politics through his books and public speaking tours. Schlesinger was a critic of the Clinton Administration, resisting President Clinton&#x27;s cooptation of his &quot;Vital Center&quot; concept in an article for &quot;Slate&quot; in 1997. Schlesinger was also a critic of the 2003 Iraq War, calling it a misadventure. He blamed the media for not covering a reasoned case against the war.

==Personal life==
Schlesinger&#x27;s name at birth was Arthur Bancroft Schlesinger; since his mid-teens, he had instead used the signature &quot;Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.&quot; He had five children, four from his first marriage to author and artist Marian Cannon Schlesinger and a son and stepson from his second marriage to Alexandra Emmet, also an artist:

==Death==
On February 28, 2007, Schlesinger had a heart attack while dining with family at a steakhouse in Manhattan. He was taken to New York Downtown Hospital, where he died at the age of 89. His &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary described him as a &quot;historian of power.&quot; He is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Works==
He won a Pulitzer Prize for History in 1946 for his book &quot;The Age of Jackson&quot;, covering the intellectual environment of Jacksonian democracy.

His 1949 book &quot;The Vital Center&quot; made a case for the New Deal policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and was harshly critical of both unregulated capitalism and of those liberals such as Henry A. Wallace who advocated coexistence with communism.

In his book &quot;The Politics of Hope&quot; (1962), Schlesinger terms conservatives the &quot;party of the past&quot; and liberals &quot;the party of hope&quot; and calls for overcoming the division between both parties.

He won a second Pulitzer in the Biography category in 1966 for &quot;A Thousand Days&quot;.

His 1986 book &quot;The Cycles of American History,&quot; a collection of essays and articles, contains &quot;The Cycles of American Politics,&quot; an early work on the topic; it was influenced by his father&#x27;s work on cycles.

He became a leading opponent of multiculturalism in the 1980s and articulated this stance in his book &quot;The Disuniting of America&quot; (1991).

Published posthumously in 2007, &quot;Journals 1952–2000&quot; is the 894-page distillation of 6,000 pages of Schlesinger diaries on a wide variety of subjects, edited by Andrew and Stephen Schlesinger.

<doc id="1013901" wikidata="Q1758811" url="?curid=1013901" title="The Plot Against America">
<text>The Plot Against America is a novel by Philip Roth published in 2004. It is an alternative history in which Franklin D. Roosevelt is defeated in the presidential election of 1940 by Charles Lindbergh. The novel follows the fortunes of the Roth family during the Lindbergh presidency, as antisemitism becomes more acceptable in American life and Jewish-American families like the Roths are persecuted on various levels. The narrator and central character in the novel is the young Philip, and the novel follows his coming of age, as well as American politics. 

Roth based his novel on the isolationist ideas espoused by Lindbergh in real life as a spokesman for the America First Committee, and on his own experiences growing up in Newark, New Jersey. The novel received praise for the realism of its world and its treatment of topics such as antisemitism, trauma, and the perception of history. The novel depicts the Weequahic section of Newark which includes Weequahic High School from which Roth graduated. A miniseries adaptation of the novel aired on HBO in March 2020.

==Plot==
The novel is told from the point of view of Roth as a child growing up in Newark, New Jersey, as the younger son of Herman and Bess Roth. It begins with aviation hero Charles Lindbergh, who is already criticized for his praise of Hitler&#x27;s government, joining the America First Party. As the party&#x27;s spokesman, he speaks out against US intervention in World War II and openly criticizes the &quot;Jewish race&quot; for trying to force US involvement. After making a surprise appearance on the last night of the 1940 Republican National Convention, he is nominated as the Republican Party&#x27;s candidate for president.

Although criticized from the left and feared by most Jewish Americans, Lindbergh musters a strong tide of popular support from the South and the Midwest and is endorsed by Conservative rabbi Lionel Bengelsdorf of Newark. Lindbergh wins the 1940 election over incumbent president Franklin Roosevelt in a landslide under the slogan &quot;Vote for Lindbergh, or vote for war.&quot; Montana senator Burton K. Wheeler is Lindbergh&#x27;s vice president, and Lindbergh nominates Henry Ford as Secretary of the Interior. With Lindbergh in the White House, the Roth family begins to feel like outsiders in American society.

Lindbergh&#x27;s first act is to sign a treaty with Nazi Germany that promises that the United States will not interfere with German expansion in Europe, known as the &quot;Iceland Understanding,&quot; and another with Imperial Japan that promises noninterference with Japanese expansion in Asia, known as the &quot;Hawaii Understanding.&quot;

The new presidency begins to take a toll on Philip&#x27;s family. Philip&#x27;s cousin Alvin joins the Canadian Army to fight in Europe. Alvin loses his leg in combat and returns home with his ideals destroyed. He leaves the family and becomes a racketeer in Philadelphia. A new government program, the Office of American Absorption (OAA), begins to take Jewish boys to spend a period of time living with exchange families in the South and Midwest to &quot;Americanize&quot; them. Philip&#x27;s older brother Sandy is one of the boys selected, and after spending time on a farm in Kentucky under the OAA&#x27;s &quot;Just Folks&quot; program, he comes home showing contempt for his family, calling them &quot;ghetto Jews.&quot;

Philip&#x27;s aunt, Evelyn Finkel, marries Rabbi Bengelsdorf and becomes a frequent guest of the Lindbergh White House. Her attendance of a state dinner party for German Foreign Minister Joachim Von Ribbentrop causes further strain in the family. A new version of the Homestead Act of 1862, called Homestead 42, is instituted to relocate entire Jewish families to the Western and Southern United States by mandating companies to relocate positions to those regions. Many of Philip&#x27;s Newark neighbors move to Canada. Philip visits Evelyn, a senior OAA administrator, in order to try and prevent his family from having to leave Newark, but this results in Philip&#x27;s shy and innocent school friend, Seldon Wishnow, an only child, and his widowed mother, Selma, being moved to tiny Danville, Kentucky. Herman quits his job selling insurance and starts working for his brother in order for his family to avoid relocation.

In protest against the new act, the radio personality Walter Winchell openly criticizes the Lindbergh administration on his nationwide Sunday night broadcast from New York. He is fired by his sponsor. Winchell then decides to run for president in 1942 and begins a speaking tour. His candidacy causes anger and anti-Semitic rioting in the South and the Midwest. Mobs begin targeting him. While addressing an open-air political rally in Louisville, Kentucky, on October 5, 1942, Winchell is assassinated. His funeral in New York City is presided over by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who praises Winchell for his opposition to fascism and pointedly criticizes Lindbergh for his silence over the riots and Winchell&#x27;s assassination.

As President Lindbergh is returning from delivering a speech in Louisville on October 7, 1942, his plane goes missing. Ground searches produce no results, and Vice President Wheeler assumes the presidency. German State Radio discloses &quot;evidence&quot; that Lindbergh&#x27;s disappearance and the kidnapping of his son were part of a Jewish conspiracy to take control of the US government. The announcement incites further anti-Semitic rioting. Wheeler and Ford, acting on the Nazis&#x27; evidence, begin arresting prominent Jewish citizens, including Henry Morgenthau Jr., Herbert Lehman, and Bernard Baruch as well as Mayor La Guardia and Rabbi Bengelsdorf.

Seldon calls the Roths when his mother does not come home from work. They later discover that Seldon&#x27;s mother was killed by Ku Klux Klan members who beat and robbed her before setting fire to her car with her in it. The Roths eventually call Sandy&#x27;s exchange family in Kentucky and have them keep Seldon safe until Philip&#x27;s father and brother retrieve him. Months later, Seldon is taken in by his mother&#x27;s sister. The rioting stops when First Lady Anne Morrow Lindbergh makes a statement that asks for the country to stop the violence and move forward. With the end of the search for President Lindbergh, former president Roosevelt runs as an emergency bipartisan presidential candidate in November 1942 and is re-elected. Months later, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, and the US enters the war.

Aunt Evelyn recounts a theory of Lindbergh&#x27;s disappearance, the source for which is First Lady Lindbergh, who disclosed the details to Evelyn&#x27;s husband, Rabbi Bengelsdorf, shortly before she was forcibly removed from the White House and held prisoner in the psychiatric ward at Walter Reed Army Hospital. According to Evelyn, after the Lindberghs&#x27; son, Charles, was kidnapped in 1932, his murder was faked, and he was then raised in Germany by the Nazis as a Hitler Youth member. The Nazis&#x27; price for the boy&#x27;s life was Lindbergh&#x27;s full co-operation with a Nazi-organized presidential campaign by which they hoped to bring the Final Solution to the US. When Lindbergh informed them that the US would never permit such a thing, he was kidnapped, and the Jewish conspiracy theory was put forward in hopes of turning the US further against its Jewish population. Philip admits that Evelyn&#x27;s theory is the most far-fetched and &quot;unbelievable&quot; explanation for Lindbergh&#x27;s disappearance, but “not necessarily the least convincing.”

==Inspiration==
Roth got the idea for the novel while reading Arthur Schlesinger Jr.&#x27;s memoir, which comments that in 1940 some Republican senators wanted Lindbergh to run against Roosevelt. The real-life Lindbergh&#x27;s 1941 Des Moines speech—in which he accused American Jews of manipulating the news media and government to make the country join World War II—appears reprinted in the novel&#x27;s postscript.

The novel depicts an antisemitic United States in the 1940s. Roth had written in his autobiography, &quot;The Facts&quot;, of the racial and antisemitic tensions that were a part of his childhood in Newark. Several times in that book, he describes children in his neighborhood being violently attacked simply because they were Jewish.

==Reception==
Roth&#x27;s novel was generally well received. On Metacritic, the book received a 80 out of 100 based on 33 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. According to Book Marks, the book received a &quot;positive&quot; consensus, based on fifteen critics: nine &quot;rave&quot;, two &quot;positive&quot;, three &quot;mixed&quot;, and one &quot;pan&quot;. In the November/December 2004 issue of &quot;Bookmarks&quot;, the book was scored four out of five. The magazine&#x27;s critical summary reads: &quot;In the end, &quot;Plot Against America&quot; is an &quot;epic, unforeseen and unexpected&quot; (&quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;)—just like history&quot;. Globally, Complete Review saying on the consensus &quot;Many very, very impressed, but not quite a consensus -- and many disappointed by the historical resolution Roth chooses&quot;.

Jonathan Yardley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, exploring the book&#x27;s treatment of Lindbergh in some depth, calls the book &quot;painfully moving&quot; and a &quot;genuinely American story.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; review described the book as &quot;a terrific political novel&quot; as well as &quot;sinister, vivid, dreamlike, preposterous and, at the same time, creepily plausible.&quot;

Blake Morrison in &quot;The Guardian&quot; offered high praise: &quot;&quot;The Plot Against America&quot; creates its reality magisterially, in long, fluid sentences that carry you beyond skepticism and with a quotidian attentiveness to sights and sounds, tastes and smells, surnames and nicknames and brandnames—an accumulation of &quot;petits faits vrais&quot;—that dissolves any residual disbelief.&quot;

Writer Bill Kauffman, in &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, wrote a scathing review of the book and objected to its criticism of the movement of which Lindbergh was a chief spokesperson, which is sometimes referred to as isolationist but Kauffman sees as antiwar, in contrast to Roosevelt&#x27;s pro-war stance. He also criticizes its portrayal of increasing American antisemitism, in particular among Catholics, and for the nature of its fictional portrayals of real-life characters like Lindbergh, claiming it was &quot;bigoted and libellous of the dead,&quot; as well as for its ending, featuring a resolution to the political situation that Kauffman considered a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;.

The book was also reviewed for &quot;The Economist&quot;. The reviewer wrote that the novel explores what happens to one (Jewish) family when America gradually rescinds its welcome to immigrants and minorities such as the Jews. He critically noted that &quot;the book&#x27;s historical aspects can seem thin and preposterous&quot; but praised it for its &quot;the description of how history can encroach upon an ordinary family, and how simple survival becomes an instance of heroism&quot;.

Many took the novel as something of a &quot;roman à clef&quot; for or against the George W. Bush administration and its policies, but though Roth was opposed to the Bush administration&#x27;s policies, he denied such allegorical interpretations of his novel.

In 2005, the novel won the James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Best Historical Fiction given by the Society of American Historians. It won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History, was a finalist for the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, and came in 11th for the 2005 Locus Awards. In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it at no. 12 on their list of the 100 best books of the 21st century. In 2024, it was ranked #65 in the &quot;New York Times&quot; list of best 100 novels of the 21st century.

== Analysis ==

=== Antisemitism ===
The similarities between modern anti-Zionism in western countries and the antisemitic policy decisions of the 20th-century Lindbergh government in the novel are highlighted by Jewish writer Mike Berger. Berger discusses how in both situations, the targeting and ostracization of the Jewish population is masked in government and high society by making the criticism of Jewish people appear reasonable in focusing on their isolation and failure to assimilate with the majority white culture. From this implicit condoning of prejudice against Jewish communities, many antisemitic individuals and groups become emboldened to carry out acts of violence and discriminate against Jews, as seen in the novel.

English Professor T. Austin Graham argues that the gradual escalation of antisemitic government policy carries a lingering, dreadful possibility of full-scale holocaust across the novel. He argues that the novel also shows how many Jewish families like the Roths are also severely affected by the major shift in the “collective American psyche” that leads to wide-scale rioting akin to the events of Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany.

=== Identity ===
Mike Berger asserts that Roth captures the “essence” of Jewish identity in the novel with lines that describe the characters’ identities as being “as fundamental as having arteries and veins,&quot; contributing to an understanding of a “deep” identity as being the total merging of the individual and the collective.

=== Trauma ===
The issue of trauma on a personal and group level is an important theme of the novel, which professor Aimee Pozorski believes is demonstrated by Roth&#x27;s use of skewed time—“a kind of traumatic time that conflates the present moment with an unassimilated past”—to create the sense that the novel is a relived experience of a past trauma that may be able to offer new insights on the experience. Pozorski states that the novel juxtaposes America&#x27;s founding with the reality of its founding principles being torn apart to tell a reimagined Holocaust narrative.

The novel&#x27;s use of a child character as the principal point of view and the filtering of the novel&#x27;s horrific events through the child&#x27;s lens also highlights how future generations are more heavily impacted by traumatic events. Such an impact could dramatically reshape personal and cultural identities.

=== Historiography ===
Professor Jason Siegel claims that Roth wrote &quot;The Plot Against America&quot; in order to challenge the linear perception of history. Rather than a single, objectively told narrative where every event serves a purpose, Roth proposes that historiography is characterized by the competition between conflicting “plots” and narratives aiming to forward agendas that suit the interests of those dealing with unresolved conflict in the present. He does this by depicting how the battle between two alleged plots—the Jewish and fascist plots to take over the United States—shapes the course of the nation&#x27;s future and impacts the perspective and experience of different social groups in different ways. Roth redefines historical truth as the multiplicity of experiences and narratives of all people, and cautions that American history “remains perpetually unwritten and myriad.&quot;

=== Parallels to the 2016 Presidential election ===
After the 2016 election of Donald Trump to the US presidency, reviewers noted the presence in &quot;The Plot Against America&quot; of a character who bears a resemblance to Trump. The cousin, Alvin, goes to work for a Jewish real-estate developer whose description closely matches Trump. Roth was interviewed in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; about similarities between his novel and the election of Trump. Roth responded, &quot;It is easier to comprehend the election of an imaginary President like Charles Lindbergh than an actual President like Donald Trump. Lindbergh, despite his Nazi sympathies and racist proclivities, was a great aviation hero ... Trump is just a con artist.&quot;

==Historical figures==
&quot;The Plot Against America&quot; depicts or mentions many historical figures:
* Fiorello H. La Guardia: The mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. In the novel, La Guardia gives a speech to the people of New York during the funeral of Walter Winchell in which he denounces the administration&#x27;s silence on the epidemic of antisemitic rioting and warns against the rise of fascism in the United States by proclaiming &quot;it is happening here!&quot; He is later arrested for allegedly being a part of the conspiracy to assassinate President Lindbergh and is released when the Wheeler Administration backs down.
* Charles A. Lindbergh: A famous American aviator who at the last minute wins the Republican Party nomination and defeats Franklin D. Roosevelt to become the 33rd president of the United States. His anti-war platform and antisemitic views lead to the signing of peace agreements with the Axis powers and the increasing marginalization of Jewish Americans. Historically, Lindbergh was an outspoken leader of the America First committee of isolationists and accused Roosevelt and American Jews of being agitators for war. He also made frequent trips to Nazi Germany and was criticized in American media for his antisemitic remarks and his praise of the Nazi regime, including his description of Adolf Hitler as “the world’s greatest safeguard against the spread of communism and its evils.&quot;
* Anne Morrow Lindbergh: The wife of Charles Lindbergh who in the novel brings an end to the civil unrest and political crackdown brought about by her husband&#x27;s disappearance with an appeal to her countrymen via radio address. The real-world kidnapping and murder of her three-year-old son is the subject of several conspiracies in the plot of the novel, with several characters accusing either the Jews or the Nazis of being behind the crime.
* Franklin D. Roosevelt: The 32nd president of the United States, Roosevelt loses reelection in 1940 to Charles Lindbergh instead of winning against Wendell Willkie as he did in real history. Lindbergh and Roosevelt did hold some animosity for each other in real life, with the president likening the aviator to the “Copperheads” that opposed the Union&#x27;s military intervention in the secession crisis during the Civil War and barring him from joining the Army Air Force after Pearl Harbor. The novel ends with Roosevelt winning an emergency election for president and restoring history to its real course by entering into World War II on the side of the Allies after the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor.
* Burton K. Wheeler: A Democratic senator who becomes Lindbergh&#x27;s running mate and is elected Vice President of the United States. When Lindbergh disappears in the novel, Wheeler&#x27;s administration propagates a conspiracy theory blaming the Jewish community for the disappearance of Lindbergh and the kidnapping of his son several years prior and begins arresting prominent Jewish figures and members of the opposition. The historical Wheeler was a staunch isolationist and supporter of the America First Committee, who was accused of antisemitism in a political pamphlet also entitled &quot;The Plot Against America&quot;. The veracity of these accusations are disputed by historians.
* Walter Winchell: A famous Jewish gossip columnist and radio broadcaster from New York City who, in the novel and in real life, was a fierce critic of Charles Lindbergh. His candidacy for the 1944 presidential election against President Lindbergh is cut short when he is assassinated at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky, exacerbating riots and antisemitic violence across the nation.

==Television adaptation==

On January 18, 2018, it was reported that &quot;The Wire&quot; creator David Simon would adapt a six-part mini-series adaptation of &quot;The Plot Against America&quot;. The news was first announced in &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist Charles McGrath&#x27;s interview with Roth, who noted that Simon had visited Roth, who stated he &quot;was sure his novel was in good hands.&quot; Filming took place in Jersey City, New Jersey. It premiered on HBO on March 16, 2020.

<doc id="1013907" wikidata="Q321240" url="?curid=1013907" title="Walhalla (memorial)">
<text>The Walhalla () is a hall of fame monument that honours laudable and distinguished people in German history&quot;politicians, sovereigns, scientists and artists of the German tongue&quot;; thus the celebrities honoured are drawn from Greater Germany, a wider area than today&#x27;s Germany, and even as far away as Britain in the case of several Anglo-Saxon figures. The hall is a neo-classical building above the Danube River, in Donaustauf, east of Regensburg in Bavaria, the exterior modelled on the Parthenon in Athens.

The Walhalla memorial is named for the &quot;Valhǫll&quot; of Norse Paganism. It was conceived in 1807 by Crown Prince Ludwig I of Bavaria in order to support the gathering momentum for the unification of the many German states into the German Empire. Following his accession to the throne of Bavaria, construction took place between 1830 and 1842 under the supervision of the architect Leo von Klenze. The memorial displays some 65 plaques and 130 busts covering 2,000 years of history, beginning with Arminius, victor at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in the year 9 AD.

The entire system including the substructure is 125 meters long and 55 meters high, the shape of complex is a Greek temple in the style of a Doric Peripteros. The roof is supported by an iron structure that was ultra-modern for the time. The length of the classicist temple building is 66.7 meters, the width is 31.6 meters, and the height is 20 meters. The fully sculptural gable field on the north side, designed by Christian Daniel Rauch and executed by Ludwig von Schwanthaler, shows on the left the Germanic tribes under Arminius in the battle in the Teutoburg Forest against the Romans attacking from the west right. The southern gable represents Germany&#x27;s liberation in 1814, in the middle Germania, from the left and right the German states and federal fortresses approach in homage, in the spandrel the border rivers Rhine and Moselle are symbolized. Inside, the Walhalla is 48.5 meters long, 14 meters wide and 15.5 meters high. The surrounding frieze by Martin von Wagner depicts the early history of the Germanic peoples, their departure from the Caucasus and their immigration into Central Europe. The final stage is the conversion to the Christian faith by Saint Boniface. In addition to its decorative function, the history frieze also serves as a visual separation between the lower bust zone and the upper panel zone. There are also twelve marble armchairs in the interior, which were created by the sculptor Ernst Mayer, and eight marble candlesticks.

==History==

By 1806 Napoleon&#x27;s First French Empire had annexed German lands along the Rhine River and the North Sea. Central German states formed the Confederation of the Rhine, which sided with Napoleon. Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, then formally dissolved the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (6 August 1806) and instead styled himself Emperor of Austria. The War of the Fourth Coalition (1806–1807) pitted German forces on both sides against each other, and Napoleon again prevailed.

In 1807, 20-year-old Crown Prince Ludwig of the Kingdom of Bavaria (newly elevated from Electorate to Kingdom by Napoleon in 1806), had the idea of reminding all Germans of their common heritage – of the great figures and events in ethnic German history. He commissioned several sculptors to create busts of famous individuals of his choice. Johann Gottfried Schadow&#x27;s bust of Nicolaus Copernicus became one of the first completed, in 1807. Further suggestions for individuals to be honoured were solicited in 1808 from Swiss historian Johannes von Müller.

By the time of Crown Prince Ludwig&#x27;s coronation as King Ludwig I of Bavaria in 1825, 60 busts had been completed. In 1826 Ludwig commissioned the construction of a memorial above the Danube River, near Regensburg, modelled after the Parthenon in Athens. The southern pediment frieze features the 1815 creation of the German Confederation; the northern pediment frieze features scenes from the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest of 9 AD. According to &quot;Pictorial Travels Continentally Described&quot; (circa 1892), the construction of the building cost £666,666.

A two thaler coin was minted commemorating the opening of the Walhalla, Krause catalog number KM# 811. It is moderately scarce.

At Walhalla&#x27;s inauguration on October 18, 1842, there were 96 busts, plus 64 plaques for persons or events of which no portrait was available on which to model a sculpture. When the memorial was opened in 1842, Guido von Lessner authored a poem about Germany&#x27;s greatness which was set to music by Joseph Hartmann Stuntz.

Since being &quot;of the German tongue&quot; was the main selection criterion for the original 160 persons representing the 1,800 years of German history, the king included individuals of the wider Germanic sphere, including ancient Germanic notables as well as people from the Holy Roman Empire. Whereas the Valhalla of Norse mythology served as home to those gloriously slain in battle, Ludwig intended his Walhalla not only for warriors but also for scientists, writers, and clerics, and specifically included both men and women. Decades before the foundation of the modern German state in 1871 or the clear formation of a modern German identity, &quot;German&quot; was initially understood as &quot;Germanic&quot; and included all ancient Germanic peoples as well as medieval Dutch, Swedish, Russian, and modern Austrian and Swiss figures.

Leo von Klenze&#x27;s plans reveal the purpose of the subterranean level set within the foundation, the entrance to which is visible from the Danube River. The Central Aisle leads to the Hall of Expectations (Halle der Erwartungen), which was meant to house busts of individuals considered worthy of joining Walhalla, but who were still living at the time of their busts&#x27; creation. These busts would be ceremoniously carried into Walhalla following the deaths of the subjects. The Hall of Expectations was abandoned owing to changes in criteria for induction into Walhalla.

The first addition to the collection was the bust of Martin Luther. Ludwig, a devout Catholic, had hesitated to include Luther. Several of the sculptors, including Ohnmacht and Schadow, had urged the king to include Luther, as did Johannes von Müller. Ludwig finally commissioned Luther&#x27;s bust in 1831 from Ernst Friedrich Rietschel. It was not included at the inauguration of Walhalla in 1842, but added in 1848 by Ludwig himself. Luther&#x27;s bust was placed just after the last of the original busts (Goethe&#x27;s), disregarding the chronological arrangement by year of death.

Four further additions were made during Ludwig&#x27;s lifetime: 
Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen (died 1847, added 1853),
Josef Wenzel Graf Radetzky von Radetz (died 1858, added in the same year),
Friedrich Schelling (died 1854, added 1860)
and Ludwig van Beethoven (added 1866).

In 1853, King Ludwig I established an additional &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; in Munich, specifically for Bavarians – the Ruhmeshalle. Nine of the Bavarian enshrinees have since become Walhalla enshrinees. Their busts in the Ruhmeshalle were destroyed in 1944, during a bombing raid, and have not been replaced. Instead, a plaque with their names tells of their transfer to Walhalla. King Ludwig I himself, who commissioned the &quot;Liberation
Hall&quot; and other monuments, was also enshrined both at Walhalla and in the Ruhmeshalle.

Helmuth von Moltke the Elder was the last addition of a military leader (in 1910). After World War I, new additions focussed on artists and intellectuals. Beginning in 1933, when &quot;Kraft durch Freude&quot; and other National Socialist organizations promoted trips to &quot;Walhalla&quot;, visitor numbers increased exponentially. In 1937, when Hitler unveiled a Bruckner bust, 131,520 were counted. The Walhalla memorial was reached by the Allied invasion of Germany in April 1945.

Additions since 1945 are proposed by private individuals or private foundations, who will also pay for the production of the new bust. Suggestions are reviewed by the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, based on which a recommendation is made by the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior. The final decision lies with the Bavarian Council of Ministers. Official practice since 1945 has been to favour &quot;eminent figures from science or art, or individuals with extraordinary social or caritative merit&quot;.

Nineteen busts have been added between 1945 and 2022, for an average interval of a little below four years between additions:
*Max Reger (1948)
*Adalbert Stifter (1954)
*Joseph von Eichendorff (1957)
*Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen (1959)
*Max von Pettenkofer (1962)

*Carl Friedrich Gauss (2007)
*Edith Stein (2009)

=== Plaques ===

Plaques were made for people (or acts) of which no portraits or descriptions were available to model sculptures after. The timeline spans from Arminius a.k.a. Hermann der Cherusker (born 17 BC) to watchmaker Peter Henlein, who died in 1542. In 2003 a plaque was added to commemorate the German Resistance against Nazi Germany.

Plaque numbers 1–32 represent the upper row, 33–64 the lower row.
Each plaque includes a short characterization of the individual, with the year of death given in Roman numerals.
The year of death in the table below is that given on the plaque, even where modern historiography suggests a revised date.

The 65th plaque, dedicated to the &quot;Widerstand&quot; (Resistance) against Nazi Germany, added in 2003, is not part of the two rows of 64 numbered plaques.

<doc id="1013923" wikidata="Q1047519" url="?curid=1013923" title="Datum reference">
<text>A datum reference or just datum (plural: datums) is some geometrically important part of an object—such as a point, line, plane, hole, set of holes, or pair of surfaces—that serves as a reference in defining the geometry of the object and (often) in measuring aspects of the actual geometry to assess how closely they match with the nominal value, which may be an ideal, standard, average, or desired value.

For example, on a car&#x27;s wheel, the lug nut holes define a that is a datum from which the location of the rim can be defined and measured. This matters because the hub and rim need to be concentric to within close limits (or else the wheel will not roll smoothly).

The concept of datums is used in many fields, including carpentry, metalworking, needlework, geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T), aviation, surveying, geodesy (geodetic datums), and others. 

==Uses==
In carpentry, an alternative, more common name is &quot;face side&quot; and &quot;face edge&quot;. The artisan nominates two straight edges on a workpiece as the &quot;datum edges&quot;, and they are marked accordingly. One convention is to mark the first datum edge with a single slanted line (/) and the second with double lines (//). For most work, the datum references of the workpiece need to be square. If necessary they may be cut, planed or filed to make them so. In subsequent marking out, all measurements are then taken from either of the two datum references.

In aviation, an aircraft is designed to operate within a specified range of mass and (chiefly longitudinal) balance; an airman is responsible for determining these factors for each flight under their command. This requires the calculation of moment for each variable mass in the aircraft (fuel, passengers, cargo, etc.), by multiplying its weight by its distance from a datum reference. The datum for light airplanes is usually the engine firewall or the tip of the spinner, but in all cases it is a fixed plane perpendicular to the aircraft&#x27;s longitudinal axis, and specified in its operating handbook.

==Engineering== 
An engineering datum used in geometric dimensioning and tolerancing is a feature on an object used to create a reference system for measurement.
In engineering and drafting, a &quot;datum&quot; is a reference point, surface, or axis on an object against which measurements are made.

These are then referred to by one or more &#x27;datum references&#x27; which indicate measurements that should be made with respect to the corresponding datum feature .

In geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, datum reference frames are typically 3D. Datum reference frames are used as part of the feature control frame to show where the measurement is taken from. A typical datum reference frame is made up of three planes. For example, the three planes could be one &quot;face side&quot; and two &quot;datum edges&quot;. These three planes are marked A, B and C, where A is the face side, B is the first datum edge, and C is the second datum edge. In this case, the datum reference frame is A/B/C. A/B/C is shown at the end of feature control frame to show from where the measurement is taken. (See the ASME standard Y14.5M-2009 for more examples and material modifiers.)

The engineer selects A/B/C based on the dimensional function of the part. The datums should be functional per the ASME standard. Typically, a part is required to fit with other parts. So, the functional datums are chosen based on how the part attaches. However, typically, the functional datums are not used to manufacture the part. The manufacturing datums are typically different from the functional datums to save cost, improve process speed, and repeatability. A tolerance analysis may be needed in many cases to convert between the functional datums and the manufacturing datums. Computer software can be purchased for dimensional analysis.

There are typically 6 degrees of freedom that need to be considered before choosing which feature is A, B, or C. For this example, A is the primary datum, B is the secondary, and C is the tertiary datum. The primary datum controls the most degrees of freedom. The tertiary datum controls the least degrees of freedom. For this example, of a block of wood, datum A (the face) controls 3 degrees of freedom, B (first edge) controls 2 degrees of freedom, and C (second edge) controls 1 degree of freedom. 3+2+1 = 6, all 6 degrees of freedom are considered.

The 6 degrees of freedom in this example are 3 translation and 3 rotation about the 3D coordinate system. The face datum A controls 3: translation along the z-axis, rotation about the x-axis, and rotation about the y-axis. The edge datum B controls 2: translation along the y-axis and rotation about the z-axis. Finally, The edge datum C controls 1 degree of freedom, namely the translation along the x-axis.

<doc id="1013925" wikidata="Q311970" url="?curid=1013925" title="Brian McFadden">
<text>Brian Nicholas McFadden (born 12 April 1980) is an Irish pop singer and television presenter. He rose to fame in 1998 as a member of the Irish boy band Westlife. Following his departure from the group in 2004, McFadden released his debut solo album, &quot;Irish Son.&quot; He has since released four studio albums: &quot;Set in Stone&quot; (2008), &quot;Wall of Soundz&quot; (2010), &quot;The Irish Connection&quot; (2013), and &quot;Otis&quot; (2019). In 2016 Brian teamed up with Keith Duffy of Boyzone to form Boyzlife and currently have two albums to date &quot;Strings Attached&quot; (2020) and &quot;Old School&quot; (2022)

==Early life==
McFadden was born in Dublin and was raised Catholic. Throughout his younger years, he always had an interest in singing, dancing and football. Along with his sister Susan, McFadden attended the Billie Barry Stage School in Dublin, which led him to doing stage and TV roles, including a role in the Irish TV show &quot;Finbar&#x27;s Class&quot;, a comedy revolving around a group of student-singers. In early 1998, he formed a pop-R&amp;B group with his friends Tim and Darragh, called &quot;Cartel&quot;, and performed live gigs in Dublin pubs. When the band passed their credentials to prominent Irish music manager Louis Walsh, McFadden was asked to come to the audition for the formation of a new band that would later be called Westlife.

==Music career==

===1998–2004: Westlife===

In June 1998, McFadden auditioned for Irish boy band Westlife and was against another blonde Nicky Byrne and eventually both joined the group alongside Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, and Shane Filan. After joining, he changed the spelling of his name from Brian to Bryan to make it easier to sign autographs. With McFadden as part of the group, Westlife were under the music mogul Simon Cowell and released their first single, Swear It Again, which was the group&#x27;s first and only single to have charted in the US in 2000, four Irish No. 1 studio albums, and a No. 1 greatest hits album. They also released seventeen Irish top 5 singles including the hit single &quot;Uptown Girl,&quot; which peaked within the top 10 in seven European countries and also in Australia and New Zealand. In March 2004, McFadden left the group to spend more time with his family and work on solo projects. He subsequently began a solo career and decided to revert the spelling of his first name back to its original, &quot;Brian.&quot; Before launching his solo career, he co-wrote the song &quot;If My World Stopped Turning,&quot; which was sung by Ireland&#x27;s entry Chris Doran in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004.

===2004–2006: Going solo and &quot;Irish Son&quot;===

Following his departure from Westlife, McFadden signed to major record label, Sony BMG. In September 2004, he released his debut solo single &quot;Real to Me,&quot; which became his first solo No. 1 single in Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Norway. His second single and title track, &quot;Irish Son,&quot; peaked within the top 10 on the British and Ireland Singles Charts. Following the release of the two singles, McFadden released his debut solo album, &quot;Irish Son,&quot; in November 2004 and it peaked within the top 10 on the Irish Albums Chart. McFadden co-wrote most of the songs on the album with Guy Chambers, best known for his successful collaboration with Robbie Williams and INXS. The third single &quot;Almost Here,&quot; a duet with Australian singer Delta Goodrem became McFadden&#x27;s second No. 1 single in Ireland as a solo artist and his first in Australia and gained a platinum accreditation there. The fourth and final single, &quot;Demons&quot; peaked within the top 30 on the charts in Ireland and Britain. McFadden continued writing songs for artists such as Il Divo and Girls Aloud, as well as co-writing the theme song &quot;Together We Are One&quot; for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. That same year, McFadden collaborated with American singer LeAnn Rimes on the song, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Someone.&quot;

===2007–2010: Label change, &quot;Set in Stone&quot; and &quot;Wall of Soundz&quot; ===

While working on the second album, McFadden&#x27;s record label, Sony BMG insisted that he work with an artists &amp; repertoire (A&amp;R) man, after disappointing sales of his last album, which only sold 800,000 copies worldwide. However, there were claims that McFadden&#x27;s A&amp;R man did not want McFadden to work with Guy Chambers, who had previously worked with McFadden on his last album and fought about his songs and musical direction. His A&amp;R man wanted him to make songs like James Morrison, Paolo Nutini, and the Scissor Sisters but McFadden insisted he make songs that are of his style. It was later revealed in March 2007 that McFadden parted ways with Sony BMG. Later that year, he set up his own record label under the name of BMF Records and released his new single &quot;Like Only a Woman Can&quot; in Ireland, through the label. &quot;Like Only a Woman Can&quot; became his third Irish No. 1 single as a solo artist. In early 2008, McFadden signed to Universal Music Australia and released the single there in April 2008, which peaked within the ARIA top 15. Following the release of &quot;Like Only a Woman Can,&quot; McFadden released his second studio album, &quot;Set in Stone.&quot; The album peaked in Australia at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Other singles were released from the album: &quot;Twisted,&quot; which peaked within the top 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart and &quot;Everything But You,&quot; which failed to chart the ARIA top 50.

In April 2010, McFadden released &quot;Just Say So,&quot; which features American rapper Kevin Rudolf. The single debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at No. 1 and stayed there for three weeks. It spent seven weeks in the ARIA top ten and thirteen weeks in the ARIA top 50 and gained a platinum accreditation. Following the release of &quot;Just Say So,&quot; McFadden released his third studio album, &quot;Wall of Soundz,&quot; in Australia on 23 April 2010. The album was originally going to be released as a side-project McFadden embarked on with American songwriter Rob Conley but both decided to release it as McFadden&#x27;s third solo album. It debuted at No. 27 on the ARIA Albums Chart and spent only three weeks in the ARIA top 50. &quot;Chemical Rush&quot; was the second single released from the album in June 2010 and peaked at No. 12 on the charts. In September 2010, McFadden released the third single entitled &quot;Mistakes,&quot; a duet with his then fiancée Delta Goodrem. McFadden also recorded a duet with Ronan Keating on Keating&#x27;s duet album, a cover of the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;To Love Somebody.&quot;

===2011–2015: &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; and &quot;The Irish Connection&quot; ===
On 25 February 2011, McFadden released the new single &quot;Just the Way You Are (Drunk at the Bar)&quot;. The song was criticised by some as a glorification of date rape, as a result of which he cancelled the shooting of a proposed pop video for the song, asked that the song not be played on the radio and pledged via his Twitter account to donate all proceeds from the song to rape victims. &quot;Just the Way You Are (Drunk at the Bar)&quot; debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at number sixty-one on 8 March 2011, and peaked at number forty-nine the next week.

In June 2011, McFadden appeared on Australian radio show &quot;The Kyle &amp; Jackie O Show&quot; to launch both of his new singles &quot;Come Party&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s How Life Goes&quot;, which was co-written by singer, songwriter and producer Ray Ruffin. Despite heavy promotion and appearances on TV shows such as &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, the new singles failed to impact the charts at all, which was surprising considering his high-profile appearances on &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. Some of this has been attributed to the negative press surrounding his previous single &quot;Just the Way You Are (Drunk at the Bar)&quot;. This, as well as his much-publicized split with Delta Goodrem, appeared to have had a negative impact on his music career.

McFadden released his new single &quot;Wrap My Arms&quot; on 20 January 2012 in Australia. The song was used in a promo for &quot;Home and Away&quot; and it managed to peak at No. 70 on the ARIA top 100.

On 13 September 2012, McFadden announced the release of his fourth studio album, &quot;The Irish Connection&quot;, featuring covers of his favourite Irish songs as well as duets with Ronan Keating and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor. The album was recorded in both Sydney and Dublin and features none of McFadden&#x27;s past five single releases, which have not appeared in an album format to date.

On 18 September 2012, Ronan Keating announced that McFadden would be joining him on his 2013 UK Fires Tour.

===2016–present: Boyzlife===
Boyzlife is a duo consisting of Keith Duffy and McFadden, who previously appeared as members of &#x27;90s and &#x27;00s boybands Boyzone and Westlife, respectively, hence the name. In 2020, they released their debut album, &quot;Strings Attached&quot;. 

In February 2020, Keith Duffy invited John Junior, Mental Health Activist on stage with McFadden on their Boyzlife tour to share his mental health journey with their fans. Junior travels around the United Kingdom with Charlie the Duck, who accompanies him, encouraging people to speak up about mental health. Duffy is friends with Junior and supports his campaign to raise awareness for mental health. 

On 19 January 2022, the duo announced the release of their second studio album, &quot;Old School&quot;, which charted poorly due to lack of promotion.

==Television and radio career==
In 2008, McFadden took on the role of television presenter as co-host of FOX8&#x27;s &quot;Football Superstar&quot; in Australia. He reprised his role for the second season in 2009. In August 2009, McFadden appeared as a guest judge on &quot;Australian Idol&quot;.

In 2010, McFadden became one of the new judges on &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; replacing Red Symons alongside Kyle Sandilands who replaced Tom Burlinson and Dannii Minogue. He was a judge for three years, but was not asked back for the seventh season. In season 6, McFadden had a controversial dismissal of Owen Campbell, after a small argument where it appeared that McFadden did not understand the outlaw style genre of the contestant and persona he was portraying which may have played a part in his ratings drop which led to him leaving the show.

In late 2008, McFadden teamed up with singer Ricki-Lee Coulter and former &quot;Big Brother&quot; host Mike Goldman to present the &quot;Summer Breakfast Show&quot; on 2Day FM. In September 2009, McFadden returned to radio by co-hosting on the breakfast show on 2dayFM with Jackie O and Andrew G, replacing host Kyle Sandilands for a short period of time.

2013 saw McFadden and his wife at the time Vogue Williams come in second place on ITV dancing show &quot;Stepping Out&quot;, hosted by Davina McCall.

In 2014, McFadden co-hosted the Channel 5 dating game show &quot;Stand By Your Man&quot; alongside former &quot;Freshly Squeezed&quot; co-host Laura Jackson.

In September 2014, McFadden began hosting daytime ITV series &quot;Who&#x27;s Doing the Dishes?&quot; The show returned for a second series in September 2015 and a third in September 2016 making over 90 episodes in total. In January 2015, McFadden took part in celebrity talent show &quot;Get Your Act Together&quot;. In December 2015, McFadden and Vogue Williams took part in a celebrity couples edition of &quot;Catchphrase&quot;.

In 2016, McFadden participated in the third series of &quot;The Jump&quot; on Channel 4. He was the fourth celebrity to be eliminated from the show.

In 2019, McFadden took part in the eleventh series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, alongside professional partner Alex Murphy. He finished in fourth place, after a skate-off with Saara Aalto.

<doc id="1013932" wikidata="Q7233799" url="?curid=1013932" title="Postage stamps and postal history of British Somaliland">
<text>Originally mail from British Somaliland used postage stamps of Egypt, then India. In 1903, about 30 types of stamps of India were overprinted &quot;BRITISH / SOMALILAND&quot;.

== First stamps ==

In 1904 the protectorate issued its own stamps, featuring a profile of King Edward VII, and inscribed &quot;SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE&quot;. Issues of George V used the same design with George&#x27;s profile.

== George VI ==
After George VI ascended the throne, the new series of 12 values used three pictorial designs; a Berbera blackhead sheep, lesser kudu antelope, and a map. The 1938 series included a 3/4 on portrait of the king; in 1942, with the restoration of civil postal service after the Italian occupation, new stamps used a full-face portrait, and the sheep design was re-engraved.

== Change of currency ==
Around 1950 the currency changed from annas and rupees to cents and shillings, and the 1942 stamps were appropriately surcharged. The UPU 75th anniversary issue was printed in cents and shillings, but its issue date was 24 October 1949 (10th Oct. in London), before the changeover, so those stamps had to be surcharged in the old currency.

== Queen Elizabeth II ==

Queen Elizabeth II ushered in a new series featuring a variety of local wildlife and scenes. Some values of these stamps were overprinted in 1957 with &quot;OPENING / OF THE / LEGISLATIVE / COUNCIL / 1957&quot;, and in 1960 with &quot;LEGISLATIVE / COUNCIL / UNOFFICIAL / MAJORITY, / 1960&quot; to mark the events as named by the overprints.

All the stamps of British Somaliland were withdrawn from sale on 25 June 1960 as Somaliland obtained independence. For the week prior to formal unification with Italian Somaliland on 1 July, a set of Italian Somaliland stamps overprinted &quot;Somaliland Independence 26 June 1960&quot; was issued.

<text>Christian Tissier (born 1951 in Paris, France) is one of the best known European aikido teachers, who pioneered the art in France. He started his Aikido training in 1962 as a child in Jean-Claude Tavernier&#x27;s Dojo in Paris, following the style of Hiroo Mochizuki. He soon went on to train under Mutsuro Nakazono and was awarded by him the 2nd dan before leaving for Tokyo in 1969. He came to the Aikikai Hombu Dojo as an 18-year-old, and trained there for seven years. Among the teachers that have inspired him are Seigo Yamaguchi, Kisaburo Osawa and the second doshu Kisshomaru Ueshiba. While living in Tokyo, he also trained in Kenjutsu under Minoru Inaba at the Shiseikan and in Kickboxing at the Mejiro Gym. He also worked as a model and taught French language at a school and Institut Franco-japonais de Tokyo.

He received 7th dan in 1998, and is among the handful of westerners who have been given the title Shihan by the Aikikai.

He is a founding member of the Fédération Française d&#x27;Aïkido Aïkibudo et Affinitaires (FFAAA or 2F3A) which was created in 1983. He is also a member of the technical college (Collège Technique) in charge of the Dan grades examination and of the awarding of teaching certifications: Brevet d&#x27;Etat and Brevet Fédéral. These examinations take place jointly with members of the other federation, the Fédération Française d&#x27;Aïkido et de Budo (FFAB), within the Union des Fédérations d&#x27;Aïkido (UFA).

Christian Tissier also serves the International Aikido Federation as an instructor during congresses and as a technical coordinator and demonstrator during major events such as the World Combat Games.

He was one of the three Shihan (with Tsuruzo Miyamoto and Jiro Kimura) to be awarded the 8th dan by Aikido&#x27;s Doshu Moriteru Ueshiba at the Kagamibiraki Ceremony held on January 11, 2016 at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo.

<doc id="1013941" wikidata="Q3294014" url="?curid=1013941" title="Mark Burchill">
<text>Mark James Burchill (born 18 August 1980) is a Scottish former professional football player and coach. He played for Scottish clubs Celtic, Dundee, Hearts, Dunfermline Athletic, Kilmarnock and Livingston, and in England for Birmingham City, Ipswich Town, Portsmouth, Wigan Athletic, Sheffield Wednesday and Rotherham United. He was capped six times for the Scotland national team.

==Club career==

===Celtic===
Burchill was born in Broxburn and grew up in Livingston, West Lothian, Scotland. He attended St Mary&#x27;s Academy, Bathgate followed by St. Margaret&#x27;s Academy, Livingston, where his footballing ability became apparent. Burchill began his career at Scottish club Celtic for the 1997–98 season. In his first three seasons with the club he scored 20 Scottish Premier League goals in only 17 starts, with 33 appearances as a substitute. This prolific return saw him gain a place in the Scotland national football team, making his debut against Bosnia-Herzegovina in October 1999. While playing for Celtic against Jeunesse Esch of Luxembourg in the qualifying round of the 2000-01 UEFA Cup, Burchill scored the fastest-ever hat-trick in a European club match. However, successive managers failed to see the Scotland international as a part of the first team picture. The signing of £6 million Chris Sutton further pushed Burchill down the pecking order, and in September 2000 he moved to Birmingham City on a three-month loan, making his debut in a 2–0 home win over Tranmere Rovers. Burchill went on to score five goals in 17 games (10 as a substitute) during the spell. Birmingham wanted to complete the deal but were unable to agree personal terms with the player. In February 2001, Burchill chose to go on another three-month loan until the season&#x27;s end at Ipswich Town, scoring once against Bradford City.

===Portsmouth===
During the off-season Burchill was signed by Portsmouth for a £600,000 fee. He showed his potential immediately at his new club. After making his debut against Stockport County he scored twice in his next game, against Grimsby Town. However, a knee injury suffered after less than a month put him out of action for 10 months. He recovered in time to start the 2002–03 season in fantastic form, but under new manager Harry Redknapp he fell down the pecking order and was made available for transfer. He did however contribute 18 appearances and four goals as they won the First Division Championship and promotion to the Premier League. He was loaned out to Dundee from February 2003 to the end of the season, and helped them reach the Scottish Cup Final, in which they lost narrowly to Rangers. During the 2003–04 season he was loaned out to firstly to Wigan Athletic, and then Sheffield Wednesday. However, he failed to score for either club and neither moved to make the deal permanent. Starting the 2004–05 season as fifth-choice striker, Burchill went on loan to Rotherham United, hoping to impress enough to restart his career. However, after only a month, and one goal against Crewe Alexandra, he was injured and returned to Portsmouth, where he was pushed further down the pecking order by the return to fitness of long-term injured striker Vincent Péricard.

===Hearts and Dunfermline Athletic===
On 28 January 2005, Burchill was allowed to leave Portsmouth on a free transfer after spending two years out of favour. He chose to return to Scotland and sign for Hearts, where he remained until the end of the season. On 6 July 2005, he joined Dunfermline Athletic where he scored 12 league goals in 31 games in his first season, despite the club struggling in the bottom half of the table. He signed a year&#x27;s extension to his contract with the Pars in December 2006. In April 2008, Dunfermline manager Jim McIntyre announced that Burchill had been offered a new contract but had decided to leave the Scottish First Division side in order to &quot;pursue other avenues&quot;.

===Rotherham United and Kilmarnock===
On 11 June 2008, Burchill signed a two-year deal with Rotherham United, where he previously enjoyed a loan spell during their Championship campaign. He scored his first goal for the Millers in the 1–1 draw away at Dagenham &amp; Redbridge. However, Burchill left after the 2008–09 season. Kilmarnock manager Jim Jefferies had tried to sign Burchill in 2008 when the player chose to join Rotherham. In July 2009 Burchill joined the Scottish Premier League team in Italy for pre-season training, was reported to be &quot;looking very sharp&quot;, and signed a one-year deal with the club in August. He injured his Achilles tendon in a friendly match against Burnley, an injury which eventually required surgery, and resumed training in mid-October. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw with Hibernian on 12 December 2009.

===Enosis Neon Paralimni and Esan United===
Burchill became a free agent after his contract with Kilmarnock expired. On 1 September 2010 Burchill, having received several offers to move abroad, agreed to sign for Cypriot First Division side Enosis Neon Paralimni.

==International career==
In October 1999, Burchil made his debut for the senior side as 79th minute substitute in European Championship Qualifier against Bosnia And Herzegovina. His first start came later than month in a 3–0 win against Lithuania.

He appeared as a substitute in both matches against England in the playoffs for the 2000 UEFA European Football Championship.

In total he played for Scotland on 6 occasions with his final appearance coming in April 2000 in a friendly against The Netherlands.

==Coaching career==
On 25 March 2013, Burchill was named as a player/assistant manager of his home town club Livingston with Richie Burke to become the manager. However, Burchill was not eligible to play during the end of season 2012–13 due to international clearance not being received on time. He made his competitive debut for Livingston on 27 July 2013 in a Scottish Challenge Cup match against Berwick Rangers.

Burchill was appointed caretaker manager of Livingston in December 2014. As manager he led the club to success in the 2014–15 Scottish Challenge Cup and also saved the side&#x27;s Scottish Championship status on the final day. Midway through the following season, Burchill was sacked with the club sitting second bottom in the Championship.

After his departure from Livingston, he worked as chief scout at AFC Bournemouth. When technical director Richard Hughes moved to Liverpool prior to the 2024–25 season, Burchill followed him to join the club&#x27;s scouting team.

==Personal life==
His father&#x27;s cousin is the Simple Minds musician Charlie Burchill.

Burchill&#x27;s daughter, Tiree Burchill, is a Scottish youth international with caps at U15 and U16 levels; , she was playing for Hamilton Academical, on loan from Celtic.

<text>In discrete geometry and discrepancy theory, the Heilbronn triangle problem is a problem of placing points in the plane, avoiding triangles of small area. It is named after Hans Heilbronn, who conjectured that, no matter how points are placed in a given area, the smallest triangle area will be at most inversely proportional to the square of the number of points. His conjecture was proven false, but the asymptotic growth rate of the minimum triangle area remains unknown.

==Definition==
The Heilbronn triangle problem concerns the placement of formula_1 points within a shape in the plane, such as the unit square or the unit disk, for a given Each triple of points form the three vertices of a triangle, and among these triangles, the problem concerns the smallest triangle, as measured by area. Different placements of points will have different smallest triangles, and the problem asks: how should formula_1 points be placed to maximize the area of the smallest 

More formally, the shape may be assumed to be a compact set formula_3 in the plane, meaning that it stays within a bounded distance from the origin and that points are allowed to be placed on its boundary. In most work on this problem, formula_3 is additionally a convex set of nonzero area. When three of the placed points lie on a line, they are considered as forming a degenerate triangle whose area is defined to be zero, so placements that maximize the smallest triangle will not have collinear triples of points. The assumption that the shape is compact implies that there exists an optimal placement of formula_1 points, rather than only a sequence of placements approaching optimality. The number formula_6 may be defined as the area of the smallest triangle in this optimal An example is shown in the figure, with six points in a unit square. These six points form formula_7 different triangles, four of which are shaded in the figure. Six of these 20 triangles, with two of the shaded shapes, have area 1/8; the remaining 14 triangles have larger areas. This is the optimal placement of six points in a unit square: all other placements form at least one triangle with area 1/8 or smaller. Therefore, 

Although researchers have studied the value of formula_6 for specific shapes and specific small numbers of points, Heilbronn was concerned instead about its asymptotic behavior: if the shape formula_3 is held fixed, but formula_1 varies, how does the area of the smallest triangle vary That is, Heilbronn&#x27;s question concerns the growth rate as a function For any two shapes formula_3 the numbers formula_6 and formula_13 differ only by a constant factor, as any placement of formula_1 points within formula_3 can be scaled by an affine transformation to fit changing the minimum triangle area only by a constant. Therefore, in bounds on the growth rate of formula_6 that omit the constant of proportionality of that growth, the choice of formula_3 is irrelevant and the subscript may be 

==Heilbronn&#x27;s conjecture and its disproof==
Heilbronn conjectured prior to 1951 that the minimum triangle area always shrinks rapidly as a function —more specifically, inversely proportional to the square In terms of big O notation, this can be expressed as the bound
formula_18

In the other direction, Paul Erdős found examples of point sets with minimum triangle area proportional demonstrating that, if true, Heilbronn&#x27;s conjectured bound could not be strengthened. Erdős formulated the no-three-in-line problem, on large sets of grid points with no three in a line, to describe these examples. As Erdős observed, when formula_1 is a prime number, the set of formula_1 points formula_21 on an formula_22 integer grid (for have no three collinear points, and therefore by Pick&#x27;s formula each of the triangles they form has area at When these grid points are scaled to fit within a unit square, their smallest triangle area is proportional matching Heilbronn&#x27;s conjectured upper bound. If formula_1 is not prime, then a similar construction using a prime number close to formula_1 achieves the same asymptotic lower 

 eventually disproved Heilbronn&#x27;s conjecture, by using the probabilistic method to find sets of points whose smallest triangle area is larger than the ones found by Erdős. Their construction involves the following steps:
*Randomly place formula_25 points in the unit square, for 
*Remove all pairs of points that are unexpectedly close together.
*Prove that there are few remaining low-area triangles and therefore only a sublinear number of cycles formed by two, three, or four low-area triangles. Remove all points belonging to these cycles.
*Apply a triangle removal lemma for 3-uniform hypergraphs of high girth to show that, with high probability, the remaining points include a subset of formula_1 points that do not form any small-area triangles.
The area resulting from their construction grows asymptotically as
formula_27
The proof can be derandomized, leading to a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing placements with this triangle area.

==Upper bounds==
Every set of formula_1 points in the unit square forms a triangle of area at most inversely proportional One way to see this is to triangulate the convex hull of the given point and choose the smallest of the triangles in the triangulation. Another is to sort the points by their and to choose the three consecutive points in this ordering whose are the closest together. In the first paper published on the Heilbronn triangle problem, in 1951, Klaus Roth proved a stronger upper bound of the form
formula_29
The best bound known to date is of the form
formula_30
for some proven by .

A new upper bound equal to formula_31 was proven by .

==Specific shapes and numbers==
 has investigated the optimal arrangements of formula_1 points in a square, for formula_1 up to 16. Goldberg&#x27;s constructions for up to six points lie on the boundary of the square, and are placed to form an affine transformation of the vertices of a regular polygon. For larger values improved Goldberg&#x27;s bounds, and for these values the solutions include points interior to the square. These constructions have been proven optimal for up to seven points. The proof used a computer search to subdivide the configuration space of possible arrangements of the points into 226 different subproblems, and used nonlinear programming techniques to show that in 225 of those cases, the best arrangement was not as good as the known bound. In the remaining case, including the eventual optimal solution, its optimality was proven using symbolic computation techniques.

The following are the best known solutions for 7–12 points in a unit square, found through simulated annealing; the arrangement for seven points is known to be optimal.

Instead of looking for optimal placements for a given shape, one may look for an optimal shape for a given number of points. Among convex shapes formula_3 with area one, the regular hexagon is the one that for this shape, with six points optimally placed at the hexagon vertices. The convex shapes of unit area that maximize formula_35 have 

==Variations==
There have been many variations of this problem 
including the case of a uniformly random set of points, for which arguments based on either Kolmogorov complexity or Poisson approximation show that the expected value of the minimum area is inversely proportional to the cube of the number of points. Variations involving the volume of higher-dimensional simplices have also been studied.

Rather than considering simplices, another higher-dimensional version adds another and asks for placements of formula_1 points in the unit hypercube that maximize the minimum volume of the convex hull of any subset of formula_37 points. For formula_38 these subsets form simplices but for larger values relative they can form more complicated shapes. When formula_37 is sufficiently large relative randomly placed point sets have minimum convex hull No better bound is possible; any placement has formula_37 points with obtained by choosing some formula_37 consecutive points in coordinate order. This result has applications in range searching data structures.

<text>Félix Brillant (born September 9, 1980, in Brossard, Quebec) is a Canadian former soccer player who played as a midfielder and later became a soccer coach.

==Career==

===Youth and amateur===
Brillant began his career in the youth system of French team AS Cannes, but never appeared for the senior side. He returned to North America in 2002, and played college soccer for at Franklin Pierce College in the NCAA Division II, where he was named All-New England Region four times.

In 2002 and 2003 he also played for Cape Cod Crusaders in the USL Premier Development League, with whom he won back-to-back PDL championships.

===Professional===
Brillant was drafted 56th overall by the New England Revolution in the 2004 MLS Superdraft and scored a goal in the 2004 season for the Revs, but was released in June 2005 without making an appearance that season.

Brillant played for the Virginia Beach Mariners in the USL First Division in 2005 and 2006, and then played midfield for Sparta Sarpsborg of the Adeccoligaen in 2007.

On July 30, 2008, Brillant signed a contract with the Montreal Impact of the United Soccer League. During the 2008 season Brillant helped the team move up in the USL First Division standings. In 11 games, including four starts, Brillant tallied five points, all on August 24, in a 3–1 win against Atlanta Silverbacks. He also took part in six of the eight games that the Impact played in the CONCACAF Champions League.

On December 2, 2008, the Montreal Impact announced the re-signing of Brillant to a two-year contract. During the 2009 USL season Brillant contributed by helping the Impact clinch a playoff spot under new head coach Marc Dos Santos. He helped the Impact reach the finals where Montreal would face the Vancouver Whitecaps, this marking the first time in USL history where the final match would consist of two Canadian clubs. In the final Brillant helped the Impact win the series 6–3 on aggregate. The victory gave the Impact their third USL Championship and also the victory marked Brillant&#x27;s first USL Championship. On November 30, 2009, Brillant was released by the Impact, and joined the reserve team Trois-Rivières Attak in the Canadian Soccer League.

===International===
Brillant played for the Canadian national U-17 team in the late 1990s. He was on the bench for Canada&#x27;s FIFA World Cup Qualifier against Guatemala on 13 October 2004, but did not play in the game.

== Managerial career ==
In 2020, he was named the assistant coach under head coach Nicolas Gagnon for the Montreal Impact U-17 team. He was re-signed for the 2022 season and was also named the academy&#x27;s senior educator of the cub&#x27;s scouting and development centre.

==Honors==

===Cape Cod Crusaders===
*USL Premier Development League Champions (1): 2003

<text>Ernst Engel (; ; 26 March 18218 December 1896) was a German statistician and economist, famous for the Engel curve and Engel&#x27;s law.

==Biography==
Ernst was born in Dresden in 1821. He studied at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology in Saxony, and on completing his curriculum traveled in Germany and France.

Immediately after the revolution of 1848, Engel was attached to the royal commission in Saxony appointed to determine the relations between trade and labor. In 1850, he was directed by the government to assist in the organization of the German Industrial Exhibition of Leipzig (the first of its kind). His efforts were so successful that, in 1854, he was induced to enter the government service, as chief of the newly instituted statistical department. He retired, however, from the office in 1858. He founded at Dresden the first Mortgage Insurance Society (Hypotheken-Versicherungsgesellschaft), and as a result of the success of his work, was summoned in 1860 to Berlin as director of the statistical department, in succession to Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Dieterici. In his new office, he made himself a name of worldwide reputation. Raised to the rank of &quot;Geheimer Regierungsrat&quot;, he retired in 1882 and lived henceforward in Serkowitz, today part of Radebeul near Dresden, where he died in 1896. His investigations into the social condition of the working classes were much noted.

==Works==
Engel was a voluminous writer on the subjects with which his name is connected, but his statistical papers are mostly published in the periodicals which he himself established, namely, &quot;Preuss. Statistik&quot; (in 1861); &quot;Zeitschrift des Königlichen Preußischen Statistischen Bureaus&quot;, and &quot;Zeitschrift des Statistischen Bureaus des Königreichs Sachsen&quot;.
Among his works were &quot;Die Methoden der Volkszählung&quot; (&quot;Census methods,&quot; 1861), &quot;Die Volkszählungen, ihre Stellung zur Wissenschaft und ihre Aufgabe in der Geschichte&quot; (&quot;Censuses, their place in science and role in history,&quot; 1862), &quot;Land und Leute des Preussischen Staates&quot; (&quot;The Prussian land and people,&quot; 1863), and &quot;Das Zeitalter des Dampfes&quot; (&quot;The era of steam,&quot; 1881).

<text>Kalvaryja (Belarusian: Кальварыя, ) is a Catholic Calvary cemetery in Minsk, Belarus.

The cemetery contains a small Catholic chapel, currently used for general worship. The original wooden Catholic church was first built here back in 1673, but currently the oldest remaining graves are from 1808. The small chapel was built in 1839. Several famous Polish and Belarusian personalities from the 19th century are buried at Kalvaryja.

In 2001, the cemetery became the center of a controversy when it was revealed that the state-run company responsible for taking care of the graves was destroying old graves and selling the newly freed slots to the wealthy.

Adam Hlobus wrote a short story set in Kalvaryja.

<doc id="1013978" wikidata="Q805848" url="?curid=1013978" title="Balvanera">
<text>Balvanera is a barrio or neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

==Origin of name and alternative names==
The official name, Balvanera, is the name of the &quot;parroquia&quot; (parish) centered around the church of &quot;Nuestra Señora de Balvanera&quot;, erected in 1831.

The zone around Corrientes avenue is known as Once after &quot;Plaza Once de Septiembre&quot;, the alternative name of &quot;Plaza Miserere&quot; (the square in which president Bernardino Rivadavia&#x27;s mausoleum is located).

The south-eastern part of Balvanera is often called Congreso, as it contains the Congress building and the neighboring &quot;Plaza del Congreso&quot; (Congressional Plaza).

The north-western part of Balvanera is referred to as Abasto after the landmark Abasto market (now a shopping mall; see below).

==History and communities==



Towards the middle of the 18th century the lands of the current Balvanera belonged to Antonio González Varela, a Spaniard known by the nickname of Miserere. In 1799 the priest Damián Pérez, received a plot of land, where years later was built the Parish Nuestra Señora de Balvanera.

During the British invasions of the River Plate, the town of Balvanera was the scene of the battles between the Spanish troops under Santiago de Liniers and the English, commanded by William Beresford. The 
Battle of Miserere, occurred during the second invasion, took place in the current Miserere square on July 2, 1807.

In 1833 the Cemetery of the Dissidents was installed in Balvanera, a resting place for Protestants of English, German and US-American origin. The Protestant cemetery closed in 1892, the bodies that were buried there were transferred to the British Cemetery of Chacarita. This cemetery, also known as the &quot;Cementerio de la Victoria&quot; was located in the current Plaza Primero de Mayo, and among its illustrious residents was Elizabeth Chitty Curling de Brown (wife of William Brown), whose tomb was never found. 
Until the 1860s, Balvanera was considered an outskirt of Buenos Aires proper. In 1836, a census set its population at 3,635. Most inhabitants lived in &quot;quintas&quot; (small estates), and the zone was known as &quot;las quintas&quot;. The &quot;Camino Real&quot; (now Rivadavia) was the main road from the city to the west.

In the late 19th century, Balvanera had a strong political tradition, identifying first with Adolfo Alsina and then with UCR leaders Leandro Alem and Hipólito Yrigoyen.

By 1900, Balvanera was associated mostly with violently contested elections—and with the brothels in the &quot;Junín y Lavalle&quot; area where, according to Borges, the tango dance acquired its notorious erotic overtones. Natural growth and railroad development eventually assimilated the neighbourhood into the city.

During the 1910s and 1920s, the area around Corrientes avenue became the center of Buenos Aires&#x27;s Jewish community and the hub of the garment trade, which in turn attracted segments of the Arab and Armenian communities.

A number of Jewish institutions are located in Balvanera, including the Gran Templo Paso and the AMIA community center (bombed on July 18, 1994, in the bloodiest terror attack ever on Argentine soil).

The southern part of Balvanera is home to some traditional institutions of the Galician community, and features a lively furniture trade along Belgrano avenue.

In the late 1970s, Balvanera became a favored location for electronics import shops which co-exist with the more traditional fabrics and garment shops. Newly arrived Korean and Chinese immigrants have become a strong presence in several fields of commerce (see Asian-Argentines).

==Geography==

Balvanera is located to the west of downtown Buenos Aires (&quot;el centro&quot;, which comprises San Nicolás and Montserrat). The elegant northern neighbourhood of Recoleta (part of the area known as &quot;Barrio Norte&quot;) is located north of Balvanera, crossing Córdoba avenue.

Most dwellers of Balvanera live in apartment buildings erected on small lots. Population density is very high, and the amount of green space is deemed insufficient. The meager green space of Plaza Miserere is usually taken up by illegal peddlers, people queuing for their bus, and preachers of all stripes.

As in most of Buenos Aires, the streets are laid out in a checkboard pattern. Most streets and avenues are one-way.

The main streets of Balvanera are arguably Rivadavia, which crosses the entire city from East to West (North-South streets change their name when crossing Rivadavia), and Corrientes, which is the main thoroughfare of commerce and entertainment in Buenos Aires. The &quot;kilómetro cero&quot; reference, from which all Argentine routes count the distance to Buenos Aires, is marked by a monolith in Plaza Congreso.

==Highlights==
===Notable places===

The mausoleum of President Rivadavia in Plaza Miserere (Once) used to be covered in graffiti; after a fence was erected around it, its state of repair has improved markedly.

The University complex on the northern edge of Balvanera is home to many faculties of the University of Buenos Aires, including Medicine, Odontology, Economics, Pharmacy, and Social Science, as well as the &quot;Clínicas&quot; University Hospital. Many private universities have facilities in Balvanera.

The Ramos Mejía general hospital and the Santa Lucía ophthalmology hospital are located in southern Balvanera. Many private health-care institutions are located in Balvanera, mostly around the Faculty of Medicine complex.

Among the architectural features in Balvanera are the neo-classical Congress building and the statue group in neighboring Plaza Congreso. The &quot;El Molino&quot; coffeehouse is located across the street in a building that has seen several rounds of restoration since its heyday.

The café &quot;Los Angelitos&quot; in the corner of Rivadavia and Rincón was a meeting point for poets and musicians. It features a relief of angels in its façade , which is one of the landmarks of the &quot;barrio&quot;. After extensive restorations, it was reopened in 2007 , with plans to offer live tango and become a tourist landmark much like the Tortoni and Ideal cafés.

===Culture===

There are many theater and concert halls in Balvanera. The Liceo theater and the Ricardo Rojas cultural center are two of the best-known venues.

For most of the 20th century, Once had a lively Yiddish theater scene; the IFT theater still stands on Boulogne Sur-Mer street, where mural paintings celebrate its rich history.

Author Macedonio Fernández resided in Balvanera for most of his adult life, and held court, together with Borges, in café &quot;La Perla&quot; across Miserere Plaza (&quot;Plaza Once&quot;). In the 1960s, the same café was one of the birthplaces of Argentine rock, to the point that the early hit &quot;La balsa&quot; starts with a reference to the washroom of &quot;La Perla&quot; (in author Tanguito&#x27;s version).

Many actors (such as Dringue Farías) lived in Balvanera within walking distance of the theater district.
In the 1980s, Cafe Einstein was a hub of alternative art, featuring acts such as Sumo.

Much of the Argentine cumbia scene of the 1990s revolved around dance halls near the Once train station.

North of Once station, many former warehouses have been recycled into lofts, offices, or entertainment venues. One of these, the &quot;República Cromagnon&quot; concert hall (formerly a mini-stadium and dance hall), caught fire on 30 December 2004. 194 people were killed and over 600 were injured. The street outside the venue was closed on and off for several years to serve as a memorial, severely disturbing car and bus traffic.

===Commerce===
Currently, more than 25,000 shops are registered in Balvanera, where zoning regulations favor commerce. Many apartment buildings host one or more shops at ground level. The plot of the 2004 movie &quot;El abrazo partido&quot; revolves around one of Balvanera&#x27;s many shopping &quot;galerías&quot; (galleries).

The block of Pueyrredón avenue across Plaza Once features a busy bazaar-like commercial area known as &quot;La Recova&quot;.

The Abasto shopping mall was the city&#x27;s wholesale produce market until the late 1980s; its history is closely associated with the life and career of tango singer Carlos Gardel. The area around the market used to contain produce warehouses and low-rent housing for the laborers; with its conversion to a high-end mall, the area experienced a gentrification process from the mid-1990s that was slowed by the 2001 economic crisis; but has resumed at a record pace, since.

==Transportation==
Being close to the downtown district, Balvanera has access to diverse transportation options.

=== Metro ===
Balvanera has access to five out of the six &quot;Subte&quot; lines. The downtown area is a short subway trip from anywhere in Balvanera. All intercity train stations are accessible from Balvanera by &quot;Subte&quot;.

===Bus===
Many bus lines go through Balvanera, including the Colectivo 60 line, venerated by locals as &quot;el internacional&quot;, because its route passes many city landmarks. Other important lines include Colectivo 19, which has been the subject of a composition by Lito Vitale.

Around Plaza Once, numerous long-distance bus depots provide service to major locations in Argentina and neighboring countries. Since its opening in 1980, most long-distance and international bus lines have their terminals at the Retiro bus station, accessible via &quot;subte&quot; or bus lines such as Colectivo 6.

===Train===
The &quot;Once de Septiembre&quot; train station provides commuter service to the western neighbourhoods and suburbs.

===Road===
* Westbound: The main avenues are Independencia, Rivadavia and Córdoba.
* Eastbound: The main avenues are Belgrano and Corrientes. Both run all the way to the former shoreline and the Puerto Madero area.
* Northbound: The main avenue is Entre Ríos; north of Rivadavia, its name changes to Callao.
* Southbound: The main avenue is Pueyrredón; south of Rivadavia, its name changes to Jujuy.

During peak hours, most of Balvanera&#x27;s streets are congested, some of them heavily. Most streets carry bus traffic; the main avenues have special lanes for buses and taxis.
Entre Ríos and Jujuy avenues have on-ramps and off-ramps to &quot;Autopista 25 de Mayo&quot; :es:Autopista 25 de Mayo, an elevated toll road that provides rapid access to the western suburbs and to Ezeiza airport.

<doc id="1013983" wikidata="Q180187" url="?curid=1013983" title="Honduras national football team">
<text>The Honduras national football team () represents Honduras in men&#x27;s international football. The team is governed by the Federación Nacional Autónoma de Fútbol de Honduras. They are nicknamed &quot;Los Catrachos&quot;, &quot;La Bicolor,&quot; or &quot;La H&quot;.

Honduras has qualified for the World Cup three times, in 1982, 2010, and 2014, and never advanced beyond the group stage. Outside of the FIFA World Cup tournament, Honduras has competed in several other international competitions, like the CONCACAF Championship (which they won in 1981), and the Copa América (which their best result was third place in 2001). Apart from that, Honduras has also won the Central American Cup championship four times, having won the final edition in 2017. The national team plays in the Nations League

==History==
The national team made its debut in the Independence Centenary Games held in Guatemala City in September 1921, losing 9–0 to Guatemala. The Honduras Men&#x27;s National Team is the representative team in official men&#x27;s football. They were created and played in a football tournament organized to celebrate Central American Independence the first international football match.

During their first appearance at the Central American and Caribbean Games in 1930, Honduras posted a record of two wins and three losses. Their only wins came against Jamaica (5–1) and El Salvador (4–1), while they lost two games to Cuba and Costa Rica.

The national association, the National Autonomous Federation of Football of Honduras (FENAFUTH) was founded in 1935. It joined FIFA in 1946 and co-founded CONCACAF in 1961.

===1970 World Cup and the Football War===
Prior to the qualification stages leading up to the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador found themselves in what was called the Football War. This nickname was given to the situation after a play-off game was played between the two countries to decide which would qualify for the Finals. This political crisis eventually turned into a war that lasted approximately 100 hours.

Honduras had begun qualifying by defeating Costa Rica and Jamaica. Against Jamaica, they easily won both games, 5–1 on aggregate. They beat Costa Rica 1–0 in Tegucigalpa and drew 1–1 away. This set up a final match between Honduras and El Salvador, who had eliminated Guyana and the Netherlands Antilles.

In the first game against El Salvador, Honduras won 1–0 in Tegucigalpa on 8 June 1969. Honduras were coached by Carlos Padilla Velásquez and the only goal of the game was scored by Leonard Welch. Honduras lost the second game 3–0 in San Salvador, and a play-off was required in the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City on 27 June. El Salvador won 3–2 to qualify and eliminate Honduras from the qualifications.

===1982 World Cup===
Honduras won the 1981 CONCACAF Championship and qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 1982. Despite drawing against the hosts Spain and Northern Ireland, both 1–1, they were eliminated in the first round after losing their last match to Yugoslavia 1–0.
Honduras finished second in the 1985 CONCACAF Championship, losing their final match 2–1 against Canada, who went on to qualify for the 1986 World Cup. Their next major accomplishment was being runners-up at the 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup, losing against the host nation, the United States.

For the 1998 World Cup, Jamaica and Mexico eliminated Honduras at the third round stage. Despite Honduras&#x27;s overwhelming 11–3 victory against Saint Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, Jamaica defeated Mexico at Independence Park, Kingston, allowing the Reggae Boys to advance to the next round.

===2001 Copa América===

Since 1993, CONMEBOL has invited teams from other confederations to participate in their confederation championship, the Copa América. Honduras took part as one of the last-minute teams added for the 2001 tournament, as Argentina dropped out one day before the start. The team arrived only a few hours before the tournament&#x27;s first game and with barely enough players. Despite the odds, Honduras progressed into the quarter-finals, where they defeated Brazil 2–0. In the semi-finals, Colombia knocked out Honduras 2–0.

Honduras advanced to the final round in the qualifying competition for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but again failed to qualify after losing at home to Trinidad &amp; Tobago, and away against Mexico in their final two matches. The match against Trinidad, and Tobago saw Honduras hit the goal post eight times.

===2010 World Cup===
On 14 October 2009, Honduras qualified for the 2010 World Cup after a 1–0 win against El Salvador gave them the third automatic qualifying spot from the Fourth round of CONCACAF Qualifying.

Honduras faced Chile, Spain, and Switzerland in their first-round group. In their first match they lost to Chile 1–0, to a goal from Jean Beausejour. They then lost 2–0 to Spain, with both goals scored by David Villa. In their last match they drew 0–0 against Switzerland and were eliminated in last place in the group.
===2014 World Cup===

In the qualifying competition for the 2014 World Cup, Honduras were given a bye to the third round because of their third-place position among CONCACAF teams in the March 2011 FIFA World Rankings. They qualified for the final round by finishing first in their group, which included Panama, Canada and Cuba. After beginning with a home defeat against Panama, Honduras recovered and beat Canada 8–1 in their final match, allowing them to win the group ahead of Panama.

In the final round of qualifying, the Hexagonal, six teams faced each other in a home-and-away format. In their first two games, Honduras defeated the United States 2–1 and came back from a two-goal deficit to draw 2–2 with Mexico. They lost three of their next four matches before traveling to Mexico City to face Mexico in the Azteca. Honduras again trailed but scored twice in the second half for a stunning 2–1 win. They returned to Tegucigalpa, where they drew 2–2 against Panama, who escaped defeat with a last-minute goal by Roberto Chen. In the final two games, Honduras beat Costa Rica 1–0 at home and qualified with a 2–2 draw against Jamaica in Kingston.
In the Finals in Brazil, Honduras again finished bottom of their first-round group, after 3–0 defeats against France and Switzerland, and a 2–1 defeat to Ecuador. The match against France featured the first use of goal-line technology to award a goal at the World Cup: an own-goal by Honduras&#x27;s goalkeeper, Noel Valladares. Against Ecuador, Carlo Costly scored Honduras&#x27;s first goal in the Finals for 31 years.
===Decline===

Honduras failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. In the Hexagonal stage they dropped into fourth place after Panama scored an 88th-minute winning goal in their last match against Costa Rica. Honduras had themselves dropped points by conceding late goals in their two previous games, against Costa Rica and the United States. They entered a play-off against Australia, and after a 0–0 draw at home, Honduras were eliminated when they lost the second leg in Sydney 3–1.

In the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF third round, Honduras did considerably worse, with the Hondurans, for the first time ever in a World Cup qualification, failed to register a win, with just four draws. Immediate effect with the national team as they are going through a generational change of players for the team.

==Home stadium==

Honduras plays the majority of its home games at Estadio Nacional Chelato Uclés in Tegucigalpa.

The national team formerly played at Estadio Olímpico Metropolitano in San Pedro Sula, which stopped being the home stadium due to declining facilities. Estadio Francisco Morazán also occasionally hosts home games.

Estadio Nilmo Edwards in La Ceiba has also hosted friendly exhibition matches since 2007.

<text>The tola ( / ; also transliterated as tolah or tole) is a traditional Ancient Indian and South Asian unit of mass, now standardised as 180 grains () or exactly  troy ounce. It was the base unit of mass in the British Indian system of weights and measures introduced in 1833, although it had been in use for much longer. It was also used in Aden and Zanzibar: in the latter, one tola was equivalent to 175.90 troy grains (0.97722222 British tolas, or 11.33980925 grams).

The tola is a Vedic measure, with the name derived from the Sanskrit (from the root ) meaning &quot;weighing&quot; or &quot;weight&quot;. One tola was traditionally the weight of 100 Ratti (ruttee) seeds, and its exact weight varied according to locality. However, it is also a convenient mass for a coin: several pre-colonial coins, including the currency of Akbar the Great (1556–1605), had a mass of &quot;one tola&quot; within slight variation. The first rupee (; &quot;rupayā&quot;), minted by Sher Shah Suri (1540–45), had a mass of 178 troy grains, or about 1% less than the British tola. The British East India Company issued a silver rupee coin of 180 troy grains, and this became the practical standard mass for the tola well into the 20th century.

The British tola of 180 troy grains (from 1833) can be seen as more of a standardisation than a redefinition: the previous standard in the Bengal Presidency, the system of &quot;sicca weights&quot;, was the mass of one Murshidabad rupee, 179.666 troy grains. For the larger weights used in commerce (in the Bengal Presidency), the variation in the pre-1833 standards was found to be greater than the adjustment.

The tola formed the base for units of mass under the British Indian system, and was also the standard measure of gold and silver bullion. Although the tola has been officially replaced by metric units since 1956, it is still in current use, and is a popular denomination for gold bullion bars in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Singapore, with a ten tola bar being the most commonly traded. In Nepal, minting of tola size gold coins continue up to the present, even though the currency of Nepal is called rupee and has no official connection to the tola. It is also used in most gold markets (bazars/souks) in the United Arab Emirates and in all the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) countries.

Tola is still used as a measure of &quot;charas&quot; (Indian hashish). On the black market, however, one tola equals a mass of approximately and not the actual mass of one tola.

<text>Luis Ernesto Alva y Talledo, better known as Luigi Alva (born 10 April 1927 in Paíta, Peru) is a Peruvian operatic tenor. A Mozart and Rossini specialist, Alva achieved fame with roles such as Don Ottavio (in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;), Count Almaviva (in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;) and Fenton (in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;). He retired from the stage in 1989.

==Biography==
Alva was born in Paita, Peru, and served for a while in the Peruvian Navy before concentrating on a singing career. He studied at the Conservatorio Nacional de Música in Lima under Rosa Mercedes Ayarza de Morales and made his operatic debut in Federico Moreno Torroba&#x27;s &quot;Luisa Fernanda&quot; in Lima in 1949. Alva went to Milan in 1953 and studied under Emilio Ghirardini and Ettore Campogalliani. He made his European debut at the Teatro Nuovo in Milan as Alfredo in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; in 1954, following that as Paolino in Cimarosa&#x27;s &quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot;. His debut at the La Scala came in 1956 as Count Almaviva in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, the role for which he became best known and widely admired. Subsequently he sang with most of the leading opera festivals and companies in the US and Europe. At Glyndebourne he made his debut as Nemorino in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;. In 1962, Alva made his debut with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company as Count Almaviva and in 1964 he made his first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera as Fenton in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;. He went on to sing in a further 101 performances at the Met between 1964 and 1975.

Alva had a light lyric tenor voice and was known for the clarity of his diction and his elegant phrasing, a quality which George Jellinek described as compensating for an &quot;underpowered&quot; voice in the 1956 live recording of &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; from La Scala. He rarely ventured beyond his favourite repertoire, which included Mozart, Rossini, and Donizetti and to which (according to Harold Rosenthal) his &quot;elegant, refined style&quot; was particularly suited. In 1980, he founded the Asociación Prolírica del Perú in Lima and served as its artistic director for several years. He retired from the stage in 1989, but sponsors the Premio Luigi Alva for young singers, gives master classes, and serves as a juror in singing competitions. Alva also teaches singing at La Scuola di Canto (Voice Academy) at La Scala in Milan. Amongst his students there was the Belgian tenor Marc Laho.

In 2005, the Peruvian postal service issued a stamp in his honour and in 2012 he was awarded the Personalidad Meritoria de la Cultura medal by the Peruvian Ministry of Culture.

<doc id="1013999" wikidata="Q1136895" url="?curid=1013999" title="Engel's law">
<text>Engel&#x27;s law is an economic relationship proposed by the statistician Ernst Engel in 1857. It suggests that as family income increases, the percentage spent on food decreases, even though the total amount of food expenditure increases. Expenditure on housing and clothing remains proportionally the same, and that spent on education, health and recreation rises.

Even though Engel&#x27;s law was proposed roughly 160 years ago, it holds relevance today in the context of poverty, especially the reduction of poverty. For instance, the lines and rates for national poverty are often determined by the food share of household expenditure.

A quotation of Engel himself reveals the same relationship between income and percentage of income spent on food, but also indicates the application of Engel&#x27;s Law in measuring standard of living:

== Understanding Engel&#x27;s law ==

Engel&#x27;s law states that an increase in the income of a family decreases the proportion of the income which is spent on food, even though the total amount of food expenditure is increasing. In other words, the income elasticity of demand of food is between 0 and 1. For instance, a family with a $5000 monthly income is spending $2000 on food - which is 40%. Say the income of this family would increase by 40% - to $7000. In this case they would spend around $2500 on food. So, although the absolute expenditure on food would increase by 25%, the relative proportion would decrease by 35.7%. This example clearly shows the notion supported by Engel&#x27;s Law, which is that households with lower income will spend a larger amount of their income on food items than the ones in the middle- or higher-income levels. For a poor family, the food expenditure is a big portion of their total budget, while the rich tend to spend more of their money on items such as entertainment and luxury goods. To be clear, Engel&#x27;s law does not imply that food spending remains unchanged as income increases; instead, it suggests that consumers increase their expenditures for food products in percentage terms less than their increases in income. The interaction between Engel&#x27;s law, technological progress, and the process of structural change is crucial for explaining long-term economic growth as suggested by Leon, and Pasinetti.

== Engel curve ==

A concept which is based on Engel&#x27;s law is Engel curve. This curve shows how the spending on a certain good varies by either the proportion or absolute dollar amount. The shape of the curve depends on factors such as age, gender, educational level and which type of good it is visualising. Moving along the curve assumes that these factors are held constant, &quot;ceteris paribus&quot;, while only income is changed. Logically, when demographic factors change, the Engel curve shifts accordingly. Moreover, Pope (2012) notes that larger families will have higher food consumption, as well as that consumption expenditures change throughout a life cycle, even holding income and other demographic variables are held constant. The share of a budget spent on food rise and then fall during a lifetime, producing an inverted parabola, indicating that expenditures on food as well as total expenditures peak during mid-life.

With income level as the x-axis and expenditures as the y-axis, the Engel curves show upward slopes for normal goods, which have a positive income elasticity of demand. Inferior goods with negative income elasticity, assume negative slopes for their Engel curves. In the case of food, the Engel curve is concave downward with a positive but decreasing slope. Engel argues that food is a normal good, yet the share of household&#x27;s budget spent on food falls as income increases, making food a necessity.
==History of Engel&#x27;s law==

In 1857, by using data from several households, Ernst Engel found that household food expenditure and household income are correlating. The relationship between food share of household expenditure and household income was also highly consistent. The income elasticity for food expenditure was inelastic, below 1 (around .86) for each gathered dataset, meaning it is insensitive to price changes.

By 1875 Engel&#x27;s law had spread across the Atlantic to America. There it gained attention and was used by Carroll D. Wright, which did not only argue that food expenditure was the only thing that varied with income, but that in fact clothing, housing and sundries (meaning expenditures that are not frequently incurred, like home improvement items) also varied with income in agreement with Engel&#x27;s law.

In 1932 Zimmerman stated that Engel&#x27;s law had been utilised for other factors than income to food expenditure, which should not be the practice. He states: &quot;It is evident that Engel&#x27;s law, rigidly interpreted is not true for particular families, for particular times, and under certain circumstances&quot; and &quot;The &#x27;Engel&#x27; type of standard of living applies to no more than half of the people of the globe.&quot; Zimmerman argues that the reason for this is among other things personal tastes, family size and cultural preferences.

In a review by Houthakker in 1957, the household incomes and elasticities on food, clothing and miscellaneous items are further investigated, by looking at 40 households from 30 countries. The elasticities are found to be similar to Engel&#x27;s law, not equal. Based on this research, Houthakker claims that &quot;If no data on the expenditure patterns of a country are available at all, one would not be very far astray by putting the partial elasticity at 0.6 with respect to food.&quot;

Since then, researches on patterns concerning food expenditure have mainly become empirical using sophisticated statistical models. This is in part made possible due to the ever-increasing amount of data available. It is today quite common to simultaneously analyse how different types of expenditures change along with household income or total expenditure. In the 21st century there have been relatively few cross-national studies of the extent to which Engel&#x27;s law remain relevant. However, a study by Richard Anker in 2011 showed &quot;&quot;convincing evidence&quot; &quot;[...]&quot; &quot;that Engel&#x27;s law continues to be relevant today across countries as well as across households within countries&quot;&quot;, but he also draws the conclusion that Engel&#x27;s law today is only sufficiently strong to predict differences in food shares of countries that have large enough differences when it comes to income per capita. It is important to note that currently researchers assume an income elasticity of food being less than 1.0 (but more than 0.0), which further implies that the share of household expenditure on food decreases with rising income. Therefore Engel&#x27;s law is a commonly accepted economic relationship and often referred to in the introductory sections of academic papers.

==The Problem==

The reliability of the conclusions derived from Engel&#x27;s law is non-negotiable as his law can be proved empirically as well as theoretically using today&#x27;s methods and theorems. References to Engel&#x27;s law usually involve his tables from his analysis where the correlation between income and food expenditures is highlighted. The table depicts a series of various annual incomes for families in francs ranging from 200 to 3,000 and the respective share spent on food. The percentage drops from 72.96% for the lowest income family to 56.9% to the highest one hence we can clearly see a drop of 16% which was the main basis for Engel&#x27;s claim.

However one issue that is worth raising is how he was able to obtain the 29 observations used as the correlation coefficient between the values is relatively high and Engel never mentioned the method he used to come up with the approximations. 
One potential method could have been the least-squares estimation which, after coming up with the regression line and applying the adequate coefficients of interpolation, would fit the equation perfectly. Unfortunately, the first known publication of the method was over 30 years after Engel&#x27;s paper.

A way simpler possibility comes to mind and it is just drawing a straight line between two points and coming up with all the relevant data graphically. However, even though it is clearly seen in the paper that the income perceived is rising by 100 francs per sample family, the food expenditure is definitely not decreasing following any fixed arithmetic trend but it could be a geometric rate.

His data could have been derived from an approximation following several news articles at the time. For example, a study showed that the average skilled worker in Manchester spent 60% of his earnings on food while a corresponding family would earn around 1,700 annually which is relatively close to Engel&#x27;s estimation of 59.79. Several other sources can be quoted which make Engel&#x27;s data look more and more reliable.
Engel&#x27;s data could have either been extracted from a variety of news articles and local studies from the English market at the time or from an approximation that he came up with but the soundness of the conclusion derived from the set is very rational.

==Implication today==

Engel&#x27;s law can be used as an indicator when looking at standards of living in various countries. For that purpose a measure called Engel coefficient is used, which is simply a food budget share at a point in time. A country that would be poor and have a lower standard of living would have a high Engel coefficient, whereas a country with higher standards of living would have a lower Engel coefficient. The Engel coefficient is used for this purpose by The United Nations (UN), where a coefficient above 59% represents poverty, 50-59% represents a state where daily needs are barely met, 40-50% a moderately well-off standard of living, 30-40% a good standard of living and below 30% a wealthy life.

Inferring well-being from budget share for food. Based on Engel&#x27;s empirical findings that the share of budget spent on food falls with rising income, suggests that economic growth (and with it rising incomes in the population) is a solution to malnourishment. Using the Engel coefficient countries can set national poverty lines, where the most common measure is to divide the cost of a nutritious diet by the Engel coefficient. In his paper Pope (2012) illustrates that convergence between food budget shares between rural and urban regions have been used to reflect standards of living.

Food&#x27;s budget share as indicator of changes in real income. Hamilton (2001) interprets Engel&#x27;s law and suggests that movements in the percentage of budget share spent on food may serve as an indicator of changes to the real income. In his paper, Hamilton (2001) measures the inconsistency of the real income inferred from changes to food budget shares with the real income measured directly and proceeds to estimate the bias in CPI. Food functions as a good indicator of inflation as its income elasticity is sufficiently different from 1.0; food is not durable, implying that expenditure on food is essentially equal to consumption; food is easy to separate from other goods in consumers&#x27; utility functions, and lastly food is a good easy to define.

Agricultural sector shrinks as a percentage of total economic activity as a country grows. Engel&#x27;s law implies that when a country grows, the agricultural sector will constitute a smaller percentage of the country&#x27;s economic activity. This is due to the fact that the share of income spent on food decreases as income itself increases (from economic growth). Pope (2012) illustrates on the U.S. that the share of workers in the agricultural sector fell from 41% in 1900 to less than 2% in 2000. This phenomenon is reflected in the fact that more developed economies have lesser proportion of the workforce in the agricultural sector.

Increases in agricultural prices affect the poor disproportionately. From the Engel&#x27;s law it is evident that food constitutes a large proportion of the budget of the poor, and therefore changes in related prices have a larger impact on the poor than on the rich. Policies which raise agricultural prices will reduce real incomes of the poor proportionately more than they will reduce the incomes of the rich.

<text>The International Baseball Federation (IBAF) is the former international governing body of baseball. It has since been superseded by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), and continues to exist as the WBSC&#x27;s baseball division. Between 1944 and 1975, it was known by its Spanish-language name, as the Federación Internacional de Béisbol Amateur, or FIBA.

Prior to the establishment of the WBSC, the IBAF was the sole entity recognized by the International Olympic Committee as overseeing the sport, and as the designated organizer and promoter of major international tournaments like the Baseball World Cup (originally the Amateur World Series) and the Intercontinental Cup. It also organized the inaugural World Baseball Classic (WBC), in cooperation with Major League Baseball, in 2006.

One of its principal responsibilities as the WBSC&#x27;s umbrella is to organize, standardize and sanction international competitions, using the WBSC name, among baseball&#x27;s 124 national governing bodies through its various tournaments to determine a world champion and calculate world rankings for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s baseball. Its offices are housed within the WBSC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland—the Olympic Capital.

==History==
===Background===

The first-ever international baseball event was a series of exhibition games that took place during the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, United States. The exhibition proved so successful that it was given an encore at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden.

The two popular showings in St. Louis and Stockholm laid the groundwork for baseball&#x27;s international surge in popularity, leading the sport to be placed onto the program as an exhibition sport at the 1936 Summer Olympics. This exhibition was extremely well received as 92,565 spectators filled the Olympic Stadium in Berlin to watch a game between two teams from the US.

Following the success of Berlin, the first ever Baseball World Cup was organized in London, England, in August 1938. The United States and Great Britain engaged in five games, of which the British won four.

The growth of baseball competitions involving the representation of countries, coupled with the birth of the Baseball World Cup, provided the need for an institution to help develop, organize, regulate and oversee these events, thus the International Baseball Federation was established in 1938. It was initially headquartered in the offices of Orange Bowl Stadium in Miami, Florida.

=== Early years and FIBA ===
Conflicts of World War II prompted the IOC to cancel the Summer Games that had been scheduled to take place in Tokyo in 1940 and in London in 1944, thereby halting baseball&#x27;s tour as a demonstration sport. Nevertheless, by 1950, FIBA was able to expand the format of the Baseball World Cup that was contested in Managua, Nicaragua, to 12 participating countries.

In 1951, the Pan American Games were established and baseball was on the official program from the onset. In April 1953, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain came together to establish what is now known as the Confederation of European Baseball and organized the first ever European Baseball Championship a year later.

The Baseball Federation of Asia (BFA) was founded in May 1954 as the second continental confederation under the umbrella of FIBA. The BFA wasted little time in organizing its first continental tournament, as it celebrated the Asian Baseball Championship in December of that same year in Manila, Philippines.

The exposure of baseball to an international audience continued at the 1956 Summer Olympics, which saw approximately 114,000 spectators slowly fill the Melbourne Cricket Ground to witness Australia vs. US in a demonstration contest in Melbourne, Australia. This crowd of 114,000 was registered as a Guinness World Record for the largest attendance for any single baseball game. (The record lasted over 50 years before it was broken at a March 29, 2008 Major League Baseball exhibition game between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers that drew 115,300 people to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.)

Baseball as an Olympic demonstration sport was finally able to take its act to Asia at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, where baseball was already exceptionally popular. Following the 1968 Summer Olympics, a selection of premier U.S. college players defeated the Cuba national team twice in Mexico City to win the International Amateur Baseball Tournament (though it was not officially a demonstration sport).

Juan Isa expanded FIBA&#x27;s reach to include Europe, inviting the Netherlands and Italy to the Amateur World Series for the first time in 1970.

=== FEMBA split ===
Isa&#x27;s tenure as president was controversial. Some federations felt that power had been concentrated in the hands of the Latin American federations for too long, to the detriment of federations in Europe and North America. Tensions came to a head at the 1973 FIBA Congress, where the Congress suspended Nicaragua and awarded the 1973 Amateur World Series to Cuba; Isa also refused to call for new elections. As a result, 
Nicaraguan, Italian, and U.S. officials withdrew from FIBA, and instead formed formed the Federación Mundial de Béisbol Amateur (World Amateur Baseball Federation), also knowns as FEMBA. 

Other countries to join FEMBA included Argentina, Canada, Taiwan, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and South Africa. William &quot;Dutch&quot; Fehring was elected president, and Carlos García Solórzano vice president. The Caribbean federations — Venezuela, Panama, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Cuba, and the Dutch Antilles — remained with FIBA. The Baseball Federation of Cuba characterized the division as driven by Cold War political tensions. However, this was denied by Roger Panaye, president of the European Amateur Baseball Confederation (CEBA):

Under FEMBA, the first Intercontinental Cup was organized in 1973; another would follow in 1975. FEMBA also organized its own 1973 Amateur World Series in Nicaragua, to compete with the one being held by FIBA in Cuba.

Fehring, with the backing of MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, pushed International Olympic Committee head Lord Killanin to include baseball at the Olympics. However, Killanin told him it would not occur as long as baseball was represented by two different organizations.

The FEMBA-FIBA split was resolved in 1976 thanks to the mediation of Mexican Olympic Committee president Mario Vázquez Raña; FIBA was reorganized as AINBA (), with Manuel González Guerra elected president and Carlos García Solórzano vice president.

=== Baseball at the Summer Olympics ===
In 1978, the IOC awarded the hosting rights of the 1984 Summer Olympics to Los Angeles, and Robert Smith quickly went to work, in his capacity as a member of the United States Olympic Committee, to reestablish baseball as part of the Olympic Programme. Smith reached out to the then-Los Angeles Dodgers owner, Peter O&#x27;Malley, and University of Southern California head baseball coach and subsequent College Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, Rod Dedeaux. The group organized an IBAF congress the following year in Los Angeles in order to establish an Olympic Baseball Committee. Through these efforts, baseball was again categorized as a demonstration sport and an eight-team tournament was organized at Dodger Stadium, as part of the official Summer Olympic Programme. The present IBAF President, Riccardo Fraccari, was the head umpire of the championship game.

A third branch of the IBAF continental confederations formed in 1985. The Pan American Baseball Confederation (COPABE) was finally established after it was deemed necessary due to the strong expansion and increase of the national member federations stemming from the Olympic Baseball Committee campaign. 
In 1986, a historic IOC vote put baseball onto the Olympic Programme as a medal sport for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Baseball would travel to Seoul, Korea, for the 1988 Summer Olympics. This was the final time the IBAF, in conjunction with the IOC, would organize baseball as a demonstration (not medal) sport at the Olympics.

In 1989, the Baseball Confederation of Oceania (BCO) was established as the 4th branch of the IBAF. The African Baseball and Softball Association (ABSA) was formed in Lagos, Nigeria soon after, in June 1990.

Baseball was played up in a traditional amateur format up until the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. In 1998, the IBAF, MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association reached an agreement to allow the participation of professional players in international competition. The United States used a minor league selection to beat Cuba in the gold medal game at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Cuba regained the world title, defeating Australia for the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.

=== Setbacks and reformation ===
On July 7, 2005, the IOC Session voted to remove baseball and softball from the 2012 Summer Olympics program. Baseball made its last Olympic appearance and Korea took the gold medal at the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics.

The IBAF, under President Harvey Schiller, attempted to reinstate baseball onto the Olympic Programme, but the IOC vote of August 2009 kept baseball off the 2016 program, as golf and rugby were selected.

In February 2011, Dr. Harvey Schiller was appointed as a member of the IOC&#x27;s Women and Sport Commission.
On April 1, 2011, the IBAF, under first-year President Riccardo Fraccari, and the International Softball Federation announced that they were studying how to prepare a joint proposal in order to revive play of both sports at the 2020 Summer Olympics.
As part of that proposal, in April 2013, the two organizations began the process of merging into a new combined federation that will govern both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC).

The merging was concluded in 2015, and WBSC managed to obtain the bid for 2020 Games on following months.

==International events==

The International Baseball Federation organized the following world championship tournaments before WBSC merger:
*WBSC Premier 12
*World Baseball Classic
*IBAF Women&#x27;s Baseball World Cup
*IBAF 23U Baseball World Cup (formerly 21U)
*IBAF 18U Baseball World Cup
*IBAF 15U Baseball World Cup (formerly 16U)
*IBAF 12U Baseball World Cup

The first-ever 12U Baseball World Championship was played in Taipei from July 8 to 17, 2011. Taiwan won the first title.

In addition, the IBAF is the sanctioning body for the World Baseball Classic, which is hosted by Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association and held every four years in the year after the Summer Olympics. The IBAF abandoned its former world championship, the Baseball World Cup, after the 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic. It was originally intended to be the sanctioning body for the Premier 12, a new men&#x27;s international tournament – featuring the twelve best-ranked national teams – that began in 2015; that tournament instead has been sanctioned by the WBSC. This event is played in the year preceding the Summer Olympics.

The IBAF discontinued the Intercontinental Cup, which was an invitational event and last held in 2010.

==Organizational structure==

The IBAF comprises five continental confederations that currently represent a total of 127 national member federations.

* IBAF Africa: African Baseball &amp; Softball Association (ABSA) - 24 member countries

* IBAF Asia: Baseball Federation of Asia (BFA) - 24 member countries
* IBAF Europe: Confederation of European Baseball () (CEB) - 38 member countries
* IBAF Americas: Pan American Baseball Confederation () (COPABE) - 27 member countries

<doc id="1014007" wikidata="Q3777241" url="?curid=1014007" title="Brawl Brothers">
<text>Brawl Brothers, known in Japan as , is a side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up game developed and published by Jaleco for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. It is the second game in the &quot;Rushing Beat&quot; series, after &quot;Rival Turf!&quot;, and was followed by &quot;The Peace Keepers&quot; in 1993.

==Gameplay==
As in &quot;Final Fight&quot;, the player has to walk sideways and fight bad guys for several stages. Next to the general food-health supplies, the player can also pick up weapons like sticks, guns, grenades and such. A special &quot;Angry Mode&quot; gives injured fighters a burst of energy.

It is the only known SNES game that features its Japanese version on the same cartridge, accessible through use of a cheat code. The Japanese version of the game features different character names, no maze-like stages, an expanded ending sequence and the addition of a groin kick move for playable character Douglas Bild.

==Characters==
The player can choose from one of five characters, with American and Japanese version names:
*Hack / Rick Norton, the street brawler. Compared to &quot;Rival Turf!&quot;, Norton is more imposing and one of his throws is a deadly German suplex. He now wears bandages around his pants&#x27; lower legs to protect his shins. His boss stage is a platform surrounded by a steel cage.
*Slash / Douglas Bild, the police officer, who has gained more size as well and wears yellow boots that also go up to half his calf. He can no longer do a Frankensteiner, but his power bomb is much stronger. His alternate throw is an Atomic Drop from the back. In the Japanese version it is an Atomic Drop from the front, which is a direct shot to the groin, which was censored by Nintendo of America. His boss stage is a construction platform that is raised and lowered as the battle goes on.

The new characters aiding them are these:
*Lord J, the judo master, slow and lumbering but with powerful throws. His boss stage is a temple court;
*Kazan, the ninja, very quick and able to split himself in half to slash foes. His boss stage is a ninja dojo training room and has spikes on the floors which become walls as the room rotates;
*Wendy Milan, the professional wrestler, rather quick for the powerful moves she can execute. Her boss stage is a conventional wrestling ring whose ropes she can jump on to execute flying attacks.

In a one-player game, a &quot;partner&quot; will chosen for the player at random by the CPU. The remaining characters thereafter (or clones of them per the Japanese storyline) will be chosen as bosses for the first three levels. The remaining level ends with a battle against the final boss, Dieter/Iceman, a martial artist with an extendable and flexible staff.

==Reception==
&quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot; called it an &quot;outstanding beat&#x27; em up which suffers on a few minor accounts&quot; with an overall score of 84%. &quot;AllGame&quot; gave a rating of 3 out of 5 stars, praising the graphics, music, and addition of more enemies and moves than the original game. Criticism included the lack of speed, precision, and polish compared to games like &quot;Streets of Rage&quot;, &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. Power Unlimited gave a review score of 75% writing: &quot;Brawl Brothers graphics are excellent. They almost match the graphics of the arcade games of 1993. The gameplay may be a bit less, but it&#x27;s still a great game.&quot;

<doc id="1014008" wikidata="Q619057" url="?curid=1014008" title="Columbia Hills (Mars)">
<text>The Columbia Hills are a range of low hills inside Gusev crater on Mars. They were observed by the Mars Exploration Rover &quot;Spirit&quot; when it landed within the crater in 2004. They were promptly given an unofficial name by NASA since they were the most striking nearby feature on the surface. The hills lie approximately away from the rover&#x27;s original landing position. The range is named to memorialize the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. On February 2, 2004, the individual peaks of the Columbia Hills were named after the seven astronauts who died in the disaster. &quot;Spirit&quot; spent a few years exploring the Columbia Hills until it ceased to function in 2010. It was also considered a potential landing site for the Mars 2020 &quot;Perseverance&quot; rover, before the selection of Jezero crater in November 2018.

==Peaks==
The seven peaks are, from north to south:
* Anderson Hill - named after Michael P. Anderson
* Brown Hill - named after David M. Brown
* Chawla Hill - named after Kalpana Chawla
* Clark Hill - named after Laurel Clark
* Husband Hill - named after Rick Husband
* McCool Hill - named after William C. McCool
* Ramon Hill - named after Ilan Ramon

==Rocks and Minerals of Columbia Hills==

With the &quot;Spirit&quot; rover, scientists found a variety of rock types in the Columbia Hills, and they placed them into six different categories, each named after a prominent rock in the respective group: Clovis, Wishbone, Peace, Watchtower, Backstay, and Independence. Their chemical compositions, as measured by APXS, are significantly different from each other. Most importantly, all of the rocks in Columbia Hills show various degrees of alteration by aqueous fluids.
They are enriched in the elements phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and bromine—all of which can be carried around in water solutions. The Columbia Hills’ rocks contain basaltic glass, along with varying amounts of olivine and sulfates.
The olivine abundance varies inversely with the amount of sulfates. This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but helps to produce sulfates.

Acid fog is believed to have changed some of the Watchtower rocks. This was in a 200 meter long section of Cumberland Ridge and the Husband Hill summit. Certain places became less crystalline and more amorphous. Acidic water vapor from volcanoes dissolved some minerals forming a gel. When water evaporated a cement formed and produced small bumps. This type of process has been observed in the lab when basalt rocks are exposed to sulfuric and hydrochloric acids.

The Clovis group is especially interesting because the Mössbauer spectrometer (MB) detected goethite in it. Goethite forms only in the presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of past water in the Columbia Hills&#x27;s rocks. In addition, the MB spectra of rocks and outcrops displayed a strong decline in olivine presence, although the rocks probably once contained much olivine. Olivine is a marker for the lack of water because it easily decomposes in the presence of water. Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form.

Wishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and anhydrite (a calcium sulfate). Peace rocks showed sulfur and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine, implying that they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite, a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.

One type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, phosphorus, calcium, and iron.
Also, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe+++ form, which would happen if water had been present.

Towards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure silica were found in the soil. The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.

After &quot;Spirit&quot; stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) and confirmed the presence of large amounts of carbonate-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water. The carbonates were discovered in an outcrop of rocks called &quot;Comanche.&quot;

<text>The International Campaign Against Aggression on Iraq (ICAAI) was a campaign umbrella group launched in Cairo 2003, at the Cairo Anti-war Conference, to oppose the invasion of Iraq.

The ICAAI sought to co-ordinate the February 15th global day of action against the Iraq war, which became the largest day of demonstrations in history, involving up to 25 million people in 150 countries.

The ICAAI&#x27;s president was Ahmed Ben Bella and its vice-president was John Rees.

<doc id="1014025" wikidata="Q4930153" url="?curid=1014025" title="Blue roof">
<text>A blue roof is a roof of a building that is designed explicitly to provide initial temporary water storage and then gradual release of stored water, typically rainfall. Blue roofs are constructed on flat or low sloped roofs in urban communities where flooding is a risk due to a lack of permeable surfaces for water to infiltrate, or seep back into the ground. 

Water is stored in blue roof systems until it either evaporates or is released downstream after the storm event has passed. Blue roofs that are used for temporary rooftop storage can be classified as &quot;active&quot; or &quot;passive&quot; depending on the types of control devices used to regulate drainage of water from the roof. Blue roofs can provide a number of benefits depending on design. These benefits include temporary storage of rainfall to mitigate runoff impacts, storage for reuse such as irrigation or cooling water makeup, or recreational opportunities.

== Stormwater management and other benefits ==
=== Flood mitigation ===
Due to the density of urban development, there is a general lack of permeable surfaces in cities. This lack of area for stormwater to infiltrate back into the ground leaves cities vulnerable to flooding. 

A number of blue roof pilot projects have been implemented around the United States, the results from which highlight their efficacy in reducing stormwater runoff during and after severe weather events.

=== Pollution reduction ===

While blue roofs do not remove pollutants from water by temporarily detaining it, they do reduce the load severe rain events place on storm sewers which stops emergency overflow from combined sewer systems from discharging untreated wastewater into rivers, streams, and coastal waters. 

A significant blue roof pilot project intended to evaluate the potential of the systems for mitigating combined sewer overflow impacts was conducted between 2010 and 2012 by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. The NYCDEP blue-roof projects are the first to utilize a novel passive blue roof tray design which relies on the lateral transitivity of non-woven filter fabric for drawdown control in a full scale pilot. Monitoring of these systems has demonstrated their performance as an effective means for mitigation of peak flows and alteration of timing in combined sewer systems.

=== Water scarcity ===
On the opposite side of the spectrum, cities with limited rainfall are vulnerable to drought and extended periods of restricted water usage. In drier climates, blue roofs act as a water conservation tool harvesting the water that falls on a roof&#x27;s surface and collecting it at a controlled rate.

=== Design compatibility ===
Another major benefit of blue roofs are their ability to work alongside other rooftop systems such as solar panels (both solar thermal and pv), and HVAC mechanical equipment. 

Some recreational blue roofs integrate rooftop waterplay areas that can also be used to irrigate a green roof, or to cool the roof of a building on hot days, in order to eliminate or at least reduce the HVAC load placed on mechanical refrigeration equipment.

Some blue roofs utilize stored water for beneficial on-site purposes cooling of solar panels and irrigation of a green roof. One example of a blue roof that provide ancillary services was the winning entry (First Place, 10,000 Euro prize) in the 2004 Coram Sustainable Design Award, by Steve Mann.

== Types ==

=== Active blue roof ===
Active blue roof systems control the rate at which water drains from a rooftop through mechanical means. Sometimes referred to as &quot;automated roof runoff management systems,&quot; active blue roofs use valve configurations and controls to monitor and regulate the discharge of stormwater runoff from roofs. Water ponded on the roof can be released in several ways, including via a pneumatically or hydraulically actuated pinch valve, an electronically controlled valve connected to a timer, or manually opening the valve. Active blue roofs for stormwater detention using forecast integration were first proposed in 2008. 

=== Passive blue roof ===
Passive blue roof systems control the rate at which water drains from a rooftop through non-mechanical means. Unlike active systems which inhibit water flow through drainage pipes, passive systems temporarily detain water on the surface of the roof by lengthening the path the water must take in order to reach outlet drains. Blue roofs can include open water surfaces, storage within or beneath a porous media or modular surface, or below a raised decking surface or cover. 

* Roof-integrated passive blue roof designs are built to retain water directly on a roof&#x27;s surface, protected by a waterproof membrane, for extended periods of time. This ponding of water can be done either within a porous media, such as gravel, or free standing on the roof surface. The release rate of the stored water is controlled by weirs on the roof drain. Roof-integrated designs are most effective in new construction as achievable storage volume on existing flat roofs is often quite limited. 
*Modular tray designs allow existing roofs to be retrofitted for stormwater retention capabilities with the addition of plastic or metal trays. Similarly to roof-integrated designs, water collected in the trays can either be ponded within a porous media or free standing within the tray. Modular tray blue roofs allow for more flexibility in the size and location of detention areas on a rooftop than a roof-integrated design. This selective placement of trays makes avoiding roof areas which cannot support the additional structural load, as well as any roof obstructions easier than other blue roof designs. Trays also have the added advantage of not using the roof material itself as a component of the detention structure and thus decrease instead of increase the hydraulic head on the underlying roofing membrane. As the water drains from the trays, it is released onto the roof surface itself and drains normally. 
*Roof-dams or roof-checks physically interrupt the flow path of the water as it travels towards the roof drain. Similar to roof-integrated designs, the roof surface is the primary location of water detention with these impermeable or slow-releasing dams forcing water to pond behind them. The height of the dam and the size of weep holes can be used to control the detention time of the structures.
*Blue-green roof designs are aesthetically similar to green roofs in that they are vegetative roofs, but functionally different in that they have additional water storage capacity beneath the growing media to facilitate in stormwater retention.

=== Blue colored roof ===
A different type of &quot;blue roof&quot; has been proposed by researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who researched a pigment used by the ancient Egyptians known as &quot;Egyptian blue.&quot; This color, derived from calcium copper silicate, absorbs visible light, and emits light in the near-infrared range, helping keep roofs and walls cool.

<doc id="1014031" wikidata="Q1233864" url="?curid=1014031" title="Doctor Occult">
<text>Doctor Occult (Richard Occult, sometimes nicknamed the Ghost Detective, and one time referred to as Doctor Mystic) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster (the creators of Superman), Doctor Occult is an occult detective, private investigator and magic user who specializes in cases involving the supernatural. Doctor Occult first appeared in 1935 during the Platinum Age of Comic Books. He was published by National Comics Publications and Centaur Publications within anthology titles. He is the earliest recurring, originally featured fictional character still used in the DC Universe. He is sometimes affiliated with the All-Star Squadron and has appeared in paranormal-related stories by DC and Vertigo Comics titles.

==Publication history==
===Mainstream version===
====Golden Age titles====
Doctor Occult first appeared in the sixth issue of the anthology comic books series &quot;New Fun&quot; in October 1935. (New Fun was retitled &quot;More Fun&quot; beginning with issue #7 and again to &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; with issue #20.) The character was credited to &quot;Leger and Reuths&quot; — partial anagrams of Siegel and Shuster&#x27;s surnames. Later, Siegel and Shuster left the character for the more popular Superman.

Occult was depicted as a supernatural detective whose detecting style was in the style of Sam Spade, but with supernatural abilities. Supporting characters in the strip included Rose Psychic and Occult&#x27;s butler. Writers such as Les Daniels have cited the character as a prototype of Superman.

Renamed to &quot;Dr. Mystic&quot;, Occult also appeared in Centaur Publications&#x27; &quot;The Comics Magazine&quot; #1 (May 1936), with that story continuing in DC&#x27;s &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #14-17. In this story, he travels to a mystic realm where he flies and wears a cape, making him the first caped comic book superhero. Doctor Occult&#x27;s last Golden Age appearance was in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #32 in 1938.

====Bronze Age revival====
After years of obscurity, the character was revived in the 1980s, appearing in issues of &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;, &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, and &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

====Modern Age revivals====
The character had a featured origin story in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; #17 (1987). He later appeared in comics such as Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; (1991), &quot;The Trenchcoat Brigade&quot; (alongside Mister E, the Phantom Stranger, and John Constantine) (1999), and &quot;Day of Judgement&quot; (1999) as part of the Sentinels of Magic.

===Reboot===
In The New 52 continuity reboot, Doctor Occult appears in &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;, &quot;Constantine&quot;, &quot;Secret Six&quot;, and &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; series.

=== Other versions ===
Doctor Occult appears in comic books outside of the mainstream DC Universe in what is referred to as the multiverse. Many are adaptation tie-ins, including &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; (vol. 1) #14, &quot;&quot; #9, and &quot;&quot; #1.

Occult also appears in issue #2 of the Elseworlds comic series &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations II&quot;.

== Fictional character biography ==
The fictional character&#x27;s origin was revealed in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2) #17. (August 1987) by E. Nelson Bridewell and Roy Thomas. They depicted him and his partner Rose Psychic being slated as human sacrifices at the hands of a demonic cult, but were rescued by a shadowy group called &quot;The Seven&quot;. The two were later trained in the use of occult magics themselves. Thirty-six years later, Doctor Occult establishes a detective agency and joins the All-Star Squadron during World War II. After Occult sacrifices his soul to defeat the Stalker, Rose fuses with him to save his life. Occult has used sorcery to halt his aging, causing him to appear middle-aged despite being born in the late 1800s.

In 1991, Occult appeared in &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;, written by Neil Gaiman. He, Mister E, the Phantom Stranger, and John Constantine mentor Timothy Hunter and guide him to become a powerful magician.

In &quot;Day of Judgment&quot;, Occult joins the Sentinels of Magic, a group created to prevent artifacts such as the Spear of Destiny from falling into the wrong hands.

Occult appears as a main character in &quot;Reign in Hell&quot;, where he enters Hell to find Rose Psychic.

In The New 52, Occult is depicted as the keeper of the House of Secrets. In the DC All In series &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; (vol. 2), he joins the expanded Justice League.

== Powers and abilities ==
Doctor Occult has the powers of astral projection, hypnosis, illusion creating, and telekinesis. He wields a powerful talisman, a sphere or disc with a black and white pattern, called the Mystic Symbol of the Seven. It grants him the powers of clairvoyance, exorcism, deflection, and force field projection.

==In other media==
* Doctor Occult appears as a non-playable character in &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;.
* Doctor Occult appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

==Reception==
Bill Reed of Comic Book Resources praised the character saying that DC Comics could portray more of him despite him not having the staying power as other supernatural heroes such as Phantom Stranger or John Constantine.

<text>The 1790s BC was a decade lasting from January 1, 1799 BC to December 31, 1790 BC. During this decade, the Near East was in the midst of the Middle Bronze Age.

Going by the middle chronology, the Babylonian Empire saw the death of its king, Sin-Muballit in c. 1792 BC. He was succeeded by Hammurabi, who would go on to compose the Code of Hammurabi, the best-preserved legal text from the ancient Near East. Shamshi-Adad I, king of Assyria, continued his conquests, defeating Yahdun-Lim of Mari.

The Middle Kingdom of Egypt was ruled by the Thirteenth Dynasty at this time. The chronology of Pharaohs during this decade is uncertain, but Sonbef, Sekhemkare, Ameny Qemau, and Hotepibre have been suggested to rule during this decade.

The Cemetery H culture had developed by this time in northern India: distinguishing features of this culture include the use of cremation of human remains, reddish pottery, apparent breakdown of widespread trade, and rice farming. In China, the semi-legendary Xia Dynasty was the dominant political force, and was possibly ruled by Jin of Xia at this time.

Manning (2008) tentatively estimates the world population in 1799 BC as 85 million.

<text>The 20th Century Limited was an express passenger train on the New York Central Railroad (NYC) from 1902 to 1967. The train traveled between Grand Central Terminal in New York City and LaSalle Street Station in Chicago, Illinois, along the railroad&#x27;s &quot;Water Level Route&quot;.

NYC inaugurated the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; as competition to the Pennsylvania Railroad, aimed at upper-class and business travelers. It made few station stops along the way and used track pans to take water at speed. On June15, 1938, streamlined train sets designed by Henry Dreyfuss were added to the route.

Widely considered to be one of the greatest American passenger trains of all time, the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; was the flagship train of the New York Central and was advertised as &quot;The Most Famous Train in the World&quot;. It was described in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as having been &quot;[...] known to railroad buffs for 65 years as the world&#x27;s greatest train&quot;, and its style was described as &quot;spectacularly understated&quot;. The phrase &quot;red-carpet treatment&quot; is derived from passengers&#x27; walking to the train on a specially-designed crimson carpet.

==History==
===Early history===
The &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; first ran on June15, 1902. It completed its run from New York to Chicago in 20hours, four hours less than previous trains, and arrived three minutes ahead of schedule. It offered a barbershop and secretarial services. The &quot;New York Times&quot;″ report stressed the routine nature of the trip, with no special procedures being followed and no extra efforts being made to break records. It said that there &quot;was no excitement along the way,&quot; and quoted a railroad official&#x27;s claim: &quot;it is a perfectly practical run and will be continued.&quot; Engineer William Gates said, &quot;This schedule can be made without any difficulty. I can do it every time, barring accidents.&quot;

The schedule cut two more hours off the run in June 1905, and, on the 21st of that month, the train was intentionally derailed on the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway line at Mentor, Ohio, killing 21 passengers. It reverted to 20 hours in 1912 and was unchanged until 1932. In 1935, it dropped to 16hours, 30minutes; then to 16hours on June15, 1938, when lightweight cars were implemented.

The engine change point was moved to Croton–Harmon station in 1913, when the NYC line was electrified south of that point.

In the 1920s, the New York-Chicago fare was $32.70 plus the extra fare of $9.60, plus the Pullman charge (e.g. $9 for a lower berth), for a total of $51.30, equal to $ today. This fare entitled a passenger to a bed closed off from the aisle by curtains; a compartment to oneself cost more. In 1928, the peak year, the train earned revenue of $10million and was believed to be the most profitable train in the world.

The cars of the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; were lit with fluorescent lamps soon after their introduction, which coincided with the introduction of the new Art Deco train sets on June15, 1938.

===New train sets===
In 1938, industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss was commissioned by the New York Central to design streamlined train sets in Art Deco style, with the locomotive and passenger cars rendered in blues and grays (the colors of NYC). The streamlined sets were inaugurated on June 15, 1938. His design was probably the most famous American passenger train. The first new &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; train left New York City at 18:00 Eastern Time and arrived at Chicago&#x27;s La Salle Street Station the following morning at 09:00 Central Time, traveling the at an average . The eastbound train left La Salle Street Station in Chicago at 15:00 and arrived at Grand Central Terminal the following morning at 08:00. For a few years after World War II, the eastward schedule was shortened to 15½ hours.

In 1945, EMD diesel-electrics replaced steam, and two new diesel-electric-powered trainsets were commissioned. The replacement was inaugurated by General Dwight D. Eisenhower in September, 1948. This set was featured in postwar films such as &quot;North by Northwest&quot; and &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;.

Like many express passenger trains through the mid-1960s, the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; carried an East Division (E.D.) Railway Post Office (R.P.O.) car operated by the Railway Mail Service (RMS) of the United States Post Office Department which was staffed by USPOD clerks as a &quot;fast mail&quot; on each of its daily runs. The mails received by, postmarked, processed, sorted and dispatched from the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; RPOs were either canceled or backstamped (as appropriate) during the trip by hand-applied circular date stamps (CDS) reading &quot;N.Y. &amp; CHI. R.P.O. E.D. 20TH CEN.LTD.&quot; and the train&#x27;s number: &quot;25&quot; (NY–CHI) or &quot;26&quot; (CHI–NY).

For much of its history before 1957, the all-Pullman train made station stops only at Grand Central Terminal and Harmon for New York–area passengers and LaSalle Street Station and Englewood for Chicago-area passengers. These traveled in as many as seven sections (each was a separate, complete train), of which the first was named the Advance 20th Century Limited. In 1957, the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; schedule added more station stops to the original four (two terminals and two suburban stops). In the 1960s, the NYC added slumbercoaches to the roster of sleeping cars.

===Demise===
By the late 1960s, the train was in decline. On December2, 1967 at 18:00, the half-full train left Grand Central Terminal&#x27;s Track34 for the last time. As always, carnations were given to men and perfume and flowers to women boarding the train. The next day, it arrived at LaSalle Street Station in Chicago 9hours 50minutes late due to a freight derailment near Conneaut, Ohio, which forced a slow rerouting over the parallel Nickel Plate railroad freight line.

===Present day===
Amtrak now operates the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; between New York Penn Station and Chicago Union Station. It follows a route similar to the &quot;20th Century&#x27;s&quot;, except west of Whiting, Indiana (near Chicago), where it switches to the former Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway.

On August26, 1999, the United States Postal Service issued 33-cent &quot;All Aboard! 20th Century American Trains&quot; commemorative stamps featuring five celebrated American passenger trains from the 1930s and 1940s. One of the five stamps features an image of a streamlined J-3a steam locomotive leading the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; out of the Chicago railyards on its way to New York, with the Board of Trade Building in the background.

Several 20th Century Limited traincars and its red carpet were included in the Grand Central Centennial Parade of Trains, part of the terminal centennial celebration in 2013.

In 2023, two of the restored traincars, Hickory Creek and Tavern-Lounge No. 43, were offered for Spring and Fall day trip excursions between New York City and Albany, New York while attached to the rear of an Amtrak Empire Service train. In September, a special trip from New York to Chicago and back was offered. All 2023 tickets were sold.

In December 2024, the &quot;Hickory Creek&quot; was part of MTA Metro North&#x27;s Employee Holiday Train.

==Legacy==
The &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; was advertised as &quot;The Most Famous Train in the World&quot;. In the year of its last run, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that it &quot;...was known to railroad buffs for 65 years as the world&#x27;s greatest train&quot;. Its style was described as &quot;spectacularly understated ... suggesting exclusivity and sophistication&quot;. Passengers walked to the train in New York and Chicago on a specially designed crimson carpet, giving rise to the phrase &quot;the red-carpet treatment&quot;. &quot;Transportation historians&quot;, said the writers of &quot;The Art of the Streamliner&quot;, &quot;consistently rate the 1938edition of the &quot;Century&quot; to be the world&#x27;s ultimate passenger conveyance—at least on the ground&quot;.

In 1926, Lucille Ball made her first trip to California from New York on the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot;.

On 15 October 1942 after a meeting in Chicago on the Manhattan Project General Leslie Groves invited J. Robert Oppenheimer to join himself, James C. Marshall and Kenneth Nichols on their return trip to New York. After dinner on the train they discussed the project while squeezed into Nichol’s one-person roomette (of about 40&quot; by 80&quot; or 1m by 2m). Shortly afterwards Oppenheimer was appointed to head the Los Alamos Laboratory. 

Regular passengers included Theodore Roosevelt, William Jennings Bryan, Lillian Russell, &quot;Diamond Jim&quot; Brady, J. P. Morgan, Enrico Caruso and Nellie Melba.

===In fiction===
The &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; was the setting for a Broadway musical composed by Cy Coleman and written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green entitled &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot;, about the romantic complications of a beautiful actress and an egocentric producer/director. Madeline Kahn and John Cullum starred in the award-winning production (five Tony Awards out of nine nominations), whose spectacular production design featured both the lavish Art Deco details of the time period as well innovative staging to open up what could be cramped quarters inside a train car. The musical was based on the 1932 Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur stage play of the same subject, which in 1934 they adapted as a film entitled &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;, directed by Howard Hawks, with Carole Lombard and John Barrymore in the lead roles. The train also figured prominently as a setting for major scenes in both Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot; and George Roy Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Sting&quot; (which incorrectly had the train arrive in Chicago at night, not in the morning as it did in reality).

While doing research for her novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, Ayn Rand learned the operation of the train and subsequently devised a fictional company– the &quot;Twentieth Century Motor Company&quot;– which would be important to the novel&#x27;s plot.

The &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; is frequently referenced as a main means of train transportation of the fictional Van Dorn detective Isaac Bell in several Clive Cussler period books featuring the early 1900s detective. The Wrecker (Clive Cussler with Justin Scott) is the second in the long-running series and has Bell with other Van Dorn detectives riding the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; often as they pursue a train-wrecking villain.

===Other namesakes===
The &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; was also the inspiration for several cultural works. A recipe for the 20th Century cocktail was published in the &quot;Cafe Royal Bar Book&quot; in 1937.

<text>The Sylva () is a river in Sverdlovsk Oblast and Perm Krai in Russia. It is in length. The area of the basin is . The Sylva flows into the Chusovoy Cove of the Kama Reservoir. It freezes up in November and stays under the ice until April. Principal tributaries: Iren, Babka, Irgina, Vogulka (left); Barda, Shakva (right). Main port: Kungur.

Every year hundreds of tourists come to Kungur, through routes down the Sylva, Iren and Shakva rivers. The Sylva River flows leisurely over a flat plateau, across Preduraliye Nature Preserve, and past abrupt cliffs, fossilized remnants of coral reefs left by the long-disappeared Great Permian Sea, which at some places rise up to above the level of the river, covered with pine and fir groves.

===Early life in Arkansas and Houston===
George W. Thomas Jr. was the second of thirteen children born to Fanny ( Bradley) and George W. Thomas. He was born in Plum Bayou Township, just outside the Delta town of Pine Bluff, Arkansas. In the late 1890s the family moved to Houston, Texas, where George W. Thomas Sr. became a deacon at the Shiloh Baptist Church.

George Jr. played piano, cornet and saxophone from an early age, and worked as a pianist in local theaters. His daughter Hociel was born in 1904; his wife died a few years later, and Hociel was largely raised by her grandmother and her aunt Beulah, later known as Sippie Wallace, who was George Jr.&#x27;s sister. Singer Bernice Edwards was also raised as a member of the Thomas family. Around 1910, George W. Thomas Jr. formed a friendship with Clarence Williams, who was also working in the Houston theaters; they may have also met Jelly Roll Morton around this time.

===New Orleans===
By 1914, Williams and Thomas both began working in New Orleans, where they set up a publishing company to issue and promote compositions and arrangements by Williams and, later, Thomas. George Thomas played at parties, becoming known as &quot;Gut Bucket George&quot;. In 1916, he published &quot;The New Orleans Hop Scop Blues&quot;, a twelve-bar blues that included &quot;an articulated left hand... notated using grace notes for the lower tone [which] created a pseudo boogie bass.&quot; This is credited as one of the earliest boogie woogie piano pieces, and established Thomas as a music publisher and composer.

Some of his pieces were played in the Storyville area of New Orleans by his young brother Hersal Thomas, who had joined him in the city and performed with local musicians including King Oliver and his protégé Louis Armstrong. Among George Thomas&#x27; compositions was &quot;Muscle Shoals Blues&quot;, written in New Orleans but not published until later. The tune was recorded as a piano roll by James P. Johnson, and on disc by Fats Waller.

===Chicago===
After his father&#x27;s death in 1917, Thomas became the effective head of the family. Following the closedown of the Storyville area of New Orleans, he moved to Chicago in 1920, and was joined there by his sister Beulah &quot;Sippie&quot; Wallace, who also became a performer, and by his brother Hersal, though his mother remained in Houston until her death. By now the sole proprietor of his publishing company, Thomas reissued some of his earlier compositions and also played with local groups and accompanied singers, including Sippie. In all he was credited with over 100 compositions.

In 1922, he published &quot;The Fives&quot;, co-written with brother Hersal, and inspired by a train traveling between Chicago and San Francisco. This was &quot;the first published boogie-woogie with a boogie bass line throughout,&quot; and &quot;helped to inspire a generation of boogie-woogie pianists&quot; such as Meade Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons. The following year, he is widely credited with recording another of his compositions, &quot;The Rocks&quot;, for Okeh Records, which contains the earliest recording of a walking bass. The recording was credited to Clay Custer, generally regarded as a pseudonym, but there is some disagreement over whether the performer was Thomas himself, or another pianist, possibly Hersal Thomas or Harry Jentes.

In Chicago, George Thomas also recorded as an accompanist for Tiny Franklin on Gennett Records, and had his own jazz group, the Muscle Shoals Devils, who made recordings that were not released. Thomas was respected as a composer, and was quoted in the &quot;Music Trade Review&quot; in 1924:The world wants dancing music, and, tunefulness apart, wants something not reminiscent of hundreds of dances that have gone before... It is a waste of energy for the composer or publisher to plagiarize a winner. The music buying public is too wise today. And people who love to dance, even if they do not play music, are quick to appreciate novelty in melody and theme in a new song. George Thomas continued to publish compositions after his brother Hersal&#x27;s sudden death, aged 19 in June 1926, but his output diminished in the late 1920s. His last recordings were with singer Lillian Miller for Gennett in 1928.

===Death===
Although in her later years Sippie Wallace claimed that George Thomas had died in about 1930 as a result of an accident involving a streetcar, official records including his death certificate state that he died in Chicago in 1937, from breaking his back falling down stairs, possibly after a fire had broken out. He was buried at Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.

<text>Jaishankar Prasad (30 January 1889 15 November 1937) was a prominent figure in modern Hindi literature as well as Hindi theatre. Prasad was his pen name. He was also known as &quot;Chhayavadi kavi&quot;.

==Poetic style==

Prasad started writing poetry with the pen name of ‘Kamayani’. The first collection of poem that Prasad penned, named, Chitradhar, was written in Braj dialect of Hindi but his later works were written in Khadi dialect or Sanskritized Hindi.

Later on Prasad promulgated ‘Chhayavad’, a literary trend in Hindi literature.

He is considered one of the Four Pillars (&quot;Char Stambh&quot;) of Romanticism in Hindi Literature (Chhayavad), along with Sumitranandan Pant, Mahadevi Verma, and Suryakant Tripathi &#x27;Nirala&#x27;.

His vocabulary avoids the Persian element of Hindi and mainly consists of Sanskrit (Tatsama) words and words derived from Sanskrit (Tadbhava words). The subject of his poetry spans the entire horizon of subjects of his era, from romantic to nationalistic.

==Dramas and other writings==
His dramas are considered to be most pioneering ones in Hindi. Prasad&#x27;s most famous dramas include &quot;Skanda gupta&quot;,&quot;Chandra gupta&quot; and &quot;Dhruva swamini&quot; .
Many children like him as he gives us a knowledge about Ancient times.

The majority of them revolve around historical stories of Ancient India. Some of them were also based on mythological plots.

In 1960s, Shanta Gandhi Professor of Ancient Indian Drama while at National School of Drama, revived interest in Jaishankar Prasad&#x27;s plays for modern Indian theatre, by successfully staging his most important play &quot;Skanda Gupta&quot; written in 1928, with little changes to the original script.

== Legacy ==

===Neo-romanticism in Hindi Literature===
Jaishankar Prasad&#x27;s Kamayani (Hindi: कामायनी) (1936), a Hindi classic poem is considered as an important magnum opus of this school. The poem belongs to the Chhayavadi school of Hindi poetry.

== Critical reception ==
In her glowing tribute to Jai Shankar Prasad, the poet- critic Mahadevi Verma said:

&quot;Whenever I remember our great poet, Prasad a particular image comes to my mind. A fir tree stands on the slope of the Himalaya, straight and tall as the proud mountain peaks themselves. Its lofty head braves the assaults of the snow, the rain, and the blazing heat of the sun. Violent storms shake its spreading branches, while a thin stream of water plays hide-and-seek amongst its root. Even under the most heavy snowfall, the most fierce heat, and the torrential rain, the fir tree holds its head high. Even in the midst of the worst thunderstorm and blizzards, it remains steady and unflinching.”

Regarding his influence in Indian literature, the late scholar David Rubin wrote in &quot;The Return of Sarasvati&quot; (Oxford, 1993):- &quot;To Jayshankar Prasad belongs the credit of making the first successful leap forward in the development of a genuine poetic art in &quot;khari boli&quot; Hindi and giving it, in &quot;Ansu&quot;, its first masterpiece.&quot; Rubin felt his lyrics regarding nature and human love helped to define the &quot;Chhayavad&quot; movement, and that his reflective nature and deep love of reading and music heavily influenced his work.

<doc id="1014060" wikidata="Q923467" url="?curid=1014060" title="Songs of Love and Hate">
<text>Songs of Love and Hate is the third studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen. Produced by Bob Johnston, the album was released on March 19, 1971, through Columbia Records.

==Recording and composition==

Cohen reunited with producer Bob Johnston, who was at the helm for the singer&#x27;s previous album &quot;Songs From a Room&quot;, and also brought back guitarist Ron Cornelius, who acted as leader of Cohen&#x27;s new crew of backing musicians, christened The Army. The album was mainly recorded in Columbia Studio A in Nashville, between September 22 and 26, 1970. &quot;Sing Another Song, Boys&quot; was recorded at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 30, 1970. Further recording took place at Trident Studios in London. The album title is descriptive, outlining its main themes; it features several of Cohen&#x27;s most famous compositions, including &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, &quot;Avalanche&quot;, and &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot;. In the 1996 book &quot;Various Positions&quot;, Cohen biographer Ira Nadel confirms that many of the songs were from an earlier period, with &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; having been written at the Chelsea Hotel in New York; &quot;Avalanche&quot; and &quot;Dress Rehearsal Rag&quot; dated from earlier years; and &quot;Love Calls You by Your Name&quot; was a minor rewrite of an unpublished 1967 song called &quot;Love Tries to Call You by Your Name&quot;. In 1991, Cohen revealed to &quot;Throat Culture&quot; magazine that the recording of his third album had been a difficult time for him because &quot;absolutely everything was beginning to fall apart around me: my spirit, my intentions, my will. So I went into a deep and long depression.&quot;

&quot;Joan of Arc&quot; is constructed mainly as a dialogue between Joan of Arc and the fire which is consuming her as she burns at the stake, after having been found guilty of heresy (in 1431). In the song, Joan says that she is &quot;tired of the war&quot; and tells how she would rather be wearing a white wedding dress (one of the charges against her was that she dressed as a man). Joan&#x27;s surrender to the fire, as its bride, may also be seen as a symbol of her religious fervour and commitment. In a 1988 interview with John McKenna of RTÉ, Cohen said of &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, &quot;I was thinking more of this sense of a destiny that human beings have and how they meet and marry their destiny...I don&#x27;t want to suggest in that song that what she really wanted to be was a housewife. What I mean to say is that as lonely and as solitudinous as she was she had to meet and be embraced by her destiny...seen from the point of view of the woman&#x27;s movement she really does stand for something stunningly original and courageous.&quot; 

In his 2010 book &quot;Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life&quot;, biographer Anthony Reynolds quotes Cohen explaining that &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; is about &quot;A man writing a letter to a man who has had an affair with his wife&quot;, but, on a more prosaic level, Cohen is also quoted saying that the tune is related to his own attire: &quot;I had a blue raincoat. It was Burberry. It had lots of various fixtures on it...It always resided in my memory as some glamorous possibility that I never realized...&quot; In the book &quot;Songwriters on Songwriting&quot;, Cohen confessed to being unsatisfied with the composition: &quot;That was one I thought was never finished. And I thought that Jennifer Warnes&#x27; version in a sense was better because I worked on a different version for her, and I thought it was somewhat more coherent. But I always thought that that was a song you could see the carpentry in a bit. Although there are some images in it that I am very pleased with. And the tune is real good. But I&#x27;m willing to defend it, saying it was impressionistic. It’s stylistically coherent. And I can defend it if I have to. But secretly I always felt that there was a certain incoherence that prevented it from being a great song.&quot;

In the same interview, Cohen revealed that his &quot;chop&quot;, his unique pattern of playing syncopated classical guitar, is especially evident on &quot;Avalanche&quot;, and also asserted, &quot;There are songs like &#x27;Dress Rehearsal Rag&#x27; that I recorded once and I will never sing. Judy Collins did a very beautiful version of it, better than mine. I would never do that song in concert; I can&#x27;t get behind it.&quot; In the liner notes to the 1975 album &quot;The Best of Leonard Cohen&quot;, Cohen wrote of &quot;Last Year&#x27;s Man&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why but I like this song. I used to play it on a Mexican twelve-string until I destroyed the instrument by jumping on it in a fit of impotent fury in 1967. The song had too many verses and it took about five years to sort out the right ones.&quot;

In an interview with Alastair Pirrie of the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; in March 1973 - just two years after the album was released - Cohen disparaged the LP: &quot;I suppose you could call it gimmicky if you were feeling uncharitable towards me. I have certainly felt uncharitable towards me from time to time over that record, and regretted many things. It was over-produced and over elaborated...an experiment that failed.&quot; 

Several of the songs from &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot; would be featured on Cohen&#x27;s 1972 European tour, a trek that would be documented in Tony Palmer&#x27;s 1974 documentary &quot;Bird on the Wire&quot;. With the exception of &quot;Last Year&#x27;s Man&quot;, Cohen performed every song live (he had played &quot;Dress Rehearsal Rag&quot; in concert two years before &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot; was released).

==Artwork==
The front of the album sleeve is a sparsely detailed black-and-white photo of Cohen, smiling, with several days&#x27; beard growth. The back cover has no track listing, and quotes Cohen&#x27;s short poem &quot;They Locked Up A Man&quot;:

:&quot;They locked up a man&quot;
:&quot;Who wanted to rule the world&quot;
:&quot;The fools&quot;
:&quot;They locked up the wrong man&quot;

==Reception==
The album reached no. 145 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but was his most commercially successful album in many other parts of the world, reaching no. 4 in the UK and no. 8 in Australia. Writing in 2011, Cohen biographer Anthony Reynolds noted, &quot;In some quarters it was the album that seemed to seal Cohen&#x27;s reputation as being something of a downer, to say the least.&quot; In his review of the 2007 reissue release, Tim Nelson of BBC Music stated that Cohen&#x27;s third LP &quot;is perhaps less varied than the first two albums, but the focus is more intense and the sequencing superb. Be warned though: this is one of the scariest albums of the last forty years...&quot;. Mark Deming of AllMusic calls &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot; &quot;one of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s most emotionally intense albums - which, given the nature of Cohen&#x27;s body of work, is no small statement.&quot; In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album no. 295 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, being the only Cohen album to make the list until &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; reached No. 195 on the 2020 reissue, an edition the album failed to make. It was ranked no. 74 on &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot;&#x27;s 2004 list of the 100 best albums of the 1970s. &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; was voted No. 3 in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers poll of the top ten greatest Leonard Cohen songs. It was voted number 500 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

A remastered CD was released in 1995. Simply Vinyl issued a short-lived remastered edition on vinyl in 2002, making it the last Cohen album (aside from &quot;Ten New Songs&quot;, which was pressed in limited quantities) to go out of print on vinyl. In 2007, Columbia/Legacy released a newly remastered CD with a new book style packaging and a bonus track: a 1968 recording of &quot;Dress Rehearsal Rag&quot;. In 2009, the album (including its bonus track) was included in the 8-CD box set &quot;Hallelujah—The Essential Leonard Cohen Album Collection&quot;, issued by Sony Music in the Netherlands.

==Cover versions==

Judy Collins recorded &quot;Dress Rehearsal Rag&quot; in 1966 on the album &quot;In My Life&quot;, years before it would appear on &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot;. The Art Of Time Ensemble featuring Sarah Slean recorded &quot;Dress Rehearsal Rag&quot; for their 2009 album &quot;Black Flowers&quot;. Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds recorded a version of &quot;Avalanche&quot; for their 1984 album &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot;, as did Ghost for the deluxe edition of their 2018 album &quot;Prequelle&quot;, and Aimee Mann for the soundtrack of the documentary miniseries &quot;I’ll Be Gone in the Dark&quot;. &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; has been covered numerous times, notably by Jennifer Warnes, who once toured as a back-up singer for Cohen, on her 1987 tribute album to him, &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot;. It has also been covered by Tori Amos on the Leonard Cohen tribute album &quot;Tower of Song&quot;. Warnes also covered &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; on &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; as a duet with Cohen. Allison Crowe recorded &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; for release on her 2004 album &quot;Secrets&quot; and this version also appears on the &quot;Mojo&quot; 2008 tribute compilation CD &quot;Cohen Covered&quot;. Anna Calvi has also covered &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; live and in the studio, available as a B-side to her single &quot;Desire&quot;.

<doc id="1014062" wikidata="Q737410" url="?curid=1014062" title="Manuel Alegre">
<text>Manuel Alegre de Melo Duarte (born 12 May 1936) is a Portuguese poet and politician. He was a candidate to the presidency of the Portuguese Republic in 2006 and 2011, finishing in second place in both elections. For his literary work, he was awarded the Camões Prize in 2017.

==Background==
He is the son of Francisco José de Faria e Melo Ferreira Duarte, brother of sportsman Mário Duarte, son of the 1st Baroness of &quot;a&quot; Recosta, maternal grandson of the 1st Baron of Cadoro and matrilineal great-grandson of the 1st Viscount of &quot;o&quot; Barreiro, and wife Maria Manuela Alegre. His sister Maria Teresa Alegre de Melo Duarte is also a Deputy and is the widow of another Deputy, António Jorge Moreira Portugal (1931–1994). Their son is journalist Manuel Alegre Portugal. As he once stated, his ancestors were hanged and beheaded at the Praça Nova, Porto, during the Liberal Wars.

==Career==
He was a member of the Portuguese Communist Party from his youth until the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, which he staunchly opposed, in 1968. Today he&#x27;s usually considered one of the most leftist members of the Portuguese Socialist Party. He voted against all the revisions of the Portuguese Constitution of 1976, and abstained at a commemorative vote for the 10th anniversary of the fall of Berlin Wall, in 1999.

While studying law at the University of Coimbra, Alegre was noticed for his opposition to António de Oliveira Salazar&#x27;s dictatorial government - the Estado Novo regime. He was conscripted, and sent to the Azores and later to Portuguese Angola, where his involvement in an attempt to military rebellion led to his imprisonment. After serving his prison term in Luanda, he returned to Coimbra, before going into exile in 1964. As a student at the University of Coimbra he was a very active figure of the Associação Académica de Coimbra, the university&#x27;s student&#x27;s union, while member of the governing body, athlete and cultural agent (poetry and theatre). He would never graduate in law.

He would live the next ten years in Algiers, where he was one of the main voices of a radio station directed to Portugal, Rádio Voz da Liberdade (&quot;Freedom&#x27;s Voice&quot;), also called &quot;Rádio Argel&quot;, from where he reportedly led a series of activities supporting African forces opposing the Portuguese military intervention in the Portuguese Colonial War, including by airing privileged information regarding Portuguese strategy in the theater of war. The distribution of his first books was forbidden by Salazar&#x27;s government, so they circulated in samizdat form. Alegre returned to Portugal in 1974, one week after the Carnation Revolution.

He joined the Socialisty Party almost immediately, and was elected to Parliament in every election from 1975 to 2005. He was also one of the vice-presidents of Parliament.

Several of his poems were made into songs, sung among others by Zeca Afonso and Adriano Correia de Oliveira, and played by Carlos Paredes. His words were set to music by Tony Haynes on world jazz ensemble Grand Union Orchestra&#x27;s 1997 album, &quot;The Rhythm of Tides&quot;.

One of his poems &quot;Uma flor de verde pinho&quot; won 1976&#x27;s &quot;Festival RTP da Canção&quot;, who represented Portugal in Eurovision Song Contest.

In 2004, he lost to José Sócrates a bid for the party leadership.

In 2005, a statue in his honour was erected in Coimbra.

On 24 September 2005, he announced that he would be a candidate in the 2006 Portuguese presidential election, despite his party&#x27;s official support for former president Mário Soares as a candidate. On the elections held 22 January 2006, he ended up collecting 20.7% of the valid votes (the second largest amount after the elected President, Cavaco Silva, and ahead of his party&#x27;s official candidate Mário Soares).

He is also a Member of the Portuguese Council of State, elected by the Assembly of the Republic.

==Decorations==
* Grand Cross of the Order of Liberty, Portugal (GCL, 19 May 1989)
* Grand Cross of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword, Portugal (GCSE, 20 May 2016)
* Grand Cross of the Order of Camões, Portugal (GCCa, 15 April 2024)

==Family==
He was once married to Isabel Sousa Pires, born in Figueira da Foz, without issue, and is now married to Mafalda Maria de Campos Durão Ferreira, born in Lisbon, 13 December 1947, daughter of António Durão Ferreira and wife Fernanda Furtado de Antas de Campos and only sister of António Miguel de Campos Durão Ferreira (b. 21 January 1946, unmarried), and has three children:
* Francisco Durão Ferreira Alegre Duarte
* Afonso Durão Ferreira Alegre Duarte (b. 1976)
* Joana Durão Ferreira Alegre Duarte (b. 1985)

<doc id="1014066" wikidata="Q1814051" url="?curid=1014066" title="MPICH">
<text>MPICH, formerly known as MPICH2, is a freely available, portable implementation of MPI, a standard for message-passing for distributed-memory applications used in parallel computing. MPICH is Free and open source software with some public domain components that were developed by a US governmental organisation, and is available for most flavours of Unix-like OS (including Linux and Mac OS X).

== History ==
The Argonne National Laboratory and Mississippi State University jointly developed early versions (MPICH-1) as public domain software. The CH part of the name was derived from &quot;Chameleon&quot;, which was a portable parallel programming library developed by William Gropp, one of the founders of MPICH.

The original implementation of MPICH (sometimes called &quot;MPICH1&quot;) implemented the MPI-1.1 standard. In 2001, work began on a new code base to replace the MPICH1 code and support the MPI-2 standard. Until November 2012, this project was known as &quot;MPICH2&quot;. As of November 2012, the MPICH2 project renamed itself to simply &quot;MPICH&quot;. MPICH v3.0 implements the MPI-3.0 standard. MPICH v4.x implements the MPI-4.x standard.

MPICH is one of the most popular implementations of MPI. It is used as the foundation for the vast majority of MPI implementations, including IBM MPI (for Blue Gene), Intel MPI, Cray MPI, Microsoft MPI, Myricom MPI, OSU MVAPICH/MVAPICH2, and many others.

== MPICH channels ==
Based on ch3 infrastructure:
* Nemesis - Universal, has inter-node modules: elan, GM, IB (infiniband), MX (myrinet express), NewMadeleine, tcp; and several intra-node variants of shared memory for large messages (LMT interface).
* ssm - Sockets and Shared Memory
* shm - SHared memory
* sock - tcp/ip sockets
* sctp - experimental channel over SCTP sockets

== MPICH derivatives ==
*IBM (MPI for the Blue Gene series and, as an option, for x86 and POWER clusters)
*Cray (MPI for all Cray platforms)
*SiCortex (MPI SiCortex)
*Microsoft (MS-MPI)
*Intel (Intel MPI)
*Qlogic (MPICH2-PSM)
*Myricom (MPICH2-MX)
*Ohio State University (MVAPICH and MVAPICH2)
*ParTec (ParaStation MPI)
*University of British Columbia (MPICH2/SCTP, and Fine-Grain MPI (FG-MPI) which adds support for coroutines)

<text>Svetoslav Todorov (; born 30 August 1978) is a Bulgarian former professional footballer who played as a forward. Todorov is the all-time top scorer for Litex Lovech in the Bulgarian A Football Group. He made 41 appearances for the Bulgaria national team, scoring seven goals. He is currently an academy coach at Crystal Palace.

==Club career==

===Early career===
After being part of the youth system since the age of 6, Todorov began his career at Bulgarian First Division club Dobrudzha Dobrich in 1996–97, scoring twice in twelve appearances. He then joined Second Division champions Litex Lovech where he scored 34 goals in 70 league games over four seasons (two of them title winning). He managed a career-high 19 league goals during the 1999–2000 season, being overtaken as the top goalscorer by Mihail Mihaylov on the last match day. Todorov captained the team over the course of the autumn part of the 2000–2001 campaign. He scored his first European goals during the summer of 1999, in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League, all three of them coming against Polish team Widzew Łódź. During his time in Bulgaria he had a clean disciplinary record and was sent off only once (on 13 May 2000, in a 1–0 away loss against Spartak Varna in an A PFG match). His form attracted attention from English clubs and after trials with Preston North End and West Ham United, he joined West Ham in January 2001.

===West Ham United===
Todorov joined West Ham in January 2001 for a fee of £500,000, rising to £2 million depending on appearances. He made his debut in a 3–0 defeat at Liverpool and scored his first goal for the club in his third game, a 3–2 FA Cup defeat at home to Tottenham, and then scored his first league goal for the club against Middlesbrough. However, following manager Harry Redknapp&#x27;s departure from the club in May 2001, Todorov found himself out of favour and he played just eight games under new manager Glenn Roeder in the 2001–02 season.

===Portsmouth===
Todorov signed for Portsmouth in March 2002 for £750,000, joining director of football, Harry Redknapp, who had signed him for West Ham; Redknapp described him as, &quot;...a very intelligent footballer [who] will bring good competition in the striking department.&quot; He was sent off for violent conduct in his second appearance for Portsmouth in a 2–0 defeat away at Preston and made only one further appearance in the 2001–02 season. He became a regular in the first team in the 2002–03 season, making 45 league appearances and scoring 26 goals, including a hat-trick in the final game of the season against Bradford City, as Portsmouth won the Football League First Division championship and were promoted to the Premier League. He was the First Division&#x27;s top scorer, overhauling Nottingham Forest&#x27;s David Johnson with his hat-trick on the final day of the season; Redknapp said, &quot;Todorov has had a great season. He is leading scorer in the First Division after today&#x27;s goals. I bought him from my old club West Ham and he got a lot of stick at first... He has done marvellously, proving what a great player he is.&quot; Todorov signed a new three-year contract with Portsmouth in July 2003.

Days before the start of the club&#x27;s debut Premiership season, Todorov severely damaged a cruciate knee ligament in a training accident. He required surgery on his knee and was expected to miss the rest of the 2003–04 season. He made a comeback in the Portsmouth reserve side in February 2004 and returned to the first team in an away game at Liverpool. He made only the one appearance for Portsmouth in the Premiership during the 2003–04 season and required further surgery on his knee in May 2004, causing him to miss the Euro 2004 championships in the summer of 2004 and the entire 2004–05 season. He was given a new contract in August 2005 and, having played very little in the previous two seasons, was offered to other clubs on loan to regain fitness. However, he remained with Portsmouth and was used mostly as a substitute during the 2005–06 season. He scored the winning goal against West Bromwich Albion in manager Harry Redknapp&#x27;s second game on returning to Portsmouth in December 2005 and scored crucial goals against West Ham, Blackburn Rovers and Sunderland as Portsmouth battled against and survived relegation.

After scoring twice for Portsmouth in the opening three games of the 2006–07 season, Todorov joined Wigan Athletic in August 2006 on a season-long loan. Wigan manager, Paul Jewell, described him as &quot;..a pure striker who lives to put the ball in the net.&quot; However, he made only five appearances for Wigan, without scoring, and returned to Portsmouth in January 2007. He made one further appearance in the 2006–07 season, as a substitute against Fulham in March 2007.

===Charlton Athletic===
Having fallen down the pecking order at Portsmouth in the 2006–07 season, Todorov joined relegated side Charlton Athletic in July 2007 on a free transfer in a one-year deal. His first league goal for Charlton came against London rivals Crystal Palace in September 2007, but after suffering a knee injury in a match against Plymouth in October 2007, Todorov was ruled out of the remainder of the 2007–08 season. He signed a new one-year contract in June 2008, but was not offered a new contract at the end of the 2008–09 season.

===Litex Lovech===
Todorov joined his former club Litex Lovech as a free agent on 16 July 2009.
On 8 August 2009, he marked his return to the TBI A Football Group with a goal after coming on as a substitute for Ivelin Popov – wrapping up a 5–0 away win against Lokomotiv Mezdra with an 89th-minute strike. On 25 October 2010, Todorov scored a last-minute goal against Levski Sofia to help his team to a 2–1 home win. In January 2011, he was chosen by the Litex fans as the 2010 Best Club Player for the Year. On 12 July 2011, he netted twice to help his team to a 2–1 away win against Montenegrin side Mogren in the first leg match of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase. Todorov left the club after the end of the 2011–12 season.

===Hoverla Uzhhorod===
In late August 2012, Todorov signed a one-year contract with newly promoted Ukrainian Premier League club Hoverla Uzhhorod. He made his debut for FC Hoverla Uzhhorod on 31 August 2012, in the 2–1 home win over Tavriya Simferopol and played the last match of his professional career on 24 November, in the 5–1 away loss against Shakhtar Donetsk. He left the club in January 2013 and later announced his retirement.

==International career==
He used to be part of the Bulgaria U21 team. Todorov made his debut for Bulgaria on 10 March 1998, in the 0:2 loss against Argentina in a friendly match. He was in manager Hristo Bonev&#x27;s plans for the 1998 World Cup, but missed out due to an injury. For the same reason, he was unable to participate in Euro 2004.

==Personal life==
Todorov is married to Severina and they have a son. His father, Ivan Manolov, is also a football manager and represented Dobrudzha Dobrich in his playing days. Todorov&#x27;s younger brother, Pavlin, is a former professional footballer and current manager as well.

<doc id="1014079" wikidata="Q7794926" url="?curid=1014079" title="Thomas Watson (bishop of Lincoln)">
<text>Thomas Watson (1515 – 27 September 1584) was a Catholic Bishop, notable among Catholics for his descriptions of the Protestant Reformation. Historian Albert Pollard described Watson as &quot;one of the chief Catholic controversialists&quot; of Mary Tudor&#x27;s reign.

==Early life==
Watson was born near Durham in 1515. He grew up in a monastic world at Nun Stainton, near Durham. Little about his earliest schooling is known, but for entrance to Cambridge University, he would have studied at Durham&#x27;s Priory School. &quot;The Rites of Durham&quot;, written in about 1593, recalls life in Durham Cathedral before the Dissolution. Watson describes the school, and the last schoolmaster, Robert Hartburne, as a venerable and learned monk, always looking for a bright pupil who was &quot;apt to learning, and did apply his book, and had a pregnant wit with all&quot; to groom for university entrance.

He left for St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1529. The majority of staff and students of the university, under their Chancellor, John Fisher, were clerics or future clerics. Watson received his B.A. in 1532/3 and his M.A. in 1536.

==Absalom==
In response to his oath of allegiance to Henry VIII, Watson wrote an unpublished five-act play. The play, written in Latin verse and completed at around 1540, was based on Absalom&#x27;s revolt against his father David described in the Old Testament. The manuscript was hidden and lost until it was rediscovered among 16th century humanist manuscripts in the British Museum in 1963.

Absalom was written &quot;in trew imitation&quot; of a classical tragedy, but with a contemporary twist. In language and style it imitates Aristotle, Horace or Seneca, and yet in content the biblical story merges with events taking place all around. The story begins with a prince quarrelling with his father. The issue concerns his brother and their relationship with a princess. Absalom demands a particular ruling from his father, but David cannot comply. Absalom decides to act in defiance of his father, and David censures him. Absalom flies into a rage, and furiously begins to undermine and then deny his father&#x27;s authority.

Absalom&#x27;s subjects are dismayed, but forced to take sides. Innocent people are involved. Absalom resorts to decrees, threats, intimidation and executions. Although he has qualms of conscience, he overcomes them as opposition melts before his onslaught. With no father to restrain him, he can now do whatever he wishes.

The chorus in Absalom identifies David as God&#x27;s elect, &quot;Son of Jesse&quot;, and anointed ruler of Israel. He unites diverse tribes into one people. He is their focus of unity with undisputed authority. He is holy and pious with a prayer always on his lips. He wants to help Absalom, but he cannot. He is full of love for his prodigal son. The chorus is not uncritical of David&#x27;s weaknesses, but reveres his divine office as &quot;Holy Father&quot; of God&#x27;s people.

Similarly, the chorus sees Absalom as David&#x27;s once-devoted son. He had always honoured and obeyed his father according to the divine precepts. But now, if his every whim is not granted, he flies into a rage. Even his ministers go in fear, giving in to him in all things. But, warns the chorus, his unbridled pride will be his downfall.

In Absalom, David presides over Old Jerusalem as the pope presides over New Jerusalem. The beloved son rebels against his father, launches his attack, overthrows him, and usurps his place. David refuses to retaliate, allowing time for Absalom to return to his senses and seek reconciliation. But Absalom sees his father&#x27;s hesitation not as love, but as weakness.

In Watson&#x27;s play, Absalom sacks David&#x27;s temples in the territories he controls. He expels their guardians, loots their possessions, and destroys their altars. There is no mention of temples in the Old Testament story, but what Watson describes parallels the dissolution and plundering of the monasteries, guilds, shrines and chantry chapels. Absalom is destroying David&#x27;s last footholds, filling his treasury, funding his rebellion, and securing his own position. He vows there will be no reconciliation.

By Act IV those closest to Absalom are dismayed by his ferocity. He turns on these too, as Henry turned on Wolsey, Fisher, More and Cromwell. But opposition appears on two fronts. The disenchanted are converting back to David and joining those who had gone into hiding. And allies of David abroad are raising an army. No longer knowing whom he can trust, Absalom ruthlessly hunts down those loyal to David.

While the first four acts of Absalom looked at parallels in what had happened so far, the fifth looked to parallels in the future. Presumably, what happened to Absalom would happen to Henry. There would be a final battle. As victory went to David, it would inevitably go to the pope. As David resumed his appointed role over God&#x27;s people, so would the pope. As Absalom&#x27;s revolt amounted to nothing, nor would Henry&#x27;s! Watson&#x27;s message, then, is one of patience and total confidence in the ultimate victory of the pope.

==Academic career==
Watson took his master&#x27;s degree in 1537 and became a lecturer, then Dean of his college. However, with Thomas Cromwell as Chancellor after 1535, and Stephen Gardiner after 1540, the hunting and purging of undercover papists continued. Nicholas Metcalf, Master of St. John&#x27;s since 1518, was forced to resign in 1537. The next Master, George Day, was also denounced as a papist in 1538. Cromwell then had one of his own men, John Taylor, &quot;elected by force.&quot; He was the first avowed anti-papist &quot;reformer&quot; to become Master of St. John&#x27;s College.

When Taylor introduced a stiff vetting process for students and staff, Watson was one of twenty fellows to protest, but to no avail. When Cromwell was arraigned and executed for heresy in 1540, Taylor was also arrested. He was held for a while, but promised to conform to Henry&#x27;s Six Articles. Heresy charges were dropped, and he resumed his office as Master. But Lutheranism was on the increase. After Watson took his divinity degree in 1543, he began to emerge as one of the college&#x27;s foremost champions and preachers of the Old Faith.

By 1545, with mounting hostility from Taylor and others, Watson consulted the Chancellor, Stephen Gardiner. Gardiner, like Henry, was dismayed that anti-papal sentiment was becoming anti-Catholic as well. While he had supported the king&#x27;s efforts to overthrow papal authority in favour of royal supremacy, he was now alarmed at where this might lead. Gardiner saw in Watson a kindred spirit and invited him to be his domestic chaplain – one of his personal aides. So in 1545 Watson joined the familia of the Bishop of Winchester; he was no longer subject to Taylor, and now had the Chancellor&#x27;s authority and support for his preaching. In 1546 Taylor was forced to resign as Master of St John&#x27;s. Under Edward VI he would follow Henry Holbeach as the second (married) Protestant Bishop of Lincoln.

Watson worked side by side with Gardiner during Henry&#x27;s last two years, trying to keep the Church in England Catholic. In the process he became widely known as a powerful advocate for the Old Faith. In spite of this, during the last months of his reign, Henry ordered the execution of three papists for questioning his royal supremacy, and the burning of three Lutherans for questioning his Catholic doctrine.

==Arrest under Edward&#x27;s rule ==
All was well while Henry lived and Gardiner held his own against Cranmer. But when Henry died, nine-year-old Edward came to the throne, and Lord Protector Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset became in effect the first Lutheran &quot;Head&quot; of the English Church. When Gardiner opposed Somerset&#x27;s changes he was arrested. Watson continued preaching, but not for long. Two of Somerset&#x27;s agents, Tonge and Ayre, appointed as canons of Winchester in defiance of Gardiner, denounced Watson for hampering the cause of reform. Watson was arrested and committed to the Fleet Prison.

In 1548 an amnesty was proclaimed and Gardiner and Watson were released. Gardiner was confined to house arrest in London and Watson stayed with him. In December they were allowed to return to Winchester. In their absence, images had been removed from churches, the liturgy changed, processions forbidden, and Protestant preachers introduced. Henry VIII&#x27;s Six Articles had been repealed, more changes were rumoured, and people were confused. Gardiner again protested. He and Watson were summoned back to London where Gardiner was recommitted to the Tower. Before he could be brought to trial the Lutheran Somerset had fallen, and the next effectual &quot;Head&quot; of the Church was a Zwinglian, Protector Northumberland.

In 1551 Watson was called to give evidence for the prosecution and defence, and Gardiner was confirmed guilty. He was returned to the Tower where he stayed throughout Edward&#x27;s reign. Watson was forbidden to preach. In December 1551 he was back in London to be examined on his belief in the doctrine of transubstantiation. His examiners included no less than William Cecil, John Cheke, Robert Horne, and Edmund Grindal. His friends John Feckenham and John Young had also been summoned, and the examination took the form of a debate. The three were given assurances of immunity from prosecution, but were wary. Strype accused Watson of equivocation. Grindal was furious with the outcome. At this time Watson was probably working with Gardiner on his case against Cranmer entitled &quot;Confutatio Cavillationum&quot;, printed in Paris in 1552. This was later used against Cranmer at his trial.

==Under Mary&#x27;s reign==
When Mary came to the throne in August 1553, she immediately released Gardiner and restored him to his offices as Bishop of Winchester and Chancellor of Cambridge University. On Gardiner&#x27;s advice she chose Watson to formally announce her intention to restore England to the Catholic Faith. On 20 August 1553, a great gathering was called at St Paul&#x27;s Cross In the presence of the Queen, members of the court, bishops, dignitaries, nobility, the Lord Mayor and aldermen of London, representatives of the crafts and trades, and with a military guard, Thomas Watson stood to preach. It was more of a manifesto than a sermon. He referred to the confusion lately spread by Protestant preachers to whom people should no longer listen. He asked them not to seek new doctrines or a new faith, nor to build a new church or new temple. He exhorted them rather to return to the old faith, the faith of their fathers, and to help their Queen to restore the old temple. His sermon made a great impression, preparing the way for what was to come.

Gardiner then sent Watson back to Cambridge with full authority to restore the university&#x27;s former statutes and traditions. He was welcomed back and elected Master of his old College, St. John&#x27;s on 28 September 1553. He confronted those Protestant members of the Convocation who had expelled and excluded Catholics and turned the tables on them. He reinstated the statutes of John Fisher, and committed the university to restoring and observing former Catholic traditions, customs and liturgies.

Durham Cathedral was in a state of chaos, and on 18 November he was elected its third Dean. Prior Hugh Whitehead, elected first Dean in 1540, had kept Durham Catholic under Henry VIII. At Edward&#x27;s accession he had been called to London and ordered to introduce the reformed religion, but he collapsed and died and was buried near the Tower of London. Somerset then sent two &quot;commissioners&quot; to Durham. The author of the Rites names them as Dr. Harvy, Dr. Whitby and Dr. Horne and describes their mission &quot;to deface all popish ornaments&quot;, not only in the cathedral, but in surrounding churches. Robert Horne, Watson&#x27;s old adversary, had been appointed Dean in 1551. Now in 1553 Watson was sent to replace him, and Horne retired abroad.

In April 1554 he went to Oxford to dispute or reason with Cranmer, Ridley and Latimer, now charged with heresy. He was asked to examine other &quot;heretics&quot;, including Bishop Hooper and John Rogers, but was also in great demand for preaching. He was even summoned to preach before the Queen, which he did on 17 March and 14 April in &quot;Two Notable Sermons.&quot; The first was &quot;Concerning the Real Presence of Christ&#x27;s Body and Blood in the Blessed Sacrament&quot; and the second &quot;The Mass which is the Sacrifice of the New Testament&quot;. He argued that the early fathers, the great doctors, and the councils of the Church witnessed to the truth of Catholic Eucharistic teaching. He argued that the three bedrocks of the Church had always been the scriptures, unbroken tradition, and the apostolic magisterium. Scripture alone was not enough, as sectarianism and fragmentation of religious belief after Luther had demonstrated.

==&quot;Absalom&quot; come true==
Watson was passionate as well about restoring the sacraments to those who had lost them. His engagements included several public orations like that at St. Mary&#x27;s Spital at the end of April. Mary was eager to relinquish her parliamentary title of &quot;Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of England&quot; and seek reconciliation with Rome. Cardinal Pole, as Papal Legate, formally welcomed England back into the Catholic Fold on St. Andrew&#x27;s Day, 30 November 1554. Watson&#x27;s hopes and dreams, so poetically expressed in &quot;Absalom&quot;, had finally come about.

Bishop Gardiner, now convinced of the fatal flaw in royal supremacy, died reconciled to Rome in November 1555. John White, who had followed Taylor as Bishop of Lincoln, was translated to Winchester in 1556, and Thomas Watson, pending ratification by the pope, was elected the thirty-fourth Bishop of Lincoln. In January 1557, as bishop-elect, he was sent by Cardinal Pole to &quot;re-visit&quot; Cambridge University and ensure that all was proceeding well. He re-emphasised the importance of traditional doctrine, traditional symbolism and traditional liturgy. The following month, February 1557, he officiated at the exhumation and burning of the remains of Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius. At the ceremony he preached for two hours on the harm they had done to the English Church by their &quot;wykedness and heretycall doctryn.&quot;

Watson&#x27;s papal bull of appointment (the last ever for a Bishop of Lincoln) was issued on 24 March 1557. However, he still had business in Durham. On 29 May, Cardinal Pole gave him permission to remain Dean of Durham for as long as necessary. His main task was the restoration of Catholic doctrine, customs and liturgy, included efforts to recover valuables, property and land plundered during the two previous reigns. But he also undertook some duties in the Diocese of Lincoln as Bishop-Elect.

==Consecrated Bishop of Lincoln==
Watson was consecrated Bishop of Lincoln on the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary on 15 August 1557, by the Archbishop of York in London. Arriving in Lincoln for his installation in October, he was met with pomp and ceremony at the cathedral&#x27;s Great West Doors by his clergy. The bells rang out and the choirs sang as he was conducted to his Episcopal seat. He was dismayed at the impoverishment of the diocese and set himself to recovering what he could, including several manors, estates and benefices seized by Henry and Edward. He also retrieved &quot;many rich vestments, articles of plate and other furniture of which the Church of Lincoln had been despoiled.&quot;

Watson spent much of his time as Bishop of Lincoln travelling the diocese or in London. He was asked to preach at St. Paul&#x27;s Cross in February 1558 before another assembly of dignitaries, including the Lord Mayor and aldermen of London, ten bishops, and a huge crowd of people. In constant demand, he was now one of the hierarchy&#x27;s most celebrated spokesmen. At the request of Cardinal Pole and Convocation he prepared thirty of his sermons for publication. Entitled &quot;Holsome and Catholyke Doctryne concerninge the Seven Sacramentes of Chrystes Church, expedient to be knowen of all men, set forth in maner of Shorte Sermons to bee made to the People&quot;, his book was printed in London in 1558. Watson gained a reputation for leniency in dealing with Protestants. During his time as Bishop of Lincoln, the most severe period of Mary&#x27;s campaign against &quot;heretics&quot;, there was not a single execution in the whole Diocese.

==Arrest under Elizabeth&#x27;s rule==
Mary and Pole died within hours of each other on 17 November 1558. Elizabeth and Cecil lost no time in consulting with Protestant dissidents. In March 1559, the bishops were summoned to the Westminster Conference to dispute with them over the future of the English Church. When it became obvious that the outcome was already determined, the bishops could not proceed. It was then alleged that White and Watson had urged them to consider the Queen&#x27;s excommunication. The two bishops were arrested and sent to the Tower on 3 April 1559.

By early May fresh Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity had been passed, and the Protestant Book of Common Prayer reintroduced. The bishops were once more cut off from Rome, stripped of their authority and &quot;extinguished&quot; as a hierarchy. On 25 June Watson was tried, found guilty, deprived of his bishopric, and given a life sentence. One by one Elizabeth replaced the Catholic bishops with Protestants.

==Confinement==

After a time in the Tower of London, Watson was placed in the custody of his old adversaries: Grindal, now Bishop of London; Guest, now Bishop of Rochester; and Richard Cox, now Bishop of Ely. Ten years later, in 1570 the pope finally excommunicated Elizabeth. Watson was returned to the Tower. When interrogated about the excommunication, his only regret was that it might create greater hardship for Catholics. He was kept in the Tower until the following year, and then returned to his former places of confinement. He was transferred from the custody of the Bishop of Rochester to that of the Bishop of Ely in 1580, and committed to imprisonment in Wisbech Castle.

The Bishop of Ely had been ordered to turn his palace Wisbech Castle into an internment centre for Catholics, and for the first time in years Watson had friends around him. These included his old friend John Feckenham, a fellow student of his at Cambridge and the last Abbot of Westminster. Along with former Marian priests there were newly arrived seminary priests and Jesuits. Watson&#x27;s contacts now widened, and he appears to have exercised some sort of episcopal ministry &quot;in vinculis&quot;.

==Death==
In March 1581 he was accused of corresponding with Catholics in Portugal, but his health and eyesight were deteriorating. He died almost blind at the age of sixty-nine. He had been confined for twenty-five years, ending his days in Wisbech Castle on 15 October 1584, and was buried in the parish church of Wisbech.

His epitaph is given in the &quot;Athenae Cantabrigiensis&quot; (1858):

Thomas Watson, sometime Master of St John&#x27;s College Cambridge,&lt;br&gt;
Dean of Durham and Bishop of Lincoln:
&quot;Orator Facundas, Bonus Poeta,&lt;br&gt;
Solidus Theologus et Concionator Celebris.&quot;

&quot;An eloquent speaker, a gifted poet,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;a sound theologian and a celebrated preacher.&quot;

<text>Short U (Ў ў; italics: &quot;Ў ў&quot;) or U with breve is a letter of the Cyrillic script. The only Slavic language using the letter in its orthography is Belarusian, but it is also used as a phonetic symbol in some Russian and Ukrainian dictionaries. Among the non-Slavic languages using Cyrillic alphabets, ў is used in Dungan, Karakalpak, Karachay-Balkar, Mansi, Sakhalin Nivkh, Ossetian and Siberian Yupik. It is also used in Uzbek – this letter corresponds to Oʻ in the Uzbek Latin alphabet.

==History==
The letter originates from the letter izhitsa with a breve (, etc.) used in certain Ukrainian books at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th centuries. Later, this character was probably in use in the Romanian Cyrillic script, from where it was borrowed in 1836 by the compilers of Ukrainian poetry book &quot;Rusalka Dnistrovaja&quot; (). The book&#x27;s foreword reads “we have accepted Serbian џ … and Wallachian [Romanian] &quot;ў&quot; …”. In this book, is used mostly for etymological [l] transformed to [w]. Modern Ukrainian spelling uses (&quot;v&quot;) in that position.

For Belarusian, the combination of the Cyrillic letter U with a breve was proposed by P.A. Bessonov in 1870. Before that, various ad hoc adaptations of the Latin U were used, for example, italicized in some publications of Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich, with acute accent in Jan Czeczot&#x27;s &quot;Da milykh mužyczkoú&quot; (&quot;To dear peasants&quot;, 1846 edition), W with breve in Epimakh-Shypila, 1889, or just the letter itself (like in publications of Konstanty Kalinowski, 1862–1863). A U with haček was also used.

After 1870, both the distinction for the phoneme and the new shape of the letter still were not consistently used until the mid-1900s for technical problems, per Bulyka. Among the first publications using it were folklore collections published by Michał Federowski and the first edition of Francišak Bahuševič&#x27;s &quot;Dudka Biełaruskaja&quot; (&quot;Belarusian flute&quot;, published in Kraków, 1891). For quite a while other kinds of renderings (plain , or with added accent, haček, or caret) were still being used, sometimes within a single publication (Bahushevich, 1891, Pachobka, 1915), also supposedly because of technical problems.

==Usage==

===Belarusian===
The letter is called &quot;non-syllabic u&quot; or &quot;short u&quot; ( or у кароткае, &quot;u karotkaye&quot;) in Belarusian because although it resembles the vowel у (&quot;u&quot;), it does not form syllables. Its equivalent in the Belarusian Latin alphabet is , although it is also sometimes transcribed as .

In native Belarusian words, is used after vowels and represents a , as in хлеў, pronounced (&quot;chleŭ&quot;, ‘shed’) or воўк (&quot;voŭk&quot;, ‘wolf’). This is similar to the in English &quot;cow&quot; .

The letter cannot occur before a non-iotated vowel in native words (except compound words such as паўакна, ‘half a window’); when that would be required by grammar, is replaced by . Compare хлеў ( &quot;chleŭ&quot;, ‘shed’) with за хлявом ( &quot;za chlavóm&quot;, ‘behind the shed’). Also, when a word starts with an unstressed and follows a word that ends in a vowel, it forms a diphthong through liaison and it is written with instead. For example, у хляве ( &quot;u chlavié&quot;, ‘in the shed’) but увайшлі яны ў хлеў ( &quot;uvajšlí janý ŭ chleŭ&quot;, ‘they went into the shed’). According to the current official orthographic rules of 2008, proper names conserve the initial in writing, so the capital letter can occur only in all-capitals writing. Previous official orthographic rules (1959) also made exception for loanwords (каля універсітэта, ‘near the university’, now spelled каля ўніверсітэта). The unofficial 2005 standardization of Taraškievica allows the capital in proper names. In acronyms/initialisms, the word-initial becomes : ВНУ for вышэйшая навучальная ўстанова ‘higher education institution (university, college, institute)’. Also, becomes in name initials in Taraškievica.

The letter is also sometimes used to represent the labial-velar approximant in foreign loanwords: this usage is allowed by the 2005 standardization of Taraškievica. When it is used thus it can appear before non-iotated vowels, does not require a preceding vowel, and may be capital.

In poetry, word-initial and are sometimes used according to the rhythm of a poem. In this case, the capital may also occur.

===Uzbek===
This letter is the 32nd letter of the Uzbek Cyrillic alphabet as it is a letter of its own and not a variant of ⟨у⟩. It corresponds to Oʻ in the current Uzbek alphabet. It is different from the regular O, which is represented by the Cyrillic letter О. Furthermore, it represents , which is pronounced as either or , in contrast to the letter O, which represents .

=== Karakalpak ===
The letter is the 26th letter in the Karakalpak alphabet. It corresponds to the sound /w/ and the Latin letter W.

==In culture==

In September 2003, during the tenth Days of Belarusian Literacy celebrations, the authorities in Polatsk, the oldest Belarusian city, made a monument to honor the unique Cyrillic Belarusian letter . The original idea for the monument came from professor Paval Siemčanka, a scholar of Cyrillic calligraphy and type.

The letter is also the namesake of Ў gallery, an art gallery in Minsk between 2009 and 2020.

<text>The Société littéraire des Goncourt (, &quot;Goncourt Literary Society&quot;), usually called the Académie Goncourt (, Goncourt Academy), is a French literary organisation based in Paris. It was founded in 1882 by the French writer and publisher Edmond de Goncourt (1822–1896), who wanted to create a new way to encourage literature in France and disagreed with the contemporary policies of the Académie Française.

Wishing to honour his deceased brother Jules (1830–1870), Goncourt bequeathed his estate to establish an organisation to promote literature in France. He named his friend, the writer Alphonse Daudet, along with Léon Hennique, to oversee and administer his estate. The society was to consist of ten members, of whom eight were nominated in the will. Each of the members was to receive an annuity of 6,000 francs, and a yearly prize of 5,000 francs was to be awarded to the author of some work of fiction. After some litigation, the academy was constituted in 1903. Since then, each December, a ten-member board of the Académie has awarded the &quot;Prix Goncourt&quot; for the best work of fiction of the year.

Membership is reserved to writers who have produced works in the French language, but it is not limited to citizens of France. In 1996, the Spanish novelist and scriptwriter Jorge Semprún was elected as the first foreigner to become a member of the academy.

In addition to the Prix Goncourt, which comes with a symbolic cheque of 10 euros, the Académie Goncourt awards honours for first novel and achievements in short story, poetry and biography genres.

The ten members of the academy are usually called &quot;les Dix&quot; (the Ten). They meet the first Tuesday of each month, except in summer. Since 1914, they have convened in an oval room, the &quot;salon Goncourt&quot;, on the second floor of the restaurant Drouant, place Gaillon, in the heart of Paris. The cutlery which they use while dining there constitutes the main physical continuity of the academy. Each new member receives the fork and knife of the member whom he (or she) is replacing, and the member&#x27;s name is engraved on the knife and the fork.

<text>Century Radio, also known as &quot;Century 100&quot; and later &quot;Century FM&quot;, was a short-lived national commercial radio station in the Republic of Ireland, broadcasting from 4 September 1989 to 19 November 1991.

==History==
===Launch===
Launched at 8am on Monday 4 September 1989, Century Radio was intended as the first licensed alternative to RTÉ Radio 1 within the Republic of Ireland and the country&#x27;s first national commercial station. The first song played on the station was &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; by U2.

The national licence was issued in an effort to kill off pirate radio in the Republic of Ireland, but full coverage was only achieved in early 1990. It later emerged that Century&#x27;s licence was issued illegally, as the then Minister for Communications, Ray Burke, received a bribe in the region of IR£100,000 to issue the licence. Burke was later jailed for making false tax returns after the allegations surrounding the licence were investigated by the Flood Tribunal.

The station&#x27;s investors, including Terry Wogan (the first voice heard on the station) and Chris de Burgh, were anxious to secure a quick return on their money, and unwilling to wait and see if the station&#x27;s fortunes would turn around. Its major competitor, RTÉ, broadcast Century over their transmitter network without claiming their fee, which was repeatedly reduced in the hope of actually receiving payment.

A £400,000 publicity campaign at launch was deemed to have failed because of confusion over the station&#x27;s frequencies. Those living outside of Dublin would not find the station even close to 100-102 FM, if they could even find it at all, because of the poor coverage.

===Programming===
The station&#x27;s playlist consisted of mainstream chart hits from the 1970s and 1980s, backed up by slick production and jingles from JAM Creative Productions in Dallas. Unsuccessful attempts by Century to acquire major RTÉ talent also led to problems. After their IR£1 million offer for Gay Byrne was turned down, they tried unsuccessfully to poach several other personalities from the national broadcaster, although they did secure the services of leading Radio 2 DJ Marty Whelan as breakfast presenter. Kenny Everett also contributed a daily ten-minute &quot;Captain Kremmen&quot; show to the station.

Century&#x27;s sports service proved popular, with Capital Gold&#x27;s live football commentaries relayed on &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Scoreboard&quot; on Saturday afternoons. Capital&#x27;s two main commentators at the time, Jonathan Pearce and Steve Wilson, would later feature on &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. Other notable sports coverage included live commentaries of Dundalk F.C.&#x27;s 1991-92 European Cup campaign, and, in a major coup, Century were first to announce the starting line-ups for the 1990 All-Ireland Hurling and Football Finals.

===Financial problems and closure===
The Government of Ireland tried a number of measures to assist Century, including Ray Burke&#x27;s imposition of a cap on the maximum amount of advertising RTÉ could carry. But this measure made it more difficult for Century to exist as it reduced the rates RTÉ charged to carry advertising - leading to a knock-on effect on how much Century could charge. The cap was not abolished until the Labour/Fine Gael Government came to power in the mid-1990s, after Century ceased broadcasting.

In November 1991, with Century&#x27;s losses reaching £7 million, its major shareholder Oliver Barry sold off his 28% stake in the company, leaving Capital Radio as the main investor. When an effort to find new backing failed, Capital pulled out and Century was placed into liquidation on Tuesday 19 November 1991. The station ceased broadcasting at 6pm that evening, immediately following a short news report by journalist Dairena Ní Chinnéide announcing its demise.

Later that month, a last-minute attempt by Oliver Barry to save Century Radio was accepted by the Independent Radio and Television Commission, but collapsed when it was rejected by one of the existing major shareholders.

Century&#x27;s franchise was left idle for six years before it was re-issued to Radio Ireland (Today FM), who were allocated frequencies in the 100-102 MHz band from the start (except 105.5 in the North East of Ireland).

==Transmission==
Initially, Century&#x27;s highest frequency transmitter was at 100.3 MHz, with all others sitting in the 98 MHz band (e.g. 98.4 MHz at 50W in Limerick and 98.4 MHz at 500W in Cork). Within the first year the frequencies were eventually changed, ranging from 100.0 to 101.8 MHz – the frequencies now carrying Today FM.

Within weeks of launch, Century also began broadcasting on 1143 AM in Dublin and Cork.

<text>Cachoeira Paulista is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte, in the Guaratinguetá Microregion.

It is located at latitude 22º39&#x27;54 &quot;south and longitude 45º00&#x27;34&quot; west, being at an altitude of 521 meters. Its estimated population in 2020 was 33,581 inhabitants.

It has as bordering cities Cruzeiro to the north, Silveiras to the east, Lorena to the south and west and Canas to the southwest.
People or things that come from or inhabit in Cachoeira Paulista are called &quot;cachoeirense&quot;.

The Brazilian Decimetric Array radio telescope is situated in Cachoeira Paulista.

The municipality contains part of the Mananciais do Rio Paraíba do Sul Environmental Protection Area, created in 1982 to protect the sources of the Paraíba do Sul river.

== History ==

Documents from 1730 cite a settlement belonging to the Village of Lorena, called Arraial of the Porto da Caxoeira, whose initial landmark of the primitive nucleus was a small hermitage erected by devotees in honor of Lord Bom Jesus da Cana Verde, in the year 1780. On October 18, 1784, Manoel da Silva Caldas and his wife, Ângela Maria de Jesus, donated &quot;two fathoms wide by half a mile long on the left bank of the Paraíba do Sul River, to the borders with the Embaú,&quot; to the patrimony of the new Chapel of the Bom Jesus da Cana Verde, erected in its lands by Sebastiana de Tal, constituting in fact the camp that allowed the expansion of the village there installed.

The first buildings installed consisted of huts of sertanejos (settlers), mostly fishermen, who took their sustenance from the Paraíba River. The first street of Cachoeira was Bom Jesus Street, which at that time left the chapel and advanced to the route through which the muleteers headed for Minas Gerais. The great movement of muleteers, which went to the ports of Paraty and Mambucaba consolidated the character of the old settlement, centered in the canoe ports of the Rivers Paraíba and Bocaína, mainly with the implantation of coffee cultivation. Under these conditions, was created in 1876, the Parish of Santo Antonio do Porto da Cachoeira. Four years later the name was changed to Santo Antonio of the Bocaina, evoking the landscape of the mountain ranges of the Bocaíca that surround the place.

On August 18, 1822, Prince Regent Dom Pedro I passed through the city, during his trip from Rio de Janeiro to Santos, during the events that preceded the proclamation of Brazil&#x27;s independence. It was in the old settlement called Santo Antônio da Cachoeira, where he takes a break for dinner, that Dom Pedro and his entourage exchanged mules for horses purchased from farmers in the region by João Phelipe David, an officer of the royal guard and future Baron of Santo Antônio da Cachoeira, who had recruited several militiamen for the separatist cause.

One of the most significant historical moments of the city occurred in 1932, during the Constitutionalist Revolution. During this period, the municipality became a war-zone, becoming the headquarters of the Constitutionalist Movement.

=== Administrative History ===

Parish created under the name of Santo Antonio da Bocaína, by provincial law No. 37, dated 03/29/1876, subordinate to the municipality of Lorena. High to the category of town with the denomination of Santo Antonio of Bocaína, by the provincial law nº 5, of 03/03/1880, dismembered of Lorena. Seat in the old town of Santo Antonio da Cachoeira. Constituted of the district headquarters. Installed 1/8/1883. It was called Bocaína, when it was elevated to the category of City, according to municipal law nº 14, of 05/15/1895. In administrative division of 1911, the municipality of Bocaína is constituted of the district headquarters. It is now known as Cachoeira, according to Law No. 1,470 of 10/29/1915, thus remaining in territorial divisions dated 12/31/1936 and 12/31/1937. It was renamed Valpaíba, on November 30, 1944, by virtue of Decree No. 14,334. Finally, on December 24, 1948, the municipality became known as Cachoeira Paulista.

=== Toponymy ===

The origin of the name Cachoeira Paulista is due to the fact that Rio Paraíba has some stretches and waterfalls at that point, making of the place the last navigable point of the river in the way of the current.

== Geography ==

=== Landscape ===

Located deep in the Paraíba do Sul River Valley, between the Mantiqueira, Bocaíca and Mar Sierras, coordinates of 22º39&#x27;54 &quot;south latitude and longitude 45º00&#x27;34&quot; west and altitude is 521m. It has rugged relief, with several hills and hills and a large area of flooded fluvial plain.
It has a subtropical climate, with well defined seasons, hot and rainy summers and cold and dry winters, with average precipitation of 1200mm. It suffers the influence of the semi-humid climate of the surrounding Sierras, which makes the climate very unstable, with great variation of temperature throughout the day.

&quot;Hosanna, Brazil&quot; is one of many celebrations held by the Canção Nova Community in mid-December, with church services, lectures and concerts. The city gets its hotels almost crowded during these periods.

The headquarters of Canção Nova also features a large TV studio where the programs shown by their issuer belonging to the institution are recorded.

<text>The National Wax Museum Plus is a waxworks in Dublin, Ireland. First opened in 1983 as the National Wax Museum, it was later relocated and renamed.

==History==

The National Wax Museum at it was then known was originally situated in Granby Row Dublin 1, close to Parnell Square on the north side of the city. It was opened in 1983 by the Lord Mayor of Dublin. In the past, it was a former site to prayer rooms converted into a cinema called Plaza Cinema (and prior to that Bethesda Chapel) and then into a waxworks, but this building was demolished to make way for a hotel.

The old Wax Museum in Granby Row had closed in 2005 and the site was to be redeveloped as the Maldron Hotel Parnell Square. In 2009 the museum, which at this time had now changed its name to Wax Museum Plus, found a new location in 4 Fosters Place, Temple Bar. On December 4, 2016 The Irish Stock Exchange purchased the Foster&#x27;s Place location and The Wax Museum was relocated to the Lafayette Building in the centre of Dublin, more specifically 22–25 Westmoreland Street. The museum opened its doors on 25 April 2017, with new exhibitions and a new augmented reality app.

The museum was previously owned by Donie Cassidy, a Senator and former TD. It is now owned by Music Recording entrepreneur, Patrick Dunning, owner of Grouse Lodge Studios.

==Models==

In the previous Wax Museum building, there was a mixture of wax figures and various other figures that were not modelled in wax (mainly because the wax materials were not suited to such. For example: the character of The Lord of the Rings, Gollum is made from fibre glass rather than wax). This can be to do with problems relating to the figure&#x27;s weight and skin tones (wax is a heavy material and also useful for a basis of realistic human skin tones) or simply on the artist&#x27;s style of work.

The front of the building bore a striking mythical Irish giant. At the entrance were some figures including Gollum. The path through the museum brings visitors to a scene with figures such as Crocodile Dundee, E.T., and Irish sporting and entertainment stars. It went upstairs through a winding staircase, surrounding a jack in the beanstalk scene, complete with giant. From there, visitors entered the Children&#x27;s World (with the head of the outside Giant peaking in), and witness various storybook characters, and children&#x27;s television show characters. Main attractions here were tunnels in which children could crawl through, the Flintstones, the Power Rangers, and Bob the Builder.

Visitors would then move downstairs to witness a scene of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, then on to view many Irish figures of historical importance including Wolfe Tone, the 1916 Rising, and Michael Collins. Following this were various Irish presidents including Éamon de Valera, Mary McAleese, and Taoisigh. This led on towards figures of Irish theatre, writers, television presenters and G.A.A. stars. Moving from Irish figures to famous world leaders and figures such as Princess Diana, World War II leaders, modern American and Middle-Eastern and Northern Irish leaders of the Northern troubles. Then visitors could witness a re-enactment of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Last Supper&quot; painting in three-dimensional wax form.

As visitors went downstairs again, they passed Christopher Reeve as Superman, and see the Pope and Cardinals standing on top of the actual Popemobile from Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to Ireland in 1979. Visitors then entered a room with the Simpsons family while a screen would play a film for people to sit down and enjoy or take a photo opportunity in a set of medieval stocks. Visitors were then given a choice to enter the Chamber of horrors (or bypass it and enter the next phase after it), with horror characters such as Dracula, Frankenstein, the Werewolf and the Mummy. Also displayed were figures like Hannibal Lecter as he rattled prison bars, the X-files alien, and Freddy Krueger, amongst others.

Visitors then entered another tunnel opportunity for children again and then onto the &quot;Hall of Megastars&quot; with figures like Michael Jackson, David Bowie, U2, Tina Turner, Ronan Keating, and Irish rock star Phil Lynott taking the stage. The tour then ended with entertaining scenes dedicated to Batman with Jack Nicholson as the Joker, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, and Star Wars with Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn in battle with Darth Maul as well as Yoda and young Anakin Skywalker.

==Wax figure damages==
In June 2007, while the wax figures were in storage awaiting a new home, break-ins occurred in the warehouses. Many figures were damaged by vandals, including smashed heads. There were also a number of figures stolen including Bob the Builder as well as many army-style uniforms from scenes such as the 1916 Rising. This incident created even harder circumstances in which to try relocate the Wax Museum. The museum&#x27;s head sculptor, P.J. Heraty was assigned the job of revamping and often, recreating the broken figures.

<doc id="1014110" wikidata="Q7592302" url="?curid=1014110" title="St Aloysius' College (Sydney)">
<text>St Aloysius&#x27; College is an independent Catholic primary and secondary day school for boys, located in Kirribilli, a suburb on the Lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Founded in 1879 by Joseph Dalton SJ at St Kilda House, Woolloomooloo, St Aloysius&#x27; is the oldest independent Catholic boys day school in New South Wales. The College is conducted in the Jesuit tradition by the Society of Jesus as part of a worldwide network of schools and universities, which Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Order, began in Messina, Sicily, in 1548. The College has an academically selective enrolment policy and catered to approximately 1,251 students from Year 3 to Year 12 (7 to 18 years).

St Aloysius&#x27; is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), and is the oldest of the six schools which make up the Combined Associated Schools (CAS).

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
Following the 1877 closure of Lyndhurst school, a Roman Catholic school for boys in Glebe, there was no Catholic college for boys in the area. Roger Bede Vaughan, the second Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, was petitioned by the community to set up a school; Joseph Dalton was sent to Sydney by the Superior, Cahill, in answer to a request from Vaughan.

Towards the end of 1878, Dr Dalton returned to Sydney with Kennedy to seek a site, first for a city day school and later, if possible, a site for a boarding school. After much discussion and searching, a property known as &quot;St Kilda House&quot; on the corner of Cathedral Street and Palmer Street in Woolloomooloo was rented at £260 per annum. The property had been built in 1844 by Charles Scott on part of a grant made to John Palmer, purser on the First Fleet ship , it was a Georgian style mansion with fifteen rooms. The building has since been demolished.

St Kilda House was blessed by the Archbishop and its first 45 pupils admitted on 3 February 1879. By the end of 1879, enrolments had increased to 115.

===Darlinghurst===
It soon became clear that the school site and its surroundings were not ideal for a college. The students had been experiencing transport difficulties and the children of the local area resented the intrusion of &quot;college boys&quot;, expressing themselves accordingly. Subsequently, in September 1883, the College moved to a property known as &quot;Auburn Villa&quot; in Bourke Street, Darlinghurst, with classes resuming on 17 September. This property had been purchased from the Iredale family for £6,975, and though the house had just eleven rooms, the area offered considerable advantages. The name &quot;Auburn Villa&quot; was changed on purchase to St Aloysius, the patron of youth, and a new wing was built shortly after at a cost of £5,000. The building was later demolished to make way for St Margaret&#x27;s Maternity Hospital.

Student numbers grew considerably towards the end of the century. In letters to the Jesuit Superior, Rectors constantly pleaded for more staff, telling of their constant financial struggle to exist.

===Milsons Point===
Across Sydney Harbour, the Society of Jesus had taken control of the parish of St Mary&#x27;s, North Sydney. A small, stone church in Jeffrey Street, Kirribilli, built in 1863 by Congregationalists, Wesleyans and Anglicans had fallen into disuse due to lack of a congregation. This church was purchased by the Jesuits in 1880 to serve the district of Kirribilli and Milsons Point, but the priests at North Sydney were finding it difficult to attend to their large parish. Cardinal Moran, Archbishop of Sydney, urged the Jesuits to move the College from Bourke Street to a site near the church in order to give regular service to the Catholics of the area.

In 1902, a property adjoining the church was rented for £225 and a few years later purchased for £4,500. The area was small – about three-quarters of an acre, however, the building with a crenellated tower and lace iron balconies was set in picturesque surroundings and featured an uninterrupted view of the Harbour. St Aloysius&#x27; College officially commenced classes here on 2 February 1903, with fewer than 50 students.

Before long enrolments again increased and additional accommodation became an urgent need. A wooden building was hastily erected, housing classrooms and study hall until it was replaced in 1907/1908 by a three-storeyed brick building later known as the &quot;Junior School&quot;. As student numbers increased, additional rooms again became necessary and in 1913/1914 a new wing was constructed on the eastern side of the original residence. In 1916, a property opposite the College, known as &quot;Wyalla&quot;, came on the market. Money was eventually borrowed and Wyalla became the &quot;Senior School&quot;. As with most schools, war casualties among old boys were heavy.

In the early 1920s, a property off Sailors Bay Road, Northbridge, was purchased as a site for much-needed playing fields. This property remained undeveloped due to the lack of excavating and levelling techniques and machinery at the time. Had this plan materialised, it would today be a very valuable asset, however, it was sold in 1939 and provided finance for the purchase of some market gardens in Tyneside Avenue, East Willoughby, which forms the current College Sports Ground.

The war years brought a significant drop in numbers, and the College was forced to pile sandbags to prevent blasts from anticipated Japanese bombs, and strong, wooden fortifications were constructed to prevent roofs collapsing. Following the war, the number of pupils increased more rapidly than the development of accommodation, and by the late fifties, it was clear that a major decision on the College&#x27;s future was no longer avoidable. There appeared to be only three available options: one was to close down the College gradually, an unpopular choice, however, had it proved to be the only possible one, the machinery was ready to implement it; The second was to find another suitable site in the vicinity and to make a fresh start. No site comparable with the present one was available, and subsequently part of the Jesuit owned property in Pymble was suggested as a possible location. The financial commitment involved in such a move was more than the College could carry. An invitation came from Archbishop Eris O&#x27;Brien to move the College to Canberra where and financial assistance were available, however, after much debate this offer was turned down; The third possible option was to stay at Milsons Point and to re-develop the site. The representative of the Jesuit General, John McMahon, who was then visiting Australia, and the Provincial Superior, Jeremiah Hogan, favoured this option as being in the best interests of the Catholic community and of the College.

In 1961, with the help of Mr G J Dusseldorp, the co-operation of the Commonwealth Bank and the support of Hogan, the College began the task of rebuilding. The limitations of the site and the fact that existing buildings could not be demolished beforehand, restricted the Rector, John Casey, in his plan and the architect, Mr Robert Metcalfe, in his design. In approximately ten years, with the support of the College community, four stages of construction were completed. A notable change in design was the alteration of the Campus&#x27; main hall, named &quot;the Great Hall&quot;. The initial intent for this space was to be a theatre or concert hall. This was forgone and instead made to be a basketball court, much to the dismay of the music society of the school. Had the original design gone through it would have been a noticeably large recital space. In spite of this plan not having come to fruition, the evidence of it is visible in the architecture of the inside of the Hall.

To celebrate its centenary in 1979, the College began the fifth and final building stage. It involved demolishing the freestanding former church built in 1863 and used by various denominations until the Jesuits obtained the building in 1903 to be used as a parish church and named it Star of the Sea. Its use as the school chapel was discontinued in 1965 when the current chapel, named the College Chapel, was constructed as the second stage of the rebuilding. It was built as a modern chapel and completely designed in the spirit of the Vatican II reforms. The original chapel had acted as an art room until 1981 when it was demolished. The stone of it was reused to form the eastern wall of the playground and the evidence of the original church can be seen by the statue of Mary that is seen among the vegetation.

The new buildings evident from this final stage include the new housing administration, entrance gates, canteen, library, study room, community rooms, and classrooms, was opened in 1981. Despite the completion of this stage, there was still insufficient room to house the College. For some years, assisted by the proposal of building the Harbour Tunnel, investigations were undertaken to see if it was possible to again move. In 1991, a decision was reached to purchase the Milsons Point Primary School and to develop a Junior School Campus. Construction of the Junior School Campus commenced in 1992, and in 1993 it was blessed and opened.

In order to provide more space for the College, the Jesuit community left the main building for a community house in Jeffrey Street in 1995. The top two floors were renovated to accommodate Year 12, while renovations for a new Senior School on the Wyalla site took place. At the commencement of the school year in 1997, the Senior School, accommodating Years 11 and 12 was opened and blessed by the Governor-General of Australia, Sir William Deane, the provincial of the Society of Jesus, Daven Day SJ and the Auxiliary Bishop of Sydney, David Cremin DD.

In 2002, the St Aloysius College Foundation successfully purchased the choir organ in St Joseph&#x27;s Basilica in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada after good fortune brought the news of its sale to the College. This was fortunate because by the late 1990s the previous organ, constructed in 1969 by James P. Eagles, had become unreliable and found to be inadequate for the demands placed upon it. The reason for this was undetermined however the likely theory is that it was old and, being of electronic action, likely obsolete. In the same year of its purchase, the new organ was successfully dismantled, moved and reassembled in Australia by Pitchford and Garside. Unfortunately, this was the last project undertaken by the late Stuart Garside due to his saddening untimely pass on site, just as the installation reached its completion. The Eagles organ was sold privately and removed shortly afterwards. Credit for the successful installation of the organ goes to many including the College Foundation for financing the project, Mr Peter Kneeshaw the Organ Consultant for the project and Mr Michael Hissey the Director of Music at the time. Upon completion of the project, it was easily found that the organ had found a good home, with the extreme height of the case fitting neatly under the ceiling with a few centimetres to spare, a live acoustic and, most importantly, a number of talented people who use it daily. Such uses include accompaniment of whole school masses, which at some times numbers to over 1000 people. It is also used for private lessons for keen individuals and as a practice instrument for said individuals to continually improve. It is also occasionally used for external organ examinations and competitions.

=== Rozelle Campus (SACR) ===
In 2020, the then current principal (Mark Tannock) proposed to move all Year 9 students to a campus in Rozelle, as a part of &quot;Plan Magis&quot;. In 2023, the proposition was planned to go ahead but the move was later delayed by 1 Term, as construction moved slower than anticipated. The Year 9 students are now staying at Rozelle, becoming a permanent campus of St Aloysius College. It became known generally as SACR (St Aloysius College Rozelle). This establishment has become a permanent part of the Aloysius experience, providing different teaching styles to the main campus. This aims to make sure students in Year 9 stay dedicated to their learning. Part of the Rozelle experience is a camp, a retreat, dance with Loreto and other activities with schools such as St. Scholastica&#x27;s. The Rozelle experience also includes alternative subjects including Human Stories (English, Religion and History), The World Around Us (Science and Geography), and Contemplatives in Action (CIA - an additional elective path).

=== Head of school ===
In the early days, Jesuit colleges were headed by a Rector, who was also a Superior of the Jesuit community. The Rector was assisted by a Prefect of Studies, who attended to the day-to-day running of the school, especially concerning the curriculum and discipline. In the Australian Province, the 1970s saw the role of Headmaster become separated from that of Superior. Rectors and Superiors normally have a fixed term in canon law of six years; Headmasters&#x27; terms are indefinite. In 2003, the structure returned to the older dispensation, with the title of Prefect of Studies replaced with Principal. 2014 saw the appointment of the College&#x27;s first-ever lay principal with Mark Tannock being appointed to the role following the end of Chris Middleton&#x27;s tenure. This break in tradition was due to the increased strain on Jesuit responsibilities due to the ongoing decrease in. On 7 March 2024, Mr Mark Tannock announced that he will transition into the principal role at St Ignatius Riverview at the end of the 2024 calendar year.

: From 2003 until 2018, the roles of Headmaster and Principal were appointed concurrently.

==Jesuit education==
St Aloysius&#x27; College is conducted by the Jesuit Order and is part of a worldwide network of approximately 1000 Jesuit primary and secondary schools and universities. The first school was commenced by St. Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Order, in 1548.

A Jesuit education stresses the acquisition of skills and techniques in a purposeful and balanced perspective. While emphasis is placed on the development of intellectual and mental skills, attention is also given to other aspects of personal formation, such as character, attitudes, values and social interaction.

The aim of a Jesuit education is as follows: &quot;Our ideal is the well-rounded person who is intellectually competent, open to growth, religious, loving and committed to doing justice in generosity to the people of God.&quot;

Its brother schools include Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview and Loyola College, Mount Druitt in Sydney, Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Adelaide in Athelstone and Xavier College in Melbourne.

<text>The Uppsala–DLR Asteroid Survey (UDAS, also known as UAO–DLR Asteroid Survey) is an astronomical survey, dedicated for the search and follow–up characterization of asteroids and comets. UDAS puts a special emphasis on near-Earth objects (NEOs) in co-operation and support of global efforts in NEO-research, initiated by the &quot;Working Group on Near-Earth Objects&quot; of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), and the Spaceguard Foundation. UDAS began regular observations in September 1999, with some test runs during 1998. Discoveries of NEOs are reported to the Minor Planet Center (MPC).

It is a kind of follow-on programme to ODAS, which had to close due to lack of further financial support. It should also not be confused with the Uppsala–DLR Trojan Survey (UDTS), which was conducted a few years before UDAS was launched.

UAO stands for Uppsala Astronomical Observatory, Uppsala, Sweden. DLR stands for the Deutschen Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, the &quot;German Aerospace Center&quot;.

The founder of Lap Power Claes Wellton-Persson has contributed to the project.

== List of discovered minor planets ==
The MPC credits the Uppsala–DLR Asteroid Survey with the discovery of the following numbered minor planets during 1999–2005.

<doc id="1014113" wikidata="Q430740" url="?curid=1014113" title="Paul Merson">
<text>Paul Charles Merson (born 20 March 1968) is an English former professional footballer, manager, commentator and sports television pundit for Sky Sports.

Originally a forward, Merson found success as an attacking midfielder and playmaker later in his career. After making his debut for Arsenal in the 1986–87 season, Merson went on to play eleven seasons with the North London club. While with the Gunners, Merson was a key player in the club&#x27;s success under Scottish manager George Graham, winning the Football League Championship twice, the FA Cup, the Football League Cup, and the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In 1997, he joined Middlesbrough, helping the club gain promotion to the Premier League and finish as runner-up in the 1997–98 Football League Cup. After joining Aston Villa in 1998, Merson went on to become club captain and played for the team in the 2000 FA Cup final, the last to be held at the original Wembley Stadium. In 2002, he signed for second-tier Portsmouth and captained the club to the First Division Championship title and promotion to the Premier League. A year later, he returned to the West Midlands with Walsall, where he went on to serve as player-manager until he was sacked in February 2006.

Merson was capped 21 times for the England national football team and represented the nation at UEFA Euro 1992 and the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

==Club career==

===Arsenal===
Born on 20 March 1968 in Harlesden, North West London, Merson started his career at Arsenal, joining the club as an apprentice in 1984. After a loan spell at Brentford, then under manager Frank McLintock, he made his debut for the Gunners on 22 November 1986 against Manchester City, and gradually established himself in George Graham&#x27;s successful Arsenal side of the late 1980s. By the 1988–89 season he was a regular on the right wing, at the end of which Arsenal secured the First Division title with a stoppage time Michael Thomas goal in the final game of the season against Liverpool at Anfield. Merson scored ten times that season, made his debut for the England U21 team, and was voted PFA Young Player of the Year.

In 1991, Merson achieved another league championship with Arsenal and had the highest goalscoring season of his career with 13 goals. He also won a double of the FA Cup and League Cup in 1993, scoring in the 1993 Football League Cup Final against Sheffield Wednesday. A year later, he helped Arsenal win its first European trophy in 24 years as the Gunners defeated Parma in Copenhagen to win the 1993–94 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

Merson&#x27;s career was put on the line in November 1994 when he admitted to having addictions to alcohol, cocaine and gambling. The Football Association arranged for Merson to undergo a three-month rehabilitation programme and he returned to the side in February 1995, just before the dismissal of George Graham as manager. Under caretaker manager Stewart Houston, Merson helped Arsenal reach the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final for the second season in a row, where Arsenal lost to Real Zaragoza at the Parc des Princes in Paris.

In 1995–96, Merson remained a regular first team player under Arsenal&#x27;s new manager Bruce Rioch and continued to play regularly during the 1996–97 season following the appointment of Arsène Wenger. In a somewhat surprising move, at the end of the 1996–97 Premiership campaign, in which Arsenal finished third, Merson was sold to relegated Middlesbrough in a £4.5million deal – making him the most expensive player ever signed by a non-Premiership club. Wenger had offered Merson a new two-year contract, but Merson elected to join Middlesbrough for a longer contract. Merson played 423 times for Arsenal and scored 99 goals in all competitions.

In 2008, Merson was ranked the 26th greatest Arsenal player of all time in a fan poll published by the club&#x27;s official website.

===Middlesbrough===
In the summer of 1997, Merson left the Gunners to sign for relegated Middlesbrough for a reported fee believed to be £4.5 million. Merson said he was offered a new contract at Arsenal but turned it down for a longer contract and higher wages at Middlesbrough. When telling Arsene Wenger of his decision, Merson claims Wenger told him he would be paid more at Middlesbrough than Dennis Bergkamp was paid at Arsenal. Merson made his league debut for Boro on the opening day in a 2–1 victory over Charlton Athletic. He played a key role in helping Boro return to the Premier League and was nicknamed by fans as &quot;The Magic Man&quot;. Merson&#x27;s form with Boro also won him a place in England&#x27;s squad for 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. Whilst at Middlesbrough he played in the 1998 Football League Cup Final. During the start of the 1998–99 season Merson stated he was home sick and wanted a return South. Middlesbrough later agreed to Merson&#x27;s request and he was sold to Aston Villa for £6.75million.

===Aston Villa===
Merson scored on his Villa debut, converting from his own missed penalty. Merson said in an interview that playing at Villa was the best part of his career. He scored a &#x27;wonder goal&#x27; winner versus Everton away from forty-five yards out in November 2000. Merson played a key creative role in the Villa side and helped them to the FA Cup Final in 2000, where they lost 1–0 to Chelsea.

===Portsmouth===
Merson signed for Division 1 club Portsmouth on a two-year contract in August 2002, and was instrumental in the club&#x27;s promotion to the Premiership in 2002–03. Merson, however, felt that he was too old for a return to the Premiership, and wanted to move closer to his home in the West Midlands. In July 2003 he signed a two-year deal at Walsall in the First Division, paying compensation to Portsmouth for his remaining year of contract.

===Walsall===
In February 2004, Merson admitted himself to the Sierra Tucson Clinic in Arizona to seek help for his gambling addiction under the advice and financial backing of the PFA, and missed several key games whilst Walsall slipped in the league from mid table mediocrity into the relegation zone. However, a couple of months after his return, Merson was quickly thrown into the manager&#x27;s spot at Walsall following Colin Lee&#x27;s sacking for allegedly having talks with Plymouth Argyle over a vacant manager&#x27;s position there. Merson led a bid to retain Division One status, but was hindered by a last-minute penalty against Crystal Palace, and eventually relegated after a 3–2 victory against Rotherham United whilst having to rely on Stoke City beating Gillingham on the final day. The following month, despite relegation, Merson was rewarded with the manager&#x27;s job on a permanent basis.

The 2004–05 season proved to be a difficult season for Merson, on and off the field. Walsall went out of all cup competitions against lower league teams, and it was reported that Merson had had a rift with his wife, and had started drinking and gambling again, whilst the press reported on him inviting goalkeeper Mark Bosnich back into the game. Walsall slipped close to a second consecutive relegation. Merson responded by making several key signings on transfer deadline day; Julian Joachim, Andy Oakes, Anthony Gerrard (cousin of Steven Gerrard), Craig Pead and David Perpetuini. Merson&#x27;s side went undefeated during May 2005, securing League One status for another year.

After a difficult first season in management, Merson&#x27;s position at Walsall looked more secure as the club entered the 2005–06 season; however, he was unable to lift Walsall out of the relegation zone, and with the club in 19th place, he was sacked on 6 February 2006 after his Walsall side lost 5–0 to Brentford at Griffin Park.

===Tamworth===
Despite a number of offers from clubs as high as the Championship, Merson decided to drop down the leagues and play for part-time Conference club Tamworth, which surprised many but enthralled the Tamworth fans. However, the arrangement meant that until the end of the season, the majority of Merson&#x27;s wages were to be paid by the club he used to manage, Walsall. Merson played just once, in the 2–1 home loss to Halifax Town. He was dropped to the bench for the following game, a 5–0 defeat away to Grays Athletic. Merson later announced his retirement from professional football as a player on 9 March 2006, less than a month after joining Tamworth.

===Later career===
On 28 March 2012, he made a one-off appearance for Mid Wales Football League side Welshpool Town, playing alongside fellow Sky Sports pundit Chris Kamara against Newbridge-on-Wye. Merson scored the opening goal in the 4–1 defeat at the Maes y Dre Recreation Ground. On 11 October 2017, Merson signed for Welsh Football League Division Three team Caerau. Following international clearance, he made his debut on 18 October against Pontyclun. In December 2019, Merson joined Hanworth Villa in the Combined Counties League Premier Division, making two appearances for the Villains in total.

==International career==

===Euro 1992===
Merson first played for the England national team in 1991, being called up by Graham Taylor. He made his debut for the full England side, in a friendly against Germany on 11 September 1991. He participated in the 1992 European Championships in Sweden. He played in the opening 0–0 draw with Denmark. England went out after another 0–0 draw against the French and a 2–1 loss to hosts Sweden.

===1994 World Cup qualifying===
Merson also played a part in the failed campaign to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He played in the opening game, a 1–1 home draw with Norway. He next played against the Netherlands as a substitute for Paul Gascoigne who was injured. England were leading 2–1, but crucially conceded a late penalty for a 2–2 draw. Merson also played in the 1993 US Cup against Brazil and Germany, nearly scoring in a 2–1 defeat to the later, Bodo Illgner saving from a 20-yard shot. He returned for the critical and controversial 2–0 defeat against the Dutch in Rotterdam. Merson nearly equalised the opening Dutch goal, and hit the post with an excellent free-kick.

England failed to qualify for the World Cup. Taylor&#x27;s successor, Terry Venables, told Merson that he would not get into the team owing to his life style of heavy drinking. In his book, &quot;How Not to be a Professional Footballer&quot;, Merson refers to an incident in Chicago while on duty with England during the US Cup. After drinking he wandered off into the city on his own. Merson ended up in a dangerous area and was involved in trying to break up a fight while very drunk himself. When the combatants turned on Merson, he fled back to the hotel. The next morning the FBI came to the hotel and briefed the players on the dangers in the city. They expressed surprise that Merson was not injured in the incident.

===1998 World Cup ===
Merson held the distinction of being the only player in England&#x27;s 1998 FIFA World Cup squad not to play for a top flight club. In that tournament, he played in England&#x27;s famous second round match against Argentina, coming off the bench and scoring in the penalty shoot-out, although England eventually lost. Later he said if England had won their penalty shoot-out he believed England would have won the World Cup.

1998 marked the end of Merson&#x27;s international career after 21 full caps in seven years, in which he scored three times.

==Media career==
In August 2006, he commenced a column for the official Arsenal FC magazine. He also continues to play for the England Legends, a 16-man squad of former internationals who have played Italy, Germany, Scotland, Ireland, and the rest of the world. Merson&#x27;s main job is on Sky Sports, where he is a match reporter and regular pundit for Gillette Soccer Saturday. Merson is often the target of good-humoured jabs from Jeff Stelling and other members of the Soccer Saturday panel; for example, in his attempts to pronounce the names of foreign players. However, Stelling himself, in September 2016, attempted to have Merson agree with him that Ireland international Harry Arter (who had made his debut against England) should get an England call-up in the week Gareth Southgate took over in an emergency capacity following Sam Allardyce&#x27;s dismissal.

Merson writes a weekly column for the &quot;Daily Star&quot;″s &#x27;Seriously Football&#x27; pullout every Saturday and predicts scores for the weeks premier league games called &#x27;Merson Predicts&#x27;.

From the 2012–2015 season Merson co-hosted with John Fendley on the Sky Sports TV programme &#x27;Fantasy Football Club&#x27;. From the start of the 2015 season Max Rushden took on co presenting after John Fendley returned to Soccer AM as a co-host. Fantasy Football Club is aired weekly on Friday evenings at 6pm. Both co-hosts also co-managed a fantasy team in the Sky Fantasy &#x27;Celebrities&#x27; League.

In 2019, Merson won the second series of the 5Star competition &quot;Celebs on the Farm&quot;. From September 2024, Merson was a contestant on the twenty-second series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and was partnered with Karen Hauer. The couple remained until week 5 when, on 20 October 2024, they lost in the dance-off.

==Personal life ==
Born in Harlesden, North West London, Merson supported Chelsea growing up, and has remained a fan throughout his career.

He has been married three times (to Lorraine, Louise and now Kate), and has eight children, including one set of twin girls. His first marriage crumbled under his recovery from drug addiction and alcoholism.

In October 2011, Merson was involved in a car crash with a lorry on the M40 motorway near Warwick and arrested for drink-driving.

While appearing on &quot;Harry&#x27;s Heroes: The Full English&quot;, a 2019 ITV documentary, Merson opened up about how substance abuse and gambling have affected his life, and his continued struggles with addictions. He received praise for his candid discussion of the topic. In the second series Merson confided in former Arsenal teammate, goalkeeper David Seaman, that he voluntarily attends Alcoholics Anonymous, including English speaking meetings in Paris, during breaks in filming for ITV&#x27;s Harry&#x27;s Heroes: Euro...Having a Laugh, football tour S2.Ep1.

Merson participated in the Mental Health Awareness Week. In January 2020, Merson spoke about how his drink, drug and gambling habits fuelled his struggles with mental health.

In February 2024, Merson was probed by the Advertising Standards Authority for misconduct while promoting and advertising Supreme CBD, owned by ex-boxer Anthony Fowler. Fowler along with other celebrities including Merson, Matt Le Tissier and John Hartson have all been investigated and issued with a warning by the ASA. The ASA investigation concluded that their social media posts have been found to be commercial in nature, and not &quot;honest&quot; opinions about the benefits of CBD, since they were being financially rewarded for their posts. The investigation also concluded that the posts made by these celebrities were making unlawful medical claims about the use of CBD, which is prohibited by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

In May 2024, Merson was banned from driving for six months following a series of speeding offences.

During a Thanksgiving NFL show on Sky in November 2024, Merson revealed that he is a fan of the New York Jets.

<doc id="1014117" wikidata="Q5810069" url="?curid=1014117" title="Same-sex marriage in Nova Scotia">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in Nova Scotia since September 24, 2004 when the province began issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples immediately following a court ruling from the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. Nova Scotia was the sixth jurisdiction in Canada and the ninth in the world, after the Netherlands, Belgium, Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Massachusetts, Yukon and Manitoba, to legalise same-sex marriage.

==Background==

In November 2000, the Nova Scotia House of Assembly approved the &quot;Law Reform (2000) Act&quot;, which legalised domestic partnerships in Nova Scotia. The Act was assented by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, Myra Freeman, and went into force on June 4, 2001. Domestic partnerships grant cohabiting couples many of the rights and obligations of marriage, including pension benefits, inheritance, and the ability to divide property or other assets at separation or death. These partnerships differ from common law marriages in that they are registered with the state and the property rights of domestic partners are better defined. Both partners must be 19 or older, resident in Nova Scotia for the past 3 months, and not currently married or in a partnership with another individual. Both opposite-sex and same-sex couples can enter into a domestic partnership.

In July 2001, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court concluded that the provision in the &quot;Adoption Act&quot; which prevented common-law couples from adopting was unconstitutional; the result been that common-law couples, either same-sex or opposite-sex, are now able to adopt children jointly. Madame Justice Deborah Gass ruled that &quot;prohibiting a joint adoption where all the evidence indicates these adults are providing optimum care and loving... defeats the very purpose of the legislation&quot;. A spokeswoman for Egale Canada said, &quot;It really is a victory for the expansion of the definition of family and that courts recognize families exist beyond married couples and their children.&quot;

==Court ruling==
Following the court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage in Yukon in July 2004, Sean Foreman, the chairperson of a local LGBT group, said &quot;We are now considering a change in strategy, to proceed with a similar application in Nova Scotia in the near future, rather than wait for the &quot;Reference&quot;.&quot; Foreman also asked the federal and provincial attorneys general, Irwin Cotler and Michael Baker, to &quot;immediately begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples&quot;, but this was not successful. On August 13, 2004, three same-sex couples brought the suit &quot;Boutilier et al. v. Canada (A.G) and Nova Scotia (A.G)&quot; against the provincial and federal governments requesting that they be issued marriage licences. The partners who brought the suit were Brian Mombourquette and Ross Boutelier, Kim Vance and Samantha Meehan (who had married in Toronto in 2003 and sought recognition of their marriage at home in Nova Scotia), and Ron and Bryan Garnett-Doucette. The couples were represented by Foreman, also a lawyer at the law firm Wickwire Holm in Halifax. Premier John Hamm said the provincial government would not oppose the court bid.

On September 24, 2004, Justice Heather Robertson of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruled that the ban on same-sex marriages violated the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; and ordered the province to recognize same-sex unions. Ron and Bryan Garnett-Doucette were the first same-sex couple to obtain a marriage licence in Nova Scotia, receiving a licence in Halifax just hours after the ruling was handed down. They said, &quot;We feel really, really good. It&#x27;s a great day to be a Nova Scotian.&quot; Neither the federal nor the provincial governments opposed the ruling, continuing the trend set with the Yukon and Manitoba rulings. Attorney General Baker said, &quot;We certainly did not want to waste taxpayers&#x27; money&quot;, and Premier Hamm said the province would abide by the court&#x27;s decision. Leader of the Opposition Darrell Dexter praised the court ruling. Terrence Prendergast, the Archbishop of Halifax, condemned the court decision, stating that &quot;marriage is a natural institution that precedes all social, legal and religious systems&quot;, &quot;We must recognize this decision as the end of state support for marriage as we have always known it.&quot;

==Provincial legislation==
An odd proviso to the post-ruling status was that, until a formal change to the provincial &quot;Solemnization of Marriage Act&quot;, the Minister of Justice still required the terms &quot;husband and wife&quot; to be used by justices of the peace in any wedding. This stance by the Justice Ministry was categorised by some as heterosexist. Shortly afterwards, following warnings of further legal action by the couples&#x27; lawyer, the policy was changed to remove that requirement. The &quot;Solemnization of Marriage Act&quot; (; ; Scottish Gaelic: ), however, was not modified to this effect. Only in October 2017 did the House of Assembly approve a bill replacing references to &quot;husband and wife&quot; in the Act with the gender-neutral term &quot;spouses&quot;. The bill passed its third reading on 20 October and received royal assent by Lieutenant Governor Arthur LeBlanc six days later.

==Marriage statistics==
The 2016 Canadian census showed that there were 2,250 same-sex couples living in Nova Scotia. 126 same-sex marriages were solemnised in the province in 2017, accounting for 3% of all marriages, with 87 (69%) of these being between lesbian couples.

==Religious performance==
In July 2019, the synod of the Anglican Church of Canada passed a resolution known as &quot;A Word to the Church&quot;, allowing its dioceses to choose whether to bless and perform same-sex marriages. In September of the same year, Bishop Ron Cutler of the Diocese of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island issued a pastoral letter allowing local parishes to perform same-sex marriages.

Some other religious organisations also perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, including the United Church of Canada, Quakers, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Canadian Unitarian Council. The First Baptist Church in Halifax also performs same-sex marriages, and in April 2023 ordained its first married lesbian minister.
