<text>Groovie Goolies is an American animated television show that had its original run Saturday mornings on CBS between 1970 and 1972. It was rebroadcast the following season on Sunday mornings. Set at a decrepit castle, the show focused on its monstrous but good-natured and mostly friendly inhabitants. Created by Filmation, &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot; was an original creation of the studio; its characters would cross over with Filmation&#x27;s Archie Comics adaptations including &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; and &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, as well as with the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cast.

==Premise==
The Goolies were a group of hip monsters residing at Horrible Hall (a haunted boarding house for monsters) on Horrible Drive. Many of the characters referred to each other as cousins. Most of the Goolies were (in look and sound) pop-culture echoes of the classic horror-film monsters created in the 1930s and 1940s, mostly by Universal Pictures. Shows consisted of fast-cut sequences of pun-filled jokes and short skits, and each episode included two pop songs, one performed by &quot;The Monster Trio&quot; (Drac, Frankie and Wolfie) and a closing number crooned by one of a rotating roster of guest bands.

==Characters==
* Drac (voiced by Larry Storch) – the short-tempered vampire who is the head of Horrible Hall. He plays the pipe organ in the Groovie Goolies that has arms where the music sheets would go. At the beginning of each episode where the viewer is welcomed to Horrible Hall, Drac in his bat form would try to fly into the window, only to crash into the wall when the window moves. Upon crash-landing, Drac would say &quot;This place is driving me batty&quot;.
* Frankie (voiced by Howard Morris) – an easygoing Frankenstein&#x27;s monster who headed the Muscle-leum Gymnasium. He plays the bone xylophone/drums in the Groovie Goolies. Often would be zapped by lightning, revealing his inner mechanical workings, and then remarking &quot;I needed that!!&quot; Frankie also had a dual identity as the inept superhero &quot;Super Ghoul&quot; (as seen in the song of the same name).
** Rover – Frankie&#x27;s pet sauropod-type dinosaur.
* Wolfie (voiced by Howard Morris) – a hippie werewolf that speaks in a combination of beatnik, surfer, and hippie slang. Wolfie plays a lyre-like stringed instrument in the Groovie Goolies and is always seen wearing a T-shirt, shorts, and beach sandals. Wolfie is always out for a good time like running wild, surfing, or driving his Wolf Wagon. He especially gets on Drac&#x27;s nerves.
** Fido – Wolfie&#x27;s pet piranha that eats anything and can fly when necessary.
* Hagatha (voiced by Larry Storch in episodes 1-13, Howard Morris in episodes 14-16) – a plump witch who served as the resident chef. She also has a living broom named Broomhilda and is the aunt of Hauntleroy.
* Bella La Ghostly (voiced by Jane Webb) – a female vampire who works as Horrible Hall&#x27;s switchboard operator.
* Sabrina Spellman (voiced by Jane Webb) - a witch who is a cousin of the Groovie Goolies.
* Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (voiced by Howard Morris) – the two-headed resident doctor who often fought as to which one of them was Jekyll and/or Hyde. The right head is a normal &quot;human&quot; doctor while the left head is a green-skinned &quot;monster&quot; doctor. As a result, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde have their own second opinion.
* Mummy (voiced by Howard Morris) – a bandaged mummy who dabbles in first aid. Mummy serves as the newsman for &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Wrap-Up&quot; newscasts. He would often become unraveled.
* Boneapart (voiced by Larry D. Mann) – a skittish skeleton in a Napoleon hat who had a tendency to fall apart.
* Ghoulihand (voiced by Larry Storch) – a giant, talking, disembodied glove.
* Ratso and Batso (voiced by Larry Storch in episodes 1-12, Dallas McKennon in episodes 13-16) – two fanged imp-like brats with a penchant for coming up with plans for swiping treats, as well as playing mean practical jokes that often backfired on them.
* Hauntleroy (voiced by Howard Morris) – a rotund, conniving, selfish and two-faced kid in a sailor suit who was often the primary foil for Ratso&#x27;s and Batso&#x27;s tricks. He is the nephew of Hagatha.
* Icky and Goo (voiced by Larry Storch and Dallas McKennon) – two gargoyle-like creatures that seem to be the main pets of Horrible Hall. Icky is a blue gargoyle-like creature while Goo is a red gargoyle-like creature.
* Tiny Tomb – a diminutive, long-haired mummy with a high-pitched voice. He is the nephew of Mummy and the lead singer of the Mummies and the Puppies.
* Missy – an enigmatic mummified spook whose long, pink hair hides her face and body except for one large, blue eye. She is Tiny&#x27;s wife and a member of the Mummies and the Puppies.
* Mama Casket – a plump green mummy who is a member of The Mummies and the Puppies.
* Orville (vocal effects provided by Howard Morris) – a large thing-eating plant.
* The Spookoo Clock - a cuckoo clock that has a vulture coming out of it.
* The Ask-It Casket - a talking casket that answers any questions given to it.
* The Lovesick Loveseat - a living loveseat that especially has a crush on Drac.
* The Skelevator - an elevator shaped like a large human skull.

===Musical groups===
Every episode featured two musical segments. The first one is by the Groovie Goolies with Drac on the pipe organ, Wolfie playing a lyre-like stringed instrument, and Frankie on a drum set with a xylophone made of bones. The second musical segment is by one of the other resident bands, including:

* The Bare Bones Band – a band consisting of three living skeletons.
* The Mummies and the Puppies – a folk/pop group led by Tiny Tomb on guitar, with his wife Missy on tambourine, Mama Casket on drums and four puppies (two sharing a guitar, one on tambourine and one on piano). 
* The Rolling Headstones – a band consisting of three living tombstones. Their names are Hudson Rock, Captain Marble and General Granite.
* The Spirits of &#x27;76 – a band consisting of three ghosts who all wear tri-cornered hats.

==Production==
Thanks to television airings, the Universal Classic Monsters were having a resurgence of popularity in the 1960s and Filmation producer Lou Scheimer, who had grown up with the films, wanted to create a humorous animated adaptation. In 1968, Scheimer hired &quot;Laugh-In&quot; writers Jack Mendelsohn and Jim Mulligan to begin developing a show called &quot;Monster Inn&quot;, which would riff on the characters that Universal had popularized. Although some of their initial ideas fell by the wayside, the groundwork for &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot; was quickly laid, including having the monsters living together in a castle and the lead trio performing pop songs. Mendelsohn also had been raised with the Universal films, and claimed to have done most of the work on the show, while Mulligan &quot;took the money and ran&quot;.

In 1969, Fred Silverman, the Head of Children&#x27;s Programming at CBS asked for a companion to Filmation&#x27;s popular &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, so the company began developing a series for fellow Archie Comics character Sabrina the Teenage Witch, who had already appeared as a supporting character on the show. Silverman was also looking to exploit the overwhelming success of the network&#x27;s new cartoon &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, so he optioned Scheimer&#x27;s monster show, which went through a succession of titles before they settled on &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot;. Since both shows featured witches, the decision was made to package them together in an hour-long block. Interestingly, monsters had been common to the Archie&#x27;s Mad House comics, Sabrina&#x27;s actual origins.

&quot;Sabrina and the Groovie Goolies&quot; premiered in 1970, featuring two 15-minute segments of &quot;Sabrina&quot;, and a 30-minute block of &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot;, with the characters crossing over into both shows. During the inaugural season, it was the highest-rated children&#x27;s program, receiving a 54% audience share. This incarnation featured a variation of the &quot;Goolie Get-Together&quot; theme song which announced, &quot;It&#x27;s time for the Goolies and Sabrina!&quot;

In 1971, CBS split the two shows apart and paired reruns of &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot; with Tom and Jerry on Sunday mornings in an hour-long animation block, beginning on September 12. It was at this point that the more common &quot;Goolie Get-Together&quot; opening credits sequence was created, consisting of a montage of scenes from the song &quot;The Monster Trio&quot;. After a single season on Sundays, the show was canceled.

Despite the cancellation, CBS was not done with the &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot; yet. In 1972, they were bumped up to regulars on &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, appearing in half of that season&#x27;s episodes, which continued to be rerun until 1974. That same year, they also appeared on rival network ABC in a film entitled &quot;Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies&quot; (which was part of &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot;), teaming them with the Looney Tunes characters. This film also featured a brief, live-action sequence featuring some of the Goolies, including Frankie, Drac, Wolfie and Hauntleroy. ABC later rebroadcast the original series for one season in 1975, both on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The characters made their final original appearances in two episodes of NBC&#x27;s 1977 series &quot;The New Archie and Sabrina Hour&quot;, and Frankie was featured in that show&#x27;s closing credits.

In 1977, the show entered syndication as part of an anthology series entitled &quot;The Groovie Goolies and Friends&quot;, which featured over 104 half-hour episodes. &quot;The Groovie Goolies&quot; were packaged with several other Filmation series in shared rotation. The syndication format featured new opening credits and &quot;bumpers&quot; featuring the Goolies interacting with characters from the various shows, while the original end credits for each series was retained. The syndication package included &quot;The New Adventures of Waldo Kitty&quot; (minus the live-action sequences) (13 shows), &quot;Lassie&#x27;s Rescue Rangers&quot; (17 shows), &quot;The New Adventures of Gilligan&quot; (24 shows), &quot;My Favorite Martians&quot; (16 shows), and former &quot;Uncle Croc&#x27;s Block&quot; segments &quot;M.U.S.H.&quot; (&quot;Mangy Unwanted Shabby Heroes&quot;), &quot;Fraidy Cat&quot;, and &quot;Wacky and Packy&quot; (combined into 18 shows).

In 1978, Filmation planned to produce a &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot; feature film, but it never came to fruition. In 1984, the company decided to resurrect the property, developing two separate shows. &quot;&quot;Fright Camp&quot; was set at a summer camp and would have starred the Junior Goolies, the children of the pre-established Groovie Goolies. A second prospective show was titled &quot;The Goolies&quot; and would have featured the characters as toddlers. Neither series ever got past the development stage. For their 1986 &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; cartoon, Filmation borrowed many elements from the show, most notably the Skelevator, and they reused designs and animation of Drac and Bella La Ghostly in the episode &quot;The Girl Who Cried Vampire&quot;&quot;.
The cartoon aired with the UK version of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Banana Splits&quot; in the early 1980s. The show was translated into many languages and was broadcast globally, garnering numerous video releases in Germany and various other countries, spawning tie-in albums in different languages, and the show was so popular in France that the characters were featured on a float in France&#x27;s 1986 Carnaval de Cholet. The complete series was remastered and issued on DVD in the US in 2006. Since then, various episodes have surfaced on compilation DVDs, and discs have also been issued elsewhere around the globe. In May 2009, re-edited minisodes were released on the streaming site Crackle.

===Show structure===
The show was structured very much like the then-popular show &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, with several short segments of one-liner jokes and riddles. This was most shown by &quot;Weird Windows Time&quot;, a take-off on &quot;Laugh-In&quot;&#x27;s famous Joke Wall. Every so often, one of the Goolies had a special segment in which they instructed the audience about one thing or another, such as:

* Dracula&#x27;s Schoolhouse – a school that provides the finer points of (mad) science.
* Hagatha&#x27;s Bedtime Stories – Hagatha reads a popular fairy tale to Frankie at bedtime, with the other inhabitants in different parts.
* Home Movies – the inhabitants watch the home movies of their past activities.
* The Mummy&#x27;s Wrap-Up – a news program hosted by Mummy, who reports news revolving around monsters.
* Wolfie&#x27;s Theater – Wolfie re-enacts a popular fairy tale with some of the inhabitants, while the others watch.

==Episodes==
The scripts for the shows are untitled; they are differentiated only by episode number. When the series was issued on DVD, episodes were saddled with the title of one of the two featured songs.

===Special===
&quot;Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies&quot; is a one-off special that aired on &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot;.

===&quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;===
Following the cancellation of the show, the Goolies went on to be prominently featured in eight episodes (16 shorts) during the 1972-73 season of &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;.

===&quot;The New Archie and Sabrina Hour&quot;===
The Groovie Goolies made two final appearances in segments of &quot;The New Archie and Sabrina Hour&quot;.

==Musical releases==
===American version===

In late 1970 RCA Victor Records released the album Groovie Goolies (RCA LSP 4420). The cover is adorned with two photos of the album&#x27;s producers/musicians as the live-action Wolfie (Jeffrey Thomas), Frankie (Ed Fournier), and Drac (Dick Monda), as well as a small image of the animated monster trio.

All of the songs on the disc were written by Linda Martin and Sherry Gayden. &quot;We Go So Good Together&quot; and &quot;Spend Some Time Together&quot; are both original compositions that were never featured on the show. The only singles issued from the album were &quot;First Annual Semi-Formal Combination Celebration Meet-the-Monster Population Party&quot; and &quot;Save Your Good Lovin&#x27; For Me&quot;.

Monda reworked the lyrics of, and re-recorded, an additional song from the series, &quot;Chick-A-Boom (Don&#x27;t Ya Jes&#x27; Love It)&quot;, under the pseudonym Daddy Dewdrop in 1971. The tune was included on Dewdrop&#x27;s self-titled album and a single was released which peaked at #5 on the Cash Box Top 100 singles chart, which landed him on a list of One Hit Wonders at The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

===French version===
In 1983, a tie-in album was issued in France by Magical Ring Records under the show&#x27;s French title Les Croque Monstres. The only English-language song that was translated into French was the theme song, and a band performed the song to promote the album dressed as the show&#x27;s characters. The record includes a strange assortment of monster-themed tunes and covers of hits by artists such as Taxxi (&quot;Not Me Girl&quot;), Sylvester (&quot;Do Ya Wanna Funk&quot;), and The Doobie Brothers (&quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;&quot;). The album was reissued on CD in 2013 by Balthazar Music with a slightly different track order.

===Czechoslovakian version===
In 1992, Bonton Records issued a pair of albums titled Bubušou 1 and 2. Combined, the two albums include renditions of all 33 of the songs featured on the show, with Czech lyrics adapted by Jiří Josek.

====&quot;Bubušou 2&quot;====
==Home video==
All of the Groovie Goolies&#x27; appearances have been issued on video in various regions around the world, with the exceptions of the live-action sequence in &quot;Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies&quot; and the syndicated &quot;Groovie Goolies and Friends&quot; show.

==History==

The arrondissement of Sens was created in 1800. In 1926 it was expanded with part of the former arrondissement of Joigny (the former cantons of Cerisiers, Saint-Julien-du-Sault and Villeneuve-sur-Yonne). In August 1973 the cantons of Sens-Nord-Est, Sens-Ouest and Sens-Sud-Est were created from the former cantons of Sens-Nord and Sens-Sud. At the January 2017 reorganisation of the arrondissements of Yonne, it received 12 communes from the arrondissement of Auxerre.

As a result of the reorganisation of the cantons of France which came into effect in 2015, the borders of the cantons are no longer related to the borders of the arrondissements. The cantons of the arrondissement of Auxerre were, as of January 2015:

# Cerisiers
# Chéroy
# Pont-sur-Yonne
# Saint-Julien-du-Sault
# Sens-Nord-Est
# Sens-Ouest
# Sens-Sud-Est
# Sergines
# Villeneuve-l&#x27;Archevêque
# Villeneuve-sur-Yonne

<text>Peter H. Diamandis ( ; born May 20, 1961) is an American engineer, physician, and entrepreneur. He is best known as the founder and chairman of the XPRIZE Foundation, and the cofounder and executive chairman of Singularity University. He is also cofounder and former CEO of the Zero Gravity Corporation, cofounder and vice chairman of Space Adventures Ltd., founder and chairman of the Rocket Racing League, cofounder of the International Space University, cofounder of Planetary Resources, cofounder of Celularity, founder of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space, and vice chairman and cofounder of Human Longevity, Inc.

==Early life==

Diamandis was born in the Bronx, New York to Greek immigrants. Diamandis expressed a keen interest in space exploration from a very early age. At age 8, he began lecturing his family and friends on space. At age 12, Diamandis won first place in the Estes Rocket Design Competition for building a launch system able to simultaneously launch three rockets.

After graduating from Great Neck North High School in 1979, Diamandis attended Hamilton College for his first year, then transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study biology and physics. During his second year at MIT in 1980, Diamandis cofounded Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.

Diamandis graduated from MIT in 1983 with degrees in molecular genetics and aerospace engineering. He then entered Harvard Medical School to pursue his MD through the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology. During his second year of medical school, he cofounded the Space Generation Foundation to promote projects and programs that would help the &quot;Space Generation&quot;—all those born since the flight of Sputnik—get off the planet.

In 1986, Diamandis put his medical degree on hold and returned to MIT to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in aeronautics and astronautics, conducting research at NASA Johnson Space Center, the MIT Man Vehicle Laboratory and MIT&#x27;s Whitehead Biomedical Institute. After completing his M.S. at MIT, Diamandis returned to Harvard to complete his M.D.

During his last year of medical school in 1989, Diamandis acted as managing director of the International Space University and CEO of International Micro Space, a microsatellite launch company.

==Career==
Over the course of his career, Diamandis has founded over 25 companies in the areas of longevity, space, venture capital and education.

===International Space University===
In 1987, during his third year of medical school, Diamandis cofounded International Space University with Todd Hawley, Walter Anderson, Christopher Mau and Robert Richards. Diamandis served as the university&#x27;s managing director and chief operating officer until 1989. Today, ISU offers a Space Studies program and two accredited Master of Space Studies degrees. Its $30 million campus is headquartered in Strasbourg, France.

===International MicroSpace, Inc.===

Diamandis cofounded Microsat Launch Systems, later renamed International MicroSpace Inc., in 1989 during his fourth year of medical school and served as the company&#x27;s CEO. IMI designed a small launcher called Orbital Express (later renamed &quot;ORBEX&quot;) for taking 100-kg payloads to low-Earth orbit, collaborating with Bristol Aerospace for the manufacture. The company won a $100 million SDIO contract for one launch plus nine options and was sold to CTA Inc of Rockville, MD in 1993 for $250,000. Diamandis joined CTA for one year as VP of Commercial Space Programs post-acquisition. The ORBEX contract was eventually canceled &quot;because of a glut of small launchers,&quot; and CTA put the project on hold and eventually canceled the project.

===Constellation Communications and Angel Technologies Corporation===
In 1991, Diamandis founded Constellation Communications, Inc., one of five low-Earth orbit satellite constellations for voice telephony. The company planned to deploy an equatorial ring of 10 satellites to provide communications primarily to Brazil and Indonesia. Diamandis remained director until 1993, when it was acquired by Angel Technology. Between 1995 and 1999, Diamandis was the president of Angel Technologies Corporation, a commercial communications company that intended to develop wireless broadband communications networks based on a high-altitude aircraft.

===XPRIZE Foundation===

In 1994, Diamandis founded the XPRIZE Foundation after the failure of International MicroSpace, Inc and reading Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. He serves as chairman and CEO of the foundation. XPRIZE was created to fund and operate a $10 million incentive competition intended to inspire a new generation of private passenger-carrying spaceships. The prize was announced on May 18, 1996, in St. Louis, MO without any purse money or any teams. The prize was ultimately funded through an insurance policy underwritten by the Anousheh and Hamid Ansari Family and renamed the Ansari XPRIZE in their honor.

The $10 million competition attracted 26 teams from seven countries as teams and was won on October 4, 2004, by Mojave Aerospace Ventures, a team run by the aviation designer Burt Rutan and funded by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen. The winning vehicle, SpaceShipOne, was piloted to space twice within two weeks to win the competition. The first flight was made on September 29, 2004, piloted by Mike Melvill, and the winning, second flight was made on October 4, 2004, by pilot Brian Binnie. SpaceShipOne was the world&#x27;s first non-government piloted spacecraft and hangs in the National Air and Space Museum adjacent to the Spirit of St. Louis aircraft.

In January 2005, the XPRIZE Foundation Board of Trustees expanded the focus of the XPRIZE to address four different group areas: Exploration (oceans and space), Life Sciences, Energy and Environment, and Education and Global Development.

Since inception, the foundation has launched the $10M Ansari XPRIZE (awarded), the $10M Automotive XPRIZE (awarded), the $10M Archon XPRIZE (in progress), the $30M Google Lunar XPRIZE (in progress), the $10M Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE, the $2M Lunar Lander Challenge (awarded), the $1.4M Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup X Challenge (awarded), the Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE, and the $101 million XPRIZE Healthspan targeting aspects of the biology of aging. In May 2012, the Robin Hood Foundation announced its plans to partner with the XPRIZE Foundation for several New York-based challenges targeted at eradicating poverty.

The $101 million XPRIZE Healthspan was launched in November 2023. To win the competition, a team must demonstrate a therapeutic delivered in under 1 year that is capable of restoring muscle, immune, and cognitive functioning for people aged 65 to 80 by a minimum of 10 years, with a goal of 20 years.

The XPRIZE Foundation has a staff of approximately 50 and is headquartered in Culver City, California. Its board of trustees includes Larry Page, Elon Musk, James Cameron, Dean Kamen, Ratan Tata, Ray Kurzweil, Jim Gianopulos, Naveen Jain, Arianna Huffington, Will Wright, and Craig Venter.

The 2015 documentary &quot;Visioneer: The Peter Diamandis Story&quot; tells the story of the creation of XPRIZE.

In 2016, Julian Guthrie authored the book &quot;How to Make a Spaceship: A Band of Renegades, an Epic Race, and the Birth of Private Spaceflight&quot;, detailing the story behind the XPRIZE.

===Private spaceflight ventures===
In 1994, Diamandis cofounded the Zero Gravity Corporation (ZERO-G) with Byron K. Lichtenberg and Ray Cronise. The company offered weightless flight experiences aboard its Boeing 727 aircraft, and provided NASA with microgravity flight services for research purposes.

In 1998, Diamandis provided some of the initial funding for the space tourism company Space Adventures. In March 2008, Space Adventures acquired Zero Gravity Corporation. More than 15,000 people have flown on the G-Force One aircraft as of 2017.

Between 1999 and 2001, Diamandis was the CEO of BlastOff! Corporation, which proposed to fly a private rover mission to land on the Moon as a mix of entertainment, Internet and space. Diamandis commented on how the initial startup cost for the project was in the region of five million dollars, which was necessary to cover the costs of the servers, bandwidth and software. The company lost funding and ceased business in 2001.

===Rocket Racing League===
In 2005, Diamandis cofounded the Rocket Racing League. Developed as a cross between IndyCar racing and rockets, it envisioned enabling the public to enjoy speed, rockets and competitive spirits. Diamandis was the chairman of RRL until it ceased business.

===Singularity University===
In 2008, with the American author, inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil, Diamandis cofounded Singularity University (SU), a Silicon Valley-based nonprofit offering education in futurology. It is now called the Singularity Group, as it is not a university. Diamandis now serves as its executive chairman. SU is an interdisciplinary organization based on the NASA Ames campus in Silicon Valley and is supported by a number of corporate founders and partners including Autodesk, Cisco, Nokia, Kauffman Foundation and ePlanet Ventures. The company runs a 10-week Graduate Studies Program and a seven-day Executive Program.

===Planetary Resources Inc.===
In April 2012, Diamandis cofounded Planetary Resources Inc., an organization dedicated to the identification, remote sensing and prospecting of near-Earth approaching asteroids, with Eric Anderson. He has also served on the company&#x27;s board. Following financial troubles, it was announced in October 2018 that the company&#x27;s human assets were purchased by the blockchain software technology company ConsenSys, Inc.

===Biotechnology ventures===
In March 2014, Diamandis cofounded Human Longevity Inc. (HLI), a genomics and cell therapy-based diagnostic and therapeutic company focused on extending the healthy human lifespan, with Craig Venter and Robert Hariri.

In 2015, he co-founded BOLD Capital Partners, a venture fund with $600M AUM investing in biotech and longevity.

In February 2018, Diamandis co-founded Celularity, a biotechnology company productizing allogeneic cells and tissues derived from the postpartum placenta, with Robert Hariri.

In 2020, Diamandis co-founded vaccine development company COVAXX with Mei Mei Hu and Lou Reese, as a subsidiary of United Biomedical Inc. (UBI). COVAXX (now Vaxxinity ) is the developer of the UB-612 COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Diamandis also co-founded and is Executive Chairman of Fountain Life, a global longevity diagnostics and therapeutics provider.

Every year Diamandis hosts the Platinum Longevity Trip for a select group of high-net-worth individuals to learn about advancements in longevity and wellness.

==Books==
In 2012, with Steven Kotler, Diamandis coauthored &quot;&quot;. The nonfiction work argues that advances in technology, entrepreneurship, and philanthropy have the potential to significantly raise global standards of living. &quot;Abundance&quot; was No. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, remaining on the list for nine weeks. It was No. 1 on the non-fiction bestseller lists of Amazon and Barnes and Noble.

In 2015, again with Steven Kotler, Diamandis coauthored &quot;&quot;, which provides analysis and instruction for entrepreneurs interested in learning about exponential technologies, moon-shot thinking, and crowdsourcing.

January 28, 2020, Kotler and Diamandis released a third book in the series &quot;The Exponential Mindset Trilogy,&quot; which includes &quot;Abundance&quot; and &quot;Bold&quot;: &quot;The Future is Faster Than You Think: How Converging Technologies are Transforming Business, Industries, and Our Lives&quot;, which examines the revolutionary changes brought about by convergence. The book argues that the already rapid pace of technological innovation is about to get even quicker.

In February 2022, Diamandis co-authored &quot;Life Force: How New Breakthroughs in Precision Medicine Can Transform the Quality of Your Life &amp; Those You Love&quot; with Tony Robbins. The book, a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, discusses various ways to boost energy, prevent disease, and extend vitality amidst health uncertainties.

In January 2025, Peter Diamandis released &quot;Longevity Guidebook: How to Slow, Stop, and Reverse Aging — and NOT Die From Something Stupid&quot;.

== Santa Monica COVID superspreader event ==
In February 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;MIT Technology Review&quot; reported that Diamandis held a &quot;mostly maskless&quot; event in Santa Monica in violation of the local stay-at-home order that became a superspreading event where 32 attendees became infected directly or indirectly. The event charged ultra-high-net-worth individuals up to $30,000 for tickets. In a follow-up article, &quot;Technology Review&quot; revealed that after COVID-19 had spread among attendees, an &quot;informational webinar&quot; was delivered by Matt Cook, a trained anesthesiologist from the San Francisco Bay Area who had started a medical practice using alternative therapies. It is alleged that Cook tried to sell participants &quot;fraudulent&quot; treatments including inhaled amniotic fluid and ketamine lozenges, which a professor of law and medicine at Stanford University characterized as &quot;quackery&quot;. The superspreading event was covered widely by publications including the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

==Personal life==
Diamandis proposed to his girlfriend Kristen Hladecek on a Zero Gravity Corporation spaceflight in 2004. They have twin sons, born .

<doc id="1027461" wikidata="Q6888280" url="?curid=1027461" title="Model State Emergency Health Powers Act">
<text>The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA) is a public health act originally drafted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to aid the United States&#x27; state legislatures in revising their public health laws to control epidemics and respond to bioterrorism. 
The CDC&#x27;s draft was revised by the Center for Law and the Public&#x27;s Health, a collaboration between Georgetown University and Johns Hopkins University. By December 21, 2001, the act was released to state legislatures for review and approval. 
Critics immediately charged that the MSEHPA failed to protect the general public from abuses arising from the tremendous powers it would grant individual states in an emergency. The MSEHPA provisions also went beyond the scope of addressing bioterrorism while disregarding medical privacy standards. As of August 1, 2011, forty states have passed various forms of MSEHPA legislation.

==Draft==
The initial public health emergency proposal was drafted by the CDC in 1999. Still in the CDC&#x27;s draft form, Lawrence O. Gostin, an attorney and professor at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. began reworking the document during the anthrax letter attacks in 2001, using funds provided by the CDC. Gostin&#x27;s produced a preliminary draft on October 23, before releasing a second draft in December 2001. Gostin stated that it took him three to four weeks to prepare the act.

The preliminary draft named the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National Association of Attorneys General, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, and the National Association of County and City Health Officials as collaborators without Gostin contacting them. The second draft, dated December 21, 2001, made the revised statement on its title page that the law was a &quot;draft for discussion … to assist&quot; those organizations.

==Criticism==
The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons claimed that the draft used sweeping language to the extent that it &quot;could turn governors into dictators&quot; since the MSEHPA gave governors the authority to declare public health emergencies, and afterward force vaccinations on the general public without their informed consent. The deployment of state National Guards could be used to administer the vaccines or substances. Legal liabilities for drug companies which manufactured the vaccines and/or substances were removed. ACT-UP/San Francisco protested the MSEHPA, stating it was a potential assault on gay men who could be rounded up en masse as vectors of disease, and the leaders of ACT-UP were jailed for three months on anti-terrorism charges for their protest.

In 2002, the public strongly criticized a similar but federal version of MSEHPA, folded into Section 304 of the Homeland Security Act. Of concern was Sidney Taurel&#x27;s seat on the Homeland Security Advisory Council and his influence in creating what was commonly referred to as the Lilly Rider, those HSA provisions which protected Eli Lilly and Company and other drug manufacturers against legal liabilities. The primary difference between HSA provisions and MSEHPA provisions was that traditional state control of public health concerns was removed and replaced by federal health department control. The Department of Homeland Security would declare public health emergencies instead of governors, and be responsible for enacting forced vaccinations without informed consent. The HSA was passed by Congress, but Section 304 was struck from the bill in 2003.

Phyllis Schlafly called the MSEHPA &quot;an unprecedented assault on the constitutional rights of the American people.&quot;

===Defence===
Attorneys Jason W. Sapsin, Stephen P. Teret; Scott Burris, Julie Samia Mair, James G. Hodge Jr, Jon S. Vernick and Gostin wrote in an article in the August 2002 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Assn., that &quot;Provided those powers are bounded by legal safeguards, individuals should be required to yield some of their autonomy, liberty, or property to protect the health and security of the community.&quot;

==Current status==
As of 2007, 33 states had introduced 133 legislative bills or resolutions that were based upon or featured provisions related to the articles or sections of the act. Of these, 48 had passed.

<doc id="1027464" wikidata="Q4668756" url="?curid=1027464" title="Walter Allen">
<text>Walter Ernest Allen (23 February 1911 – 28 February 1995) was an English literary critic and novelist and one of the Birmingham Group of authors. He is best known for his classic study &quot;The English Novel: a Short Critical History&quot; (1951).

==Life and career==
Allen was born in Aston, Birmingham; he drew on his working-class roots for &quot;All in a Lifetime&quot; (1959), generally considered his best novel. He was educated at King Edward&#x27;s Grammar School and the University of Birmingham, graduating in 1932—his friends at that period included Henry Reed and Louis MacNeice.

He taught and took numerous temporary academic positions. In 1935, he was a Visiting Lecturer in English at the University of Iowa, Iowa City; from 1955 to 1956 he was visiting professor of English at Coe College, Cedar Rapids, Iowa; from 1963 to 1964 he was visiting professor of English, Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York, and in 1967 he was at University of Kansas, Lawrence, and University of Washington, Seattle. He also worked in journalism, being at one time literary editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;; and was a broadcaster. In 1967 he took a position as Professor of English Studies at the New University of Ulster.

Allen published many novels early in his career mostly dealing with the life of the working class in England. &quot;As I Walked Down New Grub Street&quot; which accounts his meetings with prominent literary figures was published in 1982. After a significant break from fiction-writing for 27 years he published &quot;Get Out Early&quot; in 1986.
He was known as an editor of George Gissing. He wrote some poetry, which appeared in John Lehmann&#x27;s publications in the 1940s. He left much writing in manuscript. He died in London.

==Background==
The first XPRIZE, the Ansari XPRIZE, was inspired by the Orteig Prize, a $25,000 prize offered in 1919 by French hotelier Raymond Orteig for the first nonstop flight between New York City and Paris. In 1927, underdog Charles Lindbergh won the prize in a modified single-engine Ryan aircraft called the Spirit of St. Louis. In total, nine teams spent $400,000 in pursuit of the Orteig Prize.

In 1996, entrepreneur Peter Diamandis offered a $10-million prize to the first privately financed team that could build and fly a three-passenger vehicle 100 kilometers into space twice within two weeks. The contest, later titled the Ansari XPRIZE for Suborbital Spaceflight, motivated 26 teams from seven nations to invest more than $100 million in pursuit of the $10 million purse. On October 4, 2004, the Ansari XPRIZE was won by Mojave Aerospace Ventures, who successfully completed the contest in their spacecraft SpaceShipOne. The prize was awarded in a ceremony at the Saint Louis Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri. 

The foundation has also created the XPRIZE Cup rocket challenge competition.

==XPRIZE unifying principles==
XPRIZES are monetary rewards to incentivize three primary goals:

*Attract investments from outside the sector that take new approaches to difficult problems.
*Create significant results that are real and meaningful. Competitions have measurable goals, and are created to promote adoption of innovation.
*Cross national and disciplinary boundaries to encourage teams around the world to invest the intellectual and financial capital required to solve difficult challenges.

Other organizations such as the Nobel Prize committee award prizes and financial rewards to individuals or organizations that produce novel advances in science, medicine and technology. One difference between the XPRIZE foundation and other similar organizations is the awarding of prizes based on the first to achieve objective &#x27;finish line&#x27; requirements rather than a selection committee discussing the relative merits of different endeavors. For instance, the Archon Genomics XPRIZE target was to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days or less, with less than one error per 100,000 DNA base pairs, covering 98% of the genome and costing less than $10,000 per genome (this prize was canceled because it was outpaced by innovation).

The prize can increase attention to endeavors that otherwise might not receive much publicity. XPRIZE is currently developing new prizes in Exploration (Space and Oceans), Life Sciences, Energy &amp; Environment, Education and Global Development. The prizes will aim to help improve lives, create equity of opportunity and stimulate new, important discoveries.

==Prizes and events overseen==
===Past contests===

====1996–2004 Ansari XPRIZE for Suborbital Spaceflight====
The Ansari XPRIZE for Suborbital Spaceflight was the first prize from the foundation. It successfully challenged teams to build private spaceships capable of carrying three people and fly two times within two weeks to open the space frontier. The first part of the Ansari XPRIZE requirements was fulfilled by Mike Melvill on September 29, 2004, On SpaceShipOne, a spacecraft designed by Burt Rutan and financed by Paul Allen, co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft. On that ship, Melvill broke the 100-kilometer (62.5 mi) mark, internationally recognized as the boundary of outer space. Brian Binnie completed the second part of the requirements on October 4, 2004, winning the prize. As a result, US$10 million was awarded to the winner, but more than $100 million was invested in new technologies in pursuit of the prize.

Awarding this first prize gave XPRIZE as much publicity as the winners themselves. After the 2004 success there was ample media coverage to afford both Scaled Composites and XPRIZE additional support for them to expand and continue to pursue their aims. Following this early success several other XPRIZES were announced.

The Ansari XPRIZE won the Space Foundation&#x27;s Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award in 2005. The award is given annually to an individual or organization that has made significant contributions to public awareness of space programs.

====2007–2010 Progressive Insurance Automotive XPRIZE====

The goal of the Progressive Insurance Automotive XPRIZE was to design, build and race super-efficient vehicles that achieve 100 MPGe (2.35 liter/100 kilometer) efficiency, produce less than 200 grams/mile well-to-wheel CO2 equivalent emissions, and could be manufactured for the mass market.

The winners of the competition were announced on September 16, 2010.
* Team Edison2 won the $5 million Mainstream competition with its four-passenger Very Light Car, obtaining 102.5 MPGe running on E85 fuel.
* Team Li-Ion Motors won the $2.5 million Alternative Side-by-Side competition with their aerodynamic Wave-II electric vehicle achieving 187 MPGe.

The Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup XCHALLENGE was introduced on July 29, 2010. The $1 million prize had a goal to inspire a new generation of innovative solutions that will speed the pace of cleaning up seawater surface oil resulting from spillage from ocean platforms, tankers, and other sources. The team of Elastec/American Marine won the challenge by developing a device that skims oil off water three times faster than previously existing technology.

====2006–2009 Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander XCHALLENGE====

The Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander XCHALLENGE (NGLLXPC) was a competition (co-hosted by NASA) to build precise, efficient small rocket systems. It was introduced in 2006 and the US$1 million top prize was awarded on November 5, 2009 to Masten Space Systems, led by David Masten; while Armadillo Aerospace, led by id Software founder John Carmack took home the second place prize of US$500,000, plus an additional $500,000 in 2008.

====2012–2014 The Nokia Sensing XCHALLENGE====
The Nokia Sensing XCHALLENGE goal is accelerating the use of sensors and sensing technology to tackle health care problems and find ways for people to monitor and maintain their personal well-being. It was composed of two distinct Challenges held in 2013 and 2014. It was announced in 2012 and 12 finalists announced in 2013. On November 11, 2014, the winner was named to be team DMI, led by Eugene Y. Chan, MD, whose entry was the rHEALTH technology which used lasers and nanostrips to perform vast multiplexing on samples. In this competition, prize purses totaling $2.25 million were awarded.

====2013–2015 The Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE====
The Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE is a $2 million competition to improve our understanding of ocean acidification. On July 20, 2015, the winners of the challenge were announced.

====2011–2017 Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE====

The Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE was announced on May 10, 2011, and is sponsored by Qualcomm Foundation. It was officially launched on January 10, 2012. The $10 million prize is awarded for creating a mobile device that can &quot;diagnose patients better than or equal to a panel of board certified physicians&quot;. The name is taken from the tricorder device in &quot;Star Trek&quot; which can be used to instantly diagnose ailments. No team met all the requirements needed to win the full prize purse. Reduced prizes were made to the strongest performers (US$2.6 million for Final Frontier Medical Devices, US$1 million for Dynamical Biomarkers, and $100,000 for Cloud DX, named &quot;Bold Epic Innovator&quot;). For the first time at any XPRIZE, the leftover funds from the main prize purse were diverted for consumer testing for commercialization ($3.8 million) and for adapting tricorders for use in hospitals in developing countries ($1.6 million).

==== 2018–2022 ANA Avatar XPRIZE ====

The $10M ANA Avatar XPRIZE aimed to create avatar systems that can transport human presence to remote locations in real time. The participants of this competition developed robotic systems that allow operators to see, hear, and interact with a remote environment in a way that feels as if they are truly there. On the other hand, people in the remote environment were given the impression that the operator was present inside the avatar robot. At the competition finals, held in November 2022 in Long Beach, CA, USA, the avatar systems were evaluated on their support for remotely interacting with humans, exploring new environments, and employing specialized skills.
The winners of the competition were:
* Team NimbRo, University of Bonn, Germany won the grand prize of $5,000,000
* Pollen Robotics, France won $2,000,000
* Team Northeastern, Northeastern University, USA won $1,000,000

===Canceled contests===

====2006–2013 Archon Genomics XPRIZE====

The Archon Genomics XPRIZE, the second XPRIZE to be offered by the foundation, was announced on October 4, 2006. The goal of the Archon Genomics XPRIZE was to greatly reduce the cost and increase the speed of human genome sequencing to create a new era of personalized, predictive, and preventive medicine, eventually transforming medical care from reactive to proactive. The $10 million prize purse was promised to the first team that can build a device and use it to sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days or less, with an accuracy of no more than one error in every 100,000 bases sequenced, with sequences accurately covering at least 98% of the genome, and at a recurring cost of no more than $1,000 per genome.

If more than one team attempted the competition at the same time, and more than one team fulfilled all the criteria, then teams would have been ranked according to the time of completion. No more than three teams would have been ranked and would have shared the purse in the following manner: $7.5 million to the winner and $2.5 million to the second place team if two teams were successful, or $7 million, $2 million and $1 million if three teams are successful.

Actual competition events were originally scheduled to occur twice a year, with all eligible teams given the opportunity to attempt, starting at precisely the same time as the other teams. This was changed to a single competition scheduled for September 5, 2013, to October 1, 2013, which was canceled on August 22, 2013. The CEO articulated the rationale for the change, &quot;companies can do this for less than $5,000 per genome, in a few days or less – and are moving quickly towards the goals we set for the prize. For this reason, we have decided to cancel an XPRIZE for the first time ever.&quot; A public debate concerning the validity and potential implications of the cancellation was published March 27, 2014.

====2007–2018 Google Lunar XPRIZE====

The Google Lunar XPRIZE was introduced on September 13, 2007. The goal of the prize was similar to that of the Ansari XPRIZE, to inspire a new generation of private investment in space exploration and technology. The challenge called for teams to compete in successfully launching, landing, and operating a rover on the lunar surface. The prize would award $20 million to the first team to land a rover on the Moon that successfully roved more than 500 meters and transmitted back high-definition images and video. There was a $5 million second prize, as well as $5 million in potential bonus prizes for extra features such as roving long distances (greater than 5,000 meters), capturing images of man-made objects on the Moon, or surviving a lunar night.

On January 23, 2018, the prize ended when no team could schedule, confirm, and pay for a launch attempt. The XPRIZE Foundation announced that &quot;no team would be able to make a launch attempt to reach the Moon by the March 31, 2018 deadline... and the US $30 million Google Lunar XPRIZE will go unclaimed.&quot;

==== 2019-2024 Rainforest XPRIZE ====
On November 19, 2019, the $10 million Rainforest XPrize was announced. Registration opened in February 2020 and the first round will began in September 2020. On November 18, 2024, the winning teams were announced. Limelight Rainforest won the $5 million first place award, Map of Life Rapid Assessments won the $2 million second place award, the Brazilian Team won the $1 million third place award, and a special award of $250,000 for integration of technology and outreach was awarded to ETH BiodivX.

===Active contests===

====2014 IBM Watson A.I. XPRIZE ====
The A.I. XPRIZE was announced as having the aim to use an artificial intelligence system to deliver a compelling TED talk.

The winning team of the contest, which is scheduled for 2020, will be determined by the audience.

====2015 NRG Cosia Carbon XPRIZE====
On September 29, 2015, Peter Diamandis, chairman and CEO of X Prize, announced the launch of a $20 million prize for a 4.5-year competition on testing technologies that converts CO2 into products with the highest net value to reduce carbon dioxide emissions of either coal or a natural gas power plant. Round three began in April 2018 as the 27 semifinalists were cut down to ten finalists; each is receiving an equal share of $5 million milestone prize money. Five teams will compete at a coal-fired power plant in Gillette, Wyoming. The remaining five teams will compete at a natural gas-fired power plant in Alberta, Canada. In February 2020 this operational round will conclude and winners will be announced the following month.

A delay occurred, and in April 2021, the winners were announced: CarbonCure Technologies (Canada) and CarbonBuilt (United States).

<text>A reaction control system (RCS) is a spacecraft system that uses thrusters to provide attitude control and translation. Alternatively, reaction wheels can be used for attitude control. Use of diverted engine thrust to provide stable attitude control of a short-or-vertical takeoff and landing aircraft below conventional winged flight speeds, such as with the Harrier &quot;jump jet&quot;, may also be referred to as a reaction control system.

Reaction control systems are capable of providing small amounts of thrust in any desired direction or combination of directions. An RCS is also capable of providing torque to allow control of rotation (roll, pitch, and yaw).

Reaction control systems often use combinations of large and small (vernier) thrusters, to allow different levels of response.

== Uses ==

Spacecraft reaction control systems are used for:

* attitude control during different stages of a mission;
* station keeping in orbit;
* close maneuvering during docking procedures;
* control of orientation, or &quot;pointing the nose&quot; of the craft;
* a backup means of deorbiting;
* ullage motors to prime the fuel system for a main engine burn.

Because spacecraft only contain a finite amount of fuel and there is little chance to refill them, alternative reaction control systems have been developed so that fuel can be conserved. For stationkeeping, some spacecraft (particularly those in geosynchronous orbit) use high-specific impulse engines such as arcjets, ion thrusters, or Hall effect thrusters. To control orientation, a few spacecraft, including the ISS, use momentum wheels which spin to control rotational rates on the vehicle.

==Location of thrusters on spacecraft==

The Mercury space capsule and Gemini reentry module both used groupings of nozzles to provide attitude control. The thrusters were located off their center of mass, thus providing a torque to rotate the capsule. The Gemini capsule was also capable of adjusting its reentry course by rolling, which directed its off-center lifting force. The Mercury thrusters used a hydrogen peroxide monopropellant which turned to steam when forced through a tungsten screen, and the Gemini thrusters used hypergolic mono-methyl hydrazine fuel oxidized with nitrogen tetroxide.

The Gemini spacecraft was also equipped with a hypergolic Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System, which made it the first crewed spacecraft with translation as well as rotation capability. In-orbit attitude control was achieved by firing pairs of eight thrusters located around the circumference of its adapter module at the extreme aft end. Lateral translation control was provided by four thrusters around the circumference at the forward end of the adaptor module (close to the spacecraft&#x27;s center of mass). Two forward-pointing thrusters at the same location, provided aft translation, and two thrusters located in the aft end of the adapter module provided forward thrust, which could be used to change the craft&#x27;s orbit. The Gemini reentry module also had a separate Reentry Control System of sixteen thrusters located at the base of its nose, to provide rotational control during reentry.

The Apollo Command Module had a set of twelve hypergolic thrusters for attitude control, and directional reentry control similar to Gemini.

The Apollo Service Module and Lunar Module each had a set of sixteen R-4D hypergolic thrusters, grouped into external clusters of four, to provide both translation and attitude control. The clusters were located near the craft&#x27;s average centers of mass, and were fired in pairs in opposite directions for attitude control.

A pair of translation thrusters are located at the rear of the Soyuz spacecraft; the counter-acting thrusters are similarly paired in the middle of the spacecraft (near the center of mass) pointing outwards and forward. These act in pairs to prevent the spacecraft from rotating. The thrusters for the lateral directions are mounted close to the center of mass of the spacecraft, in pairs as well.

===Location of thrusters on spaceplanes===
The suborbital X-15 and a companion training aero-spacecraft, the NF-104 AST, both intended to travel to an altitude that rendered their aerodynamic control surfaces unusable, established a convention for locations for thrusters on winged vehicles not intended to dock in space; that is, those that only have attitude control thrusters. Those for pitch and yaw are located in the nose, forward of the cockpit, and replace a standard radar system. Those for roll are located at the wingtips. The X-20, which would have gone into orbit, continued this pattern.

Unlike these, the Space Shuttle Orbiter had many more thrusters, which were required to control vehicle attitude in both orbital flight and during the early part of atmospheric entry, as well as carry out rendezvous and docking maneuvers in orbit. Shuttle thrusters were grouped in the nose of the vehicle and on each of the two aft Orbital Maneuvering System pods. No nozzles interrupted the heat shield on the underside of the craft; instead, the nose RCS nozzles which control positive pitch were mounted on the side of the vehicle, and were canted downward. The downward-facing negative pitch thrusters were located in the OMS pods mounted in the tail/afterbody.

==International Space Station systems==
The International Space Station uses electrically powered control moment gyroscopes (CMG) for primary attitude control, with RCS thruster systems as backup and augmentation systems.

<doc id="1027480" wikidata="Q3175716" url="?curid=1027480" title="List of 7400-series integrated circuits">
<text>The following is a list of 7400-series digital logic integrated circuits. In the mid-1960s, the original 7400-series integrated circuits were introduced by Texas Instruments with the prefix &quot;SN&quot; to create the name SN74xx. Due to the popularity of these parts, other manufacturers released pin-to-pin compatible logic devices and kept the 7400 sequence number as an aid to identification of compatible parts. However, other manufacturers use different prefixes and suffixes on their part numbers.

==Overview==
Some TTL logic parts were made with an extended military-specification temperature range. These parts are prefixed with 54 instead of 74 in the part number.

A short-lived 64 prefix on Texas Instruments parts indicated an industrial temperature range; this prefix had been dropped from the TI literature by 1973. Most recent 7400-series parts are fabricated in CMOS or BiCMOS technology rather than TTL. Surface-mount parts with a single gate (often in a 5-pin or 6-pin package) are prefixed with 741G instead of 74.

Some manufacturers released some 4000-series equivalent CMOS circuits with a 74 prefix, for example, the 74HC4066 was a replacement for the 4066 with slightly different electrical characteristics (different power-supply voltage ratings, higher frequency capabilities, lower &quot;on&quot; resistances in analog switches, etc.). See List of 4000-series integrated circuits.
Conversely, the 4000-series has &quot;borrowed&quot; from the 7400 series such as the CD40193 and CD40161 being pin-for-pin &quot;functional&quot; replacements for 74C193 and 74C161.

Older TTL parts made by manufacturers such as Signetics, Motorola, Mullard and Siemens may have different numeric prefix and numbering series entirely, such as in the European FJ family FJH101 is an 8-input NAND gate like a 7430.

A few alphabetic characters to designate a specific logic subfamily may immediately follow the 74 or 54 in the part number, e.g., 74LS74 for low-power Schottky. Some CMOS parts such as 74HCT74 for high-speed CMOS with TTL-compatible input thresholds are functionally similar to the TTL part. Not all functions are available in all families.
The generic descriptive feature of these alphabetic characters was diluted by various companies participating in the market at its peak and are not always consistent especially with more recent offerings. The National Semiconductor trademarks of the words FAST and FACT are usually cited in the descriptions from other companies when describing their own unique designations.

In a few instances, such as the 7478 and 74107, the same suffix in different families do not have completely equivalent logic functions.

Another extension to the series is the 7416xxx variant, representing mostly the 16-bit-wide counterpart of otherwise 8-bit-wide &quot;base&quot; chips with the same three ending digits. Thus e.g. a &quot;7416373&quot; would be the 16-bit-wide equivalent of a &quot;74373&quot;. Some 7416xxx parts, however, do not have a direct counterpart from the standard 74xxx range but deliver new functionality instead, which needs making use of the 7416xxx series&#x27; higher pin count. For more details, refer primarily to the Texas Instruments documentation mentioned in the References section.

For CMOS (AC, HC, etc.) subfamilies, read &quot;open drain&quot; for &quot;open collector&quot; in the table below.

There are a few numeric suffixes that have multiple conflicting assignments, such as the 74453.

==Logic gates==


Since there are numerous 7400-series parts, the following groups related parts to make it easier to pick a useful part number. This section only includes combinational logic gates.

For part numbers in this section, &quot;x&quot; is the 7400-series logic family, such as LS, ALS, HCT, AHCT, HC, AHC, LVC, ...

;Normal inputs / push–pull outputs
:

;Schmitt-trigger inputs / push–pull outputs
:

;Normal inputs / open-collector outputs
:

;Schmitt-trigger inputs / three-state outputs

;AND-OR-invert (AOI) logic gates
: NOTE: in past decades, a number of AND-OR-invert (AOI) parts were available in 7400 TTL families, but currently most are obsolete.
* SN5450 = dual 2-2 AOI gate, one is expandable (SN54 is military version of SN74)
* SN74LS51 = 2-2 AOI gate and 3-3 AOI gate
* SN54LS54 = single 2-3-3-2 AOI gate

==Larger footprints==
Parts in this section have a pin count of 14 pins or more. The lower part numbers were established in the 1960s and 1970s, then higher part numbers were added incrementally over decades. IC manufacturers continue to make a core subset of this group, but many of these part numbers are considered obsolete and no longer manufactured. Older discontinued parts may be available from a limited number of sellers as new old stock (NOS), though some are much harder to find.

For the following table:
* Part number column the &quot;x&quot; is a place holder for the logic subfamily name. For example, 74x00 in &quot;LS&quot; logic family would be &quot;74LS00&quot;.
* Description column simplified to make it easier to sort, thus isn&#x27;t identical to datasheet title. The terms Schmitt trigger, open-collector/open-drain, three-state were moved to the input and output columns to make it easier to sort by those features.
* Input column a blank cell means a normal input for the logic family type.
* Output column a blank cell means a &quot;totem pole&quot; output, also known as a push–pull output, with the ability to drive ten standard inputs of the same logic subfamily (fan-out NO = 10). Outputs with higher output currents are often called drivers or buffers.
* Pins column number of pins for the dual in-line package (DIP) version; a number in parentheses (round brackets) indicates that there is no known dual in-line package version of this IC.

==Widebus Devices==
The widebus range in the 74xxx series includes higher-numbered parts like the 7416xxx and others, designed for extended functionality beyond standard chips. These components often feature 16-bit or wider data handling, serving as direct expansions of existing 8-bit designs (e.g., 74373 to 7416373) or introducing entirely new capabilities. They utilize higher pin counts to support larger data buses, advanced operations, and scalable digital logic solutions for more complex circuit requirements.
==Smaller footprints==
As board designs have migrated away from large amounts of logic chips, so has the need for many of the same gate in one package. Since about 1996, there has been an ongoing trend towards one / two / three logic gates per chip. Now logic can be placed where it is physically needed on a board, instead of running long signal traces to a full-size logic chip that has many of the same gate.

All chips in the following sections are available 5- to 10-pin surface-mount packages. The right digits, after the 1G/2G/3G, typically has the same functional features as older legacy chips, except for the multifunctional chips and 4-digit chip numbers, which are unique to these newer families. The &quot;x&quot; in the part number is a place holder for the logic family name. For example, 74x1G14 in &quot;LVC&quot; logic family would be &quot;74LVC1G14&quot;. The previously stated prefixes of &quot;SN-&quot; and &quot;MC-&quot; are used to denote manufacturers, Texas Instruments and ON Semiconductor respectively.

Some of the manufacturers that make these smaller IC chips are: Diodes Incorporated, Nexperia (NXP Semiconductors), ON Semiconductor (Fairchild Semiconductor), Texas Instruments (National Semiconductor), Toshiba.

The logic families available in small footprints are: AHC, AHCT, AUC, AUP, AXP, HC, HCT, LVC, VHC, NC7S, NC7ST, NC7SU, NC7SV. The LVC family is very popular in small footprints because it supports the most common logic voltages of 1.8 V, 3.3 V, 5 V, its inputs are 5 V tolerant when the device is powered at a lower voltage, and an output drive of 24 mA. Gates that are commonly available across most small footprint families are 00, 02, 04, 08, 14, 32, 86, 125, 126.

Chips in this section typically contain the number of units noted by the number immediately before the &#x27;G&#x27; in their prefix (e.g. 2G = 2 gates).

===Voltage translation===
All chips in this section have two power-supply pins to translate unidirectional logic signals between two different logic voltages. The logic families that support dual-supply voltage translation are AVC, AVCH, AXC, AXCH, AXP, LVC, where the &quot;H&quot; in AVCH and AXCH means &quot;bus hold&quot; feature.

Chips in the above table support the following voltage ranges on either power supply pin:
* AXC = 0.65 to 3.6 V. Only available from Texas Instruments.
* AXP = 0.9 to 5.5 V. Only available from Nexperia.
* LVC = 1.65 to 5.5 V. Available from Diodes Inc, Nexperia, Texas Instruments.

<text>Attagis is a genus of seedsnipe, a South American family of small gregarious waders which have adapted to a vegetarian diet.

These birds look superficially like partridges in structure and bill shape. They have short legs and long wings. Their 2-3 eggs are laid in a shallow scrape on the ground.

The genus was erected by the French ornithologists Isidore Saint-Hilaire and René Lesson in 1831 with the rufous-bellied seedsnipe (&quot;Attagis gayi&quot;) as the type species. The name &quot;Attagis&quot; is the word used for a game bird in Ancient Greek texts. It probably referred to the black francolin (&quot;Francolinus francolinus&quot;).

== Species ==
The genus contains two species:



These are the larger of the four seedsnipe species.

<text>Ronny Rosenthal (; born 11 October 1963), nicknamed &quot;Rocket Ronny&quot;, is an Israeli former footballer who played as a forward.

After starting his career in his birth city with Maccabi Haifa, Rosenthal went on to play in Belgium with Club Brugge and Standard Liège. He moved to Liverpool in 1990 for a fee of £1.1 million, becoming the first non-UK player to move to an English club for more than £1 million. After four years at Liverpool, Rosenthal finished his career with Tottenham Hotspur and Watford.

Between 1983 and 1997 he made 60 appearances for the Israel national team, scoring 11 goals.

==Early and personal life==
Rosenthal was born in Haifa, Israel. His father, who was born in Bucharest, Romania and is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, immigrated to Israel later on. His mother, born in Morocco to a Moroccan Jewish family, also immigrated to Israel. His brother Lior Rosenthal is also a former footballer who played for Maccabi Haifa the Israel national team.

Rosenthal married a Belgian, Nancy, who converted to Judaism. Their two sons, Dean Rosenthal—who was Bar Mitzvah in Israel—and Tom Rosenthal, were born in England. Dean is director of a sporting management company; while Tom, formerly on the books of Queens Park Rangers as a midfielder, formerly played for the Dutch team FC Dordrecht, and has been capped by Belgium at the under-18 and U19 levels—where he scored three goals—and has switched to Israel and was named to its U21 national team in 2018 for the Euro 2019 qualifiers against Germany and Norway.

Rosenthal now resides in London, and has worked as a football agent and consultant. His nephew is Israeli international footballer Denny Gropper.

On 11 May 2019, Rosenthal and his family were subjected to a &quot;terrifying ordeal&quot;, when masked machetes-holding robbers, raided his home in Cricklewood, England.

==Club career==
He was left-footed, and began his playing career with Maccabi Haifa in the city in which he was born in his native Israel, winning two Israeli league titles. Rosenthal left his homeland to sign for Belgian side Club Brugge KV in 1988. He scored 15 goals in two seasons, and won the Belgian league title one season.

After a short spell at Udinese, where he failed to play a single game, and a trial at Luton Town which saw him score twice in three games, Rosenthal joined English side Liverpool on loan in March 1990, as manager Kenny Dalglish looked to increase his options for the forward positions during Liverpool&#x27;s league title run-in. He made his debut for the Reds in a 3-2 win over Southampton at Anfield on 31 March 1990, scoring his first goal for the club eleven days later in a 4-0 away win over Charlton Athletic at Selhurst Park. He scored seven goals in eight Football League First Division games, including a hat-trick against Charlton Athletic, which helped Liverpool secure their third league title in five seasons. His move to Anfield was then made permanent for a fee of £1 million - double the fee which had been quoted before the loan deal was agreed. At Anfield, he became a cult hero.

During the 1990–91 season, Rosenthal faced continued fierce competition for a place in the first team from Liverpool&#x27;s established strikers Ian Rush and Peter Beardsley, and then from mid-season signing David Speedie. He played 16 times in the league, and scored five goals as Liverpool finished second in the league. In 1991–92, Rosenthal played 20 times in the league, but it was a frustrating league campaign for both player and club, as the Reds finished sixth in the league and Rosenthal only found the net three times. Liverpool did win the FA Cup that season, but Rosenthal was not selected for the final. Despite the pre-season departure of both Speedie and Beardsley, Rosenthal was now faced with competition for a place from new signing Dean Saunders. 1992–93 was slightly better, as Rosenthal played 27 games in the new Premier League, and scored six goals, but it was another frustrating season for Liverpool, who finished sixth in the league once again and spent most of the season occupying even lower positions. Saunders had been sold to Aston Villa early in the season, while new signing Paul Stewart proved to be a major disappointment. A memorable occasion during that first Premier League season came when Rosenthal hit the crossbar with a shot on an open goal in a league match against Aston Villa.

With the arrival of Nigel Clough in the summer of 1993, and the breakthrough of Robbie Fowler soon after, Rosenthal played just three league games for Liverpool in 1993–94 and was sold to Tottenham Hotspur in January 1994. Rosenthal scored on his debut in February 1994, in a home defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. He became a regular member of the first team at White Hart Lane, playing 15 league games and scoring twice before the season&#x27;s end. Despite Teddy Sheringham overcoming injury problems, and the close season signing of Jürgen Klinsmann, Rosenthal still managed to appear in 20 Premier League games in 1994–95, though he failed to score. His best form came in the FA Cup, in which he scored five goals in Tottenham&#x27;s run to the semi-final. This included a hat-trick in a 6–2 fifth round replay win at Southampton. Klinsmann was then sold to Bayern Munich and Spurs signed Chris Armstrong, but Rosenthal still played in all but five of Tottenham&#x27;s 38 Premier League games in 1995–96, mostly as a substitute, but only scored one goal.

1996–97 brought a similar story for player and club. For the third consecutive season, Spurs fell short of a UEFA Cup place, while Rosenthal was on the scoresheet only once in the league, and this time was restricted to 20 league appearances. In more than three years in North London, Rosenthal had appeared in 88 league games (55 of them starts) but scored just four goals. He then dropped down two divisions to sign for Watford, and played 30 games over the next seasons and scored eight goals as Watford won back-to-back promotions to reach the FA Premier League. He then retired from playing at the age of 35.

== International career ==
Rosenthal was also a regular member of the Israel national team for most of his career. He won his first senior cap in 1983, and by the time his international career drew to a close in 1997, he had been capped 60 times and scored 11 goals.

<doc id="1027491" wikidata="Q7716847" url="?curid=1027491" title="The Best and the Brightest">
<text>The Best and the Brightest (1972) is a book by journalist David Halberstam of the origins of the Vietnam War published by Random House. The focus of the book is on the foreign policy crafted by academics and intellectuals who were in President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s administration, and the consequences of those policies in Vietnam. The title referred to Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;whiz kids&quot;—leaders of industry and academia brought into the administration—whom Halberstam characterized as insisting on &quot;brilliant policies that defied common sense&quot; in Vietnam, often against the advice of career U.S. Department of State employees.

==Summary==
Halberstam&#x27;s book offers details on how decisions were made in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations that led to the war, focusing on the period from 1960 to 1965 but also covering earlier and later years up until publication.

Factors examined:
* The Democratic Party was haunted by claims that it had &quot;lost&quot; China to the Communists, and it did not want to be accused of also losing Vietnam. Thus, the decision to intervene in Vietnam militarily was based on political expediency, the need to win a second term, and not on rationality.
* The McCarthy era had rid the government of experts on Vietnam and surrounding countries.
* Early studies called for close to one million U.S. troops to defeat the Viet Cong, but it would have been impossible to convince Congress or the U.S. public to deploy so many soldiers.
* Declaration of war and excessive use of force, including bombing too close to China or too many U.S. troops, might have triggered the invasion of Chinese ground forces or greater Soviet involvement, which might repair the growing Sino-Soviet rift.
* The American military and generals were not prepared for protracted guerrilla warfare.
* Some war games implied that a gradual escalation by the United States could be matched by North Vietnam: every year, 200,000 North Vietnamese reached draft age and could be sent down the Ho Chi Minh Trail to replace losses against the U.S.: the U.S. would be &quot;fighting the birthrate&quot;.
* Use of bombing or ground forces would signal the U.S. commitment to defending South Vietnam and subsequently cause U.S. shame if they withdrew.
* President Johnson believed that too much attention given to the war effort would jeopardize his Great Society domestic programs.
* The effects of strategic bombing: Most people believed that North Vietnam prized its industrial base so highly it would not risk its destruction by U.S. air power and would negotiate peace after experiencing limited bombing. Others saw that, even during World War II, strategic bombing united the civilian population against the aggressor and did little to hinder industrial output.
* After placing a few thousand Americans in harm&#x27;s way, it became politically easier to send hundreds of thousands with the promise that, given sufficient numbers, they could protect themselves and that to abandon Vietnam would mean the earlier investment in money and blood would be lost.

The book shows that the gradual escalation allowed the Johnson Administration to avoid early negative publicity and criticism from Congress and to avoid a direct war against the Chinese, but it also reduced the likelihood of either victory or withdrawal.

==Origin of the title==
The title may have come from a line by Percy Bysshe Shelley in his work &quot;To Jane: The Invitation&quot; (1822):

Best and brightest, come away!

Shelley&#x27;s line may have originated from English bishop and hymn writer Reginald Heber in his 1811 work, &quot;Hymns. Epiphany&quot;:

A still earlier, and more pertinent, use of the phrase is in the letter of Junius published February 7, 1769, in the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot;. There Junius uses it mockingly and ironically in reference to King George III&#x27;s ministers, whose capacities he had disparaged in his first letter the previous month. In response to Sir William Draper&#x27;s letter defending one of Junius&#x27; targets and attacking their anonymous critics, Junius wrote:

To have supported your assertion, you should have proved that the present ministry are unquestionably the best and brightest characters of the kingdom; and that, if the affections of the colonies have been alienated, if Corsica has been shamefully abandoned, if commerce languishes, if public credit is threatened with a new debt, and your own Manilla ransom most dishonourably given up, it has all been owing to the malice of political writers, who will not suffer the best and brightest characters (meaning still the present ministry) to take a single right step, for the honour or interest of the nation.

In the introduction to the 1992 edition, Halberstam stated that he had used the title earlier in an article for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and that Mary McCarthy criticized him in a book review for incorrectly referencing the line in the Shelley poem. Halberstam claimed he had no knowledge of the earlier use of the term in the Heber hymn. Halberstam also observed regarding the &quot;best and the brightest&quot; phrase, that &quot;...hymn or no, it went into the language, although it is often misused, failing to carry the tone or irony that the original intended.&quot; In the book&#x27;s introduction and a 2001 interview, Halberstam claims that the title came from a line in an article he had written about the Kennedy Administration.

== Reception ==
The book was highly acclaimed upon release. Victor Saul Navasky, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said it was Halberstam&#x27;s &quot;most important and impressive book&quot;, citing its &quot;compelling and persuasively presented thesis.&quot; Liaquat Ahamed compared its writing style to a &quot;great novel,&quot; praising Halberstam&#x27;s &quot;storyteller&#x27;s talent for capturing people&quot; and ability to write a &quot;compelling narrative.&quot; Steve Mariotti called it his &quot;favorite book.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;Time&quot; named it as one of the 100 best English non-fiction books written since 1923.

== Legacy ==
&quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Marc Tracy reported that Donald Trump&#x27;s chief strategist Steve Bannon was reading the book in February 2017. Tracy drew a parallel between Robert McNamara&#x27;s and Bannon&#x27;s lack of experience in national security.

<doc id="1027499" wikidata="Q6123077" url="?curid=1027499" title="Mr. ZIP">
<text>Mr. ZIP, informally &quot;Zippy&quot;, is a cartoon character used in the 1960s by the United States Post Office Department, and later by its successor, the United States Postal Service, to encourage the general public to include the ZIP Code in all mailings.

==Origins==

The USPS has described the origin of Mr. ZIP as follows:
Mr. ZIP was based on an original design by Howard Wilcox, son of a letter carrier and a member of the Cunningham and Walsh advertising agency, for use by a New York bank in a bank-by-mail campaign. Wilcox&#x27;s design was a child-like sketch of a postman delivering a letter. The figure was used only a few times, then filed away. Later, AT&amp;T acquired the design and made it available to the Post Office Department at no cost. ... Miami-based Post Office Department artist Joe Lawrence retained the face but sharpened the limbs and torso and added a mail bag. The new figure, who Lawrence had dubbed Mr. ZIP, was unveiled at a convention of postmasters in October 1962.

The character&#x27;s original name had been Mr. P.O. Zone, but was changed to Mr. ZIP along with the new term &quot;ZIP code.&quot;

==Post Office use==

The Post Office had little difficulty in getting mass mailers to use the ZIP Code as it could make its inclusion a condition for receiving preferential mailing rates and soon did. However, there was some resistance by the general public, members of whom would mail items without ZIP Code, almost invariably at the full rate for First Class Mail, which by regulation had to be delivered if at all possible and feasible. This was particularly true of older mailers. Mr. ZIP was the Post Office&#x27;s answer to this, apparently intended to teach small children to always use the ZIP Code as they got older and also to encourage their parents and grandparents to do so.

Mr. ZIP is a caricature of a mail carrier, wide-eyed and drawn with his letter bag trailing him in such a way as to imply his travelling at extreme speed, and sometimes holding on to his hat with his free hand. His limbs were very thin, almost like those of a stick figure. He was particularly used on posters promoting ZIP Code use.

Mr. ZIP appeared on the selvage (non-postally valid areas) of stamp panes (more commonly called &quot;sheets&quot;) for many stamp issues, beginning with the 5 cent Sam Houston stamp issued January 10, 1964, although the 5¢ Battle of the Wilderness stamp of May 5, 1964, is sometimes listed as the &quot;first&quot; because it appears earlier in most stamp catalogs due to its inclusion in a five-issue Civil War series. He also appeared on non-postally-valid labels inside, or on the cover of, stamp booklets. Stamp collectors sometimes collect the corner block of four stamps with the part of the selvage bearing Mr. ZIP; these are called &quot;ZIP blocks&quot;. As the Post Office promoted the use of ZIP codes, Mr. ZIP was also displayed in post offices as a 4.5-foot tall plywood figure.
Mr. ZIP was featured prominently alongside the band the Swingin&#x27; Six in a televised Post Office-sponsored variety show. The songs included lyrics such as, &quot;Meet the fellow called Mr. ZIP. What he can do for you will make you really flip. So if you have any further postal demands, we&#x27;re gonna leave you in his hands.&quot;

A corresponding character named Mrs. ZIP was used in local parades and a Mrs. ZIP beauty pageant. The National Postal Museum does not have documentation about her origins.

The character was largely phased out by the late 1970s, but the Post Office retained rights to the copyrighted figure. Mr. ZIP appeared in the blank selvage of United States stamps until January 1986.

The Post Office re-introduced Mr. ZIP to stamps in 2013, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the ZIP Code system.

<doc id="1027505" wikidata="Q1423072" url="?curid=1027505" title="Thury, Yonne">
<text>Thury () is a commune in the Yonne department in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté in north-central France, in the natural region of Forterre. Its inhabitants are called &quot;Thurycois&quot; and &quot;Thurycoises&quot;.

==Name==
Thury&#x27;s is attested as &quot;Tauriacus&quot; in the high medieval &quot;Gesta of the Bishops of Auxerre&quot; (see below); &quot;Thuraco&quot; in 1369 (Pouillé); &quot;Thoriaco&quot; of the fourteenth century (Pouillé). &quot;Tauriacus&quot; originally referred to a field or property of one &quot;Taurus&quot;, possibly &quot;Taruos&quot; in Gaulish. The Gallo-Roman suffix &quot;-acus&quot; or &quot;-acum&quot; is of Gaulish origin and indicates a person&#x27;s property. This suffix (fr) often evolved into &quot;-y&quot; in many French place names, in Thury&#x27;s region and far beyond. An alternative etymology would be from the appellative &quot;turra&quot;, of pre-Latin and possibly Gaulish origin and the root of many toponyms.

Thury&#x27;s hamlets (&quot;hameaux&quot;) include Colangette, Gémigny, Grangette, La Forêt, Le Boichet, Les Grands Moulins, Moulery, and Panny.

==Geography and geology==

The altitude of the village of Thury is 225m. The higher localities on Thury&#x27;s territory are: &quot;Les Grands Moulins&quot;, at 327.5m; &quot;La Justice&quot;, at 327m; &quot;Le Moulin Buteau&quot;, at 325m; &quot;Le Roichat&quot;, at 303.6m; &quot;Le Bois de Mont&quot;, at 301.2m; and &quot;Marchat&quot;, at 292m.

Beyond Thury&#x27;s boundaries, the highest points in the surroundings are at Taingy, 338m; Perreuse, 373m; and the old mill of the &quot;Montagne des Alouettes&quot; on the territory of Sougères, 366.8m. A local belief that the latter&#x27;s name is derived from the Roman Legio V Alaudae is no longer held true, and the name appears to stem from the locale&#x27;s feudal history.

Chalk quarries near the settlement of &quot;Bois de Thury&quot; were exploited from 1850 to 1940.

==History==
Prehistoric traces of human presence in Thury, determined by finds of flint remains, go back to the Neanderthals about 40,000 years BCE. Neolithic objects (ca. 6000–3000 BCE in the region) discovered by Mr Creusard, including a polished stone pestle that was used to crush grain, are held in the small museum inside the church&#x27;s tower. Burgundian palaeographer reported the finding in 1862 of bronze objects (a ring, a hatchet and a key) from the Bronze Age (ca. 3000–1000 BCE) in Thury&#x27;s hamlet of Gémigny.

===Thury before the Hundred Years&#x27; War===

The Roman road from Auxerre to Entrains-sur-Nohain forms part of the boundary between the respective territories of Sougères-en-Puisaye and Thury.

Local tradition holds that the parish was created in 432 CE by Germanus of Auxerre. At any rate, Thury appears to have been a significant parish of the Auxerrois region during the early Middle Ages: it is cited several times in a manuscript started in the late 9th century, the &quot;Gesta episcoporum autissiodorensium&quot;, as a station in the respective itineraries of Bishops Aunarius (&quot;Saint Aunaire&quot;, late 6th century), Tetricius (&quot;Saint Tétry&quot;, late 7th century), and Gerrannus (&quot;&quot;, early 10th century).

The land of Thury was part of the battlefield of the Battle of Fontenoy (841). Echoes of the battle survive in toponyms around the village to this day. For example, the name of the nearby hill and wood of &quot;Roichat&quot; refers to King Charles the Bald (&quot;le roi Charles&quot;), who had established his temporary base camp there.

After 1000 CE, lordship over the land of Thury alternated between the County of Auxerre, its Bishop (long a territorial lord as well), the Count of Champagne, the Count of Nevers, and occasionally the Duke of Burgundy. There is no trace of a specific lordship of Thury during that period though, and it is not clear how significant the village was if indeed it remained inhabited.

===Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Era===
In any event, Thury and the surrounding region suffered greatly during the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages, including the Hundred Years&#x27; War. It was ravaged by roaming armies, especially in 1411 during an episode of the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War and in 1423 in the run-up to the Battle of Cravant. Security did not return until well after the Peace of Arras in 1435. Thury was (re-)populated by newcomers (known as &quot;horsains&quot;, &quot;foreigners&quot;) from other parts of the Kingdom of France. The village castle was built around that time. The church was rebuilt in the late 15th century and completed in 1503, with the portal sculpted in 1521. In 1542, Francis I granted Thury by letters patent the right to hold a weekly market and three fairs a year (and also to erect fortifications around the village), which was reaffirmed by Henry III in 1576 and Louis XIV in 1669.

The region suffered from renewed insecurity during the French Wars of Religion, as it was on the way of the armies of John Casimir of the Palatinate-Simmern in 1576, of Count in 1587, and of in 1617 during the aristocratic uprising against Concino Concini.

The hamlets of Grangette and Colangette, despite being geographically very close to Thury, where under separate jurisdiction as lands of the Abbey of Saint-Germain d&#x27;Auxerre and were only reunited with the rest of the village in 1710.

In 1764, a fire ravaged much of Thury, even though the village castle and church were spared.

====Lordship of Thury after the Hundred Years&#x27; War====

Thury appears to have been part of the lordship of Puisaye at the time it was appropriated by Antoine de Chabannes from the disgraced Jacques Coeur in the early 1450s. Upon his death in 1488, Antoine was succeeded as lord of Puisaye by his son Jean de Chabannes (1462–1503), whose coat of arms was sculpted (and is still extant) at the top of the tower of the church of Thury. As Jean had no surviving son, the lordship of Puisaye was inherited by his daughter Antoinette de Chabannes (1498–1529) and went as dowry to the family of Anjou-Mézières in 1515 when she married René d&#x27;Anjou (1483-ca. 1521). Their son Nicolas d&#x27;Anjou (1518-ca. 1569) sold Thury to Gaspard de Champs (?–1536), lord of nearby , thus separating it from the other lands of Puisaye.

After that, Thury was mostly transmitted through the female line, as was often the case in the early modern period. It thus went to: 
* Marie de Champs (ca. 1528-?), daughter of Gaspard and Françoise de Corquilleroy, and Guillaume de Grossouvre (?–1584), married in 1537; 
* Marie de Grossouvre, daughter of Guillaume and Marie, and Jean de Meung la Ferté, married in 1583; 
* Madeleine de Meung la Ferté, daughter of Jean and Marie, and Pierre de Loynes, married around 1602; 
* Anne de Loynes (1603–1687), daughter of Pierre and Madeleine, and Jean de Richoufftz (1599–1655), a scion of the , married in 1631.

The lordship of Thury fragmented in the mid-17th century and was eventually acquired in 1667–1668 by Louis du Deffand (1624–?), a high-ranking military officer, Marquess of Lalande and lord of Sementron, Fontenoy, Saints, Lain, and other locales. (Le Deffand is a hamlet of Saints.) His son Jean-Baptiste du Deffand (1648–1728) completed the territorial consolidation in 1710 with the acquisition of Grangette, Colangette and Banny. Of his five children, one (Jean-Baptiste Jacques) was the husband of Madame du Deffand; another, Jeanne Antoinette Louise, in 1716 married Joseph François de Castellane de Lauris des Gérards de Vassadel who thus acquired the lordship of Thury. Their son Louis Joseph Marie André Gabriel de Castellane, born in 1738, was the last lord of Thury.

===Since 1800===

As part of the Waterloo campaign, Thury was occupied by Austrian Hussars from 29 July to 5 August 1815, and then briefly by the Bavarian Army.

In 1840, the municipal council under mayor Edme Rouger decided to relocate the cemetery from the village square to its current location in the outskirts. The new cemetery enclosure was completed in 1844. The town hall was built between 1844 and 1861.

There was unrest in Thury following the 1851 French coup d&#x27;état, as in neighboring places in Nivernais and Puisaye. The leaders of the uprising against the coup were pardoned in 1852.

World War I took a heavy toll like in most French villages. 38 local casualties are listed on Thury&#x27;s war monument.

Electrification was conducted in the 1920s, and running water was installed in the late 1930s with the construction of four reservoirs around Thury.

Thury was again occupied by German invaders in June 1940 during World War II. Because it had been equipped with running water ahead of the surrounding villages, a German company camped there, in the park of the Angilbert property. The &quot;Kommandantur&quot; was established in the former post office. An Avro Lancaster Allied bomber on its way to targets in Germany was downed by a Focke-Wulf fighter aircraft above Taingy in the night of 25–26 July 1944, leaving no survivors. Another British plane was downed above the hamlet of Colangette.

The main organised resistance in Thury&#x27;s surroundings was the &quot;Maquis 3&quot;, which started in March–April 1944 in a wood north of Saint-Sauveur. This maquis then had to move east and was established near Thury on the &quot;Montagne des Alouettes&quot; in late July 1944. About 250-strong, the group had weapons parachuted by Allied planes. The village was liberated in August 1944.

Sewage was completed between 1959 and 1962.

Thury had a resident doctor during most of the 19th and 20th centuries. The last village doctor retired in 2011.

==Local government==

The municipality of Thury was created in 1793. It has always been part of the &quot;département&quot; of Yonne. Initially it was the seat (&quot;chef-lieu&quot;) of its own &quot;canton&quot;, part of the &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Saint-Fargeau. In 1801, Thury became part of the canton of Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye and the arrondissement of Auxerre. Following a remodeling of the cantons, Thury has been part of the Canton of Vincelles since 2015.

Thury was part of the , created as one of the new &quot;pays&quot; under the . This &quot;pays&quot; was dissolved on 31 December 2016 and replaced on 1 January 2017 by the , with seat in Saint-Fargeau.

Thury retains a primary school.

==Heritage==

===Church of Saint-Julien===

Thury&#x27;s church is dedicated to Julian of Brioude and was built around 1500, possibly the third or fourth on this location. It was designated a &quot;Monument historique&quot; by order (&quot;décret&quot;) of 4 August 1970. It is representative of the late Gothic architecture of the region.

The original contract for the sculpture of the front portal is preserved in the of Yonne in Auxerre. It was signed on 9 July 1521 between mason Antoine Cas and &quot;ymageur&quot; (sculptor) François Faulconnier at Auxerre. The wooden doors are from the 17th century and were restored in 1751. Three statues of St Peter, St Paul and Jesus Christ, by Parisian sculptor Jean-Georges Poutriquet, were added in 1975.

The relics of Saint Caradoc, known locally as &quot;Caradeuc&quot; or &quot;Caradeu&quot;, are attested since the early 17th century. They were locally believed to have been preserved in 1587 by inhabitants of Thury from the sacking of the church of Donzy, where they had been held since 1180; however, the veracity of this tradition has been questioned. Relics of the church patron Julian of Brioude were donated from Auxerre and Brioude in 1896.

The church&#x27;s stained glass windows were created in the second half of the 19th century, some by Auguste Charlemagne of Toulouse in 1870 and others in the 1880s.

A small museum was opened in 2005 inside the church&#x27;s tower. A major renovation of the church&#x27;s tile roofing was conducted in 2015–2016.

The nearby clergy house (&quot;presbytère&quot;) was rebuilt several times, last in 1843.

===Village castle===

The village castle, or fortified mansion, was built around the mid-15th century as Thury was starting to recover from the Hundred Years&#x27; War. It remained the abode of the local lords of Thury until the 18th century, when absentee lords transformed it into a hostel. , Bishop of Auxerre, stayed there in 1760 to signal his displeasure with the local priest, who was a Jansenist. In 1768 Louis Joseph Marie André Gabriel de Castellane, the last lord of Thury, took residence there again, but in 1786 moved permanently to his Parisian Hôtel particulier on . The property was sold in 1800 to the former lord of nearby Lainsecq. In 1849, the local Briot family purchased it from the family of former mayor Edme Rouger, and still owns and occupies it.

A separate property, on the road towards Saint-Sauveur, is also known locally as the &quot;Château de Thury&quot;. It was built in the late 19th century by Thury-born businessman Casimir Félix Angilbert, who was the village&#x27;s mayor from 1893 to 1913. Angilbert also sponsored the creation in 1900 of a mall of chestnut trees (&quot;Allée des marronniers&quot;) on the other side of the road, leading to the house of his cousin Alix.

===World War I Monument===
The World War I monument stands in the middle of the village square. It was inaugurated in 1925 after six years of preparations. The statue of a resolute &quot;poilu&quot; is a cast of Charles-Henri Pourquet&#x27;s sculpture, &quot;La Résistance&quot;, manufactured by the and also adopted by hundreds of other French villages for the same purpose.

===Old lavoir===

The village lavoir, on the road towards Saint-Sauveur, was built in the early 19th century and is well preserved.

<doc id="1027507" wikidata="Q2390156" url="?curid=1027507" title="Imperial Fascist League">
<text>The Imperial Fascist League (IFL) was a British fascist political movement founded by Arnold Leese in 1929 after he broke away from the British Fascists. It included a blackshirted paramilitary arm called the Fascists Legion, modelled after the Italian Fascists. The group espoused antisemitism and the dominance of the &#x27;Aryan race&#x27; in a &#x27;Racial Fascist Corporate State&#x27;, especially after Leese met Nazi Party propagandist Julius Streicher, the virulently racist publisher of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;; the group later indirectly received funding from the Nazis. Although it had only between 150 and 500 members at maximum, its public profile was higher than its membership numbers would indicate.

After the IFL turned down a merger with the British Union of Fascists in 1932, due to policy differences, the BUF mounted a campaign against the IFL, physically breaking up its meetings and fabricating phony plans that showed the IFL planning to attack the BUF&#x27;s headquarters, which were passed on to the British government.

The Imperial Fascist League went into a steep decline upon the outbreak of World War II, after Leese declared his allegiance to &quot;King and country&quot;, to the displeasure of pro-German members. Nevertheless, Leese was interned under wartime security regulations, and the IFL was not reformed after the war.

==Origins==
Leese had originally been a member of the British Fascists and indeed had been one of only two members ever to hold elected office for them (as a councillor in Stamford). However, he split from the BF around 1927 and decamped to London, where in 1929, he established both the IFL and its organ &quot;The Fascist&quot;. The Fascists Legions, a blackshirted paramilitary arm, was soon added under the command of Leslie H. Sherrard. The group initially advocated such policies as corporatism, monetary reform and the removal of citizenship from Jews. It had no more than 500 members and may have had as few as 150. The group was initially led by Brigadier-General Erskine Tulloch although real power lay with Leese, who was confirmed as Director-General in 1932. Henry Hamilton Beamish, the head of The Britons, served as vice-president of the IFL and was a regular speaker at the movement&#x27;s events.

==Nazism==

The IFL soon shifted away from Italian fascism (it originally used the fasces as its emblem) after Leese had met the Nazi Party propagandist Julius Streicher in Germany. Soon, anti-Semitism became the central theme of IFL policy and its new programme, the &#x27;Racial Fascist Corporate State&#x27;, stressed the supremacy of the &#x27;Aryan race&#x27;. The IFL altered its flag so that it featured the Union Flag superimposed with the swastika. As a result of that conversion, the IFL enjoyed a higher profile than its membership might suggest, in large part due to the funding that it received from Nazi Germany paid through the English correspondent for the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, Dr. Hans Wilhelm Thost. Indeed, by the mid-1930s the IFL had turned against the Italian model so much that it denounced Benito Mussolini as a &quot;pro-Semite&quot; and claimed that the Second Italo-Ethiopian War had been organised by Jews.

==Arrival of the BUF==

In 1932, Robert Forgan approached the IFL and suggested that it should merge into Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists, but the offer was declined. Leese rejected any overtures from Mosley because of the latter&#x27;s initial reluctance to make anti-Semitism a central theme, leading to Leese dismissing Mosley as a &quot;kosher fascist&quot;. He even dubbed the BUF the &quot;British Jewnion of Fascists&quot; over the issue. One of their biggest differences was that the IFL held a biological view of anti-Semitism, the belief that Jews were inherently inferior as a race, in contrast to the BUF, whose eventual adoption of anti-Semitism was framed in ideas about the Jews&#x27; supposed undue influence at the top echelons of society.

By 1933, the BUF decided to act against the renegade IFL, with Blackshirts attacking a number of meetings. The campaign culminated in an incident in Great Portland Street in which 50 Blackshirts disguised as communists invaded the stage to attack Leese before they caused considerable damage to the hall in an attempt to force a large repair bill onto the IFL. The BUF even passed fabricated evidence of an IFL plot to attack its headquarters to the Home Office. By 1939, with the IFL&#x27;s influence diminished, the rivalry had cooled to the point that the BUF bookshop in Canterbury was prepared to stock IFL pamphlets.

Although rejecting a merger with the BUF, the IFL was linked to the Nordic League through Commander E. H. Cole, a staunch advocate of the Russian Czarist hoax &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, who served as chancellor of the League as well as being a leading IFL member. Before long, both Leese and P. J. Ridout also became members of the group, membership of which encompassed most shades of far-right activity.

==Decline==
The outbreak of the Second World War caused the small group to fall apart, as Leese declared loyalty to King and country and renamed the group the Angles Circle but that stance was rejected by some pro-German members such as Tony Gittens, Harold Lockwood and Bertie Mills. The matter proved to be academic, however, as in 1940, Leese was interned under Defence Regulation 18B. In 1946, Leese and six others were arrested for aiding two escaped Dutch prisoners of war who had been members of the Waffen-SS and were planning to flee to Argentina. One of those arrested, Anthony William Gittens, was also a former IFL member, and would join the National Front in the 1960s. All seven men were convicted and each sentenced to one year in prison for their roles in the attempted escape. Leese was released from prison in November 1947. Although Leese continued to be politically active after the war, the IFL was not reformed. His formation of the National Workers Movement in 1948 meant the end for the IFL.

<text>Temple Records is a record label founded in 1978 by Robin Morton, previously a member of The Boys of the Lough.

It is located in Temple, Midlothian. Although Morton is from Ulster, the label is devoted almost purely to acoustic Scottish traditional music.

Morton worked as a producer for Topic Records. This label was not interested in recording the clarsach player Alison Kinnaird, as they did not think the record would sell. He formed Temple Records to release her first LP, &quot;The Harp Key&quot; (1978), which became a best selling traditional music record. Morton later married Kinnaird.

One of the earliest signings was The Battlefield Band, who rapidly rose to international fame. Morton became their manager in 1980. All their albums are on the Temple label. The success of the Battlefield Band in America prompted Morton to set up Temple US Records in the mid-1980s. As well as recordings by current folk artists, the label has released historic recordings by James Scott Skinner.

The Scottish Gaelic &quot;supergroup&quot; Mac-Talla, formed in 1992 at Morton&#x27;s suggestion, was composed wholly of the label&#x27;s artists.

<doc id="1027516" wikidata="Q4684589" url="?curid=1027516" title="Adoption reunion registry">
<text>An adoption reunion registry is a formal mechanism where adoptees and their birth family members can be reunited. Registries may be free or charge fees, be facilitated by non-profit organizations, government agencies or private businesses.

Generally, such adoption registries exist only in countries which practiced &quot;closed adoption&quot;, i.e. adoption in which the full identities of the birth parents, birth family members and the adopting family are not readily disclosed.

Some reunion registries are based on mutual consent and do matches from the information provided by the registrants. Others, run by governmental agencies, have access to the original documents identifying a birth family or adopting family. This is a form of adoption disclosure. In general, adoptees must be adults before they may be given identifying information, or at least age 18. In the United States, state law governs whether such an institution may release this identifying information to the interested party. Some states have an adoption registry, in which both the adopted adult and birthparent must register before information will be provided. In other states, if the adoptee requests information, the organization will contact the birth parent and request consent for a reunion.

In Canada, adult adoptees from British Columbia, Newfoundland, and Ontario generally have access to their own birth and adoption information provided no disclosure veto has been filed. In other provinces/territories, limited access to information is allowed; all jurisdictions have some form of reunion register. 

In the United Kingdom, adoption law has been amended to allow for open adoptions, the right to access one&#x27;s records, and a state-run adoption reunion registry has been established.

Though many such registries are operated by government agencies, many private registries do exist, and can be found on the Web. These tend to be owned and/or managed by members of the adoption community and are generally more successful than government-run registries. 

A problem generally with state-run registries has been the lack of publicity surrounding them. In contrast, in April 2005, the state-run National Adoption Contact Preference RegisterTrace Your Birth Family - Index was launched in Ireland with a national radio and newspaper advertising campaign, and included an application form for the registry being delivered to every household. The Irish registry allows a person using it to specify whether or not they want contact and/or reunion, what form that contact should take (e.g., letter, phone, e-mail), and, if they do not want contact at the time being, still allows for the passing of medical and/or background information to the other party.

<doc id="1027520" wikidata="Q6972574" url="?curid=1027520" title="National Fascisti">
<text>The National Fascisti (NF), renamed British National Fascists (BNF) in July 1926, were a splinter group from the British Fascisti formed in 1924. In the early days of the British Fascisti the movement lacked any real policy or direction and so this group split away with the intention of pursuing a more definite path towards a fascist state. The group had 60 members at its creation, and around 500 at its height.

==Formation==
The National Fascisti&#x27;s leader was Lieutenant Colonel Henry Rippon-Seymour. Members of the National Fascisti were dressed in black shirts in imitation of Benito Mussolini and his followers and received some military drilling, although membership was much too small for them to pose any real threat. Despite their frustrations at the lack of policy from the British Fascisti their own ideas were fairly banal, with vague calls for a government of experts being about as far as they went. Strongly anti-communist, they argued that their aim was to &quot;smash the reds and pinks&quot;. Antisemitism, which at that point was absent from British Fascisti policy, also played a role in the new group. They also called for &quot;racial purity&quot; and the consolidation of the British Empire.

==Development==
The group liked to pull stunts to get attention and in 1925 they hijacked a lorry carrying copies of the left-wing newspaper the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; which they proceeded to crash. The action briefly got them in the headlines as did a meeting at Hyde Park, London where 1000 people attended and finished the day in a pitch battle with Communist Party of Great Britain supporters. The group also ran boxing and fencing clubs to train members although ultimately their strident militarism, which included marching with drawn swords, drew them more derision than support.

Like the British Fascists (BF) they contacted the Home Secretary in the run-up to the 1926 General Strike to offer their services to the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies. Rippon-Seymour refused to follow the lead of BF chairman R. B. D. Blakeney in breaking from fascism and so his offer was turned down flat by the government. As individuals National Fascisti members were however allowed to enter the Special Constabulary during the strike, which many did.

==Disappearance==
Cracks began to show in the group, notably around December 1926 when Rippon-Seymour pulled a sword and an unlicensed gun on Croydon branch leader Charles Eyres after Eyres has accused the leader of defrauding the party out of funds and of dictatorial leadership. Eyres had brought a gang of cudgel-wielding supporters from Kensington to confront Rippon-Seymour whilst the leader&#x27;s use of the Colt revolver, which actually belonged to &quot;Victor Barker&quot;, saw him convicted of both possession of an illegal firearm and common assault at the Old Bailey.

In 1927 a leading member was Victor Barker, a transvestite who spent many years as &#x27;Sir Victor Barker&#x27;, &#x27;Colonel lvor Barker&#x27; and &#x27;Captain Barker. The National Fascisti members did not know he was born female and treated him as a man; Arkell-Smith became secretary to Rippon-Seymour as well as training members in the boxing and fencing clubs.

A series of internal struggles saw them change their name to the British National Fascists on 19 July 1926, under the leadership of Rippon-Seymour. Meanwhile, leading members such as Colonel Ralph Bingham drifted from the group to become active instead in the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies. Such a small group could not withstand internal wrangling and the movement faded from the scene fairly quickly after this.

==Significance==
Despite their general failure the National Fascisti remain significant for being the first group in British politics to attempt to develop fascism as a specifically British ideology. They also helped to launch the political careers of William Joyce and Arnold Leese, who had helped to instigate the split from the British Fascisti and who would go on to greater significance: Joyce became a notorious Nazi collaborator under the codename of &quot;Lord Haw-Haw&quot;, while Leese would go on to establish his own Imperial Fascist League.

<text>Royal Air Force Aldermaston, or more simply RAF Aldermaston, is a former Royal Air Force station located east of Newbury, Berkshire and southwest of Reading, Berkshire, England.

Originally built as an RAF Bomber Command airfield during 1941-1942, Aldermaston was transferred to the United States Army Air Forces in August 1942. Placed under the jurisdiction of Eighth Air Force, it was home to several Douglas C-47 Skytrain Troop Carrier Groups. It was transferred to Ninth Air Force in 1943 primarily as a Troop Carrier Command base. Returned to RAF Control at the end of 1945, it was used by Technical Training Command before being placed on Care and Maintenance. In 1946, it was transferred to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and used by BOAC aircraft for training.

Also used by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for Supermarine Spitfire assembly and flight testing, the airfield closed in 1950 and the site became home of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (later the Atomic Weapons Establishment) from 1950.

==History==

Aldermaston was initially planned as an RAF Bomber Command airfield, being constructed in 1941-1942. RAF 92 Group was programmed to occupy the facility with Vickers Wellington bombers. The facility was constructed as a &quot;Class A&quot; bomber airfield with three concrete runways. The main was 1,830m aligned 06/24, with two crosswind secondary runways of 1,280m aligned 11-29 and 17-35. The airfield had an encircling perimeter track with both the pan and loop-type aircraft hardstands for aircraft parking. The technical site was on the south side of the airfield, consisting of various administrative buildings, maintenance shops and four large T-2 hangars.

===United States Army Air Forces use===
However, to support the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Eighth Air Force in August 1942, jurisdiction of Aldermaston was transferred from RAF Bomber Command to the USAAF. The USAAF assigned station No. 467 to the facility.
USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Aldermaston were: 
* 318th Service Group (53d Troop Carrier Wing)
: 458th, 459th Service Squadron; HHS 318th Service Group
* 21st Weather Squadron
* 40th Mobile Communications Squadron
* 819th Medical Air Evacuation Transportation Squadron (53d Troop Carrier Wing)
* 97th Station Complement Squadron
Regular Army Station Units included:
* 1052nd Quartermaster Company
* 1068th Quartermaster Company
* 1075th Signal Company
* 1229th Military Police Company
* 1465th Ordnance Medium Maintenance Company 
* 2249th Quartermaster Truck Company
* 2142nd Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon
* Detachment ZB (40th Mobile Communications Squadron)
* Weather Detachment ZB

; Aldermaston Court
A non-flying facility located about one-half mine north of the airfield. It is a large country house which was purchased from the Keyser family by the British Government at the outbreak of World War II. Taken over by the USAAF, it became the headquarters of the XIX Tactical Air Command (formerly XIX Air Support Command). It was given the designation of AAF-476.

==== Eighth Air Force ====
; 60th Troop Carrier Group

Due to Aldermaston&#x27;s location in Berkshire, Eighth Air Force decided to use the base to station as a C-47 Troop Carrier base. Upon completion of construction in August, the 60th Troop Carrier Group (60th TCG) was transferred from its temporary locations at RAF Chelveston and RAF Podington in East Anglia, which became heavy bomber bases. The operational squadrons of the 60th TCG were:
* 10th Troop Carrier Squadron (S6) (Arrived 7 August from Chelveston)
* 11th Troop Carrier Squadron (7D) (Arrived 15 August from Chelveston)
* 12th Troop Carrier Squadron (U5) (Arrived 15 August from Podington)
* 28th Troop Carrier Squadron (3D) (Arrived 7 August from Podington)

The unit trained with Army paratroop units during the fall of 1942, preparing for combat operations in North Africa as part of the Operation Torch invasion of French North Africa. It flew its only combat mission on 8 November 1942 when it transported airborne paratroopers from Aldermaston, and dropping them at Oran, Algeria during the early hours of the invasion.

With the successful operation, the group moved to Relizane Airfield, Algeria on 8 November 1942. There, it was transferred to the new Twelfth Air Force where it continued combat operations as part of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations until the end of the war.

; 107th Observation Squadron
With the 60th&#x27;s move to North Africa, the 107th Reconnaissance Squadron, 67th Observation Group, was moved to Aldermaston on a temporary basis from RAF Membury in Berkshire. It flew a mixture of light observation L-4 Grasshopper single engine and Douglas A-20 Havoc two-engine reconnaissance aircraft. It also had several Supermarine Spitfires. The squadron remained only until 8 January 1943 when it was moved back to Membury.

; 315th Troop Carrier Group

Replacing the 60th TCG was the 315th Troop Carrier Group, which was deployed from the Florence Army Airfield, South Carolina in December 1942. Also equipped with C-47s, operational squadrons of the group at Aldermaston were:
* 34th Troop Carrier Squadron (NM)
* 43d Troop Carrier Squadron (UA)

Prior to its arrival, two of the group&#x27;s squadrons were reassigned to Twelfth Air Force in North Africa, and the group only had 24 aircraft assigned while at Aldermaston. On 25 May 1943, twenty-one of the 315th&#x27;s aircraft left for Algeria to support combat operations in North Africa. Although not participating in the airborne phase of the
invasions of Sicily and Italy, the aircraft did support those operations by transporting supplies in the theater.

====Ninth Air Force====
With the reassignment of Ninth Air Force from Libya to the United Kingdom in October 1943, the 315th, along with all of the Eighth&#x27;s Troop Carrier groups were transferred to the Ninth. The remaining components of the 315th TCG were moved to RAF Welford (AAF 474) in Berkshire. Jurisdiction of Aldermaston Airfield was also transferred to the Ninth,

; 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron
In December 1943 the 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron arrived in England from Key Field, Mississippi, It was initially assigned directly to Ninth Air Force, but the squadron arrived un-equipped. Ninth Air Force attached the squadron to the 67th Reconnaissance Group at RAF Middle Wallop (AAF-449) in late December. At Aldermaston, the squadron received Supermarine Spitfires from the Ministry of Aircraft assembly plant and trained with the aircraft until 1 May, when it was moved to RAF Chilbolton (AAF-404) in Hampshire.

; 370th Fighter Group
Delays in base construction and equipment delivery from the United States meant that the 370th Fighter Group arrived at Aldermaston in early February 1944 from Bradley Field, Connecticut un-equipped. Upon its arrival, the group expected to receive Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, however due to a lack of equipment in the United Kingdom, the unit was instead equipped with available Lockheed P-38 Lightnings. Also, Aldermaston was only a way-station for the unit, as the base was already programmed for Troop Carrier units to support the upcoming invasion of Normandy. After receiving the P-38s, the group was moved to RAF Andover (AAF-106) in Hampshire at the end of February.

; 434th Troop Carrier Group

With the transfer of the 370th FG, the 434th Troop Carrier Group was moved to Aldermaston from RAF Fulbeck (AAF-488) in Lincolnshire on 3 March 1944. Its operational squadrons were:
* 71st Troop Carrier Squadron (CJ)
* 72d Troop Carrier Squadron (CU)
* 73d Troop Carrier Squadron (CN)
* 74th Troop Carrier Squadron (ID)

The 434th was programmed to drop the 101st Airborne Division in preparation for the invasion of northern France, and it was located with the 101st. The 434th was one of the groups trained and designated to deliver gliders on D-Day.
As the assigned delivery group for Mission Chicago, the 52 C-47s of the 434th TCG each towed a Waco CG-4A glider to Normandy, losing one aircraft to flak in the darkness. For this, and two follow-up missions with gliders and supplies, the group was later awarded the coveted Distinguished Unit Citation.

After the invasion of France, the mission of the 435th became resupply and casualty evacuation of Allied ground forces on the continent. Supplies transported were, for the most part, critically needed items such as communications equipment and special ammunition In September, the 434th was again assigned the 101st Airborne Division which it transported into the Nazi-Occupied Netherlands as part of Operation Market, the airborne component of Operation Market-Garden. For the balance of 1944, the group returned to conducting resupply and casualty evacuation transport missions.

The 434th remained at Aldermaston until 12 February 1945 when the group moved to an Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) at Mourmelon-le-Grand Airfield (ALG A-80) in France.

With no further USAAF requirement for the station, Aldermaston was returned to the Air Ministry on 15 June 1945.

===Ministry of Aircraft Production use===

In July 1943 Vickers erected a large assembly facility and took over Hangar 5 for Supermarine Spitfire production. Components produced in the Southampton area were sent to the facility for assembly and final aircraft production. This was part of the dispersal program aimed at minimizing aircraft production due to the possibly of German bombing raids. It was co-located in the airfield technical site, and used the airfield along with the USAAF for test-flying newly produced aircraft. It remained in operation at Aldermaston until the Royal Air Force received operational control of the facility in 1946.

In 1949, Fairey Aviation used Aldermaston airfield for the first flight of the first prototype Fairey Gannet, serialled VR546, which was built in its factory at Hayes, Middlesex then taken by road to Aldermaston, reassembled and successfully test flown by the company&#x27;s chief test pilot Gp/Capt R G Slade on 19 September.

===Other units assigned===
; United States Army Air Forces
* HQ, IX Air Support Command (November 1943 - 1 February 1944)
* HQ, 71st Fighter Wing
* HQ, XIX Air Support Command (1 February 1944 - 15 June 1945)
* 370th Fighter Group (12–29 February 1944)
* 434th Troop Carrier Group (3 March 1944 - 12 February 1945)

==Postwar use==

The airfield was relinquished to the Air Ministry on 15 June 1945. It was to be the site for a flying school, where more than 1,000 former RAF pilots would be retrained to fly civil aircraft. Many of the buildings were refurbished and improved runway lights were installed.

From 15 June 1945 the following organisations used the airfield:
* No. 25 (RCAF) Air Crew Holding Unit (25 June - 1 December 1945)
* BOAC Training HQ (9 May 1946 - 1 January 1947)
* Airways Training Ltd (1 January 1947 - November 1948)

In 1950 the airfield was taken over by the Ministry of Supply to house the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (A.W.R.E.).

<text>Alexey Maksimovich Kaledin (; 24 October 1861 – 11 February 1918) was a Don Cossack Cavalry General who commanded the 12th Cavalry Division and Russian Eight Army during World War I. He also led the Don Cossack White movement in the opening stages of the Russian Civil War.

==Early years==
Kaledin attended the Mikhaylovskoye Artillery School and the General Staff Academy.

==World War I==
Kaledin served as a cavalry commander at the beginning of the war, before taking over command of a cavalry corps, and rising to the rank of General of the Cavalry. He was then assigned command of the 8th Army on the Southwest Front, participated in the Brusilov offensive, and won the Battle of Lutsk.

Kaledin spoke at the Moscow State Conference, stating &quot;all Soviets and committees must be abolished, both in the army and in the rear.&quot; Following the Kornilov affair, Kaledin retreated back to Novocherkassk, and protection of the &quot;voisko&quot;, to avoid arrest by the Provisional Government.

When he was 55 years old, the Cossack &quot;krug&quot; had elected Kaledin as their ataman. According to Peter Kenez, Kaledin &quot;...thus became the first democratically chosen leader of the Cosacks since 1723.&quot;

==Civil War==
According to Kenez, &quot;On November 9, immediately after receiving news of the Petrograd revolution, and acting in the name of the &quot;voisko&quot; government, he invited the members of the Provisional Government to Novocherkassk to join him in organizing the anti-Bolshevik struggle.&quot; On 15 November, Mikhail Alekseyev arrived and started organizing a new army. On 20 November, the &quot;voisko&quot; declared its independence. On 5 December, Kaledin declared martial law when news came of a Red Guard detachment had been sent by the Soviet regime. Between 9 and 15 December, with the aid of the Alekseev Organization, Kaledin was able to suppress Bolshevik resistance in Rostov-on-Don, and then open the third session of the &quot;krug&quot;. On 19 December, Lavr Kornilov arrived, and by the end of the month, had reorganized the Alekseev Organization into the Volunteer Army. By January 1918, Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko was threatening Rostov and Taganrog with a force led by Sivers. On 8 February, Sivers had taken control of Taganrog, and Kornilov decided to retreat from the Don.

The ensuing loss of Rostov-on-the-Don and the Volunteer Army&#x27;s retreat during their Ice March led Kaledin to believe that the whole situation had become hopeless. On 11 February, he resigned from his post and committed suicide by shooting himself.

<doc id="1027535" wikidata="Q1503081" url="?curid=1027535" title="Shanachie Records">
<text>Shanachie Records is an American, New Jersey–based record label, founded in 1975 by Richard Nevins and Dan Collins. The label is named for the Gaelic word &quot;seanchaí&quot; (anglicised as shanachie), an Irish storyteller.

It was previously distributed by Entertainment One Distribution.

Starting as a label that specialized in fiddle music, they began releasing work by Celtic groups such as Planxty and Clannad. Other genres on the label include Latin American, African music, soul, country, and ska. In 1989 they acquired Yazoo Records from Nick Perls. This allowed them to release vintage jazz and blues recordings. Today they have another imprint, Shanachie Jazz.

In 1992 Shanachie began releasing CDs by folk singer-songwriters including Richard Shindell, Dolores Keane, John Stewart, Rod MacDonald, Richard Meyer, Karan Casey, Sue Foley, Four Bitchin&#x27; Babes, Kevin Gordon, Tommy Makem &amp; Liam Clancy (Makem and Clancy), and others.

In 1980 Shanachie released its first reggae album, &quot;King Tubbys Meets Rockers in a Firehouse&quot; by Augustus Pablo, and soon after released albums from many reggae artists including Rita Marley, Culture, Bunny Wailer, Judy Mowatt, Alpha Blondy, Lucky Dube, The Skatalites and others. Shanachie was the U.S. liaison for the UK-based reggae label, Greensleeves Records, until about 1987. Shanachie also released material for Augustus Pablo under the Message imprint of his company, Rockers International. The Grammy Award–winning Soweto Gospel Choir releases albums on Shanachie Records, as has Grammy-nominated Liquid Soul.

The Latin acts on the label include Los Jovenes del Barrio.

<text>Peter Franz Schweizer (born November 24, 1964) is an American political consultant and writer. He is the president of the Government Accountability Institute (GAI), senior editor-at-large of far-right media organization &quot;Breitbart News&quot;, and a former fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution.

Schweizer wrote &quot;Clinton Cash&quot;, a 2015 book discussing donations made to the Clinton Foundation by foreign entities and Bill and Hillary Clinton&#x27;s income after they left the White House in 2001. Journalists and fact-checking organizations have criticized the book for speculation, conclusions not supported by the evidence presented, and for factual errors which were corrected in the Kindle edition.

==Early life==
While in high school, Schweizer attended the National Conservative Students Conference at George Washington University and was a member of Young America&#x27;s Foundation (YAF). He graduated from Kentridge High School in Kent, Washington in 1983. Schweizer then attended George Washington University and, subsequently, graduate school at St Cross College of Oxford University on YAF scholarships. He was on YAF staff starting 1993 and edited its magazine.

==Career==
In 2012, Schweizer and Steve Bannon co-founded the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative think-tank whose stated goal is to &quot;investigate and expose government corruption, misuse of taxpayer money and crony capitalism.&quot; Schweizer is president of the organization. It is registered as a nonpartisan organization, but largely focuses on the Democratic Party.

==Investigative projects==
Schweizer&#x27;s early work at Senator Jeremiah Denton&#x27;s National Forum Foundation (NFF) focused on the Cold War. He co-authored a &quot;National Review&quot; article with Denton&#x27;s son, James (often cited as Jim), &quot;Murdering SDI&quot;, about the suspicious deaths of several European officials who supported the Strategic Defense Initiative. While at the NFF, Schweizer also published a report titled &quot;The Meaning and Destiny of the Sandinista Revolution&quot;.

In 2012, journalist Steve Kroft used Schweizer&#x27;s work as the basis for a report on CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; about Congressional insider trading. Titled &quot;Insiders: The road to the STOCK act&quot;, Kroft relied heavily on Schweizer&#x27;s reporting in his 2011 book &quot;Throw Them All Out&quot;, which CBS independently verified, to demonstrate how members of Congress trade stocks unethically, and inoculate themselves from prosecution. The following year, Kroft revisited Schweizer&#x27;s work to create another &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report on how members of Congress use the funds of their political action committees for private inurement.

==Books==
Schweizer co-authored two novels, published in 1997 and 2005, with former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger.

===&quot;Friendly Spies&quot;===

Schweizer&#x27;s second book, published in 1992, purported to reveal espionage by the French secret service on the British government between 1984 and 1987. A follow-up by two &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reporters revealed that meetings described by Schweizer in &quot;Friendly Spies&quot; did not check out, sources were named that did not exist or could not be found, and the hotel in which the meetings allegedly had taken place did not exist at the time.

===&quot;Victory&quot;===

In 1994, The Atlantic Monthly Press published Schweizer&#x27;s book &quot;Victory: The Reagan Administration&#x27;s Secret Strategy that Hastened the Collapse of the Soviet Union.&quot; The book argued that President Ronald Reagan brought an end to the Cold War through a policy of massive defense spending which led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Historian Stephen E. Ambrose criticized the book, writing that &quot;there is a great deal more to the Soviet collapse than Schweizer recognizes, and in any case, it is difficult to take seriously a book as badly written as this one... The book is consistently redundant and badly out of balance.&quot; The book later enjoyed renewed popularity with foreign policy officials during the Trump administration, with one White House official telling reporters &quot;it was &#x27;no secret&#x27; that the book has had some influence on policy.&quot;

===&quot;Clinton Cash&quot;===

In 2015, HarperCollins published &quot;Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich&quot;, a 256-page book discussing the donations made to the Clinton Foundation by foreign entities. Several media outlets received advance copies, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and Fox News, all of whom agreed to pursue stories found in the book. While promoting the book, Schweizer falsely claimed that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had veto power to stop the sale of Uranium One to a Russian state-owned company.

&quot;Time&quot; wrote that &quot;allegations are presented as questions rather than proof&quot; but that &quot;the book&#x27;s dark suggestions reflect the growing problem Clinton faces in her run for the White House in 2016 as more and more details of the foundation&#x27;s fundraising activities present the appearance of impropriety and lack of transparency during her time as Secretary of State.&quot; 

Several journalists challenged the book, writing that it contains &quot;leaps of logic,&quot; that it &quot;draws some conclusions that go beyond the available evidence,&quot; that &quot;[p]arts of Schweitzer&#x27;s reporting fell apart under scrutiny,&quot; and that &quot;Schweizer is trafficking in speculation.&quot;

The book was found to contain several factual errors, including the false claim that Clinton played a central role in the sale of Uranium One to a Russian state-owned company while the Clinton Foundation was receiving large donations. Several weeks after the book&#x27;s initial publication, HarperCollins and the author made several corrections to the Kindle edition of the book, amending &quot;seven or eight&quot; passages.

In the wake of the book&#x27;s publication, the Clinton Foundation admitted that it made mistakes in disclosing some of its contributions and that it implemented new rules increasing financial reporting and limiting foreign donations.

The book was funded by the Mercer Family Foundation with a $1.7 million contribution in 2015 to the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) whose researchers Schweizer used.

===&quot;Secret Empires&quot;===

In 2018, HarperCollins published &quot;Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends&quot;. &quot;Secret Empires&quot; provided details about the overseas business conducted by Hunter Biden, particularly in his employment with entities such as Ukrainian energy firm Burisma. The book also describes ties between Elaine Chao&#x27;s family business Foremost Group and China, which were disputed by a spokesman for Chao&#x27;s husband, Senator Mitch McConnell.

The book &quot;was perfectly timed for the Presidential campaign&quot; and has been cited as an initial source of the Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory. It was given significant coverage on Fox News which gained Republican nominee Donald Trump&#x27;s attention and led him to send personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to pressure their new government to investigate the claims in Schweizer&#x27;s book. Trump&#x27;s efforts eventually resulted in a major scandal that culminated in his first impeachment.

&quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported that the book contained 14 examples of plagiarism, including from Wikipedia. The passages in question contained similar wording to those of several Wikipedia articles, particularly the articles on Patrick R. Daley, Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Tom Steyer, and Jared Kushner. In addition to the Wikipedia articles, other passages, while citing news articles properly, contained similar wording to the cited sources.

==Films==
Schweizer worked with Steve Bannon on &quot;In the Face of Evil: Reagan&#x27;s War in Words and Deed&quot;, a 2004 documentary about former Hollywood movie star and president Ronald Reagan, which is based on Schweizer&#x27;s book &quot;Reagan&#x27;s War&quot; (2003); Schweizer is credited as Executive Producer. 

Schweizer is credited as a writer and producer in &quot;The Creepy Line&quot;, a film that &quot;epitomizes a popular claim that Silicon Valley is censoring American conservatives on web platforms.&quot;

==Activities==
During 2008 and 2009, Schweizer served as a consultant to the Office of Presidential Speechwriting in the White House. In March 2009, Schweizer and fellow White House speechwriter Marc Thiessen opened Oval Office Writers LLC, which specializes in preparation for congressional testimony as well as pitching opinion editorials and book proposals. Schweizer&#x27;s notable clients have included Sarah Palin, and he advised her on foreign policy.

Schweizer is a member of the Research Advisory Council of the James Madison Institute, a free-market think tank headquartered in Tallahassee, Florida.

==Criticism==
Schweizer admitted he overreached in attacking Hillary Clinton&#x27;s purported role in approving a Russian uranium deal and falsely claimed that then-Secretary of State Clinton &quot;had veto power&quot; to stop the Russian State Atomic Nuclear Agency (Rosatom) from purchasing Uranium One. During a May 5, 2015, &quot;Politico&quot; podcast interview, Schweizer admitted that &quot;veto is probably not the best word&quot; and &quot;what I meant by veto power was as we explain the process, you know, if somebody objects it kicks in the special investigation.&quot; 

In a 2015 NBC interview, Schweizer said that Hillary Clinton did not support a nuclear deal with India in 2006 and that she voted for it in 2008, after donations to the Clinton Foundation. PolitiFact rated Schweizer&#x27;s claims false.

==Personal life==
Schweizer lives in Tallahassee, Florida with his wife, Rhonda, and step-children. He and his first wife, Rochelle Schweizer, co-authored books about Disney and the Bush family. They met when she was working with the National Forum Foundation (NFF), which in 1997 merged with Freedom House.

<text>Tomasz Ludwik Stańko (; 11 July 1942 – 29 July 2018) was a Polish trumpeter and composer associated with free jazz and the avant-garde.

In 1962, Tomasz Stańko formed his first band, the Jazz Darings, with saxophonist Janusz Muniak, pianist Adam Makowicz, bassist Jacek Ostaszewski, drummer Wiktor Perelmuter. Inspired by Ornette Coleman and the innovations of John Coltrane, Miles Davis and George Russell, the group is often cited by music historians as the first European group to play free jazz. In his later years, he collaborated with pianist Krzysztof Komeda on Komeda&#x27;s album &quot;Astigmatic&quot;, recorded in late 1965. In 1968, Stańko formed a quintet whose members were Janusz Muniak (tenor and soprano saxophones, flute), Zbigniew Seifert (alto sax and violin), Bronisław Suchanek (bass), Janusz Stefański (drums, percussion). In 1975, he formed the Tomasz Stańko-Adam Makowicz Unit.

Stańko established a reputation as a leading figure not only in Polish jazz, but internationally as well, working with musicians including Jack DeJohnette, Dave Holland, Reggie Workman, Rufus Reid, Lester Bowie, David Murray, Manu Katché and Chico Freeman. From 1984, he was a member of Cecil Taylor&#x27;s big band.

== Biography ==
===Early years===
Tomasz Stańko was born in Rzeszów, Poland, on 11 July 1942. His first encounters with jazz were through Voice of America radio programs and tours initiated by the U.S. State Department. Coming of age in Communist Poland, Stańko was impressed by the correlation jazz had with a message of freedom. In 1958 he saw his first jazz concert given by Dave Brubeck. Along with the pianist Adam Makowicz and with the saxophonist Janusz Muniak, the group took inspiration from the music of musicians such as Ornette Coleman, George Russell and Miles Davis and was considered by many critics to be the first group in Europe to perform in the free jazz idiom.

In 1963 Stańko joined the Krzysztof Komeda quintet, where he learned much about harmony, musical structure and asymmetry. During his career with Komeda, which concluded in 1967, Stańko did five tours with the pianist and recorded eleven albums with him. In 1968 Stańko formed a quintet that met critical acclaim—one that included Zbigniew Seifert on violin and alto saxophone. In 1970, he joined the Globe Unity Orchestra, and in 1971 he collaborated with Krzysztof Penderecki and Don Cherry. Not long after he formed a quartet that included himself, saxophonist Tomasz Szukalski and Finnish drummer Edward Vesala. His performances with Vesala are often considered to be some of his most important work. In 1975, he formed the Tomasz Stańko-Adam Makowicz Unit.

===1980s and 1990s===
During the 1980s, he traveled to India and recorded solo work in the Taj Mahal, and also worked with Chico Freeman and Howard Johnson in Vesala&#x27;s solo album Heavy Life. He was featured in a profile on composer Graham Collier in the 1985 Channel 4 documentary &#x27;Hoarded Dreams&#x27; In the mid-1980s, he began doing extensive work with Cecil Taylor, performing in his big bands and also led various groups of his own, including COCX (with Vitold Rek and Apostolis Anthimos). Then, before returning to ECM Records, Stańko also worked in a trio that included himself, Arild Andersen and Jon Christensen. In 1993, Stańko formed a new quartet composed of the then 16-year-old drummer Michał Miśkiewicz, along with Miśkiewicz&#x27;s two friends, pianist Marcin Wasilewski and bassist Sławomir Kurkiewicz. That same year he also formed an international quartet that included Bobo Stenson, Tony Oxley and Anders Jormin. in 1994 the quartet released their first ECM recording titled &quot;Matka Joanna&quot;. In 1997, Stańko formed a group which performed the songs of pianist Krzysztof Komeda, touring London, Copenhagen, Stockholm and appearing at jazz festivals like those in Nancy and Berlin. The idea for the project came from ECM president Manfred Eicher.

Stańko lost his natural teeth in the 1990s, although over time he developed a new embouchure with the help of a skilled dentist and monotonous practice. He would spend long hours playing what he deemed to be &quot;boring&quot; long tones which helped to strengthen his lip, in spite of playing with the disadvantage of false teeth.

===2000s===

The early 2000s was a time of extensive international touring. This experience led to a second album of Stańko&#x27;s Polish quartet &quot;Suspended Night&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine noted that this album was one of the bestselling jazz albums of 2004 in the United States. Together with &quot;Suspended Night&quot; ECM released a collection of Stańko&#x27;s recording in its Rarum/ Selected Recordings series.

In 2005 the quartet recorded the last joint album &quot;Lontano&quot;, again for ECM. Having an established position on the world jazz stage, each album of the quartet as celebrated across Europe and the United States. In 2005 the band also made its first tour around Asia and Australia. In 2005 Stańko also created music for the Warsaw Uprising Museum titled &quot;Freedom in August.&quot;

The second half of the first decade 2000 saw a new resurgence in Stańko&#x27;s career: a chapter of experiments, creating projects, searching for new sounds. As a result of these experiences, in 2007 a new band, a Scandinavian quintet composed of Alexi Tuomarila, Jakob Bro, Anders Christensen and Olavi Louhivuori, was formed, with which Stańko recorded the 2009 album &quot;Dark Eyes&quot; for ECM.

===Later years===
The end of the first decade of the 21st century marked the beginning of the New York period in Stańko&#x27;s life. His move to Manhattan saw him give regular concerts in New York venues and clubs, such as Birdland, Jazz Standard and Merking Hall. Stańko used the opportunity to meet with local musicians and absorbed new ideas and richness of sounds. New projects were spontaneously created, including those with Lee Konitz, Craig Taborn, Thomas Morgan, Gerald Cleaver, Chris Potter and others. The idea of the New York Quartet was forming which, after various combinations, eventually formed in 2012.
Stańko&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Desperado&quot; was published in Poland in 2010, a multi-part interview conducted by Rafał Księżyk. In November 2010 he took part in the &quot;Dzień Szakala&quot; (The Day of the Jackal) charity concert, in Warsaw, in aid of saxophonist Tomasz Szukalski. In 2011 the Smithsonian Institution, the world&#x27;s largest museum and education and research complex, published the six-disc compilation &quot;,&quot; which closes with &quot;Suspended Night Variation VIII&quot; by Stańko.

The second decade of the 21st century saw the emergence of Stańko&#x27;s new poetry-based project. Its beginnings date back to 2009 when Jerzy Ilg, editor-in-chief of Znak Publishing House, invited the trumpeter to one of the last poetry nights of Wisława Szymborska. During the meeting at the Kraków Opera, the poet read her poems, with Stańko accompanying her on the trumpet. The CD recording from this concert was incorporated with &quot;Here&quot;, the next volume of poems published by Szymborska. Meeting the poet became the key to a new stage in Stańko&#x27;s career and some of her poems provided the inspiration for new compositions and titles. He dedicated to her his album &quot;Wisława&quot;, recorded with a new New York quartet featuring Thomas Morgan, Gerald Cleaver and David Virelles, and released by ECM in 2013.

in 2014 Stańko was invited to compose a suite on the occasion of the opening of the core exhibition of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews. It was released as the album &quot;POLIN&quot;, recorded in New York with Ravi Coltrane, David Virelles, Dezron Douglas and Kush Abadey.

Stańko last studio album &quot;December Avenue&quot; was released on 31 March 2017. Reviewing the album &quot;The Guardian&quot; jazz critic John Fordham wrote: &quot;Nobody holds a single, long-blown trumpet note like the Polish pioneer Tomasz Stańko – a wearily exhaled, soberly ironic, yet oddly awestruck sound that is unique in jazz.&quot;

On 14 January 2014, Stańko received the &quot;Polityka Passport&quot; for his work as a cultural leader. On the same day, in Paris, the l&#x27;Académie du jazz, under the leadership of François Lacharme, awarded him the Prix du Musicien Européen – the European Music Award of the Year – for his current achievements and his lifetime achievement.

On 15 January 2014, he received one of the three honorary Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik (PdSK) awards, granted by an independent association of over 140 music journalists from Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

Stańko was the organizer and director of the Jazzowa Jesień festival in Bielsko-Biała, Poland. He also became a member of the honorary committee supporting Bronisław Komorowski before the presidential elections in Poland in 2015.

In March 2018, due to suspected pneumonia, his April concerts were cancelled. Stańko died of lung cancer, in the oncological hospital in Warsaw on 29 July 2018. The following day ECM Records published a video tribute to Stańko, on its YouTube channel, entitled &quot;Remembering Tomasz Stanko&quot;. Fellow musician Dave Holland praised him as &quot;a unique musician with deep feelings and a gentle soul&quot;.

==Critical appreciation==

Derek Richardson, writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said, &quot;Tomasz Stanko is not the first jazz musician to negotiate a rapprochement between gorgeous melodies and free improvisation. But he is one of the most eloquent proponents of extemporaneous lyricism working today.&quot; Author Brian Morton compared Stanko&#x27;s lyricism to that of Miles Davis, calling it a &quot;direct but individual offshoot.&quot;

<text>The 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the sixth edition of the Gold Cup, the soccer championship of North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF).

The tournament was once again held in the United States, in Miami and Pasadena. The format of the tournament stayed the same as in 2000: twelve teams were split into four groups of three. The top two teams in each group would advance to the quarterfinals. Ecuador and South Korea were invited from outside CONCACAF.

Canada, who rode the coin toss all the way to winning the 2000 Cup, needed luck once again, as all games in Group D ended with a 2-0 result. Lots were drawn, with Canada and Haiti moving on to the next round; Ecuador did not. But the Canadian team&#x27;s luck ran dry in the semifinals, as the U.S. beat them on penalties after tying 0-0. The United States then met Costa Rica in the final and topped them 2-0 behind goals by Josh Wolff and Jeff Agoos for their first tournament win since 1991.

During the tournament, Cuban players Alberto Delgado and Rey Angel Martinez defected from Cuba to the United States.

<text>The Steese Highway (known as the Steese Expressway within Fairbanks) is a highway in the Interior region of the U.S. state of Alaska that extends from Fairbanks to Circle, a town on the Yukon River about 50 miles (80 km) south of the Arctic Circle. The highway was completed in 1927 and is named for U.S. Army General James G. Steese, a former president of the Alaska Road Commission. It is paved for about the first and around the town of Central it turns to dirt and gravel. Much of it is narrow and winding.

==History==

The highway and surrounding region has a long association with gold mining. It was built to service the Circle Mining District, which was very productive in the 1890s, before the discovery of gold in the Klondike. Both historic sites, such as Felix Pedro&#x27;s 1902 gold discovery which resulted in the founding of Fairbanks, and the preserved gold camp at Chatanika, and active dredging operations line the road.
==Route description==

The Steese Highway is numbered Alaska Route 6 for most of its length, except for the first 11 miles (17 km) from Fairbanks to Fox, which are numbered Alaska Route 2. The highway has been designated as a National Scenic Byway.

There are three possible road closure barriers, so 511 Alaska should be checked before traveling its length to Circle Alaska.

<doc id="1027557" wikidata="Q1327771" url="?curid=1027557" title="Elemental (Tears for Fears album)">
<text>Elemental is the fourth studio album by English pop rock band Tears for Fears, released on 7 June 1993 by Mercury Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album recorded following the departure of co-founder Curt Smith, with Roland Orzabal assuming sole leadership with the help of additional musicians.

The album peaked at No. 5 in the UK and No. 45 in the US; it also reached the top 10 in France and Italy, the top 20 in Canada and the top 30 in several European countries. It has been certified Silver in the UK, and Gold in the US, Canada and France. The single &quot;Break It Down Again&quot; was a hit across Europe and North America, and was the band&#x27;s last single to reach the US top 40.

&quot;Elemental&quot; was the last album that Tears for Fears released under the Phonogram/Mercury label, the company to which the band had been signed since 1981.

==Production==

&quot;Elemental&quot; was the first new Tears for Fears album in four years, following 1989&#x27;s &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot;. However, despite being released under the Tears for Fears moniker, it is essentially a solo effort by Roland Orzabal, as Curt Smith had left the band in 1991. Regarding the split with Smith, Orzabal stated in 1993, 

Orzabal publicly downplayed Tears for Fears&#x27; loss of Curt Smith, stating, &quot;The relationship I had with Curt was like that of a producer to an artist... I&#x27;d help him get his vocals right and even write his songs for him. It wasn&#x27;t really a shared thing.&quot; Smith released his first solo album, &quot;Soul on Board&quot;, on 23 August 1993, over two months after the release of &quot;Elemental&quot;.

For much of the writing and recording of &quot;Elemental&quot;, Orzabal was assisted by musician Alan Griffiths (1959–2017), a longtime acquaintance who had collaborated with Tears for Fears before. In 1978, Griffiths became a founding member of the Bristol band Apartment, which became the new wave music band The Escape in 1981. In early 1983, The Escape signed with Phonogram Records, making the band label-mates with Tears for Fears. In late 1983, The Escape was Tears for Fears&#x27; support act; the band broke up in late 1984 and Griffiths and Escape bandmate Nicky Holland became session musicians for Tears for Fears&#x27; 1985 world tour. Holland played keyboards on Tears for Fears&#x27; &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot;, co-writing the majority of that album&#x27;s songs, and her former bandmate Griffiths took on a similar songwriting role for the first Tears for Fears album sans Curt Smith. Orzabal later recalled, &quot;When I split up with Curt, I wrote with Alan Griffiths and we were extremely prolific. We&#x27;d come up with a song virtually every day. Al was a bit of a genius, able to make musical sketches that were easy to jump off and finish into a song. That was an amazing period, and it&#x27;s tougher to write with people you don&#x27;t know yet.&quot;

&quot;Elemental&quot; was recorded at Orzabal&#x27;s newly built home studio, Neptune&#x27;s Kitchen, and was co-produced by Orzabal, Griffiths and Tim Palmer. Palmer&#x27;s recent credits at the time included co-producing David Bowie&#x27;s first Tin Machine album (1989&#x27;s &quot;Tin Machine&quot;) and mixing Pearl Jam&#x27;s debut album &quot;Ten&quot; (1991). Orzabal stated, &quot;I&#x27;m kind of used to working autonomously... I would say that this album is less of a solo album than &quot;Seeds of Love&quot;, in fact. The team I worked with was amazing—Tim Palmer the co-producer, and Alan Griffiths, who co-wrote the stuff.&quot; Parts of the album have a more alternative rock sound than on previous Tears for Fears albums; this sound would be explored further in the next Tears for Fears album, &quot;Raoul and the Kings of Spain&quot; (1995), which Orzabal also recorded with Griffiths and Palmer. (Griffiths would also collaborate with Orzabal on the latter&#x27;s first and only official solo album, &quot;Tomcats Screaming Outside&quot; [2001].)

Interviewed twenty years after the release of &quot;Elemental&quot;, Palmer recalled, &quot;In the 80&#x27;s, [Tears for Fears] had a reputation for spending a lot of time making records, but that&#x27;s just the way they are. I tried to speed things up and got the record done in six months—not much of an achievement, but it was fast for them.&quot; Orzabal had a recording studio built at his home to record the album, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s an old photographer&#x27;s studio that we converted. It was called Neptune&#x27;s Kitchen, and we used a lot of copper that was doused in acid to look like it&#x27;s been underwater and all the colors are sort of greens and blues like the sea. And there&#x27;s a weathervane on top of the building which is a whale... It was necessary, economically, to work at home because I spend so long in the studios on albums that the bills mount up, and doing it at home was a sensible move.&quot;

Tim Palmer recalled, 

Palmer enjoyed a good working relationship with Orzabal during the recording sessions for &quot;Elemental&quot;, recalling, &quot;Roland is very into star signs. Before we started working on the record, he mapped out a composite star chart of us both, and he read it and said that he thought we would get along very well together, which we did.&quot;

==Songs==
Curt Smith&#x27;s departure from Tears for Fears influenced Roland Orzabal&#x27;s songwriting for the new album; Orzabal stated that &quot;a lot of the songs were written while I was in a sense going through the &#x27;divorce&#x27;... Things like &quot;Break It Down Again&quot; refer to that to some degree, and &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot;, obviously. I did psychotherapy for about six years. I stopped going regularly when I&#x27;d finished [the song] &quot;Elemental&quot;, which I think probably says something. I think I&#x27;m moving on.&quot; 

The first single from &quot;Elemental&quot;, &quot;Break It Down Again&quot;, was a relatively successful release, making both the UK and US top 25 singles charts. When Smith (who rejoined Tears for Fears in 2000) was asked in 2022 what his favorite &quot;Curt Smith-less Tears for Fears songs&quot; are, Smith answered, &quot;I have come to really like &#x27;Break It Down Again&#x27;. We play that song nowadays and I enjoy playing it.&quot;

&quot;Cold&quot; was the second single from &quot;Elemental&quot; to be released in the UK, but was not released in the US. According to Orzabal in the &quot;Elemental&quot; EPK, the song was inspired by an encounter with a German photographer who was trying to take pictures of him while he was on-stage. The photographer tried to get Orzabal&#x27;s attention but he was not in the mood for photos and kept turning his face away. He eventually received a note from the photographer asking &#x27;how can someone who makes such warm music to be so cold&#x27;. The first 2 verses of the song describe this event. The song&#x27;s lyrics, written by Orzabal, contain also references to prior associates of Tears for Fears such as the line &quot;Listened to my old friend Nockles, hoped that it would warm the cockles&quot;. &quot;Nockles&quot; is the nickname of former Tears for Fears keyboardist Nicky Holland, Orzabal&#x27;s songwriting partner for much of the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot;. Orzabal also takes a swipe at former Tears for Fears business manager Paul King with the lyric &quot;King got caught with his fingers in the till. Where&#x27;s your calculator, will you leave it in your will?&quot; after alleged discrepancies were discovered in King&#x27;s prior management of the band&#x27;s financial affairs. King declared bankruptcy in 1990 and, after being found guilty of later fraudulent activities, was imprisoned in 2004 and disqualified from being a company director for a period of ten years. According to Orzabal, &quot;After the breakup [with Smith], things were a complete mess on the business end as well... So I was on my own, without a manager, without anybody that was familiar. And I needed to go through that. You can hear it on a song like &#x27;Cold&#x27;, where I say &#x27;Look, I need distance, I need to be on my own, I don&#x27;t want a relationship.&#x27;&quot;

The closing track of &quot;Elemental&quot;, &quot;Goodnight Song&quot;, was released as the album&#x27;s second single in the US (in lieu of &quot;Cold&quot;). It was also released as a single in some parts of Europe, although not in the UK. The &quot;Cold&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Song&quot; singles both featured the song &quot;New Star&quot; as a B-side; this song can be heard on &quot;Gloryland World Cup USA 94&quot;, the official album of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. It can also be heard during the opening credits of the 1994 film &quot;Threesome&quot; and appears on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album, and was later included in the Tears for Fears compilation albums &quot;Saturnine Martial &amp; Lunatic&quot; (1996) and &quot;&quot; (2001).
The title track of &quot;Elemental&quot; was released in early 1994 as the album&#x27;s third US single; the maxi CD version contains live tracks recorded from a Tears for Fears concert at Wembley Stadium on 14 December 1993.

Smith is also the subject of &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot;, a song Orzabal referred to as his &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; (John Lennon&#x27;s scathing 1971 song about his former Beatles bandmate and songwriting partner, Paul McCartney.) Of his relationship with Smith at the time, Orzabal stated, &quot;I think it&#x27;s similar to the animosity between a parent and a child; the parent wants the child to grow up and the child doesn&#x27;t want to grow up. You know, for fuck’s sake, get out of the nest!&quot; The opening lyrics of &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot; are a salvo against Smith (&quot;You always said you were the compassionate one/But now you&#x27;re laughing at the sun/With all your high class friends you think you&#x27;ve got it made/The only thing you made was that tanned look on your face/With all your cigarettes and fancy cars/You ain&#x27;t a clue who or what you are/You&#x27;re dreaming your life away...&quot;). The song also makes references to &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; (the studio in which &quot;Elemental&quot; was recorded), Arthur Janov&#x27;s book &quot;The Primal Scream&quot; (a major influence on Orzabal and Smith&#x27;s lives and the first Tears for Fears album &quot;The Hurting&quot;), and the 1983 Tears for Fears song &quot;Memories Fade&quot;. Smith later responded to &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot; with the song &quot;Sun King&quot; in his album &quot;Mayfield&quot; (1998). In 2022, Smith said, &quot;I get a real kick out of &#x27;Fish Out of Water&#x27;, which is about me in a very derogatory way. I found it highly amusing.&quot;

The song &quot;Dog&#x27;s a Best Friend&#x27;s Dog&quot; contains a reference to Samuel Beckett&#x27;s play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (&quot;Tell Mr. Godot I&#x27;m walking the dog&quot;) and the album&#x27;s penultimate track, &quot;Brian Wilson Said&quot;, is in part a Beach Boys pastiche. The title is a backhanded reference to the Van Morrison song &quot;Jackie Wilson Said (I&#x27;m in Heaven When You Smile)&quot;, which Morrison wrote about one of his idols, Jackie Wilson. Similarly, Orzabal wanted to write a song about one of his idols, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.

==Tour==

Tears for Fears supported &quot;Elemental&quot; with a live tour of North America that took place between August and November 1993, followed by one concert in Paris and four in the UK in December 1993. The band assembled for the tour comprised Roland Orzabal on vocals and lead guitar, Alan Griffiths on keyboards and guitar, Gail Ann Dorsey on bass, Brian MacLeod on drums, Jeffrey Trott on guitars, and Jebin Bruni on keyboards. Orzabal retained this band for the recording sessions of the next Tears for Fears album, &quot;Raoul and the Kings of Spain&quot; (1995), which was recorded between 1993 and 1994. The 1993 set lists, on occasion, featured covers (a live recording of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Creep&quot; was released as a B-side in 1996, and the song remained a staple of the band&#x27;s live shows until 2019) as well as new songs, some of which would appear on &quot;Raoul and the Kings of Spain&quot; and its B-sides, while &quot;Size of Sorrow&quot; wasn&#x27;t released until 2004 with Curt Smith now singing the song (Gail Ann Dorsey had sung it in concert).

Regarding the &quot;Elemental&quot; tour, Orzabal stated at the time, 

==Critical reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the album finds Mr. Orzabal straining self-consciously to make grand statements that lack the concision and spontaneity of Tears for Fears&#x27; best early work. It also has an undertone of meanness.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;the sampled guitar bursts and nifty studio tricks, like Squeeze mimicking the Beatles, keep you obediently humming while Orzabal plays teen-neuroses word games.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; thought that the album &quot;essentially upholds Orzabal’s dedication to create remarkable textures and settings for essentially ordinary pop songs sprung from his bristly, remote and self-critical personality.&quot;

Upon its release in 1993, &quot;Elemental&quot; received a positive review in &quot;Rolling Stone magazine&quot;. Rating the album four stars out of five, the review states,

Notes
*To date, &quot;Elemental&quot; has never been re-released with bonus tracks, although a half-dozen songs released as B-sides during the &quot;Elemental&quot; era were included in the Tears for Fears compilation album &quot;Saturnine Martial &amp; Lunatic&quot; (1996).
*&quot;Elemental&quot; was the last Tears for Fears studio album released by Mercury Records although it was not the last album recorded by the band for Mercury. &quot;Raoul and the Kings of Spain&quot;, recorded between 1994 and 1995, was originally scheduled to be released by Mercury, and promo editions of the album were circulated under the Mercury imprint. However, &quot;Raoul and the Kings of Spain&quot; was eventually released in October 1995 by Sony&#x27;s Epic Records after Tears for Fears signed with that label.

<text>The Jacobite peerage includes those peerages created by James II and VII, and the subsequent Jacobite pretenders, after James&#x27;s deposition from the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland following the Glorious Revolution of 1688. These creations were not recognised in English, Scots or Irish law, but the titles were used in Jacobite circles in Continental Europe and recognised by France, Spain and the Papacy.

Jacobite peerages ceased to be created after 1760 except for a title created by the &quot;Young Pretender&quot;, Prince Charles Edward Stuart, for his illegitimate daughter in or before 1783. The following tables list the peerages and baronetcies created by the Stuart claimants in exile.

==Sources==
An authoritative list of the Jacobite peerage does not exist. The standard source relied on is &quot;The Jacobite Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage and Grants of Honour&quot; published in 1904 by Melville Henry Massue, who called himself &#x27;Marquis de Ruvigny et Raineval&#x27;. However, as a source, it is unreliable. Peter Drummond-Murray of Mastrick noted in an article in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot; that:
==Dukes==

==Marquesses==

==Earls==

==Viscounts==

==Barons and Lords of Parliament==

===Barons in the peerage of England===

<text>Reagan&#x27;s War is a 2002 book by Peter Schweizer.

== Synopsis ==
The book covers Ronald Reagan&#x27;s actions during the Cold War, and credits him with the eventual end of the Cold War.

== Reception ==
The book received mixed reviews. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; praised Schweizer&#x27;s writing style, while criticizing the book&#x27;s hagiographical approach to history. Walter Russell Mead gave the book a positive review in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Kirkus Reviews called the book a &quot;tendentious and extremely partisan account&quot; of Reagan&#x27;s presidency and the Cold War. The book was later adapted into a film titled &quot;In the Face of Evil: Reagan&#x27;s War in Word and Deed&quot;.

<doc id="1027563" wikidata="Q28195059" url="?curid=1027563" title="Chinese television drama">
<text>Chinese television dramas (), sometimes colloquially known as C-dramas, are Chinese-language television drama series originating from mainland China, sometimes including co-productions with the Greater China region. Popular drama series genres in mainland China include fantasy romance, period costume, contemporary urban and thriller dramas. These dramas are also subjected to stringent regulatory supervision from the Chinese government.

China produces the most television drama episodes per year and has the largest number of domestic television viewers in the world. It is also the second largest video streaming market in the world by revenue. Chinese television dramas are regularly broadcast and streamed throughout Asia; particularly in Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Cambodia.

== History ==

=== 1958–1980: Early years ===
The first mainland China-produced television program, &quot;One Piece of Cake&quot; (), was aired in 1958, after the launch of China&#x27;s first television station, Beijing TV Station (later rebranded as China Central Television, or CCTV).

Other provincial television channels were launched in the subsequent years, including Shanghai Television, Jiangsu Television, Guangdong Television and Hunan Television. From 1958 to 1966, 200 drama anthologies were broadcast, although ownership of television sets was not widespread. During the cultural revolution from 1967 to 1976, the only entertainment allowed on Chinese television were eight revolutionary operas, three war movies and some song renditions. Fictional dramas returned in 1978 with &quot;San Jia Qin&quot;, the first mainland drama filmed on location. Meanwhile, across the straits in Taiwan, the first long-form Mandarin television series &quot;Jing Jing&quot; was aired in 1969 on China Television, and the 1970s saw more familial dramas with heavy political tones produced by the three Taiwanese terrestrial channels, as martial law continued to be in enforcement.

=== 1980s: Expansion of state-run television channels ===
In 1980, the first drama series &quot;Eighteen Years in Enemy Camp&quot; was aired on state-run CCTV. Domestic demand for programming increased as television viewers increased from 80 million in 1978 to 1.1 billion by 1986. Besides importing foreign shows, China began to produce many costume drama series. Long-form TV adaptions of classic Chinese novels and folklore include &quot;Outlaws of the Marsh&quot; (1983), &quot;Ji Gong&quot; (1986), &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; (1987) and &quot;Journey to the West&quot; (1988).&quot;&quot;

In 1987, the Republic of China (ROC) government lifted the travel ban to mainland China, and in 1988, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) government started courting ROC investments in the PRC with guarantees to safeguard their assets, visitation and legal rights. The Chinese state regulators introduced a permit system allowing for private and independent investors to co-produce television series with state-run media entities in the late 1980s as part of its market reforms. The thawing of cross-straits relations resulted in a series of co-productions between the two regions in from the 1990s to 2000s. Taiwanese romance novelist Chiung Yao and her team began working in mainland on several television series, either based on her novels or original screenplays. Period drama &quot;My Fair Princess&quot; (1998), a collaboration between Chiung&#x27;s production company and Hunan Broadcasting System, was a success in both regions and widely sold in other Asian markets.

=== 1990s–2000s: Rise of satellite channels and rapid commercialization ===
The 1990s also marked the start of satellite broadcast of Chinese television networks and the rapid commercialization of television programming in the form of advertising. China Central Television and other provincial channels like Zhejiang Television, Anhui Television, Jiangsu Television, Dragon TV and Hunan Television began expanding their satellite network coverage and diversifying programming offerings. Family drama &quot;Ke Wang&quot; (1990), immigrant story &quot;A Native of Beijing in New York&quot; (1993), and sitcom &quot;I Love My Family&quot; were some of the contemporary dramas aired on prime-time television. &quot;Fortress Besieged&quot; (1990), a period drama adapted from the satirical novel by Qian Zhongshu, was critically acclaimed. The first mainland-produced idol romance drama &quot;Cherish Our Love Forever&quot; was also aired in 1998.

Since the 1990s, historical serials have been the dominant genre on prime-time television. The trend peaked in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with many palace (also known as &quot;Qing&quot;) dramas shown on television. Fictionalized drama series based on well-known ancient figures like &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (1994) &quot;and The Legend of Liu Yong&quot; (1996) continued to draw strong ratings. Producers like Zhang Jizhong and Wong Jing also started making the mainland television adaptations of classic wuxia novels, such as those written by household names Jin Yong and Gu Long. Critical reception to shows such as &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot; (2003), &quot;The Proud Twins&quot; (2005) and &quot;Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils&quot; (2003) were mixed and they are often compared to previous adaptations from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Investment groups like Hengdian Group expanded into movie and television production in the mid-1990s, building large filming sets for different dynastic (and Republic) periods. Hengdian&#x27;s large film set in eastern Zhejiang was said to have accommodated at least 70% of China&#x27;s films and TV shows at one point. Established Hong Kong television production companies like TVB also began producing dynastic period dramas such as &quot;A Step into the Past&quot; (2001) and &quot;War and Beauty&quot; (2004) in mainland China due to the availability of such sets.

After the turn of the millennium, Chinese historical fantasy romance dramas started gaining popularity, eventually overtaking the market share of adaptations of &quot;wuxia&quot; novels that were popular in the previous decades. Seasoned Hong Kong director Lee Kwok-lap produced the hugely popular &quot;Chinese Paladin&quot; (2005), the television adaption of the first installment of the &quot;Sword and Fairy&quot; video game series, contributing to the popularity of &quot;xianxia&quot; and &quot;xuanhuan&quot; (fantasy) genres in the mainland entertainment landscape. As these fantasy shows are often not tied to a specific dynasty or era, scriptwriters and designers had more creative leeway in their production, often mixing elements of Chinese mythology with modern humor and romance elements that is noticeably different from the stoic, honorable themes in wuxia genres.

=== 2010s: Regulatory changes and emergence of streaming television ===
Historical period dramas continued to be popular in the early 2010s. Imperial power struggle drama series with female leads set in the Qing dynasty such as &quot;Empresses in the Palace&quot; (2011), &quot;Scarlet Heart&quot; (2011) and &quot;Story of Yanxi Palace&quot; (2018) became an important side genre in mainland China, although the genre has since come under regulatory criticism for its &quot;extravagance and negative influence on society&quot;.

A series of escalating protectionist measures were issued by the regulatory body in the mid-2010s. In 2014, the Chinese government announced that imported foreign films and TV series required publication licenses in order to be aired within China. Korean dramas, then one of the most popular drama genres in China, as well as Korean-Chinese co-productions, were banned from both broadcast and streaming services in 2016, following the THAAD missile deployment disagreement between China and South Korea. Regulators also banned the broadcast of foreign television shows during prime-time slots and issued quotas on the number of imported content on streaming video platforms in 2018. At the same time, streaming television took off in China as technology giants Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba invested more in their own Chinese productions under their respective streaming business units iQiyi, Tencent Video and Youku. Traditional terrestrial broadcasters also started partnering with streamers to deal with declining TV viewership. Since the mid-2010s, intellectual property (IP) adaptation rights of popular online novels, video games and comics were in huge demand as television adaptations of such works started becoming common, examples of which include the adventure series &quot;The Lost Tomb&quot; (2015), danmei novel adaptation &quot;The Untamed&quot; (2019), as well as historical political dramas &quot;Nirvana in Fire&quot; (2015) and &quot;Joy of Life&quot; (2019&quot;).&quot; Between 2018 and 2019, 42 out of 100 of the top television series were adapted from web fiction.

Since the 2000s, celebrity-driven television dramas have allocated a significant portion of their production budgets to actor salaries in order to attract viewership. Hong Kong television producer Gary Yeung Siu-hung noted in a 2006 interview that mainland actors may command salaries 2 to 5 times higher than their Hong Kong or Taiwanese counterparts with comparable popularity. In 2016, Shanghai Media Group executive Wang Leiqing acknowledged that up to 76% of production costs could be attributed to actor pay. For example, the two lead actors of the 2018 series &quot;Ruyi&#x27;s Royal Love in the Palace&quot; reportedly received a combined total of over 150 million yuan for the 87-episode series. In 2020, the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) issued a notice stipulating that television actors&#x27; salaries must not surpass 40% of the total production cost. Furthermore, the pay for lead actor cannot exceed 70% of the total actors&#x27; salaries.

=== 2020s–present: Streaming dominance and rise of micro-dramas ===
During the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China, all television productions were halted in February 2020, and filming resumed 1 to 2 months later. The number of application for distribution licenses of television drama in 2020 decreased by around 26% compared to 2019.

By the early 2020s, streaming television services like iQiyi and Tencent Video had reached more than 100 million monthly paying subscribers respectively, with the market reaching saturation and fragmentation. Monetization and profitability became paramount for the major tech-backed streamers as long-form videos is increasingly considered as part of their more mature business units. In early 2024, Tencent CEO Ma Huateng expressed the corporation&#x27;s focus on premium flagship dramas, which he identified as &quot;The Long Season,&quot; &quot;Three-Body&quot; and &quot;Blossoms Shanghai&quot;, in order to build brand reputation and draw user subscriptions, instead of having many smaller productions which provided little commercial and brand value. After the massive success of its 2023 criminal drama series &quot;The Knockout&quot;, iQiyi leaders also stated their focus on quality content instead of celebrity star power in their drama series, with a focus on genre series and high investment epic drama series.

Television productions also had to compete with short video and live-streaming social media like Bytedance&#x27;s Douyin and Kuaishou for user screen time. Short web dramas, also known as mini-dramas or micro-dramas (), became increasingly popular on Douyin, Wechat and Kuaishou. According to iiMedia Research, revenue of Chinese mini dramas reached 37.39 billion yuan in 2023, an increase of 267.65% from the previous year. Each episode of a mini series lasts from seconds to several minutes and are also subject to regulatory scrutiny of the NRTA.

== Characteristics ==
Other Chinese-language dramas such as Taiwanese dramas, Hong Kong dramas, and Singaporean dramas may sometimes be attributed as Chinese dramas, although each region has a distinctly different filming style, editing format and colloquial terms.

Long-form Chinese television series vary in quality, although since the mid to late 2010s, observers have noted an increase in production values and script quality in some series.

Many Chinese television series end each episode in a cliffhanger. Also, a number of Chinese television series used music from Hollywood movies as incidental music. The channel CCTV-8 airs TV series around the clock. Episodes usually begin with opening theme music over credits as well as an ending theme music with additional credits.

== Format ==
Chinese television series can be in the forms of anthology series, serial, mini-series and micro-series.

Anthology series such as &quot;Strange Tales of Liao Zhai&quot; (2005) and &quot;Medal of the Republic&quot; (2021) feature multiple standalone stories and with a different set of characters, while long-form serials tell a story with an overarching plot over many episodes. The average episode per drama series is around 30-40 episodes, which each episode lasting between 40 and 60 minutes. Prior to 2020, some non-sitcom Chinese television serials such as &quot;Empresses in the Palace&quot; could go up to 76 episodes and more. Some screenwriters have admitted to increasing episode count by dozens at the request of investors, incorporating unnecessary padding to the story. In February 2020, regulators have imposed a maximum limit of 40 episodes for show length, with a recommendation for producers to aim for no more than 30 episodes to maintain production quality.

Mini-series in China such as crime drama &quot;The Bad Kids&quot; (2020) and &quot;The Long Season&quot; (2023) tell a more concise story over 10 to 24 episodes and usually conclude within a season.

Micro-dramas, also known as mini-dramas, are serialized dramas minutes in length per episode. These shows are meant to be watched on mobile devices on Douyin and WeChat. These series utilize a hybrid monetization model, combining subscription-based access with pay-per-view options for individual episodes.

== Genres ==

Chinese drama genres range from romance, comedy, horror, family drama, sports, thriller, wuxia, xianxia, nationalist, political or a mixture of these in the form of ancient, historical, Republican era or modern contemporary settings.

There is a significant preference for romance television series in Asia. According to a 2019 study, 14% of the Chinese series in production were romance-themed, compared to 6% in United States. Conversely, crime and thriller genres are underrepresented in China.

Since the 1990s, main melody () and tribute dramas () have become common. Main melody dramas are television series with patriotic and propagandist undertones, while tribute dramas are shows that are partially commissioned or subsidized by CCTV (or other government entities) to celebrate and mark major milestones of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). These series are usually aired on free-to-air satellite channels CCTV-1 or CCTV-8. In 2018, the National Radio and Television Administration (or NRTA, previously known as the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television) came up with an overall planning guide to select 100 tribute dramas to be aired between 2018 and 2022, series under the selection should be guided by the Xi Jinping Thought, with storylines that are realistic, moralistic and promoting Chinese nationalism and Core Socialist Values. In 2019, China banned historical dramas and idol dramas in the period leading up to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The state censorship regulator announced that television channels should only broadcast programs that focus &quot;on different historical aspects that show the great struggle of the Chinese nation as its people have stood up and become richer and stronger&quot;. Audience reaction to some of the government-approved shows are mixed, some examples of those with higher ratings and critical review include &quot;Perfect Youth&quot; (2018) and &quot;Like a Flowing River&quot; (2021). Other popular commercial thrillers such as the 2017 hit series &quot;In the Name of the People&quot;, and the 2023 series &quot;The Knockout&quot;, focus on the heroic story of the protagonists fighting against corruption under the CCP&#x27;s auspices. These shows have become more sophisticated as the industry adopts more nuanced plots and higher production standards.

== Censorship ==

Mainland-produced dramas have also been the targets of censorship, either explicitly with directives from the National Radio and Television Administration, or implicitly due to self-censorship from the production companies and streamers.

There is no content rating system for television dramas in China. Creatives are often required to adhere to explicit directives from the NRTA, in order to pass the government review process. The guidelines do not have judicial validity, and sometimes changes over the years, but members of the television association follow them as a form of &quot;self regulation&quot;.

=== Moral and cultural ===
In many cases, scriptwriters and producers have followed regulatory guidelines by &quot;adopting a positive ending where the good triumphs over evils and making the protagonist a morally good person&quot;. Shows can also be censored after airing. In mid-2015, the Chinese regulators criticized several shows for promoting ‘Western lifestyles,’ cleavage, smoking, drinking, adultery or themes such as time travel and reincarnation. Period drama series such as &quot;Story of Yanxi Palace&quot; and &quot;Ruyi&#x27;s Royal Love in the Palace&quot; were pulled from streaming services after a direct reprimand from a party-aligned newspaper, the &quot;Beijing Daily&quot;, for not promoting socialist values, as they &quot;propagated a luxurious and hedonistic lifestyle, encouraging admiration for imperial life and a glorification of emperors overshadowing the heroes of today&quot;.

In 2022, the NRTA called for an end to the wildly-popular &quot;dangai&quot; () television genre, which consisted of television adaptations of gay-themed online novels; male actors were also discouraged from looking &quot;effeminate&quot;.

=== Political ===
Politically sensitive dramas such as &quot;Towards the Republic&quot; (2003) were either heavily censored or outright banned from reruns and on-demand streaming services, as they portrayed historical characters like Empress Cixi and Nationalist leaders in a sympathetic and complex manner, and political ideologies that are not aligned with the Communist Party movement.

=== Blacklisted talent ===
Some television dramas are also banned or heavily cut due to the behavior of their cast and crew. In 2014, the SAPPRFT (now NRTA) specifically put out a statement banning celebrities who have used drugs or visited prostitutes () from state television and other media outlets. Television actors such as Huang Haibo and Gao Hu&#x27;s productions were immediately dropped from broadcast.

Celebrities that were blacklisted by the China Association of Performing Arts and other government bodies due to scandals involving tax evasion, sexual assault and unpatriotic behavior may have their scenes cut, obfuscated, their faces swapped digitally by AI, or have their entire filmography pulled from syndication and streaming services.

== Production companies ==
Since the 2010s, several production companies have emerged as the main drama production and distribution companies for the major streaming networks and the largest state-run channels, often representing industry interests and setting TV production standards as a collective. The six major television drama companies in mainland China include Daylight Entertainment (), Huace Media (), New Classics Media (), Linmon Media (), Ciwen Media () and Shanghai Youhug Media ().

== Dubbing ==
Chinese dramas are often dubbed by professional voice actors. This is due to the fact that almost all mainland dramas are required to be aired using putonghua, the standard Mandarin dialect, and many Mandarin-speaking actors have regional accents. To standardize the pronunciation throughout the production, voice actors trained in standard Mandarin are employed in post-production. Subpar filming conditions may also result in poor audio quality and ambient noises, which requires post-production editing. Voice acting is also sometimes used to improve an actor&#x27;s otherwise poor performance. Censorship may also require changing some lines in post-production.

It usually takes one month to do the dubbing for 30 to 40 episodes in post-production. Popular voice actors may dub several series a year and are well-known figures to fans. There are actors who are usually not dubbed, including Hu Ge, Wang Kai, Jin Dong, Jiang Xin and Deng Chao.

<doc id="1027566" wikidata="Q6900965" url="?curid=1027566" title="Monkseaton">
<text>Monkseaton is an area of Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, in the county of Tyne and Wear, England. Historically in Northumberland, it is in the north-east of the borough, from the North Sea coast and north of the River Tyne at North Shields. to the north of Monkseaton, the extensive built-up areas of North Tyneside change abruptly into green belt stretching north into south-east Northumberland. It is at an elevation of above sea-level.

== History ==

Monkseaton pre-dates the Tyneside coastal resort of Whitley Bay, originally recorded as land owned by the Priory of Tynemouth. The first documentary references to Monkseaton medieval village date from the early 12th century (c.1106–16) when Henry I granted Seton, later to be renamed Monkseaton, to Tynemouth Priory. It was a substantial village in the late 13th century, when Monkseaton Manor was one of ten manors of Tynemouth Priory, with fifteen bondsmen, ten cotmen and three freeholds listed in 1292.

The remains of a medieval brewery wall are still to be seen alongside the &quot;Monkseaton Arms&quot; public house.

In the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales of 1872, the population was recorded as 421 in 80 houses; this gave the village an area of 1,110 acres. It was described as having a large brewery and several collieries.
Although Monkseaton has been subsumed in the urban developments of the 20th century, it still retains much of the character of the village it once was. It is a designated conservation area.

Monkseaton was formerly a township in the parish of Tynemouth, in 1866 Monkseaton became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1913 the parish was abolished to form Whitley and Monkseaton. In 1911 the parish had a population of 2971.

On 30 April 1989, one person was killed and 14 others injured in a mass shooting known as the Monkseaton shootings.

On 28 June 2012, the village suffered flash flooding following torrential rainfall in the North East of England. Roads were closed causing traffic chaos, and many properties and buildings were flooded, including Langley First School which was closed for three weeks. The heavy rainfall made an embankment on the Tyne and Wear Metro line collapse, causing houses in Brantwood Avenue to be evacuated and West Monkseaton Metro station to be temporarily closed. Many residents suffered significant flood damage to their homes and possessions.

== Transport ==
Monkseaton is served by two stops on the circular Tyne and Wear Metro which connects it to Newcastle, both of which are on the former Blyth and Tyne Railway. Monkseaton station was moved to its current position in 1915 and the tennis courts in Souter Park South are now where the station was originally located. West Monkseaton station opened in 1933 and is a rare example of the Art Deco architectural style applied to a railway station in the United Kingdom. 

Another rail route, heading north up the coast, is now disused and has been adapted into a footpath and cycle route leading to the A190 road that links Seaton Sluice to the town of Seaton Delaval.

== Facilities ==
Churchill Playing Fields are located within the vicinity and the North Tyneside International Youth Football Tournament takes place here every year. Bowling greens, tennis courts and a cricket pavilion accompany the park.

Monkseaton has three centrally-located pubs situated close to each other on the north side of Front Street, the main thoroughfare of the village. Heading west from Monkseaton station, the first of these is the Monkseaton Arms, next is the Black Horse, and finally, set back from the street somewhat, is the Ship Inn. Two other pubs, the Hunting Lodge and the Beacon, are located west and north not far from West Monkseaton Metro station. There are several local schools, including Monkseaton Middle School, Valley Gardens Middle School, Monkseaton High School and Whitley Bay High School.

== Notable residents ==
*Ian La Frenais – comedic writer, of e.g. &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;
*Denise Welch – actress, dancer and television presenter
*Gladstone Adams – inventor and former chairman of Whitley Bay Urban District
*Enid Stamp-Taylor - actress (17, Percy Avenue, Whitley Bay)

*Changing numeral bases, such as converting from base 2 (binary) to base 10 (decimal). This is known as base conversion.
*The logarithmic change-of-base formula, one of the logarithmic identities used frequently in algebra and calculus.
*The method for changing between polynomial and normal bases, and similar transformations, for purposes of coding theory and cryptography.

<text>Ryszard Jerzy Gryglewski (: ; 4 August 1932 – 30 January 2023) was a Polish pharmacologist and physician. He is known for co-discovering prostacyclin. He was a Member of the Polish Academy of Learning (PAU) and the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN). He was the recipient of Sir Hans Krebs Medal as well as Poland&#x27;s highest order of merit, the Order of the White Eagle.

==Life and career==
Gryglewski graduated in medicine from the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, where he also wrote his doctorate in Pharmacology and in 1971 became a professor. In 1965, he was appointed as the head of the Department of Pharmacology at the Medical Academy in Kraków. He was a member of many pharmacological associations around the world and since 1993 president of the Jagiellonian Medical Research Centre (&quot;Jagiellońskie Centrum Badań Medycznych&quot;).

His scientific work concerned experimental pharmacology. His research focused on the contribution of the blood-vascular system in building up immunity against thrombosis in the development of sclerosis. In 1976, together with S. Bunting, J. Vane and S. Moncada, he discovered prostacyclin, which set off many further scientific discoveries.

In 1975, he showed that the inhibition of the release of arachidonic acid represents the mechanisms of action of glucocorticosteroids.7 His study describing discovery of the free radical mediated mechanism underlying the regulation of nitric oxide stability was published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1986.

Together with Andrzej Szczeklik, he was involved in the research on the so-called “aspirin-induced asthma” (AIA) and contributed to the concept that this disease is not caused by sensitization to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but results from the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase type 1 (COX-1) pathway.

Among his other notable discoveries was the fact that antiplatelet drugs, such as Clopidogrel, exert a strong fibrynolitic effect in the mechanism depentent on the endothelial cells. 

Gryglewski died in Kraków on 30 January 2023, at the age of 90.

==Awards and honours==
In 1997, he was awarded the Prize of the Foundation for Polish Science for a series of studies on the regulation of thromboresistance.

In 2002, he received the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta from President Aleksander Kwaśniewski for &quot;outstanding merits in his scientific and didactical work&quot;.

In 2004, he received Sir Hans Krebs Medal of the Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS).

On 20 January 2017, he was awarded Poland&#x27;s highest decoration, the Order of the White Eagle, by President Andrzej Duda for his &quot;distinguished contributions to the development of pharmacology and clinical medicine&quot;.

<doc id="1027578" wikidata="Q289327" url="?curid=1027578" title="Epaphroditus (freedman of Nero)">
<text>Tiberius Claudius Epaphroditus or Epaphroditos (Greek: Ἐπαφρόδιτος; born c. 20–25 – died c. 95), was a freedman and secretary of the Roman Emperor Nero. He was later executed by Domitian for failing to prevent Nero&#x27;s suicide.

==Name==
His name originates from the Greek language and means &quot;lovely, charming&quot; combined with the name Aphrodite. This is preceded by the Greek preposition &#x27;ep&#x27; which simply means &#x27;for&#x27; thus indicating that this man was named with the intention of his life being dedicated to or for the Greek goddess Aphrodite. The Romans often gave slaves of Greek origins illustrious names from Greek mythology and culture, for example Claudius&#x27;s freedman Narcissus, Nero&#x27;s freedman Polyclitus and Antonia Minor&#x27;s freedwoman Caenis.

==Life==
It is not known for certain who Epaphroditus&#x27; master was, but it is likely that he was freed by the Emperor Claudius (41–54). Because freedmen usually accepted the name of their former master, as an Imperial freedman, the official name of Epaphroditus would have probably been Tiberius Claudius Epaphroditus, to which Augusti libertus (&quot;freedman of the emperor&quot;) could be added, if he was indeed emancipated by Claudius.

Epaphroditus was an Imperial freedman and secretary (&quot;a libellis&quot;), which means that he drafted the Emperor Nero&#x27;s replies to petitions. He is mentioned as &quot;apparitor Caesarum&quot;, which means that he was some sort of servant of the Imperial Family, but his specific duties are not mentioned.

According to Tacitus, Epaphroditus learned in 65 AD that a group led by the senator Gaius Calpurnius Piso had organized a coup. Epaphroditus immediately reported it to the Emperor and Piso and his fellow conspirators were arrested. After the conspirators had been executed Epaphroditus received military honours. He was now a wealthy man and owned the Horti Epaphroditiani, large villa-gardens on the Esquiline Hill, east of the Domus Aurea (&quot;Golden House&quot;), which Nero had started to construct after the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD.

During the later conspiracy which did put an end to Nero&#x27;s rule, Epaphroditus accompanied his master in his flight. When Nero attempted to kill himself (9 June 68 AD), Epaphroditus assisted him.

For rendering this assistance to Nero, however, Epaphroditus had afterwards to pay with his own life: Domitian first banished and afterwards ordered Epaphroditus to be put to death (), because he had not exerted himself to save the life of Nero. It is likely that this execution is one of the main reasons that, about a year later, Domitian was assassinated by court officials.

Epaphroditus was the owner of Epictetus of Hierapolis, a Stoic philosopher taught by Musonius Rufus.

The man named Epaphroditus to whom Josephus dedicated his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; was most likely someone else by the same name, who may have been a freedman of Emperor Trajan; it is disputed whether he may have been the same Epaphroditus mentioned by St. Paul in the New Testament &quot;Epistle to the Philippians&quot;.

<doc id="1027583" wikidata="Q2820903" url="?curid=1027583" title="Abdul Rahim al-Nashiri">
<text>Abdul Rahim Hussein Muhammed Abdu al-Nashiri (; ; born January 5, 1965) is a Saudi Arabian citizen alleged to be the mastermind of the bombing of USS &quot;Cole&quot; and other maritime attacks. He is alleged to have headed al-Qaeda operations in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf states prior to his capture in November 2002 by the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division.

Al-Nashiri was captured in Dubai in 2002 and held for four years in secret CIA prisons known as &quot;black sites&quot; in Afghanistan, Thailand, Poland, Morocco, Lithuania and Romania, before being transferred to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. While being interrogated, al-Nashiri was tortured by being waterboarded. In 2005 the CIA destroyed the tapes of Nashiri&#x27;s waterboarding. In another incident he was stripped naked, hooded and threatened with a gun and a power drill to scare him into talking.
Al-Nashiri was granted victim status in 2010 by the Polish government and a Polish prosecutor began &quot;investigating the possible abuse of power by Polish public officials with regard to a CIA black site&quot; in the country in 2008.

In December 2008, al-Nashiri was charged by the United States before a Guantanamo Military Commission. The charges were dropped in February 2009 and reinstated in 2011. As of 2011, al-Nashiri is on trial before a military tribunal in Guantanamo on charges of war crimes that carry the death penalty. As it is extremely unlikely he would be freed if found not guilty, his lawyers have called the proceeding a show trial.

In April 2019, a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated all orders issued by Air Force Colonel Vance Spath, the presiding military judge over al-Nashiri&#x27;s case from November 2015, on the grounds that Spath had failed to properly disclose his ongoing employment negotiations with the Department of Justice to al-Nashiri.

==Background==
Born in Saudi Arabia, al-Nashiri travelled to Afghanistan in the early 1990s to participate in attacks against the Russians in the region, at a time when the United States supported the mujahideen in such actions. In 1996, he travelled to Tajikistan and then Jalalabad, Afghanistan, where he first met Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden attempted to convince al-Nashiri to join al-Qaeda at this point, but he refused because he found the idea of swearing a loyalty oath to bin Laden to be distasteful. After al-Nashiri travelled to Yemen, he is alleged to have begun to consider committing terrorist actions against United States interests.

When he returned to Afghanistan in 1997, he again met bin Laden, but again declined to join in the terrorist group. Instead, he fought with the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance. Still, he assisted in the smuggling of four anti-tank missiles into Saudi Arabia, and helped arrange for a terrorist to get a Yemeni passport. His cousin, Jihad Mohammad Ali al-Makki, was one of the suicide bombers in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya.

==Allegedly joined al-Qaeda==

Finally, probably in 1998, al-Nashiri is alleged to have joined al-Qaeda, reporting directly to bin Laden. In late 1998, he conceived of a plot to attack a U.S. vessel using a boat full of explosives. Bin Laden personally approved of the plan, and provided money for it. First, al-Nashiri allegedly attempted to attack as a part of the 2000 millennium attack plots, but the boat he used was overloaded with explosives and began to sink.

The next attempt was the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing, which was successful. Seventeen U.S. sailors were killed, and many more were injured. This terrorist attack made al-Nashiri prominent within al-Qaeda, and he allegedly was made the chief of operations for the Arabian Peninsula. He organized the &quot;Limburg&quot; tanker bombing in 2002 of a French-flagged vessel off Yemen, and he may have planned other attacks as well.

==Arrest==

In November 2002, al-Nashiri was captured in the United Arab Emirates. He is in American military custody in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, having previously been held at some secret locations. On September 29, 2004, he was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; in a Yemeni court for his role in the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing.

Before being transported to military custody at Guantanamo, al-Nashiri was held by the CIA at black sites in Thailand and Poland for an undisclosed amount of time. CIA officials disagreed on al-Nashiri&#x27;s role in planning the &quot;Cole&quot; bombing. One CIA official said of al-Nashiri, &quot;He was an idiot. He couldn&#x27;t read or comprehend a comic book.&quot;

==Combatant Status Review==
The Department of Defense announced on August 9, 2007, that all fourteen of the &quot;high-value detainees&quot; who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA&#x27;s black sites, had been officially classified as &quot;enemy combatants&quot;. Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only &quot;&quot;illegal&quot; enemy combatants&quot; could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all fourteen men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions.

==Interrogation==
Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri was interrogated numerous times. At a 2007 hearing in a military court, he attributed his confessions of involvement in the &quot;USS Cole&quot; bombing to torture, including waterboarding. The details of torture that Nashiri offered at the hearing were redacted from the transcript.

Through Freedom of Information Act requests, the American Civil Liberties Union was able to acquire less redacted versions of the transcripts from Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri&#x27;s Combatant Status Review Tribunal, and those of three other captives.

In his opening statement, al-Nashiri listed seven false confessions he had been coerced to make while being waterboarded.
#The French Merchant Vessel Limburg incident.
#The USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing.
#The rockets in Saudi Arabia.
#The plan to bomb American ships in the Gulf.
#Relationship with people committing bombings in Saudi Arabia.
#Osama Bin Laden having a nuclear bomb.
#A plan to hijack a plane and crash it into a ship.

Al-Nashiri was tortured under the supervision of (then) current Director of the CIA Gina Haspel. A Navy Reserve doctor who interviewed him described him as &quot;one of the most severely traumatized individuals I have ever seen&quot;. In August 2018, cables from the secret detention site overseen by Haspel, dating from November 2002 and likely authorized by if not written by her, were released because of a Freedom of Information lawsuit, and they describe the torture of Nashiri in detail, including slamming him against a wall, confining him to a small box, waterboarding him, and depriving him of sleep and clothing, as well as threatening to turn him over to others who would kill him and calling him “a little girl,” “a spoiled little rich Saudi,” and a “sissy.”

During the course of his tribunal, he claimed to have made additional confessions under the duress of torture. He was ostensibly the last of the al-Qaeda suspects to be videotaped, as he was waterboarded in Thailand by CIA officers who questioned him. Shortly after, when a prisoner died in CIA custody in Iraq, the government agents decided against videotaping such interrogations, as this provided criminal &quot;evidence&quot; if things went wrong. All the CIA tapes showing detainees being waterboarded were destroyed in 2005.

It was reported on August 22, 2009, that al-Nashiri was the subject of what is described as a mock execution during his torture by the CIA. A power drill and a handgun were used.

In May 2011, al-Nashiri&#x27;s lawyers filed a case against Poland with the European Court of Human Rights. They said that Al-Nashiri was held and allegedly tortured in a secret CIA &quot;black site&quot; prison &quot;north of Warsaw&quot; (OSAW) from December 2002 to June 2003 with the collaboration or consent of the Polish government.

===Order overruled===
On January 29, 2009, an order from US president Obama&#x27;s administration to suspend all Guantanamo military commission hearings for 120 days was overruled by military judge Army Colonel James Pohl in al-Nashiri&#x27;s case.

===Charges dropped===

On February 5, 2009, al-Nashiri&#x27;s charges were withdrawn without prejudice.

===Charges re-instated===
Since 2011, al-Nashiri has been at trial.

===Death penalty===

The prosecution planned to request the death penalty for al-Nashiri.
The decision lies with the Convening authority, retired Admiral Bruce MacDonald.
In April 2011, the Department of Defense allowed Richard Kammen, a civilian lawyer with a background in defending suspects against death penalty cases, to join al-Nashiri&#x27;s defense team.

Al-Nashiri became the first Guantanamo captive to face the death penalty.

===Request to end the prosecution===

In a letter in July 2011, al-Nashiri&#x27;s legal team said:

and

===Questioning whether Al Nashiri will continue to be detained if he is acquitted===

On October 24, 2011, Lieutenant Commander Stephen Reyes filed a legal motion requesting that jurors in his case be informed that he may be detained in Guantanamo, even if he was acquitted of all charges.
Al-Nashiri&#x27;s formal charges are scheduled to be announced at the Tribunal on November 9, 2011.

Legal scholar Robert M. Chesney, of &quot;Lawfare&quot;, speculated al-Nashiri would be detained, if acquitted, for at least several more years.
Chesney argued that it would be just to continue to detain al-Nashiri, even if he were acquitted, because conviction requires a higher standard of evidence than a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition.

===Defense motions filed in April 2012===

Presiding Officer James L. Pohl considered several motions during a pre-trial hearing on April 11, 2012.
He deferred rulings on many of them.
He did rule to unshackle al-Nashiri for meetings with his lawyers, who had argued that he was traumatized by being shackled for years in secret CIA prisons and that being shackled during meetings impairs his ability to work with his lawyers.

===Jose Rodriguez&#x27;s dispute over al Nashiri&#x27;s role===

On May 8, 2012, Ali Soufan, al-Nashiri&#x27;s original FBI interrogator, asked whether a recently published book by former CIA official Jose Rodriguez would undermine al-Nashiri&#x27;s prosecution.
Soufan&#x27;s original FBI interrogation used the time-tested, legal technique of rapport-building. He has argued that the information derived from the suspect using this technique was reliable, whereas the confessions derived through torture were not.

Rodriguez was in over-all charge of the CIA&#x27;s extended interrogation program.
According to Soufan, Rodriquez&#x27;s account of al Nashiri&#x27;s role in the Cole bombing differed markedly from that of the prosecution. Rodriguez disputed that Al Nashiri had been the bombing&#x27;s &quot;mastermind&quot;, and agreed with a colleague who characterized him as &quot;the dumbest terrorist I have ever met&quot;.

==Mental health examination==

Presiding Officer James Pohl ruled on February 7, 2013, that an independent panel of mental health experts should examine Al Nashiri, and report on how the documented torture he was subjected to would affect his ability to assist in his own defense. Pohl called for the director of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to nominate the members of examination team. He called for the team to report back by April 1, 2013. The team is supposed to be given full access to al Nashiri&#x27;s medical files, including the top secret records from his times in CIA custody. The assessment was requested by the prosecution.

Al Nashiri&#x27;s defense team objected to the assessment, based on their doubts that a team appointed by the Office of Military Commissions could be relied upon. They called for the team to rely on the advice of Vincent Iacopino for how to interview Al Nashiri, without causing additional damage. Iacopino, a renowned expert on torture, had testified before the Military Commission on February 5, 2013, about the possible effects of torture on Al Nashiri.

According to Richard Kammen, Nashiri&#x27;s chief lawyer, psychiatric expert Sondra Crosby believes Nashiri is &quot;one of the most damaged victims of torture&quot; she has ever examined.

==Military Commission==
In 2011, Vice Admiral Bruce E. MacDonald convened a Guantanamo military commission under the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to try al-Nashiri for the bombing of the USS Cole and the M/V Limburg and the attempted bombing of the USS The Sullivans (DDG-68). Al-Nashiri then sued Vice Admiral MacDonald in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington to block the commission and in May 2012, U.S. District Judge Robert Jensen Bryan rejected al-Nashiri&#x27;s claim. That judgment was affirmed by United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Judges M. Margaret McKeown, Arthur Alarcón, and Sandra Segal Ikuta in December 2013.

On February 18, 2014, al-Nashiri attempted to fire his counsel, Rick Kammen. Judge Pohl granted a recess until February 19, 2014, to allow Kammen to attempt to repair the relationship with his client. If the two are unable to overcome their differences, al-Nashiri would be permitted to fire Kammen under current military commission rules.

In August 2014, al-Nashiri&#x27;s military trial judge dismissed the charges relating to the M/V Limburg bombing. The Government appealed to the United States Court of Military Commission Review and al-Nashiri then petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for a writ of mandamus disqualifying the military judges. In June 2015, Circuit Judge Karen L. Henderson, joined by Judges Judith W. Rogers and Nina Pillard denied al-Nashiri&#x27;s petition.

Al-Nashiri then sued President Barack Obama in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking an injunction preventing proceedings in his military commission trial until his writ of habeas corpus had been resolved. In December 2014, U.S. District Judge Richard W. Roberts held the case in abeyance pending resolution of al-Nashiri&#x27;s military commission trial and so denied as moot al-Nashiri&#x27;s lawsuit against the President. Judge Roberts reasoned that the abstention doctrine announced in &quot;Schlesinger v. Councilman&quot; (1975), which required judicial review of an ongoing court-martial to wait until it is completed, also applied to al-Nashiri&#x27;s military commission. In August 2016, D.C. Circuit Judge Thomas B. Griffith, joined by Judge David B. Sentelle, affirmed that judgment, over the dissent of Judge David S. Tatel.

On October 18, 2016, the new military judge, Air Force Colonel Vance Spath took a step that Stephen Vladeck, a law professor and national security expert described as &quot;unprecedented&quot;. Spath had United States Marshals take Stephen Gill, into custody, to compel him to testify at a pre-trial hearing. In 2018, Spath resigned and was retroactively disqualified by the D.C. Circuit in a case arising out of the Baker v. Spath controversy. 

In 2021, Army Colonel Lanny Acosta overruled an objection by al-Nashiri&#x27;s military lawyer, Brian L. Mizer, to the Chief Prosecutor, Mark S. Martins introduction of statements taken from al-Nashiri under torture in the CIA black sites as evidence. The matter became public after Mizer and Al-Nashiri&#x27;s civilian lawyer, Michel Paradis, appealed Acosta&#x27;s decision. This led to a public dispute between Martins and the Joe Biden administration over the use of evidence obtained by torture, prompting Martins to abruptly resign. The Biden Administration then reversed its position and the court of appeals reversed Acosta&#x27;s decision.

== Baker v. Spath ==
In 2017, the Chief Defense Counsel Brig. Gen. John Baker authorized the mass resignation of al-Nashiri&#x27;s defense team after al-Nashiri&#x27;s lead lawyer, Richard Kammen, discovered secret monitoring equipment installed in his attorney-client meeting room. The military judge presiding over the al-Nashiri case, Colonel Vance Spath, ordered Baker to rescind his order returning the lawyers to the case. When Baker refused the order as illegal, Spath found Baker in contempt and ordered him put under house arrest in Guantanamo.

Baker filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. While the case was pending, the Convening Authority for Military Commissions reduced Baker’s sentence and ordered him released from confinement. Soon after, United States District Judge Royce Lamberth granted Baker’s habeas corpus petition and vacated Spath’s finding of contempt.

In October 2018, al-Nashiri petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for a writ of mandamus and prohibition, seeking a vacatur of all military commission orders issued by Colonel Spath. Al-Nashiri&#x27;s lawyer Michel Paradis, argued that Spath had failed to disclose his job application to the Department of Justice and the subsequent employment negotiations concerning an open position for an immigration judge in the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which created an appearance of bias, disqualifying Spath from presiding over al-Nashiri&#x27;s military commission. Spath had retired on November 1, 2018, and was appointed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions as an immigration judge in October 2018. After oral arguments were held before a panel consisting of Judge Rogers, Tatel, and Griffith, the Court vacated all orders issued by Spath, concluding that &quot;Spath’s job application to the Justice Department created a disqualifying appearance of partiality&quot;. In writing for a unanimous court, Tatel wrote:

==European Court of Human Rights judgment==
On July 24, 2014, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that Poland violated the European Convention on Human Rights when it cooperated with the U.S. by allowing the CIA to hold and torture al-Nashiri and Abu Zubaydah on its territory in 2002–2003. The court ordered the Polish government to pay each of the men 100,000 euros in damages. Additionally, the ECHR ordered the Polish government to disclose details of the men&#x27;s detention and to seek diplomatic assurances from the United States that al-Nashiri will not be executed.
On the May 31, 2018, in the Case of Al Nashiri v. Romania (Application no. 33234/12) the Court held Romania was complicit in CIA rendition and had suffered various ECHR violations. It stated the following in its rulings;

FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,
*1. Holds that the matters complained of are within the “jurisdiction” of Romania within the meaning of Article 1 of the convention and that the responsibility of Romania is engaged under the convention, and dismisses the Government&#x27;s preliminary objection concerning a lack of jurisdiction and responsibility;
*2. Decides to join to the merits the Government&#x27;s preliminary objections of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and non-compliance with the six-month rule and dismisses them;
*3. Declares the complaints under Articles 2, 3, 5, 6 § 1, 8 and 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 6 to the Convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;
*4. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in its procedural aspect on account of the respondent State&#x27;s failure to carry out an effective investigation into the applicant&#x27;s allegations of serious violations of the convention, including inhuman treatment and undisclosed detention;
*5. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in its substantive aspect, on account of the respondent State&#x27;s complicity in the CIA High-Value Detainee Programme in that it enabled the US authorities to subject the applicant to inhuman treatment on its territory and to transfer him from its territory in spite of a real risk that he would be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3;
*6. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 of the convention on account of the applicant&#x27;s undisclosed detention on the respondent State&#x27;s territory and the fact that the respondent State enabled the US authorities to transfer him from its territory, in spite of a real risk that he would be subjected to further undisclosed detention;
*7. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the convention;
*8. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the convention on account of the lack of effective remedies in respect of the applicant&#x27;s grievances under Articles 3, 5 and 8 of the convention;
*9. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the convention on account of the transfer of the applicant from the respondent State&#x27;s territory in spite of a real risk that he could face a flagrant denial of justice;
*10. Holds that there has been a violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention taken together with Article 1 of Protocol No. 6 to the convention on account of the transfer of the applicant from the respondent State&#x27;s territory in spite of a real risk that he could be subjected to the death penalty;
*11. Holds
(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the convention, EUR 100,000 (one hundred thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable in respect of non-pecuniary damage;
(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;
*12. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant&#x27;s claim for just satisfaction.

The court therefore found that Mr Al Nashiri had been within Romania&#x27;s jurisdiction and that the country had been responsible for the violation of his rights under the convention. It also recommended that Romania conclude a full investigation into Mr Al Nashiri&#x27;s case as quickly as possible and, if necessary, punish any officials responsible. The country should also seek assurances from the United States that Mr Al Nashiri will not suffer the death penalty.

On May 31, 2018, the ECHR ruled that Romania and Lithuania also violated the rights of Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri in 2003-2005 and in 2005-2006 respectively, and Lithuania and Romania were ordered to pay 100,000 euros in damages each to Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Nashiri.

<doc id="1027588" wikidata="Q930096" url="?curid=1027588" title="Siding Spring Observatory">
<text>Siding Spring Observatory near Coonabarabran, New South Wales, Australia, part of the Research School of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (RSAA) at the Australian National University (ANU), incorporates the Anglo-Australian Telescope along with a collection of other telescopes owned by the Australian National University, the University of New South Wales, and other institutions. The observatory is situated above sea level in the Warrumbungle National Park on Mount Woorat, also known as Siding Spring Mountain. Siding Spring Observatory is owned by the Australian National University (ANU) and is part of the Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories research school.

More than 100 million worth of research equipment is located at the observatory. There are over 60 telescopes on site, though not all are operational.

==History==

The original Mount Stromlo Observatory was set up by the Commonwealth Government in 1924. After duty supplying optical components to the military in World War II, the emphasis on astronomical research changed in the late 1940s from solar to stellar research. Between 1953 and 1974, the reflecting telescope at Mount Stromlo was the largest optical telescope in Australia.

Already in the 1950s, the artificial lights of Canberra, ACT, had brightened the sky at Mount Stromlo to such an extent that many faint astronomical objects had been overwhelmed by light pollution. The search for a new site was initiated by Bart Bok. After a site survey was undertaken the number of possible locations was narrowed down to two – Siding Spring and Mount Bingar near Griffith, also in New South Wales. Siding Spring was first suggested for astronomy by Harley Wood, the New South Wales Government Astronomer at the time. Arthur Hogg did much of the preliminary site testing.

The Siding Spring site was selected by the ANU in 1962 from many other possible locations because of the dark and cloud-free skies. By the mid-1960s the ANU had set up three telescopes, together with supporting facilities, such as sealed roads, staff accommodation, electricity and water. In 1984, the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, opened the ANU&#x27;s largest telescope, the low-cost and innovative aperture telescope, housed in a simple, co-rotating cuboid dome.

Since the 1950s, and quite independently of developments at Siding Spring, the Australian and British governments had been negotiating about the construction of a very large telescope. When these negotiations finally came to fruition in 1969, the infrastructure of Siding Spring Observatory was already in place, and it was the obvious site at which to locate the aperture Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT).

During the construction of the AAT in the early 1970s, the British Science Research Council also built the UK Schmidt Telescope, to the northeast of the AAT dome. The considerably wider field of view of the Schmidt optical design complements the narrower field of the AAT, in that larger areas of sky may be surveyed more quickly. Interesting objects so discovered are then studied in greater detail on the larger instrument. In 1987, the Schmidt Telescope was amalgamated with the AAT.

Siding Spring Observatory also houses many telescopes from institutions across the world including, Korea, America, the UK, Poland, Hungary, Germany and Russia. In 1990, the earth-satellite tracking facility of the Royal Greenwich Observatory was closed down after 10 years of operation.

In 2012 the first publicly accessible Internet based observatory, working in partnership with the RSAA, was commissioned by with over 25 telescopes housed in a large roll-off roof (ROR) observatory near the base of the UK Schmidt Telescope.

Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network operate a 2-metre Ritchey Chretien telescope used for research, citizen science, and education purposes by users across the globe. Also, they operate inside the clam style dome 2 x 0.40 m telescopes, and a further 2 × 1 metre telescopes housed in individual domes outside the building. Currently there are over one thousand registered users of the Faulkes Telescope Project, who vary from schools and community groups to professional astronomers. A global network of robotic optical telescopes will not only provide continuous sky coverage and the ability to treat the network as a single instrument, but also provide the resources for performing cutting-edge science in collaboration with other organisations.

ROTSE, Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment is operated by the University of New South Wales (UNSW), the 0.45 m, 3rd-generation robotic telescope has successfully detected the transient optical emission from several GRB events. The wide field of view and the fast response permit measurements inaccessible to more conventional instruments.

HAT-South is a project to search for transiting extrasolar planets in the Southern Hemisphere. It uses a network of wide-field telescopes to monitor hundreds of thousands of bright stars, searching for the characteristic dip in light that occurs when a planet passes in front of its host star. Hat – South is made up of 3 sites in the Southern hemisphere with two &quot;TH4&quot; units, making that 8 x 0.2-metre telescopes each at every sites. These TH4 units consist of four 0.18 m Takahashi astrographs fitted with Apogee 4k x 4k CCDs. Each TH4 unit monitors 64 square degrees of sky at a time, so each site is capable of monitoring 128 square degrees of sky.

Automated Patrol Telescope (APT), operated by the University of New South Wales (UNSW), is a wide-field CCD imaging telescope. The 0.5 m telescope has a 5-degree field of view and can be operated remotely or in a fully automatic mode. The telescope has an optical design that more resembles that of a Schmidt camera, but has a 3-element lens to achieve a wide, corrected field of view. The APT was developed by extensively modifying the optical, mechanical and electronic systems of a Baker-Nunn satellite tracking instrument. The Baker-Nunn telescope had been located at Woomera in South Australia during the 1960s, and afterward was stationed at Orroral Valley near Canberra. The camera was donated by the Smithsonian Institution to UNSW in 1982.

PROMPT (also known as Skynet) is run by the University of North Carolina. The Panchromatic Robotic Optical Monitoring and Polarimetry Telescopes is made up of 4 x 0.41 Ritchey Chretien telescopes is entirely robotic and queue based. They are able to have rapid and simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of gamma ray burst afterglows and other transient objects.

Uppsala Schmidt Telescope was built in 1957 originally located in Sweden, relocated to Mount Stromlo, then finally in 1982 making a home at Siding Spring Observatory. The telescope was used by ANU in many roles such as Near Earth Object studies (NEOs) by famous comet hunter Rob McNaught. It was also the southern hemisphere counterpart of the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) located in Arizona, USA. The telescope is a 0.5m spherical mirror, with a 0.5m correcting plate, which allows a 6 degree field of view.

The KMT, Korean Microlensing Telescope, is a 1.6 m operated by KASI. The KMTNet aims primarily to discover extrasolar planets based on the analyses of gravitational microlensing phenomena, especially the detection of earth-mass planets in the habitable zone. The KMTNet system has a very competitive power for wide-field photometric survey sciences that study supernovae, asteroids and external galaxies, for instance. Because the observation period of the Galactic bulge focuses on the primary science on extrasolar planets, the other science programs are performed in the season when the Galactic bulge is not observable.

The SkyMapper telescope, operated by the Australian National University, is currently mapping the entire southern sky, completing each map over a period of 3 months. The survey will record more than a billion stars and galaxies. This fully automated telescope also uses a series of filters enabling the camera to record the spectral type of stars, giving astronomers information about their age, mass and temperature. The 1.35m telescope has been used in the hunt for Planet Nine and more trans-Neptunian objects, supernovae, and also finding the oldest known star in the universe.

Solaris 3, operated by the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences as part of a network across the Southern hemisphere, is a single 0.5-metre telescope, using a new method referred to as eclipse timing to search for exoplanets. They have also added an astrograph to their telescope, giving it dual purpose.

JAXA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, operate four 0.25-metre telescopes, searching and tracking space debris and near-Earth objects in the Southern hemisphere.

Huntsman Telephoto Array is operated by the Australian Astronomical Observatory &amp; Macquarie University to take images of faint galaxy structures using commercial lenses. Initially it will use a 0.28-metre Celestron Rowe-Ackermann Schmidt Astrograph (RASA) telescope with seven 400 mm Canon f/2.8 camera lenses.

bRing-AU, operated by a collaboration of Universities and astronomers will search for circumplanetary material, studying disks of dust in early history and the formation of icy satellites. They use 2 small modified cameras, with Kodak CCD chips.

===2013 Bushfire===
On 13 January 2013 the facility was threatened by a huge bushfire and firestorm. Eighteen staff were evacuated to Coonabarabran. Three buildings were destroyed: &#x27;The Lodge&#x27; accommodation used by visiting researchers, the Director&#x27;s Cottage and the Fire Station. Bushfire prevention measures had been implemented and were credited with the protection of the telescopes. Though smoke, ash and other air-borne debris entered some domes, all telescopes survived the inferno. The first telescopes back in action were those of the iTelescope Remote Observatory on 20 January. The Anglo-Australian Telescope resumed normal operations in mid-February 2013.

==Visitors==
There is a visitors&#x27; gallery and exhibition area open to the public which also incorporates a café and souvenir shop. During NSW school holidays, guided tours of the site are offered. Groups of over 15 adults may apply for behind the scenes walking or bus tours.

An Open Day is held annually in October, offering talks about astronomy and tours inside many of the telescope domes which are open to the public on this one day of the year. These tours include the AAT 3.9M, UK Schmidt, , 2.3M ANU and the LCGTN 2M telescope facilities.

The Anglo-Australian Near-Earth Asteroid Survey used the UK Schmidt Telescope between 1990 and 1996. The same telescope was later dedicated for use by the RAVE survey of the Milky Way. The Near-Earth object search program called the Siding Spring Survey (closed 2013) used the Uppsala Southern Schmidt Telescope. The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, one of the largest survey of galaxies ever undertaken used the Anglo-Australian Telescope between 1995 and 2002.

==Discoveries==
1977, the Vela Pulsar was discovered at Siding Spring. Comets discovered from the observatory include Comet 103P/Hartley, discovered in 1986 by Malcolm Hartley, Comet C/2006 P1, discovered by Robert H. McNaught using the Uppsala Southern Schmidt Telescope on 8 August 2006, and
Comet C/2013 A1, also discovered by McNaught, which passed extremely close to Mars on 19 October 2014.

<text>Them or Us is an album by American musician Frank Zappa, released in October 1984 by Barking Pumpkin Records.
==Album content==
Its opening and closing songs were not written by Zappa: &quot;The Closer You Are&quot;, was written by Earl Lewis and Morgan Robinson and originally released by the Channels; and &quot;Whippin&#x27; Post&quot;, originally performed by the Allman Brothers Band.

&quot;Ya Hozna&quot; includes backmask vocals taken from &quot;Sofa No. 2&quot; (from &quot;One Size Fits All&quot;, 1975), &quot;Lonely Little Girl&quot; (from &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, 1968) and unreleased outtakes of &quot;Valley Girl&quot; (vocals by Moon Zappa). &quot;Planet of My Dreams&quot; (featuring Bob Harris on vocals) is a 1981 studio recording taken from the score of Zappa&#x27;s unrealized 1972 stage musical &quot;Hunchentoot&quot; (other titles from this show appear on the first-CD edition of the &quot;Sleep Dirt&quot; reissue from 1991). &quot;Be in My Video&quot;, described as the best song on the album, pokes fun at the cliches in music videos, particularly David Bowie&#x27;s 1983 hit single &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;.

As with other Zappa rock albums of this era, many of the tracks are sourced from live recordings. Later studio overdubs were liberally applied, although there is no mention of this on the album notes.

==Release==
Following problems with the album &quot;Thing-Fish&quot;, which MCA Records refused to distribute, Zappa made a deal with EMI Records, which would allow &quot;Them or Us&quot; and &quot;Thing-Fish&quot; to be distributed by Capitol Records in the United States. Zappa wrote a &quot;warning&quot; which appeared on the inner sleeves of these albums, as well as &quot;Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention&quot; (1985), which stated that the albums contained content &quot;which a truly free society would neither fear nor suppress&quot;, and a &quot;guarantee&quot; which stated that the lyrics would not &quot;cause eternal torment in the place where the guy with the horns and pointed stick conducts his business.&quot;

<text>The 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the seventh edition of the Gold Cup, the soccer championship of North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF).

For the first time since 1993, the tournament was held in more than one country, with games played in both United States and Mexico. The games were played in Mexico City, Miami, and for the first time in a northern U.S. city, Foxborough. The format of the tournament stayed the same as in 2002: twelve teams were split into four groups of three, the top two teams in each group would advance to the quarter-finals. Colombia and Brazil were invited, with the latter sending an Under-23 team.

The United States&#x27; Landon Donovan put four past Cuba in the quarterfinals in a 5–0 win, but the defending champions went out to Brazil in the semi-finals. The South Americans scored a goal in the 89th minute and added a penalty in extra time to win 2–1. Mexico won their first championship since 1998, beating Brazil 1–0 in extra time.

<doc id="1027608" wikidata="Q285052" url="?curid=1027608" title="Ejabberd">
<text>ejabberd is an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) application server and an MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) broker, written mainly in the Erlang programming language. It can run under several Unix-like operating systems such as macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and OpenSolaris. Additionally, ejabberd can run under Microsoft Windows. The name ejabberd stands for Erlang Jabber Daemon (Jabber being a former name for XMPP) and is written in lowercase only, as is common for daemon software.

ejabberd is free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later. , it is one of the most popular open source applications written in Erlang. XMPP: The Definitive Guide (O&#x27;Reilly Media, 2009) praised ejabberd for its scalability and clustering feature, at the same time pointing out that being written in Erlang is a potential acceptance issue for users and contributors. The software&#x27;s creator, Alexey Shchepin was awarded the Erlang User of the Year award at the 2006 Erlang user conference.

ejabberd has a number of notable deployments, IETF Groupchat Service, BBC Radio LiveText, Nokia&#x27;s Ovi, KDE Talk and one in development at Facebook. ejabberd is the most popular server among smaller XMPP-powered sites that register on xmpp.org.

With the next major release after version 2 (previously called ejabberd 3), the versioning scheme was changed to reflect release dates as &quot;Year.Month-Revision&quot; (starting with 13.04-beta1). It was also announced that further development will be split into an &quot;ejabberd Community Server&quot; and an &quot;ejabberd Commercial Edition [which] targets carriers, websites, service providers, large corporations, universities, game companies, that need high level of commitment from ProcessOne, stability and performance and a unique set of features to run their business successfully.&quot;

== Project history ==
Alexey Shchepin started ejabberd in November 2002 for three main reasons: success with Tkabber (his previous project, an XMPP client), a rather unstable first alpha release of jabberd2, and his wish to play with Erlang features. Shchepin has stated that he would have not started ejabberd without Erlang. Ejabberd hit version 1.0 in December 2005.

== Features ==
ejabberd has a high level of compliance with XMPP. It provides a web interface which can be translated into other languages. ejabberd supports distributed computing by clustering, supports live upgrades, shared roster groups and provides support for virtual hosts. Database management systems supported include PostgreSQL and MySQL, and ODBC is supported for connectivity to other systems. LDAP authentication is supported, as is login via SSL/TLS, SASL and STARTTLS.

ejabberd is extensible via modules, which can provide support for additional capabilities such as saving offline messages, connecting with IRC channels, or a user database which makes use of user&#x27;s vCards (saving vCards in LDAP or an ODBC compatible database is possible with other modules). In addition, modules can provide support for extensions of the XMPP protocol, such as MUC, HTTP polling, Publish-Subscribe, and gathering statistics via XMPP.

Starting with version 2.0.0 ejabberd also includes support for the &quot;Proxy65&quot; file transfer proxy which enabled Jabber/XMPP users behind firewalls to share files through a SOCKS 5 proxy.

ejabberd can communicate with other XMPP servers and with non-XMPP instant messaging networks as well, using a special type of XMPP component called transport or gateway.

== Distribution methods ==
In addition to the source code package and binary installers for Linux, macOS, and Windows, ejabberd is also available in several operating system distributions as is typical in FOSS, including Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, OpenSolaris, FreeBSD Ports, OpenBSD ports, NetBSD port and Mac OS X&#x27;s Fink.

Other methods in which ejabberd is available are the TurnKey Linux Virtual Appliance Library and Comprehensive Erlang Archive Network (CEAN). An old version of ejabberd is included in the Unison unified communications software.

== Notable deployments ==
ejabberd is known to be used by XMPP-related sites and a number of companies, either for providing an XMPP instant messaging service, as a meeting chat room service, or as middleware for other software (usually by means of the Publish-Subscribe service).

XMPP servers deployed for XMPP-related sites are usually run using ejabberd, both in case of large and small servers. One large public XMPP servers runs ejabberd: the Russian jabber.ru, that handles between 10,000 and 20,000 concurrent users at any time. Among smaller XMPP-related sites, ejabberd is also the most popular server. When not taking into account the size or nature of the server, ejabberd is also the most widely deployed: according to IMtrends report from July 2008 based in automated server detection, 37% of 7292 servers were running ejabberd; the second position being jabberd14 with 22.4% and the third Openfire with 18.4%.

Among generic instant messaging deployments are ISPs like the Portuguese SAPO, and the German United Internet for services like GMX and Web.de. The Russian search engine Yandex uses a highly modified version of ejabberd, named Yabberd. Nokia&#x27;s Ovi uses ejabberd with some customizations. Major League Baseball offers instant messaging and chatrooms using a customized ejabberd. Mxit was a large server for mobile instant messaging client that started using ejabberd in 2005, but was replaced with a custom IM engine. Universities known to use ejabberd include: Saint Petersburg State University, Taganrog State University and the Division of Information Technology of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

In the FOSS world, there is a pair of notable generic deployments of ejabberd, namely the KDE Talk and the Fellowship of the Free Software Foundation Europe.

ejabberd chatroom feature provides the IETF Groupchat Service, used by the various working groups, areas, and BOF sessions during meetings and at other times.

Other deployments use ejabberd in more novel ways. For instance, BBC Radio LiveText uses ejabberd&#x27;s Publish-Subscribe service to synchronously broadcast text content with the radio stream. sameplace.cc is a Mozilla Firefox extension that integrates Jabber/XMPP in the web browser, and uses ejabberd for the XMPP server. Other deployments include Chesspark (online chess playing site), Collecta (real-time search), and Notifixious (notifications of website subscriptions).

One Laptop per Child&#x27;s School server uses ejabberd with OLPC-specific patches as the instant messaging server.

In 2008 Facebook announced that they will support XMPP for their chat service. Facebook developers made a presentation on the topic at Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) 2009 conference, and in November 2009 chat.facebook.com was detected as running a modified version of ejabberd. Om Malik commented on the development as &quot;disruptive&quot; competition for &quot;older IM networks such as AOL&#x27;s AIM and Microsoft&#x27;s MSN&quot;. On Feb 10th 2010, the Facebook blog announced the opening of the XMPP interface to Facebook chat, based on ejabberd.

Another social media and blogging service that uses ejabberd is LiveJournal Talk. The Spanish-focused Tuenti social network uses a modified ejabberd to provide a live chat service.

The worldwide jabber.org XMPP server, with a userbase of 330,000 users and 15,000 users online at any one time in December 2009, have used ejabberd since February 2006 until January 2010. (In 2010 Jabber.org migrated to M-Link XMPP server from Isode Limited.)

Nintendo Switch uses ejabberd in its &quot;Nintendo Switch Push Notification infrastructure&quot; (NPNS) handling 10 million simultaneous connections.

== Publications and reception ==
Two articles are published about ejabberd in magazines: &quot;Démarrer avec ejabberd&quot; in the French magazine PROgrammez! and &quot;Passing notes in class&quot;, a post in Free Software Magazine.

Computerworld Australia interviewed Erlang creator Joe Armstrong in June 2009, and he referred to ejabberd in this way:
* Q: &quot;What&#x27;s the most interesting program(s) you&#x27;ve seen written with Erlang for business?&quot;
* A: &quot;That&#x27;s difficult to answer, there are many good applications. Possibly Ejabberd which is an open-source Jabber/XMPP instant messaging server. Ejabberd appears to be the market leading XMPP server and things like Google Wave which runs on top of XMPP will probably attract a lot of people into building applications on XMPP servers.&quot;

Builder Australia interviewed Andre Pang in September 2007, and referred to ejabberd in those terms: &quot;the apps that Erlang is suited for really aren&#x27;t CPU bound that often, if you look at ejabberd, it serves some absolutely crazy amount of concurrent connections, well over 100,000, and they&#x27;re running it on, I&#x27;m not sure, but it&#x27;s something like a Quad core XEON machine.&quot;

ejabberd is mentioned in several books related to the XMPP protocol and the Erlang language. XMPP: The Definitive Guide (O&#x27;Reilly Media, 2009) refers to ejabberd in those terms: &quot;The server is well-known for its scalability, and it can be clustered across multiple instances&quot;. A 2006 internal review paper in the IT department of Cambridge University found it the best choice amongst Jabber servers. In the same year Alexey Shchepin was awarded the &quot;User of the Year&quot; award at the 12th International Erlang/OTP User Conference.

Other published books that mention ejabberd are:
* &quot;Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World&quot; (Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2008)
* &quot;Erlang Programming: A Concurrent Approach to Software Development&quot; (O&#x27;Reilly Media, 2009)
* &quot;Openfire Administration: A practical step-by-step guide to rolling out a secure Instant Messaging service over your network&quot; (Packt Publishing, 2008)
* &quot;Fedora 11 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Bible&quot; (Wiley, 2009)

ejabberd was used in research works of papers published in international conferences proceedings and journals:
* XMPP for cloud computing in bioinformatics supporting discovery and invocation of asynchronous web services
* Kestrel: an XMPP-based framework for many task computing applications
* IM&#x27;ing overload: Libraryh3lp to the rescue
* Towards an Enhanced Adaptability and Usability of Web-Based Collaborative Systems
* Leveraging Visual Tailoring and Synchronous Awareness in Web-Based Collaborative Systems
* Adding New Communication Services to the FIPA Message Transport System

There are four patent applications published in the United States Patent and Trademark Office that involve ejabberd:
* US 2007/0271367 A1: Systems and Methods for Location-Based Social Web Interaction and Instant Messaging System
* US 2008/0062969 A1: Instant Message Call Connect System Apparatus and Database
* US 2008/0062970 A1: Instant Message Call Connect System Method and Interface
* US 2008/0235189 A1: System for Searching for Information Based on Personal Interactions and Presences and Methods Thereof

<text>The Lincoln Mark LT is a luxury pickup truck manufactured and marketed by Ford&#x27;s Lincoln division for model years 2006–2008 (U.S. and Canada) and 2006–2014 (Mexico) as a badge engineered, luxury-trimmed variant of the Ford F-150 truck — and a successor to the 2002-only Lincoln Blackwood. 

The Mark LT was manufactured at Ford&#x27;s River Rouge Plant in Dearborn, Michigan, and at the Ford Cuautitlan plant in Cuautitlán, Mexico, on the same lines as the closely related Ford F-150, on which it was based. It used the same 330-cubic-inch, 5.4 L Triton V8 and has four doors. The Mark LT also had optional all-wheel drive.

Lincoln projected selling 13,000 Mark LT&#x27;s annually in the United States. The Mark LT was more successful than the Blackwood in its first year of sales with 10,274 sold in the first calendar year of sales (February 2005 through February 2006). The 2006 Mark LT outsold the Cadillac Escalade EXT, but the 2007 EXT gained on the Mark LT&#x27;s sales consistently. After disappointing sales, the Mark LT was cancelled in the United States and Canada after the first generation. A second generation was marketed in Mexico where it was often the Lincoln Division&#x27;s best selling model.


==First generation (2006–2008)==
For 2007, the Mark LT received a grille facelift, optional DVD-based navigation system and other luxury and cosmetic features. For 2008, the Mark LT received the addition of the color of Light French Silk clearcoat metallic and an optional rearview camera back-up system.
===Retirement===
Ford ended sales of the Lincoln Mark LT in the United States and Canada after the 2008 model year. In its place, Ford offered an upper-end trim of the 2009 F-150, marketed as Platinum.

==Second generation (2010–2014)==

Although the Mark LT met with poor sales and cancellation in the United States, Lincoln dealers in Mexico found the pickup to become the best-selling model for the division. As a result, Lincoln received an all-new Mark LT for the 2010 model year but only for the Mexican market. Based upon the twelfth generation F-150 introduced a year before, the Mark LT shared its trim with the F-150 Platinum. To differentiate it from the Navigator, the Mark LT was given a split grille in the style of the MKS and MKT.

The Mark LT was built in two versions along with the F-150: the short-bed &quot;Dearborn&quot; and the long bed &quot;Cuautitlán&quot;.

With the introduction of the 2015 thirteenth generation F-Series, no Mark LT version was built, making the 2014 model year the last for the Mark LT.

==Quality==
J.D. Power Quality listed the Mark LT as overall dependability for all 3 years it was manufactured as &quot;among the best&quot; (with a minimum 4 stars for the 2006 variant in initial quality).

<doc id="1027617" wikidata="Q1583780" url="?curid=1027617" title="La Samaritaine">
<text>La Samaritaine (French pronunciation: ) is a large department store in the first arrondissement of Paris; the nearest metro station is Pont-Neuf. Founded in 1870 by Ernest Cognacq it is now owned by the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.

The store was a member of the International Association of Department Stores from 1985 to 1992. 

== History ==

=== 1870–1930s: Early years and expansion ===
In 1870 Ernest Cognacq opened &quot;La Samaritaine&quot;, on the corner of Rue du Pont-Neuf and the Rue de la Monnaie. In 1872 Cognacq married Marie-Louise Jaÿ and they begun to manage the store together.

The interiors of magasin one (magasin means &quot;store&quot; in French) were redesigned in 1891, the project was overseen by architect Frantz Jourdain. He also designed magasin two which opened in 1910. Much of magasin two had been pre-fabricated allowing the construction to occur rapidly. Magasin one&#x27;s facade was also updated to match magasin two.

By the time the store&#x27;s remodel and expansion was finished in 1910 the style of the new buildings were outdated and when the decision was made to expand in the 1920s city officials allowed for the expansion only if specifications of the city were followed (these specifications centred around a more current architectural style). This was done with little opposition from Cognacq and Jourdain as both were aware that now magasin one and two were outdated in style.

Between 1926 and 1928, Jourdain and Henri Sauvage worked together designing the stores extension towards the river Seine. By the end of this partnership the &quot;Samaritaine&quot; was made up of four buildings and was eleven floors in height.

In 1930 and 1932 two expansions were completed designed by Jourdain.

=== 1970s–present: Decline, closure and reopening ===
From the 1970s the companies profits began to decline.

&quot;Samaritaine&quot; was a founding anchor store at Le Quarte Temps in 1981, however the store was closed two years later.

Since 1990 the buildings have been listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture.

A majority stake in La Samaritaine was purchased by LVMH in 2001. 

The store was closed on 15 June 2005, due to serious fire risk with the building needing urgent safety renovations. However labour unions believed it was because of a restructure of the store.

LVMH purchased remaining shares in the department store from the Cognacq-Jay foundation in late 2010, with this they had full ownership of the department store. The redevelopment was planned to begin in 2011.

In January 2015 work on the store was halted again after building permission was revoked by a French Court. Work started again how there was still opposition to the new facades designed by Japanese architecture firm SANAA, the mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo supported the plans.

After sixteen years of closure the department store was reopened to the public in June of 2021, now also co-branded as part of DFS. The store was reopened by French President Emmanuel Macron and CEO of LVMH, Bernard Arnault. The buildings now include a Cheval Blanc hotel, nursery, offices and social housing. 

As of 2024 the store is struggling to attract customers. 

== Building design and style ==

Jourdain&#x27;s membership in multiple societies heavily influenced his personal architectural theory and design choices for the Samaritaine. Jourdain was the president of the Societe du Nouveau during the height of the Art Nouveau movement. The building&#x27;s original design heavily embodies the ideals of this artistic style. While the skeletal structure of the department store is constructed of steel and glass, the building contains many applied adornments which lessen the harshness of its rigid structure. The building&#x27;s exterior has two domes made of glass brick that light up in the nighttime. The extended verticals of the domes, sectioned into eight sides, accentuate the height of the building and draw the viewer&#x27;s eye to the top of the store. The facade of the building consists of ceramic panels in brightly colored hues of yellow, white, green, and gold. The word &quot;Samaritaine&quot;, as well as some of the available merchandise and ware, are displayed around the facade of the building in colorful enamel using an elaborate lettering. Dispersed around these signs are colorful naturalistic flower motifs, which continue to the interior design of the building as well. The interior features decorative iron staircases, glass tile floors, and frescoes using the repeated floral motif. These elements encompass both ornament and functionality which are core principles of the Art Nouveau movement. The foundational ideas of Art Nouveau, and the Samaritaine, led the way to the modern movements of the 1920s.

== The department store as a type and consumerism ==

The main fundamental difference that distinguishes the department store from other stores is its offering of low-priced, mass-produced goods of a wide variety. Prices were able to be placed just slightly above wholesale as the volume of sales was able to compensate for the small margin. Typically, department stores are located centrally within a city and are in close proximity to transportation. Different department stores targeted people of different class distinctions. However, their main audience is the middle-class city dwellers who were highly conscious of their status. The Samaritaine, in particular, targeted the working class who constantly traveled through the first arrondissement for work. The goal of the department store is to move the consumer through the building and to its upper floors in order to maximize the number of counters an individual has to pass. This posed as a bit of a challenge as their target audience was so used to shopping along the street level at various small boutiques. Architects had to entice these shoppers by utilizing grand and decorative elements to allure consumers to explore the building.

=== Features ===
The department store is constantly changing to keep up with the architectural trends, yet remains somewhat constant in its appearance as a building type. The design and decor of the building played a major role in enticing the human desire for the consumption of material goods. The common use of iron allowed for minimal skeletal structure and therefore maximized the amount of light that could flow through the interior and allowed more room for the circulation of customers. Many of the structural elements utilized reference to the international exhibition halls built a few years before the original department stores. Another common feature is the monumental stair design, a design element of the first department store, Bon Marche. It was later installed in the Samaritaine as well as other department stores constructed at the turn of the century. The Samaritaine also had the common department store design feature: the light court. The skeletal steel structure allowed for a maximum square footage of glass windows which was intentionally located at the center of the building to bring in ample natural light. The glazed corner rotunda became another crucial element of Parisian department store architecture. It served as a large space for display cases that could be seen by many pedestrians waiting on the street corner. The corner rotunda was also utilized as the entrance of the building, leaving the consumer with two options of vastly-stretching display windows upon entering the building. Finally, the use of a dome structure, and their strategic placement, was useful in identifying the department store as a type. The two domes of the Samaritaine create a sight line between the Seine and the left bank.

=== Consumerism ===
The organization of each individual department within the stores is based on consumption patterns. For example, impulse items, such as jewelry and cosmetics, were placed on the street floor. This would encourage consumers to make quick impulse buys upon entering or right before leaving the store. Also, demand items, such as children&#x27;s clothing or household goods, were located on the upper levels. This would force consumers to move past all of the lower level departments before they reached their desired location, maximizing the opportunity for the individual to make an unplanned purchase. Once the Samaritaine consisted of four Magasins, the first was dedicated as a department store solely for women&#x27;s clothing while the other three were for items such as supplies and tools.

<text>Andrei Grigoriyevich Shkuro (; ; – 17 January 1947) was a Russian military officer of Cossack origin. He was a lieutenant general (1919) of the White Army, and later a Nazi collaborator.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born in the &quot;stanitsa&quot; of Pashkovskaya (now part of Krasnodar) in Kuban Oblast into a Cossack family. Shkuro graduated from Cossack Sotnya of the Nikolaevsky Cavalry School in 1907 and served in the Kuban Cossack Host.

During World War I, Shkuro became the commander of a special partisan unit which executed several daring raids behind German lines. During the war, Shkuro was promoted to the rank of colonel for his heroic performance.

===Russian Civil War===
In the spring of 1918, after the establishment of the Bolshevik régime, Shkuro organized an anti-Bolshevik Cossack unit in the area of Batalpashinsk in the Caucasus. In May and June 1918 he raided Stavropol, Yessentuki and Kislovodsk. After officially joining Denikin&#x27;s Volunteer Army, he became the commander of the Kuban Cossacks brigade which soon increased in size and became a division. In May 1919 Shkuro, as a young lieutenant-general, had a whole cavalry corps of Cossacks under his command.

Shkuro, though charismatic and audacious, showed bravery which often bordered on the reckless; he received several wounds, and also acquired a reputation for his cunning. Many in the White Army&#x27;s high command, however, considered him undisciplined and somewhat of a &quot;loose cannon&quot;.

According to Soviet historians his forces (including his chief of staff Yakov Slashchov) were particularly cruel and prone to looting. In contrast, in his memoirs (which Shkuro dictated in 1921) he describes many instances in which he spared the lives of enemies, including even Bolshevik commissars (whom the Whites usually summarily executed). Shkuro claimed that he saved from execution a Red Army battalion of Jewish volunteers taken prisoner by the Whites, and that he spoke out against and prevented pogroms against the Jewish population.
When Denikin&#x27;s volunteer army took Kiev in August 1919,
however, it inflicted a large-scale pogrom on the Jews. Over 20,000 people died in two days of violence. After these events, Supresskin, the representative of the Kharkov Jewish community, spoke to Shkuro, who stated to him bluntly that &quot;Jews will not receive any mercy because they are all Bolsheviks&quot;.

Although the White Army general Pyotr Wrangel valued initiative he also demanded discipline from his subordinates. Wrangel ended up disliking Shkuro, and upon reorganizing the army Wrangel did not give him a command position; this prompted Shkuro&#x27;s resignation. Shkuro claimed that to the detriment of the anti-Bolshevik cause, both Denikin and Wrangel did not sufficiently understand Cossack society, and that as a result some of their decisions alienated the Cossacks — even though the White Cossacks remained deeply hostile to the policies of the Bolsheviks.

===In exile===
After the defeat of the Whites, Shkuro lived as an exile, primarily in France and Yugoslavia. For the first few years he and a few other Cossack partners, displaying their great horsemanship, performed in circuses as trick riders across Europe. In addition, he continued to conduct anti-Soviet activities. Russian émigré memoirs depict Shkuro as a very lively man who enjoyed social gatherings with plenty of dancing, singing, drinking, and vivid storytelling about times past.

===Second World War===

In 1941, Shkuro agreed to be one of the organizers of anti-Soviet Cossack units consisting of White émigrés and Soviet (mostly Cossack) prisoners of war in alliance with Nazi Germany. He, along with many other exiles, hoped that this would lead to the eventual destruction of the Soviet Union. In 1944, Shkuro was placed in command of the &quot;Cossack Reserve&quot;, which were primarily deployed in Yugoslavia against the partisans. In 1945, Shkuro was detained by the British forces in Austria and handed over to the Soviet authorities in Operation Keelhaul. The Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union sentenced Andrei Shkuro to death. On 17 January 1947, he was executed, together with Pyotr Krasnov, by hanging.

<doc id="1027629" wikidata="Q55621207" url="?curid=1027629" title="Long Duk Dong">
<text>Long Duk Dong is a fictional character who appears in &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, a 1984 American coming-of-age comedy film written and directed by John Hughes. Played by Japanese American actor Gedde Watanabe, the character is a Chinese foreign exchange student and a supporting character in the film set at a US suburban high school. The character has been called an offensive stereotype of Asian people.

==Fictional appearance==
In &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; (1984), Long Duk Dong (played by Gedde Watanabe) is a Chinese foreign exchange student who stays with the grandparents of the film&#x27;s protagonist Samantha (played by Molly Ringwald). He appears accompanied by a gong sound. He practices his conversational English with others, has his hair parted down the middle as an “” style, is mystified by American food, and calls himself &quot;The Donger&quot;. Dong also finds a love interest in Marlene, an athletic and chesty young woman who is physically larger than him.

Susannah Gora, writing about &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, said, &quot;The role of &#x27;The Donger&#x27; is pure comedy; a gong sounds every time Dong enters a scene. With his thick accent and bumbled attempts at American catchphrases (&#x27;Whass happenin&#x27;, haaht stuff?&#x27;), everything Long Duk Dong says and does is understandably offensive—but is also, admittedly, hilarious.&quot;

==Casting and performance==

Actor Gedde Watanabe, a Japanese American from Ogden, Utah, was cast as Long Duk Dong in what was &quot;his big Hollywood break&quot;. Before his audition, Watanabe had been in New York City performing for the musical &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; at The Public Theater. His agent had informed him of the role as a foreign exchange student, and Watanabe decided to spend time &quot;with a friend... who had a thick Korean accent&quot; and &quot;went to audition in character using [the] friend&#x27;s accent&quot;. Watanabe recalled his portrayal attempt, &quot;My training and my teachers had taught me that getting a character is about going for the intention. The Donger loved everything about America: the fun, the girls, the cars. So I didn&#x27;t so much go for the jokes, but played to his excitement and enthusiasm.&quot; He auditioned for casting director Jackie Burch in-character, convincing her that he was from Korea and barely spoke English. Since Burch once taught deaf people, she tried to use sign language with him before he revealed that he was born in Ogden, Utah. Director John Hughes was also originally fooled. When Hughes first heard Watanabe speak with his normal American accent, he chuckled and said: “Boy, was I duped.”

For the exercise machine sequence, Watanabe had found the machine in the attic of the mansion that was rented to use as the protagonist&#x27;s family&#x27;s household. He said of his character&#x27;s perspective of the machine, &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t have known what that thing was. he would&#x27;ve thought it was something that cleans rice or makes tofu.&quot; Watanabe showed the machine to Hughes, who ultimately filmed the sequence in which Long Duk Dong and his American girlfriend awkwardly ride the machine together.

Watanabe said some sequences with Long Duk Dong were left out of the final cut of the movie including a scene with him and his love interest in bed smoking and a rap performance at the school dance which got everyone dancing. Watanabe said the rap went something like: &#x27;I like Coca-Cola, lady skate roller, rock &#x27;n&#x27; rolla&#x27;&quot;. Watanabe expressed his hope that Universal would bring back Long Duk Dong&#x27;s rap in a future release of the film.

Watanabe said he had &quot;a great experience&quot; making &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; but recognized in retrospect that he was &quot;a bit naive&quot; about his role. He said, &quot;I was making people laugh. I didn&#x27;t realize how it was going to affect people.&quot; He said that &quot;some time&quot; after the film appeared in theaters, he learned how many people were upset about his character, recalling an experience at the Metropolitan Museum of Art when an Asian woman came up to him to complain about his portrayal. Watanabe said, &quot;I kind of understood, and I reasoned with it. But at the same time, I didn&#x27;t really think of it that way... Back then I didn&#x27;t understand as much as I do now. I was a little bit ignorant, too, because I grew up in Utah. I had a very strange upbringing where I didn&#x27;t experience that much racism. I just thought I was a part of everybody else.&quot;

After &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, Watanabe was cast in several accented roles but later mostly stopped using exaggerated Asian accents for his roles. The actor did recognize the popularity of his character and created voice mail messages in the voice of Long Duk Dong to auction off for charity.

==Contemporary critics&#x27; comments==
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a positive review and said of the character, &quot;There are a lot of effective performances in this movie, including... Gedde Watanabe as the exchange student (he elevates his role from a potentially offensive stereotype to high comedy).&quot; Janet Maslin, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said, &quot;When the movie goes too far, as it does with a stupid subplot about a sex-crazed Oriental exchange student or a running gag about a young woman in a body brace, at least it manages to bound back relatively soon thereafter.&quot;

==Legacy as Asian caricature==

In a 2008 NPR segment, the character of Long Duk Dong was described as a &quot;stain&quot; on Hollywood&#x27;s history of representing Asian characters. Critics noted that the character embodied numerous negative stereotypes, with his exaggerated accent, comedic incompetence, and gong-accompanied entrances contributing to a lasting cultural legacy of mockery for Asian-American men. Martin Wong and Eric Nakamura, co-founders of &quot;Giant Robot&quot; magazine, highlighted how &quot;The Donger&quot; became a common source of ridicule for Asian-American students during the 1980s, replacing earlier stereotypes like Bruce Lee with a more demeaning caricature.

In 2011, Susannah Gora, writing about the 1980s films of John Hughes, said, &quot;The only significant non-white character in any of these films is also the basest caricature of all: Long Duk Dong... A heightened national sense of cultural sensitivity (or political correctness, depending on how you look at it) swept America and the movie studios in the early nineties, and so the 1980s were, in many ways, the last moment when racially questionable jokes regularly found their place in mainstream comedies.&quot; Actress Molly Ringwald, who starred in &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, wrote in 2018 that in the film, &quot;Long Duk Dong... is a grotesque stereotype.&quot;

NPR revisited in 2015 the legacy of Long Duk Dong, describing the character as &quot;cringeworthy&quot; and emblematic of Hollywood&#x27;s reliance on offensive Asian stereotypes. NPR&#x27;s Kat Chow highlighted how the character reinforced tropes of Asian men as socially awkward, sexually inept, and perpetually foreign, further emphasizing the harm caused by such portrayals. Academic perspectives, such as those of Kent Ono and Vincent Pham, criticized the film&#x27;s comedic framing of Long Duk Dong&#x27;s gender and sexuality as aberrant, which contributed to the feminization of Asian-American men. Additionally, real-life implications of the character were felt by Asian-Americans, who reported being taunted with lines from the film, such as &quot;Oh, sexy girlfriend.&quot;

Catherine Driscoll, writing in &quot;Teen Film: A Critical Introduction&quot;, said Long Duk Dong in &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, Mr. Miyagi in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984), and Maria in &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) all represent &quot;the homogenization of racial difference in US popular culture including teen film&quot;. Driscoll said of John Hughes, who directed &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; and several other teen films, &quot;Even critics who praise Hughes&#x27;s sensitivity to adolescent drama acknowledge that his is a very partial picture of adolescence. The Hughes teen is white, suburban, and normatively middle-class... non-white characters appear in the background or are crass caricatures like &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;″ Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe).&quot;

Jamie Clarke, writing about the films of John Hughes in 2007, described Long Duk Dong as defying stereotypes, noting that &quot;uberdork Long Duk Dong proves himself to be a party animal&quot; and &quot;by the nights end the school&#x27;s entire social strata will have turned upside down&quot; with Samantha, the freshman geek, and also foreign exchange student Long Duk Dong finding romantic and social success. 

Gedde Watanabe, reflecting on his portrayal in 2024, said that he did not initially perceive the role as offensive, attributing his perspective to the scarcity of roles for Asian actors at the time. While he acknowledged some problematic elements of the character, he emphasized the role&#x27;s impact in sparking ongoing conversations about Asian representation in media and appreciated the evolving opportunities for more nuanced portrayals of Asian characters in Hollywood.

==In other media==

A 1980s cover band based in Lexington, Kentucky calls itself Long Duk Dong after the character. Band founder Shan Justice said, &quot;It&#x27;s odd that a character that&#x27;s not a primary character would have so much notability. But that one certainly did.&quot;

In the TV series &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot; episode &quot;Good Morning Orlando&quot;, in 2015, the specter of Long Duk Dong looms over Louis as he struggles with the responsibility of representing Chinese culture on a local talk show without perpetuating stereotypes.

<doc id="1027632" wikidata="Q5452299" url="?curid=1027632" title="First Among Equals (novel)">
<text>First Among Equals is a 1984 novel by British author Jeffrey Archer, which follows the careers and personal lives of four fictional British politicians (Simon Kerslake, MP for Coventry Central and later Pucklebridge; Charles Seymour, MP for Sussex Downs; Raymond Gould, MP for Leeds North; and Andrew Fraser, MP for Edinburgh Carlton) from 1964 to 1991, with each vying to become Prime Minister. Several situations in the novel are drawn from Archer&#x27;s own early political career in the British House of Commons, and the fictional characters interact with actual political figures from the UK and elsewhere including Winston Churchill, Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, Margaret Thatcher, Douglas Hurd, Muammar al-Gaddafi, Gary Hart and Queen Elizabeth II.

The title is a literal translation of the Latin term &quot;Primus inter pares,&quot; a term used to refer to either the most senior member of a group of equals (peers) or to refer to someone who claims to be just one member of a group of equals when in reality he or she completely dominates said group. This phrase is used to describe the official constitutional status of the British Prime Minister within the Cabinet.

==US and UK plot differences ==
When published in the United States, the novel was rewritten to eliminate the character of Andrew Fraser. The Fraser character eventually departs the Labour Party to join the breakaway Social Democratic Party. According to Archer, the change was made because the publisher did not believe an American audience could understand a multi-party political system. As a result, several plot elements revolving around Fraser were transferred to other characters, notably Simon Kerslake, who suffered through a change of heart toward a prospective marriage partner and the later loss of a child.

The ending of the novel differed in the US version, with both the winner of the ultimate election and the manner in which the contest was decided changing from one version to the next. In an interview, Archer joked that he found his American friends were generally more supportive of Kerslake, while his British readers backed Gould.

The original UK version was later released in the United States as well.

== Television serial ==

&quot;First Among Equals&quot; was adapted into a Granada Television serial transmitted by ITV in 1986.

==Characters==

===Raymond Gould===

====Personal life====

The son of Stephen Gould, a butcher, Raymond from a young age had wanted to pursue a political career rather than enter the family business.

Gould is in something of a marriage of convenience with his wife Joyce, owing to her efforts to maintain support for him in his Leeds constituency. Gould had originally wished to break off their months-long relationship before being told by Joyce that she was pregnant and being forced to marry her. After Joyce suffered a miscarriage whilst travelling on their honeymoon, Gould did not endeavour to start a family with her. Due to the fact that Raymond and Joyce spent much of their time apart in London and Leeds respectively, Gould engaged in a number of extramarital affairs, and had solicited a prostitute early in his ministerial career (which resulted in attempted blackmailed against him).

===Andrew Fraser===

====Political career====
Fraser was first elected as a Member of Parliament in 1964, continuously representing the constituency of Edinburgh Carlton during the events of the novel. Initially serving as a member of the Labour Party, he was deselected by his local party&#x27;s executive, owing to its growing far-left composition, and replaced by its chairman, Frank Boyle.

Due to his deselection, Fraser defected to the Social Democratic Party, first contesting his seat as its candidate in 1983. This election was newsworthy due to both Fraser and Boyle being tied, which was resolved via a coin toss which Fraser won. As a new SDP MP, Fraser then became its parliamentary Spokesman for Defence.

Following the resignation of David Owen as Leader of the SDP, Fraser succeeded him uncontested. Following the election of a hung parliament in 1991, Fraser agreed to support a Labour-led government headed by Raymond Gould on condition that two Cabinet positions be granted to SDP MPs, and that a referendum be held on proportional representation.

====Personal life====
Due to his decision to pursue a political career as a member of the Labour Party, Fraser had something of a friendly rivalry with his father, the chairman of the local Conservative party. Despite their political differences, Fraser&#x27;s father helped to support him, mentioning that he voted for his own son at each election and even appointing a non-entity candidate for the Conservatives to help his son&#x27;s re-election prospects when he first contested his seat for the SDP (although this may also have been to prevent the election of Boyle, an ardent Communist).

Fraser and his wife, Louise, had a fraught time starting a family. After a miscarriage and the death of a girl hours after being born, the Frasers managed to bear a son, Robert Bruce Fraser, although medical complications from the earlier two pregnancies made having more children inadvisable. However, at age five, Robert was killed in a traffic incident after chasing after a stray football, leading to his parents entering a state of mourning and his mother to enter a catatonic state. Wishing to have another child, the Frasers adopt Clariss.

===Charles Gurney Seymour===

The Honourable Charles Gurney Seymour is the second son of the Earl of Bridgwater. When the novel was first published in the United States, the character&#x27;s name was altered to &quot;Charles Gurney Hampton&quot;. As he is the younger of twins (by a mere nine minutes), he does not inherit his father&#x27;s peerage, shares in a merchant bank, a castle in Scotland or the 20,000-acre (80 km2) family estate. Missing out on such opulence, wealth and power to his harmless brother Rupert whom he despises (a feeling which his brother does not appear to share) leaves him bitter.

====Education====
Charles went to Eton College. After leaving school he progressed to Christ Church at the University of Oxford to read history. One night he heard a speech given by then-Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill. He was so inspired by the speech that he decided to do everything he could to become Prime Minister.

====Early political career====
An implacably ambitious and scheming man, Charles was elected the Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Sussex Downs with a majority in excess of 20,000 votes in the 1964 United Kingdom general election. He set about making himself stand out amongst the new intake of Conservative MPs. He ruthlessly backed Edward Heath for the leadership of the Conservative Party following the resignation of Sir Alec Douglas-Home simply because Heath was most likely to lead the party. His tactics paid off; Heath was elected leader and Charles was rewarded by being elevated to the front bench. His early posts included a stint in the Shadow Chief Whip&#x27;s Office and the Shadow Local Government and Housing Department.

====Political rival====
Charles Seymour always predicted Simon Kerslake was &quot;the only one of his contemporaries who could prevent him from leading the party.&quot; He therefore set about to wreck Kerslake&#x27;s career. He tried to bankrupt him, leaked any scandals he could find about Kerslake, abused his powers as Junior Whip to ensure that Kerslake was absent on crucial votes in the House of Commons, thus causing him to lose favour with the leader, and unsuccessfully attempted to block Kerslake&#x27;s bid to return to the Commons after his seat was abolished by boundary changes.

====Cabinet career====
Although he did not support her in the leadership election following the forced resignation of Edward Heath, Charles later served under Margaret Thatcher as Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary.

====Leadership contest====
Charles attempted to succeed Thatcher as Conservative Leader following her resignation. He stood against Kerslake and the foppish MP Alec Pimkin for the leadership. He topped the first ballot with an insufficient majority, prompting a run-off vote, which he lost. He lost the second ballot largely thanks to the defeated Alec Pimkin deciding to vote for Kerslake (he later confessed that he wanted to go to his grave knowing he done at least one decent thing).

Seymour was also damaged by the donation of a famous and expensive family portrait of the &quot;First Earl of Bridgewater&quot; to the British Museum. The move was perceived by members as being opportunistic, and contributed to Seymour getting a lower 2nd ballot total than on the first ballot.

In reality, the portrait was stolen from him by his ex-wife Fiona, who wanted to inflict maximum personal hurt on Seymour. She made the donation in the midst of the leadership contest knowing Seymour could not ask for its return. Believing that Seymour had donated the portrait himself, many Conservative MPs regarded the act has opportunistic, swaying opinion towards Kerslake.

&quot;First Ballot (held on Tuesday 16 May 1989)&quot;

1. Charles Seymour 138 votes

2. Simon Kerslake 135 votes

3. Alec Pimkin 15 votes

&quot;Second Ballot (held on Tuesday 23 May 1989)&quot;

1. Simon Kerslake 158 votes

2. Charles Seymour 130 votes

====Post-front bench career====
Charles was depressed about losing the leadership contest. His fate was sealed when his embittered ex-wife sold his story to the tabloid &quot;News of the World&quot; revealing all his underhand tactics. Kerslake was not bitter, however, and made Charles (who at this point was aging rapidly) numerous offers to return to the front bench. Charles declined them all and at his request became the Speaker of the House of Commons. As Speaker, he hosted a historic dinner at which Queen Elizabeth II revealed her intention to abdicate.

====Family====
Charles had a poor relationship with his mother, he detested his brother the Earl, and his two marriages both ended in divorce; his first wife, Fiona, had engaged in an extramarital affair with the chairman of the local Conservative association of Charles&#x27; constituency, whilst his second wife, Amanda, secretly sold off several Bridgewater family heirlooms for personal profit. Yet he showed a tremendous devotion to his son Harry, and was devastated when his ex-wife implied that Harry might not be his child (he was delighted when a blood type test suggested that he was, albeit not conclusively).

In the ITV television adaptation of &quot;First Among Equals&quot;, Charles was played by Jeremy Child.

===Simon Kerslake===

Simon Kerslake is a British Conservative Party politician, representing the Coventry Central and later Pucklebridge constituencies, who served under Prime Ministers Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher. There is a certain amount of autobiographical influence in the character, as he shares Archer&#x27;s politics, sporting history and a financial scandal that threatens his political career.

====Personal life====
Simon is a devoted family man married to Elizabeth (née Drummond), a gynaecologist, with two children, Peter and Michael (in the American edition, Peter and Lucy). His desire to look after his family nearly costs him his political career in the British House of Commons: anxious to give his family the lifestyle he felt they desired, he makes some risky investments, accumulates a lot of debt and only narrowly avoids bankruptcy.

====Political career====
Kerslake is a centrist Conservative, hard-working and honourable (despite his poor business judgment).

With only a few political missteps, Kerslake rises steadily through the Conservative Party during his 30-year career. Boundary changes lead to the abolition of his constituency at the February 1974 general election but he finds another and returns to the Commons at the October 1974 general election. He is badly injured by an IRA bomb while serving as Minister of State for Northern Ireland. He serves in a number of other Cabinet posts, including Secretary of State for Defence.

Simon&#x27;s biggest rival is Charles Gurney Seymour, an aristocratic Conservative MP who does everything he can to stymie and sidetrack him. Simon narrowly survives each attempt to bring him down, and ultimately defeats him in a closely fought contest to be elected Leader of the Conservative Party.

The novel culminates in an extremely close general election in 1991 (the novel was published in 1984). The Labour Party leader, Raymond Gould, becomes Prime Minister in the original British edition of the novel, which ends with King Charles III inviting Kerslake to Buckingham Palace and informing him that he intends to make Gould his first Prime Minister. However, in the US edition, Gould is invited to Buckingham Palace. Charles III then informs him that in fact, Kerslake is to become the Prime Minister.

<text>Włodzimierz Puchalski (March 6, 1909 – January 19, 1979) was a Polish photographer and film director. He was a pioneer of wildlife film-making in Poland and became famous for publishing his album &quot;Bezkrwawe łowy&quot; (or bloodless hunting) in 1954. 

==Life==
Puchalski was born in Velyki Mosty, near Lwów (then in Austria-Hungary, now Lviv in Ukraine). His father Władysław Puchalski owned an estate with Katarzyna née Sykora. His first experience with cameras began when his maternal grandfather Hieronim Sykora gifted him a wooden camera. An uncle Antoni Sykora was an expert on the birds and nature and accompanied young Puchalski in the outdoors. He spent endless hours taking pictures of animals, flowers and landscapes. He studied at the Politechnika Lwowska to become an agronomic engineer. He began his photographic career while in the Cadet Corps and during his college studies, initially photographing waterfowl in the fish ponds at Żółkiew (Zhovkva) from hides made of grass, and, later, carnivorous birds in Sokal. A friend, Tadeusz Chrzanowski (1926–2006), invited him to their family estate in Moroczyn. While on this visit, he was captivated by Edward&#x27;s stepmother, Izabela (1900–1956). Puchalski assisted Witold Romer in 1933 on photochemistry and exhibited a set of photographs in 1936 and won awards in 1937 at the World Hunting Exhibition in Berlin. He worked also as an assistant to Kazimierz Wodzicki. He also recorded hunting scenes of the Polish nobility. He used the term &quot;bloodless hunt&quot; to describe hunting wildlife with a camera.

During World War II, he joined as an artillery lieutenant in 1939 and saw action in Lublin and Wołyniu. He was captured but managed to escape and from 1940 to 1944 he He was taken prisoner, from which he managed to escape. In the years 1940–1944 he worked as a forest ranger in the Brzóza estate in Sandomierz, working alongside the partisans. During the war, Izabela&#x27;s husband Wincenty Chrzanów died and Puchalski married her on September 5, 1945. The couple then began to travel and make nature films together. In 1946, he joined forces with the Łódź educational film company &quot;Wytwórnia Filmów Oświatowych w Łodzi&quot; and, travelling throughout Poland, took photographs of nature subjects: flocks of migratory birds on the Biebrza and Narew rivers, as well as wisent, elk, wolves, lynx, beavers, deer and smaller animals. His first film was on bird island. He resigned from the company in 1950 partly because there were objections to the work team consisting of him, Izabela and Tadeusz (friend and since 1945 technically stepson) but rejoined it in 1956 after the death of his wife Izabela.

On Spitsbergen, he gathered substantive material about the fauna of the archipelago; in the Polish research station on King George Island in the Antarctic, he photographed penguins, sea lions, whale bones and birds. He died while filming skuas.

==Death==
Puchalski was assigned to the third polar expedition headed by Stanislaw Rakusa-Suszczewski and arrived at the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station in 1978. He died on 19 January 1979 while working at the station and was buried on a hill to the south of the station.

==Film festival==
The Włodzimierz Puchalski International Nature Film Festival is held yearly in Łódź in Puchalski&#x27;s honour.

<text>Albertina Marie Majorino ( ; born February 7, 1985) is an American film and television actress. She started her career as a child actress, starring in films such as &quot;Andre&quot;; &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;; &quot;Waterworld&quot;; &quot;Corrina, Corrina&quot;; and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

After her early success as a child actress, she returned to acting at age 18 as the character Deb in the 2004 film &quot;Napoleon Dynamite.&quot; From 2004 to 2007, she portrayed Cindy &quot;Mac&quot; Mackenzie on &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, and reprised the character in the 2014 spinoff film; she was offered the chance to play the character once again in the eight-episode fourth season in 2019, but turned it down. She has appeared in multiple television series, including &quot;Big Love&quot;, &quot;True Blood&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. She also played the part of Maggie Harris on the television series &quot;Legends&quot;. She later appeared in the recurring role of Florence in the television series &quot;Scorpion&quot;.

==Early life==
Majorino was born in Westlake Village, California, a city in Los Angeles County, to Sarah and Bob Majorino. She has Italian ancestry on her paternal side. Majorino has an older brother, Kevin, with whom she has formed a rock band, The AM Project.

==Career==
Majorino began her acting career in a 1992 sitcom called &quot;Camp Wilder&quot;. Her first film role was in 1994&#x27;s &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;. She subsequently starred in leading roles in the family films &quot;Corrina, Corrina&quot; and &quot;Andre&quot;, both of which were released in August 1994. Her next film was the 1995 action film &quot;Waterworld&quot;, playing a child named Enola.

She played the title role in the 1999 television film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. After &quot;Alice&quot;, she took time off from show business, later saying that she stopped acting so she would not miss out on her childhood: &quot;I wanted to experience the things that a little kid can experience and get to know myself so when I came back I could be tough enough and strong enough to keep a good attitude, keep my head on straight and make the right decisions for myself and my family.&quot; She did not appear in another film until the 2004 cult film &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;. From 2004 onward, she played a recurring role on UPN&#x27;s series, &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, as the computer-savvy Cindy &quot;Mac&quot; Mackenzie. She first appeared in the show&#x27;s eighth episode, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, and continued until the show&#x27;s series finale, &quot;The Bitch is Back&quot;. Show creator Rob Thomas created the role with her in mind. She had met Thomas while interviewing him for a report on one of his books. Majorino became a series regular in the show&#x27;s third and final season. During her time on &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, she also started appearing in a recurring role on the cable television series &quot;Big Love&quot; with &quot;Waterworld&quot; costar Jeanne Tripplehorn and fellow &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; cast members Amanda Seyfried and Kyle Gallner. In 2005, she appeared in the music video for the song &quot;Blind&quot; by rock group Lifehouse.

She started filming for &quot;The Deep End&quot;, a television show for ABC in 2009. She played the role of Addy Fisher, a meek, insecure first-year associate at a high-profile law firm. The show was canceled after only six episodes were aired.

She returned to television in 2011 playing the recurring role of Special Agent Genny Shaw on &quot;Bones&quot;. She also starred in the music video for &quot;Fuckin&#x27; Perfect&quot; by Pink.

In 2012, she reprised her role as Deb in the animated TV version of &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;. She was also seen playing the role of the vampire Molly in Season 5 of the HBO television series &quot;True Blood&quot;, an uncredited role as a pregnant woman in the Fox show, &quot;Raising Hope&quot;, in an episode titled &quot;Tarot Cards,&quot; and the role of intern Dr. Heather Brooks in Season 9 of the ABC series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, with her character being killed off in the two-part premiere of Season 10. In 2014 she appeared in the &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; film as her character Mac, a project financed by fans through Kickstarter. Majorino was approached to reprise the role of Mac when &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; was renewed for a fourth season by Hulu in 2019, but turned it down upon learning the role was essentially a cameo.

In an interview with Mental in 2022, Majorino talks about dealing with anxiety and how therapy, meditation, and setting boundaries has helped her finally find self-love.

<text>Jeanne Marie Tripplehorn (born June 10, 1963) is an American actress. She began her career on stage, acting in several plays throughout the early 1990s, including Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; on Broadway. Her film career began with the role of a police psychologist in the erotic thriller &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992). Her other film roles include &quot;The Firm&quot; (1993), &quot;Waterworld&quot; (1995) and &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; (1998). On television, she starred as Barbara Henrickson on the HBO drama series &quot;Big Love&quot; (2006–2011) and as Dr. Alex Blake on the CBS police drama &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; (2012–2014), and she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for her performance as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the 2009 HBO movie &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;.

== Early life ==
Tripplehorn was born on June 10, 1963, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the daughter of Suzanne Ferguson and Tom Tripplehorn, who was once a guitarist with Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys. Her parents divorced when she was two years old. She graduated from Edison High School in 1981 and spent one semester studying at the University of Tulsa. She performed on the local television shows &quot;Creature Feature&quot; (1982–83) and &quot;Night Shift&quot; (1983). She also worked part-time, then full-time on local rock radio station KMOD for several years before leaving for Juilliard. She then attended the Juilliard School&#x27;s Drama Division as a member of &quot;Group 19&quot; (1986–1990), which also included Laura Linney.

== Career ==

Tripplehorn began her career on stage. She appeared Off-Broadway in John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s &quot;The Big Funk&quot; in 1990, then co-starred with Val Kilmer in a 1993 production of John Ford&#x27;s 1630s play &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot;. She has also been on Broadway in Anton Chekov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; opposite Amy Irving and Lili Taylor. In 1992, she made her film debut, in a supporting role in the erotic thriller &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;. The following year, she appeared as Abby McDeere opposite Tom Cruise in &quot;The Firm&quot; and in 1995 had another lead role alongside Kevin Costner in &quot;Waterworld&quot;. As lead actress, she starred in the 1997 box-office bomb &quot;&#x27;Til There Was You&quot;. The next few years she had supporting roles in small films, including &quot;Office Killer&quot;, &quot;Monument Ave.&quot;, and &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;; and in 1999 appeared opposite Hugh Grant in the British romantic comedy &quot;Mickey Blue Eyes&quot;. She was cast opposite Madonna in the 2002 film &quot;Swept Away&quot;.

In 2006, Tripplehorn was cast in a leading role as Barbara Henrickson in the HBO drama series &quot;Big Love&quot;, opposite Bill Paxton, regarded as the most successful role of her career. In 2009, she played Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the HBO movie &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;. She was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for this performance. In 2011, she appeared in &quot;Five&quot;, a movie on the Lifetime television network. In July 2012, Tripplehorn joined the cast of CBS procedural &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; in season eight, replacing Paget Brewster&#x27;s character Emily Prentiss. She received a six-figure salary per episode of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. She left the series after two seasons and Jennifer Love Hewitt replaced her as a new agent.

Tripplehorn has appeared in the independent films &quot;Little Pink House&quot; (2017), with Catherine Keener, and &quot;Gloria Bell&quot; (2018), starring Julianne Moore. In 2020, she returned to television in the Hulu miniseries &quot;Mrs. America&quot; opposite Cate Blanchett, Sarah Paulson, Rose Byrne, Tracey Ullman and Margo Martindale. She was later cast in a recurring role in the HBO period drama series &quot;The Gilded Age&quot; starring Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon.

== Personal life ==
Tripplehorn married actor Leland Orser in 2000. They have a son.

<text>Kenneth MacLean Glazier Sr. (September 21, 1912 – November 11, 1989) was a Canadian minister and librarian.

He was minister of Glenview Presbyterian Church in Toronto before working at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. He later served as chief librarian of the University of Calgary Library.

While at the University of Calgary, he established in the Rare Books and Special Collections of the library the Kenneth M. Glazier Collection of the papers of Canadian authors, including those of Hugh MacLennan and Mordecai Richler.

He founded the Kenneth Maclean Glazier Scholarship for the study of Canadian literature at the university. He wrote or edited &quot;Africa South of the Sahara: A Select &amp; Annotated Bibliography, 1964-1968&quot;, &quot;South Africa; a collection of miscellaneous documents, 1902-1963&quot;, and, with Peter Duigan, he authored &quot;A checklist of serials for African studies&quot;.

==Politics==
He was Secretary of the Alberta Liberal Party.

==Family==
In 1940 he married Lily Teresa Ferster; they had three children: Gretchen, and twins, Christopher and Kenneth.

==Death==
He died of a heart attack in Calgary on November 11, 1989.

==Kenneth MacLean Glazier==
It is important to distinguish him from his son, Kenneth MacLean Glazier (Harvard Student Strike), who is a California attorney, known as &quot;Kenneth M. Glazier&quot; or &quot;Kenneth MacLean Glazier&quot; (, ) although there are instances of Kenneth M. Glazier Sr. being referred to as such following his son&#x27;s birth.

<doc id="1027654" wikidata="Q2463199" url="?curid=1027654" title="Levitron">
<text>Levitron is a brand of levitating toys and gifts in science and educational markets marketed by Creative Gifts Inc. and Fascination Toys &amp; Gifts. The &quot;Levitron&quot; top device is a design that served as a base for the manufacture of a series of commercial toys under this brand that employ the phenomenon known as spin-stabilized magnetic levitation. This design, with moving permanent magnets, is quite distinct from other versions which use changing electromagnetic fields, levitating various items such as a rotating world globe, model space shuttle or VW Beetle, and picture frame. 750,000 units of the top were sold from 1994 through 1999.

==The top device==

The toy top is essentially a permanent magnetic ring and corresponding magnetic base plate with a ring or ring shaped magnetic configuration. Functional parameters, such as the top rotation rate or top weighting, are stringent. Employing principles of the magnetic field and gyroscopic stabilization, the Levitron top induces levitation through a series of interactive steps. The levitated top&#x27;s stabilizing rotation undergoes natural, gradual slowing, so that the levitation phenomenon fails within four minutes unless external power is supplied to sustain rotation.

To levitate the top, a plastic plate is placed on top of the magnetic base, and the top is spun on the plate at 25–50 rotations per second (1500–3000 rpm). If too slow, the top falls over and slides off sideways; if too fast it does not orient itself to follow magnetic flux as it moves, and slides off. Since it can be difficult to spin the top fast enough by hand, Creative Gifts produced a battery-powered, hand held device to spin the top with an electric motor. Next, the plate is lifted by hand until, if conditions are right, the top rises above it to an equilibrium point. The top must also be weighted with washers of various sizes supplied in the kit. If too heavy it will not rise above the plate; if too light it flies off.

After a few minutes, the top falls when air friction slows it below the critical speed. Air temperature, air currents, ground vibration, and power source interruptions also alter the delicate equilibrium necessary to keep the top stable. More expensive laboratory versions can sustain a levitating top indefinitely by sustaining the top rotation, actively compensating for aberrations in rotation. The makers of the Levitron have developed a &quot;Perpetuator&quot;, which sits under the Levitron and sends out an additional magnetic pulse. The additional force nudges the spinning top enough to maintain a constant speed. With a constant speed, and with the Levitron perfectly level, the Levitron top can spin for longer periods of time.

==Company history==

===Invention and patents===
The first spin-stabilized permanent magnet levitation device was invented (c 1976) and patented (1983) by inventor Roy Harrigan, of Vermont. In the mid-1990s, Seattle entrepreneur Bill Hones, who was himself exploring the possibility of permanent magnet levitation, discovered Harrigan&#x27;s patent. Hones subsequently contacted Harrigan and later met with him. Upon Hones&#x27; request, Harrigan permitted him to borrow his prototype with the understanding that they were entering into a business arrangement. Hones, with the help of his father, a Physicist and employee at Los Alamos National Laboratory, analyzed the physics of the prototype, and then filed for an &quot;improvement patent&quot;. In 1984, independent of Roy Harrigan, inventor Joseph Chieffo, of Pennsylvania, also discovered spin-stabilized magnetic levitation. Chieffo then developed his own spin-stabilized magnetic levitation device and attempted to obtain a patent thereon. Employing an attorney to conduct a U.S. Patent and Trademark records search, Chieffo was informed of the existence of the Harrigan patent; he thus concluded his efforts to secure a patent. In a final assessment, Chieffo&#x27;s attorney noted that his device, although apparently unpatentable, could be marketed without infringing upon the Harrigan patent. In 1988, Chieffo marketed his device in kit form. Contrasting with the dished supporting magnet of the Harrigan invention, the base magnet of this latter device was rectangular and planar of upper surface, not unlike the base magnet of Hones&#x27; later-patented device, the now-popular Physics toy known as the Levitron.

In 2012 and 2014, Levitrons were operated at an angle of 45° as well as with their spin axis horizontal. This inclined and horizontal operation was obtained with the help of additional magnetic &quot;V&quot;s. The horizontal Levitron is particularly stable, which gives it educational potential.

===Trademark litigation===
In the 1990s, the then husband and wife partners Michael and Karen Sherlock formed the company they named &quot;UFO&quot; in New Mexico to market the Levitron under an oral agreement in partnership with Hones&#x27; company, Creative Gifts, Inc. Efforts to formalize the agreement in writing fell apart and grew acrimonious after UFO&#x27;s principals learned about the device&#x27;s earlier invention by Harrigan, and redesigned their website to incorporate the exposé-style article &quot;THE HIDDEN HISTORY OF THE LEVITRON!&quot;, which accused Hones of stealing the invention from Harrigan. Creative Gifts, in turn, filed a trademark infringement suit in United States District Court of New Mexico against UFO and its owners. At trial and on appeal to the Tenth Circuit Creative Gifts&#x27; trademark claims were upheld, and all of UFO&#x27;s counterclaims were rejected after UFO, which had been representing itself as a pro se defendant, was sanctioned by the court for abuse of discovery. The appeals court, noting that UFO had submitted a one-page opening brief with no citations to the record or discussion of the relevant law, commented in its ruling, &quot;they have shot themselves in the foot.&quot;

<text>Karol Stanisław Olszewski (: ; 29 January 1846 – 24 March 1915) was a Polish chemist, mathematician, and physicist. Together with Zygmunt Wróblewski, in 1883 he was the first scientist in the world to liquify oxygen and nitrogen.

==Life and career==
He was born in 1846 in Broniszów. He was a graduate of Kazimierz Brodziński High School in Tarnów (I Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Kazimierza Brodzińskiego). He studied at Kraków&#x27;s Jagiellonian University in the departments of mathematics and physics, and chemistry and biology. He carried out his first experiments using a personally improved compressor, compressing and condensing carbon dioxide.

Olszewski defended his doctoral dissertation at Heidelberg University, then returned to Kraków, where he was made &quot;profesor nadzwyczajny&quot; (associate professor).

In 1883, Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski were the first in the world to liquefy oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in a stable state (not, as had been the case up to then, in a dynamic state in the transitional form as vapor).

In 1884, in his Kraków laboratory, Olszewski was the first to liquefy hydrogen in a dynamic state, achieving a record low temperature of −225 °C (48 K). In 1895 he liquefied argon. He then failed only to liquefy the newly discovered helium element.

In January 1896, on hearing of Wilhelm Röntgen&#x27;s work with X-rays, within a few days Olszewski replicated it. Later on, in early February he provided an X-ray image of a luxated elbow thus initiating the university&#x27;s department of radiology.

He died on 24 March 1915 and was buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery in Kraków. In 2018, his ashes were transferred to one of Poland&#x27;s National Pantheons located at the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in the Old Town district of Kraków.

According to physicist Andrzej Kajetan Wróblewski, Olszewski is among the greatest Polish physicists of the 20th century alongside Marie Curie, Marian Smoluchowski, Jerzy Pniewski, and Marian Danysz.

<text>William Gerard O&#x27;Dea ( ; born 1 November 1952) is an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who has been a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Limerick City constituency since 2011, and previously from 1982 to 2011 for the Limerick East constituency. He has served as Minister for Defence from 2004 to 2010, and was a Minister of State in different departments from 1992 to 1994, and again from 1997 to 2004.

==Early and private life==
O&#x27;Dea was born in Limerick in 1952, but he was raised in Kilteely, County Limerick. He was educated at the Patrician Brothers College in Ballyfin, County Laois, and University College Dublin where he studied law. He qualified as a barrister at King&#x27;s Inns, Dublin and as an accountant from the Institute of Certified Accountants. He worked as both a barrister and as an accountant before embarking on a career in politics. He also lectured in the law faculties of both University College Dublin and the National Institute of Higher Education, Limerick (now the University of Limerick). As a lecturer, he taught future cabinet colleague and Taoiseach Brian Cowen.

O&#x27;Dea is married to Geraldine Kennedy. He writes regularly for the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; and occasionally for other national newspapers.

==Early political career==
O&#x27;Dea first held political office as a Fianna Fáil member of Limerick County Council. He served on that authority until 1992. He first stood for election to Dáil Éireann in Limerick East at the 1981 general election, but was unsuccessful. He was elected to the Dáil on his second attempt at the February 1982 general election, capturing Fianna Fáil&#x27;s second seat.

Like his former constituency colleague Desmond O&#x27;Malley, O&#x27;Dea was opposed to Charles Haughey&#x27;s leadership throughout the 1980s, becoming a member of the so-called Gang of 22. When O&#x27;Malley founded Progressive Democrats in 1985 and left Fianna Fáil, O&#x27;Dea became the only Fianna Fáil TD in the five-seat Limerick East constituency.

==Ministerial career==
In January 1992, after Albert Reynolds succeeded Charles Haughey as leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach in coalition with the Progressive Democrats. O&#x27;Dea was appointed as a Minister of State at the Department of Justice. In January 1993, in the Fianna Fáil–Labour Party coalition government, O&#x27;Dea was reappointed at Justice with the additional appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health. He held these positions until December 1994, when the government collapsed.

After the 1997 general election, Fianna Fáil were back in government in coalition with the Progressive Democrats and O&#x27;Dea was appointed a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science. Here he had responsibility for Adult Education and the School Transport Scheme. He oversaw reform and increased investment in adult education and back to school initiatives, starting with the launch of Green Paper in November 1998.

Following the 2002 general election, O&#x27;Dea was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with special responsibility for Equality and Disability Issues. His main responsibility during this period was the passage of the Disabilities Bill, which the government had been forced to withdraw in early 2002 in the teeth of opposition from the disability sector. After a number of changes, including a form of the independent assessment of needs demanded by the disability organisations, O&#x27;Dea introduced a new bill in September 2004 along with an implementation package.

In September 2004, O&#x27;Dea was appointed Minister for Defence in a cabinet reshuffle. His tenure commenced as the army deafness compensation issue was starting to come to an end.

In November 2005, O&#x27;Dea was photographed during a media event at the Curragh Camp pointing an automatic pistol at a photographer. The photo appeared on the front page of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; the following day. O&#x27;Dea apologised saying that it was not his intention to glamorise gun crime.

As Minister for Defence, O&#x27;Dea prioritised two particular issues: the recruitment of more women to the Defence Forces and the promotion of more serving non-commissioned members to the commissioned ranks, often called &quot;promotion from the ranks&quot;.

He also presided over Ireland&#x27;s second tour in Lebanon in late 2006, as part of UNIFIL 2 and participation in the EUFOR mission to Chad.

==O&#x27;Dea and Limerick==
O&#x27;Dea is highly identified with his native Limerick. Three main issues have dominated his recent pronouncements on Limerick: Shannon Airport, Dell and gangland crime.

In August 2007, he broke ranks with cabinet colleagues to speak out against Aer Lingus&#x27;s decision to cease London Heathrow Airport flights from Shannon.

In December 2008, O&#x27;Dea and Tánaiste Mary Coughlan flew to Dell&#x27;s Corporate HQ in Texas, in a last-ditch and ultimately futile attempt to stop the closure of Dell&#x27;s manufacturing plant in Raheen, Limerick. Manufacturing was moved to Poland, with the loss of about two thirds of the jobs at Dell&#x27;s Limerick operation.

The murder of two innocent men in Limerick within months of each other: Shane Geoghegan and Roy Collins increased pressure on O&#x27;Dea locally, as a member of the cabinet, to secure changes to the law and greater resources to tackle Limerick city&#x27;s gangland crime.

On 5 February 2010, O&#x27;Dea announced that the government would not deliver its commitments to fund the Limerick Regeneration project. The €1.7bn funds (between 2009 and 2018) promised by the government will no longer be delivered.

In October 2017, Willie O&#x27;Dea accused Johnny Depp of libel after calling Limerick &#x27;Stab City&#x27;, a term once linked with the city.

It was announced in 2021 that O&#x27;Dea and former minister Batt O&#x27;Keeffe had left the board of a UK property developer linked to the bulk sale of social housing in Limerick to approved housing bodies that qualify for State funding. Mr O’Dea had been non-executive chairman of Formation Group since mid-2014.

==Defamation case and resignation==

On 10 March 2009, O&#x27;Dea alleged in an interview with the &quot;Limerick Leader&quot; that a brothel had been operating in a house owned by Nessan Quinlivan, brother of Maurice Quinlivan who at the time was a Sinn Féin candidate in Limerick for the upcoming June 2009 local elections. On 14 April 2009, O&#x27;Dea signed an affidavit to the courts, denying making such allegations. Quinlivan sought an injunction under the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act 1923: under section 11 of the act it is a criminal offence to make or publish a false statement of fact in relation to an election candidate. In December 2009, O&#x27;Dea settled the case out of court and apologised to Quinlivan for making &quot;false and defamatory statements&quot; during the interview, after a tape recording of the interview emerged. O&#x27;Dea also paid an undisclosed sum in damages to Quinlivan. A settlement agreement was read out in the High Court.

On 16 February 2010, Fine Gael announced it intended to table a motion of no confidence in O&#x27;Dea, however, the government responded with a motion of confidence. The government won the confidence motion in O&#x27;Dea in the Dáil on 17 February 2010. The Green Party, coalition partners in government with O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s party, voted with Fianna Fáil on the motion. However, Green Party Chairman Senator Dan Boyle wrote on Twitter, that he has &quot;no confidence&quot; in O&#x27;Dea and declaring him to be &quot;compromised&quot;.

On 18 February 2010, O&#x27;Dea resigned as Minister for Defence. In his resignation letter, he said that he had come to the conclusion: &quot;that my continuing in office would distract from the important and vital work of the Government&quot;. O&#x27;Dea said he decided to resign when it became clear that the Green Party would no longer support the Government if he was to stay in office.

==Reappointment to front bench==
O&#x27;Dea was appointed to Micheál Martin&#x27;s frontbench as Spokesperson for Communications, as part of the Fianna Fáil campaign for the 2011 general election.

In the 2011 election he was re-elected to the newly formed Limerick City constituency, polling 16% of the vote, down from the 39% he polled four years previously. He was the Fianna Fáil Spokesperson on Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation from April 2011 to July 2012. In July 2012, he was appointed as Spokesperson on Social Protection and Social Equality.

At the 2016 general election, O&#x27;Dea increased his share of the first preference from 16% to 27.8%. He was re-elected on the first count. He was re-elected again at the 2020 general election, with a reduced vote share.

O&#x27;Dea is understood to have raised concerns about the direction of the Fianna Fáil party under the leadership of Micheál Martin at internal party meetings but has so far declined to do so in public. Almost two years after the Coalition Government with Fine Gael and the Green Party was formed, O&#x27;Dea remarked that “By now I think you’d have more chance of getting young people interested in the music of Big Tom than getting them into Fianna Fáil,” in reference to the Irish country and traditional music singer.

In 2023, O&#x27;Dea voiced his criticism of the decision by the Minister for Justice, Simon Harris, to grant an application by convicted killer Logan Jackson, to move him from Limerick Prison to a jail in the Great Britain, so as to be nearer his family. O&#x27;Dea supported the legal challenge by Tracey Tully, the mother of the murdered champion Irish boxer, Kevin Sheehy.

<text>Richard Roche (born 30 March 1947) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister of State for European Affairs from 2002 to 2004 and 2007 to 2011 and Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government from 2004 to 2007. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Wicklow constituency from 1987 to 1992 and 1997 to 2011. He was a Senator for the Administrative Panel from 1992 to 1997.

==Early and private life==
Roche was born in Wexford. He was educated at Wexford Christian Brothers School and University College Dublin (UCD) where he received Bachelor of Commerce Degree and a master&#x27;s degree in Public Administration.

Roche is married to Eleanor Griffin, and they have three sons and one daughter. They live in County Wicklow.

On 15 December 2008, he was held hostage during a robbery at the Druids Glen Marriott Hotel and Country Club in County Wicklow.

==Political career==
Roche worked as a public servant at the Departments of Posts and Telegraphs, Transport and Power, Finance and at the Department of Economic Planning and Development. In 1978, he was appointed lecturer in Public Administration and Public Finance at UCD. In 1978, Roche became the first Irish citizen to be awarded a United Nations Human Rights fellowship. He subsequently became a member of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace and served as a time as Chairman of the commission.

Roche began his political career when he was elected for Greystones at the 1985 Wicklow County Council election. Two years later, at the 1987 general election he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD for Wicklow.

Roche lost his seat at the 1992 general election, but was elected to 20th Seanad. He introduced the Freedom of Information Bill 1995, based closely on the Norwegian freedom of information legislation. He was returned to the 28th Dáil at the 1997 general election and remained a TD until 2011.

Following the 2002 general election Roche was appointed as Minister of State for European Affairs, at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs. In his role, he played a large role during Ireland&#x27;s presidency of the European Council in 2004. In 2004, Roche was conferred with the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana by the Government of Estonia for his support of Estonia&#x27;s accession to the European Union. In 2004, he was appointed as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. He retained his seat at the 2007 general election, but on the formation of the new government, was the only member of the outgoing cabinet to be demoted. His last act as minister was the signing of an order that was to lead to work being resumed on the controversial M3 motorway near the Hill of Tara. He was re-appointed as Minister of State for European Affairs, during which Ireland conducted two referendums on the Treaty of Lisbon.

==2011 election defeat==
He lost his seat at the 2011 general election, polling only 5.5% of the first preference vote, down from the 15.8% he polled four years previously. Roche prolonged the count by requesting a recount when it was found that only three votes separated him and his Fianna Fáil running mate Pat Fitzgerald, an action which was criticised by some other candidates including Fitzgerald, who also accepted that there wouldn&#x27;t be a seat for Fianna Fáil. He was not present at the announcement of his elimination which was greeted by cheering and applause from a number of people at the count centre.

<text>Mary Hanafin (born 1 June 1959) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport from 2010 to 2011, Deputy leader of Fianna Fáil from January 2011 to March 2011, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation from January 2011 to March 2011, Minister for Social and Family Affairs from 2008 to 2010, Minister for Education and Science from 2004 to 2008, Government Chief Whip from 2002 to 2004 and Minister of State for Children from 2000 to 2002. She served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dún Laoghaire constituency from 1997 to 2011.

She served as a Councillor on Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council, representing the Blackrock local electoral area from May 2014 to June 2024.

==Early and personal life==
Hanafin was born in Thurles, County Tipperary, in 1959. She is the daughter of Des Hanafin and Mona (nee Brady). Des Hanafin was a businessman and Fianna Fáil councillor, who later served as a Senator at various times for over twenty-five years between 1969 and 2002. Her brother John Hanafin was a member of Seanad Éireann from 2002 to 2011.

Hanafin was educated at the Presentation Convent in Thurles and St. Patrick&#x27;s College in Maynooth, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree. She subsequently worked as a secondary school teacher, teaching Irish and History in the Dominican College Sion Hill in Blackrock, Dublin. Hanafin also obtained a diploma in legal studies at the Dublin Institute of Technology.

Hanafin married Eamon Leahy, a Senior Counsel, in 1985. He died suddenly on 17 July 2003, aged 46. The couple had no children.

==Early political career==
Hanafin was involved in politics from the age of 15. Her father Des Hanafin, as well as being a Senator for Fianna Fáil, was a founding member of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) and a staunch opponent of contraception, abortion and divorce. She joined Ógra Fianna Fáil aged fifteen and spoke at her first Ard Fheis two years later. Hanafin first became involved in national politics in 1980 when, at the age of twenty-one, she was elected to the Fianna Fáil national executive, the party&#x27;s ruling body.

She was elected to Dublin City Council at the 1985 local elections for the Rathmines local electoral area, but she unsuccessfully sought election to Dáil Éireann at the 1989 general election, standing in the Dublin South-East constituency. She lost her seat on Dublin City Council in 1991 and became involved in the running of the Fianna Fáil party. She was elected as national treasurer in 1993. Hanafin is also a former president of the National Youth Council of Ireland.

==Dáil career==
Hanafin was elected to the Dáil on her second attempt, at the 1997 general election for the Dún Laoghaire constituency. In her first few years as a TD she served on a number of Oireachtas committees, including Education and Science, Heritage and the Irish language and Justice, Equality and Women&#x27;s Affairs. In 2000, Hanafin was appointed Minister of State for Children. She topped the poll in her constituency at the 2002 general election and was appointed to the position of Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach; also a junior (non-cabinet) ministry, but with special responsibility as Government Chief Whip. She was the first woman to hold this position.

===Minister for Education and Science===
Hanafin was appointed as Minister for Education and Science in a cabinet reshuffle in September 2004. She abandoned the compilation of school league tables begun by her predecessor Noel Dempsey. She prioritised school bus safety following the death of five schoolgirls near Navan, County Meath, in 2005. This has mandated the provision of one seat per child and of the mandatory use of seatbelts in school buses. In 2005 she initiated vastly increased funding and staffing for children with special needs.
She announced plans for a possible change of entry requirements to third-level medical education.

Hanafin was accused of bias towards private fee-paying schools in her constituency when awarding building grants to them in 2005. Christian Brothers College, Monkstown Park, and St. Andrew&#x27;s College both received building grants for extensions and works on their buildings. Only Belvedere College, Kilkenny College and Loreto Beaufort, Rathfarnham, had previously received money since 1995.

Diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks revealed that in 2005 Hanafin had briefed the American Ambassador to Ireland on government coalition negotiations. She criticized her Green Party coalition colleagues saying that they wanted to prioritize &quot;hares, stags and badgers while everyone else in the country is drowning in this economy&quot;.

In February 2008, it emerged that Hanafin, while Government Chief Whip, had assisted poet Cathal Ó Searcaigh to obtain an Irish visa for a Nepalese youth. The allegations were contained in the documentary &quot;Fairytale of Kathmandu&quot;. Hanafin, who admitted being friends with Ó Searcaigh for many years, dismissed the allegations as an &quot;irresponsible piece of journalism&quot;. Ó Searcaigh was later investigated by Irish authorities to establish whether he should be prosecuted under the Sexual Offences Act for sleeping with boys in Nepal who would be considered under-age in Ireland.

Hanafin was accused in February 2008 of being oblivious to the plight of parents of children with autism, and of taking an imperious view of their parents&#x27; situation, when she decided to engage in a 68-day court battle with two parents who were attempting to obtain appropriate education for their children through the applied behavior analysis (ABA) method. She and her department were accused of ignoring reality of autism education requirements. The mother, Yvonne Ui Cuanachain, said: &quot;Well I would reject the Minister&#x27;s position quite completely and I feel it&#x27;s actually quite cynically misrepresentative of the situation on the ground. The Department of Education does not support ABA, it does not support ABA within the ABA schools and neither does it support ABA within the eclectic classes.&quot;

===Minister for Social and Family Affairs===
On 7 May 2008, Hanafin was appointed as Minister for Social and Family Affairs by new Taoiseach Brian Cowen. She abolished an independent agency, Combat Poverty, by subsuming it into the department.

In late May 2009, a newspaper ran a story claiming Hanafin&#x27;s office had used taxpayer-funded resources to promote Peter O&#x27;Brien in correspondence to voters in the ahead of the 2009 local elections. O&#x27;Brien was not elected at those local elections.

===Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport===
On 23 March 2010, Hanafin was moved from Social and Family Affairs to the Tourism, Culture and Sport portfolio. She appointed a Fianna Fáil councillor and friend of Brian Cowen to the board of the Irish Sports Council on her last full day as Tourism, Culture and Sport Minister.

===Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation===
Following the resignation of Batt O&#x27;Keeffe in January 2011, Hanafin was also appointed as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.

==2011 general election==
On 22 January 2011, after the resignation of Brian Cowen, Hanafin put her name forward as a candidate for leader of Fianna Fáil. She was appointed deputy leader on 31 January 2011. At the 2011 general election she lost her Dáil seat. She briefly withdrew from public life, but in April 2011, the Fianna Fáil National Executive co-opted her as one of the five vice-presidents of the party.

==After national politics==
===Television===
In January 2012, she appeared as a judge on the TG4 television show &quot;An G-Team&quot;. In 2014 Hanafin received a master&#x27;s degree in American Studies at the Clinton Institute in University College Dublin.

===Business interests===
Hanafin is reported to have extensive business interests. In June 2008, it was reported she owned a 15% shareholding in Reservoir Resources, an oil exploration company. In September 2013, it was reported she had bought shares in a company which owns Zaragoza, a Dublin tapas bar.

==Return to politics==
===2014 local elections===
In May 2014, Hanafin lodged nomination papers with Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council to contest the local government elections in the Blackrock area, against the wishes of Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin. Following a three-week campaign—dubbed the &quot;Battle of Blackrock&quot;—she was elected, taking the second out of six seats in the Blackrock local electoral area.

===Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council===
====State pensions and council expenses====
Hanafin said she did not take expenses from Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council, instead she continued to draw her various state pensions accruing from her time as a teacher, TD and Minister. In July 2015, an RTÉ investigative report estimated the state had paid her €520,775 in pension and lump sum payments since 2011. This figure excludes any pension associated with her time as a teacher.

===2016 general election campaign===
In April 2014, Hanafin indicated that she intended to seek the Fianna Fáil nomination in Dún Laoghaire for the next general election. Her fellow councillors Cormac Devlin and Kate Feeney also expressed an interest in seeking the nomination. The contest attracted widespread media attention being dubbed the &quot;Battle of Blackrock II&quot;.

In early September 2015, there was widespread speculation the Fianna Fáil National Constituencies Committee would attempt to exclude Cormac Devlin from the Dún Laoghaire candidate selection convention on the basis of his gender. Following the threat of legal action from Devlin, the party backed down.

Hanafin lost the Dún Laoghaire Fianna Fáil selection convention on 28 September 2015, coming second to Cormac Devlin.

Two days after the selection convention, on 30 September 2015, the National Constituencies Committee of Fianna Fáil, chaired by Michael Moynihan TD, recommended Hanafin be added to the general election ticket in Dún Laoghaire.

In October 2015, it emerged that Hanafin, while Minister for Tourism in 2009, supported potential legislation to introduce a €500 water charge and metering system in July 2010, five months before the bailout.

In January 2016, Hanafin announced she was seeking a place on the Fianna Fáil Front Bench. Micheal Martin refused to be drawn on the issue, instead emphasising a desire to promote a new generation of TDs. Following his rebuff, Hanafin gave a series of interviews which appeared to undermine his authority, in particular she questioned his position on entering coalition government with Fine Gael. Her remarks prompted Mary Cowen, wife of former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, to publicly comment that Micheal Martin should &quot;watch his back&quot; around Hanafin. The spat continued with Hanafin claiming Mary Cowen&#x27;s remarks were inappropriate.

In the 2016 general election Hanafin failed to regain a seat in the Dáil, finishing fifth in the four-seat Dún Laoghaire constituency.

===2019 European Parliament election===
In December 2018, Hanafin announced her intention to seek the Fianna Fáil nomination for the Dublin constituency in the European Parliament. Barry Andrews was selected as the Fianna Fáil candidate.

===2020 general election===
She was an unsuccessful candidate for the Dún Laoghaire constituency at the 2020 general election.

In June 2022, she was elected as Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council. Hanafin did not contest the 2024 Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council election.

<doc id="1027681" wikidata="Q654064" url="?curid=1027681" title="Impatiens walleriana">
<text>Impatiens walleriana (syn. &quot;Impatiens sultanii&quot;), also known as busy Lizzie (British Isles), balsam, sultana, or simply impatiens, is a species of the genus &quot;Impatiens&quot;, native to eastern Africa from Kenya to Mozambique. The Latin specific epithet &quot;walleriana&quot; honours a British missionary, Horace Waller (1833–1896).

==Description==
It is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant growing to tall, with broad lanceolate leaves 3–12 cm long and 2–5 cm broad. Leaves are mostly alternate, although they may be opposite near the top of the plant. The changeable, simple leaves are stalked 1.5 to 6 cm long. The leaf blade is ovate to broadly elliptic, sometimes obovate, 2.5 to 13 inches long and 2 to 5.5 inches wide, green and sometimes spotted or pink or reddish on the underside. Leaflets are missing.

The hermaphroditic, zygomorphic flowers are profusely borne, 2–5 cm diameter, with five petals and a 1 cm spur. The seedpod explodes when ripe in the same manner as other &quot;Impatiens&quot; species, an evolutionary adaptation for seed dispersal. The lower sepals are slightly boat-shaped and narrow suddenly in the 2.8 to 4.5 inches long, thread-like curved, but not curved back spur. The stems are semi-succulent, and all parts of the plant (leaves, stems, flowers, roots) are soft and easily damaged.

==Cultivation==

Although perennial in frost-free growing conditions, it is usually treated as a half-hardy annual in temperate regions (though pot-grown plants can be successfully overwintered indoors). It is one of the most popular of all bedding plants for parks and gardens worldwide, typically grown in containers but also in bedding schemes. Propagation is by seed or stem cuttings (which often root readily in water).

===Cultivars===
Numerous cultivars in a range of colours from white to purple, are widely available commercially, either as seeds or young plants. They include the following:

*Accent series
*&#x27;Blackberry Ice&#x27;
*&#x27;Confection&#x27;
*&#x27;Eclipse&#x27;
*&#x27;Elfin White&#x27;
*&#x27;Extra Dwarf&#x27;
*&#x27;Fiesta Ole&#x27; (double variety)
*&#x27;Lipstick&#x27;
*&#x27;Red Star&#x27;
*Super Elfin series
*Tempo Series
*&#x27;Wink and Blink&#x27;
Super Elfin series was bred by Claude Hope in Costa Rica. Hope developed this species from its native wild form into one of the most popular bedding plants in the world.

===AGM cultivars===
The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:-

<text>Beryl Ingham (1901 – 24 December 1960) was the wife and manager of singer/actor George Formby, as well as being a variety performer and champion clogdancer.

She was born in Haslingden, Lancashire, the youngest daughter of John James Ingham and his wife Elizabeth Ann (&quot;née&quot; Jackson). At the age of 11 she won the All-England Step Dancing Title. Later she formed a dancing act with her sister May, calling themselves The Two Violets.

She met George Formby in 1923, while they were appearing in music hall in Yorkshire. They married in his hometown of Wigan the following year. The couple worked together as a variety act until 1932, when she became his full-time manager and mentor.

In 1934, film producer John E. Blakeley, who had admired their double act, engaged them for work on a low-budget comic movie, &quot;Boots! Boots!&quot;, where Beryl&#x27;s domineering manner on the set was noticed for the first time, especially by the teenage Betty Driver, with whom she feuded. In later films, producer Basil Dean avoided visiting the studio during filming, and director Monty Banks tried to get her banned from the set. She made only two minor appearances in the Formby films.

Beryl was an exceptionally shrewd businesswoman, under whose management George became the UK&#x27;s highest paid entertainer, at up to £35,000 per performance.

The Formbys went on a tour of South Africa in 1946; despite threats from the National Party leader Daniel Malan, George played to black audiences, and Beryl embraced a three-year-old black girl who had presented her with a box of chocolates. Malan had them thrown out of the country and was reported to have told them to &quot;Never come back here again&quot;. Beryl replied &quot;Why don&#x27;t you piss off, you horrible little man?&quot;

She continued to manage George&#x27;s career until she developed leukemia; she died on Christmas Day 1960 in Blackpool. George Formby died ten weeks after his wife.

<doc id="1027695" wikidata="Q105772978" url="?curid=1027695" title="Gambier Terrace">
<text>Gambier Terrace (Liverpool, England) is a street of 19th-century houses overlooking St. James&#x27;s Mount and Gardens and Liverpool Cathedral. It is generally reckoned to be in Canning, although it falls within the Rodney Street conservation area, together with Hope Street and Rodney Street.

It was named after James Gambier. Numbers 1 to 10 are Grade II* Listed Buildings, as is the northernmost house in the terrace, which has the address of Canning St around the corner. They were probably designed by John Foster, Junior. The terrace was built in 1832–1837. It was originally planned that the entire row would be built in a single style but construction was halted in the slump of 1837, and the demand for large city houses declined as the middle class moved out to the new suburbs. Number 10 was the last of the original build. The terrace was later completed to a cheaper specification.

During the First World War Number 1 Gambier Terrace was the location of the Women&#x27;s War Service Bureau which assisted soldiers and their families. The service expanded into 5 additional premises on Bold Street and Berry Street.

In the 1950s and 60s, 11-12 Gambier Terrace was home to the Liverpool Art High School, the junior section of the Liverpool College of Art. The students were aged 13-16 years of age who won scholarships to attend the school. Cynthia Lennon was a student there before she met John Lennon. 

In the 1960s the terrace was in poor condition. John Lennon of The Beatles lived at 3 Gambier Terrace in 1960 with former Beatles bassist Stuart Sutcliffe after Sutcliffe asked the others who lived there, including fellow student and future well-known artist Margaret Chapman if the homeless Lennon could move in. They all attended nearby Liverpool College of Art. The large number of students and artists living there lead to a reporter from &quot;The&quot; &quot;Sunday People&quot; paying a visit for a story headlined &quot;This is the Beatnik Horror&quot;, inadvertently including the first known published photograph of John Lennon. 

Also a student there was Peter Chang, a British artist known for his distinctive jewellery. He later trained as a graphic designer and sculptor at the Liverpool College of Art. He won the Liverpool Senior City Scholarship in 1966 which enabled him to study in Paris at Atelier 17 under S.W. Hayter. From the 1980s onward, he focused on jewellery-making. His collection was featured in Rifat Ozbek’s 1987 fashion show. His work is in collections around the world, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Cooper Hewitt. 

The freehold to the terrace and the garden in front belongs to Liverpool City Council. The land adjacent to Hope Street is maintained, in part, by the City Council and the leaseholders. The exact status of this land is unclear except that it is a public thoroughfare and unadopted by the City Council&#x27;s highways department.

<text>Jan Szczepanik (June 13, 1872 – April 18, 1926) was a Polish inventor, with several hundred patents and over 50 discoveries to his name, many of which are still applied today, especially in the motion picture industry, as well as in photography and television. Some of his concepts helped the future evolution of TV broadcasting, such as the telectroscope (an apparatus for distant reproduction of images and sound using electricity) or the wireless telegraph, which greatly affected the development of telecommunications. He died in Tarnów in the Second Polish Republic.

==Biography==

Szczepanik was born in the Austrian Partition, in the village of Rudniki near Mościska (now Mostyska, Ukraine) but relocated as infant with his mother to Zręcin in the industrial region of Krosno, where he grew up. His birthplace was controlled by Austria-Hungary between 1772–1918 after the partitions of Poland. Szczepanik graduated from a teachers&#x27; college and spent a lot of time reading scientific literature and journals. He moved to Vienna after his attempt to advance the Jacquard loom from France (invented in 1801) was rejected by some local weavers for fear of losing business. His knowledge of fabric however, enabled him to create the first ballistic vest using silk. Spanish king Alfonso XIII (who used it in 1901) awarded him an order for its invention. Szczepanik was granted awards by other royal courts. The Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria relieved him of mandatory military service fascinated with &quot;photosculpture&quot; – known also as &quot;photoplastigraphy&quot; – introduced to him by Szczepanik. It was based on an idea patented in 1859 by François Willème (1830–1905) for producing portrait sculpture using synchronized photo projections. The Emperor gave him a pair of pistols for that as a souvenir.

Before World War I, Szczepanik carried out experiments with photography and image projection, as well as with small format color film. He holds patents for a new weaving method, a system of obtaining tri-color photography rasters, and equipment for sound recording and playback.

Following the discoverer&#x27;s idea, Agfa corporation produced its Agfacolor reversible paper; color films were also made for the first time, projecting 24 frames per second. Szczepanik&#x27;s more significant discoveries also include the colorimeter (a color control tool), an electric rifle, and a color image weaving method, together with the automation of their production.

Szczepanik also worked on a moving wing aircraft, a duplex rotor helicopter, a dirigible, and a submarine. Mark Twain met Szczepanik and described him in two of his articles: &quot;The Austrian Edison keeping school again&quot; (1898) and &quot;From The Times of 1904&quot; (1898).

<text>Sven Anders Gärderud (born 28 August 1946) is a Swedish former track and field athlete, winner of the 3000 m steeplechase event at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.

Gärderud was born to an orienteering competitor, and was an accomplished orienteer himself, winning a team gold medal at the 1977 Swedish Championships. He initially trained in orienteering and changed sports by chance – he was banned from running in the woods in autumn 1961 due to a jaundice epidemic and wandered into an athletic hall.

Gärderud experimented with several events before focusing on the 3000 m steeplechase. His first major competition were the 1968 Summer Olympics, where he was eliminated in the heats of 800 m and 1500 m. In the following years, Gärderud concentrated on the steeplechase, and was already a main favorite at the 1972 Summer Olympics, but, suffering from a cold, he was eliminated in his heat. Gärderud was also eliminated in the heats of the 5000 m at the Olympics, but only seven days later, he set a new 3000 m steeplechase world record at 8:20.8.

At the 1974 European Championships in Rome, Gärderud was beaten by Bronisław Malinowski of Poland, yet next year he broke the 3000 m steeplechase world record three times.

The culmination of Gärderud&#x27;s career was at the 1976 Summer Olympics, where after a stirring contest with Malinowski and Frank Baumgartl, Gärderud won the gold medal in a new world record of 8:08.02. His victory in that event would earn him a share of the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal with cyclist Bernt Johansson.

After retiring from competitions Gärderud worked as a TV commentator of athletics events and as the head coach of the Swedish athletics team. In 1986 he married Annika Johansson.

<text>The Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) was an organisation established in 1939 by Basil Dean and Leslie Henson to provide entertainment for British armed forces personnel during World War II. ENSA operated as part of the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes. In 1946 it was re-named to Combined Services Entertainment (CSE) operating under the Services Sound and Vision Corporation (SSVC), until 2 March 2020, when the SSVC re-branded to the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS), with the CSE likewise re-branding as BFBS Live Events.

The first big wartime variety concert organised by ENSA was broadcast by the BBC to the Empire and local networks from RAF Hendon in north London on 17 October 1939. Among the entertainers appearing on the bill were Adelaide Hall, The Western Brothers and Mantovani. A newsreel of this concert showing Hall singing &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Hang out the Washing on the Siegfried Line&quot; accompanied by Mantovani and His Orchestra exists.

Many members of ENSA later had careers in the entertainment industry after the war, including actors Terry-Thomas, Peter Sellers and Kenneth Connor.

Tap and acrobatic dancer Vivienne Hole, stage name Vivienne Fayre, a civilian aged 19, was the only ENSA member killed in the war. On 23 January 1945 in Normandy, she was being driven between shows as a passenger aboard a truck carrying stage scenery which strayed into a minefield. She was buried with full military honours in Sittard War Cemetery.

==In popular culture==
Despite many extremely talented entertainers working for ENSA, the organisation was necessarily spread thin over the vast area it had to cover. Thus many entertainments were substandard, and the popular translation of the acronym ENSA was &quot;Every Night Something Awful&quot;.

ENSA plays a modest role in the film &quot;Love Story&quot; (1944) in which Margaret Lockwood stars as a concert pianist who makes an ENSA tour to North Africa and the Mediterranean region. The film &quot;Desert Mice&quot; (1959) follows the fictional escapades of an ENSA troop with Sid James assigned to the Afrika Korps.

The only known ENSA theatre to have survived in its original condition is the Garrison Theatre at Hurst Castle in the New Forest National Park. Created by servicemen in 1939, the proscenium arch still bears the badge and grenades of the Royal Artillery, and the curtains still hang from an original galvanised gas pipe. Shows are presented from time to time by the Friends of Hurst Castle.

<text>Shlomo Carlebach (; 14 January 1925 – 20 October 1994), known as Reb Shlomo to his followers, was a rabbi, religious teacher, spiritual leader, composer, and singer dubbed &quot;the singing rabbi&quot; during his lifetime.

Although his roots lay in traditional Orthodox yeshivot, he branched out to create his own style, combining Hasidic Judaism, warmth and personal interaction, public concerts, and song-filled synagogue services. At various times he lived in Manhattan, San Francisco, Toronto and a Moshav he founded, Mevo Modi&#x27;im, Israel. Carlebach is the subject of &quot;Soul Doctor&quot;, a musical that debuted on Broadway in 2013.

Carlebach is considered by many to be the foremost Jewish religious songwriter of the 20th century.

Carlebach was also considered a pioneer of the Baal teshuva movement (&quot;returnees to Judaism&quot;), encouraging disenchanted Jewish youth to re-embrace their heritage, using his special style of enlightened teaching, and his melodies, songs, and highly inspiring story telling. Following his death, numerous accusations of sexual abuse were levied against him, published in &quot;Lilith Magazine&quot;.

==Biography==
Carlebach was descended from old German rabbinical dynasties. The Carlebach family is a Jewish family originally from Germany that settled in several countries. He was born in 1925 in Berlin, where his father, Hartwig Naftali Carlebach (1889–1967), was an Orthodox rabbi. He had a twin brother, Rabbi Eli Chaim Carlebach and a sister, Shulamith Levovitz. His family left Germany in 1931 and lived in Baden bei Wien, Austria and by 1933 in Switzerland.

Carlebach studied at Yeshiva Torah Vodaath and Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn, New York, and Beth Medrash Gevoha in Lakewood, New Jersey. His teachers included rabbis Shlomo Heiman and Aharon Kotler. He was considered one of Kotler&#x27;s best students. During his yeshiva studies he was often asked to lead the services as a hazzan (cantor). He received semikha (rabbinic ordination) from Yitzchak Hutner.

In 1950 Carlebach set up a small Torah learning group called T.S.G.G. (pronounced TASGIG), an acronym for &quot;Taste And See God Is Good&quot;.

That year, Carlebach attended a Hebrew language ulpan class at the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS), where he played hasidic melodies on the piano. Sara Schafler-Kelman heard his singing and invited Carlebach to sing chasidic tunes at the on Convent Avenue. Schafler prepared a poster for the event, entitled &quot;The Place of Music in the Hassidic Tradition&quot;. This was Carlebach&#x27;s first invited performance. Years later, Carlebach said to Schafler-Kelman, &quot;You gave me a title for my life&#x27;s work.&quot;

In 1951, Carlebach began learning English in a special program at Columbia University, having previously spoken mainly Yiddish. Becoming fluent in English only at the age of 26, he developed an unusual grammar, mixing Yiddish and English, that became his hallmark, and later influenced the language of his followers, as well as many other members of the neo-hassidic movement.

Carlebach became a disciple of Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, the sixth rebbe of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. From 1951 to 1954, he worked briefly as one of the first emissaries (&quot;shluchim&quot;) of Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Lubavitcher rebbe, who urged him to use his special skills and go to college campuses to reconnect Jews to Judaism, but would later disapprove of the non-traditional tactics he used. Carlebach left the movement in 1954.

In 1972, he married Elaine Neila Glick, a teacher. They had two daughters, Nedara (Dari) and Neshama. Neshama Carlebach is a songwriter and singer in her own right, incorporating new adaptations of her father’s melodies.

==Music career==

Carlebach began writing songs at the end of the 1950s, primarily based on verses from the Tanakh or the Siddur set to his own music. Although he composed thousands of songs, he could not read musical notes. Many of his soulful renderings of Torah verses became standards in the wider Jewish community, including &quot;Am Yisrael Chai&quot; (&quot;[The] Nation [of] Israel Lives&quot;—composed on behalf of the plight of Soviet Jewry in the mid-1960s), &quot;Pitchu Li&quot; (&quot;Open [for] Me [the Gates of Righteousness]&quot;) and &quot;Borchi Nafshi&quot; (&quot;[May] My Soul Bless [God]&quot;). Carlebach was recording well before this and was invited to the festival by one of its organizers after she heard a recording of Carlebach.

In 1954, the Atlanta Southern Israelite reported that Carlebach was named as the technical advisor for a production of &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;. Carlebach was to advise on the music used in the theatrical production.

He became known as &quot;The Singing Rabbi&quot;.

Some Carlebach melodies were entered in Israel&#x27;s annual Hasidic Song Festival.
In 1969, his song &quot;Ve&#x27;haer Eneinu&quot;, sung by the Shlosharim won third prize. The Hasidic festivals were a yearly event that helped to popularize his music. He also produced albums with a more liturgical sound. Some of the musicians he worked with during this period added a psychedelic tinge and a wider range of backup instrumentation. Carlebach now spent much of his time in Israel, living in Moshav Me&#x27;or Modi&#x27;im.

Carlebach&#x27;s songs were characterized by relatively short melodies and traditional lyrics. His new tunes were easy to learn and became part of the prayer services in many synagogues around the world.

Carlebach returned to New York City, where as part of his performances he spoke of inspirational subjects rooted in Hasidism and Kabbalah. Some of his teachings have been published by his students and appear alongside his recorded songs. Carlebach spread the teachings of Peshischa, Chabad, and Breslov, and popularized the writings of, among others, the rebbe of Ishbitz, Mordechai Yosef Leiner, and rebbe Kalonymus Kalman Shapira of Piasetzno.

Carlebach became the rabbi of the Carlebach Shul on West 79th Street. He continued to perform regularly at concerts, and to record various albums of his original melodies.

On February 27, 2022, Carlebach was posthumously inducted with the inaugural class of the Jewish Music Hall of Fame.

==Death and legacy==
Carlebach died of a heart attack on his way to Canada while the plane was still on the ground at LaGuardia Airport in New York. The Hebrew date was 16 Cheshvan 5755. His body was flown to Israel for burial at Har HaMenuchot. During the funeral the mourners sang Carlebach&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Chasdei Hashem Ki Lo Samnu&quot;. Israel&#x27;s Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau gave a eulogy. An annual memorial service is held at his grave on the 16th of Cheshvan. Additional memorial events take place throughout Israel and around the world.

According to Rabbi Jonathan Rosenblatt, Carlebach &quot;changed the expectations of the prayer experience from decorous and sombre to uplifting and ecstatic as he captivated generations with elemental melodies and stories of miraculous human saintliness, modesty and unselfishness.&quot;

Since his death, Carlebach&#x27;s music has been incorporated in the services of many synagogues, some of which conduct Carlebach minyanim. 

A musical written about his life, &quot;Soul Doctor&quot;, by Daniel Wise was presented off-Broadway in 2008 and New Orleans in 2010, and was received with critical acclaim. The musical had a brief off-Broadway run as a guest attraction at New York Theatre Workshop in the Summer of 2012, and earned Eric Anderson a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical nomination for his portrayal of Shlomo Carlebach. &quot;Soul Doctor&quot; opened on Broadway August 15, 2013.

A documentary film about Carlebach directed by Boaz Shahak, &quot;You Never Know&quot;, was released at the Jerusalem Film Festival in 2008.

&quot;The Torah Commentary of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach&quot; is a series of books based on his teachings.

The Shlomo Carlebach Foundation was established to preserve and disseminate the teachings, music, and stories of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, and to develop communities that will share the love and joy which he radiated.

==Controversy and accusations of sexual abuse==
Carlebach&#x27;s approach towards &quot;kiruv&quot; (the popular Hebrew term for Orthodox Jewish outreach) was often tinged with controversy. Put most favorably, &quot;He operated outside traditional Jewish structures in style and substance, and spoke about God and His love in a way that could make other rabbis uncomfortable.&quot;

After his death, &quot;Lilith&quot; magazine, a Jewish feminist publication, catalogued stories in which he was named as a sexual abuser by those who had come forward. Specifically, named accusers are quoted in this article, as well as unnamed sources and Jewish communal leaders with knowledge of the stories of harm. Even in his lifetime, Carlebach was approached about these matters. &quot;Lilith&quot; reports that people present when he was confronted say he acknowledged that he caused harm, expressed regret, and agreed that his behavior needed to change. The article indicates that most in Carlebach&#x27;s circles were uncomfortable voicing their accusations at the time, leading to a widespread policy of &quot;silence&quot; which had, in part, enabled his continued offenses.

Since his death, many others have come forward with additional stories about how Carlebach solicited them, touched them during dancing, or on private walks. Some of the stories of harm were toward young women, teenagers in camps or youth group retreats. Some of the older people who came forward point out that they were approached by him at a time in their lives when they were particularly vulnerable, as many of them were transitioning into Jewish life and practice, and as such undergoing large changes in their lives. As their sole spiritual leader at the time, Carlebach held a lot of potential power over them. Most of his offenses were unexpected and undesired touching, or telephone calls &quot;in the middle of the night&quot;, which his accusers describe as disturbing, but also as odd. The &quot;Lilith&quot; article says that for many, his legacy is mixed. Even many of his victims state that he still had great positive impact on their lives, despite the irreparable hurt he caused -- and that, had his problem been more public, and more help been available to him, it is possible he would have willingly sought it.

His disciples reject these accusations and say that it is unfair to accuse him after his death. However, accusations had already been made as early as the 1970s. Especially in light of the #metoo movement some have begun to question whether Jewish communities should still use his music. In January 2018 his daughter Neshama wrote an open letter to the women who were harmed by Carlebach. She wrote &quot;I accept the fullness of who my father was, flaws and all. I am angry with him. And I refuse to see his faults as the totality of who he was.&quot;

<text>Fluoride toxicity is a condition in which there are elevated levels of the fluoride ion in the body. Although fluoride is safe for dental health at low concentrations, sustained consumption of large amounts of soluble fluoride salts is dangerous. Referring to a common salt of fluoride, sodium fluoride (NaF), the lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10 g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64 mg elemental fluoride/kg body weight). Ingestion of fluoride can produce gastrointestinal discomfort at doses at least 15 to 20 times lower (0.2–0.3 mg/kg or 10 to 15 mg for a 50 kg person) than lethal doses. Although it is helpful topically for dental health in low dosage, chronic ingestion of fluoride in large amounts interferes with bone formation. In this way, the most widespread examples of fluoride poisoning arise from consumption of ground water that is abnormally fluoride-rich.

== Recommended levels ==
For optimal dental health, the World Health Organization recommends a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L (milligrams per liter), depending on climate. Fluorosis becomes possible above this recommended dosage. As of 2015, the United States Health and Human Services Department recommends a maximum of 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water – updating and replacing the previous recommended range of 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams issued in 1962. The new recommended level is intended to reduce the occurrence of dental fluorosis while maintaining water fluoridation.

== Toxicity ==

=== Chronic ===
In India an estimated 60 million people have been poisoned by well water contaminated by excessive fluoride, which is dissolved from the granite rocks. The effects are particularly evident in the bone deformities of children. Similar or larger problems are anticipated in other countries including China, Uzbekistan, and Ethiopia.

=== Acute ===
Historically, most cases of acute fluoride toxicity have followed accidental ingestion of sodium fluoride based insecticides or rodenticides. Currently, in advanced countries, most cases of fluoride exposure are due to the ingestion of dental fluoride products. Other sources include glass-etching or chrome-cleaning agents like ammonium bifluoride or hydrofluoric acid, industrial exposure to fluxes used to promote the flow of a molten metal on a solid surface, volcanic ejecta (for example, in cattle grazing after an 1845–1846 eruption of Hekla and the 1783–1784 flood basalt eruption of Laki), and metal cleaners. Malfunction of water fluoridation equipment has happened several times, including a notable incident in Alaska.

== Occurrence ==

=== Organofluorine compounds ===
Twenty percent of modern pharmaceuticals contain fluorine. These organofluorine compounds are not sources of fluoride poisoning, as the carbon–fluorine bond is too strong to release fluoride.

==== Fluoride in toothpaste ====
Children may experience gastrointestinal distress upon ingesting excessive amounts of flavored toothpaste. Between 1990 and 1994, over 628 people, mostly children were treated after ingesting too much fluoride-containing toothpaste. &quot;While the outcomes were generally not serious,&quot; gastrointestinal symptoms appear to be the most common problem reported. However given the low concentration of fluoride in dental products, this is potentially due to the consumption of other major components.

==== Fluoride in drinking water ====
Around one-third of the world&#x27;s population drinks water from groundwater resources. Of this, about 10 percent, approximately 300 million people, obtains water from groundwater resources that are heavily contaminated with arsenic or fluoride. These trace elements derive mainly from leaching of minerals. Maps are available for locations of potential problematic wells via the Groundwater Assessment Platform (GAP).

== Effects ==
Excess fluoride consumption has been studied as a factor in the following:

=== Brain ===
Some research has suggested that high levels of fluoride exposure may adversely affect neurodevelopment in children, but the evidence is of insufficient quality to allow any firm conclusions to be drawn.

In 2024, a U.S. government study released by HHS found higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 mg/L (which is the recommended safe limit set by the WHO), are associated with lower IQ in children. The associated meta-analysis was published in 2025. It reports a null association when concentration is less than 1.5 mg/L. Among studies that reported IQ-point differences, each additional 1 mg/L in urinary fluoride concentration was associated with a 1.63 point decrease in IQ (1.14 points if only low risk-of-bias studies are used).

=== Bones ===

Whilst fluoridated water is associated with decreased levels of fractures in a population, toxic levels of fluoride have been associated with a weakening of bones and an increase in hip and wrist fractures. The U.S. National Research Council concludes that fractures with fluoride levels 1–4 mg/L, suggesting a dose-response relationship, but states that there is &quot;suggestive but inadequate for drawing firm conclusions about the risk or safety of exposures at [2 mg/L]&quot;.

Consumption of fluoride at levels beyond those used in fluoridated water for a long period of time causes skeletal fluorosis. In some areas, particularly the Asian subcontinent, skeletal fluorosis is endemic. It is known to cause irritable-bowel symptoms and joint pain. Early stages are not clinically obvious, and may be misdiagnosed as (seronegative) rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis.

=== Kidney ===
Fluoride induced nephrotoxicity is kidney injury due to toxic levels of serum fluoride, commonly due to release of fluoride from fluorine-containing drugs, such as methoxyflurane.

Within the recommended dose, no effects are expected, but chronic ingestion in excess of 12 mg/day are expected to cause adverse effects, and an intake that high is possible when fluoride levels are around 4 mg/L. Those with impaired kidney function are more susceptible to adverse effects.

The kidney injury is characterised by failure to concentrate urine, leading to polyuria, and subsequent dehydration with hypernatremia and hyperosmolarity. Inorganic fluoride inhibits adenylate cyclase activity required for antidiuretic hormone effect on the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. Fluoride also stimulates intrarenal vasodilation, leading to increased medullary blood flow, which interferes with the counter current mechanism in the kidney required for concentration of urine.

Fluoride induced nephrotoxicity is dose dependent, typically requiring serum fluoride levels exceeding 50 micromoles per liter (about 1 ppm) to cause clinically significant renal dysfunction, which is likely when the dose of methoxyflurane exceeds 2.5 MAC hours. (Note: &quot;MAC hour&quot; is the multiple of the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of the anesthetic used times the number of hours the drug is administered, a measure of the dosage of inhaled anesthetics.)

Elimination of fluoride depends on glomerular filtration rate. Thus, patients with chronic kidney disease will maintain serum fluoride for longer period of time, leading to increased risk of fluoride induced nephrotoxicity.

=== Teeth ===

The only generally accepted adverse effect of fluoride at levels used for water fluoridation is dental fluorosis, which can alter the appearance of children&#x27;s teeth during tooth development; this is mostly mild and usually only an aesthetic concern. Compared to unfluoridated water, fluoridation to 1 mg/L is estimated to cause fluorosis in one of every 6 people (range 4–21), and to cause fluorosis of aesthetic concern in one of every 22 people (range 13.6–∞).

=== Thyroid ===
Fluoride&#x27;s suppressive effect on the thyroid is more severe when iodine is deficient, and fluoride is associated with lower levels of iodine. Thyroid effects in humans were associated with fluoride levels 0.05–0.13 mg/kg/day when iodine intake was adequate and 0.01–0.03 mg/kg/day when iodine intake was inadequate. Its mechanisms and effects on the endocrine system remain unclear.

Testing on mice shows that the medication gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) can be used to treat fluoride toxicity of the thyroid and return normal function.

=== Effects on aquatic organisms ===
Fluoride accumulates in the bone tissues of fish and in the exoskeleton of aquatic invertebrates. The mechanism of fluoride toxicity in aquatic organisms is believed to involve the action of fluoride ions as enzymatic poisons. In soft waters with low ionic content, invertebrates and fishes may develop adverse effects from fluoride concentration as low as 0.5 mg/L. Negative effects are less in hard waters and seawaters, as the bioavailability of fluoride ions is reduced with increasing water hardness Seawater contains fluoride at a concentration of 1.3 mg/L.

== Mechanism ==
Like most soluble materials, fluoride compounds are readily absorbed by the stomach and intestines, and excreted through the urine. Urine tests have been used to ascertain rates of excretion in order to set upper limits in exposure to fluoride compounds and associated detrimental health effects. Ingested fluoride initially acts locally on the intestinal mucosa, where it forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach.

<doc id="1027738" wikidata="Q721275" url="?curid=1027738" title="James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier, (13 October 1756 – 19 April 1833) was a Royal Navy officer. After seeing action at the capture of Charleston during the American Revolutionary War, he saw action again, as captain of the third-rate , at the battle of the Glorious First of June in 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, gaining the distinction of commanding the first ship to break through the enemy line.

Gambier went on to be a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty and First Naval Lord and then served as Governor of Newfoundland. Together with General Lord Cathcart, he oversaw the bombardment of Copenhagen during the Napoleonic Wars. He later survived an accusation of cowardice for his inaction at the Battle of the Basque Roads.

==Early career==
Born the second son of John Gambier, the Lieutenant Governor of the Bahamas and Bermudian Deborah Stiles, Gambier was brought up in England by his aunt, Margaret Gambier, and her husband, Admiral Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham. He was a nephew of Vice-Admiral James Gambier and of Admiral Lord Barham and became an uncle of the novelist and travel writer Georgiana Chatterton.
Gambier entered the Navy in 1767 as a midshipman on board the third-rate , commanded by his uncle, which was serving as a guardship in the Medway, and followed him to serve on board the 60-gun fourth-rate in 1769 where he served on the North American Station. He transferred to the 50-gun fourth-rate under Rear Admiral Parry, in 1772, in the Leeward Islands. Gambier was placed on the sloop and was then posted to England to serve on the 74-gun third-rate , a guardship at Spithead. He was commissioned as a lieutenant on 12 February 1777, in which rank he served successively in the sloop , the 24-gun frigate , the third-rate under Vice-Admiral Lord Shuldham, and then in under his uncle&#x27;s flag. Lord Howe promoted Gambier to commander on 9 March 1778 and gave him command of the bomb ship , which was promptly dismasted and surrendered to the French. He was taken prisoner for a short period and, after having been exchanged, he was made a post captain on 9 October 1778 and appointed to the 32-gun fifth-rate HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot; and saw action at the capture of Charleston in May 1780 during the American Revolutionary War. He was appointed commander of fifth-rate , cruising in British waters, later in the year. In 1783, at the end of the War, he was placed on half-pay.

In February 1793 following the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, Gambier was appointed to command the 74-gun third-rate under Lord Howe. By faith an evangelical, he was regarded as an intensely religious man, nicknamed &quot;Dismal Jimmy&quot;, by the men under his command. As captain of the &quot;Defence&quot; Gambier saw action at the battle of the Glorious First of June in 1794, gaining the distinction of commanding the first ship to break through the enemy line and subsequently receiving the Naval Gold Medal.

==Senior command==
Gambier was appointed to the Board of Admiralty led by Earl Spencer in March 1795. Promoted to rear-admiral on 1 June 1795, he became First Naval Lord in November 1795. Promoted to vice-admiral on 14 February 1799, Gambier left the Admiralty after the fall of the first Pitt ministry in February 1801 and became third-in-command of the Channel Fleet under Admiral William Cornwallis, with his flag in the 98-gun second-rate . He went on to be governor and commander-in-chief of Newfoundland Station in March 1802. In that capacity he gave property rights over arable land to local people allowing them to graze sheep and cattle there and also ensured that vacant properties along the shore could be leased to local people. It was around that time that he also bought Iver Grove in Buckinghamshire.

Gambier then returned to the Admiralty as a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty and First Naval Lord on the Admiralty Board led by Viscount Melville when the second Pitt ministry was formed in May 1804. Promoted to full admiral on 9 November 1805, Gambier left the Admiralty in February 1806. He returned briefly for a third tour as First Naval Lord on the Admiralty Board led by Lord Mulgrave when the Second Portland Ministry was formed in April 1807.

In May 1807 Gambier volunteered to command the naval forces, with his flag in the second-rate HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, sent as part of the campaign against Copenhagen during the Napoleonic Wars. Together with General Lord Cathcart, he oversaw the bombardment of Copenhagen from 2 September until the Danes capitulated after three days (an incident that brought Gambier some notoriety in that the assault included a bombardment of the civilian quarter). Prizes included eighteen ships of the line, twenty-one frigates and brigs and twenty-five gunboats together with a large quantity of naval stores for which he received official thanks from Parliament, and on 3 November 1807 a peerage, becoming Baron Gambier, of Iver in the County of Buckingham.

==Battle of the Basque Roads==


In 1808 Gambier was appointed to command the Channel Fleet. In April 1809 he chased a squadron of French ships that had escaped from Brest into the Basque Roads. He called a council of war in which Lord Cochrane was given command of the inshore squadron, and who subsequently led the attack. Gambier refused to commit the Channel Fleet after Cochrane&#x27;s attack, using explosion vessels that encouraged the French squadron to warp further into the shallows of the estuary. This action resulted in the majority of the French fleet running aground at Rochefort.
Gambier was content with the blockading role played by the offshore squadron. Admiral Sir Eliab Harvey, who had commanded &quot;Fighting Temeraire&quot; at the Battle of Trafalgar, believed they had missed an opportunity to inflict further damage upon the French fleet. He told Gambier &quot;I never saw a man so unfit for the command of a fleet as Your Lordship.&quot; Cochrane threatened to use his parliamentary vote against Gambier in retaliation for not committing the fleet to action. Gambier called for a court martial to examine his conduct. The court martial, on 26 July 1809 on &quot;Gladiator&quot; in Portsmouth, exonerated Gambier. Consequently, neither Harvey nor Cochrane were appointed by the Admiralty to command for the remainder of the war. The episode had political and personal overtones. Gambier was connected by family and politics to the Tory prime minister William Pitt. In Parliament, Cochrane represented the constituency of Westminster, which tended to vote Radical. In the aftermath of Basque Roads, Cochrane and Gambier quarreled and Gambier excluded Cochrane from the battle dispatches. Cochrane took the unusual move of standing in opposition to parliament&#x27;s pro forma vote of thanks to Gambier.

==Later career==
In 1814 Gambier was part of the team negotiating the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States. He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 7 June 1815. Promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 22 July 1830, he died at his home, Iver Grove in Buckinghamshire, on 19 April 1833 and was buried at St. Peter&#x27;s churchyard in Iver.

==Legacy==
Gambier was a founding benefactor of Kenyon College in the United States, and the town that was founded with it, Gambier, Ohio, is named after him, as is Mount Gambier, the city and dormant volcano in South Australia, and Gambier Island in British Columbia, as well as the Gambier Islands in French Polynesia. Gambier appears as a minor character near the end of &quot;Flying Colours&quot;, a 1938 Horatio Hornblower novel by C. S. Forester.

==Personal life==
In July 1788 Gambier married Louisa Mathew, daughter of Daniel Mathew, 1718–1777, of Felix Hall, Kelvedon, Essex and St Kitts, West Indies, and Mary Elizabeth Byam, 1729–1814; they had no children.

<text>Thomas Ernest Hulme (; 16 September 1883 – 28 September 1917) was an English critic and poet who, through his writings on art, literature and politics, had a notable influence upon modernism. He was an aesthetic philosopher and the &#x27;father of imagism&#x27;.

==Early life and education==
Thomas Ernest Hulme — called &quot;Ernest&quot; by his family — was born at Gratton Hall, Endon, Staffordshire, the son of Thomas Hulme and Mary, née Young. Thomas attempted farming, but &quot;the life proved too strenuous&quot; for him; when his son was still young the family relocated to a house on Endon Bank, and Thomas went into business for a time as an auctioneer and sales agent before starting up a ceramics transfer business operating from a factory in Newcastle-under-Lyme. Thomas was &quot;a remote and hard man&quot; with an &quot;explosive temper&quot;, but it was Mary Hulme that was &quot;the disciplinarian in the family... a spirited, independent woman with a good sense of humour and a command of repartee.&quot; Thomas Hulme&#x27;s father, also Thomas, who lived at nearby Dunwood Hall, was a successful pawnbroker whose death in 1884 &quot;left his family well provided for&quot;. The Hulmes were wealthy; they &quot;had chauffeurs and gardeners at Endon Bank, but the family had regional accents rather than Oxbridge accents and there was more social mixing across the classes than was common in the cities.&quot;

Hulme was educated at Newcastle-under-Lyme High School and, from 1902, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he read mathematics, but was sent down in 1904 after rowdy behaviour on Boat Race night. He was thrown out of Cambridge a second time after a scandal involving a Roedean girl. He returned to his studies at University College London, before travelling around Canada and spending time in Brussels acquiring languages.

==Proto-modernist==
From about 1907 Hulme became interested in philosophy, translating works by Henri Bergson and sitting in on lectures at Cambridge. He translated Georges Sorel&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on Violence&quot;. The most important influences on his thought were Bergson, who asserted that &#x27;human experience is relative, but religious and ethical values are absolute&#x27; and, later, Wilhelm Worringer (1881–1965), German art historian and critic – in particular his &quot;Abstraktion und Einfühlung&quot; (&quot;Abstraction and Empathy&quot;, 1908). Hulme was influenced by Remy de Gourmont&#x27;s aristocratic concept of art and his studies of sensibility and style. From 1909 Hulme contributed critical articles to &quot;The New Age&quot;, edited by A. R. Orage.
Hulme developed an interest in poetry and wrote a small number of poems. He was made secretary of the Poets&#x27; Club, attended by such establishment figures as Edmund Gosse and Henry Newbolt. There he encountered Ezra Pound and F. S. Flint. In late 1908 Hulme delivered his paper &quot;A Lecture on Modern Poetry&quot; to the club. Hulme&#x27;s poems &quot;Autumn&quot; and &quot;A City Sunset&quot;, both published in 1909 in a Poets&#x27; Club anthology, have the distinction of being the first Imagist poems. A further five poems were published in &quot;The New Age&quot; in 1912 as &quot;The Complete Poetical Works of T. E. Hulme&quot;. Despite this misleading title, Hulme in fact wrote about 25 poems totalling some 260 lines, of which the majority were possibly written between 1908 and 1910. Robert Frost met Hulme in 1913 and was influenced by his ideas. The publisher of the book &#x27;Ripostes&#x27; (to which Pound appended the &#x27;complete&#x27; poetical works of T. E. Hulme) spoke in that book of Hulme &#x27;the meta-physician, who achieves great rhythmical beauty in curious verse-forms.&#x27;

In his critical writings Hulme distinguished between Romanticism, a style informed by a belief in the infinite in man and nature, characterised by Hulme as &quot;spilt religion&quot;, and Classicism, a mode of art stressing human finitude, formal restraint, concrete imagery and, in Hulme&#x27;s words, &quot;dry hardness&quot;. Similar views were later expressed by T. S. Eliot. Hulme&#x27;s ides had a major effect on Wyndham Lewis and for a time the two were friends, later coming to blows over Kate Lechmere, Lewis coming off the worse during this encounter which ended when Hulme hung Lewis upside down by the cuffs of his trousers from the railings of Great Ormond Street. He championed the art of Jacob Epstein and David Bomberg, was a friend of Gaudier-Brzeska, and was in on the debut of Lewis&#x27;s literary magazine &quot;BLAST&quot; and vorticism.

Hulme&#x27;s politics were conservative, and he moved further to the right after 1911 as a result of contact with Pierre Lasserre, who was associated with &quot;Action Française&quot;.

==First World War==

Hulme volunteered as an artilleryman in 1914 and served with the Honourable Artillery Company and later the Royal Marine Artillery in France and Belgium. He kept up his writing for &quot;The New Age&quot;. Notable publications during this period for that magazine were &quot;War Notes&quot;, written under the pen name &quot;North Staffs&quot;, and &quot;A Notebook&quot;, which contains some of his most organised critical writing. He was wounded in 1916. Back at the front in 1917, he was killed by a shell at Oostduinkerke near Nieuwpoort, in West Flanders.

[...] On 28 September 1917, four days after his thirty-fourth birthday, Hulme suffered a direct hit from a large shell which literally blew him to pieces. Apparently absorbed in some thought of his own he had failed to hear it coming and remained standing while those around threw themselves flat on the ground. What was left of him was buried in the Military Cemetery at Koksijde, West-Vlaanderen, in Belgium where—no doubt for want of space—he is described simply as &#x27;One of the War poets&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Washington Park is a public park in Seattle, Washington, United States, most of which is taken up by the Washington Park Arboretum, a joint project of the University of Washington, the Seattle Parks and Recreation, and the nonprofit Arboretum Foundation. Washington Park also includes a playfield and the Seattle Japanese Garden in its southwest corner. To the north is Union Bay; to the west are Montlake and Madison Valley; to the south is the Washington Park neighborhood; and to the east is the Broadmoor Golf Club.

== Description ==
Lake Washington Boulevard E. runs north and south through the park, parallel to the creek. A secondary road, for most of its length named Arboretum Drive E. and for a short northern stretch named E. Foster Island Road, runs along the Arboretum&#x27;s eastern edge. E. Interlaken Boulevard and Boyer Avenue E. run northwest out of the park to Montlake and beyond. State Route 520 cuts through Foster Island and the Union Bay wetlands at the park&#x27;s northern end, interchanging with Lake Washington Boulevard just outside the arboretum entrance. A footpath winds underneath the freeway overpasses and over boardwalks, along the Lake Washington ship canal, and into the gardens of the Arboretum.

The Arboretum is well known for Azalea Way in the springtime, a stretch of the park which offers a unique tapestry of azaleas of many colors. The area is a popular site for strolling and is utilized by photographers and artists. The manicured Azalea Way stands out in stark contrast with the Arboretum&#x27;s wild and heavily canopied areas.

The land occupied by the Washington Park Arboretum has been developed and is owned by the city, but the Arboretum is operated primarily by the University of Washington.

Arboretum Creek is approximately long, entirely within the park. Its average channel width is and its average channel depth is . The creek&#x27;s source is a spring-fed stream in the Alder Creek Natural Area, three publicly owned properties on 26th Ave East between East Helen and Prospect streets. The stream feeds the koi pond in Washington Park&#x27;s Japanese Garden, near Washington Park Playfield at the park&#x27;s southern end. It also receives runoff from Rhododendron Glen and the Woodland Garden, as well as sub-surface drainage from the neighboring course of the Broadmoor Golf Club. It empties into Lake Washington via Willow Bay, itself a minor arm of Union Bay, having passed through numerous culverts under Lake Washington Boulevard.

==History==

Prior to colonization, the area which would become Washington Park was home to the Duwamish people. They called it &quot;Sxwacugwit,&quot; meaning &quot;portage&quot; or &quot;narrow passage&quot; due to its strategic importance as a transportation link between the coast and the inland river systems which fed into Lake Washington. The Duwamish village of Slalal stood east of the mouth of Arboretum Creek. Under the Treaty of Point Elliott the land was opened to white settlement in 1855.

In the 19th century, the land was purchased from the federal government by Fred Drew, a timber surveyor working for the Puget Mill Company. The old-growth forest was logged in the 1880s and 1890s, after which the company planned to develop the land. However, these plans were halted by the Panic of 1893. The City of Seattle Parks Commission acquired the property in 1900, and contracted the Olmsted Brothers landscaping firm to design the park. Lake Washington Boulevard was built in 1903 and a speedway for horse racing was built.

The area remained largely undeveloped until 1920, when the parcel was split in two. The eastern 200 acres (0.8 km2) were developed as the Broadmoor Golf Club by a group of businessmen that included E. G. Ames, general manager of Puget Mill. The western 230 acres were given to the city, who developed a park and arboretum on the site. On the basis of the agreement approved by the University of Washington (Board of Regents) and the City of Seattle (City Council/Mayor), The Washington Park Arboretum was established in 1934. The former horse racing track was converted into a pedestrian path called Azalea Way. 

During the Great Depression many improvements to the park were made by Works Progress Administration crews, who built drainage infrastructure and fences, cleared land, planted plants, and built a number of park buildings. Eleanor Roosevelt visited the park in 1938 and planted an elm tree.

The Japanese Garden was opened in June 1960. The original teahouse was destroyed by arson in April 1973, and a replacement was opened in March 1981. Some WPA-era maintenance buildings were replaced by the current visitor&#x27;s center, which opened in 1985 on the 50th anniversary of the Arboretum Foundation.

== SR 520 Highway impacts ==

=== Ghost ramps ===
State Route 520 had a set of ghost ramps in the marshlands the arboretum. They were built in 1962 as part of a future plan to build the R. H. Thomson Expressway, which would have cut through the arboretum and down through Seattle towards the I-90/I-5 interchange. Citizens rallied a freeway revolt against the plan on May 4, 1969. Construction near the Arboretum later continued, but citizen protest eventually won out and the plan was dropped in 1971. One ramp was used for the on-ramp from Lake Washington Boulevard to SR 520 Eastbound, while the others remained unused and became known locally as &quot;ramps to nowhere&quot;. 

The freeway revolt that stopped the R. H. Thomson Expressway had its origins in opposition to SR 520 itself. Architect Victor Steinbrueck, writing in 1962, objected to the &quot;naked brutality of unimaginative structures such as this proposed crossing of Portage Bay, which eliminates fifty houseboats while casting its shadow and noise across this tranquil boat haven.&quot;

In 2013 the Washington State Department of Transportation announced plans to dismantle the ghost ramps. To commemorate the ramps and protest their demolition, a local art collective created an installation, &quot;Gate to Nowhere&quot;, on one of the ramps in 2014. The piece consisted of a layer of reflective acrylic wrapping a pair of support columns. 

The ghost ramp removal work began in the spring of 2016 as part of the 520 Bridge Replacement Project. They were mostly removed by 2017, though one section was kept as parking for contractors working on the new floating bridge. The final section was removed in 2024, with the exception of a single bridge support consisting of four columns and a support beam. This was allowed to remain as a historical monument in commemoration of the ghost ramps and the freeway revolt.

=== Bridge Replacement Project ===

The potential impact of plans to reconstruct and expand State Route 520 and replace the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge in the early 2010s raised concerns among Arboretum staff and park users. As the members of the Arboretum community noted in their collective letter to the Washington State Department of Transportation, &quot;Native plants, wetlands, and wildlife ... would be affected not only by the taking of land but by the looming shadows created by roadways in various proposals&quot;. Among the alternative proposals was the &quot;Arboretum Bypass Plan,&quot; to build the new elevated highway over Union Bay on a more northerly route than the then-existing one. Although the final alignment of the new bridge was 35 feet north of the previous bridge, it did not go over Union Bay.

The bridge replacement project included a number of measures to reduce or mitigate ecological impact as well as some improvements to the arboretum. Eight ecological restoration projects were completed using bridge replacement funding, both in the vicinity of the bridge and around the Puget Sound region. Park improvements included a new multiuse trail from East Madison Street to Montlake and the University District and a pedestrian undercrossing on Foster Island.

== Seattle Japanese Garden ==

The Seattle Japanese Garden is a 3.5 acre (14,000 m2) Japanese garden in the Madison Park neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. The Garden is located in the Southern end of the Washington Park Arboretum on Lake Washington Boulevard East. The Garden is one of the oldest Japanese Gardens in North America, and is regarded as one of the most authentic Japanese Gardens in the United States.

<text>John Henry Towers CBE (January 30, 1885 – April 30, 1955) was a highly decorated United States Navy four-star admiral and pioneer naval aviator. He made important contributions to the technical and organizational development of naval aviation from its beginnings, eventually serving as Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics (1939–1942). He commanded carrier task forces during World War II, and retired in December 1947. He and Marc Mitscher were the only early Naval Aviation pioneers to survive the hazards of early flight to remain with naval aviation throughout their careers. Towers spent his last years supporting aeronautical research and advising the aviation industry.

==Early life and career==

John H. Towers was born on 30 January 1885 at Rome, Georgia, son of William Magee and Mary (Norton) Towers. He completed public school in Rome and entered the Georgia School of Technology at Atlanta, where he completed one year in civil engineering course, before received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1902. While at the academy, Towers was nicknamed &quot;Hattie&quot; and reached the rank of cadet petty officer 1st class.

Among his classmates were many future admirals including Roland M. Brainard, Arthur L. Bristol, William L. Calhoun, Milo F. Draemel, Robert L. Ghormley, William A. Glassford, Charles C. Hartigan, Aubrey W. Fitch, Frank J. Fletcher, Isaac C. Kidd, John S. McCain Sr., Leigh Noyes, Ferdinand L. Reichmuth, Sherwoode A. Taffinder, Russell Willson, and Thomas Withers.

He graduated with Bachelor of Science degree on 12 February 1906 and was attached as passed midshipman to the battleship . Towers then took part in the cruise around the world with Great White Fleet and also served in the Cuban waters during the Second Occupation of Cuba. After the two years at sea, then required by law, he was commissioned ensign on 13 February 1908 while still aboard &quot;Kentucky&quot;.

Towers was transferred to New York Shipbuilding Corporation for duty in connection with fitting out of the first United States dreadnought battleship, , in September 1909 and upon her commissioning in January 1910, he served as fire control officer and spotter. During his tenure in this capacity, he became interested in aviation, which was motivated by recognition that higher elevation observation was required to observe fall of shot at the range of modern naval artillery. Towers requested aviation training in November 1910; but his proficiency at gunfire spotting was considered essential to &quot;Michigan&quot;″s mission when Glenn Curtis offered to train a naval officer to fly the following month, so Theodore G. Ellyson became the first United States naval aviator. Only after Curtiss moved his flying school from San Diego to the east coast was Tower released from &quot;Michigan&quot; to report to the Curtiss Flying School in Hammondsport, New York, on June 27, 1911, for aviation training.

===Pioneer naval aviator===
Under the tutelage of aviation pioneers Curtiss and Ellyson, Towers qualified as a pilot with the Aero Club of America on 13 September 1911, flying the Navy&#x27;s first airplane, a Curtiss A-1 seaplane. In Sept 1911 Towers and Ellyson created the first official Naval Air Station and flying aviation unit at Greenbury Point, Md across the Severn River from the Naval Academy under orders from Captain Washington Irving Chambers, the first Navy officer assigned to development of the nascent U.S. Naval aviation program.

In October 1911, Towers achieved a distance record, flying an A-1 from Annapolis, Maryland, to Old Point Comfort, Virginia, a distance of 112 miles in 122 minutes. He set several speed and altitude records at the time.

Due to the winter weather conditions at Greenbury Point they crated the airplanes and Towers et al. traveled to North Island in San Diego, California where, in conjunction with the Curtiss Flying School, he took part in developing and improving naval aircraft types
After that winter in San Diego they went back to Greenbury Point. On October 6, 1912, he achieved an American endurance record by rigging extra gasoline tanks to a Curtiss A-2 seaplane, allowing him to remain aloft for 6 hours, ten minutes, 35 seconds. From October to December 1912, Towers conducted tests to spot submerged submarines from the air over the Chesapeake Bay. This later was valuable in leading to the design of the NC boats and the First Crossing of the Atlantic in 1919. He furthered those tests into 1913 during fleet operations near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Additionally, he investigated the potential for Navy aerial reconnaissance, bombing, photography, and communications.

On 8 May 1913, Lt. Towers flew a long-distance flight of 169 miles in a Curtiss flying boat from the Washington Navy Yard down the Potomac River and then up the Chesapeake Bay to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. The flight took three hours and five minutes. Ensign Godfrey Chevalier was his passenger.

On 20 June 1913, Towers was nearly killed in an aviation mishap over the Chesapeake Bay. While he was flying as a passenger in a Wright seaplane, his plane was caught in a sudden downdraft and plummeted earthward. The pilot, Ensign W.D. Billingsley, was thrown from the aircraft and killed (becoming the first naval aviation fatality). Towers was wrenched from his seat but managed to catch a wing strut and stay with the plane until it crashed into the Chesapeake. Interviewed by Glenn Curtiss soon thereafter, Towers recounted the circumstances of the tragedy; his report and resultant recommendations eventually led to the design and adoption of safety belts and harnesses for pilots and their passengers.

On 20 January 1914, after appealing to the higher-ups to move the aviation unit to warmer climes Lieutenant Towers led 9 officers and 23 enlisted men, with seven aircraft, portable hangars and other gear from the aviation unit at Annapolis (Greenbury Point) to Pensacola, Florida to set up the naval aviation training unit. On April 20, 1914, Towers led the first naval aviation unit called into action with the Fleet. He and two other pilots, 12 enlisted men and three aircraft sailed from Pensacola aboard the cruiser in response to the Tampico Affair.

===Naval aviator designation and insignia===
In January 1915, the navy decided to officially designate its flyers. At that time, Towers was officially designated as Naval Aviator No. 3, with an effective date of 1914. Lieutenant Commander Towers, while assigned to the aviation desk under the CNO, is credited with the development of the Naval Aviators badge, which were designed and ordered in 1917. On January 19, 1918, distribution of the first gold Naval Aviator wings began, and it is likely that Towers, as Senior Naval Aviator in Washington at the time, was an early, if not the earliest, recipient.

==World War I==
In August 1914, shortly after the war began, Towers was ordered to London as assistant naval attaché—a billet he filled until he returned to the United States in the autumn of 1916. That August Lieutenant Towers accompanied the U.S. Relief Expedition aboard the as part of the naval delegation led by Commander Reginald R. Belknap, with overall command by Assistant Secretary of the Army Henry S. Breckinridge. Subsequently, Towers advocated for the First Yale Unit, which became the core of naval aviation&#x27;s participation in the war.

In May 1917, Lieutenant Commander Towers was ordered to the Bureau of Navigation as Supervisor of the Naval Reserve Flying Corps, a precursor to the Naval Air Reserve Force. When the Navy established the Division of Aviation, at Navy Department headquarters, Towers was appointed Assistant Director of Naval Aviation. In that position, he orchestrated the buildup from a handful of obsolete aircraft and fewer than 50 pilots to a force of thousands of aircraft and aviators. Towers was subsequently awarded the Navy Cross for his wartime service as Assistant Director of Naval Aviation.

==Interwar years, 1919–1939==
During the interwar years, Towers was the leading advocate of Naval Aviation (and especially carrier aviation) when there was virtually no other support within or outside of the navy. He was involved in a number of pioneering developments in Naval Aviation, including the first transatlantic crossing by aircraft; serving as commander of the first U.S. aircraft carrier, ; and holding important positions (including bureau chief) within the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer), the organizational structure established for naval aviation in 1921.

===Transatlantic crossing: Flight of NC-4, 1919===
In 1919, then-Commander Towers proposed, planned and led the first air crossing of the Atlantic. Planning for the mission actually began during the early years of World War I, when Allied shipping was threatened by submarine warfare, but could not be accomplished prior to the war&#x27;s end. The flying expedition began on 8 May 1919 when three Curtiss NC Flying Boats, designated NC-1, NC-3 and NC-4, left Naval Air Station Rockaway, New York, The aircraft made intermediate stops in Chatham, Massachusetts and Halifax, Nova Scotia before reaching Trepassey, Newfoundland on 15 May 1919.

On 16 May they left for the longest leg of their journey, to the Azores. NC-1 and the NC-3 were both forced to land in heavy seas due to dense fog, and neither could take off again. NC-1 subsequently began taking on water and the crew was rescued by the Greek freighter &quot;Ionia&quot;. The crew of the NC-3, including Towers, managed to keep the NC-3 afloat for 52 hours, water taxiing the craft over 200 miles to Ponta Delgada on São Miguel Island. NC-4 went on to complete the transatlantic crossing, arriving at Lisbon on 27 May. For his leadership in the operation, Towers was awarded his second Navy Cross. He was also made a commander of the Order of the Tower and Sword by the Portuguese government on 3 June 1919. Ten years later, Towers and the flight crew of NC-4 were awarded Congressional Gold Medals.

===Sea and shore assignments, 1920s and 1930s===
Between the autumn of 1919 and the late winter of 1922 and 1923, Towers served at sea—as the executive officer of and as the commanding officer of the old destroyer , which had been redesignated an aircraft tender. Then, after a tour as executive officer at NAS Pensacola, he spent two and one-half years—from March 1923 to September 1925—as an assistant naval attaché, serving at the American embassies at London, Paris, Rome, The Hague, and Berlin.

Returning to the United States in the autumn of 1925, he was assigned to the Bureau of Aeronautics and served as a member of the court of inquiry which investigated the loss of dirigible .

Towers next commanded , the Navy&#x27;s first aircraft carrier, from January 1927 to August 1928. He received a commendation for &quot;coolness and courage in the face of danger&quot; when a gasoline line caught fire and burned on board the carrier in December 1927. Towers personally led the vigorous and successful effort to suppress the flames kindled by the explosion and thus averted a catastrophe.

After shore duty in the Bureau of Aeronautics, Towers successively served as head of the plans division and later, as assistant bureau chief. Towers joined the staff of the Commander, Aircraft, Battle Force, under Rear Admiral Harry E. Yarnell, in June 1931. He was among the staff which planned a successful &quot;attack&quot; on Pearl Harbor during the Joint Army-Navy Exercise No. 4 in the Hawaiian Islands in February 1932—an operation which was to be duplicated on a larger scale by the Japanese in December 1941.

Between June 1933 and June 1939, Towers filled a variety of billets ashore and afloat: he completed the senior course at the Naval War College in 1934; commanded the Naval Air Station at San Diego; again served on the staff of ComAirBatFor; commanded the aircraft carrier ; and became Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics. On 1 June 1939, he was named chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics with the accompanying rank of rear admiral.

==World War II==
As Aeronautics Bureau chief, Towers organized the Navy&#x27;s aircraft procurement plans while war clouds gathered over the Far East and in the Atlantic. Under his leadership, the air arm of the Navy grew from 2,000 planes in 1939 to 39,000 in 1942. He also instituted a rigorous pilot-training program and established a trained group of reserve officers for ground support duties. During Towers&#x27; tenure, the number of men assigned to naval aviation activities reached a high point of some three quarters of a million.

===World War II operational commands===

Promoted to vice admiral on 6 October 1942, Towers became Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet. From this billet, he supervised the development, organization, training, and supply of the Fleet&#x27;s growing aviation capability, and helped develop the strategy which spelled the doom of the Japanese fleet and eventual American victory in the Pacific. For his &quot;sound judgment and keen resourcefulness&quot;, Towers received, successively, the Legion of Merit and the Distinguished Service Medal.

Towers was subsequently promoted to the dual position of Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Ocean Area (DCINCPOA) and Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet (DCINCPAC). In this capacity, he served as Admiral Chester Nimitz&#x27;s chief advisor on naval aviation policy, fleet logistics, and administration matters.

In August 1945, Towers was given command of the Second Fast Carrier Task Force and Task Force 38, Pacific Fleet. He held this position in the closing days of the war.

==Post-war service==
On 7 November 1945, he broke his flag aboard the battleship as commander, 5th Fleet. On 1 February 1946, he relieved Admiral Raymond Spruance as commander in chief, Pacific Fleet, with the aircraft carrier his flagship, and held the post until March 1947.

In 1946, President Truman signed the first Outline Command Plan (now known as the Unified Command Plan) that called for the establishment of several joint or unified commands. On 1 January 1947, the new United States Pacific Command stood up as one of the first unified commands with Admiral Towers as its first commander. He served as the commander of Pacific Command for only two months before being reassigned: 1 January 1947 – 28 February 1947. Admiral Towers was dual-hatted as both commander in chief, Pacific Fleet and commander in chief, Pacific Command.

After chairing the Navy&#x27;s General Board from March to December 1947, Towers retired on 1 December 1947.

==Retirement==
After retirement, Towers served as president of the Pacific War Memorial, as assistant to the president of Pan American World Airways, and as president of the Flight Safety Council. Towers died in St. Albans Naval Hospital, Jamaica, New York, on 30 April 1955 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Honors and awards==
In 1961, Towers was posthumously designated the second recipient of the Gray Eagle Award, as the most senior active naval aviator from 1928 until his retirement. He was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1966, the International Aerospace Hall of Fame in 1973, the Naval Aviation Hall of Honor in 1981 and the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame in 2004.

The decorations and medals he earned during his career include the following:

==Namesakes==
, a guided missile destroyer that saw action in the Vietnam War, was named in his honor. A crater on the moon was named in his honor by the Apollo 17 mission. Towers Field at Jacksonville Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida, is named for him, as is the air field at Richard B. Russell Regional Airport, Rome, Georgia. A pool located on the United States Pacific Fleet command section of Pearl Harbor is named after him.

<doc id="1027759" wikidata="Q311729" url="?curid=1027759" title="Timothy Garton Ash">
<text>Timothy Garton Ash (born 12 July 1955) is a British historian, author and commentator. He is Professor of European Studies at the University of Oxford. Most of his work has been concerned with the contemporary history of Europe, with a special focus on Central and Eastern Europe.

He has written about the former Communist regimes of that region, their experience with the secret police, the Revolutions of 1989, and the transformation of the former Eastern Bloc states into member states of the European Union. He has also examined the role of Europe in the world and the challenge of combining political freedom and diversity, especially in relation to free speech.

==Education==
Garton Ash was born to John Garton Ash (1919–2014) and Lorna Judith Freke. His father was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge and was involved in finance, as well as being a Royal Artillery officer in the British Army during the Second World War. Garton Ash was educated at St Edmund&#x27;s School, Hindhead, Surrey, before going on to Sherborne School, a public school in Dorset in South West England, followed by Exeter College, Oxford, where he studied Modern History.

For postgraduate study he went to St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, and then, in the still divided Berlin, the Free University in West Berlin and the Humboldt University in East Berlin. During his studies in East Berlin, he was under surveillance from the Stasi, which served as the basis for his 1997 book &quot;The File&quot;. Garton Ash cut a suspect figure to the Stasi, who regarded him as a &quot;bourgeois-liberal&quot; and potential British spy.

Although he denies being or having been a British intelligence operative, Garton Ash described himself as a &quot;soldier behind enemy lines&quot; and described the German Democratic Republic as a &quot;very nasty regime indeed&quot;.

==Life and career==
In the 1980s Garton Ash was Foreign Editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot; and a columnist for &quot;The Independent&quot;. He became a Fellow at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, in 1989, a senior fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution in 2000, and Professor of European Studies at the University of Oxford in 2004. He has written a (formerly weekly) column in &quot;The Guardian&quot; since 2004 and is a long-time contributor to the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;. His column was also translated in the Turkish daily &quot;Radikal&quot; and in the Spanish daily &quot;El País&quot;, as well as other newspapers.

In 2005, Garton Ash was listed in &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 most influential people. The article says that &quot;shelves are where most works of history spend their lives. But the kind of history Garton Ash writes is more likely to lie on the desks of the world&#x27;s decision makers.&quot;

==Geopolitics==
Garton Ash describes himself as a liberal internationalist. He is a supporter of what he calls the free world and liberal democracy, represented in his view by the European Union, the United States as a superpower, and Angela Merkel&#x27;s leadership of Germany. Garton Ash opposed Scottish independence and argued for Britishness, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;being British has changed into something worth preserving, especially in a world of migration where peoples are going to become ever more mixed up together. As men and women from different parts of the former British empire have come to live here in ever larger numbers, the post-imperial identity has become, ironically but not accidentally, the most liberal, civic, inclusive one.&quot;

Garton Ash first came to prominence during the Cold War as a supporter of free speech and human rights within countries which were part of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, paying particular attention to Poland and Germany. In more recent times he has represented a British liberal pro-EU viewpoint, nervous at the rise of Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump and Brexit. He is strongly opposed to conservative and populist leaders of EU nations, such as Viktor Orbán of Hungary, arguing that Merkel should &quot;freeze him out&quot;, evoking &quot;appeasement&quot;. Garton Ash was particularly upset about Orbán&#x27;s move against George Soros&#x27; Central European University. Anti-Soviet themes and Poland remain topics of interest for Garton Ash; once a promoter of the anti-Eastern Bloc movement in Poland, he notes with regret the move away from liberalism and globalism towards populism and authoritarianism under socially conservative political and religious leaders such as Jarosław Kaczyński, in a similar manner to his criticisms of Hungary&#x27;s Orbán.

In reviewing his book, &quot;Homelands: A Personal History of Europe&quot;, veteran &quot;Newsweek&quot; Journalist Andrew Nagorski wrote: &quot;It bluntly describes the harsh political repression and monstrous economic failures that characterized the countries behind what was known as the Iron Curtain, while also evocatively capturing the &#x27;abnormal normality&#x27; of a system that ruthlessly quashed all hopes for change, yet inspired people to &#x27;make the best&#x27; of their seemingly hopeless situation.&quot; In that book, Garton Ash describes his meeting with Władysław Bartoszewski and having been &quot;struck not only by the loud, rapid-fire voice of this senior member of the opposition, but also by his confident prediction that the Russian empire would collapse by the end of the century. This was at a time when the Cold War division of Europe appeared to be an unalterable fact of life.&quot;

==Personal life==
Garton Ash and his Polish-born wife Danuta live primarily in Oxford, England, and also near Stanford University in California as part of his work with the Hoover Institution. They have two sons, Tom Ash, a web developer based in Canada, and Alec Ash, an author and editor focused on China. His elder brother, Christopher, is a Church of England clergyman.

<text>Compañía de Aviación Faucett, colloquially known simply as Faucett Perú or Faucett, was a Peruvian airline. It was headquartered on the grounds of Jorge Chávez International Airport in Lima.

==History==

===Beginnings===
Elmer J. Faucett had been sent to Peru as a representative of the Curtiss Export Company, arriving in the country from the United States in 1920. In 1928, he and a group of Peruvian business men joined to found the first commercial airline in Peru, and one of the first in Latin America. With an initial investment of £2,500, the company was formed on 15 September 1928, and started operations on 27 September that year. In 1937, the airline absorbed Compañía de Aviación Peruana SA from Panagra. At , the route network was flown with seven planes manufactured by the Stinson Aircraft Company, and included Chiclayo, Ica, Lima, Sabados and Talara.

===Postwar operations (1945–1960)===
Having their initial investment increased to £200,000 by 1943, Elmer Faucett bought a large number of aircraft from the United States in 1945.

By , the airline flew a route network that was long. Faucett carried 136,456 passengers in 1955, and at year end the company had 307 employees.

By , the airline had a fleet of eight DC-3s, four DC-4s and four Faucett Stinson F-19s to serve a route network that was long. A second-hand Douglas DC-6B acquired from Panagra was incorporated into the fleet in the early 1960s. Another DC-6B was acquired in late 1964, and was converted to DC-6B(F) standard with a large rear freight door. This was operated on cargo services to Miami, Florida.

===1970s–1980s===
In 1973, Faucett was owned by Peruvian interests (46%), the Fundación Faucett (35%) and Braniff International Airways (19%). The cargo-only airline Aeronaves del Peru became Faucett&#x27;s biggest shareholder in 1982.

===1990s: Decline and final years===
The 1990s economic liberalization under Alberto Fujimori, after years of economic and political chaos (as well as a violent Maoist insurgency), brought a series of measures aimed at the privatization and deregulation of the airline market. A series of short-lived airlines sprung up during this decade (in the style of Russian Babyflots), state-owned Aeroperú was partly sold to Mexican investors and the rise of low-fare Aero Continente as the biggest domestic airline, contributed to the slow decline of Faucett. A series of high-profile accidents, especially Faucett&#x27;s crash in Arequipa and Aeroperú Flight 603 (both in 1996) affected the safety reputation of the Peruvian airline industry, with the US Embassy in Lima banning their employees from flying on Aero Continente and, more broadly, advising caution to US citizens flying on Peru&#x27;s airlines.

In the end, problems with the economic-financial structure of the airline (with debts even with CORPAC for airport services), forced it to cease operations on 3 December 1997. Despite claiming that the 45-day closure would be temporary until government approval, all 1,250 employees were dismissed. Faucett incurred over US$1 million in debt. By 1998, the former directors and employees were engaged in legal battles over labor and management issues, as well as accusations over bankrupting the company. The airline was liquidated in 1999.

== Destinations==
Faucett Perú served the following destinations:


According to the February 15, 1985 edition of the Official Airline Guide (OAG), Faucett was also serving Owen Roberts International Airport on Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands as an intermediate stop on its service between Lima and Miami.

==Fleet==

At March 1990, the airline had 1,300 employees and a fleet of ten aircraft that consisted of two Boeing 727-200s, one Boeing 737-100, four Boeing 737-200s and three McDonnell Douglas DC-8-50s.

Overall, Faucett Perú operated the following equipment at various times during its history:

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 8 December 1967, a Faucett Douglas DC-4 airliner crashed into a mountain in the Andes at 10,470 feet, killing all 66 passengers and six crew.
* On 11 September 1990, a Faucett Boeing 727-247 went missing some 180 miles southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. After having been leased to Air Malta, the aircraft was being returned to Peru from Europe via Iceland, when the crew reported a low fuel notice and that they were preparing to ditch. There were apparently no survivors among 16 occupants on board.
* On 29 February 1996, Faucett Perú Flight 251, a Boeing 737 crashed in the mountains near Arequipa&#x27;s airport, killing all 117 passengers and 6 crew aboard.

<doc id="1027767" wikidata="Q282110" url="?curid=1027767" title="Izora Armstead">
<text>Izora Margaret Rhodes-Armstead (July 6, 1942 – September 16, 2004) was an American singer. Known for her distinctive alto voice, Armstead first achieved success as one half of the duo Two Tons O&#x27; Fun, along with Martha Wash, as they sang backup for American disco singer Sylvester. The duo obtained their own record deal as Two Tons O&#x27;Fun in 1979. They released three consecutive songs that were hits on the Dance Chart. The duo was renamed The Weather Girls in 1982 after the release of their single &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;, their most successful single. As a duo, The Weather Girls released five albums and were also featured on Sylvester&#x27;s albums.

After The Weather Girls disbanded in 1988, Armstead released a single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Love Slip Away&quot; (1991). In 1991, she reformed The Weather Girls with her daughter Dynelle Rhodes, who had been one of the duo&#x27;s background singers. Over the course of a decade, they released three albums: &quot;Double Tons of Fun&quot; (1993), &quot;Think Big!&quot; (1995), and &quot;Puttin&#x27; On The Hits&quot; (1999).

On September 16, 2004, Armstead died from heart failure in San Leandro, California.

==Early life==
Izora M. Rhodes was born on July 6, 1942, in Houston, Texas. She moved to San Francisco, California with her family when she was a child. At the young age of four, she began playing piano and later began singing at age eight. Rhodes eventually became the lead vocalist and pianist of San Francisco Inspirational Choir. Rhodes studied classical music at San Francisco Conservatory. She modeled herself after her favorite singers Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward.

By 1975, Rhodes had a total of seven children, six boys and a girl, that she raised as a single parent. To support her children, Rhodes worked as a bartender and a nurse assistant. In addition, Rhodes also worked as a piano and vocal teacher. In 1976, Rhodes married a new husband and changed her last name to Armstead. According to the autobiography book &quot;The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco&quot; written by Joshua Gamson, she had a total of eleven children (four of which are allegedly step-children) with then-new husband [Armstead]. Now Izora Armstead, she eventually landed in a short-lived gospel group called N.O.W. (News of the World), which would include neighborhood friend Martha Wash.

==Career==
===1976–1981: Sylvester and Two Tons O&#x27; Fun===

In February 1976, friend Martha Wash auditioned as a backup singer before American singer-songwriter Sylvester and his manager Brent Thomson. Impressed with her vocal performance, Sylvester inquired if she had another large black friend who could sing, after which she introduced him to Izora Rhodes. Although he referred to them simply as &quot;the girls&quot;, Wash and Rhodes formed a musical duo called Two Tons O&#x27; Fun (sometimes referred to as &quot;The Two Tons&quot;). Two Tons O&#x27; Fun debuted as Sylvester&#x27;s backing vocalists on his self-titled third album &quot;Sylvester&quot;, released in 1977. The duo sang backup vocals on the album&#x27;s singles &quot;Down, Down, Down&quot; and &quot;Over and Over&quot;, which charted at number eighteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance chart. In 1978, Sylvester released his fourth album &quot;Step II&quot;, which also featured The Two Tons&#x27; background vocals throughout the album. &quot;Dance (Disco Heat)&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single which featured The Tons, peaked at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance chart and became their first number-one single on that chart. In 1979, Two Tons O&#x27; Fun sang background on Sylvester&#x27;s live album &quot;Living Proof&quot;. Later that year, the duo secured their own record deal with Fantasy Records.

On January 24, 1980, the duo released their debut self-titled album &quot;Two Tons of Fun&quot;. The album spawned two top-five dance singles: &quot;Earth Can Be Just Like Heaven&quot; and &quot;I Got the Feeling&quot;. Their second album &quot;Backatcha&quot; was released later that year. The album spawned a single &quot;I Depend On You&quot; that peaked at number seventy-two on the Dance chart.

===1982–1988: The Weather Girls===
In September 1982, the duo released their single &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;. The song became their biggest hit, peaking at number one on the Dance chart and number forty-six on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 chart. Following the success of the song, Two Tons o Fun changed their group name to The Weather Girls. On January 22, 1983, they released their third album &quot;Success&quot;. The album&#x27;s titled-track &quot;Success&quot; was released as the second single and peaked at number eighty-nine on the R&amp;B chart. In 1985, The Weather Girls released their fourth album &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. In 1988, The Weather Girls released their self-titled fifth album &quot;The Weather Girls&quot;, the final album featuring Armstead and Wash. Shortly after the release of the album, The Weather Girls were dropped from Columbia and soon disbanded to pursue solo careers.

===1989–1991: Solo career===
Following the disbandment of The Weather Girls, Armstead pursued a brief solo career. She began touring as a solo artist, performing songs from The Weather Girls. In 1991, she released a single &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Love Slip Away&quot;.

===1991–2004: Reformation of The Weather Girls===
After a three-year hiatus and Wash pursuing her solo career, Armstead reformed The Weather Girls with her daughter Dynelle Rhodes and relocated to Germany in 1991. Their first album together, &quot;Double Tons of Fun&quot;, was released in 1993. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Can You Feel It&quot; peaked at number two &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Dance chart. The song also peaked at number 75 on Germany&#x27;s music chart, their second single to enter that chart since &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;. While touring the club circuit, the album&#x27;s third single &quot;We Shall All Be Free&quot; peaked at number 80 on Germany&#x27;s music chart. Their follow-up album &quot;Think Big!&quot; was released in December 1995. The album saw Armstead&#x27;s contribution as a songwriter and penning several songs, including the album&#x27;s third single &quot;The Sound of Sex (Ooh Gitchie O-La-La-Ay)&quot; which was written with her daughter. The album also contained a cover version of Sylvester&#x27;s 1979 disco hit &quot;Stars&quot;, recorded as a duet with Scottish pop singer Jimmy Somerville.

In 1999, The Weather Girls released their eighth studio album &quot;Puttin&#x27; On The Hits&quot; which contained a collection of covered disco songs. In 2002, they joined the Disco Brothers for a participation in the German National Final for the Eurovision Song Contest, with their song &quot;Get Up&quot;. Overall, the group finished in thirteenth place.

==Final years and death==
Armstead&#x27;s final recording was the single &quot;Big Brown Girl&quot; with The Weather Girls, released in 2004. In August 2004, Armstead returned to the Bay Area to undergo treatment for heart-related problems. In mid-September 2004, Armstead was checked into San Leandro Hospital after her condition deteriorated. On September 16, 2004, Armstead died from heart failure at the age of 62 in 2004 in San Leandro, California. She was survived by her seven children. Her funeral was held at St. John Missionary Baptist Church in San Francisco, California. She was laid to rest in Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California.

==Legacy==
As of 2004, Armstead&#x27;s voice has collectively accumulated a total of three number-one dance singles: &quot;Dance (Disco Heat)&quot; (1978) and &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot; (1978) with Sylvester; and &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; with The Weather Girls. Her single &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; was ranked the song at thirty-five on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Dance Songs in 2000, and also at thirty-five in their 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 1980s in 2009. Armstead&#x27;s daughter Dynelle Rhodes received the rights to The Weather Girls name. Rhodes added a then-new member Ingrid Arthur to The Weather Girls and began performing as a tribute to Armstead. The Weather Girls&#x27; album &quot;Totally Wild!&quot; (2005) was dedicated to Armstead. In 2012, Rhodes replaced Ingrid Arthur with Dorrey Lin Lyles.

On September 14, 2014, &quot;Mighty Real: A Fabulous Sylvester Musical&quot;, a Broadway musical about Sylvester, debuted in New York City. Armstead&#x27;s likeness was featured in the production and she was portrayed by actress Anastacia McCleskey.

<text>The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB) (also known as Anti-Scrape) is an amenity society founded by William Morris, Philip Webb, and others in 1877 to oppose the destructive &#x27;restoration&#x27; of ancient buildings occurring in Victorian England. &quot;Ancient&quot; is used here in the wider sense rather than the more usual modern sense of &quot;pre-medieval.&quot;

== History ==
Morris&#x27; call for the society to be founded was provoked by Sir Gilbert Scott&#x27;s proposed restoration of Tewkesbury Abbey. In an 1877 letter printed in &quot;The Athenæum&quot;, he wrote

Alongside Morris, Philip Webb was instrumental in establishing the society in the month following Morris&#x27; letter. Initial supporters announced at the group&#x27;s initial meeting included Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin, James Bryce, Sir John Lubbock, Leslie Stephen, Coventry Patmore, Edward Burne-Jones, Holman Hunt, Lord Houghton and A. J. Mundella. Morris drafted a manifesto, and served as Honorary Secretary for the society&#x27;s first year, continuing as an active member for the remainder of his life.

Morris was particularly concerned about the practice, which he described as &quot;forgery&quot;, of attempting to return functioning buildings to an idealized state from the distant past, often involving the removal of elements added in their later development, which he thought had contributed to their interest as documents of the past. Instead, he proposed that ancient buildings should be repaired, not restored, to protect as cultural heritage their entire history. Today, these principles are widely accepted. Morris referred to the society as &quot;Anti-scrape&quot;, a reference to the practice of scraping plaster and other later additions from buildings in order to reveal bare stonework.

Early causes taken on by the society included Scott&#x27;s plans for Tewkesbury Abbey; a planned restoration of the choir of Canterbury Cathedral; destruction of Christopher Wren&#x27;s churches in the City of London; and the rebuilding of the nave roof of St Alban&#x27;s Abbey. In 1879, they organised representations against a proposal to rebuild the West front of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, Venice.

The approach to conservation advocated by the SPAB was influential upon the National Trust after it acquired its first building, Alfriston Clergy House, in 1895. The SPAB had earlier been consulted on the building and had put the owners in contact with the nascent National Trust. The Trust opted to take a preservation approach to the building, in line with SPAB ideas, which has remained its principle for all its buildings acquired since.

The architect A.R. Powys served as the Secretary of the SPAB for 25 years in the early 20th century.

==Organization and activities==
Today, the SPAB still operates according to Morris&#x27;s original manifesto. It campaigns, advises, runs training programmes and courses, conducts research, and publishes information. As one of the National Amenity Societies, the Society is a statutory consultee on alterations to listed buildings, and by law must be notified of any application in England and Wales to demolish any listed building in whole or in part.

The society, which is a registered charity, is based at 37 Spital Square, London. The society has branches in Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. In 2022, the society reported 6579 members.

For its dedicated service to heritage, the society was awarded the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award in 2012.

The society&#x27;s Mills Section is concerned with the protection, repair, and continued use of traditional windmills and watermills. Ken Major carried out much work on its behalf.

An annual award honours the memory of church enthusiast and SPAB member Sir John Betjeman. The award is presented for outstanding repairs to the fabric of places of worship in England and Wales completed in the last 18 months.

<text>Cheetos (formerly styled as Chee-tos until 1998) is a crunchy corn-cheese puff snack brand made by Frito-Lay, a subsidiary of PepsiCo. Fritos creator Charles Elmer Doolin invented Cheetos in 1948, and began national distribution in the United States. The initial success of Cheetos was a contributing factor to the merger between The Frito Company and H.W. Lay &amp; Company in 1961 to form Frito-Lay. In 1965 Frito-Lay became a subsidiary of The Pepsi-Cola Company, forming PepsiCo, the current owner of the Cheetos brand.

In 2010, Cheetos was ranked as the top selling brand of cheese puffs in its primary market of the U.S.; worldwide the annual retail sales totaled approximately $4 billion. The original Crunchy Cheetos are still in production but the product line has since expanded to include 21 different types of Cheetos in North America alone. As Cheetos are sold in more than 36 countries, the flavor and composition is often varied to match regional taste and cultural preferences—such as Savory American Cream in China, and Strawberry Cheetos in Japan.

==History==
Cheetos were invented in 1948 by Fritos creator Charles Elmer Doolin, who cooked early test batches in the Frito Company&#x27;s research and development kitchen in Dallas, Texas. The cheese-flavored snack sold quickly, but Doolin did not have the production or distribution capacity to support a nationwide launch. This led Doolin to partner with potato chip businessman Herman W. Lay for marketing and distribution, and Cheetos were introduced nationally in the U.S. in 1948, along with a potato product called Fritatos. The success of Cheetos prompted Doolin and Lay to merge their two companies in 1961, forming Frito-Lay Inc. At the time, Cheetos was one of four large snack food brands produced by the company, which had annual revenues of $127 million. Frito-Lay merged with the Pepsi-Cola Company to form PepsiCo in 1965, prompting further distribution of Cheetos outside of North America.

While Cheetos were not the first snack food of its kind (Elmer&#x27;s Chee Wee&#x27;s were created in 1933), newer competing products in the snack food category have since emerged—including Utz Cheese Curls, Herr&#x27;s Cheese Curls and Wise Cheez Doodles, along with Planters&#x27; Cheese Puffs and Cheese Curls. Most of the competing cheese-flavored snacks are distributed in specific regions of the U.S., and as of 2010 Cheetos remains as the top-selling cheese puff in America.

As of 2011, Cheetos are produced, marketed and distributed under three different PepsiCo operating divisions: PepsiCo Americas Foods (which includes Frito-Lay in the United States and Canada, Sabritas in Mexico and Latin Americas Foods in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela, and Peru), PepsiCo Europe and PepsiCo APAC and AMESA. PepsiCo also granted a license to the Strauss-Elite company to distribute the Cheetos snack. In 2010, worldwide annual sales of Cheetos totaled approximately $4 billion, making it the 11th-largest PepsiCo brand.

In 2021, PepsiCo and Indofood announced that Indofood CBP has officially purchased all of the shares owned by Fritolay Netherlands Holding B.V., an affiliate of PepsiCo at PT Indofood Fritolay Makmur (IFL, now PT Indofood Fortuna Makmur) worth IDR 494 billion, thus the production of Lay&#x27;s, Cheetos, and Doritos brand snacks in Indonesia were stopped on 18 August 2021. In addition, PepsiCo and its affiliates has also agreed not to produce, package, sell, market or distribute snack products that compete with IFL products in Indonesia for a period of three years. The Cheetos brand produced by Indofood has since been renamed into new variants of Chiki (Twist, Puffs, and Net). Indonesia is the only Cheetos market that sells Roasted Corn flavor of Cheetos while Doritos would take on the new name Maxicorn.

In February 2025, Cheetos was reintroduced in Indonesia, which is currently produced by PT PepsiCo Indonesia Foods and Beverages in Cikarang, Bekasi Regency, West Java, is available in two flavors, Cheese and Roasted Corn Cheese.

==Products and distribution==
The first Cheetos product was Crunchy Cheetos, invented in 1948 in San Antonio, Texas. Crunchy Cheetos remained the brand&#x27;s sole product for 23 years until the introduction of Cheetos Puffs in 1971. The baked varieties, otherwise known as Baked Cheetos, became available beginning in 2004. As of 2010, there are 21 different variants of Cheetos snacks distributed in the United States. In addition to the original Crunchy Cheetos, Cheetos Puffs and Baked varieties are sold in alternate shape and flavor variations—including a spicy variety known as Flamin&#x27; Hot Cheetos.

Cheetos are among the snack varieties included in the Frito-Lay Munchies snack mix.

With the introduction of Frito-Lay&#x27;s Natural line, Natural Cheetos were introduced in the mid-2000s, touting all-natural ingredients and real Wisconsin white cheddar cheese. They accompany other Frito-Lay products in the Natural line and compete in the market space occupied by other health-conscious snack foods, such as Pirate&#x27;s Booty. The Natural brand was re-branded to Simply in 2014.

Cheetos first entered Brazil in 1976, followed by other countries such as Australia during the 1980s. In 1994, Cheetos became the first American brand of snack food to be made and distributed in China. As the distribution of Cheetos expanded outside the U.S. to include more than 36 countries, localized versions were produced to conform to regional tastes and cultural preferences.

Frito-Lay conducted extensive testing before settling on flavors for the Chinese market, with ranch dressing, North Sea crab, smoked octopus and caramel being passed up for two flavors: Savory American Cream and Zesty Japanese Steak. These flavors were produced as the result of focus group testing, in which the original Crunchy Cheetos did not test as well. Strawberry Cheetos, a plain corn Cheeto coated in strawberry icing, were released in Japan in 2008. In 2013, a Pepsi-flavored Cheeto was introduced in Japan, and a Mountain Dew-flavored variety was available in 2014. In India, Cheetos Whoosh are sold, made of ingredients such as whole grain and vegetables.

In 2015, Frito-Lay released a limited edition cinnamon sugar-flavored snack called Sweetos to U.S. markets. Sweetos were the first sweet snack that Cheetos had released in the United States in the brand&#x27;s 67-year history.

In the first week of 2020, Frito-Lay began distributing &quot;Cheetos popcorn&quot;.

In August 2020, Frito-Lay introduced a Cheetos mac n&#x27; cheese.

=== Flamin&#x27; Hot Cheetos ===
According to Frito-Lay records, Flamin&#x27; Hot Cheetos, a spicy version of the product, was developed at the company&#x27;s headquarters in Texas starting in 1989, as part of a project led by Lynne Greenfeld, and introduced in test markets in the summer of 1990, alongside Flamin&#x27; Hot versions of Fritos and Lays. They became available nationwide in early 1992, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; would go on to call them &quot;something of a cultural phenomenon&quot;, with &quot;Newsweek&quot; noting that it &quot;rejuvenated the brand&quot; and would become a &quot;central element in Cheetos marketing&quot;.

Beginning in the late 2000s, Richard Montañez, who had started his career at Frito-Lay as a plant janitor and later became a marketing director for the company, claimed that he had invented Flamin&#x27; Hot Cheetos in the early 1990s while still a janitor, observing that the brand did not have any products targeting Latinos. Montañez claimed he had pitched his idea to CEO Roger Enrico as part of Enrico&#x27;s initiative to empower employees to help the flagging company. In 2018, Fox Searchlight started developing a biopic about the origin story of Flamin&#x27; Hot Cheetos as told by Montañez. It starred Jesse Garcia as Montañez and marked actress Eva Longoria&#x27;s feature directorial debut. Hulu and Disney+ released the film, titled &quot;Flamin&#x27; Hot&quot;, in 2023.

In May 2021, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Frito-Lay had begun an internal investigation in 2018 following a complaint by Greenfeld. The company, which had not previously contradicted Montañez&#x27;s story publicly, said of the results of that investigation: &quot;None of our records show that Richard [Montañez] was involved in any capacity in the Flamin&#x27; Hot test market ... we do not credit the creation of Flamin&#x27; Hot Cheetos or any Flamin&#x27; Hot products to him.&quot; Additional reporting by the &quot;Times&quot; indicated that Montañez&#x27;s claims did not line up with other events in the product&#x27;s release timeline, including newspaper articles announcing the test market release in 1990, and Enrico not joining Frito-Lay until later that year. However, the &quot;Times&quot; noted a 1993 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; story indicating that Montañez &quot;was&quot; responsible for suggesting subsequent product ideas that built on the Flamin&#x27; Hot line, including Flamin&#x27; Hot Popcorn.

Montañez has stood by his claims following the &quot;LA Times&quot; investigation, arguing that there was a lack of documentation because of the low level of his job at the time, but adding that he was not aware of what might have been going on in other divisions of the company, and thus he did not have reason to dispute Greenfeld&#x27;s accounts.

==Manufacturing==
Cheetos are manufactured by blending corn and water. The germ of the corn is removed to prevent spoiling; the germless corn is then ground into cornmeal. Because the cornmeal lacks the nutrients provided by the germs, it is enriched by adding nutrients in order to increase its nutritional value. (Enriched cornmeal is found in the following flavors: Crunchy, Puffs, Flamin&#x27; Hot Crunchy, Flamin&#x27; Hot Puffs, Flamin&#x27; Hot Limon Crunchy, XXTRA Flamin&#x27; Hot Crunchy, Reduced Fat Flamin&#x27; Hot Puffs, Reduced Fat Puffs, and Cheddar Jalapeño Crunchy.) The mixture is heated under pressure, and then extruded through a die. The texture of the snack is formed as a result of contact with hot air, causing steam in the mixture to expand and creating its characteristic texture. After oven-drying or frying, the product is then tumbled with the desired flavor components (the original Crunchy Cheetos are fried). The process takes approximately 19 minutes and each half hour an in-house lab team inspects and taste-tests each batch. At this point, the result of the inspection is determined by comparing each batch to product sent from Frito-Lay headquarters. Other flavor and format variations such as Cheetos Puffs, Cheetos Paws, Cheetos Twists, Cheetos Balls, and Cheetos Whirls are all finished with a drying stage in large ovens. As of 2010, Frito-Lay has 14 fried-Cheetos plants in 11 states throughout the United States.

==Marketing==

The first Cheetos mascot was the animated Cheetos Mouse, which debuted in early 1971. The Cheetos Mouse spoke with an upper class accent, and typically wore a three piece suit. He used the slogans &quot;Chee-tos. Cheese that goes crunch!&quot; and several years later, &quot;Hail Chee-sar!&quot;. The mouse was seen in television commercials and print ads for Cheetos, until the character was phased out around 1979.

The Cheetos brand is commonly recognized by association with its second and current mascot, an anthropomorphic sly, smooth-voiced cartoon cheetah named Chester Cheetah. Chester first appeared in television commercials in 1986, known for concluding Cheetos advertisements with slogans, which have evolved over time. He used both &quot;The cheese that goes crunch!&quot; and &quot;It ain&#x27;t easy bein&#x27; cheesy&quot; as slogans from 1986 to 1997, and then &quot;Dangerously cheesy&quot; from 1997 onwards. In 2003, Chester was first rendered as a computer-generated character in the United States, while continuing to appear in a traditionally animated form in some other countries where the brand is sold.

Beginning in 2008, Cheetos advertising and promotion broadened in regard to age appeal, with a revised focus on an adult demographic. In this personification, Chester speaks with a deep voice and encourages people to use their Cheetos in acts of revenge or to solve problems. In February 2009, Cheetos was the subject of its first Super Bowl commercial. In the , 30 second advertisement, a &quot;loud, chatty woman&quot; is talking on her mobile phone at a restaurant. Chester the Cheetah persuades another customer to toss Cheetos onto the ground, attracting a flock of birds to drive away the obnoxious loud-talking customer. The scenario depicted in this commercial exemplifies the adult-oriented themes of subversion and revenge, which continue to be prevalent in Cheetos advertisements produced since 2008.

In 2009, Frito-Lay invited popular blog &quot;Boing Boing&quot; to feature online ads for Cheetos. The blog contracted Johannes Grenzfurthner (of monochrom) to create an artistic campaign for the product.

On August 15, 2017, Frito-Lay announced the opening of its The Spotted Cheetah pop-up restaurant in New York, with dishes made with Cheetos with chef Anne Burrell. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the restaurant&#x27;s reserve spots quickly sold out.

<text>Thomas Tew (died September 1695), also known as the Rhode Island Pirate, was a 17th-century English privateer-turned-pirate. He embarked on two major pirate voyages and met a bloody death on the second, and he pioneered the route which became known as the Pirate Round. Other infamous pirates in his path included Henry Avery and William Kidd.

==Life and career==
It is frequently written that Tew had family in Rhode Island dating back to 1640, but it is not known where he was born. He may have been born in New England; another hypothesis suggests that he was born in Maidford, Northamptonshire before emigrating to the American colonies as a child with his family, although there is only a little circumstantial evidence for this. He lived at one time in Newport, Rhode Island. He is reported as being married with two daughters. According to one source, his wife and children all greatly enjoyed the New York City social scene after Tew became rich, but there is no supporting evidence for this.

In 1691, Tew moved to Bermuda. There is evidence that he was already reputed as a pirate at that time, but no modern historian has determined whether or not this reputation was earned. He may simply have engaged in privateering against French and Spanish ships. He was in close relations with fellow pirate Captain Richard Want, who was his closest ally. Want became Tew&#x27;s first mate on his first pirate cruise, and sailed his own ship &quot;Dolphin&quot; alongside Tew&#x27;s &quot;Amity&quot; on the second.

===First pirate cruise===
In 1692, Thomas Tew obtained a letter of marque from the Governor of Bermuda. Various Bermudian backers provided him with the 70-ton sloop &quot;Amity,&quot; armed with eight guns and crewed by 46 officers and men. He and another captain obtained a privateer&#x27;s commission from the lieutenant governor of Bermuda to destroy a French factory off the coast of West Africa. Tew set sail in December, ostensibly to serve as a privateer against French holdings in the Gambia. He set out alongside buccaneer, privateer, and pirate George Dew aboard the sloop &quot;Amity&quot;; shortly out of port, they were separated in a storm. Dew&#x27;s dismasted ship limped alone to Saldanha Bay in South Africa, where he was arrested by the Dutch. Not long out of Bermuda, Tew announced his intention of turning to piracy, asking the crew for their support since he could not enforce the illegal scheme without their consent. Tew&#x27;s crew reportedly answered with the shout, &quot;A gold chain or a wooden leg, we&#x27;ll stand with you!&quot; The pirates proceeded to elect a quartermaster, a common pirate practice to balance the captain&#x27;s power.

Tew reached the Red Sea and ran down a large Ghanjah dhow en route from India to the Ottoman Empire late in 1693. The dhow surrendered without serious resistance, inflicting no casualties on the assailants. Tew&#x27;s pirates helped themselves to the ship&#x27;s treasure, worth £100,000 () in gold and silver alone, not counting the value of the ivory, spices, gemstones, and silk taken. Tew&#x27;s 45 men afterward shared out between £1,200 () and £3,000 () per man, and Tew himself claimed about £8,000 (). Tew urged his crew to hunt down and rob the other ships in the Indian convoy, but he yielded to the opposition of the quartermaster. He set course back to the Cape of Good Hope, stopping at Adam Baldridge&#x27;s pirate settlement at St. Mary&#x27;s on Madagascar to careen.

Tew reached Newport in April 1694. Benjamin Fletcher, royal governor of Province of New York, became good friends with him and his family.

===Second pirate cruise===

In November 1694, Tew bought a new letter of marque from Fletcher and set out for another pirate cruise. His crew numbered 30 to 40 men at departure this time. John Ireland served as navigator on Tew&#x27;s &quot;Amity&quot; during their second cruise, although he claimed after his own capture that both he and Tew had been forced to serve by the sloop&#x27;s mutinous crew. According to his deposition, the crew threatened the pair during what would have been a trip from New York to Boston to prepare for privateering against the French. However, by the time that he reached Madagascar, Tew apparently increased his force to 50 or 60 men.

They arrived at the Mandab Strait at the mouth of the Red Sea in August 1695, where Tew found several other pirates hoping to duplicate his prior success, including Henry Avery in the powerfully armed warship &quot;Fancy&quot;, fellow Rhode Island pirate captains Joseph Faro and Thomas Wake, William May, and Richard Want. Tew and the other pirate captains decided to sail in concert.

In September 1695, a 25-ship Mughal convoy approached the Mandab Strait, slipping past the pirates during the night. Tew and his fellow pirates pursued. The &quot;Amity&quot; attacked one of the Mughal ships, believed to be the &quot;Fateh Muhammed&quot;. Tew was killed in this battle, reportedly disemboweled by a cannon shot. Demoralized, his crew surrendered immediately, though they were freed later when Avery&#x27;s &quot;Fancy&quot; captured the &quot;Fateh Muhammed&quot;. The &quot;Amity&quot; returned to Baldridge&#x27;s settlement under John Ireland&#x27;s command to refit; they later swapped the &quot;Amity&quot; for Richard Glover&#x27;s &quot;Charming Mary&quot; and plundered ships in the Indian Ocean under captain Richard Bobbington.

==Legacy==
Tew&#x27;s burial site is unknown, but he is said to be the father of Ratsimilaho, a man who created a kingdom on the east coast of Madagascar. In addition, it has been claimed that Tew was one of the founders of the mysterious (and some believe fictional) pirate colony of Libertatia. King William III commissioned Captain William Kidd to hunt down several pirates, Thomas Tew and John Ireland among them, but Tew was already dead by the time Kidd set sail.

==Jolly Roger Flag==

Tew&#x27;s personal standard is often depicted as a black flag with a white arm holding a short sword. Buccaneers Edmund Cooke and Edward Davis used a similar design, except Cooke used a red-and-yellow striped field while Davis used a white field with a black arm holding a sword on it. However, there is no evidence from period sources that Tew ever flew this flag, which is a 20th-century attribution.

<text>Aldermaston Court is a country house and private park built in the Victorian era for Daniel Higford Davall Burr with incorporations from a Stuart house. It is south-east of the village nucleus of Aldermaston in the English county of Berkshire. The predecessor manor house became a mansion from the wealth of its land and from assistance to Charles I during the English Civil War under ownership of the Forster baronets of Aldermaston after which the estate has alternated between the names Aldermaston Park and Aldermaston Manor.

The estate became dominated by its neo-Elizabethan mansion after a fire of 1843 destroyed one third of the predecessor and various landscape features were added which have resulted in building and grounds being Grade II* listed. Between the turn of the 21st century and its closure in 2012, the estate has been a wedding venue, a conference centre, and a hotel. Aside from the manor house and its immediate surroundings, the park is home to office buildings and a lake.

==Architecture==
The current house is situated approximately south of the original manor house. Rebuilt by Daniel Burr in 1848 following a huge fire, the new manor was built in the Elizabethan style, and incorporated the figured wooden staircase, some stained glass, and the chimney stacks from the 1636 house, which was later demolished.

===Park===
Aldermaston Park is an ancient and derelict wood pasture, featuring numerous examples of pollard oak and sweet chestnut. In the mid-16th century, the park was , by 1721 it was and by 1860 it was considered .

==History of the estate==

=== The Achard Family (11th century–1361) ===
Robert FitzAchard (1070–1161) was granted the Aldermaston estate in 1100 by Henry I of England; no records of the house at this time have survived. FitzAchard was a distinguished Norman soldier whose son built the north transept in the parish church. According to the Pipe Rolls of 1168, the name had become Aldermannestun. The Achard family hosted Henry III at the manor in 1227, but granted a long lease of the rectory and glebe to Priory of Monk Sherborne (Pamber Priory); the family are all buried at their secondary manor of Sparsholt. The estate descended to Peter Achard who died in 1361 with a female heir (daughter); it was inherited by Thomas de la Mare as his son-in-law.

=== De la Mare descendants (1361–1490) ===
De la Mare was from Somerset, and became the High Sheriff of Berkshire in 1370. His son was bestowed with this same position during Richard II&#x27;s reign in the late 14th century. Robert de la Mare, Thomas&#x27;s grandson, married into the Brocas family of Beaurepaire, near Bramley, and was made a Knight of the Shire by Henry V. Robert&#x27;s son was the last of the de la Mare lineage, and a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre.

Elizabeth de la Mare, whose male relatives predeceased her, inherited Aldermaston. She married into the Forster baronets&#x27; family from Northumberland. Stephen Forster, an ancestor, had previously become the Lord Mayor of London in 1454.

=== Forster descendants (1490–1752) ===
Elizabeth&#x27;s husband, George Forster, was the son of Sir Humphrey Forster I from Harpsden near Henley.
When Elizabeth and George married, George became the owner of Aldermaston Manor along with other manors previously owned by the De la Mare family. He was knighted by Henry VII in 1501, becoming Sheriff of Berkshire and Oxford in 1517. He was made a Knight of the Bath in 1525. His assumed wealth meant that he was part of Henry VIII&#x27;s entourage at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. George was succeeded by his son, Humphrey II, in 1533, a high sheriff.

During Humphrey II&#x27;s lordship, he faced strong disputes with Francis Parkyns (alternatively spelled &quot;Perkins&quot;), who was the brother of the Squire of Ufton and tenant of nearby Padworth Manor. Parkyns was unhappy with Forster&#x27;s &quot;over-lordship&quot; of Aldermaston, and Forster retaliated by breaking into Parkyns&#x27;s house and severely assaulting him while he ate breakfast. Anne Parkyns, Francis&#x27;s wife, begged for his life. Forster – along with an armed entourage – dragged Francis to Ufton, where the family of his brother Richard were breakfasting. More violence broke out, with Lady Marvyn – Richard&#x27;s wife – also begging for Francis&#x27;s life to be spared. Francis was eventually taken to Aldermaston where he was jailed in the lock-up behind the village pub.

Humphrey was later succeeded by his son, William (who married Jane, daughter of Anthony Hungerford).

Elizabeth I visited Aldermaston twice. Her first visit, in 1558, was during the lordship of William, and the second – in 1592 – during his son Humphrey III&#x27;s tenure.

Humphrey III&#x27;s son, William II, fathered a son – Humphrey IV – in 1595. He and his wife Anne began building a mansion house, known as Aldermaston House, in 1618 by laying a new cornerstone. The house was completed in 1636, and was dedicated with a short verse:
Aldermaston saw military stationing in the English Civil War. In 1643, after the First Battle of Newbury, Robert Devereux&#x27;s Parliamentarians were attacked by Prince Rupert of the Rhine in Padworth Lane. The road is now known as Red Lane, having taken its name from the bloodshed.

In October of the following year, a regiment of Parliamentary troops under the command Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester camped in the Aldermaston area. They were defending the crossing at the River Kennet, an operation that came about due to Humphrey Forster&#x27;s staunch Royalist support. All the estates were sequestered because of these affiliations during the English Commonwealth and returned on the restoration of 1660. Humphrey IV died in 1663. His grandson, an MP, Sir Humphrey Forster, 2nd Baronet (c. 1649 – December 1711), died at the age of about 62 when the Baronetcy became extinct.

=== Congreve family inheritance (1752–1843) ===
In 1752 Forster direct descendants died out and the estate passed to Ralph Congreve as third husband of Sir Humphrey Forster, 2nd Baronet&#x27;s grand-niece and heir.

In 1780 the estate passed to his second cousin, William (a relation of the dramatist of the same name). Many changes to their estate occurred during the William&#x27;s ownership. The lake by the house was created by damming the stream. The wrought-iron Eagle Gates, at the north-west of the estate, were won at a game of cards so taken from Midgham. To install them, the estate&#x27;s north-west lodge (a dower house) was dissected (removing the centre section). The estate&#x27;s east gates are known as the Charity Gates; Congreve&#x27;s daughters frequently sat by the gates and gave alms to the poor.

In approximately 1800, Congreve had a stable block built due west of the house; this is extant and until the site&#x27;s vacancy was used office space.

William Congreve&#x27;s butler at Aldermaston House, John Manning, died on 31 August 1811. Congreve erected the headstone on his grave in the village churchyard.

On 13 January 1843, a serious fire destroyed more than a third of the manor house. William Congreve never recovered from the fire and died the same year. The Congreve name is retained in the name of a cul-de-sac in the village.

=== Burr family purchase and rebuilding (1849–1893) ===

Aldermaston Manor passed into the Court of Chancery, and was eventually purchased in 1849 by Daniel Higford Davall Burr. Since 1836, Burr had owned the Alvington manor in Gloucestershire (having inherited it upon his mother&#x27;s death). Her family, the Higford family, owned Alvington from the 17th century.

Burr was somewhat eccentric, keeping monkeys and snakes as pets. He commissioned Philip Charles Hardwick to build today&#x27;s edifice in a Neoclassical style; the present mansion house was built using as much of the old material as possible that had been saved from the fire.

Burr died on 29 November 1885 at the age of 74, and the estate passed to his son, Higford Higford (who, rather than taking his father&#x27;s surname, assumed the name of a distant ancestor). Higford only lived at Aldermaston for a few years before putting it up for sale. He sold Alvington in 1912.

=== Charles Keyser purchase (1893–1938) ===

In 1893, the estate was bought for £160,000 () by Charles Edward Keyser, a stockbroker and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Keyser, who was born on 10 September 1847 and came from Hertfordshire had previously established a successful career in the City of London, having gained a Master&#x27;s Degree in Law at Cambridge University. His accumulated wealth allowed him to specialise in his chosen area, and he became a distinguished figure in English church architecture, specialising in medieval churches.

Keyser&#x27;s attention was drawn to Aldermaston by his sister Agnes, who said that the court reminded her of her stay at Sandringham House. Keyser seized the opportunity to buy the estate when it was put up for sale at the Hind&#x27;s Head.

Keyser died in 1929, at the age of 81. His death certificate lists the place of death as Bucklebury. Keyser&#x27;s estate was valued at £770,000, resulting in an Inheritance Tax of £150,000. The lessened agricultural income from the estate was then less than the cost of its maintenance in 1929. Keyser&#x27;s wife, Mary died in 1938. Their son, Charles Norman, had no interest in running the estate and his heavy asthma led him to move to Adderbury, Oxfordshire. Muriel and Sybil, their daughters, had expensive taste with racehorses and ponies, and their brother sold the whole estate to a syndicate, Messrs Cribble, Booth and Shepherd, for £100,000 who auctioned it in lots at Reading Town Hall, beginning on 20 September 1939. Many of the lots were bought by their occupants. The house and its immediate grounds were bought by Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) for £16,000.

===Airfield and opening of AWRE (1939–1965)===
Despite the AEI purchase, the location was soon earmarked by the government for an airfield, RAF Aldermaston, to operate as a satellite field for RAF Andover. During World War II the land and house were requisitioned by the government as a barracks for the Women&#x27;s Land Army, the USAAF HQ XIX Tactical Air Command was for some months stationed at the house and anti-aircraft batteries were stationed in the grounds. After the war, the airfield remained in use and was run by BOAC, who operated it as a pilot training academy then from 1947 to 1950 as a civilian airport. Air use was transferred to Blackbushe and Luton Airports.

After the closure of the airfield, the park was returned to AEI. which used it as a plasma research laboratory. They built the now demolished MERLIN reactor between the house and the lake – the first commercial scientific reactor in Britain, which was opened on 6 November 1959 by the monarch&#x27;s husband, Prince Philip. The airfield became the UK&#x27;s Atomic Weapons Research Establishment—later the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE)—for research, commissioning and de-commissioning of most such weapons. Periodic UK opposition to nuclear weapons was in the late 20th century was most prominently expressed in the Aldermaston Marches from London and High Wycombe, with its later marches organised in 1972 and 2004.

===Commercial use (1965–2012)===
Collier Macmillan Schools bought the north area of the park, including the manor house, in 1965.) In 1967, the house and parkland became a Grade II* listed building and parkland. Blue Circle Industries bought the estate in the 1980s. They restored the house, and converted its usage into a hotel and conference centre. They also built the offices in the park, including Portland House, which won a Concrete Society award in 1986.

The house and grounds were purchased by Holaw (420) Ltd. in 1997, who under its former name, Aldermaston Manor, converted it to a hotel and conference centre. They appointed the Compass Group to operate these uses. The business was declared insolvent in 2012, and the house and office spaces were closed.

The tablet was discovered on 15 September 1851 by Petar Dorčić during paving of the Church of St. Lucy in Jurandvor near the village of Baška on the island of Krk. Already then a small part of it was broken.

Since 1934, the original tablet has been kept at the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Zagreb. Croatian archaeologist Branko Fučić contributed to the interpretation of Baška tablet as a left altar partition. His reconstruction of the text of the Baška tablet is the most widely accepted version today.

== Description ==
The Baška tablet is made of white limestone. It is 199 cm wide, 99.5 cm high, and 7.5–9 cm thick. It weighs approximately 800 kilograms. The tablet was installed as a partition between the altar and the rest of the church, specifically, it was left pluteus of the cancellus/septum (the right pluteus tablet is so-called &quot;Jurandvorski ulomci/Jurandvor fragments&quot; with four preserved pieces which were also found on the pavement, mentions name of Zvonimir, Croatia, Lucia, word &quot;opat&quot;, &quot;prosih&quot; and &quot;križ&quot;, has almost the same but smaller letters and it is also dated to the 11th and 12th century). According to historical sources the cancellus was preserved at least until 1752, when somewhere since then until before 1851 was destroyed and the tablet placed on the pavement of the church. A replica is in place in the church.

The inscribed stone slab records King Zvonimir&#x27;s donation of a piece of land to a Benedictine abbey in the time of abbot Držiha. The second half of the inscription tells how abbot Dobrovit built the church along with nine monks. The inscription is written in the Glagolitic script, exhibiting features of Church Slavonic of Croatian recension influenced by Chakavian dialect of Croatian language, such as writing &quot;(j)u&quot; for &quot;(j)ǫ&quot;, &quot;e&quot; for &quot;ę&quot;, &quot;i&quot; for &quot;y&quot;, and using one &quot;jer&quot; only (ъ). It also has several Latin and Cyrillic letters (i, m, n, o, t, v) which combination was still common for that period. It provides the only example of transition from Glagolitic of the rounded Bulgarian (old Slovak) type to the angular Croatian alphabet type.

=== Contents ===
The scholars who took part in deciphering of the Glagolitic text dealt with palaeographic challenges, as well as the problem of the damaged, worn-out surface of the slab. Through successive efforts, the contents were mostly interpreted before World War I, but remained a topic of study throughout the 20th century.

One of the most disputed parts of it is the mention of &quot;Mikula/Nicholas in Otočac&quot;, considered as a reference either to the church (and later monastery) of St. Mikula/Nicholas in Otočac in Northwestern part of Lika (but earliest historical mention dating to the 15th century), or to the toponym of St. Lucia&#x27;s estate of Mikulja in Punat on Krk which is an island (in Croatian island is &quot;otok&quot; with &quot;Otočac&quot; being a derivation), or somewhere else on Krk and its surroundings (like monastery of St. Nicholas near Omišalj, old churches of St. Nicholas in Bosar, Ogrul, Negrit or island of Susak). Lately, church historian Mile Bogović supported the thesis about St. Nicholas in Otočac because the Gregorian Reform during Zvonimir&#x27;s reign went from Croatian inland toward recently conquered Byzantine lands (Krk was one of the Dalmatian city-states part of the theme of Dalmatia), and linguist Valentin Putanec based on the definition of krajina in the dictionary by Bartol Kašić and Giacomo Micaglia (meaning coastline and inland of Liburnia) argued it shows connection between Benedictines in Krk and Otočac in Lika.

The transliterated text according to Branko Fučić (1960s, last update 1982–1985), with restored segments in square brackets, is as follows:

==Dating==

Several evidences show that the tablet is dated to the late 11th or early 12th century (c. 1100 CE). The tablet&#x27;s content suggests it was inscribed after the death of King Zvonimir (who died in 1089), since abbot Držiha describes Zvonimir&#x27;s donation as an event that happened further in the past (&quot;in his days&quot;). The Church of St. Lucy, described as having been built during the reign of count Kosmat (possibly identified with župan of Luka in 1070 or comes Kuzma who was in the entourage of Coloman, King of Hungary to Zadar in 1102) who ruled over whole &quot;Krajina&quot; (probably a reference to a local place on island of Krk or March of Dalmatia from the 1060s which was composed of part of Kvarner and the eastern coast of Istria), suggests the period of Croatian succession crisis of the 1090s and before the Venetian domination since 1116 and first mention of counts of Krk in 1118–1130 (later known as Frankopan family). Lujo Margetić considered it was erected by the same counts of Krk between 1105 and 1118. Desimir is identified with Desimir župan of Krbava mentioned in the 1078 charter of king Zvonimir, while Pribineg some scholars identified with Pirvaneg župan of Luka in 1059. Ornamental decoration of the tablet, and early Romanesque (11–12th century) features of the church of St. Lucy similar to three other churches founded by 1100 on Krk also show it is dated at the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries. Lately art historian Pavuša Vežić argued that the church is dated to the late Romanesque period (in the beginning of the 14th century) and Baška tablet text to 1300 with only ornamental decoration from 1100. Although new dating of the church was accepted by scholars like Margetić, they still considered it does not change the early 12th century dating of the whole tablet which features are &quot;hardly possible&quot; for the middle of the 12th century and &quot;unimaginable&quot; for the beginning of the 14th century.

Scholars argue that the textual background for the inscription was made in the period between abbot Držiha and Dobrovit, probably based on the church&#x27;s cartulary. It is considered that the fact it was inscribed at once as one unit (&quot;scriptura continua&quot;) rejects the thesis different rows were inscribed in two, three or four different periods as argued by Franjo Rački (two, 1078 and 1092–1102), Rudolf Strohal (four, between 1076 and 1120), Ferdo Šišić (two, until 1100), Vjekoslav Štefanić (three, between 1089 and 1116), Josip Hamm (three, 1077/1079, end of the 11th century and around 1100), Leo Košuta (three, similar to Hamm).

The meaning of the opening lines is contested. While some scholars interpret the introductory characters simply as &quot;Azъ&quot; (&quot;I&quot;), others believe that letters were also used to encode the year. There is no agreement, however, on the interpretation: 1100, 1077, 1079, 1105 and 1120 have been proposed.

==Significance==

The name of Croatia and King Zvonimir are mentioned on the tablet for the first time in Croatian.

Despite the fact of not being the oldest Croatian Glagolitic monument (the Plomin tablet, Valun tablet, Krk inscription, are older and appeared in the 11th century) and in spite of the fact that it was not written in the pure Croatian vernacular – it has nevertheless been referred to by Stjepan Ivšić as &quot;the jewel&quot; of Croatian, while Stjepan Damjanović called it &quot;the baptismal certificate of Croatian culture&quot;. It features a vaguely damaged ornamental string pattern, the Croatian interlace ().

The tablet was depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 100 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002, and on a postage stamp issued by Croatian Post in 2000.
