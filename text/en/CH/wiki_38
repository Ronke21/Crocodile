<text>Milo Goes to College is the debut studio album by the American punk rock band Descendents, released on September 4, 1982 through New Alliance Records. Its title refers to singer Milo Aukerman&#x27;s decision to leave the band to attend college, and its cover illustration introduced a caricature of him that would go on to become the band&#x27;s mascot.

The album&#x27;s mix of fast and aggressive hardcore punk with melody and semi-ironic love songs led to it being considered one of the most significant albums of the early 1980s southern California hardcore movement. In the decades since its release, it has received highly positive reviews and is now considered among the most noteworthy and important punk albums by several publications. &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; has been cited as influential and a favorite by several notable artists and musicians. It is considered by many to be a foundational record for the pop-punk genre.

==Writing==
The Descendents&#x27; 1981 &quot;Fat EP&quot; had established the band&#x27;s presence in the southern California hardcore punk movement with its short, fast, aggressive songs. While still short and fast, the songs the band wrote for their first full-length album were also melodic, described by singer Milo Aukerman as melodic hardcore. &quot;I think with those songs we were expanding beyond the kind of fast-fast-fast-fast thing&quot;, he later recalled. &quot;There are some of the similar coffee-driven songs, but I know that melodically there was actually an attempt at singing and making more pop-flavored music. Obviously we all really loved that, growing up with The Beatles and stuff.&quot; Drummer Bill Stevenson reflected that &quot;By the time we recorded &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; the pendulum swung somewhere maybe in the middle. There&#x27;s a lot of melodic and pop elements to it, but it also has that [sense of] bitter resentment.&quot;

All four band members made songwriting contributions to the album. Stevenson had written the lead track, &quot;Myage&quot;, several years earlier using a bass guitar he had found discarded in a trash bin. His song &quot;Bikeage&quot; is about &quot;a group of girls who were sort of turning into sluts&quot;, while &quot;Jean Is Dead&quot; deals with &quot;a girl who was not stable, but I had really not known.&quot; Fishing was a favorite hobby of Stevenson&#x27;s; &quot;Catalina&quot; describes a fishing trip to Santa Catalina Island, California. Guitarist Frank Navetta&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Loser&quot; expressed resentment and envy toward those he viewed as more attractive and successful, while &quot;Parents&quot; stemmed from his own familial discord, with lyrics such as &quot;They don&#x27;t even know I&#x27;m a boy / They treat me like a toy / But little do they know / That one day I&#x27;ll explode&quot;.

Bassist Tony Lombardo, some 20 years his bandmates&#x27; senior, wrote songs expressing his desire for stability and individuality. &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Punk&quot; reflected his disinterest in being part of the anarchic, destructive aspect of the punk scene: &quot;That whole thing turned me off. I just wanted to play the music and do it as best I could and I had a lot of fun doing that [...] It&#x27;s like &#x27;I&#x27;m Not a Punk&#x27;. I want to be my own person.&quot; &quot;Suburban Home&quot; was quite literal, expressing his desire for &quot;a house just like mom and dad&#x27;s&quot;: &quot;I definitely wanted a home. I couldn&#x27;t live in a place where all the people are cool. I don&#x27;t like dysfunctionality. I have an abhorrence of dysfunctionality because my mother was an alcoholic, my parents are divorced, I just don&#x27;t need that assault on my emotions and psyche.&quot;

==Recording, title, and cover art==
&quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; was recorded in June 1982 at Total Access Recording in Redondo Beach, California with Glen &quot;Spot&quot; Lockett, who had also engineered and produced the &quot;Fat EP&quot;. The title and cover illustration referenced Aukerman&#x27;s departure from the band to attend college; he enrolled at El Camino College for one year, then attended the University of California, San Diego from 1983 to 1985, where he studied biology. According to Stevenson, &quot;There was never the idea of Milo not being a scientist and Milo staying in the band. He was always real clear about being into his science first and foremost.&quot; A note on the back sleeve of the LP read &quot;In dedication to Milo Aukerman from the Descendents&quot;, and was signed by the other three members.
The cover illustration was done by Jeff &quot;Rat&quot; Atkinson, based on earlier caricatures drawn by Aukerman&#x27;s Mira Costa High School classmate Roger Deuerlein depicting Aukerman as the class nerd. Atkinson drew several versions of the character wearing different shirts, and Stevenson selected the version with the necktie for its collegiate look. The Milo character became a mascot for the band and was later reinterpreted by other artists for the covers of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot; (1985), &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; (1996), &quot;I&#x27;m the One&quot; (1997), &quot;When I Get Old&quot; (1997), &quot;&#x27;Merican&quot; (2004), &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; (2004), &quot;Hypercaffium Spazzinate&quot; (2016), and &quot;SpazzHazard&quot; (2016).

==Release==
&quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; was released through New Alliance Records, an independent record label run by D. Boon and Mike Watt of the San Pedro-based punk band the Minutemen, who were contemporaries of the Descendents. The album sold around one thousand copies locally from its initial pressings.

There was no tour to support the album. With Aukerman away at college, the Descendents recruited Ray Cooper as both singer and second guitarist and continued performing locally for a time during 1982 and 1983. They would occasionally perform as a quintet when Aukerman would join them during his return visits to Los Angeles. The band was mostly on hiatus for the next few years while Stevenson played in Black Flag. Guitarist and founding member Frank Navetta quit the band during this time, burning all his musical equipment and moving to Oregon to become a professional fisherman. The Descendents reconvened in 1985, with Cooper on guitar, for the recording of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot;.

In 1987, New Alliance was sold to SST Records, who re-released &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; on LP, cassette, and compact disc. It was also reissued in 1988 as part of the compilation album &quot;Two Things at Once&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; is cited as one of the most significant albums of the early-1980s southern California hardcore punk movement. Steven Blush, author of &quot;American Hardcore: A Tribal History&quot;, remarked that its &quot;cheeky love songs disguised as hardcore blasts became the most aped formula in rock.&quot; In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, critic Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;These fishermen don&#x27;t kid around about what powers hardcore hyperdrive—not simply an unjust society, but also a battered psyche. When they&#x27;re feeling bad, any kind of power—money, age, ass-man cool, the possession of a vagina—can set off their anarchic, patricidal, &#x27;homo&#x27;-baiting, gynephobic rage. But their bad feelings add poignant weight to the doomed vulnerability of the last four songs, which happen to be their hookiest&quot;. Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the album &quot;Perfect for the little guy who was ever called a nerd and never got the girl. The chainsaw pop combined with earthy humor conveys what is often an inarticulate rage.&quot; Hilburn&#x27;s review was especially affirming for Stevenson, whose father criticized and discouraged his songwriting: &quot;Robert Hillburn was saying something different. He was saying that I can write okay, that I&#x27;m a decent songwriter. So it served to shut my dad up a little bit, so that I could pursue the band thing a little less encumbered by his stifling attitude.&quot;

Retrospectively, Ned Raggett of AllMusic called it &quot;an unpretentious, catchy winner. The playing of the core band is even better than before, never mistaking increased skill with needing to show off; the Lombardo/Stevenson rhythm section is in perfect sync, while Navetta provides the corrosive power. Add in Aukerman&#x27;s in-your-face hilarity and fuck-off stance, and it&#x27;s punk rock that wears both its adolescence and brains on its sleeve.&quot; Jenny Eliscu of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;all straight-ahead punk — 15 songs in less than a half hour, each full of metally riffs and lightning-speed plucking by bassist Tony Lombardo, who was always the band&#x27;s secret weapon. Much like The Who, the Descendents often used the bass for melodies and the guitar to bash out a steady rhythm.&quot;

In an interview with Bobby Makar for Alternative Press, Aukerman and Stevenson recall not knowing whether &quot;Milo Goes To College&quot; would be popular with punk-rock audiences at the time, especially being that they refused to follow the style of English punk rock bands.[26.5] However, their the main driving force behind their music was to make music about anything they wanted to and hope the audience would find them interesting enough.[26.5] Viewing themselves as outsiders in their own little world, Stevenson recalled not traditionally singing about activism in their songs, &quot;Yeah. It’s like, yeah, Reagan does suck, but fuck, everybody already knows that. So now what are we going to talk about?&quot; [26.5] In hindsight, &quot;Milo Goes To College&quot; would become one of the most influential albums for spearheading the development of pop-punk, however, when the album first came out, Aukerman explained that, &quot;I felt like it didn’t really have an impact, although I did know that one person bought my record at that point. And so I was like, “OK, someone bought it. That’s cool.&#x27;&quot;[26.5]

==Impact and influence==
&quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; has been included in several lists of noteworthy punk albums. &quot;Spin&quot; has listed it several times, ranking it 74th in a 1995 list of the best alternative albums and 20th in a 2001 list of &quot;The 50 Most Essential Punk Records&quot;, and including it in a 2004 list of &quot;Essential Hardcore&quot; albums. In these lists, critic Simon Reynolds described the album as &quot;Fifteen Cali-core paroxysms that anatomize dork-dude pangs with haiku brevity&quot;, while Andrew Beaujon called it &quot;Super clean, super tight, super poppy hardcore about hating your parents, riding bikes, and not wanting to &#x27;smell your muff.&#x27; Obviously, Blink-182 owe this bunch of proud California losers &quot;everything&quot;.&quot; In 2006 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked it as the 33rd greatest punk album of all time. The &quot;LA Weekly&quot; ranked it the fourth greatest Los Angeles punk album of all time in a 2012 list, with Kai Flanders remarking &quot;Every song speaks to [the listener&#x27;s] teenage fucked-up-ness, from feeling incredibly horny to just wanting to hit someone for no reason.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album fourth in their list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Pop-Punk Albums&quot; in 2017, with critic Hank Shteamer writing that &quot;the trademark silly-sappy blend of &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; would become the blueprint for pop-punk as we know it.&quot;
Several notable artists and musicians cite &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; as a favorite and influence, including Mike Watt of the Minutemen, David Nolte of The Last, and Zach Blair of Hagfish, Only Crime, and Rise Against. Dave Grohl of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters opined that &quot;If the Descendents had made &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; in 1999, they’d be living in fucking mansions. That&#x27;s a fucking amazing record.&quot; Joey Cape of Lagwagon remarked that the album &quot;was just huge in punk and to me. I don&#x27;t think there would have been a [Lagwagon] song like &#x27;Angry Days&#x27; without that album.&quot; Fat Mike of NOFX has cited &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; as his favorite record of all time, and said that hearing the song &quot;Kabuki Girl&quot; on Rodney Bingenheimer&#x27;s &quot;Rodney on the ROQ&quot; program on KROQ-FM was a significant moment in his youth. Chris Shary, who has done artwork for the Descendents and their successor band, All, since 1998, remarked that &quot;From the minute that I heard the beginning it was like &#x27;this is the music that I have been waiting for. Photographer Glen E. Friedman, who photographed the band during the early 1980s, recalled that &quot;the album had just come out, and coincidentally I had my own little heartbreak as a teenager, and I heard that song &#x27;Hope&#x27; and I gotta say that I had never in my life related to a song about love ever before until I heard that song [...] I was just &#x27;Wow, this is fucking heavy. This guy&#x27;s hurting even more than I am, and this is desperation.&#x27; A whole new world opened up of a depth of emotion in music for me.&quot;

<text>Dan Rhodes (born 1972) is an English writer known for the novel &quot;Timoleon Vieta Come Home&quot; (2003), a subversion of the popular &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot; movie. He is also the author of &quot;&quot; (2000), a collection of 101 stories, each consisting of exactly 101 words. In 2010 he was awarded the E. M. Forster Award.

==Biography==
Rhodes grew up in Devon, and graduated in Humanities from the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales) in 1994, returning in 1997 to complete an MA in Creative Writing. &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me the Truth About Love&quot; was written at this time. He has held a variety of jobs, including stockroom assistant for Waterstones, barman in his parents&#x27; pub, and a teacher in Ho Chi Minh City. He has also worked on a fruit and vegetable farm and is still employed as a postman.

Following the publication of his second book, Rhodes&#x27;s frustration with the publishing industry led him to announce his retirement from writing, though he later said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t really given up. I&#x27;m certainly not making any more grand pronouncements. I was just sick of the business and wanted out. Not just the publishers; everyone around me.&quot; 

Rhodes was included on Granta&#x27;s Best of Young British Novelists list in 2003, to his own bemusement and frustration, partly because of Granta&#x27;s selection methods (&quot;It&#x27;s one thing to judge a writer by stuff they&#x27;ve written, but to judge them on stuff they&#x27;re going to write is lunacy&quot;) but also because some of the others on the list failed to respond to his request to sign a joint statement protesting the Iraq War.

In 2014, Rhodes self-published the novel &quot;When the Professor Got Stuck in the Snow&quot;, a &quot;rural farce&quot; about a visit to an obscure English village by a fictional Richard Dawkins, stating that he wanted to get the book out faster than conventional publishing allowed.

In 2021, Lightning Books published his novel &quot;Sour Grapes&quot;, a satire on the literary world set at a rural book festival.

Rhodes is married with two children.

<doc id="1020548" wikidata="Q7754039" url="?curid=1020548" title="The Nields">
<text>The Nields is a folk-rock band that started in 1991. As a five-piece band, they toured much of the United States, performing with artists such as Dar Williams, Moxy Früvous, 10,000 Maniacs, Ani DiFranco and Catie Curtis and appeared at many folk festivals. Two members, Katryna and Nerissa Nields, continue to tour as a folk duo. Full band performances still occur from time to time.

==History of the band==

The first incarnation of what would later become the Nields came together in 1987 in McLean, Virginia, when Nerissa Nields met David Jones, and started a band with Nerissa&#x27;s sister Katryna.

In 1991, Katryna had graduated from Trinity College in Connecticut, and Nerissa had graduated from Yale University. Nerissa married David, who was now known as David Nields, having taken her surname.
By now, the threesome was performing together as the Nields, with Katryna as the lead singer, Nerissa playing rhythm guitar and singing harmony, and David Nields on lead guitar. In 1992, the three of them moved to Connecticut, where David had accepted a job at the Loomis Chaffee School, and the band recorded its first album, the self-released &quot;66 Hoxsey Street&quot;, named for a house in Williamstown where they had lived. The band began to tour New England in earnest, earning a reputation in the regional folk music scene. In 1993, they released a live album titled &quot;Live at the Iron Horse Music Hall&quot;, recorded at the popular folk club in Northampton, Massachusetts.

In 1994 the band grew from a three-piece folk group to a five-piece rock band. The new members were Dave Chalfant (bass), whom Katryna had met in college, and Dave Hower (drums), a friend of Chalfant&#x27;s. Chalfant also produced the band&#x27;s album released that year, &quot;Bob on the Ceiling&quot;. This album featured a mix of the acoustic material that the Nields had previously specialized in and a more rock-oriented sound that would become their trademark. With their new sound, the Nields received critical acclaim, and quit their day jobs to become full-time musicians.

Their 1995 EP &quot;Abigail&quot;, named for Katryna and Nerissa&#x27;s sister, was self-released, followed by &quot;Gotta Get Over Greta&quot; in 1996 on the independent Razor &amp; Tie record label. The album was re-released in 1997 with three bonus tracks on Guardian, a division of Elektra Records.

Unfortunately, the group suffered a number of setbacks the next year. Guardian folded, leaving them without a record label, and their tour van was growing increasingly unreliable. The band self-released an album called &quot;Mousse&quot; (the nickname for Dave Chalfant&#x27;s sister Andromache) and held a special fundraising concert entitled &quot;Jam for the Van.&quot; As a result, the Nields were able to purchase a new van, and were also able to secure a new label, Zoë, a division of Rounder Records. Over the next three years, the Nields released two more records (&quot;Play&quot; and &quot;If You Lived Here You&#x27;d Be Home Now&quot;), and in 1999 Katryna Nields and Dave Chalfant got married.

Although the band enjoyed a moderate degree of success, they ceased touring as a five-piece in 2001. Their final recording with David Nields was a two-disc album titled &quot;Live From Northampton.&quot; Like their 1993 album, it was recorded at the Iron Horse Music Hall, and was self-released by the band. In 2002, David and Nerissa Nields were divorced.

==Katryna and Nerissa Nields as a duo==

In 1998, Katryna and Nerissa were invited to play Lilith Fair as a duo. The performances were successful, and the two sisters performed several more shows together in areas where the full band had not previously been able to tour. Dar Williams dubbed this the &quot;probe effect,&quot; a reference to Star Trek&#x27;s Enterprise sending a probe to unexplored areas.

By 2001, shows by the full band were increasingly rare, as Katryna and Nerissa toured mostly by themselves. In mid-2001, Katryna took some time off to have a baby, Amelia. Afterwards, she and Nerissa recorded their first album as a duo, titled &quot;Love and China&quot;, followed by an EP of children&#x27;s songs, &quot;Songs for Amelia&quot;. In 2004, they released their second full album, &quot;This Town is Wrong&quot;. In 2005, Nerissa&#x27;s young adult novel, &quot;Plastic Angel&quot;, was published by Scholastic Books. &quot;This Town Is Wrong&quot; was intended as a soundtrack to the novel, which came packaged with a CD containing the songs &quot;This Town Is Wrong&quot; and &quot;Glow-In-The-Dark Plastic Angel&quot; from the album.

==Current status==

Katryna and Nerissa live in the Pioneer Valley of Massachusetts and continue to make music and perform together. They have continued touring as a duo, although they have occasionally performed shows as a full band. In their &#x27;full-band&#x27; shows, they are joined by Dave Hower on drums, Paul Kochanski on bass, and Dave Chalfant on guitar. In July 2007, they released &quot;Sister Holler&quot;, an ode to the folk canon. In August 2008 they released &quot;Rock All Day Rock All Night&quot;, a double family album. In 2010, they made a family DVD called &quot;Organic Farm&quot;. In 2012, their 16th CD &quot;The Full Catastrophe&quot; came out, reflecting their recent lives as artist/mothers and the challenges of living with the myth of &quot;having it all.&quot; They released the album &quot;XVII&quot; in 2015 and a Christmas album, &quot;Joy to the World&quot; in 2017. The single, “Tyrants Always Fall” was also released in 2017.

In addition to making music, Nerissa has been teaching guitar, leading writing workshops, and working on a second novel, titled &quot;The Big Idea&quot;. In May 2005, she married Tom Duffy, a writer. On May 3, 2006, Nerissa gave birth to her first child, Lila Mary Nields-Duffy. John Patrick Thomas Nields-Duffy followed on August 23, 2008.

In November 2004, Katryna gave birth to her second child, a son named William John Chalfant.

Katryna and Nerissa lead a popular children&#x27;s singing class called Hootenanny, which draws new pre-school-aged fans to their already substantial grassroots following.

Dave Hower plays drums with a variety of bands, including Winterpills, Spanish for Hitchhiking, and The Fucking Sparklies.

Dave Chalfant has opened a recording studio and produced albums by a number of artists. He was also a teacher of Instrumental Music at the Academy at Charlemont in Charlemont, Massachusetts.

David Nields became the Theatre Director for the Imperial Centre of Arts and Sciences in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Currently, he teaches Theater at the college level.

<doc id="1020549" wikidata="Q937975" url="?curid=1020549" title="Sailor Moon musicals">
<text>The , commonly referred to as , are a series of live theatre productions based on the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga by Naoko Takeuchi. The series consists of 40 musicals which have had more than 800 performances since the show opened in the summer of 1993. The first set of musicals, which ran from 1993 to 2005, were produced by Bandai with over 500 performances. The current musicals have been produced by Nelke Planning (a subsidiary of Dwango) since 2013.

== History ==
Each musical typically runs for three engagements per year, timed to align with school holidays in the winter, spring, and summer. Musicals were historically staged at the Sunshine Theatre in Ikebukuro, Tokyo in the winter and spring, and tour Japan in the summer.

After was staged in January 2005, the actresses for Moon, Mercury, and Jupiter &quot;graduated&quot; (left the show), and the series went on hiatus.

In June 2013, Takeuchi&#x27;s editor Fumio Osano announced that a new &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; musical, &quot;La Reconquista&quot;, would open in September 2013, with Takeuchi personally auditioning actresses for the cast. The cast featured Satomi Ōkubo as Sailor Moon, Miyabi Matsuura as Sailor Mercury, Kanon Nanaki as Sailor Mars, Yū Takahashi as Sailor Jupiter, Shiori Sakata as Sailor Venus, and Yūga Yamato as Tuxedo Mask, making &quot;La Reconquista&quot; the first Sailor Moon musical where all roles were played by women. The musical recounts the battles between the Sailor Soldiers and the Dark Kingdom over the search for the Silver Crystal. The musical was produced, directed and written by Takuya Hiramitsu, who directed SeraMyu from 1995 to 1998, with music by Toshihiko Sahashi. The musical ran from September 13 to 23 at the AiiA Theater Tokyo in Shibuya, Tokyo.

&quot;Petite Étrangère&quot;, a musical based on &quot;Sailor Moon R&quot;, ran at AiiA Theater Tokyo from August 21 to August 31, 2014, and at Osaka from September 5 to September 7. A version of &quot;Petite Étrangère&quot; was staged in Shanghai, China, in January 2015 at the Shanghai Theatre Academy Theatre for a run of five performances, making &quot;Petite Étrangère&quot; the first official Japanese production of a Sailor Moon musical to open outside Japan.

The series made its North America debut in 2019 with &quot;Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon - The Super Live&quot;, which was staged as a limited engagement on March 29 and 30 at the PlayStation Theater in New York City. The musical also played at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., on March 24. The show debuted in London at Outernet London in February 2024. 

==Recurring elements==
The musicals typically feature a theme song, usually performed after the Sailor Soldiers defeat the antagonist; sight gags (such as cross-dressing and puns); and songs tailored for characters or groupings of characters, such as romantic songs between Usagi Tsukino and Mamoru Chiba, attack songs for the Sailor Soldiers, songs the Sailor Soldiers perform as civilians, and villain songs.

&quot;Revised Versions&quot; (known as &quot;Kaiteiban&quot;) are another major aspect of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; musicals. Generally, new musicals are staged in the summer are revised for the winter. The overarching plot remains the same, but certain plot elements are rearranged: villains who were only partially defeated in the original version of the show are fully defeated or healed, and actresses who are &quot;graduating&quot; are given more solo parts or speaking lines.
Often, the musicals expand upon plot concepts presented in the anime and manga. Most notably, a romance between the four Sailor Soldiers and the Four Kings of Heaven in their former lives was adapted from a manga image picturing the two groups paired off as romantic couples. In addition to adapting material from anime and manga versions of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, the musical series also has two original plot lines: The Legend of Kaguya Island &quot;(&quot;かぐや島伝説&quot;)&quot; and the &quot;Last Dracul&quot; (series.

Most shows end with an extended curtain call and encore, during which a number of songs are performed. Popular songs from the anime series such as &quot;Moonlight Densetsu&quot; and &quot;La Soldier&quot;, which would not make narrative sense in the plot of the musical, are frequently performed as fan service. Special fan appreciation shows referred to as &quot;FanKan&quot; (deriving from &quot;fan thank you&quot;) are used as season finales, where multiple fan service numbers are performed and new actresses are introduced.

The musicals have introduced new characters to the series, often as new members of existing groups of villains, such as Spotted Tilmun, Aaron and Manna from the Black Moon Clan, the Death Mannetjes and the Death Nightmares from the Death Busters, and Sailors Pewter Fox, Titanium Kerokko, Theta, and Buttress from Shadow Galactica. The musicals have also created original characters that have never appeared in any other version of the series, such as Sailor Astarte, Vulcan, Count Dracul, Bloody Dracul Vampir, Undead Berserk, and Death Lamia, among others.

==Production==
The sets and backdrops range from simple (only some set pieces, no backdrop or backdrop with uncomplicated paintings) to mid elaborate (a greater number of small set pieces, and some bigger ones, for example, a painted wall over the whole width of the stage with a few attached stairs and a big door), more detailed set pieces, with heavy use of different stage levels, trapdoors and hidden doors. The Sailor Soldiers&#x27; attacks are represented by colored lights hitting their targets, and sometimes minor explosions and other small pyrotechnics (for example &quot;flame paper&quot;, special paper stripes which the actors ignite in their hands and then throw to create the illusion of a &quot;fireball&quot;) are used. The Sailor Soldiers mostly transform off-stage (or just appear already transformed), while their transformation phrases can be heard. Only Usagi transforms on stage. This is done with the help of a body double and the &quot;black out&quot; of part of the stage or set pieces moving in front of her while the actors switch places. The only real &quot;transformation sequence&quot; that ever occurs is a pre-filmed video sequence projected onto a scrim showing the actors &quot;morph&quot; (with some pink ribbons) into their transformed versions.

== List of musicals ==
&quot;Stage&quot; is a term used widely to refer to groupings of the musicals.

Bandai, the producers of the first 12 years of Sailor Moon musical productions, divided their musical productions into three stages. The first stage consisted of those in which Sailor Moon was portrayed by Anza Ohyama, the first and longest running Sailor Moon actress. This stage ran parallel to the manga and anime, as reflected by the plot, and had a nearly full graduation with all of the main actresses being replaced. The second stage included three different Sailor Moon actresses, the only fully original musical (&quot;The Legend of Kaguya Island&quot;) and the semi-original &quot;Last Dracul&quot; series, ending with a remake of the original &quot;Final First Stage&quot; musical, &quot;Eien Densetsu&quot; (titled &quot;Kakyuu Ouhi Kourin&quot;.) The third stage retained Marina Kuroki as lead actress, but ran for only two musicals (both remakes of &quot;The Legend of Kaguya Island&quot;), and ended in January 2005.

The series resumed after a hiatus with the 20th Anniversary Stage in 2013, featuring Satomi Ōkubo as the new Sailor Moon. Unlike previous productions, these musicals, now overseen by Nelke Planning, were not categorized into distinct official stages..

Conversely, most Western fans break the stages down by the actresses who played Sailor Moon: 
Anza Ohyama, Fumina Hara, Miyuki Kanbe, and Marina Kuroki. The list below is divided up according to the official stages used by Sera Myu producers.

<doc id="1020565" wikidata="Q55080106" url="?curid=1020565" title="Mixed Reality (album)">
<text>Mixed Reality is the sixth studio album by American alternative rock band Gin Blossoms. It was released on June 15, 2018, on Cleopatra Records.

==Recording and release==
The band&#x27;s longtime producer John Hampton died in 2014 and while they toured to promote the 25th anniversary of their most successful album, &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;, the band members met Don Dixon at a show in Ohio. They discussed recording together and entered Dixon&#x27;s recording partner Mitch Easter&#x27;s studio in October 2016. Vocalist Robin Wilson says that the sessions for the album were &quot;really inspired.&quot; The band spent about a year writing songs and doing demos before recording the album. Wilson calls &quot;Mixed Reality&quot; &quot;sort of a companion&quot; to &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot; and says, &quot;It feels to me like a record we would have all wanted to make when we were 25.&quot;

The band released &quot;Break&quot; as a lead single and followed the release with a tour that was documented on their Chicago date, where they played this album and &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot; in their entirety.

<doc id="1020572" wikidata="Q5265893" url="?curid=1020572" title="Detroit Country Day School">
<text>Detroit Country Day School (also known as DCD, DCDS, or Country Day) is a private, secular school located in three campuses in Oakland County, in the U.S. state of Michigan, north of Detroit. The administrative offices, facility services, safety and security services, and the upper school (Grades 9-12) are situated in a campus in Beverly Hills. The middle school (Grades 4-8) is also located in Beverly Hills, seamlessly connected to the upper school. Additionally, the Lower School (PK-3) is situated in Bloomfield Township, near Bloomfield Hills. These campuses collectively provide a comprehensive educational experience.

DCDS was founded in Detroit in 1914 by Alden Shaw inspired by the Country Day School movement. The school&#x27;s motto is &quot;Mens Sana in Corpore Sano&quot;, a Latin phrase meaning &quot;Sound Mind in a Sound Body&quot;. The school colors are blue and gold.

==History==
Founder, F. Alden Shaw was born to Charles Joseph Shaw and Elizabeth Gahring Shaw in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota on December 20, 1885. Mr. Shaw graduated from the prestigious Boston Latin School in 1905 and Harvard College in 1909. He moved to Paris, France and enrolled in L&#x27;Ecole des Hautes Etudes, and began raising funds and recruiting students to begin his dream of founding a private school for boys. He soon realized that circumstances in Paris made founding a school an unreasonably daunting task; he decided to return to the United States. On the ship back to America, Mr. Shaw recalls an acquaintance raving about the wondrous opportunities in the blossoming American city of Detroit, Michigan and decided to build a school there.

In the spring of 1914, F. Alden Shaw, under the name &quot;Detroit Preparatory School&quot;, submitted the following advertisement to the local paper:

Mr. F. Alden Shaw, A.B. (Harvard 1909), announces that September next, he will open a small school for boys. Having had experience as a teacher in Boston, and as a private tutor in the families of Mr. George Lee of Boston, and Mr. Edwin D. Morgan of New York, he comes to Detroit, where there would seem to be a larger field for him. Referring by permission to Reverend Eugene Rodman Shippin, Mr. D. Stearns of Fredrick Stearns and Company and to Mr. Charles Moore, Security Trust Company, Detroit, Michigan. (For appointments address F. A. Shaw, Care Y.M.C.A., Detroit, Michigan.)

== Academics ==
The Detroit Country Day Upper School offers a strong and varied program that provides numerous opportunities for students to demonstrate their individual strengths and develop their potential. The rigorous college-preparatory program, which includes Honors and Advanced Placement courses in each discipline in addition to a diverse selection of electives, prepares students for the college and university setting. In addition to a series of honors and Advanced Placement courses, students at Detroit Country Day Upper School may pursue an International Baccalaureate Diploma. Most graduating classes consist of 140 to 180 students, 100% of which are accepted at accredited four-year colleges and universities. From the start of Freshman year, Upper School students participate yearly in standardized testing, beginning with the PLAN in 9th grade to the PSAT in 10th and 11th grade to finally, the ACT and/or SAT during the 11th and 12th grade. The College Counseling Office hosts yearly College Night for every grade to keep students and parents informed about the college application process. Every year, numerous Country Day students achieve National Merit Semi-finalist and Finalist status.

== Athletics ==
Extracurricular activities are required at DCDS. Under the &quot;points system&quot;, these requirements are tracked by the accumulation of blue points (athletics), gold points (clubs) and white points (service).

In March 2004 the Michigan High School Athletic Association recommended that DCDS voluntarily forfeit three state basketball championships won between 1989 and 1991, claiming that former DCDS star Chris Webber had violated his amateur status via his relationship with University of Michigan athletic booster Ed Martin. DCDS declined to follow the MHSAA&#x27;s suggestion.

== Arts ==
Detroit Country Day School offers an active fine and performing arts program, celebrated every April through &quot;Celebrate the Arts&quot; weekend at the Upper School campus.

<doc id="1020586" wikidata="Q7712049" url="?curid=1020586" title="The ABC Sunday Night Movie">
<text>The ABC Sunday Night Movie is a television program that aired on Sunday nights, first for a brief time in 1962 under the title &quot;Hollywood Special&quot; (although &quot;Time&quot; magazine lists this version as &quot;The Sunday Night Movie&quot;) to supposedly replace an open time slot for the TV show &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, which was cancelled after March 1962. It then began airing regularly under its more commonly known title from late 1964 to 1998, on ABC. Since 2004, it has aired sporadically as a special program, now titled the &quot;ABC Sunday Movie of the Week&quot;, though as of the 2011-12 television season, the only films in this timeslot were aired under the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; banner, which transferred to ABC in that season. However, in 2014, &quot;The Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; moved exclusively to cable on the Hallmark Channel. As a result of this, the &quot;Sunday Night Movie&quot; is now exclusively relegated to two special holiday movies, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; every holiday season and &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; every Easter.

&quot;The ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot; was replaced in 1998 with &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; although the &quot;Sunday Night Movie&quot; initially continued to air alongside &quot;TWWOD&quot; for its final season.

==History==
Encouraged by the ratings success on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;, ABC initially purchased 15 United Artists films released in the late 1950s for its April 1962 premiere. United Artists Television also provided some short featurettes promoting upcoming United Artists cinema releases to fill out some films that ended before the two hour time slot finished.

===Edits for television===
The program presented theatrical feature films airing on TV for the first time. The feature films were edited for content, to remove objectionable material, and for time - one such instance was the first network telecast in 1962 of John Huston&#x27;s 1956 film &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, a Warner Bros. film which runs 117 minutes uncut, and yet was shown in a two-hour time slot with commercials. In many cases, however, the broadcast was expanded from two to two-and-a-half hours to fit a film&#x27;s longer running time, as in the two 1966 network telecasts of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Carousel&quot; (a 1956 film not to be confused with the 1967 videotaped television adaptation of the musical, also broadcast by ABC). The first major network showing of &quot;Superman&quot; in 1982 was broadcast in two parts with previously unused footage. Extra footage was also added to the ABC broadcast of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; in 1983, &quot;Superman II&quot; in 1984 and &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; in 1985.

Because the concept of letterboxing films for television had not been introduced yet, the films shown were also pan-and-scanned so the image would fit the standard 4:3 television screen.

===James Bond franchise===
In 1972, ABC bought the broadcasting rights to the James Bond franchise (also by United Artists). The first film broadcast was &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. Unlike the British broadcasts of the James Bond films, the franchise was not presented in production order.

ABC made edits to the Bond films for violence, sexual content, and so that the films would fit in the time allotted, but perhaps the most controversial of these was the re-edit of the 1969 film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; broadcast on the &quot;ABC Monday Night Movie&quot;. Broadcast on February 16 and February 23, 1976, the edit involved the film being split into two for a two-night broadcast while including a voiceover (primarily for the first showing) meant to sound like George Lazenby that starts with the ski chase scene before including flashbacks to prior scenes. A subsequent re-airing of the film years later showed it in a three-hour time slot with no edits.

ABC held the rights to the James Bond films until 1990, when &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; was the final film aired prior to Turner Broadcasting buying the TV rights to the franchise. The Bond films have also aired on several cable channels not owned by Turner. ABC broadcast the films again as a promotional tie-in when &quot;Die Another Day&quot; was in theaters in 2002, dubbed as &quot;The Bond Picture Show&quot; on Saturday nights.

===&quot;ABC Sunday Movie Special&quot;===
Occasionally, &quot;The ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot; would telecast what they termed an ABC Sunday Movie Special when a film presentation was over three hours or overflowed prime time. When the movie in question was a family film, the telecasts would begin at an earlier hour, so that the film would end at around 11:00 p.m, enabling younger viewers to watch without having to stay up too late. The Movie Specials invariably consisted of blockbusters, such as &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;The Robe&quot;, &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. The last-named film continues its television career on ABC today, having become, like &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, an annual television tradition. It is usually shown during the Palm Sunday or Easter weekend (&quot;The Robe&quot;, which made its TV debut in 1968, had been shown on Easter weekends by ABC prior to being sold to local television stations). The telecast of &quot;Patton&quot;, which took place in 1972 at 9 P.M. E.S.T., was remarkably mature, in that very little of the film&#x27;s profanity was cut for television.

ABC would occasionally telecast &quot;Movie Special&quot;s on other days of the week as well, among them &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, and &quot;Godspell&quot; (which was shown on network television as a Thanksgiving season special in 1974).

===Method of presenting films throughout the 1960s===
Beginning in 1965, &quot;The ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot; used a rather unusual method of presenting the films that movie series on other networks did not use. Except on rare occasions, such as the aforementioned &quot;Movie Specials&quot;, or films which already had a pre-credits sequence that led directly into the main title and so could not be altered, the opening credits of the particular film in question generally would not be shown until after the movie had ended. Instead, a teaser from the film was shown, whereupon an offscreen announcer (e.g. Joel Crager) would say the name of the film and its stars, and then the credit The ABC Sunday Night Movie would appear. A commercial would then follow, and when the program started up again, one would see the screenwriter and the director&#x27;s names respectively - superimposed over the film&#x27;s opening scene in credits manufactured by ABC. At film&#x27;s end, another commercial would follow, after which, somewhat anti-climactically, the movie&#x27;s actual opening credits, together with the studio logo, would then be presented exactly as they were originally made, as if the film were starting up again.

&quot;The ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot; was also famous in the mid 1970s for its theme music and brightly colored marquee. The opening has been parodied on the G4 network under the title &quot;Movies That Don&#x27;t Suck&quot;.

===Other nights and methods of presentation===
From 1968 to 1970, ABC ran a concurrent movie series on Wednesday nights, under the title The ABC Wednesday Night Movie.

A Tuesday night ABC Movie of the Week featuring only made-for-TV movies was added in 1969. The series was renamed Tuesday Movie of the Week and a Wednesday night Wednesday Movie of the Week, also presenting only made-for-TV films, was added in 1972. Both series continued until 1975.

From 1975 to 1983 (and again, briefly, in 1999) ABC ran a concurrent movie series on Friday nights, under the title The ABC Friday Night Movie.

Other concurrent movie series during that time also aired on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

During the 1980s, films with more mature and politically charged themes, such as &quot;The Day After&quot; and &quot;Consenting Adult&quot; (homosexuality) aired under the &quot;ABC Theater&quot; banner.

Beginning in 1999, a Saturday night variant on the formula began, and has been somewhat of a ratings favorite. However, and more importantly nowadays, the ratings have varied from week to week. Since 1999, The &quot;ABC Saturday Night Movie&quot; has alternated with random repeats, &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; (up until 2008), and &quot;Saturday Night Football&quot;, which runs from the first Saturday in September, up into the first of December. Movies also alternate on various other nights of the week, for sweeps and also as holiday-based programming, such as the annual pre-Easter telecast of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;.

===Announcers===
For many years, until the early 1980s, the announcer for all of ABC&#x27;s movie shows was network staff announcer Joel Crager. Afterwards, the duties would be handled first by Ernie Anderson, and then others, including Gary Owens (with the announcer depending on the film&#x27;s tone; Owens would do so for comedies).

===Decline due to the advent of cable networks===
The advent of such cable television networks as HBO, Cinemax, Showtime and The Movie Channel (all of which broadcast theatrical films on cable before they appear on commercial television), along with the emergence of various home video formats, led to the decline of theatrical films regularly airing on commercial network TV. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, print ads for &quot;The ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot; regularly played up the quality of the film being offered to viewers at no cost (&quot;Another Great Film Not On Pay TV&quot;). Whereas one used to be able to see a relatively recent theatrical film on prime time commercial network television every night of the week, this is now done only occasionally (or, in the case of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Movie of the Week&quot;, only when the network has no other sports commitments, usually confined to holiday weekends). Only cable networks exclusively devoted to films, such as AMC or Turner Classic Movies, show theatrical films in prime time every night; the big three networks, including the newer Fox network no longer follow this practice, except perhaps on holidays. The grand opening sequences of the past are now usually eschewed by merely mentioning the airing title in an &#x27;up next&#x27; sequence, or a direct cut to a disclaimer noting the film has been edited and presented for a broadcast television presentation with the assumption viewers have already viewed the basic electronic program guide information for the film.

<doc id="1020589" wikidata="Q241791" url="?curid=1020589" title="Bracciano">
<text>Bracciano is a small town in the Italian region of Lazio, northwest of Rome. The town is famous for its volcanic lake (Lago di Bracciano or &quot;Sabatino&quot;, the eighth largest lake in Italy) and for a particularly well-preserved medieval castle Castello Orsini-Odescalchi. The lake is widely used for sailing and is popular with tourists; the castle has hosted a number of events, especially weddings of actors and singers.

The town is served by an urban railway (Line FR3) which connects it with Rome (stations of Ostiense and Valle Aurelia) in about 55 minutes. Close to it lie the two medieval towns of Anguillara Sabazia and Trevignano Romano.

==Geography==

Bracciano&#x27;s territory lies on the western edge of the Sabatine Hills, a low volcanic hills range encircling Lake Bracciano.

==History==
There is no certain information about the origins of Bracciano, on the Via Cassia overlooking the lake. It probably rose from one of the numerous towers built in the tenth century as a defence against the Saracen attacks, as implied by the ancient name of &quot;Castrum Brachiani&quot;. In the eleventh century the neighbouring territory was acquired by the Prefetti di Vico family, who turned the tower into a castle. Ferdinand Gregorovius dated the possession of Bracciano by the Orsini to 1234. The area was later acquired by the Roman hospital of Santo Spirito in Sassia and, from 1375, was a Papal possession.

In 1419 the Colonna Pope Martin V confirmed the fief of Bracciano in the Orsini family branch of Tagliacozzo. Under this powerful family the city developed into a flourishing town, famous in the whole of Italy for its castle, which was enlarged, starting from 1470, by Napoleone Orsini and his son Virginio. In 1481 it housed Pope Sixtus IV, who had fled from the plague in Rome; the &quot;Sala Papalina&quot; in one of the corner towers commemorates the event. Four years later, however, the city and the castle were ravaged by Papal troops under Prospero Colonna, and subsequently a new line of walls was built.

In 1494 Charles VIII of France and his troops marching against Rome stopped at Bracciano. This act led to the excommunication of the Orsini, and in 1496 the city was besieged by a papal army headed by Giovanni di Candia, son of Pope Alexander VI Borgia, though it resisted successfully. Cesare Borgia, another of Alexander&#x27;s natural sons, was unsuccessful in his attempt to take the Orsini stronghold a few years later. The sixteenth century was a period of splendour for Bracciano. The notorious spendthrift and libertine Paolo Giordano I Orsini, having married in 1558 Isabella de&#x27; Medici, daughter of Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, received the title of duke of Bracciano in 1560. The &quot;castello&quot; received some modernization for the brief visit of the Medici that year. He hired the most prestigious painter available in Rome, Taddeo Zuccaro, to fresco with allegories and coats-of-arms the fortress&#x27;s most prestigious room, the &quot;Sala Papalinia&quot; that had been occupied by Sixtus IV. Isabella spent the remainder of her life avoiding a return to the castle, which a modern tourist tradition would have her haunting.

The economy was boosted by the exploitation of sulphur and iron, the production of tapestries and paper. The latter was favoured by the construction of an aqueduct whose ruins can still be seen in the city. Bracciano in this period had some 4,500 inhabitants.

However, the expensive tenor of life of the Orsini eventually damaged the economic conditions of the city. The last great ruler was probably Paolo Giordano II, a patron of arts and literature who made Bracciano a center of culture in Italy. The decline culminated in 1696 when the castle was sold to Livio Odescalchi, nephew of Pope Innocent XI; the Odescalchi family still retain the castle.

In the castle, richly frescoed friezes and ceilings now contrast with blank walls, which were hung with richly coloured tapestries when the lords of Bracciano were in residence. The important late-15th century frieze showing the labours of Hercules is still visible.
The main economic activities are tourism, services and agriculture. Until the twentieth century the region was notoriously unhealthy for its malaria, now eradicated; as a result, none of the fine villas were built at the water&#x27;s edge, but all stood on healthier rises of ground.

==Main sights==
The main monument of Bracciano is its castle, Castello Orsini-Odescalchi, one of the most noteworthy examples of Renaissance military architecture in Italy.

 outside the city, alongside the road leading to Trevignano Romano, is the ancient church of &quot;San Liberato&quot; (ninth century). It occupies what was once the Roman settlement of &quot;Forum Clodii&quot;, now surrounded by an herb garden, part of the complex of English-style gardens at the adjoining Villa San Librato, designed by Russell Page in 1965 for the art historian conte Donato Sanminatelli and his contessa, Maria Odescalchi, and carried out over the following decade.

On the same road are the ruins of the &quot;Aquae Apollinaris&quot;, a complex of baths famous in the Roman age.

At Vigna di Valle, next to the lake, the former seaplane base today houses the Italian Air Force Museum. The museum&#x27;s four hangars hold a number of historical military aircraft, including famous planes such as the MC. 202, the Supermarine Spitfire, the Savoia Marchetti S.79, the F-104 Starfighter, the Caproni Ca.100 and the Panavia Tornado. Also on view is a remarkable collection of three Schneider Cup racers, including the Macchi M.C.72. The museum stages an annual &#x27;Giornata Azzura&#x27; airshow at Pratica di Mare airport.

==Climate==
The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Csa&quot; (Mediterranean climate).

==Twin towns==
Bracciano is twinned with
* Neusäß, Germany
* Châtenay-Malabry, France
* Wolaita Sodo, Ethiopia

==Filmography==
* TV series (Castle Bracciano).
* Elisa di Rivombrosa

<text>Luxi is a family of typefaces originally designed for the X Window System by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow from &quot;Bigelow &amp; Holmes Inc&quot;. The Luxi typefaces are similar to Lucida – their previous font design.

Luxi fonts were once commonly distributed with free software operating systems, such as Linux. They were featured as the default fonts for Red Hat&#x27;s Bluecurve theme. Released under a licence which permits free distribution but not modification, the Luxi fonts are not free software. This led to their removal from Debian package of XFree86 as well as Fedora.

== Typefaces ==
* Luxi Sans, a family of four sans-serif fonts.
* Luxi Serif, a family of four serif fonts.
* Luxi Mono, a family of four monospace fonts.

== History ==
* Only version 1.2 (created on 2001-10-12) is available.
* Inititially, they appeared as Type 1 fonts under the name Lucidux in XFree86 4.0 (released on 2000-03-08, added to XFree86 3.9.18Za a day earlier).
* They are available as TTF fonts since XFree86 4.2.0 (18 January 2002); they were added to the XFree86 source tree on 12 December 2001 (XFree86 4.1.99.2).

<text>The Jefferson Seminary was one of Kentucky&#x27;s first schools and is considered to be the direct ancestor of the University of Louisville.

The school was chartered by the Kentucky General Assembly in 1798, with the sale of 6,000 acres (24 km2) of land in rural southern Kentucky used to pay for initial construction. Eight prominent citizens of the fledgling village of Louisville (then the second largest city on the Falls of the Ohio River) met together on April 3, 1798, to seek donations for the school and to arrange for its board of trustees and faculty. &quot;No religious connotation was implied by the term seminary.&quot;

The process of establishing the school was slow, with a school house finally being built at the present day intersection of 8th Street and Muhammad Ali Boulevard sometime between 1813 and 1816. Its first principal was Edward Mann Butler, one of Kentucky&#x27;s most prominent educators and a man who later became the state&#x27;s most trusted historian. The school offered both high school and college level courses in English, geography, French, Latin, geometry, and trigonometry. It had an average of 45 to 50 students, who paid $20 for a six-month term.

Despite the school&#x27;s early success, pressure from newly established public schools would force its closure in 1829. Criticism from what became &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; also aided the closing, with its editor, Shadrach Penn Jr., who editorialized that the school &quot;was elitist and didn&#x27;t give Louisville&#x27;s school children a practical education.&quot;

<doc id="1020594" wikidata="Q755313" url="?curid=1020594" title="Polo shirt">
<text>A polo shirt, tennis shirt, golf shirt, or chukker shirt is a form of shirt with a collar. Polo shirts are usually short sleeved but can be long; they were used by polo players originally in India in 1859 and in Great Britain during the 1920s.

Polo shirts are usually made of knitted cotton (rather than woven cloth), usually a piqué knit, or less commonly an interlock knit (the latter used frequently, though not exclusively, with pima cotton polos), or using other fibers such as silk, wool, synthetic fibers, or blends of natural and synthetic fibers. A dress-length version of the shirt is called a polo dress.

== History of the tennis shirt ==
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, tennis players ordinarily wore &quot;tennis whites&quot; consisting of long-sleeved white button-up shirts (worn with the sleeves rolled up), flannel trousers, and ties. This attire presented problems for ease of play and comfort.

René Lacoste, the French seven-time Grand Slam tennis champion, felt that the stiff tennis attire was too cumbersome and uncomfortable. He designed a white, short-sleeved, loosely-knit piqué cotton (he called the cotton weave &quot;jersey petit piqué&quot;) shirt with an unstarched, flat, protruding collar; a buttoned placket; and a shirt-tail longer in back than in front (known today as a &quot;tennis tail&quot;; see below), which he first wore at the 1926 U.S. Open championship.

Beginning in 1927, Lacoste placed a crocodile emblem on the left breast of his shirts, as the American press had begun to refer to him as &quot;The Crocodile&quot;, a nickname which he embraced.

Lacoste&#x27;s design mitigated the problems that traditional tennis attire created:

* the short, cuffed sleeves solved the tendency of long sleeves to roll down
* the shirt should be buttoned to the top
* the piqué collar could be worn upturned to protect the neck skin from the sun
* the jersey knit piqué cotton breathed and was more durable
* the &quot;tennis tail&quot; prevented the shirt from pulling out of the wearer&#x27;s trousers or shorts

In 1933, after retiring from professional tennis, Lacoste teamed up with André Gillier, a friend who was a clothing merchandiser, to market that shirt in Europe and North America. Together, they formed the company Chemise Lacoste, and began selling their shirts, which included the small embroidered crocodile logo on the left breast.

== Application to polo ==
Until the beginning of 20th century, polo players wore thick, long-sleeved shirts made of Oxford-cloth cotton. This shirt was the first to have a buttoned-down collar, which polo players invented in the late 19th century to keep their collars from flapping in the wind. Brooks Brothers&#x27; early president, John Brooks, noticed this while at a polo match in England and began producing such a shirt in 1896. Brooks Brothers still produces this style of button-down &quot;polo shirt&quot;. 

In 1920, Lewis Lacey, a Canadian (born of English parents in Montreal, Quebec in 1887) haberdasher and polo player, began producing a shirt that was embroidered with an emblem of a polo player, a design originating at the Hurlingham Polo Club near Buenos Aires.
In 1972, Ralph Lauren marketed a tennis shirt as a &quot;polo shirt&quot; as a prominent part of his original line Polo, thereby helping further its already widespread popularity. While not specifically designed for use by polo players, Lauren&#x27;s shirt imitated what by that time had become the normal attire for polo players. As he desired to exude a certain &quot;WASPishness&quot; in his clothes, initially adopting the style of clothiers like Brooks Brothers, J. Press, and &quot;Savile Row&quot;-style English clothing, he prominently included this attire from the &quot;sport of kings&quot; in his line, replete with a logo reminiscent of Lacoste&#x27;s crocodile emblem, depicting a polo player and pony.

In large part due to Ralph Lauren (and arguably as an example of a genericized trademark), the term “polo shirt,” has become far more common than “tennis shirt” or “golf shirt.”

== Golf ==

Over the latter half of the 20th century, as standard clothing in golf became more casual, the tennis shirt was adopted nearly universally as standard golf attire. Many golf courses and country clubs require players to wear golf shirts as a part of their dress code. Moreover, producing Lacoste&#x27;s &quot;tennis shirt&quot; in various golf cuts has resulted in specific designs of the tennis shirt for golf, resulting in the moniker &quot;golf shirt&quot;.

Golf shirts are commonly made out of polyester, cotton-polyester blends, or mercerized cotton. The placket typically holds three or four buttons, and consequently extends lower than the typical polo neckline. The collar is typically fabricated using a stitched double-layer of the same fabric used to make the shirt, in contrast to a polo shirt collar, which is usually one-ply ribbed knit cotton. Golf shirts often have a pocket on the left side, originally designed to hold small items such as a scorepad and pencil.

== In Vietnam ==
Polo shirts, also known as &quot;áo thun có cổ&quot; in Vietnamese, were introduced to Vietnam in the early 20th century by the French. Initially, polo shirts were worn by the upper class and athletes. Gradually, polo shirts became popular and widely accepted by all social classes. Many Vietnamese companies and businesses choose polo shirts as their employee uniforms. According to Metric.vn, the Vietnamese polo shirt market on e-commerce platforms reached 9.2 billion VND in 2023, a decrease of 19.3% compared to the previous quarter. Polo shirts account for about 20% of the Vietnamese t-shirt market, equivalent to 1.84 billion VND. In 2023, Vietnam exported 3.2 billion USD worth of t-shirts of all kinds, of which polo shirts accounted for about 20%, equivalent to US$640 million.

<doc id="1020602" wikidata="Q267249" url="?curid=1020602" title="Lucida">
<text>Lucida (pronunciation: ) is an extended family of related typefaces designed by Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes and released from 1984 onwards. The family is intended to be extremely legible when printed at small size or displayed on a low-resolution display – hence the name, from &#x27;lucid&#x27; (clear or easy to understand).

There are many variants of Lucida, including serif (Fax, Bright), sans-serif (Sans, Sans Unicode, Grande, Sans Typewriter) and scripts (Blackletter, Calligraphy, Handwriting). Many are released with other software, most notably Microsoft Office.

Bigelow and Holmes, together with the (now defunct) TeX vendor Y&amp;Y, extended the Lucida family with a full set of TeX mathematical symbols, making it one of the few typefaces that provide full-featured text and mathematical typesetting within TeX. Lucida is still licensed commercially through the TUG store as well through their own web store. The fonts are occasionally updated.

==Key features==
The Lucida fonts have a large x-height (tall lower-case letters), open apertures and quite widely spaced letters, classic features of fonts designed for legibility in body text. Capital letters were designed to be somewhat narrow and short in order to make all-caps acronyms blend in. Bigelow has said in interview that the characters were designed based on hand-drawn bitmaps to see what parts of letters needed to be clear in bitmap, before creating outlines that would render as clear bitmaps. The fonts include ligatures, but these are not needed for text, allowing use on simplistic typesetting systems. x-heights are consistent between the fonts. Hinting was used to allow onscreen display.

==Lucida Arrows==
A family of fonts containing arrows.

==Lucida Blackletter==

A family of cursive blackletter fonts released in 1992.
==Lucida Bright==

Based on Lucida Serif, it features more contrasted strokes and serifs.

The font was first used as the text face for &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine, and its letter-spacing was tightened to give it a slightly closer fit for use in two and three column formats.
==Lucida Calligraphy==

A script font developed from Chancery cursive, released in 1991.
==Lucida Casual==
A casual font, released in 1994. Similar to Lucida Handwriting, but without connecting strokes. In 2014, Bigelow &amp; Holmes released additional weights in normal and narrow widths.
==Lucida Console==

A monospaced font that is a variant of Lucida Sans Typewriter, with smaller line spacing and the addition of the WGL4 character set. In 2014, Bigelow &amp; Holmes released bold weights and italics in normal and narrow widths. Lucida Console was the default font in Microsoft Notepad from Windows 2000 through Windows 7, its replacement being Consolas. This was also the font for the blue screen of death from Windows XP to Windows 7.
==Lucida Fax==

A slab serif font family released in 1992. Derived from Lucida, and specifically designed for telefaxing.
==Lucida Handwriting==

A font, released in 1992, designed to resemble informal cursive handwriting with modern plastic-tipped or felt-tipped pens or markers. In 2014, Bigelow &amp; Holmes added additional weights and widths to the family.
==Lucida Icons==
A family of fonts for ornament and decoration uses. It contains ampersands, interrobangs, asterisms, circled Lucida Sans numerals, etc.

==Lucida Math==
A family of fonts for mathematical expressions. Lucida Math Extension contains only mathematical symbols. Lucida Math Italic contains Latin characters from Lucida Serif Italic, but with smaller line spacing, and added Greek letters. Lucida Math contains mathematical symbols, and blackletter (from Lucida Blackletter) and script letters in (from Lucida Calligraphy Italic) Letterlike Symbols region.

==Lucida OpenType==
First released in March 2012, this collection includes OpenType math fonts in regular and bold weights, and Lucida Bright, Lucida Sans Typewriter, and Lucida Sans text fonts in the usual four variants (regular, italic, bold, bold italic). The regular math font includes an entirely new math script alphabet in Roundhand style, among other new characters. The Lucida Bright text fonts include Unicode Latin character blocks including Basic Latin, Latin-1, and Latin Extended-A characters for American, Western European, Central European, Turkish, and other Latin-based orthographies.

==Lucida Sans==

A family of humanist sans-serif fonts complementing Lucida Serif. The italic is a &quot;true italic&quot; rather than a &quot;sloped roman&quot;, inspired by chancery cursive handwriting of the Italian renaissance, which Bigelow and Holmes studied while at Reed College in the 1960s.
===Lucida Grande===
A version of Lucida Sans with expanded character sets, released around 2000. It supports Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Thai scripts. It is most notable for having been used as the system font for OSX until version 10.10.
===Lucida Sans Typewriter===

Also called Lucida Typewriter Sans, this is a sans-serif monospaced font family, designed for typewriters. Its styling is reminiscent of Letter Gothic and Andalé Mono; a variant, Lucida Console , replaced those two fonts on Microsoft Windows systems.
===Lucida Sans Unicode===
Based on Lucida Sans Regular, this version added characters in Arrows, Block Elements, Box Drawing, Combining Diacritical Marks, Control Pictures, Currency Symbols, Cyrillic, General Punctuation, Geometric Shapes, Greek and Coptic, Hebrew, IPA Extensions, Latin Extended-A, Latin Extended-B, Letterlike Symbols, Mathematical Operators, Miscellaneous Symbols, Miscellaneous Technical, Spacing Modifier Letters, Superscripts and Subscripts regions.
==Lucida Serif==

The original Lucida font designed in 1985, featuring a thickened serif. It was simply called Lucida when it was first released.
===Lucida Typewriter Serif===

Also called Lucida Typewriter, this font is a slab serif monospaced version of Lucida Fax, but with wider serifs. The letters are wider than Lucida Sans Typewriter.
==Usages==
Lucida Console is used in various parts of Microsoft Windows. From Windows 2000 until Windows 7, Lucida Console is used as the default typeface of Notepad. In Windows XP until Windows 7, and in Windows CE, Lucida Console is used as the typeface of the Blue Screen of Death. Lucida Grande, as well as Lucida Sans Demibold (identical outlines to Lucida Grande Bold but with tighter spacing of numerals), were used as the primary user interface font in Apple Inc.&#x27;s Mac OS X operating system until OS X Yosemite, as well as many programs including Front Row. Lucida is also used in the logo for Air Canada. A collection of Lucida variants are included in the Oracle JRE 9. Lucida Calligraphy was used in the logo for Gladden Entertainment.

In April 2012, Lucida Sans was selected by GfK Blue Moon as the font for a package design as part of a proposed law in Australia banning logos on cigarette packaging. The proposed law requires cigarettes to be sold in dark olive-brown packages that depict graphic images of the effects of smoking and the cigarette&#x27;s brand printed in Lucida Sans. According to Tom Delaney, a senior designer with New York design consultant Muts &amp; Joy, &quot;Lucida Sans is one of the least graceful sans-serif typefaces designed. It’s clumsy in its line construction.&quot; On August 15, 2012, the Australian government approved the ban on cigarette logos, effectively replacing them with the unattractive packaging.

<text>James Douglas McGarel-Hogg, 2nd Baron Magheramorne (16 January 1861 – 10 March 1903), was an Ulster-Scots peer.

==Early life==
McGarel-Hogg was born in London, the son of James Macnaghten McGarel-Hogg, 1st Baron Magheramorne, and the Hon. Caroline Elizabeth Emma Douglas-Pennant (–1924). Among his siblings were sister Hon. Edith Mary McGarel-Hogg (who married Hon. Arthur Saumarez, a son of the 3rd Baron de Saumarez), Dudley Stuart McGarel-Hogg, Ronald Tracey McGarel-Hogg, Hon. Archibald Campbell McGarel-Hogg (an architect), and Hon. Gerald Francis McGarel-Hogg (a Lieutenant in the 4th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers). 

His paternal grandparents were Sir James Weir Hogg, 1st Baronet, and the former Mary Swinton. His maternal grandparents were Edward Gordon Douglas-Pennant, 1st Baron Penrhyn and Juliana Isabella Mary Dawkins-Pennant (a daughter of George Hay Dawkins-Pennant). 

==Career==
He served as a Lieutenant in the Derbyshire Yeomanry Cavalary and was an officer in the 1st Life Guards, rising to the rank of captain. He served as aide-de-camp to the Earl of Aberdeen when he was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

Lord Magheramorne lived a dissolute life, and was unsuccessful in business. He was declared bankrupt on 23 November 1900 in Dublin.

==Personal life==
On 23 October 1889, the year before he inherited the peerage, McGarel-Hogg was married to Lady Evelyn Harriet Ashley-Cooper, the second daughter of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 8th Earl of Shaftesbury and Lady Harriet Chichester (a daughter of the 3rd Marquess of Donegall). Together, they were the parents of: 

* Hon. Norah Evelyn McGarel-Hogg (1890–1967), who married Lt.-Col. Edward Julian Groves-McGarel, son of Col. John Edward Trimble Groves, in 1919. They divorced in 1933.

Lord Magheramorne died in Paris on 10 March 1903. The peerage was inherited by his brother, Dudley. His widow remarried The Hon. Hugo Baring, younger son of The 1st Baron Revelstoke, on 1 March 1905. As he was the only one of his brothers to marry, upon the death of Ronald, the barony created for his father became extinct, while the baronetcty passed to a cousin.

<doc id="1020605" wikidata="Q417062" url="?curid=1020605" title="Chaotropic agent">
<text>A chaotropic agent is a molecule in water solution that can disrupt the hydrogen bonding network between water molecules (i.e. exerts chaotropic activity). This has an effect on the stability of the native state of other molecules in the solution, mainly macromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids) by weakening the hydrophobic effect. For example, a chaotropic agent reduces the amount of order in the structure of a protein formed by water molecules, both in the bulk and the hydration shells around hydrophobic amino acids, and may cause its denaturation.

Conversely, an antichaotropic agent (kosmotropic) is a molecule in an aqueous solution that will increase the hydrophobic effects within the solution. Antichaotropic salts such as ammonium sulphate can be used to precipitate substances from the impure mixture. This is used in protein purification processes, to remove undesired proteins from solution.

==Overview==
A chaotropic agent is a substance which disrupts the structure of, and denatures, macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids (e.g. DNA and RNA). Chaotropic solutes increase the entropy of the system by interfering with intermolecular interactions mediated by non-covalent forces such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic effects. Macromolecular structure and function is dependent on the net effect of these forces (see protein folding), therefore it follows that an increase in chaotropic solutes in a biological system will denature macromolecules, reduce enzymatic activity and induce stress on a cell (i.e., a cell will have to synthesize stress protectants). 

Tertiary protein folding is dependent on hydrophobic forces from amino acids throughout the sequence of the protein. Chaotropic solutes decrease the net hydrophobic effect of hydrophobic regions because of a disordering of water molecules adjacent to the protein. This solubilises the hydrophobic region in the solution, thereby denaturing the protein. This is also directly applicable to the hydrophobic region in lipid bilayers; if a critical concentration of a chaotropic solute is reached (in the hydrophobic region of the bilayer) then membrane integrity will be compromised, and the cell will lyse.

Chaotropic salts that dissociate in solution exert chaotropic effects via different mechanisms. Whereas chaotropic compounds such as ethanol interfere with non-covalent intramolecular forces as outlined above, salts can have chaotropic properties by shielding charges and preventing the stabilization of salt bridges. Hydrogen bonding is stronger in non-polar media, so salts, which increase the chemical polarity of the solvent, can also destabilize hydrogen bonding. Mechanistically this is because there are insufficient water molecules to effectively solvate the ions. This can result in ion-dipole interactions between the salts and hydrogen bonding species which are more favorable than normal hydrogen bonds.

Common chaotropic agents include n-butanol, ethanol, guanidinium chloride, lithium perchlorate, lithium acetate, magnesium chloride, phenol, 2-propanol, sodium dodecyl sulfate, thiourea, and urea.

<text>Raelee Hill is an Australian actress, known for portraying roles in some of Australia&#x27;s most successful television series. Her first major role was as Loretta Taylor in &quot;Paradise Beach&quot;, which was followed shortly afterwards by roles as Serendipity Gottlieb in &quot;Neighbours&quot; and Constable Tayler Johnson in &quot;Water Rats&quot;. She had a supporting role as Sikozu in the sci-fi series &quot;Farscape&quot; and the miniseries &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Hill was born in Brisbane to Stan, an oil refinery worker, and Janette, an art teacher and potter. She has an older sister. Hill has half-Scottish and half-Irish heritage. Hill attended a private school, where she became school captain and was on debate and softball teams.

==Career==
From 1993 until 1994, Hill starred in &quot;Paradise Beach&quot; as Loretta Taylor. Hill secured the role while she was studying an arts degree at university. She had six months to go of a three year course. Hill enjoyed playing Loretta, as she was &quot;not a typical Aussie soap character&quot;. She Loretta was known for being &quot;quirky&quot; and often wore eccentric outfits, which Hill said made her interesting to play. She appeared in the guest role of Jill Lambert in an episode of &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; in July 1994. She had to have her red hair sprayed black due to her close resemblance to lead actress Julie Nihill. 

Two days after finishing up on &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, Hill joined the cast of &quot;Neighbours&quot; as &quot;free-spirited&quot; Serendipity Gottlieb, sister of Mark Gottlieb (played by Bruce Samazan). Hill had been spotted in a café by the show&#x27;s casting director Jan Russ. She made her first appearance on 25 August 1994. Hill left &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 1995, after her contract was not renewed. She appeared in the soap opera spoof &quot;Shark Bay&quot; in 1996, and made her film debut in the romantic comedy &quot;Hotel de Love&quot;. In 1997, she joined the cast of police drama &quot;Water Rats&quot; as rookie officer Tayler Johnson. Her theatre credits include the role of Wendy in &quot;Pan&quot; for The Jim Henson Company.

In 2002, Hill was cast in the supporting role of Sikozu in the Australian-American sci-fi television series &quot;Farscape&quot;. She originally auditioned for the part of Mele-On Grayza, but the part ultimately went to Rebecca Riggs. The role of Sikozu was created especially for her by executive producer David Kemper after impressing him during her audition. Hill also appeared as Sikozu in the 2004 miniseries &quot;&quot;. 

She had a brief role in &quot;Superman Returns&quot; in 2006, followed by appearances in the 2007 Indonesian film &quot;Long Road to Heaven&quot; about the 2002 Bali bombing, and &quot;Event Zero&quot; (2017).

<doc id="1020620" wikidata="Q4976220" url="?curid=1020620" title="Brown Mpinganjira">
<text>Brown James Mpinganjira (born 7 November 1950), popularly known as BJ is a Malawian Politician who used his 1986 detention to fight the injustices of the then one party state. He worked with others in prison and used their time to devise ways on how to change the direction of Malawi&#x27;s political state.

Mpinganjira was detained in 1986 and was released in 1991 due to international pressure. He began working for British council upon his release and received support from international community to form a pressure group and lobby for a referendum to decide whether Malawi was still to remain a one party state or become a multi party democracy. In the 1993 referendum, history was made at the polls when Malawians voted for multi party democracy.
In the first multi party elections, Mpinganjira contested as Member of Parliament in his home town Mulanje. He won the parliamentary seat in 1994 and served as an MP for Mulanje Central for 15years. In the 15 years that he was in parliament, Mpinganjira had a colourful political career and is one of the best political masterminds in Malawi. He has contested once as a presidential candidate for National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in 2004 and as a running mate in the Mgwirizano Coalition (MCP &amp; UDF) in 2009.

== Early life ==
Brown James Mpinganjira was born on 7 November 1950 to Dr James Mpinganjira and his wife Ella Mankhokwe Mpinganjira, a nurse, in Mulanje district, Southern Region of Malawi. Brown is the first born in a family of 9 children. He did his primary education at Chisitu Primary School and proceeded to do his secondary school at Blantyre Secondary School. He then trained as a journalist in Cologne, Germany, and attained his master&#x27;s degree in mass journalism from University of Leicester, England.

== Career ==
Brown has worked at the state owned Malawi Broadcasting Corporation before becoming the Principle Information Officer in the Malawi Government Information Services Department in 1982. In 1985 he was promoted to Deputy Chief Information officer where he served for a year before being arrested and detained without charges.

== Detainee ==
BJ was detained under the Kamuzu Banda regime when he was the Deputy Chief Information Officer in 1986 and spent time at Mikuyu Prison in Zomba until his release in 1991. While in prison Mpinganjira, together with other detainees began operations by seeking international intervention to end the one party system. After his release in 1991, Mpinganjira started working for British council, which gave him the perfect cover for outside connections to continue the fight he had started while in prison. He co founded the then pressure group UDF and campaigned for a multi party democracy. He also had an underground newspaper that he titled &quot;nkhani za ku Malawi&quot; which he used to sensitise people on the issues of human rights violations going on in Malawi.

== Political career ==
In 1994, Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda was defeated and Bakili Muluzi was elected as Malawi&#x27;s 2nd president. Brown Mpinganjira was elected as Member of Parliament for Mulanje Central and served as a Minister during Bakili&#x27;s tenure and was known as his right hand man. In May 1994 he was appointed as the Minister of Information, Broadcasting, Post &amp; Telecommunications. His notable achievement during his time in this Ministry was the introduction of a Television station, private radio stations, commencement of cellular or mobile phone in Malawi and the onset of internet services. In July 1997 he was appointed as Minister of Education. In May 1999 after winning a second term as President of Malawi, Muluzi appointed Mpinganjira as Minister of Foreign Affairs up until Jan 2000 when he was then appointed as Minister of Transport and Public Works. In October 2000, Muluzi dropped Mpinganjira from his cabinet and he was arrested on charges of corruption and that he had taken a $731 bribe to offer lucrative deals to his friends when he was Minister of Education. Mpinganjira dismissed the charges as being politically motivated. He said then, that he broke with Muluzi over the latter&#x27;s attempt to have the constitution changed so that he could run for a third term of office. Mpinganjira was acquitted of all charges as there was no evidence to support the claims. Mpinganjira formed his own party, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).The party was formed on to fight the third term bill that Muluzi wanted. Mpinganjira and others retaliated that was not the democracy that they fought for and would not allow Muluzi to become another &quot;life president&quot;. In October 2001, Mpinganjira was arrested again, this time on charges of treason. These charges were again dropped due to lack of evidence in April 2002. The bill proposing to change the constitution amendment was defeated in July 2002. This is one of Mpinganjira&#x27;s greatest win.

In the 2004 presidential election, the UDF candidate Bingu wa Mutharika won the elections and Mpinganjira&#x27;s NDA was placed fourth, receiving only 8.7% of the vote. The party managed to contribute a number of Members of Parliament to the National Assembly among them Billy Kaunda and Mpinganjira himself. Mpinganjira later dissolved the NDA and rejoined the United Democratic Front, a party he helped to found. The party formally deregistered in August 2004.

In the May 2009 presidential election, Mpinganjira (on a UDF ticket) ran alongside Malawi Congress Party (MCP) presidential candidate John Tembo as Tembo&#x27;s vice-presidential candidate. The MCP and the UDF both supported Tembo in the election. This time Mpinganjira not only lost the presidential race but he lost his seat as MP for Mulanje Central after serving for 15 consecutive years.

After the then vice president Joyce Banda fell out with President Bingu, she and others formed People&#x27;s Party. Mpinganjira who had not been active on the political scene joined the part and served as Treasurer General of the party and vice president of the party. In April 2012, the president of Malawi Bingu wa Mutharika died, leaving Joyce Banda to take on the mantle as president. Mpinganjira was appointed to serve as Minister of Water Development and Irrigation in June 2013. In September 2013 he was then appointed as Minister of Information and Civic Education, a position he held until May 2014. In the 2004 general elections, Joyce Banda&#x27;s candidature lost to DPP&#x27;s Peter Mutharika. In May 2015, Mpinganjira resigned from the Peoples Party.

In January 2018, Mpinganjira was welcomed into the DPP party by President Peter Mutharika at a rally. In February 2018, he was appointed as board chairman of the National Roads Authority. In 2019, two of Mpinganjira&#x27;s sons, Patrick Matola (Independent, Chiradzulu) and Chipiliro Mpinganjira (DPP, Blantryre Central) were elected as Members of Parliament.

<text>Anil Kumarsingh Gayan (born 22 October 1948 in Triolet, Mauritius) is a Mauritian politician and lawyer. 

==Early life, education and marriage==
Anil Gayan&#x27;s ancestors migrated from India when the island was a British colony. He is the son of Socile Boolell (Sir Satcam Boolell&#x27;s sister) and bus driver Deokaran Gayan. Gayan completed his secondary education at Royal College Port Louis and was awarded a scholarship in 1968 to study in England as a &quot;laureate&quot;. He studied law at the London School of Economics and University of London until 1974.

Gayan married Sooryakanti Nirsimloo, an academic of the MGI, whose younger sister is writer Ananda Devi Nirsimloo-Anenden.

==Political career==
He was the foreign minister of Mauritius from 1983 until 1986 and from September 2000 until a cabinet reshuffle in December 2003. 

In 2009, he formed a new group called FNM (Front National Mauricien) in preparation for the by-elections during which he challenged rival cousins Pravind Jugnauth and Ashock Jugnauth. FNM had activist Atma Doolooa as deputy leader, barrister Ashley Hurrunghee as president, and comedian Hassen Rojoa as general secretary. However, Gayan was defeated at the Constituency No.8 by-elections when the FNM participated in such events.

Gayan later joined the Muvman Liberater (a splinter group of the MMM) and was elected in the 2014 general elections in Constituency No. 20 (Beau Bassin-Petite Rivière). He was part of Cabinet as Minister of Health (2014-2017) and then as Minister of Tourism (2017-2019).

==Legal career==
In 1974, Gayan joined the Attorney General’s Chambers as Crown Counsel. Since 1995 Gayan has been a Senior Counsel.

In 2008, he was part of United Nations mediation in Guinea-Bissau. Gayan led a 20-member African Union group of observers during the 2010 Rwanda elections.

==Controversies==

In 2015, the appointment of the head of the Cardiac Center, which is a department under Gayan&#x27;s ministry, caused some controversy. In May 2016, Gayan sent a &quot;Freedom of Information&quot; email to a newspaper to request the newspaper to provide information about the salary of its staff. The Director of Publications of the newspaper replied by disclosing his salary and commented that the newspaper is a private entity. In June 2016, several Non-Governmental Organizations were concerned about the increase in usage of synthetic drugs in Mauritius while Gayan stated that the situation was not alarming.

<doc id="1020633" wikidata="Q587991" url="?curid=1020633" title="Live Scenes from New York">
<text>Live Scenes from New York is the third live album by American progressive metal band Dream Theater, recorded on August 30, 2000, at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City. &quot;Live Scenes from New York&quot; is the audio counterpart to the &quot;Metropolis 2000: Scenes from New York&quot; DVD, released in 2001, except only the CD has the full concert. The third disc contains two videos of the concert that are not on the DVD, the music video for &quot;Another Day&quot;, and Jordan Rudess&#x27;s keyboard solo. This is Dream Theater&#x27;s first live release with Rudess and first full-length live release.

Drummer Mike Portnoy collapsed after the concert. He said, &quot;I collapsed due to over-exhaustion, dehydration, stress, too little food and nutrition, too many Red Bulls, etc. It took me several hours of throwing up, being wrapped in blankets and laying down before I was carried out of the venue hours after the show.&quot;

==Cover artwork==
Coincidentally, the album was originally released on September 11, 2001. Because the cover artwork depicts the New York skyline, including the twin towers of the World Trade Center, in flames, it was recalled and re-released shortly with the band&#x27;s Majesty symbol in gold instead. The original artwork was based on the cover for Dream Theater&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Images and Words&quot;, which includes a heart in flames and wrapped in barbed wire. In the heart’s place for this release was an apple instead, for New York City’s nickname &quot;The Big Apple&quot;.

==Track listing==
All music was composed by Dream Theater except where noted.


Disc three also contains the video for &quot;Another Day&quot; and the keyboard solo.

<text>Jan Łaski or Johannes à Lasco (1499 – 8 January 1560) was a Polish Calvinist reformer. Owing to his influential work in England (1548–1553) during the English Reformation, he is known to the English-speaking world by the Anglicised form John à Lasco (or less commonly, John Laski).

==Life==

Jan Łaski was born in 1499 as the second son of Jarosław Łaski, the voivode of Sieradz, and Zuzanna of Bąkowa Góra. Following Hermann Dalton&#x27;s claims in his nineteenth-century biography of Łaski, a number of historians have identified the Łaski family&#x27;s castle in Łask as his place of birth, although recent Polish scholarship concludes that the exact location cannot be ascertained.

His uncle, also Jan Łaski, was the Archbishop of Gniezno, Primate of Poland and Grand Chancellor of the Crown, and he was instrumental in forwarding the early career of his nephew. The coat-of-arms of the Łaski family was &quot;Korab&quot;.

After his family&#x27;s fall from political power and prestige, Łaski, a learned priest, went in 1523 to Basel, where he became a close friend of Erasmus and Zwingli. 
In 1542, he became pastor of a Protestant church at Emden, East Frisia. A public library in Emden is named after him (https://www.jalb.de/22758-438-0-73.html), it received the &#x27;Bibliothek des Jahres&#x27; (Library of the year) award of the German Library Association in 2001 (https://www.bibliotheksverband.de/bibliothek-des-jahres#BibliothekdesJahres2001). Shortly after his stay in Emden he went to England, where in 1550 he was superintendent of the Strangers&#x27; Church of London and had some influence on ecclesiastical affairs in the reign of Edward VI.
Upon the accession of Catholic Queen Mary in July 1553, he fled to Copenhagen with a shipload of refugees from the Strangers&#x27; Church. However they were denied refuge there because they would not accept the Augsburg Confession of Faith. They were resettled in Brandenburg. Łaski also helped Catherine Willoughby and her husband after they too had left England. His support enabled them to obtain an appointment from Sigismund II as administrators of Lithuania.
Łaski was a correspondent of John Hooper, whom Łaski supported in the vestments controversy.

In 1556, he was recalled to Poland, where he became secretary to King Sigismund II and was a leader in Calvinism.

His contributions to the Calvinist churches were the establishment of church government in theory and practice, a denial of any distinction between ministers and elders except in terms of who could teach and administer the sacraments. A meeting with the Anabaptist Menno Simons in 1544 led Łaski to coin the term &quot;Mennonites&quot; for the followers of Simons.

He died in Pińczów, Poland.

<doc id="1020643" wikidata="Q899157" url="?curid=1020643" title="Hydrophobic effect">
<text>The hydrophobic effect is the observed tendency of nonpolar substances to aggregate in an aqueous solution and to be excluded by water. The word hydrophobic literally means &quot;water-fearing&quot;, and it describes the segregation of water and nonpolar substances, which maximizes the entropy of water and minimizes the area of contact between water and nonpolar molecules. In terms of thermodynamics, the hydrophobic effect is the free energy change of water surrounding a solute. A positive free energy change of the surrounding solvent indicates hydrophobicity, whereas a negative free energy change implies hydrophilicity.

The hydrophobic effect is responsible for the separation of a mixture of oil and water into its two components. It is also responsible for effects related to biology, including: cell membrane and vesicle formation, protein folding, insertion of membrane proteins into the nonpolar lipid environment and protein-small molecule associations. Hence the hydrophobic effect is essential to life. Substances for which this effect is observed are known as hydrophobes.

== Amphiphiles ==

Amphiphiles are molecules that have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. Detergents are composed of amphiphiles that allow hydrophobic molecules to be solubilized in water by forming micelles and bilayers (as in soap bubbles). They are also important to cell membranes composed of amphiphilic phospholipids that prevent the internal aqueous environment of a cell from mixing with external water.

== Folding of macromolecules ==

In the case of protein folding, the hydrophobic effect is important to understanding the structure of proteins that have hydrophobic amino acids (such as valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine) clustered together within the protein. Structures of globular proteins have a hydrophobic core in which hydrophobic side chains are buried from water, which stabilizes the folded state. Charged and polar side chains are situated on the solvent-exposed surface where they interact with surrounding water molecules. Minimizing the number of hydrophobic side chains exposed to water is the principal driving force behind the folding process, although formation of hydrogen bonds within the protein also stabilizes protein structure.

The energetics of DNA tertiary-structure assembly were determined to be driven by the hydrophobic effect, in addition to Watson–Crick base pairing, which is responsible for sequence selectivity, and stacking interactions between the aromatic bases.

== Protein purification ==

In biochemistry, the hydrophobic effect can be used to separate mixtures of proteins based on their hydrophobicity. Column chromatography with a hydrophobic stationary phase such as phenyl-sepharose will cause more hydrophobic proteins to travel more slowly, while less hydrophobic ones elute from the column sooner. To achieve better separation, a salt may be added (higher concentrations of salt increase the hydrophobic effect) and its concentration decreased as the separation progresses.

== Cause ==

The origin of the hydrophobic effect is not fully understood.
Some argue that the hydrophobic interaction is mostly an entropic effect originating from the disruption of highly dynamic hydrogen bonds between molecules of liquid water by the nonpolar solute. A hydrocarbon chain or a similar nonpolar region of a large molecule is incapable of forming hydrogen bonds with water. Introduction of such a non-hydrogen bonding surface into water causes disruption of the hydrogen bonding network between water molecules. The hydrogen bonds are reoriented tangentially to such surface to minimize disruption of the hydrogen bonded 3D network of water molecules, and this leads to a structured water &quot;cage&quot; around the nonpolar surface. The water molecules that form the &quot;cage&quot; (or clathrate) have restricted mobility. In the solvation shell of small nonpolar particles, the restriction amounts to some 10%. For example, in the case of dissolved xenon at room temperature a mobility restriction of 30% has been found. In the case of larger nonpolar molecules, the reorientational and translational motion of the water molecules in the solvation shell may be restricted by a factor of two to four; thus, at 25 °C the reorientational correlation time of water increases from 2 to 4-8 picoseconds. Generally, this leads to significant losses in translational and rotational entropy of water molecules and makes the process unfavorable in terms of the free energy in the system. By aggregating together, nonpolar molecules reduce the surface area exposed to water and minimize their disruptive effect.

The hydrophobic effect can be quantified by measuring the partition coefficients of non-polar molecules between water and non-polar solvents. The partition coefficients can be transformed to free energy of transfer which includes enthalpic and entropic components, &quot;ΔG = ΔH - TΔS&quot;. These components are experimentally determined by calorimetry. The hydrophobic effect was found to be entropy-driven at room temperature because of the reduced mobility of water molecules in the solvation shell of the non-polar solute; however, the enthalpic component of transfer energy was found to be favorable, meaning it strengthened water-water hydrogen bonds in the solvation shell due to the reduced mobility of water molecules. At the higher temperature, when water molecules become more mobile, this energy gain decreases along with the entropic component. The hydrophobic effect depends on the temperature, which leads to &quot;cold denaturation&quot; of proteins.

The hydrophobic effect can be calculated by comparing the free energy of solvation with bulk water. In this way, the hydrophobic effect not only can be localized but also decomposed into enthalpic and entropic contributions.

<text>The Future is the ninth studio album by the Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, released in 1992. Almost an hour in length, it was Cohen&#x27;s longest album up to that date. Both the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 1992 Los Angeles riots took place while Cohen was writing and recording the album, which expressed his sense of the world&#x27;s turbulence. The album was recorded with a large cast of musicians and engineers in several different studios; the credits list almost 30 female singers. The album built on the success of Cohen&#x27;s previous album, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;, and garnered overwhelmingly positive reviews. &quot;The Future&quot; made the Top 40 in the UK album charts, went double platinum in Canada, and sold a quarter of a million copies in the U.S., which had previously been unenthusiastic about Cohen&#x27;s albums.

==Background==
After touring successfully in support of his &quot;comeback&quot; album &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; (1988), Cohen took a year off to help his son Adam convalesce after a serious car accident in the West Indies left the young man in a coma for four months. Cohen also began a romantic relationship with the actress Rebecca De Mornay. Anthony Reynolds notes in his book &quot;Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life&quot; that work on Cohen&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;was not forged in one concentrated effort. The number of studios used ran into double figures and was spread between Montreal and Los Angeles, although the original plan was to record it in Montreal only, with the same personnel that had worked on &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;. The cast brought to bear on the album was more akin to a movie production and included both a choir and an orchestra...&quot; The songwriting process had not gotten easier for Cohen over the years; in an interview with &quot;Q&quot;, the singer admitted, &quot;I&#x27;ve never found it easy to write. Period. I mean, I don&#x27;t want to whine about it or anything but...it&#x27;s a bitch! It&#x27;s terrible work. I&#x27;m very disciplined in that I can settle down into the work situation but coming up with the words is very hard. Hard on the heart, hard on the head and it just drives you mad. Before you know it, you&#x27;re crawling across the carpet in your underwear trying to find a rhyme for &#x27;orange&#x27;. It&#x27;s a terrible, cruel job. But I&#x27;m not complaining.&quot;

==Composition==
According to Ira Nadel&#x27;s 1996 Cohen memoir &quot;Various Positions&quot;, the title track was originally called &quot;If You Could See What&#x27;s Coming Next&quot;, and underwent extensive rewrites, taking up almost sixty pages in Cohen&#x27;s notebook, while &quot;Closing Time&quot; took two years with Cohen even starting over from scratch on the song as late as March 1992. Nadel also reveals that &quot;Anthem&quot; was borrowed from Kabbalistic sources, especially the sixteenth-century rabbi Isaac Luria. In the Paul Zollo book &quot;Songwriters on Songwriting&quot;, Cohen explains that it takes him so long to finish songs because &quot;Nothing works. After a while, if you stick with the song long enough it will yield. But long enough is way beyond any reasonable estimation of what you think long enough may be...&#x27;Anthem&#x27; took a decade to write. And I&#x27;ve recorded it three times. More.&quot; This is borne out by the fact that some of the lyrics already appear in the song &quot;The Bells&quot; from the soundtrack of the 1986 film &quot;Night Magic&quot;. In the same interview, Cohen spoke at length about &quot;Democracy&quot;, admitting that he wrote 60 verses for it: 
This was when the Berlin Wall came down and everyone was saying democracy is coming to the east. And I was like that gloomy fellow who always turns up at a party to ruin the orgy or something. And I said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to happen that way. I don&#x27;t think this is such a good idea. I think a lot of suffering will be the consequence of this wall coming down.&quot; But then I asked myself, &quot;Where is democracy really coming?&quot; And it was the U.S.A...So while everyone was rejoicing, I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to be like that, euphoric, the honeymoon. So it was these world events that occasioned the song. And also the love of America. Because I think the irony of America is transcendent in the song. It&#x27;s not an ironic song. It&#x27;s a song of deep intimacy and affirmation of the experiment of democracy in this country. That this is really where the experiment is unfolding. This is really where the races confront one another, where the classes, where the genders, where even the sexual orientations confront one another. This is the real laboratory of democracy.

Political events and history are found elsewhere on the album, with Cohen making references to Tiananmen Square, Stalin, World War II and Hiroshima. &quot;I was living in L.A. through the riots and the earthquakes and the floods,&quot; the singer told &quot;Uncut&quot;″s Nigel Williamson in 1997. &quot;And even for one as relentlessly occupied with himself as I am it is very hard to keep your mind on yourself when the place is burning down, so I think that invited me to look out of the window.&quot; Although the tone of the album is at times sombre, it does contain much of the wry humour that is evident on Cohen&#x27;s previous LP &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;. &quot;The Future&quot; also contains two cover songs—Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Always&quot; and Frederick Knight&#x27;s &quot;Be For Real&quot;—as well as &quot;Tacoma Trailer&quot;, the first instrumental that Cohen had ever placed on one of his studio albums. Several producers are credited on the LP, including Cohen and Rebecca De Mornay.

==Film soundtracks and covers==
Three songs from this album, &quot;Anthem&quot;, &quot;The Future&quot;, and the menacing &quot;Waiting for the Miracle&quot; (co-written by Sharon Robinson) were used prominently on the soundtrack for Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;. &quot;Waiting for the Miracle&quot; also appeared in the film &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; starring Michael Douglas and &quot;The Future&quot; was featured in &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; starring Kevin Spacey. A cover version of &quot;Light as the Breeze&quot; by Billy Joel appears on the tribute album &quot;Tower of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; released in 1995. Billy Joel included his version on his compilation &quot;Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume III&quot; in 1997. A cover version of &quot;Anthem&quot; appears on the album &quot;&quot; released by the Canadian singer Patricia O&#x27;Callaghan in 2012, and Bob Seger included a cover of &quot;Democracy&quot; on his 2017 album &quot;I Knew You When&quot;.

At the 2017 &quot;Tower of Song: A Memorial Tribute to Leonard Cohen&quot; concert, &quot;Democracy&quot; was performed by Wesley Schultz and Jeremiah Fraites of the Lumineers, and &quot;The Future&quot; was performed by Elvis Costello. The Lumineers would go on to include an official cover of &quot;Democracy&quot; as a bonus track for their third studio album, &quot;III&quot;, in 2019.

==Reception==
The album charted as high as No. 36 in the UK and was phenomenally successful in Canada, going gold, platinum, and double-platinum. Cohen also won the Canadian Juno Award for &quot;Best Male Vocalist&quot; in 1993 for &quot;The Future&quot;. In his acceptance speech, he quipped, &quot;Only in Canada could somebody with a voice like mine win Vocalist of the Year.&quot; The music video for Cohen&#x27;s song &quot;Closing Time&quot; also won the Juno Award for Best Music Video in 1993. In the original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, Christian Wright called the album &quot;epic&quot;, enthusing &quot;&quot;The Future&quot; might as easily have been a book: A more troubling, more vexing image of human failure has not been written.&quot; Christopher Fielder of AllMusic calls the LP &quot;one long manifesto calling all to challenge the concepts of righteousness and despair in our modern world.&quot; In 2010 biographer Anthony Reynolds called &quot;The Future&quot; &quot;classic big budget AOR yet with lyrics by Lorca, Bukowski and Lowell, sung by an old wino from Skid Row who really wanted to sound like Ray Charles at the Apollo.&quot;

<doc id="1020661" wikidata="Q3527113" url="?curid=1020661" title="Lie–Kolchin theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Lie–Kolchin theorem is a theorem in the representation theory of linear algebraic groups; [[Lie&#x27;s theorem]] is the analog for linear Lie algebras.

It states that if &quot;G&quot; is a connected and solvable linear algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field and

:formula_1

a representation on a nonzero finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot;, then there is a one-dimensional linear subspace &quot;L&quot; of &quot;V&quot; such that

: formula_2

That is, ρ(&quot;G&quot;) has an invariant line &quot;L&quot;, on which &quot;G&quot; therefore acts through a one-dimensional representation. This is equivalent to the statement that &quot;V&quot; contains a nonzero vector &quot;v&quot; that is a common (simultaneous) eigenvector for all formula_3.

It follows directly that every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a connected and solvable linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; has dimension one. In fact, this is another way to state the Lie–Kolchin theorem.
The result for Lie algebras was proved by and for algebraic groups was proved by .

The Borel fixed point theorem generalizes the Lie–Kolchin theorem.

== Triangularization ==
Sometimes the theorem is also referred to as the &quot;Lie–Kolchin triangularization theorem&quot; because by induction it implies that with respect to a suitable basis of &quot;V&quot; the image formula_4 has a &quot;triangular shape&quot;; in other words, the image group formula_4 is conjugate in GL(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;K&quot;) (where &quot;n&quot; = dim &quot;V&quot;) to a subgroup of the group T of upper triangular matrices, the standard Borel subgroup of GL(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;K&quot;): the image is simultaneously triangularizable.

The theorem applies in particular to a Borel subgroup of a semisimple linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot;.

== Counter-example ==

If the field &quot;K&quot; is not algebraically closed, the theorem can fail. The standard unit circle, viewed as the set of complex numbers formula_6 of absolute value one is a one-dimensional commutative (and therefore solvable) linear algebraic group over the real numbers which has a two-dimensional representation into the special orthogonal group SO(2) without an invariant (real) line. Here the image formula_7 of formula_8 is the orthogonal matrix

: formula_9

<text>Erastus Corning 2nd (October 7, 1909 – May 28, 1983) was an American businessman and Democratic Party politician who served as the 72nd mayor of Albany, New York from 1942 to 1983, when Albany County was controlled by one of the last classic urban political machines in the United States.

Corning hailed from a prominent Albany family. His great-grandfather, Erastus Corning, was an industrialist who founded the New York Central Railroad and served in Congress and as Albany&#x27;s mayor from 1834 to 1837. Another great-grandfather, Amasa J. Parker, was a member of Congress and prominent judge. Corning&#x27;s father, Edwin Corning, was Lieutenant Governor of New York from 1927 to 1928. His uncle, Parker Corning, served as a member of the United States House of Representatives. His brother, Edwin Corning Jr., served as a member of the New York State Assembly. Corning was educated at The Albany Academy, Groton School, and Yale University (class of 1932). The Corning family was involved in several Albany-area businesses, and Corning started an insurance agency after his college graduation. While he served as mayor, his agency did not do business with the city of Albany, but did do business with Albany County, which Corning argued presented no conflict of interest, since he was not a county official.

Corning&#x27;s father was one of the leaders of the Democratic Party organization formed by Daniel P. O&#x27;Connell, which wrested control of Albany city and county from the Republican organization led by William Barnes Jr. in the early 1920s. The O&#x27;Connell machine proved so durable that it still largely controlled Albany County until the early 1980s, one of the last such organizations to remain viable. Corning entered politics at an early age as an affiliate of the O&#x27;Connell organization, winning a seat in the New York State Assembly in 1935. After serving in the Assembly during the 1936 legislative session, Corning won election to the New York State Senate, where he served from 1937 to 1941. Corning was elected mayor in 1941. He continued to win election every four years until 1981, and served from 1941 until his death in 1983. Corning was drafted for World War II and served in the United States Army&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Division during combat in Europe. In 1946, he was the Democratic Party&#x27;s unsuccessful nominee for lieutenant governor. In the 1970s, Corning teamed with Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller to finance construction of the Empire State Plaza, a large state government office complex near Albany&#x27;s downtown area. The plaza&#x27;s tallest building, Erastus Corning Tower, was named in Corning&#x27;s honor.

In the early 1980s, Corning&#x27;s health began to deteriorate. In January 1983, he was moved to University Hospital in Boston, where he died on May 28. Corning was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York. At over 41 years, Corning&#x27;s tenure makes him Albany&#x27;s longest-serving mayor, as well as the longest-tenured mayor ever of any large city in the United States.

==Early life==
Erastus Corning 2nd was born in Albany, New York on October 7, 1909, the son of Louise Maxwell and Edwin Corning. Corning&#x27;s mother was born to American parents in Cawnpore, India, where her father Allan was serving as a missionary. After the 1890 death of Allan Maxwell, her mother Ellen became a successful novelist and married U.S. Navy admiral Albert S. Barker.

Corning&#x27;s father was from an Albany-area family prominent in business and politics. Corning was educated at The Albany Academy and Groton School. In 1928, he began attendance at Yale University. Corning graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1932 and was a member of the Chi Psi fraternity, Wolf&#x27;s Head senior society, and Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society.

==Early career==
After graduating from college, Corning started an insurance company and soon entered politics. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Albany Co., 1st D.) in 1936; and of the New York State Senate (30th D.) from 1937 to 1941, sitting in the 160th, 161st, 162nd and 163rd New York State Legislatures. He resigned his seat on August 1, 1941, to seek the Democratic nomination for Mayor of Albany.

Corning won the first of his 11 terms as mayor in November 1941, easily defeating the Republican candidate, Benjamin R. Hoff, by nearly 46,000 votes. Corning took office on January 1, 1942.

Shortly after his first term began, the newly elected Governor Thomas E. Dewey had the powerful Albany Democratic political machine, run by &quot;Boss&quot; Daniel P. O&#x27;Connell, investigated. The investigations proved largely unsuccessful and left Corning and O&#x27;Connell unscathed. This political machine proved to be one of the most durable in American history, even outlasting the Daley family machine in Chicago.

==Military service==

After having been previously classified as ineligible for military service during World War II, in 1944, Corning&#x27;s draft status was changed and he was found eligible. Opting not to apply for an officer&#x27;s commission or specialty training in a field such as civil affairs, he joined the United States Army as a private. During his absence, Frank Harris, a member of the city council, served as acting mayor.

Corning underwent training as an Infantryman at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and Camp Blanding, Florida. Assigned to the 38th Infantry Regiment, a unit of the 2nd Infantry Division, he arrived in France with his unit in October, 1944. In France, Corning was initially attached to an organization that performed rebuilding duties in towns and villages that had been liberated from German occupation. During late 1944 and early 1945, he took part in the Battle of the Bulge and the Western Allied invasion of Germany and attained the rank of private first class.

In the fall of 1945, Corning was discharged and returned to Albany. His awards included the Combat Infantryman Badge, Bronze Star Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two battle stars, World War II Victory Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, and the Presidential Unit Citation, which was awarded to Corning&#x27;s battalion.

==Post-World War II career==
At the New York state election, 1946, Corning ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York on the ticket with James M. Mead for governor, but they were defeated by the incumbent Republicans Dewey and Joe R. Hanley.

Corning served ten full consecutive terms as mayor after his return from the war. His insurance firm profited from being the sole bidder on Albany County insurance contracts for many years. Corning defended this apparent conflict of interest by noting that he himself was not a county official.

Corning was re-elected in landslides for most of his career. The most notable exception was 1973 when a prominent businessman and reform candidate, Carl Touhey, ran a well-financed Republican campaign and came within 3,500 votes of defeating him. In 1977, Corning faced a primary election challenge from State Senator Howard C. Nolan Jr., defeating him by a comfortable margin.

Corning&#x27;s last mayoral re-election came in 1981, when he defeated Charles Touhey (the son of 1973 mayoral candidate Carl Touhey) by a two-to-one margin. During his final term in office, his health deteriorated. He died in office in 1983.

==Personal life==
In 1932, Corning married Elizabeth Norris Platt (1912–1993). They were the parents of two children, Erastus Corning III and Bettina Corning Dudley.

Corning&#x27;s extended family was prominent in Albany-area business in politics for several generations. In addition to his father Edwin, who served as lieutenant governor, Corning&#x27;s family included: Erastus Corning (great-grandfather); Amasa J. Parker (great-grandfather); Parker Corning (uncle); and Edwin Corning Jr. (brother).

Dorothea &quot;Polly&quot; Noonan—a onetime secretary to Corning, a vice chairwoman of the Democratic State Committee, and a longtime president of the Albany Democratic Women&#x27;s Club—was Corning&#x27;s &quot;closest confidante&quot;. According to author Paul Grondahl, the lives of Corning and Noonan were &quot;&#x27;inextricably linked through politics and personal devotion&#x27;&quot;. Author William Kennedy recalled in his book “O Albany!” that at Corning&#x27;s funeral, members of the media were asked not to &quot;&#x27;focus undue attention&#x27;&quot; on Noonan. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Corning, &quot;in effect, disinherited his wife and children. He left the Noonan family his insurance business, which generously sold policies to anyone who wanted to do business with the government&quot;.

Corning referred to himself as &quot;Erastus Corning 2nd&quot;, preferring it to &quot;Erastus Corning II&quot; or &quot;Erastus Corning Jr.&quot;

On May 28, 1983, following a year-long illness, Corning died of cardio-pulmonary failure at University Hospital in Boston. He is interred at Albany Rural Cemetery.

==Legacy==

The Erastus Corning Tower, the tallest building in Albany and the tallest in the state outside New York City, is named for him, as is the Corning Riverfront Park, a nature trail and fishing site on the western banks of the Hudson River in Albany. The tower is part of the Empire State Plaza, a , 11-building state government office and cultural complex. Some believe that the building was named after Corning because it has 42 floors (which is the same as the number of years he served as mayor), but the building actually has 44 floors with an observation deck on Floor 42. Completed in 1973, the skyscraper was dedicated to Corning upon his death in 1983.

Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands named Corning an officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau, the country&#x27;s highest citizen honor, in gratitude for his aid to Nijmegen following World War II.

<doc id="1020682" wikidata="Q756154" url="?curid=1020682" title="Atlanta Bread Company">
<text>Atlanta Bread Company is a privately owned American chain of bakery-café fast casual restaurants with 10 locations in three states. Its headquarters are in Smyrna, Georgia, a suburb northwest of Atlanta. Offerings include bakery items, pasta, salads, sandwiches, soups, and specialty drinks. 

Aside from the bakery section, Atlanta Bread has a regular menu for dine-in or takeout including: flatbreads, paninis, salads, sandwiches, side choices, and soups, as well as coffee, espresso drinks, frozen drinks, fruit smoothies, hot chocolate, iced drinks, lattes, lemonade, and tea. Despite the similar name and type of outlets, Atlanta Bread carries no relation to the American bakery-café chain Panera Bread.

==History==
Atlanta Bread was founded by Robert and Richard Auffenberg in 1993, in Sandy Springs, Georgia (part of the Atlanta metropolitan area), where it started as a single restaurant. In 1994, Jerry Couvaras moved to Atlanta and discovered the restaurant. That year, he joined the company as the manager of a restaurant location in Marietta, Georgia. Couvaras was born and raised in South Africa, and had previously worked as an investment banker. Couvaras was appointed as the Atlanta Bread Company&#x27;s president and chief executive officer (CEO) in 1995, while his brother, Basil Couvaras, became the chief operating officer (COO) that year. By that time, the Couvaras brothers were selling franchises under the Atlanta Bread Company name.

By 1995, the owners began franchising and expanding across the country.

In 1999, Atlanta Bread Company was among the fastest-growing franchises in the United States, with plans to rapidly double its number of restaurant locations. That year, the Couvaras brothers settled a lawsuit filed by the Auffenbergs the previous year which alleged that they unfairly gained control and ownership of the business. The settlement required that the Couvaras brothers pay the Auffenbergs millions of dollars in royalties over the next 15 years.

In March 2004, Jerry Couvaras was arrested in Johannesburg, South Africa, and was charged with fraud after approximately 2,000 South Africans lost a total of $5.54 million as part of an alleged investment scheme that failed in 1993 after the liquidation of two investment companies. The charges were unrelated to the Atlanta Bread Company. Basil Couvaras was appointed to run the company while Jerry Couvaras — who remained as president and CEO — stayed in Johannesburg until the charges could be resolved. Basil Couvaras was later charged in the case as well.

In November 2004, Jerry and Basil Couvaras pleaded guilty to a banking violation and agreed to pay fines, while remaining fraud charges against them were dismissed. Jerry Couvaras said, &quot;It was disappointing when it happened because we felt we had not done anything wrong. Unfortunately we had to plead to something. We felt the fine would be the quickest way to get back to doing our business.&quot; Company officials stated that the charges were related to a decade-old lawsuit that had previously been settled; Jerry Couvaras further stated, &quot;I think people can really see through what&#x27;s happened here. People can see what this was really about. I think it was really old animosity.&quot;

In 2004, Atlanta Bread Company had 5,000 employees and was one of the largest cafe and bakery chains in the United States, with 170 restaurant locations in 25 states. Sean Lupton-Smith was one of the company&#x27;s most financially successful franchisees, with five locations that generated profits of nearly $2 million per year. In January 2007, Lupton-Smith sued the company for $12 million, alleging that the company had wrongfully terminated his ownership of the restaurants. Revenue and store locations decreased significantly after 2004, partially because of poor locations and issues with franchisees that included legal problems; the company had sued franchisees or had been sued eight times between 2001 and 2011.

In 2010, the company had a revenue of $122 million.

In 2011, the company had 74 locations in 20 states, including 13 company-owned stores; 44 stores had been closed since 2008, when the Great Recession began. Jerry Couvaras stated that the store closings were primarily part of a business strategy in order to gain revenue to remodel existing stores that were left open. Between 2001 and 2011, 66 loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) were made to Atlanta Bread Company franchisees. Half of the loans failed, totaling $32.8 million, with a loss of $5 million for the United States federal government. As of 2011, Atlanta Bread Company ranked at number 11 on the SBA website&#x27;s list of the 25 worst-performing large franchises.

Atlanta Bread Company has received accolades over its history, including being ranked in the top 100 of &quot;Fast Casual&quot;″s &quot;Movers &amp; Shakers&quot;in 2011.

As of November 2024, there are 10 restaurant locations in three states.

<text>Robert Aske (&quot;c.&quot; 1500 – 12 July 1537) was an English lawyer who became a leader of the Pilgrimage of Grace uprising against the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 in 1536. He was executed for treason against King Henry VIII on 12 July 1537.

==Life==
Aske was a younger son of Sir Robert Aske of Aughton near Selby, of an old Yorkshire family. Aske was well connected: his mother, Elizabeth Clifford, was a daughter of John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford, and his wife Margaret Bromflete (only daughter of Sir Henry Bromflete; and Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, was his first cousin once removed. Queen Jane Seymour was also his third cousin, also through his mother.

Aske became a barrister and was a Fellow of Gray&#x27;s Inn. A devout Catholic, he objected to Henry&#x27;s religious revolt, particularly the Dissolution of the Monasteries. When rebellion broke out in York against Henry VIII, Aske was returning to Yorkshire from London. Not initially involved in the rebellion, he took up the cause of the rebels and headed the Pilgrimage of Grace. By 10 October 1536, he had come to be regarded as their &quot;chief captain&quot;. Most of Yorkshire, and parts of Northumberland, Durham, Cumberland, and Westmorland were in revolt.

Nine thousand insurgents marched on York, where Aske arranged for the expelled monks and nuns to return to their houses; the King&#x27;s tenants were driven out and religious observance resumed.

On 13 November 1536, Aske treated with the royal delegates, including Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and received an assurance of an audience and safe passage to the King. Among the insurgents&#x27; requests was punishment of heretical bishops and of the King&#x27;s evil advisers, recall of his anti-ecclesiastical legislation, prosecution of his &quot;visitors&quot;, Lee and Layton, and a parliament in the North. He travelled to London, met Henry VIII, and received promises of redress and safe passage.

As he began his journey back north, fighting broke out again. This renewed fighting caused Henry to change his mind, and he had Aske arrested and brought to the Tower of London. Aske was convicted of high treason in Palace of Westminster and was taken back to York, where he was executed on 12 July 1537, on a scaffold erected outside Clifford&#x27;s Tower.

==Portrayals==

There are no known surviving portraits of Aske. All that is known of his physical appearance is that he was blind in one eye.

Aske was played by Sean Bean in the television serial &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (2003) in which he is inaccurately portrayed as a violent former lieutenant of Henry&#x27;s army.

Aske was also portrayed by Gerard McSorley in the third season of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The Tudors&quot;. At the time of filming, McSorley was twenty years older than Aske was when he died. The series also shows Aske with a young family, while, in fact, he was not married.

The circumstances surrounding Aske&#x27;s life feature prominently in C. J. Sansom&#x27;s novel &quot;Sovereign&quot; and H. F. M. Prescott&#x27;s novel &quot;The Man on a Donkey&quot;.

The events surrounding the Pilgrimage of Grace, its instigators and its outcomes form a significant episode in Hilary Mantel&#x27;s novel &quot;The Mirror &amp; the Light&quot;. The novel looks at the rebellion through the thoughts and actions of Thomas Cromwell in his capacity as a chief adviser to Henry VIII.

The actor Graham Turner portrayed Aske in David Starkey&#x27;s 2009 documentary series &quot;Henry VIII: The Mind of a Tyrant&quot;.

<text>Daniel Chamier (1564–1621) was a Huguenot minister in France, founder of the Academy of Montpellier and author.

==Life and work==
Chamier was born at the castle of Le Mont, near Mocas and west of Grenoble. His father was from Avignon and a Protestant convert, a pastor at Montélimar. Daniel studied at the now defunct University of Orange (1365-1793) and at Geneva under Theodore Beza and Antoine de la Faye (1540–1615), in the period 1583 to 1589. He was ordained minister at Montpellier, and about 1595 succeeded his father at Montélimar.

His provincial synod appointed him deputy to the National Synod at Saumur, and the gathering at Loudun in 1596. He was involved in drafting the Edict of Nantes, and brought the Edict to the Synod of Montpellier in 1598. In 1601 and 1602 he took part in discussions at Montpellier with the Jesuits Pierre Coton and Gaultier. In 1603 he presided over the National Synod at Gap, France, where an article was added to the Reformed Confession of faith declaring the Pope to be the Antichrist.

In 1607 Henry IV of France granted him permission as representative of the Church of Dauphiné to establish an academy at Montpellier, and he became professor there. Chamier returned, however, after a short time to Montélimar. In 1612 he became pastor and professor at Montauban. When Louis XIII besieged the city in 1621, Chamier sent his students to the walls, and was mortally wounded during the defense.

==Family==
He was married, his wife&#x27;s name being Portal. They had a son, Adrien, and three daughters.

English actor Daniel Craig is among his descendants (link partially broken by John Ezechiel Chamier who was born under surname Deschamps but requested to be changed by his uncle Anthony Chamier and ended with Georgette Grace Chamier who married John Charin Wroughton and only Chamier sibling with children)., as well as Anthony Chamier, George Chamier, Frederick Chamier, Edward Chamier and John Adrian Chamier.

==Works==
He was a supralapsarian but differed from John Calvin concerning Christ&#x27;s descent into hell and angels. He wrote:

* &quot;Dispute de la vocation des ministres de l&#x27;Église reformée&quot; (La Rochelle, 1589);
* &quot;Epistolæ jesuiticæ&quot; (Geneva, 1599);

<text>The Aerauto PL.5C was a roadable aircraft developed in Italy in the early 1950s. It was a high-wing two-seat monoplane whose wings could be folded to quickly transform it into an automobile. It was different from many such projects in that it used its pusher propeller (powered by a Continental C85) for propulsion not only in the air, but on the road as well. Development was abandoned in 1953.

Designed by aircraft engineer Luigi Pellarini, the Aerauto was built by Carrozzeria Colli in Milan.

<doc id="1020689" wikidata="Q11519" url="?curid=1020689" title="Mission Dolores Park">
<text>Mission Dolores Park, often abbreviated to Dolores Park, is a city park in San Francisco, California. It is located two blocks south of Mission Dolores at the western edge of the Mission District.

Dolores Park is bounded by 18th Street on the north, 20th Street on the south, Dolores Street on the east and Church Street on the west. The northern end of Dolores Park is located directly across the street from Mission High School. On its eastern, southern and western sides, the park is surrounded by residential buildings of two to four stories, in various architectural styles. South of the park is a hillside area known as &quot;Dolores Heights,&quot; while The Castro neighborhood is located a short distance to the west. The park&#x27;s topography is characterized by a strong slope from the southwest down to the northeast, offering an unobstructed northeast-looking view of downtown San Francisco, in particular from the southwest corner.

Dolores Park offers several features including many tennis courts, a basketball court, a multi-purpose court, a soccer field, a pissoir, a children&#x27;s playground, and a dog play area. The southern half of the park is also notable for its views of the Mission district, downtown, the San Francisco Bay and the East Bay. The Muni Metro J-Church streetcar line runs through the park along its western border.

The park lies east of Twin Peaks in the warm and sunny microclimate of the Mission neighborhood, which was named one of the coolest neighborhoods in the world in 2016. As of 2016, Dolores Park was attracting up to 7,000–10,000 people on a sunny weekend day.

==History==
Native Americans of the Chutchui village of the Yelamu tribe inhabited the area prior to the arrival of Spanish missionaries, who founded nearby Mission Dolores in 1776.

The park site consists of two plots, Mission Blocks #86 and #87, formerly owned by Congregation Sherith Israel and Congregation Emanu-El and was used as a Jewish cemetery, which became inactive in 1894. The cemetery was moved to San Mateo County when San Francisco land became too valuable for the dead and burial within the city limits was prohibited. The graves were moved to Colma (via Southern Pacific railroad), where they still rest today at Hills of Eternity and Home of Peace Cemeteries.In 1903, over 1,000 property owners from the southern side of San Francisco formed the Mission Park Association, which introduced a ballot measure to buy the former Jewish cemetery area and turn it into a park. It passed by 73.9% later in the same year, initiating the creation of what was back then named &quot;Mission Park&quot;. In 1905, the City of San Francisco bought the land for $291,350 (equivalent to about $4 million in 2004).

In 1906–07, the park served as a refugee camp for more than 1600 families made homeless by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. Camp life after the earthquake ended in the summer of 1908. Some people kept their temporary shacks as houses and a few still survive today scattered across western San Francisco. In 1917, the J-Church streetcar line, which runs along one side of the park, began service.

Until after World War II, the Mission District was largely inhabited by European Americans, which from the 1950s to the 1970s were replaced by an influx of Latino immigrants. Partly as a symbol of this transformation, on September 16, 1966, a replica of the “Mexican Liberty Bell”, presented by Mexican president Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, was installed in the park near a statue of Miguel Hidalgo, the father of Mexican independence, which had been erected four years earlier. The &quot;Mexican Liberty Bell&quot; (today located in the National Palace in Mexico City) is a church bell that Hidalgo rang in 1810 in the Mexican city of Dolores Hidalgo, in what became known as the &quot;Cry of Dolores&quot; (El Grito de Dolores) that launched the Mexican War of Independence. In 2014, the replica was relocated by around 25 feet during the renovations of Mission Dolores Park.

In subsequent decades, the park also became popular among LGBT residents from the nearby Castro district (an area near the park&#x27;s south-west corner has been dubbed the &quot;gay beach&quot;) and among young professionals who moved to the area to work at Internet tech companies. In 2009, the San Francisco Chronicle observed that &quot;as the wide variety of park visitors indicates - from Latino families to young hipsters to Castro gays - it sits at the intersection of a number of San Francisco demographic groups. And it always has.&quot; Dolores Park has hosted political rallies, festivals, Aztec ceremonial dances, Cinco de Mayo celebrations, San Francisco Mime Troupe performances, and an annual &quot;Hunky Jesus&quot; competition on Easter by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.In March 2014, the San Francisco Recreation &amp; Park Department began a two-stage $20.5 million renovation project made possible by the 2008 Clean &amp; Safe Park Neighborhood Bond to upgrade the park. Community-driven meetings lead to the conceptual design of the improvement project. Input from local community members, neighbors, merchants, the San Francisco Recreation &amp; Parks Department, the San Francisco Department of Public Works, and other major stakeholders shaped the final design. The park was fully reopened in January 2016 with a light-up event. To address trash issues in the park, a Leave No Trace campaign was also launched encouraging park users to &quot;pack it in, pack it out.&quot; In the years up to 2016, according to a SF Rec &amp; Parks spokesperson, &quot;Dolores Park [had] seen an exponential increase in the number of visitors: On a sunny Saturday, it can host between 7,000 and 10,000 people.&quot; 

According to a 2011 historical study commissioned by the city, &quot;between 1967 and the present, Mission Park gradually acquired the vernacular name &#x27;Dolores Park,&#x27; presumably in recognition of its association with both Mission Dolores and Dolores Street. Today, the name Mission Park has been completely superseded&quot;. The park&#x27;s official name as of 2016, is &quot;Mission Dolores Park&quot;.

In an informal annual tradition that had become known as the &quot;Dolores Park Hill Bomb&quot; by 2018, hundreds of skateboarders gather on Dolores Street across from Dolores Park every July for an impromptu hill bombing event. There have been some injuries and at least one death associated with the event. The city has made repeated attempts to prevent the event from happening, e.g. by installing Botts dots in 2020, using kettling and mass arrests in 2023 and by blocking off streets and part of the park in 2024. However, skaters returned in spite of those.

==Facilities==
Dolores Park is served by the Church and 18th Street and Right Of Way/20th St stations of the J Church Muni Metro line, which operates in a private right-of-way on the park&#x27;s west side. There are six tennis courts and one basketball court; two soccer fields, a playground, and a clubhouse with public restrooms. In 2010, it was announced that the park was to be closed throughout 2011 as part of massive renovations and a construction of a new playground. In spring 2012, the new Helen Diller Playground opened in the park, featuring two large slides, two swing sets, a granite climbing structure, a sand box and climbing nets. The playground is accessible to children with disabilities. As of 2014, there were plans for two off-leash dog play spaces in the park, but these plans were stalled by an environmental appeal from a local resident who felt that the space should be left open to allow more room for children to play, with the goal of reducing childhood obesity. 

Up to 2016, more than $20 million were spent on the park&#x27;s first upgrades in six decades, including the installation of additional toilets to address problems with public urination. Following the renovations, the park contains six tennis courts, a multi-use court, a basketball court, a sports field, the Helen Diller Playground, a pissoir, two off-leash dog areas, improved irrigation, and two public restroom areas.

<text>Mark&quot;Boo&quot;Hewerdine (born 14 February 1961) is an English singer-songwriter and record producer. His work includes lead singer and creative force behind The Bible, formed in the 1980s, and reformed in 1994, as well as solo recordings and work for film. He has also produced records by several artists, including a long association with Eddi Reader. He has been described as &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s most consistently accomplished songwriters&quot;.

==Career==

===Early life and The Great Divide===
Born Mark Hewerdine grew up in North London, before moving to Cambridge while still a child, and as a teenager formed the short-lived band Placebo Thing with a friend. He worked in the warehouse of Andy&#x27;s Records in Bury St Edmunds, where he was exposed to a wide range of music. He joined The Great Divide in 1983, and the band were signed to Cambridge independent label Wimp Records by local entrepreneur David Gowar, and recorded and released their debut single &quot;Who Broke the Love Bank&quot; in 1982. They were heard by Mike Scott of The Waterboys, who recommended them to Ensign Records, who bought out their contract with Wimp, and they subsequently cut three commercially unsuccessful singles on Ensign.

===The Bible===

In 1985 Hewerdine, working once again in a record shop in Cambridge (The Beat Goes On), formed The Bible with jazz drummer Tony Shepherd, later recruiting former Great Divide bandmate Kevin Flanagan. They released an album of songs in 1986 through the independent Norwich label Backs Records called &quot;Walking The Ghost Back Home&quot;.

The Bible became a fairly successful independent band, with a cult following spread mostly through word of mouth and live performances. Two tracks from the first album, &quot;Graceland&quot; and &quot;Mahalia&quot; were released as singles, but failed to bring them commercial success. The album however was very well received by music pundits, and this brought the band to the attention of Chrysalis Records. Signing to Chrysalis at the end of 1986, &quot;Graceland&quot; was re-released as a single, and reached number 86 in the UK singles chart. A new album, the Steve Earle-produced &quot;Eureka&quot; followed, but failed commercially. A new version of &quot;Graceland&quot; gave the band their biggest hit (number 51) in 1989. In 1990, Hewerdine decided to leave the group and pursue solo projects.

===Solo===
At around this time Hewerdine was introduced by a label A&amp;R man to US &quot;new country&quot; singer Darden Smith, and this set him off in a new direction. Working together, he and Smith wrote the album &quot;Evidence&quot; in around nine days. The album was released in 1989 to critical acclaim. The two went on to tour together in 1996. Hewerdine also worked on new solo songs, largely based on his earlier traumatic experiences in London. Eventually these were distilled down to produce his debut solo album proper, &quot;Ignorance&quot;, released in 1992. Invited by Tori Amos to play support promoting these songs, Hewerdine managed to find a new audience and &quot;Ignorance&quot; and a single from the album, &quot;History&quot;, did relatively well commercially.

As Hewerdine&#x27;s star rose, he started to write for other artists, among them Eddi Reader, Clive Gregson and Christine Collister. The Bible reformed in 1993 for a tour the following year and also released an EP of new material (&quot;The Dreamlife EP&quot;) and an album of b sides and extra&#x27;s called &quot;Random Acts of Kindness&quot;. The band split again in December 1994 and a new album remained unreleased (the title was used for a later compilation), although songs from the album were re-recorded by Hewerdine on his John Wood-produced 1996 album &quot;Baptist Hospital&quot;, which featured contributions from Eddi Reader and Richard Thompson. &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; followed in 1999, which featured a guest appearance from Martha Wainwright and was described by Allmusic writer Rick Anderson as &quot;sometimes very pretty in a Beatlesque way and sometimes moving&quot;, and &quot;Anon&quot; in 2002.

In 2001 Hewerdine was invited to act as &#x27;songwriter in residence&#x27; at the Performing Rights Society&#x27;s &quot;The Song&#x27;s the Thing&quot; concert series in London, also performing at one of the concerts.

&quot;Harmonograph&quot; was released on MVine/Red Grape Records in February 2006, a collection of his songs originally recorded by other artists such as Eddi Reader and Hepburn, recorded by Hewerdine for the first time, with accompaniment from another former member of The Bible, Neill MacColl. The &quot;Toy Box&quot; nos. 1 and 2 EPs were released in 2008. &quot;God Bless The Pretty Things&quot;, was released in 2009. Recorded in Glasgow, with a band including John McCusker, Alan Kelly, Ewen Vernal, and Heidi Talbot, the album was described by the BBC as &quot;timeless songs for all seasons&quot; and &quot;an album of unusual class and sensitivity&quot;. &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; gave the album a four-star review, calling it &quot;exceptional, an album of superior Anglo-Saxon Americana&quot;.

In 2010 he appeared with Chris Difford and Justin Currie on BBC Four programme &quot;Songwriters&#x27; Circle&quot;.

===State of the Union===
Hewerdine first performed with Cambridge-based American guitarist Brooks Williams in 2010 after adding him to the bill of his annual Christmas show in his home town of Ely at the last minute when guests Chris Difford and Barry McGuigan were unable to attend due to weather conditions. In 2011, Hewerdine teamed up with Williams to form the band State of the Union. Their plan was to record an album using vintage microphones and equipment live at Kyoti Studio with Mark Freegard Glasgow studio in just five days, although they completed the album in only a day and a half. They followed the album with the EP &quot;Rent&quot;, the title track of which (a cover version of the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; song) was performed on &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; in December 2012.

State of the Union played their first gig at the 2011 Ely Folk Festival, and played at the Celtic Connections festival in January 2012. The album was released in April 2012 on Reveal Records and was followed by a tour.

===Film and television===
Hewerdine was invited by Nick Hornby to write music for the soundtrack of the 1997 &quot;film adaptation&quot; of his book &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;. With Neill MacColl he also wrote music for the soundtrack of Shane Meadows&#x27; &quot;Twenty Four Seven&quot; and David Evans&#x27; television film &quot;Our Boy&quot;, both also from 1997. He also had a track included in the soundtrack of Christine Lahti&#x27;s &quot;My First Mister&quot; (2001), and in 2003 his &quot;Different God&quot; was used in the film &quot;Intermission&quot;.

Hewerdine&#x27;s song &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; (from &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;) has been used in several television dramas, including an award-winning death scene in &quot;Emmerdale&quot;.

===Production and writing work===
Hewerdine collaborated over several years with Eddi Reader, as producer, songwriter and guitarist in her band. His song &quot;Patience of Angels&quot;, originally written for The Bible, was recorded by Reader for her self-titled 1994 album, which featured several Hewerdine compositions, and was a top 40 hit in the UK Singles Chart when released as a single. Hewerdine also co-produced Eddi Reader&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Angels &amp; Electricity&quot; and her 2003 album &quot;Sings the Songs of Robert Burns&quot;.

His other production work includes albums with The Corrs, Heidi Talbot, and Laurie Freelove. He co-wrote and produced Chris Difford&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;The Last Temptation of Chris&quot;.

He has also written songs recorded by K.d. Lang (&quot;Last Cigarette&quot;), Paul Young, Melanie C, Marti Pellow, David McAlmont, Brian Kennedy, Kris Drever, Sarah Jane Morris, Alex Parks, and Natalie Imbruglia.

===Awards and recognition===
&quot;Patience of Angels&quot; brought a nomination for the Ivor Novello Award for Hewerdine in 1995.

In a 2009 review of his album &quot;God Bless the Pretty Things&quot;, the BBC described Hewerdine as &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s most consistently accomplished songwriters&quot;. Nick Coleman of &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; described Hewerdine as &quot;one of the best songwriters we have&quot;. The &quot;Birmingham Evening Mail&quot; described him as &quot;one of the country&#x27;s finest lyricists&quot;.

<text>Asterius of Cappadocia (Ἀστέριος; died c. 341) was an Arian Christian theologian from Cappadocia. 

Few of his writings have been recovered in their entirety; the latest edition is by Markus Vinzent). He is said to have been a pupil of Lucian of Antioch, but it is unclear to what extent this was the case. He is said to have relapsed into paganism during the persecution under Maximian in 304 and thus, though received again into the church by Lucian and supported by the Eusebian party, never attained to ecclesiastical office. He was present at the synod of Antioch in 341.

His extant works include a &quot;Commentary on the Psalms&quot; made up of 31 sermons , a letter to Eusebius, the &quot;Syntagmation&quot;, and a few fragments. Fragments of his &quot;Syntagmation&quot; are preserved by Athanasius of Alexandria and Marcellus of Ancyra.

Asterius was a firm defender of Arianism and Eusebius of Caesarea&#x27;s theology, emphasising the derivative nature of the Son as a spontaneous manifestation and generation of the Father&#x27;s will.

<doc id="1020701" wikidata="Q890523" url="?curid=1020701" title="Secondo Pia">
<text>Secondo Pia (9 September 1855 – 7 September 1941) was an Italian lawyer and amateur photographer. He is best known for taking the first photographs of the Shroud of Turin on 28 May 1898 and, when he was developing them, noticing that the photographic negatives showed a positive image of the man in the shroud in addition to a clearer rendition of the image. The image he obtained from the shroud has been approved by the Roman Catholic Church as part of the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus.

Pia was born in Asti, Piedmont, and was an attorney who was also interested in art and science. In the early 1870s he began to explore the new technology of photography, and by the 1890s he was a city councilor and a member of Turin&#x27;s Amateur Photographers&#x27; Club. He became a well known photographer in Turin, and examples of his other photographs are now part of the historical collection at the Turin Cinema Museum. Pia can be considered a pioneer in the field of photography for using electric lightbulbs in the 1890s, as lightbulbs were a novelty in the late nineteenth century, with Thomas Edison&#x27;s reliable incandescent light bulb having been invented in 1879.

== The accidental photographer ==

It was by accident that Secondo Pia unwittingly took the first step in the field of modern sindonology (the formal study of the shroud of Turin). In 1898 the city of Turin was celebrating the 400th anniversary of Turin Cathedral along with the 50th anniversary of Italy&#x27;s Statuto Albertino constitution of 1848 in favor of the House of Savoy. As part of the celebration, a sacred art exhibition was planned. Since a public display of the shroud would have required permission from King Umberto I of Italy, who owned it, plans were made for two artists to paint realistic replicas of the shroud to be used instead. These paintings were made, but they were never used as part of the exhibition.

The head of the Shroud Commission, Baron Manno, petitioned the king for a public display and also asked for the right to photograph the shroud – with the help of Secondo Pia – to promote the exhibition. The king approved the public display of the shroud for the exhibition and later also allowed for it to be photographed. At that time the House of Savoy was based in Turin, and the shroud was already in Turin since it belonged to the king. No one knew yet that the clearer reverse image existed on the shroud, for the faint face image on the shroud cannot be clearly observed or recognized with the naked eye.

Secondo Pia was named the official photographer for the exhibition at a late date. The eight-day exhibition was just about to start, and it was too late for his proposed photograph to be part of the promotional campaign. Yet he took the opportunity to take the first photograph of the shroud.

== The famed photograph ==
On 25 May 1898, after the opening ceremony and during the noon closure of the exhibition, Pia set up equipment in Turin Cathedral. Two other people, Father Sanno Salaro and the head of cathedral security, Lieutenant Felice Fino, were also present and took part in the photography. It was one of the first times an electric light bulb was used to take a photograph.

The logistics of organizing the photographic session and the required equipment were a challenge to Pia, but he managed to set up two electric lamps of about 1000 candelas each. Since there was no electricity in the cathedral, Pia set up a portable generator. He managed to make a few exposures in the resulting heat before the session was interrupted by the opening of the cathedral doors after the noon closure. The results of this session were not successful once the plates were developed.

Three days later, on the evening of 28 May, Pia returned for a second session at about 9:30 pm and took a few more exposures. Based on his experience of 25 May, he varied the exposure times and the lighting. At around midnight the three men went back to develop the plates. Pia later said that he almost dropped and broke the photographic plate in the darkroom from the shock of what appeared on it: the reverse plate showed the positive image of a man and a face in a detail that could not be seen with the naked eye.

== Ongoing developments ==
On 2 June 1898, the exhibition ended and the shroud was returned to its casket in the royal chapel. Genoa&#x27;s &quot;Il Cittadino&quot; newspaper reported Pia&#x27;s photograph on 13 June, and a day later the story appeared in the national newspaper &quot;Corriere Nazionale&quot;. On 15 June the Vatican newspaper &quot;Osservatore Romano&quot; covered the story.

The next few years witnessed a number of debates about Pia&#x27;s photograph, with various suggestions of supernatural origin versus accusations of errors in his work, his doctoring of the photographs, etc. In the meantime, King Umberto I of Italy, whose permission was instrumental for the Pia photograph, was assassinated in July 1900 and did not see the full story unfold.

Some definite support for Secondo Pia eventually arrived in 1931 when a professional photographer, Giuseppe Enrie, also photographed the shroud and his findings supported Pia. When Enrie&#x27;s photograph was first exhibited, Secondo Pia, then in his seventies, was among those present for viewing. Pia reportedly breathed a deep sigh of relief when he saw Enrie&#x27;s photograph.

The scientific and religious discussions and debates about the origins of the image that Pia photographed continued. On the religious front, in 1939 Pia&#x27;s negative image was used by Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli, a nun in Milan, to coin the Holy Face medal, as part of the Catholic devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus. Pope Pius XII approved the devotion and the medal and in 1958 declared the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Roman Catholics. On the occasion of the 100th year of Secondo Pia&#x27;s first photograph, on 24 May 1998, Pope John Paul II visited Turin Cathedral. In his address on that day, he said, &quot;the Shroud is an image of God&#x27;s love as well as of human sin&quot;, and he called the shroud &quot;an icon of the suffering of the innocent in every age&quot;.

On the scientific front, in 2004 the optical journal of the Institute of Physics in London published a reviewed article on new imaging techniques applied to the shroud during its restoration in 2002. Scientific debate about the image and the shroud continues with international conferences.

<doc id="1020702" wikidata="Q312394" url="?curid=1020702" title="The House of the Spirits (film)">
<text>The House of the Spirits (Danish: &quot;Åndernes hus&quot;) is a 1993 period drama film directed by Bille August and starring Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Winona Ryder, Antonio Banderas and Vanessa Redgrave. The supporting cast includes María Conchita Alonso, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Jan Niklas. Based on the 1982 novel of the same name by Isabel Allende, the film follows three generations of women from a Chilean family during the country’s military dictatorship.

Although the film won several awards in Europe, including Best Film at the Lola Awards from the German Film Academy and the Robert Award from the Danish Film Academy, in America it was regarded as a critical and commercial failure.

== Plot ==
The story is narrated by Blanca Trueba, a young woman from a powerful Chilean family.

=== 1926 ===
Blanca&#x27;s mother, Clara del Valle is a child from a well-off family in Santiago whose father is running for the Senate. Clara possesses clairvoyant abilities and foresees her own marriage to Esteban Trueba, a miner.

Esteban uses the gold he found from mining to buy a hacienda, Tres Marías. He employs natives to work as peasants on the dilapidated land, eventually turning Tres Marías into a successful estate through his use of brute force. One day while horseback riding through the countryside, he sees a peasant girl, Pancha García. Esteban rapes Pancha, resulting in the illegitimate birth of a boy. He also spends nights with Tránsito, a local prostitute to whom he lends money so she can start a new career in the capital.

=== 1946 ===
Twenty years later, Esteban’s sister Férula informs him that their ailing mother has died. At his mother’s funeral, Esteban sees a grown Clara and reacquaints himself with her. The couple marry, and Clara and Férula become especially close, with Clara allowing Férula to come live with her and her new husband at Tres Marías.

Clara eventually gives birth to a girl, naming her Blanca. One day, Pancha García appears at the family estate with her now teenaged son, Esteban García, asking his father for money. Esteban Trueba gives them some money but harshly turns them away. Esteban’s rejection leads his son Esteban, to nurse a resentment against his father and Blanca.

Meanwhile, Blanca befriends one of the peasant children, Pedro Tercero, the young son of Esteban&#x27;s foreman Segundo. Esteban disapproves of his daughter playing with a peasant boy and sends her to a boarding school.

=== 1962 ===
After graduating from boarding school, Blanca returns to Tres Marías and reunites with Pedro, meeting him by the river every night. Férula continues to live with the family and has become a rival to her brother for Clara’s affections. Esteban throws Férula out of the house when he catches her and Clara asleep in the same bed. Before leaving, Férula curses Esteban to eternal loneliness.

Esteban catches Pedro preaching revolutionary ideas that are critical of wealthy landowners like him to the peasant workers. He punishes Pedro with a whipping and banishment from Tres Marías. That night at dinner, Clara and Blanca see a vision of Férula while having dinner. Férula kisses Clara on the forehead before calmly walking out. Realizing Férula has died, Clara drives into town to find Férula dead in her modest home. In a moment alone with Férula, Clara tells her how much she and Blanca miss her, and how proud she would be of Blanca.

Blanca continues to meet Pedro in secret. Jean de Satigny, a French nobleman who aspires to go into business with Esteban, sees Blanca and Pedro in a tryst at the river and rats her out to her father. Esteban punishes Blanca by whipping her and vows to go after Pedro. He strikes Clara when she points out his hypocrisy—having himself slept with women not of his own class—after which Clara vows never to speak to him again. She leaves Tres Marías with Blanca to live in Santiago.

Esteban offers a monetary reward for anyone who can reveal Pedro&#x27;s whereabouts to him. Esteban García, unrecognized by his father, aids in helping to find Pedro. Pedro is able to escape from Esteban, who declines to give a reward to his son. Esteban later learns Blanca is pregnant with Pedro&#x27;s child, and he goes to her house to falsely tell her that he murdered Pedro. Clara makes Esteban leave and reassures Blanca that Pedro is indeed alive, but they won&#x27;t be reunited for some time because he needs to flee to safety. Years later, Esteban goes to Clara and apologizes for his actions. Though she maintains some distance from him, she does allow him to meet their seven-year-old granddaughter Alba and to be a part of her and Blanca’s lives again.

=== 1973 ===
Esteban is now a senator in the Conservative Party, while Pedro is a leader with the People&#x27;s Front. Despite Esteban’s success, he is lonely and finds comfort in the arms of Tránsito, who now runs a high-class prostitution establishment. Esteban believes his party will win the election as usual, but the People’s Front ends up gaining control of the government. Clara passes away after gently explaining to Alba that she has always been in touch with spirits on the other side and will be in contact with the rest of the family.

A conspiracy between Conservative Party members and the military leads to a coup d&#x27;état, 11 de Septiembre, and the military seizes control of the country. Under military control, people associated with the People&#x27;s Party are captured and even killed. The police come and arrest Blanca for her association with Pedro Tercero. Before Blanca is taken away, she tells Esteban that Pedro is the love of her life, just as Clara was his. She appeals to Esteban to use his political influence to help find asylum for Pedro outside Chile so the three of them can be a family. In the coming days, Blanca is tortured and sexually abused by her half-brother, Esteban García, who had joined the military with his father&#x27;s help.

Esteban decides to honor his daughter&#x27;s wishes and helps to find exile for Pedro in Canada. He also turns to Tránsito, who as an influential madam has connections to high-level military figures, to help free Blanca. One morning, a beaten Blanca finally arrives back at her home. A grateful Esteban tells her that Pedro is waiting for her and Alba in Canada, and hopes his help can make up for the damage his actions wrought on his family.

=== Epilogue ===
Blanca and the elderly Esteban return to Tres Marías with Alba. Esteban is finally visited by Clara&#x27;s spirit, who has come to help the old man on to the next world. Blanca sits outside and ponders her life, looking forward to a future with Pedro and their daughter. She reflects on how she does not want to live her life with anger or hatred—instead, she wishes to move forward and be happy.

== Cast ==
== Production ==

=== Development ===
Author Isabel Allende received numerous offers from producers and agents to adapt her novel &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; upon publication in 1982, but did not agree to option the work until Danish filmmaker Bille August convinced her with his vision for the film. In January 1993, Miramax acquired North American distribution rights for the film.

=== Casting ===
Controversy occurred over the casting of predominantly white English-speaking actors in a Latin American period film. Producer Bernd Eichinger defended the decision on the basis that the film needed internationally recognized actors. The film’s premiere in the U.S. was met with protests from Latino actors over the casting issue.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography took place in Denmark, with some scenes filmed in Lisbon and Alentejo, Portugal, from January 1993 to April.

== Release ==
The film premiered in Germany in October 1993 as a 145-minute theatrical cut that was also released in Switzerland, The Netherlands, and Scandinavia. The film was released in the United States on April 1, 1994 in a 132-minute cut version.

== Reception ==
The film has a 31% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 39 reviews. The website’s consensus states: &quot;An enviable collection of sterling actors are all woefully miscast in &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot;, a plodding saga of magical realism that lacks much magic or realism.&quot; Two oft-cited reasons for the poor critical reception were its diffusely episodic structure and the casting of mostly Anglo actors in Latin American roles.

The film grossed $4.8 million in its first two weeks of release in Germany and went on to gross more than $55 million in Europe. In the United States and Canada, it grossed $6 million.

Angle Errigo of &quot;Empire&quot; gave &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; two out of five stars and stated that: &quot;If this had been a Latin American production, one might have been more generous towards the fumblings of a fairly fetching saga; given the talents involved, the film&#x27;s hesitations in style and consistent failure to really move must be counted as a major disappointment.&quot;

=== Awards and nominations ===
The film won multiple awards: Bavarian Film Awards, German Film Awards, the Golden Screen (Germany), Havana Film Festival, and Robert Awards (Denmark), the German Phono Academy, and the Guild of German Art House Cinemas.

<text>The Kawartha Lakes (/kə&#x27;wɔrθɐ/) are a chain of lakes in south-central Ontario, Canada that form the upper watershed of the Trent River. The lakes are located on the boundary between the Paleozoic limestone regions of the Golden Horseshoe, and the Precambrian granite Canadian Shield of northern and central Ontario.

&quot;Kawartha&quot; is an anglicization of the word &quot;Ka-wa-tha&quot; (from &quot;Ka-wa-tae-gum-maug&quot; or &quot;Gaa-waategamaag&quot;), a word coined in 1895 by Anishinaabekwe Martha Whetung of the Curve Lake First Nations. It was hoped that the word, which meant &quot;land of reflections&quot; in the Anishinaabe language, would provide a convenient and popular advertising label for the area, much as &quot;Muskoka&quot; had come to describe the area and lakes north of Gravenhurst. The word was subsequently changed by tourism promoters to &quot;Kawartha&quot;, with the meaning &quot;bright waters and happy lands.&quot;

Though the city of Kawartha Lakes is named for them, more than half of the Kawartha Lakes are in fact located in Peterborough County. The Trent-Severn Waterway makes its way through many lakes in the main chain; many cottages dot the lakes&#x27; shorelines some of which are quite large in size, and the region is most known for its recreational tourism.

==Primary chain==

Lakes considered to be among &#x27;The Kawarthas&#x27; include (letters in parentheses refer to the satellite image):

* Lakes on the Talbot River:
** Canal Lake (A)
** Mitchell Lake (B)
* Lakes on the Trent River:
** Balsam Lake (C)
** Four Mile Lake (D)
** Cameron Lake (E)
** Sturgeon Lake (F)
** Pigeon Lake (G)
** Shadow Lake
** Silver Lake
** Talbot Lake
* Some additional lakes:
** Buckhorn Lake (H)
** Lake Chemong (J)
** Lower Buckhorn Lake (K)
** Lovesick Lake (Between K &amp; L)
** Stony Lake (L)
** Clear Lake (M)
** Katchewanooka Lake (N)
** Lake Scugog (S) is to the southwest of the main chain.
Some additional lakes are sometimes included:
* Lake Dalrymple
* Head Lake
* Fishog Lake
* White/Dummer Lake
* Jack Lake (P)
* Kasshabog Lake (Q)
* Rice Lake (R)

==Kawartha Highlands==
A system of interconnected lakes lies to the north of the main chain. Due to an artificial dam placed at the south end of Mississauga lake in the mid-20th century, these lakes have equal levels and are inter-navigable. They consist of Catchacoma Lake, Beaver Lake, Mississauga Lake, Gold Lake, McGinnis Lake, Cold Lake, and Cavendish Lake.

Also nearby, but not reachable by boat without portage, are Gull Lake, Anstruther Lake, Bottle Lake, and Sucker Lake. The area is partially enclosed by Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park.

== Language demographics ==
1% of residents are francophones and 5% are fluent in French.

<doc id="1020746" wikidata="Q257065" url="?curid=1020746" title="Nancy Marchand">
<text>Nancy Lou Marchand (June 19, 1928 – June 18, 2000) was an American actress. She began her career in theater in 1951. She was most famous for her television portrayals of Margaret Pynchon on &quot;Lou Grant&quot; – for which she won four Emmy Awards – and Livia Soprano on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, for which she won a Golden Globe Award.

==Early life==
Marchand was born in 1928 in Buffalo, New York, the only child of Dr. Raymond Louis Marchand, a dentist, and his wife, Marjorie Freeman, a piano teacher. Her great-grandfather Louis Marchand, a stone cutter, emigrated from France. She grew up in the adjacent hamlet of Eggertsville, New York. She attended Amherst High School, and studied acting at the Studio Theatre School in Buffalo, taking two buses to make the trip. She graduated from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1949 and studied theater at the Herbert Berghof Studio in New York City.

==Career==
Marchand made her first professional stage appearance in 1946 in &quot;The Late George Apley&quot; in Ogunquit, Maine. She made her Broadway debut in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; in 1951. She won a Distinguished Performance Obie Award for &quot;The Balcony&quot;, and she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play for &quot;The White Liars&quot; &amp; &quot;Black Comedy&quot;. She was nominated four times for the Drama Desk Award, winning for &quot;Morning&#x27;s at Seven&quot;. She won a second Obie for her performance in A. R. Gurney&#x27;s &quot;The Cocktail Hour&quot;.

Marchand originated the roles of Vinnie Phillips on the CBS soap opera &quot;Love of Life&quot; and Theresa Lamonte on the NBC soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. She also starred as matriarch Edith Cushing on &quot;Lovers and Friends&quot;, a short-lived soap opera.

Marchand was renowned for her roles as patrician newspaper publisher Margaret Pynchon on &quot;Lou Grant&quot;, winning four Emmy Awards as Best Supporting Actress in a Dramatic Series, and as matriarch Livia Soprano, mother of Tony Soprano on the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, which earned her a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series, as well as two Emmy Award nominations.

She appeared in many anthology series in the early days of television, including &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot; (on which she starred in &quot;Marty&quot; opposite Rod Steiger), &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;. Additional television credits include &quot;The Law and Mr. Jones&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Coach&quot;, and &quot;Night Court&quot;.

Marchand&#x27;s feature film credits included &quot;The Bachelor Party&quot;, &quot;Ladybug Ladybug&quot;, &quot;Me, Natalie&quot;, &quot;Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon&quot;, &quot;The Hospital&quot;, &quot;The Bostonians&quot;, &quot;From the Hip&quot;, &quot;Jefferson in Paris&quot;, &quot;Brain Donors&quot;, &quot;Reckless&quot;, &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;, &quot;Sabrina&quot; and &quot;Dear God&quot;.

==Personal life==
Marchand was married to actor Paul Sparer. He died in 1999 from cancer at age 75. The couple had three children: Katie, David, and Rachel and seven grandchildren. 

Marchand suffered from lung cancer, emphysema, and COPD. She died on June 18, 2000, a day before her 72nd birthday, in Stratford, Connecticut. She was posthumously inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. Marchand&#x27;s death occurred between Seasons 2 and 3 of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, before a plot line prominently involving her character was resolved. Her death was written into the plot, and one final scene was created for her using computer-generated imagery, which was a new technology at the time, together with outtakes from previous seasons.

<text>The Acme Aircraft Corporation was an American aircraft manufacturer based in Rockford, Illinois, founded in 1928.

The company president was R.S. Link and the general manager was P.H. Ryan.

==Products==
The company was established to produce biplane sport aircraft in the range. The company built one Acme Biplane and also produced the parasol wing Acme Sportsman. The Sportsman was designed by Edward A. Stalker, the head of the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Michigan. Only two of that model were completed before the company went out of business by 1931, in the Great Depression.

<doc id="1020752" wikidata="Q6476880" url="?curid=1020752" title="Lake Merced">
<text>Lake Merced () is a freshwater lake in the southwest corner of San Francisco, in the U.S. state of California. It is surrounded by three golf courses (the private Olympic Club and San Francisco Golf Club, and the public TPC Harding Park), as well as residential areas, Lowell High School, San Francisco State University, Lakeshore Alternative Elementary School, Stonestown Galleria, Fort Funston and the Pacific Ocean. The San Francisco Police Department shooting range, as well as a now closed skeet shooting club and the city&#x27;s National Guard armory are also in the area. The lake was also the home of the Lake Merced Sailing Club, now closed, which provided training and racing for local sailors. Currently there is a paddling program operated by San Francisco State University . The lake is home of the Pacific Rowing Club and St. Ignatius College Prep Rowing Team, both competitive rowing programs for San Francisco high school students.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for Lake Merced based on levels of mercury found in fish caught from this water body.

==History==

Lake Merced was originally christened Laguna de Nuestra Señora de la Merced by Captain Don Bruno de Heceta in 1775. Father Pedro Font, while on the de Anza Expedition to found the Presidio of San Francisco in March, 1776 wrote in his diary, &quot;we saw a grove of live oaks near which is the Laguna de la Merced, where Captain Ribera stopped; and here we saw many bears (California Grizzly Bear)...&quot;

At approximately 11pm of November 22, 1852, a shock was reported to have occurred by those in the areas around the Lake and the following day reports were made that &quot;...a fissure half a mile wide and three hundred yards long was discovered, through which the waters of Lake Merced were flowing to the sea.&quot; The most probable cause of the shock was attributed to heavy rains forcing a passage through the sandbank at the north-west. The Lake is reported to have lost of water. A map from 1881 shows that the Lake still had a passage to sea, 29 years later.

Once owned by Francisco De Haro, first Alcalde of Yerba Buena, as part of the Galindo ranch, the Spring Valley Water Company bought the water rights for the Lake in 1868, and the surrounding watershed in successive years. By purchasing all local supply, the company created a monopoly on San Francisco&#x27;s water. It was not until 1908, when the city approved construction of O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam creating the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, that the city gained municipal control. Prior to the construction of the dam, Lake Merced was to serve as the city&#x27;s main reservoir, with plans to expand the lake into land that is now the San Francisco State University campus. Around this time, Spring Valley sold off some of its land on Lake Merced, making way for the golf courses that exist today. In 1940, Metropolitan Life bought the last of Spring Valley&#x27;s land to build the Parkmerced apartment complex.

==Ecology==

The lake is fed by an underground spring, and at one time it did have an outlet to the ocean as shown on an 1869 United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Map. The salt level was always fluctuating, and therefore some species of fish which inhabit the lake are salt and freshwater adapted. There is active recreational fishing at the lake.
The lake&#x27;s water level had been shrinking for decades, endangering the historic role of Lake Merced to support a healthy ecosystem. Due to better management of the aquifer and occasional additions of water, lake level has been rising since 1990. The only natural freshwater lakes in San Francisco are Pine Lake, Lake Merced, and Mountain Lake.

==Famous duel==

On September 13, 1859, Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court David S. Terry killed United States Senator David C. Broderick in a duel at the lake.

<doc id="1020771" wikidata="Q735074" url="?curid=1020771" title="Taylor Twellman">
<text>Taylor Timothy Twellman (born February 29, 1980) is an American former soccer player who played professionally from 1999 to 2010. He now works in the media as a soccer television commentator for MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.

Twellman is best known for his play with the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer (MLS) from 2002 to 2009, during which time he scored more goals in MLS than any other player. He was the youngest player to score 100 goals in MLS in 2009 at the age of 29, and is New England&#x27;s all-time leading goal scorer. Twellman was a five-time MLS all-star and in 2005 was the league MVP. Twellman also earned 30 caps for the United States national team, scoring 6 international goals.

Twellman has been active since his retirement in promoting awareness of concussions and working in the media as a color commentator for ESPN/ABC until 2023 and for Apple TV since 2023.

==Youth and college==
Taylor was raised in St. Louis, Missouri, and attended Saint Louis University High School (SLUH), where he was an all-star athlete in American football, basketball, soccer, and baseball, during which he was offered a contract by the Kansas City Royals baseball team. After graduating from SLUH in 1998, Twellman rejected the offer, electing to play soccer at Maryland on an athletic scholarship. At Maryland, Twellman played soccer in 1998 and 1999; in 1998 Twellman was named a second-team All American for the squad, and in his sophomore 1999 season he finished as a runner-up for both the Hermann Trophy and the MAC Player of the Year Award. After only two seasons with the Terrapins, Twellman left college to turn professional.

==Professional career==
In 2000, Twellman signed with German Bundesliga club 1860 Munich. He spent two years with the team, but played for the reserve team in Division III, and never played above the reserve level.

Twellman returned to the U.S. when he was drafted second overall by the New England Revolution in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. In Twellman&#x27;s first season in MLS, he established himself as one of the best players in the league, scoring 23 goals. On May 11, 2002, Twellman scored the first (and second) ever goals at Gillette Stadium in MLS league play, in the Revolution&#x27;s 2-0 win over the Dallas Burn. He finished second in league MVP voting, and was named to the 2002 MLS Best XI. In the 2003 season, despite being beset by a number of injuries, Twellman finished tied with Carlos Ruiz of the L.A. Galaxy for top goalscorer of the league with 15. His production went down in 2004, as he ended up with just nine goals.

Twellman&#x27;s best MLS season came in 2005, winning both the Major League Soccer MVP Award and MLS Golden Boot, and finishing the regular season with 17 goals. He was also named to the 2005 MLS Best XI.
Twellman was the target of transfer talk when Odd Grenland of Norway reportedly made a $1.2 million bid for him, which MLS rejected. In February 2007, New England announced they had signed Twellman to a four-year contract, reportedly worth $5 million.

In 2007, Twellman won his first title with the Revolution: the US Open Cup, a season in which he finished third in MLS in goals scored. The Revolution also won the Eastern Conference title, with Twellman scoring a spectacular bicycle kick against the Chicago Fire to secure the Revs&#x27; spot in the 2007 MLS Cup. Twellman scored the opening goal of the 2007 MLS Cup against Houston Dynamo. However, this would be New England&#x27;s only goal as they would go on to lose their third straight MLS Cup by a score of 2–1.

In January 2008, English Championship team Preston North End attempted to entice Major League Soccer and the New England Revolution to sell Twellman. Preston initially advanced an offer of $1.7 million, but MLS and the team rejected that offer, rejected another offer of $2.5 million, and then rejected another bid for $3 to $3.5 million, which would have been the fourth highest and possibly the second highest transfer fee in MLS history to date.

===Injuries and retirement===
Twellman suffered a neck injury and a serious concussion from a mid-air collision against Los Angeles Galaxy goalkeeper Steve Cronin on August 30, 2008. Twellman played the rest of the 2008 season, but due to lingering symptoms from his whiplash and concussion, he played only two games in 2009. Twellman had planned to make his return during the 2010 season, but he was unable to play that season and was placed on the season-ending injury list. After struggling to find any playing time over the past three seasons in MLS due to his head injury, Twellman announced his retirement from the game at the end of the 2010 MLS season.

==International career==
Twellman began his involvement with the U.S. national program at youth level with the U-17 and U-20 squads. He first gained professional attention after scoring four goals for the U-20 national team at the 1999 World Youth Championship while still playing with the University of Maryland. He also represented the United States at the 1999 Pan American Games.

After establishing himself in MLS, Twellman made his first appearance with the senior U.S. national team on November 17, 2002, against El Salvador. He struggled to score his first international goal, having several apparent goals waved off for offside infractions. He finally scored against Panama in a World Cup qualifier on October 12, 2005. He improved his chances for a spot on the 2006 World Cup team in a friendly against Norway on January 29, 2006. In the game, he scored the ninth hat trick in U.S. national team history, but was ultimately left off the World Cup roster by coach Bruce Arena.

Twellman was selected by new U.S. coach Bob Bradley as a member of the U.S. squad for the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup, scoring in a group stage win over El Salvador. Twellman gradually fell out of the national team pool in the following years after a series of concussions sidelined his club career.

==Post-retirement==

Since retirement, Twellman has created the THINKTaylor foundation, a charitable organization regarding sports-related concussions.
Twellman has agreed to donate his brain to science after death. His brain could be of use to determine whether multiple concussions cause permanent harm to the brain.

Twellman Soccer provides programs and tools for players, coaches and organizations across the United States.

==Media career==

Twellman has had an active media career after retiring as a player. He joined ESPN/ABC from November 2011 until January 2023 as a soccer analyst, serving as lead color commentator for their Major League Soccer coverage alongside lead play-by-play commentator Adrian Healey and later Jon Champion. He also hosted a weekly recap show about the league, &quot;MLS Rewind&quot;, on ESPN+. Twellman called the 2012, 2016, and 2020 European Championships, and in 2014 Twellman was the USMNT lead color commentator in the World Cup in Brazil. He left the network in January 2023 to join Apple&#x27;s MLS coverage.

==Personal life==
Taylor&#x27;s father Tim Twellman, and uncles Mike Twellman and Steve Twellman, all played professionally in the North American Soccer League. Taylor&#x27;s brother James Twellman played with the San Jose Earthquakes reserves in 2002. Taylor&#x27;s grandfather, Jim Delsing, was a Major League Baseball outfielder in the 1950s for five teams. His uncle is golfer Jay Delsing.

<doc id="1020773" wikidata="Q655296" url="?curid=1020773" title="Tarzan of the Apes">
<text>Tarzan of the Apes is a 1912 novel by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the first in the Tarzan series. The story was first printed in the pulp magazine &quot;The All-Story&quot; in October 1912 before being released as a novel in June 1914. 

The story follows the title character Tarzan&#x27;s adventures, from his childhood being raised by apes in the jungle to his eventual encounters with other humans and Western society. So popular was the character that Burroughs continued the series into the 1940s with two dozen sequels. 

Scholars have noted several important themes in the novel: the impact of heredity on behavior; racial superiority; civilization, especially as Tarzan struggles with his identity as a human; sexuality; and escapism.

In April 2012, in advance of the novel&#x27;s centennial anniversary, the Library of America published a hardcover edition based on Burroughs&#x27; original novel, with an introduction by Thomas Mallon.().

==Plot summary==
John and Alice (Rutherford) Clayton, Viscount and Lady Greystoke from England, are marooned in the western coastal jungles of equatorial Africa in 1888. Some time later, their son John Clayton II is born. When he is one year old his mother dies, and soon thereafter his father is killed by the savage king ape Kerchak. The infant is then adopted by the she-ape widow Kala, who lost her previous son after dropping it from a treetop while being chased by Kerchak.

Clayton is named &quot;Tarzan&quot; (&quot;White Skin&quot; in the ape language) and raised in ignorance of his human heritage.

As a boy, feeling alienated from his peers due to their physical differences, he discovers his true parents&#x27; cabin, where he first learns of others like himself in their books. Using basic primers with pictures, over many years he teaches himself to read English, but having &quot;never heard it, cannot speak it.&quot;

Upon his return from one visit to the cabin, he is attacked by a huge gorilla which he manages to kill with his father&#x27;s knife, although he is terribly wounded in the struggle. As he grows up, Tarzan becomes a skilled hunter, exciting the jealousy of Kerchak, the ape leader, who finally attacks him. Tarzan kills Kerchak and takes his place as &quot;king&quot; of the apes.

Later, a tribe of black Africans settle in the area, and Tarzan&#x27;s adopted mother, Kala, is killed by one of its hunters. Avenging himself on the killer, Tarzan begins an antagonistic relationship with the tribe, raiding its village for weapons and practicing cruel pranks on them. They, in turn, regard him as an evil spirit and attempt to placate him.

A few years later when Tarzan is 21 years of age, a new party is marooned on the coast, including 19 year old Jane Porter, the first white woman Tarzan has ever seen. Tarzan&#x27;s cousin, William Cecil Clayton, unwitting usurper of the ape man&#x27;s ancestral English estate, is also among the party. Tarzan spies on the newcomers, aids them in secret, and saves Jane from the perils of the jungle.

Among the party is French naval officer Paul D&#x27;Arnot. While Tarzan is rescuing D&#x27;Arnot from the natives, a rescue ship recovers the castaways. D&#x27;Arnot teaches Tarzan to speak French and offers to take Tarzan to the land of white men where he might connect with Jane again. On their journey, D&#x27;Arnot teaches him how to behave among white men. In the ensuing months, Tarzan eventually learns to speak English, as well.

Ultimately, Tarzan travels to find Jane in Wisconsin, USA where he rescues her from a fire. Tarzan learns the bitter news that she has become engaged to William Clayton. Meanwhile, clues from his parents&#x27; cabin have enabled D&#x27;Arnot to prove Tarzan&#x27;s true identity as John Clayton II, the Earl of Greystoke. Instead of reclaiming his inheritance from William, Tarzan chooses rather to conceal and renounce his heritage for the sake of Jane&#x27;s happiness.

== Background ==
Burroughs drifted across the United States until he was thirty-six, holding seventeen consecutive careers before he published stories. He worked as a U.S. cavalryman, a gold miner in Oregon, a cowboy in Idaho, a railroad policeman in Salt Lake City, and an owner of several failed businesses. He decided to write his own pulp fiction after being disappointed by the reading material others offered, and worked in that capacity for four years before his first novel, &quot;Tarzan of the Apes,&quot; was published. Tarzan first appeared in &quot;The All-Story&quot; in October 1912. &quot;The All-Story&quot; published it in its entirety in installments, and it was published in 1914 as a novel.

Though &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; is sometimes cited as an influence on Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot;, he claimed that his only inspiration was the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus. Rudyard Kipling commented that Burroughs &quot;had &#x27;jazzed&#x27; the motif of the Jungle Books and, I imagine, thoroughly enjoyed himself.&quot;

== Major themes ==
Recent literary criticism often focuses on the identity of the eponymous protagonist of &quot;Tarzan of the Apes.&quot; Literary scholars, such as Jeff Berglund, Mikko Tuhkanen, J. Michelle Coughlan, Bijana Oklopčić, and Catherine Jurca have examined the overlapping themes of Tarzan&#x27;s heredity, race, civilized behavior, sexuality, and escapist appeal. Writers in popular culture, such as Gore Vidal, often emphasize Tarzan&#x27;s escapist appeal.

=== Heredity ===
Burroughs himself acknowledged the centrality of the theme of heredity in the novel, and its conflict with the environment. According to his biographer, John Taliaferro, he claimed in a &quot;Writer’s Digest,&quot; &quot;I was mainly interested in playing with the idea of a contest between heredity and environment. For this purpose I selected an infant child of a race strongly marked by hereditary characteristics of the finer and nobler sort, and at an age at which he could not have been influenced by association with creatures of his own kind I threw him into an environment as diametrically opposite that to which he had been born as I might well conceive&quot;.

The scholar Jeff Burglund notices that although Tarzan was brought up in the jungle far from other humans, he is inexplicably drawn back to his parents’ cabin and the objects which he finds there. He discovers a capacity for gentlemanly behavior around Jane despite no one teaching it to him. Although the African tribes which he fights practice cannibalism, he suddenly feels revulsion when he considers eating one of the African men he kills. When he refuses to eat the African, Burroughs portrays &quot;hereditary instinct&quot; as the reason. Tarzan&#x27;s genetic association with upper-class, Western civilization conditions his actions more than his violent environment, and Berglund claims that Tarzan could represent the stereotypical &quot;scion of English stock&quot; in colonialized countries. His racial superiority manifests itself through his behavior because it correlates with the ideals of Western civilization, whether he treats a woman politely or cannot force himself to eat an African man.

=== Racism ===
Biljana Oklopčić emphasizes the portrayal of race in &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot;. She claims that Tarzan represents white, male opposition to the &quot;black rapist&quot; stereotype which was prevalent in the Southern U.S. at the time of its publication because the language which describes apes parallels propaganda against people of Sub-Saharan African descent.

Catherine Jurca similarly analyzes Tarzan as opposed to tolerating the presence of people of other races and classes in favor of preserving his own culture. The way that Tarzan defends his corner of civilization, his parents’ home, from the &quot;savages&quot; who want to destroy it, reflects an early twentieth-century American attitude; as darker-skinned immigrants flooded the country, especially urban areas, white Americans feared that their culture would be destroyed by newcomers who did not understand or care about it, and tried to protect the suburbs in the same way that Tarzan tries to protect his home.

Though Burroughs&#x27; admirers have tried to downplay claims of racism, or to explain that it was a common stereotype at the time the book was written, John Newsinger examines the extent to which Burroughs unfavorably described black characters. He wrote that &quot;Tarzan&quot; is the story of the &quot;whiteman&#x27;s conquest of black savagery&quot;, where the native Sub-Saharan Africans are portrayed as brutes whom Tarzan enjoys taunting and killing.

=== Civilization ===
Tarzan&#x27;s jungle upbringing and eventual exposure to Western civilization form another common theme in literary criticism of the novel. Berglund notes that Tarzan&#x27;s ability to read and write sets him apart from the apes, the African villagers, and the lower-class sailors in the novel, and culminates in Tarzan recognizing himself as a human for the first time; moreover, he sees himself as a man who is superior to others unlike himself. Jeff Berglund argues that this realization exemplifies Burroughs&#x27; portrayal of whiteness and literacy as fundamental to civilization through implying that Tarzan&#x27;s growth into a perfectly civilized person stems from his Western, white heritage and ability to read and write.

However, Mikko Tuhkanen claims that the apparently civilized qualities of Tarzan, such as his interest in reading, threaten his survival as a human in the jungle. For Tuhkanen, Tarzan represents the fluidity with which humans should define themselves. He asserts, &quot;[T]he human and the nonhuman become grotesquely indistinguishable&quot; in the novel. Humans mistake apes for other humans, an ape tries to rape Jane, Tarzan finds a surrogate ape mother when he cries out like an ape, and he must act against his human instincts by jumping into a dangerous body of water in order to survive an attack from a lion. Because simian and human behavior blend, and because civilized habits seem to threaten human survival, Tuhkanen claims that humans must contradict the expectations of civilization regarding the characteristics of humans. For Tuhkanen, the novel exemplifies “queer ethics,” encouraging “perverse sexuality” along with other behaviors which Western civilization often discouraged.

=== Escapism ===
Most of the stories that Burroughs wrote were stories that he told himself. According to Gore Vidal, when Burroughs was unsatisfied with reality, &quot;he consoled himself with an inner world where he was strong and handsome, adored by beautiful women and worshipped by exotic races.&quot; The story served for the most part as a form of masculine escape that inspired men and boys. The adventurous character of Tarzan also appealed to wider American audiences over decades as a powerful means of escaping the sense of boredom and frustration which accompanies a confining society, and to the twentieth-century American desire to reconquer a home that seemed lost. &quot;In the eyes of contemporary man, huddled in large cities and frustrated by a restrictive civilization, Tarzan was a joyous symbol of primitivism, an affirmation of life, endowing the reader with a Promethean sense of power.&quot;

== Adaptations ==

===Film adaptations===
Burroughs&#x27; novel has been the basis of several films. The first two were the silent films &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot; (1918) and &quot;The Romance of Tarzan&quot; (1918), both starring Elmo Lincoln as Tarzan, based on the first and second parts of the novel, respectively. The next and most famous adaptation was &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot; (1932), starring Johnny Weissmuller, who went on to star in 11 other Tarzan films. Lincoln was replaced by Weissmuller (as actor); similarly Clayton was replaced by Harry Holt (the character in the films). It was remade twice, as &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot; (1959), featuring Denny Miller, and &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot; (1981), with Miles O&#x27;Keeffe as Tarzan and Bo Derek as Jane.

The 1935 12-part serial, &quot;The New Adventures of Tarzan&quot;, starred Herman Brix (later, &quot;Bruce Bennett&quot;). This was produced contemporaneously with the Weissmuller versions.

Four more movie adaptations have been made to date: &quot;&quot; (1984), a film starring Christopher Lambert that is more faithful to the book; &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot; (1999), a direct-to-video animated film; &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999), a Disney animated film with Tony Goldwyn as the voice of Tarzan; and &quot;The Legend of Tarzan&quot; (2016), a more historically contextualized update starring Alexander Skarsgård and Margot Robbie, as well as Christoph Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson, portraying actual figures in the Congo at that time, the brutal Belgian Captain Léon Rom and American Civil War soldier George Washington Williams, respectively.

A number of Burroughs&#x27; other Tarzan novels have also been adapted for the screen. Numerous Tarzan films have been made with no connection to his writings other than the character.

===Comic adaptations===
The book has been adapted into comic form on a number of occasions, both in the original Tarzan comic strip and comic books. The strip itself began with Hal Foster&#x27;s adaptation of the story. Notable adaptations into comic book form include those of Gold Key Comics in &quot;Tarzan&quot; no. 155 (script by Gaylord DuBois, art by Russ Manning), dated September 1966 (reprinted in no. 178, dated October 1969), DC Comics in &quot;Tarzan&quot; nos. 207-210, dated April–July 1972 (script and art by Joe Kubert), and Marvel in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; no. 29, dated 1983 (reprinted in &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot; nos. 1-2, dated July–August 1984). Probably the most prestigious comic version, however, was illustrator and former &quot;Tarzan&quot; comic strip artist Burne Hogarth&#x27;s 1972 adaptation of the first half of the book into his showcase graphic novel &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot;. (Hogarth subsequently followed up with another graphic novel &quot;Jungle Tales of Tarzan&quot; (1976), which adapted four stories from Burroughs&#x27; identically titled collection of Tarzan stories). Dynamite Entertainment adapted the story for the first six issues of &quot;Lord of the Jungle&quot;, albeit loosely; for example, the cannibal tribe was replaced by a village of literal apemen.

===Radio adaptations===

Three old-time radio series were based on the Tarzan character. Burroughs himself revised each script in the 1932-1934 series as needed for accuracy. That series had Burroughs&#x27; daughter, Joan, in the role of Jane.

<doc id="1020775" wikidata="Q3282456" url="?curid=1020775" title="Istanbul (Not Constantinople)">
<text>&quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot; is a 1953 novelty song, with lyrics by Jimmy Kennedy and music by Nat Simon. It was written on the 500th anniversary of the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans. The lyrics humorously refer to the official renaming of the city of Constantinople to Istanbul. The song&#x27;s original release, performed by The Four Lads, was certified as a gold record. Numerous cover versions have been recorded over the years, most famously a 1990 version by They Might Be Giants.

==Musical influences==
Jazz historian Will Friedwald mentioned that the song is an answer to &quot;C-O-N-S-T-A-N-T-I-N-O-P-L-E&quot;, written by Harry Carlton and recorded in 1928 by Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra.

==The Four Lads original version==
&quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot; was originally recorded by the Canadian vocal quartet The Four Lads on August 12, 1953. This recording was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 40082. It first reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine charts on October 24, 1953, and it peaked at #10. It was the group&#x27;s first gold record.

==Cover versions==

===Frankie Vaughan===

Frankie Vaughan&#x27;s 1954 version for HMV reached the UK charts that year with a peak position of No. 11.

===Col Joye&#x27;s Joy Boys===

Col Joye&#x27;s backing band recorded an instrumental version on the Festival Records label, which peaked No. 16 in November 1960 according to the back-then Australian charts, ending up as No. 95 for the 1961 year-end ranking.

===Bing Crosby===

Bing Crosby began performing a version on his weekly radio show, &quot;The Bing Crosby Show for General Electric&quot;. It was first broadcast as a duet with Ella Fitzgerald at the end of 1953, and later with Connie Russell in early 1954. It featured John Scott Trotter&#x27;s Orchestra and trumpet soloist Ziggy Elman.

===Big Muffin Serious Band===

Big Muffin Serious Band, a ukulele-based music performance group from New Zealand, released a cover on their LP &quot;Jabberwocky Goes To Town&quot; in 1987.

===They Might Be Giants===

One of the best-known versions of &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot; is the cover by the alternative rock band They Might Be Giants (TMBG), who released it on their album &quot;Flood&quot; in 1990. It was released as the second single from that album in the same year. TMBG&#x27;s version is at a faster tempo than the original. The music video was featured in the first season of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Liquid Television&quot;. TMBG&#x27;s version of the song is prominently featured in the &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; episode &quot;Tiny Toon Music Television&quot;, as the soundtrack to a segment featuring Plucky Duck as a private detective hired to find a missing statue. It was also used as the theme in the 1992 thriller &quot;Black Magic&quot; starring Judge Reinhold. It later appeared in the first season of the Netflix series &quot;The Umbrella Academy&quot;, as well as an ending to an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Mobile Homer&quot;. The single reached number 61 on the UK Singles Chart in 1990. TMBG later recorded an electronic version of the song for their 2011 compilation album, &quot;Album Raises New and Troubling Questions&quot;.

===The Sacados===
A Spanish language version called &quot;Estambul&quot; was recorded by Argentine synth-pop trio The Sacados in 1990. The song was included on their debut album &quot;Te pido + respeto&quot; (1990).

===The Trevor Horn Orchestra===
An orchestra version was recorded for the 2003 film &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot;, starring Julia Roberts. It used as background music.

=== Bart &amp; Baker ===
Electro swing duo Bart &amp; Baker covered the song for their album &quot;The Jet Lag EP&quot; (2012). Another version called &quot;Istanbul 2016&quot; was included on their curation album &quot;Best Of Electro Swing By Bart &amp; Baker&quot; (2016).

=== Bette Midler ===
Bette Midler performed the song as part of her 1976 special for Home Box Office, &quot;Live at Last.&quot; It appears on the album of the same name.

=== PJ Harvey ===
PJ Harvey used a loop of the song as inspiration for the title track of her album Let England Shake. Her release &quot;Let England Shake – Demos&quot; revealed that The Four Lads original recording was used as a constant sound bed under &quot;Let England Shake&quot; with PJ Harvey singing lyrics from the song at the end of demo.

=== Muppets ===
In Season 2, Episode 4 (U.S. release October 12, 1997) of the television series &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, portions of the song were performed by a quartet of rats in kaftans and fezzes.

===Live performance cover versions===
The Doox of Yale, an a cappella group at Yale University, perform the song at the end of most of their concerts. The song has been in the repertoire of the group since 1953 (when they were known as &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Men&quot;).

During the 2000s, the song was performed live by Australian Klezmer/Gypsy Jazz band Monsieur Camembert, appearing on the album &quot;Live on Stage&quot;.

Guitarist Trey Anastasio has teased the song on numerous occasions with Phish and with his own band, Trey Anastasio Band.

<doc id="1020776" wikidata="Q6894292" url="?curid=1020776" title="Mohonk Preserve">
<text>The Mohonk Preserve is a nature preserve in the Shawangunk Ridge, north of New York City in Ulster County, New York. The preserve has over of cliffs, forests, fields, ponds and streams, with over of carriage roads and of trails for hiking, cycling, trail running, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and horseback riding. It is also a major destination for rock climbers, hosting 50,000 climbers each year who enjoy more than 1,000 climbing routes.

==History==
The origins of the preserve date to 1869, when twin brothers Albert and Alfred Smiley purchased Lake Mohonk and established the Mohonk Mountain House. On February 26, 1963, the Smiley family, friends, neighbors and supporters formed the Mohonk Trust to protect the area&#x27;s unique natural landscape for future generations. The property of the Mohonk Trust on that day in 1963 consisted of $100, a gift from Mabel Craven Smiley. Land was acquired by the Mohonk Trust over the years, and it became the Mohonk Preserve Inc. in 1978. According to their 2017 IRS Form 990 their assets then exceeded $25 million. Through the support of members, donors and partners, the preserve has become a center for outdoor education and a conservation advocate, especially for natural lands in the Shawangunks and the Hudson Valley. Its mission includes land protection and stewardship, sponsorship of environmental education programs, which according to Preserve officials have served more than 100,000 children over a thirty-year period, and maintenance of biological, weather, and natural history records spanning more than a century.

In 1986, the Mohonk Preserve and Mohonk Mountain House together were designated a National Historic Landmark.

The name &quot;Moggonck&quot; appeared in early boundary records referring to the &quot;high hill&quot;, the crag now named Skytop where the Skytop Tower is located. The spelling change from &quot;gg&quot; to &quot;h&quot; was probably done for aesthetic reasons. The word &quot;Moggonck&quot; was possibly derived from the Lenape &quot;maxkwung&quot;, &quot;place of bears&quot;, or from the Munsee &quot;maxkawenge&quot;, &quot;hill of bears&quot;. Another possibility comes from the related Mohican language, in which &quot;Magunk&quot; is derived from &quot;Magki&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, and &quot;Unk&quot;, &quot;a standing tree&quot;.

==Description==

Headquarters of the not-for-profit Mohonk Preserve are in Gardiner, New York. Most of the land is in the town of Gardiner, but there is also land in the towns of Marbletown, Rosendale, New Paltz, and Rochester. Preserve lands extend for nearly from Rosendale to Millbrook Mountain.

More than 75% of the Preserve&#x27;s funding comes from contributions, memberships and investments. Grants from land conservation organizations, including some from the New York State Conservation Partnership Program, and funds from the state&#x27;s Environmental Protection Fund amount to 23% of income. It was the first land trust established on the northern Shawangunk Ridge.

The Preserve&#x27;s mission is to protect the Shawangunk Mountains by inspiring people to care for, enjoy, and explore the natural world. To accomplish its mission, the Preserve conducts programs in four key areas - environmental education, serving both school children and adults; land protection, saving high-priority land on the ridge; land stewardship, balancing the protection of land and wildlife with opportunities for recreation; and scientific research, creating a &quot;living laboratory&quot; on the land. The land is home to more than 1,400 plant and animal species, including the peregrine falcon, Jefferson salamander, and of rare dwarf pitch pine. Restricted deer hunting is allowed with the aim of preventing ecological damage due to overbrowsing.

There is a per-person day fee for cycling and rock climbing. Annual memberships are available. Free one-month memberships were offered to Ulster County residents in the spring and again in the fall of 2014. Hours of operation are from sunrise to one hour past sunset.

Minnewaska State Park Preserve adjoins the Mohonk Preserve lands to the south, and protects another of former property of another member of the Smiley family as a state park.

==Daniel Smiley Research Center==
The Daniel Smiley Research Center (DSRC) is the Mohonk Preserve&#x27;s conservation science unit. The DSRC archive is recognized nationally for an extensive collection of biodiversity and natural history long-term research data. The archive includes more than 86 years of natural and cultural history observations, over 120 years of daily weather data, 60,000 physical items, 9,000 photographs, and research library. Of those physical items, there are over 3,000 herbarium specimens, 139 mammal specimens, 107 bird specimens, 140 butterfly specimens, 400 arthropod specimens, and over 10,000 index cards with handwritten and/or typed natural history observations. The collections are also frequently cited in research on climate change, biodiversity, bird migration, and human impact on the environment.

<text>Trivia (1716) is a poem by John Gay. The full title of the poem is Trivia, or The Art of Walking the Streets of London, and it takes its name from the Latin word for &quot;crossroads&quot; and from the &quot;goddess of crossroads,&quot; Diana, whom the poet invokes in the opening stanza.

The poem, written in heroic couplets, is loosely based on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;, yet attains a Horatian satirical manner.

The length of the entire poem is 1288 lines, and it is in three books.

==Content==
The poem describes the perils of walking in London in the 1710s. It is a topographical poem, taking the form of a walk through a day and night. It pretends to utmost seriousness in advising the reader on:

*how to dress properly
*what sorts of boots to wear
*how to survive falling masonry
*chamber pots being emptied out of windows
*overflowing gutters
*pickpockets
*wig thieves
*mud splashes

Gay also describes the characters of the city, including its ballad singers, chairmen, footmen, and toughs.

<text>The Sigi Schmid Coach of the Year Award is given by Major League Soccer to the best coach in any given season. The award has been given since the league&#x27;s inception in 1996 and is determined by a vote from players, club personnel, and members of the media. Bruce Arena has won the award four times, more than any other coach.

The award was renamed in January 2019 for Sigi Schmid, the coach with the most league regular season wins and two-time award winner, shortly after his death.

Thomas Rongen won the inaugural award with the now defunct Tampa Bay Mutiny for the 1996 Major League Soccer season.

<doc id="1020801" wikidata="Q1063328" url="?curid=1020801" title="Wasei-eigo">
<text>are Japanese-language expressions that are based on English words, or on parts of English phrases, but do not exist in standard English, or do not have the meanings that they have in standard English. In linguistics, they are classified as pseudo-loanwords or pseudo-anglicisms.

== Definition and examples ==
&quot;Wasei-eigo&quot; words, compound words and portmanteaus are constructed by Japanese speakers on the basis of loanwords derived from English and embedded into the Japanese lexicon with refashioned, novel meanings diverging significantly from the originals. 

An example is , derived from &quot;handle&quot; with the meaning of &quot;steering wheel&quot;, with the full phrase meaning designated driver. Some &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; terms are not recognizable as English words in English-speaking countries; one example is , which refers to physical contact between close friends or loved ones and appears to be a portmanteau of &quot;skin&quot; and &quot;kinship&quot;. In other cases, a word may simply have gained a slightly different meaning; for instance, does not mean &quot;cunning&quot;, but &quot;cheating&quot; (on an academic test). Some &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; are subsequently borrowed from Japanese into other languages, including English itself.

== Confusion with &quot;gairaigo&quot; ==
&quot;Wasei-eigo&quot; is often confused with &quot;gairaigo&quot;, which refers simply to loanwords or &quot;words from abroad&quot;. Some of the main contributors to this confusion are the phonological and morphological transformations that they undergo to suit Japanese phonology and syllabary. These transformations often result in truncated (or &quot;backclipped&quot;) words and words with extra vowels inserted to accommodate the Japanese &quot;mora&quot; syllabic structure. &quot;Wasei-eigo&quot;, on the other hand, is the re-working of and experimentation with these words that results in an entirely novel meaning as compared to the original intended meaning.

== Compared to other Japanese word classes ==
&quot;Wasei-eigo&quot; is distinct from &quot;Engrish&quot;, the misuse or corruption of the English language by native Japanese speakers, as it consists of words used in Japanese conversation, not an attempt at speaking English. These include acronyms and initialisms particular to Japan (see list of Japanese Latin alphabetic abbreviations). &quot;Wasei-eigo&quot; can be compared to , which are Japanese pseudo-sinicisms (Japanese words created from Chinese roots) and are also extremely common.

== History and process ==
There was a large influx of English loanwords introduced to Japan during the Meiji period, which was an important factor in Japan&#x27;s modernization. Because they were so quickly accepted into Japanese society, there was not a thorough understanding of the actual meaning of the word, leading to misinterpretations and deviations from their original meaning.

Since English loanwords are adopted into Japan intentionally (as opposed to diffusing &quot;naturally&quot; through language contact, etc.), the meaning often deviates from the original. When these loanwords become so deeply embedded in the Japanese lexicon, it leads to experimentation and re-fashioning of the words&#x27; meaning, thus resulting in &quot;wasei-eigo&quot;.

== In the media ==
Many scholars agree that the main proponent behind these &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; terms is the media, in order to create interest and novelty in their advertising and products. The use of English words is also an attempt by advertisers to portray a modern, cosmopolitan image – one that is often associated with Western culture.

== Social connotations and main users ==
Though there is disagreement about the assumption that the majority of &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; are created by advertisers, the audience that predominantly uses &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; is youth and women. Many Japanese consider English loanword usage to be more casual and as being used mainly among peers of the same status. In addition, many &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; words are used to camouflage risqué terms and ideas, such as the famous &quot;rabuho&quot; (love hotel), or the many &quot;massaaji&quot; (massage) and &quot;saabisu&quot; (service) associated with taboo topics. Finally, &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; may be used to express a poetic and emphatic need of the speaker, resulting in a new term.

English loanwords are usually written in &quot;katakana&quot;, making it apparent that they are words non-native to Japan. This constant reminder that these are loanwords, and not natively Japanese, links the meanings of the words with the idea of &quot;foreignness&quot;. Because of this, &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; (and some English loanwords) is often used as a method for speaking about taboo and controversial topics in a safe and neutral way. Further, being non-native Japanese words and marked as foreign in their writing, they can be associated with concepts and subjects that are non-normal, or uncommon in Japan.

<doc id="1020809" wikidata="Q2656758" url="?curid=1020809" title="Executive Order 6102">
<text>Executive Order 6102 is an executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt &quot;forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States.&quot; The executive order was made under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the Emergency Banking Act in March 1933.

At the time, this policy faced criticism from those who asserted it was &quot;completely immoral&quot; and &quot;a flagrant violation of the solemn promises made in the Gold Standard Act of 1900&quot; and promises made to purchasers of Liberty and Victory Loans during World War I. The critics also claimed this Executive Order would lead to an inflation of supply of credit and currency, which would cause a fraudulent economic boom which would inevitably bust and result in a depression.

The limitation on gold ownership in the United States was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars, and certificates by an Act of Congress, codified in , which went into effect December 31, 1974.

==Rationale==
The stated reason for the order was that hard times had caused &quot;hoarding&quot; of gold, stalling economic growth and worsening the depression as the US was then using the gold standard for its currency.

On April 6, 1933, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, under the headline &quot;Hoarding of Gold&quot;, &quot;The Executive Order issued by the President yesterday amplifies and particularizes his earlier warnings against hoarding. On March 6, taking advantage of a wartime statute that had not been repealed, he issued Presidential Proclamation that forbade the hoarding &#x27;of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency&#x27;, under penalty of $10,000 fine or ten years&#x27; imprisonment or both.&quot;

The main rationale behind the order was actually to remove the constraint on the Federal Reserve preventing it from increasing the money supply during the depression. The Federal Reserve Act (1913) required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes that were issued. By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost reached the limit of allowable credit, in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes, which could be backed by the gold in its possession (see Great Depression).

==Effects==
Executive Order 6102 required all persons to deliver on or before May 1, 1933, all but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve in exchange for $20.67 () per troy ounce. Under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the recently passed Emergency Banking Act of March 9, 1933, a violation of the order was punishable by fine up to $10,000 (), up to ten years in prison, or both.

The order specifically exempted &quot;customary use in industry, profession or art&quot;, a provision that covered artists, jewelers, dentists, sign-makers, etc. The order also permitted any person to hold up to $100 in gold coins, a face value equivalent to of gold valued at approximately $10,000 in 2020. The same paragraph also exempted &quot;gold coins having recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins&quot;, which protected recognized gold coin collections from legal seizure.

The 1934 Gold Reserve Act subsequently changed the statutory gold content of the U.S. Dollar from $20.67 to $35 an ounce. While this might be seen to some as a move that increased the value of gold, it actually merely devalued the U.S. Dollar so that less gold was required to back U.S. Currency, and the Federal Reserve was free to print more paper money. All international transactions by the U.S. Treasury were afterward calculated with the new valuation for gold at $35 an ounce (). The resulting profit that the federal government realized funded the Exchange Stabilization Fund, also established by the Gold Reserve Act.

The regulations prescribed in the executive order were modified by Executive Order on April 20, 1933, both of which were ultimately revoked and superseded by Executive Orders and 6261 on August 28 and 29, 1933, respectively.

Executive Order 6102 also led to the extreme rarity of the 1933 Double Eagle gold coin. The order caused all gold coin production to cease and all 1933 minted coins to be destroyed. About 20 such coins were stolen, leading to an outstanding US Secret Service warrant for arrest and confiscation of the coins. One surviving coin, legalized long after transfer to a foreign head of state, sold for over $7.5 million in 2002, making it one of the most valuable coins in the world.

==Prosecutions==
Numerous individuals and companies were prosecuted related to Roosevelt&#x27;s Executive Order 6102. The prosecutions took place under the subsequent Executive Orders 6111, 6260, 6261 and the Gold Reserve Act of 1934.

There was a need to amend Executive Order 6102, as the one prosecution under the order was ruled invalid by Federal Judge John M. Woolsey on the grounds that the order was signed by the President, instead of the Secretary of the Treasury as required. A New York attorney named Frederick Barber Campbell had a deposit at Chase National Bank of over of gold. When Campbell attempted to withdraw the gold, Chase refused and Campbell sued Chase. A federal prosecutor indicted Campbell the following day, September 27, 1933, for failing to surrender his gold. Ultimately, the prosecution of Campbell failed but the authority of the federal government to seize gold was upheld, and Campbell&#x27;s gold was confiscated.

The case caused the Roosevelt administration to issue a new order under the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. Executive Orders , and provided for the seizure of gold and the prosecution of gold hoarders. A few months later Congress passed the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, which gave legislative permanence to Roosevelt&#x27;s orders. A new set of Treasury regulations was issued providing civil penalties of confiscation of all gold and imposition of fines equal to double the value of the gold seized.

Prosecutions of US citizens and noncitizens followed the new orders, among which were a few notable cases:

Gus Farber, a diamond and jewelry merchant from San Francisco, was prosecuted for the sale of thirteen $20 gold coins without a license. Secret Service agents discovered the sale with the help of the buyer. Farber, his father, and 12 others were arrested in four American cities after a sting operation conducted by the Secret Service. The arrests took place simultaneously in New York and three California cities: San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland. Morris Anolik was arrested in New York with $5,000 in U.S. and foreign gold coins; Dan Levin and Edward Friedman of San Jose were arrested with $15,000 in gold; Sam Nankin was arrested in Oakland; in San Francisco, nine men were arrested on charges of hoarding gold. In all, $24,000 in gold was seized by Secret Service Agents during the operation.

David Baraban and his son Jacob owned a refining company. The Barabans&#x27; license to deal in unmelted scrap gold was revoked and so the Barabans operated their refining business under a license issued to a Minnie Sarch. The Barabans admitted that Minnie Sarch had nothing to do with the business and that she had obtained the license so that the Barabans could continue to deal in gold. The Barabans had a cigar box full of gold-filled scrap jewelry visible in one of the showcases. Government agents raided the Barabans&#x27; business and found another hidden box of US and foreign gold coins. The coins were seized and Baraban was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States.

Louis Ruffino was an individual indicted on three counts purporting to violations of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, which restricted trade with countries hostile to the United States. Eventually, Ruffino appealed the conviction to the 9th District Circuit Court of Appeals in 1940; however, the judgment of the lower courts was upheld, based on the President&#x27;s executive orders and the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. Ruffino, a resident of Sutter Creek (California) in California gold country, was convicted of possessing 78 ounces of gold and was sentenced to 6 months in jail and a $500 fine, and had his gold seized.

Foreigners also had gold confiscated and were forced to accept paper money for their gold. The Uebersee Finanz-Korporation, a Swiss banking company, had $1,250,000 in gold coins for business use. The Uebersee Finanz-Korporation entrusted the gold to an American firm for safekeeping, and the Swiss were shocked to find that their gold was confiscated. The Swiss made appeals, but they were denied; they were entitled to paper money but not their gold. The Swiss company would have lost 40% of their gold&#x27;s value if they had tried to buy the same amount of gold with the paper money that they received in exchange for their confiscated gold.

Another type of &quot;de facto&quot; gold seizure occurred as a result of the various executive orders involving bonds, gold certificates and private contracts. Private contracts or bonds that were written in terms of gold were to be paid in paper currency instead of gold although all of the contracts and the bonds proclaimed that they were payable in gold, and at least one, the fourth Liberty Bond, was a federal instrument. The plaintiffs in all cases received paper money, instead of gold, despite the contracts&#x27; terms. The contracts and the bonds were written precisely to avoid currency debasement by requiring payment in gold coin. The paper money which was redeemable in gold was instead irredeemable based on &quot;Nortz v. United States&quot;, . The consolidated Gold Clause Cases were the following:
*&quot;Perry v. United States&quot;, 
*&quot;U.S. v. Bankers&#x27; Trust Co.,&quot; 294 U.S. 240 (1935)
*&quot;Norman v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.&quot;, 
*&quot;Nortz v. United States&quot;, 

The Supreme Court upheld all seizures as constitutional, with Justices James Clark McReynolds, Willis Van Devanter, George Sutherland, and Pierce Butler dissenting. The four justices were labelled the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; by the press, as their conservative views were in opposition to Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal supported by the press.

==Subsequent events and abrogation==
The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 made contractual gold clauses unenforceable. It also allowed the President to change the gold content of the US dollar by proclamation. Immediately following its passage, Roosevelt changed the gold content of the dollar from $20.67 to $35 per ounce, thereby devaluing US federal reserve notes, which were backed on gold. That valuation remained in effect until August 15, 1971, when President Richard Nixon announced that the US would no longer value the US dollar with a fixed amount of gold, thus abandoning the gold standard for foreign exchange (see Nixon Shock).

The private ownership of gold certificates was legalized in 1964, and they can be openly owned by collectors but are not redeemable in gold. The limitation on gold ownership in the US was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill to &quot;permit United States citizens to purchase, hold, sell, or otherwise deal with gold in the United States or abroad&quot; with an act of Congress codified in , which went into effect December 31, 1974. However, P. L. 93-373 did not repeal the Gold Repeal Joint Resolution, which banned any contracts that specified payment in a fixed amount of money as gold or a fixed amount of gold. That is, contracts remained unenforceable if they used gold monetarily, rather than as a commodity of trade. However, an Act enacted on Oct. 28, 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-147, § 4(c), 91 Stat. 1227, 1229 (originally codified at 31 U.S.C. § 463 note, recodified as amended at 31 U.S.C. § 5118(d)(2)) amended the 1933 Joint Resolution to make it clear that parties could again include so-called gold clauses in contracts made after 1977.

==Hoax of safe deposit box seizures==
According to a hoax, Roosevelt ordered all safe deposit boxes in the country seized and searched for gold by an official of the Internal Revenue Service. A typical example of the text of the alleged order reads:

The first known reference to the hoax was in the book &quot;After the Crash: Life In the New Great Depression&quot;. The fake text refers only to gold, not to silver, which was added by 1998 to Internet references. It claims to be an executive order, but its text was written it to apply to specific individuals (&quot;Your possession&quot;), and so if the text originated from the government, it would have been sent to individuals, not published as an executive order. The first paragraph starts with the actual text of Executive Order 6102, then edits it slightly (changing &quot;said national emergency&quot; to &quot;a national emergency&quot; and &quot;still continues to exist&quot; to &quot;still exists&quot;) and then adds invented text. The minor edits and the way that the real text and fake text are combined mid-sentence make it almost certainly an intentionally designed hoax, rather than an accident.

Most of the text does not appear in the actual executive order. In fact, safe deposit boxes held by individuals were not forcibly searched or seized under the order, and the few prosecutions that occurred in the 1930s for gold &quot;hoarding&quot; were executed under different statutes. One of the few such cases occurred in 1936, when a safe deposit box containing over of gold belonging to Zelik Josefowitz, who was not a US citizen, was seized with a search warrant as part of a prosecution for tax evasion.

The US Treasury also came into possession of a large number of safe deposit boxes due to bank failures. During the 1930s, over 3000 banks failed, and the contents of their safe deposit boxes were remanded to the custody of the Treasury. If no one claimed the box, it remained in the possession of the Treasury. In October 1981, there were 1605 cardboard cartons in the basement of the Treasury, each carton containing the contents of one unclaimed safe deposit box.

==Similar laws in other countries==
In Poland, a similar regulation was issued on November 7, 1919, which forced citizens to sell their gold and silver to the state. A month later, it was extended until January 31, 1920.

In Australia, Part IV of the Banking Act 1959 allows the Commonwealth government to seize private citizens&#x27; gold in return for paper money where the Governor-General is satisfied that it is expedient so to do, for the protection of the currency or of the public credit of the Commonwealth. On January 30, 1976, the operation of that part of the Act was suspended.

The United Kingdom introduced the gold trade ban law in 1966 (Exchange Control Act 1947). It became illegal for UK residents to continue to hold more than four gold coins dated after 1817, or to buy any gold coins unless they obtain collector licence from Bank of England. The reasoning was to prevent people from hoarding the gold, while the cost of living and inflation increased. This act was repealed in 1971.

<doc id="1020817" wikidata="Q3483118" url="?curid=1020817" title="Hyper Dyne Side Arms">
<text>is a 1986 side-scrolling shooter video game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. The player takes control of a flying mecha fighter who must battle an alien army. &quot;Side Arms&quot; uses a two-directional attacking system similar to Capcom&#x27;s previous shoot-&#x27;em-up &quot;Section Z&quot;.

== Plot ==
An evil alien empire known as the Bozon are launching a full-scale attack on Earth. As either Lt. Henry or Sgt. Sanders, the player must pilot a giant space mecha known as a &quot;Mobilsuit&quot; to defeat the aliens. Up to two players can play simultaneously.

==Gameplay==
The controls consist of an eight-way joystick for moving the Mobilsuit and three action buttons. &quot;Side Arms&quot; uses two shooting buttons, one for shooting to the left and the other to the right. The third button is used to change between the weapons acquired by the player. There are five types of power-ups that can be acquired by the player: a speed upgrade, an orbital bit that will provide additional firepower with the standard gun, a shotgun that shoots in a fan-shaped range, a three-way shooter, and a mega bazooka launcher that fires a laser beam. The player can choose what power-up their mecha will receive by shooting the power-up icon until getting the item they want. All of the weapons, as well as the mecha&#x27;s speed, can be upgraded up to two or even three levels depending on the item. There is also a speed downgrade that will reduce the Mobilsuit&#x27;s speed by one level. There are also two &quot;Auto&quot; power-ups, shaped like the enemy characters from &quot;Vulgus&quot;: one is shaped like the &quot;Yashichi&quot; and allows the player to fire continuously with either firing button held down; while the other, which is shaped like the &quot;Sakichi&quot;, allows the player to shoot upwards, downwards and forwards at the same time, but at a slower rate than the regular shot.

In addition to the standard power-ups, there are two special combination power-ups shaped like the Greek letters α and β that will combine the player&#x27;s Mobilsuit with an ally. This allows the player to do an eight-directional attack at the same time as their regular attack. When two players are playing this power-up will combine both players&#x27; suits instead. One player will move the combined suit and perform the regular attack, while the other will provide the eight-directional attack. If the combined suit gets shot, it will revert both suits into their regular separate states.

==Ports==
&quot;Side Arms&quot; was released for the PC Engine on July 14, 1989 in Japan by NEC Avenue. According to Takashi Tateishi, the composer for the PC Engine version, the port was actually developed by Capcom themselves, but published by NEC Avenue to avoid offending Nintendo. This version differs from the arcade game in that it allowed player to change weapons through a sub-menu while pausing the game, but the PC Engine version lacks the 2-player feature from the arcade game. This port was published in North America during the same year by Radiance Software.

There was also an improved port to the PC Engine CD-ROM, under the name &quot;. This version features a new &quot;Before Christ&quot; mode with various changes to gameplay.

Home computer versions of &quot;Side Arms&quot; were also released in Europe for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Commodore 64, and Atari ST, which were published by Go! and developed by Probe Software.

The original coin-op version of &quot;Side Arms&quot; is included in &quot;Capcom Classics Collection: Remixed&quot; for PlayStation Portable and &quot;Capcom Classics Collection: Vol. 2&quot; for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

In July 2022, &quot;Side Arms&quot; was also included in &quot;Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium&quot; for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows via Steam.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Hyper Dyne Side Arms&quot; on their February 1, 1987 issue as being the ninth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine reviewed the PC Engine version in 1989, giving it a 90% score.

==Appearances in other games==
A &quot;chibi&quot; version of the player&#x27;s Mobilsuit, called &quot;Mobichan&quot;, appears in the game as a power-up item that gives the player an extra life. Mobichan has appeared in many console games released by Capcom during the early 1990s as a mode select cursor such as in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of the original &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. The arcade game &quot;Warriors of Fate&quot; features a hidden ending sequence for completing the game on one credit which shows Mobichan and its Player 2 counterpart fighting each other dressed as Ryu and Ken and using their special techniques against each other.

Mobichan appeared as a bonus item in &quot;Super Buster Bros.&quot;, &quot;U.N. Squadron&quot; and &quot;Black Tiger&quot;.

Mobichan is the save icon for the Street Fighter Collection (&quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold&quot;) for the PlayStation.

In &quot;Namco x Capcom&quot;, the two nameless soldiers from &quot;Forgotten Worlds&quot; are accompanied by the Mobilsuits from &quot;Side Arms&quot;, who are named Side Arm α and Side Arm β in the game.

It also makes an appearance in &quot;Asura&#x27;s Wrath&quot; (Episode 5 intro).

In &quot;Project X Zone&quot;, Devilotte from &quot;&quot; summons Mobilsuits α &amp; β during her Solo Unit attack.

In &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot;, Baby Bonnie Hood from &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; summons Mobilsuits α &amp; β during her single-unit super attack.

In &quot;Mighty Final Fight&quot;, Mobichan is seen on the continue screen.

In &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;, when a player wins by the means of a taunt, Mobichan will be seen as the win symbol.

In &quot;Warzard&quot;, if the player beat the game with one credit they will be able to control Mobichan in the credits sequence and shoot down the letters. Mobichan is also a symbol that can be used when entering a password.

<doc id="1020827" wikidata="Q7987599" url="?curid=1020827" title="Western Avenue, London">
<text>Western Avenue is part of the A40, a major road running in a north-westerly direction out of London. Western Avenue is approximately long from its junction with Old Oak Common Lane in East Acton.

A notable landmark on Western Avenue at Perivale, near Greenford, is the Art Deco Hoover Building, now a Tesco supermarket and 66 homes.

==History==
The road was first proposed in 1912 as a bypass of Uxbridge Road, part of the historic coaching road from London to Oxford. Construction began in 1921 and continued throughout the 1920s and 30s. It was completed to Denham in 1943. When first constructed, all intersections with other roads were flat junctions with roundabouts, resulting in significant congestion at busy periods.

In the early 1960s, the Hanger Lane junction was improved, with an underpass built to take Western Avenue under the A406. Then, during the 1980s and early 1990s, the road was expanded, and all the junctions west of Hanger Lane were improved. A flyover was built at the Greenford Roundabout to take Western Avenue over the A4127; the other junctions take Western Avenue under the crossing road.

The last junction to be improved was Hillingdon Circus. Here, the work diverted Western Avenue to the north of the old line of the road, taking it under both the A437 and the Uxbridge branch of the Metropolitan line; Hillingdon London Underground Station was rebuilt as part of the work.

Further expansion plans in the late 1990s resulted in the demolition of more than 100 houses along the eastern part of the road. However, these plans were ultimately never realised.

==Route==
Originally a roundabout, Western Circus became known as Savoy Circus, when the Savoy cinema opened at the junction in 1931. East of this point is the Westway, part of the A40 Central London link to Paddington. After Savoy Circus, the dual carriageway takes a bend towards North Acton, crossing the North London line and the Great Western Main Line. The first major junction is Gypsy Corner (with the A4000, ), connecting northwards to Park Royal and Harlesden and southwards to Acton town centre. Starting with the Hanger Lane Gyratory System (with the A406 and A4005, ); this is followed by a junction with the (B452) at Perivale (), connecting southwards to West Ealing and the River Thames at Kew Bridge; the &quot;Greenford Roundabout&quot; (with the A4127, ), connecting northwards to Harrow and southwards to Southall; the Target Roundabout (with the A312, ), a junction for Heathrow Airport; and the Polish War Memorial junction (with the A4180, ) for RAF Northolt.

In the final few miles of the road, there are minor junctions with the A437 (Hillingdon Circus) to Ruislip and Hillingdon, and with the B467 (Swakeleys Roundabout) to Uxbridge, before the road ends at the junction with the M40 at the Denham Roundabout, northwest of Uxbridge.

==Air crash==
Western Avenue borders RAF Northolt in South Ruislip. On Tuesday 13 August 1996, in a very unusual accident, a Lear Jet landing at the airfield overshot the runway and ended up crashing into a van that just happened to be passing on the A40. The van driver was not seriously injured, despite being trapped for 40 minutes. It was later determined that the crash may have been caused when the Spanish pilot and co-pilot were having a disagreement over who should handle the landing. There was only one passenger on the Lear Jet, an actress named Lisa Hogan, who was slightly injured.

==In popular culture==
* Western Avenue features heavily in &quot;Crash&quot;, the 1973 J. G. Ballard novel about symphorophilia (car-crash fetishism).
* Edward Platt won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and a Somerset Maugham Award for his 2000 book &quot;Leadville&quot;, about the Western Avenue.

<doc id="1020830" wikidata="Q5248087" url="?curid=1020830" title="Jericho (DC Comics)">
<text>Jericho (Joseph William Wilson) is a fictional character appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. The character was originally a superhero, the son of Deathstroke, and a member of the Teen Titans during &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; period by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez. Since the early 1990s Jericho has gone through periods of both sanity and insanity.

Joe Wilson going by the name &quot;Kane Wolfman&quot; appeared as a recurring character on the sixth and seventh seasons of The CW Arrowverse show &quot;Arrow&quot;, played by Liam Hall. He also appeared as a recurring character on the second season of the DC Universe series &quot;Titans&quot;, portrayed by Chella Man.

==Publication history==
Jericho first appeared in &quot;Tales of the Teen Titans&quot; #43 and was created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez.

==Development==
Jericho was created in the early 1980s, a few years after Marv Wolfman and George Pérez relaunched the Teen Titans series and turned it into a major hit for DC Comics. At the time, Wolfman and Pérez were interested in distancing the team from the Justice League, many of whose members had been mentors to the Titans. This meant introducing new characters such as the mystical Raven and the technological Cyborg, as well as changing some of the existing characters, such as having Dick Grayson trade in his identity as Robin in favor of becoming Nightwing. Jericho was part of this process of establishing the team as its own feature rather than, in Pérez&#x27; words, a &quot;Justice Little League&quot;. Marv Wolfman had decided on the name, which he got from an unused story from the previous Titans series, and with the idea of Jericho being the son of Deathstroke, but could not think of any other aspects of the character. Pérez worked out the design, powers, and personality of Jericho and also suggested making the character mute. He also insisted that Jericho&#x27;s emotions be conveyed entirely through visuals, without the use of thought balloons. Pérez claims that Jericho is the first character which he created by himself.

==Fictional character biography==
===Childhood===
Jericho is the second child of Slade Wilson (Deathstroke) and Adeline Kane. Jackal kidnaps Jericho in retaliation for Deathstroke killing an important colonel. Slade rescues Jericho, but one of his men slits his throat and renders him mute.

Slade and Adeline later divorce, with Adeline obtaining custody of Jericho and his older brother Grant. Jericho discovers that he is a metahuman who can possess others via eye contact and joins Adeline as a member of her espionage organization, Searchers Inc.

===Titans===
Sometime later (in a storyline called &quot;The Judas Contract&quot;), Adeline and Joseph discovered that Deathstroke had accepted a contract on the Teen Titans. Adeline and Joseph approached Dick Grayson to help him rescue the Titans, with Joseph adopting the identity of Jericho. The rescue mission was a success, and Jericho subsequently joined the team, but the Titans were initially wary of him because of his relationship to Deathstroke and the betrayal of Terra.

Jericho proved to be a sensitive and pure-hearted individual and was a loyal Titan for many years. Shortly after he joined the Titans, another new member, Kole, joined and Jericho immediately developed a bond with her. Jericho also developed a close and affectionate relationship with Raven, having possessed her once and learned about her demonic heritage. Jericho was the first Titan to understand Raven, bonding over their pasts with their fathers and finding comfort with one another.

===Turn to villainy and redemption===
Later, Jericho is possessed by the souls of Azarath and killed by Deathstroke. He possesses Deathstroke before dying and lays dormant before resurfacing. He is transferred to a new body, but is driven insane by the remnants of the personalities he had absorbed over the years and battles the Teen Titans on several occasions. Vigilante gouges out Jericho&#x27;s eyes to disable his possession abilities, traumatizing him and reawakening his original personality. It is later revealed that Jericho regenerated his eyes.

Jericho later possesses Deathstroke and attempts to kill him, but is stopped by DJ Molecule. Arsenal and Jericho decide to form a new team of Titans to restore the legacy that Deathstroke damaged.

===The New 52===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), two versions of Jericho were presented. Jericho is initially depicted as an antagonist in Rob Liefeld&#x27;s &quot;Deathstroke&quot; vol. 2, but restored to his traditional heroic depiction in &quot;Deathstroke&quot; (vol. 3).

===DC Rebirth===
Jericho later reappears after the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch, once again mute and with his origin restored, though slightly modernized. This version of Jericho is also bisexual.

Unlike his blissful childhood in the original comics, Jericho&#x27;s family life was strained by the time he was a young teenager, as his father and mother were constantly fighting over his father&#x27;s long absences due to his supposed government missions.

As a young adult, Jericho works as an executive vice-president for a tech firm that his mother owns in Los Angeles, and is engaged to his interpreter Etienne. Etienne is later revealed to be a member of H.I.V.E. and is killed by Rose Wilson.

==Powers and abilities==
Jericho can possess a person after making eye contact with them; his body turns insubstantial and enters the subject. While he is in possession, Jericho has access to all of that host&#x27;s powers (physical, mental, and magical), and is also able to tap into their memories. Jericho&#x27;s victim remains conscious and can express themselves vocally, but they are otherwise unable to control their body&#x27;s actions while they are possessed by Jericho. If the person is unconscious or asleep upon possession, Jericho can use their voice to speak, albeit with their accent or any other speech impairments, and only using the words they know. Jericho sometimes uses the American manual alphabet letter &quot;J&quot; as his sign name to signal to his allies that he has taken possession of a person. Once the person&#x27;s mind regains consciousness, they regain their awareness and ability to speak independently.

Despite his pacifistic nature and dislike for physical violence, he is also skilled in hand-to-hand combat and able to hold his own against his father, Deathstroke.

When possessed by the spirits of Azarath, Jericho had a powerful lion soul self and a healing ability.

===Powers and abilities in The New 52===
In &quot;The New 52&quot;, Jericho receives an array of psychic abilities aside from his possession powers, such as being able to telepathically control his brother Grant and his mother Adeline.

Despite conflicting continuity between &quot;Deathstroke&quot; vol. 2 and 3, Jericho still retains his telepathy to read minds and control others. After being experimented upon, Jericho demonstrated even more powerful abilities to rupture other human beings apart with a psychic blast, much to his horror. Although his telepathy can be blocked by others with mental powers, Jericho can read their aura to see if they hold malicious intents and can also project an energy field to defend against attacks.

===Powers and abilities in DC Rebirth===
In &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Jericho demonstrates the ability to separate his incorporeal, spiritual self from his physical body when he uses his powers to possess other people. Unlike his usual way of possessing others, Jericho describes this ability like a near field communication, being able to possess people within a certain distance from him, and the person he is possessing speaks using his voice, not theirs. In addition, his physical body is dormant and immobile, leaving it vulnerable to attacks if no one is there to protect it.

==Other versions==

* An alternate universe variant of Jericho appears in &quot;Tiny Titans&quot;.
* An alternate universe variant of Jericho appears in &quot;Teen Titans: Earth One&quot;. This version was manipulated and brainwashed by Elinore Stone of S.T.A.R. Labs into spying and fighting against his fellow &quot;Project Titans&quot; members.

==In other media==
===Television===

* Jericho appears in &quot;Teen Titans&quot;. This version is an honorary member of the eponymous team unconnected to Slade whose green eye color extends to whomever he is possessing.
* Joe Wilson appears in media set in the Arrowverse, portrayed by Liam Hall as an adult and William Franklyn-Miller as a child.
** Primarily appearing in &quot;Arrow&quot;, this version has a more violent personality, plays a villainous role akin to his brother Grant Wilson, is the god-son of Billy Wintergreen, and is not mute. In flashbacks depicted in the sixth season, Joe followed in Wintergreen his father Slade Wilson&#x27;s footsteps and joined the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS). After Slade returned from a mission on Lian Yu, he and Joe worked with each other for some time until Slade massacred their comrades in a Mirakuru serum-induced frenzy and left to seek revenge on Oliver Queen. Following this, Joe became a criminal and traveled to Kasnia, where he rejected his birth name, took the alias Kane Wolfman, was taken prisoner by the local government, and joined a criminal organization called the Jackals, eventually becoming their leader. In the present, a cured Slade and Queen travel to Kasnia to find Joe, believing he is still imprisoned before discovering what happened afterward. Joe attempts to force Slade to kill Queen, but his father refuses and fights him and the Jackals instead. While escaping, Joe reveals Slade has another son named Grant and that their mother kept him secret from Slade. In the seventh season, Joe assumes Slade&#x27;s Deathstroke suit, travels to Star City, and fights A.R.G.U.S. agents until he is apprehended by Oliver, the Flash, and Supergirl. After being taken into A.R.G.U.S.&#x27;s custody, Joe is later recruited into the &quot;Ghost Initiative&quot;.
** Joe makes a cameo appearance in the crossover &quot;Elseworlds&quot; as a Central City Police Department police officer in an altered reality created by John Deegan.
* Jericho appears in &quot;Titans&quot;, portrayed by Chella Man. This version is the oldest child of Deathstroke who was rendered mute after enemies of Deathstroke&#x27;s threatened Jericho to reach him, after which Jericho&#x27;s overprotective mother Adeline took him and left Deathstroke. Five years prior, despite living away from his father and being unaware of his mercenary work, Jericho admired him. Seeking to exploit this, Deathstroke&#x27;s enemy Dick Grayson befriends Jericho, invited him to join the Titans, and revealed the truth about his father. Uncertain about this, Jericho locates his father in the hopes of learning his side of the story, only to get caught in a fight between Deathstroke and Grayson, during which Jericho sacrificed himself to save the latter. While his body died, Jericho&#x27;s spirit became trapped in Deathstroke&#x27;s body for the next four years until his sister Rose Wilson grievously injures Deathstroke, causing Jericho&#x27;s spirit to jump to her body.

===Film===
* Jericho makes a non-speaking appearance in &quot;Teen Titans: The Judas Contract&quot; as a test subject of Brother Blood, who developed a machine capable of granting people superpowers. Once the experiment is finished, Mother Mayhem seemingly kills Jericho, though he turns up alive in the post-credits scene.
* Jericho appears in &quot;&quot;, voiced by Griffin Puatu as a teenager and Asher Bishop as a child. Seeking revenge on his absentee father Slade Wilson, a conflicted Jericho joins his sister Rose Wilson and H.I.V.E. to take over the world before reconciling with his parents.

===Video games===
* Jericho appears in &quot;DC Universe Online&quot; as part of the &quot;Teen Titans: The Judas Contract&quot; DLC. This version is an associate of the Teen Titans.
* Jericho appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.
* Jericho appears as a playable character in &quot;DC Legends&quot;.

===Miscellaneous===
* Jericho appears in &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;.
* The &quot;Arrow&quot; incarnation of Joe Wilson appears in the non-canonical tie-in novel &quot;Arrow: Vengeance&quot;. In this version of events, following Slade Wilson&#x27;s return from Lian Yu, he abused ASIS resources to find Oliver Queen. When his superior Wade DeFarge discovered this, Slade attempted to kill him, but Joe and his mother Addie were killed in the crossfire.
* Joseph Wilson / Jericho appears in &quot;&quot;, voiced by Griffin Puatu as a teenager and Asher Bishop as a child. This version is the only son of Slade and Adeline who shares a close relationship with the former. Additionally, he was rendered mute after H.I.V.E. took him hostage to coerce Slade to join them and Joseph&#x27;s throat was slit. Following this, Slade left him and Adeline, who sent Joseph to a private boarding school in Switzerland. The isolation and trauma left the now teenage Joseph angry and resentful as he was forced to address his burgeoning and unstable psionic powers alone, which cause him to enter a trance-like state and become more violent due to his lack of control over them.

==Sexuality==
When Marv Wolfman and George Pérez were creating the character, they toyed around with the idea of making Joseph gay. Pérez had this to say: &quot;While Marv and I did discuss the possibility of Joseph Wilson being gay, Marv decided that it was too much of a stereotype to have the sensitive, artistic, and wide-eyed character with arguably effeminate features be also homosexual&quot;. However, it is eventually revealed that he is not interested in women, saying in sign language to Kole, who was in love with him, that he is gay in &quot;Convergence: New Teen Titans&quot; #2, which was confirmed by artist Nicola Scott. The DC Rebirth version of Joseph is canonically confirmed to be bisexual, as is his &quot;Titans&quot; TV series version.

<doc id="1020834" wikidata="Q2844009" url="?curid=1020834" title="Shigesato Itoi">
<text>is a Japanese copywriter, essayist, lyricist, game designer, and actor. Itoi is the editor-in-chief of his website and company &quot;Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun&quot; (&quot;Almost Daily Itoi Newspaper&quot;). He is best known outside Japan for his work on Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mother&quot;/&quot;EarthBound&quot; series of games, as well as his self-titled bass fishing video game.

==Writing==
During the 1980s Itoi established the profession of writing copy for advertisements among the general public in Japan. In 1981, he co-authored a collection of short stories titled &quot;Yume de Aimashou&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s meet in a dream&quot;) with writer Haruki Murakami. Later Itoi branched into writing essays, lyrics, and designing video games. He is best known outside of Japan for Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;EarthBound&quot;, released in 1994 in Japan (as &quot;Mother 2: Giygas Strikes Back&quot;) and in 1995 in North America.

In 1997, Itoi began using the Internet and bought his first Macintosh. In 1998 he started the website and company Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun (&quot;Almost Daily Itoi Newspaper&quot;), which is the center of his activity today. Under the theme of &quot;creating good mood&quot;, the website has been updated every day for the past 15 years, with Itoi&#x27;s essays on lifestyle, interviews and articles, and merchandise sales. He talks about his pet dogs and his interviews with artists, craftsmen, businessmen, etc., which tend to center on philosophical issues. Itoi has co-written several books modeled on these interviews, in which he has a series of long conversations with, for example, an expert on neurology Yūji Ikegaya, about how to live as a human being in the world. Books collecting Itoi&#x27;s past essays written on the site&#x27;s front page are also available for purchase.

==Filmography==
Itoi has voiced Satsuki&#x27;s father, Tatsuo Kusakabe, in the original Japanese version of the 1988 Studio Ghibli film &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;. He has been a judge on several episodes of the Japanese television shows &quot;Iron Chef&quot; and &quot;Hey! Spring of Trivia&quot;. He made his live-action acting debut in 2010, when he played the role of a professor in the film adaptation of Haruki Murakami&#x27;s &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;.
==Video games==
Itoi established the company Ape, Inc. as a venue for external developers to help make games for Nintendo. He was the creator of the &quot;Mother&quot; series. In the original &quot;Mother&quot; for the Famicom, he was lead designer, writer and director, while on &quot;Mother 2&quot; (released as EarthBound in the West) for the SNES, Itoi was producer, director and writer. He had initially envisioned &quot;Mother 3&quot; as a highly ambitious title for the ill-fated Nintendo 64DD peripheral which would have transitioned the series into 3D graphics and featured elaborate cinematic cutscenes; however this version of the game never came to fruition due to the failure of the 64DD, and Mother 3 was instead reimagined as a 2D title for Game Boy Advance closer in scope to the first two titles, with Itoi credited as the writer of the story. Another unrealized 64DD title Itoi had been involved in developing around this time was the pet simulator video game &quot;Cabbage&quot;, which was canceled after years in development hell.

Itoi claims that the final battle of &quot;EarthBound&quot; with Giygas was inspired from his accidental childhood viewing of the Shintoho film titled &quot;The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty&quot;. Specifically, the scene that inspired the battle was a scene depicting a woman being murdered, which he mistook for rape.

Itoi has said that he would not be involved in a fourth title of the series. Itoi&#x27;s works have had an impact on other games and other media, including &quot;Undertale&quot;, and others.

== Other ventures ==

Shigesato Itoi worked with Nintendo to design video game-themed haramaki.

Itoi is an avid Monopoly player and is President of the . He also competed in the 1992 Monopoly World Championships and placed eighth. Itoi&#x27;s video game development company Ape, Inc. developed two Monopoly games for the Super Famicom, with Itoi serving as producer. These versions of Monopoly were not released outside of Japan and featured a more role-playing experience.

Itoi launched a photo creation tool called &quot;Dokonoko&quot;, which is designed specifically to be used with pets. It has been described as an &quot;Instagram for pets&quot;. Dokonoko is most famous for a particular Japanese Labrador Retriever named Corky, who made front line news because of the abnormal length of her tongue.

== Personal life ==
Itoi was born on November 10, 1948, and raised in Maebashi, Gunma. He was a heavy smoker until he quit in 2002. Itoi has been married to actress Kanako Higuchi since 1993. In a 2019 interview, he mentioned that he has asthma, which causes him to cough when lying down. He would often play &quot;Mario&quot; when he was unable to sleep at night due to his asthma, and stated that he felt &quot;indebted to Nintendo&quot; and specifically wanted to work with them on &quot;Mother&quot; due to this. The protagonist of the game, Ninten, also has asthma, which was one of the first aspects of his character Itoi came up with.

<doc id="1020838" wikidata="Q317032" url="?curid=1020838" title="Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf">
<text>Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf ( HHU; ), named after German poet Heinrich Heine, is a public university in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, which was founded in 1965. It is the successor organization to Düsseldorf&#x27;s Medical Academy of 1907.

Following several expansions throughout the decades, the university has comprised five faculties since 1993. Currently, more than 36,000 full-time students are studying at HHU and a total staff of approximately 3,600 people (academic and non-academic).

==History==
Düsseldorf University began with the Düsseldorf Academy for Practical Medicine in 1907. The city&#x27;s first real university, however, was only founded in 1965 by adding a combined Faculty of Natural Sciences–Arts and Humanities to the existing medical one. Only four years later, the university split the combined faculty into two separate bodies, which led to the constitution of a Faculty of Arts and Humanities as well as a Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. In 1979 a modern University and State Library was opened to the public, and a sports centre was added in 1980/81. Following a quarrel of more than 23 years, the &quot;nameless&quot; university of Düsseldorf was finally christened after the poet Heinrich Heine, one of Düsseldorf&#x27;s most famous sons, in 1989. From this period on, the campus university has been opening up towards the city and its citizens. Heinrich Heine University&#x27;s Faculty of Business Administration and Economics opened in 1990, and the Faculty of Law opened in 1993.

==Campus and grounds==
HHU&#x27;s roughly triangular campus is located in the southeast of Düsseldorf, in the Bilk district. To the north, it borders the campus of the university hospital with which it forms a unit. Both campuses together expand over approximately 1,300,000 square metres (circa 130 hectares).

New sections, such as the Student Service Center (SSC), have been added to existing parts of the campus. Already completed are the new Oeconomicum building (Faculty of Business Administration and Economics) and the new O.A.S.E. library (medical literature) – the latter one of Germany&#x27;s most up-to-date structures for individual study and group work

===University and State Library (ULB) Düsseldorf===
The ULB Düsseldorf is one of three state libraries in North Rhine-Westphalia and one of Germany&#x27;s innovation leaders in the library sector due to its high service standards and the volume of its collections (currently 4 stars in the public library ratings). In its university library function, it collects, archives and cares for scientific resources. In its state library function, it does alike for regional literature.

===Centre for Information and Media Technology (ZIM)===
As a central unit and (multi) media centre of HHU, the ZIM provides competencies and services in the field of digital information delivery and processing. Further fields of activity are digital communication and digital media.

===Botanical Garden===
The Botanical Garden of Düsseldorf is a scientific institution of HHU, which cultivates about 6,000 different kinds of plants from all around the globe. It is open to visitors throughout the whole year.

==Faculties==

===Medicine===
With more than 3,000 students in the winter semester 2011/12, the Medical Faculty is HHU&#x27;s third largest unit. Study offers range from Medicine and Dentistry (state examination) through Toxicology (MSc) to Public Health and Endocrinology (both MSc, further education). 
Graduate studies have been institutionalised in the form of the faculty-wide Medical Research School Düsseldorf, which offers networking, services and counselling for both graduate students and their supervisors. Further structured doctorate support is provided by research training groups in neurosciences (RTG 1033, iBrain), in hepatology (research training in CRC 974) and in tumor research (Düsseldorf School of Oncology DSO). 
Research hubs with a significant volume of third-party founded collaborative projects are hepatology (CRC 974 and Research Unit 217), cardiovascular research, neurosciences, surgery (Research Unit 1585), infectiology and immunology (Research Unit 729), and diabetes and metabolism research. 
The Biomedical Research Centre (BMFZ), the Leibniz-Institute for Environmental Medicine (IUF), the C. and O. Vogt Institute for Brain Research and the German Diabetes Centre (DDZ) are important organisations that form the local research environment.

===Arts and Humanities===
About 8,000 students (winter semester 2011/12) in currently 26 B.A. and M.A. programmes make the Faculty of Arts and Humanities HHU&#x27;s largest unit. It offers the prestigious M.A. in European Studies, a unique one-year English-taught course especially designed for exceptional graduates from universities in Israel, Palestine and Jordan. Recently, the program became increasingly popular with graduates from other regions globally. The German-French master programme Media Culture Analysis / Analyse de Pratiques Culturelles, enables students to obtain a double diploma of both the HHU and the University of Nantes. At doctoral level the academy of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, PhilGrad, offers a broad range of counselling and career-relevant courses. Further support for structured doctorates provide programmes in the history of art (RTG 1678), in linguistics (research training in CRC 991), in ageing-related studies and in democracy research (Link.De) as well as within two German-Italian programmes (Interculturality and Communication, &quot;Doctor Europaeus&quot;). Among the research hubs in the faculty are linguistics (CRC 991), politics (Research Unit 1381), ancient history (funded by the NRW Academy for the Arts and Sciences), the history of art, and editing studies (complete works editions of Max Weber and Martin Buber in progress). Beyond that, the Faculty of Arts and Humanities contributes to HHU&#x27;s Institute of German and International Party Law and Party Research (PRuF).

===Mathematics and Natural Sciences===
HHU&#x27;s second largest faculty offers its approximately 6,500 students (winter semester 2011/12) ten basic programmes (B.A. and state examination) and nine graduate programmes (MSc). Special programmes such as the four-year &quot;bachelor plus&quot;, in which students spend one year at Michigan State University in East Lansing or at the University of Western Australia in Perth, and the international MSc in Biology enable students to gain international experience. 
The faculty has institutionalised support for doctoral studies in the form of iGRAD, the Interdisciplinary Graduate and Research Academy Düsseldorf to establish network structures and offer counselling and training services for doctoral students, supervisors and research training groups. Further backing for structured doctorates provide the following programmes: RTG 1203 Dynamics in Hot Plasms (DFG), Graduate Cluster CLIB, NRW Research Academy Biostruct, RTG &quot;Molecules of Infection&quot; (Manchot Foundation), the international graduate school iGRAD-Plant in collaboration with the Forschungszentrum Jülich and Michigan State University, US; and the internally funded initiatives vivid, e-norm, and iGRASPseed.
Research hubs with a significant volume of third-party founded collaborative projects are biology (Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences CEPLAS) and physics (CRC-TR 6, CRC-TR 18). 
The Biomedical Research Center (BMFZ) and the Bioeconomy Science Center (a cluster of 54 departments of the universities of Aachen, Bonn and Düsseldorf, as well as the Forschungszentrum Jülich) are important organisations forming the local research environment.

===Business Administration and Economics===
One of HHU&#x27;s smaller faculties, the Faculty of Business Administration and Economics, attracted about 1,100 students in the winter semester 2011/12. The faculty is housed in the futuristic Oeconomicum building and offers Business Administration (BSc and MSc), Economics (BSc and MSc) and Business Chemistry (BSc and MSc, in cooperation with the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences).
Further education is provided by the Düsseldorf Business School (DBS), which offers MBA-Programmes against a tuition fee. Examples are General Management MBAs (in German as well as in English) and Health Management (in cooperation with the Health Care Academy Düsseldorf).
A major research hub in economics is competition economics, funded through the DFG ANR Project and centred in the Düsseldorf Institute for Competition Economics (DICE). Business studies focus on finance, accounting, management and marketing.

===Law===
The Faculty of Law offers practically oriented courses for the state examination in law through cooperation with various local institutions (e.g. courts such as the Appeal Court, District Court and Fiscal Court).

Beyond that, a specialty is a German-French course of law studies organized together with the University of Cergy-Pontoise near Paris which annually gives 15 German and 15 French law students the possibility to study both legal systems since 2005. Graduates of this three year law course are awarded the German legal &quot;Zwischenprüfung&quot; (German LL.B. equivalent) as well as the French &quot;licence mention droit&quot; (French LL.B. equivalent). Since 2008, the universities offer a subsequent two-year course whose participants specialize in business, labor as well as employment law and graduate with the French &quot;Master 2 mention droit de l&#x27;entreprise&quot; (French J.D. equivalent). Subsequently, they are also eligible for the German state examination in law (German J.D. equivalent) and for an admission exam with a French attorney&#x27;s law school (École de formation de barreau – EFB).

Another speciality is an extra-curricular qualification in Anglo-American law.

Further education is provided by Düsseldorf Law School (DLS), which offers postgraduate masters in the protection of commercial rights, information rights and medical rights against a tuition fee. 
Research focuses on commercial law, European law and international law. Hubs are the Centre for Information and Technology Law (ZfI), the Centre for Medical Law (IMR), the Insurance Law Institute, and the Institute of German and International Party Law and Party Research (PRuF).

==Governance==

===The President&#x27;s Office===
Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf is a public corporation of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia. Its degree of autonomy from state ministries and other legal bodies is defined in the Higher Education Autonomy Act (HFG) of 31 October 2006. 
The rectorate (also called the president&#x27;s office, see HFG §15) manages the university. Its members are the president, four vice-presidents and the chancellor. From October 2008 to 2014, the president has been the physiologist Professor Michael Piper. Since November 2014 Professor Anja Steinbeck is the president of the HHU.

===The University Council===
The University Council consists of three internal and five external members. It gives advice to the president&#x27;s office and supervises their administration of university business (§21,3 HFG). The first University Council was inaugurated in October 2007. Current chairperson of the council is Anne-José Paulsen, a judge and president of the Appeal Court of Düsseldorf (Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf).

===The Senate===
The Senate is the central democratic organ for discussions between the university&#x27;s various status groups. Their representatives are elected by the university public. Further senate members are the chancellor and the president.
University law gives the senate the right to confirm elected rectorate members in their office. Furthermore, it can give &quot;recommendations and statements&quot; concerning the university&#x27;s development. To a certain extent, statements have a binding character for the President&#x27;s Office.

===Faculty council===
Each faculty council represents the interests of the various status groups within a faculty. It elects a dean as the head of faculty management (Dean&#x27;s Office). Deans represent a faculty and its interests to the president&#x27;s office.

===Student representation===
The student parliament is the highest plenary organ of all matriculated students at HHU.
The central representative of student life and the voice of students&#x27; demands in university politics is the AStA (Allgemeiner Studierendenausschuss). 
One student association for each academic subject represents the interests of the students within the university community.

===Central Administration===
The central administration has five departments: student affairs, academic management, personnel and organisation, finance, and facility management. It is the backbone of the university in terms of formal structures and governance processes. Head of approximately 340 administrative staff is the chancellor. Furthermore, the chancellor&#x27;s three staff offices are responsible for legal advisory, work safety and protection of the environment, and internal auditing. Current tasks for the university administration are the implementation of a campus management system as well as the renovation and improvement of campus infrastructure.

===National===
In 2012 HHU and its partner institutions – the University of Cologne, the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research and Forschungszentrum Jülich – received the grant for the Cluster of Excellence CEPLAS in the Excellence Initiative of the German Federal and State Governments.

===International===
HHU is currently involved in 23 international projects funded within the EU&#x27;s Seventh Framework Programme. 11 further international projects have just ended. Twelve HHU researchers at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences currently have the prestigious ERC Grants.

===A culture of entrepreneurship===
HHU promotes research- and knowledge-based start-ups. Its concept to strengthen an entrepreneurial culture at and around HHU was successful in the EXIST competition of the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany). 

==International profile==

===International study programmes and doctoral studies===
At present five degree programmes at HHU are taught in English: The Faculty of Arts and Humanities offers English Studies (B.A.), Comparative Studies in English and American Literature (M.A.) and European Studies (M.A.); furthermore, an International MSc in biology and an English-language MSc in Physics address students at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. 
International doctoral research programmes are available in the &quot;Faculties&quot; section.

===International partners in higher education===
Key regions of HHU&#x27;s internationalisation activities are Europe, United States, Japan and the Near East. At the moment there are 13 collaborations at university level, 80 collaborations in research or teaching at faculty or institute level, and over 140 Erasmus partnerships.

==Student life==
The Student Service Centre (SSC) offers counselling and services.

Sports are coordinated by the students&#x27; representation (AStA) of Düsseldorf&#x27;s four higher education institutions in a joint initiative. On offer are about 100 kinds of sports, workshops and sports holidays. Once a year the four AStAs organise a common sports day.

Musical initiatives include the AStA&#x27;s Local Heroes event, a platform for local bands, as well as jam sessions. There is also a semi-professional university orchestra. Once a year the short film competition for young talents from the region takes place on campus. 
There are various (student) associations, clubs, networks and societies. Examples are the local UNICEF group, a debating club, the European Student Network and the campus radio.

Since 1989 the Heinrich Heine Guest Lecture has repeatedly drawn high-profile speakers to the university&#x27;s campus. These guest professors usually perform a small series of lectures for the general public on topic(s) that are currently in the focus of public attention. Speakers have included, for example, Marcel Reich-Ranicki, Helmut Schmidt and Joschka Fischer. New traditions have come to supplement the guest lecture: since 2010 the &quot;University Speech&quot; and since 2011 the &quot;Heinrich Heine Professorship for Business and Economics&quot;, both performed by external speakers of high calibre.

===Study fees and scholarships===
As a German public university, HHU receives funding from the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia and therefore does not charge tuition fees. However, a small service charge of currently about 230 Euros per semester (winter semester 2012/13) has become necessary to cover the expenses of the AStA, of student services such as housing and canteen organisation (Studentenwerk) and the semester ticket for free rides on all local trains and busses.
Various scholarships are available to cover specific student expenses and/or needs. For example, there are bursary programmes to cover living costs, facilitate stays abroad, or to finish one&#x27;s final thesis. Within the National Scholarship Programme at German universities, for example, HHU currently ranks among the top 5 providers of scholarships.

<text>The University of Olivet, formerly known as Olivet College, is a private Christian college in Olivet, Michigan. The college is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It was founded in 1844 by missionaries from Oberlin College, and it followed Oberlin in becoming the second coeducational college or university in the United States. The University of Olivet is affiliated with the United Church of Christ and the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches and stands in the Reformed tradition of Protestantism.

==History==


In 1844, after founding Oberlin College, John Jay Shipherd and 39 missionaries, including Oberlin faculty, students, and alumni, came to Michigan to create a college, which Shipherd deemed &quot;New Oberlin.&quot;

The original land for the college was to be in Grand River City, aka Delta Mills, in Delta Township, Eaton County, approximately from where the college stands. Olivetian lore says that while Shipherd was on a trip to the site in Eaton County, his horse continued to get lost, and would always wander back to a hill with an oak grove, which is where Olivet&#x27;s Campus Square exists today. Shipherd decided that powers from above must be drawing the horse back to this site, and Shipherd deemed that this would become the site for &quot;New Oberlin.&quot; He then chose to name it Olivet, however, after the biblical Mount of Olives.

The first courses began in December 1844. Because President Reuben Hatch&#x27;s petition for a charter was denied, Olivet became the Olivet Institute, and remained a two-year school until chartered in 1859.

The 20th century saw Olivet College become a liberal arts school, with a short-lived attempt at an Oxford-style curriculum from 1934 to 1944.

A marker designating the college as a Michigan Historic Site was erected in 1960 by the Michigan Historical Commission. The inscription reads:

On February 24, 1844, the Reverend John J. &quot;Father&quot; Shipherd and thirty-nine followers arrived by ox-cart on this wilderness hilltop, driving their herds before them. They felt God had directed them to this oak grove for the purpose of founding a coeducational Christian college open to students of all races. First chartered as Olivet Institute, the school received its charter as a college in 1859. For over a century it has given a broad liberal arts education, with strong support from the Congregational church. Many alumni have gone forth &quot;Pro Christo et Humanitate&quot;.
After assuming leadership in 2010, President Steven Corey announced the &quot;Olivet College 2020 and Beyond Strategic Plan&quot;, which includes renovating existing buildings and facilities, creating a new student center, increasing endowment, and expand the student population to 1,500.

The board of trustees unanimously approved a change in the institution&#x27;s name to University of Olivet in 2023.

==Academics==
Olivet offers 35 programs that lead to a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a master&#x27;s degree of Business Administration, Counseling, and Leadership. Its most popular undergraduate majors, in terms of 2021 graduates, were:
::Criminal Justice/Safety Studies (19)
::Psychology (18)
::Business Administration &amp; Management (15)
::Insurance (14)
::Registered Nursing/Registered Nurse (11)
::Exercise Science &amp; Kinesiology (10)

Olivet College has approximately 1,040 students, 40% female and 60% male. 74% of classes have less than 24 students, and there is a 16:1 student/faculty ratio. The college has a 59% retention rate for first to second year students.

==Student life==

=== Greek life ===
The Soronian Society or Iota Kappa Omicron was founded at Olivet in 1847 and was the first women&#x27;s literary society in the United States. Phi Alpha Pi was founded at the institution in 1861 and is the oldest active fraternity on campus. Alpha Lambda Epsilon is a coed society and literary society that was established on campus in 1922. 

=== Olivet College radio ===

Olivet College has an FCC-licensed non-commercial educational student-run radio station, broadcasting in the Olivet area at 89.1 MHz FM with the callsign WOCR. The broadcast is also available for people outside the studio range online at. Students can volunteer for a radio shift from 7:30am to midnight Monday through Friday to broadcast music, campus events, news, and talk shows. Comet Football and Basketball is also often broadcast live from the game site.
==Athletics==

Along with Albion College and Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University), Olivet founded the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA) in 1888. The MIAA is the nation&#x27;s oldest collegiate conference. Olivet College athletic teams, nicknamed the Comets, participate in the following intercollegiate sports as a member of the MIAA include:

Men: baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track and field (indoor and outdoor), volleyball and wrestling. Volleyball became a full varsity sport in 2015–16 (2016 season), competing in the Midwest Collegiate Volleyball League.

<text>Tail o’ the Pup is an iconic Los Angeles, California hot dog stand actually shaped like a hot dog. Built in 1946, the small, walk-up stand has been noted as a prime example of &quot;&quot;programmatic&quot; or &quot;mimetic&quot;&quot; novelty architecture. It was one of the last surviving mid-20th century buildings that were built in the shapes of the products they sold.

==History==
Designed by architect Milton Black, the stand opened at 311 La Cienega Boulevard in June 1946 to luminary-studded, searchlight-lit fanfare. Eddie Blake purchased the Pup in 1976 from its celebrity owners, the dance team of Veloz and Yolanda.

Tail o&#x27; the Pup was featured as a filming location for several television shows and movies including: Columbo, Body Double, The Rockford Files and L.A. Story.

Despite its appearance in countless movies, television programs and commercials, the stand faced demolition in the mid-1980s, creating an outcry that resulted in the stand being moved a couple of blocks from its original location at 311 North La Cienega Boulevard to 329 North San Vicente Boulevard.

The hot dog stand closed in December 2005. The structure was moved into a Torrance warehouse after Regent Properties, a development company, purchased the Pup&#x27;s site from landlord Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and announced plans to build 152 condominium and apartment units.

The City of Los Angeles in 2006 declared Tail o’ the Pup to be a cultural landmark.

Blake&#x27;s grandson Jay Miller and his wife Nicole inherited the Pup in 2017. After a failed attempt to have it reopened in a partnership with Killer Shrimp, the structure was donated to the Valley Relics Museum.

The 1933 Group purchased the structure in 2018 with plans to restore the stand to its original appearance, find a new location, and reopen it.

The stand reopened in July 2022 in West Hollywood.

<doc id="1020842" wikidata="Q2580881" url="?curid=1020842" title="William W. Blackney">
<text>William Wallace Blackney (August 28, 1876 – March 14, 1963) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He served eight terms in the United States House of Representatives.

==Early life and education==
Blackney was born in Clio, Michigan, and attended the public schools there. He went to Olivet College, Olivet, Michigan, and Ferris School (now Ferris State University) in Big Rapids. He moved to Flint, in 1904 and served as county clerk of Genesee County 1905–1912. He was graduated from the law department of the University of Michigan in 1912, was admitted to the bar the same year, and commenced practice in Flint.

He served as assistant prosecuting attorney of Genesee County 1913–1917, member of the Flint School Board 1924–1934, member of the Republican State central committee 1925–1930, and instructor in the General Motors Company technical night school for sixteen years. He was a delegate to the 1932 Republican National Convention.

==Congress==
In 1934, Blackney defeated incumbent Claude E. Cady to be elected as a Republican from Michigan&#x27;s 6th congressional district to the U.S. House for the 74th Congress, serving from January 3, 1935, to January 3, 1937. He lost to Democrat Andrew J. Transue in 1936, but defeated him to be re-elected in 1938 to the 76th Congress. He was subsequently re-elected to the six succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1939, to January 3, 1953.

A report created for President Harry S. Truman in September 1948 claimed that Blackney had a &quot;reactionary record in Congress&quot;.

He was not a candidate for re-election in 1952 and retired to Flint, where he resided until his death, aged 86. He is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in his birthplace of Clio, Michigan.

<doc id="1020847" wikidata="Q54825" url="?curid=1020847" title="DNS zone transfer">
<text>DNS zone transfer, also sometimes known by the inducing DNS query type AXFR, is a type of DNS transaction. It is one of the many mechanisms available for administrators to replicate DNS databases across a set of DNS servers.

A zone transfer uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for transport, and takes the form of a client–server transaction. The client requesting a zone transfer may be a secondary server requesting data from a primary server. The portion of the database that is replicated is a zone.

== Operation ==
Zone transfer consists of a preamble, followed by the actual data transfer. The preamble comprises a lookup of the Start of Authority (SOA) resource record for the &quot;zone apex&quot;, the node of the DNS namespace that is at the top of the &quot;zone&quot;. The fields of this SOA resource record, in particular the &quot;serial number&quot;, determine whether the actual data transfer need to occur at all. The client compares the serial number of the SOA resource record with the serial number in the last copy of that resource record that it has. If the serial number of the record being transferred is greater, the data in the zone are deemed to have &quot;changed&quot; (in some fashion) and the secondary proceeds to request the actual zone data transfer. If the serial numbers are identical, the data in the zone are deemed not to have &quot;changed&quot;, and the client may continue to use the copy of the database that it already has, if it has one.

The actual data transfer process begins by the client sending a query (opcode 0) with the special query type AXFR (value 252) over the TCP connection to the server. Although DNS technically supports AXFR over User Datagram Protocol (UDP), it is considered not acceptable due to the risk of lost, or spoofed packets. The server responds with a series of response messages, comprising all of the resource records for every domain name in the &quot;zone&quot;. The first response comprises the SOA resource record for the zone apex. The other data follows in no specified order. The end of the data is signaled by the server repeating the response containing the SOA resource record for the zone apex.

Some zone transfer clients perform the SOA lookup of the preamble using their system&#x27;s normal DNS query resolution mechanism. These clients do not open a TCP connection to the server until they have determined that they need to perform the actual data transfer. However, since TCP can be used for normal DNS transactions, as well as for zone transfer, other zone transfer clients perform the SOA lookup preamble over the same TCP connection as they then (may) perform the actual data transfer. These clients open the TCP connection to the server before they even perform the preamble.

The preceding describes full zone transfer. Incremental zone transfer differs from full zone transfer in the following respects:
* The client uses the special QTYPE IXFR (value 251) instead of the AXFR QTYPE.
* The client sends the SOA resource record for the zone apex that it currently has, if any, in the IXFR message, letting the server know which version of the &quot;zone&quot; it believes to be current.
* Though the server may respond in the normal AXFR manner with the full data for the zone, it may also instead respond with an &quot;incremental&quot; data transfer. This latter comprises the list of changes to the zone data, in zone serial number order, between the version of the zone that the client reported to the server as having and the version of the zone that is current at the server. The changes comprise two lists, one of resource records that are deleted and one of resource records that are inserted. (A modification to a resource record is represented as a deletion followed by an insertion.)

Zone transfer is entirely client-initiated. Though servers can send a NOTIFY message to clients (that they have been informed about) whenever a change to the zone data has been made, the scheduling of zone transfers is entirely under the control of the clients. Clients schedule zone transfers initially, when their databases are empty, and thereafter at regular intervals, in a pattern controlled by the values in the &quot;refresh&quot;, &quot;retry&quot;, and &quot;expire&quot; fields in the SOA resource record of the zone apex.

==Limitations==
Though it is standardized, full-zone transfer being described as one of the possible database replication mechanisms in RFC 1034 and RFC 5936 (incremental zone transfer described in RFC 1995), zone transfer is the most limited of those database replication mechanisms. Zone transfer operates in terms of &quot;wire format&quot; resource records, &quot;i.e.&quot; resource records as they are transferred using the DNS protocol. However, the schema of wire format resource records may not be identical to the database schema used by the back ends of the DNS servers themselves.

==Operational problems==
===Serial number changes===
The preamble portion of zone transfer relies on the serial number, and &quot;only&quot; the serial number, to determine whether a zone&#x27;s data have changed, and thus whether the actual data transfer is required. For some DNS server packages, the serial numbers of SOA resource records are maintained by administrators by hand. Every edit to the database involves making two changes, one to the record being changed and the other to the zone serial number. The process requires accuracy: the administrator may forget to change the serial number or change it incorrectly (reduce it). RFC 1912 (section 2.2 SOA records) recommends using the value YYYYMMDDnn as the number (YYYY=year, MM=month, DD=day, nn=revision number). This won&#x27;t overflow until the year 4294.

Some DNS server packages have overcome this problem by automatically constructing the serial number from the last modification timestamp of the database file on disk. This is the case for djbdns, for example. The operating system ensures that the last modification timestamp is updated whenever an administrator edits the database file, effectively automatically updating the serial number, and thus relieving administrators of the need to make two edits (in two different places) for every single change.

Furthermore, the paradigm of database replication for which the serial number check (and indeed zone transfer itself) is designed, which involves a single central DNS server holding the primary version of the database with all other DNS servers merely holding copies, simply does not match that of many modern DNS server packages. Modern DNS server packages with sophisticated database back ends such as SQL servers and Active Directory allow administrators to make updates to the database in multiple places (such systems employ multi-master replication), with the database back end&#x27;s own replication mechanism handling the replication to all other servers. This paradigm simply does not match that of a single, central, monotonically increasing number to record changes, and thus is incompatible with zone transfer to a large extent. Modern DNS server packages with sophisticated database back ends often will create a &quot;shim&quot; serial number, simulating the existence of a single central place where updates are made, but this is at best imperfect.

Fortunately, for this and several reasons outlined later, DNS servers that use such sophisticated database back ends in general rarely use zone transfer as their database replication mechanism in the first place, and usually instead employ the vastly superior distributed database replication mechanisms that the back ends themselves provide.

===Serial number comparisons===
Serial number comparisons are intended to use Serial Number Arithmetic as defined in RFC 1982. However, this was not clearly specified in RFC 1034, resulting in not all clients perform the serial number check, in the preamble, in the same way. Some clients check merely that the serial number supplied by the server is different from that known by the client, or non-zero. Other clients check that the serial number supplied by the server is within a given range of the serial number already known by the client. Yet other clients still perform the latter check and additionally check that the serial number supplied by the server is not zero.

===Multiple resource records===
Originally, in the actual data transfer each set of resource records for a single domain name and type was transferred in a separate response message from the server to the client. However, this is inefficient, and some DNS server software implemented optimizations, geared at allowing the response compression mechanism in the DNS protocol to reduce the total bandwidth requirements of data transfers, such as:
* performing &quot;additional section processing&quot; to include any &quot;glue&quot; resource record sets in the same response as an NS, SRV, or MX resource record set
* collecting all of the resource record sets relating to a single domain name together and sending them, if they fit, in a single response

Some clients were written to expect &quot;only&quot; the original response format, and would fail to perform data transfer if such optimizations were employed. Several DNS server packages thus have a configuration setting allowing administrators to specify the use of &quot;single answer format&quot; responses for those clients that require it.

===Exposure of data===
The data contained in a DNS zone may be sensitive from an operational security aspect. This is because information such as server hostnames may become public knowledge, which can be used to discover information about an organization and even provide a larger attack surface. In June 2017 the registrar responsible for Russian top-level-domains accidentally enabled DNS zone transfers via AXFR which led to 5.6 million records being accidentally exposed.

In 2008 a court in North Dakota, USA, ruled that performing a zone transfer as an unauthorized outsider to obtain information that was not publicly accessible constitutes a violation of North Dakota law.

== Modern Era ==

*c. 1485 – c. 1513
**Leonardo da Vinci designs an ornithopter with control surfaces. He envisions and sketches flying machines such as helicopters and parachutes, and notes studies of airflows and streamlined shapes.
*c. 1500
**Hieronymus Bosch shows in his triptych The temptation of St. Anthony, among other things, two fighting airships above a burning town.
*c. 1558
**Giambattista della Porta publishes a theory and a construction manual for a kite.
*1595
**Fausto Veranzino illustrates a design for a parachute in his book &quot;Machinae novae&quot; (New machines). His &quot;homo volans&quot; (Flying man) design is based on the sail of a ship.
*1630
**Evliya Çelebi reports that Hezarfen Ahmet Celebi glided with artificial wings from the top of Galata Tower in Istanbul and managed to fly over the Bosphorus, landing successfully on the Doğancılar square in Üsküdar.
*1633
**Evliya Çelebi reports that Lagari Hasan Çelebi flew himself in a rocket artificially-powered by gunpowder.
*1638
**John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester, suggests some ideas to future would-be pilots in his book &quot;The Discovery of a World in the Moon&quot;.
*1644
**Italian physicist Evangelista Torricelli manages to demonstrate atmospheric pressure, and also produces a vacuum.
*1654
**Physicist and mayor of Magdeburg, Otto von Guericke measures the weight of air and demonstrates his famous &quot;Magdeburger Halbkugeln&quot; (hemispheres of Magdeburg).Sixteen horses are unable to pull apart two completely airless hemispheres which stick to each other only because of the external air pressure.
*1670
**Jesuit Father Francesco Lana de Terzi describes in his treatise &quot;Prodomo&quot; a vacuum-airship-project, considered the first realistic, technical plan for an airship. His design is for an aircraft with a boat-like body equipped with a sail, suspended under four globes made of thin copper; he believes the craft would rise into the sky if air was pumped out of the globes. No example is built, and de Terzi writes: &quot;God will never allow that such a machine be built…because everybody realises that no city would be safe from raids…&quot;
*1679
** Italian physicist Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, the father of biomechanics, shows in his treatise &quot;On the movements of animals&quot; that the flapping of wings with the muscle power of the human arm cannot successfully produce flight.
*1687
**Isaac Newton (1642–1727) publishes his &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, the basis of classical physics. In book II he presented the theoretical derivation of the essence of the drag equation.

<text>Frederick Seidel (born February 19, 1936) is an American poet.

==Biography==
Seidel was born to a family of Russian Jewish descent in St. Louis, Missouri in 1936. His family owned Seidel Coal and Coke, which supplied coal to the brewing industry in St. Louis, as well as a West Virginia mine. Seidel graduated from St. Louis Country Day School and earned his A.B. at Harvard University in 1957. Archibald MacLeish arranged for Seidel to take a leave of absence from Harvard so he could travel around Europe. In Europe Seidel spent time in Paris (where he took a virtual vow of silence for three months) and visited Oxford and Cambridge in England, where he met T. S. Eliot in London.

Seidel corresponded with Ezra Pound in his youth and visited Pound at St. Elizabeths Hospital. Despite not understanding the Chinese language, Seidel suggested corrections to Pound&#x27;s translations of Confucius, &quot;The Unwobbling Pivot&quot;, which Pound accepted. After university Seidel moved with his wife to West Gloucester, Massachusetts, and then to Paris after Seidel became the Parisian editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; in 1961. He lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City.

==Career==
In 1962, his first book, &quot;Final Solutions&quot;, was chosen by a jury of Louise Bogan, Stanley Kunitz, and Robert Lowell for an award sponsored by the 92nd Street Y, with a $1,500 prize. However, both the association and the publisher rejected the manuscript for several reasons, one of which was that, in their opinion, &quot;matter in one of the poems libeled a noted living person&quot;.
Another was that the national head of the YMHA/YWHA expressed concern that some of the poems were &quot;anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic&quot;, claims Seidel considered preposterous. When Seidel refused to make requested changes to his work, the prize was withdrawn and the promise of publication revoked. Bogan, Kunitz, and Lowell also resigned in protest.

This incident, in which Seidel&#x27;s poetry offended readers, was a defining moment in his career, and one that he would repeat in subsequent books by consciously trying to offend—or at least, to shock—his readers (although none of his subsequent books caused anywhere near the same degree of controversy as his first).
Random House published the book the following year, but seventeen years would pass before Seidel published another work. His second book, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, was the 1980 Lamont Poetry Selection. His book &quot;Going Fast&quot; was a finalist for the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.

His collection, &quot;The Cosmos Poems&quot;, was commissioned by the American Museum of Natural History to celebrate the opening of the new Hayden Planetarium in 2000, and he won the PEN/Voelcker Award for Poetry in 2002. His collection &quot;Ooga-Booga&quot; was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and was shortlisted for the 2007 International Griffin Poetry Prize. A limited run of his collection of new verse, &quot;Evening Man&quot; was published in 2008. The following year saw the publication of the career-spanning anthology &quot;Poems: 1959–2009&quot;.

In 2016, Farrar, Straus and Giroux published his sixteenth and most recent collection of poems, &quot;Widening Income Equality.&quot; One of the poems in this collection, &quot;The Ballad of Ferguson, Missouri&quot;, a response to the police shooting of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, that was originally published in the November 25, 2014 edition of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, sparked controversy online and on social media. That same year, Seidel received &quot;The Paris Review&#x27;s&quot; Hadada Award, given for &quot;a distinguished member of the writing community who has made a strong and unique contribution to literature.&quot;

==Style==
In response to the publication of his &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Wyatt Mason wrote a long piece on the poet, titled &quot;Laureate of the Louche&quot;.
 New York Times book reviewer David Orr, in his review of &quot;Poems: 1959-2009&quot;, wrote, &quot;[Seidel is] one of poetry&#x27;s few scary characters.&quot; Seidel is frequently characterized as such, in part because in his writing he often makes use of violent and disturbing sexual imagery and presents himself as a rather unlikeable aesthete who embraces his own &quot;elite&quot; brand of materialism (extolling, for instance, his love of Ducati motorcycles and handmade shoes). However, Seidel often ironizes this persona, pushing it to cartoonish extremes.

Seidel&#x27;s poetry comprises more than his outrageous poetic persona. He also writes poems that comment on contemporary events and are political/satirical (as is his poem &quot;Bush&#x27;s War&quot;). His work is also notable in that he frequently makes use of rhyme and meter (both regular and irregular), including nursery rhyme-influenced references, repetitions and rhythms. One of Seidel&#x27;s earliest influences was Robert Lowell. Seidel has stated, &quot;The influence of Lowell [on my first book &quot;Final Solutions&quot; was] unmistakable.&quot; However, the critic Richard Poirier noted that Seidel had broken free of this influence by the time he published his second book, &quot;Sunrise&quot;.

<doc id="1020867" wikidata="Q2382975" url="?curid=1020867" title="Shawangunk Ridge">
<text>The Shawangunk Ridge , also known as the Shawangunk Mountains or The Gunks, is a ridge of bedrock in Ulster County, Sullivan County and Orange County in the state of New York, extending from the northernmost point of the border with New Jersey to the Catskills. The Shawangunk Ridge is a continuation of the long, easternmost section of the Appalachian Mountains; the ridge is known as Kittatinny Mountain in New Jersey, and as Blue Mountain as it continues through Pennsylvania. This ridge constitutes the western border of the Great Appalachian Valley. 
The ridgetop, which widens considerably at its northern end, has many public and private protected areas, including Wurtsboro Ridge State Forest, Shawangunk Ridge State Forest, Minnewaska State Park Preserve, Witch&#x27;s Hole State Park and Mohonk Preserve. The ridge is not heavily populated; its only settlement of consequence is the hamlet of Cragsmoor. In the past, the ridge was chiefly noted for mining and logging and a boom-era of huckleberry picking. Fires were regularly set to burn away the undergrowth and stimulate new growth of huckleberry bushes.

Today the ridge has become known for its outdoor recreation, most notably as one of the major rock climbing areas of North America, with many guides offering rock climbing trips in the area. Also known for its biodiversity and scenic character, the ridge has been designated by The Nature Conservancy as a significant area for its conservation programs.

==Etymology==
The English name, Shawangunk, derives from the Dutch &quot;Scha-wan-gunk,&quot; the closest European transcription from the colonial deed record of the Munsee Lenape, Schawankunk (German orthography).

Lenape linguist Raymond Whritenour reports that &quot;schawan&quot; is an inanimate intransitive verb meaning &quot;it is smoky air&quot; or &quot;there is smoky air&quot;. Its noun-like participle is &quot;schawank,&quot; meaning &quot;that which is smoky air&quot;. Adding the locative suffix gives us &quot;schawangunk&quot; &quot;in the smoky air&quot;.

Whritenour has suggested that the name derives from the burning of a Munsee fort by the Dutch at the eastern base of the ridge in 1663 (a massacre ending the Second Esopus War). Use of the name spread quickly, and it was recorded in numerous land deeds and patents after the war. Historian Marc B. Fried writes:

It is conceivable that this was...the Indians&#x27; own proper name for their village [and fort] and that the name was appropriated for use in subsequent land dealings because of the proximity of the...tracts to the former Indian village...The second possibility is that the name simply came into existence in connection with the Bruyn [purchase of Jan., 1682, the first appearance of the name in documentary record], as a phrase invented by the Indians to describe some feature of the landscape.

Fried also notes that the name&#x27;s swift spread in the deed record suggests it was in use as a proper name before the Bruyn purchase. Shawangunk appears nowhere in reference to the fort in the extensive, translated Dutch record of the Second Esopus War. Shawangunk became associated with the ridge during the 18th century.

In the original Lenape, the word is tri-syllabic, Sha-wan-gun, although in an occasional 18th-century deed it is written with a fourth syllable. The correct pronunciation approximates sha (short a) - wan (as in want) - goon (as in book). The trailing k is sub vocal and modifies the sound of the n.
European colonists began to truncate Shawangunk into &quot;Shongum&quot; ( ). Shongum was mistakenly identified as the Munsee pronunciation by the Reverend Charles Scott writing on Shawangunk&#x27;s etymology for the Ulster County Historical Society in 1861. The error has been reinforced in ethnographic sources and ridge literature, and by historians, librarians, and ridge educators for more than 140 years.

Both &quot;Shawangunk&quot; and &quot;Shongum&quot; are popular usages among locals native to the region. The &quot;Gunks&quot; is also a widely used familiar term for the ridge and has been in use at least since the mid-19th century. In a letter dated August and postmarked August 8, 1838, Hudson River School painter Thomas Cole corresponding with painter A.B. Durand writes, &quot;Do let me hear from you when you get among &quot;the Gunks&quot;. I hope you will find every thing there your heart can wish.&quot; The Shawangunks, particularly around Lake Mohonk, were the subject for several Hudson River School painters.

==Geography==
The Shawangunk Ridge is the northern end of a long ridge within the Appalachian Mountains that begins in Virginia, where it is called North Mountain, continues through Pennsylvania as Blue Mountain, becomes known as the Kittatinny Mountains after it crosses the Delaware Water Gap into New Jersey and becomes the Shawangunks at the New York state line. These mountains mark the western and northern edge of the Great Appalachian Valley.

The ridge is widest () near the northern end and narrow in the middle (), with a maximum elevation of near Lake Maratanza. The ridge rises above a broad, high plain which stretches to the Hudson River to the east. On the west the low foothills of the Appalachian Mountains mingle with a low flat made by the Rondout Creek and Sandburgh Creek, the Basha Kill and various small kills, as well as the Neversink River and Delaware River at the southern end. These adjacent valleys are underlain by relatively weak sedimentary rock (e.g., sandstone, shale, limestone).

==Natural environment==

There is an unusual diversity of vegetation on the ridge, containing species typically found north of this region alongside species typically found to the south or restricted to the Coastal Plain. The results is an area where many regionally rare plants are found at or near the limits of their ranges. Other rare species found in the area are those adapted to the harsh conditions on the ridge. Upland communities include chestnut oak and mixed-oak forest, pine barrens including dwarf pine ridges, hemlock-northern hardwood forest, and cliff and talus slope and cave communities. Wetlands include small lakes and streams, bogs, pitch pine-blueberry peat swamps, an inland Atlantic white cypress swamp, red maple swamps, acidic seeps, calcareous seeps, and a few emergent marshes.

==Geology==
The ridge is primarily Shawangunk Conglomerate, a hard, silica-cemented sedimentary conglomerate of white quartz pebbles and sandstone that directly overlies the Martinsburg Formation, a thick sequence of turbidite deposits of dark gray shale and greywacke. The Martinsburg Formation was deposited in a deep ocean basin during the Ordovician (470 million years ago). The Shawangunk Conglomerate was deposited over the Martinsburg Formation in thick braided river deposits during the Silurian (about 420 million years ago); both sequences of sedimentary rock were subsequently deformed in a continental collision associated during the assembly of the Pangean supercontinent during the Permian (about 270 million years ago). This collision deformed strata within the ridge in a northward plunging series of asymmetric folds (e.g., anticlines and synclines) that are inclined gently westward. These same folds, involving strata that overlie the Shawangunk Conglomerate, are exposed north of Shawangunk Ridge in the Rosendale Natural Cement Region, where they can be directly examined in abandoned mines. Strata along the eastern margin of Shawangunk Ridge are truncated by erosion, resulting in the prominent cliffs characteristic of Shawangunk Ridge. The Shawangunk Conglomerate is very hard and resistant to weathering; whereas the underlying shale erodes relatively easily. Thus, the quartz conglomerate forms cliffs and talus slopes, particularly along the eastern margin of the ridge.

The entire ridge was glaciated during the last Wisconsin glaciation, which scoured the ridges, left pockets of till, and dumped talus (blocks of rock) off the east side of the ridge. On top of the ridge, the soils are generally thin, highly acidic, low in nutrients, and droughty, but in depressions and other areas where water is trapped by the bedrock or till, there are interspersed lakes and wetland areas. Soils on top of shale are thicker, less acidic, and more fertile. Topography on the top of the northern Shawangunks is irregular due to a series of faults that form secondary plateaus and escarpments.

==Ice caves==
Ice caves are deep fissures in the conglomerate bedrock that retain ice through much of the summer, resulting in a cool microenvironment that supports several northern species such as black spruce, hemlock, rowan, and creeping snowberry (Gaultheria hispidula), and bryophytes such as Isopterygium distichaceum. These ice caves are concentrated near Sam&#x27;s Point in the northern Shawangunks. Larger limestone caverns occur along the lower slopes of the Rondout and Delaware River valleys.

==Lakes==
Lakes and wetlands occur mostly on the flat-topped ridges at the northern and southern ends of the area and, to a lesser extent, along the western side of the middle part of the ridge. Lakes and ponds occurring on conglomerates tend to be clear, nutrient-poor, and very acidic, due to the limited buffering capacity of the bedrock. The northern Shawangunks have five lakes, the &quot;sky lakes,&quot; which are, from north to south: Mohonk Lake, Lake Minnewaska, Lake Awosting, Mud Pond, and Lake Maratanza. The pH in four of the lakes averages about 4 (acidic); Lake Mohonk, which partially overlays shale bedrock and is therefore partially buffered, is closer to neutral pH (7.0).

==Public lands and preserves==

The Shawangunks contain mainly public lands as well as several small residential areas. A large portion of the northern Ridge is protected by Minnewaska State Park Preserve, which also now manages Sam&#x27;s Point Preserve with more than of hiking trails and several climbing areas. Established in 1963, the Mohonk Preserve protects and manages over 8,000 acres of the Shawangunk Ridge, including the world-renowned Trapps climbing cliffs, and features over 70 miles of historic carriage roads and trails. In 2007 Shawangunk Ridge State Forest and Witches Hole State Forest were added. The Long Path long-distance hiking trail follows the ridge from Sullivan County to the vicinity of Kerhonkson; south of it the Shawangunk Ridge Trail connects to the Appalachian Trail near High Point. There are several old carriage trails on the Ridge including; Smiley Road from Ellenville into Minnewaska State Park Preserve; and Old Plank Road and Old Mountain Road in Shawangunk Ridge State Forest. Many of the foot trails are updated and maintained by the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference.

There are also many waterfalls in the Shawangunk region, such as: VerKeerderkill Falls, Awosting Falls, and Vernooy Kill Falls.

In 2004, a luxury development plan for buildings has threatened the ridge line, and as a result a grassroots &quot;Save the Ridge&quot; campaign has become extremely popular in the area. In 2006 a court ordered the sale of property by the private owner to settle a case brought on by the developer. The Open Space Institute of NY purchased the land and has signed it over to Minnewaska State Park Preserve.

The Trust for Public Land and Open Space Institute actually agreed to purchase the land for $17 million. At closing, however, the contract was assigned and title was taken in the name of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, a federally chartered commission, although the funds for the purchase apparently came from the New York state Environmental Protection Fund.

Unlike the major public land holdings on the Shawangunk Ridge, the Mohonk Preserve is a private land trust requiring a day fee depending on use.

===Unit Management Plan===

In May 2007 the state Department of Environmental Conservation initiated the development of its Shawangunk Ridge Unit Management Plan to include &quot;Shawangunk Multiple Use Area&quot;, &quot;Witch&#x27;s Hole State Forest&quot;, &quot;Shawangunk Ridge State Forest&quot;, &quot;Roosa Gap State Forest&quot;, &quot;Wurtsboro Ridge State Forest&quot;, &quot;Huckleberry Ridge State Forest&quot;, and three detached &quot;Forest Preserve&quot; parcels.

The goal of the project was to develop &quot;management objectives&quot; for the properties, including those concerning permissible forms of public recreation and access.

Following an announcement of the project&#x27;s launch, no further statements had been issued by the DEC regarding its work as of June 2009.

==Recreation==

=== Hiking ===
The Shawangunk Ridge Trail heads north approximately , to Sam&#x27;s Point Preserve in New York from the Appalachian Trail at High Point State Park in New Jersey. It generally follows the spectacular Shawangunk Ridge north, occasionally using abandoned roads and rail beds. The New York/New Jersey Trail Conference lists seventeen recommended hikes on the Ridge.

=== Other recreational activities ===
The development of rock climbing in the Shawangunks is attributed to Fritz Wiessner and Hans Kraus, pioneers of modern rock climbing. It has historically been centered around four major cliffs: &quot;Millbrook&quot;, the &quot;Near Trapps&quot;, &quot;The Trapps&quot;, and &quot;Skytop&quot;. Of these four, The Trapps, is the longest, the most popular and most accessible, with the largest number of climbing routes. The Near Trapps is located immediately across Route 44/55 from The Trapps, and is second in popularity. Millbrook Mountain, the highest and most southerly cliff, is the most remote, and sees the least climbing activity. The Skytop cliff is owned by the Mohonk Mountain House and rock climbing requires authorized guides. Rock climbing is also permitted on the Peterskill and Dickie Barre cliff areas of Minnewaska State Park Preserve. The height of the cliff varies along the ridgeline, to a maximum of some .

==Fire lookout towers==
===Graham tower===
In 1930, the Conservation Department built a Aermotor LS40 steel fire lookout tower and observers cabin on Sayers Hill (Pocatello Mountain). The tower was purchased with funds provided from the county and town, to protect the eastern and southern slopes of the Shawangunk Ridge. The tower was dismantled and moved to its current location in 1948. The tower ceased fire lookout operations at the end of the 1988 fire lookout season. It was officially closed in early 1989 by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The Graham Lookout Tower is listed on the National Historic Lookout Register. The tower remains, but both it and the surrounding area are closed to the public.

===High Point tower===
In 1912, the Conservation Commission built a wood fire lookout tower on the ridge east of Ellenville on High Point. In 1919, the Conservation Commission replaced it with a Aermotor LS40 steel fire lookout tower. Due to increased use of aerial detection, the tower ceased fire lookout operation at the end of the 1971 fire lookout season, and was later removed.

===Roosa Gap tower===
In 1948, the Conservation Department built a Aermotor steel fire lookout tower on the ridge northeast of Wurtsboro. Due to increased use of aerial detection, the tower ceased fire lookout operations at the end of the 1972 fire lookout season. The tower was later sold, and is now closed to the public.

<text>John Henry Rutherford (; born September 2, 1952) is an American politician and former law enforcement officer serving as the U.S. representative from Florida&#x27;s 5th congressional district since 2017. A member of the Republican Party, his district encompasses southeast Jacksonville and all of St. Johns County.

Rutherford was an officer with the Jacksonville Sheriff&#x27;s Office for four decades, before being elected Duval County sheriff in 2003; he remained in that post until 2015. In 2016, he ran for the House of Representatives in what was at the time Florida&#x27;s 4th congressional district. He won the election and was reelected in 2018, 2020, and 2022.
==Early life and education==

John Rutherford was born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1952. His father was in the U.S. Navy and was serving in Korea at the time of his son&#x27;s birth. In the 1950s, Rutherford&#x27;s family moved to Jacksonville, Florida. He graduated from Nathan Bedford Forest High School in 1970. He surfed in his free time. In 1972, he earned his Associate of Science in criminology from Florida State College at Jacksonville, formerly Florida Junior College, followed by his Bachelor of Science in criminology from Florida State University in 1974.

==Jacksonville Sheriff&#x27;s Office==

Rutherford spent 41 years at the Jacksonville Sheriff&#x27;s Office, first as a sheriff&#x27;s deputy and for the final 12 years as the elected sheriff. He joined the Jacksonville Sheriff&#x27;s Office in 1974 as a patrolman. He was promoted to sergeant in 1980 and ultimately rose to the rank of captain. At various points, he commanded the Arson and Burglary divisions, led the Police Academy, and led patrol units on the Southside. He was also Chief of Services, Traffic and Special Operations, and Chief of Patrol. He was appointed director of corrections in 1995 by then-Sheriff Nat Glover. In that role, he was responsible for overseeing the jail.

Rutherford ran for Jacksonville Sheriff in 2003. A candidate for the Jacksonville City Council filed a complaint against Rutherford in February, alleging violations of the Federal Hatch Act of 1939, which prohibits employees working for federally funded agencies from running for office in partisan elections. Rutherford said that a lawyer had told him there was no conflict, but he retired in March 2003 anyway, in order to remove any doubt, with 28 years of service.

The &quot;Florida Times-Union&quot; reported in 2015, &quot;Supporters and even those who criticize him say Rutherford has been steadfast and unwavering in his faith and his convictions as a lawman, a trait some say has brought success while others say is to his detriment.&quot; Rutherford&#x27;s tenure was marked by rises and falls in crime: from 2002 to 2005, Jacksonville suffered an increase in murder and other violent crime; murders briefly declined in 2005, but then rose again each year until 2008, when another decline began. In 2007, the &quot;Florida Times-Union&quot; endorsed Rutherford for reelection—saying that he was generally moving his department &quot;in a positive direction&quot;—but criticized the pace and inadequacies of key initiatives, such as reducing the murder rate, tackling illegal guns, and initiating a management audit. Overall, the Jacksonville crime rate was about the same at the beginning and end of Rutherford&#x27;s tenure.

As sheriff, Rutherford was a staunch critic of State Attorney Harry Shorstein and an ally of his successor, Angela Corey. He was credited with improving the sheriff&#x27;s department&#x27;s capacities to deal with mental health matters and his oversight of a prisoner reentry program, but was criticized for enduring tensions and a lack of trust between the local African American community and police, as well as a high number of police shootings by the Jacksonville Sheriff&#x27;s Office. According to a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; report, Jacksonville had the ninth-highest rate of justifiable homicides among the U.S.&#x27;s 105 largest police department efforts between 2007 and 2012.

After initially considering a run for the state House, Rutherford announced his candidacy for Florida&#x27;s 4th congressional district on April 15, 2016, for the open seat created by the retirement of the Republican incumbent, Ander Crenshaw. Originally he announced he would run for Florida&#x27;s 6th congressional district in 2015. Because the 4th district is a Republican safe seat, Rutherford was heavily favored in each election.

In the August 2016 Republican primary, Rutherford faced State Representative Lake Ray, St. Johns County Commissioner Bill McClure and former St. Johns Water Management District executive director Hans Tanzler III. Rutherford won the nomination with 38.7% of the vote, to Ray&#x27;s 20.1%, Tanzler&#x27;s 19.0%, and McClure&#x27;s 9.8%. In the general election, Rutherford defeated Democratic nominee David Bruderly, 70.2% to 27.6%.

==== 2018 ====
In 2018, Rutherford was challenged by Democratic nominee Ges Selmont, a Ponte Vedra Beach attorney. He was reelected, 65.2% to 32.4%.

==== 2020 ====
In 2020, Rutherford won re-nomination in a low-key Republican primary, defeating retired Navy chief petty officer Erick Aguilar with 80.2% of the vote to Aguilar&#x27;s 19.8%. In the general election, Rutherford defeated Democratic nominee Donna Deegan, a former local TV anchor and breast cancer awareness advocate, 61.1% to 38.9%.

==== 2022 ====
Rutherford won the Republican primary with 65.6% of the vote. He was uncontested in the general election.

==== 2024 ====
Rutherford ran for re-election in 2024.

===Tenure===
On January 11, 2017, Rutherford collapsed on the floor of the House, in what his staffers described as an &quot;acute digestive flareup&quot;; he was taken to the hospital, and released ten days later.

===Committee assignments===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Homeland Security
** Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies
* Committee on Ethics

=== Caucus memberships ===
* Republican Main Street Partnership
* Republican Governance Group

* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus
* Congressional Coalition on Adoption
* Rare Disease Caucus

===Investigation===
In February 2021, Rutherford joined the House Committee on Ethics. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) board filed a February 2022 report stating that there was &quot;substantial reason to believe&quot; Rutherford had not filed timely disclosure reports as required by federal law and House rules. The House Committee on Ethics released a report on May 31, 2022, indicating that it was investigating one of its members over repeated reporting violations of the STOCK Act, enacted in 2012 to prevent insider trading using non-public information by members of Congress and other government employees. Members of Congress are required to report any stock transaction over $1,000 within 45 days. Violations are subject to a $200 fine. Between January 2017 and December 2021, Rutherford had 157 late reports involving trades worth between $652,000 and $3.5 million. Most were from his first term, but the violations continued thereafter. The OCE report noted an $800 fine payment in November 2021 but asked whether Rutherford had been &quot;properly penalized for his repeated violations of federal law and House rules&quot;. The OCE report also said that Rutherford and Jen Bailey, his chief of staff, were uncooperative by refusing to meet and answer questions. The fine for 157 violations would be $31,400. During his time in Congress, Rutherford had &quot;several trainings on his disclosure obligations&quot; for reporting stock transactions, according to the OCE report.

Rutherford initially contended that the stock trades are made by the manager of his IRA, so he should have been exempt from the reporting requirements. One of his lawyers, Kate Belinski, sent the OCE a letter on March 18, 2022, insisting that the late reports were &quot;an entirely inadvertent oversight&quot; based on a &quot;simple misunderstanding of the requirements&quot;. She wrote that Rutherford had cooperated by providing the documents OCE requested. Belinski also claimed that Rutherford has a new system to track and file STOCK transactions. Rutherford said, &quot;Everything is done, as far as I know. I paid the fine that they asked for, and I&#x27;m done with it.&quot;

== Political positions ==
Rutherford aligned himself with President Donald Trump, voting in line with Trump&#x27;s position 96.6% of the time. He voted against a majority of fellow Republicans approximately 3.9% of the time.

===Gun policy===
In 2017, Rutherford signed a letter to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives expressing his support for legislation to ban bump stocks.

From 2015 to 2016, Rutherford received $1,000 in campaign donations from the NRA Political Victory Fund.

In 2018, Rutherford sponsored a bill, the STOP (Students, Teachers, and Officers Preventing) School Violence Act, that authorized $50 million a year to create a federal grant program &quot;to train students, teachers and law enforcement on how to spot and report signs of gun violence&quot;; the House approved the bill, 407–10. The bill authorized funding for the development of &quot;anonymous telephone and online systems where people could report threats of violence&quot; and $25 million for schools to &quot;improve and harden their security, such as installing new locks, lights, metal detectors and panic buttons.&quot; A separate spending bill would be required to provide money for the grant program; Rutherford sought to include such funding as part of an omnibus spending bill.

=== Environment ===
In interviews in 2016 and 2019, he acknowledged the existence of climate change but questioned the scientific consensus that human activity has caused the increase in warming. Rutherford has expressed concern over sea level rise, which would adversely impact St. Augustine. He has criticized the Green New Deal proposal as a &quot;socialist manifesto&quot;.

Rutherford and Representative Jeff Van Drew introduced the Atlantic Coastal Economies Protection Act, which would prohibit seismic air gun testing in the Atlantic Ocean. In 2019, in a break with Trump&#x27;s position, Rutherford voted in favor of legislation to ban offshore drilling along the Atlantic coast, Pacific coast, and eastern Gulf of Mexico coast. In 2019, he introduced bipartisan legislation (cosponsored by eight Florida Democrats and nine Florida Republicans) to extend a moratorium on oil and gas drilling in federal waters off Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast until 2029, and to create a similar moratorium on offshore drilling in federal waters off Florida&#x27;s South Atlantic coast and in the Straits of Florida.

===Health care===
Rutherford supported the unsuccessful 2017 effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In 2021, he sponsored legislation seeking to block the government from asking passengers on domestic flights whether they had been vaccinated against COVID-19.

=== LGBT rights ===
Rutherford voted against the Equality Act in 2019 and 2021.

===Policing and criminal justice===
Being one of two former sheriffs in Congress, Rutherford is &quot;skeptical&quot; of shorter prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenses. During his campaign for Congress, he called Black Lives Matter a &quot;hate group&quot;.

Rutherford opposes capital punishment, citing his Catholic faith.

=== Economy, trade, and taxation===

Rutherford voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, a measure he praised as good for the economy.

===Foreign and military policy===

Rutherford&#x27;s district includes two major U.S. Navy bases (Naval Air Station Jacksonville and Naval Station Mayport), and he has pressed issues important to the bases. Like other members of Florida&#x27;s delegation, he pressed for two squadrons of the F-35 Lightning II to be based in Jacksonville.

===Donald Trump===
Rutherford defended some of Trump&#x27;s most controversial statements and actions as president, including his pardon of ex-sheriff Joe Arpaio and his comments after a deadly far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Rutherford voted against both Trump&#x27;s first impeachment (in 2019, on articles of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power) and his second impeachment (in 2021, on an article of incitement of insurrection).

====Effort to overturn 2020 election result====

Rutherford refused to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Trump lost to Joe Biden. He echoed Trump&#x27;s claims of election fraud and suggested that Republican-controlled state legislatures in swing states Biden won could hold a &quot;decertification vote&quot; that would lead to the U.S. House selecting the next president, though he acknowledged that this was unlikely to succeed. On January 7, 2021, after the Capitol was attacked by a pro-Trump mob in an attempted insurrection, Rutherford was one of 138 House Republicans who voted not to count the electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania, despite a number of audits and recounts confirming the election outcome in those states.

In December 2020, Rutherford was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the U.S. Supreme Court that sought to overturn the election results. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

After Trump was impeached for his role in inciting a pro-Trump mob to storm the Capitol over false claims of election fraud, Rutherford condemned Representative Liz Cheney for voting to impeach Trump, accusing her of not being a &quot;team player.&quot;

===Immigration===
In 2018, Rutherford defended the Trump administration policy of separating parents and children at the U.S.-Mexico border, and opposed legislation that would end the practice. After coming under pressure, Trump reversed his policy, a move Rutherford welcomed.

In 2017, Rutherford introduced legislation to create a path to citizenship for holders of E-2 Treaty Investor Visas, a special visa for business owners.

===Social issues===
Rutherford opposes abortion. In interviews in 2015, he contended that the U.S. had a &quot;culture of death&quot; he attributed to &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and violent video games and movies.

Rutherford opposes the legalization of marijuana. He voted against the 2014 ballot initiative to legal medicinal marijuana in Florida, believing that it would ultimately lead to the legalization of recreational marijuana and to marijuana &quot;in every backpack in every high school in Duval County.&quot;

===Other===
Rutherford has supported the use of earmarks and has called for the elimination or restriction of the U.S. Senate rule that requires 60 Senate votes to invoke cloture (i.e., end debate on bills); he described both proposals as a way to facilitate compromise between the parties and reduce gridlock. Rutherford has said that he supports local referendums to resolve disputes over the fate of public Confederate monuments.

==Elections==
Rutherford campaigned for Duval County sheriff, running against fellow Republicans David Anderson and Lem Sharp. In the election on April 15, 2003, he received 135,038 votes, 78% of the total. He took office on July 1, 2003. Rutherford was reelected in 2007 and 2011.

On August 30, 2016, he won the Republican primary for Florida&#x27;s 4th Congressional District.




==Personal life==
Rutherford is married to his wife, Patricia, and has two children and six grandchildren. He and his wife are Catholic.

<doc id="1020874" wikidata="Q5918148" url="?curid=1020874" title="Allan B. Calhamer">
<text>Allan Brian Calhamer (December 7, 1931 – February 25, 2013) was an American board game designer, best known for his game &quot;Diplomacy&quot;.

==Career==
Calhamer speculated that his original inspiration for &quot;Diplomacy&quot; was an article in &quot;Life&quot; magazine about the Congress of Vienna he read in 1945 at age 13. Gordon Leavitt, a childhood friend of Calhamer&#x27;s recounted how, when they were boys in La Grange Park, Illinois, he and Calhamer &quot;discovered in the attic a geography book that showed a map of Europe before World War I with the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the old boundaries.&quot; Calhamer received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Harvard University in 1953, then began at Harvard Law School. Reading &quot;The Origins of the World War&quot; by professor Sidney Bradshaw Fay, whose class he attended, finally galvanized Calhamer. In 1954, while still enrolled, he developed a game of strategy and alliances that put seven players in control of the major powers of the pre-World War I era. He quit law school after one year, and Sylvania&#x27;s Applied Research Laboratory in Waltham, Massachusetts hired him as a systems analyst. He also worked as tour guide for the Statue of Liberty during this period.

In 1959, Calhamer published his game as &quot;Diplomacy&quot; and printed 500 copies. After selling all of them in six months, he licensed the game to a publisher, with Games Research releasing its first edition in 1961. Over the years, &quot;Diplomacy&quot; has been published in North America by Games Research, Avalon Hill, Hasbro, and Renegade Game Studios, and has been published in several different languages in other nations by various publishers. Calhamer&#x27;s original face-to-face board game has also been played by mail since 1963. More recently, there are internet &quot;Diplomacy&quot; games, games run through email or online with or without a human game master. Calhamer later invented two other games, but neither achieved anything like the success of &quot;Diplomacy&quot;.

Calhamer wrote a book, &quot;Calhamer on Diplomacy: The Boardgame &quot;Diplomacy&quot; and Diplomatic History&quot;, but the game did not provide him with a living. In the 1990s he retired from working as a mail carrier and lived his last years in La Grange Park.

Calhamer also published a game of four-dimensional exploration, called &quot;Hyper-Space.&quot; The instructions are at the Internet Archive.

==Legacy==
Calhamer died of heart and kidney failure on February 25, 2013, at Adventist-La Grange Memorial Hospital in La Grange, Illinois. Mike Webb, vice president of marketing and data services for Alliance Game Distributors, said in a posthumous interview, &quot;In many ways, the hobby-game industry as we know it owes its existence to Allan Calhamer&quot; thanks to &quot;Diplomacy&quot;&#x27;s numerous gameplay innovations, specifically the ability to negotiate and deceive other players.

==Personal life==
Calhamer met his future wife, Hilda Morales, in New York. The couple were married 45 years and had two daughters together, Tatiana and Selenne.

** French artist and farmer Louis Pierre Mouillard makes a tentative gliding flight. After years of studies of bird flight he publishes his book &quot;L&#x27;Empire de l&#x27;Air&quot; in 1881. He thinks that imitation of gliding and soaring flight of birds is possible, but not the imitation of the flapping of wings.

==Early life==

Amanda Michelle Seyfried was born on December 3, 1985, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Her mother, Ann Seyfried (née Sander) is an occupational therapist, and her father, Jack Seyfried, is a pharmacist. She is of mostly German descent with smaller amounts of English, Scots-Irish, and Welsh ancestry. She has an older sister, Jennifer Seyfried, who is a musician in the Philadelphia rock band Love City.

Seyfried attended William Allen High School, a large public school in Allentown, where she graduated in 2003. She enrolled at Fordham University in New York City in the fall of 2003, but chose not to attend after being offered a leading role in the 2004 film &quot;Mean Girls&quot;.

==Career==
===1996–2005 ===
While attending William Allen High School in Allentown, Seyfried began modeling. She appeared in several print ads for clothing companies, including Limited Too with Leighton Meester, and was featured on three covers of the &quot;Sweet Valley High&quot; novel series. At age 17 she stopped modeling and started a job as a waitress in a retirement community. While still a teen, she took vocal lessons, studied opera, trained with a Broadway coach, and began her acting career as an extra in &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, a daytime television drama. From 2000 to 2001 she played the recurring character Lucy Montgomery on the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and, from 2002 to 2003, Joni Stafford on the ABC soap &quot;All My Children&quot;.

In 2003, Seyfried auditioned to play Regina George in &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, but the role eventually went to Rachel McAdams. While she was initially considered for the lead role of Cady Heron, ultimately played by Lindsay Lohan, the film&#x27;s producers decided that Seyfried should play Karen Smith, Regina&#x27;s dim-witted &quot;plastic&quot; friend and sidekick. The film was a box office success, grossing over $130 million in its theatrical run. Seyfried&#x27;s performance in the film earned her, along with Lohan, Lacey Chabert, and McAdams, an MTV Movie Award in the category of &quot;Best On-Screen Team&quot;.

Seyfried then auditioned to play the title character on UPN&#x27;s television series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;. The role eventually went to Kristen Bell, and Seyfried portrayed Veronica&#x27;s murdered best friend Lilly Kane. Her character was only shown in flashbacks. In 2005, she played the lead character Samantha, a role written by director Rodrigo García specifically for her, in one of the nine parts of the film &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, composed of nine short films with different themes and an ensemble cast. For her performance, Seyfried, along with the film&#x27;s other female leads, won the role Best Actress at the Locarno International Film Festival. That year, she played the supporting character Mouse in the independent film &quot;American Gun&quot;. In 2006, she appeared in five episodes of &quot;Wildfire&quot; as Rebecca and played the lead role Chrissy in the short film &quot;Gypsies, Tramps &amp; Thieves&quot;, written and directed by Andrea Janakas. She also contributed in a minor role as Julie Beckley in &quot;Alpha Dog&quot;. From 2004 to 2006, she made multiple guest appearances on several television series, including &quot;House&quot;, &quot;Justice&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

===2006–2010 ===

With her role in the HBO drama television series &quot;Big Love&quot;, Seyfried&#x27;s profile as an actress grew substantially; the series centered on a fictional fundamentalist Mormon family in which Seyfried plays Sarah Henrickson, Bill and Barb&#x27;s first daughter, who struggles with her family&#x27;s polygamous faith. &quot;Big Love&quot; premiered in the United States on March 12, 2006. In December 2009, HBO confirmed that Seyfried would return for the show&#x27;s fourth season, but that it would be her last since she wished to begin concentrating on her film career and other upcoming projects.

Following &quot;Big Love&quot;, Seyfried played a supporting role, as Zoe, in the 2008 horror drama film &quot;Solstice&quot; and co-starred with Meryl Streep in &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, a romantic comedy film adaptation of the 1999 musical of the same name. &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, which was Seyfried&#x27;s first leading role, was the fifth highest-grossing film of 2008, and, as of February 2021, the 159th highest-grossing film of all time. Five songs from her musical performance in &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; were released on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. As part of promotion for both the film and its soundtrack, Seyfried recorded a music video of the song &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&quot;.

In March 2008, Seyfried was cast in the comedy horror film &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Body&quot; as Anita &quot;Needy&quot; Lesnicki, the title character&#x27;s best friend. The film, which premiered at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and was released to theaters on September 18, 2009, received mixed reviews from critics. The same year she was cast in the comedy drama independent film &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot;. She played Paige Oppenheimer, one of the lead roles in the ensemble movie. The movie was originally shown on June 26, 2009, at Edinburgh International Film Festival, and was shown in US theaters April 25, 2010. On February 22, 2009, Seyfried presented an award and performed at the 81st Academy Awards ceremony. In early March 2009, director Zack Snyder had tapped Seyfried to portray the lead role, Baby Doll, in &quot;Sucker Punch&quot;, but Seyfried had to drop out of the film due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;Big Love&quot;.

Seyfried starred alongside Channing Tatum in &quot;Dear John&quot;, the film adaptation of the novel of the same name that was written by Nicholas Sparks. The film, which was released February 5, 2010, received generally negative reviews. Seyfried wrote and recorded &quot;Little House&quot;, a song on one of the soundtracks of &quot;Dear John&quot;. Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, &quot;Seyfried gives the character and her relationship all she&#x27;s got, but she can&#x27;t do all the heavy lifting. The romance is too one-sided, and frankly, you can&#x27;t blame her for steering her life into another channel.&quot; Despite the negative reviews, &quot;Dear John&quot; became the first film to break up &quot;Avatar&quot;″s box office reign at number one at the United States box office, grossing $80 million in the U.S. theatrically and $115 million worldwide.

Seyfried next appeared as the title character in the erotic thriller &quot;Chloe&quot;, released by Sony Pictures Classics on March 26, 2010. &quot;Chloe&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2009. In the film, Seyfried&#x27;s character is an escort who is hired to test a husband&#x27;s faithfulness after his wife concludes that his fidelity could not be trusted. &quot;Chloe&quot; enjoyed commercial success and became director Atom Egoyan&#x27;s highest-grossing film. Seyfried&#x27;s performance in the film received favorable reviews from critics, helping her gain industry acclaim and additional opportunities to play varied roles.

Later in 2010, Seyfried starred in the romantic-comedy film &quot;Letters to Juliet&quot;, based on the book by Lise and Ceil Friedman. &quot;Letters to Juliet&quot; was released to mixed reviews but was a box office success, grossing $80 million worldwide. For her performance, Seyfried was awarded &quot;Showest Breakthrough Female Star of The Year&quot;. She also won the &quot;Scared-As-S**T&quot; award for her performance in &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Body&quot; and was nominated for Best Female Performance for her movie &quot;Dear John&quot;, at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards. Also in 2010, Seyfried was named to &quot;Forbes&quot;″ &quot;17 Stars To Watch&quot; list, and received three Teen Choice Award nominations, including for Choice Movie Actress Drama and Choice Movie Chemistry with her co-star Channing Tatum for roles in &quot;Dear John&quot;. Seyfried was also nominated for Choice Movie Actress Romantic Comedy for &quot;Letters to Juliet&quot;.

In late January 2009, Seyfried was to appear in Myriad Pictures&#x27; adaptation of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s comedy &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot;. The film, which was scheduled for a 2011 release, encountered financing impediments. In 2009, she was set to star in the film &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; but withdrew from the film because of scheduling conflicts; her role ended up being played by Mia Wasikowska. Seyfried next starred in Catherine Hardwicke&#x27;s &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot;, playing the lead role of Valerie. The film was released on March 11, 2011, to mostly negative reviews, but earned $90 million worldwide on a $42 million budget. She also played the lead role of Sylvia Weis in Andrew Niccol&#x27;s &quot;In Time&quot;, which reunited her with &quot;Alpha Dog&quot; co-star Justin Timberlake; &quot;In Time&quot; was released in October 2011 to mixed reviews but grossed in excess of $172 million worldwide.

Seyfried starred in the thriller &quot;Gone&quot;, released in early 2012. Later that year, she played Cosette in the film adaptation of the musical &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. The film, and her performance, received acclaim from critics, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture and grossed a total of $440 million worldwide.

In 2013, Seyfried had a voice role in the comedy &quot;The Big Wedding&quot; and in the animated movie &quot;Epic&quot;. She played Linda Lovelace in the biopic &quot;Lovelace&quot;, earning critical acclaim from film critics for her role in it. She appeared in the 2013 drama &quot;The End of Love&quot;. She was also signed to play the role of Ann Burden in the dramatization of the Robert O&#x27;Brien post-apocalyptic novel &quot;Z for Zachariah&quot;, but was replaced by Margot Robbie following a delay in the film&#x27;s production.

She earned further critical acclaim in her performance as Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes in the limited series &quot;The Dropout&quot; for which she won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress and a nomination for a second Emmy for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series as a producer of the show.

<text>The Association of Independent Music (AIM) is a non-profit trade body established in 1999 by UK independent record labels to represent the independent record sector, which in 2016 constituted approximately 23% of the UK market. Its members include record labels, self-releasing artists and distributors.

It runs Indie-Con, an annual conference for the independent music industry.

==History==
Alison Wenham founded AIM in 1999, and spent 17 years as its chair and CEO. She moved on to become CEO of Worldwide Independent Network (WIN) in 2016, which she had helped to found in 2006 and been involved with ever since. As a driving force in helping indie labels being able to compete worldwide with bigger companies, Wenham featured in &quot;Billboard&quot;’s &quot;Top Women in Music&quot; every year since publication.

In 2004, AIM featured in the press over their contract negotiations with Apple for rights to distribute their labels&#x27; content on the iTunes service. AIM was ultimately successful in negotiating equivalent terms for its independent labels members that Apple had originally only offered to the &#x27;major&#x27; labels.

In September 2008, AIM became a founding member of UK Music, which represents all aspects of the UK music industry.

In November 2016 AIM appointed Paul Pacifico as CEO.

The 2016 &quot;WINTEL&quot; report showed that the indie sector constituted about 23% of total market share.

On 24 September 2018, Pacifico co-represented IMPALA, the body representing European indie record labels, at the expert workshop organised by the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels (BOZAR), the European Cultural Foundation and the British Council about Brexit and the cultural sector. The goal was &quot;to reaffirm our shared intent and common values, and to produce practical recommendations from the cultural and creative sectors that go beyond those that have already been made&quot;, and a list of recommendations was afterwards published on the IMPALA website.

Pacifico stepped down in December 2022, having served two three-year terms. He was succeeded by Sylvia Montello, who stayed in role just 15 months before resigning in April 2024. COO Gee Davy was named Interim CEO, before being formally appointed to the role in November 2024 at the organisations AGM. Since November 2023 the organisation has been Chaired by Ruth Barlow, Director of Live Licensing at Beggars Group.

<doc id="1020888" wikidata="Q81427" url="?curid=1020888" title="Ravello">
<text>Ravello (Campanian: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) situated above the Amalfi Coast, in the province of Salerno, Campania, with approximately 2,500 inhabitants. Its scenic location makes it a popular tourist destination, and earned it a listing as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.

==History==
Ravello was founded in the 5th century as a shelter place against the barbarian invasions which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire.

In the 9th century Ravello was an important town of the maritime Republic of Amalfi.

It was a producer of wool from its surrounding country that was dyed in the town and an important trading power in the Mediterranean between 839 and around 1200.

In 1086, at the request of the Italo-Norman count Roger Borsa, who wished to create a counterweight to the powerful Duchy of Amalfi, Pope Victor III made Ravello the seat of a diocese immediately subject to the Holy See, with territory split off from that of the archdiocese of Amalfi. Early on, the bishops of Ravello all came from patrician families of the city, showing the church&#x27;s municipalized character.

In the 12th century, Ravello had some 25,000 inhabitants, and it retains a number of palazzi of the mercantile nobility, the Rufolo, d&#x27;Aflitto, Confalone, and Della Marra.

In 1137, after a first failed attack two years before, the Duchy was destroyed by the Republic of Pisa. After this, a demographic and economic decline set in, and much of its population moved to Naples and its surroundings in the Kingdom of Naples.

In 1944 during WW2, the king of Italy lived in Ravello—at the &quot;Palazzo Priscopio&quot;—while waiting to go back to Rome

==Main sights==

*The &quot;&quot; (Cathedral of Ravello): the central nave contains the &quot;Pulpit of the Gospels&quot;, on the right of the central nave, created in 1272 by Nicolò di Bartolomeo from Foggia.
* &quot;Villa Rufolo&quot; (1270), built by Nicola Rufolo, one of the richest Patricians of Ravello, on a ledge and it has become a famous attraction for thousands of visitors. The villa was mentioned by Giovanni Boccaccio in his &quot;Decameron&quot; and it is the place where Richard Wagner in 1880 was inspired for the stage design of his opera Parsifal.
*&quot; Villa Cimbrone&quot;, known for its &quot;Terrace of the Infinite&quot;.
*The church of &quot;San Giovanni del Toro&quot; (named for John the Apostle and for &quot;Il Toro&quot;, the former name of the old aristocratic quarter in which it was built) dating to before the year 1000. The church contains the Bove pulpit, dateable to 1200–1230, incorporated as mosaic fragments Raqqa bacini.
*The small church of &quot;Santa Maria a Gradillo&quot; (11th century). It has a basilica plan, with an apse and two aisles.
*Sanctuary of Sts. Cosmas and Damian (14th century)
*&quot;La Rondinaia&quot; (The Swallow&#x27;s Nest), built in the 1930s on a cliff face, the villa was the Italian residence of Gore Vidal until 2004.

==Culture==
The town has served historically as a destination for artists, musicians, and writers, including Giovanni Boccaccio, Richard Wagner, Edvard Grieg, M. C. Escher, Virginia Woolf, Greta Garbo, Gore Vidal, André Gide, Joan Miró, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Graham Greene, Jacqueline Kennedy, Leonard Bernstein and Sara Teasdale (who mentioned it in her prefatory dedication in &quot;Love Songs&quot;). 

Every year in the summer months, the &quot;Ravello Festival&quot; takes place. It began in 1953 in honour of Richard Wagner.

The 1953 film &quot;Beat the Devil&quot;, directed by John Huston and starring Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones, and Gina Lollobrigida in her English language debut, was shot in Ravello. An extended scene of Bogart and Jones romancing was filmed on the &quot;Terrazza dell&#x27;lnfinito&quot; at the &quot;Villa Cimbrone&quot;.

==Transportation== 
Ravello can be reached from the 163 Amalfitana State Road by private car. The town centre is also served by the 511006 bus.

<text>Thomasina Winifred Montgomery (April 29, 1945 – March 16, 1970), professionally known as Tammi Terrell, was an American singer-songwriter, widely known as a star singer for Motown Records during the 1960s, notably for a series of duets with singer Marvin Gaye.

Terrell began her career as a teenager, first recording for Scepter/Wand Records, before spending nearly nine months as a member of James Brown&#x27;s Revue, recording for Brown&#x27;s Try Me label. After attending college, Terrell recorded briefly for Checker Records before signing with Motown in 1965. With Gaye, she scored seven Top 40 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;, which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot;. 

Terrell&#x27;s career was interrupted when she collapsed into Gaye&#x27;s arms as the two performed at a concert at Hampden–Sydney College on October 14, 1967. Terrell was later diagnosed with a brain tumor and had eight unsuccessful surgeries before dying on March 16, 1970, at the age of 24.

==Early life==
Thomasina Winifred Montgomery was born in Philadelphia to Jennie, née Graham, and Thomas Montgomery. Jennie was an actress and Thomas was a barbershop owner and local politician. According to her sister, their mother was &quot;mentally ill&quot;.

Terrell was the older of two siblings. According to the &quot; Unsung&quot; documentary, her sister Ludie said her parents thought Terrell would be a boy and, therefore, she would be named after her father. When Terrell was born, the parents settled on the name Thomasina, nicknaming her &quot;Tommie&quot;. Terrell later changed it to &quot;Tammy&quot; after seeing the film &quot;Tammy and the Bachelor&quot; and hearing its theme song, &quot;Tammy&quot;, at the age of 12.

According to Ludie&#x27;s book &quot;My Sister Tommie – The Real Tammi Terrell,&quot; Terrell was raped by three boys at the age of 11. Around this time, she started to have migraine headaches. While it was not thought to be of significance at the time, family members later stated that these headaches might have been related to her later diagnosis of brain cancer.

Terrell attended Germantown High School in Philadelphia.

==Career==
===Early recordings===
In 1960, Terrell signed under the Wand subsidiary of Scepter Records after being discovered by Luther Dixon. She recorded the ballad &quot;If You See Bill&quot; under the name Tammy Montgomery, and did demos for the Shirelles. After another single, Terrell left the label. Having been introduced to James Brown, she signed a contract with him and began singing backup for his Revue concert tours. In 1961, Terrell created the group &quot;the Sherrys&quot;. In late 1962, she was kicked out due to multiple disputes. Eventually, they went their separate ways, with the Sherrys moving on without Terrell. In 1963, she recorded the song &quot;I Cried&quot;. Released on Brown&#x27;s Try Me Records, it became her first charting single, reaching No. 99 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Terrell later signed with Checker Records and released the Bert Berns-produced &quot;If I Would Marry You&quot;, a duet with Jimmy Radcliffe, which Terrell co-composed. Following this relative failure, Terrell announced a semi-retirement from the music business. Terrell enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania, where she majored in pre-med, staying at the school for two years. In the middle of this, Terrell was asked by Jerry Butler to sing with him in a series of shows in nightclubs. After Butler arranged to assure Terrell that she could continue her schooling, she began touring with Butler. In April 1965, during a performance at the Twenty Grand Club in Detroit, she was spotted by Motown CEO Berry Gordy, who promised to sign her to Motown. 

Terrell agreed and signed with Motown on April 29, 1965, her 20th birthday. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe You Love Me&quot; became Terrell&#x27;s first R&amp;B top 40 single, followed almost immediately by &quot;Come On and See Me&quot;. In 1966, Terrell recorded two future classics, Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;All I Do (Is Think About You)&quot; and The Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)&quot;. After the release of her first single on Motown, Terrell joined the Motortown Revue opening for the Temptations.

===Success with Marvin Gaye===


In early 1967, Motown hired Terrell to sing duets with Marvin Gaye, who had achieved duet success with Mary Wells and Kim Weston, as well as having recorded duets with Oma Heard. During recording sessions, Gaye recalled later that he did not know how gifted Terrell was until they began singing together. The duets were first recorded separately. For sessions of their first recording, the Ashford &amp; Simpson composition &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;, both Gaye and Terrell recorded separate versions. Motown remixed the vocals and edited out the background vocals, giving just Gaye and Terrell vocal dominance. 

The song became a crossover pop hit in the spring of 1967, reaching No. 19 on the &quot; Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 3 on the R&amp;B charts and making Terrell a star. Their follow-up, &quot;Your Precious Love&quot;, became an even bigger hit, reaching No. 5 on the pop chart and No. 2 on the R&amp;B chart. At the end of 1967, the duo scored another top-ten single with &quot;If I Could Build My Whole World Around You&quot;, which peaked at No. 10 on the pop chart and No. 2 on the R&amp;B chart. The song&#x27;s B-side, the Marvin Gaye composition &quot;If This World Were Mine&quot;, became a modest hit on both charts, No. 68 pop, No. 27 R&amp;B. 

Gaye later cited the song as &quot;one of Tammi&#x27;s favorites&quot;. All four songs were included on Gaye and Terrell&#x27;s first duet album, &quot;United&quot;, released in the late summer of 1967. Throughout 1967, Gaye and Terrell began performing together, and Terrell became a vocal and performance inspiration for the shy and laid-back Gaye, who hated live performing. The duo also performed together on television shows to their hits. They were voted the No. 1 R&amp;B duo in &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine&#x27;s Annual Year-End Survey in 1970. In 1967 the Funk Brothers supported Marvin Gaye &amp; Tammi Terrell&#x27;s live show as backing band.

===Cancer diagnosis===
While Terrell was being established as a star, the migraines and headaches she had suffered from since childhood were becoming more constant. While Terrell complained of pain, she insisted to people close to her that she was well enough to perform. However, on October 14, 1967, while performing &quot;Your Precious Love&quot; with Gaye at Hampden–Sydney College, just outside the town of Farmville, Virginia, Terrell collapsed into Gaye&#x27;s arms onstage. Shortly after her return from Virginia, doctors diagnosed a malignant tumor on the right side of her brain. Terrell underwent brain surgery at Graduate Hospital in Philadelphia on January 13, 1968.

After recovering from her first surgery, Terrell returned to Hitsville studios in Detroit and recorded &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot;. Both that song and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot; reached No. 1 on the R&amp;B charts. Despite Terrell&#x27;s optimism, her tumor worsened, requiring more surgeries. By 1969, Terrell had retired from live performances as doctors had ordered her not to perform due to her tumors. Motown issued Terrell&#x27;s first and only solo album, &quot;Irresistible&quot;, in early 1969. Terrell was too ill to promote the recordings. The album had no new repertoire: all tracks had been recorded earlier and shelved for some time.

Both Marvin Gaye and Valerie Simpson gave different stories on how the production of Terrell&#x27;s and Gaye&#x27;s third album together, &quot;Easy&quot;, went about. According to reports, Terrell had become so ill due to her operations that she could not record, and Motown opted to have Valerie Simpson sub in for Terrell. This report was repeated in the book &quot;Marvin Gaye: What&#x27;s Going On and the Last Days of the Motown Sound&quot;. Gaye would later say the move was &quot;another moneymaking scheme on B.G.&#x27;s Berry Gordy&#x27;s] part.&quot; 

Valerie Simpson, on the other hand, stated that the ailing Terrell was brought into the studio when she was strong enough to record over Simpson&#x27;s guide vocals, insisting Terrell had sung on the album. &quot;Easy&quot; produced the singles &quot;Good Lovin&#x27; Ain&#x27;t Easy to Come By&quot;, &quot;What You Gave Me&quot;, &quot;California Soul&quot;, and the U.K. top-10 hit &quot;The Onion Song&quot;. Late in 1969, Terrell made her final public appearance at the Apollo Theater, where Marvin Gaye performed. As soon as Gaye spotted Terrell, he rushed to her side, and the duo began singing &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot; together. The public gave them a standing ovation.

== Personal life ==

In 1962, 17-year-old Terrell became involved in an abusive relationship with James Brown, who was 12 years her senior. One night on the road in 1963, Terrell left Brown after he assaulted her for not watching his entire performance. Bobby Bennett, former member of the Famous Flames, witnessed the incident. &quot;He beat Tammi Terrell terribly. She was bleeding, shedding blood. Tammi left him because she didn&#x27;t want her butt whipped&quot;, said Bennett.

During the Motortown Revue in 1966, Terrell embarked on a torrid romance with The Temptations lead singer David Ruffin. That year, Terrell accepted Ruffin&#x27;s surprise marriage proposal. After Terrell announced their engagement onstage during an appearance together, she discovered that he was already married. 

Ruffin had a wife, three children, and another girlfriend in Detroit. This revelation and Ruffin&#x27;s drug addiction led to violent arguments. Terrell told &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine in 1969 that she believed her emotional state during this relationship was a contributing factor to her headaches, which came after quarrels. 

In 1967, Terrell ended their relationship after Ruffin hit her in the head with his motorcycle helmet. It was rumored that Ruffin also hit Terrell in the head with a hammer, which further complicated her unknown condition. This rumor was disputed in Terrell&#x27;s &quot;Unsung&quot; episode.

At the time of Terrell&#x27;s death, she was engaged to Ernest &quot;Ernie&quot; Garrett. He was a doctor at the hospital where Terrell had been treated.

==Illness and death==
Due to ongoing complications resulting from a brain tumor, by early 1970, Terrell was using a wheelchair, experienced blindness and hair loss, and weighed only . Following her eighth and final operation on January 21, 1970, Terrell went into a coma. She died on March 16 at the age of 24. Terrell&#x27;s funeral was held at the Janes Methodist Church in Philadelphia.

At the funeral, Gaye delivered a final eulogy while &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot; was playing. According to Terrell&#x27;s fiancé, Dr. Ernest &quot;Ernie&quot; Garrett, who knew Gaye, Terrell&#x27;s mother, Jennie, angrily barred everyone at Motown from her funeral, except for Gaye, whom she felt was Terrell&#x27;s closest friend. She blamed most of the label for failing to protect her from David Ruffin during their relationship. Terrell was interred at Mount Lawn Cemetery in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania.

Gaye reportedly never fully got over Terrell&#x27;s death, according to several biographers who have stated that Terrell&#x27;s death led Gaye to depression and drug abuse. In addition, his classic album &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, a reflective, low-key work that dealt with mature themes, released in 1971, was in part a reaction to Terrell&#x27;s death.

== Awards and nominations ==
Terrell and Marvin Gaye were nominated for Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Group Performance, Vocal or Instrumental for their song &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot; at the 10th Annual Grammy Awards in 1968. The song was later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.

<doc id="1020899" wikidata="Q42543" url="?curid=1020899" title="Governing Council of the Cat Fancy">
<text>The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) is a cat registry, established in 1910 and the largest organisation that registers pedigree cats in the United Kingdom. It was formed from a small number of cat clubs which were registering cats at the time when the modern cat fancy was in its first stages. It is considered to be the original prototype for cat fancy registries. It is an independent body with around 150 member clubs, including specialist breed clubs and area clubs covering particular regions. The GCCF became an incorporated company on 5 November 2010. It licenses cat shows put on by its affiliated clubs with about 135 shows per year. Pedigree cats shown at these shows can gain the titles Champion, Grand Champion, Imperial Grand Champion and Olympian. The latter having three levels, Bronze, Silver and Gold. The word Champion is replaced by Premier for neutered cats, and Master Cat for cats competing in household pets. The showing of non-pedigree cats (often referred to as Domestic shorthair and Domestic longhair) and Pedigree Pets is also popular at GCCF shows.

The GCCF also co-ordinates its own show: the Supreme Cat Show, which is famous for being the world&#x27;s largest cat show and often referred to as the feline equivalent of Crufts. Special awards of UK and Supreme Champion can be gained at this show only.

The GCCF offices are based in Bridgwater and are staffed by people who deal with registrations, publications, show processing &amp; title claims, agendas &amp; minutes and correspondence from breeders, exhibitors, Clubs, Breed Advisory Committees and the general public. They also deal with complaints and breaches of rules, which can sometimes result in disciplinary action and even suspension from Cat Fancy activities. The GCCF is a member of The Cat Group and the World Cat Congress.

The GCCF has set up its own charity: The Cat Welfare Trust, which uses funds raised through the GCCF to find ways of improving the welfare of cats. To date the trust has granted thousands of pounds into key research projects in ringworm vaccination, the feline genome and chronic gingivo-stomatitis in cats.

==Breeds==
The top three most popular cat breeds registered in the GCCF are the British Shorthair, the Ragdoll and the Maine Coon. The GCCF registers around 20,000 pedigree cats each year, and currently recognises the following breeds:

===Section 1===
*Persian (several different colours and patterns)
*Exotic Shorthair

===Section 2===
*Birman

<text>Joshua David Wolff (born February 25, 1977) is an American soccer coach and former player.

==Playing career==
===College===
Born in Stone Mountain, Georgia, Wolff played three years of college soccer at the University of South Carolina, where he scored 21 goals and eight assists in 43 games. He played at South Carolina with future United States national team star Clint Mathis. In addition, Wolff played and captained varsity soccer at Parkview High School, Lilburn, Georgia.

===Professional===
After his junior season, Wolff left college and signed with Major League Soccer. MLS assigned Wolff to the Chicago Fire. He set the MLS rookie scoring record (together with Jeff Cunningham, since broken by Damani Ralph) by scoring eight goals, doing so in just 14 games with only four starts. Wolff played the following four seasons for the Fire, scoring 24 goals, but suffered through multiple injuries.

Before the 2003 MLS Superdraft, the Fire traded Wolff, in a cost-cutting move, to the Kansas City Wizards in exchange for the third overall pick, which the Fire used to select Nate Jaqua. Wolff missed most of the 2003 season due to injuries. He rebounded in 2004 by scoring ten goals and seven assists during the season. Wolff scored his first career playoff goal on a penalty kick during the MLS Cup 2004. He scored ten goals and ten assists in 2005.

In September 2006, Wolff had a try out with English Championship club Derby County. The team was pleased enough with his performance to offer MLS a $500,000 transfer fee. However, British immigration officials denied Wolff a work permit based on the fact he had failed to play the required 75% of the U.S. national team&#x27;s games in the previous two years.

From England, Wolff traveled to Germany for a try out with 2. Bundesliga club 1860 Munich. On December 6, 2006, 1860 Munich signed Wolff to a contract through the 2007–2008 season. Munich paid MLS a $191,000 transfer fee. Wolff joined the team during its January 2007 mid-winter training camp but was waived at the end of the 2008 season.

Wolff signed with the Kansas City Wizards on June 30, 2008. At the end of the 2010 MLS season, after two and a half seasons back in Kansas City, Wolff&#x27;s contract option was declined by the club.

On December 15, 2010, Wolff was selected by D.C. United in Stage 2 of the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft and immediately signed a one-year contract with a club option for 2012.

Wolff announced his retirement on November 28, 2012, and became a full-time assistant coach with D.C. United.

===International===

Wolff has scored nine goals in fifty-two caps since his debut against Jamaica on September 8, 1999. He also starred for the US in the 2000 Summer Olympics, scoring two goals and helping the team to a fourth-place finish. As with his club teams, however, Wolff has had trouble securing a definite spot because of continual injury problems. He did play for the United States in the 2002 World Cup, assisting on the opening goal in the second-round win against Mexico. On May 2, 2006, Wolff was named to the US roster for the FIFA World Cup in Germany. Wolff played his last national team match versus Spain at Estadio El Sardinero on June 4, 2008.

====International goals====

==Coaching career==
After a season on the coaching staff at D.C. United, Wolff joined the Columbus Crew in November 2013, and remained an assistant coach until 2018. In 2018, Wolff joined the staff of the United States Men&#x27;s National Team under Gregg Berhalter.

On July 23, 2019, Wolff was announced to be the first head coach of MLS expansion team Austin FC, who began playing with the 2021 season.

Austin FC had 9 wins, 21 defeats, and 4 draws in their expansion season under Wolff, finishing in 12th in the Western Conference, one point above Houston in last. Austin was eliminated from playoff contention on October 16 after a home defeat to Minnesota, with five matches to spare. Wolff played with a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1 formation in his first season, and his team was characterized as having high possession numbers, and for building out from the back. Despite having the fourth-highest average percent possession per game at 53.9%, Austin scored the fewest goals in the league at 35. The team went into their match on October 30 against Dallas with a chance to win the first MLS Copa Tejas, but a 2–1 defeat meant that they finished in third. In his first season as a head coach, Wolff was questioned by the fans about his tactics and substitutions.

Coach Wolff&#x27;s second year was a stark contrast to what his team had endured in 2021. Though their performance in the U.S. Open Cup ended after a single game, which they lost 2–1 to their Texas USL Championship opponent San Antonio FC, the team&#x27;s performance in the MLS season was a different story. Scoring 30 more goals and giving up 16 less goals than the 2021 season, Wolff&#x27;s team ended with a 2nd-place finish in the Western Conference earning a spot in their first MLS Cup Playoffs. Under Wolff&#x27;s guidance the team continued to be successful, exciting fans by making their way to the Western Conference Finals, losing 3–0 to LAFC in a lackluster performance to end their season.

On October 6, 2024, Austin FC parted ways with Wolff after falling short of qualifying for 2024 MLS Cup playoffs.

==Personal life==
Wolff&#x27;s eldest son Tyler plays for Real Salt Lake, and his younger son Owen played for him at Austin FC.

<text>The Formosa Cafe is a restaurant and bar founded in 1925 and located at 7156 Santa Monica Boulevard at the intersection with North Formosa Avenue, in West Hollywood, California.

The Formosa was founded in 1925 by 1920s prize-fighter Jimmy Bernstein. Bernstein operated his establishment initially in a Red Car trolley located just east of The United Artists studio lot. In 1945, Lem Quon went into partnership with Bernstein, taking full ownership in 1976 when Bernstein died. The restaurant remained in the family with Quon&#x27;s grandson, Vince Jung, managing it. Several long-term employees worked for decades at the Formosa Cafe, including bartender Lindy Bremerton who worked there for almost 50 years, waitresses Mary Kay Moore (over 40 years), bartender Nick Pappas (over 30 years) and Catherine (Cass) Marples (over 25 years).

The restaurant has a long history of movie star and film industry patronage due to its proximity to studio lot across the street, which began as the United Artists lot and was later owned by Warner Bros. Generations of movie stars such as Humphrey Bogart, David Janssen and Clark Gable have eaten meals at The Formosa. Frank Sinatra is reputed to have spent many nights at the Formosa in the 1950s, pining over Ava Gardner.

In 1991, the restaurant was threatened with demolition when its lease expired as plans evolved for The Lot, the soon-to-be renamed Warner Hollywood studio parking lot, and what later would become the West Hollywood Gateway shopping center. Due to concerted citizen and preservationist efforts, the restaurant was preserved in its present location as a landmark. The cuisine served at Formosa is predominantly Chinese-influenced, with Beijing Chicken, Mongolian beef, wasabi mashed potatoes, bok choy and mushrooms, pork belly skewers, Formosa Caesar salad, etc. Celebrities continued to frequent the establishment throughout its history.

In 2004, the historic restaurant was dwarfed by the West Hollywood Gateway shopping mall which was built to its immediate east, occupying the entire southeast corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and North La Brea Avenue.

In 2015, the restaurant&#x27;s original red-and-black 1940s interiors were gutted and a &quot;modern&quot; interior was installed, despite clientele who enjoyed the nostalgic ambience. After negative reactions to the change, much of the original interior was rebuilt. Less than 18 months after the gutting, just before Christmas of 2016, the Formosa Cafe closed without advance notice.

In June 2017, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; announced that the café would reopen with a new operator, the 1933 Group.

As of July 2021, Formosa is open again for drinks and dining.

==In popular culture==
The interior and exterior of the Formosa Cafe can be seen in two key sequences in the 1997 movie &quot;L.A. Confidential,&quot; set in early 1950s Los Angeles. Other productions that have used the café include &quot;Swingers&quot; (1996), &quot;Still Breathing&quot; (1998), &quot;The Majestic&quot; (2001), and episodes of the television series &quot;Bosch,&quot; &quot;Blood Under the Bridge&quot;, &quot;Euphoria,&quot; &quot;A Thousand Little Trees of Blood&quot;, and &quot;Bling Empire,&quot; &quot;What&#x27;s in Anna&#x27;s Shower?&quot; (2021).

<text>Love, American Style is an American anthology comedy television series that aired on ABC from September 29, 1969, to January 11, 1974. The series was produced by Paramount Television. During the 1971–72 and 1972–73 seasons, it was a part of ABC&#x27;s Friday primetime lineup that included &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, &quot;Room 222&quot;, and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. It featured some of the earliest work of future stars Diane Keaton (&quot;Love and the Pen Pals&quot;), Sally Struthers (&quot;Love and the Triangle&quot;), Albert Brooks (&quot;Love and Operational Model&quot;), and Harrison Ford (&quot;Love and the Former Marriage&quot;). &quot;Room 222&quot; star Karen Valentine appeared in four episodes. &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; star Ann B. Davis and &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; star Dave Madden each appeared in two episodes.

==History==

Each episode of the show featured multiple stories of romance, usually with a comedic spin. Episodes were stand-alone, featuring various characters, stories and locations. The show often featured the same actors playing different characters in many episodes. In addition, a large, ornate brass bed was a recurring prop in many episodes.

Charles Fox&#x27;s music score, featuring flutes, harp and flugelhorn set to a contemporary pop beat, provided the &quot;love&quot; ambiance, which tied the stories together as a multifaceted romantic comedy each week. For the first season, the theme song was performed by the Cowsills. Beginning with the second season, the same theme song was sung by the Ron Hicklin Singers, also known as the voices behind the Partridge Family (based on the Cowsills), among others, featuring brothers John and Tom Bahler (billed as the Charles Fox Singers). This second version of the theme was kept for the remainder of the series, as well as on most episodes prepared for syndication.

The title is loosely derived from a 1961 Italian comedy film called &quot;Divorzio all&#x27;italiana (Divorce, Italian Style)&quot;, which received Academy Award nominations in 1962 for Best Director for Pietro Germi and for Best Actor for star Marcello Mastroianni. The film was later spoofed in 1967 by &quot;Divorce, American Style&quot;, starring Dick Van Dyke. The snowclone &quot;(xxx), (nationality) Style&quot; became a minor cultural catch-phrase as the 1960s progressed.

The original series was also known for its 10- to 20-second blackouts between the featured segments. These were performed by a house troupe that featured future &quot;Rockford Files&quot; cast member Stuart Margolin, future &quot;Vega$&quot; leading lady Phyllis Davis and a young character actor, James Hampton, who was known to television audiences of the era as Private Dobbs from the TV series &quot;F-Troop&quot;. These clips allowed the show to be padded to the required length without adding to the main segments. They generally consisted of risqué, burlesque-style comedy-of-manners visual jokes.

During its first four years on ABC, &quot;Love, American Style&quot; was popular with viewers and received decent ratings, although it never ranked among the top 30 shows in the Nielsens. For a few seasons, it was part of a lineup of ABC Friday night programs that included &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, &quot;Room 222&quot;, and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;.

Some of the show&#x27;s segments also served as pilots for proposed television series. Many never made it beyond the pilot stage, but two resulted in a series:

* On February 11, 1972, the show presented the animated segment &quot;Love and the Old-Fashioned Father.&quot; This would become the pilot to a first-run syndicated animated series by Hanna-Barbera, &quot;Wait Till Your Father Gets Home&quot;, which debuted that fall. 
* Two weeks later, on February 25, 1972, the show aired a segment titled &quot;Love and the Television Set&quot;, a story about Richie Cunningham, his family and friends. The premise and characters were later used for the 1974 television series &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and the episode would later be recognized as a &quot;de facto&quot; pilot for the series. (It had originally been produced as a pilot for &quot;New Family in Town&quot;, which was not picked up). For syndication, the segment was retitled &quot;Love and the Happy Days.&quot; &quot;Happy Days&quot;, in turn, launched an extensive franchise of spinoffs into the 1980s.

The series was also flexible enough to include repurposed pilots that had already failed or been retooled. One first-season example was &quot;Love and the Good Deal,&quot; which was actually the original, unaired pilot for the sitcom adaptation of the Neil Simon play and movie &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;, with a different cast than the series.

At the start of the 1973–1974 fall season, the ratings for &quot;Love, American Style&quot; and &quot;Room 222&quot; had plummeted. As a result, both shows were canceled mid-season. The series received several Emmy nominations, including two for Best Comedy Series for 1969–70 and 1970–71. The show subsequently became a daytime standard on ABC from June 1971 to May 1974, and later in syndication, since it was readily edited down to a half-hour by the proper interweaving of the clips with a main segment. It effectively made nine seasons out of five. This allowed for heavy stripping.

==Episodes==
==New versions==
A decade after the show left the air, a new version aired on ABC&#x27;s daytime schedule from December 23, 1985 to August 15, 1986 entitled &quot;New Love, American Style&quot; (including an updated version of the theme performed by Lou Rawls), but was canceled after only eight months because of low ratings against &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; on CBS. A third edition, starring Melissa Joan Hart and Mariska Hargitay among others, was shot as a pilot for the 1998–1999 television season, but was not ordered as a series. Nevertheless, ABC aired the pilot on February 20, 1999.

==Nielsen ratings==
*1969-70 - #58, 13.2 rating
*1970-71 - #47, 17.2 rating 
*1971-72 - #33, 19.3 rating
*1972-73 - #41, 18.4 rating
*1973-74 - #75, 11.7 rating

==Home media==
On November 20, 2007, CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) released &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, Season 1 Volume 1 on DVD in Region 1. Season 1, Volume 2 on DVD was released on March 11, 2008.

<doc id="1020921" wikidata="Q959457" url="?curid=1020921" title="Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion">
<text>Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), also known as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), is characterized by a physiologically inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) either from the posterior pituitary gland, or an ectopic non-pituitary source, such as an ADH-secreting tumor in the lung. Unsuppressed ADH causes a physiologically inappropriate increase in solute-free water being reabsorbed by the tubules of the kidney to the venous circulation leading to hypotonic hyponatremia (a low plasma osmolality and low sodium levels). 
The causes of SIADH are commonly grouped into categories including: central nervous system diseases that directly stimulate the hypothalamus to release ADH, various cancers that synthesize and secrete ectopic ADH, various lung diseases, numerous drugs (carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide, SSRIs) that may stimulate the release of ADH, vasopressin release, desmopressin release, oxytocin, or stimulation of vasopressin receptor 2 on the kidney (the site of ADH action). Inappropriate antidiuresis may also be due to acute stressors such as exercise, pain, severe nausea or during the post-operative state. In 17–60% of people, the cause of inappropriate antidiuresis is never found. 

ADH is derived from a preprohormone precursor that is synthesized in cells in the hypothalamus and stored in vesicles in the posterior pituitary. &quot;Appropriate&quot; ADH secretion is regulated by osmoreceptors on the hypothalamic cells that synthesize and store ADH. In appropriate ADH secretion, plasma hypertonicity activates these osmoreceptors, ADH is released into the blood stream, the kidneys increase solute-free water reabsorption, and the hypertonicity is alleviated. A decrease in the effective circulating volume of blood (the volume of arterial blood effectively perfusing tissues) also stimulates an appropriate, physiologic release of ADH. &quot;Inappropriate&quot; ADH secretion causes physiologically high water reabsorption by the kidneys, causing elevated fluid retention. This causes the extracellular fluid (ECF) space to become hypoosmolar and hyponatremic (low sodium). In the intracellular space, cells swell as intracellular volume increases as water moves from an area of low solute concentration (extracellular space) to an area of high solute concentration (the cells&#x27; interior). In severe or acute hypoosmolar hyponatremia, swelling of brain cells causes various neurological abnormalities, which in severe or acute cases can result in convulsions, coma, and death. The symptoms of chronic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis are more vague, and may include cognitive impairment, gait abnormalities, or osteoporosis.

The main treatment of inappropriate antidiuresis is to identify and treat the underlying cause, if possible. This usually causes plasma osmolality and sodium levels to return to normal in several days. In those in which an underlying cause cannot be found, or is untreatable, treatments are targeted to alleviating correcting the hypoosmolality and hyponatremia. These include restriction of fluid intake, using salt tablets (sometimes with diuretics), urea supplements, intravenous saline, or increasing protein intake. The vasopressin receptor 2 antagonists, tolvaptan or conivaptan, may also be used. The presence of cerebral edema, or other moderate to severe symptoms, may necessitate intravenous hypertonic saline administration with close monitoring of the serum sodium levels to avoid overcorrection. 

SIADH was originally described in 1957 in two people with small-cell carcinoma of the lung.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Gastro-intestinal===
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Nausea

===Musculoskeletal===
* Muscle aches
* Generalized muscle weakness

===Neuro-muscular===
* Myoclonus
* Decreased reflexes
* Ataxia
* Pathological reflexes
* Tremor
* Asterixis

===Respiratory===
* Cheyne-Stokes respiration

===Neurological===
* Dysarthria
* Lethargy
* Confusion
* Delirium
* Seizures
* Coma (from brain swelling)
* Death

==Causes==
Causes of SIADH include conditions that dysregulate ADH secretion in the central nervous system, tumors that secrete ADH, drugs that increase ADH secretion, among other causes. Cancer accounts for an estimated 24% of cases of SIADH, with 25% of those causes due to small cell lung cancer. Medications or drugs are responsible for 18% of cases of SIADH. This is due to a variety of mechanisms including: stimulation of ADH release (opiates, ifosfamide, vincristine, platinum-based antineoplastics and MDMA (also known as ecstasy)); enhancers of ADH effect (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories); ADH analogues (desmopressin, oxytocin); and vasopressin receptor 2 activators (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), haloperidol, carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide, and chlorpropamide). Of the causes of medication induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis, antidepressants (especially SSRIs) are the most common culprit. Central nervous system (CNS) disorders or conditions may cause SIADH in 9% of cases, this includes subarachnoid hemorrhage (56% of CNS causes), pituitary surgery (35% of CNS causes), brain cancer, infections, stroke and head trauma. No cause of inappropriate antidiuresis is initially found in 17–60% of cases.

A list of common causes is below:
==Pathophysiology==
Normally there are homeostatic processes in the body which maintain the concentration of body solutes within a narrow range, both inside and outside cells. The process occurs as follows: in some hypothalamic cells there are osmoreceptors which respond to hyperosmolality in body fluids by signalling the posterior pituitary gland to secrete ADH. This keeps serum sodium concentration – a proxy for solute concentration – at normal levels, prevents hypernatremia and turns off the osmoreceptors. Specifically, when the serum sodium rises above 142 mEq/L, ADH secretion is maximal (and thirst is stimulated as well); when it is below 135 mEq/L, there is no secretion. ADH activates V2 receptors on the basolateral membrane of principal cells in the renal collecting duct, initiating a cyclic AMP-dependent process that culminates in increased production of water channels (aquaporin 2), and their insertion into the cells&#x27; luminal membranes.

&quot;Excessive&quot; ADH causes an &quot;inappropriate&quot; increase in the reabsorption in the kidneys of solute-free water (&quot;free water&quot;): excess water moves from the distal convoluted tubules (DCTs) and collecting tubules of the nephrons – via activation of aquaporins, the site of the ADH receptors – back into the circulation. This has two consequences. First, in the extracellular fluid (ECF) space, there is a dilution of blood solutes, causing hypoosmolality, including a low sodium concentration – hyponatremia. [There is no expansion of the ECF volume because as it attempts to expand, aldosterone is suppressed and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is stimulated: both of these hormones cause isotonic ECF fluid to be excreted by the kidneys sufficient to keep ECF volume at a normal level.] Also, virtually simultaneously to these ECF events, the intracellular space (ICF) volume expands. This is because the osmolality of the ECF is (transiently) less than that of the ICF; and since water is readily permeable to cell membranes, solute-free water moves from the ECF to the ICF compartment by osmosis: &quot;all&quot; cells swell. Swelling of brain cells – cerebral edema – causes various neurological abnormalities which in acute and/or severe cases can result in convulsions, coma, and death.

The normal function of ADH on the kidneys is to control the amount of water reabsorbed by kidney nephrons. ADH acts in the distal portion of the renal tubule (distal convoluted tubule) as well as on the collecting duct and causes the retention of water, but &quot;not&quot; solute. Hence, ADH activity effectively dilutes the blood (decreasing the concentrations of solutes such as sodium), causing hyponatremia; this is compounded by the fact that the body responds to water retention by decreasing aldosterone, thus allowing even more sodium wasting. For this reason, a high urinary sodium excretion will be seen.

The abnormalities underlying type D syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion concern individuals where vasopressin release and response are normal but where abnormal renal expression and translocation of aquaporin 2, or both are found.

It has been suggested that this is due to abnormalities in the secretion of secretin in the brain and that &quot;Secretin as a neurosecretory hormone from the posterior pituitary, therefore, could be the long-sought vasopressin independent mechanism to solve the riddle that has puzzled clinicians and physiologists for decades.&quot; There are no abnormalities in total body sodium metabolism. Hyponatremia and inappropriately concentrated urine (UOsm &gt;100 mOsm/L) are seen.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory findings of low serum osmolality and low serum sodium.

Urinalysis reveals a highly concentrated urine with a high fractional excretion of sodium (high sodium urine content compared to the serum sodium).
A suspected diagnosis is based on a serum sodium under 138. A confirmed diagnosis has seven elements: 1) a decreased effective serum osmolality – &lt;275 mOsm/kg of water; 2) urinary sodium concentration high – over 40 mEq/L with adequate dietary salt intake; 3) no recent diuretic usage; 4) no signs of ECF volume depletion or excess; 5) no signs of decreased arterial blood volume – cirrhosis, nephrosis, or congestive heart failure; 6) normal adrenal and thyroid function; and 7) no evidence of hyperglycemia (diabetes mellitus), hypertriglyceridemia, or hyperproteinia (myeloma).

There are nine supplemental features: 1) a low BUN; 2) a low uric acid; 3) a normal creatinine; 4) failure to correct hyponatremia with IV normal saline; 5) successful correction of hyponatremia with fluid restriction; 6) a fractional sodium excretion &gt;1%; 7) a fractional urea excretion &gt;55%; 8) an abnormal water load test; and 9) an elevated plasma AVP.

===Differential diagnosis===

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is released from the posterior pituitary for a number of physiologic reasons. The majority of people with hyponatremia, other than those with excessive water intake (polydipsia) or renal salt wasting, will have elevated ADH as the cause of their hyponatremia. However, not every person with hyponatremia and elevated ADH has SIADH. One approach to a diagnosis is to divide ADH release into appropriate (not SIADH) or inappropriate (SIADH).

Appropriate ADH release can be a result of hypovolemia, a so-called non-osmotic trigger of ADH release. This may be true hypovolemia, as a result of dehydration with fluid losses replaced by free water. It can also be perceived hypovolemia, as in the conditions of congestive heart failure (CHF) and cirrhosis in which the kidneys perceive a lack of intravascular volume. The hyponatremia caused by appropriate ADH release (from the kidneys&#x27; perspective) in both CHF and cirrhosis have been shown to be an independent poor prognostic indicator of mortality.

Appropriate ADH release can also be a result of non-osmotic triggers. Symptoms such as nausea/vomiting and pain are significant causes of ADH release. The combination of osmotic and non-osmotic triggers of ADH release can adequately explain the hyponatremia in the majority of people who are hospitalized with acute illness and are found to have mild to moderate hyponatremia. SIADH is less common than appropriate release of ADH. While it should be considered in a differential, other causes should be considered as well.

Cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSWS) also presents with hyponatremia, there are signs of dehydration for which reason the management is diametrically opposed to SIADH. Importantly CSWS can be associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) which may require fluid supplementation rather than restriction to prevent brain damage.

Most cases of hyponatremia in children are caused by appropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone rather than SIADH or another cause.

==Treatment==
Managing SIADH depends on whether symptoms are present, the severity of the hyponatremia, and the duration. Management of SIADH includes:
* Treating the underlying cause when possible.
* Mild and asymptomatic hyponatremia is treated with adequate solute intake (including salt and protein) and fluid restriction with fluids (from all sources) restricted to 1–1.5 liters of fluid per day. Long-term fluid restriction may maintain the person in a symptom-free state as well as correcting the hyponatremia, but efficacy is limited by difficulties in patient adherence.
* Moderate or severe hyponatremia, or hyponatremia with severe symptoms is treated by raising the serum sodium level by 1–2 mmol per liter per hour for the first few hours with a goal of raising levels less than 8–10 mmol per liter in the first 24 hours and 18 mmol per liter in the first 48 hours. Raising the serum sodium concentration too rapidly may cause central pontine myelinolysis (also known as osmotic demyelination). Sodium correction should be no greater than 10 mEq/L/day, with a correction no greater than 8 mEq/L/day in those at high risk of osmotic demyelination. If overcorrection does occur, a 5% dextrose in water infusion may be given to temporarily lower sodium levels. total of 8 mmol per liter during the first day with the use of furosemide and replacing sodium and potassium losses with 0.9% saline.
* For people with severe symptoms (severe confusion, convulsions, or coma) hypertonic saline (3%) 1–2 ml/kg IV in 3–4 h may be given.

===Medications===
** Demeclocycline can be used in chronic situations when fluid restrictions are difficult to maintain; demeclocycline is the most potent inhibitor of Vasopressin (ADH/AVP) action. However, demeclocycline has a 2–3 day delay in onset with extensive side effect profile, including skin photosensitivity, and nephrotoxicity.
** Urea: oral daily ingestion has shown favorable long-term results with protective effects in myelinosis and brain damage. Limitations noted to be undesirable taste and is contraindicated in people with cirrhosis to avoid initiation or potentiation of hepatic encephalopathy.
** Conivaptan – an antagonist of both V1A and V2 vasopressin receptors.
** Tolvaptan – an antagonist of the vasopressin receptor 2.

==Epidemiology==
40% of all hospitalized adults aged 65 and older have hyponatremia, with an estimated 25–40% of those cases being due to inappropriate antidiuresis. The incidence of SIADH rises with increasing age with residents of nursing homes being at highest risk.

==History==
Through medullary lesioning in animals, Jungmann and Meyer from Germany induced polyuria and increased urinary salt excretion in 1913. Water intake restriction did not stop the polyuria, and salt continued to be excreted in the urine despite. In 1936, McCance defined the consequences of salt depletion in normal human. Patients with extra-renal salt losses complicated by hyponatremia were found to be common-place, and consistent with McCance&#x27;s description, they excreted urine virtually free of sodium. In 1950, Sims et al, published their work that suggest observed relation between hyponatremia and pulmonary tuberculosis. Their work suggested that a primary reduction in cellular osmolarity may be the initiating factor in the development of this new syndrome (later called SIADH). The increased excretion of sodium at subnormal concentrations of this ion in the serum might represent an attempt to reduce extracellular tonicity to conform with a reduced cellular osmolarity. An eosinopenia response to epinephrine and the ability to reduce the excretion of sodium on a regime free of salt aids in differentiating this syndrome from Addison&#x27;s disease. Almost a century after the pioneering work of Claude Bernard (1813–1878) in animals, Peters et al, in 1950, reported three patients seen at Yale New Haven Hospital with hyponatremia associated with varying cerebral pathologies and severe dehydration. In each patient, urine sodium losses persisted despite hyponatremia and a high-salt diet. All three patients were unable to prevent urinary sodium loss despite low serum sodium levels and no evidence of extrarenal sodium loss. Their hyponatremia responded to salt therapy. They postulated that this provided evidence of an extra-pituitary cerebral structure mediating normal sodium metabolism but were unsure of its location or mechanism of action. A subsequent paper from the group at Yale attributed hyponatremia in neurologic disease to SIADH. In 1952, Welt et al, described another six patients with cerebral lesions exhibiting severe clinical dehydration, hyponatremia, a negative sodium balance, but no potassium retention. All responded to sodium chloride administration but administering aldosterone precursor 11-deoxycorticosterone did not reverse renal sodium loss. The authors felt neither pituitary nor adrenal insufficiency was involved, but that direct neural control of renal proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium was disrupted. In 1953, Leaf et al, demonstrated that exogenous administration of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin resulted in hyponatremia and a natriuresis dependent on water retention and weight gain. This was not &quot;salt wasting&quot;; it was a physiologic response to an expanded intravascular volume. Vasopressin-ADH administration to normal humans was shown to result in water retention and urinary loss of electrolytes (primarily sodium) in other studies at the time.

William Schwartz (1922–2009) attended Duke University after serving in the US Army in World War II. He observed that sulfanilamide increased excretion of sodium in patients with heart failure. This observation was the basis for the discovery and development of modern diuretic drugs. Frederic Bartter (1914–1983) worked on hormones affecting the kidney that led to the discovery of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in 1957 and Bartter syndrome in 1963. Schwartz-Bartter syndrome is named after these two scientists. The first reports of hyponatremia and renal sodium loss corrected by fluid restriction in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma were published by Bartter. At that time, no direct measurement of vasopressin was done. In summary, the condition was first described at separate institutions by William Schwartz and Frederic Bartter in two people with lung cancer. Criteria were developed by Schwartz and Bartter in 1967 and have remained unchanged since then.

==Society and culture==
The condition is occasionally referred to by the names of the authors of the first report: &quot;Schwartz-Bartter syndrome&quot;. Because not all people with this syndrome have elevated levels of vasopressin, the term &quot;syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis&quot; (SIAD) has been proposed as a more accurate description of this condition.

<doc id="1020922" wikidata="Q263501" url="?curid=1020922" title="Debbie Allen">
<text>Deborah Kaye Allen (born January 16, 1950) is an American actress, dancer, choreographer, singer, director, producer, and a former member of the President&#x27;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. She has been nominated 20 times for an Emmy Award (winning five), and two Tony Awards. She has won a Golden Globe Award, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991.

Allen is best known for her work in the musical-drama television series &quot;Fame&quot; (1982–1987), where she portrayed dance teacher Lydia Grant, and served as the series&#x27; principal choreographer. For this role in 1983, she received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy and two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Choreography and was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Allen later began working as director and producer, most notably producing and directing 83 of 144 episodes of the NBC comedy series &quot;A Different World&quot; (1988–1993). She returned to acting, playing the leading role in the NBC sitcom &quot;In the House&quot; from 1995 to 1996, and in 2011, began playing Dr. Catherine Avery in the ABC medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; also serving as an executive producer/director. She has directed more than 50 television and film productions.

In 2001, Allen opened the Debbie Allen Dance Academy in Los Angeles, where she currently teaches young dancers. She also taught choreography to former Los Angeles Lakers dancer-turned-singer, Paula Abdul. She is the younger sister of actress/director/singer Phylicia Rashad.

==Early life==
Allen was born in Houston, Texas, the third child of orthodontist Andrew Arthur Allen and Pulitzer Prize-nominated artist, poet, playwright, scholar, and publisher, Vivian (née Ayers) Allen. She earned a B.A. degree in classical Greek literature, speech, and theater from Howard University and studied acting at HB Studio in New York City. She was a member of Chi Delta Mu Health Professional Fraternity. She holds &quot;honoris causa&quot; doctorates from Howard University and the University of North Carolina School of the Arts.

=== Challenges ===
Debbie Allen auditioned at the Houston Ballet Academy at the age of twelve but was denied admission. After another chance, she was admitted a year later by a Russian instructor who accidentally saw her perform in a show. Once recruiters from the academy became aware of the situation, they allowed her to stay because they recognized her talent. While at the academy, she trained under Suzelle Poole.

Her experience at the Houston Ballet Academy is not the only time Allen was refused. When she was sixteen, she had a successful audition for the North Carolina School of the Arts and was given an opportunity to demonstrate dance techniques to other prospective students applying to the institution. However, she was refused admission and was told her body was not suited to ballet. After numerous rejections, she decided to focus on her academic studies and was on her way to the start of her acting career.

==Career==
===1970–1981: Early works===
Allen began her career appearing on Broadway theatre. Allen had her Broadway debut in the chorus of &quot;Purlie&quot; in 1970. She later created the role of Beneatha in the Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Raisin&quot; (1973), and appeared in &quot;Truckload&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;. In 1980, she received critical attention for her performance as Anita in the Broadway revival of &quot;West Side Story&quot; which earned her a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Musical and won her a Drama Desk Award.

In 1976, Allen made her television debut appearing in the CBS sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot; in a memorable 2-part episode titled &quot;J.J.&#x27;s Fiancée&quot; as J.J.&#x27;s drug-addicted fiancée, Diana. The following year, she went to star in the NBC variety show &quot;3 Girls 3&quot;. Allen later was selected to appear in the 1979 miniseries &quot;&quot; by Alex Haley where she plays the wife of Haley. Also, that year, she made her big screen debut appearing in a supporting role in the comedy film &quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&quot;. In 1981, she had the important role of Sarah in the movie version of the best-selling novel &quot;Ragtime&quot;, a role that earned Audra McDonald a Tony Award for in the Broadway musical.
===1982–1987: &quot;Fame&quot;===

In the film &quot;Fame&quot; (1980), Allen played the role of Lydia Grant. Though the film role was relatively small role, Lydia became a central figure in the television adaptation, which ran from 1982 to 1987. During the opening montage of each episode, Grant told her students: &quot;You&#x27;ve got big dreams? You want fame? Well, fame costs. And right here is where you start paying ... in sweat.&quot; Allen was nominated for the Emmy Award for Best Actress four times during the show&#x27;s run. She is the only actress to have appeared in all three screen incarnations of &quot;Fame&quot;, playing Lydia Grant in both the 1980 film and 1982 television series and playing the school principal in the 2009 remake. Allen was also lead choreographer for the film and television series, winning two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography and one Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. She became the first Black woman to win a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Television Series—Musical or Comedy.

In 1986, Allen received a second Tony Award nomination, at that time for Best Actress in a Musical, for her performance in the title role of Bob Fosse&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;. Also that year, she had a supporting role in the comedy-drama film &quot;Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling&quot; directed, produced by and starring Richard Pryor.

===1988–present===
After &quot;Fame&quot;, Allen focused on working off-camera and as a choreographer. She choreographed the 1988 Broadway adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s “Carrie.” &quot;Carrie&quot; was a collaboration with her fellow “Fame” alumni Michael Gore, Dean Pitchford, and Gene Anthony Ray. The show opened to mixed reviews and closed after only 16 previews and 5 performances.

In an article from the Museum of Broadcast Communications, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; commented on Allen&#x27;s impact as the producer-director of the television series, &quot;A Different World&quot;. The show dealt with the lives of students at the fictional historically black college, Hillman. The show ran for six seasons on NBC. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; is quoted as stating that when Debbie Allen became the producer (and usually director) of &quot;A Different World&quot; after the first season, she transformed it &quot;from a bland &quot;Cosby&quot; spin-off into a lively, socially responsible, ensemble situation comedy.&quot; She directed a total of 83 episodes.

Allen has released two solo albums, &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; (1986) and &quot;Special Look&quot; (1989), which also produced several singles. Also that year, she directed musical film &quot;Polly&quot;. She later directed crime drama film &quot;Out-of-Sync&quot; (1995) as well as a number of television films. She choreographed &quot;The Academy Awards Show&quot; for ten years, six of which were consecutive. In 1995, Allen directed the voice cast and lent her voice to the children&#x27;s animated series &quot;C Bear and Jamal&quot; for Film Roman and Fox Kids. That same year, she starred in the NBC sitcom &quot;In the House&quot; which ran for five seasons. She co-produced the 1997 Steven Spielberg historical drama film &quot;Amistad&quot; receiving a Producers Guild of America Award.

Since 2007, Allen has participated as a judge and mentor for the U.S. version of &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;. During Season 4, she stepped aside as a judge at the end of Vegas week to avoid perception of bias, since one of her former dancers, Will, had made it to the top 20.

In 2008, Allen directed the all-African-American Broadway production of Tennessee Williams&#x27; Pulitzer Prize-winning drama &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, starring stage veterans James Earl Jones (Big Daddy), her sister Phylicia Rashad (Big Mama) and Anika Noni Rose (Maggie the Cat), as well as film actor Terrence Howard, who made his Broadway debut as Brick. The production, with some roles recast, had a limited run (2009 – April 2010) in London. She also directed and starred in the 2001 play and its television adaptation &quot;The Old Settler&quot;.

In 2000s and 2010s, Allen directed television shows, including 44 episodes of &quot;All of Us&quot;, as well as &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;, &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;Scandal&quot; and &quot;Jane the Virgin&quot;. In 2011, she joined the cast of ABC medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; playing the role of Dr. Catherine Fox. As of the 12th season, she served as an executive producer.

<text>Spirit Caravan was an American doom metal / stoner rock band featuring guitarist and vocalist Scott &quot;Wino&quot; Weinrich.

==Biography==
Scott &quot;Wino&quot; Weinrich formed Spirit Caravan after the breakup of The Obsessed. The remainder of the band consisted of Dave Sherman (formerly of Wretched) on bass and vocals; and Gary Isom (formerly of Unorthodox) on drums. Weinrich credits them for encouraging him to join the band and become active musically again, after he had abandoned his music career. The band was originally entitled Shine, and they released a demo and 7&quot; under this name. They were forced to change to the band&#x27;s name when another band of the same name threatened legal action. They changed their name to Spirit Caravan, after an Obsessed song. The band had a lyrical emphasis on spirituality (though not necessarily religion) and global politics. The band split up in 2002 but have reunited for US tour dates and European festival appearances in 2014.

After the band&#x27;s demise, Weinrich joined Place of Skulls and founded The Hidden Hand. After The Hidden Hand&#x27;s demise in 2007, Weinrich rejoined the reactivated Saint Vitus. Sherman went on to found the band Earthride. Isom joined Internal Void, Pentagram, Valkyrie and Nitroseed.

Their song &quot;Dove-Tongued Aggressor&quot; was featured on the soundtrack for the 2005 video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot;.

Numerous songs by Spirit Caravan were also recorded as songs for The Obsessed. &quot;Kill Ugly Naked&quot; from Jug Fulla Sun appears on various demos and live recordings along with the &quot;Incarnate&quot; compilation. &quot;Fear&#x27;s Machine&quot; from Jug Fulla Sun was originally written for the Obsessed and appears on the &quot;Incarnate&quot; compilation. &quot;Melancholy Grey&quot; from Jug Fulla Sun was written in the same sessions as 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Church Within&quot; and appears on the 2013 reissue of that album. &quot;Higher Power&quot; from Dreamwheel appears on the Obsessed&#x27;s 1982 demo. &quot;Spirit Caravan&quot; from Elusive Truth appears on &quot;Incarnate&quot;. &quot;Lifer City&quot; from Elusive Truth appears on various demos and the unreleased Obsessed LP sent to Metal Blade.

Former Obsessed drummer Ed Gulli joined Spirit Caravan on drums for the Maryland Doom Fest in June 2015. He was replaced in 2016 by drummer Brian Costantino.

Wino announced in 2016 that Spirit Caravan would become the new lineup of The Obsessed.

<text>Santa Anita is a station on the Mexico City Metro. Located in Mexico City&#x27;s Iztacalco borough, the station is the current terminal of Line 4.

==General information==
The station logo depicts a man sailing a canoe. This is because in the early 20th century, in the area where the station now stands, was the Santa Anita canal – a place used for &quot;chinampa&quot;-based agriculture. Today the canal has long since vanished, but the name Santa Anita is still used by the surrounding neighborhood.

Metro Line 4 was originally projected to end in the Villa Coapa neighborhood, in the southern borough of Coyoacán. Since the inauguration of Line B, however, no more lines have been constructed or extended, so Metro Santa Anita – and other stations, such as Metro Barranca del Muerto – officially remain provisional terminals. Metro Santa Anita is the least busy station on the Mexico City Metro, with only 621,867 passenger boardings in 2008.

Santa Anita was originally to be named &quot;Plutarco E. Calles&quot;, in honor of President Plutarco Elías Calles, according to early plans for Line 4.
