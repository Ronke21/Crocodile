<text>Marcel Laurendeau is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Manitoba legislature from 1990 to 2003, representing the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in the south-end Winnipeg riding of St. Norbert.

== Political career ==
Laurendeau began his political career at the municipal level, having been elected to the Winnipeg City Council in 1988 (replacing John Angus, who had been elected to the provincial legislature). He was himself elected to the provincial legislature in the provincial election of 1990, defeating Liberal Angus by 117 votes. For the next five years, Laurendeau was a backbench supporter of Premier Gary Filmon.

He was briefly kidnapped in his car in 1992, and subsequently called for greater security on the legislative grounds. In 1993, he supported Jean Charest&#x27;s bid for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

Laurendeau was re-elected in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal challenger Val Thompson by 527 votes. He was named Deputy Speaker on May 23, 1995, and held this position for the entirety of the parliament which followed.

The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the provincial election of 1999, although Laurendeau himself was re-elected with an increased majority. The social-democratic New Democratic Party overtook the Liberals for second place in this cycle, as Marilyn Brick came within 670 votes of defeating Laurendeau. Laurendeau served as opposition House Leader in the following parliament.

The NDP&#x27;s strong showing in 1999 was regarded as surprising in some circles, as the party has not traditionally had a strong electoral base in south Winnipeg. The NDP targeted St. Norbert in the 2003 election, with the result that Brick beat Laurendeau in a rematch, 3355 votes to 2610. After his defeat, he joined the &quot;Arbitration and Mediation Institute of Manitoba&quot;.

Laurendeau supported Stockwell Day for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance party in 2000. He ran unsuccessfully for the St. Norbert seat on Winnipeg City council in 2005.

In 2010, he left the Conservatives claiming that the party had become too right wing. He switched to the Liberal Party and ran as that party&#x27;s candidate in the 2011 provincial election for his old riding of St. Norbert. Laurendeau finished third with 883 votes behind Dave Gaudreau of the NDP and Karen Velthuys of the Progressive Conservatives.

<text>Mona Bone Jakon is the third studio album by singer-songwriter Cat Stevens, released in April 1970 on the Island Records label in the United Kingdom and on A&amp;M in the United States and Canada.

==Overview==
After a meteoric start to his career, surprising even his original producer at Deram Records with the hit singles &quot;I Love My Dog&quot;, &quot;Matthew and Son&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Get Me a Gun&quot;, Stevens&#x27; debut album, &quot;Matthew and Son&quot;, began charting. However, after the pressure for a repeat album of the same calibre, Stevens, considered a young teen sensation, was overwhelmed by a new lifestyle as well as the demands of writing, recording, performing, publicity appearances, and touring. His second album was a commercial failure and in the autumn of 1968, he was hospitalized, with a diagnosis of tuberculosis and a collapsed lung. For over a year, while recovering, Stevens virtually disappeared from the British pop scene. &quot;Mona Bone Jakon&quot; is notable not only for his return but for the emergence of a very different artist. The album sold slowly (at first) but over time has been certified Gold for sales/shipments of more than 500,000 copies in the United States.

==Background==
During his hospital-dictated year of bedrest, Stevens began writing a catalogue of songs to fill far more than his next album. After his recovery, he negotiated out of his contract with Deram Records and worked with former Yardbirds bassist Paul Samwell-Smith on a stripped-down sound. In contrast to his first two albums, these new songs were sparse arrangements. They were played on acoustic guitars and keyboards and accompanied by a smaller backing band, consisting of three other performers: second guitarist Alun Davies, bassist John Ryan, and drummer Harvey Burns—and on one song, &quot;Katmandu&quot;, Peter Gabriel on the flute. Samwell-Smith also produced the album and brought Stevens a high-fidelity sound that was not as present on his previous releases. Samwell-Smith was one of the early producers in rock to push the lower bass frequencies more prominently into the mix in an attempt to keep up with the new audiophile generation, which was embracing larger home speakers and high-end phonographic cartridges. Stevens began to make the transition from pop musician to a folk-rock performer when the term &quot;singer-songwriter&quot; was just being coined.

The songs themselves were darker in tone: the madrigal-inspired ballad &quot;Lady D&#x27;Arbanville&quot; elevated the tragedy of a lost lover (in this case, Stevens&#x27; former girlfriend Patti D&#x27;Arbanville) to that of a deceased one and &quot;Trouble&quot; was a plea to stave off death. There were also lighter songs: &quot;Pop Star&quot; showcased Stevens&#x27; dramatic change in voice by satirising the triviality of celebrity.

Though &quot;Lady D&#x27;Arbanville&quot; would reach No. 8 on the British charts, &quot;Mona Bone Jakon&quot; was only a modest success upon its initial release. The album attracted attention, however, in the wake of the commercial breakthrough of its follow-up, &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot;, and with the inclusion of three of its songs (&quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;I Wish, I Wish&quot;, and &quot;I Think I See the Light&quot;) in Hal Ashby and Colin Higgins&#x27;s 1971 black comedy, &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;.

==Origin of title==
According to a 1972 interview with Stevens, the inspiration for the title was a name he created to describe his penis: &quot;&#x27;Mona Bone Jakon&#x27; is another name for my penis. It&#x27;s the name I give it. It&#x27;s not some sort of secret vocabulary, it&#x27;s just something I made up.&quot;

Journalist Robert Chalmers reiterated this point for a 2003 interview with Yusuf Islam for &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; when he wrote: &quot;When [Stevens] re-emerged in 1969, he had more than 40 new songs and released three triumphant albums in 15 months on Chris Blackwell&#x27;s Island label: &quot;Mona Bone Jakon&quot; (his pet word for penis), &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; and &quot;Teaser and the Firecat&quot;.&quot;

The symbolism of the cover artwork was related to Stevens&#x27; original intended title for the album, &quot;The Dustbin Cried the Day the Dustman Died&quot;.

==Critical reception==

In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+, noting that &quot;this one has a nice post-creative trauma feel, intimate and sensitive. Recommended to singer/songwriter specialists.&quot; Later, he revised his review to a B− and expressed a newfound dislike for the songs &quot;Lady D&#x27;Arbanville&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;, and &quot;I Wish, I Wish&quot;.

In a retrospective review, Allmusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann gave it four out of five stars and called it &quot;a group of simple, heartfelt songs played in spare arrangements on acoustic guitars and keyboards and driven by a restrained rhythm section&quot;. He added that &quot;Stevens&#x27; craggy voice, with its odd breaks of tone and occasional huskiness, lent these sometimes sketchy songs depth&quot;.

<doc id="1040355" wikidata="Q165578" url="?curid=1040355" title="Jack Zipes">
<text>Jack David Zipes (born June 7, 1937) is a literary scholar and author. He is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of German, Nordic, Slavic and Dutch at the University of Minnesota.

Zipes is known for his work on fairy tales, folklore, critical theory, 20th century literature, German literature, German Jewish culture and the political and cultural significance of the Brothers Grimm tales. He has authored, co-authored and edited 69 books including &quot;The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm&quot;, &quot;Buried Treasures: The Power of Political Fairy Tales&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Bet on the Prince&quot;. Among his honors are the Guggenheim Fellowship (1988), the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts Distinguished Scholar Award (1992), the National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship (1998), the International Brothers Grimm Award from the International Institute for Children&#x27;s Literature in Osaka, Japan (1999), the Folklore Society Katharine Briggs Award (2007), the Mythopoeic Scholarship Award (2012), the Chicago Folklore Prize (2015), and the World Fantasy Convention Award for Lifetime Achievement (2019).

Zipes is a Fellow of the American Folklore Society and the International Research Society for Children&#x27;s Literature (IRSCL). He was a Founding Editor of the &quot;New German Critique&quot;, and holds positions on the advisory boards for the &quot;Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature&quot;, &quot;Fairy Tale Review&quot; and &quot;Storytelling, Self, Society&quot;.

==Education==
Zipes earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Political Science from Dartmouth College in 1959, followed by a master&#x27;s degree in English and Comparative Literature from Columbia University in 1960. He went on to study at the University of Munich in 1962 and the University of Tübingen in 1963, receiving a PhD in Comparative Literature from Columbia University in 1965. His thesis was published as a book, &quot;The Great Refusal: Studies of the Romantic Hero in German and American Literature&quot;, in 1970 and was influenced by the works of Herbert Marcuse.

==Career==
Zipes began his academic career as an Instructor of American Literature at the University of Munich from 1966 to 1977. He became an Assistant Professor at the New York University German Department in 1967, and later joined the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee as an Associate Professor of German and Comparative Literature, staying there as Full Professor until 1986. From 1986 to 1989, he continued as a Professor at the University of Florida Department of Germanic and Slavic Languages and Literatures before moving to the University of Minnesota, where he has been serving as a Professor Emeritus in the Department of German, Nordic, Slavic and Dutch since 2008. He was awarded honorary doctorates by the Anglia Ruskin University (2019), the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee (2023), and the University of Winnipeg.

Zipes assumed the position of the Chair of the Department of German, Dutch, and Scandinavian from 1994 to 1998, later becoming the Director of the Center for German and European Studies from 1998 to 2002 and has been the Director of Graduate Studies since 1990.

Zipes was the Co-founder of the Neighborhood Bridges literacy program, a joint project of the University of Minneapolis and the Children&#x27;s Theatre Company, in 1997 and directed it until 2008. In 2018, he established Little Mole and Honey Bear, a publishing house specializing in unique books for children and adults primarily created between 1910 and 1940.

==Works==
Zipes has contributed to the field of literature by studying Jewish studies, German literature, children&#x27;s literature, and the influence of fairy tales, with arguments based on the critical theory of the Frankfurt School. 

===Socio-political impact of fairy tales===
Zipes has analyzed fairy tales to understand their importance in the modern world. Looking into the lasting impact of fairy tales on literature, he explored their evolution, socio-political context, and exploitation by media networks in the book &quot;Breaking the Magic Spell: Radical Theories of Folk &amp; Fairy Tales&quot;, which was called &quot;a stimulating contribution to the critical literature of folk and fairy tales&quot; by Edith Lazaros Honig in &quot;Children&#x27;s Literature Association Quarterly&quot;. He emphasized the genre&#x27;s broader cultural significance in &quot;Why Fairy Tales Stick: The Evolution and Relevance of a Genre&quot;, suggesting that fairy tales, as culturally repeated memes, have evolved alongside humans&#x27; cognitive development, exhibiting polygenic traits that transcend geographical boundaries. Kimberley Reynolds commented in the &quot;Modern Language Review&quot;, &quot;&quot;Why Fairy Tales Stick&quot; is both a welcome addition to the expanding area of books about fairy tales and a useful teaching resource.&quot;

Zipes compiled various stories in several works, including &quot;The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood: Versions of the Tale in Sociocultural Context&quot; and &quot;Beauties, Beasts, and Enchantment: Classic French Fairy Tales&quot;, presenting an account of lesser-known fairy tale versions and their contemporary relevance. He is also the Editor of the book series &quot;Oddly Modern Fairy Tales&quot; with Princeton University Press, comprising unusual literary fairy tales. Additionally, he published &quot;Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion&quot;, which Deborah Stevenson referred to as &quot;one of the key works of fairy-tale scholarship in our time&quot;, examining how fairy tales, through traditional forms and genres, have been used to shape children&#x27;s behavior, values, and societal roles.

Zipes researched the lives and works of the Brothers Grimm in detail, by translating and publishing books like &quot;The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World&quot; and &quot;Grimm Legacies: The Magic Spell of the Grimms&#x27; Folk and Fairy Tales&quot;, revealing their personal struggles, political endeavors, and contributions to establishing fairy tales as a significant literary form. He translated the complete 1857 edition of fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm in 1987, and in 2014, he published the first edition of 1812 and 1815 as &quot;The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm&quot; along with a new study of the tales, &quot;Grimm Legacies: The Magic Power of the Grimms&#x27; Folk and Fairy Tales&quot;. Furthermore, he delved into forgotten political fairy tales and profiles writers like Édouard Laboulaye and illustrators who addressed social and economic issues in &quot;Buried Treasures: The Power of Political Fairy Tales&quot;. In &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, the publication was regarded as &quot;a potent testament to the power of stories.&quot;

===German Jewish studies===
Zipes&#x27; work on German Jewish studies focused on the relationship between German literature and Jewish culture. His book entitled &quot;Yale Companion to Jewish Writing and Thought in German Culture, 1096-1996&quot;, provided a chronological history of Jewish writing and thought in German-speaking lands, showcasing the influence of Jewish writers on German culture. In a review for the &quot;Journal of European Studies&quot;, Joachim Whaley stated &quot;Gilman and Zipes have produced a marvellous compendium. Scholars will wish to return to it repeatedly.&quot;

In 1992, Zipes published &quot;The Operated Jew: Two Tales of Anti-Semitism&quot;, a translation of the stories &quot;The Operated Jew&quot; by Oskar Panizza and &quot;The Operated Goy&quot; by Mynona, investigating the themes of anti-Semitism and the pursuit of purity and perfection in turn-of-the-century Germany. In addition, he co-edited &quot;Unlikely History: The Changing German-Jewish Symbiosis,1945-2000&quot; with Leslie Morris, assessing Jewish life in postwar Germany, including community, culture, and the resurgence of anti-Semitism in Austria, offering insights into the evolving relationship between Jews and Germans. About it, Bjorn Krondofer remarked &quot;The co-editors Morris and Zipes have gathered an impressive list of contributors from different academic disciplines in the United States and Germany...&quot;.

<text>Mineral springs are naturally occurring springs that produce hard water, water that contains dissolved minerals. Salts, sulfur compounds, and gases are among the substances that can be dissolved in the spring water during its passage underground. In this they are unlike sweet springs, which produce soft water with no noticeable dissolved gasses. The dissolved minerals may alter the water&#x27;s taste. Mineral water obtained from mineral springs, and the precipitated salts such as Epsom salt have long been important commercial products.

Some mineral springs may contain significant amounts of harmful dissolved minerals, such as arsenic, and should not be drunk. Sulfur springs smell of rotten eggs due to hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is hazardous and sometimes deadly. It is a gas, and it usually enters the body when it is breathed in. The quantities ingested in drinking water are much lower and are not considered likely to cause harm, but few studies on long-term, low-level exposure have been done, .

The water of mineral springs is sometimes claimed to have therapeutic value. Mineral spas are resorts that have developed around mineral springs, where (often wealthy) patrons would repair to &quot;take the waters&quot; — meaning that they would drink (see hydrotherapy and water cure) or bathe in (see balneotherapy) the mineral water. Historical mineral springs were often outfitted with elaborate stone-works — including artificial pools, retaining walls, colonnades, and roofs — sometimes in the form of fanciful &quot;Greek temples&quot;, gazebos, or pagodas. Others were entirely enclosed within spring houses.

==Types==
For many centuries, in Europe, North America, and elsewhere, commercial proponents of mineral springs classified them according to the chemical composition of the water produced and according to the medicinal benefits supposedly accruing from each:

*Arsenical springs contained arsenic
*Lithia Springs contained lithium salts.
*Chalybeate springs contained salts of iron.
*Alum springs contained alum.
*Sulfur springs contained hydrogen sulfide gas (see also fumeroles).
*Salt (saline) springs contained salts of calcium, magnesium or sodium.
*Alkaline springs contained an alkali.
*Calcic springs contained lime (calcium hydroxide).
*Thermal (hot) springs could contain a high concentration of various minerals.
*Soda springs contained carbon dioxide gas (soda water).
*Radioactive springs contain traces of radioactive substances such as radium or uranium.

==Deposits==

Types of sedimentary rock – usually limestone (calcium carbonate) – are sometimes formed by the evaporation, or rapid precipitation, of minerals from spring water as it emerges, especially at the mouths of hot mineral springs. In cold mineral springs, the rapid precipitation of minerals results from the reduction of acidity when the gas bubbles out. (These mineral deposits can also be found in dried lakebeds.) Spectacular formations, including terraces, stalactites, stalagmites and &#x27;frozen waterfalls&#x27; can result (see, for example, Mammoth Hot Springs).

One light-colored porous calcite of this type is known as travertine and has been used extensively in Italy and elsewhere as building material. Travertine can have a white, tan, or cream-colored appearance and often has a fibrous or concentric &#x27;grain&#x27;.

Another type of spring water deposit, containing siliceous as well as calcareous minerals, is known as tufa. Tufa is similar to travertine but is even softer and more porous.

Chaybeate springs may deposit iron compounds such as limonite. Some such deposits were large enough to be mined as iron ore.

<doc id="1040368" wikidata="Q11182116" url="?curid=1040368" title="Boukman Eksperyans">
<text>Boukman Eksperyans () is a &quot;mizik rasin&quot; band from the city of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Grammy nominated for their debut album &quot;Vodou Adjae&quot;. The band derives its name from Dutty Boukman, a &quot;vodou&quot; priest who led a religious ceremony in 1791 that is widely considered the start of the Haitian Revolution. The other half of the band&#x27;s name, &quot;Eksperyans&quot;, is the Haitian Creole word for &quot;experience&quot;, and was inspired by the band&#x27;s appreciation of the music of Jimi Hendrix. The band was at the height of its popularity in 1991 when the presidency of Jean Bertrand Aristide was overthrown in a military coup d&#x27;etat. Like many other artists and performers, Boukman Eksperyans fled the country to live in exile. During their time abroad, the band performed and spoke out against the military dictatorship of Raoul Cédras. In 1994, after Aristide was restored to power, the band returned to Haiti, where they continued to play concerts, record albums, and perform at the Carnival celebrations.

==History==

Boukman Eksperyans was founded in 1978 by Theodore Beaubrun Jr., nicknamed Lolo, Marjorie Beaubrun (Lolo&#x27;s sister), Daniel Beaubrun, Mimerose Beaubrun (nicknamed Manze, Lolo&#x27;s wife), and members of various other groups who launched the &quot;mizik rasin&quot; revolution in Haiti in the late 1970s. One of these groups was led by Fanfan Alexis, and included the future musicians of such groups as Group Sa, Foula, and Rara Machine. Lolo&#x27;s father, (also known by his stage name Languichatte Debordus) was a comedian and was often referred to as the Bill Cosby of Haiti. While on tour in the United States, he brought back a James Brown LP which left a lasting impression on young Lolo. After his parents divorced, he followed his mother to Brooklyn, New York. He studied in the United States.

Lolo returned to Haiti in 1978, where some bands were playing music known as &quot;minidjaz&quot;. To Lolo, they seemed to pay no attention to song lyrics that dealt with reality. They were even accused of aligning too closely to the Duvaliers. When Lolo and Mimerose began to seek their musical goals, they felt a strong desire to incorporate the African element in Haiti&#x27;s culture into their music. They decided to combine roots music with &quot;vodou&quot; religious and musical traditions.

Lolo&#x27;s grandfather was deeply involved in &quot;vodou&quot;, but his parents never made this available to him. Lolo and Mimerose entered their first &quot;vodou lakou-s&quot;, a Haitian spiritual community, where they met musicians and singers. They also got their first real glance at the African culture of Haiti in the form it was handed down from members of various tribes. They founded a group to study &quot;vodou&quot; music, giving it the name of &quot;Moun Ife&quot; (&quot;People of the Abode of the Deities&quot;). Lolo stated that Bob Marley was another important musical inspiration. When he heard the Jamaican legend in 1976, he thought he could create something similar in Haiti with &quot;vodou&quot;. Lolo and Mimerose began to perform as a live act in the 1980s.

The traditional roots instruments were replaced by electric instruments, like the bass guitar and two guitars played by members Eddy François and Daniel Beaubrun, Lolo&#x27;s brother and the band&#x27;s chief arranger. Fanfan Alexis, the group&#x27;s first guitarist, suggested the name &quot;Boukman&quot;, which Lolo and Manze liked. The name was a tribute to the Jamaican slave leader Boukman Dutty, who launched the Haitian slave rebellion in August 1791. &quot;Eksperyans&quot; was chosen in honor of Jimi Hendrix and his band the Jimi Hendrix Experience.

Boukman Eksperyans first became famous in 1990 when they presented their song &quot;Ké-M Pa Sote&quot; at the Carnival celebration in Port-au-Prince. The song included the refrain &quot;My heart doesn&#x27;t leap, you don&#x27;t scare me&quot;. This song was a protest against the post-Duvalier interim military government of General Prosper Avril. Armed soldiers appeared, trying to prevent the band from performing &quot;Ké-M Pa Sote&quot; and other censored songs. After a young girl was shot dead by a soldier, this song became an out-and-out battle hymn admonishing the government. The band continued to write and perform rebellious songs. The band members were never directly threatened, but were advised &#x27;never go out at night&#x27;. When the military &quot;junta&quot; overthrew president Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991, the band decided to leave the country for their own safety.

The band achieved international fame in the early 1990s. Their first album &quot;Vodou Adjae&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1991.

Just before the second coup d&#x27;état against Aristide in 2004, Lolo joined with many others in protesting the abuses at the very least condoned by the President. In the years following, Boukman Eksperyans was not associated with any political party. Their songs depicted the reality of Haiti as they saw it.

In 2022, Boukman Eksperyans went on a US/Europe arena tour in support of Arcade Fire.

<text>Pitchfork (formerly Pitchfork Media) is an American online music magazine founded in 1996 by Ryan Schreiber in Minneapolis. It originally covered alternative and independent music, and expanded to cover genres including pop, hip-hop, jazz and metal. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; is one of the most influential music publications to have emerged in the internet age.

In the 2000s, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; distinguished itself from print media through its unusual editorial style, frequent updates and coverage of emerging acts. It was praised as passionate, authentic and unique, but criticized as pretentious, mean-spirited and elitist, playing into stereotypes of the cynical hipster. It is credited with popularizing acts such as Arcade Fire, Broken Social Scene, Bon Iver and Sufjan Stevens.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; relocated to Chicago in 1999 and Brooklyn, New York, in 2011. It expanded with projects including the annual Pitchfork Music Festival (launched in Chicago in 2006), the video site Pitchfork.tv (launched in 2008), the 2008 book &quot;The Pitchfork 500&quot;, and a print publication, &quot;The Pitchfork Review&quot; (published between 2013 and 2016). In later years, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; became less antagonistic and more professional in style, and began covering more mainstream music and issues of gender, race and identity. As of 2014, it was receiving around 6.2 million unique visitors every month.

The influence of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; declined in the 2010s with the growth of streaming and social media. In 2015, it was acquired by the mass media company Condé Nast and moved to One World Trade Center. The &quot;Pitchfork&quot; president, Chris Kaskie, left in 2017, followed by Schreiber in 2019. In 2024, Condé Nast announced plans to merge &quot;Pitchfork&quot; into the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;GQ&quot;, resulting in layoffs and the closure of Pitchfork Music Festival. The merge drew criticism and triggered concern about the implications for music journalism.

==History==
=== 1996–2003: Early years ===
&quot;Pitchfork&quot; was created in February 1996 by Ryan Schreiber, a high school graduate living in his parents&#x27; home in Minneapolis. Schreiber grew up listening to indie rock acts such as Fugazi, Jawbox and Guided by Voices. He was influenced by fanzine culture and had no previous writing experience. 

Schreiber initially named the website &quot;Turntable&quot;, but changed it after another website claimed the rights. The name &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was inspired by the tattoo on the assassin Tony Montana in the film &quot;Scarface&quot;. Schreiber chose it as it was concise and had &quot;evilish overtones&quot;. The first review was of &quot;Pacer&quot; (1995) by the Amps, and the record store Insound was &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s first advertiser.

Early &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviews focused on indie rock and were often critical. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; described them as &quot;brutal&quot; and &quot;merciless&quot;, writing: &quot;The site&#x27;s stable of critics often seemed capricious, uninvested, sometimes spiteful, assigning low scores on a signature 10-point scale with punitive zeal.&quot; Schreiber said the site&#x27;s early period &quot;was about really laying into people who really deserved it&quot;, and defended the importance of honesty in arts criticism. In 1999, Schreiber relocated &quot;Pitchfork&quot; to Chicago. He estimated that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had published 1,000 reviews by this point.

Around the turn of the millennium, the American music press was dominated by monthly print magazines such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, creating a gap in the market for faster-moving publication that emphasized new acts. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; could publish several articles a day, greatly outpacing print media. New technologies such as MP3, the iPod and the file-sharing service Napster created greater access to music, and music blogs became an important resource, creating further opportunity for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. The contributors Mark Richardson and Eric Harvey said this was an important part of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s early popularity, as music fans could share and listen to new music while reading daily updates.

In 2000, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s 10.0/10.0 review of the highly anticipated Radiohead album &quot;Kid A&quot;, written by Brent DiCrescenzo, generated a surge in readership and was one of the first signs of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; becoming a major publication. One of the first &quot;Kid A&quot; reviews published, it attracted attention for its unusual style. &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as &quot;extremely long-winded and brazenly unhinged from the journalistic form and temperament of the time&quot;. While it was widely mocked, it boosted &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s profile. Schreiber said he understood the review would make &quot;Pitchfork&quot; subject to ridicule, but &quot;wanted &quot;Pitchfork&quot; to be daring and to surprise people&quot;. In 2001, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had 30,000 daily readers.

=== 2004–2005: Growing influence and professional growth ===
In 2004, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; hired its first full-time employee, Chris Kaskie, formerly of the satirical website &quot;The Onion&quot;, to run business operations. Kaskie later became the president and co-owner. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s first professional editor, Scott Plagenhoef, was hired shortly afterwards. Kaskie and Plagenhoef are credited for turning &quot;Pitchfork&quot; into a professional operation. It began to scale quickly, investing in the more money it made, the more resources it had for reviews and articles. 

As of 2004, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had eight full-time employees and about 50 freelance staff members, most of whom worked remotely and co-ordinated through phone and internet. Writers were unpaid for their first six months, after which they could earn $10 or $20 for a review or $40 for a feature. In 2004, following staff tensions about Schreiber&#x27;s advertising income, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; started paying writers from their first articles at a slightly improved rate.

That year, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; published a positive review of the debut album by Arcade Fire, &quot;Funeral&quot;. The album became a bestseller and is cited as the first major example of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s influence on independent music, attracting coverage of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; from outlets such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. The contributor Jess Weiss said the review &quot;changed everything&quot;. By 2005, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was attracting around one million readers a month, with an annual revenue of around $5 million. That year, Schreiber said he was uninterested in selling &quot;Pitchfork:&quot; &quot;It would change into the antithesis of the reason I started it. This is something I am so in love with—this is my entire adult life&#x27;s work.&quot;

=== 2006–2010: Expanding operations ===

By 2006, traditional music media, such as print magazines, music video channels and radio stations, had declined or changed focus, but music listeners still sought a reliable source of recommendations. Without the limitations of print media, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was able to champion emerging independent acts that major print magazines, which had to sell millions of copies every year, could not. Schreiber felt the magazines were &quot;not even trying to discover new music ... Publications used to take more chances on artists, putting bands on the cover that they thought deserved to be there.&quot; He said &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was able to take risks as it was not interested in appeasing bands, record labels or advertisers.

In 2006, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had 170,000 daily readers and was publishing five album reviews a day, with six full-time employees. Schreiber said that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was able to sustain paid freelancers and eight employees, though they were &quot;always cutting it close&quot;. He said he had attracted interest from investors, but wanted to retain control and that journalistic integrity was his priority. In August 2006, an internal &quot;Pitchfork&quot; server containing promotional copies of hundreds of albums was hacked, including the forthcoming Joanna Newsom album &quot;Ys.&quot;

In the mid-2000s, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; expanded its operations. In 2006, it launched the annual Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago. The first Paris Pitchfork Music Festival was held in 2011. Kaskie said it was exciting to see acts &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had championed playing to large crowds: &quot;We start to see these bands playing in front of audiences 10 times the size of their biggest show ever. That&#x27;s the goal, man. To put fucking Titus Andronicus in front of 10,000 people.&quot; In April 2008, after acquiring the live music show &quot;Juan&#x27;s Basement&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; launched &quot;Pitchfork.tv&quot;, a website displaying interviews, music videos and feature-length films. In November, it published a book, &quot;The Pitchfork 500&quot;, covering the preceding 30 years of music. 

By the end of the 2000s, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had become influential in the music industry, credited for launching acts such as Arcade Fire and Bon Iver. Employees at record labels and record stores would use it to anticipate interest in acts. It was also attracting large sponsors such as American Express and Apple.

=== 2010–2014: Diversification, declining influence and sister publications ===
The influence of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; on music careers declined around the turn of the decade, as streaming and social media fractured audiences and reduced the need for gatekeepers. Streaming services began to fulfill &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s function of helping new artists find audiences, and independent music criticism moved to podcasts and YouTube. Declining music industry revenues reduced advertising spending, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; faced competition from advertisers such as Facebook. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The internet era that birthed &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s blend of saucy writing, outre tastes and massive popularity [was] by and large over.&quot; 

Over the following decade, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; shifted its editorial range and style. It began running news and features alongside reviews, coming to resemble a more conventional music publication. It also diversified from indie rock to cover mainstream music including pop, rap and metal, and began covering issues of gender, race and identity in music, influenced by movements such as MeToo and Black Lives Matter. Schreiber said that &quot;our tastes broadened with age and experience&quot;, and that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; could make a difference to social causes.

In July 2010, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; launched &quot;Altered Zones&quot;, a blog aggregator devoted to underground and DIY music. In 2011, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; relocated to Brooklyn, New York. On May 21, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; announced a partnership with the website &quot;Kill Screen&quot;, in which &quot;Pitchfork&quot; would publish some of their articles. &quot;Altered Zones&quot; closed on November 30. On December 26, 2012, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; launched &quot;Nothing Major&quot;, a website that covered visual arts, which closed in October 2013. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; launched a film website, &quot;The Dissolve&quot;, in 2013. It closed in 2015, citing &quot;financial challenges&quot;. In 2017, Kaskie said he remained proud of &quot;The Dissolve&quot; and that it was &quot;a huge success from the creative and editorial, design and everything else&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; won the National Magazine Award for general excellence in digital media. That year, the rapper Chief Keef was arrested for violating a probation sentence by using a rifle in a promotional video by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. Staff later described the episode as a low point and an example of how &quot;Pitchfork&quot; mishandled hip-hop artists. In December, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; launched &quot;The Pitchfork Review&quot;, a quarterly print journal focused on long-form music writing and design-focused content. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; planned a limited-edition quarterly publication of about 10,000 copies of each issue, printed on glossy, high-quality paper. About two thirds of the content would be original, with the remaining reused from the &quot;Pitchfork&quot; website. The &quot;International Business Times&quot; likened the literary aspirations to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and the &quot;Paris Review&quot;. &quot;The Pitchfork Review&quot; ended after 11 issues in November 2016.

As of 2014, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was receiving around 6.2 million unique visitors and 40 million pageviews every month, with an expected annual revenue growth of 25 to 40 percent. Its primary revenue came from advertising. According to the media analytics firm Comscore, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had 2.47 million unique visitors that August, more than the websites for &quot;Spin&quot; or &quot;Vibe&quot; but fewer than &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 11 million. By this point, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was facing mounting financial problems, and Kaskie spent the year searching for funding.

=== 2015–2016: Purchase by Condé Nast ===

On October 13, 2015, the American mass media company Condé Nast announced that it had acquired &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. At this point, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had about 50 employees, with editorial and video production staff in Brooklyn and advertising, sales and development staff in Chicago. The Condé Nast CEO, Bob Sauerberg, described &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as a &quot;distinguished digital property that brings a strong editorial voice, an enthusiastic and young audience, a growing video platform and a thriving events business&quot;. Kaskie said &quot;our needs and wants were converging&quot;, and that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; needed capital and expertise to expand its publication and festivals. The sale boosted &quot;Pitchfork&#x27;s&quot; value to advertisers. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; relocated to the Condé Nast offices in One World Trade Center, Manhattan. Previously, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s independence had been a key aspect of its image. Schreiber said it would continue to have &quot;creative independence&quot;. The acquisition triggered concern; the &quot;New York Observer&quot; wrote that was a &quot;death knell for indie rock&quot;. 

The Condé Nast chief digital officer, Fred Santarpia, was criticized when he said the acquisition would bring &quot;a very passionate audience of millennial males into our roster&quot;. The &quot;Atlantic&quot; connected the comment to a 2014 Nielsen report that found that millennial men were heavy music listeners and were more interested in streaming services than other demographics. In 2012, a &quot;Pitchfork&quot; poll asking readers to vote for their favorite music found that 88% of respondents were male, and statistics recorded by Quantcast in 2015 found that 82% of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; readers were men, most aged 18–34. Schreiber responded on Twitter that women were &quot;a huge part of &quot;Pitchfork&#x27;s&quot; staff and readership&quot; and that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; aimed to reach &quot;all music fans everywhere&quot;. 

On March 13, 2016, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; launched its first new design since 2011. That October, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had 4.1 million unique visitors, up from 2.7 million the previous October. With Schreiber aiming to make it the world&#x27;s best repository for music content, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; began creating videos and retrospective articles, covering classic albums released before its founding.

=== 2017–2023: Departures of Kaskie and Schreiber ===

Kaskie announced his departure from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in May 2017. He had been frustrated by his diminished role under Condé Nast and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s reduced autonomy. On September 18, 2018, Schreiber stepped down as the top editor. He was replaced by Puja Patel, who had worked at &quot;Spin&quot; and Gawker Media, as editor-in-chief on October 15. Schreiber remained as a strategic advisor. He said he later realized that Condé Nast did not understand &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and had unrealistic expectations of its performance. 

Patel came under pressure to cut costs amid declining traffic from social media, and competition from streaming platforms, which offered a new means for listeners to discover music. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; staff conflicted with Condé Nast over its attempts to monetize Pitchfork Music Festival by making it into a &quot;luxury&quot; experience. Santarpia left Condé Nast in 2018, leaving &quot;Pitchfork&quot; under the purview of Anna Wintour, the chief content officer. Two former &quot;Pitchfork&quot; staffers told &quot;The Verge&quot; that Wintour did not care about music or understand the internet.

Schreiber announced his departure on January 8, 2019, saying he wanted to &quot;keep pushing boundaries and exploring new things&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the departure came at a time of &quot;existential change&quot; for the media industries, citing the rise of streaming services and social media and the downsizing of many major music publications. That month, Condé Nast announced it would put all its publications, including &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, behind a paywall by the end of the year. It abandoned experiments with &quot;Pitchfork&quot; paywalls following criticism from readers. In 2020, Condé Nast laid off the executive editor Matthew Schnipper and the features editor and union chair Stacey Anderson. In 2022 and 2023, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had about three million unique visitors a month, down by about 36% from 2021.

=== 2024: Merge into &quot;GQ&quot; and layoffs ===
On January 17, 2024, Wintour announced that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; would merge with the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;GQ&quot;. Staff including Patel were laid off, leaving around a dozen editorial staff, including some working on multiple Condé Nast publications. Max Tani of &quot;Semafor&quot; reported that the remaining staff were &quot;depressed and embarrassed&quot; by the merge. One writer who was laid off, Andy Cush, said &quot;there was this real sense of despair ... about ever having a place to do the kind of work you feel like you&#x27;re good at and that you&#x27;re interested in again&quot;. As of that month, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had the most daily active users of any Condé Nast publication.

Journalists reacted with sadness and concern for the future of music journalism. Tani and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Chris Richards expressed disgust that &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, once independent and provocative, would be absorbed into an establishment men&#x27;s magazine. The music critic Ann Powers wrote that the merge felt &quot;like a highly conservative move at a time when music has proven to be one of our culture&#x27;s most beautifully progressive spaces&quot;. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Laura Snapes wrote that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had provided a vital &quot;leading example&quot; and doubted that specialist music journalism could survive without it. She lamented the job losses, saying that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had been one of the last stable employers of freelance music writers. Schreiber said that commentators were &quot;premature to eulogize &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&quot;, as it retained a skeleton crew continuing its mission, and said he was pleased with the work it had published since the announcement. 

On July 2, 2024, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named Mano Sundaresan, the founder of the music blog &quot;No Bells&quot;, as the new head of editorial content. Sundaresan denied that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was &quot;going away&quot;, and said he aimed to adapt it to modern media and cater to more specialized audiences. That October, five former &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writers launched the music site &quot;Hearing Things&quot;, which aims to &quot;capture the original independent spirit&quot; of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. In November, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; announced that it had canceled Pitchfork Music Festival but would continue to produce events and &quot;create spaces where music, culture, and community intersect&quot;.

== Style ==
&quot;Pitchfork&#x27;s&quot; unusual, passionate and stylized reviews differentiated it from the more scholarly and formal style of print magazines such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The critic Steven Hyden said it offered an alternative to music magazines at the end of the 20th century, which were publishing content about &quot;Star Wars&quot;, nu metal and pop punk. He characterized the &quot;Pitchfork&quot; voice as that of the outsider mocking the mainstream. In &quot;The Verge&quot;, Elizabeth Lopatto wrote that early reviews were brash, unprofessional and often bizarre, but that this distinguished &quot;Pitchfork&quot; from traditional media and made it fun to read. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; contributors said it was immediately divisive among music fans.

In the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, J. Freedom du Lac described &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as entertaining, &quot;hilariously snarky&quot; and &quot;occasionally even enlightening&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer August Brown described it as &quot;raucous, passionate, sometimes blinkered but always evolving&quot;. In &quot;Slate&quot;, Matthew Shaer wrote that the best &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviews were &quot;cagey, fierce, witty and graceful&quot;. The journalist Dave Itzkoff described &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviews as &quot;defiantly passionate and frustratingly capricious&quot; with an &quot;aura of integrity and authenticity that made such pronouncements credible, even definitive, to fans ... insinuating themselves into the grand tradition of rock criticism, joining the ranks of imperious and opinionated writers&quot;. Schreiber described the reviews of one early &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer, Brent DiCrescenzo, as dense with dialogue and pop culture references, &quot;exploring outlandish scenarios&quot;.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s style changed in the 2010s as it broadened its scope and audience, shifting to poptimism. The contributor Craig Jenkins said &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had needed to change its &quot;walled-in&quot; perspective, and that it had been &quot;antagonistic toward the stuff that the average person would be appreciating&quot;. Plagenhoef felt that the inflammatory &quot;stunt reviews&quot; were limiting, and wanted &quot;Pitchfork&quot; to be seen as trustworthy and thoughtful. Snapes said some had lamented the change, suggesting that it made &quot;Pitchfork&quot; &quot;a less specific proposition&quot;. However, she felt it reflected modern music consumption and found it heartening that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was reviewing a variety of genres and artists. Under Puja Patel, who became the editor in 2018, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; covered more female, non-binary, queer and non-white artists.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; also switched to a more professional style. The editor Amy Phillips illustrated this by comparing her coverage of the announcement of two Radiohead albums, years apart; the first was excitable, whereas the second was more professional and factual. In 2014, the contributor Nate Patrin said &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had become &quot;what publications like the &quot;Village Voice&quot; used to be in terms of letting writers go deep without feeling pressured to talk down to readers&quot;, with long-form articles and documentaries. By 2017, according to Bloomberg, its reviews had become &quot;as erudite as those of the music magazines that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had all but eclipsed in influence&quot;.

In 2024, the critic Ann Powers wrote that &quot;in the past decade &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had nurtured many of the best and most influential writers working today&quot;. She felt that &quot;great music writing messes with productivity by creating a space to slow down and really immerse in someone else&#x27;s creative work ... The best writing at &quot;Pitchfork&quot; or anywhere reflects that process and is as variegated as the human experience itself.&quot; In 2015, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Guardian&quot; credited &quot;Pitchfork&quot; for pioneering design techniques that combined print design and technical innovation to create the impression of a &quot;forward-facing, vibrant title&quot;.

== Review system ==
By 2021, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had published more than 28,000 reviews. Its reviews do not represent an editorial consensus but the opinion of the individual reviewer. Writers who did not want to use their names, or failed to include bylines with their submissions, were credited as Ray Suzuki, similarly to the filmmaker pseudonym Alan Smithee.

Unlike other music publications, which typically assign scores out of five or ten, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; uses a decimal scale of 0.0 to 10.0. The system has drawn mockery as arbitrary and overprecise. DiCrescenzo described it as &quot;knowingly silly&quot;, and in 2021 &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that it was an &quot;admittedly absurd and subjective&quot; signature element. Schreiber said he liked its absurdity and how &quot;it felt kind of scientific without any actual science to it&quot;. Early reviews used percentages rather than decimals.

In &quot;The Ringer&quot;, Rob Harvilla wrote that a 10.0 from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; &quot;carries all the historical weight of five stars in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; or five mics in &quot;The Source&quot; ... with its maddening and theoretically precise approach to decimal places, such that an ocean of feeling separates an 8.1 from an 8.9&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; has awarded perfect scores to more than 50 albums, most of them in its &quot;Sunday Reviews&quot; feature, which publishes retrospective reviews of classic albums. Artists who have received perfect scores on release include Radiohead, Fiona Apple, Kanye West, Bonnie &quot;Prince&quot; Billy, And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead and Wilco. According to Harvilla, a perfect score given to an album on release &quot;qualifies as a seismic event for the rock-critic universe as a whole&quot;.

Some reviews experimented with the score system. The 2005 Robert Pollard album &quot;Relaxation of the Asshole&quot; received a simultaneous 10 and 0; the review for the 2007 Radiohead album &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, which allowed fans to pay what they wanted to download, allowed readers to enter their own score. After &quot;Pitchfork&quot; changed its content management system to require a number, these albums were given fixed scores.

== Criticism ==

=== Prose ===
In the 2000s, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviews were criticized as pretentious, verbose and inaccurate. Itzkoff wrote that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was overwrought and sometimes hard to understand, with an abundance of adjectives, adverbs and misused words. Shaer identified examples of &quot;verbose and unreadable writing ... dense without being insightful, personal without being interesting&quot;. In &quot;City Pages&quot;, Lindsey Thomas wrote that its prose was florid and sometimes impenetrable, and contained factual errors. Similar criticisms came from Rob Harvilla of the &quot;East Bay Express&quot; and Claire Suddath of &quot;Time&quot;. Responding to criticism in 2006, Schreiber said he trusted his writers&#x27; style and opinions.

=== Elitism ===
In its early years, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was criticized as mean-spirited and elitist, and for publishing reviews that do not meaningfully discuss the music, playing into stereotypes of the cynical hipster. In 2018, the music journalist Robert Christgau described the early years of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as &quot;a snotty boys&#x27; club open to many &#x27;critics&#x27; ... Too many amateur wise-asses and self-appointed aesthetes throwing their weight around.&quot;

Many scathing early reviews were by Brent DiCrescenzo, who wrote lengthy reviews that rarely addressed the music. For example, his review of the 2001 Tool album &quot;Lateralus&quot; consisted mostly of a list of the equipment used by the drummer. Some reviews consist only of single images or videos, implying the record is beneath critical analysis. Shaer wrote in 2006 that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; typically triumphed acts it had &quot;discovered&quot; and attacked beloved legacy acts and bands popular on music blogs. Some believed that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; deliberately waited for excitement to build around an act before dismissing it with a critical review.

Itzkoff argued that the obtuse and confrontational style was part of the &quot;Pitchfork&quot; business model and made their reviews memorable. He suggested that the writers&#x27; lack of training or experience, and the fact that they worked for low or no pay, created a sense of authenticity and undermined the authority of traditional media. Schreiber conceded that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; had a reputation for snobbery, but said its writers were &quot;really just honest, opinionated music fans&quot;.

=== Race and gender ===
In the 2000s, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was criticized for focusing on music made by white men. In its early years, its staff comprised almost entirely white men. In 2007, the rapper M.I.A. criticized &quot;Pitchfork&quot; for assuming that her album &quot;Kala&quot; had been produced entirely by the male producer Diplo. Another &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer described the error as &quot;perpetuating the male-led ingenue myth&quot;. M.I.A. and the singer Björk argued that this was part of a wider problem of journalists assuming that female artists do not write or produce their own music. In 2024, the &quot;Pitchfork&quot; contributor Andrew Nosnitsky argued that hip-hop, not indie rock, was the &quot;defining music&quot; of his generation, but that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was viewed as the defining music publication for &quot;purely mechanical and straight-up white-supremacy reasons&quot;.

=== Parodies ===
&quot;Pitchfork&quot; has attracted multiple parodies. In 2005, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; invited the comedian David Cross to write a list of his favorite albums. Cross wrote that he was surprised by the invitation, citing several insulting &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviews of his comedy albums, and instead wrote a &quot;withering and absurdist&quot; article titled &quot;Albums to listen to while reading overwrought &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviews&quot;. In 2007, the satirical website &quot;The Onion&quot; published a piece in which &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewed music as a whole and gave it a score of 6.8. The music blog &quot;Idolator&quot; ran a feature asking readers to guess which lines came from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviews and which were fabricated. In 2010, the writer David Shapiro started a Tumblr blog, &quot;Pitchfork Reviews Reviews&quot;, which reviewed &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviews and assessed their arguments. It attracted more than 100,000 followers and a profile in the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

== Influence ==

Spencer Kornhaber of the &quot;Atlantic&quot; described &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as the most influential music publication to emerge in the internet age. Itzkoff, a former editor for &quot;Spin&quot;, described the &quot;Spin&quot; staff checking &quot;Pitchfork&quot; regularly: &quot;If it was lavishing attention on a new band, we at least had to ask ourselves why we weren&#x27;t doing the same: by then, our value as a trustworthy and consistent filter had waned.&quot; The online magazine &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; emulated &quot;Pitchfork&quot; early on, &quot;especially as it came to creating an editorial voice, developing a consistent content strategy, and packaging a love of music in a compelling way&quot;, according to its founder, Alex Young. 

The critic Carl Wilson said &quot;Pitchfork&quot; drove a &quot;feeding frenzy about band discovery&quot; in North American music journalism, with publications vying to discover new acts. In the 2000s, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was credited with &quot;making or breaking&quot; musical careers, a phenomenon known as the &quot;&quot;Pitchfork&quot; effect&quot;. In 2006, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; described Schreiber as an &quot;indie-rock kingmaker&quot; and wrote that &quot;an endorsement from &quot;Pitchfork ...&quot; is very valuable, indeed&quot;. Megan Jasper, the CEO of the record label Sub Pop, said favorable &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviews would boost sales and that it became normal for indie rock bands to sell 100,000 records, exceeding expectations. Poorly reviewed albums made no impact.

After &quot;Pitchfork&quot; awarded 9.7 to the debut album by Arcade Fire, &quot;Funeral&quot; (2004), it became the fastest-selling record in the history of Merge Records. Other acts whose careers were boosted by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in the 2000s include the Dismemberment Plan, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Modest Mouse, Broken Social Scene, Bon Iver and Sufjan Stevens. Schreiber said they wanted to create a roster of artists whom people discovered through and associated with &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. Plagenhoef downplayed &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s influence on musical careers, saying it merely &quot;accelerated the process&quot;.

After &quot;Pitchfork&quot; awarded 0.0 to &quot;Travistan&quot; (2004), the debut solo album by the Dismemberment Plan singer Travis Morrison, his solo career effectively ended. Years later, Morrison described the experience as &quot;frightening and awful&quot;. Schreiber said he felt bad for him, but that it was important for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writers to be honest. Other albums to receive 0.0 include &quot;Zaireeka&quot; (1995) by the Flaming Lips, &quot;NYC Ghosts &amp; Flowers&quot; (2000) by Sonic Youth, &quot;Liz Phair&quot; (2003) by Liz Phair and &quot;Shine On&quot; (2006) by Jet. The Jet review consisted entirely of a video of a chimp urinating into its own mouth and was widely shared. The authors of the Phair and Sonic Youth reviews later changed their opinions and apologized to the artists.

In &quot;Slate&quot;, Amos Barshad cited the band Black Kids as the most infamous example of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; &quot;at its most deleterious&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s review of their debut EP, &quot;Wizard of Ahhhs&quot;, boosted the Black Kids&#x27; career; however, it collapsed when &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave their debut album, &quot;Partie Traumatic&quot; (2008), a score of 3.3, with a review consisting entirely of a photograph of two frowning dogs and a frowning emoticon. Plagenhoef said &quot;Pitchfork&quot; later became more cautious in publishing negative reviews, as they were no longer &quot;little guys on the internet throwing rocks at big artists&quot;. 

The influence of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; on musical careers declined with the onset of streaming and social media in the 2010s. In 2017, a senior editor for independent music at the streaming platform Spotify said that &quot;Pitchfork&quot; no longer had the same impact on musical careers. However, according to Tani, &quot;Even as its Gen-X and old millennial fans aged and tastemaking shifted to platforms and influencers, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; remained the premier publication for music criticism, its year-end lists synonymous with critical acclaim.&quot;

<text>Babbitt metal or bearing metal is any of several alloys used for the bearing surface in a plain bearing.

The original Babbitt alloy was invented in 1839 by Isaac Babbitt in Taunton, Massachusetts, United States. He disclosed one of his alloy recipes but kept others as trade secrets. Other formulations were developed later. Like other terms whose eponymous origin is long since deemphasized (such as &quot;diesel engine&quot; or &quot;eustachian tube&quot;), the term &quot;babbitt metal&quot; is frequently styled in lowercase. It is preferred over the term &quot;white metal&quot;, because that term refers to zinc die-casting metal, to lead-based alloys, to tin-based alloys, and to the bearing metal.

Babbitt metal is most commonly used as a thin surface layer in a complex, multi-metal assembly, but its original use was as a cast-in-place bulk bearing material. Babbitt metal is characterized by its resistance to galling. Babbitt metal is soft and easily damaged, which suggests that it might be unsuitable for a bearing surface. However, its structure is made up of small hard crystals dispersed in a softer metal, which makes it, technically, a metal matrix composite. As the bearing wears, the softer metal erodes somewhat, creating paths for lubricant between the hard high spots that provide the actual bearing surface. When tin is used as the softer metal, friction causes the tin to melt and function as a lubricant, protecting the bearing from wear when other lubricants are absent.

Internal combustion engines use Babbitt metal which is primarily tin-based because it can withstand cyclic loading.

==Traditional Babbitt bearings==
In the traditional style of a babbitt metal bearing, a cast iron pillow block is assembled as a loose fit around the shaft, with the shaft in its approximate final position. The inner face of the cast iron pillow block is often drilled to form a key to locate the bearing metal as it is cast into place. The shaft is coated with soot as a release agent, the ends of the bearing are packed with clay to form a mold, and molten metal is poured into the cavity around the shaft, initially filling the lower half of the pillow block. The bearing is stripped, and the metal trimmed back to the top surface of the pillow block. Solidified babbitt metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife or sharp chisel.

A steel shim is inserted to protect the face of the lower bearing and to space the cap of the pillow block away from the shaft. After resealing the ends with clay, more metal is then poured to fill the cap of the pillow block through the hole in the top of the pillow block cap, which will eventually become a lubrication port.

The two halves of the bearing are then split at the shim, the shim removed, the oil holes cleared of metal and oil ways are cut into the surface of the new bearing. The shaft is smeared with engineer&#x27;s blue and rotated in the bearing. When the bearing is disassembled the blue fills the hollows and is rubbed off the high spots, making them visible. The high spots are scraped down, and the process repeated, until a uniform and evenly distributed pattern of blue shows when the shaft is removed. The bearing is then cleaned and lubricated, and shimmed up such that the shaft is held firmly but not binding in the bearing. The bearing is then &quot;run in&quot; by being run heavily lubricated at low load and slow revolution, completing the process of exposing the hard bearing surface. After final adjustment of the shimming, a very reliable and high load capability bearing results. 

Before the advent of low cost electric motors, power was distributed through factories from a central engine via overhead shafts running in hundreds of Babbitt bearings. Often leather, fabric or rubber belts would be used to transfer this rotating power to working machines.

The expression a &quot;run bearing&quot; also derives from this style of bearing, since failure of lubrication will lead to heat build-up due to friction in the bearing, eventually leading to the bearing metal melting and running out of the pillow block.

==Modern Babbitt bearings==
Until the mid-1950s, poured Babbitt bearings were common in automotive applications. The Babbitt was poured into the block or caps using a form. Tin-based Babbitts were used, as they could stand up to the impact loads found on the connecting rods and crankshaft. The poured Babbitt bearings were kept thin. The rods and caps would have shims that could be peeled off as the Babbitt wore down. Ford was known to use two 0.002&quot; on each cap and Babbitt that was 86% tin, 7% copper, 7% antimony (see the KRW catalogs for the Model T). Steel shims were used, as the brass shims used today tend to compress over time, contributing to shorter bearing life. The poured Babbitt bearings commonly get over 50,000 miles of use before needing replacement. Poured Babbitt bearings are also known to fail gracefully, allowing the car to be driven for extended periods of time. The failed bearing is not likely to damage the crankshaft.
The crankshaft and connecting-rod big-end bearings in current automobile engines are made of a replaceable steel shell, keyed to the bearing caps. The inner surface of the steel shell is plated with a coating of bronze, which is in turn coated with a thin layer of Babbitt metal as the bearing surface.

The process of laying down this layer of metal is known as Babbitting.

==Alternative bearings==
In many applications, rolling-element bearings, such as ball or roller bearings, have replaced Babbitt bearings. Though such bearings can offer a lower coefficient of friction than plain bearings, their key advantage is that they can operate reliably without a continuous pressurized supply of lubricant. Ball and roller bearings can also be used in configurations that are required to carry both radial and axial thrusts. However, rolling-element bearings lack the beneficial damping and shock-load capability provided by fluid-film bearings, such as the Babbitt.

==Babbitt alloys==

==The science of bearing Babbitt selection==
The engineering of a bearing&#x27;s Babbitt lining is usually completed during the design of the machine. In selecting the proper type of Babbitt for a particular job there are a number of factors to take into consideration, the most important of which are as follows:
# Surface speed of the shaft
# Load that the bearing is required to carry

There is no doubt that if a bearing is to be highly loaded in relation to its size, a high-tin alloy is desirable; whereas for much lower-speed work and less heavily loaded bearings, a lead-based Babbitt may be employed and is far more economical.

# Surface speed of the shaft (the number of feet traveled per minute by the shaft circumferentially):
#: Formula: &quot;S&quot; = × &quot;D&quot; × RPM / 12.
#: Example: Determine the surface of a 2-inch-diameter shaft going 1,400 revolutions per minute (RPM):
#:: &quot;S&quot; = × &quot;D&quot; × RPM / 12 = 3.1416 × 2 × 1,400 / 12 = 733.04 ft/min,
#: where = 3.1416, &quot;D&quot; = diameter of shaft in inches, &quot;S&quot; = surface speed of the shaft.
# Load bearing is required to carry (the weight which is being exerted through the combined weights of the shaft and any other direct weights on the shaft and measured in pounds-force per square inch):
#: Formula: &quot;L&quot; = &quot;W&quot; / (I.D × L.O.B.).
#: Example: Determine the load on a bearing of a 2-inch I.D. bearing, 5 inches long and carrying a weight of 3,100 lbf:
#:: &quot;W&quot; / (I.D x L.O.B.) = 3,100 / (2 × 5) = 310 lbf/in2,
#: where &quot;W&quot; = total weight carried by bearing, I.D = inside diameter of bearing, L.O.B = length of bearing, &quot;L&quot; = load bearing required to carry.

==Babbitt bearing selection==

While not subject to precise calculations, the following considerations must also be taken into account:
* Continuity of service
* Bonding characteristics
* Cooling facilities
* Lubrication
* Cleanliness
* Maintenance schedule for the bearing in use
For example, a bearing in continuous use in a harsh environment without regular maintenance will require different Babbitt and lubrication than a bearing in intermittent use in a clean, light duty environment. This so-called art is really the condensation of the experience of the technician and the experience of the bearing being rebuilt.

If the bearing has performed well in use over many years, the bearing needs simply to be rebuilt to its original specification and formulation. In this case the technician&#x27;s greatest concerns are:
# Bearing shell surface preparation
# Bonding characteristics of the tinning compound and the Babbitt layer and,
# Load bearing surface preparation and finish

==Eco-Babbitt==
Eco-Babbitt is an alloy of 90% Sn, 7% Zn, 3% Cu that is not technically a Babbitt metal. See Solder alloys for more information on Eco-Babbitt.

<text>Database design is the organization of data according to a database model. The designer determines what data must be stored and how the data elements interrelate. With this information, they can begin to fit the data to the database model. A database management system manages the data accordingly.

Database design is a process that consists of several steps.

== Conceptual data modeling ==
The first step of database design involves classifying data and identifying interrelationships. The theoretical representation of data is called an &quot;ontology&quot; or a &quot;conceptual data model&quot;.

=== Determining data to be stored ===
In a majority of cases, the person designing a database is a person with expertise in database design, rather than expertise in the domain from which the data to be stored is drawn e.g. financial information, biological information etc. Therefore, the data to be stored in a particular database must be determined in cooperation with a person who does have expertise in that domain, and who is aware of the meaning of the data to be stored within the system.

This process is one which is generally considered part of requirements analysis, and requires skill on the part of the database designer to elicit the needed information from those with the domain knowledge. This is because those with the necessary domain knowledge often cannot clearly express the system requirements for the database as they are unaccustomed to thinking in terms of the discrete data elements which must be stored. Data to be stored can be determined by Requirement Specification.

=== Determining data relationships ===
Once a database designer is aware of the data which is to be stored within the database, they must then determine where dependency is within the data. Sometimes when data is changed you can be changing other data that is not visible. For example, in a list of names and addresses, assuming a situation where multiple people can have the same address, but one person cannot have more than one address, the address is dependent upon the name. When provided a name and the list the address can be uniquely determined; however, the inverse does not hold – when given an address and the list, a name cannot be uniquely determined because multiple people can reside at an address. Because an address is determined by a name, an address is considered dependent on a name.

(NOTE: A common misconception is that the relational model is so called because of the stating of relationships between data elements therein. This is not true. The relational model is so named because it is based upon the mathematical structures known as relations.)

=== Conceptual schema ===
The information obtained can be formalized in a diagram or schema. At this stage, it is a conceptual schema.

==== ER diagram (entity–relationship model) ====
One of the most common types of conceptual schemas is the ER (entity–relationship model) diagrams.

Attributes in ER diagrams are usually modeled as an oval with the name of the attribute, linked to the entity or relationship that contains the attribute.

ER models are commonly used in information system design; for example, they are used to describe information requirements and / or the types of information to be stored in the database during the conceptual structure design phase.

==Logical data modeling==

Once the relationships and dependencies amongst the various pieces of information have been determined, it is possible to arrange the data into a logical structure which can then be mapped into the storage objects supported by the database management system. In the case of relational databases the storage objects are tables which store data in rows and columns. In an Object database the storage objects correspond directly to the objects used by the Object-oriented programming language used to write the applications that will manage and access the data. The relationships may be defined as attributes of the object classes involved or as methods that operate on the object classes.

The way this mapping is generally performed is such that each set of related data which depends upon a single object, whether real or abstract, is placed in a table. Relationships between these dependent objects are then stored as links between the various objects.

Each table may represent an implementation of either a logical object or a relationship joining one or more instances of one or more logical objects. Relationships between tables may then be stored as links connecting child tables with parents. Since complex logical relationships are themselves tables they will probably have links to more than one parent.

=== Normalization ===

In the field of relational database design, &quot;normalization&quot; is a systematic way of ensuring that a database structure is suitable for general-purpose querying and free of certain undesirable characteristics—insertion, update, and deletion anomalies that could lead to loss of data integrity.

A standard piece of database design guidance is that the designer should create a fully normalized design; selective denormalization can subsequently be performed, but only for performance reasons. The trade-off is storage space vs performance. The more normalized the design is, the less data redundancy there is (and therefore, it takes up less space to store), however, common data retrieval patterns may now need complex joins, merges, and sorts to occur – which takes up more data read, and compute cycles. Some modeling disciplines, such as the dimensional modeling approach to data warehouse design, explicitly recommend non-normalized designs, i.e. designs that in large part do not adhere to 3NF. Normalization consists of normal forms that are 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, Boyce-Codd NF (3.5NF), 4NF, 5NF and 6NF.

Document databases take a different approach. A document that is stored in such a database, typically would contain more than one normalized data unit and often the relationships between the units as well. If all the data units and the relationships in question are often retrieved together, then this approach optimizes the number of retrieves. It also simplifies how data gets replicated, because now there is a clearly identifiable unit of data whose consistency is self-contained. Another consideration is that reading and writing a single document in such databases will require a single transaction – which can be an important consideration in a Microservices architecture. In such situations, often, portions of the document are retrieved from other services via an API and stored locally for efficiency reasons. If the data units were to be split out across the services, then a read (or write) to support a service consumer might require more than one service calls, and this could result in management of multiple transactions, which may not be preferred.

==Physical design==

=== Physical data modeling ===

The physical design of the database specifies the physical configuration of the database on the storage media. This includes detailed specification of data elements and data types.

=== Other physical design ===
This step involves specifying the indexing options and other parameters residing in the DBMS data dictionary. It is the detailed design of a system that includes modules &amp; the database&#x27;s hardware &amp; software specifications of the system. Some aspects that are addressed at the physical layer:
* Security – end-user, as well as administrative security.
* Performance – mainly addressed via indexing for the read/update/delete queries, data type choice for insert queries
* Replication – what pieces of data get copied over into another database, and how often. Are there multiple-masters, or a single one?
* High-availability – whether the configuration is active-passive, or active-active, the topology, coordination scheme, reliability targets, etc all have to be defined.
* Partitioning – if the database is distributed, then for a single entity, how is the data distributed amongst all the partitions of the database, and how is partition failure taken into account.
* Backup and restore schemes.

At the application level, other aspects of the physical design can include the need to define stored procedures, or materialized query views, OLAP cubes, etc.

==Example: relational database data modeling==
The following steps are suggestion of the data modeling process for Microsoft Access, a relational DBMS.
# Determine the purpose of the database – This helps prepare for the remaining steps.
# Find and organize the information required – Gather all of the types of information to record in the database, such as product name and order number.
# Divide the information into tables – Divide information items into major entities or subjects, such as Products or Orders. Each subject then becomes a table.
# Turn information items into columns – Decide what information needs to be stored in each table. Each item becomes a field, and is displayed as a column in the table. For example, an Employees table might include fields such as Last Name and Hire Date.
# Specify primary keys – Choose each table&#x27;s primary key. The primary key is a column, or a set of columns, that is used to uniquely identify each row. An example might be Product ID or Order ID.
# Set up the table relationships – Look at each table and decide how the data in one table is related to the data in other tables. Add fields to tables or create new tables to clarify the relationships, as necessary.
# Refine the design – Analyze the design for errors. Create tables and add a few records of sample data. Check if results come from the tables as expected. Make adjustments to the design, as needed.
# Apply the normalization rules – Apply the data normalization rules to see if tables are structured correctly. Make adjustments to the tables, as needed.

<text>The sixth government of Jordi Pujol was formed on 30 November 1999 following the latter&#x27;s reelection as President of Catalonia by the Parliament of Catalonia on 16 November 1999 and his swearing-in on 29 November 1999, as a result of the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC) and the opposition falling one seat short of a parliamentary majority at the 1995 Catalan regional election, thus allowing Convergence and Union (CiU) to continue to rule with the external support of the People&#x27;s Party (PP). It succeeded the fifth Pujol government and was the Government of Catalonia from 30 November 1999 to 22 December 2003, a total of days, or 

The cabinet was an all-CiU government, comprising members of the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC) and its sister party, the Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC). It was automatically dismissed on 17 November 2003 as a consequence of the 2003 regional election, but remained in acting capacity until the next government was sworn in.

<doc id="1040420" wikidata="Q1129328" url="?curid=1040420" title="Convair XF-92">
<text>The Convair XF-92 (re-designated from XP-92 in 1948) is an American, delta wing, first-generation jet prototype. Originally conceived as a point-defence interceptor, the design was later used purely for experimental purposes and only one was built. However, it led Convair to use the delta-wing on a number of designs, including the F-102 Delta Dagger, F-106 Delta Dart, B-58 Hustler, the US Navy&#x27;s F2Y Sea Dart as well as the VTOL FY Pogo.

==Design and development==

===Early work===
Prior to August 1945, the Vultee Division of Consolidated-Vultee looked at the possibility of a swept-wing aircraft powered by a ducted rocket. Years earlier, the company had performed designs which involved liquid-cooled radiator engines. With this design, fuel would be added to the heat produced by small rocket engines in the duct, creating a &quot;pseudo-ramjet&quot;.

In August 1945, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), soon to be renamed the United States Air Force, issued a proposal for a supersonic interceptor capable of speeds and reaching an altitude of in four minutes. Several companies responded, among which was Consolidated-Vultee, which submitted its design on 13 October 1945. This design featured swept wings and V-tails, as well as a powerful propulsion system. Besides the ducted rocket, four rockets were positioned at the exhaust nozzle, along with the 19XB turbojet produced by Westinghouse.

A proposal by Consolidated Vultee (later Convair) was accepted in May 1946, with a proposal for a ramjet-powered aircraft, with a 45° swept wing under USAAF Air Materiel Command Secret Project MX-813. However, wind tunnel testing demonstrated a number of problems with this design.

===Switch to delta===
Convair found that by straightening the trailing edge and increasing the sweep of the leading edge, the characteristics of their new wing were greatly improved. Thus, contrary to suggestions that German designer Alexander Lippisch influenced it, Convair independently discovered the thin high-speed delta wing. Ralph Shick, chief of aerodynamic research, later met Lippisch at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This helped to convince him that the thin delta was the way forward, however the influence of Lippisch provided no more than &quot;moral support&quot; and Convair rejected many of his ideas, such as the thick wing of the Lippisch P.13a project and the DM-1 test glider which the US had tested.

Thrust was to be provided by a Westinghouse J30 jet engine assisted by a battery of six liquid-fueled rockets. This mixed-propulsion system required a very large intake duct, which not only fed the jet engine but also passed air around the rocket exhaust to provide thrust augmentation. Located centrally, the large duct left nowhere to put a traditional cockpit; in its normal location it would have projected deep into the duct. To address this, the team modified the design in a fashion similar to both the Leduc 0.10 and Miles M.52, placing the cockpit in a cylindrical body in the center of the intake. The design was presented to the U.S. Air Force in 1946 and was accepted for development as the XP-92.

===Delta research===
In order to gain inflight experience with the delta wing layout, Convair suggested building a smaller prototype, the Model 7002, which the USAAF accepted in November 1946.

In order to save development time and money, many components were taken from other aircraft; the main gear was taken from a North American FJ-1 Fury, the nosewheel from a Bell P-63 Kingcobra, the engine and hydraulics were taken from a Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star, the ejection seat and cockpit canopy were taken from the cancelled Convair XP-81, and the rudder pedals were taken from a BT-13 trainer.

Construction was well underway at Vultee Field in Downey, California when North American Aviation took over the Vultee plants in summer 1947. The airframe was moved to Convair&#x27;s plant in San Diego, and completed in the autumn. In December it was shipped without an engine to NACA&#x27;s Ames Aeronautical Laboratory for wind tunnel testing. After testing was completed, the airframe was returned to San Diego, where it was fitted with a Allison J33-A-21 engine.

By the time the aircraft was ready for testing, the concept of the point-defense interceptor seemed outdated and the (now redesignated) F-92 project was cancelled; the test aircraft was nevertheless completed as the XF-92A.

==Operational history==
In April 1948 the XF-92A was shipped to Muroc Dry Lake (later to become Edwards AFB). Early tests were limited to taxiing, although a short hop was made on 9 June 1948. The XF-92A&#x27;s first flight was on 18 September 1948 with Convair test pilot Ellis D. &quot;Sam&quot; Shannon at the controls. On 21 December 1948 Bill Martin began testing the aircraft for the company. After 47 flights totaling 20 hours and 33 minutes, the aircraft was turned over to the USAAF on 26 August 1949, with the testing being assigned to Frank Everest and Chuck Yeager.

On 13 October 1949 Yeager became the first Air Force pilot to fly the XF-92A. On his second flight he dove the aircraft in a 4 g split-S dive, reaching Mach 1.05 for a brief time. When approaching for landing on this flight he continued to pull the nose higher and higher in order to slow the forward speed to avoid the problems from his first attempt. Surprisingly, the aircraft simply wouldn&#x27;t stall; he was able to continue raising the nose until he reached 45 degrees pitch, flying under control in that attitude to a landing at , slower than Convair had managed.

In 1951, the XF-92A was refitted with an Allison J33-A-29 engine with an afterburner, offering a thrust of . The re-engined XF-92A was flown by Yeager for the first time on 20 July 1951. However, there was very little improvement in performance. In addition, there were maintenance problems with this engine and only 21 flights were made during the next 19 months. A final engine change was made to the J33-A-16.

On 9 April 1953, Scott Crossfield began a series of flights on behalf of NACA. These tests revealed a violent pitch-up tendency during high-speed turns, often as much as 6 g, and on one occasion 8 g. The addition of wing fences partially alleviated this problem. Crossfield flew 25 flights in the XF-92A by 14 October 1953. After the aircraft&#x27;s last flight the nose gear collapsed as Crossfield taxied off the lake bed; the aircraft was retired.

None of the pilots had much good to say about the design. Yeager commented &quot;It was a tricky plane to fly, but ... I got it out to 1.05 Mach.&quot; Crossfield was more direct, saying &quot;Nobody wanted to fly the XF-92. There was no lineup of pilots for that airplane. It was a miserable flying beast. Everyone complained it was underpowered.&quot;

===Influence===
The delta wing&#x27;s thin airfoil cross section, low weight and structural strength made it a good candidate for a supersonic airplane. The large surface area of 425 ft2 (39 m2) gave a low wing loading which in turn led to good low-speed performance. Very slow landing speeds could be achieved, at the cost of extremely nose-high landing angles and the resulting poor visibility. The combination of good high-speed and low-speed characteristics was very difficult to achieve for other planforms. Although the XF-92 itself was not liked, the design concept clearly had promise and the delta wing was used on several Convair designs through the 1950s and 1960s.

Of particular interest to aircraft designers was the unexpectedly good low-speed behavior Yeager had noticed on his second flight. The aircraft continued to remain controllable at very high angles of attack (alpha), where a conventional layout would have stalled. The reason for this turned out to be the unexpected creation of a large vortex over the top of the wing, generated by the airflow between the fuselage and leading edge of the wing at high alpha. The vortex became &quot;attached&quot; to the upper surface of the wing, supplying it with air moving at speeds much greater than the aircraft&#x27;s forward speed. By controlling the flow in this critical area, the performance envelope of the delta could be greatly expanded, which led to the introduction of canards on most delta-wing designs in the 1960s and 1970s. More recently leading edge extensions have become common on most fighter aircraft, creating the vortex over a more conventional wing planform.

==Popular culture==

An unusual application of the XF-92A was as a movie model, stepping into the role of the &quot;MiG-23&quot; in the Howard Hughes film, &quot;Jet Pilot&quot;, starring John Wayne and Janet Leigh. Due to the lengthy delay in releasing the film, by the time it appeared in 1957, the XF-92A&#x27;s role had been left on the cutting room floor. It did appear in the film &quot;Toward the Unknown&quot; (1956) starring William Holden, again in the guise of another aircraft, this time as its descendant design the F-102 Delta Dagger.

<text>Melksham Without is a civil parish in the county of Wiltshire, England. It surrounds, but does not include, the town of Melksham and is the largest rural parish in Wiltshire, with a population of 7,230 (as of 2011) and an area of . The parish includes the villages of Beanacre, Berryfield, Shaw and Whitley, and the hamlets of Outmarsh and Redstocks. It also includes the outer Melksham suburbs of Bowerhill and The Spa, and the dispersed settlement of Sandridge which includes Sandridge Common.

The northern boundary of the parish is the Roman road from Silchester to Bath; downstream from Melksham the Bristol Avon forms the southwestern boundary, and parts of the southern boundary are the Semington Brook and the Kennet and Avon Canal.

== History ==
The Local Government Act of 1894 created the parish of Melksham Without, dividing the ancient parish of Melksham into an urban area (Melksham Within) and a rural area (Melksham Without). The latter consists of the ancient settlements of Beanacre, Shaw and Whitley, surrounding Melksham Within on all sides except the west. Until the 17th century, the area to the east was royal forest, and this part is lightly populated and agricultural. To the south the land was similarly rural but was used for military purposes in the mid-20th century, with the training schools of RAF Melksham based at Bowerhill, and this area now consists of light industry and housing estates. There is another housing estate separate from the town at Berryfield, to the south.

== Governance ==
The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs most local government functions. Unusually, the parish shares some land in common with the parish of Broughton Gifford, namely farmland to the north of Holbrook Farm, bounded to the west by the Avon.

The parish spans three electoral divisions. The north of the parish is part of Melksham Without North and Shurnold division, while the east and south are part of Bowerhill division; both divisions also extend to parts of Melksham town. In the south-west, Berryfield is part of the Melksham Without West and Rural division. Each division elects one member of Wiltshire Council.

For Westminster elections, the parish is part of the Melksham and Devizes constituency.

== Notable buildings ==
The parish has one Grade I listed building: Beanacre Old Manor, west of what is now the A350, has a timber-framed hall from the late 14th century, with many additions and alterations in later centuries. Close by to the south-west is Beanacre Manor, from c.1595 with a 17th-century dairy, Grade II* listed.

Two further buildings are listed Grade II*: Woolmore Manor, built in 1631 and now on the south-east edge of Melksham, near modern Bowerhill; and Christ Church, Shaw, designed in 1905 in Arts and Crafts Gothic style by C.E. Ponting.

== Transport ==
A packhorse bridge dating from 1725 spans the River Avon, providing a route (now a public footpath) to Broughton Gifford.

The Kennet and Avon Canal was built in the south of the parish by 1804 and fully opened in 1810. In the same year the Wilts &amp; Berks Canal opened, having been built through the parish from its connection with the K&amp;A near Semington. After passing through the eastern side of Melksham town the canal continued north through the parish towards Chippenham, Swindon and Abingdon. Both canals fell into decline following the arrival of the railways in the 1840s, and the closure of the Somerset Coal Canal (which provided much of their traffic) in 1904.

In 1848 the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway company built their line through the parish, to link the Swindon-Bath line (near Chippenham) with Westbury via Melksham and Trowbridge; the line was handed over to the Great Western Railway in 1850 and is still in use. From 1905 to 1955 there was a small station, Beanacre Halt, near Beanacre on the road towards Whitley. The Devizes Branch Line was completed in 1857 and also taken over by the GWR, but closed in 1966. It connected with the main line near Holt and passed near Outmarsh, where there was a station, .

Today the Kennet and Avon Canal is a well-used recreational waterway, following its restoration in the 1970s and 1980s and formal re-opening in 1990. The Wilts &amp; Berks Canal was abandoned in 1914 and its route south and east of Melksham has been built over; preservation and restoration efforts began in 1977 and in 2012 a planning application was submitted for a new section of canal (called the Melksham Link) to connect the Semington junction, via Berryfield, with the Avon below Melksham.

The A350 primary route runs north–south through the parish on its section from Chippenham to Melksham and passes through Beanacre. South of Melksham, on its way to Westbury, its original route past Berryfield and Outmarsh was replaced in 2004 by the Semington bypass, about 400m to the east. The new route required the construction of an aqueduct to carry the Kennet and Avon Canal, the New Semington Aqueduct. The Hampton Park West industrial area, between the old and new routes, has the headquarters of Avon Rubber and G Plan Upholstery, and a divisional headquarters of Wiltshire Police.

She is a certified business education teacher, and worked as an educator for seventeen years, mostly in the Fort Garry School Division of Winnipeg. In 1962, she married Hubert J. Dacquay. She was a regional organizer for the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba from 1984 to 1986, and an executive director of the party from 1987 to 1989.

Dacquay served on the Winnipeg City Council from 1986 to 1989, representing the Langevin Ward. She won the seat from veteran councillor Evelyne Reese in 1986, but lost it to Reese three years later.

She was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1990 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal Herold Driedger by forty-seven votes in the south-end Winnipeg constituency of Seine River. She was named deputy speaker of the assembly on October 11, 1990, and held this position for the next four and a half years.

Dacquay was re-elected by an increased margin in the 1995 provincial election, and was appointed speaker of the assembly by premier Gary Filmon on May 23, 1995. Unlike her predecessor, Denis Rocan, she was often accused of partisanship by members of the opposition New Democratic Party. NDP legislator Steve Ashton called for her resignation in 1996, after she refused to grant him permission to raise a point of privilege during a debate on the privatization of Manitoba&#x27;s telephone system. Dacquay is generally regarded, along with Myrna Phillips of the NDP, as one of the weakest and most partisan Speakers in recent history.

The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the provincial election of 1999, though Dacquay was personally re-elected in Seine River. She served as opposition critic for culture, heritage and tourism in the legislative session which followed. The NDP campaign targeted Seine River in the 2003 election, and Dacquay lost her constituency to NDP candidate Theresa Oswald by a margin of 4,314 votes to 3,582.

<text>Tanja Tellervo Karpela (&quot;née&quot; Vienonen; &quot;previously&quot; Karpela and Saarela; born 22 August 1970) is a Finnish former politician and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss Finland 1991. She was a Member of Parliament from 1999 to 2011 and served in the government of Finland as Minister of Culture from 2003 to 2007.

==Life and career==
Karpela was born in Salo. As a beauty queen, she held the title of Miss Finland and represented her country in the Miss Universe 1991. Prior to her political career, she also became famous for her work as an underwear and lingerie model.

Karpela was elected to parliament from the Electoral District of Uusimaa in 1999, representing the Centre Party. She was appointed Minister of Culture in Prime Minister Anneli Jäätteenmäki&#x27;s cabinet in 2003. After the resignation of Jäätteenmäki, Karpela went on to serve in the same post under Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen.

In December 2005 Karpela received a Big Brother Award from the Finnish on-line civil rights organization EFFI for proposing Internet traffic blocking software be installed in schools and libraries. She was also a supporter of the 2005 amendment to the Finnish Copyright Act and Penal Code, which has been nicknamed &quot;Lex Karpela&quot; due to her acceptance of what many perceive to be a highly controversial addition to the Finnish law. In March 2010, Karpela announced that she is no longer pursuing a parliamentary career following the 2011 parliamentary elections.

==Personal life==
Karpela is a convicted drunk driver and since entering politics, she has become most famous for her relationships – she has remarried twice and broken off a third, separate engagement. Karpela caused a stir in 2001 when it became public that she (a divorcée) was having a relationship with Finance Minister Sauli Niinistö (a widower). Karpela&#x27;s Centre Party was in opposition and Niinistö was considered the second-most influential man in government. Under close press scrutiny ever since, in 2003 Karpela and Niinistö announced their engagement. They broke off their engagement in 2004.

On 21 May 2006, Karpela married film director Olli Saarela, and took her new husband&#x27;s surname. She filed for divorce from Olli Saarela in November 2007, and on 22 February 2008 she changed her name back to Karpela.

Karpela has two children (born 1995 and 1998) from her previous marriage to Totti Karpela and one (born 2009) from her third marriage to Janne Erjola.

<text>Graham Spry, CC (February 20, 1900 – November 24, 1983) was a Canadian broadcasting pioneer, business executive, diplomat and socialist. He was the husband of Irene Spry and father of Robin Spry, Richard Spry and Lib Spry.

== Life ==
He was born in St. Thomas, Ontario. While a student at the University of Manitoba, he became an editorial writer at the &quot;Manitoba Free Press&quot;, where he was mentored by editor and Canadian nationalist John W. Dafoe. He also edited the student newspaper, the Manitoban. He then studied history at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. Upon his return to Canada, he became Secretary of the Canadian Clubs, and organized a nationwide broadcast to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Canadian Confederation. The accomplishment, achieved despite the lack of a national radio network, convinced Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to appoint the Aird Commission on Radio Broadcasting, a royal commission which recommended the creation of a national broadcaster.

Following the defeat of King&#x27;s government Spry and Alan Plaunt formed the Canadian Radio League to rally support behind the Aird Commission&#x27;s recommendation, arguing that it amounted to a choice between two alternatives, &quot;the State or the United States&quot;. The League mobilized public opinion in both English- and French-speaking regions of Canada, and convinced the Conservative government of R.B. Bennett to form the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, which later became the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

A socialist, Spry cofounded the League for Social Reconstruction (LSR), contributed to the writing of the Regina Manifesto, and purchased both the &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Sun&quot; (publication of the United Farmers of Ontario), renamed the &quot;New Commonwealth&quot;, and the &quot;Canadian Forum&quot; to propagate the LSR&#x27;s views. He served as vice president of the Ontario Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) from 1934 to 1936. He was the first national Co-operative Commonwealth Federation candidate in Ontario, running in the 24 September 1934 by-election in Toronto East. He ran again for the National CCF in the 1935 general election, this time in the newly created Broadview electoral district. He lost on both occasions to Conservative Tommy Church.

During the Spanish Civil War Spry helped organize medical support for the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion that fought on the Republican side.

In 1938, Spry married Irene Mary Biss. Unable to find work in Canada because of his socialist convictions, however, Spry accepted a job offer from an old Oxford friend and served as a British-based executive for Standard Oil from 1940 to 1946, managing subsidiaries operating in the Middle East and elsewhere. From 1942 to 1945, he also served as personal assistant to Sir Stafford Cripps, a Labour minister in the wartime British cabinet, and travelled with Cripps to India. After the war, Spry was named agent-general of Tommy Douglas&#x27;s CCF government in London representing the province of Saskatchewan from 1946 to 1968 in Britain, including responsibility for Europe and the Middle East.

Spry played a crucial role during the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors&#x27; strike against Medicare by recruiting British doctors to move to the province. In 1968 he reactivated his involvement with broadcasting, founding the Canadian Broadcasting League over which he presided until 1973. In 1970, Spry reputedly turned down Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s offer of a Senate seat. That same year, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. Graham Spry died in Ottawa on November 24, 1983.

== Building ==
A federal government building dedicated in the name of Graham Spry is located at 250 Lanark Avenue, Ottawa. Formerly the home of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Ottawa television studios, it now houses several directorates of Health Canada.

<text>Marvin John Nance (December 21, 1943 – December 30, 1996), known professionally as Jack Nance, was an American actor. A longtime collaborator of filmmaker David Lynch, Nance portrayed the lead in Lynch&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (1977). He continued to work with Lynch throughout his career, which included a recurring role as Pete Martell on &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–1991).

==Early life==
Marvin John Nance was born in Boston to Agnes ( O&#x27;Grady) and Marvin Hoyt Nance. He grew up in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas. Hoyt Nance was a Neiman Marcus executive. In early childhood, Nance was struck by a car, injuring his back. He graduated from South Oak Cliff High School and attended the North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) studying journalism. He took up acting at university and later left to concentrate on acting; he joined the Dallas Theater Center. He was a student of Paul Baker, the theater&#x27;s founder.

In 1964, Nance headed for California and worked for some time with the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. He had success and landed the lead role in a play based on the life of Thomas Paine which was directed by David Lindemann.

==Career==
Nance was considered for the role of Benjamin in &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), a role which went to Dustin Hoffman, and for the role of Perry Smith in Richard Brooks&#x27; crime film &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1967), which went to Robert Blake. He played twin brothers Benny and Tony Rebozo in the Doo Dah Gang, a performance group that staged 1920s-style gang fights at nontraditional venues. When one of his characters died, Nance spent three days lying in a coffin at the staged wake.

Nance met David Lynch in 1972 after an introduction by Lindemann. Lynch was a fellow at the American Film Institute and creating a $10,000, 20 minute short film in Beverly Hills. Lindemann had recommended Nance for the role of Henry Spencer in &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (1977). Filming occurred sporadically over five years due to funding problems.

&quot;Eraserhead&quot; was initially unsuccessful. However, the film became a midnight movie, leading to its cult classic status. Nance&#x27;s performance has since been praised for its theatrics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1980, &quot;[Nance&#x27;s] minimalist features, unchanging expression, tight dark suit, and short, almost crippled steps suggest many silent-film comedians.&quot; The film became a favorite of Stanley Kubrick, and he required the cast of &quot;The Shining&quot; to watch it before filming.

After &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, Lynch and Nance remained on good terms. The actor appeared in most of Lynch&#x27;s subsequent projects during Nance&#x27;s lifetime: &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), &quot;The Cowboy and the Frenchman&quot; (1988), &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990), &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–91), &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992), and &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997). While none of Nance&#x27;s scenes filmed for &quot;Fire Walk with Me&quot; appeared in the theatrical cut, they were later compiled in the feature-length &quot;Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces&quot; (2014).

Nance appeared with actress Mary Woronov as a married couple in the music video for the 1983 Suicidal Tendencies song “Institutionalized&quot;. 

After gaining sobriety in 1986 and needing a steady salary, Nance took courses in hotel management. He began working as a clerk at Hotel Hollywood. While there, Nance refused a role in &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; (1988), due to it conflicting with his job schedule.

Dennis Hopper hired him to appear in &quot;Colors&quot; (1988), after they both performed in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. He also had a brief appearance as the doctor in Chuck Russell&#x27;s 1988 sci-fi horror film, &quot;The Blob&quot;. In 1990, Nance was offered the role of Pete Martell in Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks,&quot; appearing throughout the show&#x27;s original run.

After an addiction relapse in 1993, Nance&#x27;s life took another turn. He had smaller roles in films that did not perform as successfully. He lived in a hotel and was kicked out for firing a gun at the television. He guest-starred on a 1995 episode of &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; entitled &quot;Weekend&quot;, in which he played an innkeeper. Nance continued in smaller roles until his death in 1996.

Nance appeared in &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot; (2017) in footage featuring Pete Martell from the pilot episode of the original series. &quot;Part 17&quot; of &quot;The Return&quot; was dedicated in his memory.

His final film, Michael Moriarty&#x27;s &quot;Of Things Past&quot;, was released in 2023. The original filming took place in 1985 and includes additional footage shot in 2022.

==Personal life==
Nance married Catherine E. Coulson in 1968; they divorced in 1976.

Nance met his second wife, Kelly Jean Van Dyke, the daughter of Jerry Van Dyke and niece of Dick Van Dyke, in 1986 while in rehab. They married in May 1991.

=== Alcoholism ===
It is unknown when Nance&#x27;s alcoholism began, but Lynch recalled that during the filming of &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, he would send Nance &quot;back to his dressing room to sleep off the booze. He&#x27;d get drunk and sometimes end up sleeping in vacant lots.&quot; Lynch claimed that he once had to drive Nance to the emergency room for a distended abdomen.

Lynch gave Nance the incidental role of Nefud in &quot;Dune&quot; (1984). The minor role afforded Nance a lot of spare time during filming in Mexico City, much of which he spent drinking.

In 1986, while filming &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, Nance told the newly sober Dennis Hopper that if he did not help him, he would jump from the window. Hopper traveled back to Los Angeles with Nance, tempting him with alcohol and drugs. When the two arrived, Hopper checked Nance into a rehabilitation centre, where Nance went cold turkey. Nance met Van Dyke there and the two began a relationship, with Nance believing he could help her, in turn, become clean.

Nance started drinking again in 1993, after a depressive episode following Van Dyke&#x27;s death, and suffered two strokes from 1995 to 1996. He was cast in the film &quot;Joyride&quot; (1997) but sent home after one day of filming due to drunkenness on set.

=== Kelly Jean Van Dyke&#x27;s suicide ===
Nance&#x27;s wife Kelly Jean Van Dyke committed suicide on November 17, 1991. Nance, who was in Bass Lake, California, filming &quot;Meatballs 4&quot; at the time, called her to tell her that he was thinking of leaving her due to her drinking and drug-taking. She threatened to kill herself if he hung up on her, and at that moment a lightning storm knocked out the phone lines in Bass Lake. Nance and the director, Bobby Logan, found a deputy sheriff who contacted the Los Angeles Police Department. They broke in and found that she had hanged herself. Nance claimed she was four months pregnant.

===Death===
On December 29, 1996, Nance lunched with friends Leo Bulgarini and Catherine Case. Nance had a visible &quot;crescent-shaped bruise&quot; under his eye; and, when asked about it, he relayed to them a story about a brawl outside a Winchell&#x27;s Donuts store that morning. He went home, complaining of a headache.

Nance had developed a subdural hematoma, resulting in his death the following morning. Bulgarini found his body on the bathroom floor of his apartment in South Pasadena, California, later that day. An autopsy revealed that his blood alcohol content was 0.24% at the time of his death. His death was initially ruled as resulting from blunt force trauma.

==Legacy==
The song &quot;I Gotta Move&quot; by Frank Black and the Catholics, from their 1997 eponymous debut album, refers to the circumstances of Nance&#x27;s death and the murder of Peter Ivers, who composed and performed the song &quot;In Heaven&quot; from &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (which Black&#x27;s previous band Pixies had covered).

A documentary about Nance funded by Lynch, titled &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot;, was released in 2002.

<text>In the mathematical discipline of model theory, the Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game (also called back-and-forth games)
is a technique based on game semantics for determining whether two structures 
are elementarily equivalent. The main application of Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé games is in proving the inexpressibility of certain properties in first-order logic. Indeed, Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé games provide a complete methodology for proving inexpressibility results for first-order logic. In this role, these games are of particular importance in finite model theory and its applications in computer science (specifically computer aided verification and database theory), since Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé games are one of the few techniques from model theory that remain valid in the context of finite models. Other widely used techniques for proving inexpressibility results, such as the compactness theorem, do not work in finite models.

Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé-like games can also be defined for other logics, such as fixpoint logics and pebble games for finite variable logics; extensions are powerful enough to characterise definability in existential second-order logic.

== Main idea ==
The main idea behind the game is that we have two structures, and two players – &quot;Spoiler&quot; and &quot;Duplicator&quot;. Duplicator wants to show that the two structures are elementarily equivalent (satisfy the same first-order sentences), whereas Spoiler wants to show that they are different. The game is played in rounds. A round proceeds as follows: Spoiler chooses any element from one of the structures, and Duplicator chooses an element from the other structure. In simplified terms, the Duplicator&#x27;s task is to always pick an element &quot;similar&quot; to the one that the Spoiler has chosen, whereas the Spoiler&#x27;s task is to choose an element for which no &quot;similar&quot; element exists in the other structure. Duplicator wins if there exists an isomorphism between the eventual substructures chosen from the two different structures; otherwise, Spoiler wins.

The game lasts for a fixed number of steps formula_1 (which is an ordinal – usually a finite number or formula_2).

== Definition ==
Suppose that we are given two structures formula_3 
and formula_4, each with no function symbols and the same set of relation symbols, 
and a fixed natural number &quot;n&quot;. We can then define the Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé 
game formula_5 to be a game between two players, Spoiler and Duplicator, 
played as follows:
# The first player, Spoiler, picks either a member formula_6 of formula_3 or a member formula_8 of formula_4.
# If Spoiler picked a member of formula_3, Duplicator picks a member formula_8 of formula_4; otherwise, Duplicator picks a member formula_6 of formula_3.
# Spoiler picks either a member formula_15 of formula_3 or a member formula_17 of formula_4.
# Duplicator picks an element formula_15 or formula_17 in the model from which Spoiler did not pick.
# Spoiler and Duplicator continue to pick members of formula_3 and formula_4 for formula_23 more steps.
# At the conclusion of the game, we have chosen distinct elements formula_24 of formula_3 and formula_26 of formula_4. We therefore have two structures on the set formula_28, one induced from formula_3 via the map sending formula_30 to formula_31, and the other induced from formula_4 via the map sending formula_30 to formula_34. Duplicator wins if these structures are the same; Spoiler wins if they are not.

For each &quot;n&quot; we define a relation formula_35 if Duplicator wins the &quot;n&quot;-move game formula_5. These are all equivalence relations on the class of structures with the given relation symbols. The intersection of all these relations is again an equivalence relation formula_37.

==Equivalence and inexpressibility==
It is easy to prove that if Duplicator wins this game for all finite &quot;n&quot;, that is, formula_37, then formula_3 and formula_4 are elementarily equivalent. If the set of relation symbols being considered is finite, the converse is also true.

If a property formula_41 is true of formula_3 but not true of formula_4, but formula_3 and formula_4 can be shown equivalent by providing a winning strategy for Duplicator, then this shows that formula_41 is inexpressible in the logic captured by this game.

== History ==

The back-and-forth method used in the Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game to verify elementary equivalence was given by Roland Fraïssé 
in his thesis;
it was formulated as a game by Andrzej Ehrenfeucht. The names Spoiler and Duplicator are due to Joel Spencer. Other usual names are Eloise [sic] and Abelard (and often denoted by formula_47 and formula_48) after Heloise and Abelard, a naming scheme introduced by Wilfrid Hodges in his book &quot;Model Theory&quot;, or alternatively Eve and Adam.

== Further reading ==

Chapter 1 of Poizat&#x27;s model theory text contains an introduction to the Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game, and so do Chapters 6, 7, and 13 of Rosenstein&#x27;s book on linear orders. A simple example of the Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game is given in one of Ivars Peterson&#x27;s MathTrek columns.

Phokion Kolaitis&#x27; slides and Neil Immerman&#x27;s book chapter on Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé games discuss applications in computer science, the methodology for proving inexpressibility results, and several simple inexpressibility proofs using this methodology.

Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé games are the basis for the operation of derivative on modeloids. Modeloids are certain equivalence relations and the derivative provides for a generalization of standard model theory.

<text>James Edward &quot;Pete&quot; Runnels (January 28, 1928 – May 20, 1991) was an American professional baseball player, coach and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as an infielder for the Washington Senators (1951–57), Boston Red Sox (1958–62) and Houston Colt .45s (1963–64). Runnels was a five-time All-Star player during his tenure with the Red Sox and, is notable for being a two-time American League batting champion. He was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Major League playing and coaching career==
Born in Lufkin, Texas, the , Runnels batted left-handed and threw right-handed. A master at handling the bat, he was a notorious singles hitter who had one of the best eyes in the game, compiling an outstanding 1.35 walk-to-strikeout ratio (844-to-627). Altogether, he batted over .300 six times, once with the Senators, five with the Red Sox. Despite winning the batting title in 1960, he drove in just 35 runs, a record low for a batting title winner.

Solid and versatile with the glove, Runnels started as a shortstop with the Senators, but ultimately played 644 games at first base, 642 at second, 463 at shortstop, and 49 at third. Twice he led the American League in fielding percentage, at second base in 1960 (.986), and at first base in 1961 (.995). He was not a good base stealer: in 1952 he set the record for most attempted steals with no successes, at 10. In his career he stole 37 bases and was caught 51 times.

In five seasons with Boston, Runnels never hit less than .314 (), winning two batting crowns in (.320) and (.326), and just missed the 1958 American League Batting Crown by six points to his teammate Ted Williams on the final day of the season (.328 to .322). On August 30, 1960, in a double-header against the Tigers, Runnels hit 6-for-7 in the first game (including a game-winning RBI–double in the 15th inning) and 3-for-4 in the second, tying a Major League record for hits in a double-header (9). In 1962, Runnels played in his third All-Star Game for the American League and hit a home run off the Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; Art Mahaffey. He went on to win the American League batting title that year. But after the season, Runnels was traded to the Houston Colt .45s (forerunners of the Astros) in exchange for outfielder Román Mejías. Runnels was released by Houston early in the season.

Runnels was a career .291 hitter (1854-for-6373) with 49 home runs, 630 RBI, 876 runs, 282 doubles, 64 triples, 37 stolen bases, and a .375 on-base percentage in 1799 games. He was selected an All-Star in 1959, 1960 and 1962. He also coached for the Red Sox in 1965–1966, serving as an interim manager for the last 16 games of the season. Under Runnels, the Sox played .500 baseball and escaped last place by one-half game. However, he was replaced by Dick Williams for the 1967 season.

===Managerial record===
==Post-baseball life==
After leaving Major League Baseball, Runnels returned to his native state and opened a sporting goods store in Pasadena, Texas He helped found and operate a co-ed camp, Camp Champions in Marble Falls, Texas, which is still in existence.

After suffering a stroke while golfing on May 17, 1991, Pete Runnels died three days later at Bayshore Hospital in Pasadena, Texas. He was buried at Forest Park East Cemetery in Houston.

==Honors==
Runnels was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1982. He was also inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in November 2004.

<text>Hermann K. Gummel (6 July 1923 – 5 September 2022) was a German physicist and pioneer in the semiconductor industry.

The son of Hans and Charlotte Gummel, he was the middle of their three children, Bärbel and Achi being respectively his older sister and his younger brother. Grown up in very turbulent times in Nazi Germany, after graduating from high school, he was enlisted as a radio operator for the Germany Army in World War II. As a soldier, he was wounded by shrapnel and taken prisoner during the D Day. After being brought to Scotland as a war prisoner, the compassionate care of the doctors and medical staff avoided his leg amputation: he was always grateful for this, thought he suffered pain in his leg for the rest of his life.

Gummel received his &quot;Diplom&quot; degree in physics from Philipps University (Marburg, Germany) in 1952. He received his M.S. (1952) and Ph.D. (1957) degrees in theoretical semiconductor physics from Syracuse University. In Marburg met and fall in love with Erika Reich, who eventually become his wife.
Gummel joined Bell Laboratories in 1956; his doctoral advisor, Melvin Lax, had moved from Syracuse University to Bell the previous year.

At Bell, Gummel made important contributions to the design and simulation of the semiconductor devices used throughout modern electronics. Among the most important of his contributions are the Gummel–Poon model which made accurate simulation of bipolar transistors possible and which was central to the development of the SPICE program; Gummel&#x27;s method, used to solve the equations for the detailed behavior of individual bipolar transistors,; and the Gummel plot, used to characterize bipolar transistors. Gummel also created one of the first personal workstations, based on HP minicomputers and Tektronix terminals and used for VLSI design and layout, and MOTIS, the first MOS timing simulator and the basis of &quot;fast SPICE&quot; programs.

In 1983, Gummel received the David Sarnoff Award &quot;for contributions and leadership in device analysis and development of computer-aided design tools for semiconductor devices and circuits&quot;. In 1985, Gummel was elected to the United States National Academy of Engineering for &quot;contributions and leadership in the analysis and computer-aided design of semiconductor devices and circuits.&quot;. In 1994, he was the first recipient of Phil Kaufman Award.

Gummel died on 5 September 2022, at the age of 99.

<text>Chain smoking is the practice of smoking several cigarettes in succession, sometimes using the ember of a finishing cigarette to light the next. The term chain smoker often also refers to a person who smokes relatively constantly, though not necessarily &quot;chaining&quot; each cigarette. The term applies primarily to cigarettes, although it can be used to describe incessant cigar and pipe smoking as well as vaping. It is a common indicator of addiction.

==Causes==
Many people chain-smoke when drinking alcoholic beverages, because alcohol potentiates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, leading to re-sensitization, hence inducing a craving.

The extent to which chain smoking is driven by nicotine dependence has been studied. It does not seem that the amount of nicotine delivered is a significant factor, as the puff volume correlates poorly with the frequency of cigarette consumption.

==Clinical use==
Chain smoking is given as an example of excessive addictive behavior in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It may be used as a form of aversion therapy for smokers who are unused to such heavy smoking, inducing them to give up altogether.

==Ventilation==
Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) professionals claim that an airflow of about 30 cubic meters per minute per smoker is required to maintain satisfactory air quality when the smokers are chain smoking. However, research confirms that current HVAC systems, while important for general air quality, cannot control exposure to secondhand smoke.

<doc id="1040489" wikidata="Q3440474" url="?curid=1040489" title="Catherine E. Coulson">
<text>Catherine Elizabeth Coulson (October 22, 1943 – September 28, 2015) was an American stage and screen actress who worked behind the scenes on various studio features, magazine shows and independent films as well as acting in theater and film since the age of 15. She is best known for her role as Margaret Lanterman, the enigmatic Log Lady, in the David Lynch TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

==Early years==
Coulson was born in Elmhurst, Illinois, and grew up in Southern California, the daughter of Rodney Coulson, a radio and television producer and public relations executive, and ballet dancer Elizabeth (née Fellegi). She earned a BA degree at Scripps College and a MFA at San Francisco State University.

==Career==
Coulson met Lynch in 1971 and performed various behind the scenes functions during the four-year filming of his low-budget classic &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (1977). Lynch reports that she began meditating at the same time as did he during this period. She also appeared in Lynch&#x27;s short film &quot;The Amputee&quot; (1974), in which she played a woman with no legs.

During the filming of &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, Lynch told Coulson that he had an image in his head of her holding a large log. Fifteen years later, he created such a role for her in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, on which she starred for 12 episodes through seasons 1 and 2.

Coulson went on to reprise her role in the film prequel, &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;, and in the 2017 revival. In the new series, her character (the Log Lady) appears in the first, second, tenth, eleventh and fifteenth episodes, where she passes on a message from her log for Deputy Hawk to resume the search for Agent Cooper.

Coulson appeared in &quot;Dual Spires&quot;, a 2010 episode of &quot;Psych&quot; that spoofed &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. In 2012, she appeared in the second season of &quot;Portlandia&quot;.

Coulson was a theatre actor and worked with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon where she continued to be part of the acting company. She appeared in &quot;Calvin Marshall&quot; directed by Gary Lundgren. Coulson played the role of Susie in Lundgren&#x27;s film &quot;Redwood Highway&quot; with Shirley Knight, Tom Skerritt, and James LeGros.

==Personal life==
Coulson was married to actor Jack Nance (who played Henry Spencer in &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, and Pete Martell in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;) in 1968; they divorced in 1976. Her second husband, Marc Sirinsky, with whom she had a daughter, Zoey (born 1987), is a rabbi, at one point resident at Temple Emek-Shalom in Ashland, Oregon.

Coulson converted to Judaism in the 1980s.

On September 28, 2015, Coulson died of complications from cancer at her home in Ashland. She appeared posthumously in five episodes of the revived &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; in 2017, reprising her role as the &quot;Log Lady&quot; Margaret Lanterman in scenes filmed before her death; the first episode is dedicated to Coulson, while the fifteenth episode, the final to feature her character (who announces her upcoming death before dying offscreen), is dedicated to Lanterman herself.

<text>Derek James Walding (May 9, 1937 – April 23, 2007) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1971 to 1988 and served as speaker of the assembly from 1982 to 1986. Walding was a member of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP). In 1988, he brought down the NDP government of Howard Pawley by voting against his party&#x27;s budget. That was the first time in Canadian history that a majority government was defeated by a vote of one of its own party members.

==Early life and career==
Walding was born at Rushden, Northamptonshire, England, and was educated at Wellingborough Grammar School. He spent three years with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, including a stint in West Berlin. He moved to Canada in 1961 and worked in Winnipeg as a dispensing optician and contact lens fitter.

Walding had supported the Labour Party in Britain. In 1963, joined the similar New Democratic Party in Canada and served on the party&#x27;s provincial executive in the 1960s.

==Political career==
Walding first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1969 provincial election. He initially sought the NDP nomination in the northeastern Winnipeg division of Radisson, but he lost to Harry Shafransky. He was later recruited as the party&#x27;s candidate for the nearby division of St. Vital, and lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Jack Hardy by only 23 votes.

Hardy resigned from the legislature in February 1971, and Walding was nominated as the NDP candidate for the by-election to succeed him. He was narrowly elected, defeating Liberal candidate Dan Kennedy by 295 votes. The result, along with another by-election win on the same day, gave Premier Edward Schreyer a stable majority government in the provincial legislature. Walding served as a backbench supporter of the Schreyer government and developed a strong reputation for constituency work. He also chaired the private bills committee of the legislature and gave up his practice as an optician.

Walding voted against Schreyer&#x27;s decision to extend public funding to denominational schools in a free vote of the legislature. He faced a serious challenge from Kennedy in the 1973 election but won by 105 votes.

The New Democrats were defeated in the 1977 provincial election although Walding was personally re-elected with an increased plurality. After Schreyer&#x27;s appointment as Governor General of Canada in 1979, Walding endorsed Sidney Green in his unsuccessful bid to become interim NDP leader. He later supported Pawley, the successful candidate, at the party&#x27;s leadership convention.

The NDP returned to government in the 1981 provincial election. Walding was not appointed to cabinet, as some had expected. Instead, Pawley appointed him as speaker of the legislature on February 25, 1982. Over the next four years, his relationship with Pawley became increasingly strained.

In 1983 and 1984, Walding allowed the opposition Progressive Conservatives to stall passage of the Pawley government&#x27;s re-entrenchment of French-language rights. Initially, the Conservatives refused to enter the chamber to vote on the legislation, and Walding refused to call a vote in their absence. As a result, the division bells were allowed to ring for several hours at the end of each legislative day. When NDP cabinet minister Andy Anstett restricted the amount of time that the bells could ring, the Conservatives boycotted the assembly entirely. Walding still refused to call a vote. On February 21, 1984, he refused a direct request from Pawley to move the legislative agenda forward. The house was eventually prorogued with the issue still unresolved.

Many questioned the validity of Walding&#x27;s decision. Sidney Green, who had left the NDP by then and also opposed French-language re-entrenchment, still argued that Walding was wrong to give the Conservatives a means to disrupt the legislative process. Walding&#x27;s actions made him extremely unpopular with some segments of his party. He was challenged for the St. Vital NDP nomination in 1986 by Gerri Unwin and Sig Laser, and he defeated Laser by a single vote on the second ballot.

Walding was re-elected in the general election of 1986 with a reduced majority. The NDP was re-elected with a narrow majority government, and Pawley did not reappoint Walding as speaker.

As a backbencher, Walding spoke out against the Pawley government on several issues. He was particularly opposed to affirmative action legislation, which he regarded as discriminatory.

Walding voted for an opposition amendment to his party&#x27;s budget on March 8, 1988, despite having assured Finance Minister Eugene Kostyra that he would support it. Earlier in the year, longtime cabinet minister Laurent Desjardins had essentially ceased attending legislative sessions. As a result, Walding&#x27;s defection toppled the Pawley government. The NDP was roundly defeated in the general election that followed, in which Walding was not a candidate.

==Death and legacy==
He died at 69 after a short battle with cancer in 2007. He was survived by his wife, Valerie (who passed in 2020), and their children, Andrew, Phillip and Christine.

Ian Stewart has written a book about Walding&#x27;s political career, &quot;Just One Vote: Jim Walding&#x27;s nomination to constitutional defeat&quot; (2009). Stewart argues that Walding&#x27;s 1986 nomination victory set in motion a series of events that led to the defeat of the Meech Lake Accord on constitutional reform.

<doc id="1040508" wikidata="Q594801" url="?curid=1040508" title="Lockheed XF-90">
<text>The Lockheed XF-90 was built in response to a United States Air Force requirement for a long-range penetration fighter and bomber escort. The same requirement produced the McDonnell XF-88 Voodoo. Lockheed received a contract for two prototype XP-90s (redesignated XF-90 in 1948). The design was developed by Willis Hawkins and the Skunk Works team under Kelly Johnson. Two prototypes were built (s/n &quot;46-687&quot; and &quot;-688&quot;). Developmental and political difficulties delayed the first flight until 3 June 1949, with Chief Test Pilot Tony LeVier at the controls. Embodying the experience gained in developing the P-80 Shooting Star, the XF-90 shared some design traits with the older Lockheed fighter, albeit with swept-wings; however, this latter design choice could not sufficiently make up for the project’s underpowered engines, and the XF-90 never entered production.

==Design and development==
In response to a 1945 Army request for an advanced jet fighter, Lockheed proposed a jet powered initially by a Lockheed L-1000 axial flow turbojet, and then the General Electric J35. Further design refinements included using two Westinghouse J34 engines with afterburners. After data showed that a delta planform would not be suitable, the Lockheed Model 90 was built in 1947 as a mock-up.

The final design embodied much of the experience and shared the intake and low-wing layout of the previous P-80 Shooting Star, but with 35° swept-back wings, a sharply-pointed nose, and two Westinghouse J34-WE-11 axial-flow turbojet engines, providing a total thrust of 6,200 lbf (27.6 kN), mounted side-by-side in the rear fuselage and fed by side-mounted air intakes. The wings had leading edge slats, Fowler flaps, and ailerons on the trailing edge. The pressurized cockpit was fitted with an ejection seat and a bubble canopy. Proposed armament was six 20  mm (.79 in) cannons. The internal fuel was supplemented by wingtip-mounted tanks, bringing total fuel capacity to 1,665 gal (6,308 L). The use of 75ST aluminum rather than the then-standard 24ST aluminum alloy, along with heavy forgings and machined parts, resulted in a well-constructed, sturdy airframe. These innovations resulted in an aircraft with an empty weight more than 50% heavier than its competitors.

The first XF-90 used non-afterburning J34s, but these lacked the thrust for takeoff as rocket-assisted RATO were required for most of the first flights unless it carried a very low fuel load. The second (XF-90A) had afterburners installed which had been tested on an F-80 testbed. Even so, the aircraft remained underpowered.

==Testing and evaluation==
The XF-90 was the first USAF jet with an afterburner and the first Lockheed jet to fly supersonic, albeit in a dive. It also incorporated an unusual vertical stabilizer that could be moved fore and aft for horizontal stabilizer adjustment. Partly because Lockheed&#x27;s design proved underpowered, it placed second to McDonnell&#x27;s XF-88 Voodoo which won the production contract in September 1950, before the penetration fighter project was abandoned altogether.

Upon Lockheed losing the production contract, the two prototypes were retired to other testing roles. The first aircraft (&quot;46-687&quot;) was shipped to the NACA Laboratory in Cleveland, Ohio in 1953 for structural tests. It was no longer flyable, and its extremely strong airframe was tested to destruction. The other (&quot;46-688&quot;) survived three atomic blasts at Frenchman Flat within the Nevada Test Site in 1952.

==Notable appearances in media==
The XF-90 lived on as the jet fighter aircraft flown by the popular Blackhawks Squadron in the comic book series of the same name, first published by Quality Comics and later by DC Comics. The Blackhawks flew fictional &quot;B&quot; and later &quot;C&quot; models all through the 1950s until 1964. Both were improved, single engine production variants of the original twin-engine Lockheed XF-90.

==Aircraft disposition==

*46-0687 – tested to destruction at NACA lab in Cleveland, Ohio.
*46-0688 – on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. In 2003, the heavily damaged hulk was recovered from the Nevada Test Site and moved there. Its wings have been removed, and its nose was mangled by the nuclear blasts. During the decontamination process, all rivets were removed to purge radioactive sand. The aircraft is now on display in the museum&#x27;s Cold War gallery in a diorama depicting it on the Nevada Test Site.

<doc id="1040509" wikidata="Q835675" url="?curid=1040509" title="Freedom Call">
<text>Freedom Call is a German power metal band formed in 1998. The band tours regularly and the current line-up includes one original member, lead vocalist and songwriter, Chris Bay. Freedom Call has released 14 albums in total, eleven of these studio albums.

== Biography ==

=== Background ===
Freedom Call&#x27;s frontman Chris Bay gained a lot of his vocal ability from his grandfather, an opera singer with the Berlin State Opera, and his mother, who was a sought-after chorus singer. When only seven he began to play the guitar and by the time he was ten had tried his hand at the piano.

Having played in various local rock bands, Bay moved to Hamburg in 1990 and got his first serious gig when he worked with Zed Yago. From 1993 to 1996 Chris was a member of former Victory guitarist Hermann Frank&#x27;s band Moon Doc, with whom he recorded the albums &quot;Moon Doc&quot; (1995) and &quot;Get Mooned&quot; (1996).

=== Founding (1997–1998) ===
In 1998 Chris Bay and old friend Daniel Zimmermann formed Freedom Call during an off-period for the latter&#x27;s main band, Gamma Ray with the stated goal of making &quot;Happy Metal&quot;. The two had started writing songs together towards the end of 1997. They eventually completed a six-song demo &quot;Freedom Call&quot; with well-known producer Charlie Bauerfeind, who offered the tape to several record companies.

At the same time, the Freedom Call line up was completed by Ilker Ersin on bass guitar and Sascha Gerstner on guitar. In 1998 Chris and Dan had seen Sascha playing in a cover band.

=== &quot;Stairway to Fairyland&quot; and &quot;Crystal Empire&quot; (1999–2001) ===
Freedom Call&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Stairway to Fairyland&quot; was released on 7 May 1999 by NTS Records. &quot;Stairway to Fairyland&quot; would sell over 35,000 copies in the first year of its release. On 25 May 1999 Freedom Call made their live debut with a tour of France as support band for Angra and Edguy. At the end of August, Freedom Call commenced recording of the five-track mini LP &quot;Taragon&quot;. Taragon featured new songs, a cover version of Ultravox&#x27;s &quot;Dancing With Tears in My Eyes&quot;, a new version of &quot;Stairway to Fairyland&quot;, a new version of &quot;Tears of Taragon&quot; with Biff Byford, singer with Saxon narrating the &quot;Tale of Taragon&quot; on it. There was also a bonus track for Japan called &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;.

By the end of 1999, Freedom Call had entered the studio again to record their second album &quot;Crystal Empire&quot;, this released on 22 January 2001. &quot;Crystal Empire&quot; was promoted as the logical musical continuation of &quot;Stairway To Fairyland&quot;.

In March 2001 Sascha Gerstner left Freedom Call (he would later join Helloween). Gerstner was eventually replaced by Cédric &quot;Cede&quot; Dupont, the Swiss guitarist of Symphorce.

=== &quot;Eternity&quot; and &quot;The Circle of Life&quot; (2002–2006) ===
In the middle of January 2002 the new lineup began recording a new album called &quot;Eternity&quot;. Dan and Chris produced &quot;Eternity&quot; on their own this time as Charlie Bauerfeind was not available. He was, however, responsible for the drum recordings and the final mix. &quot;Eternity&quot; was released on 3 June 2002 by Steamhammer.

Later that year, Freedom Call was invited on tour with Blind Guardian. During this tour they recorded the live album, &quot;Live Invasion&quot; together with Charlie Bauerfeind in Düsseldorf, Stuttgart and Munich. &quot;Live Invasion&quot; was released on 10 May 2004 by SPV.

The keyboard player on this tour, Nils Neumann, was soon invited to become the fifth member of the band. After an extended break, the next album &quot;The Circle of Life&quot; was recorded at Hansen Studio, Hamburg and FC Studios, Nuremberg from August to October 2004. &quot;The Circle of Life&quot; was released on 21 May 2005 by SPV.

Shortly after the release of &quot;The Circle of Life&quot;, both Cédric &quot;Cede&quot; Dupont and Ilker Ersin decided to leave Freedom Call (independently of each other). Replacements were eventually announced in the form of newcomer guitarist Lars Rettkowitz and Armin Donderer, formerly of Paradox.

=== &quot;Dimensions&quot; (2007–2008) ===
A new album with the title &quot;Dimensions&quot; was released on 20 April 2007. Commenting on &quot;Dimensions&quot;, Daniel Zimmerman said: &quot;Even if the two predecessors, &quot;Eternity&quot; and &quot;The Circle of Life&quot;, took very different directions, both albums had a number of strong moments. &quot;Dimensions&quot; combines the most successful elements from both albums, in other words: we included our penchant for fast and very melodic numbers from &quot;Eternity&quot; with the more contemporary, bombastic components of &quot;The Circle of Life&quot;.&quot;

The songs &quot;The Wanderer&quot; and &quot;Dimensions&quot; were also used in the online rhythm game &quot;Flash Flash Revolution&quot;.

=== &quot;Legend of the Shadowking&quot; and &quot;Land of the Crimson Dawn&quot; (2009–2012) ===
In March 2009, the band announced that they were putting the finishing touches to a new album, &quot;Legend of the Shadowking&quot;, and that they had parted ways with bassist Armin Donderer, who would be replaced by Samy Saemann. &quot;Legend of the Shadowking&quot; was released on 29 January 2010 by SPV.

For the 2010 touring cycle, Dan Zimmerman announced that he would be replaced by Klaus Sperling as during this time he [Zimmerman] would be on the road with Gamma Ray. It was later confirmed on the band&#x27;s website that Zimmermann had officially left the band.

&quot;Live in Hellvetia&quot; was the first live DVD by Freedom Call. It was released on 20 May 2011 by SPV. &quot;Live in Hellvetia&quot; was recorded on 29 December 2010 in Z7 Pratteln, Switzerland.

The title of the next Freedom Call studio album, &quot;Land of the Crimson Dawn&quot;, was announced in September 2011. Chris Bay had previously announced that the band was working on the album and it would be released sometime in February 2012. &quot;Land of the Crimson Dawn&quot; was released 24 February 2012 by SPV.

=== &quot;Beyond&quot; and &quot;Master of Light&quot; (2013–present) ===
&quot;Ages of Light&quot; (1998–2013) is the first &quot;best-of&quot; compilation by Freedom Call. It was released on 26 April 2013 by SPV.

The band announced on 15 September 2013 that they were working on a new album, &quot;Beyond&quot;, with a new lineup. Ilker Ersin returned to the band to resume bass duties and Ramy Ali joined the band on drums.

A music video was filmed on 15 December 2013 for the song &quot;Union of the Strong&quot;. The shoot took place in the vicinity of Nuremberg and Franconia, the song was taken from the album &quot;Beyond&quot; that was released on 21 February 2014. A vinyl version of &quot;Beyond&quot; was released on 14 March 2014. &quot;Beyond&quot; was produced by Chris Bay and Stephan Ernst at the Separate Sound Studios in Nuremberg and at Freedom Call&#x27;s own studio.

In May 2015 Freedom Call released &quot;666 Weeks Beyond Eternity&quot;, a reissued edition of their 2002 studio album, &quot;Eternity&quot;. As the title suggests, &quot;666 Weeks Beyond Eternity&quot; was released 666 weeks after the release of the original album. The re-issue is a two disc set featuring the original &quot;Eternity&quot; album which has been remastered, plus it includes some bonus content on the second disc including live tracks, acoustic tracks, special versions of their songs, as well as a new song written exclusively for this release.
In support of the album release, the 666 Weeks Beyond Eternity Tour 2015 occurred between October 2015 (Glasgow, UK; 9 Oct) and December 2015 (Augsburg, Germany; 22 Dec).

In July 2016 Freedom Call launched a new Official Fanclub on Facebook.

Freedom Call&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Master of Light&quot; was released on 11 November 2016 (18 November in USA). The first single taken from the album (&quot;Hammer of the Gods&quot;) was released on 8 July 2016. A promotional video for the track &quot;Metal is for Everyone&quot; became available on 2 November 2016. Following a release party at Rockcafe Brown Sugar in Nürnberg on 10 November 2016, the four-city &quot;Master of Light&quot; Latin America tour ran from 25 November until 2 December 2016.

The &quot;Master of Light&quot; tour which began in 2016 continued through 2017 and in to 2018. Countries visited as part of the 2017–2018 legs of the tour included Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand and the UK. A number of festival dates also took place, with others scheduled for 2018 that included 70,000 Tons of Metal from 1 to 5 February 2018, and include Metalfest Open Air 2018 and Leyendas Del Rock 2018. The band&#x27;s 2024 full-length album was called Silver Romance and released in May by Steamhammer.

=== Chris Bay solo ===
In November 2017 Chris Bay announced that he would be releasing his first solo album, &quot;Chasing The Sun&quot;, on Steamhammer/SPV records on 23 February 2018. The first single from the album &quot;Radio Starlight&quot; was released on 1 December 2017. Of the album and its content Bay commented: &quot;I permanently write songs and am constantly working on ideas in the studio... ...that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve collected a whole lot of tracks over the years that on the one hand don&#x27;t really suit Freedom Call and on the other are just too good to gather dust in my archive.&quot; The second single from the album (Hollywood Dancer) was released on 2 February 2018.

<doc id="1040512" wikidata="Q3326322" url="?curid=1040512" title="Data corruption">
<text>Data corruption refers to errors in computer data that occur during writing, reading, storage, transmission, or processing, which introduce unintended changes to the original data. Computer, transmission, and storage systems use a number of measures to provide end-to-end data integrity, or lack of errors.

In general, when data corruption occurs, a file containing that data will produce unexpected results when accessed by the system or the related application. Results could range from a minor loss of data to a system crash. For example, if a document file is corrupted, when a person tries to open that file with a document editor they may get an error message, thus the file might not be opened or might open with some of the data corrupted (or in some cases, completely corrupted, leaving the document unintelligible). The adjacent image is a corrupted image file in which most of the information has been lost.

Some types of malware may intentionally corrupt files as part of their payloads, usually by overwriting them with inoperative or garbage code, while a non-malicious virus may also unintentionally corrupt files when it accesses them. If a virus or trojan with this payload method manages to alter files critical to the running of the computer&#x27;s operating system software or physical hardware, the entire system may be rendered unusable.

Some programs can give a suggestion to repair the file automatically (after the error), and some programs cannot repair it. It depends on the level of corruption, and the built-in functionality of the application to handle the error. There are various causes of the corruption.

== Overview ==
There are two types of data corruption associated with computer systems: undetected and detected. Undetected data corruption, also known as &quot;silent data corruption&quot;, results in the most dangerous errors as there is no indication that the data is incorrect. Detected
data corruption may be permanent with the loss of data, or may be temporary when some part of the system is able to detect and correct the error; there is no data corruption in the latter case.

Data corruption can occur at any level in a system, from the host to the storage medium. Modern systems attempt to detect corruption at many layers and then recover or correct the corruption; this is almost always successful but very rarely the information arriving in the systems memory is corrupted and can cause unpredictable results.
Data corruption during transmission has a variety of causes. Interruption of data transmission causes information loss. Environmental conditions can interfere with data transmission, especially when dealing with wireless transmission methods. Heavy clouds can block satellite transmissions. Wireless networks are susceptible to interference from devices such as microwave ovens.
Hardware and software failure are the two main causes for data loss. Background radiation, head crashes, and aging or wear of the storage device fall into the former category, while software failure typically occurs due to bugs in the code.
Cosmic rays cause most soft errors in DRAM.

== Silent ==
Some errors go unnoticed, without being detected by the disk firmware or the host operating system; these errors are known as &quot;silent data corruption&quot;.

There are many error sources beyond the disk storage subsystem itself. For instance, cables might be slightly loose, the power supply might be unreliable, external vibrations such as a loud sound, the network might introduce undetected corruption, cosmic radiation and many other causes of soft memory errors, etc. In 39,000 storage systems that were analyzed, firmware bugs accounted for 5–10% of storage failures. All in all, the error rates as observed by a CERN study on silent corruption are far higher than one in every 1016 bits. Webshop Amazon.com has acknowledged similar high data corruption rates in their systems. In 2021, faulty processor cores were identified as an additional cause in publications by Google and Facebook; cores were found to be faulty at a rate of several in thousands of cores.

One problem is that hard disk drive capacities have increased substantially, but their error rates remain unchanged. The data corruption rate has always been roughly constant in time, meaning that modern disks are not much safer than old disks. In old disks the probability of data corruption was very small because they stored tiny amounts of data. In modern disks the probability is much larger because they store much more data, whilst not being safer. That way, silent data corruption has not been a serious concern while storage devices remained relatively small and slow. In modern times and with the advent of larger drives and very fast RAID setups, users are capable of transferring 1016 bits in a reasonably short time, thus easily reaching the data corruption thresholds.

As an example, ZFS creator Jeff Bonwick stated that the fast database at Greenplum, which is a database software company specializing in large-scale data warehousing and analytics, faces silent corruption every 15 minutes. As another example, a real-life study performed by NetApp on more than 1.5 million HDDs over 41 months found more than 400,000 silent data corruptions, out of which more than 30,000 were not detected by the hardware RAID controller (only detected during scrubbing). Another study, performed by CERN over six months and involving about 97 petabytes of data, found that about 128 megabytes of data became permanently corrupted silently somewhere in the pathway from network to disk.

Silent data corruption may result in cascading failures, in which the system may run for a period of time with undetected initial error causing increasingly more problems until it is ultimately detected. For example, a failure affecting file system metadata can result in multiple files being partially damaged or made completely inaccessible as the file system is used in its corrupted state.

== Countermeasures ==
When data corruption behaves as a Poisson process, where each bit of data has an independently low probability of being changed, data corruption can generally be detected by the use of checksums, and can often be corrected by the use of error correcting codes (ECC).

If an uncorrectable data corruption is detected, procedures such as automatic retransmission or restoration from backups can be applied. Certain levels of RAID disk arrays have the ability to store and evaluate parity bits for data across a set of hard disks and can reconstruct corrupted data upon the failure of a single or multiple disks, depending on the level of RAID implemented. Some CPU architectures employ various transparent checks to detect and mitigate data corruption in CPU caches, CPU buffers and instruction pipelines; an example is &quot;Intel Instruction Replay&quot; technology, which is available on Intel Itanium processors.

Many errors are detected and corrected by the hard disk drives using the ECC codes which are stored on disk for each sector. If the disk drive detects multiple read errors on a sector it may make a copy of the failing sector on another part of the disk, by remapping the failed sector of the disk to a spare sector without the involvement of the operating system (though this may be delayed until the next write to the sector). This &quot;silent correction&quot; can be monitored using S.M.A.R.T. and tools available for most operating systems to automatically check the disk drive for impending failures by watching for deteriorating SMART parameters.

Some file systems, such as Btrfs, HAMMER, ReFS, and ZFS, use internal data and metadata checksumming to detect silent data corruption. In addition, if a corruption is detected and the file system uses integrated RAID mechanisms that provide data redundancy, such file systems can also reconstruct corrupted data in a transparent way. This approach allows improved data integrity protection covering the entire data paths, which is usually known as &quot;end-to-end data protection&quot;, compared with other data integrity approaches that do not span different layers in the storage stack and allow data corruption to occur while the data passes boundaries between the different layers.

&quot;Data scrubbing&quot; is another method to reduce the likelihood of data corruption, as disk errors are caught and recovered from before multiple errors accumulate and overwhelm the number of parity bits. Instead of parity being checked on each read, the parity is checked during a regular scan of the disk, often done as a low priority background process. The &quot;data scrubbing&quot; operation activates a parity check. If a user simply runs a normal program that reads data from the disk, then the parity would not be checked unless parity-check-on-read was both supported and enabled on the disk subsystem.

If appropriate mechanisms are employed to detect and remedy data corruption, data integrity can be maintained. This is particularly important in commercial applications (e.g. banking), where an undetected error could either corrupt a database index or change data to drastically affect an account balance, and in the use of encrypted or compressed data, where a small error can make an extensive dataset unusable.

<doc id="1040518" wikidata="Q903613" url="?curid=1040518" title="Zombi 2">
<text>Zombi 2 is a 1979 Italian zombie film directed by Lucio Fulci, from a screenplay by Elisa Briganti and an uncredited Dardano Sacchetti, and starring Tisa Farrow, Ian McCulloch, Richard Johnson, Al Cliver, Auretta Gay and Olga Karlatos. It serves as an unofficial sequel to George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978), which was released in Italy under the title &quot;Zombi&quot;. 

The film is set at a Caribbean island cursed by voodoo whose dead residents rise as zombies to attack the living. A scientist&#x27;s daughter journeys to the island after her father&#x27;s boat turns up abandoned in New York City. Intended by its writer as a return to &quot;classic zombie tales&quot;, &quot;Zombi 2&quot; was filmed in Italy, with further location shooting in New York and Santo Domingo. The film features a score by frequent Fulci collaborator Fabio Frizzi.

Produced on a small budget of 410 million Italian lira, the film earned several times its production costs back in international gross. It attracted controversy upon its release in the United Kingdom, where it screened as &quot;Zombie Flesh Eaters&quot;, where it became listed as a &quot;video nasty&quot;. However, in the subsequent years the film received a greater appreciation from critics, and has gained a cult following. Fabio Frizzi&#x27;s score has been released independently of the film, and he has performed it live on tour.

==Plot==
An abandoned boat drifts into New York Harbor and is boarded by two harbor patrolmen. A hidden zombie kills one of the patrolmen but is shot by the patrolman&#x27;s partner and falls overboard; the dead patrolman&#x27;s body is taken to the morgue. Police questioned Anne Bowles, as the boat belonged to her father. She claims he is researching Matul, a Caribbean island. Journalist Peter West investigates the story; he and Bowles learn that Bowles&#x27; father suffers from a strange illness on the island. They hire a boat and two guides—Brian Hull and his girlfriend, Susan Barrett—to reach Matul.

Meanwhile, on Matul, doctor David Menard and his wife Paola have been researching the phenomenon of zombie reanimation. Paola wishes to flee the island, but Menard insists on staying. That night, Paola is alone in the house when a zombie tries to enter; she pushes the door shut, but it breaks through with one arm. Paola is dragged through the hole and killed when her eye is gouged out by splintered wood.

Approaching Matul, Barrett dives into the ocean around the boat. She encounters a shark and flees behind a reef, where a submerged zombie accosts her. Surfacing, she reaches the boat while the shark and zombie attack each other. Eventually, the boat docks at Matul.

Menard is alarmed to find that one of his colleagues, Fritz, has died of the zombie infection and tells his remaining staff to shoot all the dead bodies in their heads. While digging a grave for a body, he hears a signal flare and follows it to discover the boat group. Menard sends them back to his mansion to fetch his wife, where they discover Paola&#x27;s corpse being eaten by zombies. The group fends off an attack against them and escapes in a jeep, with West suffering an ankle injury when the vehicle veers off-road after slamming into a zombie. Resting in a jungle clearing, the group realises they have stumbled upon a Conquistador-era graveyard; Barrett is killed when one of the corpses rises from the earth and bites out her throat.

As more corpses reanimate, the group flees to the local hospital, where Menard explains that the dead are rising as a result of a voodoo curse that he has been trying to stop. Zombies besiege the hospital, and a reanimated Fritz kills Menard. As the zombies attempt to enter, those being treated for infection inside the hospital also reanimate, killing several hospital staff who have stayed behind. As the dead outside breach the door, Bowles, West, and Hull set the building on fire and start to shoot the zombies; the undead Barrett bites Hull in the arm but is hit by West. Bowles, West, and Hull escape to the boat and leave the island. At sea, Hull dies of his infection, and his body is locked in a cabin to be used as evidence of what has happened. 

However, as the boat approaches New York again, a radio broadcast reports that the city is under attack from zombies—the result of the initial attack in the harbor.

Director Lucio Fulci makes a cameo appearance as Peter&#x27;s news editor.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
&quot;Zombi 2&quot; serves as a sequel to &quot;Zombi&quot;, a re-edited European release of George A. Romero&#x27;s 1978 film &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;. &quot;Zombi&quot; had been edited by Dario Argento and given a new score by the Italian band Goblin, and proved successful upon its release in Italy. As Italian copyright law allows any film to be marketed as a sequel to another work, the film was quickly greenlit and financed by producer Fabrizio De Angelis. Enzo G. Castellari was offered to direct &quot;Zombi 2&quot;, but turned it down as he did not feel he would be the right director for a horror film. Director Lucio Fulci was De Angelis&#x27; second choice for the project, and was hired based on his handling of violent scenes in his previous films &quot;Sette note in nero&quot; and &quot;Non si sevizia un paperino&quot;. Fulci claimed to not having knowledge of the film&#x27;s title including &quot;2&quot; as a way to tie in with &quot;Dawn&quot;, and was very displeased with his inability to protest the film&#x27;s distributors.

Screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti had already worked with Fulci on &quot;Sette note in nero&quot;. Sacchetti has since stated that his initial script for &quot;Zombi 2&quot;—originally written under the title &quot;Nightmare Island&quot;—had been influenced by &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot; and had been intended to return to &quot;classic zombie tales&quot;, such as &quot;I Walked with a Zombie&quot;, &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; or &quot;Voodoo Island&quot;. Sacchetti began work on this script in July 1978, before it was optioned by Angelis&#x27; company Variety Films that December and re-tooled as &quot;Zombi 2&quot;. Sacchetti is uncredited on the final film screenplay, which is solely credited to his wife Elisa Briganti.

Lead star Ian McCulloch was cast primarily on the success in Italy of the 1975 BBC television series &quot;Survivors&quot;, which had impressed producer Ugo Tucci. Richard Johnson had previously appeared in a string of Italian genre productions: Ovidio G. Assonitis&#x27; &quot;Beyond the Door&quot; (1974), Massimo Dallamano&#x27;s &quot;The Cursed Medallion&quot; (1975), and Sergio Martino&#x27;s &quot;Island of the Fishmen&quot; (1979).

===Filming===
Production occurred during June and July 1979. Filming took place in Latina, Italy, as well as in New York City and Santo Domingo. Several of the actors&#x27; contracts had specified being provided with trailers for the duration of production. However, none were present when filming started and only Johnson was able to convince the producers to provide one. McCulloch and Johnson had known each other for many years by the time they collaborated on &quot;Zombi 2&quot;, having first met while they were members of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1962, with the younger McCulloch coming to idolise Johnson&#x27;s work.

The special makeup effects were created by Giannetto De Rossi, who had previously worked with Fulci on &quot;The Eroticist&quot; (1972).

The underwater scene featuring a shark attack was devised by Ugo Tucci, and was shot without Fulci&#x27;s approval, by De Rossi, in Isla Mujeres. According to the book &quot;Il terrorista dei generi. Tutto il cinema di Lucio Fulci&quot;, the zombie portrayed by a local shark trainer. Multiple other sources identify the trainer as Ramón Bravo, a Mexican underwater photographer and filmmaker known for his work documenting sharks. An article in &quot;Little White Lies&quot; states the zombie was originally supposed to be played by filmmaker René Cardona Jr., who had worked with Bravo on the shark-themed film &quot;Tintorera&quot; (1977), but fell ill on the day of shooting.

==Soundtrack==

The score to &quot;Zombi 2&quot; was composed by Fabio Frizzi, who frequently scored Fulci&#x27;s works, including &quot;Sette note in nero&quot;, &quot;I quattro dell&#x27;apocalisse&quot; and &quot;Sella d&#x27;argento&quot; previously. &quot;Zombi 2&quot; marked the first time the two had worked together on a straight horror movie as opposed to their previous spaghetti Western and &quot;giallo&quot; work. Frizzi would go on to compose for many more horror films with and without Fulci.

Frizzi&#x27;s work on &quot;Zombi 2&quot;—particularly &quot;Seq. 6&quot;, the sequence composed for the eye-gouging scene—was inspired by the melody of the Beatles&#x27; 1967 song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. Elsewhere in the score, Frizzi included Caribbean musical cues, which he noted were intended to &quot;pleasantly deceive&quot; the audience. A medley of the score was later included as part of Frizzi&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Fulci 2 Frizzi&quot; live tour, including the 2014 live album release &quot;Fulci 2 Frizzi: Live at Union Chapel&quot;. The score itself was released on vinyl by Death Waltz Records in 2015, with new artwork by Tom Beauvais.

===Track listing===

==Release==
&quot;Zombi 2&quot; was first released on 25 August 1979 in Italy with a running time of 91 minutes, before being released in English-speaking markets in 1980. The film would go on to gross over ₤3,000,000,000 worldwide, significantly higher than its ₤410,000,000 budget. &quot;Zombi 2&quot; has also been released under the titles &quot;Sanguella&quot;, &quot;The Island of the Living Dead&quot;, &quot;Zombie Flesh Eaters&quot;, &quot;Zombie&quot;, &quot;Zombie: The Dead Walk Among Us&quot;, &quot;Gli Ultimi Zombi&quot;, &quot;Woodoo&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Enfer de Zombies&quot;, &quot;Zombie 2: The Dead Are Among Us&quot; and &quot;Nightmare Island&quot;.

Upon its release in the United Kingdom on 2 January 1980, the British Board of Film Classification required a total of one minute and forty-six seconds of material to be cut in order to obtain an X rating; its most recent home release on 1 August 2005 passed for an 18 rating with no cuts required. However, the 1980 release found itself classified as a &quot;video nasty&quot;, having been considered a breach of the Obscene Publications Act. This classification, and the de facto &quot;ban&quot; it involved, has subsequently been used for publicity when advertising future home video releases.

==Home media==
&quot;Zombi 2&quot; has been released several times on home video, beginning with a 1981 VHS version by VIPCO (Video Instant Picture Company) following the theatrical cuts directed by the BBFC. VIPCO produced an uncut release, marketed as the &quot;strong uncut version&quot;, on VHS the following year. This is the release which was widely confiscated as a &quot;video nasty&quot;. Further VHS releases followed in 1991 and 1994, with the latter being edited for widescreen viewing. The film was first released on DVD by VIPCO in 2004 with minor cuts, and uncut by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2005. Other DVD releases include a 2004 version by Cornerstone Media, and a 2012 DVD and Blu-ray combination version by Arrow Films. A 4K Ultra HD version was later issued by Blue Underground in 2020

==Reception==
&quot;Zombi 2&quot; grossed higher in the domestic Italian box office than its predecessor, leading to future sequels—Fulci began directing &quot;Zombi 3&quot; before illness forced him to hand over the reins to Bruno Mattei and Claudio Fragasso, the latter of whom would also direct &quot;Zombi 4&quot;. The film was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Make-up at the 8th Saturn Awards in 1981.

In a contemporary review, Tom Milne reviewed an 89-minute English-language dub in the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; and compared the film to &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;. While noting that the cast was competent and the film featured &quot;sometimes effective make-up work&quot;, Milne opined that the film &quot;lacks—for all weaknesses of Romero&#x27;s film—even a tenth of the minatory charge harboured by &quot;Zombies&quot;.&quot; The review noted that the censorship trimmed a &quot;promisingly gruesome sequence&quot; with a corpse undergoing an autopsy. In Italy, &quot;La Stampa&quot; described the film as &quot;pedestrian&quot;, as well finding it hard to bear Olga Karlatos&#x27; character&#x27;s death scene.

The 1980 film &quot;Zombie Holocaust&quot; features several of the same cast, crew, and locations, and is something of a spiritual sequel.

=== Retrospective reviews ===
In a 2012 review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Phelim O&#x27;Neill described the film as &quot;the ultimate undead movie&quot;, praising its commitment to gory scenes and convincing effects. O&#x27;Neill felt that the film stood the passage of time well, and explained that this was &quot;because it delivers, plain and simple&quot;. He also highlighted Frizzi&#x27;s work on the score, and summed the film up as &quot;a real influence on what followed&quot;. Anne Billson, writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2013, included &quot;Zombi 2&quot; in her list of the top ten zombie films, describing its opening scenes as &quot;sublimely creepy&quot; and the eye-gouging scene as &quot;memorably nasty&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, James Kloda praised Fulci&#x27;s directing, finding that he consistently made evocative use of particular shots to accentuate the film&#x27;s action or horror. Kloda felt that the film &quot;can often blind with its shock violence but is well worth the look&quot;.

Writing for AllMovie, Robert Firsching described &quot;Zombi 2&quot; as a &quot;relatively well made shocker&quot; which &quot;led to the zombie-gore film becoming the dominant motif of 1980s Italian horror&quot;. Firsching rated the film three stars out of five. &quot;Empire&quot; Kim Newman awarded the film two stars out of five, chalking up much of its &quot;video nasty&quot; reputation to the &quot;eye gouging&quot; scene, comparing this unfavourably to similar material in 1929&#x27;s &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot;. Newman did compliment several sequences as interesting, particularly one underwater scene depicting a zombie attacking a shark, but found that overall the film did not &quot;keep up the pace or plausibility sufficiently&quot;.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 42% based on , with a weighted average rating of 5.30/10. Its consensus reads &quot;&quot;Zombi 2&quot; is an absurdly graphic zombie movie legendary for some gory scenes and nothing in between&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 54 out of 100 based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

<doc id="1040524" wikidata="Q35448" url="?curid=1040524" title="Pyotr Krasnov">
<text>Pyotr Nikolayevich Krasnov (; – 17 January 1947), also known as Peter Krasnov, was a Russian military leader, writer and later Nazi collaborator.

Krasnov served as a lieutenant general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and later led anti-Bolshevik forces during the Russian Civil War, where he served as the ataman of the Don Republic. Approximately 25,000 to 40,000 people were executed by Krasnov&#x27;s White Cossacks, which lasted until the Red Army conquered the region following their victory at Tsaritsyn.

After the civil war, he lived in exile. During World War II, Krasnov collaborated with the Germans who mobilized Cossack forces to fight against the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. Following the end of the war, Krasnov was repatriated and executed by the Soviet authorities.

== Early life and service ==
Pyotr Krasnov was born on 22 September 1869 (old style: 10 September) in Saint Petersburg, son to lieutenant-general Nikolay Krasnov and grandson to general Ivan Krasnov. In 1888 Krasnov graduated from Pavlovsk Military School and joined the Ataman regiment of the Life Guards of the Imperial Russian Army.

In April–May 1902 a series of articles were published in &quot;Russkii Invalid&quot;, the newspaper of the Imperial Russian Army, containing Krasnov&#x27;s impressions of his trip to Mongolia, China and Japan as the East Asia correspondent of &quot;Russkii Invalid&quot;. In his article &quot;Fourteen Days in Japan&quot;, Krasnov painted the Imperial Japanese Army in a negative light. One staff officer of the Main Staff called Krasnov&#x27;s article &quot;poorly founded, extraordinarily hasty and far from the truth&quot;. Krasnov reported that based on what he had seen in Japan that &quot;the Japanese looks coldly on life and death and does not fear death&quot;. He reported that the Japanese soldiers were up to European standards of discipline, but were highly rigid in their conduct of operations and suffered from health problems. Krasnov mockingly noted that during the march on Beijing during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, exhausted Japanese soldiers had to be carried in the wagons of the Russian Army. Krasnov noted during the assault on the forts at Tianjin that one Japanese company had lost 90% of its men during a frontal assault on a Chinese fort while at the same time a Russian company had taken a Chinese fort by outflanking it, losing only six men killed.

Krasnov felt that the Japanese were brave, but poorly led, declaring &quot;the military deed does not suit the Japanese&quot; as it &quot;was thought up for them by a chauvinist government of complete militarist conviction&quot;. About the Japanese infantry, Krasnov wrote the &quot;Japanese soldier is weak and an indifferent marksman, although amenable to training and able to discharge exactly and well what he has learned, regardless of the cost&quot;. Krasnov declared &quot;the language of numbers is not my language&quot;, stating though the Japanese could mobilize 400,000 troops in 335 battalions and 104 squadrons with 1,903 artillery guns, they would be little match against &quot;European powers holding excellent positions on the Asian mainland&quot;. Krasnov had an equally low opinion of the Japanese cavalry, writing that the Japanese had &quot;neither the horses nor riders to create cavalry&quot;. Krasnov declared &quot;to destroy all 13 regiments of the Japanese cavalry would be a very easy task&quot;. He concluded that once the Japanese cavalry had been defeated &quot;a deaf and blind Japanese army would become a plaything for an enterprising partisan commander&quot; and &quot;a detachment of 2,000 cavalry easily might tire a Japanese division&quot;. Krasnov quoted a Frenchman who lived a decade in Japan as saying: &quot;They are a people gone astray, the military deed is not in their nature&quot;, to which Krasnov added &quot;I think that this minute they are contemplating the same thing in St. Petersburg&quot;. Though the Main Staff officers deplored Krasnov&#x27;s article with his sweeping generalizations based upon superficial impressions, the Emperor Nicholas II was said to have read and enjoyed his article while Krasnov&#x27;s articles about his trip through Asia were turned into a book with a grant from the War Ministry.

== World War I and Revolution ==
During World War I he commanded the 2nd Combined Cossack Division from 1915 to 1917, and in September–October 1917, the 3rd Cavalry Corps. During the Brusilov offensive in the summer of 1916, the 2nd Combined Cossack Division was the first unit to achieve a breakthrough against Austro-Hungarian positions at the Battle of Lutsk, and Krasnov was injured by a bullet to the leg. He was put in command of the 3rd Cavalry Corps in September 1917 after elements of it took part in the Kornilov affair against the Russian Provisional Government. He restored discipline and morale among the 3rd Corps following the Kornilov affair, but initially tried to stay out of politics.

During the October Revolution of 1917, the deposed head of the Russian Provisional Government Alexander Kerensky appointed Krasnov commander of the 700 Cossacks who marched on Petrograd from Pskov () to suppress the Bolshevik revolt (see Kerensky-Krasnov uprising). These Cossacks were from two regiments of the 1st Don Cossack Division. On 15 November, Bolshevik troops surrounded Gatchina Palace, and took Krasnov prisoner, but he was soon released by Leon Trotsky, whereupon he made his way to the Don.

== Russian Civil War ==
Krasnov fled to the Don region. In May 1918, in Novocherkassk, he won election as the &quot;Ataman&quot; of the Don Cossack Host. The American historian Richard Pipes described Krasnov as an &quot;opportunist and an adventurer&quot;, primarily interested in using the Civil War to advance his own interests. Though the White movement was officially committed to overthrowing the Bolsheviks in order to resume the war with Germany, Krasnov entered negotiations with the Germans who were occupying Ukraine with the aim of securing their support, portraying himself as willing to serve as a pro-German warlord in the Don region, which made him the object of much distrust in the Allied governments. The Germans had set up the Ukrainian Zaporizhian Cossack Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi as the puppet leader of Ukraine in April 1918, and Krasnov indicated his willingness to serve as a leader of a set-up similar to the Skoropadskyi regime. Through not willing to formally embrace Cossack separatism, Krasnov as the first elected &quot;Ataman&quot; of the Don Host for centuries favored more autonomy for the Don Host than the Host had enjoyed in the Imperial period.
With support from Germany, Krasnov equipped his army, which ousted the Soviets from the Don region in May–June 1918. By the middle of June, a Don Army was in the field with 40,000 men, 56 guns and 179 machine-guns. On 11 July 1918 Krasnov wrote a letter to Wilhelm II declaring that the Cossacks had always been friends of the &quot;Reich&quot; and went on to say: &quot;The glorious Don Cossacks have been engaging in fighting for their freedom for two months and the fight resulted in their complete victory. The Cossacks have fought with a courage only equaled by that displayed against the English by a people of Germanic stock, the Boers&quot;.Krasnov&#x27;s relations with the Volunteer Army became strained on account of his pro-German views; furthermore, he was only willing to have the Don Cossacks serve with the Volunteer Army if he was made Supreme Commander-in-Chief of all the White forces, a demand that was rejected by Denikin and the other White generals. As the Don Cossack Host outnumbered the Volunteer Army until the summer of 1919, the Volunteer Army&#x27;s commander, General Anton Denikin (in office 1918–1920), was at a disadvantage in his negotiations with Krasnov. Members of the White movement generally saw Krasnov as a petty and self-interested warlord, only willing to act if there was something of benefit to him on offer. Throughout the Russian Civil War, the Don Cossack Host kept its own identity, with the Don Cossacks serving under their elected colonels in their own regiments, apart from the rest of the White armies. Krasnov wanted Denikin to advance on and take the city of Tsaritsyn (modern Volgograd) on the Volga to end the possibility of the Soviet Red Army entering the Don region, a demand that Denikin opposed. Krasnov so desperately wanted to secure Tsaritsyn that he even offered to have Don Cossacks temporarily serve under Denikin&#x27;s command if he was willing to advance on Tsaritsyn, but Denikin had other plans.

Viewing Krasnov as unreliable and untrustworthy, Denikin instead decided to launch the Second Kuban Campaign of June–November 1918, taking his army south to the territory of the Kuban Cossack Host to raise more men and to take on the Red North Caucasian Army before turning north towards Moscow. Moscow become the Soviet capital in March 1918 as Lenin had decided that Petrograd (modern St Petersburg) was too exposed to the German Army, which had occupied what is now the Baltic states. Denikin viewed the Kuban Cossacks as more willing to help than Krasnov and his Don Cossacks, who tended to put their own interests first. General Vyacheslav Naumenko, the field &quot;ataman&quot; of the Kuban Host, was known to be more willing to work with the White generals. Denikin also believed that he needed to liquidate the 70,000-strong Red North Caucasian Army first before advancing on Moscow, arguing that an advance on Moscow would be impossible with a threat to his rear. Denikin&#x27;s decision to turn the Volunteer Army south to the Kuban rather than north to Moscow became one of the most controversial of the Russian Civil War - by not advancing north in 1918 Denikin missed his best chance of linking up with the White forces in Siberia under Admiral Alexander Kolchak, who were advancing west along the Trans-Siberian Railway in the direction of Moscow.

In the second half of 1918 Krasnov advanced towards Povorino-Kamyshin-Tsaritsyn, intending to march on Moscow on his own, but was defeated. In the siege of Tsaritsyn in November–December 1918, Krasnov sent his Cossacks repeatedly to storm Tsaritsyn, only to see them cut down by Red machine-gun and artillery fire. Following his defeat at Tsaritsyn, Krasnov returned to the territory of the Don Cossack Host and refused all offers to co-ordinate with Denikin unless he was made Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Whites first. After Germany&#x27;s defeat (November 1918) in World War I, Krasnov set his sights on the Entente powers in his search for allies. Under the terms of the armistice of 11 November 1918 ending World War One, Germany was required to pull out its forces out of all the territory gained by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

The defeat of the Ottoman Empire in October 1918 allowed British, French and American naval forces to enter the Black Sea and for the first time allowed direct contact between the Allies and the Whites. Krasnov appealed to the French, offering to allow them to establish a protectorate over the Don Host in an effort to sow discord between the Allies as the territory of the Don Host had assigned beforehand during discussions among Allied leaders to the British sphere of operations. However, Krasnov was informed by Allied diplomats that the Allies would not supply him with arms, arms would be supplied only to the Volunteer Army, which would then pass on arms to the Don Cossack Host if necessary. In January 1919 Krasnov was forced by the Allied arms embargo against the Don Host to acknowledge General Denikin&#x27;s authority over the White movement, despite his animosity towards Denikin.

Krasnov was an organizer of the White Terror in the Don Province; his troops executed between 25,000 and 40,000 people.

==Exile in France and Germany==
On February 19, 1919, Krasnov fled to Western Europe after losing the election for the office of Don Ataman. He was succeeded by Afrikan P. Bogaewsky. Arriving first in Germany, he moved to France in 1923, where he continued his anti-Soviet activities. In France Krasnov was one of the founders of the Brotherhood of Russian Truth, an anti-communist organization with an underground network in Russia.

In exile, Krasnov wrote memoirs and several novels. His famous trilogy &quot;Ot Dvuglavogo Orla k krasnomu znameni&quot; (&quot;From Double Eagle To the Red Flag&quot;), in addition to the main plot, with its hero, General Sablin, has several sub-plots which encompass many places, events, and personages from the time of the Revolution of 1905 to the Russian Civil War. It presents a vast panorama of the Revolution and the Civil War throughout the country. Events are revealed through the fates of many characters, who, in turn, give their own interpretations of the events. Even the revolutionaries have an opportunity to express their views, although, in general, their political expositions seem to be the weakest parts of the novel. The ideology of the book is thus presented polyphonically. The author, although he tends to align himself with his conservative characters, offers no personal opinion of his own. All major themes, such as authority vs. anarchy, respect for human dignity vs. violence, creative work vs. destruction, as well as cruelty and terror, are treated in this polyphonic manner. Krasnov had begun writing &quot;From Double Eagle to the Red Flag&quot; when he was in prison in 1917, but the novel was first published in Russian in Berlin in 1921. The American historian Brent Muggenberg wrote that Krasnov had &quot;an impressive grasp of the motivations and mentalities&quot; on both sides in the Russian Civil War. The German historian Daniel Siemens described &quot;From Double Eagle to the Red Flag&quot; as a deeply antisemitic book that accepted &quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot; as genuine and accused &quot;international Jewry&quot; of inventing Communism. Siemens noted that the German translation of &quot;Ot Dvuglavogo Orla k krasnomu znameni&quot; was the favorite book of the Nazi martyr Horst Wessel. Other books written by Krasnov included a historical novel about a group of Don Cossacks resisting the French invasion of Russia in 1812 and another historical novel about Yermak Timofeyevich, the legendary 16th century Cossack conqueror of Siberia. Krasnov&#x27;s novels were translated into English, German, French, Serbian and other European languages. Despite his chequered military record, Krasnov was seen within émigré circles as a &quot;legendary hero of the Civil War&quot;.

Another of Krasnov&#x27;s novels was his 1927 work &quot;Za chertopolokhom&quot; (&quot;Behind the Thistle&quot;), a future history set in the 1990s that imagined a post-Communist Russia ruled over by a restored monarchy that had built an enormous wall around the entire empire to prevent any and all contact with the West. Though set in the future, the emperor who has chosen to isolate Russia from the West bears a strong resemblance in both appearance and personality to Ivan the Terrible. The novel begins with the Soviet Union launching an invasion of Eastern Europe sometime in the 1930s, which was to be started by an unleashing of an immense quantity of poisonous gases. However, the Soviet Air Force accidentally unleashed the deadly chemical gases on the Red Army, killing millions while setting off forest fires. The masses of corpses lead to an outbreak of plague, which rendered the borderlands of the Soviet Union uninhabitable for decades and led to a monstrous thistle standing several feet high growing up to in the borderlands. After the disaster, the rest of the world assumes that there is no life left behind the thistle.

In Krasnov&#x27;s future history, in Europe, socialist parties have come to power in all of the European nations, leading to an irrevocable economic decline over the course of the 20th century. By the 1990s as a result of decades of socialism, in all the European states food is being severely rationed, technological advances have ceased, housing is in short supply and the triumph of avant-garde has led to a cultural collapse. Disenchanted with life in a declining Europe, a hardy group of the descendants of Russian emigres who have managed to keep the Russian language and culture led by a man named Korenev climb over the thistle to see what lies behind it. Korenev has a dream featuring a beautiful girl threatened by the &quot;zmei gorynych&quot;, the gigantic, monstrous three-headed dragon of Russian mythology. The girl represents Russia while the &quot;zmei gorynych&quot; represents the West whose individualistic ideology that Krasnov portrayed as antithetical to Russian values. Korenev and his companions discover that in the world &quot;behind the thistle&quot; that the Communist regime was overthrown decades ago and was replaced with a restored monarchy. The restored monarchy has brought a return to the dress and culture of the era before the Emperor Peter the Great with the men growing long beards and wearing modified traditional costumes while the women wear the traditional sarafans and keep their hair in long braids. The ideology of the regime is based on the Official Nationality ideology of the Emperor Nicholas I, namely the triad of Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality while the only political party allowed is &quot;The Family of Russian Brothers and Sisters in the name of God and the Tsar&quot;. Jews are allowed a place in Krasnov&#x27;s utopia, but &quot;they no longer have the power to rule over us nor can they hide under false Russian names to infiltrate the government&quot;. All of the Russian characters &quot;behind the thistle&quot; speak in a pseudo-folksy way meant to evoke the Russian of the 16th and 17th centuries, which is portrayed as a more &quot;authentic&quot; Russian than modern Russian.

In contrast to the declining economies of the socialist West, the Russia that Krasnov imagines under the restored monarchy is economically and culturally flourishing while achieving marvelous technological feats such as building a sort of flying railroad system over the entire country and constructing vast canals that turn deserts into farmland. Every home in Russia has a television, which only airs the emperor&#x27;s daily speech to his subjects. Every subject has a personal library in their home consisting of traditional books such as dream-readers, patriotic poetry, folk tales and the Bible. However, the regime allows no freedom of expression and one of the returning emigres says: &quot;Some might say that the Russian government is now totalitarian, only this is not the same sort of totalitarianism as that of the Communists and the Masons of the West. They bow down to some invisible force, whose aim is destruction, but our society is founded on the bedrock of family and at its head is the Tsar, blessed by God, a man whose thoughts are only about the prosperity of Russia&quot;. The social order is enforced by the public floggings, torture and execution of any Russians who dare to think differently, and those who speak out &quot;return home with black stumps in place of their tongues&quot;. The narrator of the novel agrees that despite the use of extreme violence and cruelty by the restored Tsarist regime that the system that exists in Russia is superior to the &quot;rotting democratic West&quot;. The narrator of &quot;Behind the Thistle&quot; praises extreme violence committed by the state as not canceling out freedom, but rather &quot;is indeed true freedom, a freedom that democratic Europe had never known or experienced-a freedom for good deeds that goes hand in hand with oppression against evil&quot;.

Krasnov was an Eurasianist, an ideology that saw Russia as an Asian nation, having more in common with other Asian nations such as China, Mongolia, and Japan rather than with the Western nations. Some aspects of the novel such as its nostalgia for the pre-Peterine Russia have led to Krasnov being misidentified as a Slavophile, but he was opposed to the ideology of the Slavophiles, arguing that Russia had little in common with other Slavic nations such as Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia. In common with other Eurasianists, Krasnov believed that Russians had a natural affinity with the peoples of Asia, and in &quot;Behind the Thistle&quot; Russia has extremely friendly relations with other Asian nations such as China, Mongolia and India (through India was part of the British empire in 1927, Krasnov assumed India would be independent by the 1990s). Krasnov favored Asian values with the focus of putting the collective ahead of the individual, and for this reason, argued that Russia was an Asian nation that should look east towards other Asian nations instead of looking west. Unlike other Eurasianists who saw the Soviet Union as a &quot;stepping stone&quot; towards the development of a Eurasianist Russia, Krasnov&#x27;s anti-communism led to the rejection of the &quot;stepping stone thesis&quot;. In the 1920s-1930s, Krasnov was a popular novelist with his books being translated into 20 languages. &quot;Behind the Thistle&quot; however, met with an overwhelmingly negative critical response in 1927, being panned by reviewers in the majority of Russian émigré journals who called &quot;Behind the Thistle&quot; badly written, unrealistic and preachy. Despite the negative reviews, the expression &quot;behind the thistle&quot; became popular with the younger Russian emigres as a way describe the Soviet Union.

During the Berne Trial of 1933-35, started when a Swiss Jewish group sued a Swiss Nazi group, Krasnov was asked by his fellow emigre Nikolai Markov to come to Berne to testify for the defendants about the alleged authenticity of &quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot;, but he declined. Markov in turn was a member of the &quot;Welt-Dienst&quot;, an international antisemitic society based in Erfurt, Germany and headed by a former German Army officer, Ulrich Fleischhauer whose efforts to promote &quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot; in Switzerland had caused the lawsuit in Berne. In his correspondence with Markov, Krasnov affirmed his belief in the authenticity of &quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot;, but stated he was unwilling to be grilled by the lawyers for the plaintiffs.

In 1937, after several Russian White emigre leaders in Paris had been assassinated by the Soviet NKVD, Krasnov moved to Berlin where he believed he would be safer, and declared his support for the Third Reich. In another of his novels, &quot;The Lie&quot; in 1939, Krasnov wrote about one character: &quot;Lisa was right in her severe judgment: Russia was no more. She did not have a Motherland or her own. However, when the &quot;Bremen&quot; floated noiselessly by and she saw a black swastika in a white circle on a scarlet banner, a sign of eternal motion and continuum, she was feeling a warm tide covering her heart...That’s Motherland!&quot;

==World War II==
During World War II, Krasnov continued his &quot;German orientation&quot; by seeking an alliance with Nazi Germany. A major motivation on his part was the repression of the Cossacks and the Russian Orthodox Church by the Soviet government. Upon hearing of the launching of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, Krasnov immediately issued a statement of support for the &quot;crusade against Judeo-Bolshevism&quot; and declared: &quot;I wish to state to all Cossacks that this is not a war against Russia, but against Communists, Jews and their minions who trade in Russian blood. May God help the German sword and Hitler! Let them accomplish their endeavor, similar to what the Russians and Emperor Alexander I did for Prussia in 1813.&quot; By all accounts, Krasnov was extremely elated when he heard of Operation Barbarossa and believing it to be the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union and the &quot;liberation of Russia from Judeo-Bolshevism&quot;. Krasnov contacted Joseph Goebbels, the German Minister of Propaganda, and asked for permission to speak on Radio Berlin&#x27;s Russian language broadcasts to deliver pro-Nazi speeches, which was granted. From late June 1941 onward, Krasnov was a regular speaker on Radio Berlin&#x27;s Russian-language station and delivered very antisemitic speeches that portrayed the Soviet government as the rule of &quot;Judeo-Bolsheviks&quot; and the German forces advancing into the Soviet Union as liberators. Krasnov came into contact with officials of the &quot;Ostministerium&quot; (Eastern Ministry) headed by Alfred Rosenberg, the Baltic German émigré intellectual who besides being the &quot;official philosopher&quot; of the NSDAP was considered to be the resident Nazi expert on the Soviet Union.

In January 1943, Rosenberg appointed Krasnov to head the Cossack Central Office of the &quot;Ostministerium&quot;, making him the point man for the &quot;Ostministerium&quot; in its dealings with the Cossacks. The previous head of the Cossack Central Office, Nikolaus Himpel, who was a Baltic German like Rosenberg, had failed to inspire many Cossacks to join the German war effort. Just as Rosenberg, Himpel was fluent in Russian but spoke it with a pronounced German accent, which made him a figure of distrust to the Cossacks. Rosenberg realized that he needed a leader who was a Cossack himself to inspire more recruitment and turned to Krasnov after it was discovered that his first choice, the Prague-based Cossack separatist leader Vasily Glazkov, had no following. Krasnov was aged and had to walk with a cane, but he was known for his political skills. Though &quot;not universally popular&quot;, he was relatively well respected amongst the Cossacks as a former &quot;ataman&quot; of the Don Cossack Host and as a popular novelist. The Don Host was the largest and oldest of the 11 Hosts, which gave him a certain prestige as a former Don Host &quot;ataman&quot;. He managed to avoid for the most part the feuds that characterized the Russian diaspora, which made him an acceptable leader. He agreed to organise and head Cossack units out of White emigres and Soviet (mostly Cossack) prisoners of war, to be armed by the Nazis. The Nazis, in turn, expected Krasnov to follow their political line and to keep to a separatist Cossack orientation. Krasnov, who considered himself a Russian first and a Cossack second, was not in sympathy with Rosenberg&#x27;s notion of establishing a Nazi puppet state to be called &quot;Cossackia&quot; in southeastern Russia. Rosenberg favoured an approach that he called &quot;political warfare&quot; to &quot;free the German &quot;Reich&quot; from Pan-Slavic pressure for centuries to come&quot;. Rosenberg envisioned breaking up the Soviet Union into four puppet states and added Cossackia as the fifth puppet state in 1942.

In September 1943, the soldiers of the newly formed 1st SS Cossack Cavalry Division learned that their division would not, as expected be sent to fight on the Eastern Front, but would go to the Balkans to fight communist partisans. At the request of the division&#x27;s commander, General Helmuth von Pannwitz, Krasnov travelled to address the division. Krasnov tried to assuage the wounded feelings of the Cossacks, who did not want to go to the Balkans, by assuring them that the fight against the Partisans was part of the same struggle against &quot;the international Communist conspiracy&quot; on the Eastern Front, and he promised them if they did well in the Balkans, they would ultimately go to the Eastern Front.

On 31 March 1944, Rosenberg created a &quot;government-in-exile&quot; in Berlin for Cossackia headed by Krasnov, who, in turn, appointed &quot;ataman&quot; Naumenko of the Kuban Host as his &quot;minister of war&quot;. The &quot;government-in-exile&quot; was recognized only by Germany. At a meeting with the Cossack separatist Vasily Glazkov in Berlin in July 1944, Krasnov stated that he did not agree with Glazkov&#x27;s separatism but was forced under pressure from Rosenberg to appoint three supporters of Cossackia to important positions in the Cossack Central Office. In November 1944, Krasnov refused the appeal of General Andrey Vlasov to join the latter&#x27;s Russian Liberation Army. Krasnov disliked Vlasov as a former Red Army general, who had defected after his capture in 1942 and because as an old man, he was unwilling to submit to take orders from a much younger man. In addition to this, Krasnov demanded that Vlasov gave a guarantee that in the future Cossacks would receive all the rights they had under the tsarist government, and never reached any agreement with his movement despite all of Vlasov&#x27;s efforts. At the end of the war, Krasnov and his men voluntarily surrendered to British forces in Austria. All of them were promised upon surrender by Major Davis that as White Russian emigres, they would not be repatriated to the Soviets.

==Repatriation and execution ==

On 28 May 1945, Pyotr Krasnov was repatriated to the Soviets by the British authorities during Operation Keelhaul. The broken British promise not to hand Krasnov over to the Soviet authorities was influenced by the-then undetected Soviet spy at MI6, Kim Philby, who knew about Krasnov&#x27;s broken promise to the Soviet government back in late 1917 that he would not take up arms against the new regime in return for being released from prison. As a result of Operation Keelhaul and Philby&#x27;s actions, Krasnov was taken to Moscow and held in the Lubyanka prison. He was charged with various crimes: for working for Nazi Germany in World War II and for &quot;White Guardist units&quot; in the Russian Civil War. He was sentenced to death by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, together with General Andrei Shkuro, who was another former White movement general, and Timofey Domanov and Helmuth von Pannwitz. On 17 January 1947, he was hanged. The article in &quot;Pravda&quot; that announced his execution stated he had made a guilty plea to all charges; however, this claim is impossible to verify as his trial was not public.

==Legacy==
In 1994, a monument was erected in Moscow on the territory of the Church of All Saints, dedicated to the memory of &quot;von Pannwitz, A. G. Shkuro, P. N. Krasnov, Sultan Klych-Girey, T. N. Domanov, and other Russian soldiers, the Russian Corps, the Cossack camp, the Cossacks of the 15th SS Cossack Cavalry Corps, who fell for faith and Fatherland&quot;. On May 8, 2007, the marble slab was broken. A criminal case was even initiated on this fact under the article &quot;vandalism&quot;. The rector of the church, Archpriest Vasily Baburin, noted that this plate has nothing to do with the Church of All Saints: &quot;We ourselves would be happy to move this slab, because we do not want to participate in any political battles. The slab was installed at the end of the last century, but now the temple has nothing to do with it&quot;.

In 2014, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, a new plate &quot;To the Cossacks who fell for the Faith, the Tsar and the Fatherland&quot; was installed on the site of the broken plate. A memorial plaque to the generals of the Russian Imperial Army, including P. N. Krasnov, has been preserved nearby, but instead of the name of Krasnov (like A. G. Shkuro), the names of generals of the Russian Imperial Army, heroes of the First World War N. M. Remezov and P. A. Pleve are indicated on the plate.

On August 4, 2006, in the village of Yelanskaya in the Sholokhovsky district of the Rostov region, on the territory of a private house, a solemn opening of a memorial complex dedicated to the memory of the Don Cossacks who died in the struggle against Soviet power, including those who fought on the side of Hitler, took place. In the center of the memorial is a large bronze figure of the last ataman of the Don army, Pyotr Krasnov.

On July 30, 2008, the Prosecutor&#x27;s office of the Sholokhovsky district, at the request of State Duma deputy N. V. Kolomeitsev, initiated an administrative case on the installation of this monument. According to the prosecutor&#x27;s office, the reason for the demolition of the monument is that these sculptural objects are real estate objects and their installation requires permission, as well as the fact that this memorial praises the manifestation of fascism.

In 2017, on the eve of the 74th anniversary of the liberation of Rostov-on-Don from the German occupation, activists of the organization &quot;Essence of Time&quot; petitioned the executive and legislative authorities of the Russian Federation, demanding to dismantle the monument to Krasnov as an accomplice of the Third Reich and to stop schoolchildren from familiarizing themselves with the memorial dedicated to the Cossack collaborators.

In the issue of &quot;News of the Week&quot; dated April 26, 2020, TV presenter Dmitry Kiselev called for a monument to be erected in honor of Pyotr Krasnov. Discussing the role of Vladimir Lenin in the history of Russia, he stated: &quot;It is necessary to erect monuments to Kolchak, Wrangel, Denikin, Krasnov. &lt;...&gt; Everyone has their own contribution, their own idea and their own tragedy&quot;.

===Unsuccessful attempts of rehabilitation in modern Russia===
Nationalist and monarchist organizations, both in Russia and abroad, have repeatedly appealed to Russian state bodies with requests for the rehabilitation of individual Russian collaborators.

In accordance with the conclusions of the Main Military Prosecutor&#x27;s Office on the refusal to rehabilitate them, the definitions of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dated December 25, 1997, German citizens Krasnov P. N., Shkuro A. G., Sultan Klych-Girey, Krasnov S. N. and USSR citizen Domanov T. N. were recognized as reasonably convicted and not subject to rehabilitation, about which all initiators of appeals on the issue of rehabilitation of these persons have been notified.

Nevertheless, on January 17, 2008, ataman of the Don Cossacks, State Duma deputy from the ruling United Russia Viktor Vodolatsky signed a decree on the creation of a working group for the rehabilitation of Pyotr Krasnov in connection with a request from the organization &quot;Cossack Abroad&quot;. On January 28, 2008, the Council of atamans of the organization &quot;The Great Army of the Don&quot; adopted a decision in which it was noted: &quot;... historical facts indicate that an active fighter against the Bolsheviks during the Civil War, writer and publicist P. N. Krasnov collaborated with fascist Germany during the Great Patriotic War. &lt;...&gt; Attaching exceptional importance to the above, the Council of Atamans decided: to refuse the petition to the non-profit foundation &quot;Cossack Abroad&quot; in resolving the issue of political rehabilitation of P. N. Krasnov&quot;. Viktor Vodolatsky himself stressed: &quot;the fact of his cooperation with Hitler during the war makes the idea of his rehabilitation completely unacceptable to us&quot;. The initiative for rehabilitation was condemned by veterans of the Great Patriotic War and representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church.

<text>Welcome to Sky Valley (also known as Sky Valley and Kyuss) is the third studio album by American rock band Kyuss. It was released on June 28, 1994, through Elektra and Chameleon Records.

==Background and composition==
&quot;Welcome to Sky Valley&quot; was recorded in early 1993 and scheduled for release in January 1994. They sneak-previewed the completed album at Foundations Forum 93 and contributed the song &quot;Demon Cleaner&quot; to the sampler disc. Due to mild success from their previous album, Kyuss had been promoted from their subsidiary record label &quot;Dali&quot; to the main label &quot;Chameleon&quot;. On November 11, 1993, Chameleon Records abruptly shut down. Their joint-venture partner Elektra quickly picked up the band and scheduled the album for release in March 1994. The album was then delayed for another three months after that, eventually being released almost a year after being initially recorded.

&quot;Welcome to Sky Valley&quot; has been described as stoner rock and stoner metal. This is the first Kyuss album to feature bassist Scott Reeder, who replaced Nick Oliveri in 1992. &quot;Welcome to Sky Valley&quot; was the last to feature founding member Brant Bjork. The song &quot;N.O.&quot; was originally recorded by Across the River, a band fronted by Mario Lalli and featuring bassist Reeder. After Reeder left the Obsessed and joined Kyuss, Bjork suggested they record &quot;N.O.&quot; as a tribute to Across the River.

==Release==
On CD, &quot;Welcome to Sky Valley&quot; was originally released with its ten total songs contained in three tracks, with an additional, fourth hidden track. It was later re-released with all ten tracks separated individually. However, most commercially sold versions of the compact disc contain the three tracks, a setup which is meant to encourage listeners to experience it as a full album instead of as a collection of separate songs. Guitarist Josh Homme claimed in an interview that the band &quot;just wanted it to be like hell to play on a CD player&quot;. The album&#x27;s liner notes instruct the listener to &quot;Listen without distraction&quot;.

The band Tool covered &quot;Demon Cleaner&quot; live twice (albeit with slight lyrics changes), with bassist Scott Reeder joining them onstage during the performances: March 27, 1998, in Los Angeles, California, at The Hollywood Palladium, March 29, 1998, in San Diego, California, at The Rimac Theatre. The song is also featured in the video games &quot;Guitar Hero: Metallica&quot; and &quot;The Crew&quot;.

<doc id="1040533" wikidata="Q372394" url="?curid=1040533" title="Martin McDonagh">
<text>Martin Faranan McDonagh (; born 26 March 1970) is a British-Irish playwright and filmmaker. He is known for his absurdist dark humour which often challenges the modern theatre aesthetic. He has won numerous accolades including an Academy Award, six BAFTA Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and three Olivier Awards in addition to nominations for five Tony Awards.

His plays, many of which have been produced on the West End and on Broadway, include &quot;The Beauty Queen of Leenane&quot;, &quot;The Cripple of Inishmaan&quot; (both 1996), &quot;The Lonesome West&quot; (1997), &quot;The Lieutenant of Inishmore&quot; (2001), &quot;The Pillowman&quot; (2003), &quot;A Behanding in Spokane&quot; (2010), and &quot;Hangmen&quot; (2015).

McDonagh won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for &quot;Six Shooter&quot; and has received nominations for six other Academy Awards for his work on &quot;In Bruges&quot; (2007), &quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Banshees of Inisherin&quot; (2022). He directed the black comedy film &quot;Seven Psychopaths&quot; (2012) and was executive producer on &quot;The Second Death&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Guard&quot; (2011).
==Early life==
McDonagh was born on 26 March 1970 in Camberwell, London, to Irish parents. His mother (originally from Killeenduff, Easky, County Sligo) and his father (originally from Leitir Mealláin, Connemara, County Galway) moved back to Galway in 1992, but McDonagh and his brother (writer-director John Michael McDonagh) stayed in London.

==Career==
===Theatre===
Separated into two trilogies, McDonagh&#x27;s first six plays are located in and around County Galway, where he spent his holidays as a child. The first is set in Leenane, a small village on the west coast of Ireland, and consists of &quot;The Beauty Queen of Leenane&quot; (1996), &quot;A Skull in Connemara&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Lonesome West&quot; (1997). His second trilogy is set across the Aran Islands, off the coast of County Galway, and consists of &quot;The Cripple of Inishmaan&quot; (1996), &quot;The Lieutenant of Inishmore&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Banshees of Inisheer&quot;. The third play was never published, as McDonagh insisted it &quot;isn&#x27;t any good&quot;, though he expressed a desire to return to it when he is older. In 2022, McDonagh directed a film titled &quot;The Banshees of Inisherin.&quot; The screenplay&#x27;s resemblance to the play is unclear.

In 1999 he was one of the recipients of the V Europe Prize Theatrical Realities awarded to the Royal Court Theatre (with Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, Jez Butterworth, Conor McPherson).

McDonagh&#x27;s first non-Irish play, &quot;The Pillowman&quot;, is set in a fictitious totalitarian state and premiered at the Royal National Theatre in 2003, after a reading at the Finborough Theatre in 1995.

&quot;A Behanding in Spokane&quot; is McDonagh&#x27;s first play that is set in the United States and it premiered on Broadway in March 2010. Lead actor Christopher Walken was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance as a killer looking for the hand he lost in his youth.

McDonagh also penned two prize-winning radio plays, one of which is &quot;The Tale of the Wolf and the Woodcutter&quot;.

In February 2010, an announcement revealed that McDonagh was working on a new stage musical with composer Tom Waits and director Robert Wilson.

====The Leenane Trilogy====
The trilogy starts off with &quot;The Beauty Queen of Leenane&quot;, which is the story of the dysfunctional relationship between a spinster and her domineering mother, during the course of which the former faces her last chance at love, and the latter faces a rather grim end. The play was well received on its opening night in Galway in 1996 and was next produced off-Broadway by the Atlantic Theater Company in 1998. The play transferred to Broadway in April 1998 and was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Play.

The second part of the trilogy, &quot;A Skull in Connemara&quot;, involves a Connemara man who is employed to exhume skeletons in an overcrowded graveyard and he encounters the wife whom he was once accused of killing. The play premiered in 1997 at Town Hall Theatre, Galway. The play was presented at the Royal Court Theatre (London), and made its US premiere at the A Contemporary Theatre (ACT) in Seattle, Washington in July to August 2000. The play ran off-Broadway from January to May 2001 at the Gramercy Theatre, produced by the Roundabout Theatre.

The final part is titled &quot;The Lonesome West&quot;, a play involving two brothers bickering in the aftermath of the supposedly accidental fatal shooting of their father. The play ran on Broadway in 1999 and received a Tony Award nomination for Best Play in 1999.

====The Aran Islands Trilogy====
&quot;The Cripple of Inishmaan&quot; is a dark comedy in which a crippled teenager schemes to attain a role in &quot;Man of Aran&quot;. The play opened in 1997 at the Royal National Theatre (Cottesloe) in London. It opened in April 1998 Off-Broadway at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, with Ruaidhri Conroy in the title role on both occasions. Also in 1998, Frederick Koehler played the title role in the Geffen Playhouse production in Los Angeles, California. In December 2008, &quot;The Cripple of Inishmaan&quot; was produced Off-Broadway by the Atlantic Theater Company, in conjunction with The Druid Theatre Company of Galway, Ireland.

&quot;The Lieutenant of Inishmore&quot; is the followup play which was written as a response to the 1993 Warrington bombings when two children were killed by the IRA. It is a dark comedy in which the insane leader of an INLA (Irish National Liberation Army) splinter group discovers that his best friend, a cat, has been killed. The play was produced Off-Broadway in February 2006 by the Atlantic Theater Company. It transferred to Broadway in May 2006 and received a 2006 Tony Award nomination for Best Play.

&quot;The Banshees of Inisheer&quot;, the third play of the trilogy, was not produced. It is unclear how close the 2022 McDonagh-directed film &quot;The Banshees of Inisherin&quot; comes to the original material. The film&#x27;s screenplay was published in 2022.

====Other plays====
The Pillowman

A writer in a non-specified totalitarian state is interrogated over the content of several of his Brothers Grimm-style short stories. The play was awarded the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play in 2004 and received a 2005 Tony Award nomination for Best Play.

A Behanding in Spokane

A play in which the character of Carmichael has been searching for his missing left hand for a quarter of a century. The play opened on Broadway in March 2010. The play was nominated for the 2010 Drama League award, Distinguished Production of a Play.

Hangmen

A play following Harry Wade, England&#x27;s second-best hangman, after the abolition of hanging in Great Britain in 1965. The play premiered at the Royal Court Theatre, London, in September 2015. The play was awarded the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play in 2016. In 2020, &quot;Hangmen&quot; briefly premiered on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre starring Mark Addy and Dan Stevens before being shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The play returned on Broadway in 2022 this time with David Threlfall and Alfie Allen. The play received critical acclaim from critics including from &quot;The New York Times&quot; theatre critic Jesse Green who wrote, &quot;[&quot;Hangmen&quot;] feels like a perfect fit for our unjust times&quot;.

A Very Very Very Dark Matter

A play set in a townhouse in Copenhagen that reveals the dark source of the tales of children&#x27;s author Hans Christian Andersen, as well as of the writer Charles Dickens. It premiered at the Bridge Theatre, London in October 2018.

===Film===
McDonagh has stated that he prefers writing films to plays, as he holds a &quot;respect for the whole history of films and a slight disrespect for theatre.&quot; In a 1998 conversation with Irish drama critic Fintan O&#x27;Toole in &quot;BOMB&quot; magazine, McDonagh further explained,
It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t respect theatre. I&#x27;m intelligent enough to know that a play can completely inspire a person as much as a film...[but] theatre isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s connected to me, from a personal point of view, I can&#x27;t appreciate what I&#x27;m doing.In an interview in 2005, the &quot;New York Times&quot; writer observed that McDonagh &quot;now seems more comfortably resigned to the storytelling powers of drama, if still dismissive of its inherent elitism. &#x27;It&#x27;s kind of weird working in an art form that&#x27;s not, well ...,&#x27; he stops and starts again. &#x27;It&#x27;s strange to be working in an art form that costs $100 to participate in. In an interview with Sean O&#x27;Hagan of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, McDonagh said theatre &quot;is never going to be edgy in the way I want it to be&quot;, when discussing his absence from London theatre and promoting his new play &quot;Hangmen&quot;.

==== 2000s ====
In 2006, McDonagh won an Academy Award for his short film &quot;Six Shooter&quot; (2004), which is his first film that he wrote and directed. &quot;Six Shooter&quot; is a black comedy (as are his plays) that features Brendan Gleeson, Rúaidhrí Conroy, David Wilmot and Aisling O&#x27;Sullivan. It was shot on location in Wicklow, Waterford and Rosslare. In the short film, Gleeson&#x27;s character encounters a strange, and possibly psychotic, young man during a train journey homeward following his wife&#x27;s death.

McDonagh made a deal with Focus Features to direct &quot;In Bruges&quot;, a feature-length film based on his own screenplay. Two Irish hitmen hide in the Flemish city of Bruges after a problematic job. Released in the US in 2008, the film features Colin Farrell, Ralph Fiennes and Brendan Gleeson. &quot;In Bruges&quot; was the Opening Night film for the 2008 Sundance Festival and the Jameson Dublin International Film Festival, and McDonagh received a nomination for Best Original Screenplay at the 81st Academy Awards.

==== 2010s ====
In a 2008 interview with &quot;Stop Smiling&quot; magazine, McDonagh said, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a couple of film scripts that are ready to go. I&#x27;m not going to do anything with them for a couple of years, until I&#x27;ve travelled and had some fun. But there&#x27;s one called &quot;Seven Psychopaths&quot;; if I do another film, that&#x27;ll be it. I hope you like it.&quot; The production of the film was confirmed in May 2011 and it was eventually released in North America on 12 October 2012. Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken, and Tom Waits star in the film.

McDonagh wrote and directed his drama-dark film &quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&quot; (2017), starring Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, and Sam Rockwell, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival on 4 September and won the People&#x27;s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival on 17 September 2017. &quot;Three Billboards&quot; won four awards at the 2017 Golden Globes, including Best Screenplay for McDonagh. McDonagh received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for the film.

==== 2020s ====
Production of McDonagh&#x27;s next film project was announced in 2020, titled &quot;The Banshees of Inisherin&quot;, with Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell in the lead roles. Production was delayed by COVID-19, with shooting ultimately beginning in August 2021 and wrapping on 23 October 2021. The movie held its world premiere at the 79th Venice International Film Festival on 5 September 2022 and had a limited theatrical release on 21 October 2022. McDonagh was awarded Best Original Screenplay at the 80th Golden Globe Awards, where the film also won Best Comedy/Musical. McDonagh received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay.

==Personal life==
McDonagh lives in East London. He holds both Irish and British citizenship and spent a major part of his childhood in County Galway. Since 2017, he has been in a relationship with the actress and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge. He is a vegetarian.

<text>The 5M model is a troubleshooting and risk-management model used for aviation safety.

==Original labels==
Based on T.P. Wright&#x27;s original work on the &quot;man-machine-environment&quot; triad at Cornell University, the 5M model incorporates a diagram of 3 interlocking circles and one all-encompassing circle. The smaller circles are labeled &quot;Man&quot;, &quot;Machine&quot;, and &quot;Medium&quot;; the intersecting space in the middle, where they all meet, is labeled &quot;Mission&quot;; while the larger circle is labeled &quot;Management&quot;:

* Man (people): including the physiology and psychology of those involved, as well as their performance and proficiency. 
* Machine (equipment): including the design, manufacture, maintenance, reliability, performance, etc. 
* Medium / measurement (environment, inspection): including weather, terrain, obstructions, lighting, etc. 
* Mission (purpose): the reason these three factors are brought together. 
* Management (leadership): the prevailing supervisory approach in terms of regulations, policies, procedures, and attitude involved in establishing, operating, maintaining, and decommissioning.
==Expansion==
These have been expanded by some to include an additional three, and are referred to as the 8 Ms:
*Material (includes raw material, consumables, and information)
*Method / mother nature (process, environment)
*Maintenance
==Other uses==
This is also used in more general troubleshooting or root-cause analysis, such as with the Ishikawa diagram.

<doc id="1040538" wikidata="Q7268434" url="?curid=1040538" title="Quadrun">
<text>Quadrun is a video game for the Atari 2600 developed by Steve Woita and published in 1983 by Atari, Inc. One of the four Atari Club games available exclusively via mail order, this title may have been available later in stores in very limited quantities. Only approximately 10,000 cartridges were initially made. &quot;Quadrun&quot; is the first Atari 2600 game with voice synthesis (&quot;Quadrun! Quadrun! Quadrun!&quot;); the only other is &quot;Open Sesame&quot;, made by Bit Corp.

==Gameplay==
The object of &quot;Quadrun&quot; is to destroy enemies (&quot;captors&quot;) and rescue friendly characters (&quot;runts&quot;) who are attempting to escape from the arena&#x27;s central building. The player character is invincible, but has only a limited supply of their weapon, an energy ball that destroys the enemies on contact.

The game is a series of waves of enemy characters. In a given wave, enemies appear one at a time in the vertical section of the arena. Enemies come in different shapes and attack with different patterns, although all the enemies in a single wave will be of the same type. Some captors proceed straight through the arena, while others split in half, zig-zag or reverse direction. The player must launch the energy ball at the enemy character, then switch to the other side of the arena in order to catch it again. If the player does not catch the ball on the other side, it is lost.

At random times during a wave, a runt will attempt to escape and run through the horizontal section of the arena. The player must move into that section and touch the runt before it collides with the ends of the arena, which are deadly to the touch. If the runt is not rescued, an energy meter at the top of the screen will shrink. It will shrink again if an enemy character is not destroyed during its pass through the arena. If the bar disappears, the game ends. The game also ends if the player loses all energy balls, either through failing to catch them or through a collision with an enemy character.

After the player completes five waves, the player faces a random attack wave where the enemies can be of any type at any time. Prior to the start of the random wave, the energy meter returns to full length and the player receives bonus points for their remaining stock of energy balls. Points are also scored for each enemy destroyed and each runt rescued.

==Development==
According to programmer Steve Woita, the game was playtested by a group of young girls who kept saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not like &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;.&quot; Based on this Atari decided to only produce 10,000 carts, assuming it would be a flop.

==Legacy==
&quot;Quadrun&quot; was part of the 2005 &quot;Atari Anthology&quot;, a collection of classic games for the then-current Xbox and PlayStation 2 consoles. It was also included on the plug-and-play Atari Flashback 2.

<doc id="1040550" wikidata="Q902110" url="?curid=1040550" title="Maclyn McCarty">
<text>Maclyn McCarty (June 9, 1911 – January 2, 2005) was an American geneticist, a research scientist described in 2005 as &quot;the last surviving member of a Manhattan scientific team that overturned medical dogma in the 1940s and became the first to demonstrate that genes were made of DNA.&quot; He had worked at Rockefeller University &quot;for more than 60 years.&quot; 1994 marked 50 years since this work&#x27;s release.

McCarty devoted his life as a physician-scientist to studying infectious disease organisms, and was best known for his part in the monumental discovery that DNA, rather than protein, constituted the chemical nature of a gene. Uncovering the molecular secret of the gene in question — that for the capsular polysaccharide of pneumococcal bacteria — led the way to studying heredity not only through genetics but also through chemistry. The team responsible for this feat is known as the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment. He died from congestive heart failure.

==Early life==
McCarty was born in South Bend, Indiana. He was the second of four sons; his father was a branch manager for the Studebaker Corporation while it was still a firm for horse-drawn carriages.

As an undergraduate at Stanford University, he began his studies in the nascent field of biochemistry, working with James Murray Luck on protein turnover in the liver. He &quot;graduated in 1933 from Stanford, where he majored in biochemistry&quot; and then &quot;went on to earn his medical degree at Johns Hopkins University in 1937.&quot; After four more years there and at New York University &quot;he moved to Rockefeller&quot; where he met his future research teammates.

==Early Rockefeller years==
MacLeod, over a number of years of research, had resolved several thorny technical issues, so that by the time McCarty arrived at the Rockefeller University, Avery&#x27;s team had paved the way for McCarty. Their progress over the next three years is described in McCarty&#x27;s memoir &quot;The Transforming Principle&quot;, written in the early 1980s.

McCarty&#x27;s arrival at Rockefeller University was also marked by another milestone, namely, the development of a reagent assay to positively correlate DNA with biological activity. In 1944 they published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine about their work.

Acceptance of the concept that &quot;genes are DNA&quot; was a slow process. Skepticism and being ignored, at least in the New York research institutions abounded. There were challenges associated with research, which made it especially difficult to attract other investigators to pursue it. Few people had the necessary expertise. One needed to use mice for corroboration. However, by 1953, influenced by the enormous impact of Watson and Crick&#x27;s bihelical structure of DNA, the majority of researchers had fully accepted the 1944 paper.

==Later career years==
A 1946 retirement resulted in McCarty being asked to head a specialized 1922-established laboratory. This lab was the scientific home of Rebecca Lancefield, who developed a major classification system. His work, combined with hers, made it clear that conditions affecting the joints and the heart resulted from infections several weeks earlier. The causal chain of events still eludes us. McCarty attacked this problem by studying both the biology and Rockefeller Hospital patients with acute rheumatic fever.

Together with his students and collaborators, over the next 20 years, McCarty&#x27;s work changed the understanding of the organism from a gram-positive streptococcus with a particular serological characteristic to one of the best characterized bacterial species. Work on bacterial cell-wall anatomy and chemistry was just beginning. His work led to the isolation of the streptococcal cell wall as a structural entity suitable for anatomic inspection by electronmicroscopy. Chemical dissection led to characterization of the group A–specific polysaccharide and the peptidoglycan, and the identification of its serological specificity in the terminal hexosamine. In order to prove this specificity, he first had to identify and purify a specific enzyme that cleaved hexosamine (a hexosaminidase) from a soil organism. Treating the polysaccharide with this enzyme abrogated its serological reactivity. McCarty further demonstrated the precise configuration of the hexosamine linkage by synthesizing both α- and β-N-acetyl-glucosamine ovalbumin and showing that only the second reacted with group A antisera. A similar analytical strategy indicated that the polysaccharide of group C streptococci differed by having a terminal β-N-acetyl galactosamine as the serological determinant.

In parallel, McCarty studied patients with rheumatic fever admitted to the Rockefeller Hospital as well as valuable specimen collections from military outbreaks of the disease during World War II. He and his collaborators found that antibody responses to several streptococcal antigens were significantly higher in the group of individuals that developed acute rheumatic fever than in individuals with uncomplicated infection. However, the response to unrelated antigens, for instance, diphtheria toxoid, was not enhanced. He found that group A streptococci secreted unusually high amounts of DNase, and established a test for the detection of antibodies produced in response to this antigen. This led to the discovery that streptococci were able to produce multiple isozymes of DNase. He purified human C-reactive protein through crystallization, produced a highly specific antiserum, and, using this much simpler and more sensitive test, found that C-reactive protein levels responded more rapidly and reliably than other inflammatory markers and could serve as the most accurate indicator of rheumatic inflammatory activity. Measuring C-reactive protein levels to detect inflammation is routine now in medical practice.

In his later years, McCarty increasingly served as a statesman of the biomedical sciences. He served for 14 years as the physician-in-chief of the Rockefeller University Hospital, and as a trusted adviser and the vice president of the Rockefeller University. Outside the university, his leadership was sought by the New York City Health Research Council, the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation, the Institute of Medicine (as a charter member), and numerous university visiting boards. For more than 40 years, as editor, he placed his stamp of excellence and integrity on the Journal of Experimental Medicine. He was a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

==Personal life==
McCarty&#x27;s scientific interests and energy had a counterpart in his rich personal life. Along with his second wife, Marjorie, McCarty had a wide circle of very close friends, both in the United States and abroad, who cherished his personal warmth, his low key, spare, and pragmatic character, his wit, and his wide-ranging intellect. He loved English literature, theater, and symphonies. He loved to wander the streets and the museums of the great cities of the world, particularly, Paris, New York, and London, and frequently visited overseas following his retirement. Moreover, he remained close to his family; the four brothers, living in different parts of the country, never failed to meet for annual reunions.

She was chairperson of the Finnish Left Alliance 1998–2006 and was a member of the Finnish Parliament (&quot;Eduskunta&quot;) from 1999 to 2007. She served as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and a delegate for Finland in the Nordic Council. In the two Cabinets of Paavo Lipponen (1995–2003), Siimes served as the Coordinate Minister for Culture (1998–1999) and as the Minister of Finance (1999–2003). From 1995 to 2000, she was a deputy member of the European Union Committee on Regional Development.

In March 2006 she resigned from the Left Alliance, stating she didn&#x27;t want to support the election of former taistoists like Jaakko Laakso to the Parliament of Finland in the next elections 2007 and that she could not continue in politics after she had not succeeded in making the Left Alliance what she termed a &quot;modern&quot; leftist political party with &quot;modern European attitudes&quot; and practices, such as working as a lobbyist for pharmaceutical companies.

In her book (Politiikan julkisivu) published after she left politics in March 2007, she tells in detail what made her to quit her very successful political career (in election 1999 over 16,000 personal votes and 2003 over 17,000 votes, a number that showed that she was one of the most popular politicians in Finnish political life 1999–2003)

In the 2009 European elections, Siimes endorsed Risto Penttilä, a National Coalition Party candidate.

Siimes is now working as Director General of Pharma Industry Finland.

She was appointed Chairman of the Board of Veikkaus (the Finnish National Lottery) on 16 March 2011.

Siimes has a licentiate (advanced degree) in economics.

<text>ESPN Zone was a theme restaurant and entertainment center chain in the United States that included arcades, TV studios, and radio studios, operated by the Disney Regional Entertainment subsidiary of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts using the Disney-owned ESPN brand. While the ESPN Zone name is no longer used, similar, the ESPN Grill at ESPN Wide World of Sports is located within the Walt Disney World complex in Bay Lake, Florida with counter service and light theming. ESPN Club at Disney&#x27;s BoardWalk Resort closed in 2022.

==Background==
In 1992, Art Levitt conceived of an ESPN/Disney project, while he was Disney Parks and Resorts vice president of resorts and special projects, to increase Disney&#x27;s Pleasure Island&#x27;s attractions. Levitt&#x27;s concept was &quot;to put an ESPN experience in Disney World&quot;. Despite discussions with ESPN, the project was not immediately given the green light. Levitt exited Disney for the CEO post at Hard Rock Cafe International. The ESPN Club sports bar, at Walt Disney World with 13,000 square feet of TV screens, was a modest attempt that came from those discussions, and drew enough attendance as a proof of concept. The restaurant opened on July 1, 1996, at the BoardWalk entertainment complex.

A similar project, Sports Center USA, led by Lynda O&#x27;Dea working with ABC Sports, attempted to get started in the early 1990s with its selected first location at Baltimore&#x27;s Power Plant. A lack of financing ended this project that was done in conjunction with Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.

==History==

With Disney&#x27;s purchase of Capital Cities/ABC in 1996, ESPN was a key part of the purchase, which Disney chair/CEO Michael Eisner then moved into additional brand extensions from biweekly sports magazine, ESPN-themed restaurants, video games to retail stores. With Levitt having the original idea in 1992, Eisner turned to him to head up Disney Regional Entertainment, the subsidiary that would start up and run the chain.

The concept was originally called ESPN Grill when announced in October 1997, with a slate of major city locations scheduled to start with Baltimore, Maryland, in mid-1998 and Chicago in spring 1999. ESPN Grill was renamed on December 29, 1997, to ESPN Zone to connote that there was more to the venue. The first ESPN Zone opened in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 11, 1998, in the Power Plant on the Inner Harbor.

The Chicago location opened on July 10, 1999, in the North Bridge development where DisneyQuest, a fellow Disney Regional chain, opened a month earlier. After the Chicago location opening, there was to be a new location every three months.

===Closures===

In 2009, Disney Regional Entertainment closed two ESPN Zone locations. A restaurant in Denver closed in June, and another in Atlanta closed in October of that year. The Atlanta location had opened in 2000, while the Denver location opened in 2001. In both cases, Disney Regional Entertainment cited the &quot;economic environment&quot; as the reason for the closures.

In June 2010, all but two locations were shuttered, with the remaining restaurants located in Southern California. As part of the decision by Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, through their Disney Regional Entertainment division, to no longer operate the restaurants in 2010, they sold the rights to operate the location in Anaheim to Zone Enterprises of Anaheim, another Disney subsidiary, and the L.A. Live location to Anschutz Entertainment Group, which owns the L.A. Live complex.

====Baltimore lawsuit====
Employees at the Baltimore ESPN Zone filed a class action lawsuit against Disney and its local subsidiary after the 2010 closing, claiming that Disney had violated the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988. U.S. federal district judge Catherine C. Blake, in a January 2013 decision, found that Disney and its local subsidiary violated the Act by failing to notify workers of the closing and underpaying them. Disney and the employees settled the lawsuit in November 2013; Disney paid approximately 70 percent of the employees&#x27; back pay.

====Final closures====
The Los Angeles location, housed in the ESPN West Coast headquarters building, closed in July 2013.

In October 2017, Disney announced plans to replace ESPN Zone and other Downtown Disney vendors at the Disneyland Resort with a resort hotel (which has since been canceled), in conjunction with the opening of Star Wars: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge in 2019. The restaurant closed on June 2, 2018.

==Features==
The prototype ESPN Zone was a two-level, 35,000 square foot complex with a stadium-like design which could hold 550 customers. People could dine at the bar or restaurant area. 200 TV screens were hung from the walls and ceilings. There were two special rooms, a screening room and a 10,000 square foot arena for actual and virtual game play.

ESPN Zone incorporated sports news into daily operations. Each shift, all staff were to receive daily sports news briefings. Placemats would be generated daily as a mini-sports page of a newspaper. The chain was to change its exclusive program, games, and memorabilia regularly.

===Broadcast facility===

All of the ESPN Zone restaurants were equipped to be remote ESPN broadcast locations, though only two were used to house regular series. The Anaheim ESPN Zone was the home of &quot;Unscripted with Chris Connelly&quot;, from 2001 to 2002. The ESPN Zone in New York City&#x27;s Times Square was used as the location of the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; halftime show for several years. The weekly series &quot;The Sports Reporters&quot; was broadcast from the Times Square location every Sunday morning from its opening until its closing, at which point the show moved to ESPN&#x27;s home base in Bristol, Connecticut.

Several of the locations also had radio studios, used by the local ESPN Radio affiliate and leased to other stations on occasion.

==Events==

ESPN Zone hosted the Ultimate Couch Potato Competition, a competitive sitting competition. In 2009, competitions were held in New York, Chicago and Baltimore. The Baltimore winner, Jessica Mosley, unofficially broke the Guinness World Record by sitting and watching consecutive sports for an unprecedented 70 hours, and 45 seconds. She repeated as Baltimore champion in 2010. The 2009 event received attention nationally, as well as from international outlets like the popular Australian television show &quot;Sunrise&quot;. Jeff Miller, the 2010 winner in Chicago, broke an ESPN Zone record and also unofficially broke the Guinness World Record by watching 72 hours of non-stop sports and his third win in the competition.

<doc id="1040555" wikidata="Q1540750" url="?curid=1040555" title="Garden fork">
<text>A garden fork, spading fork, or digging fork (in the past also an &quot;asparagus fork&quot;, the same name as a very different utensil) is a gardening implement, with a handle and a square-shouldered head featuring several (usually four) short, sturdy tines. It is used for loosening, lifting and turning over soil in gardening and farming, and not to be confused with the pitchfork, a similar tined tool used for moving (or throwing) loose materials such as hay, straw, silage, and manure.

A garden fork is used similarly to a spade in loosening and turning over soil. Its tines allow it to be pushed more easily into the ground, and it can rake out stones and weeds and break up clods, it is not so easily stopped by stones, and it does not cut through weed roots or root-crops. Garden forks were originally made of wood, but the majority are now made of forged carbon steel or stainless steel.

Reflecting their differing uses, garden forks have shorter, flatter, thicker, and more closely spaced tines than pitchforks. They have comparatively a fairly short, stout, usually wooden handle, typically with a D- or T-shaped grab at the end.

A smaller version of such forks with shorter, closer-spaced, thinner tines (but a full-sized handle) is known as a &quot;border fork&quot; or &quot;ladies&#x27; fork&quot;, and is used for lighter work, such as weeding amongst other plants. Forks with broader, flatter tines are made for lifting potatoes and other root crops from the ground. A pair of forks back-to-back may used to lever apart dense clumps of roots.

<text>Bad Education (, also meaning &#x27;bad manners&#x27;) is a 2004 Spanish drama film written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar. Starring Gael García Bernal, Fele Martínez, Daniel Giménez Cacho, Lluís Homar and Francisco Boira, the film focuses on two reunited childhood friends and lovers caught up in a stylized murder mystery. The metafictional film uses a deeply-nested narrative plot structure to explore themes of transsexuality, drug use, rape, and sexual abuse by Catholic priests. The film received an NC-17 rating in the United States for its depiction of homosexual sex.

The film was released on 19 March 2004 in Spain and 10 September 2004 in Mexico. It was also screened at many international film festivals such as Cannes, New York, Moscow and Toronto before its US release on 19 November 2004. The film received critical acclaim, and was seen as a return to Almodovar&#x27;s dark stage, placing it alongside films such as &quot;Matador&quot; (1986) and &quot;Law of Desire&quot; (1987).

==Plot==
In 1980 Madrid, struggling film director Enrique Goded is looking for his next project when he receives an unexpected visit from an actor looking for work. The actor claims to be Enrique&#x27;s boarding school friend and first love, Ignacio Rodriguez. Ignacio, who is now using the name Ángel Andrade, has brought along a short story titled &quot;The Visit&quot;, hoping that Enrique would be interested in filming it—and giving him the starring role. Enrique is intrigued since &quot;The Visit&quot; describes their time together at the Catholic boarding school, while also including a fictional account of their reunion years later as adults.

&quot;The Visit&quot; is set in 1977. It tells the story of a transgender drag queen with the stage name Zahara, whose birth name is Ignacio. Zahara plans to rob a drunken admirer but discovers that the man is her boyhood lover Enrique Serrano, so she defiles him in his sleep instead. The encounter stirs angry memories, and Zahara visits her old school to confront Father Manolo, who abused her there when she was a boy. She demands one million pesetas from Manolo in exchange for halting publication of her manuscript, also called &quot;The Visit&quot;.

That story is set in a Catholic boarding school for boys in 1964. At the school, Ignacio, a 10-year-old student with a beautiful boy soprano voice, is the object of lust of Father Manolo, the school principal and literature teacher. Ignacio falls in love with his classmate Enrique, and the two go the local cinema and grope each other. Manolo discovers them together that night and becomes enraged. Ignacio offers to submit to the priest&#x27;s molestation in exchange for having his friend not punished, but Manolo still expels Enrique anyway.

The director, Enrique Goded, wants to adapt the story but balks at Ángel&#x27;s condition that he be cast as Zahara, feeling that the Ignacio he loved and the Ángel of today are totally different people. He drives to see Ignacio&#x27;s mother in Ortigueira, Galicia and learns that in fact Ignacio has been dead for four years and that the man who came to his office is actually Ignacio&#x27;s younger brother, Juan. Enrique&#x27;s curiosity is piqued, so to &quot;see how far [Juan] would go&quot;—and without letting on what he knows—he casts Ángel/Juan in the role of Zahara. Ángel becomes Enrique&#x27;s sexual partner, and Enrique revises the script so that it ends with Father Manolo, whom Zahara was trying to blackmail to get money for sex reassignment surgery, having Zahara murdered. After the scene is shot, Ángel breaks out in tears unexpectedly.

The film set is visited by Manuel Berenguer, the real-life &quot;Father Manolo&quot;, who has resigned from the clergy. Berenguer confesses to Enrique that the new ending of the film is not far from the truth: Ignacio, a transsexual junkie, did blackmail him, but Berenguer managed to string her along—while mostly falling hard for Ignacio&#x27;s younger brother, Juan. Juan and Berenguer, over twice as old, became sexual partners and after a while realized they both wanted Ignacio dead. Juan obtained some pure heroin which Berenguer gave to Ignacio, causing her to die from overdose after shooting up. After the crime, the relationship disintegrated, with Berenguer wanting to continue, but Juan breaking off all contact.

Now years later, meeting once again on the film set, Ángel/Juan threatens to kill Berenguer if he continues to pursue him, but Berenguer replies that he will never let him go. His pretense revealed, Juan visits Enrique to apologize, but Enrique is uninterested in Juan&#x27;s weak excuses for murdering Ignacio. Before being turned away, Juan gives Enrique the letter addressed to him that Ignacio was in the middle of typing when he overdosed, reading &quot;I think I have succeeded...&quot;

An epilogue recounts that after the release of the film, Ángel and Enrique both achieved great success, although Ángel was relegated to television acting after &quot;his career suffered ups and downs&quot; in the 1990s. With Ángel now famous, Berenguer became the blackmailer, eventually leading Ángel to kill him in a hit-and-run.

==Cast==
==Production==
García Bernal was required to display a convincing Castilian Spanish accent before being cast.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Lynn Hirschberg stated that Garcia Bernal had a falling out with Almodovar over the film&#x27;s content, but Garcia Bernal denies this assertion. Garcia Bernal and Almodóvar had different ideas on the type of &#x27;inner transvestite&#x27; in terms of Bernal&#x27;s performance.

Almodóvar states that he worked on the screenplay for over 10 years.

==Release==
The film was theatrically released in Spain on 19 March 2004.
It opened in the 57th Cannes Film Festival in May 2004, the first Spanish film to do so.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened theatrically in the United States on 19 November 2004 in three venues, earning $147,370 in its opening weekend, ranking number 30 in the domestic box office. At the end of its North American theatrical run (its widest release being in 106 venues), the film had grossed $5,211,842 in the United States and Canada, and $35,062,088 overseas ($7,356,224 in its home country of Spain), making $40,273,930 worldwide.

===Critical response===
The film received critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 88% of 148 reviews were positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A layered, wonderfully-acted, and passionate drama.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has an 81 out of 100 rating, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Ann Hornaday from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;To watch &quot;Bad Education&quot; is to revel, along with Almodóvar, in the power of cinema to take us on journeys of breathtaking mystery and dimension and beauty.&quot; Marjorie Baumgarten from the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; wrote &quot;With &quot;Bad Education&quot;, the great Almodóvar delivers the finest movie of his career.&quot; Peter Travers from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote &quot;A rapturous masterwork.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four writing &quot;Pedro Almodovar&#x27;s new movie is like an ingenious toy that is a joy to behold, until you take it apart to see what makes it work, and then it never works again. While you&#x27;re watching it, you don&#x27;t realize how confused you are, because it either makes sense from moment to moment or, when it doesn&#x27;t, you&#x27;re distracted by the sex. Life is like that.&quot;

<text>The British Rail Class 159 is a class of British diesel multiple unit passenger trains of the Sprinter family, built in 1989–1992 by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL)&#x27;s Derby Litchurch Lane Works as Class 158. Before entering traffic, the original 22 units were modified at Rosyth Dockyard to Class 159 to operate services from London Waterloo to Salisbury and Exeter St Davids, replacing various locomotive-hauled passenger trains.

The units were originally branded by Network SouthEast as South Western Turbo.

==History and design==

In the late 1980s, the locomotive-hauled stock on Network SouthEast&#x27;s &quot;West of England&quot; route from London Waterloo to Salisbury, Yeovil Junction and Exeter St Davids was in urgent need of replacement. The Class 50 locomotives were not suited to the stop-start nature of the route, and frequently broke down. Because of the long sections of single track west of Salisbury following the Beeching cuts, a single breakdown could cause chaos. Various options were considered including electrification, shortened HSTs, construction of new locomotives and stock (a passenger version of the proposed Class 48), or the proposed Class 171 (which would have been part of the Networker family, an intercity version of the Class 165 – not to be confused with the later Turbostars). A study found the best options were electrification or new DMUs.

With the UK economy in decline in the early 1990s, it was found that Regional Railways had over-ordered Class 158s at the same time as Network SouthEast was looking for a similar number of new diesel trains. NSE agreed to take on the surplus Class 158s.

The original 22 units were built as Class 158 units, but were rebuilt by Babcock Rail in Rosyth Dockyard before entering traffic. This entailed fitting first-class accommodation and retention toilets, and various other modifications. The rebuild was required because it was not possible for Network SouthEast and the newly privatised BREL to agree terms on the variation order to NSE specification.

The first unit (159004) was handed over to NSE on 6 January 1993.

The units converted to Class 159 specification during construction are numbered 159001–159022, with individual vehicles numbered 52873–52894 and 57873–57894 for driving motor vehicles, and 58718–58739 for intermediate motor vehicles. The entire class is maintained at a purpose-built depot at Salisbury.

In 2007, eight further Class 159 units were created through the rebuilding of surplus Class 158 units displaced from TransPennine Express.

The units feature BSI couplers. This enables them to work in multiple not only with other units from the same class, but also and the classes of the Pacer and Sprinter families.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 4 January 2010, Class 142 diesel multiple unit 142029 collided with a train composed of two Class 159 units at . Nine people were injured.
*On 31 October 2021, South Western Railway Class 159 unit 159102 collided with a Great Western Railway Class 158 train at Fisherton tunnel in Salisbury. As a result of the damage caused following the incident, 2 carriages of 159102 (vehicles 57803 and 58703) have been written off with vehicle 52803 being retained as a spare.

==Operations==

The units were dedicated to the West of England sector of Network South East, operating services between London Waterloo and Exeter; they also worked services between Salisbury and Southampton and on the Reading to Basingstoke line, replacing elderly DEMUs. They then transferred to the South West Trains shadow franchise in readiness for privatisation.

Upon the privatisation of British Rail, the &quot;West of England&quot; route passed in 1996 to the South West Trains franchise, which was won by the Stagecoach Group. Starting in 2000, units were progressively refurbished and repainted from Network SouthEast&#x27;s blue, red and white livery into South West Trains&#x27; express livery. Other post-privatisation modifications included clearer LED destination displays, upgraded air-conditioning, and more openable windows.

Currently, the Class 159s operate mainly from London Waterloo to Salisbury/Exeter in formations of six, eight, or nine coaches (2 × Class 159, 2 × 159 plus 1 × 158, or 3 × 159 respectively) and between Salisbury and Exeter in three- or six-coach formations. Until the December 2009 timetable change, some trains continued beyond Exeter to Paignton, Plymouth and Penzance; these usually operated as three-coach units, though at weekends there were some six-coach formations. These services are now operated by the Great Western Railway. The service to Bristol Temple Meads is now also operated by Class 159s.

Since 2006, the original Class 159 fleet of 22 has been supplemented by eight three-coach 158s (renumbered into the 159/1 series) and 11 two-coach Class 158s. The decision to standardise on 158s and 159s allowed the nine Class 170 &#x27;Turbostar&#x27; units to be transferred to other operators. Eight went to First TransPennine Express, with the remaining unit going to Southern for integration into Class 171 Turbostars.

===Routes Served===
These trains serve the following routes:

*London Waterloo to Basingstoke, Salisbury and Exeter St Davids via Yeovil Junction
*London Waterloo &amp; Salisbury to Yeovil Pen Mill (Via Westbury or Yeovil Junction)

==Refurbishments and conversions==
=== Refurbishment of the Class 159/0===

==== 2000 ====
South West Trains began a refurbishment programme for its 22 Class 159/0s in 2000. The seats were re-trimmed and interiors repainted. The units were repainted into SWT livery.

==== 2008 ====
The units received another refurbishment in 2008 at Wabtec Doncaster. CCTV and PIS (Passenger Information Systems) were installed, new seating was installed in first class and at the same time the units received a modified version of the SWT express livery (with orange doors as opposed to the red doors on Class 444 units) for compliance with disabled access regulations.

===Class 158 conversions===

Eight of TransPennine&#x27;s surplus three-coach Class 158 units were refurbished to match SWT&#x27;s existing Class 159 units at Wabtec Doncaster, and renumbered into Class 159 subclass /1. The first updated units were delivered to South West Trains in November 2006, and by May 2007 all of the new subclass were in service.

The refurbishment included making the first-class accommodation area larger and completely refitting it, brighter interior lighting with new diffusers and the plating-over of the disused toilet in the MSO vehicle. The Class 159/1s have been fitted with retention toilets. Additional alterations include the installation of a Passenger information system (PIS) and CCTV as is fitted on the 159/0s.

The converted units however retained their original Cummins NTA855-R1 engines, which produce less power than the R3 variants fitted to the Class 159/0 fleet.

==Fleet details==
===Named units===
Some units have received names:
*159001 &quot;City of Exeter&quot;
*159002 &quot;City of Salisbury&quot;
*159003 &quot;Templecombe&quot;
*159004 &quot;Basingstoke &amp; Deane&quot;

<doc id="1040586" wikidata="Q4905973" url="?curid=1040586" title="Big Lots">
<text>Big Lots Stores, Inc. (stylized as Big Lots!) is an American discount retail chain, specializing in the sale of closeout and overstock merchandise. Founded in 1967 as Consolidated Stores, the chain is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, and includes over 900 locations across the United States. 

Big Lots filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2024, and later in December, the chain announced that it would cease operations, liquidate, and close all remaining stores. Liquidation sales began in December 2024, and all stores were expected to close in 2025. On December 28, 2024, Big Lots reached an agreement with Gordon Brothers Retail Partners to transfer 200–400 stores and one or two distribution centers to Variety Wholesalers, with the remaining stores to be permanently closed.

==History==
The Big Lots chain traces its history to 1967 when Consolidated Stores Corporation was formed in Ohio by Sol Shenk. In 1982, Consolidated Stores Corp. opened its first closeout store, called Odd Lots, in Columbus, Ohio. In 1983, drug store chain Revco bought New Jersey closeout retailer Odd Lot Trading Co. As Consolidated&#x27;s Odd Lots stores expanded Revco was unhappy it that had a similar name as a subsidiary owned by Revco. Consolidated Stores Corp. agreed to limit its use of the Odd Lots name to stores located within a certain radius of Columbus. Beyond that radius, Consolidated began opening stores under the Big &amp; Small Lots name. Eventually, all Odd Lots stores were rebranded as Big Lots.

Consolidated Stores Corp. was an investor in the DeLorean Motor Company, which declared bankruptcy in 1982. Consolidated took possession of approximately 100 DeLorean models, then still at the factory in Dunmurry southwest of Belfast, Northern Ireland when the U.S. importer was unable to import them. The unusual excess inventory acquisition is commemorated on Big Lots website&#x27;s &quot;Closeout Museum&quot; page. In 1985, Consolidated Stores Corp. began trading as a separate public company on the American Stock Exchange. In 1986, Consolidated Stores Corp. switched to the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol CNS.

In 1994, Consolidated Stores Corp. acquired Toy Liquidators, adding 82 stores in 38 states. Looking to expand further into the toy business, Consolidated Stores Corp. purchased KB Toys from Melville Corporation in 1996. Shortly afterward, Melville purchased Revco and folded it into the CVS Pharmacy chain on its way to becoming CVS Health, making the &quot;Odd Lots&quot; dispute moot. In 1998, Big Lots Inc. bought &#x27;MacFrugals&#x27; (Pic &#x27;N&#x27; Save) stores for $995 million in stock, converting them to the Big Lots brand.

In 2000, Consolidated Stores Corp. sold the KB Toys and Toy Liquidators lines to Bain Capital. A year later, Consolidated Stores Corp. changed its name to &quot;Big Lots, Inc.&quot; and its ticker symbol from CNS to BLI. In the later part of 2005, Big Lots closed 170 stores, including all free-standing &quot;Big Lots Furniture&quot; specialty stores. On August 3, 2006, Big Lots announced that it would change its New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol from BLI to BIG, beginning with trading activity on August 18, 2006.

In October 2023, CreditRiskMonitor reported that Big Lots was nearing a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The company closed 52 stores in 2023. In July 2024, Big Lots announced the closure of 35 to 40 underperforming locations nationwide, blaming inflation and high rising costs as part of the decision. The company warned that it might not be able to survive the rest of 2024 and that a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing might be imminent; in the first quarter of 2024, net sales decreased 10.2% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Of the company&#x27;s 1,400 stores nationwide, 144 stores were confirmed to be closing that month including one in Rapid City, South Dakota, the only one in the state. In a filing on July 31, 2024, Big Lots reported that it would close up to 315 stores.

On August 28, 2024, Big Lots warned that they could file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection within the coming weeks, blaming declining sales caused by rising interest rates as part of the decision. The company is searching for options to avoid a potential filing. The company&#x27;s stock sank 27% after the announcement. On September 9, 2024, Big Lots filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, with plans to sell itself to Nexus Capital Management.

On December 19, 2024, Big Lots announced that it did not anticipate closing the sale to Nexus, and that the company would go out of business and close all of its 963 remaining stores. CEO Bruce Thorn said the company would continue &quot;efforts to secure an alternative deal with Nexus or another party&quot;. On December 27, Big Lots reached an agreement with Gordon Brothers to transfer the operation of up to 400 stores and two distribution centres to Variety Wholesalers, who will retain the Big Lots name.

==Big Lots Wholesale==
Big Lots operated a wholesale division which provided merchandise in bulk. It closed its wholesale division at the end of the 2013 fiscal year. The retailer had conducted wholesale operations through Big Lots Wholesale, Consolidated International&quot;,&quot; and Wisconsin Toy for more than 34 years.

==Big Lots Canada==

On July 19, 2011, Big Lots announced that it had purchased Liquidation World Inc., a Canadian closeout retailer with 89 locations for $20 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. This is Big Lots&#x27; first retail venture outside of the US. The first Big Lots location in Canada opened in April 2013 in Orillia, Ontario followed by Burlington, Niagara Falls, St. Catharines, and Thunder Bay (all in Ontario as well). Big Lots exited the Canadian marketplace in 2014, citing poor sales.

<text>The North American F-107 is North American Aviation&#x27;s entry in a United States Air Force tactical fighter-bomber design competition of the 1950s, based on the F-100 Super Sabre. It incorporated many innovations and radical design features, notably the over-fuselage air intakes. The competition was eventually won by the Republic F-105 Thunderchief, and two of the three F-107 prototypes ended their lives as test aircraft. One is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force and a second at Pima Air and Space Museum.

==Design and development==
In June 1953, North American initiated an in-house study of advanced F-100 designs, leading to proposed interceptor (NAA 211: F-100BI denoting &quot;interceptor&quot;) and fighter-bomber (NAA 212: F-100B) variants. Concentrating on the F-100B, the preliminary engineering and design work focused on a tactical fighter-bomber configuration, featuring a recessed weapons bay under the fuselage and provision for six hardpoints underneath the wings. Single-point refueling capability was provided while a retractable tailskid was installed. An all-moving vertical fin and an automated flight control system were incorporated which permitted the aircraft to roll at supersonic speeds using spoilers. The flight control system was upgraded by the addition of pitch and yaw dampers.

The aircraft&#x27;s most distinguishing feature is its dorsal-mounted variable-area inlet duct (VAID). While the VAID was at the time a system unique to the F-107A, it is now considered to be an early form of variable geometry intake ramp which automatically controlled the amount of air fed to the jet engine. Although the preliminary design of the air intake was originally located in a chin position under the fuselage like the Vought F-8 Crusader, the air intake was eventually mounted in an unconventional position directly above and just behind the cockpit. The VAID system proved to be very efficient and NAA used the design concept on their A-5 Vigilante, XB-70 Valkyrie and XF-108 Rapier designs.

The air intake was in the unusual dorsal location as the Air Force had required the carriage of an underbelly semi-conformal nuclear weapon. The intake also severely limited rear visibility. Nonetheless, this was not considered very important for a tactical fighter-bomber aircraft at that time, and furthermore it was assumed that air combat would be via guided missile exchanges outside visual range.

In an emergency, the ejection seat was designed to blast directly through the non-jettisoning canopy and bring the pilot swiftly clear of the air intakes. In non-emergency operation, the canopy opened by sliding vertically upwards via guide mechanism, rather than the typical arrangement of a hinged or horizontally sliding canopy.

A two-seat version of the F-107 was proposed by North American, which seated both crewmembers under a single canopy in an extended forward fuselage, but none were built.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins/Landis p. 178&quot;&gt;Jenkins/Landis 1975, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1954, a contract was signed for three prototypes along with a pre-production order for six additional airframes.

In the end however, the United States Air Force decided to purchase the Republic F-105 Thunderchief after heavy consideration for the F-107 program.

===Designation and names===
Extensive design changes resulted in its redesignation from F-100B to F-107A before the first prototype flew. The F-107 was never given an official name, but was sometimes informally called the &quot;Super Super Sabre&quot; referring to North American&#x27;s earlier fighter design, the F-100 Super Sabre. The designation &quot;F-107A&quot; was the only one assigned to the aircraft, though &quot;YF-107A&quot; is often used in publications. The aircraft is also informally called the &quot;Ultra Sabre&quot;.

==Operational history==
The first F-107A (serial number &quot;55-5118&quot;) with North American&#x27;s chief test pilot Bob Baker at the controls, made its initial flight on 10 September 1956, attaining Mach 1.03. After the successful test flight, the brakechute did not deploy, which resulted in a &quot;hot&quot; landing with the nose gear strut breaking. The aircraft first achieved Mach 2 in tests on 3 November 1956.

It was joined by the second F-107A (&quot;55-5119&quot;), which made its first flight on 28 November 1956. It was used for weapons testing with both conventional and atomic bombs. The last prototype, (&quot;55-5120&quot;) had its maiden flight on 10 December 1956. At the conclusion of the F-107A&#x27;s successful test program, the Tactical Air Command decided to hold a fly-off competition between the F-107A and the Republic F-105 which was designed to same mission requirements and used the same engine. Although the competition was close, the F-105 was selected as the new standard TAC tactical fighter. The three F-107A prototypes were relegated to test flying and the pre-production order was cancelled.

In late 1957, prototypes #1 (&quot;55-5118&quot;) and #3 (&quot;55-5120&quot;) were leased to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) for high-speed flight research. Aircraft #1 is now in the collection of the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum. In September 1959, with Scott Crossfield at the controls, aircraft #3 was damaged during an aborted takeoff. The aircraft was not repaired and, ultimately, used for fire fighting training and was destroyed in the early 1960s. (55-5120 was also noted to be stored in poor condition in the Tallmantz collection at Orange County Airport California in September 1970.)

Prototype #2 (&quot;55-5119&quot;) was not used by NACA and flown on 25 November 1957 to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio.

<text>Stagecoach Group is a transport group based in Perth, Scotland. It operates buses and express coaches in the United Kingdom.

Stagecoach was originally founded in 1976 as &quot;Gloagtrotter&quot;, a recreational vehicle and minibus hire business. During the early 1980s, it took advantage of the deregulation of the British express coach market, launching services from Dundee to London using second-hand Neoplan coaches, competing against the then state-owned National Express Coaches and Scottish Citylink. Stagecoach purchased several recently-privatised national bus groups from London Regional Transport, the National Bus Company, Scottish Bus Group and various city councils, as well as pursuing those that had opted for management buyouts and employee-owned corporations. During August 1996, Stagecoach acquired roughly one-third of all passenger rolling stock in the UK via the acquisition of the recently-privatised leasing company Porterbrook; it sold the company on four years later. In 1997, Stagecoach was awarded the franchise to operate the recently privatised Sheffield Supertram system. In 1998, it purchased Prestwick Airport.

Following the sale of its London bus operations to Macquarie Bank in 2006, Stagecoach UK Bus concentrated on the bus market outside the UK capital. During 2007, Stagecoach was awarded the East Midlands franchise. In July 2007, it commenced operating the Manchester Metrolink tram network. During January 2009, Stagecoach purchased Preston Bus, a former rival in the Lancashire area, but was promptly compelled to sell it by the Competition Commission. In October 2010, it expanded further by re-acquiring East London and Selkent, Stagecoach&#x27;s former London bus operations. During March 2015, Virgin Trains East Coast, in which Stagecoach held a 90% shareholding, commenced operating the InterCity East Coast franchise; the franchise was terminated early three years later as it was unable to fulfil the agreed payments.

During April 2019, private equity house Variant acquired Stagecoach&#x27;s US division in exchange for $271 million. In April 2019, Stagecoach was disqualified from participating in three rail franchise competitions by the Department for Transport after it submitted non-compliant bids. During September 2021, it was reported that rival company National Express entered into talks to acquire Stagecoach. In May 2022, a rival takeover offer from a DWS managed investment fund bought Stagecoach.

==History==
===Background and early years===

The origins of Stagecoach Group can be traced back to 1976, at which point Ann Gloag and her husband Robin Gloag established a small recreational vehicle and minibus hire business called &quot;Gloagtrotter&quot; based in Perth, Scotland. Ann&#x27;s brother, Brian Souter, an accountant, joined the firm and expanded the business into bus hire. In 1982, following the collapse of his marriage to Ann, Robin Gloag sold his ownership stake in the business and ceased any involvement. Around this time, the company would benefit greatly from the deregulation of the British express coach market in the early 1980s; specifically, the Transport Act 1980, which freed express services of 35 miles and over from regulation by the Traffic Commissioner, brought new opportunities for the company and services were launched from Dundee to London using second-hand Neoplan coaches. For a while, the company offered a very personal service with Brian Souter doing the driving and Ann Gloag preparing sandwiches and other snacks for the passengers.

Between 1981 and 1985, the company grew significantly, successfully competing against the then state-owned National Express Coaches and Scottish Citylink. Stagecoach entered local bus operation with the acquisition of McLennan of Spittalfield, near Perth. Its early success allowed Stagecoach to take advantage of the privatisation of the national bus groups. Several firms were purchased from London Regional Transport, the National Bus Company, Scottish Bus Group and various city councils. The company consolidated its operations during the 1990s by purchasing ex NBC and SBG bus companies that had been purchased via management buyouts and employee-owned corporations when privatised. In 1988, Stagecoach withdrew from the long-distance express coach market, selling its operations to National Express.

===1990s===
During the privatisation of British Rail, Porterbrook was formed as one of three rolling stock companies owning around a third of passenger railway locomotives, multiple units and coaching stock running on Network Rail&#x27;s system which is leased to various train operators. Porterbrook was privatised via a management buyout before being purchased by Stagecoach for £825 million during August 1996. The acquisition garnered some public controversy and political criticism for the low value returned to the taxpayer. In April 2000, Stagecoach sold Porterbrook to the British banking group Abbey National in exchange for £1.44 billion.

In 1997, Stagecoach was awarded the franchise to operate the recently privatised Sheffield Supertram system, from the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive, who owned the system. Stagecoach bought the remaining 27 years of a 30-year franchise in exchange for £1.15 million, which was substantially below the anticipated £80 million that the councils had hoped to raise to help pay off the accumulated debts to build the system. The franchise, which expired in March 2024, was operated under the Stagecoach Supertram brand, the company having responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the tram system. When Stagecoach took over the system, it was struggling, both financially and in terms of attracting passengers; patronage subsequently rose from 7.8 million recorded passenger journeys in 1996/97, to 15.0 million during 2011/12.

In 1998, Stagecoach diversified into another transport sector via the purchase of Scotland&#x27;s Prestwick Airport in exchange for £41 million. By the summer of 1999, the company was rumoured to have been offered some £80 million for Prestwick. In January 2001, Stagechoach opted to sell the airport for £33 million to concentrate on surface transport.

===2000s===

In late 2000, Stagecoach UK&#x27;s bus operations were rationalised into twelve subsidiary companies managed from the group&#x27;s Perth headquarters. The group was also rebranded in December 2000, with a new &#x27;beachball&#x27; logo designed by Edinburgh design house McKinstrie Wilde Millhouse and a new fleet livery designed by Ray Stenning&#x27;s Best Impressions design company for the group&#x27;s buses. The new livery for regional operations consisted of &#x27;swoops&#x27; on a grey base that retained the previous livery&#x27;s red, orange, blue and white colours, while Stagecoach London buses maintained base red with blue and orange &#x27;swoops&#x27; to the rear of the bus. A blue-based standard interior for new buses was also introduced, with the first UK buses featuring the group&#x27;s new identity entering service in January 2001.

On 21 November 2005, Stagecoach announced the sale of its New Zealand operations to Infratil. On 14 December 2005, Stagecoach purchased Barnsley based Traction Group (Yorkshire Traction) for £26 million, and also assume Traction&#x27;s £11 million debt. Traction operated 840 buses in South and West Yorkshire (Yorkshire Traction, Barnsley &amp; District, Yorkshire Terrier), Lincolnshire (RoadCar) and Angus (Strathtay Scottish). Traction was the largest remaining privately owned independent bus operator in the UK.

Following the sale of its London bus operations to Macquarie Bank in 2006, Stagecoach UK Bus concentrated on the bus market outside the UK capital, focusing on organic growth and exploring acquisition options. In September 2005, following competition with its Megabus coach operation, Stagecoach launched a joint venture with Scottish Citylink coaches. During October 2006, a competition enquiry instructed Stagecoach to sell some of its Scottish coach services. Stagecoach was also active in the passenger rail market, having a 49% stake in Virgin Rail Group. During 2007, the group were successful in their bid for the new East Midlands franchise, which had been created by amalgamating the previous Midland Mainline franchise with the eastern part of the former Central Trains franchise.
During July 2007, Stagecoach commenced operating the Manchester Metrolink tram network. In January 2009, Stagecoach purchased Preston Bus, a former rival in the Lancashire area. In November 2009, the Competition Commission intervened, ordering Stagecoach to sell Preston Bus after it had adversely affected competition in the area.

===2010s===
In October 2010, Stagecoach expanded further by re-acquiring East London and Selkent, Stagecoach&#x27;s former London bus operations. During August 2011, Stagecoach sold its Manchester Metrolink concession to RATP Group halfway through its ten-year contract to operate the network. In December 2013, Stagecoach bought King&#x27;s Lynn based Norfolk Green. During March 2015, Virgin Trains East Coast, in which Stagecoach held a 90% shareholding, commenced operating the InterCity East Coast franchise. The East Coast franchise was terminated on 23 June 2018 after it was revealed that Stagecoach had overbid and were thus unable to make the agreed franchise payments.

During December 2018, it was announced that private equity house Variant would acquire Stagecoach Group&#x27;s US division in exchange for $271 million; the sale was completed in April 2019.

In April 2019, Stagecoach was disqualified from participating in three rail franchise competitions by the Department for Transport after it submitted non-compliant bids for the East Midlands, South Eastern and West Coast Partnership franchises. One month later, the company announced that it would legally challenge the disqualification.

===2020s===

The group rebranded again in February 2020, with a new set of liveries introduced for the group&#x27;s British bus operations. Three colour schemes were to be used to reduce customer confusion:
* Local services- white with azure blue
* Longer distance - amber yellow
* Specialist services - white with ocean green (this includes park and ride, university and tourist services)

During September 2021, it was reported that rival company National Express entered into talks to acquire Stagecoach Group. In December 2021, a deal was agreed between the boards of the two companies: however, it was subject to both shareholder approval and regulatory scrutiny. To satisfy the Competition &amp; Markets Authority, Stagecoach had planned to sell Megabus, its 35% shareholding in Scottish Citylink and the Falcon Coaches part of Stagecoach South West to ComfortDelGro. Having originally recommended shareholders accept the National Express offer, in March 2022 the board of directors withdrew the recommendation in favour of a takeover offer from a DWS managed investment fund. Following this, Stagecoach instead sold Megabus and Falcon Coaches to Scottish Citylink and increased its shareholding in the joint venture to 37.5% in return. 

In June 2022, Stagecoach purchased London bus operator Tower Transit&#x27;s Lea Interchange garage, with Stagecoach London taking on 150 buses and 11 Transport for London bus route contracts; operations from Lea Interchange are managed under the Lea Interchange Bus Company Limited license. Later in August, Stagecoach acquired the London operations of the HCT Group after the company had fallen into administration, with Stagecoach acquiring a further 160 buses, 17 TfL route contracts and two bus garages from the acquisition.

==Operations==

==Former operations==

===East Midlands Trains===
Stagecoach commenced operating the new East Midlands Trains franchise in November 2007 that took over all of Midland Mainline&#x27;s and some of Central Trains services. During August 2019, it ceased operating when the franchise was taken over by Abellio East Midlands Railway.

===Manchester Metrolink===
In July 2007, Stagecoach took over the operation of Manchester Metrolink on a 10-year fixed-term management contract, beating competition from Keolis, Serco and Transdev, to make it the biggest tram operator in the UK. This system was the first modern tram system in the United Kingdom, opening just before the Sheffield system in 1992. Nearly 18 million people ride on the system a year. Stagecoach sold the Metrolink business to RATP Group in August 2011.

===Sheffield Supertram===

Stagecoach operated the Sheffield Supertram under a concession from the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive between 1997 and 2024. Its average daily ridership is 33,700, equalling more than 12 million per year, well above expectations. At the time of the concession&#x27;s expiry, there were three light rail transit lines and a later tram-train service to Rotherham. Future plans included schemes to Dore, Fulwood and Maltby; following consultations, a reduced scheme with an extension to Broomhill was being considered as of 2017. The concession expired in March 2024, with the operation of Supertram returning to the public sector.

===South West Trains===
Stagecoach ran the South West Trains franchise from February 1996 to August 2017. It retained the franchise for three years from February 2004 and for a further 10 years from February 2007. The franchise passed to First MTR South Western Railway on 20 August 2017
*Island Line Trains – The rail system on the Isle of Wight, was also operated by Stagecoach from October 1996 to August 2017. In February 2007 it was merged into the South Western franchise.

===Stagecoach Rail===
In 1992, shortly before the privatisation of British Rail, Stagecoach Rail briefly operated a modest InterCity operation between Aberdeen and London. Two British Railways Mark 2 passenger carriages were re-branded in Stagecoach colours and attached to a scheduled British Rail InterCity sleeper service.

===Virgin CrossCountry===

Virgin Rail Group operated the CrossCountry franchise as Virgin CrossCountry from January 1997 until November 2007 when it passed to Arriva.

===Virgin Trains East Coast===

Virgin Trains East Coast, in which Stagecoach held a 90% shareholding, operated the InterCity East Coast franchise from March 2015 to June 2018.

===Virgin Trains West Coast===
The group has held a 49% stake in Virgin Rail Group since October 1998. Virgin Rail Group operated the InterCity West Coast franchise as Virgin Trains West Coast from March 1997 until December 2019.

===Australia===
In 1999, Stagecoach purchased the school bus operations of Sunbus in the Cairns, Ipswich and Sunshine Coast regions of Queensland. These were sold in 2002 to:
* Cairns: Love&#x27;s Bus Service
* Ipswich: Pulitano Group
* Sunshine Coast: Buslink Queensland

===Hong Kong===

In 1994, Stagecoach created a bus-operating subsidiary in Hong Kong which operated residential bus services. It ceased operation in April 1996.

During 1999, Stagecoach planned to become the largest bus company in China through joint ventures, equity stakes and partnerships, and confirmed the £181 million acquisition of Hong Kong&#x27;s Citybus. Stagecoach acquired control of Citybus Group, which provided franchised bus services on Hong Kong Island and to and from Hong Kong International Airport as well as non-franchised services throughout Hong Kong, in March 1999 and then completed the privatisation of Citybus on 17 July 1999.

In June 2003, the operation was sold to Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, the parent company of the major rival operator New World First Bus.

===Kenya===
In November 1991, Stagecoach Holdings (as it was named then), bought United Transport&#x27;s shareholding in Kenya Bus Services. During its tenure, Stagecoach rapidly expanded the fleet, introducing the Express Services and the modern double decker buses back on Kenyan roads. During October 1998 a consortium of investors led by Karanja Kabage as chairman acquired Kenya Bus Services from Stagecoach Holdings which owned 95% of the business.

===New Zealand===

Stagecoach New Zealand was a wholly owned part of the Stagecoach Group, which provided bus services in Auckland, Wellington and the Hutt Valley and nine ferry routes in Auckland. It was the largest bus company in New Zealand when sold. Stagecoach NZ started operations when the firm acquired Wellington City Transport, including the Hutt Valley suburban bus operations of the New Zealand Railways Road Services, branded &quot;CityLine&quot;, in the 1990s. Following this initial acquisition Stagecoach also purchased Eastbourne Buses, The Yellow Bus Company in Auckland and a controlling interest in Fullers Auckland. In November 2005, the business was sold to Infratil and rebranded as NZ Bus.

===North America===
Stagecoach carried out bus operations in the northeastern and midwestern United States and in eastern Canada. Businesses were focused on commuter services, and included tour and charter, sightseeing, local, and school bus operations:
*Coach USA – operating primarily in the northeastern United States providing subsidised transit services (primarily in Greater New York), sightseeing, and charter services, and in the midwestern United States with primarily charter and sightseeing services. Yellow school bus services are also provided by Coach USA in the state of Wisconsin.
*Megabus – discount express bus services radiating from Chicago and New York City. Like Megabus in the United Kingdom, most stops are made at street locations.
*Coach Canada – serving primarily Ontario and Quebec, where it operates interurban and chartered bus services, contract bus services in Durham, yellow school bus service in Durham Region and Peterborough County in Ontario, and sightseeing services in Montreal.

In December 2018, Stagecoach announced it had agreed to sell all of its North American operations to Variant Equity Advisors with the deal concluded in April 2019.

===Portugal===
Stagecoach Portugal had its origins in the re-privatisation of Portuguese bus and coach operation, which had been nationalised after the 1974 Revolution. In 1990, the nationalised Rodoviária Nacional was split into ten components. In the capital, Lisbon, Rodoviária de Lisboa was the chief operator outside the city itself, where Carris provided city bus and tram services. The name of Rodoviária de Lisboa survived as part of the Barraqueiro bus company, but another part, serving the area to the west of Lisbon, became Stagecoach Portugal in 1995. A further portion still operates as Vimeca – Viação Mecânica de Carnaxide. During June 2001, Stagecoach announced the sale of their Portuguese operations to ScottURB for £14 million.

===Nordic countries===
In October 1996, during Stagecoach&#x27;s International buying spree, it made its most important international acquisition at the time, buying Swebus AB, the bus-company arm of the Swedish State Railways (SJ), for 1.2 billion kronor ($164 million), which also included operations in Denmark, Finland and Norway. The operations in Norway included only city and regional traffic in three minor cities around lake Mjøsa, but several unsuccessful bids on operators in the Oslo area led to Stagecoach selling out to Norgesbuss during April 1997. The Danish operations never proved profitable, and were sold to Combus in autumn of 1997. The operations in Finland were more successful, and were in April 1998 renamed Stagecoach Finland. In spring of 1997, Swebus Express was started as an intercity coach service between several cities in southern parts of Sweden, sporting the Stagecoach livery of the time. Stagecoach in 1998 announced that it had bid for several rail franchises in Sweden. On 27 October 1999, Stagecoach revealed that it was going to sell Swebus to Concordia Bus for £100 million, to refocus its bus operation on the United States and Asia.

==No-frills brands==
Stagecoach operate a number of so-called &quot;no-frills&quot; services across the United Kingdom and the United States. Applying the business model of the low-cost carrier air lines, these services aim to offer cheaper alternatives to the established operators in the bus, coach and rail markets, by reducing costs, and offering extremely low fares for the earliest bookings, rising nearer the journey time:

===Magic Bus===
Magic Bus was the first no-frills brand of Stagecoach. It was first used in red lettering on ex London Regional Transport AEC Routemasters, otherwise painted in Stagecoach stripes, in competition in Glasgow. Later, an allover blue with yellow lettering was adopted, on older service buses with simple fares and no travel passes, usually operated on routes with strong competition from other operators, most notably on the Manchester Piccadilly to East Didsbury Wilmslow Road bus corridor route in Manchester, but also in Newcastle upon Tyne and East Scotland (as Magic Mini). In 2008 Stagecoach Merseyside introduced a Magic Bus service competing with themselves and Arriva North West on the busy route 14 corridor, Magic Bus 14C runs every 7/8 minutes between City Centre and Broadway. By 2012, only the Manchester Magic Bus remained, these being upgraded from Volvo Olympians and Dennis Dragons to Alexander ALX400 and East Lancs bodied Dennis Trident 2s.

===Megabus===
Megabus is a low cost, &quot;no-frills&quot; intercity coach service launched in the United Kingdom by Stagecoach in 2003, on 10 April 2006 in the United States, and in 2009 within Canada. Its main rival in the UK is National Express, who have had to lower their prices to compete with Megabus. In the US, Megabus/Eastern Shuttle&#x27;s main rival is BoltBus, which is 50% owned by Stagecoach rival FirstGroup. In the UK, the Megabus network covers most of the island of Great Britain, although some routes offer only one journey per day. Originally operated using high capacity, but older coach-seated vehicles, most services are now operated with new modern single or double deck coaches. In the United States, services radiate from Chicago and New York City, but the networks are not connected. In both the UK and the US, to cut costs, most services use on-street bus stops, rather than pay for access to coach stations (except in cases where pre-existing routes were converted to Megabus lines). A notable exception to this is the use of London Victoria Coach Station.

===Megatrain===

On 14 November 2005, the Megabus concept was extended to certain rail services, with the introduction of Megatrain between London and Southampton, and London and Portsmouth, using a dedicated carriage on selected South West Trains services. It was later extended to some Virgin Trains services (since withdrawn) and to selected East Midlands Trains services. In 2009, the Megabusplus concept was introduced, under which certain trips are begun on a train and are then completed on a bus. Unlike the original Megatrain concept, this service is available seven days a week.

==Scottish Citylink==
In September 2005, Stagecoach and ComfortDelGro announced a joint venture in the provision of express coach services in Scotland, ending intense competition between ComfortDelGro&#x27;s subsidiary Scottish Citylink and Stagecoach subsidiaries Megabus and Motorvator. Under the terms of the joint venture, the Stagecoach Group acquires a 35% stake in Scottish Citylink Coaches Ltd, with Citylink assuming certain rights to the Megabus and Motorvator brands in Scotland.

The Competition Commission ruled in October 2006 that the joint venture substantially reduced competition and that evidence suggested some routes were already experiencing higher fares as a result. Though no firm conclusion was drawn, regulators are to consult the two companies about what they need to do to comply with competition regulations and they have indicated that this will likely lead to the forced divestment of some services to an independent operator. The ruling was criticised by Stagecoach as leaving vital services in limbo and jeopardising Scotland&#x27;s intercity coach network, making it unable to compete effectively with rail and private car journeys.

To satisfy the commission, some Citylink routes were sold to Parks Motor Group in early 2008.

==Controversy==
===Competitive strategy===
Following the deregulation of bus services in the United Kingdom, Stagecoach bought a number of the newly emerged small bus companies and ran free or low fare buses to put local rivals out of business. In Darlington, Stagecoach subsidiary Busways offered bounties to recruit drivers away from the existing bus service and offered free buses to deter the rival preferred bidder from taking over the existing bus service. This was &quot;predatory, deplorable and against the public interest&quot; according to findings from the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission.

In 2000, Stagecoach Manchester was found to have been employing bus inspectors to usher passengers away from competitor&#x27;s services. During 2005, alleged aggressive behaviour by Stagecoach drivers, seeking to compete with Scotbus, resulted in an arson fire at a Stagecoach East Scotland garage.

Between 2006 and 2007, Stagecoach Manchester and UK North engaged in a bus war on route 192 and on the Wilmslow Road bus corridor that caused traffic chaos in Manchester. In November 2009, the Competition Commission ordered Stagecoach to sell Preston Bus after it had adversely affected competition in the area; the sale was completed as instructed in January 2011.

===Controversial chairman===
The Stagecoach Group has also indirectly attracted criticism through controversial statements and actions made by its chairman and co-founder, Brian Souter, regarding certain public statements and his funding of a campaign to block the repeal of the Section 28 law. In 2000, OutRage! spokesman Peter Tatchell, called for a boycott of the bus and rail group.

==Guided Busway==
Stagecoach operate buses along the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway. The Guide wheels on the side of the buses, combined with a specially built track mean that hands free driving is possible. The main advantages of a guided busway, versus a normal road are higher speeds (meaning increased capacity) and increased safety as traffic of differing directions is physically separated.

<doc id="1040597" wikidata="Q4454941" url="?curid=1040597" title="Euclidean minimum spanning tree">
<text>A Euclidean minimum spanning tree of a finite set of points in the Euclidean plane or higher-dimensional Euclidean space connects the points by a system of line segments with the points as endpoints, minimizing the total length of the segments. In it, any two points can reach each other along a path through the line segments. It can be found as the minimum spanning tree of a complete graph with the points as vertices and the Euclidean distances between points as edge weights.

The edges of the minimum spanning tree meet at angles of at least 60°, at most six to a vertex. In higher dimensions, the number of edges per vertex is bounded by the kissing number of tangent unit spheres. The total length of the edges, for points in a unit square, is at most proportional to the square root of the number of points. Each edge lies in an empty region of the plane, and these regions can be used to prove that the Euclidean minimum spanning tree is a subgraph of other geometric graphs including the relative neighborhood graph and Delaunay triangulation. By constructing the Delaunay triangulation and then applying a graph minimum spanning tree algorithm, the minimum spanning tree of formula_1 given planar points may be found in time formula_2, as expressed in big O notation. This is optimal in some models of computation, although faster randomized algorithms exist for points with integer coordinates. For points in higher dimensions, finding an optimal algorithm remains an open problem.

==Definition and related problems==
A Euclidean minimum spanning tree, for a set of formula_1 points in the Euclidean plane or Euclidean space, is a system of line segments, having only the given points as their endpoints, whose union includes all of the points in a connected set, and which has the minimum possible total length of any such system. Such a network cannot contain a polygonal ring of segments; if one existed, the network could be shortened by removing an edge of the polygon. Therefore, the minimum-length network forms a tree. This observation leads to the equivalent definition that a Euclidean minimum spanning tree is a tree of line segments between pairs of the given points, of minimum total length. The same tree may also be described as a minimum spanning tree of a weighted complete graph, having the given points as its vertices and the distances between points as edge weights. The same points may have more than one minimum spanning tree. For instance, for the vertices of a regular polygon, removing any edge of the polygon produces a minimum spanning tree.

Publications on the Euclidean minimum spanning tree commonly abbreviate it as &quot;EMST&quot;. They may also be called &quot;geometric minimum spanning trees&quot;, but that term may be used more generally for geometric spaces with non-Euclidean distances, such as spaces. When the context of Euclidean point sets is clear, they may be called simply &quot;minimum spanning trees&quot;.

Several other standard geometric networks are closely related to the Euclidean minimum spanning tree:
*The Steiner tree problem again seeks a system of line segments connecting all given points, but without requiring the segments to start and end only at given points. In this problem, additional points may be added as segment endpoints, allowing the Steiner tree to be shorter than the minimum spanning tree.
*In the Euclidean traveling salesperson path problem, the connecting line segments must start and end at the given points, like the spanning tree and unlike the Steiner tree; additionally, each point can touch at most two line segments, so the result forms a polygonal chain. Because of this restriction, the optimal path may be longer than the Euclidean minimum spanning tree, but is at most twice as long.
*Geometric spanners are low-weight networks that, like the minimum spanning tree, connect all of the points. Unlike the minimum spanning tree, all of these connecting paths are required to be short, having length proportional to the distance between the points they connect. To achieve this property, these networks generally have cycles and so are not trees.

==Properties==
===Angles and vertex degrees===

Whenever two edges of a Euclidean minimum spanning tree meet at a vertex, they must form an angle of 60° or more, with equality only when they form two sides of an equilateral triangle. This is because, for two edges forming any sharper angle, one of the two edges could be replaced by the third, shorter edge of the triangle they form, forming a tree with smaller total length. In comparison, the Steiner tree problem has a stronger angle bound: an optimal Steiner tree has all angles at least 120°.

The same 60° angle bound also occurs in the kissing number problem, of finding the maximum number of unit spheres in Euclidean space that can be tangent to a central unit sphere without any two spheres intersecting (beyond a point of tangency). The center points of these spheres have a minimum spanning tree in the form of a star, with the central point adjacent to all other points. Conversely, for any vertex formula_4 of any minimum spanning tree, one can construct non-overlapping unit spheres centered at formula_4 and at points two units along each of its edges, with a tangency for each neighbor of formula_4. Therefore, in formula_1-dimensional space the maximum possible degree of a vertex (the number of spanning tree edges connected to it) equals the kissing number of spheres in formula_1 dimensions. Planar minimum spanning trees have degree at most six, and when a tree has degree six there is always another minimum spanning tree with maximum degree five. Three-dimensional minimum spanning trees have degree at most twelve. The only higher dimensions in which the exact value of the kissing number is known are four, eight, and 24 dimensions.

For points generated at random from a given continuous distribution, the minimum spanning tree is almost surely unique. The numbers of vertices of any given degree converge, for large number of vertices, to a constant times that number of vertices. The values of these constants depend on the degree and the distribution. However, even for simple cases—such as the number of leaves for points uniformly distributed in a unit square—their precise values are not known.

===Empty regions===

For any edge formula_9 of any Euclidean minimum spanning tree, the lens (or vesica piscis) formed by intersecting the two circles with formula_9 as their radii cannot have any other given vertex formula_11 in its interior. Put another way, if any tree has an edge formula_9 whose lens contains a third point formula_11, then it is not of minimum length. For, by the geometry of the two circles, formula_11 would be closer to both formula_15 and formula_4 than they are to each other. If edge formula_9 were removed from the tree, formula_11 would remain connected to one of formula_15 and formula_4, but not the other. Replacing the removed edge formula_9 by formula_22 or formula_23 (whichever of these two edges reconnects formula_11 to the vertex from which it was disconnected) would produce a shorter tree.

For any edge formula_9 of any Euclidean minimum spanning tree, the rhombus with angles of 60° and 120°, having formula_9 as its long diagonal, is disjoint from the rhombi formed analogously by all other edges. Two edges sharing an endpoint cannot have overlapping rhombi, because that would imply an edge angle sharper than 60°, and two disjoint edges cannot have overlapping rhombi; if they did, the longer of the two edges could be replaced by a shorter edge among the same four vertices.

===Supergraphs===
Certain geometric graphs have definitions involving empty regions in point sets, from which it follows that they contain every edge that can be part of a Euclidean minimum spanning tree. These include:
*The relative neighborhood graph, which has an edge between any pair of points whenever the lens they define is empty.
*The Gabriel graph, which has an edge between any pair of points whenever the circle having the pair as a diameter is empty.
*The Delaunay triangulation, which has an edge between any pair of points whenever there exists an empty circle having the pair as a chord.
*The Urquhart graph, formed from the Delaunay triangulation by removing the longest edge of each triangle. For each remaining edge, the vertices of the Delaunay triangles that use that edge cannot lie within the empty lune of the relative neighborhood graph.
Because the empty-region criteria for these graphs are progressively weaker, these graphs form an ordered sequence of subgraphs. That is, using &quot;⊆&quot; to denote the subset relationship among their edges, these graphs have the relations:

Another graph guaranteed to contain the minimum spanning tree is the Yao graph, determined for points in the plane by dividing the plane around each point into six 60° wedges and connecting each point to the nearest neighbor in each wedge. The resulting graph contains the relative neighborhood graph, because two vertices with an empty lens must be the nearest neighbors to each other in their wedges. As with many of the other geometric graphs above, this definition can be generalized to higher dimensions, and (unlike the Delaunay triangulation) its generalizations always include a linear number of edges.

===Total length===
For formula_1 points in the unit square (or any other fixed shape), the total length of the minimum spanning tree edges is formula_28. Some sets of points, such as points evenly spaced in a formula_29 grid, attain this bound. For points in a unit hypercube in formula_30-dimensional space, the corresponding bound is formula_31. The same bound applies to the expected total length of the minimum spanning tree for formula_1 points chosen uniformly and independently from a unit square or unit hypercube. Returning to the unit square, the sum of squared edge lengths of the minimum spanning tree is formula_33. This bound follows from the observation that the edges have disjoint rhombi, with area proportional to the edge lengths squared. The formula_28 bound on total length follows by application of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.

Another interpretation of these results is that the average edge length for any set of points in a unit square is formula_35, at most proportional to the spacing of points in a regular grid; and that for &quot;random&quot; points in a unit square the average length is proportional to formula_36. However, in the random case, with high probability the longest edge has length approximately formula_37 longer than the average by a non-constant factor. With high probability, the longest edge forms a leaf of the spanning tree, and connects a point far from all the other points to its nearest neighbor. For large numbers of points, the distribution of the longest edge length around its expected value converges to a Gumbel distribution.

Any geometric spanner, a subgraph of a complete geometric graph whose shortest paths approximate the Euclidean distance, must have total edge length at least as large as the minimum spanning tree, and one of the standard quality measures for a geometric spanner is the ratio between its total length and of the minimum spanning tree for the same points. Several methods for constructing spanners, such as the greedy geometric spanner, achieve a constant bound for this ratio. It has been conjectured that the Steiner ratio, the largest possible ratio between the total length of a minimum spanning tree and Steiner tree for the same set of points in the plane, is formula_38, the ratio for three points in an equilateral triangle.

===Subdivision===
If every edge of a Euclidean minimum spanning tree is subdivided, by adding a new point at its midpoint, then the resulting tree is still a minimum spanning tree of the augmented point set. Repeating this subdivision process allows a Euclidean minimum spanning tree to be subdivided arbitrarily finely. However, subdividing only some of the edges, or subdividing the edges at points other than the midpoint, may produce a point set for which the subdivided tree is not the minimum spanning tree.

==Computational complexity==
For points in any dimension, the minimum spanning tree can be constructed in time formula_39 by constructing a complete graph with an edge between every pair of points, weighted by Euclidean distance, and then applying a graph minimum spanning tree algorithm such as the Prim–Dijkstra–Jarník algorithm or Borůvka&#x27;s algorithm on it. These algorithms can be made to take time formula_39 on complete graphs, unlike another common choice, Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm, which is slower because it involves sorting all distances. For points in low-dimensional spaces, the problem may be solved more quickly, as detailed below.

Computing Euclidean distances involves a square root calculation. In any comparison of edge weights, comparing the squares of the Euclidean distances, instead of the distances themselves, yields the same ordering, and so does not change the rest of the tree&#x27;s computation. This shortcut speeds up calculation and allows a minimum spanning tree for points with integer coordinates to be constructed using only integer arithmetic.

===Two dimensions===
A faster approach to finding the minimum spanning tree of planar points uses the property that it is a subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation:
# Compute the Delaunay triangulation, which can be done in formula_2 time. Because the Delaunay triangulation is a planar graph, it has at most formula_42 edges.
# Label each edge with its (squared) length.
# Run a graph minimum spanning tree algorithm. Since there are formula_43 edges, this requires formula_2 time using any of the standard minimum spanning tree algorithms.
The result is an algorithm taking formula_2 time, optimal in certain models of computation (see below).

If the input coordinates are integers and can be used as array indices, faster algorithms are possible: the Delaunay triangulation can be constructed by a randomized algorithm in formula_46 expected time. Additionally, since the Delaunay triangulation is a planar graph, its minimum spanning tree can be found in linear time by a variant of Borůvka&#x27;s algorithm that removes all but the cheapest edge between each pair of components after each stage of the algorithm. Therefore, the total expected time for this algorithm is formula_46. In the other direction, the Delaunay triangulation can be constructed from the minimum spanning tree in the near-linear time bound formula_48, where formula_49 denotes the iterated logarithm.

===Higher dimensions===
The problem can also be generalized to formula_1 points in the formula_30-dimensional space formula_52. In higher dimensions, the connectivity determined by the Delaunay triangulation (which, likewise, partitions the convex hull into formula_30-dimensional simplices) contains the minimum spanning tree; however, the triangulation might contain the complete graph. Therefore, finding the Euclidean minimum spanning tree as a spanning tree of the complete graph or as a spanning tree of the Delaunay triangulation both take formula_54 time. For three dimensions the minimum spanning tree can be found in time formula_55, and in any greater dimension, in time
formula_56
for any formula_57—faster than the quadratic time bound for the complete graph and Delaunay triangulation algorithms.

The optimal time complexity for higher-dimensional minimum spanning trees remains unknown, but is closely related to the complexity of computing &quot;bichromatic closest pairs&quot;. In the bichromatic closest pair problem, the input is a set of points, given two different colors (say, red and blue). The output is a pair of a red point and a blue point with the minimum possible distance. This pair always forms one of the edges in the minimum spanning tree. Therefore, the bichromatic closest pair problem can be solved in the amount of time that it takes to construct a minimum spanning tree and scan its edges for the shortest red–blue edge. Conversely, for any red–blue coloring of any subset of a given set of points, the bichromatic closest pair produces one edge of the minimum spanning tree of the subset. By carefully choosing a sequence of colorings of subsets, and finding the bichromatic closest pair of each subproblem, the minimum spanning tree may be found in time proportional to the optimal time for finding bichromatic closest pairs for the same number of points, whatever that optimal time turns out to be.

For uniformly random point sets in any bounded dimension, the Yao graph or Delaunay triangulation have linear expected numbers of edges, are guaranteed to contain the minimum spanning tree, and can be constructed in linear expected time. From these graphs, the minimum spanning tree itself may be constructed in linear time, by using a randomized linear time algorithm for graph minimum spanning trees. However, the poor performance of these methods on inputs coming from clustered data has led algorithm engineering researchers to develop methods with a somewhat slower formula_2 time bound, for random inputs or inputs whose distances and clustering resemble those of random data, while exhibiting better performance on real-world data.

A well-separated pair decomposition is a family of pairs of subsets of the given points, so that every pair of points belong to one of these pairs of subsets, and so that all pairs of points coming from the same pair of subsets have approximately the same length. It is possible to find a well-separated pair decomposition with a linear number of subsets, and a representative pair of points for each subset, in time formula_2. The minimum spanning tree of the graph formed by these representative pairs is then an approximation to the minimum spanning tree. Using these ideas, a formula_60-approximation to the minimum spanning tree may be found in formula_2 time, for constant formula_62. More precisely, by choosing each representative pair to approximate the closest pair in its equivalence class, and carefully varying the quality of this approximation for different pairs, the dependence on formula_62 in the time bound can be given as formula_64 for any fixed dimension.

===Dynamic and kinetic===
The Euclidean minimum spanning tree has been generalized in many different ways to systems of moving or changing points:
*If a set of points undergoes a sequence of dynamic insertions or deletions of points, each of these updates induces a bounded amount of change to the minimum spanning tree of the points. When the update sequence is known in advance, for points in the plane, the change after each insertion or deletion can be found in time formula_65 per insertion or deletion. When the updates must be handled in an online manner, a slower (but still poly-logarithmic) formula_66 time bound is known. For higher-dimensional versions of the problem the time per update is slower, but still sublinear.
*For formula_1 points moving linearly with constant speed, or with more general algebraic motions, the minimum spanning tree will change by a sequence of swaps, in which one edge is removed and another replaces it at a point in time where both have equal length. For linear motions, the number of changes is at most slightly larger than formula_68. For more general algebraic motions, there is a near-cubic upper bound on the number of swaps, based on the theory of Davenport–Schinzel sequences.
*The &quot;minimum moving spanning tree problem&quot; again concerns points moving linearly with constant speed, over an interval of time, and seeks a single tree that minimizes the maximum sum of weights occurring at any instant during this interval. It is NP-hard to compute exactly, but can be approximated to within a factor of two in polynomial time.
*The kinetic Euclidean minimum spanning tree problem asks for a kinetic data structure that can maintain the minimum spanning tree as its points undergo both continuous motions and insertions and deletions. Several papers have studied such structures, and a kinetic structure for algebraically moving points with near-cubic total time, nearly matching the bound on the number of swaps, is known.

===Lower bound===
An asymptotic lower bound of formula_69 of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree problem can be established in restricted models of computation. These include the algebraic decision tree and algebraic computation tree models, in which the algorithm has access to the input points only through certain restricted primitives that perform simple algebraic computations on their coordinates. In these models, the closest pair of points problem requires formula_69 time, but the closest pair is necessarily an edge of the minimum spanning tree, so the minimum spanning tree also requires this much time. Therefore, algorithms for constructing the planar minimum spanning tree in time formula_2 within this model, for instance by using the Delaunay triangulation, are optimal. However, these lower bounds do not apply to models of computation with integer point coordinates, in which bitwise operations and table indexing operations on those coordinates are permitted. In these models, faster algorithms are possible, as described above.

== Applications ==
An obvious application of Euclidean minimum spanning trees is to find the cheapest network of wires or pipes to connect a set of places, assuming the links cost a fixed amount per unit length. The first publications on minimum spanning trees more generally concerned a geographic version of the problem, involving the design of an electrical grid for southern Moravia, and an application to minimizing wire lengths in circuits was described in 1957 by Loberman and Weinberger.

Minimum spanning trees are closely related to single-linkage clustering, one of several methods for hierarchical clustering. The edges of a minimum spanning tree, sorted by their length, give the order in which to merge clusters into larger clusters in this clustering method. Once these edges have been found, by any algorithm, they may be used to construct the single-linkage clustering in time formula_2. Although the long thin cluster shapes produced by single-linkage clustering can be a bad fit for certain types of data, such as mixtures of Gaussian distributions, it can be a good choice in applications where the clusters themselves are expected to have long thin shapes, such as in modeling the dark matter halos of galaxies. In geographic information science, several researcher groups have used minimum spanning trees of the centroids of buildings to identify meaningful clusters of buildings, for instance by removing edges identified in some other way as inconsistent.

Minimum spanning trees have also been used to infer the shape of curves in the plane, given points sampled along the curve. For a smooth curve, sampled more finely than its local feature size, the minimum spanning tree will form a path connecting consecutive points along the curve. More generally, similar methods can recognize curves drawn in a dotted or dashed style rather than as a single connected set. Applications of this curve-finding technique include particle physics, in automatically identifying the tracks left by particles in a bubble chamber. More sophisticated versions of this idea can find curves from a cloud of noisy sample points that roughly follows the curve outline, by using the topology of the spanning tree to guide a moving least squares method.

Another application of minimum spanning trees is a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the Euclidean traveling salesman problem, the problem of finding the shortest polygonalization of a point set. Walking around the boundary of the minimum spanning tree can approximate the optimal traveling salesman tour within a factor of two of the optimal length. However, more accurate polynomial-time approximation schemes are known for this problem. In wireless ad hoc networks, broadcasting messages along paths in a minimum spanning tree can be an accurate approximation to the minimum-energy broadcast routing, which is, again, hard to compute exactly.

==Realization==
The &quot;realization problem&quot; for Euclidean minimum spanning trees takes an abstract tree as input and seeks a geometric location for each vertex of the tree (in a space of some fixed dimension), such that the given tree equals the minimum spanning tree of those points. Not every abstract tree has such a realization; for instance, the tree must obey the kissing number bound on the degree of each vertex. Additional restrictions exist; for instance, it is not possible for a planar minimum spanning tree to have a degree-six vertex adjacent to a vertex of degree five or six. Determining whether a two-dimensional realization exists is NP-hard. However, the proof of hardness depends on the fact that degree-six vertices in a tree have a very restricted set of realizations: the neighbors of such a vertex must be placed on the vertices of a regular hexagon centered at that vertex. Indeed, for trees of maximum degree five, a planar realization always exists. Similarly, for trees of maximum degree ten, a three-dimensional realization always exists. For these realizations, some trees may require edges of exponential length and bounding boxes of exponential area relative to the length of their shortest edge. Trees of maximum degree four have smaller planar realizations, with polynomially bounded edge lengths and bounding boxes.

<doc id="1040599" wikidata="Q1051067" url="?curid=1040599" title="Pre-dreadnought battleship">
<text>Pre-dreadnought battleships were sea-going battleships built from the mid- to late- 1880s to the early 1900s. Their designs were conceived before the appearance of in 1906 and their classification as &quot;pre-dreadnought&quot; is retrospectively applied. In their day, they were simply known as &quot;battleships&quot; or else more rank-specific terms such as &quot;first-class battleship&quot; and so forth. The pre-dreadnought battleships were the pre-eminent warships of their time and replaced the ironclad battleships of the 1870s and 1880s. 

In contrast to the multifarious development of ironclads in preceding decades, the 1890s saw navies worldwide start to build battleships to a common design as dozens of ships essentially followed the design of the Royal Navy&#x27;s . Built from steel, protected by compound, nickel steel or case-hardened steel armor, pre-dreadnought battleships were driven by coal-fired boilers powering compound reciprocating steam engines which turned underwater screws. These ships distinctively carried a main battery of very heavy guns upon the weather deck, in large rotating mounts either fully or partially armored over, and supported by one or more secondary batteries of lighter weapons on broadside.

The similarity in appearance of battleships in the 1890s was underlined by the increasing number of ships being built. New naval powers such as Germany, Japan, the United States, and to a lesser extent Italy and Austria-Hungary, began to establish themselves with fleets of pre-dreadnoughts. Meanwhile, the battleship fleets of the United Kingdom, France, and Russia expanded to meet these new threats. The last decisive clash of pre-dreadnought fleets was between the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Imperial Russian Navy at the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905. 

These battleships were abruptly made obsolete by the arrival of HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; in 1906. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; followed the trend in battleship design to heavier, longer-ranged guns by adopting an &quot;all-big-gun&quot; armament scheme of ten 12-inch guns. Her innovative steam turbine engines also made her faster. The existing battleships were decisively outclassed, with no more being designed to their format thereafter; the new, larger and more powerful, battleships built from then on were known as dreadnoughts. This was the point at which the ships that had been laid down before were re-designated &quot;pre-dreadnoughts&quot;.

==Evolution==
The pre-dreadnought developed from the ironclad battleship. The first ironclads—the French &quot;Gloire&quot; and —looked much like sailing frigates, with three tall masts and broadside batteries, when they were commissioned in the early 1860s. HMVS &quot;Cerberus&quot;, the first breastwork monitor, was launched in 1868, followed in 1871 by , a turreted ironclad which more resembled a pre-dreadnought than the previous, and its contemporary, turretless ironclads. Both ships dispensed with masts and carried four heavy guns in two turrets fore and aft. &quot;Devastation&quot; was the first ocean-going breastwork monitor; although her very low freeboard, meant that her decks were subject to being swept by water and spray, interfering with the working of her guns. Navies worldwide continued to build masted, turretless battleships which had sufficient freeboard and were seaworthy enough to fight on the high seas.

The distinction between the coast-assault battleship and the cruising battleship became blurred with the Admiral-class ironclads, ordered in 1880. These ships reflected developments in ironclad design, being protected by iron-and-steel compound armor rather than wrought iron. Equipped with breech-loading guns of between 12-inch and 16 ¼-inch (305-mm and 413-mm) caliber, the Admirals continued the trend of ironclad warships mounting gigantic weapons. The guns were mounted in open barbettes to save weight. Some historians see these ships as a vital step towards pre-dreadnoughts; others view them as a confused and unsuccessful design.

The subsequent of 1889 retained barbettes but were uniformly armed with guns; they were also significantly larger (at 14,000 tons displacement) and faster (because of triple-expansion steam engines) than the Admirals. Just as importantly, the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;s had a higher freeboard, making them unequivocally capable of performing the high-seas battleship role.

The pre-dreadnought design reached maturity in 1895 with the . These ships were built and armored entirely of steel, and their guns were now mounted in fully-enclosed rotating turrets. They also adopted main guns, which, because of advances in gun construction and the use of cordite propellant, were lighter and more powerful than the previous guns of larger caliber. The &quot;Majestic&quot;s provided the model for battleship construction in the Royal Navy and many other navies for years to come.

==Armament==
Pre-dreadnoughts carried guns of several different calibers, for different roles in ship-to-ship combat.

Very few pre-dreadnoughts deviated from what became the classic arrangement of heavy weaponry: A main battery of four heavy guns mounted in two center-line gunhouses fore and aft (these could be either fully enclosed barbettes or true turrets but, regardless of type, were later to be universally referred to as &#x27;turrets&#x27;). These main guns were slow-firing, and initially of limited accuracy; but they were the only guns heavy enough to penetrate the thick armor which protected the engines, magazines, and main guns of enemy battleships.

The most common caliber for this main armament was , although earlier ships often had larger-caliber weapons of lower muzzle velocity (guns in the 13-inch to 14-inch range) and some designs used smaller guns because they could attain higher rates of fire. All British first-class battleships from the &quot;Majestic&quot; class onwards carried 12-inch weapons, as did French battleships from the class, laid down in 1894. Japan, importing most of its guns from Britain, used this caliber also. The United States used both 12-inch and guns for most of the 1890s until the , laid down in 1899 (not the earlier of Spanish–American War notoriety), after which the 12-inch gun was universal. The Russians used both 12 and guns as their main armament; the , , , and had main batteries while the mounted 10-inch guns. The first German pre-dreadnought class used an gun but decreased to a gun for the two following classes and returned to 11-inch guns with the .

While the caliber of the main battery remained generally constant, the performance of the guns improved as longer barrels were introduced. The introduction of slow-burning nitrocellulose and cordite propellant allowed the employment of a longer barrel, and therefore higher muzzle velocity—giving greater range and penetrating power for the same caliber of shell. Between the &quot;Majestic&quot; class and &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, the length of the British 12-inch gun increased from 35 calibers to 45 and muzzle velocity increased from per second to per second.

===Secondary battery===

Pre-dreadnoughts also carried a secondary battery of smaller guns, typically , though calibers from were used. Virtually all secondary guns were &quot;quick firing&quot;, employing a number of innovations to increase the rate of fire. The propellant was provided in a brass cartridge, and both the breech mechanism and the mounting were suitable for rapid aiming and reloading. A principal role of the secondary battery was to damage the less armored parts of an enemy battleship; while unable to penetrate the main armor belt, it might score hits on lightly armored areas like the bridge, or start fires. Equally important, the secondary armament was to be used against smaller enemy vessels such as cruisers, destroyers, and even torpedo boats. A medium-caliber gun could be expected to penetrate the light armor of smaller ships, while the rate of fire of the secondary battery was important in scoring a hit against a small, maneuvrable target. Secondary guns were mounted in a variety of ways; sometimes carried in turrets, they were just as often positioned in fixed armored casemates in the side of the hull, or in unarmored positions on upper decks.

===Intermediate battery===
Some of the pre-dreadnoughts carried an &quot;intermediate&quot; battery, typically of caliber. The intermediate battery was a method of packing more heavy firepower into the same battleship, principally of use against battleships or at long ranges. The United States Navy pioneered the intermediate battery concept in the , , and classes, but not in the battleships laid down between 1897 and 1901. Shortly after the USN re-adopted the intermediate battery, the British, Italian, Russian, French, and Japanese navies laid down intermediate-battery ships. Almost all of this later generation of intermediate-battery ships finished building after &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, and hence were obsolescent before completion.

===Tertiary battery===
The pre-dreadnought&#x27;s armament was completed by a tertiary battery of light, rapid-fire guns, of any caliber from down to machine guns. Their role was to give short-range protection against torpedo boats, or to attack the deck and superstructure of a battleship.

===Torpedoes===
In addition to their gun armament, many pre-dreadnought battleships were armed with torpedoes, fired from fixed tubes located either just above or below the waterline. By the pre-dreadnought era the torpedo was typically in diameter and had an effective range of several thousand meters. However, it was virtually unknown for a battleship to score a hit with a torpedo.

=== Range of combat ===
During the ironclad age, the range of engagements increased; in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 battles were fought at distances of around ; while in the Battle of the Yellow Sea in 1904, the Russian and Japanese fleets had opened fire at over , before settling down to fight at ranges of . The increase in engagement range was due in part to the longer range of torpedoes, and in part to improved gunnery and fire control. In consequence, shipbuilders tended towards heavier secondary armament, of the same caliber that the &quot;intermediate&quot; battery had been; the Royal Navy&#x27;s last pre-dreadnought class, the &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; class, carried ten 9.2-inch guns as secondary armament. Ships with a uniform, heavy secondary battery are often referred to as &quot;semi-dreadnoughts&quot;.

==Protection==
Pre-dreadnought battleships carried a considerable weight of steel armor, providing them with effective defense against the great majority of naval guns in service during the period. &#x27;Medium&#x27; caliber guns up to 8-9.4 inch would generally prove incapable of piercing their thickest armor, while it still provided some measure of defense against even the &#x27;heavy&#x27; guns of the day which were considered capable of piercing these plates.

===Vertical side armor===
Experience with the first generations of ironclads showed that rather than giving the ship&#x27;s entire length uniform armor protection, it was best to concentrate armor in greater thickness over limited but critical areas. Therefore the central section of the hull, which housed the boilers and engines, was protected by the main belt, which ran from just below the waterline to some distance above it. This &quot;central citadel&quot; was intended to protect the engines from even the most powerful shells. Yet the emergence of the quick-firing gun and high explosives in the 1880s meant that the 1870s to early 1880s concept of the pure central citadel was also inadequate in the 1890s and that thinner armor extensions towards the extremities would greatly aid the ship&#x27;s defensive qualities. Thus, the main belt armor would normally taper to a lesser thickness along the side of the hull towards bow and stern; it might also taper up from the central citadel towards the superstructure.

===Other armor===
The main armament and the magazines were protected by projections of thick armor from the main belt. The beginning of the pre-dreadnought era was marked by a move from mounting the main armament in open barbettes to an all-enclosed, turret mounting.

The deck was typically lightly armored with of steel. This lighter armor was to prevent high-explosive shells from wrecking the superstructure of the ship.

The majority of battleships during this period of construction were fitted with a heavily-armored conning tower, or CT, which was intended for the use of the command staff during battle. This was protected by a vertical, full height, ring of armor nearly equivalent in thickness to the main battery gunhouses and provided with observation slits. A narrow armored tube extended down below this to the citadel; this contained &amp; protected the various voice-tubes used for communication from the CT to various key stations during battle.

===Metallurgical advances in armor===
The battleships of the late 1880s, for instance the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; class, were armored with iron and steel compound armor. This was soon replaced with more effective case-hardened steel armor made using the Harvey process developed in the United States. First tested in 1891, Harvey armor was commonplace in ships laid down from 1893 to 1895. However, its reign was brief; in 1895, the German pioneered the superior Krupp armor. Europe adopted Krupp plate within five years, and only the United States persisted in using Harvey steel into the 20th century. The improving quality of armor plate meant that new ships could have better protection from a thinner and lighter armor belt; of compound armor provided the same protection as just of Harvey armor or of Krupp armor.

==Propulsion==
Almost all pre-dreadnoughts were powered by reciprocating steam engines. Most were capable of top speeds between . The ironclads of the 1880s used compound engines, and by the end of the 1880s the even-more efficient triple expansion compound engine was in use. Some fleets, though not the British, adopted the quadruple-expansion steam engine.

The main improvement in engine performance during the pre-dreadnought period came from the adoption of increasingly higher pressure steam from the boiler. Scotch marine boilers were superseded by more compact water-tube boilers, allowing higher-pressure steam to be produced with less fuel consumption. Water-tube boilers were also safer, with less risk of explosion, and more flexible than fire-tube types. The Belleville-type water-tube boiler had been introduced in the French fleet as early as 1879, but it took until 1894 for the Royal Navy to adopt it for armored cruisers and pre-dreadnoughts; other water-tube boilers followed in navies worldwide.

The engines drove either two or three screw propellers. France and Germany preferred the three-screw approach, which allowed the engines to be shorter and hence more easily protected; they were also more maneuverable and had better resistance to accidental damage. Triple screws were, however, generally larger and heavier than the twin-screw arrangements preferred by most other navies.

Coal was the almost exclusive fuel for the pre-dreadnought period, though navies made the first experiments with oil propulsion in the late 1890s. An extra knot or two of speed could be gained for short bursts by applying a &#x27;forced draught&#x27; to the furnaces, where air was pumped into the furnaces, but this risked damage to the boilers if used for prolonged periods.

The French built the only class of turbine powered pre-dreadnought battleships, the of 1907.

==Pre-dreadnought fleets and battles==
The pre-dreadnought battleship in its heyday was the core of a very diverse navy. Many older ironclads were still in service. Battleships served alongside cruisers of many descriptions: modern armored cruisers which were essentially cut-down battleships, lighter protected cruisers, and even older unarmored cruisers, sloops and frigates whether built out of steel, iron or wood. The battleships were threatened by torpedo boats; it was during the pre-dreadnought era that the first destroyers were constructed to deal with the torpedo-boat threat, though at the same time the first effective submarines were being constructed.

The pre-dreadnought age saw the beginning of the end of the 19th century naval balance of power in which France and Russia vied for competition against the massive Royal Navy, and saw the start of the rise of the &quot;new naval powers&quot; of Germany, Japan and the United States. The new ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy and to a lesser extent the U.S. Navy supported those powers&#x27; colonial expansion.

While pre-dreadnoughts were adopted worldwide, there were no clashes between pre-dreadnought battleships until the very end of their period of dominance. The First Sino-Japanese War in 1894–95 influenced pre-dreadnought development, but this had been a clash between Chinese battleships and a Japanese fleet consisting of mostly cruisers. The Spanish–American War of 1898 was also a mismatch, with the American pre-dreadnought fleet engaging Spanish shore batteries at San Juan and then a Spanish squadron of armored cruisers and destroyers at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. Not until the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 did pre-dreadnoughts engage on an equal footing. This happened in three battles: the Russian tactical victory during the Battle of Port Arthur on 8–9 February 1904, the indecisive Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904, and the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905. These battles upended prevailing theories of how naval battles would be fought, as the fleets began firing at one another at much greater distances than before; naval architects realized that plunging fire (explosive shells falling on their targets largely from above, instead of from a trajectory close to horizontal) was a much greater threat than had been thought.

Gunboat diplomacy was typically conducted by cruisers or smaller warships. A British squadron of three protected cruisers and two gunboats brought about the capitulation of Zanzibar in 1896; and while battleships participated in the combined fleet Western powers deployed during the Boxer Rebellion, the naval part of the action was performed by gunboats, destroyers and sloops.

===Europe===
European navies remained dominant in the pre-dreadnought era. The Royal Navy remained the world&#x27;s largest fleet, though both Britain&#x27;s traditional naval rivals and the new European powers increasingly asserted themselves against its supremacy.

In 1889, Britain formally adopted a &quot;two-power standard&quot; committing it to building enough battleships to exceed the two largest other navies combined; at the time, this meant France and Russia, which became formally allied in the early 1890s. The &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; classes were followed by a regular program of construction at a much quicker pace than in previous years. The , , and classes appeared in rapid succession from 1897 to 1905. Counting two ships ordered by Chile but taken over by the British, the Royal Navy had 50 pre-dreadnought battleships ready or being built by 1904, from the 1889 Naval Defence Act&#x27;s ten units onwards. Over a dozen older battleships remained in service. The last two British pre-dreadnoughts, the &quot;semi-dreadnought&quot; &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;s, appeared after &quot;Dreadnought&quot; herself.

France, Britain&#x27;s traditional naval rival, had paused its battleship building during the 1880s because of the influence of the Jeune École (Young School) doctrine, which favored torpedo boats over battleships. After the Jeune École&#x27;s influence faded, the first French battleship laid down was , in 1889. &quot;Brennus&quot; and the ships which followed her were individual, as opposed to the large classes of British ships; they also carried an idiosyncratic arrangement of heavy guns, with &quot;Brennus&quot; carrying three guns and the ships which followed carrying two 12-inch and two 10.8-inch guns in single turrets. The &quot;Charlemagne&quot; class, laid down 1894–1896, were the first to adopt the standard four gun heavy armament. The Jeune École retained a strong influence on French naval strategy, and by the end of the 19th century France had abandoned competition with Britain in battleship numbers. The French suffered the most from the dreadnought revolution, with four ships of the still building when &quot;Dreadnought&quot; launched, and a further six of the &quot;Danton&quot; class begun afterwards.

Germany&#x27;s first pre-dreadnoughts, the , were laid down in 1890. By 1905, a further 19 battleships were built or under construction, thanks to the sharp increase in naval expenditure justified by the 1898 and 1900 Navy Laws. This increase was due to the determination of the navy chief Alfred von Tirpitz and the growing sense of national rivalry with the UK. Besides the &quot;Brandenburg&quot; class, German pre-dreadnoughts include the ships of the , , and &quot;Braunschweig&quot; classes—culminating in the , which served in both world wars. On the whole, the German ships were less powerful than their British equivalents but equally robust.

Russia equally entered into a program of naval expansion in the 1890s; one of Russia&#x27;s main objectives was to maintain its interests against Japanese expansion in the Far East. The &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot; class begun in 1892 took after the British &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;s; later ships showed more French influence on their designs, such as the &quot;Borodino&quot; class. The weakness of Russian shipbuilding meant that many ships were built overseas for Russia; the best ship, the &quot;Retvizan&quot;, being largely constructed in the United States. The Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 was a disaster for the Russian pre-dreadnoughts; of the 15 battleships completed since &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot;, eleven were sunk or captured during the war. One of these, the famous , mutinied and was briefly taken over by Romania at the end of the mutiny. However, she was soon recovered and recommissioned as &quot;Panteleimon&quot;. After the war, Russia completed four more pre-dreadnoughts after 1905.

Between 1893 and 1904, Italy laid down eight battleships; the later two classes of ship were remarkably fast, though the was poorly protected and the lightly armed. In some ways, these ships presaged the concept of the battlecruiser. The Austro-Hungarian Empire also saw a naval renaissance during the 1890s, though of the nine pre-dreadnought battleships ordered only the three of the &quot;Habsburg&quot; class arrived before &quot;Dreadnought&quot; made them obsolete.

===America and the Pacific===
The United States started building its first battleships in 1891. These ships were short-range coast-defense battleships that were similar to the British except for an innovative intermediate battery of 8-inch guns. The US Navy continued to build ships that were relatively short-range and poor in heavy seas, until the laid down in 1901–02. Nevertheless, it was these earlier ships that ensured American naval dominance against the antiquated Spanish fleet—which included no pre-dreadnoughts—in the Spanish–American War, most notably at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. The final two classes of American pre-dreadnoughts (the s and s) were completed after the completion of the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and after the start of design work on the USN&#x27;s own initial class of dreadnoughts. The US Great White Fleet of 16 pre-dreadnought battleships circumnavigated the world from 16 December 1907, to 22 February 1909.

Japan was involved in two of the three major naval wars of the pre-dreadnought era. The first Japanese pre-dreadnought battleships, the &quot;Fuji&quot; class, were still being built at the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, which saw Japanese armored cruisers and protected cruisers defeat the Chinese Beiyang Fleet, composed of a mixture of old ironclad battleships and cruisers, at the Battle of the Yalu River. Following their victory, and facing Russian pressure in the region, the Japanese placed orders for four more pre-dreadnoughts; along with the two &quot;Fuji&quot;s these battleships formed the core of the fleet which twice engaged the numerically superior Russian fleets at the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of Tsushima. After capturing eight Russian battleships of various ages, Japan built several more classes of pre-dreadnoughts after the Russo-Japanese War.

==Obsolescence==


In 1906 the commissioning of brought about the obsolescence of all existing battleships. &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, by scrapping the secondary battery, was able to carry ten guns rather than four. She could fire eight heavy guns broadside, as opposed to four from a pre-dreadnought; and six guns ahead, as opposed to two. The move to an &quot;all-big-gun&quot; design was a logical conclusion of the increasingly long engagement ranges and heavier secondary batteries of the last pre-dreadnoughts; Japan and the United States had designed ships with a similar armament before &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, but were unable to complete them before the British ship. It was felt that because of the longer distances at which battles could be fought, only the largest guns were effective in battle, and by mounting more 12-inch guns &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was two to three times more effective in combat than an existing battleship.

The armament of the new breed of ships was not their only crucial advantage. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; used steam turbines for propulsion, giving her a top speed of , against the typical of the pre-dreadnought battleships. Able both to outgun and outmaneuver their opponents, the dreadnought battleships decisively outclassed earlier battleship designs.

Nevertheless, pre-dreadnoughts continued in active service and saw significant combat use even when obsolete. Dreadnoughts and battlecruisers were believed vital for the decisive naval battles which at the time all nations expected, hence they were jealously guarded against the risk of damage by mines or submarine attack, and kept close to home as much as possible. The obsolescence and consequent expendability of the pre-dreadnoughts meant that they could be deployed into more dangerous situations and more far-flung areas.

===World War I===

During World War I a large number of pre-dreadnoughts remained in service. The advances in machinery and armament meant that a pre-dreadnought was not necessarily the equal of even a modern armored cruiser, and was totally outclassed by a modern dreadnought battleship or battlecruiser. Nevertheless, the pre-dreadnought played a major role in the war.

This was first illustrated in the skirmishes between British and German navies around South America in 1914. While two German cruisers menaced British shipping, the Admiralty insisted that no battlecruisers could be spared from the main fleet and sent to the other side of the world to deal with them. Instead the British dispatched a pre-dreadnought of 1896 vintage, . Intended to stiffen the British cruisers in the area, in fact her slow speed meant that she was left behind at the disastrous Battle of Coronel. &quot;Canopus&quot; redeemed herself at the Battle of the Falkland Islands, but only when grounded to act as a harbor-defense vessel; she fired at extreme range () on the German cruiser , and while the only hit was from an inert practice shell which had been left loaded from the previous night (the &quot;live&quot; shells of the salvo broke up on contact with water; one inert shell ricocheted into one of &quot;Gneisenau&quot;″s funnels), this certainly deterred &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. The subsequent battle was decided by the two s which had been dispatched after Coronel.

In the Black Sea five Russian pre-dreadnoughts saw brief action against the Ottoman battlecruiser &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; during the Battle of Cape Sarych in November 1914. Two of the Russian pre-dreadnoughts briefly engaged &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; again in May 1915.

The principle that disposable pre-dreadnoughts could be used where no modern ship could be risked was affirmed by British, French and German navies in subsidiary theatres of war. The German navy used its pre-dreadnoughts frequently in the Baltic campaign. However, the largest number of pre-dreadnoughts was engaged at the Gallipoli campaign. Twelve British and French pre-dreadnoughts formed the bulk of the force which attempted to &quot;force the Dardanelles&quot; in March 1915. The role of the pre-dreadnoughts was to support the brand-new dreadnought engaging the Turkish shore defences. Three of the pre-dreadnoughts were sunk by mines, and several more badly damaged. However, it was not the damage to the pre-dreadnoughts which led to the operation being called off. The two battlecruisers were also damaged; since &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; could not be risked in the minefield, and the pre-dreadnoughts would be unable to deal with the Turkish battlecruiser lurking on the other side of the straits, the operation had failed. Pre-dreadnoughts were also used to support the Gallipoli landings, with the loss of three more: , and . In return, a pair of Ottoman pre-dreadnoughts, the ex-German and , bombarded Allied forces during the Gallipoli campaign until the latter was torpedoed and sunk by a British submarine in 1915.

A squadron of German pre-dreadnoughts was present at the Battle of Jutland in 1916; German sailors called them the &quot;five-minute ships&quot;, which was the amount of time they were expected to survive in a pitched battle. In spite of their limitations, the pre-dreadnought squadron played a useful role. As the German fleet disengaged from the battle, the pre-dreadnoughts risked themselves by turning on the British battlefleet as dark set. Nevertheless, only one of the pre-dreadnoughts was sunk: went down in the confused night action as the battlefleets disengaged.

Following the November 1918 Armistice, the U.S. Navy converted fifteen older battleships, eight armored cruisers and two larger protected cruisers for temporary service as transports. These ships made one to six trans-Atlantic round-trips each, bringing home a total of more than 145,000 passengers.

===World War II===

After World War I, most battleships, dreadnought and pre-dreadnought alike, were disarmed under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Largely this meant the ships being broken up for scrap; others were destroyed in target practice or relegated to training and supply duties. One, , was given a special exemption to the Washington Treaty and was maintained as a museum and memorial ship.

Germany, which lost most of its fleet under the terms of the Versailles treaty, was allowed to keep eight pre-dreadnoughts (of which only six could be in active service at any one time) which were counted as armored coast-defense ships; two of these were still in use at the beginning of World War II. One of these, , shelled the Polish Westerplatte peninsula, opening the German invasion of Poland and firing the first shots of the Second World War. &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; served for most of the war as a training ship; she was sunk by air attack while under refit in December 1944. After the war, the Soviets raised the wreck and beached it for use as a stationary target in the Gulf of Finland. The other, , was mined and then scuttled in May 1945. She was partially scrapped between 1949 and 1970, but some sections remain.

A number of the inactive or disarmed pre-dreadnoughts were nevertheless sunk in action during World War II, such as the Greek pre-dreadnoughts and , bought from the U.S. Navy in 1914. While neither of the ships was in active service, they were both sunk by German dive bombers after the German invasion in 1941. In the Pacific, the U.S. Navy submarine sank the disarmed Japanese pre-dreadnought in May 1942. A veteran of the Battle of Tsushima, she was serving as a repair ship.

===Post World War II===
No pre-dreadnoughts served post–World War II as armed ships, though a number lingered on in secondary roles for a decade or more. The last serving pre-dreadnought was the former , which was used as a target ship by the Soviet Union into the early 1960s as the &quot;Tsel&quot;. The hull of the former served as a crane ship from 1920 until its scrapping in 1955. The hulk of the ex- was used as an ammunition barge at Guam until 1948, after which she was scrapped in 1956. The Turkish battleship remained in use as a barracks ship until 1950.

==Survivors==
There is only one pre-dreadnought preserved today: the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s flagship at the Battle of Tsushima, &quot;Mikasa&quot;, which is now located in Yokosuka, where she has been a museum ship since 1925.

<text>Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, (10 September 1823 – 26 March 1889), styled Earl Temple until 1839 and Marquess of Chandos from 1839 to 1861, was a British soldier, politician and administrator of the 19th century. He was a close friend and subordinate of Benjamin Disraeli and served as the secretary of state for the colonies from 1867 to 1868 and governor of Madras from 1875 to 1880.

Buckingham was the only son of Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, and was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He joined the British Army, eventually rising to become a colonel. Buckingham entered politics, as Lord Chandos, in 1846 when he was elected unopposed from Buckinghamshire as a candidate of the Conservative Party. Buckingham served as a member of Parliament from 1846 to 1857, when he resigned. He contested a re-election in 1859, but lost. Buckingham served in various political offices during his tenure.

In March 1867, he was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies and served until December 1868. He also served as governor of Madras from 1875 to 1880. As governor, he handled the relief measures for the victims of the Great Famine of 1876–1878. Buckingham also served as Lord of the Treasury, Keeper of the Privy Seal of the Prince of Wales, Deputy Warden of the Stannaries, Deputy Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, Chairman of the London and North-Western Railway, member of the Imperial Privy Council, Lord President of the Council and chairman of the committees in the House of Lords. He died in 1889 at the age of 65.

==Background and education==
Buckingham was the second child and only son of Richard, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, and his wife Lady Mary, younger daughter of John Campbell, 4th Earl of Breadalbane and Holland (later the 1st Marquess of Breadalbane). His sister, Lady Anna Eliza Mary Gore-Langton, was a women&#x27;s rights campaigner. As his father&#x27;s son and heir apparent, he was styled Earl Temple from birth. He was 15 years of age when his paternal grandfather died and his father became the 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. From this time, he was styled Marquess of Chandos until he succeeded his father as Duke.

Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1861, his titles were Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, Marquess of Chandos, and Earl Temple of Stowe in the Peerage of the United Kingdom; Marquess of Buckingham, Earl Temple, Viscount and Baron Cobham in the Peerage of Great Britain; and Earl Nugent in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1868, he was also recognised by the House of Lords as Lord Kinloss in the Peerage of Scotland. He inherited 10,500 acres, mostly in Buckingham.

The young Lord Temple, later Lord Chandos, attended Eton until 1841 and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford, from which he later received an honorary degree of D.C.L. Two years after graduation, Lord Chandos (as he then was) was commissioned a Lieutenant in the Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry and he would eventually become Honorary Colonel of that regiment. He was also Hon. Colonel of the 1st Administrative Battalion, Middlesex Artillery Volunteers and later of the City of London Artillery.

==Early career==
In 1846, Buckingham, as the Marquess of Chandos, entered Parliament as Conservative MP for Buckinghamshire, and remained as an unopposed MP until 1857. The young Lord Chandos was appointed a deputy lieutenant for Oxfordshire on 3 February 1846, Hampshire on 17 February, and Northamptonshire on 29 May.

In 1852, he entered Lord Derby&#x27;s administration as a Lord of the Treasury, a position he held for exactly ten months. That year, he was also appointed Keeper of the Privy Seal of the Prince of Wales, Deputy Warden of the Stannaries, deputy lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, and chairman of the London and North-Western Railway. In 1857, he resigned as MP for Buckinghamshire and did not stand for re-election. In 1861, he succeeded his father as Duke of Buckingham and Chandos (and in various other titles across four Peerages) and took his seat in the House of Lords. In the 1860s he was chairman of the London Pneumatic Despatch Company.

Buckingham&#x27;s political career was stagnant until 1866, when he was appointed to the Privy Council and became Lord Derby&#x27;s Lord President of the Council. He served as Lord President of the Council until 8 March 1867, when he succeeded Lord Carnarvon as Secretary of State for the Colonies.

== As Secretary of State for the Colonies ==
Buckingham was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies when Lord Carnarvon resigned in March 1867 over the Reform Bill and served from 8 March 1867 to 1 December 1868. During this period, he was also appointed Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire. As Secretary of State for the Colonies. Buckingham had to deal with the British North America Act. He also attracted controversy over his dispute with Bishop Colenso of Natal. Buckingham&#x27;s tenure ended in December 1868 when the Conservative Party ministry of Benjamin Disraeli resigned. He was succeeded as Colonial Secretary by Lord Granville.

On 21 July 1868, the House of Lords recognised him as the 10th Lord Kinloss in the Peerage of Scotland, which had been dormant since the death of the 6th Lord Kinloss, his three-times great-grandfather Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin, in 1747. Through the House of Lords ruling, Buckingham&#x27;s father was recognised posthumously as &quot;de jure&quot; 9th Lord Kinloss, his maternal grandmother Lady Anna Brydges as &quot;de jure&quot; 8th Lady Kinloss, and his great-grandfather James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos as &quot;de jure&quot; 7th Lord Kinloss. Though the lordship was the most minor of Buckingham&#x27;s many titles, it was the only one that could be inherited by his daughters, and he established his right to it at a time when the likelihood emerged that he would leave no male heir.

==Governor of Madras==
When the Conservative Party was re-elected to power in the United Kingdom in 1874 and Disraeli became the Prime Minister once again, Buckingham was appointed Governor of the Madras Presidency, British India. Buckingham moved to Madras and took his seat on 23 November 1875.

Buckingham served as the governor of Madras from 1875 to 1880. His tenure was plagued by deteriorating socio-economic and health conditions. In 1876, the Great Famine of 1876–78 broke out in Madras Presidency. By August 1877, the famine had spread all over the Presidency and over 18 million people were affected. To make matters worse, the rains failed in parts of Madras and Mysore. Large quantities of grain were shipped from Bengal to Madras port, and through his efforts, famine relief was distributed to 839,000 people in the Madras districts, besides 160,000 in the Bombay Districts and 151,000 in the Mysore districts.

The Governor appealed to the principal cities of England, Scotland, Ireland and India for assistance. At Buckingham&#x27;s suggestion, the Lord Mayor of London collected relief funds of up to £475,000 in 1877 (£ as of 2025). Though the famine eventually came to an end in 1878, the issue had far-reaching effects.

As a part of the famine relief work, Buckingham had commenced the construction of a navigation channel between Madras city and the northern part of the Madras Presidency so that transportation of supplies to the interior in cases of emergency would be easy. More than 715,000 people were employed as labourers in Madras to assist with the relief work. Opened in 1878, this canal was named after Buckingham as Buckingham Canal. Buckingham Street in Penang, Malaysia was also named after him by the Tamil labourers who were brought there during the British colonial period.

Displeasure of the tribes of the northern part of the Presidency over the stringent taxation schemes of the British government erupted in the form of a major rebellion in 1879. The rebellion was eventually suppressed through a joint operation of the Madras police and army and the Hyderabad army, and the captured prisoners were sent to the Andamans. Many of the stringent taxation laws were repealed.

On 30 August 1880, William Patrick Adam was appointed Governor of Madras and he succeeded Buckingham in December 1880.

==Later life and death==
In May 1886, Buckingham succeeded Lord Redesdale as Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords. He made few speeches in the House of Lords and succeeded in paying off most of his father&#x27;s debts. Gradually, towards the later part of his life his financial situation improved and by 1883, he owned of land with a total value of £18,080.

Buckingham died in March 1889, aged 65, from diabetes at Chandos House, London. His illness was unexpected and not originally thought to be serious; the House of Lords postponed voting on several bills until he recovered. Within a week, however, his illness proved fatal, despite the efforts of Dr. Henry Walter Kiallmark, the family physician, and Sir James Paget, who was called in to assist.

The duke was buried at the family vault in the church at Wotton House, Buckinghamshire.

With no male issue, the dukedom and marquessate of Buckingham and Chandos and the Earldom of Temple became extinct. Several of his other titles survived due to available heirs: his nephew William Gore-Langton succeeded him in 1892 as fourth Earl Temple of Stowe, which was created with a special remainder; his eldest daughter, Lady Mary, succeeded him in the Scottish lordship of Kinloss, which can be held by females, as Lady Kinloss; and his distant relative Charles Lyttelton succeeded him as eighth Viscount Cobham.

==Family==
Buckingham married firstly Caroline Harvey, daughter of Robert Harvey of Langley Park, Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, and sister of Sir Robert Harvey, 1st Baronet of Langley Park, in 1851. They had three daughters:

* Mary Morgan-Grenville, 11th Lady Kinloss (1852–1944)
* Lady Anne (1853–1890)
* Lady Caroline Jemima Elizabeth (1858–1946)

Caroline, Duchess of Buckingham and Chandos, died in February 1874.

Buckingham married, secondly, Alice Graham-Montgomery, daughter of Sir Graham Graham-Montgomery, 3rd Baronet, in 1885. Born in 1848, she was 25 years younger than him. In 1897, she was one of the guests at the Duchess of Devonshire&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Costume Ball. There were no children from this marriage. Widowed in 1889, Alice, Dowager Duchess of Buckingham and Chandos, married the 1st Earl Egerton in 1894. She died in 1931, aged 83.

<doc id="1040606" wikidata="Q1060146" url="?curid=1040606" title="Challengers of the Unknown">
<text>The Challengers of the Unknown is a fictional group of adventurers appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. The quartet of adventurers explored paranormal occurrences while facing several fantastic menaces.

The characters&#x27; provenance is uncertain. Various sources credit the group as the sole creation of artist and storyteller Jack Kirby, a co-creation with writer Dave Wood or a co-creation with Kirby&#x27;s former partner Joe Simon. Following the end of the &quot;Challengers&quot; comic, DC has revived the characters in different incarnations over the years.

Some have claimed that Kirby reworked the basic concept of the series with Stan Lee in 1961 to create &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;, the first creation that marked the rise of Marvel Comics.

==Publication history==
The adventuring quartet the Challengers of the Unknown debuted in &quot;Showcase&quot; #6 (February 1957), in an uncredited story attributed to Jack Kirby for art and to Kirby and Dick Wood for script, under editor Jack Schiff.

The series continued in the bimonthly &quot;Showcase&quot; for three more appearances (#7, 11–12, April 1957, December 1957 – February 1958) then moved to its own title, starting with issue #1 (May 1958). Kirby moved on after issue #8 (July 1959), with Bob Brown succeeding him as artist. The title continued through issue #75 (September 1970), followed by two reprint issues. The series was canceled with issue #77 in 1971 (January 1971). In 1973, three reprint issues were published (#78–80). The team’s lineup was briefly enhanced with the inclusion of the paranormal sensitive Corrina Stark toward the end of this run.

===Revivals===
The Challengers had a short-lived 1976–77 revival in &quot;Super-Team Family&quot; #8–10. The group then returned to its own title continuing the number with #81. During this period, they were joined by Deadman and Swamp Thing, and associate June Robbins got a uniform and official status. No explanation was given for Corinna Stark&#x27;s departure, nor June&#x27;s joining the team. The revived series was canceled with issue #87 in 1978. &quot;Adventure Comics Digest&quot; #493–497 (1982) featured an expanded version of the team&#x27;s origin.

The Challengers returned in a limited series, &quot;Challengers of the Unknown&quot; (vol. 2) (1991), by writer Jeph Loeb and artist Tim Sale. It ran eight issues and was reprinted in trade paperback as &quot;Challengers of the Unknown Must Die!&quot; (2004). This series depicted the Challengers in middle age, breaking up after a tragic accident and coming back together as a team. Loeb hoped for a monthly title, and planned at least a second limited series, but neither volume materialized. Elements of this revival later appeared in several Superboy stories around the turn of the millennium, as a second, unrelated group had a title in the late 1990s as part of the Weirdoverse line.

In 2000, DC published a one-shot, &quot;Silver Age: Challengers of the Unknown&quot;, done in the style of the original Silver Age of Comic Books Challengers.

==Fictional group history==
The roster included Ace Morgan, Prof Haley, Rocky Davis and Red Ryan, with their occasional companion June Robbins. Ryan was killed and briefly replaced by his younger brother Marty, a pop singer who used the anagram ID of Tino Manarry. Red Ryan returned from the dead and Tino was written out after suffering an injury that left him blind. Toward the end of the original series, a woman with an occult background named Corinna Stark acted as a fifth member of the team.

===&quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;===
Prepublication solicitations for various &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; tie-ins referred to the group of Donna Troy, Jason Todd, Kyle Rayner, and &quot;Bob&quot; (a nefarious, renegade &quot;purist&quot; Monitor), as &quot;Challengers from Beyond&quot;. This group went on a quest through the newly formed multiverse to find Ray Palmer, whom Bob claimed was essential to the survival of the universe. Eventually the Earth heroes were betrayed by Bob, who sought to kill Palmer, rather than protect him or acquire his aid. Palmer, Troy, Todd, and Rayner found themselves involved in a war between the Monitors and Monarch&#x27;s forces. Later they traveled to Apokolips, where they teamed up with Jimmy Olsen, Forager, Karate Kid and Triplicate Girl. After returning to Earth, Troy, Rayner, Forager, and Palmer decided to team up again. They traveled to the Monitors&#x27; headquarters, where they informed the shocked beings that they would be watching over them as a sort of interdimensional border guards.

===&quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;===
The 2007 revival of &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; series features a storyline involving the Challengers. Destiny of the Endless reveals to Supergirl and Lobo that his &quot;Book of Destiny&quot; has changed because there appeared to be men who existed, but were not recorded in the book, and their undocumented actions made the book unreliable. Destiny cast the book away, and it was eventually recovered by Batman and Green Lantern with the help of the Challengers, the men in question, who become the new holders of the book. Destiny later reclaims the book.

Leslie &quot;Rocky&quot; Davis appears regularly in &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, in which he serves as something of a counselor to the members of that team, and resides on Oolong Island.

===Post-&quot;Flashpoint&quot;===
In 2011, the DC Universe was dramatically altered, giving very different back stories to many of its heroes and villains. This version of the Challengers incorporates elements of the original and 1990s lineups.

The Challengers were formed for a reality television contest, when several notable people were assembled by archaeologist presenter Clay Brody for his &quot;Challengers&quot; program. Clay, the contestants, producer June, and pilots Ace and Maverick, were lost in the Himalayas when their plane crashed under mysterious circumstances. All but one of them showed up weeks later, remembering a recuperation in Nanda Parbat, in which the city&#x27;s elder told them to beware the unknown, but also to challenge it. Returning to civilization, the group found a talisman that had led Clay to pick them, and a note explaining that it was one of a set.

The Challengers program was retooled to take advantage of the quest. With their home base on a Metropolis soundstage dubbed &quot;Challengers Mountain&quot;, the group sought out the talismans in far-flung corners of the world, usually accompanied by some oddity, like warrior statues or giant-ant-spewing portals. Their greatest initial challenge came when in a short period their show was cancelled and they were attacked by their dead friend, &quot;Ace&quot; the pilot. Though he killed two of them, they managed to defeat him, and the survivors vowed to find the rest of the talismans and save the world.

The original Challengers Prof, Ace, Red, and Rocky were on a mission on an Earth in the Dark Multiverse when Prof was badly wounded. He figured out how to use the dark energy to heal himself. In doing so he inadvertently sent his dark multiverse counterpart to the multiverse. The Dark Prof created a new Challengers that he could use to collect the remains of an ancient god whose remains were flung through time and space when the Source Wall was destroyed. The Dark Prof recruits Trina Alvarez, Moses Barber, Krunch, and Bethany Hopkins as the most current incarnation of the team. They soon discover his evil intentions and send him back to the Dark Multiverse, saving Ace, Red, Rocky and Prof in the process.

===Alternative versions===

DC published two other series, also titled &quot;Challengers of the Unknown&quot;, featuring the original Challengers&#x27; concept combined with a new set of characters.

The Challengers were revamped by writer Steven Grant in vol. 3 (1997), which had a totally new group of characters and was one of four series making up the Weirdoverse group of titles. This ongoing series ran 18 issues, through 1998. This team of paranormal investigators met the original Challengers and even had Rocky agree to advise them.

One more revamp was done by Howard Chaykin in a six-issue miniseries (vol.   4, 2004–2005). This series had another new group of characters and was entirely unrelated to the previous two incarnations.

==Fictional character biographies==
When acquaintances miraculously survive a plane crash unscathed, they conclude that since they are &quot;living on borrowed time&quot; they should band together for hazardous adventures. The four—pilot Kyle &quot;Ace&quot; Morgan, daredevil Matthew &quot;Red&quot; Ryan, strong and slow-witted Leslie &quot;Rocky&quot; Davis, and scientist Walter Mark &quot;Prof&quot; Haley—became the Challengers of the Unknown.

Soon famous, the Challengers accept many &quot;unknown challenges&quot; from The Pentagon, mad scientists, and people with a problem. Over time the &quot;Challs&quot; establish the hollowed-out Challengers Mountain as headquarters. Later they adopt an hourglass logo to symbolize time running out. They encounter genies, common and sophisticated thieves, rocs, aliens and robots good and bad. Their adventures later veer toward superheroics, and take in everything from occult menaces to Bermuda Triangle mysteries. The Challengers travel through space, time, and other dimensions. They encounter the likes of the Doom Patrol, Deadman, Swamp Thing, Jonny Double, and the Sea Devils, with whom they fight the criminal group Scorpio. June Robbins, a computer genius and archaeologist, joined the Challengers for many adventures as an &quot;honorary&quot; or &quot;girl&quot; Challenger. June first officially joins the team after the rogue robot &#x27;Ultivac&#x27; seemingly kills one of the original Challengers. However that man returns thanks to heroic efforts of modern medical science.

When Red is killed, a teen rock star/engineering genius immediately wages a vendetta against the three-man team. &quot;Tino Mannaray&quot; turns out to be Martin Ryan, Red&#x27;s kid brother, who blames the team for his death. Red eventually returns; though blown up, he had been dosed with shape-changing Liquid Light and rendered amnesiac, but still nearly conquered the Pacific as a Tiki god.

As the team&#x27;s challenges become more occult, Red&#x27;s brother Tino is blinded. Red donates an eye to his brother and dons an eye patch. Eventually Red receives an eye transplant. Prof becomes possessed by an evil spirit and is shot by a villain. While he recovers, Corinna Stark, a mysterious blonde with mystical knowledge, invites herself onto the team. The Challengers fight occult alien-monsters in backwoods villages and dark dreams, and Rocky and Red fight for Corinna&#x27;s affection.

===Challengerville===
The Challs are later semi-retired, their mountain a theme park, and their adventures disregarded as cooked-up articles in a tabloid, &quot;The Tattletale&quot;. The nearby town has renamed itself Challengerville, managing to thrive on the team&#x27;s name. A cosmic entity, which prides itself as &quot;the personification of all evil&quot;, influences the entity Multi-Man to blow up the mountain. The town is destroyed. Hundreds die, including, seemingly, Prof and June. The surviving Challengers are placed on trial, but eventually freed with the testimony of Superman. They are, however, ordered to disband.

A tabloid reporter, Moffet, becomes involved with the group after several unexplained incidents. Moffet begins to piece together many seemingly unrelated massacres. Red became a violent, vigilante mercenary. Ace becomes an addled mystic, losing new-found friends due to inattention and incompetence. Rocky becomes lost in a life of luxury and ends up in an insane asylum.

Eventually the three reunite, and with Moffet&#x27;s aid, find a strange portal near what was once Challengerville. They discover Prof and June, pregnant, &quot;alive&quot; in a strange &quot;phantom zone&quot;. The dark demon confronts them and the final battle comes down to Moffet and a neutron bomb. The decision to attack is literally taken out of his hands by Multi-Man, who sacrifices himself to destroy the demon.
&quot;The New Challengers of the Unknown&quot;, including ghostly Prof and June, were poised to take on menaces in the dark corners of the world.

Later, four new Challengers pursue &quot;X-Files&quot;-like horrors. They are Clay Brody, NASCAR driver; Brenda Ruskin, physicist; Kenn Kawa, radical games designer; and Marlon Corbet, commercial pilot, who also miraculously survived a plane crash. They stopped sacrificial wackos, drug-juiced zombies, vengeful ghosts, Amazon cults, Lovecraftian monsters, mass suicides, humming buildings, and other oddities. They were advised by Rocky Davis, older and grayer and alone. It was eventually revealed that the original Challengers were dematerialized by a mad scientist&#x27;s ray-weapon. The same ray caused both plane crashes, as well as others. Soon the original Challs reappeared, helped the young Challs defeat the madman, then walked back into oblivion (minus a wounded Rocky) to shut down a runaway Tesla field. The young Challengers vowed to fight on.

Superboy discovers the missing Challengers—Ace, Red, Prof, and June—in Hypertime. The team was waging guerrilla war against Black Zero (a Superboy variant). With Black Zero defeated, the team returns to Earth, but loses Red along the way. Reunited with Rocky in Metropolis, hosted by Rip Hunter, the original Challengers vow to explore Hypertime, &quot;the greatest unknown&quot;, to find Red.

Two Challengers partake in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. Rocky Davis and Prof Haley help stem the escape of prisoners from Blackgate Prison. Rocky fights in the &quot;Battle of Metropolis&quot;. He is one of dozens of heroes fighting the opposing army of the &quot;Secret Society of Super Villains&quot;. The Society is ultimately defeated.

Later, on a world without superheroes, a blogger, a hip hop artist, an eco-terrorist, and two others discovers they had been genetically enhanced and chip-programmed to be soldier-pawns by the Hegemony, a cabal of billionaires who secretly run that world. Made slaves on a Moon base, three Challengers blow up the base, escape to Earth, and declare war on the Hegemony until (like the obliquely mentioned earlier Challengers) their &quot;borrowed time&quot; runs out.

in &quot;DC All In&quot;, the Challengers of the Unknown join the Justice League as maintenance workers on the Watchtower.

==Other versions==
The Challengers make a brief appearance in the Elseworlds miniseries &quot;Conjurers&quot;, set in an alternate DCU where magic is a part of mainstream society. These are the &quot;Volume 3&quot; Challengers, but given the nicknames of the originals: Kenn is &quot;Prof&quot;, Clay is &quot;Rocky&quot;, Brenda is &quot;Red&quot;, and Marlon is &quot;Ace&quot;. Since Kenn was always shown as the most &quot;mystical&quot; of the new Challs, it makes sense that he would be &quot;Prof&quot; in a magical universe, rather than Brenda, the team&#x27;s scientist.

During Superboy&#x27;s trip through Hypertime, referenced above, he briefly visits an Elseworld in which the Challengers were himself, Ace, Guardian, and Dubbilex. The June who arrives in the DCU at the end of that story is also an Elseworlds version, coming from a universe where she was a full Challenger from the beginning. She was apparently exchanged with the June of the main timeline when she was struck by Hypertime energies.

The Challengers also made brief appearances in &quot;&quot; (when all time periods meld together) and &quot;The Adventures of Superman Annual&quot; #7 (as part of a strikeforce of non-powered heroes).

They were prominently featured in Darwyn Cooke&#x27;s &quot;&quot; miniseries (2003–2004). Various members were essential in many battles against menaces that arose throughout the series.

In the 1996 crossover series Amalgam Comics, the Challengers were merged with the Fantastic Four to become Challengers of the Fantastic.

=== 1996 series (volume 3) ===
Started as a part of DC&#x27;s Weirdoverse group of titles, the 1996 series was published for a total of eighteen issues, cover dated February 1997 to July 1998. The characters were a mix of races and were, like the original group, the only survivors of a plane crash:

* Kenn Kawa: A man of Japanese heritage and originally a game designer.
* Clay Brody: A white male, originally a race car driver.
* Brenda Ruskin: A white woman, originally a physicist.
* Marlon Corbet: An African American man, originally the pilot of the plane that crashed.

The 1996 series was originally conceived as the basis for a television series that never came about, as writer Steven Grant revealed in 2000:

This team investigated paranormal disturbances across America as they were hunted by Saxon, a mystical being who also survived the plane crash that led to the team’s formation. Though the series was generally unrelated to superhero conventions and the broader DC Universe, the group participated in the Superman storyline Millennium Giants and later have original Challengers member Rocky Davis as a mentor. After the comic was canceled, the characters did not appear in any comics until 2011’s New 52 event that rebooted all DC Comics titles. When the Challengers appear in this new comic universe, it includes characters from the original and 1990s versions.

=== 2004 series (volume 4) ===

<doc id="1040607" wikidata="Q5289230" url="?curid=1040607" title="Dollar Tree">
<text>Dollar Tree, Inc. is an American multi-price-point chain of discount variety stores. Headquartered in Chesapeake, Virginia, it is a &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 (sometimes referred to as Fortune 200) company and operates 15,115 stores throughout the 48 contiguous U.S. states and Canada. Its stores are supported by a nationwide logistics network of 24 distribution centers. Additionally, the company operates stores under the name of Dollar Bills, as well as a multi-price-point variety chain under the Family Dollar banner.

Dollar Tree competes in the dollar store and low-end retail markets. Each Dollar Tree stocks a variety of products, including national, regional, and private-label brands. Departments found in a Dollar Tree store include health and beauty, food and snacks, party, seasonal décor, housewares, glassware, dinnerware, household cleaning supplies, candy, toys, gifts, gift bags, and wrap, stationery, craft supplies, teaching supplies, automotive, electronics, pet supplies, and books. Most Dollar Tree stores also sell frozen foods and dairy items such as milk, eggs, pizza, ice cream, frozen dinners, and pre-made baked goods. In August 2012, the company began accepting manufacturer coupons at all of its store locations.

Dollar Tree, and dollar stores in general, have been alleged to create food deserts: areas with poor access to healthy and affordable food. Dollar Tree disputes this claim, and claims that it creates food options in areas that would otherwise be deserts.

==History==
===Early years===
In 1953, K. R. Perry opened a Ben Franklin variety store in Norfolk, Virginia, which later became known as &quot;K&amp;K 5&amp;10&quot;.

In 1970, K. R. Perry, Doug Perry, and Macon Brock started &quot;K&amp;K Toys&quot; in Norfolk, Virginia. This mall concept grew to over 130 stores on the East Coast.

In 1986, Doug Perry, Macon Brock, and Ray Compton started another chain store called &quot;Only $1.00&quot; with five stores, one in Georgia, one in Tennessee, and three in Virginia. The expansion of dollar stores was continued alongside K&amp;K Toys stores, mostly in enclosed malls.

On April 27, 1989, the first “Dollar Tree”-branded store opened at the Jessamine Mall in Sumter, South Carolina. In a May 1989 advertisement in the Sun-News, the fledgling chain, apparently already planning 100 stores for the eastern United States, bills the dollar-pricing model as the “hottest new shopping concept in America.”

===1990s===
In 1991, the corporation made a decision to focus exclusively on the expansion of dollar stores after selling K&amp;K stores to KB Toys, owned by Melville Corporation.

In 1993, the name &quot;Only $1.00&quot; was changed to &quot;Dollar Tree Stores&quot; to address what could be a multi-price-point strategy in the future, and part equity interest was sold to SKM partners, a private equity firm.

The Perrys and Brock got the idea for the company from another retailer known as Everything&#x27;s A Dollar, which went bankrupt in the 1990s.

In 1996, Dollar Tree acquired &quot;Dollar Bill$, Inc.&quot;, a Chicago-based chain of 136 stores.

In 1997, the company opened its first distribution center and its new store support center, both located in Chesapeake, Virginia.

In 1999, Dollar Tree acquired &quot;Only $One&quot; stores based in New York. That same year, the company opened its second distribution center in Olive Branch, Mississippi.

===2000s===
In 2000, Dollar Tree acquired &quot;Dollar Express&quot;, a Philadelphia-based company, and also built a new distribution center in Stockton, California. In 2001, the company opened two additional distribution centers in Savannah, Georgia and Briar Creek, Pennsylvania. In 2003, Dollar Tree acquired Salt Lake City, Utah-based &quot;Greenbacks, Inc.&quot;, and opened a new distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma.

In 2004, Dollar Tree opened its first store in North Dakota which marked its operation of stores in all 48 contiguous states. The company also opened new distribution centers in Joliet, Illinois and Ridgefield, Washington.

In 2006, Dollar Tree celebrated its 20th year of retailing at a $1.00 price point, opened its 3,000th store, and acquired 138 &quot;DEAL$&quot; stores, previously owned by SUPERVALU INC.

In 2007, Dollar Tree expanded its Briar Creek Distribution Center and crossed the $4 billion sales threshold. In 2008, Dollar Tree earned a place in the Fortune 500. By the close of 2009, the company opened a store in Washington, D.C., and purchased a new distribution center in San Bernardino, California.

In 2009, Dollar Tree redesigned its website with a new e-commerce platform. DollarTree.com sells Dollar Tree merchandise in larger quantities to individuals, small businesses, and organizations. The company also advertises in-store events, specials, seasonal promotions, and featured products through the site, and users can locate a retail store, research information about Dollar Tree, and view product recalls. Dollar Tree also added customer ratings and reviews, and customer stories to the site.

===2010s===
In 2010, the corporation opened its 4,000th chain store and acquired 86 Canadian Dollar Giant stores which are based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The stores are operated in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. These are the first retail locations outside of the United States operated by Dollar Tree.

In 2011, Dollar Tree achieved total sales of $6.63 billion, opened 278 new stores, and completed a expansion of its distribution center in Savannah, Georgia.

In 2012, Dollar Tree opened another 345 new stores and exceeded $7 billion in sales.

On July 28, 2014, Dollar Tree announced that it was offering $9.2 billion for the purchase of competitor chain store Family Dollar. On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7 billion for Family Dollar. The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014, by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree.

In January 2015, Dollar Tree announced plans to divest 300 stores in order to appease US regulators scrutinizing its proposed takeover of Family Dollar stores.

In June 2015, the firm agreed to sell 330 stores to private equity company Sycamore Partners as part of the approval process for its $8.5 billion takeover of Family Dollar.

The company was ranked 134 on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the United States corporations by revenue.

In March 2019, as part of its reposition plan, Dollar Tree announced that it will close up to 390 Family Dollar stores along with renovating 1,000 other locations.

===2020s===

On March 3, 2021, it was announced that Dollar Tree had quietly introduced a combination Family Dollar/Dollar Tree store concept, with the first one opening in early 2021. Dollar Tree has opened and operated nearly 50 locations by the end of 2020, primarily in small towns with populations of just a few thousand people.

On September 28, 2021, CEO Michael Witynski, citing increased shipping and labor costs squeezing profit margins, announced that some prices will be rising above $1, possibly to as much as $1.50.

On November 23, 2021, it was announced that Dollar Tree plans to raise its prices from a dollar for typical items to $1.25 in response to inflation and pressure from investors to raise prices. Some of the items sold at Dollar Tree will not have their prices increased. The retailer will introduce the new price point in more than 2,000 stores by December 2021 and complete the roll-out across most of its 8,000 stores by the first quarter of 2022.

On March 13, 2024, Dollar Tree reported a loss of $1.71 billion for latest quarter and announced the closure of near 1,000 stores.

In December 2024, Dollar Tree announced that its Board of Directors appointed Interim CEO Michael C. Creedon, Jr. as permanent Chief Executive Officer. Creedon had joined Dollar Tree in 2022 as Chief Operating Officer and in November 2024 he was appointed Interim Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Rick Dreiling. Creedon has responsibility for leading more than 200,000 associates and more than 16,000 stores across the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners.

==Business strategy==
Dollar Tree is classified as an extreme discount store. It claims to be able to achieve this because their buyers &quot;work extremely hard to find the best bargains out there,” and it has &quot;great control over the tremendous buying power at the dollar price-point.” Its prices are primarily designed to attract financially disadvantaged customers, but it has also become popular within immigrant communities.

===Family Dollar bidding===
On July 28, 2014, Dollar Tree announced that a deal had been reached and approved by both parties to purchase Family Dollar for $8.5 billion plus acquisition of the $1 billion in debt currently held by Family Dollar. The deal came in the month following activist investor and major shareholder Carl Icahn&#x27;s demand that Family Dollar be promptly put up for sale. After their reported deal had been struck, Dollar General entered the bidding, surpassing Dollar Tree&#x27;s offer, with a $9.7 billion bid on August 18, 2014. On August 20, 2014, Family Dollar rejected the Dollar General bid, saying it was not a matter of price, but concerns over antitrust issues that had convinced the company and its advisers that the deal could not be concluded on the terms proposed. The Family Dollar board had been analyzing potential antitrust issues that could arise from doing a deal with Dollar General, since the start of the year a statement from CEO Howard Levine outlined.

=== Allegations of creating food deserts ===
Dollar Tree, and dollar stores in general, have been alleged by a number of studies, individuals, and organizations to proliferate food deserts: areas with limited access to healthy and affordable food. Dollar Tree has disputed this claim; it claimed that in a number of cases it created food options in food deserts. Dollar stores are alleged to outcompete local grocery stores, and end up being one of the few options available for purchasing food in some communities. In 2023, Dollar Tree reportedly stopped selling eggs when the price of eggs increased. In line with these allegations, a number of states have passed restrictions on where new dollar stores can be opened.

==Canada==
On October 11, 2010, Dollar Tree announced its acquisition of Dollar Giant, incorporated in 2001 in Vancouver, Canada, for $52 million. At the time of the acquisition, Dollar Giant had about 85 retail outlets in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. Approximately 30 of its retail locations are in British Columbia, making it the second largest dollar store chain in that province. It was Canada&#x27;s fourth largest operator of dollar stores. Dollar Tree has since rebranded all of its Dollar Giant stores to Dollar Tree; these were the first retail locations outside of the United States operated by Dollar Tree.

, the company operates 227 stores across Canada, concentrated in Western Canada and Ontario. All Dollar Tree stores in Canada sell items for C$1.50 or mentioned otherwise which is usually less than C$2.

Dollar Tree Canada&#x27;s merchandising team is located in Mississauga, Ontario, while its corporate office remains in Burnaby in Greater Vancouver.

==Recalls==
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission lists several recalls for products sold at Dollar Tree stores. The recalled products include salsa jars with broken glass inside them, hot-melt mini glue guns (recalled in January 2008) which could short circuit and cause burns, and candle sets (recalled in February 2004) that could produce excessive flame.

<doc id="1040609" wikidata="Q1202851" url="?curid=1040609" title="Kihachi Okamoto">
<text>was a Japanese film director who worked in several different genres.

==Career==
Born in Yonago, Okamoto attended Meiji University, but was drafted into the Air Force 1943 and entered World War II, an experience that had a profound effect on his later film work, one third of which dealt with war. Finally graduating after the war, he entered the Toho studies in 1947 and worked as an assistant under such directors as Mikio Naruse, Masahiro Makino, Ishirō Honda, and Senkichi Taniguchi. He made his debut as a director in 1958 with &quot;All About Marriage&quot;.

Okamoto directed almost 40 films and wrote the scripts for at least 24, in a career that spanned almost six decades. He worked in a variety of genres, but most memorably in action genres such as the jidaigeki and war films. He was known for making films with a twist. Inspired to become a filmmaker after watching John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, he would insert elements of the Western in war films like &quot;Desperado Outpost&quot; (1959) and &quot;Westward Desperado&quot; (1960), and eventually even filmed his own samurai Western in &quot;East Meets West&quot; (1995). A fan of musicals, he made over-the-top films such as &quot;&quot; (1964), a gangster Noh musical, and &quot;Dixieland Daimyo&quot; (1986), about jazz musicians entering Bakumatsu Japan. Over all, he took on &quot;a very rhythmic approach to filming and editing action sequences. Carefully timed placement of sound effects and music combined with camera movement and movement within the frame to form a very rhythmic, almost musical whole.&quot; His basically critical stance towards Japanese society led him to often pursue satire and black comedy, with his &quot;The Age of Assassins&quot; (1967) becoming so dark and absurd, Toho initially refused to release it.

Okamoto could also be serious. His samurai films, such as &quot;Samurai Assassin&quot; (1965), starring Toshiro Mifune, about a group of 19th century political agitators planning to kill an important government official, &quot;The Sword of Doom&quot; (1966), or &quot;Kill!&quot; (1968), were often critical of bushidō and Tokugawa period Japan. Yet he approached this critique from his own perspective. Toho entrusted him with the epic &quot;Japan&#x27;s Longest Day&quot; (1968), a cinematic version of what happened to official Japan at the end of the war, but the next year he also made &quot;The Human Bullet&quot; for Art Theatre Guild, a more personal and satirical vision of an everyman&#x27;s experience of World War II. To pursue some of his projects, Okamoto formed Okamoto Productions. His wife, Mineko Okamoto, often worked as producer on his later works.

He won the 1992 Japan Academy Prize for Director of the Year for &quot;Rainbow Kids&quot;. Alongside Akira Kurosawa, Okamoto was also a candidate for directing the Japanese sequences for &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970) but instead Kinji Fukasaku and Toshio Masuda were chosen.

On February 19, 2005, just two days after his 81st birthday, Okamoto died at home from esophageal cancer.

A photograph of Okamoto was used to portray the character of Goro Maki in the 2016 film &quot;Shin Godzilla&quot;, which was directed by Hideaki Anno, a self-professed fan of Okamoto.

<doc id="1040612" wikidata="Q3061525" url="?curid=1040612" title="Everyman Theatre, Liverpool">
<text>The Everyman Theatre stands at the north end of Hope Street in Liverpool, Merseyside, England. It was founded in 1964, in Hope Hall (once a chapel, then a cinema), in an area of Liverpool noted for its bohemian environment and political edge, and quickly built a reputation for ground-breaking work. The Everyman was completely rebuilt between 2011 and 2014.

==History==

The building was constructed as Hope Hall, a dissenters&#x27; chapel built in 1837. In 1841 it became a church dedicated to Saint John the Evangelist. This became a public concert hall in 1853. In 1912 the hall was turned into Hope Hall Cinema, which continued serving this purpose until it closed in 1963. Prior to its closure the hall had become a meeting place for local artists, poets, folk musicians, and sculptors, including Arthur Dooley, Roger McGough, and Adrian Henri, forming what became known as the Liverpool Scene. This group decided that the building would be suitable for use as a theatre and in September 1964 the Everyman Theatre was opened by Martin Jenkins, Peter James and Terry Hands.
In 1975 the theatre closed and was rebuilt, its work being continued as a touring company until it re-opened in September 1977. During the 1970s and the 1980s, led by Director Alan Dossor works of Liverpool playwrights, Alan Dossor, Willy Russell and Alan Bleasdale, received debuts in the theatre: these included &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; and &quot;John, Paul, George, Ringo … and Bert&quot;. In addition to plays, the theatre has produced musicals, concerts, and an annual rock-n-roll panto each Christmas. During its time the theatre has been involved with the careers of Dame Julie Walters, Stephen Graham, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Pryce, Alan Scarfe, Pete Postlethwaite, Antony Sher, Bill Nighy, Barbara Dickson, Matthew Kelly, and Cathy Tyson.

The theatre is managed together with Liverpool Playhouse by Liverpool and Merseyside Theatres Trust since 2004. The two theatres have worked to an integrated programme run by their artistic director and their executive director. Together they are registered as a charity known as Liverpool and Merseyside Theatres Trust Limited.

==Closure and rebuilding==

In July 2011 the theatre closed to be completely rebuilt. The last major production was &quot;Macbeth&quot;, starring David Morrissey and Julia Ford, which closed on 11 June. This was followed by performances from Roger McGough and Brian Patten, and by the local pop band Deaf School. The final closure event took place on 2 July. From 28 July contents of the theatre, including seats and benches from the theatre, and pillars from the original Hope Hall, were available for purchase by auction.

The Everyman reopened in February 2014. In October 2014, the Stirling Prize from the Royal Institute of British Architects for the best British building of the year was awarded to Haworth Tompkins for their work on the new Everyman.

==Bistro==

In 1970, Paddy Byrne and Dave Scott established a restaurant in the basement of the theatre known as the Liverpool Everyman Bistro, which became a popular dining venue in the city. After the Everyman closed for rebuilding in 2011, they retired temporarily and then opened a new restaurant, The Pen Factory, next door in Hope Street. There were plans to create a similar restaurant to be associated with the new theatre but run under different management. However, by 2019 the basement space was in use for events rather than as a bistro. There is a Street Cafe at ground level.

<doc id="1040625" wikidata="Q2867951" url="?curid=1040625" title="Montreal Annexation Manifesto">
<text>The Montreal Annexation Manifesto was a political document dated September 14, 1849, and signed in Montreal, Canada East, calling for the Province of Canada&#x27;s annexation by the United States.

The manifesto was published in two versions (October 11, 1849, and December 1849) by the &quot;Annexation Association&quot;, an alliance of 325 Montreal businessmen. Most of these were English-speaking Tories, who were opposed to Britain&#x27;s abolition of the Corn Laws, which ended preferential colonial trade, and by its consent to the Rebellion Losses Bill, and French Canadian nationalists (including Louis-Joseph Papineau) who supported the republican system of government in the United States. These businessmen believed that so long as Canada was under British rule, it would be subjected to the interests of elements of Britain&#x27;s aristocracy and businessmen. Papineau too had believed a similar subjection occurred, perpetrated by France.

The signatories believed that, given the tiny population and limited transportation routes in Canada compared to that of the United States, the abolition of customs duties at such an early point in Canada&#x27;s economic development would be disastrous for Canadian business. They predicted a lack of foreign capital investment leading to economic downturn and massive job losses.

News of the annexation movement and its manifesto was widely reported in New York. The &quot;New-York Daily Tribune&quot; sent a correspondent to Montreal. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; and &quot;New York Times&quot; newspapers both responded with editorials proposing that the British colony should first negotiate independence from the UK&#x27;s rule, as an intermediate step before joining with the United States.

Future Prime Minister of Canada John Abbott was a signatory to the manifesto, though he later described that action as a youthful error.

The manifesto was strongly opposed by members of the British American League and by leading politicians such as Robert Baldwin plus the followers of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine. After the signing of the Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty in 1854, the annexation movement died out.

<text>A legal doctrine is a framework, set of rules, procedural steps, or test, often established through precedent in the common law, through which judgments can be determined in a given legal case. For example, a doctrine comes about when a judge makes a ruling where a process is outlined and applied, and allows for it to be equally applied to like cases. When enough judges make use of the process, it may become established as the &quot;de facto&quot; method of deciding like situations.

<doc id="1040631" wikidata="Q14688980" url="?curid=1040631" title="Heartland Inn">
<text>Heartland Inn is a Waterloo, Iowa, based chain of hotels. The company operated 19 locations, with 18 in Iowa and one in Wisconsin. The company was put up for sale by Joe Minard at the start of June 2007, the sale includes Heartland Midwest Management and 18 of the 19 properties (All except the Clear Lake, IA Location) Only one location remains in Iowa City/Coralville, Iowa.

==Background==
In 1984, Joe Minard and Ross Christensen of Waterloo began efforts to develop hotels. They decided that there was a need for moderately priced hotels. They opened the first such hotel in Waterloo. Eventually 18 other locations were opened in Iowa and Wisconsin.

The hotels are built with a red brick exterior. The majority of Heartland Inns are &quot;rooms only&quot; facilities, but many of the hotels have swimming pools. The hotels also offer a deluxe continental breakfast featuring over 30 different hot and cold items. Competitors include Microtel, Red Roof Inn, and Park Inn/Suites.

The company began moving in 2006 towards making their properties entirely smoke free. On June 14, 2006, the company announced that their hotels were 100% smoke-free. Heartland Inn was one of the first hotel chains to move all their properties in such a direction. American Cancer Society has since endorsed the smoke-free status of Heartland Inn.

<doc id="1040632" wikidata="Q1761192" url="?curid=1040632" title="Early Summer">
<text>is a 1951 Japanese drama by Yasujirō Ozu. Like most of Ozu&#x27;s post-war films, &quot;Early Summer&quot; deals with issues ranging from communication problems between generations to the rising role of women in post-war Japan. The plot concerns Noriko, who lives contentedly in an extended family household that includes her parents and her brother&#x27;s family, but an uncle&#x27;s visit prompts the family to find her a husband.

==Plot==

Noriko, a secretary in Tokyo, lives in Kamakura, Kanagawa with her extended Mamiya family, which includes her parents Shūkichi and Shige, her older brother Kōichi, a physician, his wife Fumiko, and their two young sons Minoru and Isamu.

An elderly uncle arrives and reminds everyone that Noriko, who is 28, should marry. At work, Noriko&#x27;s boss Satake recommends a match for her with a forty-year-old friend of his, Mr. Manabe, a businessman and golfer. Noriko&#x27;s friends are divided into two groups—the married and the unmarried—who tease one another endlessly, with Aya Tamura being her close ally in the unmarried group. Noriko&#x27;s family gently pressures Noriko into accepting the match proposed by Satake, agreeing that it is time for her to marry and believing that the match proposed is a good one for someone her age.

Childhood friend Kenkichi Yabe, a doctor, widower, and father to a young daughter, arranges to have tea with Noriko and gives her a sheaf of wheat. The sheaf is a gift from a brother who was killed during World War II and who had asked Yabe to deliver it to Noriko in case he did not return. Later, Yabe is posted to Akita, in northern Honshu. Akita is considered so rural that Noriko and Aya make fun of the area&#x27;s accent. However, when Yabe&#x27;s mother Tami impulsively asks Noriko to marry Yabe and follow them in their northward resettlement, Noriko agrees. When Noriko reveals her decision, her family is quietly devastated. They hint to her that the match is a poor one. When Noriko persists, the family is forced to live with their disappointment.

The family gradually accepts Noriko&#x27;s choice with quiet resignation, and before she moves on, the family takes a photograph together. Noriko&#x27;s parents console themselves that Noriko and Kenkichi will move back to Tokyo in a few years&#x27; time, reuniting the family. Meanwhile, the parents move to a rural region to stay with Noriko&#x27;s elderly uncle. In the final scene, Noriko&#x27;s parents watch a bride pass down the country road in her traditional costume. The final shot is of a barley field ripening around.

== Cast ==
==Reception==
&quot;Early Summer&quot; is highly regarded by today&#x27;s critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports 100% approval among 11 critics, with an average rating of 8.90/10.In 2009, the film was ranked at No. 106 on the list of the &quot;Greatest Japanese Films of All Time&quot; by Japanese film magazine &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot;.

==Home media==

In 2004, The Criterion Collection released a new, higher-definition digital transfer, with restored image and sound and new English subtitle translation. Also included were the original theatrical trailer, an audio commentary by Donald Richie, &quot;Ozu’s Films from Behind-the-Scenes&quot;, a conversation about Ozu and his working methods between child actor and sound technician Kojirō Suematsu, assistant cameraman Takashi Kawamata, and Ozu producer Shizuo Yamanouchi, and essays by David Bordwell and Jim Jarmusch.

In 2010, the BFI released a Region 2 Dual Format Edition (Blu-ray + DVD), this time in proper high definition. Included with this release is a standard-definition presentation of &quot;What Did the Lady Forget?.&quot;

<text>William Raymond Nesbit (June 1, 1899 – August 6, 1983) was an American jewel thief active in the 1930s. He was born in Marshalltown, Iowa.

==Background==
On December 31, 1936, he killed fellow thief Harold Baker in a gunpowder explosion in Minnehaha County, near Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He was arrested February 26, 1937, and was convicted and sentenced on May 28, 1937, to life imprisonment, which on February 18, 1946, was commuted to 20 years incarceration. Imprisoned in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, he eventually became a &quot;trusty&quot; and the personal chauffeur of the warden. 

==Disappearance and capture==
On September 4, 1946, he failed to return from running errands, and on December 26, 1946, he was charged &quot;in absentia&quot; with unlawful flight to avoid confinement. On March 15, 1950, he became the third member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s first-ever FBI ten most wanted fugitives list, and was arrested in a cave in Saint Paul, Minnesota, three days later.

== Death ==
Nesbit died at a hospital in Sioux City, Iowa, on August 6, 1983. He had been suffering from a long illness prior to his death.

<text>Arthur Wentworth Roebuck, , (February 28, 1878 – November 17, 1971) was a Canadian politician and labour lawyer.

==Background==
Roebuck was born in Hamilton, Ontario in 1878 and grew up on a farm in Wellington County, near Guelph. He worked as a reporter for the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot; and in 1905 became owner/editor of the &quot;Temiskaming Herald&quot; in New Liskeard and the &quot;Cobalt Citizen&quot;. He sold them in 1915 when he left to study law, graduating from Osgoode Hall after three years. In 1918, he married Inez Perry and together they raised one daughter.

==Politics==

===Provincial===
Roebuck ran a Liberal candidate in Temiskaming in the 1911 Ontario general election and the 1914 Ontario general election but failed to get elected. He also ran in the 1917 Canadian federal election. He was involved with the United Farmers of Ontario and its successor, the Progressive Party, in the 1920s before rejoining the Liberals. He finally won a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1934 provincial election that brought the Ontario Liberal Party led by Mitchell Hepburn to power.

Roebuck was a senior figure in the Hepburn government serving as Attorney-General of Ontario from 1934 to 1937 as well as Minister of Labour from 1934 until 1935. A progressive, Roebuck promoted the rights of Jews against the anti-Semitism that was still prevalent in 1930s Ontario, and defended the rights of trade unions. He broke with Hepburn over the government&#x27;s handling of the 1937 United Auto Workers strike against General Motors in Oshawa, and resigned in protest with fellow minister David Croll. Roebuck remained as the Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Toronto riding of Bellwoods until 1940.

He attempted to return to provincial politics running for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party at its 1943 leadership convention to succeed Hepburn, but finished second to Harry Nixon.

===Federal===
Roebuck ran for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1917 federal election as a Laurier Liberal, but was defeated.

Re-entering federal politics, Roebuck was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for the Toronto riding of Trinity in the 1940 federal election after successfully challenging sitting Liberal MP Hugh Plaxton for the party&#x27;s nomination.

===Senate===
In 1945, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, and remained in the Upper House until his death. At the outset of his appointment, he worked with the Canadian Jewish Congress and Rabbi Avraham Aharon Price to have young, Jewish refugees released from internment camps to study in Toronto.

He was an important figure in the civil liberties movement in Canada following the war. Following the Igor Gouzenko Affair, Roebuck opposed the government&#x27;s suspension of the individual rights of individuals accused of espionage, and criticized the use of the Royal Commission on Espionage&#x27;s transcripts in court. Later, he participated in the defence of Israel Halperin, one of the accused spies, and chaired the Senate Committee on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in 1950, advocating the creation of a Canadian Bill of Rights.

Roebuck opposed Pierre Elliott Trudeau&#x27;s Senate reform proposal in 1969.

<doc id="1040648" wikidata="Q1129337" url="?curid=1040648" title="Consolidated Vultee XP-81">
<text>The Consolidated Vultee XP-81 (later redesignated ZXF-81) is a development of the Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation to build a single seat, long range escort fighter that combined use of both turbojet and turboprop engines. Although promising, the lack of suitable engines combined with the end of World War II doomed the project.

==Design and development==
Two prototype aircraft were ordered on 11 February 1944 that were designated XP-81. The engine selection was an attempt to couple the high-speed capability of the jet engine with the endurance offered by the propeller engine. The XP-81 was designed to use the General Electric TG-100 turboprop engine (later designated XT31 by the US military) in the nose driving a four-bladed propeller and a GE J33 turbojet in the rear fuselage. The turboprop would be used for normal flight and cruising and the turbojet added for high-speed flight.

==Operational history==

The first XP-81 (serial 44-91000) was completed in January 1945 but because of developmental problems the turboprop engine was not ready for installation. A decision was then made to mount a complete V-1650-7 engine package from a P-51D aircraft in place of the turboprop for initial flight tests. This was done in a week and the Merlin-powered XP-81 was sent to the Muroc airbase where it flew for the first time on 11 February 1945. During 10 flight test hours, the XP-81 displayed good handling characteristics except for inadequate directional stability due to the longer forward portion of the fuselage (this was rectified by enlarging the vertical tail).

While 13 YP-81 pre-production aircraft had been ordered, the capture of Guam and Saipan obviated the need for long-range, high-speed escort fighters and then, just before VJ Day the contract was cancelled, after 85% of the engineering was completed. The YP-81 was to be essentially the same as the prototype but with a lighter and more powerful GE TG-110 (XT41) turboprop engine, the wing moved aft 10 inches (0.25 m), and armament of either six .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine guns or six 20 mm cannon.

After the XP-81 was returned to Vultee Field, the TG-100 turboprop was installed and flight testing resumed, including the first flight by an American turboprop-powered aircraft on 21 December 1945. However, the turboprop engine was not able to produce its designed power; producing only the same output as the Merlin (1,490 hp or 1112 kW) with the resultant performance limited to that of the Merlin-engined version.

With the termination of hostilities, the two prototypes continued to be tested until 1947 when they were both consigned to a bombing range as photography targets.

<doc id="1040650" wikidata="Q2247273" url="?curid=1040650" title="Aida cloth">
<text>Aida cloth (sometimes called Java canvas) is an open, even-weave fabric traditionally used for cross-stitch embroidery. This cotton fabric has a natural mesh that facilitates cross-stitching and enough natural stiffness that the crafter does not need to use an embroidery hoop.

== Characteristics ==
Aida cloth is manufactured with various size spaces or holes between the warp and weft to accommodate different thicknesses of yarn. These are described by the count. For example, a 10-count aida cloth would have 10 squares per linear inch. Typical sizes are 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 count, ranked from the coarsest to the finest count. Traditional colours are white and ecru, though black, grey, shades of tan and brown, and other brighter colors are also available. Aida cloth is sold in precut sheets or in bolts of 40&quot; - 60&quot; width at most craft stores.

Aida cloth has a tendency to fray and often needs hemming before use. It should never be laundered prior to craft work and tends to contract when the finished item is washed in soap and water. Hand washing improves the appearance of finished cross-stitching because Aida cloth naturally contracts in specific areas where it is embroidered.

== Pronunciation ==
The consensus from various discussions on Usenet group &quot;rec.crafts.textiles.needlework&quot; is that there are two ways to pronounce the word &quot;Aida&quot;: either , as in the opera by Verdi, or . Since the name change from &quot;Java&quot; to &quot;Aida&quot; occurred not long after Verdi&#x27;s opera was first performed, there has been some speculation that the cloth was renamed after the opera to take advantage of the opera&#x27;s publicity.

== Matty ==
Matty is a fabric similar to Aida. It is another material suitable for embroidery. The fabric structure (open plain weave) makes it convenient to count threads in cross-stitch work. The material is used for various linens.

<doc id="1040651" wikidata="Q3535569" url="?curid=1040651" title="Tourtière">
<text>Tourtière (, ) is a French Canadian meat pie dish originating from the province of Quebec, usually made with minced pork, veal or beef and potatoes. Wild game meat such as bear meat or venison is sometimes used. It is a traditional part of the Christmas &quot;réveillon&quot; and New Year&#x27;s Eve meal in Quebec. It is also popular in New Brunswick, and is sold in grocery stores across the rest of Canada all year long. It gets its name from the tourte, which is what it was originally made from. Though the name &quot;tourtière&quot; is derived from its filling, the tourte—the French name for the passenger pigeon that is now extinct in North America—was historically used as its filling before the 20th century.

Tourtière is not exclusive to Quebec. It is a traditional French-Canadian dish served throughout Canada and the bordering areas of the United States. In the New England region of the U.S., especially in Maine, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts (e.g., Chicopee and Attleboro), late 19th and early 20th century, immigrants from Quebec introduced the dish.

There is no one correct filling; the meat depends on what is regionally available. In coastal areas, fish such as salmon is commonly used, whereas pork, beef, rabbit and game are often included inland. The name derives from the vessel in which it was originally cooked, a tourtière.

Tourtière du Lac-Saint-Jean has become the traditional and iconic dish of the region of Saguenay, Quebec, since the Second World War, and it has undergone several metamorphoses.

During the 18th century, &quot;sea pie&quot; became popular among French and British colonists, and it seems to be &quot;the direct forerunner of the tourtière of Lac-Saint-Jean&quot;.

Tourtière has been called &quot;an example of &#x27;the cuisine of the occupied,&#x27; food that is French by way of the British, who took Quebec in 1759.&quot;

==Types of tourtière==
===Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and Eastern Quebec===
The tourtières of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area and Eastern Quebec are slow-cooked deep-dish meat pies made with potatoes and various meats (often including wild game or turkey) cut into small cubes.

Elsewhere in Quebec and the rest of Canada, this variety of tourtière is sometimes referred to, in French and in English, as &quot;Tourtière du Lac-Saint-Jean&quot; or &quot;tourtière saguenéenne&quot; to distinguish it from the varieties of tourtière with ground meat.
In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area, however, the varieties of tourtière with ground meat are typically referred to as &quot;pâté à la viande&quot; (&quot;meat pie&quot;), while the name &quot;tourtière&quot; is reserved exclusively for their local variety.

===Montreal===

Tourtière in Montreal is made with finely ground pork only (which can be hard to find as the meat is often ground too coarsely elsewhere). Water is added to the meat after browning, and cinnamon and cloves give it a distinctive flavour. Many people use ketchup as a condiment, though the tourtière is also often eaten with maple syrup or molasses, or cranberry preserves.

Although it is less popular than the original tourtière and the tourtière du Lac-Saint-Jean, this version can also be commonly found throughout Canada and its surrounding areas.

===Manitoba===

Tourtière is an integral part of holiday-time meals for French Canadians in the Winnipeg neighbourhoods of St. Boniface and St. Norbert, as well as in Manitoba&#x27;s rural Francophone areas. Browned meat is seasoned with varying combinations of savory, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, celery salt, dry mustard, salt and pepper.

===Acadia===
Acadian tourtière, or pâté à la viande (pâté is casserole or pie), is a pork pie that may also contain chicken, hare and beef. Pâté à la viande varies from region to region in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. In Petit-Rocher and Campbellton the dish is prepared in small pie plates and known as &quot;petits cochons&quot; (little pigs).

<doc id="1040666" wikidata="Q3181675" url="?curid=1040666" title="John Hale (minister)">
<text>John Hale (June 3, 1636 – May 15, 1700) was the Puritan pastor of Beverly, Massachusetts, and took part in the Salem witch trials in 1692. He was one of the most prominent and influential ministers associated with the witch trials, being noted as having initially supported the trials and then changing his mind and publishing a critique of them.

His book, &quot;A Modest Enquiry Into the Nature of Witchcraft&quot; was published posthumously, two years after his death. The book provides an alternative Christian theory for what actually happened in Salem in 1692, with Hale theorizing that demons impersonated the accused and appeared in their forms to the afflicted. It&#x27;s a common misconception that he changed his views on the subject of witchcraft after his wife was accused. However, he was already showing signs of his different views in testimony he gave and other records from the trials. 

==Biography==
John Hale was born on June 3, 1636, in Charlestown, Massachusetts Bay Colony. The oldest child of Robert Hale, a blacksmith, he was educated at Harvard College in Cambridge, graduating in 1657. He began preaching in Bass-river-side, later called Beverly, about 1664, and was ordained as the first minister of the parish church there on September 20, 1667, when the congregation formally separated from Salem. He married his first wife, Rebecca Byly, on December 15, 1664, and she died April 13, 1683, at the age of 45.
As a child, Hale had witnessed the execution of Margaret Jones, one of the first of 15 people to be executed for witchcraft in New England and the first to be executed in Massachusetts, between 1647 and 1663. He was present at the examinations and trials of various people who were accused of witchcraft in the Salem witch trials of 1692, and supported the work of the court. However, on November 14, 1692, 17-year-old Mary Herrick accused his second wife, Sarah Noyes Hale, and the ghost of executed Mary Eastey of afflicting her, but his wife was never formally charged or arrested. A later commentator on the trials, Charles Upham suggests that this accusation was one that helped turn public opinion to end the prosecutions, and spurred Hale&#x27;s willingness to reconsider his support of the trials.

After the trials, Sarah died and Hale began writing his book &quot;A Modest Inquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft&quot;, in which he suggested the fear of witchcraft was so great that it impaired the judgment of everyone involved in the trials, possibly resulting in the death of innocent people. Hale died at the age of 63 in 1700, and the book was published two years later.

==Adaptation in &#x27;The Crucible&#x27;==

In Arthur Miller&#x27;s 1953 play &quot;The Crucible&quot;, a fictional portrayal of Hale appears in Act I in a request from Samuel Parris that he examine his daughter, Betty Parris. Hale&#x27;s quick visit to examine Betty causes him to become one of the main characters in the play.

Hale is depicted as a young minister who has devoted most of his life to the study of witchcraft and other demonic arts in the hope of being able to destroy them in the name of God. He has found a &#x27;witch&#x27; in his home town of Beverly, Massachusetts, where he preaches. Hale is the minister in charge of discovering who has the &quot;marks of the Devil&quot; for the witch trials. As a devout Christian, Hale sees it as his duty to seek out the witches, and to &#x27;save their souls&#x27;. After seeing the horrors of the witch trials and watching the loss of both civil and human rights, Hale has a conversion of heart and speaks out against them, telling Judge Danforth that they are morally wrong. Hale leaves the court when Mary Warren accuses John Proctor of witchcraft, famously declaring, &quot;I denounce these proceedings. I quit this court!&quot; to which Danforth replies, running after him, &quot;Mr. Hale, Mr. Hale!&quot;

=== Screen Adaptations of &#x27;The Crucible&#x27; ===
In the 1957 screen adaptation of Miller&#x27;s piece, Hale was depicted by Yves Brainville. In the 1996 film version of the play, he was portrayed by Rob Campbell, as a much younger man than would have been historically accurate, the real Hale being fifty-six at the time of the trials. However, Arthur Miller&#x27;s play is itself not entirely historically accurate, particularly in pertaining to ages of the characters; Abigail Williams would have been closer to 12 than 17, for instance, John Proctor would have been near 60.

In the movie, Hale&#x27;s wife is accused by Abigail Williams once she begins to suspect him of doubting her claims. This is quickly dismissed by Danforth, leading to Abigail escaping from the village. He later sadly witnesses the hanging of Rebecca Nurse, Martha Corey and John Proctor.

John Hale is played by Xander Berkeley (as Magistrate Hale) in the 2014 TV series &quot;Salem&quot;.

<text>Andre Michael Ward (born February 23, 1984) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 2004 to 2017. He retired with an undefeated record and held multiple world championships in two weight classes, including unified super middleweight titles between 2009 and 2015, and unified light heavyweight titles between 2016 and 2017.

During his reign as light heavyweight champion, Ward was ranked as the world&#x27;s best active boxer, pound for pound, by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine and the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB), as well as the world&#x27;s best active boxer in the division by &quot;The Ring&quot;, the TBRB, and BoxRec. As of August 2024, BoxRec ranks Ward as the 67th greatest boxer of all time, pound for pound. In 2024, &quot;ESPN&quot; ranked him as the 7th greatest men&#x27;s boxer of the 21st century.

As an amateur boxer, Ward won the light heavyweight gold medal at the 2004 Olympics and turned professional later that year. He rose to worldwide prominence upon entering the Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament in 2009, where he won the World Boxing Association (WBA) super middleweight title (Super version) from Mikkel Kessler in the opening group stage. In 2011, Ward defeated World Boxing Council (WBC) champion Carl Froch in the tournament final to unify the titles, as well as winning the vacant &quot;Ring&quot; magazine and lineal titles. That same year, Ward was named Fighter of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; and the Boxing Writers&#x27; Association of America.

In 2016, following a long period of sporadic in-ring activity, Ward moved up to light heavyweight and won the WBA (Undisputed version), International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Organization (WBO) titles from then-undefeated Sergey Kovalev. This earned Ward the Comeback of the Year award by &quot;The Ring&quot;. He successfully defended his titles in a rematch against Kovalev a year later, after which he retired from boxing. Ward was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2021, his first year of eligibility.

==Early life==
Andre was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Frank Ward, an Irish American and Madeline Arvie Taylor an African American. Andre&#x27;s career started when his father took him to U.S. Karate School of the Arts, a boxing gym in Hayward, California, when he was nine years old. After his parents fell to drug abuse, Ward was looked after by his godfather, Virgil Hunter, who became his trainer and remained his trainer for the length of his career.

He attended Hayward High School.

==Amateur career==
Ward started boxing in 1994. In 2002, he won the Under 19 National Championship and was also a two time U.S. National Champion in 2001 and 2003 at middleweight. Ward finished his amateur career with a record of 115 wins and 5 losses.

==Professional career==

===Super middleweight===

====Early years====
Ward made his pro debut on December 18, 2004, by scoring a second round TKO over Chris Molina. On February 5, 2005, Ward fought in his second pro fight against Kenny Kost. Ward overcame a rocky second round, in which he was hurt by a left hook, to win by unanimous decision. Ward defeated Roy Ashworth on April 7, 2005, by disqualification.

Ward won his next three fights, all by knockout, before going up against Darnell Boone on November 19, 2005. Ward was knocked down for the first time in his career in round four. Despite the knockdown, Ward went on to win by unanimous decision.

After the fight with Boone, Ward went on to win his next six fights, including TKO victories over undefeated Andy Kolle (this fight was the last of five that Ward fought within the middleweight limit of 160 lbs) and Francisco Diaz. On November 16, 2007, Ward beat undefeated Roger Cantrell by fifth-round TKO in Saint Lucia.

At this point, Ward&#x27;s record was 14 wins, no losses. He was ready to step up to his biggest challenge against big American puncher Allan Green (25–1, 18 KOs), with the fight scheduled to take place on February 2, 2008, on HBO. The fight was called off because Green had an obligation with ESPN to fight Rubin Williams on January 4. Green won the bout, and had hoped to fight Ward later in the year. He eventually got his chance two years later, losing a unanimous decision.

On March 20, 2008, at the HP Pavilion in San Jose, California, Ward defeated Rubin Williams by seventh-round TKO. Ward hit Williams with jabs and straight left hands almost at will, opening a bad cut over Williams&#x27; left eye in the process. The cut would force the referee to stop the fight.

Ward faced Jerson Ravelo on June 20, 2008, in Georgetown, Cayman Islands, for the vacant regional NABO super-middleweight title. Ward dominated Ravelo for most of the fight en route to a TKO victory in the eighth round.

On May 16, 2009, at the Oracle Arena in Oakland, California, Ward defeated former prospect Edison Miranda by unanimous decision. The scores were 116–112, 119–109, and 119–109 for Ward. Ward showed he had an inside game as well as an outside game. Miranda couldn&#x27;t stay up with Ward&#x27;s versatility around the ring. Miranda said of Ward in the post fight, &quot;I thought it was going to be easier, but it was tougher than I was expected. I don&#x27;t feel cheated. Andre is the champion. I have respect for him.&quot; Ward, who fought his biggest name to date said, &quot;This is kind of a bittersweet victory. I&#x27;m happy and excited because the fans had a good time, and there were a lot of people here, but I&#x27;m not 100 percent happy with my performance. I&#x27;ve got to go look at the tape. I did some things well, but I felt I could have improved in other areas.&quot;

On September 12, 2009, at the Pechanga Resort and Casino in Temecula, California, Ward defeated Shelby Pudwill by TKO in the 3rd round.

====Super Six World Boxing Classic====
=====Ward vs. Kessler=====

Ward&#x27;s first fight in the tournament took place in his hometown of Oakland, California, against Ring Magazine #1 ranked and joint tournament favorite Mikkel Kessler (42–1, 32 KO) on November 21, 2009. Kessler&#x27;s WBA super-middleweight championship was also at stake. Ward defeated Kessler to via technical decision in round 11 to win his first world title. Kessler was the strong favorite going into Showtime&#x27;s Super Six tournament. In a career-defining performance, undefeated hometown favorite Ward put the U.S. on the board in the Super Six and captured the WBA super middleweight title with a dominant 11 round technical decision over Denmark&#x27;s Kessler in their Group Stage 1 bout. The fight was stopped in round 11 due to cuts on Kessler&#x27;s face caused by what was deemed unintentional headbutts by Ward. The fight went to the scorecards and Ward was far ahead by scores of 98–92, 98–92, and 97–93 at the time of the stoppage.

=====Ward vs. Green=====
In January 2010 Jermain Taylor announced his exit from Showtime&#x27;s Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament. &quot;The Ring&quot; Top 10 ranked super-middleweight Allan Green (25–1, 18 KOs) was selected as his replacement and challenged Andre Ward on June 19. Ward, defending the WBA super middleweight title, outclassed an opponent who spent most of the fight with his back against the ropes. Ward defeated Green by unanimous decision on June 19, 2010. Though the 30-year-old gamely fought on, the knockout he needed to win never appeared remotely likely and he looked a spent man by the end as he picked up the second loss of his 31-fight pro career. Throughout the fight, Ward out landed Green by nearly 200 punches. All three judges scored the fight lop-sided 120–108 for Ward, who said post-fight of his win, &quot;This means a lot to me. Couldn&#x27;t get caught up in the first defense too much mentally. Now that it&#x27;s over with, I&#x27;m ecstatic I was able to defend this belt one time. I feel like a real champion now.&quot; Ward stated his only regret was that he wasn&#x27;t able to stop Green, who turned up to survive. Ward advanced to the semi-finals.

Ward was exempt from the final preliminary fight in the Super Six because he had already secured a number one position in the elimination rounds and his designated opponent (Andre Dirrell) had dropped out of the tournament. Dirrell&#x27;s trainer and uncle Leon Lawson Jr., told ESPN that Dirrell had neurological problems. Instead, Ward successfully defended his WBA super middleweight title, unanimously outpointing another top 10 ranked super middleweight, Sakio Bika (28–4–2), in front of a sparse crowd at Oracle Arena on Saturday night. Fighting in front of his hometown crowd as part of a dual-site co-main event, Ward didn&#x27;t land many big shots but repeatedly hit Bika with a stinging left jab that the challenger was unable to counter. Ward won all 12 rounds on one judges scorecard and was ahead 118–110 on the other two. Bika landed 201 of his 612 punches (33%), but Ward was more precise with his shots, landing 235 of 398 (59%). Ward later admitted it was his toughest fight to date, since he became professional.

=====Ward vs. Abraham=====

Ward&#x27;s opponent at the semi-final stage was top 10 ranked super middleweight Arthur Abraham (32–2, 26 KOs). The fight took place on May 14, 2011, at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California. Abraham entered having lost two of his previous three bouts. Ward started out slow with Abraham, trying to find a way to penetrate his tight defense. After a competitive first few rounds, Ward seized control of the fight, using his ring savvy and instincts to control Abraham. Although Abraham was somewhat passive at times, he gave an earnest effort and frequently threw combinations that were mostly blocked by Ward. Abraham hurt Ward a couple of times in the final round, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to finish Ward, who had dominated the fight and won a lopsided unanimous decision. The three judges scored the bout 120–108, 118–110, and 118–111. ESPN had it 118–110 in favor of Ward. Abraham didn&#x27;t believe he had lost the fight with such wide scores. Over 12 rounds, Ward threw 289 jabs. In total he landed 178 of 444 total punches thrown (40%).

In the post fight interviews, Abraham said through a translator, &quot;I started well, and I thought I did good the first three rounds He didn&#x27;t hit me, and I was blocking a lot of his shots. But then I tried for the knockout, and I couldn&#x27;t do it. I cramped up, and I got too tense.&quot; Ward had to adjust his game plan as he was unable to fight on the inside. He said, &quot;We&#x27;re going to the final, baby. Arthur is strong, and he&#x27;s a hard hitter, [but] we showed that we can win in a way other than our original game plan [...] &quot;I wish the ref had let me fight on the inside, because that&#x27;s what I had planned for. But we made adjustments and got the win.&quot;

=====Ward vs. Froch=====

Advancing to the final of the Super Six, Ward fought WBC super middleweight champion Carl Froch (28–1, 20 KOs) in front of 5,626 at Boardwalk Hall on December 17, 2011. Ward and Froch were rated #1 and #2 respectively by Ring magazine, and the vacant &quot;Ring&quot; magazine super middleweight title was on the line, as well as Froch and Ward&#x27;s super middleweight titles.

Ward won the Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament via unanimous decision . Over the first seven rounds, Ward outboxed Froch, successfully using his jab to neutralize Froch and beating Froch to the punch from a distance and at close range. In the later rounds, Ward seemed to take his foot off the gas, leaving Froch to win a couple rounds near the end of the fight, though they were close and fairly competitive rounds. An MRI later revealed that Ward injured his lead left hand on which he relied for landing hooks to Froch&#x27;s head. The hand was broken in two places. Ward noted extreme pain in the sixth round of the fight as well as one week prior, though the initial X-ray came back clear. The judges scorecards were 115–113, 115–113, and 118–110 all in favor of Ward. CompuBox statistics showed that Ward landed 243 of 573 punches thrown (42%), whilst Froch landed 156 of 683 punches (23%). After the bout, Ward gave a victory speech, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe it, I can&#x27;t believe it -- it&#x27;s not so unbelievable that we never thought we were going to win, but now that it&#x27;s happened, it is unbelievable. We told you this is what we wanted to do. We wanted to fight on the inside and on the outside, and we pulled it off tonight. We were able to beat him to the punch, and that&#x27;s what won us the fight.&quot; Froch also praised Ward in winning the tournament, &quot;Fair credit to Andre Ward. He&#x27;s very good defensively. I lost the fight, fair and square. It was quite hard to hit him. The name of the game is to not get hit, and he did that well.&quot;

Ward won the vacant &quot;Ring&quot; and lineal super middleweight titles with his Super Six World Boxing Classic win against Froch, despite some independent sources rating then-undefeated IBF champion Lucian Bute at number one or two at the time. The fight peaked at 580,000 viewers on Showtime.

The World Boxing Council Board of Governors voted to make Ward &quot;Champion in Recess&quot; due to a broken hand Ward had sustained during the Super Six tournament.

====Ward vs. Dawson====
Ward&#x27;s next fight was announced on June 22, 2012, to take place at the Oracle Arena in Oakland, California on September 8, 2012, against &quot;The Ring&quot; and lineal light heavyweight champion Chad Dawson. The fight, billed as &quot;Ward vs. Dawson – World Champions – Made In America&quot; took place at 168 lbs for Ward&#x27;s super middleweight titles. Dawson was coming off a big win against future Hall of Famer Bernard Hopkins in April. At the press conference, he said that it was his desire to drop down in weight and challenge Ward rather than fight lesser-known opponents at light heavyweight. Dawson started his career at super middleweight, but hadn&#x27;t fought at the weight since February 2006.

The fight ended in round ten with a technical knockout victory for Ward when Dawson asked the referee for the fight to be ended with the words: &quot;It&#x27;s over. I&#x27;m finished. I&#x27;m done.&quot; In the first two rounds, Ward and Dawson felt each other out, with neither fighter having much success, though Dawson was able to land a few counter right hooks as Ward lunged inside. In the third round, Ward dropped Dawson with a left hook and dominated the round. Again in the fourth round, Ward was able to drop Dawson, in another dominating round. From fifth round until the end of the fight, Ward was able to neutralize Dawson&#x27;s jab and work rate, seemingly out boxing and frustrating Dawson throughout. Then, in the tenth round, Ward dropped Dawson to a knee after a solid combination, which prompted referee Steve Smoger to stop the fight after Dawson could not continue. At the time of stoppage, Ward was ahead 90–79, 89–80, and 89–80 on all three judges&#x27; scorecards. For the loss, Dawson earned $600,000, whilst Ward had a total $1,367,500 purse.

The fight was watched by an average 1.3 million viewers on HBO. In 2013, Dawson spoke out about the fight and said it was a &quot;set-up by HBO and other people.&quot; He claimed that it was done to make him look &quot;vulnerable and expose him with weight loss.&quot;

====Ward vs. Pavlik cancelled fight====
Ward was scheduled to defend his super middleweight titles against former unified middleweight champion Kelly Pavlik on January 26, 2013, at the Galen Center in Los Angeles. However, an injury sustained by Ward originally postponed the bout for 4 more weeks and the fight was expected to take place on February 23, 2013. The injury was more severe than originally thought and led to the cancellation of the fight as well as the subsequent retirement of Pavlik.

On March 23, 2013, the WBC stripped Ward of the WBC super-middleweight title belt for being inactive for a long period of time, and for failing to face a mandatory challenger. They granted him champion emeritus status. Ward claimed a shoulder injury that required surgery was the reason for his inactivity, but the WBC claimed that Ward had not provided any medical evidence or even given them a rough availability date.

On May 20, Ward relinquished the champion emeritus title, stating that he did not believe the WBC had the right to strip him of the world title because he was willing and able to defend it within the period specified by the WBC&#x27;s rules. Ward was praised for standing up to the WBC.

====Ward vs. Rodríguez====

Ward spent most of 2013 recovering from injuries, and feuding with promoter Dan Goossen, over the inclusion of a co-manager in Ward&#x27;s promotional contract. The case has been to court or arbitration on 3 separate occasions. Each time, Goossen was deemed in the right. Ward defended his WBA and Ring titles against unbeaten Edwin Rodríguez in Ontario, California in November 2013 with a wide unanimous decision. The fight started with rough tactics until Jack Reiss made an unprecedented move, penalizing both fighters two points each and warning them that he would end the fight if it did not clean up. Ward went on to dominate the rest of the fight. The three judges scored the fight 118–106, 117–107, and 116–108 all in favor of Ward.

Ward spent all of 2014 inactive, still feuding with Goossen. Dan Goossen died of complications from liver cancer in September 2014, leaving the future of Andre Ward&#x27;s boxing career even further in doubt.

On February 19, 2015 &quot;The Ring&quot; stripped Ward of the Ring champion belt due to him not having defended his title against a top #5 contender in the last two years.

====Ward vs. Smith====
In April 2015 Ward announced that he would make a ring return after a 19 month long lay off. Ward signed with Jay Z&#x27;s Roc Nation Sports in January 2015 and this was announced to be the first event under the Roc Nation banner. It was later confirmed that he would fight on June 20, against British Paul Smith (35–5, 20 KOs) at the Oracle Arena in California at a 172 lbs catchweight fight. The fight was to take place on BET. Roc Nation did reach out to HBO, where Ward had worked as an analyst previously, but upon hearing his opponent, they passed on the opportunity to showcase Ward&#x27;s long-awaited return. Ward won via TKO in the 9th round. Ward was winning every round at the time of stoppage 80–72 on all three judges&#x27; scorecards. Smith missed weight, coming in at 176.4 lbs and was fined 20% ($45,000) of his $225,000 purse by the California State Athletic Commission, half of which went to Ward and half to the commission. Despite being available in over 90 million homes, the fight averaged 323,000 viewers on BET.

On November 12, 2015, in advance of his upcoming move up to the light heavyweight division, Ward vacated his WBA super middleweight title. Ward originally claimed the belt in November 2009 with a victory over long-time champion Mikkel Kessler in his opening fight of the Super Six tournament.

===Light heavyweight===

====Ward vs. Barrera====
Boxing Scene reported In January 2016, Ward&#x27;s light heavyweight debut was set against Cuban boxer Sullivan Barrera (17–0, 12 KOs) at the Oracle Arena. on March 26, 2016, on HBO. Barrera was risking his IBF mandatory position in this fight. Barrera became the mandatory to Kovalev&#x27;s IBF title when he stopped German Karo Murat in December 2015. According to Ward, he wasn&#x27;t moving up in weight for the money, but rather daring to be great. 8,532 fans packed the arena on fight night. En route to a wide unanimous decision victory, Ward dropped Barrera to the canvas in the third round as he turned a left hook while on the ropes. Barrera was also dropped in the eighth round from a body shot, but referee Raul Caiz Sr. saw it as a low blow and as a result deducted a point from Ward. Ward dictated the pace for the vast majority of the bout, showcasing good strength and ring generalship against Barrera. The three judges scored the fight 117–109, 119–109, and 117–108. Ward landed 166 from 463 thrown (36%) whilst Barrera landed 111 of 722 punches thrown (15%). When asked about the potential mega fight against Kovalev, Ward said, &quot;It&#x27;s never a problem. You look at my track record. I want to fight the best. I&#x27;ve always fought the best. Sergey Kovalev, he&#x27;s a great champion.&quot; For the fight, Ward earned $1.85 million and Barrera earned a $450,000 purse. The fight averaged 1.064 million viewers and peaked at 1.152 million viewers.

====Ward vs. Brand====
On June 28, 2016, Roc Nation Sport confirmed that Ward would fight once more before his mega fight with Kovalev on July 30 against 39 year old Colombian boxer Alexander Brand (25–1, 19 KOs). The fight was to take place in Oakland, California at the Oracle Center. This was the eighth and final time Ward fought in his hometown. Brand entered the fight as a 100-1 underdog. In front of 8,653 hometown fans, Ward unanimously outpointed Brand to claim the vacant WBO International light heavyweight title. All three judges had the fight 120–108 for Ward. Brand, who looked as though he came to survive 12 rounds, didn&#x27;t initiate any action, which ultimately led him to lose all the rounds on the three scorecards. Ward looked slow in the victory, not looking like the same fighter he was in 2011. Ward dictated the fight however with a strong jab. This showed in round 7 when Brand&#x27;s right eye suddenly started to swollen up. Ward spoke to HBO in the post fight interview about fighting Kovalev next saying: &quot;I&#x27;m excited, I&#x27;m looking forward to it. I&#x27;ll see you in November.&quot; This was Ward&#x27;s third fight in eight months, after only fighting three times from 2012 to 2015. Ward landed 190 of 490 punches thrown (39%), and Brand landed 45 of 285 (16%). Ward earned a purse of $850,000 compared to the small amount of $30,000 earned by Brand. The fight averaged on 742,000 viewers on HBO. The dip could have been due to 21 million tuning in to the Olympics on NBC.

====Ward vs. Kovalev====

Ward fought the unified IBF, WBA (Super) and WBO light heavyweight champion Sergey Kovalev at the T-Mobile Arena on November 19, 2016. The fight was announced in June, with a rematch clause, and both fighters retained their undefeated records through interim bouts. This event marked Ward&#x27;s first time fighting in Las Vegas, Nevada.

After being knocked down in the second round, he won a controversial decision with all three judges scoring the fight 114–113 in favor of Ward. Ward reiterated how the events of the evening unfolded, &quot;I got off the canvas against the hardest puncher in the division and smiled. I took the fight to him and closed the show.&quot; Ward received Kovalev&#x27;s WBA (Super), IBF, and WBO light heavyweight titles and became a two-division world champion.

Boxing experts have claimed that the judging was unfair. &quot;It was a classic hometown decision. Kovalev won the fight&quot;, Larry Merchant stated after the fight. Kovalev&#x27;s promoter, Kathy Duva, said, &quot;We got a great fight, which is what boxing needed. But we also got a bad decision, which is not what boxing needed.&quot; On the same token, many boxing fans have applauded the decision. Paulie Malignaggi noted the high degree of difficulty both fighters faced that night and doubted the prospect of a one-sided affair in the case of a rematch. Still, he concluded that Kovalev faded late in the fight. Promoter Eddie Hearn added that Kovalev lacked a sense of urgency after the halfway point. Gennady Golovkin&#x27;s trainer, Abel Sanchez, scored the fight 114–112 for Kovalev. For the fight, Kovalev received a minimum purse of $2 million and Ward&#x27;s purse was a career-high $5 million. CompuBox stats showed that Kovalev landed more punches, 126 of 474 punches; Ward landed 116 out of 337 thrown

The fight reported to have done 160,000 buys on HBO PPV. A replay was shown on HBO prior to the Lomachenko–Walters title fight, which averaged 834,000 viewers. The event produced a live gate of $3.3 million from 10,066 tickets sold, including complimentary tickets, the full attendance was announced as 13,310. The venue was set up to hold 14,227.

====Ward vs. Kovalev II====

Kovalev&#x27;s manager Egis Klimas announced that negotiations had begun for the rematch between Ward and Kovalev. Ward threatened to retire if he didn&#x27;t get things &quot;his way&quot; for the rematch. According to the NSAC, The T-Mobile Arena was put on hold for June 17, 2017, on HBO PPV. On March 24, 2017, Kovalev revealed via Social Media that he had signed his end of the deal. It was also noted that the rematch would take place at the Mandalay Bay in Paradise, Nevada on HBO PPV. On April 4, Roc Nation Sports and Main Events confirmed that terms were agreed for the rematch to take place on HBO PPV. The fight was billed as &quot;No Excuses&quot;. Ward addressed the public by stating, &quot;I&#x27;m going to keep it short and sweet. You got what you asked for -- now you have to see me on June 17. This time leave the excuses at home.&quot; The Las Vegas Sun confirmed the bout will take place at the Mandalay Bay Events Center. On April 10, Kathy Duva said that there would be no rematch clause in place for a third fight, meaning whoever would win, would not be obliged to fight another rematch. The fight purses were revealed before the fight with Ward taking a guaranteed $6.5 million and Kovalev, not having a base purse, would receive a percentage of PPV and gate revenue.

In front of 10,592, the fight ended with controversy in the 8th round with a victory for Ward. A right hand from Ward had Kovalev in trouble, which was followed by several low blows. Tony Weeks stopped the fight, with Kovalev sitting on the middle rope, visibly hurt from the low blows he was subjected to. At the time of stoppage, two judges had Ward ahead 67–66, whilst the third judge had it 68–65 in favor of Kovalev. CompuBox stats showed that Ward landed 80 of 238 punches (34%) whilst Kovalev landed more punches with 95 of his 407 thrown (23%).

Ward praised Kovalev in the post-fight interview, &quot;He&#x27;s a good fighter, and I have nothing but respect for him. First time around, the man is world champion, and he&#x27;s been on top a long time. I give him credit. He is a great fighter, and when you fight great fighters, you have to raise your game.&quot; Kovalev said the fight could have continued and pointed to low blows, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe it, I could win,&quot; he said.&quot;Only a low blow (hurt me),&quot; he added, before watching video of the end of the fight and observing: &quot;Low blow - and I felt this. Again, another one. The first one was on the border, and the second one a low blow.&quot;

According to Yahoo! Sports, the fight only generated around 130,000 buys on HBO PPV. The replay was shown on regular HBO averaging 752,000 viewers and peaked at 947,000, which was during the final round. The event produced a live gate of $2,187,340 from 6,366 tickets sold, including complimentary tickets, the full attendance was announced as 10,592. The venue was set up to hold 10,748.

On August 23, 2017, Ward announced that his contract with HBO had expired, making him a free agent. He confirmed that he was still under contract with Roc Nation Sports, but rumours indicated that he could sign with Top Rank. His appearance as an analyst for the Crawford vs. Indongo fight sparked further rumours.

===Retirement===
On September 21, 2017, via his website, Ward announced his retirement from boxing at the age of 33. In a statement, he said, &quot;I want to be clear – I am leaving because my body can no longer put up with the rigors of the sport and therefore my desire to fight is no longer there. If I cannot give my family, my team, and the fans everything that I have, then I should no longer be fighting.&quot; Also in the statement read, &quot;As I walk away from the sport of boxing today, I leave at the top of your glorious mountain, which was always my vision and my dream. I did it. We did it. From the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone who has played a part in my journey. You know who you are. I could not have done this without you.&quot; Ward ended his career undefeated with 32 wins, 16 of which came inside the distance.

On December 15, 2020, Ward was announced as being inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2021, his first year of eligibility.

==Fighting style==
His trainer, Virgil Hunter, says Ward harnesses his speed and ring intelligence to control distance and pace in fights while maintaining high punch accuracy and counterpunching skills. A natural left-handed fighter who boxes in an orthodox stance, Ward&#x27;s best punches typically come from the lead left, including a sharp, piston-like jab, which he shoots to the body as well as the head. An injury and eventual surgery to the right shoulder has made Ward even more reliant on the left hand, causing him to even switch to southpaw on occasion to land his power punches. Connecting with his own punches, particularly the short left hook and uppercut, while clinching, weaving and smothering his opponent&#x27;s punches is commonplace in Ward fights. He attributes his self-described &quot;formless&quot; style to years of studying Roy Jones Jr., Bernard Hopkins, and Floyd Mayweather Jr. Ward also makes effective use of the jab to the body while out of punching range. In an article, which appeared at FoxSports.com, boxing writer Zachary Alapi speculates that Ward is one of the best in-fighters in boxing, being &quot;merciless when it comes to wrestling in the clinch while simultaneously throwing punches to prevent a break, Ward is also willing to fight dirty if he has to.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 2009, Ward married his high school sweetheart Tiffiney, with whom he has four sons and a daughter. Ward lives in Danville, California.

<text>129 (one hundred [and] twenty-nine) is the natural number following 128 and preceding 130.

==In mathematics==
129 is the sum of the first ten prime numbers. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as a sum of three squares in four different ways: formula_1, formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4.

129 is the product of only two primes, 3 and 43, making 129 a semiprime. Since 3 and 43 are both Gaussian primes, this means that 129 is a Blum integer.

<text>Claudine Longet (born January 29, 1942) is a Franco-American singer, actress, dancer, and recording artist popular during the 1960s and 1970s.

Born in Paris, France, Longet was married to American singer and television entertainer Andy Williams from 1961 until 1975. She has maintained a private profile since 1977, following her conviction for negligent homicide in connection with the shooting death of her boyfriend, former Olympic skier Spider Sabich.

==Career==

Her first appearances as an actress on TV were in two 1963 episodes of &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;. She acted in the 1964 theatrical feature film of the same title. Many of her acting roles during the 1960s were in episodes of TV adventure series that included &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, &quot;The Rat Patrol&quot;, &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, and &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;. Longet was cast as Sharhri Javid in the 1965 episode &quot;The Silent Dissuaders&quot; of the NBC education drama series, &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;, starring James Franciscus.

She appeared many times on &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; series and specials. She occasionally appeared as a singer on other variety and music programs, including those of singers Bobby Darin and Tom Jones. Williams described Longet as &quot;a beautiful, athletic, slender, petite brunette with large doe eyes--my favorite French singer.&quot;

Her career breakthrough occurred in 1966. She guest-starred in the season-one finale of the series &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; starring Ben Gazzara. In the episode &quot;The Sadness of a Happy Time&quot;, she performed her English-French bilingual rendition of Antônio Carlos Jobim&#x27;s &quot;bossa nova&quot; song &quot;Meditation&quot; (&quot;Meditação&quot;). The episode was broadcast on 16 May 1966.

A&amp;M Records cofounder Herb Alpert was among the viewers whom Longet charmed with her performance of &quot;Meditation&quot;. When Alpert met Longet at a club in New Orleans in 1966, he offered her a recording contract with his company. Longet recorded singles, and five albums, for A&amp;M Records between 1966 and 1970.

&quot;Meditation&quot; was Longet&#x27;s first single release for A&amp;M. Other Jobim compositions that she has recorded include &quot;A Felicidade,&quot; &quot;How Insensitive&quot; (&quot;Insensatez&quot;), and &quot;Dindi&quot;.

In 1968, Longet co-starred with Peter Sellers in &quot;The Party&quot;, a box-office hit that Blake Edwards wrote, produced, and directed. Longet sang the Henry Mancini and Don Black song &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; in the film.

In 1971, she joined Williams&#x27;s Barnaby Records label. She released singles and two albums for Barnaby: &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot; in 1971 and &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; in 1972. She also recorded songs for a projected third album for Barnaby that went unreleased. Many of the songs for the planned third album appeared on the 1993 CD titled &quot;Sugar Me&quot;, after the Lynsey de Paul song that Longet recorded in the early 1970s, but the masters for some of the other songs are missing and presumed lost.

In 1975, she appeared as the Flower (a non-singing role) on the children&#x27;s album &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, based on the novel by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Album for Children in 1976.

She has enjoyed success on the music popularity charts. Her 1967 debut album, &quot;Claudine&quot;, peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop albums chart in the US. &quot;Claudine&quot; became a RIAA-certified gold album, selling more than 500,000 copies. Subsequent albums &quot;The Look of Love&quot; peaked at number 33 in 1967 and &quot;Love Is Blue&quot; peaked at number 29 in 1968 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop albums chart in the U.S.

Longet&#x27;s musical cohort on her charting albums was arranger Nick DeCaro. He also arranged her other two albums on A&amp;M, &quot;Colours&quot; (1968) and &quot;Run Wild, Run Free&quot; (1970), as well as &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot; (1971) on Barnaby.

She had hit singles in America on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. Her charting singles include her version of &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; (music and lyrics by John Lennon and Paul McCartney), &quot;Hello, Hello&quot; (composed by Terry MacNeil and Peter Kraemer), &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; (composed by John Lennon and Paul McCartney), &quot;Small Talk&quot; (music and lyrics by Garry Bonner and Alan Gordon), and &quot;Love is Blue&quot;, a 1967 Eurovision Song Contest entry that gained fourth place (music by André Popp and French lyrics by Pierre Cour). Another song, &quot;Wanderlove&quot; (music and lyrics by Mason Williams), went to number seven on the singles charts in Singapore. She remains popular in Japan, where all of her original albums were reissued on CD.

==Marriage to Andy Williams==

Longet and Williams met in Las Vegas in 1960 while she was dancing lead in the Folies Bergère revue at the Tropicana Resort &amp; Casino. Longet was having trouble with her car and had pulled over to the side of the road. Driving by, Williams stopped to offer assistance. She was 18 and he was 32. They married on 15 December 1961 in Los Angeles and had three children: Noëlle (born on 24 September 1963), Christian (born on 15 April 1965), and Robert (&quot;Bobby&quot;) (born on 1 August 1969). They legally separated in 1970 and divorced in January 1975. According to Williams, they remained &quot;very good friends.&quot;

==Friendship with Robert F. and Ethel Kennedy==
Longet and Andy Williams were close friends of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and his wife, Ethel Kennedy. During the mid-1960s, the couple hosted the Kennedys at their residences in Bel Air, California, and Palm Springs, California, and spent time at the Kennedy residences at Hickory Hill and New York City. They took summer cruises together on the Salmon River in central Idaho and on the Colorado River.

On or before 4 June 1968, the day of the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primary in California, Kennedy—a contending Democratic presidential candidate—and his wife made tentative arrangements with Williams and Longet to visit Los Angeles&#x27;s The Factory nightclub. According to Williams, Robert Kennedy told them that he would make a hand signal at the conclusion of his televised speech at the Ambassador Hotel to confirm their get-together.

Shortly after midnight on 5 June, Longet and Williams were watching Senator Kennedy&#x27;s televised primary victory speech in Kennedy&#x27;s suite at The Ambassador. When Williams rushed down to the hotel ballroom, he heard loud noises in the hallway and learned that Kennedy had been shot. Longet and Williams eventually joined Kennedy&#x27;s family and friends at Good Samaritan Hospital, where doctors labored to save the senator&#x27;s life. They stayed at the hospital for 24 hours.

Longet and Williams attended Kennedy&#x27;s funeral at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City on 8 June. A television camera captured Williams consoling a sobbing Longet during the mass. After Kennedy&#x27;s brother Edward M. &quot;Ted&quot; Kennedy delivered a brief and emotional eulogy, Williams and a choir sang &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;. After the funeral mass, Longet and Williams accompanied Ethel Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, and other Kennedy family members on the 21-car funeral train that took Senator Kennedy&#x27;s body to Washington, D.C., and Arlington National Cemetery for burial. The front page of the 9 June 1968 edition of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; featured a large photograph of Ted Kennedy and Longet standing together on the rear platform as the train passed through North Philadelphia.

Longet and Williams named their son Robert (born in August 1969) after Robert F. Kennedy.

==Arrest and trial==
Longet was arrested and charged with fatally shooting her boyfriend, Olympic skier Vladimir &quot;Spider&quot; Sabich, at his home in Aspen, Colorado, on 21 March 1976. At her trial, Longet claimed the gun accidentally discharged as Sabich was showing her how it worked. Williams publicly supported Longet throughout the trial, paid for her legal defense team, and escorted her to and from the courthouse. Asked later about his unwavering support of his ex-wife, Williams said, &quot;She is the mother of my children and we never stopped being friends. We just didn&#x27;t want to be married anymore.&quot;

The Pitkin County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and 9th Colorado Judicial district&#x27;s investigative office made two procedural errors that aided Longet&#x27;s defense: They took a blood sample from her without first obtaining a warrant, and they seized her diary without a warrant. According to prosecutors, the sample showed the presence of cocaine in her blood, and her diary reportedly contradicted her claim that her relationship with Sabich had not soured. To further muddle the prosecution&#x27;s case, the gun was mishandled by weapons non-experts. As they were unable to cite any of the disallowed material, prosecutors used the autopsy report to suggest that when Sabich was shot, he was bent over, facing away, and at least 1.80 m (5&#x27;11&quot;) from Longet, which would be inconsistent with the position and relative distance of someone who is demonstrating the operation of a firearm.

The jury convicted her of negligent homicide and sentenced her to pay a small fine and spend 30 days in jail. The trial judge, George E. Lohr, allowed Longet to choose the days to be served, believing this arrangement would allow her to spend time with her children. She decided to serve most of her sentence on weekends. Critical reaction to the verdict and sentencing was exacerbated when she subsequently vacationed with her defense attorney, Ronald D. Austin, who was married then. Longet and Austin later married. , they still live in Aspen.

After the criminal trial, the Sabich family initiated civil proceedings to sue Longet. The case eventually was resolved out of court, with the provision that Longet never discuss or write about the killing or the settlement.

===In music===
*In 1980, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards wrote a song about Spider Sabich&#x27;s death that was intended to be on the Rolling Stones album &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot;. The song, titled &quot;Claudine&quot;, had lyrics that painted a graphic picture of some of the more salacious aspects of the affair and killing. It was deemed too controversial and was removed, although it was included on several bootleg Rolling Stones albums. In November 2011, the track &quot;Claudine&quot; was released on the deluxe reissue of their album &quot;Some Girls&quot;.
*The Geraldine Fibbers recorded a song called &quot;Claudine&quot; on their 1997 album &quot;Butch&quot;. Although an instrumental, the credits show vocals courtesy of Spider Sabich Memorial Choir.

===In television===

Longet&#x27;s attorneys wrote a cease-and-desist letter to Lorne Michaels and an apology was given in the next week&#x27;s show.
*2001: &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; episode 1.12, &quot;Double Date&quot; (January 18, 2001), references Longet in a conversation between Rory, Lane, and Lorelai while her music plays in the background.
*2003: &quot;City Confidential&quot; episode 4.13, &quot;Aspen: Murder on the Slopes&quot; (29 July 2003), featured the city of Aspen and the case.

<doc id="1040688" wikidata="Q779217" url="?curid=1040688" title="Marcus Caelius Rufus">
<text>Marcus Caelius Rufus (died 48 BC) was an orator and politician in the late Roman Republic. He was born into a wealthy equestrian family from Interamnia Praetuttiorum, on the central east coast of Italy. He is best known for his prosecution of Gaius Antonius Hybrida in 59 BC. He was also known for his trial for public violence (&quot;de vi publica&quot;) in March 56 BC, when Cicero defended him in the extant speech &quot;Pro Caelio&quot;, and as both recipient and author of some of the best-written letters in the &quot;ad Familiares&quot; corpus of Cicero&#x27;s extant correspondence (Book 8). He may be the Rufus named in the poems of Catullus.

==Life and career==
In his twenties, Caelius became associated with Crassus and Cicero, while he was also briefly connected to Catiline and his conspiracy. Caelius first achieved fame through his successful prosecution in 59 BC of Gaius Antonius Hybrida for corruption. Antonius Hybrida had served as consul with Cicero for the year 63 BC, and his prosecution was a sign of the negative political atmosphere towards Cicero at the time. A year later, in 58 BC, Cicero was exiled, through the efforts of his political enemy Publius Clodius Pulcher. Cicero was recalled from exile in 57 BC with the help of his ally Titus Annius Milo, who was tribune at the time.

Sometime around 57 BC, Caelius and Clodia are believed to have had an affair which ended acrimoniously. In 56 BC, Caelius was prosecuted for &quot;vis&quot; (violence), specifically for murdering an ambassador. He was successfully defended by Crassus and, more famously, Cicero, whose speech &quot;Pro Caelio&quot; argued that the prosecutor, Atratinus, was being manipulated by Clodia to get revenge on Caelius for an affair gone wrong.

Caelius was tribune of the &quot;plebs&quot; in 52 BC and curule aedile in 50 BC. During this period, he wrote a series of witty and informative letters to Cicero, who was serving as proconsul of Cilicia at the time. After much hesitation, Caelius sided with Julius Caesar against Pompey in the civil war, warning Cicero accordingly not to align his fortunes with Pompey: in 48 BC, he was rewarded with the office of &quot;praetor peregrinus&quot; (“judge of suits involving foreigners”). However, when his proposed program of debt relief was opposed by the Senate and he was suspended from office, he joined in a rebellion against Caesar which was quickly crushed. It was during this rebellion that Caelius was killed.

==In Catullus==
Caelius may appear in the poetry of Catullus under his cognomen &quot;Rufus&quot;. Rufus in Carmen 69 and 77 as suggested by Riese to be Caelius, rejected by Robinson Ellis. Catullus writes about a former friend named Rufus who betrayed him in an unspecified way, perhaps referring to the affair with Clodia (usually identified with the loved then reviled &quot;Lesbia&quot; of Catullus&#x27;s poetry), the alleged attempt of Caelius to poison her, or subsequent attacks on her through Cicero (see pro Caelio). Catullus lambastes this Rufus in an epigram that ends:
&lt;poem&gt;You ripped it away, alas, alas cruel poison of our life&lt;br&gt;alas, alas destroyer of our friendship.&lt;/poem&gt;

In &quot;Caelius&quot; in 58, Catullus seems to expect a sympathetic ear as he bewails Lesbia&#x27;s sexual profligacy; the former is an invective that taunts &quot;Rufus&quot; for bodily offensiveness that drives away women.

==In imperial historiography==
A flamboyant, witty, ambitious and quarrelsome character, Caelius attracted much attention from the minor historian Velleius Paterculus in the following century.

==In popular culture==
* Marcus Caelius Rufus appears in multiple books in the Steven Saylor&#x27;s Roma Sub Rosa series of historical novels set during the fall of the Roman Republic. 
* Rufus features prominently in the Cicero novels by British novelist Robert Harris.

<text>Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski (born 1946) is an American philosopher. She is the Emerita George Lynn Cross Research Professor, as well as Emerita Kingfisher College Chair of the Philosophy of Religion and Ethics, at the University of Oklahoma. She writes in the areas of epistemology, philosophy of religion, and virtue theory.

== Education and career ==
Zagzebski received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University, her Master of Arts degree from University of California, Berkeley, and her Doctor of Philosophy degree from University of California, Los Angeles in 1979 with a dissertation on &quot;Natural Kinds&quot; under the supervision of Tyler Burge. She taught at Loyola Marymount University from 1979 to 1999, before joining the University of Oklahoma.

She delivered the Wilde Lectures in Natural Religion at Oxford University in the spring of 2010 on epistemic authority. She was (2015–2016) president of the American Philosophical Association Central Division, and gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of St. Andrews in the fall of 2015 on the topic of exemplarist virtue theory. She is past president of the American Catholic Philosophical Association (1997–1998), and past president of the Society of Christian Philosophers (2004–2007).

In 2022, she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.

==Philosophical work==

Her research in recent years has consisted of topics such as the intersection of ethics and epistemology, religious epistemology, religious ethics, virtue theory, and the varieties of fatalism. She delivered the Wilde Lectures in Natural Religion at Oxford University in the spring of 2010 on epistemic authority. She is (2015–2016) president of the American Philosophical Association Central Division, and gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of St. Andrews in the fall of 2015 on the topic of exemplarist virtue theory. She is past president of the American Catholic Philosophical Association (1997–1998), and past president of the Society of Christian Philosophers (2004–2007).

=== Epistemology ===
Zagzebski is a pioneer in the field of virtue epistemology. In &quot;Virtues of the Mind&quot; (1996), she sets out to solve certain problems in modern epistemology by developing an Aristotelian version of virtue theory, and in the course of this project she lays out a general analysis of virtue. In &quot;Divine Motivation Theory&quot; (2004) she deals extensively with problems in the relationship between reason, faith, and ethics.

She has done work on questions of epistemic value including the &quot;espresso machine&quot; thought experiment (a predecessor to the swamping problem) as a counter to reliabilism.

In her book, &quot;Epistemic Authority: A Theory of Trust, Authority, and Autonomy in Belief&quot; (2012), she defends a strong sense of epistemic authority including authority in moral and religious beliefs, and argues that belief on authority is a requirement of intellectual autonomy. This book arose out of her 2010 Wilde lectures at Oxford.

In the paper titled &quot;The Inescapability of Gettier Problems&quot;, Zagzebski argued that any modification of the last condition given in the Plato&#x27;s definition of knowledge as justified true belief (JTB) unavoidably shall be reconducted to the unsolved case of the Gettier problem. This result is also true and valuable for any additional condition applied to the JTB.

In 1996, Zagzebski defined knowledge as a &quot;state of true belief arising out of acts of intellectual virtue&quot;, where the word &#x27;true&#x27; can be omitted.

According to the Aristotelian virtue theory, she defined virtue as a &quot;deep and enduring acquired excellence of a person, involving a characteristic motivation to produce a certain desired end and reliable success in bringing about that end.&quot; Denying innatism, she believes virtue is disposition plus ability and the universal human capability of achieving a good life and happiness. Moral and intellectual virtues can&#x27;t be separated and, more particularly, knowledge is obtained from practicing intellectual virtues like responsibility, fairness, and courage. True belief -in the forms of propositional knowledge and of cognitive contact with reality- are gained by a right disposition of the intellect to desire truth, and a good practice which sews the intellectual virtues on the personhood, like a new habit of the body. People who are rightly motivated to know the truth are also capable to develop specific skills, build up and assess the reliability of personal and well-formed procedures, rather than doing the same for good belief-forming processes shared between peers.

<doc id="1040696" wikidata="Q942138" url="?curid=1040696" title="Rubellius Plautus">
<text>Rubellius Plautus (33–62 AD) was a Roman noble and a political rival of Emperor Nero. Through his mother Julia, he was a relative of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. He was the grandson of Drusus (only son of Tiberius Caesar), and the great-grandson of Tiberius and his brother Drusus. Through his great-grandmothers Vipsania Agrippina and Antonia Minor, he was also descended from Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Mark Antony. He was descended from Augustus&#x27; sister Octavia Minor, herself a grand-niece of Julius Caesar.

==Parentage==
Plautus&#x27; father was Gaius Rubellius Blandus. Blandus&#x27; family originated from Tibur (modern &quot;Tivoli&quot;) and were of the Equestrian Class. His father died in 38. His mother was the only daughter of Drusus, and had previously been married to her cousin Nero Julius Caesar, without issue. Plautus derived his cognomen from his great grandfather Lucius Sergius Plautus, and may have used his nomen gentilicium &quot;Sergius&quot; as his own praenomen as a lead pipe is attested with the name &quot;Sergius Rubellius Plautus&quot;, but this person may have been his son.

Between 43 and 45, his mother Julia became an innocent victim to the intrigues of Empress Valeria Messalina. One possibility is that the young Plautus was seen by Messalina as a rival to her son Britannicus. Emperor Claudius (who was husband to Messalina, father to Brittanicus and maternal uncle to Julia) did not secure any legal defense for his niece. Consequently, Julia was executed. However Julia was considered to be a virtuous person by those who knew her.

==Marriage==
Plautus married Antistia Pollitta, daughter to Lucius Antistius Vetus. His father-in-law served as Consul in 55, Legatus of Germania Superior in 55–56, and Proconsul of Asia in 64–65. Plautus was considered a loving husband and father. The names of his children, however, are not known. (None of them survived Nero&#x27;s purges in 66).

==Philosophy==
Plautus appears to have been a follower of Stoicism. According to Tacitus, Tigellinus wrote to Nero: &quot;Plautus again, with his great wealth, does not so much as affect a love of repose, but he flaunts before us his imitations of the old Romans, and assumes the self-consciousness of the Stoics along with a philosophy, which makes men restless, and eager for a busy life.&quot; When he was exiled from Rome by Nero, Plautus was accompanied by the famous Stoic teacher Musonius Rufus. He was associated with a group of Stoics who criticized the perceived tyranny and autocratic rule of certain emperors, referred to today as the Stoic Opposition.

==Nero&#x27;s jealousy==
In 55, Junia Silana, sister of Caligula&#x27;s first wife Junia Claudilla, a rival of Empress Agrippina the Younger and the ex-wife of Messalina&#x27;s lover Gaius Silius, accused Agrippina of plotting to overthrow Nero to place Plautus on the throne. Nero took no action at the time, but over time, Nero&#x27;s relationship with Silana warmed while his relationship with his mother soured. After a comet appeared in 60, public gossip renewed rumors of Nero&#x27;s fall and Plautus&#x27; rise. Nero exiled Plautus in 60 to his estate in Asia with his family.

In 62, after rumors that Plautus was in negotiations with the eastern general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo over rebellion, Plautus was executed by Nero. When his head was given to Nero by a freedman, Nero mocked how frightening the long nose of Plautus was.

In 66, his widow, children and father-in-law were executed, victims of the increasing brutality of Nero. Tacitus states Plautus was old fashioned in tastes, his bearing austere and he lived a secluded life. He was greatly respected by his peers, and the execution of his family was cause for consternation among those who knew him.

<doc id="1040698" wikidata="Q7491272" url="?curid=1040698" title="Shawlands">
<text>Shawlands () is a Southside suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, located two miles south of the River Clyde. The area, considered the &quot;Heart of the Southside&quot;, is known for its independent restaurants and cafés, art scene, public parks, period terraces, and red and blond sandstone tenements. Shawlands was named one of the best places to live in Scotland in 2022 and 2023 by The Sunday Times, and one of the world&#x27;s coolest neighbourhoods by Time Out Magazine with judges describing it as &quot;the city&#x27;s best area to live and socialise”. It is located between Pollok Country Park – the home of the Burrell Collection and Pollok House – and the acclaimed Victorian park Queen&#x27;s Park. 

==History==
Shawlands grew rapidly during the 19th Century as Glasgow boomed during its time as the commercial powerhouse of the British Empire. Over time, the number of inhabitants in this largely artisanal and industrial area doubled due to the formation of significant local businesses, such as the Camphill Bakery, which opened in 1847. Following their rapid development, the villages of Shawlands (1819) and Cathcart (1912), which included the Crossmyloof parts of today&#x27;s Shawlands Cross Conservation Area, were absorbed into Glasgow during the city’s southward extension, having previously been within the Eastwood parish in Renfrewshire. 

With improving transport infrastructure and the expansion of Glasgow southwards in this period, Shawlands developed into an important commercial centre for that sector of the city. Neighbouring districts include the areas of Giffnock, Auldhouse, Crossmyloof, Strathbungo, Langside, Newlands, and Pollokshaws, with Shawlands itself overlapping two Council wards (Pollokshields and Langside) and two Scottish Parliament constituencies (Glasgow Cathcart and Glasgow Southside).

==Cultural heritage==


Within walking distance of Shawlands is Queens Park, acquired in 1857 and designed by the world-renowned Sir Joseph Paxton, also responsible for noted public parks in London, Liverpool, Birkenhead and the grounds of the Spa Buildings at Scarborough. The park was dedicated to the memory of Mary, Queen of Scots and not Queen Victoria, a common misconception given the proximity to Victoria Road. The park is steeped in history and was the site of the 16th century Battle of Langside.

The park also has allotments, a botanical glass house, public tennis courts, a public golf course, children&#x27;s play areas, a boating pond and views of Glasgow. The refurbished amphitheatre holds open-air performances of Shakespeare and children&#x27;s plays during summer. The park holds the annual Southside Festival, and the Wee Chill Music Festival. 

The Langside Halls, a Category A listed building, stands on the corner of Queens Park, opposite the Corona Bar. The building was originally built for the National Bank of Scotland in Queen Street, and was resituated in 1901-3, to meet an evident need for a public hall on the southside. For many years, a drinking fountain constructed by the Saracen Foundry stood in front of the Halls, but was relocated to Glasgow Green.

On the other side of Shawlands is Pollok Country Park, one of Glasgow&#x27;s most celebrated green spaces and home to Pollok House and the Burrell Collection. The park is Glasgow&#x27;s largest park and the only Country Park within Glasgow. Its extensive woodlands and gardens provide a quiet sanctuary for both visitors and wildlife. The park is rich in rural history formerly being part of the Old Pollok Estate and ancestral home to the Maxwell Family. Pollok Country Park has been successful in achieving a Green Flag Award in 2016. This has been retained every year since 2012. The Green Flag Award is the benchmark national standard for quality parks and green spaces. 

==Education==
Shawlands Primary School has an approximate capacity of over 600 pupils and is part of the &#x27;Shawlands New Learning Community&#x27; (which also includes Annette St Primary, Battlefield Primary, Blackfriars Primary, Cuthbertson Primary and Langside Primary) feeding to the non denominational secondary school in the area, Shawlands Academy, which has an approximate capacity of over 1,200 pupils. The school has just undergone an extensive renovation which has seen it transformed into Glasgow’s specialist languages centre; the &quot;Glasgow International School&quot;, the first of its kind in Scotland, also houses the bilingual Support Unit. It is estimated that over 50 languages are currently spoken by the school&#x27;s pupils, representing the diverse multicultural pupil population.

Also in Shawlands is St. Conval&#x27;s Primary, a Roman Catholic School situated on Shawhill Road; St. Conval&#x27;s is part of the Learning Community for Holyrood R.C. Secondary School situated in the Crosshill area.

==Sport==
Future Fitness, located on Kilmarnock Road, provides gym and aerobic exercise classes, alongside PureGym Shawlands Arcade. The area is also home to Shawlands bowling club and Pro Judo, the largest judo club in the West of Scotland. Hampden Park, Scotland&#x27;s national football stadium is located less than from Shawlands Cross. Also just south of Shawlands is Newlandsfield Park, home of Pollok FC.

==Transport==
Shawlands has close links to the M77 and M8 motorways (accessing at Dumbreck Road). Shawlands has two main roads which converge at Shawlands Cross: Kilmarnock Road and Pollokshaws Road. At the cross, the designation of the A77 road changes to Kilmarnock Road running south, with Pollokshaws Road continuing south-west as a more minor route. Bus services (the majority operated by First Glasgow) in the area are frequent, running from Glasgow city centre 24 hours a day.

<text>Donald Gilbert Cook (August 9, 1934 – December 8, 1967) was a United States Marine Corps officer and a Medal of Honor recipient.

==Biography==
Donald Cook was born in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Xavier High School in New York City and St. Michael&#x27;s College in Vermont. In 1956 he enlisted in the Marine Corps as a private but was quickly sent for officer training at the Officer Candidates School in Quantico, Virginia. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1957. In 1960 he attended Army Language School in Monterey, California, studying Chinese and graduated near the top of his class. Lieutenant Cook was assigned to Camp H.M. Smith, Hawaii, in 1961 and was promoted to captain on March 1, 1962. He held a series of assignments in the Marine Corps and was sent to South Vietnam in late 1964, where he served as an advisor to the Vietnamese Marine Division until he was wounded and captured by the Viet Cong several weeks later. He was held as a prisoner of war by the Viet Cong from December 31, 1964, until his death from malaria at age 33 on December 8, 1967, and was buried in the jungle by his fellow prisoners. He was posthumously promoted from captain to colonel. On February 26, 1980, he was officially declared dead and the Medal of Honor was presented to his wife by the Secretary of the Navy.

Cook&#x27;s body was never recovered. An official memorial stone (cenotaph) can be found in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia, Memorial Section MI Lot 110.

<doc id="1040719" wikidata="Q7939390" url="?curid=1040719" title="Vogeltown, Wellington">
<text>Vogeltown is a hillside suburb of Wellington, New Zealand, on the eastern slopes of Brooklyn and overlooking Newtown. It is sometimes considered part of Mornington. 

In later Maori times parts of the area now occupied by Vogeltown and eastern Brooklyn were used for cultivation by the Te Aro hapu (sub-tribe) of the Te Atiawa, the dominant tribe in the region. In European times the area became known as the Omaroro cultivation area, and control and ownership remained with Te Aro. The area primarily used for cultivation were located north of Pearce Street on what is now part of Wellington&#x27;s Town Belt and this area is a protected site under the Town Belt Management Plan and the Wellington District Plan.

There is no record of alienation of the land from the original owners until 25 March 1859, when the Te Aro people led by Mohi Ngaponga leased the section to one John H E Wright for 14 years at £30 per annum. At the end of this lease in 1873 Wright purchased the freehold for £700. This land has since developed into the suburb of Vogeltown.

At the council review of suburb boundaries in the early 21st century, Vogeltown nearly suffered absorption into adjacent suburbs.

The name Vogeltown derives from Sir Julius Vogel, author, entrepreneur, and premier of New Zealand from April 1873 until July 1875. In 1867, Vogel married Mary Clayton, daughter of architect Sir William Clayton, who gifted the couple Finnimore House. This house is still located at the corner of Finnimore Terrace and Dransfield Road, past the top of Hutchison Road in Vogeltown. The estate has been subdivided several times.

Many of the houses built in Vogeltown date from the 1920s.

==Demographics==
Vogeltown is part of the Kingston-Mornington-Vogeltown statistical area.

The 2013 census population was 2,004 for Vogeltown.

<text>Sultan Sir Abu Bakar Al-Khalil Ibrahim Shah ibni Almarhum Maharaja Tun Daeng Ibrahim (Jawi: ; 3 February 1833 – 4 June 1895) was the Temenggong of Johor. He was the 1st sultan of modern Johor, the 21st Sultan of Johor and the first Maharaja of Johor from the House of Temenggong. He was also informally known as &quot;The Father of Modern Johor&quot;, as many historians accredited Johor&#x27;s development in the 19th century to Abu Bakar&#x27;s leadership. He initiated policies and provided aids to ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs to stimulate the development of the state&#x27;s agricultural economy which was founded by Chinese migrants from southern China in the 1840s. He also took charge of the development of Johor&#x27;s infrastructure, administrative system, military and civil service, all of which were modelled closely along Western lines.

Abu Bakar was noted for his diplomatic skills, and both the British and Malay rulers had approached him for advice in making important decisions. He was also an avid traveller, and became the first Malay ruler to travel to Europe during his first visit to England in 1866. In particular, Abu Bakar became a lifetime friend of Queen Victoria in his later years. Abu Bakar&#x27;s friendship with Queen Victoria played an important role in shaping Johor&#x27;s relationships with Britain, and was the only state by the end of the 19th century in the Peninsular Malaya to maintain autonomy in its internal affairs as the British Colonial Government pushed for greater control over the Malay states by placing a British Resident in the states. He was also an Anglophile, and many of his personal habits and decisions were aligned to European ideas and tastes.

Abu Bakar became the sovereign ruler of Johor when his father, Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim died in 1862. Six years later, Abu Bakar changed his legal state title of &quot;Temenggong&quot; to &quot;Maharaja&quot;. In 1885, Abu Bakar sought legal recognition from Britain for another change in his legal state title of &quot;Maharaja&quot; to a regal title of &quot;Sultan&quot;, and was proclaimed the following year. In all, Abu Bakar&#x27;s reign lasted for 32 years until his death in 1895.

==Early years==
Wan Abu Bakar was born on 3 February 1833 in the Istana Lama in Teluk Belanga, Singapore. He was the eldest son of Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim and a patrilineal descendant of Temenggong Abdul Rahman who was in turn a matrilineal descendant of Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah IV, the first Sultan of Johor&#x27;s Bendahara dynasty. Abu Bakar spent his childhood years in his father&#x27;s kampung in Teluk Blanga; at a young age he was tutored by local teachers on Islam and Adat (traditional Malay law), before he was sent to the Teluk Blanga Malay school, a mission school run by Reverend Benjamin Peach Keasberry. Under the guidance of the missionary teachers, Abu Bakar was observed to develop the manners of an English gentleman, and the ability to speak fluent English in addition to his native Malay.

In 1851, the Temenggong delegated Abu Bakar, then eighteen-years-old, to assist him in negotiation efforts against Sultan Ali Iskandar, who was making attempts to claim sovereignty rights over Johor. As the Temenggong aged, he gradually delegated his state administrative duties to Abu Bakar. During this period, several British officers praised of Abu Bakar&#x27;s excellent diplomatic skills, as mentioned in William Napier&#x27;s diaries, who was the senior law agent of Singapore. Napier had accompanied Abu Bakar to fetch Tengku Teh, the mother of the deposed Sultan of Lingga, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah, to Johor shortly after her son began to exert sovereignty claims over Pahang.

The outbreak of the Pahang Civil War the following year saw Abu Bakar befriending Tun Mutahir, to whom he provided support for his war efforts. Abu Bakar married Mutahir&#x27;s daughter in 1860 during a visit in Pahang, and the following year he signed a treaty of friendship, alliance and a guarantee of mutual support with Mutahir. Meanwhile, Temenggong Ibrahim was already suffering from a prolonged period of ill health, and a bout of high fever resulted in his death on 31 January 1862.

==Administration of Johor==
===Temenggong (1862–1868)===
Abu Bakar assumed office as the Temenggong of Johor within three days of his father&#x27;s death and moved his residence to Tyersall. At the time of his succession, Johor was facing a political threat from the deposed sultan, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah. The Sultan was pursuing his sovereignty claims over Johor and Pahang and aimed to overthrow the Sultan of Terengganu with the backing of Siam. Mahmud Muzaffar Shah established an alliance with Tun Ahmad, half-brother and rival of the Bendahara Tun Koris. The alliance caused Abu Bakar concern that the fall of Tun Koris in Pahang would threaten his own political position in Johor. Abu Bakar signed a treaty of friendship with Tun Koris in June 1862, and sent a small expeditionary force to Pahang to support Tun Koris when war broke out in August 1862.

During the first two years of his reign, Abu Bakar expanded the Kangchu system pioneered by Daeng Ibrahim. He issued Western-style contracts (termed as &quot;Surat Sungai&quot; in Malay, literally &quot;River Documents&quot;) to the Kapitan Cina (Chinese leaders) who had established riverside plantations along the Johor River. Letters of authority (&quot;Surat Kuasa&quot;) were issued when the first Chinese leaders began settling in Johor during the 1850s. Abu Bakar quickly established good relations with the Kapitan Cina; a Malay administrator who could speak the Teochew Min (the language spoken by most Kapitan Cina) and read Chinese was employed for these purposes. He also employed the service of a Chinese contractor from Toisan, Wong Ah Fook, to oversee the construction of the Istana Besar.

Various Chinese dialect groups began to compete for commercial interests in the 1850s and 1860s. This led to communal violence. Abu Bakar and the Kapitan Cina in Johor (who were mainly migrants from Chaozhou) tried to assimilate Chinese entrepreneurs of non-Teochew origin. Abu Bakar gave official recognition and support for the Johor branch of the Ngee Ann Kongsi, which was seen as a secret society in Singapore at that time. As Johor prospered from the large revenue generated from the gambier and pepper plantations managed by the Kapitan Cina, Abu Bakar gave generous provisions to the Kapitan Cina in recognition for their contributions to Johor; among his beneficiaries was long-time family friend, Tan Hiok Nee, who was given a seat in the state council. The plantations operated relatively independently of Johor&#x27;s government, and Abu Bakar was worried about the possible danger to the plantations in the event of an economic crisis. Shortly after a financial crisis broke out in Singapore in 1864, Abu Bakar imposed new regulations on these plantations, as many of them were owned by Chinese businessmen from Singapore. The Kapitan Cina and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce were particularly disturbed by the new regulations, and accused Abu Bakar of attempting to impose a trade monopoly over Johor. The British government pressured Abu Bakar to retract the regulations, which he did in January 1866. In addition, the Kapitan Cina also faced considerable difficulties in securing new agreements with Abu Bakar. The crisis was only resolved in 1866 after Abu Bakar designated five new ports for the registration of cargo, and the British softened their animosity against Abu Bakar.

Abu Bakar&#x27;s relationship with the ruler of Muar, Sultan Ali Iskandar was strained. Soon after Abu Bakar succeeded his father, he sent a letter to Ali Iskandar asserting Johor&#x27;s sovereignty over Segamat, which Ali Iskandar had hoped to exert political influence over. In addition, Ali Iskandar, who had borrowed a large sum from an Indian moneylender in 1860, became a source of irritation for Abu Bakar. Facing difficulties in repaying his debt, Ali Iskandar asked Abu Bakar to pay Ali&#x27;s monthly pension to the moneylender; but he alternated asking for payment to himself and to the moneylender. In 1866, when the moneylender lodged a complaint with the British government, Ali Iskandar tried to borrow from Abu Bakar to repay his outstanding debts. As a result of these constant irritations, Abu Bakar persuaded the Straits Governor to sign an agreement to terminate Ali Iskandar&#x27;s pension.

Abu Bakar made revisions to Johor&#x27;s Islamic code in 1863, after the Sultan of Terengganu revised his state&#x27;s Islamic judicial system to be more closely aligned with Sharia law. In a letter to the Straits Governor, Abu Bakar expressed hope that his revisions would suit more comfortably with European ideas. He founded an English school in Tanjung Puteri in 1864. Two years later, Abu Bakar moved the administrative headquarters to Tanjung Puteri, and officially renamed it as Johor Bahru. A new administration was set up, which was modelled after European styles and certain elements of traditional Malay government. He recruited some of his close relatives and his classmates from the Teluk Blanga Malay school into the bureaucracy, and also set up an advisory council which included two Chinese leaders. In the early 1870s, Straits Governor Sir Harry Ord said of Abu Bakar (who became a Maharaja in 1868) that he was the &quot;only Raja in the whole peninsula or adjoining states who rules in accordance with the practice of civilized nations.&quot;

===Maharaja (1868–1885)===
During a state visit to England in 1866, Abu Bakar was commonly addressed as the &quot;Maharaja&quot; of Johor and led him to realise that the Malay title of Temenggong poorly known in the Western world. He contemplated changing his title, which led him to send his cousin, Ungku Haji Muhammad and the Dato Bentara, Dato Jaafar to meet the Bugis historian, Raja Ali Haji who was residing in Riau. Raja Ali supported Abu Bakar&#x27;s cause, after they did a cross examination and concluded that the past office holders had wielded actual control over the affairs of Johor, rather than the Sultans of the Bendahara dynasty. In addition, questions pertaining to Abu Bakar&#x27;s pursuits to clamour for recognition were also sidelined as he was able to trace his ancestry to the first Sultan of the Bendahara dynasty, Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah IV by his patrilineal ancestors. The Sultan of Lingga, gave his approval for a formal recognition of Abu Bakar as the Maharaja of Johor, after Ungku Haji and Dato Jaafar travelled to Lingga and presented their claims. Abu Bakar also secured approval from the Governor of the Straits Settlements for his change in title, and was officially proclaimed as the Maharaja of Johor on 30 June 1868.

Shortly after his proclamation as Maharaja, Abu Bakar laid plans for the construction of a wooden railway between Johor Bahru and Gunung Pulai after some Europeans had raised proposals to set up a retreat and sanatorium. Construction of the railway started in July 1869 and construction of the first phase was completed in 1874, which ran between Skudai and Johor Bahru. The construction project was later halted after an accident which saw a locomotive falling off the tracks as a result of termites in the wooden tracks within the Skudai portion and a shortage of funds.

In the mid-1870s, the Straits Governor, William Jervois contemplated making Maharaja Abu Bakar overlord of the chiefs in Negeri Sembilan after the British failed to quell the sectarian violence in Sungai Ujong. Abu Bakar&#x27;s client, Tunku Antah was placed as the Yam Tuan of the Sri Menanti confederacy (comprising several small states within the region), and Abu Bakar was made the adviser of Negeri Sembilan (except Sungai Ujong) in 1878. Abu Bakar was believed to have had expansionist ambitions, which was suggested by his involvement in the Pahang Civil War between 1857 and 1864. A later governor, Frederick Weld, aspired for stronger British control over the Malay states and was weary of Abu Bakar&#x27;s influence. The chiefs were lukewarm to the prospect of Johor&#x27;s sphere of influence over Negeri Sembilan, and in 1881 Weld convinced the chiefs within the Sri Menanti confederacy to deal directly with Singapore rather than with Abu Bakar. British officers were also appointed to oversee the affairs in 1883 and 1887, and were gradually given the powers similar to that of a British Resident.

After Sultan Ali Iskandar&#x27;s death in 1877, the Raja Temenggong of Muar and its village chieftains voted in favour of a merger of Muar with Johor following a succession dispute between two of Ali Iskandar sons. His oldest son, Tengku Alam Shah, disputed the legitimacy of the chieftains&#x27; wishes and staked his hereditary claims over Muar. Alam Shah instigated the 1879 Jementah Civil War in a bid to reclaim Muar, but was quickly crushed by the Maharaja&#x27;s forces. During the 1880s, Abu Bakar actively encouraged the Chinese leaders to set up new gambier and pepper plantations in Muar.

Meanwhile, Weld&#x27;s continued efforts to keep Abu Bakar&#x27;s political influence in check and relations between Johor and Singapore became increasingly strained. Abu Bakar was reportedly said to be increasingly reluctant to accept advice from the British-appointed state lawyers, and increasingly turned to his private lawyers. Weld voiced his intent to place a Resident in Johor, which prompted Abu Bakar to make a trip to England in August 1884 to negotiate new terms with the British Colonial Office. The Assistant Under-Secretary of the Colonial Office, Robert Meade, conceded to Abu Bakar&#x27;s request for an absence of a British Resident in Johor, although Abu Bakar gave an in-principle acceptance for a British adviser in Johor (though none was appointed until 1914). An agreement was drawn up, and Abu Bakar was promised control over internal affairs in exchange for British control over foreign affairs pertaining to the state.

===Sultan (1885–1895)===

The Bendahara of Pahang, Wan Ahmad, was proclaimed Sultan of Pahang in 1881. Abu Bakar, who was weary of the increasingly hostile political environment imposed by Weld, considered the importance of the superior moral authority that was accorded to a &quot;Sultan&quot; than to a &quot;Maharaja&quot;. In 1885, Abu Bakar instituted the creation of a state postal and judiciary system modelled along British lines, as well as a military force, the Johor Military Forces (JMF, ) upon his return to Johor.

During his stay in London in late 1885, Abu Bakar expressed his desire to Meade for a formal recognition as the Sultan of Johor. He also met up with Queen Victoria, who had become a personal friend of his, within the same course of his visit. Queen Victoria consented to his wishes, and a treaty was signed on 11 December 1885 which formalised relations between Great Britain and Johor, was concluded between Abu Bakar and the Colonial Office. Abu Bakar also founded the state advisory board in London, which was intended to oversee state interests in London. Several retired officers from the Colonial Office, including William Fielding and Cecil Smith were personally appointed by Abu Bakar to oversee the board&#x27;s administration.

The formal recognition of Abu Bakar by the British as the Sultan of Johor quickly drew criticisms among the Malays in Johor. A pantun circulated among the Malays in Johor, which made fun of Abu Bakar&#x27;s background, became very popular. Many Malays were reluctant to accept Abu Bakar as their paramount ruler, as they were sceptical of Abu Bakar&#x27;s Temenggong political origins and Buginese heritage. Furthermore, his affinity with Western culture did not go down well with the culturally-conservative Malays. A proclamation ceremony was held on 13 February 1886, where Abu Bakar made an official announcement on his adoption of the title &quot;Sultan&quot; in place of &quot;Maharaja&quot;. In the same year on 31 July, Abu Bakar instituted the first state decorations, the Royal Family Order of Johor () and the Order of the Crown of Johor ().

Abu Bakar employed the service of a Chinese contractor and long-time acquaintance, Wong Ah Fook, to oversee the development of Johor Bahru. The Johor Archives showed that Wong was the largest building contractor at that time and had been involved in at least twenty public works projects between 1887 and 1895. In addition, Wong was contracted to oversee the construction of the state mosque and several palaces including the Istana Tyersall under the direction of Abu Bakar. As gratitude to Wong&#x27;s contributions to the state, Abu Bakar granted him a plot of land in the heart of Johor Bahru in 1892. Wong then oversaw the construction of a village, Kampong Ah Fook, as well as a road, Jalan Wong Ah Fook on the land he was granted.

Abu Bakar created the Johor State Establishment Constitution (Malay: &quot;Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor&quot;), drafted by Abdul Rahman Andak, on 14 April 1895. The state&#x27;s constitution was seen as a turning point by many as a step in laying the groundwork for the administration of Johor. It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminent death in light of his failing health, created the state constitution with the intent of preserving the state&#x27;s independence in the light of growing British political influence in the Malay states.

==Foreign relations==

===Great Britain===

Abu Bakar made his inaugural state visit while he was still a Temenggong. He toured England in 1866 with Dato&#x27; Jaafar, and met with members of the English royalty, notably Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales, Prince Edward. The Queen conferred Abu Bakar with the Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI), which he valued highly. The trip reportedly gave both Abu Bakar and Dato&#x27; Jaafar lasting memories of England, and inspired Abu Bakar to develop Johor along British lines. Nine years later, Abu Bakar travelled to Calcutta to meet up with Prince Edward who was then spending his time in the city. The following year, Prince Edward conferred Abu Bakar the Prince of Wales&#x27;s gold medal. He made another trip to London in 1878, where he was invited to attend the State Ball at Buckingham Palace. Abu Bakar&#x27;s palaces were modelled closely along British lines; when Prince George and Prince Albert Victor visited Johor in the 1880s, they had commented that the huge drawing room of Abu Bakar&#x27;s palace closely resembled the state-rooms found at Windsor Castle. He was also an avid polo player, and had raced with the princes during their state visits to Johor. The Duke of Sutherland also praised Abu Bakar&#x27;s hospitality during his state visit after he became sultan, and had reportedly enjoyed the Malay cuisine which the Abu Bakar had served to him.

In particular, Queen Victoria became a close friend of Abu Bakar especially during his later years. During a visit to England in February 1891, Abu Bakar was personally received by the Queen, and was invited to dine and stay with the Queen at Windsor Castle. Queen Victoria held Abu Bakar in very high esteem, which she had signed herself off as an &quot;affectionate friend&quot; in a letter to Abu Bakar in March 1891. Reportedly, Queen Victoria was quoted to have highly valued the silver model Albert Memorial which Abu Bakar sent to her during her Golden Jubilee in 1887. Shortly before his death in May 1895, Queen Victoria sent her personal physician to attend to Abu Bakar&#x27;s medical needs, who was by then very ill when he arrived in London.

===Other countries===

Abu Bakar visited Ottoman Turkey during his European tour in 1866, where he met Sultan Abdülaziz who presented him with Ruggyyah Hanum, a Circassian princess as a gift. Ruggyyah Hanum married Ungku Abdul Majid, Abu Bakar&#x27;s brother after she arrived in Johor. After Ungku Majid&#x27;s untimely death, Ruggyyah Hanum was later remarried to Dato Jaafar (who had accompanied Abu Bakar during his 1866 trip). During his second visit to England in August 1878, Abu Bakar wrote to Colonel Anson from South Kensington of his wishes to visit European royalty in Paris, Vienna and Italy. He managed to visit Paris and Vienna, and was even given a warm reception by Prince Henry of Liechtenstein before returning to Johor. Three years later, he visited Prussia, where he was conferred the Royal Prussian Order of the Crown. He made two separate European tours in 1891 and 1893 with a personal physician by his side, during which he met Emperor Francis Joseph, King Umberto, Pope Leo XIII and Sultan Abdul Hamid II, and was conferred the awards of Commander of the Cross of Italy, Imperial Order of the Osmans (Turkey) and the Commander of the Cross of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

In 1881, Abu Bakar also visited Java, which was under Dutch rule. In the same year, he received the visiting King Kalākaua during his tour around the world and was conferred the Grand Cross of the Order of Kalakaua I of Hawaii. and State Secretary, Muhammad Salleh. On 10 December 1892 at Istana Tyersall, Tyersall, Singapore, the Emperor of China, Guangxu, conveyed by the Consul General in Singapore, bestowed upon him the First Class of the First Grade Order of the Double Dragon for his just treatment of the Chinese in Johor, witnessed by a gathering of Chinese towkays (businesspeople).

==Family==

Abu Bakar married his first wife, Engku Chik during his stay in Pahang in 1857. Abu Bakar was related to Engku Chik by family ties; Engku Chik was the sister of Tun Koris, who was also a brother-in-law to Abu Bakar. Abu Bakar had a daughter with Engku Chik, Tunku Besar Putri. He also had a son, Tunku Ibrahim, and a daughter, Tunku Mariam with his second wife Cecilia Catherina Lange, who was the daughter of a Danish trader, Mads Johansen Lange and his Chinese wife Nonna Sangnio. Lange met Abu Bakar while she was in Singapore, and adopted the Muslim name of &quot;Zubaidah&quot; after her marriage to Abu Bakar in 1870. In 1885, Abu Bakar married a Chinese woman of Cantonese heritage, Wong Ah Gew, with whom he had a daughter, Tunku Azizah. Wong took on the Muslim name of &quot;Fatimah&quot; at her marriage to Abu Bakar, and was crowned the Sultanah in July 1886. Abu Bakar held Wong in very high esteem, who became Abu Bakar&#x27;s confidant pertaining to his involvement in state affairs. Wong became a close friend of Abu Bakar&#x27;s building contractor, Wong Ah Fook as they shared a common surname and dialect group. Wong died in 1891. During his state visit to the Ottoman Empire in September 1893, Abu Bakar married his fourth wife, Khadijah Khanum, who was of Circassian heritage. (Khadijah&#x27;s sister, Rugayah, became the wife of Abu Bakar&#x27;s brother and later the wife of the first Menteri Besar of Johor, Dato&#x27; Jaafar). He had a daughter, Tunku Fatimah with Khadijah the following February, who was later crowned as the Sultanah of Johor.

==Death==
In early May 1895, Abu Bakar travelled to London together with his son and successor, Tunku Ibrahim (later Sultan Ibrahim) with the hope to mustering support and recognition of his rule. He was by then already very ill and was already suffering from an inflammation of the kidneys for sometime and diagnosed with Bright&#x27;s disease. At the onstart of the voyage in early May, he became very weak, and had to be carried aboard a ship in a wheelchair. He reached London on 10 May, and checked into Bailey&#x27;s Hotel but was bedridden throughout his remaining days. He was not allowed to receive many visitors, though the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, Prince Arthur paid two visits. Queen Victoria sent her personal physician, Douglas Powell to attend to his medical needs upon receiving news of his illness.

Abu Bakar contracted pneumonia during his stay in the hotel, which led to his death on the evening of 4 June 1895. His body was then brought back to Johor by an English man-of-war from Penang. A state funeral was given to Abu Bakar, and he was laid to rest at the royal mausoleum at Makam Mahmoodiah on 7 September 1895. His son, Tunku Ibrahim was later installed as the Sultan of Johor in November 1895.

==Legacy==
Abu Bakar was often credited as the &quot;Founder of Modern Johor&quot; (). He established a Western-styled bureaucratic system and civil service, and consolidated the state&#x27;s agricultural economy, which consisted of gambier and pepper plantations headed by Chinese leaders, known as &quot;Kangchu&quot; in Teochew Min. The gambier and pepper plantations were first introduced during the 1840s by Chinese immigrants. Often, Abu Bakar was called in by Malay rulers from neighbouring states to provide advice in the event when the rulers had to make important decisions. In particular, he became a close confidante of the Sultan of Pahang, Wan Ahmad in 1887, with whom Abu Bakar had persuaded Sultan Ahmad to accept a British consultant instead of a Resident. The Colonial Government at that time was seeking for greater control over the Malay States and was making aggressive attempts to impose British Residents into the Malay states. The Colonial Government also made a failed attempt to impose a British Resident in Johor in 1885; the state maintained its independence in its internal affairs until 1914.

Abu Bakar was also the first Malay ruler to visit Europe in 1866. He was an Anglophile, and mingled comfortably with the Europeans. The British governor, Sir Harry Ord had once written to the Secretary of State of Great Britain and described Abu Bakar as an &quot;English gentleman&quot; in his tastes and habits. Abu Bakar had gained his share of critics, especially among the more conservative Malay scholars who were critical of his Western tastes. Abu Bakar&#x27;s penchant for an extravagant lifestyle and foreign travel resulted in a depleted state treasury at the time of his death in 1895. At least one scholar, Nesalmar Nadarajah, had suggested that Johor&#x27;s loss of independence in the early 20th century was attributed to this depleted state treasury. In addition, Nadarajah also believed that the loss of Johor&#x27;s independence was also attributed to Abu Bakar&#x27;s failure of giving attention to his young son, Tunku Ibrahim, who lacked proper education and training in the art of state administration and diplomacy when he succeeded his father as the Sultan of Johor in his early twenties.
Many state&#x27;s buildings which were constructed during Abu Bakar&#x27;s reign were modelled after British Victorian and Moorish architectural styles. Abu Bakar placed the construction of these state buildings under close supervision, and was often called in to lay the foundation stones of these buildings personally. A few of these buildings were named after Abu Bakar himself, notably the Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque (), which was built between 1892 and 1900.
