<text>The [[Yamaha Motor Corporation|Yamaha]] XV1600A is a cruiser-style motorcycle. It is also called the [[Star Motorcycles|Yamaha Road Star]] or in Europe the Yamaha Wild Star. It was produced from 1999 through model year 2014 when the Roadstar model line was discontinued. The 1999-2003 models were the same 1602 cc naturally aspirated engines. In 2004 they changed the displacement to 1,670 cc. There were also a few design changes in 2004, including new tubeless aluminum wheels, a skinnier drive belt, and different engine casing color. The Road Star has a sleeker, sportier brother called the Yamaha Road Star Warrior that has a fuel-injected 1,700 cc engine and an all-aluminum chassis. The Road Star remained unchanged until 2008 when electronic fuel injection was introduced to the bike. There were variations of the Road Star with different trim and equipment packages. The Road Star was available with a Silverado trim package which included studded saddle bags, a back rest, studded driver and passenger seats, and a cruiser-style windscreen. The Silverado package changed names to the Midnight package with blacked out engine etc. For a few years, the Road Star was also available in an &quot;S&quot; package, which meant more chrome pieces for the buyer.

The Road Star is very popular among metric custom bike builders for its ease of customization and large-displacement engine.

The following models of the bike were manufactured:
* XV1600A Road Star (1999–2005)
* XV1600ALE Road Star Limited edition (2003)
* XV1600AS Road Star Midnight Star (2001–2005)
* XV1600AS Road Star MM Limited edition (2000)
* XV1600AT Road Star Silverado (1999–2005)
* XV1600ATLE Road Star Silverado Limited edition (2003)

The Road Star platform spawned other motorcycles for Yamaha including:
* Yamaha MT-01
* Yamaha Roadliner and Stratoliner
* Yamaha Raider

<doc id="1008769" wikidata="Q5467900" url="?curid=1008769" title="Ford Power Stroke engine">
<text>Power Stroke, also known as Powerstroke, is the name used by a family of diesel engines for trucks produced by Ford Motor Company and Navistar International (until 2010) for Ford products since 1994. Along with its use in the Ford F-Series (including the Ford Super Duty trucks), applications include the Ford E-Series, Ford Excursion, and Ford LCF commercial truck. The name was also used for a diesel engine used in South American production of the Ford Ranger.

From 1994, the Power Stroke engine family existed as a re-branding of engines produced by Navistar International, sharing engines with its medium-duty truck lines. Since the 2011 introduction of the 6.7 L Power Stroke V8, Ford has designed and produced its own diesel engines. During its production, the Power Stroke engine range has been marketed against large-block V8 (and V10) gasoline engines along with the General Motors Duramax V8 and the Dodge Cummins B-Series inline-six.

== Engine family list ==
==7.3 Power Stroke==
The first engine to bear the Power Stroke name, the 7.3 L Power Stroke V8 is the Ford version of the Navistar T444E turbo-diesel V8. Introduced in 1994 as the replacement for the 7.3 L IDI V8, the Power Stroke/T444E is a completely new design, with only its bore and stroke dimensions common with its predecessor (resulting in its identical displacement). In line with the IDI diesel, the Power Stroke was offered in three-quarter-ton and larger versions of the Ford F-Series and Econoline product ranges.

The Power Stroke is an electronically controlled, direct injection engine with a bore and stroke creating a displacement of . It has a 17.5:1 compression ratio, and a dry weight of approximately . This engine produces up to and of torque in automatic transmission trucks from the last years of production, and and of torque in manual transmission trucks. The oil pan holds while the top end (due to the HPOP) holds an additional , making for a total of of oil contained within the engine.

The 1994.5 to 1996/97 DI Power Stroke has &quot;single shot&quot; HEUI (hydraulically actuated electronic unit injection) fuel injectors which were AA code injectors unless from California where as they received AB code injectors. It ran a high pressure oil pump (HPOP) to create the necessary oil pressure to fire the fuel injectors. This generation of Power Stroke utilizes an HPOP with a 15° swash plate angle. The 1995-1997 trucks use a two-stage cam-driven fuel pump, whereas the 1999-2003 trucks use a frame rail mounted electric fuel pump. The 1999–2003 trucks also had a deadhead fuel system and a &quot;long lead&quot; injector in cyl. number 8 due to lower fuel pressures with the deadhead design (AE code injector). The California trucks from 1996 and 1997 have a split-shot fuel injectors; other trucks did not get split-shot injectors until 1999. Single-shot injectors only inject one charge of fuel per cycle, whereas the split-shot injector releases a preliminary light load before the main charge to initiate combustion in a more damped manner. This &quot;pre-injection&quot; helps reduce the sharp combustion &#x27;knock&#x27; as well as lower NOx emissions by creating a more complete burn.

1994.5–1997 engines utilize a single turbocharger, non-wastegated, with a turbine housing size of 1.15 A/R. For 1999, an air-to-air intercooler was added to cool the charged air from the turbo for increased air density. With the new cooler, denser air would increase the horsepower potential of the engine, while also reducing exhaust gas temperatures (EGT). The turbine housing was changed to a .84 A/R and a wastegate was added halfway through the 1999 model year. The 1999 engine also received injectors, up from in the early model engine. With the larger injectors, the HPOP capability was increased by utilizing a 17° swash plate angle to meet the requirements of the new, higher flowing injectors.

The engine used forged connecting rods until powdered metal rods were introduced for early 2002 models. Serial numbers can be seen with the aid of a borescope to confirm the changeover between the 2001 and 2002 model years. These new connecting rods sufficed in an unmodified engine, but would become a potentially catastrophic failure point if aftermarket tuning pushed the engine above . Early models did not use any form of exhaust aftertreatment, such as a catalytic converter, as emissions were not enforced on diesel motors; however, by mid-year 2002, Ford began installing catalytic converters as part of the OEM exhaust as part of the Tier 1–3 standards.

===Common issues===

Despite being regarded as one of the most reliable diesel engines ever put in a light-duty truck, the engine had its own issues. A common failure point was the camshaft position sensor (CPS). The failure of this sensor would cause a no-start condition or a stall while running. The easiest way to diagnose a failed CPS is through movement of the tachometer when cranking. If the tachometer does not move, the CPS is most likely bad. The fuel filter/water separator also tends to be a minor failure point across the trucks. The aluminum filter housing can crack, causing fuel leaks. The heating element contained in the filter housing also can short out, blowing a fuse and causing a no start condition. The turbocharger up-pipes are a large failure point, with the pipes leaking from many different points but mainly from the joints. Leaking of the up-pipes causes the engine to lose boost and cause exhaust gas temperatures to increase. The EBPV exhaust back-pressure valve (EBPV) was also prone to failure; it could close when cold and get stuck on causing a jet engine like noise coming from the exhaust.

Most of the issues that came out of these motors were due to poor electrical connections. The UVCH (under valve cover harness) was prone to losing contact with either glow plugs or injectors which caused rough starts or a misfire depending on the year. 1994–1997 engines have two connectors going into each bank, whereas 1999–2003 engines had one connector going into each bank; troubleshooting the harness was easier for the 1994–1997 engines.

The 7.3 L DI Power Stroke was in production until the first quarter of model year 2003, when it was replaced by the 6.0 L. Nearly 2 million 7.3 L DI Power Stroke engines were produced in International&#x27;s Indianapolis plant.

The 7.3 L DI Power Stroke engine is commonly referred to as one of the best engines that International produced.

==6.0 Power Stroke==
The Power Stroke was replaced by the beginning in the second quarter of the 2003 model year. The 6.0L Power Stroke, was used in Ford Super Duty trucks until the 2007 model year but lasted until 2009 in the Ford Econoline vans (model year 2010) and in the Ford Excursion SUVs until after the 2005 models when Ford discontinued Excursion production. The engine has a bore and stroke creating a displacement of . It utilizes a variable-geometry turbocharger and intercooler, producing and torque with an 18.0:1 compression ratio, with fuel cutoff at 4,200 rpm. Many 6.0 L Power Stroke engines experienced problems.

===Key specifications===
* Fuel injection system: Split-shot HEUI (hydraulically actuated electronically controlled unit injectors)
* Valve train: OHV 4-valves per cylinder, 32 valves total (16 intake valves, 16 exhaust valves)
* Turbo configuration: Single; variable vane geometry (VGT)

====Common issues====
* &quot;/&quot; – The sources of the main issues with the 6.0L were the in-block oil cooler, and the EGR cooler materials. The oil cooler is located in the valley of the engine block, underneath the cartridge oil filter set up. The sealed outer portion of the oil cooler is submerged in engine oil, with coolant flowing through the center passages. Over time, the coolant side of oil cooler would plug up with sediment. This would reduce the flow of coolant through the oil cooler and cause higher oil temperatures. This sediment would also reduce the flow of coolant through the EGR cooler resulting in premature failure due to thermal expansion fatiguing the heat exchanging core. The early EGR coolers (2003-2004.5) were also susceptible to premature failure.

&quot;&quot; – With the use of split-shot HEUI fuel injectors, high-pressure oil is required to pressurize the fuel injectors. The main high-pressure oil (HPO) system components are the high-pressure oil pump (HPOP), HPO manifolds, stand pipes, and branch tube. The HPOP is located in the engine valley at the rear of the engine block. Early build years (2003.5–04.5) are well known for premature HPOP failure. This is due to the poor quality materials used in manufacturing. The HPOP is pressurized by a rotating gear, meshed with a rear camshaft gear. The early model HPOP gears were known to be weak, and develop stress cracks in the teeth resulting in gear failure, thus causing a no start issue for the engine. Early models also had the ICP sensor located on the HPOP cover. The high amount of heat in this location, combined with the exposure to debris in the oil was known to cause ICP sensor failure also resulting in a no-start condition. This issue was addressed by Ford with the late-2004 engine update, bringing a new HPOP design, along with relocation of the ICP sensor to the passenger-side valve cover. The newly designed pump is not known for frequent failure, however a new issue arose with the update. In the late model engines, Ford also redesigned the HPO stand pipes and dummy plugs in the HPO manifold, using poor-quality O-rings. These O-rings were prone to failure causing a HPO leak, and eventually a no-start condition. Ford addressed this concern with updated Viton O-ring washers fixing the issue. With the new HPO system design also came a snap-to-connect (STC) fitting. Some models had the issue of the STC fitting&#x27;s prongs breaking, causing the fitting to lose its sealing property and again, a no-start condition for the engine. Another frequent (but not always catastrophic) issue with the HPO system is the injection pressure regulator (IPR) screen. The IPR screen is located in the engine valley with the oil cooler. The material used was susceptible to failure and neglecting to replace the screen during an oil cooler replacement could lead to the debris being sent through the HPOP causing complete failure. If the HPOP does not fail, another common failure point is the IPR that, if contaminated by debris, will not be able to seal completely and will then &quot;bleed off&quot; oil pressure causing a no-start condition.

&quot;&quot; – Ford/International used four Torque to Yield (TTY) cylinder head bolts per cylinder for the 6.0 and 6.4. TTY bolts offer some of the most precise clamping force available but can be problematic. In certain situations—such as the failure of the oil cooler or EGR cooler, or high boost/load levels brought on by performance upgrades—TTY bolts can be stretched beyond their torque mark by increased cylinder pressures (commonly from coolant being introduced into the cylinder). This has never been addressed by Ford because other malfunctions or abuse must occur to stretch the bolts. Some in the aftermarket will replace the factory bolts with head studs in an attempt to protect the head gaskets from future failure. If this is done without addressing the underlying issue, the head gaskets may fail again bringing along a cracked or warped cylinder head. In contrast, the 7.3 and 6.7 have six head bolts per cylinder while the 6.0, 6.4/VT365, and IDI 7.3 only have four.

====Electrical and fuel====
Numerous PCM recalibrations, attempts to &quot;detune&quot; the engine, fuel injector stiction (caused by lack of maintenance and proper oil changes), along with several other drivebility and quality control problems, have plagued the 6.0. The FICM (fuel injection control module) has been a problem, where low voltage in the vehicle&#x27;s electrical system due to failing batteries or a low-output alternator can cause damage to the FICM. In addition, the placement of the FICM on top of the engine subjects it to varying and extreme temperatures and vibrations causing solder joints and components to fail in early build models; mostly in the power supply itself. The FICM multiplies the voltage in the fuel injector circuit from 12 to 48–50 volts to fire the injectors. Low voltage can eventually cause damage to the fuel injectors.

====Lawsuits and litigation====
Many owners who purchased their trucks equipped with the 6.0L Power Stroke engine new have received class-action lawsuit payments. Some owners have opted out of the class action lawsuit and went straight to a fraud case: one example is Charles Margeson of California, who was awarded $214,537.34 plus legal fees ($72,564.04 was for repayment of his 2006 F-350). Margeson, along with 5 other owners who opted out of the class action lawsuits, have been awarded over US$10 million.

==6.4 Power Stroke==
The 6.4L Power Stroke was introduced for the 2008 Ford Super Duty (F-250 through F-550), and was the first engine introduced to the light truck market that utilized dual turbochargers directly from the factory. Additionally, this was the first Power Stroke to use a diesel particulate filter (DPF) to reduce particulate matter emissions from the exhaust. The new DPF and active regeneration system greatly hindered fuel economy and the engine was ultimately retired after 2010 and replaced by the 6.7L Power Stroke. While warranty claims began to show a level of unreliability similar to the previous 6.0L Power Stroke, the 6.4L Power Stroke has proved to be capable of handling elevated boost levels needed to generate high horsepower and torque.

The engine has a bore and stroke, resulting in a total calculated displacement of . Despite having to meet emission regulations, the engine was able to increase horsepower ratings to and torque to at the flywheel. Horsepower and torque are achieved at 3,000 rpm and 2,000 rpm respectively. It also features a compound VGT turbo system. Air enters the low-pressure turbo (the larger of the two) and is fed into the high-pressure turbo (the smaller of the two), then is directed into the engine or intercooler. This system is designed to result in reduced turbo lag when accelerating from a stop. The series-turbo system is set up to provide a better throttle response while in motion to give a power flow more like a naturally aspirated engine. The 6.4 L also has a DPF and dual EGR coolers which are capable of reducing exhaust gas temps by up to 1,000 degrees before they reach the EGR valve and mix with the intake charge. The DPF traps soot and particulates from the exhaust and virtually eliminates the black smoke that most diesel engines expel upon acceleration. The engine computer is programmed to periodically inject extra fuel in the exhaust stroke of the engine (which is called a DPF Regen or regeneration) to burn off soot that accumulates in the DPF. This engine is designed to only run on ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel which has no more than 15 ppm sulfur content; using regular diesel fuel results in emission equipment malfunctions and violates manufacturer warranties.

The 6.4L has had one recall (safety product recall 07S49 was released on March 23, 2007) that addresses the potential for flames to come from the tailpipe of the truck. This problem arises from the DPF which is part of the diesel after-treatment system. A PCM recalibration was released to eliminate the possibility of excessive exhaust temperatures combined with certain rare conditions resulting from what is becoming known as a &quot;thermal event&quot;.

===Key specifications===
* Fuel injection system: High pressure common rail
* Valve train: OHV 4-valve
* Compound VGT turbo
* DPF
* Advanced multi-shot piezoelectric fuel injection control

===Common issues===
* Piston ring failures in #7 and #8 cylinders due to regeneration process. During regeneration, fuel is injected during the exhaust stroke in order to increase the exhaust temperature for DPF cleaning. This exposes the piston rings to excessive heat which eventually causes the piston rings to lose tension, causing low to no compression (compression skip) and excessive blow-by. 
* Rocker arm tips impacting (especially on lower geared trucks) due to higher pressure on valve-train (that was not upgraded from the 6.0 liter engine design) after .
* Turbocharger bearing seal failures (which in turn allows engine lubricating oil to leak past the bearing seal) due to regeneration process pushing high exhaust temperatures through the turbocharger. This condition will precipitate premature clogging of the DPF, which then causes the engine to stay in regeneration mode. If this condition is not corrected quickly, the leaking seal will eventually allow all the engine oil to be pumped out of the engine through the exhaust, causing complete engine failure due to lack of lubrication.
* Higher incidents of cavitation erosion of the front cover due to the larger water pump impeller speed, causing coolant to leak into engine oil.
* EGR cooler failures allowing engine coolant to flow back into #8 cylinder while engine is shut off, which causes the cylinder to hydro-lock and possibly bend the piston connecting rod as well as other damage to engine when it is subsequently started.
* Cylinder head valve guides do not have bronze sleeves, which allows for excessive wear and oil leakage around the valves.
* Connecting rods do not have bronze bushings where the piston wrist pin goes thru the connecting rod. This also allows for excessive wear and noise on higher-mileage vehicles.
* If aftermarket tuning is installed that introduces too much advanced fuel injection timing, cracking of the cylinder heads can result due to excessive combustion temperatures.
* Very high cost of service and repair parts compared to other versions of the Power Stroke.
* Siemens K16 High Pressure Fuel Pump had a problem of self destruction in the 6.4L Power Stroke. When the pump destroyed itself, shrapnel would almost always be sent to all eight injectors, basically rendering them just as useless as the destroyed pump. On occasion, an injector may become stuck open and burn a piston crown, resulting in more repair work. 
*Cracking pistons were a problem and usually started on the thin edge of the fuel bowl on the pistons. It occurred more frequently in high-mileage engines, and if left untreated for too long, more engine damage could occur.

==6.7 Power Stroke==
The 6.7L Power Stroke debuted in the 2011 Ford Super Duty (F-250 through F-550) trucks, replacing the 6.4L Power Stroke. The first Power Stroke engine to be developed and manufactured by Ford, it was designed in conjunction with AVL of Austria. During its development, Ford engineers codenamed this engine &quot;Scorpion&quot; because of the exhaust manifold and turbocharger being mounted in the engine&#x27;s &quot;valley.&quot; It features a compacted graphite iron (CGI) block for greater strength and reduced weight, reverse flow aluminum cylinder heads (the exhaust ports are located in the lifter valley) with dual water jackets, six head bolts per cylinder, and high-pressure common rail Bosch fuel system. The system delivers up to five injection events per cylinder per cycle using eight-hole piezo injectors spraying fuel into the piston bowl. This engine also supports B20 biodiesel, allowing fueling options of up to 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent petroleum diesel. Garrett&#x27;s single-sequential turbocharger features an industry-first double-sided compressor wheel mounted on a single shaft. The engine block is cast by Tupy, which also does the initial machining. The connecting rods are made by Mahle.

Emissions controls include exhaust gas recirculation, Denoxtronic-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) from Bosch, and a DPF. Output was originally and . but shortly after production started, Ford announced that it made an update to the engine. The new engine control software makes the engine capable of at 2,800 rpm and at 1,600 rpm while achieving better fuel economy and without any physical changes to the engine. The 2015 engines are rated at and . Ford claimed the bump in horsepower is from a new turbocharger, new injector nozzles, and exhaust improvements. For 2017, the torque had risen to at 1800 rpm, while horsepower remained the same. To compete with the Duramax and Cummins engines from GM and Ram, Ford increased output for the 2018 model year to . Previously, the Duramax motor had a gain over the Power Stroke in 2017, and the Cummins engine for 2018 would have had a torque gain over the Power Stroke if the Power Stroke&#x27;s output hadn&#x27;t been increased for 2018. As of 2020, the Power Stroke&#x27;s output was increased to 475 hp at 2600 rpm and 1050 lb-ft at 1600 rpm, becoming the best-in-class diesel in horsepower. A high-output variant was introduced for the 2023 model year, producing and of torque.

=== Common issues ===

* Turbocharger Failures. Turbocharger failures were common on 2011 and 2012 model year 6.7L Power Stroke equipped pickups because of weak ceramic ball bearings in the Honeywell DualBoost turbo. The issue was resolved by using steel ball bearings. Turbo failures are characterized by loud screeching sounds and smoke from the tailpipe. 
* Defective Radiators. Early 2011 model year pickups with the 6.7L Power Stroke often experienced radiator leaks. Defects in radiators manufactured before September 2010 were the likely cause. Later model years had fewer reported issues, but leaks can still occur over time.
* NOx Sensor Failures. The 2011 model year engines had frequent failures of NOx sensors, resulting in reduced engine power. Ford addressed the issue through the Custom Satisfaction Program 12B33, which replaced faulty sensors and upgraded the emission control strategy. The program expired in April 2013.
* EGT Sensor on &quot;Ambulance Package&quot; Chassis Cab Trucks. Certain 2011 and 2012 F-350 through F-550 trucks with the &quot;Ambulance Package&quot; had faulty EGT sensors. Failures could cause vehicle shutdown while driving or difficulty restarting. Ford issued a recall (recall 13S10) to replace the sensors, primarily in emergency vehicles. Similar incidents occurred in pickup models but were less widespread.
* Dropping Glow Plugs and Catastrophic Engine Failure. Some early production 6.7L Power Stroke engines experienced glow plug tip breakage, leading to catastrophic engine failure. This issue was limited and not a significant concern in later production engines, mainly occurring in specific chassis cab models. Ford would have taken action if widespread issues were detected.
* CP4 Failure. Much less common (but not uncommon) was the failure of the CP4 pump which would lead to catastrophic engine failure. Due to the use of low lubricity fuels, susceptibility to internal wear, and potential of air bubbles formation in the housing, accelerated wear could occur, causing metal shavings to enter the fuel system and damaging components such as the fuel rails, high-pressure lines, injectors, overflow valve, and return lines.

===Key specifications===
* Diesel particulate filter
* Valve train: OHV 4-valve
* Turbo configuration: GT32 SST single sequential turbocharger; single turbine and dual-sided compressor
* Fuel injection system: High-pressure common rail, Bosch CP4 injection pump, piezoelectric injectors

2015–2016
==3.2 Power Stroke==

The 3.2L Power Stroke is an inline-five engine that debuted in the U.S.-spec Transit for model year 2015. The engine is a modified version of the Ford Duratorq 3.2L diesel engine that has been adapted to meet emissions in the United States. To aid in economy, emissions, and reduce NVH, it has a high-pressure common-rail fuel injection system and piezo injectors that can spray up to five different injections per compression event. It has a water-cooled EGR system to reduce the temperature of the exhaust gas before being recirculated through the intake. A unique feature to the emissions system is that the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and the DPF have been combined into one singular unit as opposed to the traditional two separate units. Exhaust treatment continues with SCR which is done by the injection of diesel exhaust fluid in the exhaust to reduce NOx. The engine features a variable-geometry turbo which allows for intake airflow tuning on the fly to increase power and fuel economy. The engine also features a variable-flow oil pump to avoid wasting mechanical energy pumping excessive amounts of oil. It has cast aluminum, low-friction pistons with oil squirters to keep them cool during heavy-load conditions, a die-cast aluminum cam carrier to stiffen up the valvetrain and reduce NVH, and to increase low-end durability, the crankshaft is cast iron and the connecting rods are forged. The block itself is an extra rigid, gray cast iron with a closed deck. The power figures for the 3.2L Power Stroke are at 3,000 rpm and at 1,500–2,750 rpm. The Euro Duratorq 3.2 makes and of torque.

===Key specifications===
*Fuel injection system: High-pressure common-rail
*Valvetrain: DOHC 4-valve
*Turbo configuration: Single variable-geometry turbo
*Combined diesel particulate filter and diesel oxidation catalyst
*Urea-injected selective catalytic reduction

==3.0 Power Stroke==

The 3.0 L Power Stroke turbo-diesel V6, codenamed &quot;Lion,&quot; was introduced in the 2018 Ford F-150 to compete with the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel V6. The engine has a bore and stroke of with a compression ratio of 16.0:1, and generates at 3,250 rpm and of torque at 1,750 rpm, paired with a Ford–GM 10-speed automatic transmission. It provided a towing capacity of up to when properly equipped. EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings ranged from highway, city, and combined, depending on drivetrain and model year. It continued to be offered until the 2021 model year in North America. The 3.0 L Power Stroke was assembled in Dagenham, England.

==Other engines with the Power Stroke name==
*In South American models, the 2001–2012 Ford Ranger used a Power Stroke engine in their diesel versions. A 2.8L diesel engine was developed by Navistar/International from an inline-four Land Rover Defender diesel 2.5L engine, with (waste gate) or (VNT). A 3.0L displacement version, with common-rail fuel injection, four-valve-per-cylinder heads, and (wastegate turbo), is the electronic version of the Power Stroke. It has only the block and connecting rods in common with 2.8L Power Stroke.
*The 4.5L Power Stroke was a V6 Power Stroke with the same turbo design as a 6.4L. The geometry of the engines is the same as the 6.0L minus two cylinders. The 4.5L and 6.0L share some of the same engine parts. The 4.5L came stock with and of torque.

<doc id="1008836" wikidata="Q7077322" url="?curid=1008836" title="Odd Fellows">
<text>Odd Fellows (or Oddfellows when referencing the Grand United Order of Oddfellows or some British-based fraternities; also Odd Fellowship or Oddfellowship) is an international fraternity consisting of lodges first documented in 1730 in London. The first known lodge was called Loyal Aristarcus Lodge No. 9, suggesting there were earlier ones in the 18th century. Notwithstanding, convivial meetings were held &quot;in much revelry and, often as not, the calling of the Watch to restore order.&quot; Names of several British pubs today suggest past Odd Fellows affiliations. In the mid-18th century, following the Jacobite risings, the fraternity split into the rivaling Order of Patriotic Oddfellows in southern England, favouring William III of England, and the Ancient Order of Oddfellows in northern England and Scotland, favouring the House of Stuart.

Odd Fellows from that time include John Wilkes (1725–1797) and Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet of Thornton (1726–1784), advocating civil liberties and reliefs, including Catholic emancipation. Political repressions, such as the Unlawful Oaths Act (1797) and the Unlawful Societies Act (1799), resulted in neutral amalgamation of the Grand United Order of Oddfellows in 1798. Since then the fraternity has remained religiously and politically independent. George IV of the United Kingdom, admitted in 1780 while he was Prince of Wales, was the first documented of many Odd Fellows to also attend freemasonry, although the societies remain mutually independent.

In 1810, further instigations led to the establishment of the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity in England. Odd Fellows spread overseas, including formally chartering the fraternity in the United States in 1819. In 1842, due to British authorities intervening in the customs and ceremonies of British Odd Fellows and in light of post-colonial American sovereignty, the American Odd Fellows became independent as the Independent Order of Odd Fellows (always written as Odd Fellows, not Oddfellows like other orders) under British-American Thomas Wildey (1782–1861), soon constituting the largest sovereign grand lodge. The Daughters of Rebekah, now known as the International Association of Rebekah Assemblies, was established in 1851 as a women&#x27;s auxiliary organization to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Likewise, by the mid-19th century, the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity had become the largest and richest fraternal organisation in the United Kingdom.

In 1843, rejected from the Independent Order of Odd Fellows due to race, Peter Ogden petitioned the Grand United Order of Oddfellows for a charter and was granted it forming the Philomathean Lodge, No. 646, in New York City. The women&#x27;s auxiliary organization, Household of Ruth, was established in 1858.

Odd Fellows promote philanthropy, the ethic of reciprocity and charity; some grand lodges imply a Judeo-Christian affiliation. The American-based Independent Order of Odd Fellows enrolls some 600,000 members divided into approximately 10,000 lodges in thirty countries, and is interfraternally recognised by the British-based Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity. In total, members of all international branches combined are estimated in the millions worldwide.

==Name==
Several theories aim to explain the etymological background of the name &quot;Odd Fellows,&quot; often rendered &quot;Oddfellows&quot; in British English. In the 18th century United Kingdom, major trades were organised in guilds or other forms of syndicates, but smaller trades did not have equivalent social or financial security. One theory has it that &quot;odd fellows&quot;, people who exercised unusual, miscellaneous &quot;odd trades&quot;, eventually joined together to form a larger group of &quot;odd fellows.&quot;

Another theory suggests that in the beginning of odd fellowship in the 18th century, at the time of the early era of industrialisation, it was rather odd to find people who followed noble values such as fraternalism, benevolence and charity. The name was supposedly adopted at a time when the severance into sects and classes was so wide that persons aiming at social union and mutual help were a marked exception to the general rule. Possibly, it met a mixed reaction from the upper classes, who may have seen them as a source of revenue by taxes, but also as a threat to their authority.

Any suggestion of history before the 18th century is considered mere speculation.

==History==


===Background===
The Odd Fellows are one of the earliest and oldest fraternal societies, but their early history is obscure and largely undocumented.

Traditions tracing the fraternity&#x27;s origins back to Roman emperors Nero and Titus are considered dubious. The evolution of the society from medieval guilds, however, is more reliably documented.

By the 13th century, tradesmen&#x27;s guilds had become established and prosperous. During the 14th century, guild masters moved to protect their power and wealth by restricting access to the guilds. In response, the less experienced and less wealthy fellows established their own rival guilds., , 

When Henry VIII broke with the Roman Catholic Church, he viewed the guilds as supporting the pope, and in 1545 he confiscated all material property of the guilds. Elizabeth I stripped the guilds of the responsibility for training apprentices, and by the end of her reign, most guilds had been suppressed.


===Foundation===
There were numerous Oddfellow organizations in England in the 1700s. One Edwardian Oddfellow history argued that in 1710 there was a &#x27;Loyal Lintot of Oddfellows&#x27; in London. The first Oddfellows group in South Yorkshire, England, dates from 1730. The earliest surviving documented evidence of an “Oddfellows” lodge is the minutes of Loyal Aristarchus Oddfellow Lodge no. 9 in England, dated 12 March 1748. By it being lodge number 9, this connotes that there were older Oddfellows lodges that existed before this date.

Subsequent to the failure of Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27;s uprising in 1745, in 1789 these two Orders formed a partial amalgamation as the Grand United Order of Oddfellows. These days they are more commonly known as &quot;The Grand United Order of Oddfellows Friendly Society&quot; (GUOOFS), abandoning all political and religious disputes and committing itself to promoting the harmony and welfare of its members. Some books mention that there was a lodge of a &#x27;Union Order of Oddfellows&#x27; in London in 1750, and one in Derby in 1775.

The &quot;Oddfellows Magazine&quot; of 1888 included a picture of a medal presented to the secretary of a lodge of the Grand Independent Order of Oddfellows in 1796. In a magazine review of a 1798 sermon preached in the Sheffield Parish Church, the &quot;Oddfellows appear to be very numerous with about thirty-nine lodges of them in London and its vicinity, two at Sheffield, and one at each of the following places: Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Shrewsbury, Windsor, Wandsworth, Canterbury, Liverpool, Richmond in Surrey and Lewes&quot;. This suggested that the &quot;Original United Order of Oddfellows&quot; consisted of a total of 50 lodges at that time.

In 1810, various lodges of the Union or United Order in the Manchester area declared themselves as an &quot;Independent Order&quot;, and organized the &quot;Manchester Unity of Oddfellows&quot; which chartered the Odd Fellows in North America in 1819.

==Catholic opposition==
The Catholic Church in the 19th and early 20th centuries condemned secretive societies such as the Freemasons, deemed &quot;pseudo-religious&quot;, but also addressed other organisations, including expressing suspicions against the stated religious neutrality and independence of Oddfellows.

In 1907, the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, the Most Rev Diomede Falconio, in reply to a query from the Rev Novatus Benzing, OFM, of Phoenix, Arizona, determined that the Daughters of Rebekah, the auxiliary of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, as well as the female auxiliaries of other condemned secret societies, fell under the same category of condemnation.

However, permission for &quot;passive membership&quot; in female groups affiliated with societies condemned by the church in 1894 (including the Knights of Pythias and Sons of Temperance) could be granted individually under certain conditions, viz. that the person in question had joined the group in good faith before the condemnation, that leaving the group would cause financial hardship due to the loss of sick benefits and insurance, that if permission is granted dues would only be paid by mail, the parishioner would not attend any lodge meetings, and the society would not have anything to do with the person&#x27;s funeral.

Since 1975, however, several Catholic priests have become members of the Odd Fellows. One of them was Father Titian Anthos Miani who joined Scio Lodge No. 102 of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows in Linden, California. As soon as the controversy declined and religious leaders began to accept secular organizations, numerous pastors, priests, bishops and rabbis from different religious sects have become members and some even held leadership positions in the Odd Fellows. However, since the new code of Canon Law did not explicitly mention Masonic orders and other secret societies, the Office of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a declaration on Masonic associations in 1983, stating clearly that the opposition of the Catholic Church stated in the earlier version of the Canon Law had not changed.

<doc id="1008840" wikidata="Q945081" url="?curid=1008840" title="Don Meredith">
<text>Joseph Donald Meredith (April 10, 1938 – December 5, 2010), nicknamed &quot;Dandy Don&quot; was an American football player, sports commentator, and actor who played quarterback for nine seasons with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the SMU Mustangs, and was selected by the Chicago Bears 32nd overall in the 1960 NFL Draft, which took place in November 1959. This draft occurred before the Dallas Cowboys were officially established in January 1960. The Cowboys later acquired Meredith&#x27;s rights through a trade, allowing them to sign him. He was the second starting quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys, following Eddie LeBaron, and is the first major franchise quarterback in Cowboys history. Under the mentorship of head coach Tom Landry, Meredith led the Cowboys to three-straight postseason appearances from the 1966 to 1968 seasons, including back-to-back NFL Championship Game appearances in the 1966 and 1967 seasons. He was selected a second-team All-Pro in 1966 and made three-straight Pro Bowls from 1966 to 1968.

Meredith was named to the Pro Bowl in each of his last three years as a player. He subsequently became a color analyst for NFL telecasts from 1970 to 1984. As an original member of the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcast team, alongside Howard Cosell. Meredith was also an actor who appeared in a dozen films and seven major television shows, some of which had him as the main starring actor. He is familiar to television audiences as Bert Jameson, a recurring role he had in &quot;Police Story&quot;.

==Early life==
Meredith was born on April 10, 1938, in Mount Vernon, Texas, located about 100 miles east of Dallas. He attended Mount Vernon High School in his hometown, where he starred in football and basketball, performed in school plays, and graduated second in his class.

==College career==
Although he was heavily recruited by Texas A&amp;M head coach Bear Bryant, Meredith played college football at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas. His reasoning, likely intended to be more humorous than real, was due to its being closer to home, and the acronym being easier to spell. He led the Southwest Conference (SWC) in passing completion percentage in each of his three years as the starting quarterback (1957–59), and was an All-America selection in 1958 and 1959. His fellow students jokingly referred to the school as &quot;Southern &quot;Meredith&quot; University&quot; due to his popularity on campus. He completed 8 of 20 passes for 156 yards in the College All-Stars&#x27; 32–7 loss to the defending NFL champion Baltimore Colts in Chicago on August 12, 1960.

Meredith was honored twice by SMU in later decades; he was the recipient of the university&#x27;s Distinguished Alumni Award in 1983, and his jersey number 17 was retired during halftime ceremonies at the SMU–Houston game on October 18, 2008. He was also inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982.

==Professional career==
The Dallas Cowboys franchise was admitted to the league too late to participate in the 1960 NFL draft, so on November 28, 1959, two days before the draft, Meredith signed a five-year personal services contract with Tecon Corporation, which like the Cowboys, was owned by Clint Murchison. He was intending to attend law school before the deal. This contract meant he would play for the Cowboys if and when they received an NFL franchise. He was also selected by the Chicago Bears in the third round (32nd overall) of the 1960 NFL Draft, after Bears owner George Halas made the pick to help ensure that the expansion Cowboys got off to a solid start. The league honored the contract, but made the Cowboys compensate the Bears with a third-round pick in the 1962 NFL draft. He is considered by some to be the original Dallas Cowboy because he had come to the team even before the franchise had adopted a nickname, hired a head coach (Tom Landry) or scout (Gil Brandt), or participated in either the 1960 NFL Expansion Draft or its first NFL Draft in 1961. The Texans, their crosstown rivals in the American Football League, also chose him as a &quot;territorial selection&quot; in their 1960 draft, but were too late to sign him.

Meredith spent two years as a backup to Eddie LeBaron, eventually splitting time in 1962 before he was given the full-time starting job by head coach Tom Landry in 1963. When statistics for sacks were counted retroactively for his era, Meredith became the first quarterback to have been sacked more than 50 times, having been sacked 58 times in the 1964 season. The team went 5-4-1 with Meredith as starter. The following year, they did even better, as he went 7–4 in games while throwing 22 touchdowns to 13 interceptions. In 1966, Meredith led the Cowboys to the NFL postseason, something he continued to do until his unexpected retirement before the 1969 season. His two most heartbreaking defeats came in NFL Championship play against the Green Bay Packers, 34–27 in Dallas (1966), during which he was intercepted on a 4th-down passing play, an interception that he later claimed was due to a coaching issue, having incorrect personnel and formation on the field; and the famous &quot;Ice Bowl&quot; game, 21–17 in Green Bay (1967). Already feeling physically and mentally fatigued as a leader, he had his worst playoff outing in 1968 against the Cleveland Browns in the Eastern Conference Championship game, throwing three interceptions before being benched, which led to his retirement in 1969 at age 31. His successor Craig Morton also struggled to win a championship until ultimately Roger Staubach proved to be the missing ingredient needed to finally help the 1971 Cowboys win their first Super Bowl.

Meredith was always exceptionally popular with Cowboys fans, who remember him for his grit and toughness, his outgoing nature, and his leadership during the first winning seasons for the Cowboys. During his career, he had a 50.7% completion rate, throwing for 17,199 yards and 135 touchdowns with a lifetime passer rating of 74.8. He was named the NFL Player of the Year in 1966 and was named to the Pro Bowl three times. According to the NFL, the longest pass with no yards after catch was his 83-yard pass to Bob Hayes. However, the NFL does not keep statistics on the distance of actual passes.
==NFL career statistics==
==Post-football career==

Following his football career, Meredith helped market Docutel automated teller machines; his brother B. J. was president of the Dallas-area company. Meredith became a color commentator for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; beginning in 1970. He left for three seasons (1974–1976) to work with Curt Gowdy at &quot;NFL on NBC&quot;, then returned to &quot;MNF&quot; partners Frank Gifford and Howard Cosell. His approach to color commentary was light-hearted and folksy in contrast to Cosell&#x27;s scholarly, professorial observations and Gifford&#x27;s straightforward, technical play-by-play analyses. He was known for singing &quot;Turn out the lights, the party&#x27;s over&quot; (a line from a Willie Nelson song &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot;) at garbage time.

Meredith&#x27;s broadcasting career was also not without a few incidents of minor controversy, including referring to then-President Richard Nixon as &quot;Tricky Dick&quot;, announcing that he was &quot;mile-high&quot; before a game in Denver, and turning the name of Cleveland Browns receiver Fair Hooker into a double entendre (saying &quot;Fair Hooker...well, I haven&#x27;t met one yet!&quot;). He retired from sportscasting after the 1984 season, a year after Cosell&#x27;s retirement. His final broadcast was Super Bowl XIX with Frank Gifford and Joe Theismann, which was the first Super Bowl broadcast by ABC. He moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he lived in seclusion as a painter until his passing.

In 1976, Meredith was inducted into the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor at Texas Stadium with former running back Don Perkins.

The novel &quot;North Dallas Forty&quot;, written by former Dallas Cowboy wide receiver and Meredith teammate Peter Gent, is a fictional account of life in the NFL during the 1960s, featuring quarterback Seth Maxwell, a character widely believed to be based on Meredith, and receiver Phil Elliot, believed to be based on Gent. Maxwell and Elliot are characterized as boozing, womanizing, aging stars in the twilight of their careers, held together by pills and alcohol. Of the story, Meredith said, &quot;If I&#x27;d known Gent was as good as he says he was, I would have thrown to him more.&quot;

Meredith was selected as the 2007 recipient of the Pro Football Hall of Fame&#x27;s Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award. He received the award at the Enshrinee&#x27;s Dinner on August 3, 2007.

==Acting career==
Meredith also had an acting career, appearing in multiple movies and television shows. From the mid-1970s through the early &#x27;80s, he was in a series of commercials for Lipton Tea. He voiced himself in an episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;
(&quot;A Beer Can Named Desire&quot;), in which he misses a throw that would have won the main character, Hank Hill, $100,000. He was also part of an ensemble cast in his son Michael Meredith&#x27;s &quot;Three Days of Rain&quot; with Blythe Danner, Peter Falk, and Jason Patric.

One of his early film roles was as Kelly Freeman in the 1974 film &quot;Terror on the 40th Floor&quot;, which starred John Forsythe, Joseph Campanella, and Lynn Carlin.

One of his recurring starring roles was as Detective Bert Jameson in &quot;Police Story&quot;. Tony Lo Bianco also had an ongoing role as Det. Calabrese in the same lot of episodes as Meredith. They also appeared as their characters separately in later episodes. One episode, &quot;The Witness&quot;, features a picture of Meredith in his Dallas uniform hanging on a wall in Delaney&#x27;s bar, while Bert interviews witnesses to a robbery below his picture.

==Family==
Meredith was married three times. His first wife was former SMU cheerleader Lynne Shamburger; they were married from 1959 to 1963 and had one daughter, Mary. From 1965 to 1971, he was married to the former Cheryl King, with whom he had son Michael and daughter Heather. He met his third wife, the former Susan Lessons Dullea (ex-wife of actor Keir Dullea), as they were both walking on Third Avenue in New York City. They married in 1972.

==Death==
Meredith died on December 5, 2010, at St. Vincent Regional Medical Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico, after suffering a brain hemorrhage. He was 72 years old. He was laid to rest in his hometown of Mount Vernon, Texas.

<text>Hammond Edward &quot;Ham&quot; Fisher (September 24, 1900 [some sources indicate 1901] – December 27, 1955) was an American comic strip writer and cartoonist. He is best known for his long, popular run on &quot;Joe Palooka&quot;, which was launched in 1930 and ranked as one of the top five newspaper comics strips for several years.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Ham Fisher dropped out of school at the age of 16 to work as a brush peddler and truck driver before finding employment as a reporter and ad salesman for the &quot;Wilkes-Barre Record&quot; and then moving on to a job with the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;.

===Joe Palooka===
In 1920, Fisher put together a sample package of &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; (then titled &quot;Joe the Dumbbell&quot;) but was unable to attract interest. By 1927, he was working as a traveling strip salesman for the McNaught Syndicate. However, Fisher also hawked his own unpublished, unsold strip.

In 1928, after he secured over 20 sales, including to New York&#x27;s &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Fisher informed his managers at McNaught, who decided to give &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; a trial run. The comic strip soon became a national success. The strip helped to solidify the word &quot;palooka&quot; as a boxer who lacks grace or ability, although the character Joe Palooka was the heavyweight champion. A dozen low-budget film adaptations of &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; appeared from the 1930s into the 1950s. Comic books featuring &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; began in 1933 and continued through the 1950s.

===Feud with Al Capp===
Searching for assistants to work on the strip, Fisher hired (among others) Al Capp, who later achieved fame as the writer-cartoonist of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. While ghosting on &quot;Joe Palooka&quot;, Capp claimed to have created the storyline about a stupid musclebound hillbilly named &quot;Big Leviticus&quot;, an apparent prototype for the Li&#x27;l Abner character. When Capp quit &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; in 1934 to launch his own strip, Fisher badmouthed him to colleagues and editors, claiming that Capp had stolen his idea. For years, Fisher would bring the characters back to his strip, billing them as &quot;the Original Hillbilly Characters&quot; and advising readers not to be &quot;fooled by imitations&quot;. Comics historians Denis Kitchen and Michael Schumacher have suggested that while there appears to be no definitive answer as to whether Capp or Fisher invented the hillbillies, they say there is reason to doubt that Capp ghosted several weeks of &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; strips entirely by himself.

The Capp-Fisher feud was well known in cartooning circles, and it became personal and vitriolic as Capp&#x27;s strip eclipsed &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; in popularity. In the 1930s, to replace Capp, Fisher hired away Capp&#x27;s top assistant, Moe Leff, along with Phil Boyle and a letterer. All three continued to work for Fisher for two decades. Fisher, Leff and Boyle all collaborated on the art, with Leff drawing the figures and Fisher doing the heads. Leff also contributed to scripting the strip.

After Fisher underwent plastic surgery, Capp once included a racehorse in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; named Ham&#x27;s Nose Bob. Traveling in the same social circles, the two men engaged in a 20-year mutual vendetta, as described in 1998 by Jay Maeder in the &quot;Daily News&quot;: &quot;They crossed paths often, in the midtown watering holes and at National Cartoonists Society banquets, and the city&#x27;s gossip columns were full of their snarling public donnybrooks.&quot;

In 1950, Capp wrote an article for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; entitled &quot;I Remember Monster&quot;. The article recounted Capp&#x27;s days working for an unnamed &quot;benefactor&quot; with a miserly, swinish personality, who Capp claimed was a never-ending source of inspiration when it came time to create a new unregenerate villain for his comic strip.

====Retaliation====
Fisher retaliated clumsily, falsely accusing Capp of sneaking obscenities into his comic strip. Submitting examples of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; to United Feature Syndicate (Capp&#x27;s syndicate) and to the New York courts, Fisher claimed pornographic images were hidden in the background art. Capp was able to refute the accusation by simply showing the original printed strips. According to the recollection of Fisher&#x27;s friend Morris Weiss, &quot;What Ham Fisher did was to take a lot of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; strips that were suggestive. In one case, he cut off the end of one strip, which made it look more suggestive than others. He did not doctor any art on the strips... The story that Ham doctored the artwork came from Al Capp, of course.&quot; Capp&#x27;s brother Elliot Caplin recalls the doctored strips as having been drawn upon, with additions of lines and shadows intended to simulate body parts.

In 1954, as Capp was applying for a Boston television license, the FCC received an anonymous packet of pornographic &quot;L&#x27;il Abner&quot; drawings. The National Cartoonists Society, an organization that Fisher had helped to found, convened an ethics hearing, and Fisher was expelled. Fisher became the only man ever sanctioned for &quot;conduct unbecoming a cartoonist&quot;. Around the same time, Fisher&#x27;s mansion in Carol Beach, Wisconsin was destroyed by a storm.

===Death===
On December 27, 1955, Fisher left his home for Moe Leff&#x27;s studio, which Fisher had been using while Leff was out of town. Fisher telephoned his mother shortly after 1 pm, engaging in what police termed a &quot;sentimental&quot; conversation, and later in the evening, Fisher&#x27;s concerned wife asked Weiss to check the studio, where Fisher&#x27;s body was discovered just after 9 pm. Notes found by police indicated Fisher was despondent over his failing health and planned an overdose of medication. A will drawn up weeks before his death left an estate of $2.5 million to his wife Marilyn and daughter Wendy.

The feud between Fisher and Capp, and Fisher&#x27;s suicide, was fictionalized with all names changed and many details altered in the mystery novel &quot;Strip for Murder&quot; by Max Allan Collins.

In 2023, Fisher was posthumously inducted into the Luzerne County Arts &amp; Entertainment Hall of Fame. He was inducted as part of the Hall of Fame&#x27;s inaugural class.

<doc id="1008844" wikidata="Q971081" url="?curid=1008844" title="Timeline of glaciation">
<text>There have been five or six major ice ages in the history of Earth over the past 3 billion years. 
The Late Cenozoic Ice Age began 34 million years ago, its latest phase being the Quaternary glaciation, in progress since 2.58 million years ago.

Within ice ages, there exist periods of more severe glacial conditions and more temperate conditions, referred to as glacial periods and interglacial periods, respectively. The Earth is currently in such an interglacial period of the Quaternary glaciation, with the Last Glacial Period of the Quaternary having ended approximately 11,700 years ago. The current interglacial is known as the Holocene epoch. 
Based on climate proxies, paleoclimatologists study the different climate states originating from glaciation.

== Known ice ages ==

==Descriptions==

The third ice age, and possibly most severe, is estimated to have occurred from 720 to 635 Ma (million years) ago, in the Neoproterozoic Era, and it has been suggested that it produced a second &quot;Snowball Earth&quot;, i.e. a period during which Earth was completely covered in ice. It has also been suggested that the end of that second cold period was responsible for the subsequent Cambrian explosion, a time of rapid diversification of multi-cellular life during the Cambrian Period. The hypothesis is still controversial, though is gaining credence among researchers, as evidence in its favour has mounted.

A minor series of occurred from 460 to 430 Ma, and there were extensive glaciations from 350 to 289 Ma.

The Late Cenozoic Ice Age has seen extensive ice sheets in Antarctica for the last 34 Ma. During the last 3 Ma, ice sheets have also developed on the northern hemisphere. That phase is known as the Quaternary glaciation, and was marked by more or less extensive glaciation. They first appeared with a dominant frequency of 41,000 years, but after the Mid-Pleistocene Transition that changed to high-amplitude cycles, with an average period of 100,000 years.

== Nomenclature of Quaternary glacial cycles ==
Whereas the first 30 million years of the Late Cenozoic Ice Age mostly involved Antarctica, the Quaternary has seen numerous ice sheets extending over parts of Europe and North America that are currently populated and easily accessible. Early geologists therefore named apparent sequences of glacial and interglacial periods of the Quaternary Ice Age after characteristic geological features, and these names varied from region to region. The marine record preserves all the past glaciations; the land-based evidence is less complete because successive glaciations may wipe out evidence of their predecessors. Ice cores from continental ice accumulations also provide a complete record, but do not go as far back in time as marine data. Pollen data from lakes and bogs as well as loess profiles provided important land-based correlation data. The &quot;names&quot; system has mostly been phased out by professionals. It is now more common for researchers to refer to the periods by their marine isotopic stage number. For example, there are five Pleistocene glacial/interglacial cycles recorded in marine sediments during the last half million years, but only three classic glacials were originally recognized on land during that period (Mindel, Riss and Würm).

Land-based evidence works acceptably well back as far as MIS 6 (see Marine isotope stages, Stages), but it has been difficult to coordinate stages using just land-based evidence before that. Hence, the &quot;names&quot; system is incomplete and the land-based identifications of ice ages previous to that are somewhat conjectural. Nonetheless, land based data is essentially useful in discussing landforms, and correlating the known marine isotopic stage with them.

=== Uncertain correlations ===
It has proved difficult to correlate the traditional regional names with the global marine and ice core sequences. The indexes of MIS often identify several distinct glaciations that overlap in time with a single traditional regional glaciation. Some modern authors use the traditional regional glacial names to identify such a sequence of glaciations, whereas others replace the word &quot;glaciation&quot; with &quot;complex&quot; to refer to a continuous period of time that also includes warmer stages. As shown in the table below, it is only during the last 200-300 thousand years that the time resolution of the traditional nomenclature allow for clear correspondence with MIS indexes. In particular there has been a lot of controversy regarding the glaciations MIS 10 and MIS 12, and their correspondence to the Elster and Mindel glaciations of Europe.

<text>The Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary is a Baptist theological institute in Fort Worth, Texas. It is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. It was established in 1908 and in 2005 was one of the largest seminaries in the world. It is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, and the National Association of Schools of Music to award diplomas and bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees.

==History==


SWBTS grew out of the Baylor University theological department, which was established in 1901. By 1905, B. H. Carroll had managed to convert the department of five professors into the Baylor Theological Seminary, but still under Baylor University. In 1907, while Baylor University President Samuel Palmer Brooks was on vacation in Europe, Carroll, then chairman of the Baylor Board of Trustees, made a motion that the department of religion be separated from the university and chartered as a separate entity. The seminary was established in 1908, with Carroll named as its founding president.

The Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary received its charter on March 14, 1908, but remained on Baylor&#x27;s Waco campus until the summer of 1910, when the board accepted an offer made by Fort Worth citizens for a campus site and enough funds to build the first building. The campus was located on what came to be known as &quot;Seminary Hill,&quot; one of the highest natural elevations in Tarrant County. The first building was named &quot;Fort Worth Hall&quot; in honor of the seminary&#x27;s new location. In 1925, the Baptist General Convention of Texas passed control of the seminary to the Southern Baptist Convention.

The Department of Religious Education and the Department of Gospel Music were established within the seminary in 1915. These departments were eventually converted into schools within the seminary in 1921, becoming the School of Gospel Music and the School of Religious Education. As of 2019, the School of Religious Education is now known as the Jack D. Terry School of Educational Ministries, and the School of Gospel Music is now known as the School of Church Music and Worship.

=== Conservative Resurgence: Russell Dilday&#x27;s Dismissal and Ken Hemphill’s Election ===
In March 1994, the seminary experienced a sudden change in leadership with the dismissal of the seminary&#x27;s sixth president, Russell H. Dilday, during the Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence. On March 9, 1994, the board of trustees voted 26 to 7 to dismiss Dilday after 16 years as seminary president. Dilday was called to a board meeting where he was removed without warning and his office was locked while he was still at the meeting, preventing his removal of personal effects. The Associated Press reported that the newly elected trustee chairman stated that the &quot;institution needed new direction for the 21st century.&quot; Students gathered in front of the president&#x27;s home in protest and support for Dilday. The election of Kenneth S. Hemphill as the seminary&#x27;s seventh president followed, and he served the seminary from 1994 to 2003.

=== Recent history (21st century) ===
On June 24, 2003, the board of trustees unanimously elected Paige Patterson as the seminary&#x27;s eighth president. Patterson previously served as president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary for 10 years, thus becoming the second Southern Baptist leader to serve as president for two seminaries within the convention. Patterson also served as the president of the Southern Baptist Convention from 1998 to 2000 and was a leading figure behind the Conservative Resurgence movement within the convention.

In 2006 the seminary imposed a prohibition on professors or administrators promoting charismatic practices, such as private prayer languages.

In 2007 a gender discrimination suit in federal court was filed by Professor Sheri Klouda over her dismissal. Klouda claimed she was dismissed from the faculty due to her gender, being a woman. In response, the seminary commented that Klouda was not dismissed but that she would not have tenure. The Klouda lawsuit was immediately dismissed because of church-state separation-related concerns. The federal judge who dismissed the case stated that &quot;Leaders of a prominent Southern Baptist seminary who believe women are biblically forbidden from teaching men were within their rights when they told a female professor to leave&quot;, including a statement that the seminary was well within its First Amendment rights to dismiss Klouda.

In 2011, a campus was established at the Darrington Unit prison in Brazoria County, Texas. The school has significantly reduced the rate of violence in the prison.

In 2014, the school received criticism from other evangelicals when it admitted its first Muslim student from Palestine. The Muslim student was enrolled in Southwestern&#x27;s PhD program in archaeology. Seminary president Paige Patterson defended his decision to accept the student&#x27;s application, despite criticism.

The School of Preaching was established in 2015 with David L. Allen serving as the first dean. The purpose of the school is to teach students the importance of text-driven preaching. The seminary added two new graduate programs, Master of Arts in Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy in World Christian Studies, in 2016. On April 12, 2017, the executive committee reported to the board of trustees that The college at Southwestern would be renamed in honor of the seminary&#x27;s second president Lee Rutland Scarborough, becoming the L.R. Scarborough College.

In May, Patterson was criticized for his comments and views on women and sexual harassment. On May 22, 2018, after a 13-hour discussion with the trustee board of Southwestern, Patterson was appointed President Emeritus. On May 30, however, the executive committee of the Southwestern trustees voted to remove all benefits provided to Patterson, including the title of President Emeritus. Patterson was immediately fired from SWBTS. D. Jeffrey Bingham, dean of the School of Theology, was subsequently appointed interim president.

On February 27, 2019, Adam W. Greenway was elected by the board of trustees as the ninth president of the seminary. He was the first alumnus since Russell Dilday to serve as president, having earned his Master of Divinity degree from Southwestern Seminary in 2002. Greenway had previously served as dean of the Billy Graham School of Missions, Evangelism and Ministry at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky.

After Greenway’s resignation, David S. Dockery, also an alumnus, was called as interim president on September 27, 2022.

For the year 2021-2022, it had 2,071 students.

===Presidents===
==Administration and faculty==
SWBTS is currently administered by a 40-member board of trustees serving staggered terms of office. Board members are elected by the Southern Baptist Convention. Trustees elect faculty members and administrative officers. Financial support is derived from the Southern Baptist Convention&#x27;s Cooperative Program, endowment earnings, gifts and student fees.

Adam W. Greenway was the ninth president of the seminary. The full-time faculty includes approximately seventy individuals with nearly twice as many part-time and adjunct faculty members.

==Academics==
Aside from theology, the school offers a wide variety of graduate majors such as apologetics, biblical counseling, Christian education, divinity, Islamic studies, missiology, and music.

Since 1908, Southwestern Seminary has graduated more than 44,000 students. Southwestern&#x27;s current student body represents 46 states and 45 countries. The seminary&#x27;s academic journal, &quot;Southwestern Journal of Theology&quot; has been published since 1958. It is conservative and Baptist in orientation.

In the fall of 2005, the seminary converted its undergraduate program into the L.R. Scarborough College, later renamed Texas Baptist College. In 2007 the seminary began an initiative for engaging and transforming culture, its new Center for Cultural Engagement, named in honor of Richard Land. In line with this initiative, the seminary employed prominent intelligent design advocate William A. Dembski. In 2016, the seminary added a master&#x27;s degree program in Philosophy. The program was approved by the board of trustees and, in January 2017, by the accreditation body, the Association of Theological Schools (ATS). Southwestern&#x27;s then President, Paige Patterson, stated &quot;Everybody is a philosopher, the question is are you a good one or a bad one? We are committed to having good philosophers and to making good thinkers and philosophers out of our people.&quot;

In June 2023 the university was placed on Warning status by its educational accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, after the accreditor&#x27;s board found significant non-compliance with its standards for institutional governance, financial resources and financial conflicts of interest.

Southwestern is divided into six schools:

* The School of Theology
* The School of Church Music and Worship
* The Jack D. Terry School of Educational Ministries
* The Roy J. Fish School of Evangelism and Missions
* The Texas Baptist College

===School of Theology===
Established in 1908, the School of Theology trains seminary student for master&#x27;s or doctorate degrees in theology. Concentrations include biblical languages, apologetics, theology, church history, preaching, pastoral ministry, etc. Students are able to obtain a master&#x27;s or doctoral degree designed as an entrypoint into Christian ministry in a variety of contexts. The current interim dean is W. Madison Grace II.

===School of Church Music and Worship===
Originally a department within the School of Theology, the School of Gospel Music was established in 1921. The school was renamed to the School of Sacred Music in 1926, a name which it bore until 1957 when the school was renamed the School of Church Music. In 2019, the school was renamed the School of Church Music and Worship. The current dean of the school is Joseph R. Crider.

===Jack D. Terry School of Educational Ministries===
The Terry School of Educational Ministries offers several different master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees such as the Master of Arts in Christian Education (MACE). The school was originally a department within the School of Theology until the School of Religious Education was established in 1921. The school was renamed to the School of Educational Ministries in 1997. The school was officially renamed in 2009 in honor of Jack D. Terry. Current concentrations provided in this school include biblical counseling, children&#x27;s ministry, collegiate ministry, and student ministries. The current dean is Chris Shirley.

=== Roy J. Fish School of Evangelism and Missions ===
In 2005, the division of evangelism and missions in the School of Theology was reorganized as the Roy J. Fish School of Evangelism and Missions. This division provides students with spiritual &quot;mentorship, a solid theological grounding in Scripture, and coursework that equips&quot; them &quot;to share the Gospel with intelligence, relevance and boldness.&quot; The current dean is John D. Massey.

==Religious beliefs==
The Baptist Faith and Message (2000) is the seminary&#x27;s confessional statement (see the &quot;Southwestern Declaration on Academic and Theological Integrity&quot;). The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy and the Danvers Statement on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood provide further interpretive guidance related to the seminary&#x27;s doctrinal positions on the nature of biblical inspiration and gender roles, respectively.

==Extension Campuses==
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary has its main campus in Fort Worth, but also offers programs and selected degrees at remote campuses. 
*Master of Arts in theology (Bonn, Germany)

== Controversies ==
In 2019, after the scandals of sexual abuse accusations involving the deacon Paul Pressler and sexual abuse cover-ups involving Paige Patterson, the school removed the stained-glass windows from the MacGorman Chapel opened in 2011 depicting them as actors of a &quot;conservative resurgence&quot;.

==Notable people==

<doc id="1008856" wikidata="Q1314481" url="?curid=1008856" title="Ninja Nonsense">
<text>, also known as 2×2 = Shinobuden, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Ryoichi Koga. The series subtitle is &quot;The Nonsense Kunoichi Fiction&quot;. The manga was serialized in MediaWorks&#x27; &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; magazine between August 2000 and March 2006; the chapters were later compiled into four &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. The manga was released in English in North America by Infinity Studios under the title &quot;Ninin Ga Shinobuden&quot;. A 12-episode anime adaptation produced by Ufotable aired in Japan between July and September 2004. The anime has been released in North America by The Right Stuf International under the title &quot;Ninja Nonsense: The Legend of Shinobu&quot;. A sequel manga titled &quot;Ninin ga Shinobuden Plus&quot; began serialization on Kadokawa Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Comic Newtype&quot; website in June 2020.

&quot;Ninja Nonsense&quot; is an absurdist comedy series which follows a young woman named Shinobu as she trains to become a ninja. However, the series does not only focus on ninja training, but also focuses on Shinobu&#x27;s lifestyle and friends through a series of disjointed comedic plot lines. The series uses character designs that favor a soft and rounded look rather than the slender bishōjo style. The original title of the series is based on a pun. In the Japanese numerical system, &quot;ni&quot; is two, and &quot;shi&quot; is four. &quot;Ni&quot; (2) × &quot;ni&quot; (2) = &quot;shi&quot; (4), therefore Ni-ni-n ga Shi-nobuden.

==Plot==
&quot;Ninja Nonsense&quot; is an absurdist comedy centering on Shinobu, a ninja apprentice, who is attempting to pass her ninja exams while Kaede, a normal schoolgirl, studies for her school exams. As a part of her exam, Shinobu is ordered to break into Kaede&#x27;s room to steal her panties by her instructor, Onsokumaru. Shinobu, who despite her enthusiasm, possesses little if any actual ninja skill, believes herself to be invisible and &#x27;sneaks&#x27; into Kaede&#x27;s room. Since Shinobu is perfectly visible to Kaede, the mission does not go as planned. Despite all of this, Kaede takes pity on Shinobu and the two become close friends. Shinobu trains alongside other male ninjas who are identical in appearance, though one is known as Sasuke.

==Characters==
:
: The title character is kind, hardworking, and dedicated, but naive ninja who is somewhat clumsy with complex tasks. She is usually charged with taking care of her dojo, because everyone else is too lazy. She usually wears a purple and pink ninja outfit, but sometimes wears other costumes. Her ambiguous relationship with Kaede, whom she describes as &quot;more than a friend but less than a lover&quot;, ranges from admiration and idolization to romantic interest. Despite the influence of Onsokumaru, she remains fairly innocent.
:
:Kaede is an ordinary high school student attending Shirazuchi High School, Shinobu&#x27;s classmate and the straight man character of the series. She does not allow herself to be tormented and usually puts annoying people in their place. She is often shown making remarks about how Onsokumaru and the male ninja are annoying.
:
:Onsokumaru is a shape-shifting creature; his name roughly translates to &quot;sonic speed ball&quot;. He is usually depicted as a round, yellow sphere with a face, variably with wings or arms, deep voice and a loud temperament. Often, when getting emotional, he will transform into an extremely muscular full human body. In spite of being such a bizarre creature, he is the leader of Shinobu&#x27;s ninja clan. Onsokumaru is perverted, lecherous, messy, loud, a cheat and greedy. He imagines softcore pornographic fantasies about Shinobu and Kaede, either for his own personal pleasure or to enthrall or persuade the male ninja into helping him. On the other hand, he is often friendly and has a silly, playful side.
:
:Miyabi is Shinobu&#x27;s younger sister who has chosen the field of &quot;magical summoning&quot; rather than ninjutsu. She mutally dislikes Onsokumaru and believes that her elder sister should switch fields and become a magical summoner like herself. Though just ten years old, she is something of a prodigy and is skilled enough to consistently defeat Onsokumaru when he gets on her nerves.
: (Japanese), David Wills (ep 1-3), Jason Linder (ep 4-12) (English)
:Sasuke is the class president of the Igumi Ninja Academy. Sasuke is sometimes easy to spot, but he is one of the dozens of faceless male ninja in the series. These male ninja are seen in different outfits, but never without their masks. Onsokumaru and Shinobu seem able to tell them apart. They share many of Onsokumaru&#x27;s traits, although they are more kindhearted and conscientious, attempting to act noble and wise. They often join in on Onsokumaru&#x27;s perverted schemes, but have shown a distaste for certain levels he will go to. The ninja have even more than once joined together to punish Onsokumaru when he goes too far. They have a tendency to act with a hive mind, but are easily distracted and get little done. Sasuke and some of the other male ninja form the &quot;Miyabi Fan Club&quot;.

==Media==
===Manga===
The manga is written and illustrated by Ryoichi Koga. It was serialized in MediaWorks&#x27; &quot;shōnen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; between the August 2000 and March 2006 issues. The chapters were collected into four &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes under the Dengeki Comics EX imprint between February 2002 and May 2006. The manga is released in English in North America under the title &quot;Ninin Ga Shinobuden&quot; by Infinity Studios, who released the volumes between May 2006 and April 2008. A sequel manga titled &quot;Ninin ga Shinobuden Plus&quot; began serialization on Kadokawa Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Comic Newtype&quot; website on June 26, 2020. As of October 2022, the chapters have been collected into two &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes.

===Drama CDs===
A drama CD based on the manga titled &quot;Ninpō Drama CD Ninin ga Shinobuden: Bloom&quot; was released in May 2003. Three more drama CDs were released between June and October 2004 alongside the anime and feature the same cast as the anime. Although most of the cast from the original drama CD was different, Norio Wakamoto was the only voice actor who retained his voice in the anime as Onsokumaru. A fifth drama CD was included as a bonus CD for the &quot;fandisc&quot; DVD released in Japan in 2005.

===Anime===
A 12-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Ufotable and directed by Hitoyuki Matsui, aired between July 8 and September 23, 2004 on Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting in Japan. The anime&#x27;s opening theme is by Kiyomi Kumano and the ending theme is by Kaoru. An insert song used in episode five is titled by Nana Mizuki. The English dub was produced by NYAV Post, with Marc Diraison and Michael Sinterniklaas as voice directors. It was released by Right Stuf in North America originally across four DVD volumes from July 25 to November 28, 2006 under their Nozomi Entertainment label. A DVD box set was released on December 7, 2007 and was re-released with bonus materials on June 8, 2010. A Blu-ray collection was released on January 2, 2018. In 2020, Frontier Works re-released the anime television series to celebrate the manga&#x27;s 20th anniversary.






==Reception==
The anime series of &quot;Ninja Nonsense&quot; has received generally favorable reviews since its release by Right Stuf Inc. in North America. Positive reception has been given regarding its gag style comedy, the animation, and the cast of characters. &quot;T.H.E.M Anime&quot; rated the anime 4 out of 5 stars, saying that &quot;&quot;Ninja Nonsense&quot; is hardly highbrow stuff, but it&#x27;s clever enough to be amusing and just up the alley of those who want a good gag-laden comedy.&quot; Carl Kimlinger, from &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, praised the anime for its varied animation styles as well as its quality, stating that, &quot;The only constants are that, no matter what style of animation used, no matter how distorted or wild the art, it is always appropriate to the joke or mood of the moment.&quot; Furthermore, Kimlinger also credited the characters for their dynamic nature, however advised that marathoning the series can be difficult due to its pacing. In his review on &quot;The Fandom Post&quot;, Chris Beveridge credited the series for the twists it made to its episodic plots that would be cliche in its &quot;slice of life&quot; genre, highlighting funny moments from certain episodes, including the final episode, calling it &quot;...a very satisfying close.&quot; Paul Jensen wrote that the show had a &quot;narrow focus on absurd screwball humor, but did it very well&quot; in his review for Anime News Network. Jensen also called the English dub noteworthy and praised Sean Schemmel&#x27;s take on Onsokumaru.

<text>In the arts, bricolage (French for &quot;DIY&quot; or &quot;do-it-yourself projects&quot;; ) is the construction or creation of a work from a diverse range of things that happen to be available, or a work constructed using mixed media.

The term &quot;bricolage&quot; has also been used in many other fields, including anthropology, philosophy, critical theory, education, computer software, public health, and business.

==Origin==
&quot;Bricolage&quot; is a French loanword that means the process of improvisation in a human endeavor. The word is derived from the French verb &quot;bricoler&quot; (&quot;to tinker&quot;), with the English term DIY (&quot;Do-it-yourself&quot;) being the closest equivalent of the contemporary French usage. In both languages, &quot;bricolage&quot; also denotes any works or products of DIY endeavors.

==The arts==

===Visual art===

In art, bricolage is a technique or creative mode, where works are constructed from various materials available or on hand, and is often seen as a characteristic of postmodern art practice. It has been likened to the concept of curating and has also been described as the remixture, reconstruction, and reuse of separate materials or artifacts to produce new meanings and insights.

===Architecture===
Bricolage is considered the jumbled effect produced by the close proximity of buildings from different periods and in different architectural styles.

It is also a term that is admiringly applied to the architectural work of Le Corbusier, by Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter in their book &quot;Collage City&quot;, whom they called &quot;a fox in hedgehog disguise,&quot; commenting on his wily approach to assembling ideas from found objects of the history of architecture, in contrast to Frank Lloyd Wright, who is called a &quot;hedgehog&quot; for being overly focused on a narrow concept.

==Academics==

===Anthropology===
In anthropology, the term has been used in several ways. Most notably, Claude Lévi-Strauss invoked the concept of bricolage to refer to the process that leads to the creation of mythical thought, which &quot;expresses itself by means of a heterogeneous repertoire which, even if extensive, is nevertheless limited. It has to use this repertoire, however, whatever the task in hand because it has nothing else at its disposal&quot;. Later, Hervé Varenne and Jill Koyama used the term when explaining the processual aspect of culture, i.e., education 

===Literature===
In literature, bricolage is affected by intertextuality, the shaping of a text&#x27;s meanings by reference to other texts.

===Cultural studies===
In cultural studies, bricolage is used to mean the processes by which people acquire objects from across social divisions to create new cultural identities. In particular, it is a feature of subcultures such as the punk movement. Here, objects that possess one meaning (or no meaning) in the dominant culture are acquired and given a new, often subversive meaning. For example, the safety pin became a form of decoration in punk culture.

===Social psychology===
The term &quot;psychological bricolage&quot; is used to explain the mental processes through which an individual develops novel solutions to problems by making use of previously unrelated knowledge or ideas they already possess. 
The term, introduced by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Matthew J. Karlesky and Fiona Lee The Oxford Handbook of Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship of the University of Michigan, draws from two separate disciplines. The first, &quot;social bricolage,&quot; was introduced by cultural anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss in 1962. Lévi-Strauss was interested in how societies create novel solutions by using resources that already exist in the collective social consciousness. The second, &quot;creative cognition,&quot; is an intra-psychic approach to studying how individuals retrieve and recombine knowledge in new ways. Psychological bricolage, therefore, refers to the cognitive processes that enable individuals to retrieve and recombine previously unrelated knowledge they already possess. Psychological bricolage is an intra-individual process akin to Karl E. Weick&#x27;s notion of bricolage in organizations, which is akin to Lévi-Strauss&#x27; notion of bricolage in societies.

===Philosophy===
In his book &quot;The Savage Mind&quot; (1962, English translation 1966), French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss used &quot;bricolage&quot; to describe the characteristic patterns of mythological thought. In his description it is opposed to the engineers&#x27; creative thinking, which proceeds from goals to means. Mythical thought, according to Lévi-Strauss, attempts to re-use available materials in order to solve new problems.

Jacques Derrida extends this notion to any discourse. &quot;If one calls &quot;bricolage&quot; the necessity of borrowing one&#x27;s concept from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, it must be said that every discourse is &quot;bricoleur&quot;.&quot;

Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, in their 1972 book &quot;Anti-Oedipus&quot;, identify &quot;bricolage&quot; as the characteristic mode of production of the schizophrenic producer.

===Education===
In the discussion of constructionism, Seymour Papert discusses two styles of solving problems. Contrary to the analytical style of solving problems, he describes bricolage as a way to learn and solve problems by trying, testing, playing around.

Joe L. Kincheloe and Shirley R. Steinberg have used the term bricolage in educational research to denote the use of multiperspectival research methods. In Kincheloe&#x27;s conception of the research bricolage, diverse theoretical traditions are employed in a broader critical theoretical/critical pedagogical context to lay the foundation for a transformative mode of multimethodological inquiry. Using these multiple frameworks and methodologies, researchers are empowered to produce more rigorous and praxiological insights into socio-political and educational phenomena.

Kincheloe and Steinberg theorize a critical multilogical epistemology and critical connected ontology to ground the research bricolage. These philosophical notions provide the research bricolage with a sophisticated understanding of the complexity of knowledge production and the interrelated complexity of both researcher positionality and phenomena in the world. Such complexity demands a more rigorous mode of research that is capable of dealing with the complications of socio-educational experience. Such a critical form of rigor avoids the reductionism of many monological, mimetic research orientations (see Kincheloe, 2001, 2005; Kincheloe &amp; Berry, 2004; Steinberg, 2015; Kincheloe, McLaren, &amp; Steinberg, 2012).

==Information technology==

===Information systems===
In information systems, bricolage is used by Claudio Ciborra to describe the way in which strategic information systems (SIS) can be built in order to maintain successful competitive advantage over a longer period of time than standard SIS. By valuing tinkering and allowing SIS to evolve from the bottom-up, rather than implementing it from the top-down, the firm will end up with something that is deeply rooted in the organisational culture that is specific to that firm and is much less easily imitated.

===Internet===
In her book &quot;Life on the Screen&quot; (1995), Sherry Turkle discusses the concept of bricolage as it applies to problem solving in code projects and workspace productivity. She advocates the &quot;bricoleur style&quot; of programming as a valid and underexamined alternative to what she describes as the conventional structured &quot;planner&quot; approach. In this style of coding, the programmer works without an exhaustive preliminary specification, opting instead for a step-by-step growth and re-evaluation process. In her essay &quot;Epistemological Pluralism&quot;, Turkle writes: &quot;The bricoleur resembles the painter who stands back between brushstrokes, looks at the canvas, and only after this contemplation, decides what to do next.&quot;

==Visual arts==
The visual arts is a field in which individuals often integrate a variety of knowledge sets in order to produce inventive work. To reach this stage, artists read print materials across a wide array of disciplines, as well as information from their own social identities. For instance, the artist Shirin Neshat has integrated her identities as an Iranian exile and a woman in order to make complex, creative and critical bodies of work. This willingness to integrate diverse knowledge sets enables artists with multiple identities to fully leverage their knowledge sets. This is demonstrated by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Chi-Ying Chen and Fiona Lee, who found that individuals were shown to exhibit greater levels of innovation in tasks related to their cultural identities when they successfully integrated those identities.

==Business==
Karl Weick identifies the following requirements for successful bricolage in organizations.
*Intimate knowledge of resources
*Careful observation and listening
*Trusting one&#x27;s ideas
*Self-correcting structures, with feedback
Glenn Gosnell, V &amp; E Limited, defines the formal term &quot;Bricoleurologist&quot;, as indicating expertise and experience in Bricoleurology, i.e. devising and implementing elegant solutions to immediate problems and issues. Those skilled in the art and practice of AMA (Alternate Means of Accomplishment) in the efficient and effective reconstitution of resources can be assigned the title &quot;Bricoleurologist&quot; by a company or institution.

==In popular culture==

===Fashion===
In his essay &quot;Subculture: The Meaning of Style&quot;, Dick Hebdige discusses how an individual can be identified as a bricoleur when they &quot;appropriated another range of commodities by placing them in a symbolic ensemble which served to erase or subvert their original straight meanings&quot;. The fashion industry uses bricolage-like styles by incorporating items typically utilized for other purposes.

===Television===
* &quot;MacGyver&quot; is a television series in which the protagonist is the paragon of a bricoleur, creating solutions for the problem to be solved out of immediately available found objects.

<text>Khalil Ibrahim al-Wazir (, also known by his &quot;kunya&quot; Abu Jihad —&quot;Jihad&#x27;s Father&quot;; 10 October 1935 – 16 April 1988) was a Palestinian leader and co-founder of the nationalist party Fatah. As a top aide of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat, al-Wazir had considerable influence in Fatah&#x27;s military activities, eventually becoming the commander of Fatah&#x27;s armed wing al-Assifa.

Al-Wazir became a refugee when his family was expelled from Ramla during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and began leading a minor &quot;fedayeen&quot; force in the Gaza Strip. In the early 1960s he established connections for Fatah with Communist regimes and prominent third-world leaders. He opened Fatah&#x27;s first bureau in Algeria. He played an important role in the 1970–71 Black September clashes in Jordan, by supplying besieged Palestinian fighters with weapons and aid. Following the PLO&#x27;s defeat by the Jordanian Army, al-Wazir joined the PLO in Lebanon.

Prior to and during Israel&#x27;s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, al-Wazir planned numerous attacks inside Israel against both civilian and military targets. He prepared Beirut&#x27;s defense against incoming Israeli forces. Nonetheless, the Israeli military prevailed and al-Wazir was exiled from Lebanon with the rest of the Fatah leadership. He settled in Amman for a two-year period and was then exiled to Tunis in 1986. From his base there, he started to organize youth committees in the Palestinian territories; these eventually formed a major component of the Palestinian forces in the First Intifada. However, he did not live to command the uprising. On 16 April 1988, he was assassinated at his home in Tunis by Israeli commandos.

==Early life==
Khalil al-Wazir was born in 1935 to Muslim parents in the city of Ramla, Palestine, then under British Mandatory rule. His father, Ibrahim al-Wazir, worked as a grocer in the city. Al-Wazir and his family were expelled in July 1948, along with another 50,000–70,000 Palestinians from Lydda and Ramla, following Israel&#x27;s capture of the area during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. They settled in the Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, where al-Wazir attended a secondary school run by UNRWA. While in high school, he began organizing a small group of &quot;fedayeen&quot; to harass Israelis at military posts near the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula.

In 1954 he came into contact with Yasser Arafat in Gaza; al-Wazir would become Arafat&#x27;s right-hand man later in his life. During his time in Gaza, al-Wazir became a member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and was briefly imprisoned for his membership with the organization, as it was prohibited in Egypt. In 1956, a few months after his release from prison, he received military training in Cairo. He also studied architectural engineering at the University of Alexandria, but he did not graduate. Al-Wazir was detained once again in 1957 for leading raids against Israel and was exiled to Saudi Arabia, finding work as a schoolteacher. He continued to teach after moving to Kuwait in 1959.

==Formation of Fatah==
Al-Wazir used his time in Kuwait to further his ties with Arafat and other fellow Palestinian exiles he had met in Egypt. He and his comrades founded Fatah, a Palestinian nationalist guerrilla and political organization, sometime between 1959 and 1960. He moved to Beirut after being put in charge of editing the newly formed organization&#x27;s monthly magazine &quot;Falastinuna, Nida&#x27; Al Hayat&quot; (&quot;Our Palestine, the Call to Life&quot;), as he was &quot;the only one with a flair for writing.&quot; The magazine was established by Arafat and Al Wazir in November 1959.

Al Wazir settled in Algeria in 1962, after a delegation of Fatah leaders, including Arafat and Farouk Kaddoumi, were invited there by Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella. Al-Wazir remained there, opened a Fatah office and military training camp in Algiers and was included in an Algerian-Fatah delegation to Beijing in 1964. During his visit, he presented Fatah&#x27;s ideas to various leaders of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, including premier Zhou Enlai, and thus inaugurated Fatah&#x27;s good relationship with China. He also toured other East Asian countries, establishing relations with North Korea and the Viet Cong. Al-Wazir supposedly &quot;charmed Che Guevara&quot; during Guevara&#x27;s speech in Algiers. With his guerrilla credentials and his contacts with arms-supplying nations, he was assigned the role of recruiting and training fighters, thus establishing Fatah&#x27;s armed wing &quot;al-Assifa&quot; (the Storm). While in Algiers, he recruited Abu Ali Iyad who became his deputy and one of the high-ranking commanders of al-Assifa in Syria and Jordan.

===Syria and post-Six-Day War===
Al-Wazir and the Fatah leadership settled in Damascus, Syria in 1965, in order take advantage of the large number of Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) members there. On 9 May 1966, he and Arafat were detained by Syrian police loyal to air marshal Hafez al-Assad after an incident where a pro-Syrian Palestinian leader, Yusuf Orabi was thrown out of the window of a three-story building and killed. Al-Wazir and Arafat were either considering uniting Fatah with Orabi&#x27;s faction—the Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Palestine—or winning Orabi&#x27;s support against Arafat&#x27;s rivals within the Fatah leadership. An argument occurred, eventually leading to Orabi&#x27;s murder; however, al-Wazir and Arafat had already left the scene shortly before the incident. According to Aburish, Orabi and Assad were &quot;close friends&quot; and Assad appointed a panel to investigate what happened. The panel found both Arafat and al-Wazir guilty, but Salah Jadid, then deputy secretary-general of the president of Syria, pardoned them.

After the defeat of a coalition of Arab states in the 1967 Six-Day War, major Palestinian guerrilla organizations that participated in the war or were sponsored by any of the involved Arab states, such as the Arab Nationalist Movement led by George Habash and the Palestine Liberation Army of Ahmad Shukeiri, lost considerable influence among the Palestinian population. This made Fatah the dominant faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They gained 33 of 105 seats in the Palestinian National Council (PNC) (the most seats allocated to any guerrilla group), thus strengthening al-Wazir&#x27;s position. During the Battle of Karameh, in March 1968, he and Salah Khalaf held important command positions among Fatah fighters against the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which developed his credentials as a military strategist. This eventually led to him taking command of &quot;al-Assifa&quot;, holding major positions in the PNC, and the Supreme Military Council of the PLO. He was also put in charge of guerrilla warfare operations in both the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel proper.

==Black September and the Lebanon War==

During the Black September clashes in Jordan, al-Wazir supplied the encircled Palestinian forces in Jerash and Ajlun with arms and aid, but the conflict was decided in Jordan&#x27;s favor. After Arafat and thousands of Fatah fighters retreated to Lebanon, al-Wazir negotiated an agreement between King Hussein and the PLO&#x27;s leading organizer, calling for better Palestinian conduct in Jordan. Then, along with the other PLO leaders, he relocated to Beirut.

Al-Wazir did not play a major role in the Lebanese Civil War; he confined himself primarily to strengthening the Lebanese National Movement, the PLO&#x27;s main ally in the conflict. During the fall of the Tel al-Zaatar camp to the Lebanese Front, al-Wazir blamed himself for not organizing a rescue effort.

During his time in Lebanon, al-Wazir was responsible for coordinating high-profile operations. He allegedly planned the Savoy Hotel attack in 1975, in which eight Fatah militants raided and took civilian hostages in the Savoy hotel in Tel Aviv, killing eight of them, as well as three Israeli soldiers. The Coastal Road massacre, in March 1978, was also planned by al-Wazir. In this attack, six Fatah members hijacked a bus and killed 35 Israeli civilians. Other attacks he was implicated in include the 1974 Nahariya attack, the Zion Square refrigerator bombing, and the 1980 Hebron attack.

When Israel besieged Beirut in 1982, al-Wazir, disagreed with the PLO&#x27;s leftist members and Salah Khalaf; he proposed that the PLO pull out of Beirut. Nevertheless, al-Wazir and his aide Abu al-Walid planned Beirut&#x27;s defense and helped direct PLO forces against the IDF. PLO forces were eventually defeated and then expelled from Lebanon, with most of the leadership relocating to Tunis, although al-Wazir and 264 other PLO members were received by King Hussein of Jordan.

==Establishing a movement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip==
Dissatisfied at the decisive defeat of Palestinian forces in Lebanon during the 1982 Lebanon War, al-Wazir concentrated on establishing a solid Fatah base in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. In 1982, he began to sponsor youth committees in the territories. These organizations would grow and initiate the First Intifada in December 1987 (the word &quot;Intifada&quot; in Arabic, literally translated as &quot;shaking off&quot;, is generally used to describe an uprising or revolt).

The Intifada began as an uprising of Palestinian youth against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. On 7 June 1986, about a year before the Intifada started, al-Wazir was deported from Amman to Baghdad, eventually moving to Tunisia days after King Hussein declared that efforts in establishing a joint strategy for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict between Jordan and the PLO were over.

The first stage of the Intifada took place upon escalation of two unrelated incidents in the Gaza Strip. The first was a traffic incident at the Erez checkpoint, where an Israeli military vehicle hit a group of Palestinian laborers, killing four of them. The funerals, attended by 10,000 people from the camp that evening, quickly led to a large demonstration. Rumours swept the camp that the incident was an act of intentional retaliation for the second event - stabbing to death of an Israeli businessman, killed while shopping in Gaza two days earlier. Following the throwing of a petrol bomb at a passing patrol car in the Gaza Strip on the following day, Israeli forces, firing with live ammunition and tear gas canisters into angry crowds, shot one young Palestinian dead and wounded 16 others.

However, within weeks, following persistent requests by al-Wazir, the PLO attempted to direct the uprising, which lasted until 1991, or 1993, according to various authorities. Al-Wazir had been assigned by Arafat the responsibility of the territories within the PLO command. According to author Said Aburish, he had &quot;impressive knowledge of local conditions&quot; in the Israeli-occupied territories, apparently knowing &quot;every village, school, and large family in Gaza and the West Bank&quot;. He provided the uprising with financial backing and logistical support, thus becoming its &quot;brain in exile&quot;. Al-Wazir activated every cell he had set up in the territories since the late 1970s in an effort to militarily back the stone-throwers who formed the backbone of the Palestinian revolt. He also used the opportunity to reform the PLO. According to author Yezid Sayigh, al-Wazir believed that the Intifada should not have been sacrificed to Arafat solely for use as a diplomatic or political tool.

==Assassination==
Al-Wazir was assassinated in an Israeli commando raid in his home in Tunis on the early morning of 16 April 1988 at the age of 52. The Israeli government had decided to assassinate him after the outbreak of the First Intifada. Israel accused al-Wazir of escalating the violence of the Intifada, which was ongoing at the time of his assassination. The Mothers&#x27; Bus attack, a March 1988 hijacking of an Israeli bus believed to have been organized by Al-Wazir in which three Israeli civilians were killed, was a major catalyst in pushing the Israeli government to approve the assassination.

In his book &quot;Rise and Kill First&quot;, which was based on interviews with Israeli military and intelligence personnel, Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman provided a detailed account of the assassination. The Israeli security cabinet under Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir met on 14 March 1988 to discuss assassinating him. Although Shamir could have given the order on his own, he was aware of the potential ramifications of assassinating such a high-profile figure and did not want to take sole responsibility. The security cabinet approved the assassination by a vote of 6 to 4. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported on 21 April that the Israeli cabinet approved al-Wazir&#x27;s assassination on 13 April.

The assassination, codenamed Operation Introductory Lesson, had been planned by the Mossad for over a year. Mossad agents had scouted routes to his home from the nearby beach and mapped his neighborhood. The Mossad and Israeli military intelligence had tracked his movements and tapped his telephone lines. Under the plan, a naval flotilla backed by air cover would land commandos on the Tunisian coast, where they would be driven to his home by waiting Mossad agents and kill him. Ehud Barak, the IDF Deputy Chief of Staff, was placed in overall command of the operation.

On 14 April, six Mossad operatives arrived in Tunis on flights from Europe. Three of them rented two Volkswagen Transporters and a Peugeot 305, which would be used to ferry the raiding force from the beach to his home. Another three were deployed as lookouts, positioning themselves behind a clump of trees to monitor his home and ensure that he was there. Under the plan, the drivers would evacuate by sea with the commandos while the lookouts would leave Tunisia on commercial flights after the operation.

At the same time, an Israeli Navy flotilla sailed towards Tunisia, halting 25 miles off the Tunisian coast on 15 April. It consisted of five missile boats carrying 33 Sayeret Matkal and Shayetet 13 commandos along with a mobile hospital and communications equipment, a larger vessel disguised as a cargo ship and fitted out as a helicopter carrier with a reserve Sayeret Matkal unit ready to intervene if the operation went awry, and the Gal-class submarine INS &quot;Gal&quot; providing an underwater escort. The Israeli Air Force provided cover overhead with a Boeing 707 communications aircraft to serve as a communications relay, monitor Tunisian communications, and stand by to jam Tunisian radar and air control if needed, and F-15 fighter jets patrolling off the Tunisian coast ready to provide backup.

At dusk on 15 April, after the INS &quot;Gal&quot; surveyed the shore and reported that the beach was deserted, the commando force headed out towards the shore in rubber dinghies. As they approached the beach, seven Shayetet 13 commandos led by Yoav Galant dived into the water and swam onto the beach, where they created a perimeter, established radio contact with the waiting Mossad drivers and told them to approach the shore, and cleared the rest of the commandos to land. The Sayeret Matkal commandos linked up with the Mossad drivers and changed into dry clothes they carried in waterproof bags; they would infiltrate Al-Wazir&#x27;s neighborhood dressed as civilians, including some disguised as women. The Shayetet 13 commandos remained on the beach to keep it secure for the evacuation. Meanwhile, Al-Wazir arrived at home just after midnight with two bodyguards, and was observed by the Mossad lookouts watching his house. He then took a phone call from an aide who informed him he had a seat reserved on a flight to Baghdad at a little over 3:00 AM. Israeli intelligence had been monitoring the call. While it had been originally intended to enter his home at 1:30 AM, it was deemed likely that he would be on his way to the airport by then, and it was decided to execute the mission immediately.

The two Volkswagen Transporters, which carried the commando team, then set out. Two Mossad operatives drove the Peugeot 305 ahead of them to scout the route for the attacking force and ensure they would not run into any unexpected obstacles. The three vehicles stopped a few hundred yards from Al-Wazir&#x27;s home. As the commandos advanced, a final effort was made to positively confirm his presence, as the report by the Mossad lookouts was not considered sufficient evidence. A phone call was placed to his home through an exchange in Italy, the means by which he generally communicated with personnel in the Palestinian territories, and a conversation was initiated with him while three Arabic-speaking soldiers from Unit 8200 in the operation&#x27;s command bunker in Tel Aviv who had extensively studied his voice monitored the conversation. After each of them confirmed that the voice was Al-Wazir&#x27;s, the command bunker in Tel Aviv then radioed the seaborne command post that the operation could proceed.

After receiving final approval for the operation, the Sayeret Matkal force, led by Major Nahum Lev, then went into action. Lev and another soldier disguised as a woman approached one of his bodyguards who was sitting in a car next to the house, showed him a hotel brochure and asked him how to get there, then shot him as he studied the brochure. A group of commandos then moved forward and opened the door with a hydraulic jack while the rest of the force surrounded the house. Commandos then entered the home. Some went into the basement where they killed the second bodyguard and the family&#x27;s gardener who was sleeping there. Al-Wazir was found upstairs and killed, with the commandos taking turns firing into his body after he fell. He was shot a total of 52 times. The entire raid, from the killing of the guard in the car in front of his house to the commandos returning to the vehicles to make their getaway, took five minutes.

The raiding force then evacuated to the beach and returned to the missile boats. The local police were distracted by multiple false reports placed by Mossad agents of a convoy of cars racing from Al-Wazir&#x27;s neighborhood towards downtown Tunis - the opposite direction from the one taken by the raiding force.

According to other accounts, he was shot on the landing of his house by a commando who pursued him upstairs when he ran there after hearing the shots that killed two security guards outside. A different version has it he was working on a memo to leaders of the Intifada, and only had time to fire off one shot from his pistol when the assassination squad burst into his rooms. He was shot at close range, reportedly 70 times, in the presence of his wife Intissar and his son Nidal, above whose bed a commando then fired a burst of automatic fire as a warning. Another account posits that the assassins gained entry to the PLO compound via IDs stolen from kidnapped Lebanese fishermen. 

Following his assassination, riots immediately broke out in the Palestinian territories, and at least a dozen Palestinians were shot dead in the worst show of violence since the outbreak of the uprising. He was buried in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus on 21 April; Arafat led the funeral procession.

In 2012, Israel unofficially confirmed that it was responsible for his assassination, after an interview Ronen Bergman conducted with Nahum Lev was cleared for publication – its release had been blocked by military censors for more than a decade. In that interview, Lev gave Bergman a detailed account of the operation.

The United States Department of State condemned his killing as an &quot;act of political assassination&quot;. The UN Security Council approved Resolution 611 condemning &quot;the aggression perpetrated against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Tunisia&quot;, without specifically mentioning Israel.

==Personal life==
Al-Wazir married his cousin Intissar al-Wazir in 1962 and had five children with her. They had three sons, named Jihad, Bassem and Nidal, and two daughters, named Iman and Hanan al-Wazir. Intissar and her children returned to Gaza following the Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO and in 1996 she became the first female minister in the Palestinian National Authority. Intissar later became head of the Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund, the organization that provides stipends to the families of Palestinians killed or wounded during confrontations with Israeli authorities. His son Jihad al-Wazir is formerly the governor of the Palestinian Monetary Authority and currently works for the International Monetary Fund. 

After Hamas&#x27; takeover of the Gaza Strip in 2007, looters raided al-Wazir&#x27;s home, reportedly stealing his personal belongings. Intissar al-Wazir said that the looting &quot;occurred in broad daylight and under the watchful eye of Hamas militiamen.&quot;

In 2014, the Palestinian Authority named a forest in the West Bank as the Martyr Khalil Al-Wazir Forest.

<doc id="1008882" wikidata="Q984402" url="?curid=1008882" title="James Thomson (poet, born 1834)">
<text>James Thomson (23 November 1834 – 3 June 1882) — pen name Bysshe Vanolis — was a Scottish journalist, poet, and translator. He is remembered for &quot;The City of Dreadful Night&quot; (1874; 1880), a poetic allegory of urban suffering and despair. His pen name derives from the names of the poets Shelley and Novalis; both strong influences on him as a writer. Thomson&#x27;s essays were written mainly for &quot;National Reformer&quot;, &quot;Secular Review&quot;, and &quot;Cope&#x27;s Tobacco Plant&quot;. His longer poems include &quot;The Doom of a City&quot; (1854) in four parts, &quot;Vane&#x27;s Story&quot; (1865), and the Orientalist ballad &quot;Weddah and Om-El-Bonain&quot;. He admired and translated the works of the Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi and Heinrich Heine. In the title of his biography of Thomson, Bertram Dobell dubbed him &quot;the Laureate of Pessimism&quot;.

==Life==
Thomson was born in Port Glasgow, Scotland, and, at the age of eight (after his sister died and his father suffered a stroke), he was sent to London where he was raised in an orphanage, the Royal Caledonian Asylum on Chalk Road (later Caledonian Road after the asylum) near Holloway. At around this time, his mother died.

He was trained as an army schoolmaster at the Royal Military Asylum in Chelsea and served in Ireland, where in 1851, at the age of 17, he made the acquaintance of 18-year-old Charles Bradlaugh, who was already known as a freethinker, having published his first atheist pamphlet a year earlier.

More than a decade later, Thomson quit the military and moved to London, where he worked as a clerk. He remained in communication with Bradlaugh, who was by now issuing his own weekly &quot;National Reformer&quot;, a &quot;publication for the working man&quot;. For the remaining 19 years of his life, starting in 1863, Thomson submitted stories, essays and poems to the &quot;National Reformer&quot; and other periodicals. From 1866 onwards he lived in a single room, first in Pimlico and then in Bloomsbury.

Thomson&#x27;s most famous literary work, the poem &quot;The City of Dreadful Night&quot;, was composed from January 1870 to October 1873. It was first published in serial form in the &quot;National Reformer&quot; in the spring of 1874. The poem was reprinted in &quot;The City of Dreadful Night and Other Poems&quot; (1880) and elicited encouraging and complimentary reviews from a number of critics.

Thomson died in London at the age of 47, from a broken blood vessel in his bowel, and was buried in the east side of Highgate Cemetery in the grave of his friend, the freethinker, Austin Holyoake. The inscription on his grave states that he was born in 1831, not 1834.

==Legacy==
In 1889, seven years after Thomson&#x27;s death, Henry Stephens Salt published the first biography of Thomson, with a selection of writings, &quot;The Life of James Thomson (&quot;B.V.&quot;)&quot;. In 1910, Bertram Dobell published a second biography, &quot;The Laureate of Pessimism: a Sketch of the Life of James Thomson&quot;. In 1993, Tom Leonard&#x27;s biographical study &quot;Places of the Mind: The Life and Work of James Thomson (&#x27;B. V.&#x27;)&quot; of Thomson was published by the London publisher Jonathan Cape. In recent years, Thomson&#x27;s poems have rarely been anthologised, although the autobiographical &quot;Insomnia&quot; and &quot;Sunday at Hampstead&quot; have been well-regarded and include some striking passages.

<text>Me Mom and Morgentaler were a Canadian third wave ska band based in Montreal, Quebec. The band members included Gus &quot;Van Go&quot; Coriandoli, Kim Bingham, John Jordan, Adam &quot;Baltimore Bix&quot; Berger, Kasia Hering, Sid Zanforlin, Matt Lipscombe, Noah Green, Diane White, and John &quot;JB&quot; Britton. They were known for their elaborate live performances, spectacles of vaudevillian-styled performance art with leftist leanings. They sang in both English and French.

==History==
The band formed in 1988. They chose their name, with its reference to Henry Morgentaler, a doctor and pro-choice activist, before performing at a talent show at Marianopolis College where nuns worked.

In 1991 the band released an EP, &quot;Clown Heaven &amp; Hell&quot;. In 1993 they released a studio album, &quot;Shiva Space Machine&quot;, and in 1994 a live album, &quot;We Are Revolting&quot;, was released.

The band broke up in 1996. Green went on to join NYC-based nerdcore hip hop band 2 Skinnee J&#x27;s, taking the stage name J Guevara. Coriandoli also moved to New York, where he became involved in rock music production and opened a studio in Brooklyn. Bingham went on to a solo career, releasing an EP as Mudgirl before reverting to her own name for future releases.

===Reunions===
The band played a one-off reunion show at the Montreal International Jazz Festival in 1999, and later reunited in late 2007 for a series of four Montreal shows in support of the re-release of &quot;Shiva Space Machine&quot;. The new CD offered re-ordered, remixed versions of the band&#x27;s classics, along with three unreleased live tracks.

==Awards==
In 2007 Me Mom and Morgentaler was presented with a Tribute Award at the Quebec Independent Music Awards.

<text>Milton Glaser (June 26, 1929June 26, 2020) was an American graphic designer, recognized for his designs, including the I Love New York logo; a 1966 poster for Bob Dylan; the logos for DC Comics, Stony Brook University, Brooklyn Brewery; and his graphic work on the introduction of the iconic 1969 Olivetti Valentine typewriter.

In 1954, he also co-founded Push Pin Studios, co-founded &quot;New York&quot; magazine with Clay Felker, and established Milton Glaser, Inc. In 1969, he produced and designed &quot;Short Subject&quot;, commonly known as &quot;Mickey Mouse in Vietnam&quot;, a short 16mm anti-war film directed by Whitney Lee Savage (father of Adam Savage). His artwork has been featured in exhibits, and placed in permanent collections in many museums worldwide. Throughout his long career, he designed many posters, publications and architectural designs. He received many awards for his work, including the National Medal of the Arts award from President Barack Obama in 2009 and was the first graphic designer to receive this award.

==Life and career==

Glaser was born in The Bronx, New York City. His parents, Eugene and Eleanor (née Bergman), were Hungarian Jewish immigrants. The family resided in the South Bronx. His father owned a dry-cleaning and tailoring shop; his mother was a homemaker. Glaser took drawing classes with artists Raphael and Moses Soyer before attending the High School of Music &amp; Art in Manhattan.

After graduating from the Cooper Union in New York City, Reynold Ruffins, Seymour Chwast, Edward Sorel and Glaser founded Push Pin Studios in 1954. Glaser joined after his return from Italy. In 1957, the &quot;Push Pin Monthly Graphic&quot; was sent out to friends and clients. The studio&#x27;s work rejected tradition and favored &quot;reinvigorated interpretations of historical styles&quot;. Glaser and Seymour Chwast directed Push Pin Studios for twenty years, while it became a guiding reference in the world of graphic design. The studio &quot;redefined and expanded the imprimatur of the designer, illustrator, and visual culture at large&quot;.

Glaser started his own design firm, Milton Glaser Inc., in 1974 and left Push Pin Studios the following year. In 1983, Glaser formed a partnership with Walter Bernard and established a publication design firm called WBMG in New York City. WBMG has designed more than 50 magazines, newspapers and periodicals around the world.

Over his career, Glaser personally designed and illustrated more than 400 posters. Milton drew heavily from early 20th century artists to create his own signature style that consisted of playful, psychedelic graphics with controlled blasts of colors along with silhouettes and bold geometric outlines. His work is displayed in the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum, New York; the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; and the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. His work has also been featured in exhibits internationally. He had one-man shows at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

In 1988, Glaser designed the New York City Shelly Fireman-owned Italianate eatery Trattoria Dell&#x27;Arte across from Carnegie Hall.

Glaser was the subject of the 2008 documentary film &quot;To Inform and Delight: The World of Milton Glaser&quot;. A tribute to Glaser, still working in his 90th year, was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2019.

==Personal life==
Milton Glaser was the uncle of Gabby Glaser, of the band Luscious Jackson. He was also a first cousin once removed of graphic designer Steven Brower; Glaser was Brower’s mother’s cousin. He died of a stroke and renal failure in New York City on his 91st birthday.

Glaser&#x27;s parents were mildly observant Jews, and throughout his life Glaser himself was casually observant, which included fasting on Yom Kippur and hosting an annual Passover seder. Glaser stated that his Jewish background played a part in inspiring his designs, sometimes more than his American background. 

== Works ==
=== Bob Dylan poster ===
In 1966, Glaser designed a poster for &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. It was one of Glaser&#x27;s first posters. The poster depicts the profile of Dylan&#x27;s face with psychedelic, swirly hair, with &quot;Dylan&quot; written at the bottom in Baby Teeth, one of Glaser&#x27;s typefaces. His inspiration for the poster was Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s 1957 Self-portrait; and Art Nouveau, saying &quot;That was an influence for the colors and shapes in the picture.&quot; Six million posters have been printed and distributed, and sell for hundreds of dollars as collectibles.

=== I Love New York logo ===

One of Glaser&#x27;s most recognizable works is his I Love New York logo. In the mid-1970s, New York City&#x27;s crime rate was up and the city was widely perceived to be dangerous and was on the verge of bankruptcy. In 1977, the State of New York hired advertising agency Wells Rich Greene and Milton Glaser to design a logo to increase tourism. It was Glaser who came up with the design while sitting in the back of a taxi cab on the way to the meeting. The logo consists of the capital &quot;I&quot; and a red heart, stacked on top of the letters &quot;NY&quot; in American Typewriter typeface, symbolizing New York. His inspiration for the logo was Robert Indiana&#x27;s LOVE design, with the four letters stacked on top of each other. &quot;Glaser loved New York so much that he gave his work to the city for free, hoping it would become public property.&quot;

The logo earns New York state $30 million each year and has become a pop culture icon. It is reproduced on everything from coffee cups to T-shirts and hats. The logo can be seen everywhere in New York City. Robert Indiana&#x27;s work influenced Glaser who in turn has inspired other designers to create variations on the layout, for example &quot;I Heart Radio&quot;. The state has filed nearly 3,000 objections against them.

After the September 11 terrorist attacks, the logo became even more of a symbol, creating unity between the public. Glaser designed a modified version saying, &quot;I Love New York More Than Ever&quot;, in response to the attacks. The red heart has a small blackened and burned area along one edge to symbolize the attack on the World Trade Center site.

=== &quot;New York&quot; magazine ===
In 1968, Glaser and Clay Felker founded &quot;New York&quot; magazine. The magazine was about being on the reader&#x27;s side, &quot;it was about what was happening in New York City at the time.&quot; One example of this is &quot;The Underground Gourmet&quot;. It was about cheap restaurants in New York. Glaser wrote the column for seven years with Jerome Snyder. It was one of the most popular columns in the magazine. &quot;New York&quot; &quot;became the model for the city magazines, and stimulated a host of imitations&quot;. Glaser left the magazine in 1977. In 1993, thanks to Glaser&#x27;s history with &quot;New York&quot;, he was tapped by John F. Kennedy Jr., in conjunction with his partner Michael J. Berman, to work with them to create the image they were seeking for their start-up magazine &quot;George&quot;.

=== Typography ===
In 1970, Glaser designed his namesake typeface, Glaser Stencil, which drew inspiration from geometric sans-serif fonts such as Futura and Avant Garde.

=== Pomilio Blumm ===
In 2019, Glaser redesigned the historical &#x27;rhino&#x27; logo of the Italian communication agency Pomilio Blumm. Stemming from this experience, a documentary titled &quot;A Social Design Story&quot; was produced.

== Awards ==
In 2004, Glaser won a National Design Award Lifetime Achievement from the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum for his profound and meaningful long-term contributions to the contemporary practice of design.

In 2009, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House. Glaser is the first graphic designer to have received this award.

Glaser was honored as one of The New Jewish Home&#x27;s 2015 Eight Over Eighty honorees.

<doc id="1008891" wikidata="Q3403670" url="?curid=1008891" title="Madeline Smith">
<text>Madeline Smith (born 2 August 1949) is an English actress. After working as a model in the late 1960s, she went on to appear in many television series and stage productions, plus comedy and horror films, in the 1970s and 1980s.

She is perhaps best known for playing Bond girl Miss Caruso in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973), but also had larger roles in the Hammer horror films &quot;The Vampire Lovers&quot; (1970), &quot;Taste the Blood of Dracula&quot; (1970), &quot;Tam-Lin&quot; (1970), &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; (1973) and &quot;Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell&quot; (1974), and comedy films including &quot;Up Pompeii&quot; (1971), &quot;Up the Front&quot; (1972) and &quot;Carry On Matron&quot; (1972) among others. She also appeared in the films &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot; (1968), &quot;Pussycat, Pussycat, I Love You&quot; (1970), &quot;The Amazing Mr. Blunden&quot; (1972), and the musical film &quot;Take Me High&quot; (1973) with Cliff Richard.

After leaving the acting profession in the mid-1980s to raise her family, she returned to acting in 2011.

==Early life, family and education==
Smith was born in Hartfield, Sussex, the only child of Robert and Ursula Smith (née Boas). Her father owned an antiques shop and painting restoration business near Kew Gardens, and her Swiss mother was a translator. Smith received a convent school education. 

In her late teens, she held a temporary job at Biba, a boutique located on Kensington High Street, London. At the instigation of Barbara Hulanicki, founder of Biba, Smith became a model. 

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she was regularly featured in the work of &quot;Disc&quot; cartoonist J Edward Oliver, who on one occasion devoted an entire strip to her entitled &quot;The Life and Habits of the Madeline Smith&quot;.

==Career==
Smith&#x27;s first screen role was a small part in the film &quot;Escalation&quot; (1968) folled with a role in &quot;The Mini-Affair&quot; (1967), although the latter was released first. Smith first worked for Hammer Film Productions in &quot;Taste the Blood of Dracula&quot; (1970), billed as Maddy Smith and playing an East End prostitute. Among her other film appearances, she played opposite Ava Gardner in &quot;Tam-Lin&quot;, Peter Cushing in &quot;The Vampire Lovers&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell&quot;, Diana Dors in &quot;The Amazing Mr Blunden&quot;, Frankie Howerd in &quot;Up Pompeii&quot; and &quot;Up the Front&quot;, and Vincent Price in &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot;. In 1972, Smith appeared in &quot;Carry On Matron&quot; in a scene alongside Hattie Jacques, Barbara Windsor, and Joan Sims. 

In 1973, she played the Bond girl Miss Caruso in the post-opening titles sequence of &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, the first James Bond film starring Roger Moore. Smith&#x27;s role is therefore significant as Miss Caruso is the first Bond girl of the Roger Moore era. Smith and Moore take part in a scene in which he unzips her dress with a magnetic wristwatch. She was recommended for the role by Moore himself, having previously appeared with him in an episode of the television series &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;. 

Smith&#x27;s numerous stage credits include working with US director Charles Marowitz on &quot;Blue Comedy&quot; (Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford) and &quot;The Snob&quot; (at Marowitz&#x27;s Tottenham Court Road venue the Open Space). She also acted opposite Alec Guinness in the original West End production of Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot; (playing Felicity Rumpers), supported Frankie Howerd again in the &quot;Volpone&quot; adaptation &quot;The Fly and the Fox&quot; (Churchill Theatre, Bromley), played Elma in a Cambridge Theatre Company revival of Frederick Lonsdale&#x27;s &quot;Canaries Sometimes Sing&quot;, and spent two years playing the female lead in Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; at the St Martin&#x27;s Theatre.

Her television credits include &quot;Doctor at Large&quot; (1971), &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; (appearing in the serial &quot;Hampton Wick&quot;, 1971), &quot;Clochemerle&quot; (1972), &quot;His and Hers&quot; (1970) with Tim Brooke-Taylor, &quot;Casanova &#x27;73&quot; (1973) with Leslie Phillips, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1974), &quot;The Howerd Confessions&quot; (1976), &quot;Why Didn&#x27;t They Ask Evans?&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Steam Video Company&quot; (1984). She also featured in two episodes of &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, as two different characters (as Angela Farmer in &quot;Pride of Possession&quot; (1978) and as Anne Grantley in the 1983 Christmas special). She was a member of the regular cast of the BBC2 series &quot;The End of the Pier Show&quot; (1974) and &quot;In The Looking Glass&quot; (1978) alongside satirists John Wells and John Fortune and composer Carl Davis. Smith also starred in &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; (1984), which was the final screen appearance of Eric Morecambe.

After the birth of her daughter in 1984, Smith gradually wound down her career to enable her time to raise her. In 2009, Smith interviewed in, and was the cover star of, the coffee-table book &quot;Hammer Glamour&quot;. She returned to acting in 2011 with an appearance in an episode of &quot;Doctors&quot;. She then followed this with a role in a docu-drama marking the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; before starring in the miniseries &quot;Dancing on the Edge&quot; (2013) and appearing in an episode of &quot;Not Going Out&quot; in 2014. In 2015, she appeared as a contestant on the red team in the BBC antiques gameshow &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot;. In December 2018, she appeared in episode 4 of the Christmas series of &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; with the history of Kew Gardens as her specialist subject. In 2019, Smith reunited with her &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot; co-star Tim Brooke-Taylor and actors including Frazer Hines and Camille Coduri in a recorded audio play of the same name to mark 50 years of the series.

==Personal life==
Smith married actor David Buck in 1975; he died from cancer in 1989. The couple had a daughter, Emily, born in 1984.

<doc id="1008893" wikidata="Q1373310" url="?curid=1008893" title="Helmut Schön">
<text>Helmut Schön (15 September 1915 – 23 February 1996) was a German football player and manager. He is best remembered for his exceptional career as manager of the West Germany national team in four consecutive World Cup tournaments, including winning the title in 1974, losing in the final in 1966, and coming in third in 1970. In addition, his teams won the European Championship in 1972 and lost in the final in 1976.

== Biography ==
Schön played as a striker for Dresdner SC, winning the German football championship in 1943 and 1944 as well as the cup in 1941 and 1942. He appeared 16 times for his country between 1937 and 1941, scoring 17 goals.
After World War II he began his career in football management in his native state of Saxony, then part of Soviet-occupied East Germany. He was in charge of coaching selections from Saxony and the Soviet occupation zone before political interference to the sport made him flee to Western Germany in 1950. Having played in Hamburg for FC St. Pauli even during his Friedrichstadt spell, he now was appointed player-coach with Hertha BSC Berlin where he had several former teammates in his squad but left before the end of the season. Schön became a licensed coach in Cologne before managing Wiesbaden. Between 1952 and 1956, he was in charge of the then-independent Saarland side, who met West Germany in qualification for the 1954 World Cup. When the Saarland was reunified with West Germany in 1956, Schön joined the West Germany national side as assistant to Sepp Herberger, whom he succeeded as manager in November 1964.

Under Schön&#x27;s leadership the West German teams were World Cup runners-up in 1966 (lost 4–2 to England in the final), third in the World Cup of 1970, European champions in 1972 (defeated the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final), World Cup winners in 1974 (defeated the Netherlands 2–1 in the final), and European Championship runners-up in 1976 (lost to Czechoslovakia in the final on penalty kicks, after extra-time). Among the moves Schön made that enabled West Germany&#x27;s triumphs in 1972 and 1974 were: selecting Sepp Maier as his automatic first string goalkeeper, a decision that seems obvious in retrospect but was not a given at the time; easing many of the veterans of the 1970 team out of the subsequent squad; allowing Franz Beckenbauer to play his preferred role as a sweeper, and appointing him team captain; introducing young fullbacks Berti Vogts and Paul Breitner into the team; building the midfield around Günter Netzer and switching the team&#x27;s formation to better accommodate his skills; then replacing Netzer with Wolfgang Overath in the 1974 team.

Schön holds World Cup records for both coaching the most matches (25) and the most wins (16), and was the first coach to win both a World Cup and a European Championship. He shares with England&#x27;s Walter Winterbottom the distinction of managing the same national team at four consecutive World Cup tournaments. Schön gave notice that he would retire after the 1978 World Cup, to be replaced by his assistant Jupp Derwall. He was unable to go out on a high note as his team was knocked out of the competition by Austria, who had already been eliminated. During his 14-year tenure as national coach, his record was 87 victories, 30 draws and 22 defeats in 139 matches. For his contributions to association football as a coach, Schön became one of the inaugural recipients of the FIFA Order of Merit in 1984.

<doc id="1008897" wikidata="Q4261587" url="?curid=1008897" title="Elizabeth Vargas">
<text>Elizabeth Anne Vargas (born September 6, 1962) is an American television journalist who is the lead investigative reporter/documentary anchor for A&amp;E Networks, and was the host for Fox&#x27;s revival of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (2021). She began her new position on May 28, 2018, after being an anchor of ABC&#x27;s television newsmagazine &quot;20/20&quot; and ABC News specials for the previous 14 years. She is also a news anchor for NewsNation, where she hosts &quot;Elizabeth Vargas Reports&quot; currently based in New York City.

In 2006 Vargas was co-anchor of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; alongside ABC News journalist Bob Woodruff.

==Early life and education==
Elizabeth Anne Vargas was born in Paterson, New Jersey, the daughter of an Italian-Spanish father, Rafael &quot;Ralf&quot; Vargas, a colonel in the U.S. Army from Puerto Rico, and an Irish-American mother, Anne Vargas, a part-time English teacher. She has two siblings, Amy and Christopher, who both work in tech in Silicon Valley. Her father was a U.S. army captain and moved the family to Okinawa when she was four years old. Vargas then spent much of her youth moving from post to post in Germany, Belgium, and the United States. Vargas graduated from an American high school in Heidelberg, where she realized her passion for journalism.

Vargas enrolled at the University of Missouri in Columbia in 1980 and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism in 1984, having served as a student reporter at KOMU-TV and a student editor at KBIA. Former advisors spoke well of her competency in her journalism work on campus; Rod Gelatt, former KOMU news director, noted that she was the first student to ever fill in for him as moderator of the station&#x27;s &quot;Missouri Forum&quot; public affairs program and Kent Collins, chairman of the university&#x27;s journalism faculty, remembered her &quot;aggressive and energetic&quot; work ethic.

==Career==

=== 1984–1993: Career beginnings ===
After college, Vargas worked at Reno&#x27;s CBS affiliate KTVN, before moving to Phoenix as a lead reporter for then-ABC affiliate KTVK-TV. After three years there, she moved to Chicago to work at CBS station WBBM-TV, where Phyllis McGrady, a senior vice president at ABC, said of her: &quot;Elizabeth is one of the most flexible talents I&#x27;ve ever worked with. She could do interviews, and do hour-long specials that make you think, and then she&#x27;ll do a great interview with P. Diddy. She is versatile.&quot; Vargas left WBBM-TV in 1993.

=== 1993–1996: NBC News ===
In 1993, Vargas joined NBC News as a correspondent for &quot;Now with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric&quot;. She later became a correspondent mainly for &quot;Dateline NBC,&quot; and also served as a substitute anchor for &quot;Today&quot; and the weekend editions of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;.

=== 1996–2018: ABC News ===
In June 1996, she joined ABC News&#x27; &quot;Good Morning America&quot; as the newsreader and Joan Lunden&#x27;s likely &quot;heir apparent&quot;. In June 1997, ABC promoted Vargas to prime time magazine show correspondent, succeeded by Kevin Newman as newsreader. In 2002, she became one of the anchors of &quot;20/20 Downtown&quot;, which was later rebranded &quot;Downtown&quot; before being rebranded again in 2003 as &quot;Primetime Monday&quot; before its end. She later reported occasionally for &quot;Primetime&quot;. She was also named anchor of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; Saturday and presented with the opportunity to develop specials for &quot;Primetime&quot;. In November 2003, Vargas became anchor of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; Sunday. She was named co-anchor of &quot;20/20&quot; in May 2004.

Vargas was the first national evening news anchor of Puerto Rican and Irish-American heritage and also the third female anchor of a network evening newscast in the US since Connie Chung and Barbara Walters. She is said to be &quot;particularly proud&quot; of an ABC special report in which she questioned why the Laci Peterson case merited more attention than two other similar cases, one involving a black woman and the other involving a Hispanic woman. Another story, based on the book &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and the role of Mary Magdalene, helped fuel a nationwide religious debate. Vargas stated that for centuries Mary Magdalene has been portrayed as a prostitute by the church despite evidence to the contrary. She went on to question the limited role of women within the Catholic church. In 1999, she won an Emmy Award for her coverage of the Elián González story, and in 1998 she was nominated for an Emmy Award for her &quot;20/20&quot; investigation into the wrongful conviction of Betty Tyson.

In April 2005, Vargas and Charles Gibson temporarily filled in for Peter Jennings, who was receiving chemotherapy for lung cancer, on &quot;World News Tonight&quot; until Jennings&#x27;s death in August. After a period of mourning and indecision, she and Bob Woodruff were chosen as co-anchors on December 5, 2005. She anchored many broadcasts alone after Woodruff&#x27;s injury in Iraq in January 2006. She also co-anchored &quot;World News Tonight&quot; with either Charles Gibson or Diane Sawyer.

On May 23, 2006, Vargas announced her resignation from &quot;World News Tonight&quot;. Gibson was then named sole anchor of the show, effective from May 29, 2006, replacing Vargas and Woodruff. To explain the sudden change, Vargas cited her doctors&#x27; recommendation to considerably cut back her schedule owing to a difficult pregnancy and her wish to spend more time with her new baby when he arrived. Most inside accounts, however, said she fully expected and wished to return to the anchor chair soon after giving birth, but Gibson threatened to quit ABC News if he was not made sole permanent anchor. According to these sources, his gambit succeeded and she was left embittered, although not enough to sever ties with the network. In late 2006, Vargas returned as co-anchor of &quot;20/20&quot; and primary host of ABC News specials. In 2008, Vargas hosted &quot;Elvis: Viva Las Vegas&quot;, a documentary that explored Elvis Presley&#x27;s triumph in Las Vegas and his artistic legacy, and featured performances and interviews with various stars, including Paul McCartney, Beyoncé, Dwayne Johnson, Faith Hill, David Lynch, Jon Bon Jovi, Celine Dion, and Priscilla Presley.

In 2013, Vargas won a Peabody Award for her contributions in ABC News&#x27; coverage of Hurricane Sandy on &quot;20/20.&quot;

In a special edition of &quot;20/20&quot; that aired on September 9, 2016, Vargas opened up about her struggles with anxiety and alcoholism and further talked about her upcoming book &quot;Between Breaths: A Memoir of Panic and Addiction&quot;, which discusses those struggles. In October 2016, she appeared in an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;.

Vargas officially departed ABC on May 25, 2018, after a dedication on &quot;20/20&quot;.

=== 2018–present: A&amp;E Investigates and &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; ===
In April 2018, A&amp;E Originals signed Vargas to a first-look and production deal. Vargas would serve as the anchor of its A&amp;E Investigates banner for new non-fiction prime-time journalism programming. She broadcast her first A&amp;E Investigates series, &quot;Cults &amp; Extreme Belief&quot;, in May 2018. &quot;The Untold Story&quot;, a series focusing on the untold stories of influential people and events, premiered in April 2019. In January 2021, it was confirmed that Vargas would host a revival of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; on Fox, which premiered on March 15, 2021.

Vargas is now the anchor of &quot;News Cafe&quot; on A&amp;E&#x27;s FYI Network.

==Personal life==
Vargas has explained that despite her multi-ethnic heritage, she identifies with her Hispanic roots. She is fluent in English and Spanish and proficient in French.

On July 20, 2002, Vargas married singer-songwriter Marc Cohn after three years of dating. They have two sons, Zach and Sam. Vargas also has two stepchildren, Max and Emily, from Cohn&#x27;s first marriage. In August 2014, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; reported that Vargas and Cohn were divorcing after 12 years of marriage.

Vargas was introduced to Transcendental Meditation in 2014 by fellow ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos.

=== Alcoholism ===
Vargas&#x27;s lifelong battle with alcohol stemmed from anxiety rooted in her childhood. After her father joined the Vietnam War, she began suffering daily panic attacks. She was told early on that she should hide her anxiety to avoid appearing weak, but this only intensified the problem and her addiction to alcohol. During a family vacation in 2012, she realized she needed help. She sought treatment in Utah, but departed prematurely and eventually relapsed.

On November 6, 2013, ABC confirmed a &quot;New York Daily News&quot; story that Vargas was undergoing treatment for alcoholism in Tennessee. &quot;I am dealing with addiction,&quot; Vargas said. Once again, Vargas left rehab too soon but quickly realized it was a mistake. Within a week, she returned for treatment for a third time. Shortly after coming home, she and husband Marc Cohn divorced.

On January 24, 2014, Vargas described herself as an alcoholic. Over the next few years, she wrote &quot;Between Breaths: A Memoir of Panic and Addiction&quot;. Her book was published by Grand Central Publishing on September 13, 2016, and became an instant &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot; best-seller.

In 2018, NBC News reported that Vargas had been sober since 2014.

<text>John Fraser Mann (September 18, 1962 – November 20, 2019) was a Canadian rock musician, songwriter and actor. He was best known as the frontman of the folk rock band Spirit of the West.

==Early career==

Born in Calgary, Alberta, Mann relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia, to study theatre at Studio 58. He left Studio 58 in 1983 and co-founded the band Spirit of the West. The band released its first independent album the following year.

==Music==

Mann was the lead vocalist of the folk rock band Spirit of the West and the band&#x27;s co-founder and co-songwriter along with bandmate Geoffrey Kelly.

Spirit of the West&#x27;s music is a mixture of folk, Alternative rock and pop with a Celtic-influenced sound. The band gained wider popularity with their 1990 major label release &quot;Save This House&quot;. The album included &quot;Home for a Rest&quot; which became their most recognized song. Co-written by Mann, &quot;Home for a Rest&quot; is a popular drinking song in Canada; it has been called &quot;legendary&quot; and the &quot;ultimate Canadian frosh-week/wedding-reception anthem&quot; by Marsha Lederman of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, an &quot;iconic drinking song&quot; by Alex Cooper of the &quot;Revelstoke Times Review&quot;, and &quot;Canada’s unofficial national anthem&quot; by Patricia D&#x27;Cunha of &quot;CityNews&quot;. In 2010 the song was also listed by Mike Devlin of the Canwest News Service as one of the &quot;Ten best drinking songs of all time&quot; and was ranked #89 on the &quot;National Post&quot; list of &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Singles&quot;.

Mann also played lead guitar for Spirit of the West until 2013, subsequent to his diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Musician Matthew Harder subsequently joined the band as a replacement guitarist. Spirit of the West planned a retrospective tour in the fall of 2015. Weeks after the announcement, Mann performed a concert featuring both his solo material and Spirit of the West, which was broadcast by CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Absolutely Canadian&quot; in July 2015 as &quot;John Mann Here and Now&quot;.

Mann also released three solo albums: &quot;Acoustic Kitty&quot;, &quot;December Looms&quot; and &quot;The Waiting Room&quot;. &quot;The Waiting Room&quot; deals with the topic of Mann&#x27;s battle with colorectal cancer, and was adapted into a theatrical work by Morris Panych which was produced by Vancouver&#x27;s Arts Club Theatre Company in 2015. Although Mann was initially slated to play the lead role, due to his health he did not do so, although he performed the songs from the album as part of the show.

During his solo shows, Mann continued to play guitar, but also employed an accompanist.

In addition to Spirit of the West and his solo albums, Mann appeared as a guest musician on recordings by Mae Moore, The Waltons, James Keelaghan and Paul Hyde.

==Acting==
===Television===
Mann studied theatre at Studio 58 in Vancouver, but he put his acting career on hold when he joined Spirit of the West in 1983. Mann returned to acting in the 1998 when a high school friend, who was working as a talent agent, asked if he wanted to audition for the TV series &quot;Millennium&quot;; he appeared in the &quot;Millennium&quot; episode &quot;Via Dolorosa&quot; that aired in May 1999.

Mann went on to appear on several television shows as a guest actor, including &quot;Cold Squad&quot;, &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot; and &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot;. He also played recurring characters in the series &quot;Whistler&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot;, &quot;Blood Ties&quot; and &quot;Intelligence&quot;.

===Film===
Mann played dual roles in the 2001 film &quot;Turbulence 3: Heavy Metal&quot;. In the film he portrayed the character Slade Craven—a goth rocker reminiscent of Marilyn Manson who stages a concert in a 747—and Simon Flanders—a passenger of the flight who is a Satanic fan planning to crash the plane in Eastern Kansas while disguised as Craven. Mann also had minor roles in such films as &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; (2004), &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; (2005), &quot;&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Tall Man&quot; (2012).

===Theatre===

His theatre credits include &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; at The Vancouver Playhouse, &quot;The Three Penny Opera&quot; with Vancouver Opera, &quot;Joni Mitchell: River&quot; at The Vancouver Playhouse, and &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; at The Arts Club Stanley Theatre in the role of The Engineer—a role that earned him a Jessie Award nomination for Best Actor. In 2010 he starred in the rock musical &quot;Beyond Eden&quot;, which was mounted by both the Vancouver Playhouse Theatre Company and Theatre Calgary.

==Personal life==
Mann was married to actress and playwright Jill Daum. The couple have two children, son Harlan and daughter Hattie. Their children use the blended surname Daumann. Harlan Daumann is also a musician, whose song &quot;By Tomorrow&quot; was recorded by Mann on his solo album &quot;December Looms&quot;.

Prior to marrying Daum, he was romantically linked with Jean Smith of the band Mecca Normal, who was revealed in the 2001 book &quot;Have Not Been the Same: The Can-Rock Renaissance 1985-1995&quot; as the inspiration behind one of Spirit of the West&#x27;s best-known hit singles, &quot;Political&quot;.

==Illness and death==
In 2009, Mann was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, which he overcame in 2010, and by 2011, he had made a full recovery.

In September 2014, Mann announced that he had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Mann said he had noted memory issues during his acting performances as far back as 2001, and he later experienced issues with remembering lyrics and guitar chords during his musical performances. He experienced symptoms of dementia while being treated for cancer, but his doctors considered the problems to be related to the stress and strain of battling cancer. In an official statement posted to Spirit of the West&#x27;s official website, Daum stated: &quot;Although we may never know what triggered John&#x27;s condition, it seems safe to conclude that his battle with cancer in 2010 was a contributor.&quot; Weeks after the announcement, Mann performed a concert featuring his solo material and that of Spirit of the West, which was broadcast by CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Absolutely Canadian&quot; in July 2015 as &quot;John Mann Here and Now&quot;.

At the time, Mann planned to continue touring and performing with Spirit of the West as long as he remained able to do so. The band later announced that it would perform its final concert in April 2016. Mann continued to perform occasional small-scale solo shows, including an appearance at a fundraiser for Alzheimer&#x27;s charities in June 2016.

Mann underwent a stem cell procedure in hopes of helping his Alzheimer&#x27;s. An online fundraiser in December 2015 quickly amassed more than $55,000, for the procedure. The procedure took place at a clinic in Mexico because the therapy had not been approved in Canada.

In 2015, filmmaker Pete McCormack filmed the documentary &quot;Spirit Unforgettable&quot; that documented Mann as he dealt with the early onset of the disease and his preparation for Spirit of the West&#x27;s concert at Massey Hall. The film was screened at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in April 2016, and aired on HBO Canada later in the year. Mann wrote a few solo songs following his diagnosis, including one for &quot;Spirit Unforgettable&quot; and two for Daum&#x27;s Alzheimer-related theatrical play &quot;Forget About Tomorrow&quot;.

Following his diagnosis, musicians in Toronto staged an annual benefit concert, consisting of Spirit of the West songs and other favourite songs of Mann&#x27;s, to raise money for Alzheimer&#x27;s research. Performers at the 2017 &quot;Spirit of John&quot; event included Steven Page, Danny Michel, Andy Maize and Josh Finlayson of Skydiggers, Tom Wilson, Martin Tielli, Kevin Kane, Danny Greaves, Justin Rutledge and Damhnait Doyle. A similar show in 2019 included Greaves, Maize, Finlayson, Doyle, Kane, Royal Wood, Andrew Cash, Jim Cuddy, Dayna Manning and Chris Tait.

In 2017, friends and colleagues organized a similar concert in Vancouver on November 19 at the Commodore Ballroom, with a lineup including Spirit of the West, Odds, Barney Bentall, Dustin Bentall, Jim Byrnes, Kendel Carson, Jim Cuddy, Alan Doyle, Colin James, Sarah McLachlan, Ed Robertson, Shari Ulrich and Spirit: The Next Generation, an act consisting of the band members&#x27; children. Before the Vancouver show, the performing musicians participated in a group recording of the band&#x27;s signature song &quot;Home for a Rest&quot; as a tribute to Mann.

In 2018, Vancouver&#x27;s Off the Rail Brewing Company introduced The Spirit Lifter, a limited edition pilsner, to raise funds for Mann&#x27;s medical costs.

Mann died in Vancouver on November 20, 2019, at age 57, from complications related to early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s.

<text>Donald Anthony Perkins (March 4, 1938 – June 9, 2022) was an American professional football player who was a fullback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football at the University of New Mexico.

==Early life==
Perkins was born on March 4, 1938, in Waterloo, Iowa, and was raised in the segregated part of Waterloo. Perkins earned eight letters for Waterloo West High School, four each in football and track (sprinter). He also played basketball. Perkins captained the track team by the time he was a junior.

In 1955, his football team went undefeated and Perkins made the first All-state team as a halfback, while playing both offense and defense. He was elected president of the student body during his senior year, extraordinary for a barely integrated school.

==College career==
Perkins played varsity college football at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque (1957-1959), where he played halfback and defensive back as a two-way player. He was a two-time or three-time All-Skyline selection and the Skyline Sophomore of the Year. In 1959, he led the nation in kickoff returns, with a 34.7 yards per return average. In 1959, he also received third-team All-American honors. He was named Associated Press (AP) and United Press International (UPI) back of the week for November 21, 1959, when he rushed for 126 yards, had a 64-yard touchdown reception, and scored three touchdowns against Air Force. NMU came from behind to win the game 28–27.  

The head coach at New Mexico was future Hall of Famer Marv Levy, who has stated in several occasions that Perkins was one of the greatest players he ever coached. He also mentioned Perkins in his Hall of Fame induction speech in Canton, Ohio. When Perkins first came to Albuquerque and could not find a place to live because of racial segregation, Levy took Perkins into his home.

As a sophomore, he set a school record when he rushed for 187 yards against Colorado State, which stood for 11 years. His 85-yard touchdown run that year against Arizona was second best in at least 65 seasons. Perkins led the team in rushing in 1957 (744 yards/6.6 yards per carry) and 1958 (621 yards/5.5 yards per carry). He led the team in receiving in 1957 and 1959, and was the first New Mexico player to have both a 100-yard rushing and receiving game in the same season. He had eleven touchdowns his senior year. 

At the end of the 2021 season, he was one of only three Lobos to break 2,000 career rushing yards in a three-year career. His career total 3,466 all-purpose yards was a Lobo record for 13 years. Through 2021, he holds the career kickoff return average record of 30.7 yards.   

Perkins set 12 records as a three-year halfback starter. The school retired his number (43) when he completed his career – a first in UNM history. Through 2024, he ranks 17th in the Lobos&#x27; career rushing list with 2,001 yards, which was a school record until the 1970s; and 13th in combined rushing and receiving yards. He was inducted into the New Mexico Sports Hall of Fame in 1974, and was in the inaugural class of the University of New Mexico Hall of Honor. Perkins name is in the Lobo Football Ring of Honor inside University Stadium, and his picture is one of four outside the stadium.

==Professional career==
The Dallas Cowboys franchise was admitted to the league too late to participate in the 1960 NFL draft in November 1959, so they signed Perkins to a personal-services contract for a $1,500 bonus and a $10,000 salary. This meant he would play for the Cowboys if and when they received an NFL franchise. Although he was selected in the ninth round of the NFL draft by the Baltimore Colts, the league honored the contract, but made the Cowboys compensate the Colts with a ninth-round draft pick (#116-Roy Walker) in the 1962 NFL draft.

Perkins sat out the entire 1960 season with a broken foot (fifth metatarsal) he suffered in training camp, so he began playing with the Cowboys in 1961 as a rookie. He lacked long-distance speed, but made up for it with outstanding quickness and balance. He finished with 815 rushing yards (sixth among league leaders) and 4 touchdowns, earning NFL rookie of the year and Pro Bowl honors. He was third in AP and UPI voting for the NFL&#x27;s 1961 rookie of the year (behind Mike Ditka and Fran Tarkenton). 

Not only was Perkins considered a superb blocker, he also finished in the NFL&#x27;s top 10 rushing in each of his eight seasons in the league. On September 24, 1961, he became the first running back in Cowboys&#x27; history to run for 100 yards in a game, when he rushed for 108 yards on 17 carries against the expansion Minnesota Vikings. 

Perkins&#x27;s best year was in 1962, when he rushed for 945 yards and seven touchdowns, becoming the first Cowboy, along with linebacker Jerry Tubbs, to make the All-Pro team. He went from being on losing and mediocre teams, to playing in the NFL championship games against the Green Bay Packers in 1966 and 1967. In the 1966 game, he rushed for 108 yards and one touchdown. In the 1967 game, known as the Ice Bowl, with wind chill temperatures as low as -48 degrees, he led all runners with 51 rushing yards. 

Even though he played the fullback position at and , his ten career 100-yard games ranks fourth in club history. He led the Dallas Cowboys in rushing in seven of his eight seasons, including five consecutive seasons, and also led or co-led them in rushing touchdowns in six of his eight seasons. In 1966, Dan Reeves rushed for 757 yards to 726 yards for Perkins. From 1964 through 1968, he never rushed for less than 690 yards, and in 1967 and 1968, he rushed for 823 yards and 836 yards respectively, with his highest career rushing average (4.4 yards per carry) coming in 1968. He was coming off his two best all-around seasons when he decided to retire prior to the 1969 season. 

Perkins ranks fourth on the Cowboys&#x27; all-time rushing yards list (behind Emmitt Smith, Tony Dorsett, and Ezekiel Elliott), and fifth on the rushing touchdowns list, behind Smith, Dorsett, Marion Barber III, and Elliott. He was selected to six Pro Bowls, one first-team All-Pro team (1962), and was named second-team All-Pro as well (1967), while gaining a reputation in the NFL for his courage and resolve on some of worst teams in Dallas Cowboys history. In 1968, he helped end the Cowboys practice of segregating players when traveling to hotels.

&quot;Perkins was in the toughest times&quot;, Cowboys head coach Tom Landry once told NFL Films: &quot;The guy was a remarkable runner, a great pass blocker and one of the best players in our history.&quot; Walt Garrison, who replaced him in the starting lineup, once said, &quot;Don Perkins was the best fullback the Dallas Cowboys ever had&quot;.

Perkins retired at the end of 1968 having led all active players in rushing yards since the retirement of Jim Taylor, and was fifth in NFL history with 6,217. He was inducted into the Cowboys Ring of Honor at Texas Stadium alongside his quarterback Don Meredith in 1976. Only Bob Lilly was inducted ahead of them, in 1975. He was one of four former players asked to speak at Tom Landry&#x27;s funeral.

In 2006, he was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame.

The Professional Football Researchers Association named Perkins to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2016.

==NFL career statistics==


==Personal life and death==
Perkins was a football analyst for CBS Sports, ABC Sports, and other television and radio networks. He was the director of the Work Incentive Program for the State of New Mexico Department of Human Services from 1972 to 1985. He served on both the executive board of US West and the Board of Trustees for University Hospital from 1990 to 1993. He was a member of the Northwest Mesa Branch of the NAACP.

A father of four children and grandfather of eleven, Perkins was active in local theater, public speaking, and broadcasting at the local and national levels. He retired in the city of Albuquerque.

Perkins died on June 9, 2022, aged 84.

<doc id="1008926" wikidata="Q7333411" url="?curid=1008926" title="Rigger boot">
<text>A rigger boot is a type of pull-on safety boot in the United Kingdom. The name &quot;rigger&quot; comes from their use by workers on the offshore oil rigs in the North Sea. Nowadays they are worn by manual workers as a general purpose workboot.

Riggers, as they are commonly nicknamed, are usually tan in colour and go approximately third of the way up the leg and feature a steel toe cap for safety. Other distinguishing features of the boots include pull-on loops around the top of the boot&#x27;s shaft and internal fur lining.

Many rigger boots are unbranded or generic brands, some of which may have steel toe caps which may not conform to the EN-345 standard, and some workplaces concerned about their lack of adequate ankle support now ban them.

The boots are sometimes made in other colours, such as black, where they can be worn as fashion items in the punk and heavy metal scenes.

<doc id="1008930" wikidata="Q7590871" url="?curid=1008930" title="St. Olaf Choir">
<text>The St. Olaf Choir is a premier a cappella choir based in Northfield, Minnesota. Founded in 1912 by Norwegian immigrant F. Melius Christiansen, the choir has been influential to other church and college choirs for its performance of unaccompanied sacred music. Conducted since 1990 by Anton Armstrong, there have been four conductors in the choir&#x27;s year history.

==Description==
Previously founding the St. Olaf Band, professor F. Melius Christiansen formed the St. Olaf Choir in 1912 from the worship choir of nearby St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church. After a successful tour of the American Midwest that same year, the choir began planning a tour of the college&#x27;s cultural homeland, Norway. Beatrice Gjertsen Bessesen was one of the performers. This 1913 tour included performances in front of King Haakon VII and Queen Maud. In the 1920s, the St. Olaf Choir began touring regularly after a highly acclaimed tour of the East Coast. Subsequent tours, recordings, and radio broadcasts spread the group&#x27;s fame among the choral community, transforming the Midwest into a hotbed of choral activity.

In 1943, Olaf Christiansen succeeded his father as conductor of the St. Olaf Choir. Graduating from St. Olaf College in 1925 and singing in the choir under his father, Olaf had earned advanced degrees at Union Theological Seminary and taught at the Oberlin Conservatory. After 27 years as conductor, Olaf retired in 1968. .

The third conductor of the St. Olaf Choir was Kenneth Jennings, a 1950 graduate of St. Olaf College who sang in the choir under his predecessor. Under Jennings&#x27; direction, the choir expanded its repertoire and began occasionally performing accompanied music and larger works. Jennings also expanded the choir&#x27;s global reach with a 1986 tour of Asia. In 1988, it became one of five choirs in the world to sing at the Olympic Choral Arts Festival in Seoul, South Korea.

In 1990, Anton Armstrong became the fourth conductor of the St. Olaf Choir. Graduating in 1978, Armstrong also sang in the choir under his predecessor. He was considered well suited for the position, having written his doctoral thesis on the legacy of the ensemble. Armstrong further broadened the choir&#x27;s performance repertoire by emphasizing worldly music, American spirituals, and occasional secular pieces.

The St. Olaf Choir is perhaps best known for its annual performances in the St. Olaf Christmas Festival, which airs annually on national and international radio and television. Furthermore, the choir is known for closing nearly every performance with its signature piece, Beautiful Savior. In 1998, the St. Olaf Choir was chronicled in a book by historian Joseph Shaw.

==Notable Performances==
Since the 1920s, the St. Olaf Choir has performed on annual tours domestically throughout all regions of the United States. The choir has attracted capacity audiences at venues such as Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, Severance Hall, the Kauffman Center, Meyerson Symphony Center, and the Orchestra Halls of Chicago and Minneapolis. Furthermore, the choir travels internationally every four years, with previous performances in Scandinavia, Great Britain, France, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa.

In 2005 the St. Olaf Choir performed at the White House for President George W. Bush to commemorate The National Day of Prayer. That same year, the choir performed in the final concerts of the National Conference of the American Choral Directors Association at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, only to sing the next day in an acclaimed performance at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. Internationally, the choir has performed at the Seoul Olympic Arts Festival, the Strasbourg and Bergen Music Festivals, and the closing concert of the Sixth World Symposium on Choral Music in Minneapolis.

In 2007, the choir appeared in a live simulcast of the St. Olaf Christmas Festival, which showed on more than 180 movie theatres across the nation and reach 2.5 million viewers on a later PBS broadcast. In December 2011, the 100th St. Olaf Christmas Festival was simulcast to nearly 300 movie theatres. In 2013, the choir appeared in a television special titled &quot;Christmas in Norway with the St. Olaf Choir&quot;, filmed at the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, Norway. The special won 2 regional Emmy Awards in 2014.

Also in 2007, the St. Olaf Choir&#x27;s recording of &quot;Lacrimosa&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s Requiem appeared in a television commercial for Nike to promote their new Air Jordan XXII shoes.

==Discography==
The St. Olaf Choir has recorded 27 full-length albums, and has been included on numerous other recordings (such as yearly recordings of the St. Olaf Christmas Festival). Furthermore, the St. Olaf Choir can be heard in the 1972 western, The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid.

<doc id="1008932" wikidata="Q1245484" url="?curid=1008932" title="DK (publisher)">
<text>Dorling Kindersley Limited (branded as DK) is a British multinational publishing company specialising in illustrated reference books for adults and children in 63 languages. 
It is part of Penguin Random House, a subsidiary of German media conglomerate Bertelsmann.
Established in 1974, DK publishes a range of titles in genres including travel (including DK Eyewitness Travel), history, geography, science, space, nature, sports, gardening, cookery, parenting and many others. 
The worldwide CEO of DK is Paul Kelly. DK has offices in New York, Melbourne, London, Munich, New Delhi, Toronto, Madrid, Beijing, and Jiangmen.
DK works with licensing partners such as Disney, LEGO, DC Comics, the Royal Horticultural Society, MasterChef, and the Smithsonian Institution. 
DK has commissioned authors such as Mary Berry, Monty Don, Robert Winston, Huw Richards, and Steve Mould for a range of books.

==History==

DK was founded in 1974 by Christopher Dorling and Peter Kindersley in London as a book packager. Its first book as a publisher in the UK was &quot;First Aid Manual&quot; for the British voluntary medical services. In 1988, DK Inc. published the first Eyewitness book. DK Inc. began publishing in the United States in 1991. That same year, Microsoft bought a 26 percent stake in DK. In 1996, DK hired Neal Porter, Richard Jackson and Melanie Kroupa from Orchard Books to start the DK Ink imprint, but Grolier sued the trio. DK and Grolier settled the lawsuit.

In 1999, DK overestimated the market for &quot;Star Wars&quot; books and was left with millions of unsold copies, resulting in crippling debt. As a direct result, DK was taken over the following year by the Pearson plc media company and made part of Penguin Group, which also owned the Penguin Books label. DK has continued to sell &quot;Star Wars&quot; books after the takeover.

In 2013, Bertelsmann and Pearson completed a merger to form Penguin Random House. Bertelsmann owned 53% and Pearson 47% of the company. Penguin&#x27;s trade publishing activity continued to include DK under the newly formed Penguin Random House. 
In July 2017, Pearson agreed to sell a 22% stake in the business to Bertelsmann, thereby retaining a 25% holding.
In December 2019, Bertelsmann agreed to acquire Pearson&#x27;s 25% in Penguin Random House, and therefore DK, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann.
In 2019, Prima Games was sold to Asteri Holdings.

==Publications==

DK publishes a range of titles internationally for adults and children. Most of the company&#x27;s books are published with &quot;DK&quot; named as the author, as they are produced by teams of editors, designers and cartographers who work with freelance writers and illustrators. Some are endorsed by &quot;imprimaturs&quot;: such as the British Medical Association, the Royal Horticultural Society and the British Red Cross.

===BradyGames===
BradyGames was a publishing company in the United States operating as a DK imprint, which specializes in video game strategy guides, covering multiple video game platforms. It published its first strategy guide in November 1993 as a division of MacMillan Computer Publishing. In 1998, Simon &amp; Schuster (which acquired Macmillan in 1994) divested BradyGames as part of its educational division to Pearson plc. BradyGames has grown to publish roughly 90 to 100 guides per year.

On 1 June 2015, BradyGames merged with Prima Games, and future strategy guides made by the publishing company were published under the Prima Games label, which was sold to Asteri Holdings in 2019.

===Young adult===
DK commenced publishing books aimed at teens with the release of &quot;Heads Up Psychology&quot; in 2014.

<text>The Iceland national football team () represents Iceland in men&#x27;s international football. The team is controlled by the Football Association of Iceland, and have been a FIFA member since 1947 and a UEFA member since 1957. The team&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Strákarnir okkar&quot;, which means &quot;Our Boys&quot; in Icelandic.

The team 
enjoyed success in the second half of the 2010s. In the qualifying rounds for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Iceland reached the playoffs before losing to Croatia. Iceland reached its first major tournament, UEFA Euro 2016, after a qualification campaign which included home and away wins over the Netherlands. After reaching the knockout stages of Euro 2016, Iceland defeated England in the Round of 16, advancing to the quarter-finals, where they lost to host nation France 5–2. They became the smallest nation by population ever to clinch a FIFA World Cup berth when they qualified for the 2018 tournament on 9 October 2017. They drew with Argentina in their opening match, but went out in the group stage.

==History==
===20th century===
Although Úrvalsdeild, the Icelandic Football League, was founded in 1912, the country&#x27;s first international match was played on 29 July 1930, against the Faroe Islands. Although Iceland won 1–0 away, both teams were at the time unaffiliated with FIFA. The first match officially recognised by FIFA took place in Reykjavík on 17 July 1946, a 0–3 loss to their future rivals Denmark. The first international victory was against Finland in 1947. For the first 20 years of the Football Association of Iceland (KSÍ)&#x27;s existence, the team mostly did not participate in qualifying for the FIFA World Cup or the UEFA European Championship. In 1954, Iceland applied to take part in qualification for the 1954 World Cup, but the application was rejected. In qualification for the 1958 World Cup, Iceland finished last in their group with zero wins, conceding 26 goals.

In 1980, Iceland won the first edition of the friendly tournament known as the Greenland Cup.

Since 1974, the team has taken part in qualifying for every World Cup and European Championship. In 1994, the team reached their then best ever position in the FIFA World Rankings, 37th. This record stood until 2016 when they managed to reach 21st. In a friendly against Estonia on 24 April 1996 in Tallinn, Eiður Smári Guðjohnsen entered as a substitute for his father Arnór. This marked the first time that a father and son played in the same international match.

===21st century===

In qualification for Euro 2004, Iceland finished third in their group, one point behind Scotland. As a result, they failed to qualify for a playoff spot.

However, the following qualifying campaigns will be much more difficult for Iceland which will flirt with the last places of its respective groups, in particular during the Euro 2008 qualifiers where despite two unexpected successes against Northern Ireland (3–0 in the opening away, 2–1 at home in the return) and a heroic resistance in the first and second leg against the Spanish future winners of the competition (a 1–1 draw at home after having led the score and a short 0–1 defeat away), Our boys suffered several other heavy defeats, including two against Latvia, who had qualified for Euro 2004 as a surprise (0–4 away, 2–4 home), and one against Liechtenstein (0–3 away, after a 1–1 home draw).

The reasons for the lack of results of the selection were due to the absence of professionals on the island, the Icelanders played soccer for fun. Moreover, the hostile climate where winter lasts 8 months did not help the development of the sport, there were only two synthetic fields forcing the footballers to train on the gravel or in the snow. In the 2000s, Icelandic soccer will experience a real revolution. The economic boom will allow the authorities to create important structures with indoor pitches in synthetic turf, which results in the practice of soccer all year round without worrying about the weather conditions outside. These new structures encourage young people to turn to sports and even lead to a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption among teenagers.

In 2014, Iceland almost secured qualification for their first World Cup. Finishing second in Group D, they played Croatia in a two-leg playoff for qualification. After holding them to a 0–0 draw in the home leg, they lost 2–0 away.

====Euro 2016====
Iceland qualified for a major tournament for the first time in 2015 after finishing second in Group A of qualification for Euro 2016, losing only two games, and beating the Netherlands – which had finished third in the 2014 World Cup – twice. During the qualification, they reached their then highest ranking in the FIFA World Rankings, 23rd. Iceland were drawn into a group with Portugal, Hungary and Austria for the final tournament.

At the tournament finals, Iceland recorded 1–1 draws in their first two group stage matches against Portugal and Hungary. They then advanced from their group with a 2–1 victory against Austria. Iceland qualified for the tournament&#x27;s quarter-finals after a 2–1 upset win over England in the Round of 16, which led to England manager Roy Hodgson resigning in disgrace immediately after the final whistle. However, they were eliminated by host nation France in the quarter-finals, 5–2.
====2018 World Cup====
Iceland qualified for the 2018 World Cup, their first ever appearance in the world championship and second major tournament overall, securing qualification on 9 October 2017 after a 2–0 win against Kosovo. In doing so, they became the lowest-populated country ever to reach the finals. Iceland were drawn to play Croatia, Argentina and Nigeria in a group that was considered by many as the &quot;group of death&quot;. Despite a challenging group, Iceland were tipped to advance from the group by several journalist websites, based on their impressive performance in Euro 2016. Their maiden match at the World Cup was against 2014 runners-up Argentina, with Iceland holding Argentina to a 1–1 draw. However, their chances of advancing from the group were hurt following a 2–0 loss to Nigeria, with several missed opportunities in the first half and a penalty kick in the second half missed by Gylfi Sigurðsson, putting Iceland in position to play a decisive match against already qualified Croatia. Iceland lost to Croatia in their final group game and were eliminated; and because Argentina won against Nigeria, Iceland finished bottom of the group with a single point.

====2018–19 UEFA Nations League====
After Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, Iceland participated in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, in which they were in Group 2 of League A with Switzerland and Belgium. Many of Iceland&#x27;s international matches in this competition were undermined by the repeated absence of some of their key players, often due to injury. Iceland lost all four games and faced relegation to League B, but due to a rule change by UEFA, Iceland was not relegated to League B for the 2020–2021 edition.

====Euro 2020 qualifiers====
In group H of the Euro qualifiers with the world champions France, Turkey, Albania, Andorra and Moldova. Iceland lost both confrontations against &quot;Les Bleus&quot; (4–0 at the Stade de France and 1–0 at home on a penalty kick after the hour of play at the end of a tight game) and the away match against Albania 4–2, though achieved a win and a draw against Turkey. Iceland finished third behind France and Turkey and advanced to the playoffs, where they defeated Romania 2–1. On 12 November 2020, in their playoff game against Hungary, Iceland nearly secured qualification for Euro 2020, having led 1–0 for most of the match, thanks to a direct free kick by Gylfi Sigurðsson. However, Hungary scored two goals in under five minutes, the first in the 88th minute by Loïc Nego and the second in the second minute of added time by Dominik Szoboszlai, proving to be the winner, thereby securing qualification at Iceland&#x27;s expense.

Iceland had also suffered poor results in their UEFA Nations League campaign in League A, having lost all their group stage matches and failing to garner a single point, resulting in their relegation to League B the following season. Manager Erik Hamrén ultimately resigned, following their poor performance that year.

====2022 World Cup qualifiers====
Iceland also had a poor start to 2022 World Cup qualifiers, suffering two defeats at the beginning of the tournament, away against Germany (0–3) and Armenia (0–2). Preparation for the September games, where Iceland had the advantage of playing all three games at home after several away games and had played some encouraging friendlies in June, was disrupted by extra-sporting affairs involving both Kolbeinn Sigþórsson and Gylfi Sigurðsson accused of sexual offences and thus absent from the month&#x27;s games. The cases also led to the resignation of several senior officials of the Icelandic Football Association, including its president. In the aftermath of these affairs, Iceland lost against Romania (0–2), drew against North Macedonia (2–2), and suffered a heavy loss against Germany (0–4); these results left Iceland in second-to-last place in Group J with four matches remaining. In the two October games, Iceland drew against Armenia (1–1) and defeated Liechtenstein (4–0). Despite these results, along with an away draw against Romania (0–0), Iceland was mathematically eliminated with one day remaining, being unable to recover enough points to reach second place.

This run of poor results has been attributed to several factors, both sporting and extra-sporting: the late generational renewal, a process partly hampered by a limited pool of footballers due to Iceland&#x27;s demographics; the questionable tactical choices of the new coach, resulting in a lack of automatism among new players who are not used to playing together and the absence of a real standard team; and sexual assault scandals that have effectively sidelined some of the team&#x27;s best players under investigation.

====Euro 2024 qualifiers====
The Euro 2024 qualifiers have also got off to a poor start in terms of results, with just one win and 3 defeats after 4 matches and a provisional penultimate place. Iceland were swept aside in Bosnia (0–3), before recording the biggest official victory in their history against Liechtenstein (7–0). Following a long series of poor results, Icelandic coach Arnar Viðarsson was sacked and replaced by Norwegian Åge Hareide. Under the new coach and after two away games, Iceland hosted Slovakia and Portugal, but both matches ended in defeat. First, &quot;Strákarnir okkar&quot; lost to the Slovaks (1–2) after a crude defensive error with a direct clearance to Tomáš Suslov, who scored Slovakia&#x27;s 2nd goal when the teams were level. Iceland then put in a better performance than in their previous matches against group favourites Portugal, demonstrating excellent tactical organization and keeping the Lusitanians at bay for long periods. However, a goal by Cristiano Ronaldo on his 200th appearance for Portugal, initially disallowed but then validated by VAR at the very end of normal time, sealed Portugal&#x27;s victory (0–1), shortly after the Nordic side had been reduced to 10 men following a second yellow card for Willum Þór Willumsson. Iceland finished 4th in their group with a disappointing record of 3 wins, 1 draw and 6 defeats, but were eligible for the play-offs thanks to their performance in the Nations League. In the semi-final of the Path B play-offs, Iceland set a benchmark against a top 100 FIFA team for the first time in several years by brushing aside Israel 4–1, thanks to a hat-trick from Albert Guðmundsson, while Israel finished the match with 10 men and missed a penalty to equalise. In the decisive match against Ukraine, Iceland opened the scoring through Albert Guðmundsson and led at half-time, but conceded 2 goals in the second half and lost (1–2) in a similar fashion to the previous Euro play-off lost in Budapest against the Hungarians.

==Team image==
The national team uses blue as the home colours and white as their second colours; their crest features stylized imagery of Iceland&#x27;s four landvættir (&quot;guardian spirits&quot;) in local folklore: a giant, a dragon, a bull, and an eagle. The team&#x27;s crest was adopted in 2020 and was designed by Reykjavík-based firm Bradenburg. Previously the team had used a team crest which featured a shield-type symbol which consisted of the abbreviation of the Football Association of Iceland in Icelandic (KSI), stripes in the colors of the Flag of Iceland, and a football.

Iceland&#x27;s supporters became known for using the Viking Thunder Clap chant in the mid-2010s, which involves fans clapping their hands above their heads and yelling &quot;huh!&quot; to the beat of a drum; the tradition originates from Scottish club Motherwell. Iceland&#x27;s Viking Clap first received wider international attention during Euro 2016.

===Kit providers===
The official kit is produced by German sports manufacturing company Puma since 2020. Before that the kit providers were Umbro (1975), Adidas (1976–1992), ABM (1992–1996), Reusch (1996–2001) and Erreà (2002–2020)

<text>Sousse or Soussa (, ) is a city in Tunisia, capital of the Sousse Governorate. Located south of the capital Tunis, the city has 271,428 inhabitants . Sousse is in the central-east of the country, on the Gulf of Hammamet, which is a part of the Mediterranean Sea. Its economy is based on transport equipment, processed food, olive oil, textiles, and tourism. It is home to the Université de Sousse.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Sousse&quot; and &quot;Soussa&quot; are both French spellings of the Arabic name &quot;Sūsa&quot;. The present city has also grown to include the ruins of Hadrumetum, which had many names in several languages during antiquity.

==Geography==

Sousse is in eastern Tunisia, on the Tunisian Sahel coast bordering the Mediterranean Sea bordering. The city covers 45 km2 and is 25 meters above sea level.

Sousse is between two wadis: the Wadi Bliban (and its tributary the Wadi al-Kharrub) to the north and northwest and the Wadi al-Halluf to the southeast. The subsoil is mostly sedimentary with some deep alluvial deposits, which are more recent closer to the coast. Winters are generally mild, there is an average of 69 days of rainfall per year, and there is a lot of sunshine year-round with relatively few cloudy days.

=== Administration ===
The Municipality of Sousse is the capital of a governorate that extends over 2669 km2. It is divided into four municipal districts: &quot;Sousse Nord&quot;, &quot;Sousse Sud&quot;, &quot;Sousse Médina&quot; and &quot;Sousse Riadh&quot;. The first two were created on 11 February 1976 and the last two on 19 February 1982. Its main constituencies and Delegation are four in number: Sousse Sidi Abdelhamid, Sousse Médina, Sousse Jawhara and Sousse Riadh. Its geographic code is 31.

==History==
===Hadrumetum===

In the 11th centuryBC, Tyrians established Hadrumetum as a trading post and waypoint along their trade routes to Italy and the Strait of Gibraltar. Its establishment (at a river mouth about north of old Sousse) preceded Carthage&#x27;s but, like other western Phoenician colonies, it became part of the Carthaginian Empire following &#x27;s long siege of Tyre in the 580s and 570sBC.

The city featured in the Third Sicilian War, the Second and Third Punic Wars (in the latter of which it secured additional territory and special privileges by aiding Rome against what was left of the Carthaginians), and Caesar&#x27;s Civil War, when it was the scene of Caesar&#x27;s famously deft recovery: upon tripping while coming ashore, he dealt with the poor omen this threatened to become by grabbing handfuls of dirt and proclaiming &quot;I have you now, Africa!&quot; () The second city in Roman Africa after Carthage, it became the capital of the province of Byzacena during the Diocletianic Reforms. Its native sons included the jurist Salvius Julianus, the emperor Clodius Albinus, and numerous Christian saints. The Roman and Byzantine catacombs beneath the city are extensive: they were mainly investigated in 1913-1927 by French missionaries and soldiers. 

The Vandals sacked Hadrumetum in 434 but it remained a place of importance within their kingdom; a bishop and proconsul were martyred there during the Vandals&#x27; periodic forced conversions of their subjects to Arianism. The Byzantine Empire reconquered the town in 534 during the Vandal War and engaged in a public works program that included new fortifications and churches. The town was sacked during the Umayyad Caliphate&#x27;s 7th-century conquest of North Africa. According to a 1987 ICOMOS report, Uqba ibn Nafi&#x27;s siege and capture of the city resulted in its almost complete destruction, such that no monument of Hadrumetum &quot;subsists in situ&quot;.

===Medieval Susa===
Muslim Arab armies rapidly spread Arab culture across what had been a thoroughly Romanized and Christianized landscape. Under the Aghlabids, Susa was established near the ruins of Hadrumetum and served as their main port. Their 827 invasion of Sicily was mainly launched from the town&#x27;s harbor. After the Byzantine city of Melite (modern Mdina on Malta) was captured by the Aghlabids in 870, marble from its churches was used to build the Ribat. A soaring structure that combined the purposes of a minaret and a watch tower, it remains in outstanding condition and draws visitors from around the world. Its mosque is sometimes accounted the oldest surviving in the region and the town&#x27;s main mosque, also built during the 9th century, has a similarly fortress-like appearance.

Susa was briefly occupied by Norman Sicily in the 12th century; it fell to the Ottoman Empire in the 16th; and it was bombarded by a French and Venetian fleet in the 18th.

Medieval Susa was known for its textile industries, producing silk and flax fabrics called &quot;Sūsī&quot;. Especially renowned were its robes called , some of which were mass-produced and sold ready-to-wear throughout the Mediterranean.

After the decline of Mahdia in the 15th and 16th centuries, Susa remained as the most important town in the Sahel region, with a population of about 15,000.

===Colonial Sousse===

Tunisia became a French protectorate in 1881. Around the end of the 19th century, Sousse had a population of 7,000 and was the second-most-important city in Tunisia after Tunis itself. At this point, the entire population of Sousse lived in the walled &quot;medina&quot;. The medina was surrounded by agricultural settlements, two of which - Kala Kebira and Msaken - were more densely populated than the city itself. The French Protectorate reinforced Sousse&#x27;s role as a commercial and administrative center by establishing public buildings, enlarging the city&#x27;s port, and building railways. Between 1896 and 1911, railways were built connecting Sousse with Tunis, Kairouan, Sfax, Mahdia, Moknin, and Henshir Suwatir. Food industries were also established in the city.

Before the First World War, Sousse had about 25,000 inhabitants, including around 10,000 French and roughly 5,000 other Europeans, mostly Italians and Maltese. The port was the garrison of the 4th Tunisian Rifle Regiment.

The first developments outside the &quot;medina&quot; walls were begun during this period, but they were home to a relatively small number of people until after the Second World War. Sousse was devastated by the war and suffered 39 bombardments between December 1942 and May 1943. In 1946, after the war was over, the authorities decided to give a high priority to reconstruction efforts in Sousse.

===Modern Sousse===
When Tunisia became independent in 1956, Sousse was made a &quot;wileya&quot; capital and it continued to expand in all directions. Over the course of the 20th century, its growth was explosive: from just 8,577 residents in 1885, it had grown to 134,835 residents in 1994. Its physical area had also increased massively, from a compact 29 hectares in 1881 to 3,100 hectares in 1992. The secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy also grew accordingly.

Sousse has retained the Arabian look and feel it assumed in the centuries after its initial conquest. Today it is considered one of the best examples of seaward-facing fortifications built by the Arabs. With a population of about 200,000, Sousse retains a medieval heart of narrow, twisted streets, a kasbah and medina, its &quot;ribat&quot; fortress and long wall on the Mediterranean. Surrounding it is a modern city of long, straight roads and more widely spaced buildings.

Sousse was the site of the chess interzonal in 1967, made famous when American Grandmaster Bobby Fischer withdrew from the tournament even though he was in first place at the time.

On 26 June 2015, a lone gunman, Seifeddine Rezgui Yacoubi, opened fire on tourists sunbathing on a beach near the Riu Imperial Marhaba and Soviva hotels, killing 38 and wounding 39, before being shot dead by the police.

== Cityscape ==
== Demography ==
As of 2019, Sousse&#x27;s population was 737,027. Males represent 50.1% of the population structure (with a population of 509,456) against 49.9% by females (with a population of 507,426) in 2014.

==Public services==

The city contains the University of Sousse, formerly known as the University of the Center, including its Ibn El Jazzar, Faculty of Medicine, the Sousse National School of Engineers, and the Higher Institute of Music of Sousse, founded in 1999.

There are a number of high schools, such as the pilot high school of Sousse, the boys&#x27; high school, the Tahar-Sfar high school (formerly the young girls&#x27; high school), the 20 – March 1934 high school (technical high school), the Abdelaziz-El-Bahi high school or the Jawhara high school, and colleges, such as the Pilot College of Sousse, the Mohamed El Aroui College and the Constantine College.

Sousse is served by a hospital, the Hospital of Sahloul, the largest in the region.

==Economy==
Sousse&#x27;s most important economic activity takes place in the tertiary sector, which employs over 50% of the city&#x27;s workforce and includes administration, education, healthcare, trade, communications, and banking. Not far behind is the secondary sector, which employs another 45% of the city&#x27;s workers and includes industries like textiles and leather, construction, chemicals, electronics, and mechanical and electrical components. The small remainder is engaged in the primary sector, mainly fishing. Although smaller than the port in Sfax, Sousse has a port that serves an important commercial outlet for central Tunisia, particularly for the regions around Kairouan and Kasserine.

Sousse is the third largest city in Tunisia after Tunis and Sfax. Although it is associated with olive oil manufacture and has other industries, tourism predominates today. An olive grove covering more than constitutes one of its main riches since antiquity. The busy port near downtown adds a touch of liveliness to its activity. Sousse also had many oil wells in the area during its colonial period.

===Tourism===
Sousse is an important tourist resort. It has a hot semi-arid climate, with the seaside location moderating the climate, making it an all-season resort with hot, dry summers and warm, mild, wet winters. The fine sandy beaches are backed by orchards and olive groves.

Only from Monastir and Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport, hotel complexes with a capacity of 40,000 beds extend from the old city (medina) north along the seafront to Port El Kantaoui. Some 1,200,000 visitors come every year to enjoy its hotels and restaurants, nightclubs, casinos, beaches, and sports facilities.

Sousse is considered a popular tourist destination, especially due to its nightlife. Well-known nightclubs include Bora Bora, Living, Rediguana, Platinum, and The Saloon. The top producers and DJs in dance come to play at the various clubs. The season traditionally begins at the start of June and finishes on the first weekend of October with the closing parties.

==Transport==
Sousse is well-connected with the main Tunisian Railways network, having non-electrified lines to Tunis (since 1899), Sfax (since 1911), and Kasserine (since 2004) with diesel multiple unit and locomotive-driven trains. The main Gare Sousse terminus is in the city center, while Gare Kalaa Seghira serves a bypass route.

Since 2010 the electrified Sahel Metro line goes south to Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport, Monastir, and Mahdia. This line has the Sousse - Bab Jadid station as its northern terminus in Sousse&#x27;s city center, and 4 additional stations in the city.

Intercity buses and red-strip microbuses (so-called &quot;louages&quot;) connect Sousse with many cities in Tunisia. Urban transit in Sousse is served by routes of articulated and conventional buses, blue-strip louages, and cheap taxis. The Sousse–Kairouan Decauville railway operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to gauge.

==Sights==
=== Medina ===
A medina, surrounded by its city walls and fortifications, is of historical interest. The medina includes open and covered bazaars (souks). Buildings of historical interest include the &quot;ribat&quot; castle, the central mosque, and a historical museum in the Casbah with mosaics from the area&#x27;s many Roman villas. The Carthaginian catacombs can be visited.

UNESCO declared the medina of Sousse a World Heritage Site in 1988, citing among various things its preservation from modern development.

=== Port Kantaoui ===

The Kantaoui Port, is a touristic station in the form of a Port. It was built in 1979 specifically as a tourist center.

The architecture, although modern and dazzlingly white, has been modeled on the more traditional buildings in Tunisia, complete with narrow streets and arches. The hotels that line the beachfront extend from Sousse itself along miles of sparkling clean sea to the harbor of Port El Kantaoui and to the north of the harbor.

=== Religious buildings ===
==== Great Mosque ====
Located at the entrance to the medina, it was erected by the Aghlabid sovereign Aboul Abbas I (841–856) in 850–851, almost thirty years after the construction of the Ribat of Sousse. This mosque is the most emblematic of a city that became a few years after the reign of Ziadet-Allah I (817–838), the second city of Ifriqiya and the Sahel. Subsequently, the building is enlarged during the reign of Ibrahim II (875–902).

Football is the city&#x27;s most popular sport, and ES Sahel has won the Tunisian football championship ten times and the Tunisian Cup ten times. The team&#x27;s home ground is Stade Olympique de Sousse. Handball, basketball, and volleyball are also popular.

==Climate==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Sousse&#x27;s climate as hot semi-arid (&quot;BSh&quot;) bordering with hot-summer Mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot;) and cool semi-arid (&quot;BSk&quot;).

<text>Benjamin Franklin Tracy (April 26, 1830August 6, 1915) was a United States political figure who served as Secretary of the Navy from 1889 through 1893, during the administration of U.S. President Benjamin Harrison.

==Biography==
He was born in the hamlet of Apalachin located in the Town of Owego, New York, on April 26, 1830.

Tracy was a lawyer active in Republican Party politics during the 1850s. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Tioga Co.) in 1862.

He served in the Union Army during the Civil War, and commanded the 109th New York Infantry Regiment. At the Battle of the Wilderness in May, 1864, he was able to rally his men and hold the Union line. For his actions he subsequently was awarded the Medal of Honor. His citation reads: Tracy &quot;seized the colors and led the regiment when other regiments had retired and then reformed his line and held it.&quot; Later that year, he became commandant of the Elmira prisoner of war camp, before being appointed Colonel of the 127th Infantry, U.S. Colored Troops, on August 23, 1864. Tracy was discharged from the volunteer service on June 13, 1865. On January 18, 1867, President Andrew Johnson nominated Tracy for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 21, 1867.

He resumed the practice of law after the war, and became active in New York state politics. He was United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York from 1866 to 1877. In December 1881, he was appointed by Governor Alonzo B. Cornell to the New York Court of Appeals to fill the vacancy caused by the appointment of Judge Charles Andrews as Chief Judge after the resignation of Charles J. Folger. Tracy remained on the bench until the end of 1882 when Andrews resumed his seat after being defeated by William C. Ruger in the election for Chief Judge.

In 1875, Tracy defended the well-known preacher Henry Ward Beecher during his highly publicized trial for adultery.

On March 5, 1889, Tracy was nominated by President Benjamin Harrison to become Secretary of the Navy and was confirmed by the Senate in a ten-minute session without objection. He formally took office on March 6.

On February 3, 1890, Tracy&#x27;s wife and younger daughter died in a fire at their residence in Washington, D.C. His wife, Belinda, died by falling out a window in an attempt to escape the building, and his daughter, Mary, died from smoke inhalation. Tracy himself lost consciousness due to the smoke but was rescued by Chief Joseph Parris of the D.C. Fire Department. The secretary&#x27;s elder daughter, Emma, and his granddaughter, Alice, sustained injuries from jumping out a window, but both survived. After regaining consciousness some time later, Tracy learned of the deaths of his loved ones from President Harrison. A funeral was held at the White House several days later, and the bodies of the dead were buried in Rock Creek Cemetery. Following a brief period of mourning, during which he received many messages of condolences from heads of state and other prominent individuals, Tracy returned to his official duties.

Tracy was noted for his role in the creation of the &quot;New Navy&quot;, a major reform of the service, which had fallen into obsolescence after the Civil War. Like President Harrison, he supported a naval strategy focused more on offense, rather than on coastal defense and commerce raiding. A major ally in this effort was naval theorist Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, who had served as a professor at the new Naval War College (founded 1884). In 1890, Mahan published his major work, &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783&quot;—a book that achieved an international readership. Drawing on historical examples, Mahan supported the construction of a &quot;blue-water Navy&quot; that could do battle on the high seas.

Tracy also supported the construction of modern warships. On June 30, 1890, Congress passed the Naval Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1891 (also known as the Battleship Act of 1890), a measure which authorized the construction of three battleships. The first three were later named , , and . The battleship was authorized two years later.

In the 1896 presidential election, Tracy was a presidential elector for William McKinley and Garret Hobart.

After leaving the Navy Department, Tracy again took up his legal practice. In 1896 he defended New York City Police commissioner Andrew Parker from accusations of negligence and incompetence by fellow commissioner Theodore Roosevelt in a performance that significantly embarrassed Roosevelt. He also helped end the Venezuela Crisis of 1895 by assisting Venezuela in negotiating a settlement to their boundary dispute with Great Britain.

Tracy was the Republican candidate to be the first Mayor of Greater New York City when the five boroughs consolidated in 1898. He came in third behind Democrat Robert A. Van Wyck and Seth Low of the Citizens&#x27; Union, winning 101,863 of the 523,560 votes cast in the election of 1897. Tracy was the president of the New York State Agricultural Society in 1897 and 1898, during which time he invited Van Wyck to attend the society&#x27;s annual fair.

On April 3, 1900, seven men from the International Banking and Trust Company were elected as directors of the North American Trust Company. They included president Oakleigh Thorne of the International, as well as Tracy.

<doc id="1008967" wikidata="Q859770" url="?curid=1008967" title="2000 Mozambique flood">
<text>The 2000 Mozambique flood was a natural disaster that occurred in February and March 2000. The catastrophic flooding was caused by heavy rainfall caused by Cyclone Leon-Eline that lasted for four weeks and made many homeless. Approximately 800 people died, 1400 km2 of arable land was affected and 20,000 head of cattle and food were lost. It was the worst flood in Mozambique in 50 years.

==Meteorological history==
In October and November 1999, heavy rainfall affected Mozambique, followed by a period of heavy rainfall in January 2000. By the end of January 2000, the rains caused the Incomati, the Umbeluzi, and the Limpopo rivers to exceed their banks, inundating portions of the capital Maputo. At Chókwè, the Limpopo River reached a level of on January 24, twice its normal level. Some areas received a year&#x27;s worth of rainfall in two weeks. The resultant floods were considered the worst to affect the nations since 1951.

Flooding was beginning to recede in late February by the time Cyclone Eline made landfall. Eline was a long-lasting tropical cyclone that struck near Beira at peak intensity on February 22. By the end of February 2000, the situation was considered the country&#x27;s worst natural disaster in a century.

==Impact==
By late February, the flooding had already caused increases in malaria and diarrhea. Flooding also disrupted water supply and covered roads, with the primary north-south highway cut in three locations. Widespread areas were inundated, which displaced about 220,000 people, and killed about 150 people before Eline struck.

The combined effects of the preceding floods and Eline left about 463,000 people displaced or homeless, including 46,000 children five years old or younger. Overall, the preceding floods and Eline caused about 700 deaths, half in Chokwe. with damage estimated at $500 million (2000 USD). The cyclone and the floods disrupted much of the economic progress Mozambique had made in the 1990s since the end of its civil war.

==Aftermath==
Before the arrival of Eline, the government of Mozambique appealed to the international community for assistance in response to the flooding, and countries were beginning to provide relief. Mozambique&#x27;s president at the time, Joaquim Chissano, requested for additional aid after Eline struck, asking for $65 million for both reconstruction and emergency aid, and later increasing the request to $160 million. By March 17, various countries had pledged $119 million to Mozambique. By March 4, 39.6 tons of various relief goods reached the country, which nearly overwhelmed the small airport at Maputo.

The government of the Netherlands donated 5 million guilders (US$2.2 million) to the country, following an earlier donation of about 2 million guilders (US$871,000). The Italian government earmarked 10 billion lira, half of which for immediate emergency assistance, and Denmark earmarked €2.68 million euros. Sweden sent 10 million krona and Ireland €507,000 to the World Food Programme. Portugal delivered 40 tons worth of aid, including food, medicine, tents, and dinghies, and the Spanish Red Cross sent two flights of aid. Canada provided about $11.6 million (CAD) to Mozambique, while the United States provided $7 million worth of food via its Agency for International Development, part of its $50 million contribution. The European Community Humanitarian Aid Office provided €25 million in early March. Botswana donated P23 million pula (BWP, US$5 million), and Mauritius provided about $100,000 (USD). The nation of Ghana flew $100,000 worth of food and clothing to Mozambique. Australia also provided $1 million to the country, and Saudi Arabia flew two planes&#x27; worth of aid. Concern Worldwide allocated $650,000 (USD) at the end of February. Médecins Sans Frontières sent a crew of five people to Buzi to help residents. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation sent $350,000 to CARE in early March. Through the Jubilee 2000, most wealthy nations postponed debt payments for one year. The United Kingdom canceled its $150 million debt in late February, and Italy canceled its $500 million debt in March.

The Mozambique government used boats to evacuate residents in flood zones, setting up 121 camps for evacuees. However, the country had a limited capacity for widespread rescues due to insufficient helicopters. South Africa sent a fleet of twelve planes and helicopters to operate search and rescue missions, as well as airdropping food. They were assisted by two helicopters from Malawi, six from the United Kingdom, and ten from Germany. By March 7, the fleet of 29 helicopters had rescued 14,204 people. Residual floodwaters contributed to outbreaks of malaria and cholera, with malaria infections at four times the usual rate killing at least 11 people. Areas in southern Mozambique also lost access to clean water, furthering dehydration and illnesses. In addition, the United Nations Mine Action Service expressed concern that the floods shifted the locations of landmines left over from the nation&#x27;s civil war. Later, the remnants of Cyclone Gloria halted relief work due to heavy rainfall. Residents began returning home in early March after floodwaters receded.

<text>Linda McRae (born Linda Mae Humphries) is a Canadian folk-roots-Americana musician. A multi-instrumentalist (clawhammer banjo, acoustic and electric guitars, accordion, bass, and Porchboard stomp box) singer-songwriter, she is a former member of Spirit of the West. She has released five albums, &quot;Flying Jenny&quot;, &quot;Cryin’ Out Loud,&quot; &quot;Carve It to the Heart,&quot; &quot;Rough Edges and Ragged Hearts&quot; and her most recent release, a career retrospective entitled &quot;50 Shades of Red&quot; (June 2014).

==Career==
She earned two platinum and three gold records as a long-time member of Spirit of the West. She left the band to resume her solo career and has since released four critically acclaimed recordings: &quot;Flying Jenny&quot; with producer Colin Linden (Bruce Cockburn, Bob Dylan), &quot;Cryin’ Out Loud,&quot; producer Gurf Morlix (Lucinda Williams, Mary Gauthier), &quot;Carve It to the Heart&quot; with Marc L’Esperance and herself as producers.

Her fourth release &quot;Rough Edges and Ragged Hearts&quot; she also produced with L’Esperance and featured performers including the Sojourners, Doug Cox, Gurf Morlix, Ray Bonneville and Samantha Parton (of Be Good Tanyas). Charting No. 1 at CKUA, No. 4 Top Canadian Album, and Nos. 1 and 2 Top Canadian Songs (&quot;Rough Edges &amp; Ragged Hearts&quot; and &quot;Be Your Own Light&quot;) and No. 8 Top Canadian Artists on the Folk DJs list, the recording also earned five-star reviews in &quot;No Depression&quot; and &quot;Rock Star Weekly&quot;, and 4.5 stars in &quot;Penguin Eggs&quot;. As of November 2013 it&#x27;s also been on the Roots Music Report charts for 50 weeks straight.

McRae&#x27;s song &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; was also included on the Skydiggers summer 2013 CD entitled &quot;No. 1 Northern&quot; which included songs by Canadian artists Gordon Lightfoot, Ron Sexsmith, and Neil Young. &quot;Montreal Gazette, Metro Winnipeg,&quot; and the &quot;Nova Scotia Herald&quot; included her as among these Canadian &quot;greats&quot;. Other co-recordings and performances include those with Bruce Cockburn, The Wonder Stuff, Neko Case, Alejandro Escovedo, and Ray Waylie Hubbard, and another with Gurf Morlix.

Recent performances include Plainsong Festival in Nebraska, Yukon Arts Centre, Vancouver Island Music Festival in British Columbia; South Country Fair in Alberta; Barbican Theatre, London; Maverick Festival, UK; the Bluebird Café, Nashville, Tennessee; and New Folsom Prison, California&#x27;s infamous maximum-security prison where she performed and facilitated writing workshops for the inmates. These workshops lead to the creation of her Express Yourself Writing Workshops currently being presented in detox centres, alternative schools, and youth and adult correctional facilities across North America.

McRae has partnered with the following festivals to continue to present her workshop as part of their community outreach programs: Plainsong Festival (USA), South Country Fair (Canada), Coldsnap Festival (Canada), Hamburg Music Fest (USA), Vancouver Island Music Fest (Canada), Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center (USA), Folk Alliance International (USA), Bread and Roses (USA).

<doc id="1008972" wikidata="Q110719" url="?curid=1008972" title="Oskar Lafontaine">
<text>Oskar Lafontaine (; born 16 September 1943) is a German politician. He served as Minister-President of the state of Saarland from 1985 to 1998 and was federal leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) from 1995 to 1999. He was the lead candidate for the SPD in the 1990 German federal election, but lost by a wide margin. He served as Minister of Finance under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder after the SPD&#x27;s victory in the 1998 federal election, but resigned from both the ministry and Bundestag less than six months later, positioning himself as a popular opponent of Schröder&#x27;s policies in the tabloid press.

In the lead-up to the 2005 federal election, as a reaction to Schröder&#x27;s Agenda 2010 reforms, Lafontaine co-founded the left-wing party Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative. Following a merger with the Party of Democratic Socialism in June 2007, he became co-chairman of The Left. He was the lead candidate for the Saarland branch of the party in the 2009 Saarland state election, where it won over 20% of the vote. He announced his resignation from all federal political functions after being diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2009. He retained his position as a member of the Saarland legislature and from May 2012 to 2022 he was the leader of the opposition in Saarland. Lafontaine resigned from the Left Party on 17 March 2022 because it was no longer an &quot;alternative to the politics of social insecurity and inequality,&quot; he said.

==Family and education==
Lafontaine was born in Saarlautern (now Saarlouis) into a family of craftsmen. His father, Hans Lafontaine, was a professional baker and was killed serving in World War II. He spent his childhood living with his mother, Katharina (née Ferner), and his twin brother, Hans, in Dillingen.

He attended a Catholic episcopal boarding institution in Prüm and there was educated at the Regino-Gymnasium, a public school. He left school in 1962 and received a scholarship from Cusanuswerk, the scholarship body of the Catholic Church in Germany, to study physics at the universities of Bonn and Saarland. Lafontaine graduated in 1969; his thesis concerned the production of monocrystalline barium titanate. He worked for &quot;Versorgungs- und Verkehrsgesellschaft&quot; Saarbrücken until 1974, serving on its board from 1971.

Lafontaine has been married four times and has two sons by his second and third wives. Lafontaine was married to Ingrid Bachert from 1967 to 1982. From 1982 to 1988 he was married to the artist Margret Müller. Together they have a son (Frederic, born 1982). From 1993 to 2013 he was married to Christa Müller. They have a son together (Carl-Maurice, born 1997). In November 2011, Lafontaine officially presented fellow politician Sahra Wagenknecht as his new girlfriend, who is 26 years his junior. Since 22 December 2014 they have been married. He is a non-practising Catholic.

==Political rise==
Lafontaine rose to prominence locally as mayor of Saarbrücken and became more widely known as a critic of chancellor Helmut Schmidt&#x27;s support for the NATO plan to deploy Pershing II missiles in Germany. From 1985 to 1998 he served as Minister-President of the Saarland. In this position he struggled to preserve the industrial base of the state, which was based on steel production and coal mining with subsidies, and served as President of the Bundesrat in 1992/93.

==Chancellor candidacy and assassination attempt==

Lafontaine was the SPD&#x27;s candidate for Chancellor in the German federal election of 1990. He faced nearly impossible odds. The election had been called two months after the reunification of Germany, and the incumbent government of Helmut Kohl was in a nearly unassailable position.

During the campaign he was attacked with a knife by a mentally deranged woman after a speech in Cologne. His carotid artery was slashed and he remained in a critical condition for several days.

==Political comeback==
At the &quot;Mannheim convention&quot; in 1995, he was elected chairman of the SPD in a surprise move, replacing Rudolf Scharping. He was mainly responsible for bringing the whole political weight of the SPD to bear against Kohl and his CDU party, rejecting bipartisan cooperation that had characterized German politics for many years. Lafontaine argued that any help given to Kohl would only lengthen his unavoidable demise.

After the SPD&#x27;s unexpectedly clear victory at the polls in September 1998, he was appointed Federal Minister of Finance in the first government of Gerhard Schröder.

==Minister of Finance==
During his short tenure as Minister of Finance, Lafontaine was a main bogeyman of UK Eurosceptics. This was because, among other things, he had called for the prompt tax harmonisation of the European Union, which would have resulted in an increase in UK taxes. In 1998, English tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot; called Lafontaine &quot;Europe&#x27;s most dangerous man&quot;. On 11 March 1999, he resigned from all his official and party offices, claiming that &quot;lack of cooperation&quot; in the cabinet had become unbearable. Until the formation of the Left Party he was known for his attacks against the Schröder government in the tabloid &quot;Bild-Zeitung&quot;, which is generally considered conservative.

==Leaving the SPD, formation of The Left party and later==
On 24 May 2005 Lafontaine left the SPD. After two weeks of speculation it was announced on 10 June that he would run as the lead candidate for The Left party (&quot;Die Linke&quot;), a coalition of the Labor and Social Justice Party (WASG), which was based in western Germany, and the Left Party.PDS, which was the successor to the ruling East German Socialist Unity Party (SED). Lafontaine joined the WASG on 18 June 2005 and was selected to head their list for the 2005 Federal Election in North Rhine-Westphalia on the same day. Moreover, he also unsuccessfully contested the Saarbrücken constituency, which he had previously represented from 1990 to 2002. Nevertheless, the result of the Left party in the Saarland was by far the best in any of the federal states in the West of Germany.

In 2007, when the Left Party was formed in a merger between &quot;Left Party.PDS&quot; and WASG, he became chairman alongside Lothar Bisky.

In May 2009, he declared that &quot;Financial capitalism has failed. We need to democratize the economy. The workforce needs to have a far greater say in their companies than has been the case so far.&quot;

In 2022, he published the book &quot;Ami, it&#x27;s time to go&quot; where he criticizes NATO and American influence in German politics, arguing that Germany has become an American vassal state. The book became a bestseller.

In 2024, Lafontaine announced that he had joined the Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW). On 27 January 2024 he spoke at the founding party congress.

==Controversies==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he caused controversy among his left-wing base with a plea for pro-business policies and a call for the reduction of immigrants and asylum-seekers.

At one event in 2005, Lafontaine described &quot;Fremdarbeiter&quot; (&quot;foreign workers&quot;, a term associated with the Nazi regime) as a threat to German labour. He said afterwards that he had misspoken, but in an article published in &quot;Die Welt&quot;, a group of prominent German writers accused him of deliberately appealing to xenophobic and far-right voters.

Lafontaine lives in a manor-like house, commonly known as the &quot;palace of social justice&quot; (&quot;Palast der sozialen Gerechtigkeit&quot;). When asked by the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; about whether this could be in conflict with his socialist ideas, Lafontaine said politicians of the left do not have to be poor, but they have to fight against poverty.

In a column published by the same newspaper Lafontaine criticized the expansion of wind power, citing the alleged &quot;destruction of the German Cultural landscape&quot; as a cause for his objection. The Alliance 90/The Greens top candidate Barbara Meyer-Gluche pushed back at this stance and accused Lafontaine of &quot;irrational fearmongering&quot;.

<text>The Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team (; ; ) represents Bosnia and Herzegovina in men&#x27;s international football competitions, and is governed by the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Until 1992, Bosnian footballers played for Yugoslavia.

Bosnia and Herzegovina achieved their best result when they reached the 2014 FIFA World Cup as winners of their qualifying group. They were eliminated after narrow group stage losses to Argentina and Nigeria and a win over Iran.

The national team has never taken part in a UEFA European Championship.

The team&#x27;s highest FIFA World Ranking was 13th, achieved in August 2013.

==History==
Bosnia and Herzegovina have seen a steady rise in their fortunes on the international football stage in recent times. Historically, they have managed multiple play-off appearances and qualified for one FIFA World Cup. More often than not, the team produces solid results in qualifiers and challenges for a top spot.

From 1920 to 1992, the players lined up for Yugoslavia, but following the outbreak of the Bosnian War and subsequent independence, a new football nation arose from the ashes.

The early period saw Bosnia and Herzegovina have to wait until the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers to compete for a place in a major competition. Bosnia and Herzegovina finished fourth in a group that included Greece, Denmark, Croatia and Slovenia. This was then subsequently followed by further disappointment with lackluster campaigns in the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifiers, as well as the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

This early period was followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina coming very close to qualifying directly for their first major competition, UEFA Euro 2004, narrowly missing out by a single goal against Denmark.

Bosnia and Herzegovina failed to make the grade in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, despite being unbeaten at home, and the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers, which saw their poor home form cost them. Bosnia and Herzegovina then experienced double heartbreak, bowing out twice in the playoffs to Portugal, first 2–0 on aggregate in the 2010 FIFA World Cup decider and then 6–2 on aggregate in the UEFA Euro 2012 decider.

Bosnia and Herzegovina qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, their first major tournament, by beating Lithuania in October 2013. They managed to finish third in a group which included Argentina and won their first match 3–1 over Iran. Nigeria pipped them for second place in the group with a 1–0 win marred with controversy following an incorrectly-disallowed goal by Edin Džeko in the first half.

In the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers, Bosnia and Herzegovina finished third behind Belgium and Wales. After a bad start to the qualifiers with a surprise 2–1 defeat at home against Cyprus and managing just two points in four games, Safet Sušić was dismissed and replaced by Mehmed Baždarević.

After the slow start, Bosnian performance improved dramatically, with five wins in their remaining six matches, including victories over Wales and Israel along with three clean sheets. However, they ultimately failed to qualify after a two legged playoff encounter with the Republic of Ireland. Bosnia and Herzegovina failed to make back-to-back FIFA World Cups after failing to qualify to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Bosnia and Herzegovina won their UEFA Nations League group and guaranteed a playoffs berth for UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying. Still, they finished fourth in their UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying group with the manager Robert Prosinečki, missing out on direct qualification and entered the playoffs, and with new manager Dušan Bajević, they ultimately missed out on yet another Euro after losing to Northern Ireland on penalties. They finished bottom of Group 1 in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League A, thus relegating them to the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League B.

Following several years of disappointment, Bulgarian Ivaylo Petev was named as Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s new manager, marking the first time a Bosnia and Herzegovina manager was not from the former Yugoslavia. In their first campaign under Petev, Bosnia and Herzegovina were drawn into a group with 2018 FIFA World Cup champions France and kept their chances of qualification alive until the final two matches; ultimately failing to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. He also led the team to winning Group 3 of the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League B, thus earning promotion back to 2024–25 UEFA Nations League A and guaranteed a play-off berth for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying.

They suffered disappointment in their UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying group that saw three managers: Faruk Hadžibegić, Meho Kodro and Savo Milošević pick up only one win each for a total of 9 points and entered the playoffs. There, they lost 2–1 to Ukraine and were eliminated from UEFA Euro 2024.

===Nickname===
A popular nickname of all Bosnian national teams is &quot;Zmajevi&quot;, popularized by football TV commentator Mustafa Mijajlović during the Belgium vs. Bosnia and Herzegovina (2–4) 2010 WC qualification game on 28 March 2009.

General agreement among Bosnia and Herzegovina sports fans is that this nickname has historical context, as it is considered as an allusion to the famous Bosnian general Husein Gradaščević, who fought for Bosnian autonomy, and who was known as the &quot;Dragon of Bosnia&quot;.

In both local and foreign media, they are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Golden Lilies&quot;, which was the original nickname given to all of the country&#x27;s national teams by fans after independence, in reference to the official state insignia at the time (the flag and the coat of arms), which itself referred to the golden lily, the historical state insignia that was featured on the coat of arms of the ruling Bosnian medieval Kotromanić dynasty.

===Home stadiums===
Currently, the national team uses Grbavica Stadium as its home ground following its renovation in 2018.

Bosnia and Herzegovina also uses Bilino Polje Stadium, located in the city of Zenica, for many of its home games. The stadium, built and opened in 1972, underwent many reconstruction works since 2012 in order to comply with standards needed to host international games.

Another stadium Bosnia and Herzegovina has used is Koševo City Stadium.

Its training ground for domestic matches is the Bosnia and Herzegovina FA Training Centre in Zenica, which was opened in 2013 in conjunction with UEFA.

===Supporters===


A large number of national team&#x27;s supporters come from Northern and Western Europe, North America, and some from as far away as Australia. Most of these fans are members of BHFanaticos, Belaj Boys, BHLegion, Armija Zmajeva (Dragons Army) and Ljuti Krajišnici groups.

In the game against Norway, at the Ullevål Stadium in Oslo on 24 March 2007, Bosnian fans caused an hour-long delay due to an unprecedented amount of flares that had been thrown onto the pitch in protest against corruption in the (now former) Football Federation of Bosnia. On 1 June 2008, former Bosnia and Herzegovina players Meho Kodro and Elvir Bolić organised a friendly humanitarian game in Sarajevo called &quot;Kodro, Bola and Friends&quot; between former Bosnian football legends, in order to gain support, to say its time for changes in the Bosnian Football Association. The game was organised to commence at the same time as Bosnia and Herzegovina national side faced Azerbaijan in a friendly in Zenica. The attendance in Sarajevo was 15,000 while in Zenica only about 50. The game in Sarajevo was organised by the Federalna TV who broadcast the humanitarian game live.
A significant number of Bosnian International players were involved in the game, which ended 11–9 in favour of Team Kodro.

===Kits===

Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s traditional kit colours are blue and white, taken from the country&#x27;s flag. While the current home kits are primarily blue, and the away kits are primarily white, this colour scheme was initially used in reverse order. This is due to the fact that the flag of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (RBiH), used before the Dayton Agreement, was predominately white.

The team kit is currently produced by Spanish sports company Kelme.&lt;ref name=&quot;KELME NOVI TEHNIČKI SPONZOR NS/FS BIH&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The general sponsor of the team is m:tel. Also sponsoring the team are Coca-Cola, ASA Osiguranje, and Privredna banka Sarajevo.

<doc id="1008992" wikidata="Q1051564" url="?curid=1008992" title="Military Revolution">
<text>The Military Revolution is the theory that a series of radical changes in military strategy and tactics during the 16th and 17th centuries resulted in major lasting changes in governments and society. The theory was introduced by Michael Roberts in the 1950s as he focused on Sweden (1560–1660) searching for major changes in the European way of war caused by the introduction of portable firearms. Roberts linked military technology with larger historical consequences, arguing that innovations in tactics, drill and doctrine by the Dutch and Swedes (1560–1660), which maximized the utility of firearms, led to a need for more trained troops and thus for permanent forces (standing armies). Armies grew much larger and more expensive. These changes in turn had major political consequences in the level of administrative support and the supply of money, men and provisions, producing new financial demands and the creation of new governmental institutions. &quot;Thus, argued Roberts, the modern art of war made possible—and necessary—the creation of the modern state&quot;.

In the 1990s the concept was modified and extended by Geoffrey Parker, who argued that developments in fortification and siege warfare caused the revolution. Parker also argues that the military revolution in Europe gave European powers a distinct advantage, making it possible for the relatively small European powers to conquer the Americas, as well as large parts of Africa and Asia. Parker&#x27;s argument has been criticized by Cambridge University political scientist Jason Sharman.

The concept of a military revolution during this time has received a mixed reception among historians. Noted military historians Michael Duffy and Jeremy Black strongly criticized the theory and have described it as misleading, exaggerated, and simplistic.

==Origin of the concept==
Roberts first proposed the concept of a military revolution in 1955. On 21 January of that year he delivered a lecture before the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast; later published as an article, &quot;The Military Revolution, 1560–1660,&quot; that has fueled debate in historical circles for five decades, in which the concept has been continually redefined and challenged. Though historians often challenge Roberts&#x27; theory, they usually agree with his basic proposal that European methods of warfare changed profoundly somewhere around or during the Early Modern Period.

==Chronology==
Roberts placed his military revolution around 1560–1660 as the period in which linear tactics were developed to take advantage of the increasingly effective gunpowder weapons; however, that chronology has been challenged by many scholars.

Ayton and Price have remarked on the importance of the &quot;Infantry Revolution&quot; taking place in the early 14th century, and David Eltis has pointed out that the real change to gunpowder weapons and the elaboration of a military doctrine according to that change took place in the early 16th century, not, as Roberts defended, in the late 16th century.

Others have defended a later period for the military change. Jeremy Black thinks that the key time period was that of 1660–1710, which saw an exponential growth in the size of European armies, while Clifford J. Rogers has developed the idea of successive military revolutions at different periods, first an &quot;infantry revolution&quot; in the 14th century, secondly an &quot;artillery revolution&quot; in the 15th century, thirdly a &quot;fortifications revolution&quot; in the 16th, fourth a &quot;fire weapons&quot; revolution between 1580 and 1630, and finally a fifth revolution, the increase in size of European armies, between 1650 and 1715. Similarly, Geoffrey Parker has extended the period of the military revolution from 1450 to 1800, the period in which Europeans achieved supremacy over the rest of the world. Some scholars have questioned the revolutionary character of an evolution through four centuries. Clifford Rogers has suggested that the military revolution can best be compared with the concept of &quot;punctuated equilibrium evolution&quot; (a theory originating in biology), meaning short bursts of rapid military innovation followed by longer periods of relative stagnation.

The military revolution failed in the Ottoman Empire. According to a 2013 study, there are two factors that explain this failure: &quot;civil-military relations and historical timing. In the Ottoman Empire, the emergence of an institutionally strong and internally cohesive army during the early stages of state formation—in the late fourteenth century—equipped the military with substantial bargaining powers. In contrast, the great powers of Europe drew heavily on private providers of military power during the military revolution and developed similar armies only by the second half of the seventeenth century, limiting the bargaining leverage of European militaries over their rulers. In essence, the Ottoman standing army was able to block reform efforts that it believed challenged its parochial interests.&quot;

==Tactics==

===Linear tactics===


Shallow formations are ideally suited for defensive deployments, but they are clumsy in offensive missions: the longer the frontage, the more difficult to maintain order and cohesion, or to perform any maneuver, especially wheeling. Gustavus Adolphus understood well that far from being slow and ponderous, the assault columns like those used by Tilly were in fact faster and more flexible, and the Swedish King made use of them when required, like in the battle of Alte Veste (see picture 3).

Armies did start to use thinner formations, but in a slow evolution, and subjected to tactical considerations. Firearms were not so effective as to determine solely the deployment of troops, other considerations were also observed, like units&#x27; experience, assigned mission, terrain, or the need to meet a required frontage with an understrength unit. The debate of line vs column was carried through the 18th Century up to Napoleonic times, with a temporary reverse to deep columns in the later campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars.

Ironically, depth reduction in cavalry formations was a more permanent change introduced by Gustavus Adolphus. In conjunction with less reliance on pistol fire it had the net effect of favouring shock action over firepower, contrary to the tendency defended by Roberts.

===Trace italienne===
Roberts&#x27; linear tactics concept had an early critic in the younger historian Geoffrey Parker, who asked why the supposedly outdated Spanish tercios defeated the Swedish linear formations at the battle of Nördlingen in 1634. Parker instead suggested that the key development was the appearance of the trace italienne fortifications in early modern Europe. In this view, the difficulty of taking such fortifications resulted in a profound change in military strategy. &quot;Wars became a series of protracted sieges&quot;, Parker suggests, and open-pitch battles became &quot;irrelevant&quot; in regions where the trace italienne existed. Ultimately, Parker argues, &quot;military geography&quot;, in other words the existence or absence of the trace italienne in a given area, shaped military strategy in the early modern period, and lead to the creation of larger armies necessary to besiege the new fortresses and to garrison them. In this way, Parker placed the birth of the Military Revolution in the early 16th century. He also gives it a new significance; not only was it a factor in the growth of the State, it was also the main factor (together with the &quot;Naval Revolution&quot;) in the rise of the West over other Civilizations.

This model has been criticised on several grounds. Jeremy Black pointed that it was the development of the State that allowed the growth in size of the armies, not the other way around, and found Parker guilty of &quot;Technological Determinism&quot;. More tellingly, the figures presented by Parker to sustain his idea about the growth of armies have been severely criticised by David Eltis as lacking consistency and David Parrott has proved that the period of the trace italienne did not show any significant growth in the size of French armies and that the late period of the Thirty Years War showed an increase in the proportion of cavalry in the armies, contrary to Parker&#x27;s thesis that the prevalence of siege warfare marked a decrease of its importance.

=== The infantry revolution and the decline of cavalry ===
Some Medieval specialists elaborated on the idea of an infantry revolution happening early in the 14th century, when in some relevant battles, like Courtrai (1302), Bannockburn (1314) or Halmyros (1311), heavy cavalry was routed by infantry; however, it can be pointed out that in all those battles infantry was entrenched or positioned in rough terrain unsuited for cavalry, like in other battles of the 14th and 15th century in which cavalry was defeated. In fact infantry had been victorious in earlier times in similar situations, for instance at the battle of Legnano in 1176, but in open ground infantry still had the worst, as shown for instance at the battle of Patay (1429) and the battle of Formigny (1450) in which the vaunted English longbowmen were easily run down; however, the experience of battles like Courtrai and Bannockburn meant that the myth of the invincible knight disappeared, which was in itself important for transforming medieval warfare.

More substance has the case for the &quot;return of Heavy Infantry&quot; as Carey has named it. Pikemen, unlike other infantry, could stand in the open against heavy cavalry. While requiring drill and discipline, individual training requirements were much lower than those for knights, and the switch from heavily armoured knight to footsoldier made possible the expansion in the size of armies from the late 15th century onwards as infantry could be trained more quickly and could be hired in great numbers. But that change was slow.

The full development, in the 15th century, of plate armour for both man and horse, combined with the use of the arret (lance rest) which could support a heavier lance, ensured that the heavy cavalryman remained a formidable warrior. Without cavalry, a 15th-century army was unlikely to achieve a decisive victory on the field of battle; battle might be decided by archers or pikemen, but a retreat could only be cut off effectively or followed-up by cavalry. In the 16th century, a lighter, less expensive cavalry gained ground, so that the proportion of cavalry in the armies actually grew continually, so that in the last battles of the Thirty Years War cavalry actually outnumbered infantry as never before since the high feudal period.

Another change that took place in the late 15th century was the improvement in siege artillery as to render old style fortifications very vulnerable. But the supremacy of tactical offence in siege warfare was not to last for very long. As Philippe Contamine has noted, by a dialectical process which may be found in all periods, progress in the art of siege was answered by progress in the art of fortification, and vice versa. Charles VIII&#x27;s invasion of Italy in 1494 demonstrated the potency of siege artillery; but in this region by the early years of the 16th century there were beginning to emerge fortifications which had been designed specifically to resist artillery bombardment. The full impact the 15th-century &quot;artillery revolution&quot; was blunted fairly quickly by the development of the bastion and the trace italienne. But the military supremacy which the possession of a powerful siege train conferred contributed in no small degree to that strengthening of royal authority which we find in some European states in the later 15th century.

==Size of armies==
The increase in army size and its influence on the development of Modern States is an important point in the military revolution theory. For example, Spain&#x27;s army increased from mere tens of thousands in the late 15th century to 300,000 regulars and 500,000 militia (paper strength) by 1625 spread all throughout Europe, according to Philip IV. However, exact estimates are hard to calculate for various reasons. There are several sources for the study of the size of armies in different periods.

===Administrative sources===

By their own nature they are the more objective sources available. Since Napoleonic Wars European Commanders had at their disposal periodical &quot;strength reports&quot; of their units. Those strength reports are the main source for research in conflicts in 19th and 20th centuries, however they are not without problems, different armies count effective strength in different ways, and in some instances reports are inflated by commanding officers to look good to their superiors.

Another source was &quot;muster calls&quot;, non-periodical strength reports of the personnel ready for duty. Muster calls are the main source for the strength of armies before the 19th century, but by their own nature they lack continuity and are ill-suited for long time period analysis. They are, however, the most reliable source for the period and do provide a general picture of army strengths and their variability.

Thirdly, &quot;pay rolls&quot; provide another set of information. They are especially useful to study army costs, but they are not so reliable as muster calls as they only show payments, not real soldiers ready for duty, and before the 19th century &quot;ghost soldiers&quot;, men falsely enlisted by officers in order to get the fees for themselves, were a very common occurrence.

Finally, &quot;Orders of Battle&quot;, lists of units without specifying strength, are very important for the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Before that period armies lacked the organization to deploy permanent units, so that orders of battle usually consist in an enumeration of leaders with commands. The exception for Ancient Times would be the Roman army, that from an early period developed a considerable military organization. An Order of Battle is not a reliable source for army strength, since units in campaign, or even in peace time periods, are rarely if ever at full authorized strength.

===Narrative sources===
Modern historians make use of the large amount of administrative sources available now, however things were very different in the past. Pre-modern writers too many times give numbers without naming sources, and there are few cases in which we can be sure they are actually using any administrative source. That is especially true when they speak about enemy armies, in which the access to administrative sources was in any case problematic. Besides that, there are a number of additional problems concerning pre-modern historians; they could be very biased in their reports, as inflating the number of enemies has been one of the favourite propagandistic resources of all times. Even when presenting a balanced account, many historians did not possess military experience, thus they lacked the technical judgement to properly assess and critique their sources. On the other hand, they had access to first hand accounts that could be very interesting, although in the subject of numbers were rarely accurate.

Historians consider pre-modern narrative sources to be highly unreliable on the subject of numbers, so that it is not possible to make use of them in a pair to administrative sources. Comparatives between modern and pre-modern periods are thus very difficult.

===Size of overall armies===
A clear differentiation should be established between Overall armies, i.e., the overall armed forces of a given political entity, and Field Armies, tactical units capable of moving as a single force along a campaign. The growth in size of overall armies has been considered by several scholars as a key issue of the Military Revolution. There are two main theses: it has been either considered a consequence of the economic and demographic growth of the 17th–18th century or the main cause for the growth of the administration and centralization of the Modern State in the same period.

However, some opponents of the general thesis have challenged those views, for instance I.A.A. Thompson has noted how the growth in size of the Spanish army in the 16th–17th centuries contributed rather to the economic collapse of Spain and to the weakness of the central government against regional rebellions while Simon Adams has put in question if there was any growth at all in the first half of the 17th century. The growth is however clear in the second half of the 17th century, when the States embrace the task of recruiting and arming themselves their armies, abandoning the system of commission, prevalent until the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The organization of a system of Local and Provincial Militias around this period in several countries (and the growing importance of Local Aristocracy, the so-called &quot;refeudalization of the armies&quot; especially in Eastern Europe) contributed to the extension of manpower base of the national armies, although foreign mercenaries still remained a considerable percentage in all European armies.

===Size of field armies===
This has been dictated through history by logistical constraints, mainly the supply of food. Before the mid-17th century, armies basically lived off the land. They didn&#x27;t have supply lines; they moved to the supply, and many times their movements were dictated by supply considerations. While some regions with good communications could supply large armies for longer periods, still they had to disperse when they moved from these well supplied areas. The maximum size of field armies remained under 50,000 for most of this period, and strength reports over this figure are always from unreliable narrative sources and must be regarded with scepticism. In the second half of the 17th things changed greatly. Armies began to be supplied through a net of depots linked by supply lines, that greatly increased the size of Field Armies. In the 18th century and early 19th century, before the advent of the railway, the size of Field Armies reached figures over 100,000.

==Conclusion==
The theory of a military revolution based upon technology has given way to models based more on a slow evolution in which technology plays a minor role to organization, command and control, logistics and in general non-material improvements. The revolutionary nature of these changes was only visible after a long evolution that handed Europe a predominant place in warfare, a place that the industrial revolution would confirm.

Some historians have begun to challenge the existence of a military revolution in the early modern period and have proposed alternative explanations. The most radical revisionist views of the theory consider it unable to explain the military developments of the Early Modern Period and the hegemonic rise of the West. The new wave of revisionist historians reject completely the idea of a military revolution and base their position on close analysis of the gradual and uneven transformation of tactical, operational, and technological aspects of European warfare over the course of the late Middle Ages and Early Modern period, as well as in their assessment of similar military experiences among non-Western countries, namely, Japan, Korea, the Mughal Empire, and the Ottoman Empire.

<text>Vince Richard Ditrich (born April 4, 1963) is a Canadian rock musician, best known as the drummer and manager of the band Spirit of the West. Ditrich is also the author of three novels featuring fictional musician Tony Vicar.

==Early life==
Ditrich grew up in Lethbridge, Alberta. He began playing drums as a child, and performed in his father&#x27;s local band as a teenager.

==Career==
Ditrich played drums with a variety of musicians, including pre-Odds bands with Doug Elliott and Steven Drake, Long John Baldry, and Paul Hyde. He went on tour in western Canada with Sue Medley in 1990, and also played with Mae Moore, Great Big Sea and Doug and the Slugs.

In late 1989, he joined Spirit of the West, and performed on their 1991 album &quot;Go Figure&quot;. He has been a member of that band ever since. In 2001 Ditrich became the band&#x27;s manager as well. He has also continued to record with other musicians as a session drummer, and released a solo album in 2002.

Spirit of the West frequently performed a rendition of &quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot; in concert, with Ditrich on lead vocals. Except for a live recording of that song on the band&#x27;s 1999 greatest hits compilation &quot;Hit Parade&quot;, however, Ditrich did not normally perform lead vocals on the band&#x27;s albums.

In 2005 Ditrich took on a management role for the bluegrass band House of Doc.

In 2010 Ditrich performed as part of the musical accompaniment for an original play, &quot;Debt the Musical&quot;, in British Columbia. In 2011 he produced part of Calum Hughes&#x27; album &quot;And That&#x27;s Okay With Me&quot; at the Vancouver studio The Warehouse.

Until its disbandment in 2016, Ditrich continued to be the manager for Spirit of the West. By this time he had been suffering from kidney failure for several years, and missed some of the final performances.

Ditrich lived in Vancouver until 1993, but after the birth of his first son, he moved to Vancouver Island and still lives there with his wife, Marion, and their two sons.

In August, 2021, Ditrich released his debut novel, &quot;The Liquor Vicar&quot;, the first of a three-part series published by Dundurn Press.

<text>The Aspen Music Festival and School (AMFS) is a classical music festival held annually in Aspen, Colorado.

It is noted both for its concert programming and the musical training it offers to mostly young-adult music students. Founded in 1949, the typical eight-week summer season includes more than 400 classical music events—including concerts by five orchestras, solo and chamber music performances, fully staged opera productions, master classes, lectures, and children&#x27;s programming—and brings in 70,000 audience members.

In the winter, the AMFS presents a small series of recitals and Metropolitan Opera Live in HD screenings.

As a training ground for young-adult classical musicians, the AMFS draws more than 650 students from 40 states and 34 countries, with an average age of 22. While in Aspen, students participate in lessons, coaching, and public performances in orchestras, operas, and chamber music, often playing side-by-side with AMFS artist-faculty.

The organization is currently led by President and CEO Alan Fletcher and Music Director Robert Spano.

==History==
The Aspen Music Festival and School was founded in 1949 by Chicago businessman Walter Paepcke and Elizabeth Paepcke as a two-week bicentennial celebration of the 18th-century German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The event, which included both intellectual forums and musical performances, was such a success that it led to the formation of both the Aspen Institute and the Aspen Music Festival and School.

In the summers that followed, the participating musicians returned, bringing their music students, and the foundation was set for the AMFS as it is known today. In 1950, Igor Stravinsky became the first conductor to present his own works with the Festival. The following year in 1951, the School enrolled its first official class, with 183 music students.

Early founding musicians included baritone Mack Harrell (father of cellist Lynn Harrell) and violinist Roman Totenberg (father of NPR legal correspondent Nina Totenberg). Early performance highlights include then-student James Levine conducting the Benjamin Britten opera &quot;Albert Herring&quot; in 1964, coinciding with Britten&#x27;s visit to Aspen that summer to accept an award from the Aspen Institute. In 1965, Duke Ellington and his orchestra came to the AMFS to perform a benefit concert. In 1971, Dorothy DeLay joined the AMFS strings artist-faculty and attracted more than 200 students each summer to her program. In 1975, Aaron Copland came to Aspen as a composer-in-residence on the occasion of his 75th birthday. In 1980, John Denver performed with the Aspen Festival Orchestra for his TV special &quot;Music and the Mountains&quot;, which aired the following year on ABC. Multiple artist-faculty members have also recorded albums while in Aspen, including the Emerson String Quartet, which recorded the &quot;Shostakovich: The String Quartets&quot; 5-disc set from AMFS venue Harris Concert Hall and won the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Classical Album.

==Facilities==

The Michael Klein Music Tent, which opened in 2000, is the Festival&#x27;s primary concert venue and seats 2050. The tent replaced an earlier tent designed by Herbert Bayer, which in 1965 replaced the original smaller tent designed by Eero Saarinen. Concerts are held in the Michael Klein Music Tent on a nearly daily basis during the summer, and seating on the lawn just outside the Tent, where many choose to picnic during events, is always free. The design has open sides; the curving roof is made of Teflon-coated fiberglass, a hard material also used by the Denver International Airport.

The 500-seat Joan and Irving Harris Concert Hall is located next door to the Michael Klein Music Tent, and was opened in 1993 at a cost of $7 million. The Wheeler Opera House—a Victorian-era venue owned by the City of Aspen—is the home to Aspen Opera Center productions in the summer and the AMFS&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera Live in HD screenings in the winter.

In 2016, the AMFS completed its $75 million, 105,000-square-foot Matthew and Carolyn Bucksbaum Campus, which serves as the center of its teaching activities. The campus, located two miles from downtown Aspen, sits on a 38-acre site that is shared between the AMFS in the summer and Aspen Country Day School during the academic year. Designed by architect Harry Teague, who also designed the AMFS&#x27;s Harris Concert Hall and the Michael Klein Music Tent, the Bucksbaum Campus includes three expansive rehearsal halls, numerous teaching studios and practice rooms, a percussion building, administrative offices, and a glass-enclosed cafeteria. The campus was designed with Aspen&#x27;s natural setting in mind: the buildings’ roof lines mirror the shapes of the surrounding mountains and hug the contours of the ponds and creek.

<text>In Christianity, a martyr is a person who was killed for their testimony for Jesus or faith in Jesus. In the years of the early church, stories depict this often occurring through death by sawing, stoning, crucifixion, burning at the stake, or other forms of torture and capital punishment. The word &quot;martyr&quot; comes from the Koine word μάρτυς, &quot;mártys&quot;, which means &quot;witness&quot; or &quot;testimony&quot;.

At first, the term applied to the Apostles. Once Christians started to undergo persecution, the term came to be applied to those who suffered hardships for their faith. Finally, it was restricted to those who had been killed for their faith. The early Christian period before Constantine I was the &quot;Age of Martyrs&quot;. &quot;Early Christians venerated martyrs as powerful intercessors, and their utterances were treasured as inspired by the Holy Spirit.&quot;

In western Christian art, martyrs are often shown holding a palm frond as an attribute, representing the victory of spirit over flesh, and it was widely believed that a picture of a palm on a tomb meant that a martyr was buried there.

==Etymology==
The use of the word () in non-biblical Greek was primarily in a legal context. It was used for a person who speaks from personal observation. The &quot;martyr&quot;, when used in a non-legal context, may also signify a proclamation that the speaker believes to be truthful. The term was used by Aristotle for observations, but also for ethical judgments and expressions of moral conviction that can not be empirically observed. There are several examples where Plato uses the term to signify &quot;witness to truth&quot;, including in Laws.

==Background==

The Greek word &quot;martyr&quot; signifies a &quot;witness&quot; who testifies to a fact he has knowledge about from personal observation. It is in this sense that the term first appears in the Book of Acts, in reference to the Apostles as &quot;witnesses&quot; of all that they had observed in the public life of Christ. In , Peter, in his address to the Apostles and disciples regarding the election of a successor to Judas, employs the term with this meaning: &quot;Wherefore, of these men who have accompanied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day he was taken up from us, one of these must be made a witness with us of his resurrection&quot;.

The Apostles, according to tradition, faced grave dangers until eventually almost all suffered death for their convictions. The Bible reports the martyrdom of two of the apostles. Thus, within the lifetime of the Apostles, the term &quot;martyrs&quot; came to be used in the sense of a witness who at any time might be called upon to deny what he testified to, under penalty of death. From this stage the transition was easy to the ordinary meaning of the term, as used ever since in Christian literature: a martyr, or witness of Christ, is a person who suffers death rather than deny his faith. Saint John, at the end of the first century, employs the word with this meaning.
A distinction between martyrs and confessors is traceable to the latter part of the second century: those only were martyrs who had suffered the extreme penalty, whereas the title of confessor was given to Christians who had shown their willingness to die for their belief, by bravely enduring imprisonment or torture, but were not put to death. Yet the term martyr was still sometimes applied during the third century to persons still living, as, for instance, by Cyprian who gave the title of martyrs to a number of bishops, priests, and laymen condemned to penal servitude in the mines.

==Origins==

Religious martyrdom is considered one of the more significant contributions of Second Temple Judaism to western civilization. It is believed that the concept of voluntary death for God developed out of the conflict between King Antiochus Epiphanes IV and the Jewish people. 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees recount numerous martyrdoms suffered by Jews resisting the Hellenizing of their Seleucid overlords, being executed for such crimes as observing the Sabbath, circumcising their children, or refusing to eat pork or meat sacrificed to foreign gods. With few exceptions, this assumption has lasted from the early Christian period to this day, accepted both by Jews and Christians.

According to Daniel Boyarin, there are &quot;two major theses with regard to the origins of Christian martyrology, which [can be referred to] as the Frend thesis and the Bowersock thesis&quot;. Boyarin characterizes W. H. C. Frend&#x27;s view of martyrdom as having originated in Judaism and Christian martyrdom as a continuation of that practice. Frend argues that the Christian concept of martyrdom can only be understood as springing from Jewish roots. Frend characterizes Judaism as &quot;a religion of martyrdom&quot; and that it was this &quot;Jewish psychology of martyrdom&quot; that inspired Christian martyrdom. Frend writes, &quot;In the first two centuries AD. there was a living pagan tradition of self-sacrifice for a cause, a preparedness if necessary to defy an unjust ruler, that existed alongside the developing Christian concept of martyrdom inherited from Judaism.&quot;

In contrast to Frend&#x27;s hypothesis, Boyarin describes G. W. Bowersock&#x27;s view of Christian martyrology as being completely unrelated to the Jewish practice, being instead &quot;a practice that grew up in an entirely Roman cultural environment and then was borrowed by Jews&quot;. Bowersock argues that the Christian tradition of martyrdom came from the urban culture of the Roman Empire, especially in Asia Minor:
Martyrdom was ... solidly anchored in the civic life of the Graeco-Roman world of the Roman empire. It ran its course in the great urban spaces of the agora and the amphitheater, the principal settings for public discourse and for public spectacle. It depended upon the urban rituals of the imperial cult and the interrogation protocols of local and provincial magistrates. The prisons and brothels of the cities gave further opportunities for the display of the martyr&#x27;s faith.
Boyarin points out that, despite their apparent opposition to each other, both of these arguments are based on the assumption that Judaism and Christianity were already two separate and distinct religions. He challenges that assumption and argues that &quot;making of martyrdom was at least in part, part and parcel of the process of the making of Judaism and Christianity as distinct entities&quot;.

==Jesus, King of Martyrs==
The Apostle Paul taught that Jesus was &quot;obedient unto death,&quot; a 1st century Jewish phrasing for self-sacrifice in Jewish law. Because of this, some scholars believe Jesus&#x27; death was Jewish martyrdom. Jesus himself said he had come to fulfill the Torah. The Catholic Church calls Jesus the &quot;King of Martyrs&quot; because, as a man, he refused to commit sin unto the point of shedding blood.

==Theology==

Tertullian, one of the 2nd-century ecclesiastical writers wrote that &quot;the blood of martyrs is the seed of the Church&quot;, implying that a martyr&#x27;s willing sacrifice of their lives leads to the conversion of others.

The Age of Martyrs also forced the church to confront theological issues such as the proper response to those Christians who &quot;lapsed&quot; and renounced the Christian faith to save their lives: were they to be allowed back into the Church? Some felt they should not, while others said they could. In the end, it was agreed to allow them in after a period of penance. The re-admittance of the &quot;lapsed&quot; became a defining moment in the Church because it allowed the sacrament of repentance and readmission to the Church despite issues of sin. This issue caused the Donatist and Novatianist schisms.

&quot;Martyrdom for the faith ... became a central feature in the Christian experience.&quot; &quot;Notions of persecution by the &#x27;world&#x27;, ... run deep in the Christian tradition. For evangelicals who read the New Testament as an inerrant history of the primitive church, the understanding that to be a Christian is to be persecuted is obvious, if not inescapable.&quot;

The &quot;eschatological ideology&quot; of martyrdom was based on an irony found in the Pauline epistles: &quot;to live outside of Christ is to die, and to die in Christ is to live.&quot;
In &quot;Ad Martyras&quot;, Tertullian writes that some Christians &quot;eagerly desired it&quot; (&quot;et ultro appetita&quot;) [i.e. martyrdom].

The martyr homilies were written in ancient Greek by authors such as Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, Asterius of Amasea, John Chrysostom, and Hesychius of Jerusalem. These homilies were part of the hagiographical tradition of saints and martyrs.

This experience, and the associated martyrs and apologists, would have significant historical and theological consequences for the developing faith.

Among other things, persecution sparked the devotion of the saints, facilitated the rapid growth and spread of Christianity, prompted defenses and explanations of Christianity (the &quot;apologies&quot;) and, in its aftermath, raised fundamental questions about the nature of the Church.

==The Early Church==
Stephen is the first martyr reported in the New Testament, accused of blasphemy and stoned by the Sanhedrin under the Levitical law. Toward the end of the 1st century, the martyrdom of both Peter and Paul is reported by Clement of Rome in 1 Clement. The martyrdom of Peter is also alluded to in various writings written between 70 and 130 AD, including in John 21:19; 1 Peter 5:1; and 2 Peter 1:12–15. The martyrdom of Paul is also alluded to in 2 Timothy 4:6–7. While not specifying his Christianity as involved in the cause of death, the Jewish historian Josephus reports that James, whom he referred to as a brother of Jesus, was stoned by Jewish authorities under the charge of law breaking, which is similar to the Christian perception of Stephen&#x27;s martyrdom as being a result of stoning for the penalty of law breaking. Furthermore, there is a report regarding the martyrdom of James son of Zebedee in Acts 12:1–2, and knowledge that both John and James, son of Zebedee, ended up martyred, appears to be reflected in Mark 10:39.

Judith Perkins has written that many ancient Christians believed that &quot;to be a Christian was to suffer,&quot;
partly inspired by the example of Jesus. The lives of the martyrs became a source of inspiration for some Christians, and their relics were honored. Numerous crypts and chapels in the Roman catacombs bear witness to the early veneration for those champions of freedom of conscience. Special commemoration services, at which the holy Sacrifice were offered over their tombs gave rise to the time honoured custom of consecrating altars by enclosing in them the relics of martyrs.

==The Roman Empire==

In its first three centuries, the Christian church endured periods of persecution at the hands of Roman authorities. Christians were persecuted by local authorities on an intermittent and ad hoc basis. In addition, there were several periods of empire-wide persecution which were directed from the seat of government in Rome.

Christians were the targets of persecution because they refused to worship the Roman gods or to pay homage to the emperor as divine. In the Roman Empire, refusing to sacrifice to the Emperor or the empire&#x27;s gods was tantamount to refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to one&#x27;s country. However, some scholars, such as Morton Smith, point out that other sects, such as the Jews and Samaritans, also refused to worship other gods, but were not generally persecuted. Smith points out that the early Christians (in the 100&#x27;s to the 200&#x27;s) were accused of practicing magic and other crimes associated with magic, and that magic has been commonly neglected in discussions of the persecutions. Jacob Burkhardt writes that the reason for the persecution of Christians under Diocletian around 300 may have been that after a period of growth and expansion Christians sought to gain control of the imperial office.

The cult of the saints was significant to the process of Christianization, but during the first centuries of the Church the celebrations venerating the saints took place in hiding. Michael Gaddis writes that &quot;[t]he Christian experience of violence during the pagan persecutions shaped the ideologies and practices that drove further religious conflicts over the course of the fourth and fifth centuries&quot;. Martyrdom was a formative experience and influenced how Christians justified or condemned the use of violence in later generations. Thus, the collective memory of religious suffering found in early Christian works on the historical experience of persecution, religious suffering and martyrdom shaped Christian culture and identity.

==The Middle Ages==

Historians recognize that during the Early Middle Ages, the Christian populations living in the lands invaded by the Arab Muslim armies between the 7th and 10th centuries AD suffered religious discrimination, religious persecution, religious violence, and martyrdom multiple times at the hands of Arab Muslim officials and rulers. As People of the Book, Christians under Muslim rule were subjected to &quot;dhimmi&quot; status (along with Jews, Samaritans, Gnostics, Mandeans, and Zoroastrians), which was inferior to the status of Muslims. Christians and other religious minorities thus faced religious discrimination and religious persecution, in that they were banned from proselytising (for Christians, it was forbidden to evangelize or spread Christianity) in the lands invaded by the Arab Muslims on pain of death; they were banned from bearing arms, undertaking certain professions, and were obligated to dress differently in order to distinguish themselves from Arabs. Under &quot;sharia&quot;, non-Muslims were obligated to pay &quot;jizya&quot; and &quot;kharaj&quot; taxes, together with periodic heavy ransom levied upon Christian communities by Muslim rulers in order to fund military campaigns, all of which contributed a significant proportion of income to the Islamic states while conversely reducing many Christians to poverty, and these financial and social hardships forced many Christians to convert to Islam. Christians unable to pay these taxes were forced to surrender their children to the Muslim rulers as payment who would sell them as slaves to Muslim households where they were forced to convert to Islam. Many Christian martyrs were executed under the Islamic death penalty for defending their Christian faith through dramatic acts of resistance such as refusing to convert to Islam, repudiation of the Islamic religion and subsequent reconversion to Christianity, and blasphemy toward Muslim beliefs.

In &quot;Dives and Pauper&quot;, a 15th-century Middle English moral treatise on the Ten Commandments, the figure Dives poses this question about the First Commandment: &quot;Why are there no martyrs these days, as there used to be?&quot; Pauper responds that the English were creating many new martyrs sparing &quot;neither their own king nor their own bishops, no dignity, no rank, no status, no degree&quot;. Pauper&#x27;s statement is based on historical events, including the murder of King Richard II and the executions of Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York. Dana Piroyansky uses the term &quot;political martyrs&quot; for men of &quot;high estate&quot;, including kings and bishops, who were killed during the Late Middle Ages during the course of the rebellions, civil wars, regime changes, and other political upheavals of the 14th and 15th centuries. Piroyansky notes that although these men were never formally canonized as saints, they were venerated as miracle-working martyrs and their tombs were turned into shrines following their violent and untimely deaths. J. C. Russell has written that the &quot;cults of political saints&quot; may have been a way of &quot;showing resistance to the king&quot; that would have been difficult to control or punish.

==Degrees of martyrdom==
Some Roman Catholic writers (such as Thomas Cahill) continue to use a system of degrees of martyrdom that was developed in early Christianity. Some of these degrees bestow the title of martyr on those who sacrifice large elements of their lives alongside those who sacrifice life itself. These degrees were mentioned by Pope Gregory I in &quot;Homilia in Evangelia&quot;; in it he wrote of &quot;three modes of martyrdom, designated by the colors, red, blue (or green), and white&quot;. A believer was bestowed the title of red martyr due to either torture or violent death by religious persecution. The term &quot;white martyrdom&quot; was used by the Church Father Jerome, &quot;for those such as desert hermits who aspired to the condition of martyrdom through strict asceticism&quot;. Blue (or green) martyrdom &quot;involves the denial of desires, as through fasting and penitent labors without necessarily implying a journey or complete withdrawal from life&quot;.

Also along these lines are the terms &quot;wet martyr&quot; (a person who has shed blood or been executed for the faith) and &quot;dry martyr&quot; (a person who &quot;had suffered every indignity and cruelty&quot; but not shed blood, nor suffered execution).

==Christian martyrs today==
The Center for the Study of Global Christianity of Gordon–Conwell Theological Seminary, an evangelical seminary based in Hamilton, Massachusetts, previously estimated that 100,000 Christians die annually for their faith, although the CSGC has now disavowed this estimate. Archbishop Silvano Maria Tomasi, permanent observer of the Holy See to the United Nations, later referred to this number in a radio address to the 23rd session of the Human Rights Council.

The methodology used in arriving at the estimate of 100,000 has been widely criticized. The majority of the one million people the Center counted as Christians who died as martyrs between 2000 and 2010 died during the Civil War in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the report did not take into consideration the political or ethnic differences which are accepted as the primary motive behind these killings. Todd Johnson, director of the CSGC, says his centre has abandoned this statistic. The Vatican reporter and author of &quot;The Global War on Christians&quot; John L. Allen Jr. said: &quot;I think it would be good to have reliable figures on this issue, but I don&#x27;t think it ultimately matters in terms of the point of my book, which is to break through the narrative that tends to dominate discussion in the West – that Christians can&#x27;t be persecuted because they belong to the world&#x27;s most powerful church. The truth is two-thirds of the 2.3 billion Christians in the world today live... in dangerous neighbourhoods. They are often poor. They often belong to ethnic, linguistic, and cultural minorities. And they are often at risk.&quot;

<doc id="1009030" wikidata="Q633885" url="?curid=1009030" title="Pathos">
<text>Pathos (, ; ; ) appeals to the emotions and ideals of the audience and elicits feelings that already reside in them. &quot;Pathos&quot; is a term most often used in rhetoric (in which it is considered one of the three modes of persuasion, alongside ethos and logos), as well as in literature, film and other narrative art.

==Methods==

Emotional appeal can be accomplished in many ways, such as the following:
* by a metaphor or storytelling, commonly known as a hook;
* by passion in the delivery of the speech or writing, as determined by the audience;
* by personal anecdote.

appealing to an ideal can also be handled in various ways, such as the following:
* by understanding the reason for their position
* avoiding attacks against a person or audience&#x27;s personality
* use the attributes of the ideal to reinforce the message.

Pathos tends to use &quot;loaded&quot; words that will get some sort of reaction. Examples could include &quot;victim&quot;, in a number of different contexts. In certain situations, pathos may be described as a &quot;guilt trip&quot; based on the speaker trying to make someone in the audience or the entire audience feel guilty about something. An example would be &quot;Well, you don&#x27;t &quot;have&quot; to visit me, but I just really miss you and haven&#x27;t seen you in so long.&quot;

==Philosophy==

In Stoicism, &quot;pathos&quot; refers to &quot;complaints of the soul&quot;. Succumbing to pathos is an internal event (i.e., in one&#x27;s soul) that consists in an erroneous response to impressions external to it. This view of pathos, and the accompanying view that all pathos is to be extirpated (in order to achieve the state of &quot;apatheia&quot;), are related by Stoics to a specific picture of the nature of the soul, of psychological functioning, and of human action. A key feature of that picture is that succumbing to pathos is an error of reason – an intellectual mistake.

Epicureanism interpreted and placed &quot;pathos&quot; in much more colloquial means and situations, placing it in pleasure, and studying it in almost every facet in regard to pleasure, analyzing emotional specificity that an individual may feel or may need to undergo to appreciate said pathos.

==Rhetoric==
===Aristotle’s text on pathos===
In &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, Aristotle identifies three artistic modes of persuasion, one of which is &quot;awakening emotion (pathos) in the audience so as to induce them to make the judgment desired.&quot; In the first chapter, he includes the way in which &quot;men change their opinion in regard to their judgment. As such, emotions have specific causes and effects&quot; (Book 2.1.2–3). Aristotle identifies pathos as one of the three essential modes of proof by his statement that &quot;to understand the emotions—that is, to name them and describe them, to know their causes and the way in which they are excited (1356a24–1356a25). Aristotle posits that, alongside pathos, the speaker must also deploy good ethos in order to establish credibility (Book 2.1.5–9).

Aristotle details what individual emotions are useful to a speaker (Book 2.2.27). In doing so, Aristotle focused on whom, toward whom, and why, stating that &quot;[i]t is not enough to know one or even two of these points; unless we know all three, we shall be unable to arouse anger in anyone. The same is true of the other emotions.&quot; He also arranges the emotions with one another so that they may counteract one another. For example, one would pair sadness with happiness (Book 2.1.9).

With this understanding, Aristotle argues for the rhetor to understand the entire situation of goals and audiences to decide which specific emotion the speaker would exhibit or call upon in order to persuade the audience. Aristotle&#x27;s theory of pathos has three main foci: the frame of mind the audience is in, the variation of emotion between people, and the influence the rhetor has on the emotions of the audience. Aristotle classifies the third of this trio as the ultimate goal of pathos. Similarly, Aristotle outlines the individual importance of persuasive emotions, as well as the combined effectiveness of these emotions on the audience. Antoine Braet did a re-examination of Aristotle&#x27;s text and in this he examined the speaker&#x27;s goal of the effect on the audience. Braet explains there are three perspectives of every emotion that a speaker is trying to arouse from the audience: the audience&#x27;s condition, who the audience is feeling these emotions for, and the motive. Moreover, Aristotle pointedly discusses pleasure and pain in relation to the reactions these two emotions cause in an audience member. According to Aristotle, emotions vary from person to person. Therefore, he stresses the importance of understanding specific social situations in order to successfully utilize pathos as a mode of persuasion.

Aristotle identifies the introduction and the conclusion as the two most important places for an emotional appeal in any persuasive argument.

===Alternative views on pathos===
Scholars have discussed the different interpretations of Aristotle&#x27;s views of rhetoric and his philosophy. Some believe that Aristotle may not have even been the inventor of his famous persuasion methods. In the second chapter of &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, Aristotle&#x27;s view on pathos changes from the use in discourse to the understanding of emotions and their effects. William Fortenbaugh pointed out that for the Sophist Gorgias, &quot;Being overcome with emotion is analogous to rape.&quot; Aristotle opposed this view and created a systematic approach to pathos. Fortenbaugh argues that Aristotle&#x27;s systematic approach to emotional appeals &quot;depends upon correctly understanding the nature of individual emotions, upon knowing the conditions favorable to, the objects of, and the grounds for individual emotions&quot;.
Modern philosophers were typically more skeptical of the use of emotions in communication, with political theorists such as John Locke hoping to extract emotion from reasoned communication entirely. George Campbell presents another view unlike the common systematic approach of Aristotle. Campbell explored whether appeals to emotion or passions would be &quot;an unfair method of persuasion,&quot; identifying seven circumstances to judge emotions: probability, plausibility, importance, proximity in time, connection of place, relations to the persons concerned, and interest in the consequences.

The 84 BC &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot; book of an unknown author theorizes that the conclusion is the most important place in a persuasive argument to consider emotions such as mercy or hatred, depending on the nature of the persuasion. The &quot;appeal to pity&quot;, as it is classified in &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot;, is a means to conclude by reiterating the major premise of the work and tying while incorporating an emotional sentiment. The author suggests ways in which to appeal to the pity of the audience: &quot;We shall stir pity in our hearers by recalling vicissitudes of future; by comparing the prosperity we once enjoyed with our present adversity; by entreating those whose pity we seek to win, and by submitting ourselves to their mercy.&quot; Additionally, the text impresses the importance of invoking kindness, humanity and sympathy upon the hearer. Finally, the author suggests that the appeal to pity be brief for &quot;nothing dries more quickly than a tear.&quot;

===Pathos before Aristotle===

The concept of emotional appeal existed in rhetoric long before Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot;. George A. Kennedy, a well-respected, modern-day scholar, identifies the appeal to emotions in the newly formed democratic court system before 400 BC in his book, &quot;The Art of Persuasion in Greece&quot;. Gorgias, a Sophist who preceded Aristotle, was interested in the orator&#x27;s emotional appeal as well. Gorgias believed the orator was able to capture and lead the audience in any direction they pleased through the use of emotional appeal. In the &quot;Encomium of Helen&quot;, Gorgias states that a soul can feel a particular sentiment on account of words such as sorrow and pity. Certain words act as &quot;bringers-on of pleasure and takers-off of pain. Furthermore, Gorgias equates emotional persuasion to the sensation of being overtaken by a drug: &quot;[f]or just as different drug draw off different humors from the body, and some put an end to disease and other to life, so too of discourses: some give pain, others delight, others terrify, others rouse the hearers to courage, and yet others by a certain vile persuasion drug and trick to soul.&quot;

Plato also discussed emotional appeal in rhetoric. Plato preceded Aristotle and therefore laid the groundwork, as did other Sophists, for Aristotle to theorize the concept of pathos. In his dialogue &quot;Gorgias&quot;, Plato discusses pleasure versus pain in the realm of pathos though in a (probably fictional) conversation between Gorgias and Socrates. The dialogue between several ancient rhetors that Plato created centers around the value of rhetoric, and the men incorporate aspects of pathos in their responses. Gorgias discredits pathos and instead promotes the use of ethos in persuasion. In another of Plato&#x27;s texts, &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, his discussion of emotions is more pointed; however, he still does not outline exactly how emotions manipulate an audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bedford/ St. Martin&#x27;s&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Plato discusses the danger of emotions in oratory. He argues that emotional appeal in rhetoric should be used as the means to an end and not the point of the discussion.

===Contemporary pathos===
George Campbell, a contributor to the Scottish Enlightenment, was one of the first rhetoricians to incorporate scientific evidence into his theory of emotional appeal. Campbell relied heavily on a book written by physician David Hartley, entitled &quot;Observations on Man&quot;. The book synthesized emotions and neurology and introduced the concept that action is a result of impression. Hartley determined that emotions drive people to react to appeals based on circumstance but also passions made up of cognitive impulses. Campbell argues that belief and persuasion depend heavily on the force of an emotional appeal. Furthermore, Campbell introduced the importance of the audience&#x27;s imagination and will on emotional persuasion that is just as important as basic understanding of an argument. Campbell, by drawing on the theories of rhetoricians before him, drew up a contemporary view of pathos that incorporates the psychological aspect of emotional appeal.

==== Pathos in politics ====
Pathos has its hand in politics as well, primarily in speech and how to persuade the audience. Mshvenieradze states that &quot;Pathos is directly linked with an audience. Audience is a collective subject of speakers on which an orator tries to impact by own argumentation.&quot; Similarly, to how Aristotle discusses how to effectively utilize pathos in rhetoric, the way in which one appeals to the reader is similar in appealing to an audience of voters. In the case of politics and politicians, it is primarily more argumentative writing and speaking. In Book II of Aristotle&#x27;s writings in &quot;Rhetoric,&quot; in essence knowing people&#x27;s emotions helps to enable one to act with words versus writing alone, to earn another&#x27;s credibility and faith.

As Aristotle&#x27;s teachings expanded, many other groups of thinkers would go on to adopt different variations of political usage with the elements of pathos involved, which includes groups such as the Epicureans and Stoics.

==== Pathos in advertising ====
The contemporary landscape for advertising is highly competitive due to the sheer amount of marketing done by companies. Pathos has become a popular tool to draw consumers in as it targets their emotional side. Studies show that emotion influences people&#x27;s information processing and decision-making, making pathos a perfect tool for persuading consumers to buy goods and services. In this digital age, &quot;designers must go beyond aesthetics and industrial feasibility to integrate the aspect of &#x27;emotional awareness&#x27;&quot;. Companies today contain current culture references in their advertisement and oftentimes strive to make the audience feel involved. In other words, it is not enough to have a pleasant looking advertisement; corporations may have to use additional design methods to persuade and gain consumers to buy their products. For example, this type of advertising is exemplified in large food brands such as Presidents Choice&#x27;s &quot;Eat Together&quot; campaign (2017), and Coca-Cola&#x27;s &quot;Open-happiness&quot; campaign (2009). One of the most well-known examples of pathos in advertising is the SPCA commercials with pictures of stray dogs with sad music.

==== Pathos in research ====
Pathos can also be also used in credited medical journals, research and other academic pieces of writing. The goal is to appeal to the readers&#x27; emotion while maintaining the necessary requirements of the medical discourse community. Authors may do so, by using certain vocabulary to elicit an emotional response from the audience. “God-terms” are often used as a rhetorical technique. It is imperative that authors still preserve the standard of writing within the medical community by focusing on factual and scientific information without use of personal opinion.

==== Pathos in art ====
It can be argued that most artwork falls under the realm of pathos. Throughout history artists have used pathos within their work by utilizing colors, shape, and texture of the artwork to draw out feelings within their audience. Political cartoons are but one example of artists using pathos to persuade or bring to light issues within the world centering around the government. Most times, the designs are blown out of proportion and are greatly exaggerated, but this adds to the raw feeling the artist tries to evoke within the viewer.

<text>The King&#x27;s School, Macclesfield, is an all through co-educational private day school in Prestbury, Cheshire, England, and a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference. It was founded in 1502 by Sir John Percyvale, a former Lord Mayor of London, as Macclesfield Grammar School.

==History==
The King&#x27;s School was founded in 1502 within the Church of St Michael and All Angels, Macclesfield. It was re-founded by Edward VI in 1552 as the &quot;Free Grammar School of King Edward VI&quot;. It moved to Cumberland Street, 300 metres further from the town square, in 1844. In July 2020 the school moved to a new location adjacent to its long-held Derby Playing Fields, on the outskirts of Macclesfield.

In 1844 a Modern School, with a more commercial and technical curriculum, was built by the governors to run in tandem with the Grammar School. It merged with the Grammar School in 1912.

The school operated as a direct-grant school and offered scholarships for boys from state elementary schools from 1926 until 1966, when its application to continue as a direct grant grammar school was refused and it became fully independent.

The boys&#x27; junior school was opened in 1947. In 1993 girls from age 11 to 16 were admitted and housed with co-educational juniors, and later infants, at the old Macclesfield High School site on Fence Avenue. The Sixth Form had been co-educational since 1986.

The King&#x27;s School&#x27;s 2020 development plans involved closing the two existing school sites in Macclesfield and opening a new single site school in Prestbury, near Macclesfield. The development plans involved selling off the two existing school sites for housing development to fund the new school site. The school acquired greenbelt farmland adjacent to its Derby Fields site for which it subsequently sought planning permission in order to develop the existing school site and the farmland for housing. Planning permission was granted to the school to build more than 250 houses on the greenbelt land in Macclesfield in July 2016. The new school was built on green belt land in nearby Prestbury. Planning permission for all sites was confirmed when the Secretary of State declined to call in the plans for further scrutiny in September 2016.
In July 2020 King&#x27;s School left Macclesfield after more than 500 years of continuous operation in the town and relocated to Prestbury. In 2024, after 500 years of teaching Latin, King’s school controversially withdrew Latin from its curriculum. This led to parents making a formal complaint to an independent body regarding this decision and the lack of transparent decision making by the school’s governing body.

==Academia==
The school follows the National Curriculum for GCSE in Years 10–11 and A-Levels in the sixth form. In 2012, pupils achieved A*/A in 41% of all exams and A* – B in three-quarters of exams. Pupils achieved the best-ever GCSE results in 2012 with 33% of grades at A* grade, more than 63% of grades at A*/A and 86% at A* – B grade.

In 2011, pupils achieved 75% A* to B grade at A-level, with a 99.7% pass rate, and 60% As and A*s at GCSE.

In 2023, pupils achieved at GCSE level 43% of all grades at 9/8 (A*) , 65% grades 9-7, 83% 9-6. For A-Levels, 48% of all grades were A*/A , 80% of all grades were A*-B, with 7 students getting 3 A*s. 

==Extra-curricular activities==

===Music===
In 2003 the school&#x27;s Foundation Choir won BBC &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; Choir of the Year. It takes bi-annual trips to perform across Europe, having visited Barcelona, Levico Terme, Strasbourg, Lake Geneva and Budapest. In 2016 the choir performed in Prague. The choir and numerous bands also perform at nearby St Michael&#x27;s Church. The school&#x27;s music department is equipped with a recording studio and practice rooms and offers instrumental lessons to the students.
The department also performs musicals such as &quot;The Revenge of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a West End musical, in 2012. 

===Drama===
The school performs two to three plays a year; one by the Boys&#x27; Division/Sixth Form, one by the Girls&#x27; Division, and one by the Juniors. Recent plays include &quot;Cinders&quot;, &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, and &quot;The Ramayana&quot;. Now that the school is completely co-educational, there are performances in Infants, Junior divisions respectively and the Seniors and Sixth Form perform together. In 2023, they performed &quot;Bleak Expectations.&quot; In 2024, they performed &quot;Guys and Dolls.&quot; 

===School trips===
Trips abroad are arranged by individual departments, including those by the History and Classics departments, in addition to annual foreign language exchange visits. Pupils are involved in biennial World Challenge Expeditions and recent expeditions have been to Morocco, Ecuador, India and most recently Namibia. 

The school&#x27;s Outdoor Activities Club organises regular trips to Yorkshire or the Peak District, that include walking, climbing and caving. 

In 2023, the school undertook a 3-week expedition to Borneo. 

===Sports===
School sports include rugby, hockey, netball, cheerleading, and cricket.

<text>Fight Club is a 1999 American film directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter. It is based on the 1996 novel &quot;Fight Club&quot; by Chuck Palahniuk. Norton plays the unnamed narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a &quot;fight club&quot; with a soap salesman, Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled with an impoverished but beguiling woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).

Palahniuk&#x27;s novel was optioned by Fox 2000 Pictures producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. It was filmed in and around Los Angeles from July to December 1998. He and the cast compared the film to &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), with a theme of conflict between Generation X and the value system of advertising.

Studio executives did not like the film and restructured Fincher&#x27;s intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. &quot;Fight Club&quot; premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival on September 10, 1999, and was released in the United States on
October 15, 1999, by 20th Century Fox. The film failed to meet the studio&#x27;s expectations at the box office and received polarized reactions from critics. It was ranked as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the 1990s. However, &quot;Fight Club&quot; later found commercial success with its home video release, establishing it as a cult classic and causing media to revisit the film. In 2009, on its tenth anniversary, &quot;The New York Times&quot; dubbed it the &quot;defining cult movie of our time.&quot;

== Plot ==

The unnamed Narrator, who struggles with insomnia and dissatisfaction with his job and lifestyle, finds temporary solace in support groups. As his insomnia worsens, he discovers that expressions of emotional vulnerability help him sleep, leading him to join multiple groups for people facing emotionally distressing problems, despite his expressions being fraudulent. His efforts are thwarted when Marla Singer, another impostor, joins the same groups. The Narrator cannot present his fabricated struggles as genuine, or divert his attention from her presence as an impostor, causing his sleeplessness to return. He arranges for them to attend different sessions to regain his ability to sleep and, under certain circumstances, to exchange contact information, to which she reluctantly agrees.

On a return flight from work, the Narrator meets a soap salesman, Tyler Durden. After an explosion destroys the Narrator&#x27;s apartment, he moves into Tyler&#x27;s decrepit house. They become friends and start an underground fight club in a bar basement. Tyler also saves Marla from an overdose, initiating a sexual relationship between them, while the Narrator remains cold to her.

The Narrator quits his job, blackmails his boss for funds, and grows the fight club, attracting new members, including his cancer support group friend, Bob. Tyler morphs the club into Project Mayhem, committing vandalism to disrupt the social order. Feeling sidelined, the Narrator confronts Tyler, who admits to orchestrating the explosion in the Narrator&#x27;s apartment and then goes missing. Bob is killed by the police during a mission, prompting the Narrator to attempt to stop the project and look for Tyler. Discovering the project&#x27;s nationwide reach and being called Tyler Durden by Marla and other people, he realizes he and Tyler are split personalities.

Learning that Project Mayhem plans to erase debt records by blowing up the headquarters of credit-card companies, the Narrator unsuccessfully warns Marla and goes to the police, some of whom are also Project Mayhem members. He attempts to disarm the explosives, but Tyler attacks him. The Narrator shoots himself in the mouth, killing Tyler. Marla arrives and she and the Narrator hold hands as they watch the targeted buildings collapse.

== Themes ==
Fincher said &quot;Fight Club&quot; was a coming of age film, like the 1967 film &quot;The Graduate&quot; but for people in their 30s. Fincher described the narrator as an &quot;everyman&quot;; the character is identified in the script as &quot;Jack&quot;, but left unnamed in the film. Fincher outlined the Narrator&#x27;s background, &quot;He&#x27;s tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming the thing he isn&#x27;t.&quot; He cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must &quot;kill&quot; his parents, god, and teacher. By the start of the film, he has &quot;killed off&quot; his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden.

The character is a 1990s inverse of the &quot;Graduate&quot; archetype: &quot;a guy who does &quot;not&quot; have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has &quot;no&quot; possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life.&quot; He is confused and angry, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean &quot;Übermensch&quot;, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life &quot;that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications&quot;. Fincher explained, &quot;[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: you&#x27;re not really necessary to a lot of what&#x27;s going on. It&#x27;s built, it just needs to run now.&quot; While studio executives worried that &quot;Fight Club&quot; was going to be &quot;sinister and seditious&quot;, Fincher sought to make it &quot;funny and seditious&quot; by including humor to temper the sinister element.

Screenwriter Jim Uhls described the film as a romantic comedy, explaining, &quot;It has to do with the characters&#x27; attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which &quot;seems&quot; unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them—because both characters are out on the edge psychologically.&quot; The Narrator seeks intimacy, but avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her. While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler. The Narrator is comfortable being personally connected to Tyler, but becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually involved with Marla. When the Narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the philosophy they have been exploring. When Tyler implies that Marla is a risk they should remove, the Narrator realizes he should have focused on her and begins to diverge from Tyler&#x27;s path.
The Narrator, an unreliable narrator, is not immediately aware that he is mentally projecting Tyler. He also mistakenly promotes the fight clubs as a way to feel powerful, though the Narrator&#x27;s physical condition worsens while Tyler Durden&#x27;s appearance improves. While Tyler desires &quot;real experiences&quot; of actual fights like the Narrator at first, he manifests a nihilistic attitude of rejecting and destroying institutions and value systems. His impulsive nature, representing the id, is seductive and liberating to the Narrator and the members of Project Mayhem. Tyler&#x27;s initiatives and methods become dehumanizing; he orders around the members of Project Mayhem with a megaphone similar to camp directors at Chinese re-education camps. The Narrator pulls back from Tyler and arrives at a middle ground between his conflicting selves.

&quot;Fight Club&quot; examines Generation X angst as &quot;the middle children of history&quot;. Norton said it examines the value conflicts of Generation X as the first generation raised on television: this generation had &quot;its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture&quot;, and was told one could achieve &quot;spiritual happiness through home furnishing&quot;. His character walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator&#x27;s immersion, &quot;It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness.&quot; Pitt said, &quot;&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so for the first time we can experience the pain.&quot;

&quot;Fight Club&quot; also parallels the 1955 film &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;; both probe the frustrations of the people in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to &quot;a generation of spectators&quot;. A culture of advertising defines society&#x27;s &quot;external signifiers of happiness&quot;, causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references consumer products such as Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, &quot;We smash it ... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us.&quot; Pitt explained the dissonance, &quot;I think there&#x27;s a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We&#x27;re rooting for ball teams, but we&#x27;re not getting in there to play. We&#x27;re so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that&#x27;s going to sum you up at the end.&quot;

The violence of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify combat, but for participants to experience feeling in a society where they are otherwise numb. The fights represent a resistance to the impulse to be &quot;cocooned&quot; in society. Norton believed the fighting strips away the &quot;fear of pain&quot; and &quot;the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth&quot;, leaving them to experience something valuable. When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden&#x27;s ideas. &quot;Fight Club&quot; purposely shapes an ambiguous message whose interpretation is left to the audience. Fincher said, &quot;I love this idea that you can have fascism without offering any direction or solution. Isn&#x27;t the point of fascism to say, &#x27;This is the way we should be going&#x27;? But this movie couldn&#x27;t be further from offering &quot;any&quot; kind of solution.&quot;

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The novel &quot;Fight Club&quot; by Chuck Palahniuk was published in 1996. Before its publication, a Fox Searchlight Pictures book scout sent a galley proof of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script&#x27;s length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000 Pictures, who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to &quot;Fight Club&quot; from Palahniuk for $10,000.

Ziskin initially considered hiring Buck Henry to write the adaptation, finding &quot;Fight Club&quot; similar to the 1967 film &quot;The Graduate&quot;, which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered Peter Jackson the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film &quot;The Frighteners&quot; in New Zealand. Bryan Singer received the book but did not read it. Danny Boyle met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. The book was also sent to David O. Russell, but he couldn&#x27;t understand it. David Fincher, who had read &quot;Fight Club&quot; and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film &quot;Alien 3&quot; for Fox. To repair his relationship with Fox, he met with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic. In August 1997, Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of &quot;Fight Club&quot;.

=== Casting ===
Producer Ross Bell met with actor Russell Crowe to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe. Pitt was looking for a new film after the domestic failure of his 1998 film &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;, and the studio believed &quot;Fight Club&quot; would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt for US$17.5 million.

For the role of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a &quot;sexier marquee name&quot; such as Matt Damon to increase the film&#x27;s commercial prospects; it also considered Sean Penn. Fincher instead considered Norton based on his performance in the 1996 film &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;. Other studios were approaching Norton for leading roles in developing films like &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; and &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;. He was cast in &quot;Runaway Jury&quot;, but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton $2.5 million for &quot;Fight Club&quot;. He could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed Paramount Pictures a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio&#x27;s future films for a smaller salary. Norton later satisfied the obligation with his role in the 2003 film &quot;The Italian Job&quot;.

In January 1998, 20th Century Fox announced that Pitt and Norton had been cast. The actors prepared by taking lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling, and soapmaking. Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth. The pieces were restored after filming concluded.

Fincher&#x27;s first choice for the role of Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo. While Fincher initially stated that she turned it down because she objected to the film&#x27;s sexual content, in an interview in 2020, Garofalo revealed that she did accept the role, but was dropped because Norton believed she was poorly suited to it. Fincher pitched the role to Julia Louis-Dreyfus. The filmmakers considered Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates. Love claimed that she was cast as Marla Singer, but was fired after she rejected Pitt&#x27;s pitch for a film about her late husband, Kurt Cobain. The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher felt she was too young. Sarah Michelle Gellar turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot;. Finally, Fincher chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot;.

=== Writing ===
When Uhls first encountered the novel, it was in the form of a manuscript, though it already had a publisher. In his interview he stated that he read it just for enjoyment and was blown away by it. He started working on a draft of the adapted screenplay, which excluded a voice-over because the industry perceived the technique as &quot;hackneyed and trite&quot; at the time. When Fincher joined the film, he thought that the film should have a voice-over, believing that the film&#x27;s humor came from the Narrator&#x27;s voice. He described the film without a voice-over as seemingly &quot;sad and pathetic&quot;. Fincher and Uhls revised the script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that reordered the story and left out several major elements. When Pitt was cast, he was concerned that his character, Tyler Durden, was too one-dimensional. Fincher sought the advice of writer-director Cameron Crowe, who suggested giving the character more ambiguity. Fincher also hired screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker for assistance. He invited Pitt and Norton to help revise the script, and the group drafted five revisions in the course of a year.

Palahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel and applauded how the film&#x27;s plot was more streamlined than the book&#x27;s. Palahniuk recalled how the writers debated if film audiences would believe the plot twist from the novel. Fincher supported including the twist, arguing, &quot;If they accept everything up to this point, they&#x27;ll accept the plot twist. If they&#x27;re still in the theater, they&#x27;ll stay with it.&quot; Palahniuk&#x27;s novel also contained homoerotic overtones, which Fincher included in the film to make audiences uncomfortable and accentuate the surprise of the twists. The bathroom scene where Tyler Durden bathes next to the Narrator is an example of the overtones; the line, &quot;I&#x27;m wondering if another woman is really the answer we need,&quot; was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality. Another example is the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the Narrator&#x27;s mouth.

The Narrator finds redemption at the end of the film by rejecting Tyler Durden&#x27;s dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel&#x27;s ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution. Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in &quot;The Graduate&quot;, indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self. Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him, &quot;I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing.&quot;

=== Filming ===
Studio executives Mechanic and Ziskin planned an initial budget of $23 million to finance the film, but by the start of production, the budget was increased to $50 million. Half was paid by New Regency, but during filming, the projected budget escalated to $67 million. New Regency&#x27;s head and &quot;Fight Club&quot; executive producer Arnon Milchan petitioned Fincher to reduce costs by at least $5 million. Fincher refused, so Milchan threatened Mechanic that New Regency would withdraw financing. Mechanic sought to restore Milchan&#x27;s support by sending him tapes of dailies from &quot;Fight Club&quot;. After seeing three weeks of filming, Milchan reinstated New Regency&#x27;s financial backing. The final production budget was $63–65 million.

The fight scenes were heavily choreographed, but the actors were required to &quot;go full out&quot; to capture realistic effects such as having the wind knocked out of them. Makeup artist Julie Pearce, who had worked for Fincher on the 1997 film &quot;The Game&quot;, studied mixed martial arts and pay-per-view boxing to portray the fighters accurately. She designed an extra&#x27;s ear to have cartilage missing, inspired by the boxing match in which Mike Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield&#x27;s ear. Makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat on cue: spraying mineral water over a coat of Vaseline, and using the unadulterated water for &quot;wet sweat&quot;. Meat Loaf, who plays a fight club member who has &quot;bitch tits&quot;, wore a 90-pound (40 kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts. He also wore eight-inch (20 cm) lifts in his scenes with Norton to be taller than him.

Filming lasted 138 days from July to December 1998, during which Fincher shot more than 1,500 rolls of film, three times the average for a Hollywood film. The locations were in and around Los Angeles and on sets built at the studio in Century City. Production designer Alex McDowell constructed more than 70 sets. The exterior of Tyler Durden&#x27;s house was built in Wilmington, California, while the interior was built on a sound stage at the studio&#x27;s location. The interior was given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the characters. Marla Singer&#x27;s apartment was based on photographs of apartments in downtown LA. Overall, production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and complex special effects. Fincher compared &quot;Fight Club&quot; to his subsequent, less complex film &quot;Panic Room&quot;, &quot;I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on.&quot;

=== Cinematography ===
Fincher used the Super 35 format to film &quot;Fight Club&quot; since it gave him maximum flexibility to compose shots. He hired Jeff Cronenweth as cinematographer; Cronenweth&#x27;s father Jordan Cronenweth had been cinematographer for Fincher&#x27;s 1992 film &quot;Alien 3,&quot; but left midway through production due to Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;, and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for &quot;Fight Club&quot;.

Fincher and Cronenweth applied a lurid style, choosing to make people &quot;sort of shiny&quot;. The appearance of the Narrator&#x27;s scenes without Tyler were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as &quot;more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense—a visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into&quot;. The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction. Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a &quot;smack-fiend patina&quot;. Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.

The crew took advantage of both natural and practical light. Fincher sought various approaches to the lighting setups; for example, he chose several urban locations for the city lights&#x27; effects on the shots&#x27; backgrounds. The crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters&#x27; injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters&#x27; eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis&#x27; technique as the influence.

&quot;Fight Club&quot; was filmed mostly at night, and Fincher filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar&#x27;s basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.

The scenes with Tyler were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. Tyler was not filmed in two shots with a group of people, nor was he shown in any over-the-shoulder shots in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler&#x27;s presence in single frames for subliminal effect. Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a &quot;little devil on the shoulder&quot;. Fincher explained the subliminal frames, &quot;Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the Narrator&#x27;s consciousness.&quot;

While Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak film stock normally on &quot;Fight Club&quot;, several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. Flashing was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the contrast was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be underexposed, Technicolor&#x27;s ENR silver retention was used on a select number of prints to increase the density of the blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a &quot;stepped-on&quot; look on the print with a dirty patina.

=== Visual effects ===
Fincher hired visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug, who worked for him on &quot;The Game&quot;, to create visual effects for &quot;Fight Club&quot;. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, &quot;We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility&#x27;s weakness.&quot; Fincher visualized the Narrator&#x27;s perspective through a &quot;mind&#x27;s eye&quot; view and structured a myopic framework for the film audiences. Fincher also used previsualized footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.

The film&#x27;s title sequence is a 90-second visual effects composition that depicts the inside of the Narrator&#x27;s brain at a microscopic level; the camera pulls back to the outside, starting at his fear center and following the thought processes initiated by his fear impulse. The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was budgeted separately from the rest of the film at first, but the sequence was awarded by the studio in January 1999. Fincher hired Digital Domain and its visual effects supervisor Kevin Mack, who won an Academy Award for Visual Effects for the 1998 film &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;, for the sequence. The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an L-system, and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included neurons, action potentials, and a hair follicle. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, &quot;While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like electron microscope photography, that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive—wet, scary, and with a low depth of field.&quot; The shallow depth of field was accomplished with the ray tracing process.

Other visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem&#x27;s destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100 photographs of Los Angeles and Century City by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen months.

Midway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the cue mark—nicknamed &quot;cigarette burn&quot; in the film—to the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the &quot;fairly subjective reality&quot; that existed earlier in the film. Fincher explained, &quot;Suddenly it&#x27;s as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way.&quot;

=== Score ===
Fincher was concerned that bands experienced in writing film scores would be unable to tie the themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film. He pursued Radiohead, but the singer, Thom Yorke, declined as he was recovering from the stress of promoting their 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Fincher instead commissioned the breakbeat producing duo Dust Brothers, who created a post-modern score encompassing drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples. Dust Brothers performer Michael Simpson explained the setup, &quot;Fincher wanted to break new ground with everything about the movie, and a nontraditional score helped achieve that.&quot; The climax and end credits feature the song &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot; by Pixies.

== Release ==
=== Marketing ===
Filming concluded in December 1998, and Fincher edited the footage in early 1999 to prepare &quot;Fight Club&quot; for a screening with senior executives. They did not receive the film positively and were concerned that there would not be an audience for the film. Executive producer Art Linson, who supported the film, recalled the response, &quot;So many incidences of &quot;Fight Club&quot; were alarming, no group of executives could narrow them down.&quot; Nevertheless, &quot;Fight Club&quot; was originally slated to be released in July 1999, but was later changed to August 6, 1999. The studio further delayed the film&#x27;s release, this time to autumn, citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production process. Outsiders attributed the delays to the Columbine High School massacre earlier in the year.

Marketing executives at Fox Searchlight Pictures faced difficulties in marketing &quot;Fight Club&quot; and at one point considered marketing it as an art film. They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title &quot;Fight Club&quot; embossed on it as the film&#x27;s main marketing image; the proposal was considered &quot;a bad joke&quot; by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake public service announcements presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20 million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film&#x27;s fight scenes. The studio advertised &quot;Fight Club&quot; on cable during World Wrestling Federation broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film. Linson believed that the &quot;ill-conceived one-dimensional&quot; marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed to &quot;Fight Club&quot;″s lukewarm box office performance in the United States.

=== Theatrical run ===
The studio held &quot;Fight Club&quot;″s world premiere at the 56th Venice International Film Festival on September 10, 1999. For the American theatrical release, the studio hired the National Research Group to test screen the film; the group predicted the film would gross between and in its opening weekend. &quot;Fight Club&quot; opened commercially in the United States and Canada on October 15, 1999, and earned in 1,963 theaters over the opening weekend. The film ranked first at the weekend box office, beating &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; and &quot;The Story of Us&quot;, a fellow weekend opener. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale. The gender mix of audiences for &quot;Fight Club&quot;, argued to be &quot;the ultimate anti-date flick&quot;, was 61% male and 39% female; 58% of audiences were below the age of 21. Despite the film&#x27;s top placement, its opening gross fell short of the studio&#x27;s expectations. Over the second weekend, &quot;Fight Club&quot; dropped 42.6% in revenue, earning . In its original theatrical run, the film grossed in the United States and Canada, and in other territories, for a worldwide total of . (With subsequent re-releases, the film&#x27;s worldwide gross increased to .) The underwhelming North American performance of &quot;Fight Club&quot; soured the relationship between 20th Century Fox&#x27;s studio head Bill Mechanic and media executive Rupert Murdoch, which contributed to Mechanic&#x27;s resignation in June 2000.

The British Board of Film Classification reviewed &quot;Fight Club&quot; for its November 12, 1999 release in the United Kingdom and removed two scenes involving &quot;an indulgence in the excitement of beating a (defenseless) man&#x27;s face into a pulp&quot;. The board assigned the film an 18 certificate, limiting the release to adult-only audiences in the UK. The BBFC did not censor any further, considering and dismissing claims that &quot;Fight Club&quot; contained &quot;dangerously instructive information&quot; and could &quot;encourage anti-social (behavior)&quot;. The board decided, &quot;The film as a whole is—quite clearly—critical and sharply parodic of the amateur fascism which in part it portrays. Its central theme of male machismo (and the anti-social behaviour that flows from it) is emphatically rejected by the central character in the concluding reels.&quot; The scenes were restored in a two-disc DVD edition released in the UK in March 2007. In February 2024, in advance of a theatrical re-release, the BBFC lowered the classification from 18 to 15.

=== Home media ===
Fincher supervised the composition of the DVD packaging and was one of the first directors to participate in a film&#x27;s transition to home media. The film was released on DVD on June 6, 2000, in both one and two-disc editions. The movie disc included four commentary tracks, while the bonus disc contained behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, theater safety PSAs, the promotional music video &quot;This is Your Life&quot;, Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, storyboards, and publicity materials. Fincher worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox&#x27;s senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented Fincher&#x27;s vision, &quot;The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more you look at it, the more you&#x27;ll get out of it.&quot; The studio developed the packaging for two months. The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper. The title &quot;Fight Club&quot; was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, &quot;We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what&#x27;s inside.&quot; Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox&#x27;s vice president of marketing, described the design, &quot;From a retail standpoint, [the DVD case] has incredible shelf-presence.&quot; It was the first DVD release to feature the THX Optimode.

&quot;Fight Club&quot; won the 2000 Online Film Critics Society Awards for Best DVD, Best DVD Commentary, and Best DVD Special Features. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the film&#x27;s two-disc edition in first place on its 2001 list of &quot;The 50 Essential DVDs&quot;, giving top ratings to the DVD&#x27;s content and technical picture-and-audio quality. When the two-disc edition went out of print, the studio re-released it in 2004 because of fans&#x27; requests. The film sold more than 6 million copies on DVD and video within the first ten years, making it one of the largest-selling home media items in the studio&#x27;s history, in addition to grossing over $55 million in video and DVD rentals. With a weak box office performance in the United States and Canada, a better performance in other territories, and the highly successful DVD release, &quot;Fight Club&quot; generated a US$10 million profit for the studio.

The Laserdisc edition was only released in Japan on May 26, 2000 and features a different cover art, as well as one of the very few Dolby Digital Surround EX soundtracks released on LD. The VHS edition was released on October 31, 2000, as a part of 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;Premiere Series&quot; line. It includes a featurette after the film, &quot;Behind the Brawl&quot;.

&quot;Fight Club&quot; was released on Blu-ray in the United States on November 17, 2009. Five graffiti artists were commissioned to create 30 pieces of art for the packaging, encompassing urban aesthetics found on the East Coast and West Coast of the United States as well as influences from European street art. The Blu-ray edition opens with a menu screen for the romantic comedy &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; starring Drew Barrymore before leading into the &quot;Fight Club&quot; menu screen. Fincher got permission from Barrymore to include the fake menu screen.

An online release in China from Tencent censored the bomb blasts at the end and replaced the ending with a message that Project Mayhem was thwarted, with Tyler Durden being arrested by law enforcement and placed in an insane asylum until 2012, adapting the ending of the original &quot;Fight Club&quot; novel. Weeks later, Tencent released a version of the film restoring 11 of the 12 minutes that had previously been cut. The novel&#x27;s author Chuck Palahniuk believed the censored version partially restored the book&#x27;s ending.

In October 2024, Fincher confirmed he would oversee a 4K remaster of the film.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Cineaste&quot;″s Gary Crowdus summarized the critical reception at the time, &quot;Many critics praised &quot;Fight Club&quot;, hailing it as one of the most exciting, original, and thought-provoking films of the year.&quot; He wrote of the negative opinion, &quot;While &quot;Fight Club&quot; had numerous critical champions, the film&#x27;s critical attackers were far more vocal, a negative chorus which became hysterical about what they felt to be the excessively graphic scenes of fisticuffs ... They felt such scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality, a morally irresponsible portrayal, which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real-life fight clubs in order to beat each other senseless.&quot; When &quot;Fight Club&quot; premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival, the film was fiercely debated by critics. A newspaper reported, &quot;Many loved and hated it in equal measures.&quot; Some critics expressed concern that the film would incite copycat behavior, such as that seen after &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; debuted in Britain nearly three decades previously. Upon the film&#x27;s theatrical release, &quot;The Times&quot; reported the reaction, &quot;It touched a nerve in the male psyche that was debated in newspapers across the world.&quot; Although the film&#x27;s makers called &quot;Fight Club&quot; &quot;an accurate portrayal of men in the 1990s,&quot; some critics called it &quot;irresponsible and appalling.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Australian&quot;, Christopher Goodwin stated, &quot;&quot;Fight Club&quot; is shaping up to be the most contentious mainstream Hollywood meditation on violence since Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.&quot;

Janet Maslin, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised Fincher&#x27;s direction and editing of the film. She wrote that &quot;Fight Club&quot; carried a message of &quot;contemporary manhood&quot;, and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism. Roger Ebert, reviewing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave &quot;Fight Club&quot; two stars out of four, calling it &quot;visceral and hard-edged&quot;, but also &quot;a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy&quot;, whose promising first act is followed by a second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as &quot;trickery&quot;. Ebert later acknowledged that the film was &quot;beloved by most, not by me&quot;. He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis of &quot;Fight Club&quot; at the Conference on World Affairs; he stated that &quot;[s]eeing it over the course of a week, I admired its skill even more, and its thought even less.&quot; Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; opined that the film began with an &quot;invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz&quot;, but that it eventually became &quot;explosively silly&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s David Ansen described &quot;Fight Club&quot; as &quot;an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload&quot; and thought that the ending was too pretentious. Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; described the mise en scène as dark and damp: &quot;It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters&#x27; aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it&#x27;s polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it&#x27;s carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it&#x27;s better to be wet than dry.&quot; Schickel applauded the performances of Pitt and Norton, but criticized the &quot;conventionally gimmicky&quot; unfolding and the failure to make Bonham Carter&#x27;s character interesting.

The film review website Metacritic surveyed and assessed 24 reviews as positive, 10 as mixed, and 2 as negative. It gave an aggregate score of 67 out of 100, which it said indicated &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. The similar website Rotten Tomatoes surveyed and, categorizing the reviews as positive or negative, assessed 149 as positive and 36 as negative. Of the , it determined an average rating of 7.4 out of 10. It gave the film a score of 81% and summarized the critical consensus, &quot;Solid acting, amazing direction, and elaborate production design make &quot;Fight Club&quot; a wild ride.&quot;

==Accolades==
&quot;Fight Club&quot; was nominated for the 2000 Academy Award for Best Sound Editing, but it lost to &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Bonham Carter won the 2000 Empire Award for Best British Actress. The Online Film Critics Society also nominated &quot;Fight Club&quot; for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor (Norton), Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay (Uhls). Though the film won none of the awards, the organization listed &quot;Fight Club&quot; as one of the top ten films of 1999. The soundtrack was nominated for a BRIT Award, losing to &quot;Notting Hill&quot;.

== Legacy and cultural impact ==

&quot;Fight Club&quot; was one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the 1990s. The film was perceived as the forerunner of a new mood in American political life. Like other 1999 films &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, and &quot;Three Kings&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot; was recognized as an innovator in cinematic form and style, since it exploited new developments in filmmaking technology. After &quot;Fight Club&quot;″s theatrical release, it became more popular via word of mouth, and the positive reception of the DVD established it as a cult film that David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; conjectured would enjoy &quot;perennial&quot; fame. The film&#x27;s success also heightened Palahniuk&#x27;s profile to global renown.

Following &quot;Fight Club&quot;″s release, several fight clubs were reported to have started in the United States. A &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Fight Club&quot; was started in Menlo Park, California, in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry. Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers. An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus. The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002. Helder&#x27;s goal was to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in &quot;Fight Club&quot; in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior. On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop on the Upper East Side. The New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate &quot;Project Mayhem&quot;.

&quot;Fight Club&quot; had a significant impact on evangelical Christianity, in the areas of Christian discipleship and masculinity. A number of churches called their cell groups &quot;fight clubs&quot; with a stated purpose of meeting regularly to &quot;beat up the flesh and believe the gospel of grace&quot;. Some churches, especially Mars Hill Church in Seattle, whose pastor Mark Driscoll was obsessed with the film, picked up the film&#x27;s emphasis on masculinity, and rejection of self-care. Jessica Johnson suggests that Driscoll even called on &quot;his brothers-in-arms to foment a movement not unlike Project Mayhem.&quot;

A &quot;Fight Club&quot; video game was released by Vivendi Universal Games in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and for mobile phones. The game was a critical and commercial failure, and was panned by such publications and websites as GameSpot, &quot;Game Informer&quot;, and IGN. The video game &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot;, initially released in 2000 for Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast console, was inspired by the film&#x27;s anti-establishment themes.

In 2003, &quot;Fight Club&quot; was listed as one of the &quot;50 Best Guy Movies of All Time&quot; by &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot;. In 2004 and 2006, &quot;Fight Club&quot; was voted by &quot;Empire&quot; readers as the eighth and tenth greatest film of all time, respectively. &quot;Total Film&quot; ranked &quot;Fight Club&quot; as &quot;The Greatest Film of our Lifetime&quot; in 2007 during the magazine&#x27;s tenth anniversary. In 2007, &quot;Premiere&quot; selected Tyler Durden&#x27;s line, &quot;The first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club,&quot; as the 27th greatest movie line of all time. In 2008, readers of &quot;Empire&quot; ranked Tyler Durden eighth on a list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters. &quot;Empire&quot; also identified &quot;Fight Club&quot; as the 10th greatest movie of all time in its 2008 issue &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;.

In 2010, two viral mash-up videos featuring &quot;Fight Club&quot; were released. &quot;Ferris Club&quot; was a mash-up of &quot;Fight Club&quot; and the 1986 film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. It portrayed Ferris as Tyler Durden and Cameron as the narrator, &quot;claiming to see the real psychological truth behind the John Hughes classic&quot;. The second video, &quot;Jane Austen&#x27;s Fight Club&quot;, also gained popularity online as a mash-up of &quot;Fight Club&quot;″s fighting rules and the characters created by 19th-century novelist Jane Austen.

<text>Daniel Edward Lapp is a Canadian folk musician based in Victoria, British Columbia and Pender Island.

==Early life==
Lapp was born and grew up in Prince George, British Columbia. His mother, Charlotte Lapp, was a pianist. He learned to play the violin from his grandfather, beginning at age nine. He studied trumpet with Lou Ranger at the University of Victoria, and attended Humber College in Toronto in 1985. His old time musical environment included five uncles who played fiddle and numerous accordion playing aunts, which was a natural place for immersion into this musical genre.

==Educator==

Lapp became a fiddle teacher, and in 1994, he formed the B.C. Fiddle Orchestra, which showcased a dozen young fiddlers from around British Columbia and a full backup band. The ensemble&#x27;s debut was in front of about 60,000 people at the Commonwealth Games in Victoria. The group continued to perform in British Columbia, and by 2013 had released an album. In 2014 Daniel was appointed as the inaugural Artistic Director of the Victoria Conservatory of Music’s Chwyl Family School of Contemporary Music, where he now under the umbrella of the Victoria Conservatory of Music, continues to direct the B.C. Fiddle Orchestra, the “Joy of Life” Choir, and “Folkestra”, teaches fiddle and trumpet privately, and is Artistic Director of the Contemporary Music component to the Victoria Conservatory of Music’s Postsecondary Diploma in Music Performance.

Beginning in 1990, with the assistance of a grant from the Canada Council on the Arts, Daniel Lapp travelled throughout British Columbia and collected over 1,000 fiddle tunes. According to Lapp, these tunes were heavily influenced by music from the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, and famous Canadian fiddlers such as Don Messer, Al Cherny, Ned Landry, Frankie Rodgers, Ward Allen, Graham Townsend, and fiddlers from the Canadian Prairies such as King Ganam and Andy DeJarlis.

==Performance career==

Lapp was a touring member of the folk rock band Spirit of the West in 1988 and 1989, but never appeared on any of the band&#x27;s albums. Lapp and Linda McRae replaced Hugh McMillan during MacMillan&#x27;s hiatus from the band following the 1988 album &quot;Labour Day&quot;. Lapp left when MacMillan returned before the band&#x27;s next album. He has also toured with Barney Bentall, Mae Moore and Rickie Lee Jones.

As a fiddler, jazz trumpeter and singer/songwriter, Daniel Lapp has played on over 100 albums and performed across Canada, the United States, Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, Finland and Germany with many renowned Folk and Jazz musicians. Daniel is the winner of the B.C. Fiddle Championship and has appeared as a soloist with the CBC Chamber Orchestra as well as the Prince George, Victoria, and Vancouver Symphonies.

In 2010, Daniel Lapp performed as part of &quot;Rhythms of the Fall,&quot; a segment that was performed for a live audience of more than 60,000 in B.C. Place Stadium for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games opening ceremonies in Vancouver, as well as the millions watching on television internationally. He, along with Canadian fiddlers Ashley MacIsaac (Cape Breton), April Verch (Ontario), Samantha Robichaud (New Brunswick), Andre Brunet (Quebec), and Sierra Noble (Manitoba) represented different Canadian regions on stage to perform the fiddle style of their region. They were joined by Alberta fiddler Calvin Vollrath, who composed most of the tunes for this twelve minute set and played with the orchestra.

Lapp has since released a number of albums featuring an experimental brand of folk fused with jazz and electronic influences. He continued to give lessons privately, as well as holding international festival workshops. He later founded the &quot;House of Music&quot; in Victoria, B.C..

His trio with English accordionist Martin Green and Canadian guitarist Adam Dobres has become a regular performer at Glasgow&#x27;s Celtic Connections Festival and Cape Breton&#x27;s Celtic Colours. He played on John Wort Hannam&#x27;s 2015 album &quot;Love Lives On&quot;, played with Susannah Adams at the Hornby Island Music Festival in 2017, and in 2018 performed with 54-40 both locally and at Ottawa&#x27;s CityFolk Festival.

In 2012, Daniel Lapp received the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee &quot;Service&quot; Award. In 2013, he was the recipient of the Canadian Folk Music Association &quot;Innovator&quot; Award for his contribution to Canada&#x27;s fiddle culture. Besides teaching, this includes a 25 year commitment to collecting indigenous B.C, fiddle tunes, which includes over 1000 compositions by over 100 BC composers.

In 2019, the Canadian Grand Masters Fiddling Association honoured Daniel Lapp with the Lifetime Achievement Award when the competition was held in Abbotsford, British Columbia. Lapp received this award for the creation of the B.C. Fiddle Tune Archive, as well as his accomplishments in education, performance and recording.

<text>The Black Volta or Mouhoun (French: &quot;Volta noire&quot;) is a river that flows through Burkina Faso for approximately 1,352 km (840 mi) to the White Volta in Dagbon, Ghana, the upper end of Lake Volta. It is one of the three main parts of the Volta, with the White Volta and the Red Volta.

The source of the Black Volta is in the Cascades Region of Burkina Faso, close to Mount Tenakourou, the highest point of the country. Further downstream it forms part of the border between Ghana and Burkina Faso, and later between Ivory Coast and Ghana. Within Ghana, it marks the border between the Savannah and Bono regions. The Bui Dam, a hydroelectric power plant, is built on the river, just south of the Bui National Park, which the river bisects.

<text>The Malta national football team () represents Malta in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Malta Football Association, the governing body for football in Malta. 

The first official game played by Malta was a 3–2 defeat in a friendly against Austria in 1957. Their competitive debut arrived five years later, playing against Denmark in the preliminary round of the 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup. Since becoming a UEFA member in 1960 and a FIFA member in 1959, Malta have competed in every qualifier for the European Championship and FIFA World Cup, but have never made it to the finals of any major international competition.

== History ==

Malta played its first international game on 24 February 1957 at the Empire Stadium, losing 2–3 to Austria. That match was played in front of a capacity crowd at the old Empire Stadium. The Malta Football Association joined FIFA in 1959 and UEFA a year later. In late 1959, Malta played in the 1960 Summer Olympics African Qualifiers against Morocco and Tunisia, in which they finished last in the group with two draws and two losses. Since then, Malta has largely remained as one of Europe&#x27;s weakest teams, though its fortunes have increased since late 2010s.

The Maltese international side first competed in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA European Nations Cup in 1962, and in FIFA World Cup qualification in 1971. Malta&#x27;s first competitive draw ended 1–1 against Greece in 1970. Malta&#x27;s first two competitive wins were victories of 2–0 and 2–1 at home to Greece and Iceland in European Championship qualifiers in 1975 and 1982 respectively. In 1979, Malta drew 0–0 with West Germany in a European championship qualifier and they met again on 16 December 1984 for a memorable World Cup Qualifier in front of a record attendance at the Ta&#x27;Qali stadium, where the 1982 &amp; eventual 1986 World Cup runners-up only managed a 2–3 win. Another prestigious result was achieved in March 1987 when Malta drew 2–2 in Portugal, in a qualifier for Euro&#x27;88 and the side also twice drew against Hungary during the qualification for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, and recorded four friendly wins during 1991 and 1992.

Malta&#x27;s third competitive win came with a 1–0 victory away to Estonia in a 1993 World Cup qualifier in which Kris Laferla scored.
In October 1994 Malta held Czech Republic 0–0 in a qualifier for the UEFA Euro 1996, in which the latter ended runners-up. Six years later, in October 2000, in a group qualifying match for the 2002 World Cup, once again Malta managed another 0–0 draw vs Czech Republic which eventually cost the latter a place at the following major tournament. In June 2000, Malta played England, then managed by Kevin Keegan. Trailing 2–1 going into the final minutes, Malta were awarded a penalty, however David Carabott&#x27;s effort was saved by Richard Wright. Through November 2001 and May 2002, Malta played and remained undefeated in 6 international matches and in between they won the locally hosted (Rothmans) International Tournament. During 2005, Malta drew 1–1 against Croatia and Bulgaria. Another positive result was the 1–1 home draw in a friendly match against Northern Ireland, though George Mallia missed an injury time penalty which would have given them a win. On 11 October 2006, Malta managed another competitive victory, a 2–1 triumph over Hungary in the European Championship qualifying with André Schembri scoring twice.

On 7 February 2007, Malta drew 1–1 with one of the hosts of Euro 2008, Austria. The game was played to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first international match played by the Maltese national team. On 8 September 2007, Malta managed another draw against Turkey in a Euro 2008 qualifying match, the game finishing 2–2. On 26 March 2008, Malta achieved its largest ever victory, a 7–1 defeat of Liechtenstein in a friendly at the Ta&#x27; Qali Stadium, with Michael Mifsud scoring five goals. A 2–0 friendly win over Georgia followed in 2009.

In May 2010, sponsorship of the Maltese national side was taken on by sportswear firm Givova, who also designed a range of new kits for the team. One month later, however, the side had fallen to their lowest ever FIFA world ranking position, of 169th in the world. In 2009, Malta had a 0–0 draw with Albania at home. This was their only point for the 2010 World Cup qualifying. On 11 August 2010, Malta drew 1–1 at home against FYR Macedonia in a friendly game, with Michael Mifsud scoring a brilliant diving header for Malta.

In February 2011, the national football team of Malta achieved a 0–0 draw against Switzerland, in which goalkeeper Justin Haber saved two penalties. On 6 September 2011, Malta won their first Euro 2012 qualifying point, with a 1–1 draw against Georgia. During the years of 2010 and 2011, Malta did not get many positive results, and coach John Buttigieg and assistant coach Carmel Busittil were both sacked in October 2011. For the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, Malta won their first World Cup qualifying match in 20 years, nabbing a 1–0 win over Armenia in June 2013. In June 2017, Malta defeated Ukraine 1–0 in a friendly match, thanks to a lone goal by defender Zach Muscat. Malta recorded their 7th all-time competitive win (and their first in the UEFA Nations League) on 13 October 2020, defeating Latvia 1–0 in Riga, scoring the winning goal in the 97th minute.

<text>The Alliance World Fellowship (or The Alliance, also C&amp;MA and CMA) is an evangelical Christian denomination It includes 6.2 million members throughout 88 countries within 22,000 churches.

==History==
The Alliance has its origins in two organizations founded by Albert Benjamin Simpson in 1887 in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, in the United States, The Christian Alliance, which concentrated on domestic missions, and The Evangelical Missionary Alliance, which focused on overseas missions. These two organizations merged in 1897 to form the Christian and Missionary Alliance.

In 1887, in a series of sermons called The &quot;Fourfold Gospel&quot; in New York, United States, which will characterize his teaching, Simpson summarizes the Gospel in four aspects; Jesus Christ Savior, Sanctifier, Healer and Soon Coming King.

The &quot;Missionary Training Institute&quot; (later including Alliance Theological Seminary), founded in 1882 by Simpson in Nyack, near New York, contributed to the development of the union. In the 21st century, the school moved again to New York City and changed its name to Alliance University. After losing its accreditation, Alliance University ceased operations in 2023, with its records transferred to Houghton College.

A.B. Simpson was influenced by Keswickian cleric W.E. Boardman in his view of sanctification. During the start of the 20th century, Simpson became closely involved with the growing Pentecostal movement. It became common for Pentecostal pastors and missionaries to receive their training at the Missionary Training Institute that Simpson founded. Consequently, Simpson and the Alliance had a great influence on Pentecostalism, in particular the Assemblies of God and the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. This influence included evangelical emphasis, Alliance doctrine, Simpson&#x27;s hymns and books, and the use of the term &#x27;Gospel Tabernacle,&#x27; which led to many Pentecostal churches being known as &#x27;Full Gospel Tabernacles.&#x27;

Eventually, there developed severe division within the Alliance over issues surrounding Pentecostalism (such as speaking in tongues and charismatic worship styles). By 1912, this crisis was a catalyst for the emergence of the Alliance as an organized Christian denomination, shifting more authority to the council and becoming more ecclesiastical. To ensure the survival of the Alliance in the face of division, Simpson put all property in the name of the Alliance. In the event of separation, all property would revert to Alliance.

After Simpson&#x27;s death in 1919, the C&amp;MA distanced itself from Pentecostalism, rejecting the premise that speaking in tongues is a necessary indicator of being filled with the Holy Spirit, and instead focused on the deeper Christian life. By 1930, most local branches of the Alliance functioned as churches, but still did not view themselves as such.

By 1965, the churches adopted a denominational function and established a formal statement of faith. In 1975, the Alliance World Fellowship (AWF) was officially organized. In 2010, it was present in 50 countries.

==Statistics==
According to a census published by the association in 2022, it has 22,000 churches, 6,200,000 members in 88 countries.

==Beliefs==
The denomination has an evangelical theology, and is largely aligned with the Higher Life movement. A.B. Simpson articulated the Alliance&#x27;s core theology as the Christological &quot;Fourfold Gospel&quot;: Jesus Christ as Savior, Sanctifier, Healer, and Soon Coming King. These are represented by a cross, laver, oil pitcher, and crown in the Alliance&#x27;s logo. Sanctification is sometimes described as &quot;the deeper Christian life&quot;. This teaching is that of other churches aligned with the Higher Life movement and its Keswick Conventions. It is perhaps best exemplified by the writings of A. W. Tozer. Simpson, however, departed from traditional Keswickian teaching in his view of progressive sanctification and his rejection of suppressionism. The Alliance also emphasizes missionary work, and believes that the fulfillment of the Great Commission is the reason it exists.

Espousing a modified form of Keswickian theology, the Christian and Missionary Alliance, as with Simpson, differs from the Wesleyan-Holiness movement in that the Christian and Missionary Alliance does not see entire sanctification as cleansing one from original sin, whereas adherents of the Wesleyan-Holiness movement affirm this Methodistic teaching of John Wesley.

==Ministries==

===CAMA Services===
Associated with the denomination is CAMA Services. &quot;CAMA&quot; stands for &quot;Compassion and Mercy Associates&quot;. Services include a variety of relief and development efforts providing food, clothing, medical care, and job training to people in crisis situations around the globe in the name of Jesus.

Begun in 1974 by Andy Bishop as an outreach to refugees fleeing the Indochina conflict, CAMA now works in refugee camps in Thailand, and has worked with refugees in Hong Kong, Lebanon, Jordan, and Guinea, and famine victims in Burkina Faso and Mali. CAMA Services worked together with local C&amp;MA churches in 2005 to provide Hurricane Katrina relief in the United States.

==Seminaries and colleges==

It had 90 theological colleges.

==Controversies==
In the 1980s, alumni of Mamou Alliance Academy in Guinea, West Africa, began to write letters to C&amp;MA headquarters informing leadership of systemic child abuse that occurred at the school. Phone calls and letter writing of this nature to the C&amp;MA continued for ten years.

The alumni reported that the C&amp;MA response was evasive, deceptive, and employed &quot;stonewalling&quot; tactics. Alumni were reportedly told that they should forgive, and that they would &quot;hurt the name of Jesus&quot; by coming forward. One alumnus said that &quot;the only way that we could get the Alliance to do anything was through the media. It was only through shaming them by putting the truth out there&quot;. Robert Fetherlin, vice president for International Ministries for the C&amp;MA, said &quot;We heard as far back as the 1980s that there were some questionable events that took place at Mamou. That there may have been mistreatment of children, however, we were slower than we should have been in responding to that.&quot;

In 1995, 30 alumni from Mamou approached the C&amp;MA for an investigation and restitution. They reported systemic abuse including psychological abuse, excessive beating, sadistic dental practices performed without novocaine, sexual molestation, and rape. The following year an independent commission of inquiry (ICI) was formed and 80 testimonies were heard. In April 1998 the ICI released a report which found the denomination negligent in monitoring Mamou and in training teachers. The report identified nine offenders, of whom four were retired, three deceased and two no longer with the C&amp;MA.

The US C&amp;MA Board of Directors issued an open letter to the victims of abuse asking for &quot;forgiveness for the pain and trauma that you suffered while under the care of C&amp;MA dorm parents, teachers and missionaries.&quot;

Since these abuses occurred, the Alliance changed its policies and practices. Fetherlin said that the Alliance tried &quot;to keep families together as much as possible, as opposed to asking parents to commit to sending their elementary children off to &#x27;missionary kid&#x27; boarding schools&quot;, and supported homeschooling, which they had previously opposed.

The Alliance also established a Sensitive Issues Consultative Group made up of professional counselors and caregivers as part of its response to the commission&#x27;s recommendations. A publication on child safety and protection entitled Safe Place was produced, a child safety and protection policy for its international work introduced, and a revised Uniform Discipline, Restoration and Appeal policy implemented that mandates denomination-wide zero-tolerance when there is a finding of sexual abuse of a child or vulnerable adult. A child protection training program which every overseas Alliance worker is required to attend was set up. Child Protection and Safety policies were published on the Alliance Web site.

<doc id="1009067" wikidata="Q4678608" url="?curid=1009067" title="Adam (murder victim)">
<text>&quot;Adam&quot; was the name police gave to an unidentified male child whose torso was discovered in the River Thames in London, United Kingdom, on 21 September 2001. Investigators believe the child was likely from southwestern Nigeria, and that several days before his murder, he was trafficked to the United Kingdom for a muti ritual sacrifice. To date, nobody has been charged with Adam&#x27;s murder, and his true identity remains unknown.

==Background==
On 21 September 2001, the torso of a young boy was discovered in the River Thames, near Tower Bridge in central London. Dubbed &quot;Adam&quot; by police officers, the unidentified remains belonged to a black male, around four to eight years old, who had been wearing orange girls&#x27; shorts.

The post-mortem showed that Adam had been poisoned, his throat had been slit to drain the blood from his body, and his head and limbs had been expertly removed. Further forensic testing examined his stomach contents and trace minerals in his bones to establish that Adam had only been in the United Kingdom for a few days or weeks before he was murdered, and that he likely came from a region of southwestern Nigeria near Benin City known as the birthplace of voodoo. This evidence led investigators to suspect that Adam was trafficked to Britain specifically for a muti killing, a ritual sacrifice performed by a witch doctor that uses a child&#x27;s body parts to make medicinal potions called &quot;muti&quot;.

==Investigation==
Unable to find a match for Adam in databases of missing children in Britain and Europe, investigators made requests to the public for assistance. However, the story initially only received moderate publicity, due its proximity to the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. In the UK, coverage and interest in the case increased over the next year, and rewards were offered for information leading to the killers&#x27; conviction, or to Adam&#x27;s identification. However, the story had not yet received much publicity in Nigeria.

When the investigation had reached an impasse in 2002, London officials flew to Johannesburg, South Africa, where Nelson Mandela, Nobel Prize winner and former President of South Africa, made a public appeal requesting any information that might be relevant to help the police in London identify Adam. Mandela&#x27;s appeal was broadcast all over Africa and translated into many languages, including Yoruba, the local language in the region that investigators linked to Adam.

In 2003, London Metropolitan police travelled to South Africa to consult detectives and muti experts of the SAPS. The experts suggested that the orange shorts meant Adam was related to his killers. In Muti rituals, the colour red is the colour of resurrection: accordingly at least one of Adam&#x27;s killers was related to him, and was trying to apologise to his soul, praying that he might rise again.

The police subsequently travelled to Nigeria and launched a campaign to track Adam&#x27;s parents. Despite visiting elementary schools and looking at reported missing children in the region, there was no success.

===Developments===
On 29 March 2011, it was reported that the torso was that of a 6-year-old named Ikpomwosa, after a television crew managed to track down a woman who used to care for him in Germany, due to his parents being deported back to Nigeria. Joyce Osiagede, a mother of two, had told ITV&#x27;s &quot;London Tonight&quot; that she handed the 6-year-old to a man—reportedly named Bawa—who proceeded to take the child to London. Detectives said that this was a &quot;major breakthrough&quot;.

In February 2013, the BBC was contacted by Osiagede, who declared that she was prepared to tell them everything she knew about the boy. Osiagede revealed that Adam&#x27;s real name was in fact Patrick Erhabor, and not Ikpomwosa. She also identified Bawa as Kingsley Ojo, and said that she had wrongly identified a photograph that had been circulating in the press as Patrick, when it was in fact of a friend&#x27;s living son. However, police doubts about her mental state meant that these claims are doubted by detectives, and thus, Adam has never been formally identified.

The Metropolitan Police believe the publicity surrounding the case has acted as a deterrent for further ritual crimes in the United Kingdom.

==Linked cases==
In July 2002, a Nigerian woman arrived in the United Kingdom from Germany, claiming to have fled from a Yoruba cult that practised ritual murders. She claimed that they attempted to kill her son, and that she knew Adam was murdered in London by his parents. However, police searching her flat found orange shorts with the same clothing label as those found on Adam. In December 2002, she was deported back to Nigeria.

Surveillance of the woman&#x27;s associates brought the police to another Nigerian, a man named Kingsley Ojo. Searches of Ojo&#x27;s house found a series of ritual items, but none of the DNA on the items matched Adam&#x27;s DNA. In July 2004, Ojo was charged with child trafficking offences, and jailed for four years.

<doc id="1009074" wikidata="Q17098201" url="?curid=1009074" title="Texans for a Republican Majority">
<text>Texans for a Republican Majority or TRMPAC (pronounced &quot;trimpac&quot;) is a general-purpose political action committee registered with the Texas Ethics Commission. It was founded in 2001 by former Republican Texas U.S. Rep. and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.

==History==
TRMPAC was founded on September 5, 2001, with the goal of naming a Republican Speaker in Texas and promoting the Republican party&#x27;s agenda within the state. John Colyandro was selected by Jim Ellis and Tom DeLay (R-Texas) to be executive director. Colyandro selected Dallas businessman Bill Ceverha as treasurer.

==Lawsuit==
A lawsuit brought against TRMPAC and Bill Ceverha as Treasurer brought by five Democratic candidates resulted in a court order to pay $196,600 in damages and attorney fees. Ceverha later stated that the case had cost him in excess of $850,000. Ceverha subsequently filed for bankruptcy. The case against the other two parties named in the suit, John Colyandro and Jim Ellis has been stayed pending the outcome of criminal charges against them.

Ceverha was later criticized for refusing to reveal the amount of a gift received from GOP donor Bob Perry despite holding a state post requiring a description of gifts under the state ethics laws. Ceverha claimed that the disclosure law was satisfied by describing the gift as &#x27;check&#x27;.

==Indictments==
Currently, several key members, lobbyists and officials associated with the organization are under indictment by a grand jury for felony violations of state campaign finance laws such as applying corporate campaign contributions (which may be used only for administrative expenses) to political campaigns. In September 2002, TRMPAC donated $190,000 to the Republican National Committee, which within days sent $190,000 raised from individuals to seven GOP House candidates.

James W. Ellis, the committee&#x27;s director, has been indicted for money laundering in connection with this investigation. In addition, Americans for a Republican Majority head Jim Ellis and John Colyandro, former executive director of Texans for a Republican Majority, were both charged in September 2005 with violating Texas election law and criminal conspiracy to violate the election law.

Preston, Gates, Ellis &amp; Rouvelas Meeds, reportedly lobbied for at least one donor to Texans for a Republican Majority, and also contributed $25,000 to TRM itself. It has been reported that former DeLay aide Michael Scanlon worked on the Preston Gates account for the firm making the donation, Burlington Northern.

Warren Robold, a national Republican fundraiser who solicited money for TRMPAC from several of the indicted corporations, faced nine third-degree felony charges of &#x27;making and accepting&#x27; prohibited corporate contributions.

Under Texas law, corporate donations may be used in state campaigns for administrative costs such as clerical needs or rent, but not for any purpose that might be used to influence voters.

<text>Wasi&#x27;chu is a loanword from the Sioux language (wašíču or waṡicu using different Lakota and Dakota language orthographies) which means a non-Indigenous person, particularly a white person, often with a disparaging meaning. 

The word has been widely adopted in English since the 1970s based on the belief that it literally means &quot;fat taker&quot; or greedy person and therefore carries an implied critique of white people and colonialism. Academic linguistic studies of the etymology of wašíču propose other origins for the word.

That the word&#x27;s underlying meaning is &quot;fat-taker&quot; or &quot;greedy&quot; is today affirmed by many Sioux people themselves, either as the word&#x27;s origin or as a modern evolution of the meaning. For example, academic and campaigner Nick Estes writes &quot;the highest insult in Lakota is to be greedy, to be wasicu&quot;.

==Etymology==
An often-cited etymology claims that the term wašíču derives from &quot;he who takes the fat&quot;, from Lakota &quot;&quot; (&quot;cooking fat&quot;) + &quot;cu&quot; (&quot;to take&quot;). This etymology/meaning is not present in online Dakota and Lakota dictionaries and is not present or is rejected in discussions of wašíču by academic linguists. 

Though many Sioux people themselves now report &quot;he who takes the fat&quot; as the original meaning of wašíču, this explanation of the word may be a relatively recent phenomenon. Linguist David R. Roth, writing in 1975 about the etymology of wašíču, reports that at that time Sioux people mostly believed the term wašíču came from &quot;iwašičuƞ&quot; meaning talkative or mouthy. 

Allan R Taylor, responding to Roth in 1976 rejects &quot;mouthy&quot; as the origin of wašíču and further considers and rejects &quot;he who takes the fat&quot;, stating that, &quot;It is implausible as a source.. ..since it ignores the necessarily nasalized vowel in &quot;wasį&quot; &#x27;bacon&#x27; [fat]&quot;. Taylor analyses the word as &quot;wa&quot; + &quot;šíču&quot; where &quot;wa&quot; is a particle meaning &quot;something coming from doing an action.&quot; He suggests that the original meaning of wašíču can be more readily explained as simply &quot;doer&quot; referring to the colonialists&#x27; access to technology unavailable to the Sioux. This closely parallels the etymology of words in other Native American languages meaning &quot;white man.&quot;

==Wasi&#x27;chu in contemporary English language sources==
Based on the understanding of the term as meaning &quot;he who takes the fat,&quot; wasi&#x27;chu has been widely discussed as a reflection of how Sioux people perceive non-Indigenous people&#x27;s relationship with the land and Indigenous Americans. As such, wasi&#x27;chu has been often used in English language materials since around 1970, with English language usage of the term rising sharply in the 2010s. This has included works of popular history in art, and in popular media; for example, as the title of an episode of the TV show &quot;Law and Order: Criminal Intent&quot; (2006), and in dialogue heard in &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (1990), &quot;Thunderheart&quot; (1992), &quot;White People&quot; documentary (2015), &quot;The Stand&quot; (2020), &quot;Yellowstone&quot; (2021), and &quot;Tulsa King&quot; (2022).

==Derived and related terms==
While it is commonly described as referring to white people a form of the term, &quot;waṡicu ha sapa&quot; (literally black wašíču) can be used to refer to African-Americans. &quot;Wašíču Ikčéka&quot; (Ordinary Whites) is the name for French people, and &quot;Wašíču Ikčéka Makȟóčhe&quot; is the name for France (Homelands of the Ordinary Whites). The French were among the first Europeans to interact with the Dakota during the fur trade era. Being referred to as Ikčé (ordinary) is an honor in Lakota/Dakota society.

Derived terms in Lakota include &quot;kiwašíču&quot; (&quot;assimilate&quot;) and &quot;igluwašíču&quot; (&quot;to make oneself like a non-indigenous/white person&quot;). In &quot;Dakhótiyapi&quot; (Dakota), &quot;Waṡicu iapi&quot; means the English language.

<doc id="1009081" wikidata="Q4593378" url="?curid=1009081" title="1998 Australian waterfront dispute">
<text>The Australian waterfront dispute of 1998 was an event in Australian industrial relations history, in which the Patrick Corporation undertook a restructuring of their operations for the purpose of dismissing their workforce. The restructuring by Patrick Corporation was later ruled illegal by Australian courts. The dispute involved Patrick Corporation terminating the employment of its workforce and locking out the workers of the workplace after the restructuring had taken place, with many of these workers members of the dominant Maritime Union of Australia. The resulting dismissal and locking out of their unionised workforce was supported and backed by the Australian Liberal/National Coalition Government.

Major events in the dispute occurred in four major ports, where the Patrick Corporation had significant operations: Melbourne, Brisbane, Fremantle and Sydney. It revolved around attempts by Patrick Corporation and the federal government to improve efficiency on Australia&#x27;s wharves; primarily by reducing staffing numbers and the power of the Maritime Union of Australia.

==Waterfront productivity==
Around 1995–96 approximately 70% of Australia&#x27;s imports and 78% of exports were transported by sea, amounting to approximately $60 billion in trade. This, however, does not include the revenue on car importations.

Data was collected throughout 1997 by the Productivity Commission, comparing international container stevedoring performance for the same ships and trades. The data indicated that Australia charged generally higher, productivity was lower and services were less reliable than overseas. With the exception of bulk grain loading, other areas of traditional stevedoring also performed relatively poorly. It also found that marine service and port infrastructure charges were, in total, two to three times greater than at overseas ports – noting that only some of this reflects cost-recovery pricing in Australia.

Together with other problems in the transport chain, this under-performance was not only resulting in higher direct costs to shippers, but also significant indirect costs from delays and unreliability which could have been reduced. Overall, the international benchmarking revealed significant scope for improvement in Australia&#x27;s performance.

==Industrial relations legislation==
John Howard, before being elected in 1996, had promised significant industrial relations reform. In January 1997, the Howard Government substantially amended the &quot;Industrial Relations Act 1988&quot;, and renamed it the &quot;Workplace Relations Act 1996&quot;. The stated aim of this legislation was to foster individual choice in workplace bargaining by reducing the powers of external organisations, particularly trade unions, to intervene. In addition, the legislation reduced powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate disputes. The Act also introduced individual statutory employment contracts. These were known as Australian Workplace Agreements or AWAs. The watering down of collective bargaining provisions was a source of objection from many workers and unions.

==Beginnings of the dispute==
Australian waterfront productivity had been an issue of concern since the 1980s. Patrick Corporation sought to improve productivity by creating redundancies and reducing overtime entitlements for its permanent employees, as well as hiring more employees on a casual basis. The Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) was formed through the amalgamation of two unions: the Seafarers Union of Australia (SUA), and the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF). The MUA was born from this background and retained a heavy union presence on the waterside.

At the time, it was mandatory for prospective employees to be card-carrying members of the MUA. The Howard Government sought to encourage a non-union workforce to compete against the MUA and made new legislative changes to bring this about.

After the legislative introduction of Australian Workplace Agreements, a number of stevedoring operators toyed with bringing individual contract workers into their workforces but abandoned their plans in the face of strident union opposition and activism.

==The Dubai operation==
One Australian stevedoring company, Fynwest Pty Ltd, sought to recruit former and current Australian Defence Force members to counter the MUA. In particular, from December 1997, Fynwest began a campaign to recruit former and current members of the Special Air Service (SAS), paratroopers from 3RAR, commandos from 4RAR and other military specialists, to become stevedores. Others were recruited from controversial private military and security consulting companies, such as Sandline International and the Control Risks Group. This led to the use of terms like &#x27;industrial mercenaries&#x27; in political and media circles.

Fynwest planned to send these recruits to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, where international standard training could be provided. The newly trained stevedores would then take part in an Australian non-union dock workers training program.

The MUA was &quot;tipped off&quot; about the planned Fynwest operation and took the matter to the media who met the departing Fynwest employees as they boarded a flight to Dubai and questioned their &quot;tourist&quot; status. Intense criticism and the threat of international industrial retaliation forced the Dubai government to cancel visas for the Fynwest company employees.

==The lock-out==

In September 1997, Patrick implemented a restructure whereby the functions of employing its unionised workforce and owning its stevedoring business were divided into different companies. The stevedoring businesses and assets previously held by the employer entities were transferred to other companies within the Patricks Group. In addition, the employer entities entered into various labour supply agreements with the owner entities to supply Patricks with labour. As a consequence, the labour supply agreements became the major asset of the employer entities.

Significantly, the labour supply agreements were terminable by the owner entities without notice in circumstances of industrial action. The details of the corporate restructure were not made known to Patrick&#x27;s employees or the MUA.

In late 1997 and early 1998, Patrick&#x27;s employees engaged in industrial action, most notably at Melbourne&#x27;s No 5 Webb Dock.

On 8 April 1998, Patrick&#x27;s management dismissed all of its employees; liquidated its assets, becoming technically insolvent; and imposed a lockout at most ports in which it operated.

Minister for Workplace Relations, Peter Reith read from a prepared brief, stating that the government fully supported Patrick in their action.

By the following morning the docks were fully operational with new non-union staff in place.

Industrial action and pickets continued at Patrick&#x27;s Docks around the country. A Supreme Court Injunction was obtained by Patrick&#x27;s effectively barring anyone from picketing the Webb Dock on 21 April which unions threaten to defy 

==Litigation==

The case went before the Federal Court with Justice North finding in favour of the union. He found that the company had deliberately restructured their corporate structure with the sole intent to dismiss their unionised workers.

The company with the support of the government appealed this decision to the full bench of the Federal Court which upheld Justice North&#x27;s earlier decision. The company appealed to the High Court of Australia with the government&#x27;s support. The High Court upheld the substance of the orders, but modified them to acknowledge the legitimate role of the (now insolvent) company&#x27;s administrators.

==Resolution==
The MUA and Patrick negotiated a new work agreement, which was adopted by the company and workers in June 1998. The agreement specified a near-halving of the permanent workforce through voluntary redundancies, the casualisation and contracting out of some jobs, smaller work crews, longer regular hours, company control over rostering, and productivity bonuses for faster loading. While the union retained the ability to represent maritime workers, the company achieved significant changes to work practices as it desired. Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith stated at the time &quot;There appears to be a number of reforms which will satisfy the seven benchmark objectives which are very important.&quot;

The original former military non-union workers had their contracts paid out by the employer (Fynwest/Patricks) at the conclusion of the dispute and received very generous payouts and bonuses in the order of $50,000 to $70,000 each.

===Broadcast history===
The series debuted on UPN on Monday September 11, 2000. After airing for several years on the network at 9/8C on Mondays, The CW moved &quot;Girlfriends&quot; to Sundays at 8/7C. After this, the ratings plummeted. On October 9, 2006, &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, along with The CW&#x27;s other African-American programs, moved back to Mondays. At this point, &quot;Girlfriends&quot; returned to its original time slot.

While UPN was still airing new episodes of &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, the network also began airing reruns five days per week. When the show moved to The CW network after UPN merged with The WB network, MyNetwork TV (which was created to take over UPN&#x27;s former affiliate stations) picked up the rights to air reruns of &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, although they eventually discontinued running them. WE tv, a network primarily focused on women&#x27;s programming, later acquired exclusive rights to air the limited-release episodes on Sundays and exercised an option to not allow broadcast television networks re-broadcast rights to these reruns.

Due to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, the last episodes produced aired on February 11, 2008. The CW had announced plans to move the series to Sunday nights. However, it was later announced on February 13, 2008 that the series was cancelled after 8 seasons and a proper series finale would not be produced. A representative from The CW stated that the network was going to cancel the series due to low ratings and that it would have been too expensive to re-enter production.

A retrospective episode was in development to conclude the series but was later scrapped. The network had offered the actors only half of their usual episodic salary to take part, and the actors collectively turned the offer down.

==Characters==
===Main===
* Joan Carol Clayton, Esq: (Tracee Ellis Ross) is considered the unofficial &quot;den mother&quot; of the group, as she frequently looks out for her friends, even at the expense of dealing with her own problems, which are plentiful throughout the series. Originally from Fresno, Joan owns a home in the Wilton Historic District. Joan met Toni when they were children and then met Lynn in college, and Maya is her assistant at the law firm. She has always had relationship problems and gave up her law career to pursue her dreams. She and Toni clash several times throughout the series, resulting in ending and then reconciling their friendship. Major incidents involved Joan inadvertently revealing Toni&#x27;s cheating to Greg, and Joan&#x27;s jealousy of Toni&#x27;s marriage to Todd, but their friendship officially ends by the end of Season 6 when Joan fails to appear for Toni&#x27;s custody hearing. For much of Season 7, Joan mourned the loss of her friendship with Toni, eventually opting to resent and belittle her in front of the group. At the end of Season 7, she became engaged to Aaron Waters, whom she met while rehabilitating homes in New Orleans damaged by Hurricane Katrina; she moved into his home in West Adams, Los Angeles, while Aaron was deployed to Iraq and rented her house to Lynn.
* Maya Denise Wilkes (née Wood): (Golden Brooks) is a former assistant to Joan and a housewife/author. Maya grew up in Compton, California and is married to her high school sweetheart, Darnell. They have one child, Jabari. Maya is the youngest and sassiest of the group, and is often at odds with Toni over her ego-driven lifestyle. She is a devoted wife and mother, and is frequently depicted with stronger religious and moral convictions. Maya is the most &quot;working-class&quot; member of the group, especially in earlier seasons. In the first few seasons Maya was more obviously &quot;from the hood&quot;, with the associated stereotyped speech and mannerisms. However, as she becomes more successful in her career and interacts more extensively with the legal and publishing industries, she exhibits fewer stereotypes; while still obviously from a different social background as the rest of the group, she is no longer as caricatured. In the early seasons, Maya&#x27;s marriage to Darnell imploded after she had an emotional affair with an acquaintance. Later, after she launches a career as a self-help author, they reunite. In Season 8, the couple endured a miscarriage and later explored the possibility of adopting a baby girl. Over the course of the series, Maya lived in South Central, Leimert Park, and finally bought her dream home with Darnell in Lancaster. At the end of Season 7, Maya and Darnell sell their home in Lancaster and move to West Adams, Los Angeles.
* Lynn Ann Searcy: (Persia White) was Joan and Toni&#x27;s roommate at UCLA and lived with Joan for eight years before the series begins. Lynn holds five post-graduate degrees. Born in Virginia to a black father and a bipolar white mother from a wealthy family, Lynn was adopted by a white family in Seattle (her dad affectionately calls her &quot;Noodle&quot;). She did not embrace her black heritage until college. When Joan decides it is time for Lynn to move out of her home, Lynn reluctantly becomes more independent by taking on various, mostly menial jobs. She previously lived with Toni, William, Maya, and Sivad (temporarily); and shared a garage with then-boyfriend Vosco before moving into her own apartment (after becoming a property manager at the complex where Maya lived). She produces a documentary on the HIV/AIDS pandemic, focusing on African-American women. While Lynn is depicted as the most sexually adventurous one of the group (with frequent mentions of one-night stands, group sex, sex toys, and her infamous &quot;Lynn Spin&quot;), she also dates frequently. She is most attracted to artistic and spiritual men, and over the course of the series has relationships with a Jamaican immigrant, a poet, a pastor, and a musician named Finn (the recording artist Tricky). She was also briefly married to William. Her romantic involvement with Lenny (who was so similar to Lynn that the others labeled him as her &quot;brother&quot;) was the catalyst for her to search for her biological father. After dating Finn, she discovers that music is her passion, and starts a band called &quot;Indigo Skye&quot;. Lynn is often considered the bohemian of the group, with her carefree nature and down-to-earth personality, and is a vegan. By Season 8, she had signed with &quot;Dirty Girl&quot; Records.
* Antoinette &quot;Toni&quot; Marie Childs-Garrett: (Jill Marie Jones, Seasons 1–6) has been Joan&#x27;s friend since they were eight-years-old, they attended elementary, high school, and college together. Toni grew up on poor on a farm with an alcoholic mother in Fresno, California, and has a twin brother, Antoine Childs. Toni is considered the shallow and popular one of the girlfriends and is the self-proclaimed &quot;cute one&quot; of the group. During the first season Toni and Maya don&#x27;t get along (she considered Maya to be a lower-class intruder), but ultimately embraced her friendship. Toni is a real-estate agent who eventually opens her own brokerage. She rekindles her romance with Greg Sparks (the &quot;love of her life&quot;), but he dumps her when he learns she cheated on him with Dr. Clay Spencer. Toni unexpectedly finds love with Todd Garrett, a white, Jewish plastic surgeon, whom she marries after a short courtship. After a rocky year-long marriage, the two separate after Todd moves to New York. Toni and Todd have a baby named Morgan. They fight over custody, but at the end of the 6th season work out their issues. Joan misses the custody hearing leading to the fight that ultimately ends Toni and Joan&#x27;s friendship. Toni moves to New York City so Morgan can be closer to Todd, but has maintained her friendships with Maya and Lynn. Toni&#x27;s condo was located in Hollywood Hancock Park.
* William Jerome Dent, Esq: (Reggie Hayes) is the girls&#x27; closest male friend. He is senior partner at Goldberg, Swedelson, McDonald and Lee. Hailing from Kansas City, Missouri he is portrayed as somewhat of a &quot;mama&#x27;s boy&quot;, but possesses self-confidence and a dry sense of humor. (One episode focused on his distant and complicated relationship with his father, who is a perfectionist.) After being left at the wedding altar by the woman he loved and police officer, Yvonne Blackwell, he reluctantly resumes dating, including Donna, Kara, senior partner Sharon Upton Farley (played by Anne-Marie Johnson), and the at-times vicious Monica Charles Brooks (whom he ultimately marries). Fearing that Joan would beat him to the altar, he eloped with Lynn on a whim; though he quickly realized that he wanted to find true love and they ultimately divorce. He later realizes that Joan is the right woman for him, but after three months of courting, the two end their relationship. He became a sperm donor for his sister Linda and her same-sex partner, and regards the baby as his &quot;nephew-son.&quot; He is also co-owner of the J-Spot restaurant with Joan. In later seasons, William forges a tight bond with Darnell, Maya&#x27;s husband. During Season 7, he was working on his marriage with Monica. According to William&#x27;s mother, his middle name is spelled with two &quot;R&quot;s, and a silent &quot;W&quot;. Beginning in season 2, William owns a home in the Valley.
* Darnell Leroy Wilkes: (Flex Alexander Season 1, and then Khalil Kain, Seasons 6–8, main; 2–5, recurring) is Maya&#x27;s husband. He and Maya married at a young age and had their son, Jabari. Darnell was an airport baggage handler, before becoming a mechanic at a local car repair shop. For a while, he was a NASCAR pit crew mechanic. After Maya&#x27;s affair with Stan Wright the two divorce. In earlier seasons, he felt threatened by Maya&#x27;s friendship with Joan, Toni and Lynn; though he ultimately put his issues aside and became friends with them. After the divorce, he dated a woman named Lena (Chenoa Maxwell) whom Maya disliked because she still had feelings for Darnell. At Lena and Darnell&#x27;s wedding Maya professed her love for Darnell. The two reconcile and begin living together again in Season 6. In the end of Season 7, Darnell accepts an offer to buy back his garage and get Maya and Jabari a new house in Los Angeles. After suffering a miscarriage, the couple considers adopting a baby girl.
* Monica Charles Brooks-Dent: (Keesha Sharp, Seasons 7–8, main; 3–6, recurring) is William&#x27;s wife. All four of the girlfriends (especially Lynn and Toni) hated her (Joan comes to see her vulnerable side and becomes her friend, and Toni moves to New York City at the end of the sixth season). In the seventh season, the girls slowly and later fully accept Monica as their friend as Monica does the same. Although engaged to William, the two date twice before; they meet at a bar the first time. Since the last time William proposes to her in Monaco, he has occasionally had doubts about ever doing so. Eventually William and Monica marry, but on their wedding day he has too much to drink and confesses that he has had and still has doubts about marrying her. Monica leaves William in Season 7, but returns shortly after the girlfriends go to Chicago to persuade her to get back together with William. On their visit, the girls discover that Monica, due to her father&#x27;s dementia and her mother&#x27;s power of attorney, has been cut off from her family fortune, so Joan offers Monica a job at the J-Spot. William is thrilled about Monica&#x27;s return until she demands half of what he earned while they were married. They manage to slowly rebuild their relationship but constantly clash at the J-Spot. In the Season 7 finale, Monica and William get back together. By Season 8, Monica was pregnant and is seen spending more time with the other three girlfriends, particularly Joan.

===Recurring===
* Jabari Darnell Wilkes: (Seasons 1–6 played by: Tanner Scott Richards, Season 7–8 played by: Kendré Berry) is Maya and Darnell&#x27;s son. He was born when Maya was 16 years old. He was depicted to be a sweet innocent child but once he entered his teen years he seemed to be a little more dimwitted and rebellious.
* Jeanette Wood: (played by Charmin Lee) is Maya&#x27;s no-nonsense mother who won&#x27;t hesitate to put a switch to her adult daughter. She babysat Jabari while he was younger, and also rented out her garage for Lynn and her then-boyfriend Vosco to live in after Joan kicked her out of her house. She initially took an instant dislike to Joan&#x27;s &quot;sadiddy&quot; behavior towards Maya&#x27;s style (also labeling Joan as &quot;classist&quot; and &quot;egregious&quot; as Maya does), but eventually grew to accept her. She and Maya also clash when she decides to sell her house to move to San Bernardino with her boyfriend Earl (Harry Lennix), whom Maya doesn&#x27;t like. Jeanette was seen throughout Seasons 1–7.
* Veretta Childs: (played by Jenifer Lewis) is Toni&#x27;s loud and outspoken mother from Fresno whose high-spirited behavior and garish outfits often embarrass Toni. She suffered from alcoholism during Toni&#x27;s formative years, which put a strain on their relationship. Veretta eventually sobered up. However, she briefly relapsed during Toni and Todd&#x27;s engagement party - this was partially due to her guilt over her daughters Toni and Sherri not getting along. While she and Toni often clash, she supports her daughter. Veretta appears throughout Seasons 2-6.
* Ronnie: (played by Lamont Johnson) is Maya&#x27;s cousin and hair stylist. In the series he helped sell her semi-biographical book. He owns two beauty salons called Situations and Situations Deux. He is last seen at the ending of season 7 as Aaron proposed to Joan.

Peaches is last seen at the ending of season 7 as Aaron proposes to Joan. Peaches also made a cameo in a season 2 episode of &quot;Eve&quot;.
*Sherri Childs: (played by Yvette Nicole Brown) Toni&#x27;s oldest sister whom she does not get along with due to Toni leaving the family due to their mother&#x27;s alcoholism to go to school.

She appears in two episodes in season 3.
* Davis Hamilton: (played by Randy J. Goodwin) owner and operator of the girls&#x27; favorite restaurant/hangout spot, 847 (Season 1). He and Joan flirted with one another, and almost went away for a romantic weekend while both were involved with other people. However, during Season 4, in the aftermath of Joan&#x27;s breakup with Brock, she runs into Davis at a movie theater. She learns that Davis had lost the restaurant and also ended his relationship with his fiancée. They talk about how they missed the opportunity to start a relationship, and ultimately decide to just remain friends.
* Charles Swedelson: (played by Phil Reeves) the managing partner at Goldberg, Swedelson, McDonald and Lee who is also Joan&#x27;s and William&#x27;s supervisor. Though highly professional, he is known to have a roving eye for the ladies, and tends to use &quot;hip-hop&quot; and &quot;urban&quot; euphemisms towards Joan and William to appear more laid back and sociable. Mr. Swedelson was seen throughout the entire series run.
* Yvonne Blackwell (pronounced Yuh Von): (played by Cee Cee Michaela) William&#x27;s girlfriend, later fiancée in the first two seasons. Yvonne originally was a crazy police officer that William met on the internet and went on a date in the Season 1 episode, &quot;Hip-Ocracy&quot; but Yvonne and William start dating midway through the first season and later get engaged at the beginning of Season 2. Yvonne quits the police force after her life was put on the line and after William issued her an ultimatum. During Season 2, Yvonne and William have some issues in their relationship mainly because William bought a house unbeknownst to Yvonne. Later in the episode, &quot;Willie or Won&#x27;t He II: The Last Chapter?&quot;, Yvonne and William marry but she leaves William at the altar after confessing the many issues happening in their relationship.
* Dr. Todd Garrett: (played by Jason Pace, seasons 3-6) A Jewish Beverly Hills Doctor that Toni later marries. He first appeared in the Season 3 episode &quot;Secrets and Eyes&quot;

==Awards and nominations==


==Spin-off==

&quot;The Game&quot;, a 2006 episode of &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, features guest star Tia Mowry as Joan&#x27;s cousin Melanie Barnett, an aspiring medical student who wants to give up her future to follow her professional athlete boyfriend to San Diego. That episode was the launching pad for &quot;The Game&quot;, a spin-off series, which was canceled by The CW television network. In April 2010, BET announced that it would pick up the series, which aired new episodes until the August 5, 2015 series finale. When the fourth season of &quot;The Game&quot; premiered in 2011 it received 7.7 million viewers, which at the time of its airing, made the show the most watched sitcom premiere in cable television history. In November 2021, a revival spin-off of the series was picked up and released to Paramount+, serving as a direct sequel from the original series and was promoted as a refreshed series (rebooted and marketed as season 1) while also subsequently continuing the overall total seasons (chronicled as season 10). The new inception continues where it left off from the 2015 finale a few years later switching gears set in the new location of Las Vegas with the new protagonists of reprised characters, chronicling Tasha Mack and her struggles of being a woman of color sports agent; while her son Malik Wright learns to make important decisions in his sports career while quietly battling mental health issues and Brittany Pitts who is navigating her adult life taking on serious financial hardships and responsibilities becoming independent away from her Pro-Football dad&#x27;s (Jason Pitts) image and inheritance. The revived series also introduces new characters to the storyline. The reboot has also garnered favorable and positive reviews from media outlets.

<text>Predrag Radosavljević (; born June 24, 1963), better known by the nickname Preki (), is a former soccer player and coach. He is currently an assistant coach with Seattle Sounders FC in Major League Soccer (MLS). He previously coached Sacramento Republic FC and Saint Louis FC in the United Soccer League and coached in MLS with Toronto FC and Chivas USA. Born in Yugoslavia, he represented the United States national team.

He played indoor soccer in the United States for over a decade, being considered among the best indoor players of all time. During his playing football career, he played for English clubs Everton and Portsmouth, and was an &#x27;MLS original&#x27; upon the formation of MLS in 1996, playing for the Kansas City Wizards (now known as Sporting Kansas City) and Miami Fusion. He is the only two-time winner of the MLS MVP award, now known as the Landon Donovan MVP Award, and represented the United States at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He was elected to the American National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2010.

In 2015 Preki left his managing role at Sacramento Republic FC by mutual consent. It was thought that he had landed the Leicester City FC job, but it was given to Claudio Ranieri.

==Playing career==

===Professional===
Born in Belgrade, SR Serbia, Preki played briefly for Red Star Belgrade in the old Yugoslav First League after coming from FK Čukarički where he played in their youth team. In the summer of 1985, the Tacoma Stars head coach Bob McNab spotted Preki at an indoor tournament in Belgrade and sent him to the United States. He played five seasons for the Stars. During those years, he was a three-time First Team All Star, the 1988 and 1989 All Star Game MVP, led the league in assists in 1988 and scoring in 1989, and was the 1989 MISL MVP. During the summer of 1989, Preki began to consider becoming a U.S. citizen and returning to the outdoor game in order to make himself eligible for the U.S. national team. He played one season for Råslätts SK in Sweden in 1990. The Stars released Preki in July 1990 as part of a salary reduction move. In August, he signed with the St. Louis Storm. He played two seasons in St. Louis before being bought by Everton manager Howard Kendall for a fee of £100,000 in the summer of 1992 following a trial. He made 53 appearances for the Blues, 28 of those as a substitute. In June 1994, Preki signed with the San Jose Grizzlies of the Continental Indoor Soccer League where he rejoined Bob McNab from his Tacoma days. He played eight games, scoring sixteen goals, before returning to England in August 1994 to play for Portsmouth. On July 5, 1995, the Grizzlies purchased Preki&#x27;s contract from Portsmouth. He was the CISL&#x27;s second-leading scorer and league MVP.

===Major League Soccer===
Preki resumed outdoor play beginning with MLS&#x27;s inaugural season in 1996 when he joined the Kansas City Wiz, renamed the Wizards after the 1996 season. The league allocated him to the Wiz on February 6, 1996. He was named to the MLS All-Star for five straight years between 1996 and 2000, being the MVP of the 1999 match after scoring a first-half brace to lead his side to a 6–4 win. In 1997, he won the scoring title with 41 points as well as the league MVP award. On 9 September 1998, Preki scored a hat-trick and made two assists against San Jose Earthquakes, tying a league record with eight points in a single game. In the opening match of the 2000 season, Preki scored his side&#x27;s fourth goal in a 4–3 win over Chicago Fire, which proved to be crucial as both sides finished the 2000 regular season with a record-breaking 57 points, but the Wizards won the Supporters&#x27; Shield due to the goal difference. On 15 October, the 37-year-old Preki started in the 2000 MLS Cup, again against Chicago Fire, which ended in a 1–0 victory, being one of only three players, along with Mo Johnston and Uche Okafor, to have been a member of the inaugural Wizards team. The 2000 season still is the most successful in the club&#x27;s history. Between 1996 and 2000, Preki scored a total of 50 goals in 145 appearances for Kansas City.

In 2001, Preki joined the Miami Fusion and scored eight goals and 14 assists in 24 games, thus playing a crucial role in the turnaround that saw the Fusion go from worst to first, winning his second Supporters Shield for the best regular season record in MLS. After spending the 2001 campaign with the Miami Fusion, Preki was able to rejoin his former club in the 2002 MLS Dispersal Draft, but only after every other team in the league had passed on selecting him. On 23 March 2002, he became MLS&#x27; all-time leading scorer with 223 points (65g, 93a), and finished that season as the team&#x27;s leading scorer with 24 points (7g, 10a). On 31 May 2003, Preki notched two late goal contributions against New England Revolution to salvage a 2–2 away draw, marking the first time that Kansas City had come away with a road result after trailing by two goals with 20 minutes remaining. In 2003, the 40-year-old Preki played and started 30 games for the Wizards, logging nearly 2,700 minutes. His season total of 12 goals and 17 assists won him the MLS Most Valuable Player award, making him the oldest-ever winner of the award and also the only player to win MLS MVP more than once.

On 21 February 2004, Preki suffered a fractured fibula and dislocated left ankle during a preseason exhibition match and missed four months of the season, returning only in a 1–2 loss to Columbus Crew on 18 August. On 10 September, he underwent a arthroscopic surgery on his left ankle that ended his season, so he did not participate in Kansas&#x27; triumphant campaign in the 2004 U.S. Open Cup. He retired following the 2005 season, scoring a goal in the last minute of his final game with Kansas City to salvage a 2–2 draw with FC Dallas on 15 October, and in doing so at the age of 42 years and 111 days, he became both the oldest player and the oldest scorer in MLS history, although the appearance record has since been broken by Pat Onstad in 2011. He was named to the MLS All-Time Best XI after his retirement.

Preki is the only player to have won the MLS MVP Award and the MLS Scoring Champion Award (now respectively known as the Landon Donovan MVP Award and the MLS Golden Boot) twice, winning in 1997 and 2003, and is also the current all-time league leader in points with 270 (79 goals and 112 assists, plus another 25 points on 10 goals and 5 assists in the playoffs). Preki is still widely regarded as the greatest player in Kansas City&#x27;s history, as he ranks first on career charts for both goals (79), and assists (112).

===International===
Originally from Yugoslavia, Preki was living and working in the U.S. in 1985 but when he was offered a spot on the U.S. national team he applied for U.S. citizenship which was granted on October 25, 1996. He made his debut for the United States on November 3, 1996, against Guatemala at the age of 33, making him one of the oldest players to make an international debut. Preki played a total of 28 games for the U.S., scoring four goals, one of them to beat Brazil at the 1998 Gold Cup. He made his last appearance for the national team in a 2–0 loss away to Costa Rica in World Cup qualifying on September 5, 2001.

==Coaching career==
Upon the appointment of Bob Bradley as the United States national team head coach, Preki was promoted as head coach of Chivas USA for the 2007 Major League Soccer season.

Preki left Chivas &quot;by mutual consent&quot; on November 12, 2009, following Chivas&#x27; failure to progress to the latter stages of the MLS playoffs. He became head coach of Toronto FC on November 19, 2009. However, Preki didn&#x27;t last the 2010 MLS season with Toronto, being fired along with General Manager Mo Johnston on September 14, 2010. Under Preki, Toronto qualified for the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League after winning the 2010 Canadian Championship.

On July 15, 2013, after nearly three years out of coaching, Preki was named head coach of the USL Professional Division (now United Soccer League) expansion Sacramento Republic FC in advance of their inaugural 2014 season. He won the USL Pro Championship game in September 2014 with the club. On July 8, 2015, Preki announced his resignation from his post to take up a coaching role in the United Kingdom.

On October 12, 2016, USL club Saint Louis FC introduced Preki as its coach for the upcoming 2017 season. On November 20, 2017, Saint Louis FC relieved Preki of his coaching duties.

In January 2018, Preki was hired as an assistant coach to Brian Schmetzer with the Seattle Sounders FC.

<text>Shiva Naipaul (; 25 February 1945 – 13 August 1985), born Shivadhar Srinivasa Naipaul in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, was an Indo-Trinidadian and British novelist and journalist.

==Life and work==
Shiva Naipaul was the younger brother of novelist V. S. Naipaul. He went first to Queen&#x27;s Royal College and St Mary&#x27;s College in Trinidad, then emigrated to Britain in 1964, having won a scholarship to study Chinese at University College, Oxford. At Oxford, he met and later married Jenny Stuart, with whom he had a son, Tarun.

With Jenny&#x27;s support, Shiva Naipaul wrote his first novel, &quot;Fireflies&quot; (1970), which won the Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize from the Royal Society of Literature for best regional novel. It was followed by &quot;The Chip-Chip Gatherers&quot; (1973). He then decided to concentrate on journalism, and wrote two non-fiction works, &quot;North of South&quot; (1978) and &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; (1980), before returning to the novel form in the 1980s with &quot;A Hot Country&quot; (1983), a departure from his two earlier comic novels set in Trinidad, as well as a collection of fiction and non-fiction, &quot;Beyond the Dragon&#x27;s Mouth: Stories and Pieces&quot; (1984).

===Death===
On the morning of 13 August 1985, at the age of 40, Naipaul had a fatal heart attack while working at his desk. In an essay V. S. Naipaul wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, published in 2019, his older brother reports that he was not surprised at the time to hear about Shiva&#x27;s death, that Shiva was a drinker, and that a year prior to his death (at a funeral for their younger sister that both had attended) V. S. describes having already seen &quot;the look of death in his brother&#x27;s face&quot;.

==Literary reception==
Shiva Naipaul did not receive much positive acclaim from reviewers in his lifetime, although he won the Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize for best regional novel from the Royal Society of Literature for &quot;Fireflies&quot; (1970). An early review by John G. Moss was critical of Naipaul&#x27;s debut, saying:

In 1985, Anglo-Nigerian scholar and writer Adewale Maja-Pearce said that the Naipaul brothers&#x27; portrayals of Africa were overly informed by their &quot;slavish worship of an alien tradition which they have adopted wholesale and which they use to measure everything that falls outside it&quot;. In 2004, Kenyan literature scholar Tom Odhiambo made a similar critique, saying Shiva Naipaul&#x27;s portrayal of East Africa in &quot;North of South: An African Journey&quot; suffered from its over-reliance on existing Western accounts (a &quot;biased archive&quot;) of the wider continent. He writes:

Following Naipaul&#x27;s death, some reviewers became more accepting of his work. Martin Amis wrote, in his obituary for Naipaul, &quot;The moment I finished his first novel, &quot;Fireflies&quot; [1970], I felt delight in being alive at the same time as such a writer … there are many people with whom I can initiate a long train of quotation — and laughter — from that book alone.&quot; In 1998, scholar Richard F. Patteson said Naipaul had been &quot;openly reviled by some Caribbean critics on grounds more political than aesthetic&quot;. In 2003, Mohamed Bakari, comparing him to his older brother Vidia, described Naipaul as &quot;equally gifted&quot;. In 2005, his friend and colleague Geoffrey Wheatcroft said he wrote &quot;splendid journalism&quot;, even though he hated being a journalist.

In 2008, writing for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Christopher Hitchens called Naipaul&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Fireflies&quot; &quot;one of the great tragicomic novels of our day&quot;. That same year, Paul Theroux published &quot;Sir Vidia&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, a memoir of Shiva&#x27;s elder brother, V. S. Naipaul. In it, Theroux takes issue with the younger Naipaul&#x27;s literary skills, particularly as a travel writer. In 2009, scholar S. Walter Perera said Naipaul&#x27;s &quot;An Unfinished Journey&quot; was &quot;a palpable example of traditional travel writing&quot;, but criticises Naipaul&#x27;s &quot;critical rigor&quot; and &quot;First or Second World perspective&quot;.

In 2018, C. Darius Stonebanks said Naipaul&#x27;s work has value for its consideration of the experiences and positionality of brownness as a racial category, especially in the chapter &quot;Between Master and Slave&quot; in &quot;North of South&quot;. He concludes:

In 2020, Bénédicte Ledent writes of Naipaul&#x27;s attempts to &quot;come to a personal understanding of other peoples, and eventually of himself&quot; in his travel writing. Ledent says that ultimately:

In 2024, George Cochrane suggested in &quot;The Critic&quot; that Naipaul had been &quot;unjustly overlooked&quot;. He commends Naipaul&#x27;s &quot;immaculate prose style&quot; and says &quot;Living in Earl&#x27;s Court&quot; is &quot;an important work of Windrush literature and an interrogation of its author’s wanderlust&quot;. Cochrane also suggests that because the younger Naipaul son was raised primarily by his mother, after the death of his father Seepersad Naipaul, his ability to write from the female perspective was &quot;correspondingly strong&quot;, unlike his older brother&#x27;s. At Naipaul&#x27;s best, he says, his articles are &quot;models of good journalism, full of vivid reportage, provocative opinion and a formidably assured grasp of the (very complex) issues&quot;. He further says that while Naipaul was critical of Africa, &quot;there is no question of him defending colonialism, as there is with Vidia&quot;. 

== Legacy ==
The novelist Martin Amis wrote that &quot;Shiva Naipaul was one of those people who caused your heart to lift when he entered the room ... in losing him, we have lost thirty years of untranscribed, unvarnished genius&quot;. An &quot;Arena&quot; documentary on his brother V. S. Naipaul reproduced footage of Shiva from an earlier documentary from the early 1980s, in which Shiva returned to Trinidad to see his mother.

Shiva Naipaul&#x27;s literary archive is held at the British Library. The collection (The Shiva Naipaul Archive) &quot;consists of autograph and typescript drafts of Shiva Naipaul&#x27;s fiction novels, non-fiction and travel writing. It also includes research and drafts relating to his articles, short stories and prose. There is a run of autograph notebooks, largely with notes and research gathered on his travels in India, Trinidad and Tobago, Surinam, Guyana, America, South Africa, Africa, and Australia. There is correspondence dating form his university days, with his family, his wife and a run of business correspondence.&quot;

&quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine, for which his wife Jenny had worked as a secretary, and which had published many of his articles, established the Shiva Naipaul Memorial Prize in his name until 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;spectator/Tan/prize-open&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spectator/tag/prize&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text> () most commonly refers to a &quot;completed action&quot;, technique or practice within a yoga discipline meant to achieve a specific result. 

==Etymology==
 is a Sanskrit term, derived from the Sanskrit root , meaning &#x27;to do&#x27;. &#x27; means &#x27;action, deed, effort&#x27;. The word &quot;karma&quot; is also derived from the Sanskrit root &#x27; () , meaning &#x27;to do, make, perform, accomplish, cause, effect, prepare, undertake&#x27;. &quot;Karma&quot; is related to the verbal Proto-Indo-European root &#x27;to make, form&#x27;.

The root () is common in ancient Sanskrit literature, and it is relied upon to explain ideas in Rigveda, other Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and the Hindu epics.

==Practices==
The &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot; 2.1 defines three types of , namely &quot;tapas&quot; (ascetic devotion), &quot;svadhyaya&quot; (study of the self or the scriptures), and (devotion or surrender to higher consciousness).

The yogic purifications or &quot;shatkarma&quot;s are sometimes called the Shatkriyas (&quot;the six actions&quot;).

The Kriya Yoga school, established by Yogananda, is centered on pranayama techniques.

<text>The Belarus national football team (; ) represents Belarus in men&#x27;s international football, and is controlled by the Football Federation of Belarus, the governing body for football in Belarus. Belarus&#x27; home ground is Dinamo Stadium in Minsk. Since independence in 1991, Belarus has not yet qualified for a FIFA World Cup or UEFA European Championship.

==History==
After the split of the Soviet Union, Belarus played their first match against Lithuania on 20 July 1992. Before that, a number of Belarusian players played for the Soviet Union national team. The first FIFA-recognized international was a friendly against Ukraine on 28 October 1992, and their first win came in a match against Luxembourg on 12 October 1994.

Belarus have never qualified for either the FIFA World Cup, or the UEFA European Championship. The team were defeated by Wales in the last 2002 group stage match, missing the chance to overtake Ukraine, who drew their last game, finishing the group second.

Their Euro 2004 qualifying campaign was very unsuccessful as Belarus lost seven of their eight games.

Belarus achieved some success in minor tournaments. In 2002, the team defeated Russia and Ukraine to win the LG Cup. In 2004 and 2008, they won the 12th and 14th editions of the Malta International Tournament, respectively.

Belarus won their group in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League D that contained Luxembourg, Moldova, and San Marino, and qualified for the country&#x27;s first-ever playoffs after they finished fourth in their group during UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying, and the team was scheduled to play against Georgia. However, they lost 1–0, missing out on a place at Euro 2020.

==Team image==

===Nickname===
In August 2016, the Football Federation announced that the team&#x27;s nickname would be the &quot;White Wings&quot;. The name was influenced by the book (1977) by Belarusian writer Uladzimir Karatkievich. The BFF&#x27;s marketing and communications director said: &quot;We are looking at various ways of establishing links with our literary heritage and cultural traditions&quot;, commenting that &quot;If the Belarusian people opt to associate the team with Karatkevich, almost every phrase in the book can be used as a hashtag!&quot;

===Home venue===
The team played the majority of its home matches at the Dinamo Stadium in Minsk. In late 2012 Dinamo Stadium was closed for renovation and the team started alternating between different home venues.

Since September 2021, Central Stadium in Kazan, Russia is the home venue because of travel sanctions imposed after an incident with Ryanair Flight 4978.

Due to Belarusian involvement in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, UEFA, the European governing body for football, banned Belarusian national and club teams from hosting international matches and competitions while allowing the Belarusian club and national team to play competitively, albeit at a neutral ground and behind closed doors.

===Kit===
In 2011, home colors were changed to all red. All-White became the home colour a short time later and now appears with the pattern on the Belarus flag, with the away kit being in Black in 2016, also using an adidas template and placing the flag pattern on it.

<doc id="1009121" wikidata="Q1418042" url="?curid=1009121" title="Painted ladies">
<text>In American architecture, painted ladies are Victorian and Edwardian houses and buildings repainted, starting in the 1960s, in three or more colors that embellish or enhance their architectural details. The term was first used for San Francisco Victorian houses by Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen in their 1978 book &quot;Painted Ladies: San Francisco&#x27;s Resplendent Victorians&quot;. Although polychrome decoration was common in the Victorian era, the colors used on these houses are not based on historical precedent.

Since then, the term has also been used to describe groups of colorfully repainted Victorian houses in other American cities, such as the Charles Village neighborhood in Baltimore; Lafayette Square in St. Louis; the greater San Francisco and New Orleans areas, in general; Columbia-Tusculum in Cincinnati; the Old West End in Toledo, Ohio; the neighborhoods of McKnight and Forest Park in Springfield, Massachusetts; and the city of Cape May, New Jersey. They also exist internationally, for example in New Zealand&#x27;s capital city Wellington.

== San Francisco&#x27;s painted ladies ==

Approximately 48,000 houses in the Victorian and Edwardian styles were built in San Francisco between 1849 and 1915 (with the change from Victorian to Edwardian occurring on the death of Queen Victoria in 1901). Many were painted in bright colors. As one newspaper critic noted in 1885, &quot;… red, yellow, chocolate, orange, everything that is loud is in fashion … if the upper stories are not of red or blue … they are painted up into uncouth panels of yellow and brown …&quot; While many of the mansions of Nob Hill were destroyed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, thousands of the mass-produced, modest houses survived in the western and southern neighborhoods of the city.

During World War I and World War II many of these houses were painted battleship gray with war-surplus Navy paint. Another sixteen thousand were demolished. Many others had the Victorian décor stripped off or covered with tarpaper, brick, stucco, or aluminum siding.

In 1963, San Francisco artist Butch Kardum began combining intense blues and greens on the exterior of his Italianate-style Victorian house. His house was criticized by some, but other neighbors began to copy his example. Kardum became a color designer, and he and other artist/colorists such as Tony Canaletich, Bob Buckter, and Jazon Wonders began to transform dozens of gray houses into Painted Ladies. By the 1970s, the colorist movement, as it was called, had changed entire streets and neighborhoods. The process continues to this day.

One of the best-known groups of &quot;Painted Ladies&quot; is the row of Victorian houses at 710–720 Steiner Street across from Alamo Square park. It is sometimes known as &quot;Postcard Row&quot;; they are also known as the Seven Sisters. The houses were built between 1892 and 1896 by developer Matthew Kavanaugh, who lived next door in the 1892 mansion at 722 Steiner Street. This block appears very frequently in media and mass-market photographs of the city and its tourist attractions and has appeared in an estimated 70 movies, TV programs, and ads, including in the opening credits of the television series &quot;Full House&quot; and its sequel &quot;Fuller House&quot;. The house at 714 Steiner sold for $3.5 million in 2020 and was for sale again in 2022.&lt;br&gt;

<text>Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg (&quot;Katarina&quot; in Swedish) (24 September 1513 – 23 September 1535) was Queen of Sweden as the first wife of Gustav I from 1531 until her death in 1535.

==Life==
Catherine was born in Ratzeburg to Magnus I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg and Catherine, daughter of Henry IV, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Her marriage to Gustav I of Sweden was arranged for political reasons. Gustav wished to marry shortly after having taken the Swedish throne. He had failed in his negotiations to marry Dorothea of Denmark (also proposed to by Philip of Hesse who was considered more advantageous); Sophia of Mecklenburg; Anna of Pomerania (parents considered his rule too unstable); and Hedwig of Poland (parents discontinued negotiations because of Swedish Reformation), and was finally advised to consider the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg.

Though the duchy was small and poor, it had many advantages: its dynasty was related to many of the most powerful dynasties of Europe, which would give valuable connections with the German princes; it was Protestant, which was important for the ongoing Swedish Reformation, but could also give Imperial connections through Catherine&#x27;s mother; it would give a valuable link to Denmark, as Catherine&#x27;s older sister Dorothea was married to Christian, the Crown Prince of Denmark; and finally, the duchy at that point was known as a center for mercenaries, which was important for Gustav as a newly established ruler. The negotiations started in 1528, but were delayed several years as the bride&#x27;s father doubted the stability of the Swedish throne, doubt partially confirmed by events such as the Dalecarlian rebellions. Finally, with mediation from Lübeck, they were completed after almost three years, and Catherine was granted the counties of Korsholm, Kalmar and Öland as a dower.

In September 1531, Catherine was escorted to Sweden on a fleet by the &quot;highest lords and ladies of the realm&quot; headed by her future sister-in-law Margaret with her spouse Count John of Hoya, and met her future husband for the first time. Their wedding was celebrated in Stockholm on her 18th birthday 24 September 1531. Shortly after the royal wedding, in events hosted by King Gustav and Queen Catherine, Brita Leijonhufvud, the daughter of the king&#x27;s second cousin Ebba Eriksdotter Vasa, was married to the king&#x27;s courtier and favorite Gustav Olsson Stenbock (they were to be the parents of the king&#x27;s third wife Catherine Stenbock) and the king&#x27;s niece Brita Joakimsdotter Brahe was engaged to &quot;riksråd&quot; Birger Nilsson Grip. These were the first events Catherine hosted as queen of Sweden.

Very little is known about Queen Catherine as a person and her tenure as queen. There is no information on her courtiers, though she is assumed to have brought ladies-in-waiting from Germany in addition to her Swedish ones, among whom Margaret Leijonhufvud (the king&#x27;s future second queen) is likely to have been one. Traditional history describes Catherine as capricious, cold, melancholic and discontent, and the marriage has been described as a stormy and unhappy one. There is, however, no contemporary information on that. On 13 December 1533, she fulfilled her most important task as queen consort by giving birth to an heir to the throne: the future King Erik XIV.

In September 1535, during a ball given in honor of her brother-in-law, King Christian III of Denmark, who was visiting the Swedish royal court, Queen Catherine fell while pregnant during a dance with Christian III. The fall confined her to bed and led to complications, and she died on 23 September with her unborn child.

At the time of her death, King Gustav was involved in the Count&#x27;s Feud, and his opponents in this conflict, Lübeck and Rostock, spread the rumor that he had murdered his queen by beating her on the head with a silver cane after a report from a spy that she had slandered him to Christian while dancing. The exhumation of Catherine&#x27;s skeleton done in the 1940s showed no sign of any such injury, and no accusations were ever made by her family. Furthermore, Christian III himself confirmed the serious fall of Queen Catherine in his private letters, even though he was no friend of Gustav Vasa&#x27;s.

In traditional history writings, Queen Catherine was given a bad reputation and often presented as a bad example, by contrast to the second queen of Gustav I, Queen Margaret, who was made out to be a stereotypically and perfectly ideal queen.

<text>John Byrne Leicester Warren, 3rd Baron de Tabley (26 April 1835 – 22 November 1895) was an English poet, numismatist, botanist and an authority on bookplates.
==Life==
He was eldest son of George Fleming Leicester (afterwards Warren), Lord de Tabley (1811–1887), by his wife (married: 1832) Catherina Barbara (1814–1869), second daughter of Jerome, Count de Salis-Soglio.

The young Warren, as he then was, was educated at Eton from 1847 to 1851, in the Rev. Edward Coleridge&#x27;s house, and then at Christ Church, Oxford, where he took his degree in 1856 with second class honours in classics, law, and modern history. In the autumn of 1858 he went to Turkey as unpaid attaché to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe. In 1860 he was called to the bar from Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He was commissioned as a part-time Lieutenant into the Cheshire Yeomanry and unsuccessfully contested Mid-Cheshire in 1868 as a Liberal.

After his mother died and his father&#x27;s re-marriage in 1871 Warren removed to London, where he became a close friend of Tennyson. Tennyson once said of him: &#x27;He is Faunus, he is a woodland creature&#x27;.

From 1877 until his succession to the barony and estates in 1887, Warren was lost to his friends, assuming the life of a recluse. It was not until 1892, five years after becoming Lord de Tabley, that he returned to London life and enjoyed a renaissance of reputation and friendship.

During the later years of his life, Tabley made many new friends, besides reopening old associations, and he seemed to be gathering around him a small literary company when his health broke, and he died at Ryde on the Isle of Wight in his sixty-first year. He is buried at St Oswald’s Church, Lower Peover in Cheshire.

Although his reputation will live almost exclusively as that of a poet, Tabley was a man of many studious tastes. He was at one time an authority on numismatics (he was a first cousin of the numismatist John, Count de Salis-Soglio), he wrote two novels, published &quot;A Guide to the Study of Book Plates&quot; (1880), and the fruit of his careful researches in botany was printed posthumously in his elaborate &quot;Flora of Cheshire&quot; (1899).

Poetry, however, was his first and last passion, and to that he devoted the best energies of his life. Lord de Tabley&#x27;s first impulse towards poetry came from his friend George Fortescue, with whom he shared a close companionship during his Oxford days, and whom he lost, as Tennyson lost Hallam, within a few years of their taking their degrees. Fortescue was killed by falling from the mast of Lord Drogheda&#x27;s yacht in November 1859, and this gloomy event plunged Tabley into a deep depression. Between 1859 and 1862 he issued four little volumes of pseudonymous verse (by G. F. Preston), in the production of which he had been greatly stimulated by the sympathy of Fortescue. Once more he assumed a pseudonym: his &quot;Praeterita&quot; (1863) bearing the name of William Lancaster.

In the next year he published &quot;Eclogues and Monodramas&quot;, followed in 1865 by &quot;Studies in Verse&quot;. These volumes all displayed technical grace and much natural beauty; but it was not until the publication of Philoctetes in 1866 that Tabley met with any wide recognition. &quot;Philoctetes&quot; bore the initials M.A., which, to the author&#x27;s dismay, were interpreted as meaning Matthew Arnold. He at once disclosed his identity, and received the congratulations of his friends, among whom were Tennyson, Browning and Gladstone.

In 1867 he published &quot;Orestes&quot;, in 1870 &quot;Rehearsals&quot; and in 1873 &quot;Searching the Net. These last two bore his own name, John Leicester Warren&quot;. He was somewhat disappointed by their lukewarm reception, and when in 1876 &quot;The Soldier of Fortune&quot;, a drama on which he had bestowed much careful labor, proved a complete failure, he retired altogether from the literary arena.

It was not until 1893, that he was persuaded to return, and the immediate success in that year of his &quot;Poems, Dramatic and Lyrical&quot;, encouraged him to publish a second series in 1895, the year of his death. The genuine interest with which these volumes were welcomed did much to lighten the last years of a somewhat sombre and solitary life. His posthumous poems were collected in 1902.

Arthur Waugh gives the following assessment of Tabley as a poet:
There is also a sketch of Lord de Tabley by Edmund Gosse in his &quot;Critical Kit-Kats&quot; (1896). This is an extract of what Gosse wrote:

==Sisters==
*Catherine (1838–1881). Buried Harlington, Middlesex.
*Meriel (1839–72), married (1862), Allen, 6th Earl Bathurst (1832–1892), of Cirencester. (He succeeded in 1878, after her death).
*Eleanor (1841-14 August 1914), married (1864), Sir Baldwyn Leighton, MP, 8th Baronet (1836-2 January 1897), of Loton, Salop.
::::::She was (eventual) heir to her brother in 1895, and in 1900 took the name Leighton-Warren.
*Margaret (1847–1921), married (1875), Sir Arthur Cowell-Stepney, 2nd Bt, (aka Emile Algernon Arthur Keppel Cowell-Stepney) (1834–1909), of Llanelli.
:::Their daughter &quot;Catherine Muriel&quot; [sic] &quot;Cowell Stepney (Miss Alcyone Stepney)&quot; (1876-1952), was painted by Sir John Everett Millais, Royal Academy, 1880, no. 239. Of Cilymaenllwyd, Llanelli, she married Sir Stafford Howard, KCB, DL, JP, MP in 1911.

*and two other children, who both died in infancy.

<text>Larry Harvey (January 11, 1948 – April 28, 2018) was an American artist, philanthropist and activist. He was the main co-founder of the Burning Man event, along with his friend Jerry James.

==Early life==
Born in San Francisco, Harvey grew up in Portland, Oregon, where he was raised in the Parkrose neighborhood. He graduated from Parkrose High School in 1966. After high School, he joined the army and served as a clerk stationed in Germany. He later attended Portland State University.

==Burning Man==

Burning Man started in 1986 on the evening of the summer solstice. An effigy of a man was taken to San Francisco&#x27;s Baker Beach and set on fire. A small crowd gathered and soon the burning of the man became an annual event. Over the next four years the attendees grew to more than 800 people. In 1990, in collaboration with the SF Cacophony Society, the event moved to the Black Rock Desert, Nevada, and took place over Labor Day weekend. From a three-day, 80-person &quot;zone trip,&quot; Burning Man became an eight-day counter culture event with 70,000 participants from all over the world.

In 1997, six of the main organizers formed Black Rock City LLC to manage the event, with Harvey as the executive director, a position he held until his death. Harvey was also the president of the Black Rock Arts Foundation, a non-profit art grant foundation for promoting interactive collaborative public art installations in communities outside of Black Rock City.

==Philosophy and activities==
Larry Harvey was a voracious reader and was heavily influenced by works such as Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community by Robert Putnam, The Varieties of Religious Experience by William James, and the writings of Sigmund Freud.

He scripted and co-chaired/curated the Burning Man art department and its annual event theme. Harvey was the main spokesperson and political strategist for the Burning Man organization. He had been featured in such engagements as San Francisco&#x27;s Grace Cathedral &quot;Radical Ritual&quot; with Alan Jones, the Oxford Student Union, Cooper Union in New York City, Harvard&#x27;s International Conference on Internet and Society as a panelist, and the San Francisco Commonwealth Club.

==Death==
Harvey died on April 28, 2018, due to complications related to a stroke he had suffered earlier in the same month. He was 70 years old.

<text>Marion Price Daniel Sr. (October 10, 1910August 25, 1988), was an American jurist and politician who served as a Democratic U.S. Senator and the 38th governor of Texas. He was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to be a member of the National Security Council, Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness, and Assistant to the President for Federal-State Relations. Daniel also served as Associate Justice of the Texas Supreme Court.

==Early life==
Marion Price Daniel Sr (properly Marion Price Daniel II) was born October 10, 1910, in Dayton, Texas, to Marion Price Daniel Sr (1882–1937) and Nannie Blanch Partlow (1886–1955), in Liberty Texas. He was the eldest child. Sister Ellen Virginia Daniel was born in 1912, and brother William Partlow Daniel in 1915. Price, as he was commonly known, was married to Jean Houston Baldwin, great-great-granddaughter of legendary Texas figure Sam Houston. As a teenager Daniel was a reporter for the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;. He put himself through law school at Baylor University by working as a janitor and dishwasher and by working at the &quot;Waco News Tribune&quot;. He received his degree from Baylor in 1932. After graduation he established his own practice in Liberty County and often accepted livestock and acreage for his fees.

==Texas House of Representatives==
In 1938, he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives. He was subsequently re-elected twice, serving in the 46th, 47th, and 48th legislature from January 10, 1939, until January 9, 1945. Daniel opposed Texas adopting a sales tax.

He served on these committees during the 46th legislature (January 10 – June 21, 1939): judiciary; oil, gas, and mining; privileges, suffrage, and elections (vice chair); and public lands and buildings.

He served on these committees during the 47th legislature (January 14 – July 3, 1941, and September 9–19, 1941): judiciary; privileges, suffrage, and elections; public lands and buildings (vice chair); and revenue and taxation.

He was elected as Speaker of the House for the 48th legislature (January 12 – May 11, 1943).

==World War II military service==

When the legislature adjourned in May 1943, Daniel waived his draft exemption and enlisted in the United States Army, serving in the Security Intelligence Corps. In this capacity, he saw service in Amarillo, Texas, Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He received his Second Lieutenant commission in 1944 after training at the Judge Advocate General Officers School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, afterwards becoming an instructor at the Army School for Personnel Services in Lexington, Virginia.

The Army shared Daniel with the United States Marine Corps in 1945, the latter sending him to Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan to set up a Marine Personnel School. He received &quot;outstanding authority&quot; citations from both branches of service, and was discharged in May 1946.

==Texas Attorney General==

Price returned to Texas after his military service and won the seat of Texas Attorney General.

As Texas State Attorney General, he argued the 1946 submerged lands ownership lawsuit &quot;United States v. California, 332 U.S. 19&quot; before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1947, on behalf of the coastal states. The Supreme Court decided against California on June 23, 1947.

Daniel defended the University of Texas law school in the 1950 &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot; desegregation case. Herman Marion Sweatt, a black student, was denied admission to the University of Texas Law School in February 1946. Sweatt had met all the requirements, except that Texas schools were segregated by law. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in June, 1950, Sweatt must be allowed admission.

==United States Senate==

In 1952, Daniel was elected to the United States Senate. He was immediately taken under the wing of Senate Minority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, with the senior senator helping to alleviate office space shortage by allowing Daniel&#x27;s staff to work out of LBJ&#x27;s office.

Daniel held positions on committees of the Interior; Interstate and Foreign Commerce; Post Office and Civil Service; and Judiciary, as well as Judiciary subcommittees on Internal Security and Juvenile Delinquency.

The new senator worked on a narcotics probe and reforming the electoral college.

Opposed to desegregation efforts, Senator Price Daniel joined 19 other senators and 77 members of the United States House of Representatives in signing the 1956 Southern Manifesto, which condemned the 1954 United States Supreme Court decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, and encouraged states to resist implementing it. The Supreme Court&#x27;s 1958 &quot;Cooper v. Aaron&quot; decision held that the states were bound to uphold the previous decision on desegregation.

===Tidelands and 1952 elections===

The most long-lasting accomplishment of Price Daniel was in helping to retain Texas title to the submerged lands, and mineral rights therein, off the coast. The victory has netted billions of dollars for Texas schools. Texas viewed this issue as of primary importance during the 1952 campaign. Eisenhower supported state ownership, while Adlai Stevenson stood in opposition. The state of Texas, including many prominent state Democratic party leaders, went with Eisenhower who won the state of Texas in the election.

The Tidelands controversy was over who owned the rights to of submerged land in the Gulf of Mexico between low tide and the state&#x27;s Gulfward boundary three leagues (10.35 miles) from shore. Texas acquired the rights as a republic, and later reserved the rights when it entered the Union in 1845. The Texas legislature authorized the School Land Board to execute the mineral leases on behalf of the Permanent School Fund.

Among coastal states, the Federal government claimed ownership when oil was discovered on the lands. The first lawsuit, &quot;United States v. California, 332 U.S. 19&quot;, was filed by the Federal government against California in 1946. The attorneys general of all other states filed an amicus curiae brief in opposition. Price Daniel Sr., as Texas State Attorney General, argued the case before the Supreme Court of the United States on March 13–14, 1947, on behalf of all the other states. In 1947, the Supreme Court decided against California on June 23, 1947.

Congress presented a 1952 bill confirming states&#x27; ownership, which was vetoed by President Harry Truman. In that same year, Presidential candidate General Dwight D. Eisenhower stated his belief that the Annexation Agreement of Texas gave the rights to Texas. Candidate Adlai Stevenson announced he would veto any bill out of Congress guaranteeing the rights to Texas. The Texas state Democratic convention passed a resolution urging all its members to vote for Eisenhower.

In 1953, then Senator Price Daniel
 was one of 35 co-sponsors to the Florida Senator Spessard Holland-authored Senate Joint Resolution 13 restoring the right of the submerged lands to the coastal states. Daniel, together with Lyndon Johnson, Spessard Holland and Senate Majority Leader Robert A. Taft worked tirelessly to overcome the 27-day filibuster of the bill, with it passing the Senate 56-35 votes, and approved by the House of Representatives on May 13. President Eisenhower signed the bill into law on May 22, 1953.

==Governor==

Senator Daniel was elected governor in 1956. Thereafter, Daniel&#x27;s chief Democratic rival Ralph Yarborough went on to succeed Daniel after a temporary appointee, William A. Blakley of Dallas, in the Senate in a special election held in 1957.

As governor, Daniel saw legislative fruition of his proposals to reorganize of the State Board of Insurance, passage of an ethics code for lawmakers and other state employees, regulation of lobbyists, an improved structure for state archives, and a long-range water conservation plan.

Daniel was re-elected governor in 1958 by a 7–1 margin over the Republican Edwin S. Mayer (1896–1963), a San Angelo sheep and goats owner who was twice a delegate for Dwight D. Eisenhower at the 1952 and 1956 Republican National Conventions. In 1960, Mayer was the only delegate at the national convention who abstained on the nomination of former U.S. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., of Massachusetts as Richard Nixon&#x27;s running mate.

In 1960, Daniel won renomination over Jack Cox, an oil equipment executive from Houston. Daniel received 1,637,755 votes (72.8 percent) to Republican William M. Steger of Tyler, who obtained 612,963 ballots (27.2 percent).

In 1961, the legislature passed a 2-cent sales tax, which Daniel allowed to become law without his signature so the state would remain solvent. After the passage of the sales tax, Daniel&#x27;s popularity waned, and he failed at his attempt to be elected to a fourth term in 1962. He lost the Democratic nomination to former Navy Secretary John B. Connally Jr.

==Public service in later years==

President Johnson later appointed Daniel to head the Office of Emergency Preparedness. In 1971, Governor Preston Smith named Daniel to the 9-member Texas Supreme Court, filling a vacancy left by the retirement of Clyde E. Smith. He was re-elected twice in 1972 and 1978, and retired at the end of his second term.

After retiring from the Texas Supreme Court, he served as pro-bono legal council for the Alabama-Coushatta Indians. As their counsel, he was instrumental in the 1965 creation of the Texas Commission for Indian Affairs (TCIA), 59th Legislature, House Bill 1096. On April 5, 1967, the Texas Legislature passed House Concurrent Resolution No. 83 recognizing Daniel for his contributions to the tribe and to the creation of the TCIA.

==Personal life==
Marion Price Daniel Sr. is also known as Marion Price Daniel Jr. and as Marion Price Daniel II, because his father, Marion Price Daniel Sr. (1882–1937) was the first generation with the name. Daniel II married the former Jean Houston Baldwin on June 28, 1940. Their son publicly known as Price Daniel Jr. is properly Marion Price Daniel III. The couple also had three other children: Jean Houston Murph, Houston Lee, and John Baldwin.

Governor Daniel died of a stroke on August 25, 1988, and is interred at the family ranch in Liberty County. His wife died December 14, 2002, and is buried with him.

<text>Twyford is a large village and civil parish in the Borough of Wokingham in Berkshire, England. It had a population of 6,618 in the 2011 Census. It is in the Thames Valley and on the A4 between Reading and Maidenhead, close to Henley-on-Thames and Wokingham.

==History==
The village&#x27;s toponym is Anglo-Saxon in origin, and means &quot;double ford&quot;. It is a common name in England. Twyford had two fords over two branches of the River Loddon, on the Old Bath Road to the west of the centre. According to the chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after King Æthelred of Wessex and his brother, the future King Alfred the Great, were defeated by the Vikings at the Battle of Reading in 871, they escaped by a ford over the River Loddon at Twyford which was not known to their pursuers. William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania, who was a well known philanthropist who donated his life savings to Loddon Village Hall, spent the final years of his life in Ruscombe Fields, a property close to Twyford, and is remembered by a residential street named &#x27;Pennfields&#x27;.

Twyford was primarily an agricultural settlement until the coming of the railway in 1838 put it on the Great Western main line to the west and subsequently made it a junction for the Henley Branch Line. However, its position on the Bath Road had always brought activity which was centred on the King&#x27;s Arms, an important coaching inn. The opening of a by-pass in 1929 finally ended the east–west flow of main road traffic through the centre, but Twyford is still on a busy north–south route from Wokingham in the south to Henley-on-Thames in the north. The greatest expansion, however, has taken place since the Second World War, particularly in the last 50 years, with the construction of several estates north and south of the village. 

==Today==
The population of Twyford in the 2011 Census was 6,618. Of this, 20.84% were aged 0–15, while 19.96% were aged 65+, leaving a relatively small working age population compared to the rest of Wokingham Borough. There are 2,611 individual dwellings in the ward of Twyford, the majority of which are detached. In 2011, 72.31% of residents aged 16–74 were in employment, the majority of whom held Managerial, Professional or Technical positions. Only 0.5% were registered as actively seeking employment.

The average life expectancy at birth is 80.1 years for males and 84.7 years for females. Twyford is also home to the global headquarters of the international construction and services company, Interserve, which employs 75,000 people worldwide. Twyford is also a place of great community spirit and has many annual events. Popular in recent years have been the annual Twyford Beer Festival, and Twyfest, which is a week long festival of different events from live music, school discos, quiz nights and talent shows.

==Government==
Twyford has its own parish council, and is also in the Borough of Wokingham, and the ceremonial county of Berkshire. Before this it was in Wokingham Rural District and the hundred of Charlton. Until 1895 Twyford was part of the parish of Hurst in the liberty of Broad Hinton. From the 13th century until 1844 Broad Hinton was a detached part of Wiltshire.

===Twinning===
Twyford was twinned with Cuincy in northern France in a ceremony over the weekend of 23–25 March 2018. This is thanks to the local people in Twyford

==Transport==
Twyford is situated in the Thames Valley. The town of Reading is to the west, with Maidenhead to the east, Henley-on-Thames to the north, and Wokingham to the south. London is to the east. Twyford railway station is on the Great Western Main Line and the Elizabeth line, the station is served by trains between and stations. There is also a branch line to . The Great Western Main Line has been electrified and Twyford has been served by a new fleet of electric trains since the start of 2018. These links make Twyford very popular with commuters. A direct rail link to Heathrow Airport is also being planned.

==Amenities==
Twyford has two recreation grounds, both owned and managed by the parish council. The King George V Playing Field, between London Road and Wargrave Road has football pitches, three tennis courts, children&#x27;s playgrounds, a youth shelter and is where the yearly fireworks are held by Twyford Round Table. A skate park and ball court in the field was completed in July 2008. Stanlake Meadow, off Waltham Road, has football pitches, a cricket square used by Twyford &amp; Ruscombe Cricket Club and a pavilion which is also used as a nursery school. Twyford also has a youth football club called Twyford Comets which plays on both recreation grounds. Indoor sports clubs use the parish hall, Loddon Hall. This is a joint facility with the neighbouring parish of Ruscombe. Twyford has a tennis club, a cricket club and a bowls club with its own green, and claims to have the oldest badminton club in the country.

In 2015, the Cycle Chilterns project created a cycling guide to Twyford town and the surrounding area with cycling information and facilities, places to visit and a variety of cycle routes. The Twyford Cycling Guide can be downloaded and printed out from the website. Twyford has a number of schools and is also served by grammar schools in Reading. One of the oldest pubs in Berkshire is located in Twyford. The Duke of Wellington was built around 1450, and early records indicate it has been in use as a public house since the early 17th century. It would then have had a different name as there were no Dukes of Wellington before the nineteenth century. Loddon Nature Reserve, under the management of the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust, is on the edge of the village.

<text>The Ottawa Civic Hospital is one of three main campuses of The Ottawa Hospital – along with the General and Riverside campuses. With 549 beds (including the Heart Institute), the Civic Campus has the region&#x27;s only adult-care trauma centre, serving Eastern Ontario, the Outaouais region of Quebec and eastern Nunavut. The Civic Campus also houses the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, which provides cardiac care for patients at The Ottawa Hospital. The Civic Campus opened in 1924 and is located at 1053 Carling Avenue in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

== History ==
The hospital was championed largely by Harold Fisher following the 1918 flu pandemic. While the facility is today located in an urban location, Fisher faced ridicule at the time for advocating for a location in the then-countryside and the project was branded by some as &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Folly&quot;.
* 1924 – The Ottawa Civic Hospital opened with 550 beds. It was built to replace three aging hospitals: the Carleton County Protestant General Hospital on Rideau Street (now Wallis House), which dated from the 1870s, as well as Ottawa Maternity and St. Luke&#x27;s hospitals. In 1921, the construction of the Civic hospital was estimated to cost $1,500,000.
* 1929 – The Depression increased the number of patients who couldn&#x27;t pay for care and major outbreaks of scarlet fever, diphtheria and tuberculosis affected health-care workers.
* 1930 – A staff immunization program reduced the severity of the outbreaks.
* January 19, 1943 – During World War II, when Canada provided refuge to the Dutch royal family, then-Princess Juliana gave birth to her daughter Princess Margriet in Ottawa at the Ottawa Civic Hospital. The hospital&#x27;s maternity ward was temporarily declared to be extraterritorial so that Margriet would inherit only Dutch citizenship from her mother.
* 1950s – A number of expansions maintained the Civic&#x27;s position at the forefront of medicine in Ottawa.
* 1966 – The first successful kidney transplant in Ottawa was performed.
* 1976 – The University of Ottawa Heart Institute opened. The Heart Institute is Canada&#x27;s largest and foremost heart health centre dedicated to understanding, treating and preventing heart disease. It is Canada&#x27;s only complete cardiac centre.
* 1982 – The Rich Little Special Care Nursery opened. The nursery provides enhanced level II care for premature infants and for term infants with health problems.
* 1988 – The Loeb Research Institute opened.
* April 1, 1998 – The Civic, General and Riverside hospitals amalgamated to form The Ottawa Hospital.
* 2006 – A expansion to the Civic Campus Emergency Department was completed.
* 2013 – The Ontario Government announced a $200-million expansion of the Heart Institute.
* 2016 – The Sir John Carling Building site was selected as the future home of the new Civic Campus, with expected completion in 10 years.

== Services and programs ==
The Civic Campus is the region&#x27;s only adult-care trauma centre, treating the most critical health needs. It is the regional centre for cardiac and stroke care, treating patients from eastern Ontario, western Quebec and eastern Nunavut. Between April 2013 and March 2016, the Civic Campus had 6,595 visits from Nunavut patients. The University of Ottawa Skills and Simulation Centre – the largest centre in Canada and one of the largest in North America – is also located at the Civic Campus. The Regional Geriatric Program of Eastern Ontario, Breast Health Centre and Bariatric Centre of Excellence are all based at the Civic Campus.

<text>Carnival is a dance music EP by British band Duran Duran, originally released in various markets around the world in September 1982 by EMI.

==Background==
As part of Capitol&#x27;s shift in marketing strategy for Duran Duran to develop into a dance band over the course of 1982 (in a bid to ship more units of the &quot;Rio&quot; album), it was decided to release an EP of remixed tracks in various territories globally to capitalise on increased night-club play and to try to replicate that success on radio.

Part of this strategy also involved producer David Kershenbaum remixing various &quot;Rio&quot; tracks. Most of these remixes also appeared on the &quot;Carnival&quot; release as well as various twelve-inch singles.

The demand for Duran Duran material during the autumn of 1982 was quite high. DJs who heard the new mixes could not get enough, and started to put the dance mixes on the air. During the week of 2 October, the US version of the &quot;Carnival&quot; EP actually entered the album charts at #98. It was gone by the following week.

The success of the &quot;Carnival&quot; EP gave the band enough clout to bring Kershenbaum back in to remix the entire A-side of the &quot;Rio&quot; album, which was duly released in the US in November 1982.

==The songs and releases==
Because &quot;Carnival&quot; was meant to capitalise on Duran Duran&#x27;s burgeoning dance-oriented success, the track listing around the world differed from region to region.

===Dutch and Spanish EP===
The Dutch EP, released in a white sleeve with photos taken from the &quot;Rio&quot; tour book, featured twelve-inch versions – or &quot;Night Versions&quot; in early Duran Duran parlance – lifted from four of the band&#x27;s more popular singles – &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;, &quot;Rio&quot;, &quot;Planet Earth&quot; and &quot;Girls on Film&quot;. A rare misprint of the Dutch sleeve is existing, stating &quot;Hold Back the Rain&quot; to be included instead of &quot;Planet Earth&quot;.

The Night version of &quot;Girls on Film&quot; is actually slightly different from the version that appeared on the EMI twelve-inch single, clocking in at just around 15 seconds longer. Also, the David Kershenbaum Night version mix of &quot;Rio&quot; was commercially exclusive to this EP (it also featured on an American promo twelve-inch), as the &quot;Rio&quot; twelve-inch single featured &quot;Rio (Pt II)&quot; as the lead mix.

The Spanish EP featured, on the sleeve at least, the same running order as the Dutch EP. Closer inspection however, shows that the version of &quot;Rio&quot; is actually just the album version, although it&#x27;s listed as the Night version. The song titles on the Spanish release were all translated into Spanish.

===Canada and US===
For the Canada and US releases the track listing changed slightly, incorporating among other things, a new Kershenbaum mix of minor single &quot;My Own Way&quot; which featured additional lyrics left off the original album version as well as the &#x27;rhythm section punched up, making it ideal for dancing&#x27;. This mix eventually resurfaced on the Kershenbaum version of the &quot;Rio&quot; album in November 1982.

The EP also featured an extended version of album track &quot;Hold Back the Rain&quot; remixed by David Kershenbaum, which is quite similar to the version on the B-side of the &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; twelve-inch single. However the guitars are more prominent on the EP mix, and the keyboard and bass are quieter in some places. This mix also featured on the Japanese &quot;Carnival&quot; EP.

The US and Canada track listings are rounded out by Night versions of singles &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Girls on Film&quot;, lifted directly from their respective twelve-inches. Looks-wise, the EP was similar to the Dutch release but came in a purple sleeve, instead of white.

===Japan/Taiwan===
The Japanese/Taiwanese release of &quot;Carnival&quot; included among the increasingly easy to acquire versions of previous singles a remix exclusive to this release of fan-favourite album track &quot;New Religion&quot;. This mainly instrumental mix remained unavailable outside Japan/Taiwan until the 1999 release of the &quot;Strange Behaviour&quot; remix album.

The remainder of the EP was filled with the 5:02 Full 7&quot; mix of &quot;Rio&quot;, (mislabelled as the 5:31 &quot;Rio (Pt II) version&quot; as the wrong master was delivered to the Toshiba-EMI offices in Tokyo), the Kershenbaum remix of &quot;Hold Back the Rain&quot;, and Night versions of &quot;My Own Way&quot; and &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;.

The Japanese EP was the only version of &quot;Carnival&quot; to receive a CD release. On 31 May 1991, Toshiba/EMI compiled the four Japanese EPs – &quot;Nite Romantics&quot;, &quot;Carnival&quot;, &quot;Tiger Tiger&quot;, and &quot;Strange Behaviour&quot; onto a rare and highly sought-after double-CD set (TOCP-6707/8).

<doc id="1009178" wikidata="Q7831319" url="?curid=1009178" title="Tracheoesophageal fistula">
<text>A tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF, or TOF; see spelling differences) is an abnormal connection (fistula) between the esophagus and the trachea. TEF is a common congenital abnormality, but when occurring late in life is usually the sequela of surgical procedures such as a laryngectomy.

==Presentation==

Tracheoesophageal fistula is suggested in a newborn by copious salivation associated with choking, coughing, vomiting, and cyanosis coincident with the onset of feeding. Esophageal atresia and the subsequent inability to swallow typically cause polyhydramnios in utero. Rarely it may present in an adult.

===Complications===
Surgical repair can sometimes result in complications, including:
* Stricture, due to gastric acid erosion of the shortened esophagus
* Leak of contents at the point of anastomosis
* Recurrence of fistula
* Gastro-esophageal reflux disease
* Dysphagia
* Asthma-like symptoms, such as persistent coughing/wheezing
* Recurrent chest infections
* Tracheomalacia

===Associations===

Neonates with TEF or esophageal atresia are unable to feed properly. Once diagnosed, prompt surgery is required to allow the food intake. Some children experience problems following TEF surgery; they can develop dysphagia and thoracic problems. Children with TEF can also be born with other abnormalities, most commonly those described in VACTERL association - a group of anomalies which often occur together, including heart, kidney and limb deformities. 6% of babies with TEF also have a laryngeal cleft.

==Cause==
Congenital TEF can arise due to failed fusion of the tracheoesophageal ridges after the fourth week of embryological development.

A fistula, from the Latin meaning &#x27;a pipe&#x27;, is an abnormal connection running either between two tubes or between a tube and a surface. In tracheo-esophageal fistula it runs between the trachea and the esophagus. This connection may or may not have a central cavity; if it does, then food within the esophagus may pass into the trachea (and on to the lungs) or alternatively, air in the trachea may cross into the esophagus.

TEF can also occur due to pressure necrosis by a tracheostomy tube in apposition to a nasogastric tube (NGT).

==Diagnosis==
TEF should be suspected once the baby fails to swallow after their first feeding during the first day of life. Esophageal atresia can be diagnosed by Ryle nasogastric tube; if the Ryle fails to pass into the stomach, then this indicates esophageal atresia and loss of communication between stomach and esophagus. TEF may be diagnosed by MRI which clarifies the atretic esophagus (if presents) and TEF, as well as its location and anatomy. Gastrograffin contrast swallow should not be used if TEF is suspected, due to its high risk of allergy and severe intractable chest infection.

===Classification===
Fistulae between the trachea and esophagus in the newborn can be of diverse morphology and anatomical location. However, various pediatric surgical publications have attempted a classification system based on the below specified types.

Not all types include both esophageal agenesis and tracheoesophageal fistula, but the most common types do.

The letter codes are usually associated with the system used by Gross, while number codes are usually associated with Vogt.

An additional type, &quot;blind upper segment only&quot; has been described, but this type is not usually included in most classifications. (For the purposes of this discussion, &quot;proximal esophagus&quot; indicates normal esophageal tissue arising normally from the pharynx, and &quot;distal esophagus&quot; indicates normal esophageal tissue emptying into the proximal stomach.)

==Treatment==
It is surgically corrected, with resection of any fistula and anastomosis of any discontinuous segments. Babies often need to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit for feeding with a stomach feeding tube. Antibiotics, pain relief, a chest drain, oxygen, and ventilation may all be needed.

<text>Paul Arthur Garon (July 6, 1942 – July 26, 2022) was an American author, writer, and editor, noted for his meditations on surrealist works, and also a noted scholar on blues as a musical and cultural movement. 

Born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of a doctor and a sociology graduate, Garon settled in Chicago and was one of the founders of the Chicago Surrealist Group in the mid-1960s.

Garon was one of the founding editors of &quot;Living Blues&quot; magazine in 1970. He once wrote that &quot;blues represents a fusion of music and poetry accomplished at a very high emotional temperature&quot;. Amongst his other publications, Garon was the biographer of Peetie Wheatstraw. Later, Garon and his wife Beth operated Beasley Books together, a rare book business in Chicago. He was also a founding partner of the Chicago Rare Book Center, in Evanston, Illinois.

Garon died on July 26, 2022, at the age of 80.

<text>The Montalvo Arts Center is a non-profit center for the arts in Saratoga, California, United States. Open to the public, Montalvo comprises a cultural and arts center, a park, hiking trails and the historic Villa Montalvo, an Italian Mediterranean Revival mansion nestled in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The mansion and estate were constructed from 1912 to 1914 by California statesman and businessman James Duval Phelan. After Phelan&#x27;s death, the entire estate was donated to California as a park and then a cultural and arts center as it exists today. The arts center maintains the estate in partnership with Santa Clara County. The mansion is a historic landmark, and in 1978 it was awarded inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.

== Mansion and grounds ==

The grounds of the villa now encompass , more than the original purchased by Phelan. The estate boasts several large structures as well as gardens and untouched natural areas. Montalvo includes two theaters, an art gallery, the historic Villa Montalvo, an artist residency complex called The Sally and Don Lucas Artists Residency Program, hiking trails and gardens.

The mansion itself boasts 19 rooms and two stories. The first floor of the mansion used to host art exhibits, but is now open only for the many weddings and other occasions that are held there.

The grounds include several gardens embellished with marble sculptures and garden structures. The Front Lawn is sometimes used as a theater for some of Montalvo&#x27;s dramatic presentations, and the woods behind are open to the public. Since its bequest to the people of California, hiking trails through the surrounding Redwood-speckled hills have been added.

== History ==
In 1911, James D. Phelan, a three-term mayor of San Francisco who would go on to be California&#x27;s first popularly elected US Senator, purchased in the Saratoga countryside and foothills.

Phelan began construction of the mansion in 1912. The initial supervising architect was William Curlett. When he died in 1914, his son, Alex Curlett, took over supervision along with partner Charles E. Gottschalk. The construction of the building was completed that same year.

During his lifetime, Phelan hosted many celebrities and notables of the era as guests at Montalvo. Jack London, Ethel Barrymore, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and Edwin Markham were among Phelan&#x27;s many guests. Though not his only home, Villa Montalvo was one of Phelan&#x27;s favorites and is where he died. Some photographs, correspondence, and other mementos of his life are displayed in cases in the mansion&#x27;s library and can be viewed if one happens to be attending an event for which the mansion is open.

Upon his death, Phelan bequeathed Montalvo thus:


The San Francisco Art Association (SFAA) assumed trusteeship of the estate in 1930. Within a year the association announced the intention to launch an artist residency program, the third program of its kind in the United States. The program began in 1939 with ten artists in residence. In 2004 it became the Montalvo Art Center&#x27;s Sally and Don Lucas Artists Residency Program with 10 newly designed discipline specific live/work studios and a commons building.

After World War II, a shift in priorities for the SFAA left many people concerned about the future of Villa Montalvo. These citizens together formed the Montalvo Association. Trusteeship was transferred to the organization in October 1953. In 2024, the organization website uses the name Montalvo Arts Center.

On April 11, 1971, serial killer Karl F. Warner murdered his third and final victim, Kathy Bilek, 18, on the grounds of Villa Montalvo. It was the investigation into the Bilek slaying which led to his arrest and conviction for his string of three slayings of teenage girls throughout the southern Santa Clara Valley.

== Montalvo Association ==
Today, the Montalvo Arts Center is a private non-profit cultural center maintained by the Montalvo Association through a partnership with Santa Clara County. The park and arts center are open to the public. Funding support is provided by the Friends of Montalvo memberships, as well as foundation grants, other private donations, and earned income via ticket sales and rental fees. More than 600 volunteers donate thousands of hours annually to support the arts programs and maintenance of the villa and grounds.

Since 1939, the estate has hosted &quot;artists-in-residence&quot; who live and work on the property. Artists range from musicians, painters, actors, writers and architects. While in residence, the participants produce works and give performances. Since Montalvo started its artists-in-residence program, more than 600 artists from 20 countries have participated, including Karla Diaz. In 2003 the residency program&#x27;s board found Gordon Knox, who had initiated and run a remarkable arts residency for 11 years, the Civitella Ranieri Foundation at a castle in Umbria, Italy. Knox envisioned and established a new international iteration of the Montalvo artist residency program designed for a new purpose-built residency campus. In the fall of 2004, Montalvo opened the Sally and Don Lucas Artists Programs, which offer facilities and staff that are supportive of the creative process as well as state-of-the-art technology.

A small gallery, called the Project Space Gallery, as well as the box office, are located in the building between the mansion and the Carriage House Theatre. Montalvo and its arts programs serve nearly 200,000 visitors each year.

== Arboretum ==

Still called &quot;Villa Montalvo&quot; by local area residents, the Montalvo Arts Center hosts a arboretum and botanical garden, located behind the center. It is free and open to the public during daylight hours and run as part of a non-profit organization for art, artists, and the local community.

The arboretum is adjacent to the villa and is an Audubon Society bird sanctuary. There are dirt paths leading out of a redwood canyon to Lookout Point at altitude . A number of forest types are represented, including chaparral, evergreen, and redwood. Trees native to the Santa Cruz Mountains include bay, California nutmeg, Douglas fir, big-leaf maple, tanoak, and coast live oak. Other plants common in the area are broom, mountain mahogany, chamise, coyote brush (&quot;Baccharis pilularis&quot;), madrone, manzanita, monkey flower, pitcher sage, poison oak, and toyon.

== Name ==

Phelan named Villa Montalvo in honor of the popular 16th-century Spanish writer Garci Ordonez de Montalvo. Montalvo coined the name &quot;California&quot; in one of his fables. In it he described an island rich with gold and jewels, peopled by Amazons ruled by a queen named Calafia. The Amazons in the fable employed griffins in battle. Images of griffins can be found throughout the arts center grounds, &quot;standing guard&quot;.

<text>Cilaos () is a town and commune on the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean. It is located centrally on the island, in a caldera of altitude 1,214 m. The caldera (usually known as the &#x27;Cirque&#x27;) is also named for the community.

==History==
The name &quot;Cilaos&quot; comes from the Malagasy word, &quot;Tsilaosa&quot; (modern form : &quot;tsy ilaozana&quot;), which means &quot;the place one does not abandon&quot;.

According to some historians , the word &quot;Cilaos&quot; finds its origins in the name of a Malagasy slave named &quot;Tsilaos&quot; who took refuge in this cirque. At the time, slaves were called &quot;brown&quot;, whereas runaway slaves were called &quot;black-brown&quot;.

The first inhabitants of the cirque of Cilaos were thus &quot;black-browns&quot; who believed themselves to be at the top of the world and completely safe. However, these first runaways were recaptured very quickly, tracked and hunted by well-organized and well-armed slaveholders. In these runaways&#x27; attempts to escape recapture, several were killed. It seems likely that these first runaways created the goat paths that climb most of the mountains on Réunion.

After the death or recapture of these runaway slaves, the cirque of Cilaos likely became uninhabited once again for a while, since the first official record of its settlement occurs only around 1850. In this year, a spa station was set up, and by 1866, there were 960 inhabitants. By 1900, the population had risen to 2500, and the 1982 census recorded 5629 inhabitants in the whole cirque.

From 7 to 8 January 1966, 1,825mm (72 inches) of rain fell in Cilaos in 24 hours, the greatest amount of rain ever to fall in one day. 

The commune of Cilaos was created on 4 February 1965 when it seceded from the commune of Saint-Louis.

==Population==
==Embroidery==

The introduction of embroidery was due to the efforts of Angèle MacAuliffe, daughter of a doctor who worked at a hot-spring clinic in the early 20th century. The techniques that she introduced have scarcely changed since, and the popularity of &quot;Days of Cilaos&quot; embroidery is due in a large part to this stability and tradition.

This local embroidery has been transmitted for over 100 years by local nuns (such as Sister Cécile and Sister Irénée). In 1954, the &quot;Sewing room of Cilaos&quot; was created and Sister Anasthasie (Marie-Hélène Techer) was appointed as its leader. Sister Anasthasie would do her utmost to teach a hundred young girls her embroidery techniques, and she was recognized in 1983 when she received the gold medal &quot;Best worker in France&quot; competition in the lace and embroidery category. In the 1980s, these embroidered works were generally sold out of the workers&#x27; homes or more frequently from roadside stands. Furthermore, an association for the promotion of Cilaosian lace was created in 1983 to protect and develop this important craft of the Cirque. In 1985, this association had 50 embroidery workers. Its president was Ms. Suzanne Maillot, Sister Anasthasie&#x27;s assistant at the &quot;Sewing-room of Cilaos&quot;.

Today, an embroidery house of the association lets a few workers learn and show tourists this delicate art.

==Climate==

Cilaos has a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;), with a mild to warm, very rainy wet season from December to April, and a drier, mild season the rest of the year.

<doc id="1009191" wikidata="Q562179" url="?curid=1009191" title="Harkishan Singh Surjeet">
<text>Harkishan Singh Surjeet (23 March 1916 – 1 August 2008) was an Indian Communist politician from Punjab, who served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) from 1992 to 2005 and was a member of the party&#x27;s Polit Bureau from 1964 to 2008.

==Early life and pre-1947 career==
Harkishan Singh Surjeet was born in 1916 in a Jat Sikh family in the village of Bundala, Jalandhar district of Punjab. He started his political career in the national liberation movement in his early teens, as a follower of the revolutionary socialist Bhagat Singh and in 1930 joined his Naujawan Bharat Sabha. In 1936, Surjeet joined the Communist Party of India. He was a co-founder of the Kisan Sabha (Farmer&#x27;s Union) in Punjab. In the pre-war years he started publishing &quot;Dukhi Duniya&quot; and &quot;Chingari&quot;. During the War, Surjeet was imprisoned by the colonial authorities. When India became independent and partitioned in 1947, Surjeet was the Secretary of CPI in Punjab. Although he sported a Sikh turban, throughout his life, Surjeet remained an atheist.

==Role in the Communist Party==
The seven and a half decades-long political life of Harkishan Singh Surjeet began with his staunch fight against British colonial rule. He played a pioneering role in developing the farmer&#x27;s movement and the Communist Party in Punjab before emerging as a national leader of the Communist Party of India and the All India Kisan Sabha. It culminated with his leading role in the CPI(M) for an eventful four decades.

Surjeet began his revolutionary career influenced by the martyrdom of Bhagat Singh. He hoisted the tricolour in March 1932 at the district court in Hoshiarpur at the age of 16. He was arrested and sent to a reformatory school for juvenile offenders. He came in touch with the early Communist pioneers in Punjab after his release. He joined the Communist Party in 1934 and became a member of the Congress Socialist Party in 1935. He was elected as the secretary of the Punjab State Kisan Sabha in 1938. The same year, he was externed from Punjab and went to Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh where he started a monthly paper, &#x27;Chingari&#x27;. He went underground after the outbreak of the second world war and was arrested in 1940. He was imprisoned in the notorious Lahore Red Fort where he was kept for three months in solitary confinement in terrible conditions. Later he was shifted to Deoli detention camp where he remained till 1944. During the partition, he tirelessly worked for communal harmony in violence-torn Punjab.

Just after independence, Surjeet was forced to go underground for four years. Several other communist leaders like A K Gopalan were arrested under the preventive detention laws. In the 1950s he led the historic anti-betterment levy movement in Punjab in 1959. His work with farmers led to his election as General Secretary and then President of the All India Kisan Sabha. He also worked in the Agricultural Workers Union. When the CPI split in 1964, Surjeet sided with the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Surjeet was one of the nine members of the original CPI(M) Polit Bureau.

==General Secretary==
He continued to rise within the party until he was elected General Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPI(M) in 1992, a post he held till 2005, retiring at the age of 89. Surjeet is known for his steadfast opposition to the BJP and communalism. He was instrumental in forming a number of anti-BJP coalitions in the 1990s and for ensuring left support the present UPA government. After retiring from his post as General Secretary, Surjeet continued to play an active role in Indian national politics. Many times, including after the 2004 Lok Sabha election and during the 1996-1998 United Front government, his role has been that of a cunning king-maker in parliamentary politics, mending and assembling broad coalitions.
With his health declining, Surjeet was, for the first time, not included in the CPI(M) Politburo at the party&#x27;s 19th congress in early April 2008. He was instead designated as Special Invitee to the Central Committee. Surjeet died in New Delhi on 1 August 2008 of cardiac arrest. Surjeet, aged 92, had been convalescing at the Metro Hospital in Noida since 25 July 2008.

===Lok Sabha Election Results under leadership of Surjeet===

==Role in Rajya Sabha and Punjab Legislative Assembly==
Surjeet was member of the Punjab Legislative Assembly from 1954 to 1959. In 1967, he was elected to the Punjab legislative assembly for the CPI (M) and served till 1972. He was elected as a member of Rajya Sabha in the Indian parliament on 10 April 1978 and served till 9 April 1984.

==Novel==
A literary work in Punjab titled &quot;Bhauu&quot;, which has uncanny resemblance to the life of Surjeet was written by Darshan Singh, a close associate of Surjeet. The novel remained unknown till it was printed by the mainstream media. The newspaper article sparked a flurry of coverage and it was then reported by most Indian newspapers. Though the author Darshan Singh claimed that the novel was not based on the life of Surjeet, he termed his novel &quot;virtual reality&quot;. He did say that &quot;novels have been written about American presidents without naming them&quot;. The main character is named Karam Singh Kirti, with Kirti meaning a worker in Punjabi - a term often used by the left wing in Punjab. The Communist Part of India (Marxist), with which Surjeet was affiliated, was unhappy at the description of Surjeet in the novel.

<doc id="1009199" wikidata="Q1072909" url="?curid=1009199" title="Callus (cell biology)">
<text>Plant callus (plural &quot;calluses&quot; or &quot;calli&quot;) is a growing mass of unorganized plant parenchyma cells. In living plants, callus cells are those cells that cover a plant wound. In biological research and biotechnology callus formation is induced from plant tissue samples (explants) after surface sterilization and plating onto tissue culture medium in vitro (in a closed culture vessel such as a Petri dish). The culture medium is supplemented with plant growth regulators, such as auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellin, to initiate callus formation or somatic embryogenesis. Callus initiation has been described for all major groups of land plants. 

== Callus induction and tissue culture ==

Plant species representing all major land plant groups have been shown to be capable of producing callus in tissue culture. A callus cell culture is usually sustained on gel medium. Callus induction medium consists of agar and a mixture of macronutrients and micronutrients for the given cell type. There are several types of basal salt mixtures used in plant tissue culture, but most notably modified Murashige and Skoog medium, White&#x27;s medium, and woody plant medium. Vitamins, such as Gamborg B5 vitamins, are also provided to enhance growth. For plant cells, enrichment with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is especially important. Plant callus is usually derived from somatic tissues. The tissues used to initiate callus formation depends on the plant species and which tissues are available for explant culture. The cells that give rise to callus and somatic embryos usually undergo rapid division or are partially undifferentiated such as meristematic tissue. In alfalfa (&quot;Medicago truncatula&quot;), however, callus and somatic embryos are derived from mesophyll cells that undergo dedifferentiation. Plant hormones are used to initiate callus growth. After the callus has formed, the concentration of hormones in the medium may be altered to shift the development from callus to root formation, shoot growth, or somatic embryogenesis. The callus tissue then undergoes further cell growth and differentiation, forming the respective organ primordia. The fully developed organs can then be used for the regeneration of new mature plants. 
== Morphology ==
Specific auxin-to-cytokinin ratios in plant tissue culture medium give rise to an unorganized growing and dividing mass of callus cells. Callus cultures are often broadly classified as being either compact or friable. Compact calli are typically green and sturdy, while friable calli are white to creamy yellow in color, fall apart easily, and can be used to generate cell suspension cultures and somatic embryos. In maize, these two callus types are designated as type I (compact) and type II (friable). Callus can directly undergo direct organogenesis and/or embryogenesis where the cells will form an entirely new plant.

== Callus cell death ==
Callus can brown and die during culture, mainly due to the oxidation of phenolic compounds. In &quot;Jatropha curcas&quot; callus cells, small organized callus cells became disorganized and varied in size after browning occurred. Browning has also been associated with oxidation and phenolic compounds in both explant tissues and explant secretions. In rice, presumably, a condition which is favorable for scutellar callus induction also induces necrosis.

==Uses==
Callus cells are not necessarily genetically homogeneous because a callus is often made from structural tissue, not individual cells. Nevertheless, callus cells are often considered similar enough for standard scientific analysis to be performed as if on a single subject. For example, an experiment may have half a callus undergo a treatment as the experimental group, while the other half undergoes a similar but non-active treatment as the control group.

Plant calluses derived from many different cell types can differentiate into a whole plant, a process called regeneration, through addition of plant hormones to the culture medium. This ability is known as totipotency. A classical experiment by Folke Skoog and Carlos O. Miller on tobacco pith used as the starting explant shows that the supplementation of culture media by different ratios of auxin to cytokinin concentration induces the formation of roots – with higher auxin to cytokinin ratio, the rooting (rhizogenesis) is induced, applying equal amounts of both hormones stimulates further callus growth and increasing the auxin to cytokinin ratio in favor of the cytokinin leads to the development of shoots. Regeneration of a whole plant from a single cell allows transgenics researchers to obtain whole plants which have a copy of the transgene in every cell. Regeneration of a whole plant that has some genetically transformed cells and some untransformed cells yields a chimera. In general, chimeras are not useful for genetic research or agricultural applications.

Genes can be inserted into callus cells using biolistic bombardment, also known as a gene gun, or &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;. Cells that receive the gene of interest can then be recovered into whole plants using a combination of plant hormones. The whole plants that are recovered can be used to experimentally determine gene function(s), or to enhance crop plant traits for modern agriculture.

Callus is of particular use in micropropagation where it can be used to grow genetically identical copies of plants with desirable characteristics. To increase the yield, efficiency and explant survivability of micropropagation, a thorough care is taken for the optimization of the micropropagation protocol. For example, using explants composed of low totipotency cells may prolong the time necessary to obtain callus of sufficient size, increasing the total length of the experiment. Similarly, various plant species and explant types require specific plant hormones for callus induction and subsequent organogenesis or embryogenesis – for the formation and growth of maize calluses, auxin 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was superior to 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) or Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), while the development of callus was hindered in prune explants after applying auxin Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) but not IAA.

==History==
Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau investigated wound-healing responses in elm trees, and was the first to report formation of callus on live plants.

In 1908, E. F. Simon was able to induce callus from poplar stems that also produced roots and buds. The first reports of callus induction &quot;in vitro&quot; came from three independent researchers in 1939. P. White induced callus derived from tumor-developing procambial tissues of hybrid &quot;Nicotiana glauca&quot; that did not require hormone supplementation. Gautheret and Nobecourt were able to maintain callus cultures of carrot using auxin hormone additions.
