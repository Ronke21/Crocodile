<text>Father Knows Best is an American sitcom starring Robert Young, Jane Wyatt, Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray and Lauren Chapin. The series, which began on radio in 1949, aired as a television show for six seasons and 203 episodes. Created by Ed James, &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; follows the lives of the Andersons, a middle-class family living in the town of Springfield. The state in which Springfield is located is never specified, but it is generally accepted to be located in the Midwestern United States.

The television series debuted on CBS in October 1954. It ran for one season and was canceled by CBS but picked up by NBC, where it remained for three seasons. After cancellation by NBC in 1958, the series returned to CBS, where it aired until May 1960.

==Radio==

The series began on August 25, 1949, on NBC Radio. Set in the Midwest, it starred Robert Young as the General Insurance agent Jim Anderson. His wife Margaret was first portrayed by June Whitley and later by Jean Vander Pyl. The Anderson children were Betty (Rhoda Williams), Bud (Ted Donaldson) and Kathy (Norma Jean Nilsson). Others in the cast were Eleanor Audley, Herb Vigran, and Sam Edwards. Sponsored through most of its run by General Foods, the series was heard Thursday evenings on NBC until March 25, 1954.

On the radio program, the character of Jim differs from the later television character. The radio Jim is far more sarcastic and shows he really rules over his family. Jim also calls his children names, something common on radio but lost in the TV series. For example, Jim says, &quot;What a bunch of stupid children I have.&quot; Margaret is portrayed as a paragon of solid reason and patience, unless the plot calls for her to act a bit off; for example, in a Halloween episode, Margaret cannot understand how a table floats in the air. But that is a rare exception.

Betty, on radio, is portrayed as a status-seeking, boy-crazy teenage girl. To her, every little thing is &quot;the worst thing that could ever happen.&quot; Bud, on radio, is portrayed as an &quot;all-American&quot; boy who always seems to need &quot;just a bit more&quot; money, though he receives $1.25 (nearly $16.50 in 2025) per week in allowance. Bud is expected to always answer the phone, which he hates. He is also shown as a somewhat dim boy who takes everything literally; for example, Jim might say, &quot;Go jump in the lake,&quot; to which Bud would reply, &quot;Okay, Dad; which lake should I go jump into?&quot; He also uses the phrase &quot;Holy Cow!&quot; to express displeasure. On radio, Kathy often is portrayed as a source of irritation. She whines, cries and complains about her status in the family. She often is a source of money for her brother and sister, although she is in hock several years on her own allowance.

In an interview published in the magazine &quot;Films of the Golden Age&quot; (Fall 2015), Young revealed about the radio program: &quot;I never quite liked it because it had to have laughs. And I wanted a warm relationship show ... When we moved to TV I suggested an entirely new cast and different perspective.&quot;

==Television series==
The May 27, 1954, episode of &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot; show was called &quot;Keep It in the Family.&quot; This 26-minute episode stars Robert Young as Jim Warren, head of the Warren family. With him was wife Grace (Ellen Drew), older daughter Peggy (Sally Fraser), younger daughter Patty (Tina Thompson) and son Jeff (Gordon Gebert). Developed by Young and his partner Eugene Rodney, it was intended as a pilot for a &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; television series. In the episode, Peggy dreams of making it as an actress, but a talent scout who has raised her hopes just wants people for his acting school.

Of the radio cast, only Robert Young remained when the series moved to CBS television:
* James &quot;Jim&quot; Anderson Sr.: Robert Young
* Margaret Anderson: Jane Wyatt
* Betty &quot;Princess&quot; Anderson: Elinor Donahue
* James &quot;Bud&quot; Anderson Jr.: Billy Gray
* Kathy &quot;Kitten&quot; Anderson: Lauren Chapin

The series premiered on October 3, 1954, on CBS, where it aired Sundays at 10 p.m. (ET). Lorillard&#x27;s Kent cigarettes sponsored the show in its first season. After 13 episodes the sponsor decided not to renew it when its 26-week run ended. An article in the trade publication &quot;Billboard&quot; noted the program&#x27;s cost (approximately $30,000 per week), the weakness of &quot;Honestly, Celeste!&quot; (its lead-in for most of the first 13 weeks), and reduction of sales of cigarettes because of a cancer scare.

Scott Paper Company became the primary sponsor when the series moved to NBC in the fall of 1955, where it aired Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m. (ET) for the next three seasons. Scott Paper remained as sponsor even after the show returned to CBS in September 1958, where it aired Mondays at 8:30 p.m. (ET) for the last two seasons, with Lever Brothers as an alternate sponsor from 1957 through 1960. A total of 203 episodes were produced, running until September 17, 1960, and appearing on all three of the television networks of the time, including prime-time repeats from September 1960 through April 1963.

As before, the character of Margaret was portrayed as a voice of reason, and Jim&#x27;s character was that of a thoughtful father who offered sage advice in response to his children&#x27;s problems. A responsible man, he loved his wife and children and would do whatever he could to give them a better life. Jim was a salesman and manager of the General Insurance Company in Springfield, while Margaret was a housewife. Their home was located at 607 Maple Avenue. One history of the series characterized the Andersons as &quot;truly an idealized family, the sort that viewers could relate to and emulate.&quot; As the two eldest children aged from teenager to young adult, Betty (1956) and Bud (1959) graduated from high school and attended Springfield Junior College.

Vivi Janiss played the part of Myrtle Davis in 11 sporadic episodes from 1954 to 1959.

&quot;Father Knows Best&quot; had become so ingrained in American pop culture as an idyllic presentation of family life that in 1959, the U.S. Department of the Treasury commissioned a special 30-minute episode of the show titled &quot;24 Hours in Tyrant Land&quot;. Never aired on television, the episode—distributed to schools, churches and civic groups—promoted the purchase of savings bonds. The episode was later included on the Season 1 DVD.

Young left the series in 1960 at the height of the show&#x27;s popularity to work on other projects, but reruns continued to air in primetime for another three years, on CBS from 1960 to 1962 and on ABC from 1962 to 1963. Following that, reruns were shown on ABC-TV in the early afternoon for several years.

On November 22, 1963, at 1:42 p.m. EST during a rerun of the third-season episode &quot;Man About Town&quot; on several ABC affiliates, mostly in the Mountain Time Zone, (WABC-TV in New York was airing a local repeat of &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot;), ABC News broke into the program with the first bulletin of the news of the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas.

The façade of the Anderson house depicted in the series&#x27; opening credits is the same structure used as Mr. George Wilson&#x27;s home in the television series &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and again, in remodeled form, as Captain/Major Anthony Nelson&#x27;s residence in &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. Originally built in 1941 during the production of a series of &quot;Blondie&quot; movies, this theatrical property continued to serve for many more years as part of the backlot of Columbia Pictures (now Warner Brothers Ranch in Burbank, California). The house can also be seen in both its familiar &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; style and later renovated variations in episodes of &quot;Hazel,&quot; &quot;Bewitched,&quot; &quot;The Monkees,&quot; &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; and in numerous other television comedies and dramas.

===1977 reunion films===

The TV cast reunited for a pair of TV films on NBC: &quot;Father Knows Best Reunion&quot; on May 15, 1977, and &quot;Father Knows Best: Home for Christmas&quot; on December 18, 1977. In the 17 years since the series had ended, the characters of Betty and Bud had both married and had families of their own. Betty was the widowed mother of two girls, Jenny (Cari Anne Warder) and Ellen (Kyle Richards), while Bud and his wife Jean (Susan Adams) were the parents of a son, Robert &quot;Robby&quot; (Christopher Gardner). Kathy had become engaged to a doctor, Jason Harper (Hal England).

==Homages==
*In a September 2010 episode of the CBS daytime television series &quot;The Young and the Restless,&quot; newlyweds Billy and Victoria Abbott (portrayed by Billy Miller and Amelia Heinle, respectively) buy a house (exterior located on old Columbia Movie Ranch that was actually used in &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;) that replicates the interior of the Anderson home on a sound stage. They watch &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; on DVD and often call each other &quot;Jim&quot; and &quot;Margaret.&quot; At her wedding, which takes place in the house, Victoria chooses a 1950s-style white dress. Judge Anderson, the minister who marries the couple, was played by Donahue.
* The town of Springfield in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is named after the Springfield in &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;.

==Nielsen ratings==
The series finished in the Nielsen ratings at No. 25 for the 1957–1958 season, No. 14 for 1958–1959 and No. 6 for 1959–1960.

==Syndication==
&quot;Father Knows Best&quot; aired in the 1980s on Superstation WTBS and in the 1990s on The Family Channel. The show also aired on TV Land from 1998 to 1999 and 2002–2004. Reruns of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; have aired on Antenna TV as part of that channel&#x27;s regular programming schedule since January 3, 2011, and it also aired weekday afternoons on digital subchannel ME-TOO in Chicago. &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; is currently broadcast weekday mornings on fetv, GAC Family and GAC Living. It is also available for free streaming on the Vudu and Amazon Prime Video services.

==Film adaptation==
In March 1994, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana were developing a dramatic adaptation of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; for Universal Pictures. In July 2000, it was reported Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies were developing a new adaptation of the series that would be more light-hearted in comparison to McMurtry and Ossana&#x27;s attempt. The plot for the project involving a child entering his father in a &quot;father of the year&quot; contest which the father would discover he won because his son lied about several aspects on the application. The father would initially be determined to tell the truth, until he falls in love with the woman officiating the contest forcing him to adhere to his son&#x27;s lies and play the role of the &quot;perfect father&quot;. Bob Hilgenberg and Rob Muir had written the draft as a possible vehicle for Tim Allen.

<doc id="1014414" wikidata="Q2853339" url="?curid=1014414" title="Antiporter">
<text>An antiporter (also called exchanger or counter-transporter) is an integral membrane protein that uses secondary active transport to move two or more molecules in opposite directions across a phospholipid membrane. It is a type of cotransporter, which means that uses the energetically favorable movement of one molecule down its electrochemical gradient to power the energetically unfavorable movement of another molecule up its electrochemical gradient. This is in contrast to symporters, which are another type of cotransporter that moves two or more ions in the same direction, and primary active transport, which is directly powered by ATP.
Transport may involve one or more of each type of solute. For example, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, found in the plasma membrane of many cells, moves three sodium ions in one direction, and one calcium ion in the other. As with sodium in this example, antiporters rely on an established gradient that makes entry of one ion energetically favorable to force the unfavorable movement of a second molecule in the opposite direction. Through their diverse functions, antiporters are involved in various important physiological processes, such as regulation of the strength of cardiac muscle contraction, transport of carbon dioxide by erythrocytes, regulation of cytosolic pH, and accumulation of sucrose in plant vacuoles.

== Background ==
Cotransporters are found in all organisms and fall under the broader category of transport proteins, a diverse group of transmembrane proteins that includes uniporters, symporters, and antiporters. Each of them are responsible for providing a means of movement for water-soluble molecules that otherwise would not be able to pass through lipid-based plasma membrane. The simplest of these are the uniporters, which facilitate the movement of one type of molecule in the direction that follows its concentration gradient. In mammals, they are most commonly responsible for bringing glucose and amino acids into cells.

Symporters and antiporters are more complex because they move more than one ion and the movement of one of those ions is in an energetically unfavorable direction. As multiple molecules are involved, multiple binding processes must occur as the transporter undergoes a cycle of conformational changes to move them from one side of the membrane to the other. The mechanism used by these transporters limits their functioning to moving only a few molecules at a time. As a result, symporters and antiporters are characterized by a slower transport speed, moving between 102 and 104 molecules per second. Compare this to ion channels that provide a means for facilitated diffusion to occur and allow between 107 and 108 ions pass through the plasma membrane per second.

Though ATP-powered pumps also move molecules in an energetically unfavorable direction and undergo conformational changes to do so, they fall under a different category of membrane proteins because they couple the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to transport their respective ions. These ion pumps are very selective, consisting of a double gating system where at least one of the gates is always shut. The ion is allowed to enter from one side of the membrane while one of the gates is open, after which it will shut. Only then will the second gate open to allow the ion to leave on the membrane&#x27;s opposite side. The time between the alternating gate opening is referred to as the occluded state, where the ions are bound and both gates are shut. These gating reactions limit the speed of these pumps, causing them to function even slower than transport proteins, moving between 100 and 103 ions per second.

== Structure and function ==
To function in active transport, a membrane protein must meet certain requirements. The first of these is that the interior of the protein must contain a cavity that is able to contain its corresponding molecule or ion. Next, the protein must be able to assume at least two different conformations, one with its cavity open to the extracellular space and the other with its cavity open to the cytosol. This is crucial for the movement of molecules from one side of the membrane to the other. Finally, the cavity of the protein must contain binding sites for its ligands, and these binding sites must have a different affinity for the ligand in each of the protein&#x27;s conformations. Without this, the ligand will not be able to bind to the transporter on one side of the plasma membrane and be released from it on the other side. As transporters, antiporters have all of these features.

Because antiporters are highly diverse, their structure can vary widely depending upon the type of molecules being transported and their location in the cell. However, there are some common features that all antiporters share. One of these is multiple transmembrane regions that span the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane and form a channel through which hydrophilic molecules can pass. These transmembrane regions are typically structured from alpha helices and are connected by loops in both the extracellular space and cytosol. These loops are what contain the binding sites for the molecules associated with the antiporter.

These features of antiporters allow them to carry out their function in maintaining cellular homeostasis. They provide a space where a hydrophilic molecule can pass through the hydrophobic lipid bilayer, allowing them to bypass the hydrophobic interactions of the plasma membrane. This enables the efficient movement of molecules needed for the environment of the cell, such as in the acidification of organelles. The varying affinity of the antiporter for each ion or molecule on either side of the plasma membrane allows it to bind to and release its ligands on the appropriate side of the membrane according to the electrochemical gradient of the ion being harnessed for its energetically favorable concentration.

== Mechanism ==

The mechanism of antiporter transport involves several key steps and a series of conformational changes that are dictated by the structural element described above:

# The substrate binds to its specific binding site on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane, forming a temporary substrate-bound open form of the antiporter.
# This becomes an occluded, substrate-bound state that is still facing the extracellular space.
# The antiporter undergoes a conformational change to become an occluded, substrate-bound protein that is now facing the cytosol. As it does so, it passes through a temporary fully-occluded intermediate stage.
# The substrate is released from the antiporter as it takes on an open, inward-facing conformation.
# The antiporter can now bind to its second substrate and transport it in the opposite direction by taking on its transient substrate-bound open state.
# This is followed by an occluded, substrate-bound state that is still facing the cytosol, a conformation change with a temporary fully-occluded intermediate stage, and a return to the antiporter&#x27;s open, outward-facing conformation.
# The second substrate is released and the antiporter can return to its original conformation state, where it is ready to bind to new molecules or ions and repeat its transport process.

== History ==
Antiporters were discovered as scientists were exploring ion transport mechanisms across biological membranes. The early studies took place in the mid-20th century and were focused on the mechanisms that transported ions such as sodium, potassium, and calcium across the plasma membrane. Researchers made the observation that these ions were moved in opposite directions and hypothesized the existence of membrane proteins that could facilitate this type of transport.

In the 1960&#x27;s, biochemist Efraim Racker made a breakthrough in the discovery of antiporters. Through purification from bovine heart mitochondria, Racker and his colleagues found a mitochondrial protein that could exchange inorganic phosphate for hydroxide ions. The protein is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and transports phosphate ions for use in oxidative phosphorylation. It became known as the phosphate-hydroxide antiporter, or mitochondrial phosphate carrier protein, and was the first example of an antiporter identified in living cells.

As time went on, researchers discovered other antiporters in different membranes and in various organisms. This includes the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX), another crucial antiporter that regulates intracellular calcium levels through the exchange of sodium ions for calcium ions across the plasma membrane. It was discovered in the 1970s and is now a well-characterized antiporter known to be found in many different types of cells.

Advances in the fields of biochemistry and molecular biology have enabled the identification and characterization of a wide range of antiporters. Understanding the transport processes of various molecules and ions has provided insight into cellular transport mechanisms, as well as the role of antiporters in various physiological functions and in the maintenance of homeostasis

== Role in homeostasis ==

=== Sodium-calcium exchanger ===
The sodium-calcium exchanger, also known as the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger or NCX, is an antiporter responsible for removing calcium from cells. This title encompasses a class of ion transporters that are commonly found in the heart, kidney, and brain. They use the energy stored in the electrochemical gradient of sodium to exchange the flow of three sodium ions into the cell for the export of one calcium ion. Though this exchanger is most common in the membranes of the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum of excitable cells, it can be found in many different cell types in various species.

Although the sodium-calcium exchanger has a low affinity for calcium ions, it can transport a high amount of the ion in a short period of time. Because of these properties, it is useful in situations where there is an urgent need to export high amounts of calcium, such as after an action potential has occurred. Its characteristics also enable NCX to work with other proteins that have a greater affinity for calcium ions without interfering with their functions. NCX works with these proteins to carry out functions such as cardiac muscle relaxation, excitation-contraction coupling, and photoreceptor activity. They also maintain the concentration of calcium ions in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac cells, endoplasmic reticulum of excitable and nonexcitable cells, and the mitochondria.

Another key characteristic of this antiporter is its reversibility. This means that if the cell is depolarized enough, the extracellular sodium level is low enough, or the intracellular level of sodium is high enough, NCX will operate in the reverse direction and begin bringing calcium into the cell. For example, when NCX functions during excitotoxicity, this characteristic allows it to have a protective effect because the accompanying increase in intracellular calcium levels enables the exchanger to work in its normal direction regardless of the sodium concentration. Another example is the depolarization of cardiac muscle cells, which is accompanied by a large increase in the intracellular sodium concentration that causes NCX to work in reverse. Because the concentration of calcium is carefully regulated during the cardiac action potential, this is only a temporary effect as calcium is pumped out of the cell.

The sodium-calcium exchanger&#x27;s role in maintaining calcium homeostasis in cardiac muscle cells allows it to help relax the heart muscle as it exports calcium during diastole. Therefore, its dysfunction can result in abnormal calcium movement and the development of various cardiac diseases. Abnormally high intracellular calcium levels can hinder diastole and cause abnormal systole and arrhythmias. Arrhythmias can occur when calcium is not properly exported by NCX, causing delayed afterdepolarizations and triggering abnormal activity that can possibly lead to atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.

If the heart experiences ischemia, the inadequate oxygen supply can disrupt ion homeostasis. When the body tries to stabilize this by returning blood to the area, ischemia-reperfusion injury, a type of oxidative stress, occurs. If NCX is dysfunctional, it can exacerbate the increase of calcium that accompanies reperfusion, causing cell death and tissue damage. Similarly, NCX dysfunction has found to be involved in ischemic strokes. Its activity is upregulated, causing a increased cytosolic calcium level, which can lead to neuronal cell death.

The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger has also been implicated in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Its dysfunction can result in oxidative stress and neuronal cell death, contributing to the cognitive decline that characterizes Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The dysregulation of calcium homeostasis has been found to be a key part of neuron death and Alzheimer&#x27;s pathogenesis. For example, neurons that have neurofibrillary tangles contain high levels of calcium and show hyperactivation of calcium-dependent proteins. The abnormal calcium handling of atypical NCX function can also cause the mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuronal cell death that characterize Parkinson&#x27;s. In this case, if dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra are affected, it can contribute to the onset and development of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Although the mechanism is not entirely understood, disease models have shown a link between NCX and Parkinson&#x27;s and that NCX inhibitors can prevent death of dopaminergic neurons.

=== Sodium-hydrogen antiporter ===
The sodium–hydrogen antiporter, also known as the sodium-proton exchanger, Na+/H+ exchanger, or NHE, is an antiporter responsible for transporting sodium into the cell and hydrogen out of the cell. As such, it is important in the regulation of cellular pH and sodium levels. There are differences among the types of NHE antiporter families present in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The 9 isoforms of this transporter that are found in the human genome fall under several families, including the cation-proton antiporters (CPA 1, CPA 2, and CPA 3) and sodium-transporting carboxylic acid decarboxylase (NaT-DC). Prokaryotic organisms contain the Na+/H+ antiporter families NhaA, NhaB, NhaC, NhaD, and NhaE.

Because enzymes can only function at certain pH ranges, it is critical for cells to tightly regulate cytosolic pH. When a cell&#x27;s pH is outside of the optimal range, the sodium-hydrogen antiporter detects this and is activated to transport ions as a homeostatic mechanism to restore pH balance. Since ion flux can be reversed in mammalian cells, NHE can also be used to transport sodium out of the cell to prevent excess sodium from accumulating and causing toxicity.

As suggested by its functions, this antiporter is located in the kidney for sodium reabsorption regulation and in the heart for intracellular pH and contractility regulation. NHE plays an important role in the nephron of the kidney, especially in the cells of the proximal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. The sodium-hydrogen antiporter&#x27;s function is upregulated by Angiotensin II in the proximal convoluted tubule when the body needs to reabsorb sodium and excrete hydrogen.

Plants are sensitive to high amounts of salt, which can halt certain necessary functions of the eukaryotic organism, including photosynthesis. For the organisms to maintain homeostasis and carry out crucial functions, Na+/H+ antiporters are used to rid the cytoplasm of excess sodium by pumping Na+ out of the cell. These antiporters can also close their channel to stop sodium from entering the cell, along with allowing excess sodium within the cell to enter into a vacuole.

Dysregulation of the sodium-hydrogen antiporter&#x27;s activity has been linked to cardiovascular diseases, renal disorders, and neurological conditions NHE inhibitors are being developed to treat these issues. One of the isoforms of the antiporter, NHE1, is essential to the function of the mammalian myocardium. NHE is involved in the case of hypertrophy and when damage to the heart muscle occurs, such as during ischemia and reperfusion. Studies have shown that NHE1 is more active in animal models experiencing myocardial infarction and left ventricular hypertrophy. During these cardiac events, the function of the sodium-hydrogen antiporter causes an increase in the sodium levels of cardiac muscle cells. In turn, the work of the sodium-calcium antiporter leads to more calcium being brought into the cell, which is what results in damage to the myocardium.

Five isoforms of NHE are found in kidney&#x27;s epithelial cells. The best studied one is NHE3, which is mainly located in the proximal tubules of the kidney and plays a key role in acid-base homeostasis. Issues with NHE3 disrupt the reabsorption of sodium and secretion of hydrogen. The main conditions that NHE3 dysregulation can cause are hypertension and renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Hypertension can occur when more sodium is reabsorbed in the kidneys because water will follow the sodium ions and create an elevated blood volume. This, in turn, leads to elevated blood pressure. RTA is characterized by the inability of the kidneys to acidify the urine due to underactive NHE3 and reduced secretion of hydrogen ions, resulting in metabolic acidosis. On the other hand, overactive NHE3 can lead to excess secretion of hydrogen ions and metabolic alkalosis, where the blood is too alkaline.

NHE can also be linked to neurodegeneration. The dysregulation or loss of the isoform NHE6 can lead to pathological changes in the tau proteins of human neurons, which can have huge consequences. For example, Christianson Syndrome (CS) is an X-linked disorder caused by a loss-of-function mutation in NHE6, which leads to the over acidification of endosomes. In studies done on postmortem brains of individuals with CS, lower NHE6 function was linked to higher levels of tau deposition. The level of tau phosphorylation was also found to be elevated, which leads to the formation of insoluble tangles that can cause neuronal damage and death. Tau proteins are also implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s diseases.

=== Chloride-bicarbonate antiporter ===
The chloride-bicarbonate antiporter is crucial to maintaining pH and fluid balance through its function of exchanging bicarbonate and chloride ions through cell membranes. This exchange occurs in many different types of body cells. In the cardiac Purkinje fibers and smooth muscle cells of the ureters, this antiporter is the main mechanism of chloride transport into the cells. Epithelial cells such as those of the kidney use chloride-bicarbonate exchange to regulate their volume, intracellular pH, and extracellular pH. Gastric parietal cells, osteoclasts, and other acid-secreting cells have chloride-bicarbonate antiporters that function in the basolateral membrane to dispose of excess bicarbonate left behind by the function of carbonic anhydrase and apical proton pumps. However, base-secreting cells exhibit apical chloride-bicarbonate exchange and basolateral proton pumps.

An example of a chloride-bicarbonate antiporter is the chloride anion exchanger, also known as down-regulated in adenoma (protein DRA). It is found in the intestinal mucosa, especially in the columnar epithelium and goblet cells of the apical surface of the membrane, where it carries out the function of chloride and bicarbonate exchange. Protein DRA&#x27;s reuptake of chloride is critical to creating an osmotic gradient that allows the intestine to reabsorb water.

Another well-studied chloride-bicarbonate antiporter is anion exchanger 1 (AE1), which is also known as band 3 anion transport protein or solute carrier family 4 member 1 (SLC4A1). This exchanger is found in red blood cells, where it helps transport bicarbonate and carbon dioxide between the lungs and tissues to maintain acid-base homeostasis. AE1 also expressed in the basolateral side of cells of the renal tubules. It is crucial in the collecting duct of the nephron, which is where its acid-secreting α-intercalated cells are located. These cells use carbon dioxide and water to generate hydrogen and bicarbonate ions, which is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. The hydrogen is exchanged across the membrane into the lumen of the collecting duct, and thus acid is excreted into the urine.

Because of its importance to the reabsorption of water in the intestine, mutations in protein DRA cause a condition called congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD). This disorder is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in the DRA gene on chromosome 7. CCD symptoms in newborns are chronic diarrhea with failure to thrive, and the disorder is characterized by diarrhea that causes metabolic alkalosis.

Mutations of kidney AE1 can lead to distal renal tubular acidosis, a disorder characterized by the inability to secrete acid into the urine. This causes metabolic acidosis, where the blood is too acidic. A chronic state of metabolic acidosis can the health of the bones, kidneys, muscles, and cardiovascular system. Mutations in erythrocyte AE1 cause alterations of its function, leading to changes in red blood cell morphology and function. This can have serious consequences because the shape of red blood cells is closely tied to their function of gas exchange in the lungs and tissues. One such condition is hereditary spherocytosis, a genetic disorder characterized by spherical red blood cells. Another is Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, where a deletion in the AE1 gene generates oval-shaped erythrocytes. Finally, overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis is a rare genetic disorder where red blood cells have an abnormally high volume, leading to changes in hydration status.

The proper function of AE2, an isoform of AE1, is important in gastric secretion, osteoclast differentiation and function, and the synthesis of enamel. The hydrochloric acid secretion at the apical surface of both gastric parietal cells and osteoclasts relies on chloride-bicarbonate exchange in the basolateral surface. Studies found that mice with nonfunctional AE2 did not secrete hydrochloric acid, and it was concluded that the exchanger is necessary for hydrochloric acid loading in parietal cells. When AE2 expression was suppressed in an animal model, cell lines were unable to differentiate into osteoclasts and perform their functions. Additionally, cells that had osteoclast markers but were deficient in AE2 were abnormal compared to the wild-type cells and were unable to resorb mineralized tissue. This demonstrates the importance of AE2 in osteoclast function. Finally, as the hydroxyapatite crystals of enamel are being formed, a lot of hydrogen is produced, which must be neutralized so that mineralization can proceed. Mice with inactivated AE2 were toothless and suffered from incomplete enamel maturation.

=== Chloride-hydrogen antiporter ===
The chloride-hydrogen antiporter facilitates the exchange of chloride ions for hydrogen ions across plasma membranes, thus playing a critical role in maintaining acid-base balance and chloride homeostasis. It is found in various tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and pancreas. The well-known chloride-hydrogen antiporters belong in the CLC family, which have isoforms from CLC-1 to CLC-7, each with a distinct tissue distribution. Their structure involves two CLC proteins coming together to form a homodimer or a heterodimer where both monomers contain an ion translocation pathway. CLC proteins can either be ion channels or anion-proton exchangers, so CLC-1 and CLC-2 are membrane chloride channels, while CLC-3 through CLC-7 are chloride-hydrogen exchangers.

CLC-4 is a member of the CLC family that is prominent in the brain, but is also located in the liver, kidneys, heart, skeletal muscle, and intestine. It likely resides in endosomes and participates in their acidification, but can also be expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. Its roles are not entirely clear, but CLC-4 has been found to possibly participate in endosomal acidification, transferrin trafficking, renal endocytosis, and the hepatic secretory pathway.

CLC-5 is one of the best-studied members of this protein family. It shares 80% of its amino acid sequence with CLC-3 and CLC-4, but it is mainly found in the kidney, especially in the proximal tubule, collecting duct, and ascending limb of the loop of Henle. It functions to transport substances through the endosomal membrane, so it is crucial for pinocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins from the apical surface.

CLC-7 is another example of a CLC family protein. It is ubiquitously expressed as the chloride-hydrogen antiporter in lysosomes and in the ruffled border of osteoclasts. CLC-7 may be important for regulating to concentration of chloride in lysosomes. It is associated with a protein called Ostm1, forming a complex that allows CLC-7 to carry out its functions. For example, these proteins are crucial to the process of acidifying the resorption lacuna, which enables bone remodeling to occur.

CLC-4 has been connected with mental retardation involving seizure disorders, facial abnormalities, and behavior disorders. Studies found frameshift and missense mutations in patients exhibiting these symptoms. Because these symptoms were mostly exhibited in males, with less severe pathology in females, it is likely X-linked. Studies done on animal models have also shown the possibility of a connection between nonfunctional CLC-4 and impaired neural branching of hippocampus neurons.

Defects in the CLC-5 gene were shown to be the cause of 60% of cases of Dent&#x27;s disease, which is characterized by tubular proteinuria, formation of kidney stones, excess calcium in the urine, nephrocalcinosis, and chronic kidney failure. This is caused by abnormalities that occur in the endocytosis process when CLC-5 is mutated. Dent&#x27;s disease itself is one of the causes of Fanconi syndrome, which occurs when the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney do not perform an adequate level of reabsorption. It causes molecules produced by metabolic pathways, such as amino acids, glucose, and uric acid to be excreted in the urine instead of being reabsorbed. The result is polyuria, dehydration, rickets in children, osteomalacia in adults, acidosis, and hypokalemia.

CLC-7&#x27;s role in osteoclast function was revealed by studies on knockout mice that developed severe osteopetrosis. These mice were smaller, had shortened long bones, disorganized trabecular structure, a missing medullary cavity, and their teeth did not erupt. This was found to be caused by deletion mutations, missense mutations, and gain-of-function mutations that sped up the gating of CLC-7. CLC-7 is expressed in almost every neuronal cell type, and its loss led to widespread neurodegeneration in mice, especially in the hippocampus. In longer-lived models, the cortex and hippocampus had almost entirely disappeared after 1.5 years. Finally, because of its importance in lysosomes, altered expression of CLC-7 can lead to lysosomal storage disorders. Mice with a mutation introduced to the CLC-7 gene developed lysosomal storage disease and retinal degeneration.

=== Reduced folate carrier protein ===
The reduced folate carrier protein (RFC) is a transmembrane protein responsible for the transport of folate, or vitamin B9, into cells. It uses the large gradient of organic phosphate to move folate into the cell against its concentration gradient. The RFC protein can transport folates, reduced folates, the derivatives of reduced folate, and the drug methotrexate. The transporter is encoded by the SLC19A1 gene and is ubiquitously expressed in human cells. Its peak activity occurs at pH 7.4, with no activity occurring below pH 6.4. The RFC protein is critical because folates take the form of hydrophilic anions at physiological pH, so they do not diffuse naturally across biological membranes. Folate is essential for processes such as DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation, and without entry into cells, these could not occur.

Because folates are essential for various life-sustaining processes, a deficiency in this molecule can lead to fetal abnormalities, neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Folates cannot be synthesized in the body, so it must be taken in through diet and moved into cells. Without the RFC protein facilitating this movement, processes such as embryological development and DNA repair cannot occur.

Adequate folate levels are required for the development of the neural tube in the fetus. Folate deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly. In mouse models, inactivating both alleles of the FRC protein gene causes death of the embryo. Even if folate is supplemented during gestation, the mice died within two weeks of birth from the failure of hematopoietic tissues.

Altered function of the RFC protein can increase folate deficiency, enhancing cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. In terms of cardiovascular issues, folate contributes to homocysteine metabolism. Low folate levels result in elevated homocysteine levels, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In terms of cancer, folate deficiency is related to an increased risk, especially that of colorectal cancers. In mouse models with altered RFC protein expression showed increased transcripts of genes related to colon cancer and increased proliferation of colonocytes. The cancer risk is likely related to the FRC protein&#x27;s role in DNA synthesis because inadequate levels of folate can lead to DNA damage and aberrant DNA methylation.

=== Vesicle neurotransmitter antiporters ===
Vesicle neurotransmitter antiporters are responsible for packaging neurotransmitters into vesicles in neurons. They utilize the electrochemical gradient of hydrogen protons across the membranes of synaptic vesicles to move neurotransmitters into them. This is essential for the process of synaptic transmission, which requires neurotransmitters to be released into the synapse to bind to receptors on the next neuron.

One of the best characterized of these antiporters is the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT). It is responsible for the storage, sorting, and release of neurotransmitters, as well as for protecting them from autoxidation. VMAT&#x27;s transport functions are dependent on the electrochemical gradient created by a vesicular hydrogen proton-ATPase. VMAT1 and VMAT2 are two isoforms that can transport monoamines such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in a proton-dependent fashion. VMAT1 can be found in neuroendocrine cells, while VMAT2 can be found in the neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as in adrenal chromaffin cells.

Another important vesicle neurotransmitter antiporter is the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). This family of proteins includes three isoforms, VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and VGLUT3, that are responsible for packaging glutamate - the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain - into synaptic vesicles. These antiporters vary by location. VGLUT1 is found in areas of the brain related to higher cognitive functions, such as the neocortex. VGLUT2 works to regulate basic physiological functions and is expressed in subcortical regions such as the brainstem and hypothalamus. Finally, VGLUT3 can be seen in neurons that also express other neurotransmitters.

VMAT2 has been found to contribute to neurological conditions such as mood disorders and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Studies done on an animal model of clinical depression showed that functional alterations of VMAT2 were associated with depression. The nucleus accumbens, pars compacta of the substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area - all subregions of the brain involved in clinical depression - were found to have lower VMAT2 levels. The likely cause for this is VMAT&#x27;s relationship with serotonin and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters that are related to depression. VMAT dysfunction may contribute to the altered levels of these neurotransmitters that occur in mood disorders.

Lower expression of VMAT2 was found to correlate with a higher susceptibility to Parkinson&#x27;s disease and the antiporter&#x27;s mRNA was found in all cell groups damaged by Parkinson&#x27;s. This is likely because VMAT2 dysfunction can lead to a decrease in dopamine packaging into vesicles, accounting for the dopamine depletion that characterizes the disease. For this reason, the antiporter has been identified as a protective factor that could be targeted for the prevention of Parkinson&#x27;s.

Because alterations in glutamate release have been linked to the generation of seizures in epilepsy, alterations in the function of VGLUT may be implicated. A study was conducted where the VGLUT1 gene was inactivated in the astrocytes and neurons of an animal model. When the gene was inactivated in astrocytes, there was an 80% loss in the antiporter protein itself and, in turn, a reduction in glutamate uptake. The mice in this condition experienced seizures, lower body mass, and higher mortality rates. The researchers concluded that VGLUT1 function in astrocytes is therefore critical to epilepsy resistance and normal weight gain.

There is a lot of evidence that the glutamate system plays a role in long-term cell growth and synaptic plasticity. Disturbances of these processes has been linked to the pathology of mood disorders. The link between the function of the glutamatergic neurotransmitter system and mood disorders sets up VGLUT as one of the targets for treatment.

<text>The City of Los Angeles was a streamlined passenger train between Chicago, Illinois, and Los Angeles, California via Omaha, Nebraska, and Ogden, Utah. Between Omaha and Los Angeles it ran on the Union Pacific Railroad; east of Omaha it ran on the Chicago and North Western Railway until October 1955 and on the Milwaukee Road thereafter. The train had number 103 westbound and number 104 eastbound.

This train was the top-of-the-line for UP, which marketed it as a competitor to the &quot;Super Chief&quot;, a streamlined passenger train on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and the &quot;Golden State&quot;, a streamlined passenger train jointly operated by the Rock Island and Southern Pacific railroads. Many of the train&#x27;s cars bore the names of locales in and around its namesake city.

==History==

&quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; service began in May 1936 using the diesel-powered custom streamliner M-10002. It was the second of Union Pacific&#x27;s diesel streamliners to the west coast, following the &quot;City of Portland&quot; that started service nearly a year earlier. Initial service consisted of five runs monthly. CNW / UP replaced that set with a fourteen unit full-sized train pulled by a three-unit set of EMC E2 locomotives in December 1937. Service frequency was doubled in July 1938 with the former &quot;City of San Francisco&quot; streamliner M-10004. That set was replaced in March 1939 with a full-size train pulled by two-unit EMC E3 locomotive set. After World War II service was expanded with additional trains until daily service was achieved in 1947.

The UP scored a public relations coup in the mid-1950s when the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; was featured in two episodes of the popular television series &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. Starting in 1955 the Milwaukee Road tracks were used in place of the Chicago and North Western between Chicago and Omaha. Actor Ronald Reagan often traveled on this train and even did a full-page print ad for it that appeared in the National Geographic magazine. In a cost-cutting move, the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; was combined with the &quot;City of San Francisco&quot; in 1960. &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; service was terminated after Amtrak took over Union Pacific&#x27;s passenger rail services on May 1, 1971.

Amtrak operated several excursion services on the Los Angeles–Las Vegas segment from 1972 to 1976, ending with the short-lived &quot;Las Vegas Limited&quot;. From 1979 to 1997, Amtrak operated the Salt Lake City–Los Angeles (Ogden–Los Angeles until 1983) &quot;Desert Wind&quot;; it connected to the Oakland–Chicago &quot;California Zephyr&quot; at its northern end, once again offering Chicago–Los Angeles through service.

===Timeline===

* May 15, 1936: &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; makes its first run between Chicago, Illinois and Los Angeles, California. One trainset (the M-10002) leaves each terminal five times a month.
* December 1937: 14-car 791-ton train powered by three EMC E2s replaces the older trainset, reassigned as &quot;City of Portland.&quot;
* July 1938: Former &quot;City of San Francisco&quot; trainset M-10004 joins service, allowing departures ten times a month.
* March 1939: New train powered by two unit EMC E3 set enters service, replacing M-10004; frequency remains ten departures per month. The &quot;Hollywood&quot;, a lounge car built for the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;, is the first passenger car with an interior built entirely of synthetic materials, including the newly invented formica (plastic) and naugahyde.
*July 1941: EMC E6 three unit set replaces E3 set; consist of train expanded to 14 cars.
* 1947: &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; begins running daily.
* 1955: Astra Dome dome cars are added to the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;. The Milwaukee Road takes over operation of the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; from the Chicago and North Western Railway between Chicago and Omaha.
* 1956: &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; are combined and operate on the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; schedule. (The Challenger operated on its own schedule during a couple of summers thereafter.)
* 1970: Dome dining cars retired and replaced with standard flat top cars.
* 1971: Amtrak took over intercity passenger operations in the United States on May 1, 1971. The final &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; trips left their terminals on April 30 and arrived on May 2, ending UP passenger service.

===Other railroad uses of the name &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;===
The &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; name has also been applied to a 48-seat diner built by the St. Louis Car Company in 1949. The car was originally UP No. 4808 and is currently owned and operated by the Union Pacific as part of their excursion fleet.

== Equipment ==
The &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; began running in 1936 using the articulated M-10002 trainset. Behind the two power units were an RPO-baggage car, a baggage-dormitory-kitchen, a diner-lounge, an 11-section sleeping car, a 7-double bedroom 2-compartment sleeper, two more 11-section sleepers, a 48-seat coach, and a 38-seat coach-buffet car. All the passenger-carrying cars were air-conditioned. The Union Pacific replaced it with a non-articulated train in late 1937. A trio of EMC E2 diesel locomotives pulled a baggage-dormitory car, two 52-seat coaches, a coffee shop-kitchen car, a dining car, a dormitory-buffet lounge, seven sleeping cars of varying configurations, and a buffet-lounge-observation car. Union Pacific added a second articulated trainset in 1938, the M-10004. Its configuration was similar to the M-10002: two power units, a baggage-dormitory, 40- and 48-seat coaches, a coffee-shop kitchen, a diner, an 11-section sleeper, two 7-double bedroom 2-compartment sleepers, two more 11-section sleepers, and a buffet-lounge-observation car. The second articulated trainset was replaced with an eleven car non-articulated train powered by an EMC E3 twin locomotive set in March 1939. In July 1941 the E3 locomotive set was replaced with a three unit E6 set and the consist expanded to 14 cars. The two three-locomotive, 14 car trains were joined after the end of the war by new E7-powered trains, establishing daily service in 1947. The E2 locomotives were traded in 1953.

A typical City of Los Angeles train consist around 1955 included:
* EMD E9 A-B-A diesel locomotive set
* Mail express 5707
* Baggage 5606
* Baggage dormitory 3107
* Placid series sleeper 11-double bedroom &quot;Placid Lake&quot;
* Placid series sleeper 11-double bedroom &quot;Placid Dune&quot;
* Sleeper 4-4-2 &quot;Imperial Hill&quot;
* Astra Dome diner 8008
* Sleeper 4-4-2 &quot;Imperial Club&quot;
* Sleeper 5-2-2 &quot;Ocean Beach&quot;
* Sleeper 5-2-2 &quot;Ocean Bay&quot;
* Astra Dome lounge observation 9009

<doc id="1014418" wikidata="Q7528254" url="?curid=1014418" title="Sir Les Patterson">
<text>Sir Leslie Colin Patterson is a fictional character created and portrayed by Australian comedian Barry Humphries. Patterson is obese, and offensive.

==Character origins==
By Humphries&#x27; own account, the character of Patterson first appeared in a one-man show that he performed at the St. George leagues club in Sydney in January 1974. Appearing in the guise of the boorish, loud-mouthed and uncultured Patterson, Humphries claimed to be that club&#x27;s own entertainments officer as he introduced the next act, Dame Edna Everage. As Humphries recalled, &quot;I understood later that many members of the audience thought Les was genuinely a club official, which says a lot for his charm and sincerity&quot;. Later that same year, the character (by now identified as Australia&#x27;s cultural attaché to the Far East) was revived in a two-week cabaret appearance that Humphries performed at the Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong. In Humphries&#x27; words, &quot;The English merchant bankers and commodity brokers and Australian accountants there all recognised Les as someone they knew in the Australian diplomatic corps, and took him to their hearts.&quot; Patterson went on to play an even larger role in Humphries&#x27; next one-man show in London, &quot;Housewife, Superstar!&quot; (1976), delivering a lengthy monologue that was included on the original cast album.

Humphries (who gave up alcohol in the 1970s) said in 2016 that &quot;in Les I can release my alcoholism&quot;. He found that of all his characters Sir Les caused the most offence Down Under, as Australians are &quot;deeply conventional&quot; and &quot;like being bossed around&quot;.

==Stage, film and TV appearances==
===On stage===
For more than 30 years, the character of Sir Les Patterson was a regular feature in Barry Humphries&#x27; solo theatrical appearances in Australia and the United Kingdom, during which he performed a monologue and frequently burst into song. Some of Patterson&#x27;s specific monologues (as documented in the theatre programmes for Humphries&#x27; various shows) included the following:
* &quot;The Yartz&quot;, from &quot;Isn&#x27;t it Pathetic at His Age?&quot; (Australian tour, 1978–79) and &quot;A Night with Dame Edna&quot;; (UK tour, 1978–79)
* &quot;Peter and the Shark&quot;, from &quot;The Last Night of the Poms&quot; (London, 1981) and &quot;Song of Australia&quot; (Melbourne and Sydney, 1983)
* &quot;Les looking good&quot;, from &quot;An Evening&#x27;s Intercourse with Barry Humphries&quot; (Australian tour, 1981; UK tour, 1982)
* &quot;Les Patterson presents his broad-based package&quot;, from &quot;Tears Before Bedtime&quot; (Australian tour, 1985–86) and &quot;Back with a Vengeance&quot; (UK tour, 1987–88)
* &quot;Les Patterson gets an Audience&quot;, from &quot;Look at Me When I&#x27;m Talking to You&quot; (Australian and UK tours, 1994–95)
* &quot;Address to the nation&quot;, from &quot;Back to My Roots (and Other Suckers&quot; (Australian tour, 2003)
* &quot;My Sacred Trust&quot;, from &quot;Back with a Vengeance: A New Effort&quot; (Australian tour, 2006–07)

During the Australian tour of &quot;Remember You&#x27;re Out!&quot; (1999), it was stated that Patterson would not appear for fear of offending Humphries&#x27; more genteel fans; the character nevertheless made an appearance (as a scripted but seemingly unexpected gate crashing) during the show&#x27;s second act.

In an effort to specifically satisfy fans of Les Patterson&#x27;s earthy humour, Humphries performed two one-man shows entirely in Patterson&#x27;s guise: one in London, entitled &quot;Les Patterson Rampant in Whitehall&quot; (June–July 1996) and another in New York, entitled &quot;Les Patterson Unzipped&quot; (Zipper Theater, 2 May 2005). The London performance was recorded and has since been released both as an audio tape and a video tape, under the title &quot;Live and Rampant: Les Patterson has a Stand-Up&quot;.

===Film and television===
On television, Patterson presented a documentary about the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, entitled &quot;Sir Les and the Great Chinese Takeaway&quot; (1997). He has appeared as a special guest on the following:
* &quot;Another Audience with Dame Edna Everage&quot; (1984)
* &quot;Dame Edna&#x27;s Christmas Experience&quot; (1987)
* &quot;The Dame Edna Satellite Experience&quot; (1989)
* &quot;A Late Lunch with Les&quot; (1991)
* &quot;Les Patterson and the Great Chinese Takeaway&quot; (1997)
* &quot;Barry Humphries&#x27; Flashbacks&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Aussies: Who Gives a XXXX&quot; (2001)
* &quot;The Dame Edna Treatment&quot; (five episodes, 2007).

Barry Humphries was interviewed in Patterson&#x27;s guise on numerous TV talk shows, including &quot;Parkinson&quot; (1982), Clive James, Clive Anderson&#x27;s &quot;All Talk&quot; (1995), &quot;The Panel&quot; (2003) and &quot;Rove Live&quot; (2005).

In 1987, Sir Les Patterson was the basis of an ambitious full-length feature film, &quot;Les Patterson Saves the World&quot;, which was a critical and commercial failure.

==Other appearances in character==
===Personal appearances===
In 1983, the Cambridge Union Society held a spoof ceremony in which they purported to award Les Patterson an honorary Doctorate of Letters. This reportedly caused some anxiety amongst Cambridge dons, who were worried that the public might mistakenly believe that Cambridge University had awarded the degree to Sir Les. The Cambridge Union is not chartered as a degree awarding body.

In 1986, Humphries as Patterson was awarded the Douglas Wilkie Medal for doing the least for football in the best and fairest manner. His dislike for the game of Australian rules football was illustrated when he coated a leather football in cream cake, and fed it to a camel.

===Depictions in art===
In 1999, expatriate Australian photographer Polly Borland created a memorable image of Sir Les Patterson (seated on a toilet, waving an Australian flag) as part of a series entitled &quot;Australians&quot;, which was exhibited at the respective National Portrait Galleries in London (2000) and Canberra (2001).

In 2000, a portrait of Humphries as Patterson by painter Bill Leak won the Packing Room Prize at the Archibald Prize. In 2014, Tim Storrier&#x27;s full-length painting, &quot;The Member, Dr Sir Leslie Colin Patterson KCB AO&quot;, also won the Packing Room Prize.

==Fictional biography==
===Early life and education===
Sir Leslie Colin Patterson , was born on 1 April 1942, in Taren Point, Southern Sydney. In later life, he claimed descent from a certain Ebenezer Patterson, who had been sent to Australia as a convict in the nineteenth century. Little is known of Patterson&#x27;s present-day family beyond from the fact that he has a sister whose name is either Lois or Noreen (sources differ) and a brother named Gerard, who became a clergyman and later served as an Advisor on Religious Affairs to the Lord Howe Island Chamber of Commerce. In a brief memoir published in 2006, Father Gerard Patterson described his brother Les as &quot;the archetypical Australian scallywag&quot;, who had been their mother&#x27;s favourite. Father Patterson further recalled that his brother had a &quot;rough and ready education&quot;. Through the influence of their uncle Leo, both brothers were sent to Melbourne to attend the prestigious Xavier College, although Les remained there for only 1½ terms. Returning to Sydney, he attended Our Lady of Dolours&#x27; Boys School and completed his Intermediate Certificate at Parramatta High School.

Patterson commenced tertiary study at the Kogarah TAFE. Prior to his appointment as Cultural Attaché, he completed what he described as a &quot;five-day crash course in World Culture&quot; at the University of Sydney. Only a few years later, he would receive an honorary doctorate in Australian Studies.

===Personal life===
Although Father Gerard Patterson noted that he and Les had &quot;drifted apart&quot; after he had entered the priesthood, he would later officiate at his brother&#x27;s wedding to Gwenneth Lorraine Dolan, a former hand model. She was a film buff who enjoyed Disney films and, by Sir Les&#x27; own account, they had met at a matinée screening of &quot;Fantasia&quot;. They subsequently had two children, Karen and Craig. Members of the Patterson family have occasionally assisted Sir Les in his business ventures. When he founded the Thursday Island Film Commission in 1978, his wife Lady Gwenneth was appointed as director, his daughter Karen as secretary, and his sister Lois as creative liaison co-ordinator. According to Father Gerard Patterson, Karen later took a position at Our Lady of Dolours School for Ridiculously Slow Learners, in South Sydney, while her brother Craig was employed for the Australian Wheat Board, where, in 2008, his work had &quot;recently attracted unfair publicity&quot;.

In various published sources, Les Patterson listed his hobbies as &quot;pocket billiards and sauna construction in Thailand&quot; (according to a 1995 programme bio) and &quot;wine tasting and infidelity&quot; (according to a 2005 CV).

===Professional life===

* Employee in the Office of Custom and Excise (Literature Division) (1960s)
* Minister for Shark Conservation (1960s)

<doc id="1014424" wikidata="Q752276" url="?curid=1014424" title="Functional food">
<text>A functional food is a food claimed to have an additional (often one related to health promotion or disease prevention) by adding new ingredients or more of existing ingredients. The term may also apply to traits purposely bred into existing edible plants, such as purple or gold potatoes having increased anthocyanin or carotenoid contents, respectively. Functional foods may be &quot;designed to have physiological benefits and/or reduce the risk of chronic disease beyond basic nutritional functions, and may be similar in appearance to conventional food and consumed as part of a regular diet&quot;.

The term was first used in the 1980s in Japan, where there is a government approval process for functional foods called Foods for Specified Health Use (FOSHU).

== Industry ==
The functional food industry, consisting of food, beverage and supplement sectors, is one of the several areas of the food industry that is experiencing fast growth in recent years. It is estimated that the global market of functional food industry will reach 176.7 billion in 2013 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4%. Specifically, the functional food sector will experience 6.9% CAGR, the supplement sector will rise by 3.8% and the functional beverage sector will be the fastest growing segment with 10.8% CAGR. This kind of growth is fueled not only by industrial innovation and development of new products that satisfy the demand of health conscious consumers, but also by health claims covering a wide range of health issues. Yet, consumer skepticism persists mainly because benefits associated with consuming the products may be difficult to detect. Strict examination of some of the functional food claims may discourage some companies from launching their products.

==Functional foods for non-human animals==
===Bees=== 
Honey can contain a range of phytochemicals that may help bees to tolerate cold, resist pesticides and infections, heal wounds, and possibly live longer. Given floral diversity in their pollen sources, bees may have the ability to choose nectar varieties that have positive attributes for health.

<text>Margarete Robsahm (born 9 October 1942) is a Norwegian model, actress and director. She is the mother of director Thomas Robsahm and sister of the actor Fred Robsahm. To an international audience, she is best known for her role in &quot;Castle of Blood&quot; with Barbara Steele, but she has also starred in Norwegian movies, among these &quot;Line&quot; from 1961. The movie was based on a novel by Axel Jensen and caused a minor scandal in Norway at the time, as Robsahm was the first actress ever to expose her breasts in a Norwegian movie.

In March 2008, Robsahm drew media attention for having received NOK 2.3 million over sixteen years in government funding for the arts without having produced a single movie. Although no criticism was levelled at her personally, questions arose regarding the government stipendiary system.

<text>A chondroitin is a chondrin derivative.

Types include:
* Chondroitin sulfate
* Dermatan sulfate

Chondroitin as a supplement is now commonly used (often in combination with glucosamine) in treating the joint disease of osteoarthritis. In contrast to the symptomatic treatments, chondroitin can modify the progression of a disease process in the patient which it can be used as an alternative medicine. Chondroitin&#x27;s effect toward the articular cartilage integrity as it is part of the proteoglycan molecules. The cartilage proteoglycan synthesis can speed up as chondroitin is going through the pathway of the alimentary canal. Research has been conducted to show the effectiveness of chondroitin and results indicate that it helps to manage pain in knee and hip, slow down the progression and also recovery. However, the effectiveness of the drugs is still doubtful.

<doc id="1014437" wikidata="Q925877" url="?curid=1014437" title="Gösta Ekman">
<text>Hans Gösta Gustaf Ekman (; 28 July 1939 – 1 April 2017) was a Swedish actor, comedian, and director.

==Career==
Ekman was born in Stockholm, Sweden, to the Swedish actor and director Hasse Ekman and Agneta (née Wrangel). Ekman represented the third generation in a family of prominent Swedish actors. First in the line was his paternal grandfather, also named Gösta Ekman, followed by his father Hasse Ekman, a successful film director and actor. Ekman&#x27;s theatrical family also included his brothers Stefan Ekman and Mikael Ekman, a stage director, and his niece, Sanna Ekman, an actress. He was married from 1989 to artist and film director Marie-Louise Ekman, previously Marie-Louise De Geer Bergenstråhle, née Fuchs. Ekman sometimes appeared in credits as &quot;Gösta Ekman Jr.&quot; to avoid being confused with his famous grandfather.

He was an assistant director to Per-Axel Branner, Hasse Ekman, Stig Olin, Bengt Ekerot and Ingmar Bergman from 1956 to 1961. Ekman started his acting career in the theaters, such as the Alléteatern from 1956 to 1957, Munkbroteatern in 1959 and the Stockholm City Theatre in 1960. He also appeared in several Swedish films, including the &quot;Jönssonligan&quot; series. He was most famous for his comedic works, especially his collaboration with the comic duo Hasse &amp; Tage on stage and in films—where he often played the leading parts. His body of work, though, included a number of genres, including a series of dramatic police films, in which he played the famous fictional Swedish policeman Martin Beck.

While Ekman officially retired from stage and film work in 2003, he returned in 2005 to play leading parts in his wife&#x27;s two films, &quot;Asta Nilssons sällskap&quot; and &quot;Pingvinresan&quot;. In 2007, he directed the play &quot;Gäckanden&quot; for the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.

==Personal life==
He was married from 1963 to 1974 to Karl Gerhard&#x27;s adopted daughter Fatima Svendsen (born 1944), with whom he had a son, Måns Ekman (born 1964). Subsequently, he was married from 1979 to 1987 to Pia Harahap (born 1955), with whom he had two adopted children. In 1989 he married Marie-Louise Ekman (born 1944). They were married until Gösta Ekman&#x27;s death.

He died on 1 April 2017, at the age of 77 from bile duct cancer.

==Awards and nominations==
Ekman won the Swedish film award Guldbagge Award in 1993 for his role as policeman Martin Beck in the Guldbagge-winning film &quot;The Man on the Balcony&quot;, based on the 1967 novel by Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö. Ekman also won the special Hedersguldbaggen (Honorable Guldbagge) award in 2008 for his service to the Swedish film and theater industry.

<doc id="1014446" wikidata="Q6511624" url="?curid=1014446" title="Lechmere Square">
<text>Lechmere Square ( ) is located at the intersection of Cambridge Street and First Street in East Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was originally named for the Colonial-era landowner Richard Lechmere, a Loyalist who returned to England at the beginning of the American Revolution. His lands were later seized by the new American government. The shoreline is shown as &quot;Lechmere&#x27;s Point&quot; on Revolutionary War maps, and was the landing point for British troops en route to the Battles of Lexington and Concord.

The area was developed by land speculator Andrew Craigie in the early 19th century. Later, a store was founded in the area and named for it. The Lechmere store expanded into a regional chain, which was closed in 1997 as then-parent company Montgomery Ward filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

The area is now best known for the CambridgeSide mall, one of the few full-fledged interior shopping malls within the city limits of Boston and Cambridge, which is on the site of the original Lechmere store (and, when built, incorporated a newly built Lechmere Sales store as one of its anchor tenants). In years past, Lechmere Square was a manufacturing center producing candy, furniture, and caskets.

Lechmere Square and the surrounding East Cambridge are currently undergoing a revival of sorts. The area&#x27;s factories have been or are being converted into office buildings and condominiums. Several large-scale development projects were begun in 2004 and 2005, and as a result East Cambridge and Lechmere Square have undergone a gentrification process similar to what has been seen in other areas of Cambridge.

Lechmere Square is served by Lechmere station of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The former surface-level station closed in May 2020 for construction of the Green Line Extension; a replacement elevated station opened on March 21, 2022.

The Charles River, Lechmere Canal, and Memorial Drive are nearby. Lechmere is also located close to the Museum of Science.

<text>The Overland Limited was one of the named passenger trains on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.

Operating as train Nos. 7 &amp; 8 (sometimes known as the Overland Express) between Chicago, Illinois, and Los Angeles, California, the line was inaugurated in 1901 and ran until the &quot;Santa Fe Eight&quot; took over the route in 1915. First-class trains included a diner, while second-class trains stopped along the way at Fred Harvey Company eating houses.

Horse Sand Fort was designed by Captain E. H. Stewart, overseen by Assistant Inspector General of Fortifications, Colonel W. F. D. Jervois. Construction work began in 1865, and the fort was completed in 1880, long after the threat of a seaborne invasion from France had passed, at a cost of £424,694.

The original armament was to have been forty five 10-inch and 44 12.5-inch rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns on the gun floors with 10 12-inch RMLs mounted on the roof in five turrets. In fact the turrets were never built and the limited space meant the 12.5-inch guns had to be operated with less than full charges of powder. In 1882, 12-inch rifled breech-loading guns were placed in alternate bays.

Horse Sand Fort was built on a ring of masonry consisting of large concrete blocks with an outer skin of granite blocks, the interior being filled with clay and shingle and covered with a thick layer of concrete. The lower foundation walls of the fort are thick. The fort is split into three levels with the top measuring in diameter. The floors would have originally provided storage of armoury and guns and the things needed to sustain the men that were stationed on site. The top of the fort consisted of a lighthouse and various chimneys and ventilators. The fort has its own artesian well which provided fresh water. The seaward side of the fort was covered in a heavy iron-armoured plating to protect it from seaborne attack. Access to the fort was by a wooden-decked landing stage supported on cast-iron piles.

In the late 19th century the Solent forts were painted in a black and white chequered paint scheme as an early form of dazzle camouflage. In its unrestored state remains of this pattern are still visible on parts of Horse Sand Fort.

Beginning in 1908, extensive submerged defences were built in the form of large concrete blocks running about below sea level from the fort to the shore at Southsea. With only two narrow gaps to allow small craft to pass through, this barrier (and a much shorter one running south from No Man&#x27;s Land Fort towards Ryde Sands) remains as the cost of demolition is deemed too high. A 2020 report stated that during the WW II, &quot;the forts were used to defend the Portsmouth dockyards. Life on site was grim; those serving were deliberately chosen for their inability to swim, to avoid any attempt to escape&quot;.

In March 2012, the fort was purchased by Clarenco LLP (previously known as Amazing Retreats) (which also owned No Man&#x27;s Land Fort and Spitbank Fort) and was to be converted into a museum. In 2015, it was reported that Clarenco planned to open Horse Sand Fort for public use the following year, but that did not occur and by 2019, it was expected that Horse Sand, No Man&#x27;s Land Fort and Spitbank Fort would be put up for auction.

An October 2018 report stated that restoration work on Horse Sands Fort was delayed &quot;by the presence of a resident family of peregrine falcons&quot;. In 2020, all three Clarenco-owned Forts were listed for sale. A news item stated that Horse Sand Fort was &quot;a blank canvas, with 100 chambers and living quarters, plus the original gun carriage&quot;. In October 2021, it was announced that the fort had been sold to an unnamed buyer for £715,000.

==In popular culture==
In January 2015, the BBC TV programme &quot;Antiques Road Trip&quot; included a clip of a visit to the fort.

<text>Sir William Brooke O&#x27;Shaughnessy (from 1861 as William O&#x27;Shaughnessy Brooke) (October 1809 – 8 January 1889) was an Irish physician famous for his wide-ranging scientific work in pharmacology, chemistry, and inventions related to telegraphy and its use in India. His medical research led to the development of intravenous therapy and introduced the therapeutic use of medical cannabis to Western medicine.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Shaughnessy was born at Limerick in 1809 to Daniel O&#x27;Shaughnessy and Sarah Boswell. His mother was a Protestant and many in the family were clergymen. An uncle of his was the Dean of Ennis and a great uncle the Roman Catholic Bishop of Killaloe. William studied briefly at Trinity College, Dublin matriculating in 1825 but moved to Scotland before graduating. O&#x27;Shaughnessy studied forensic toxicology and chemistry in Scotland, and graduated in 1829 with an MD from the University of Edinburgh Medical School. In 1829 he was a clinical assistant of William Alison. In 1831, at the age of 22, as a result of his analysis of the blood of cholera victims, O&#x27;Shaughnessy laid the foundation, along with Thomas Aitchison Latta, for what was to become intravenous fluid and electrolyte-replacement therapy in the treatment of cholera. O&#x27;Shaughnessy analyzed the urine and blood of cholera patients and came to the conclusion that oxygen in the blood could reverse the actions. He found the blood deficient in water, salt, and &quot;free alkali&quot; and suggested that injecting salts would help. The method used by O&#x27;Shaughnessy on a dog and was developed further by Latta.

O&#x27;Shaughnessy failed to obtain a position Professor of Medical Jurisprudence in the University of London and his first marriage forced him to join the service of the British East India Company on 8 August 1833 and he moved to Calcutta, remaining in India and serving initially at Gyah and Cuttack before joining the 72nd Bengal Native Infantry. He joined the 10th Regiment Bengal Light Cavalry in 1835 and was an assistant to the Opium Agent in Bihar till 5 August 1835 when he became Professor of the medical college in Calcutta. He served on the committee of the Materia Medica until 1840 and later was Chemical Examiner to the government. As chemical examiner he developed methods for forensic studies for detecting arsenic poisoning as well as botanical toxins (such as from &quot;Plumbago&quot; used as an abortifacient). He went on furlough to England in 1841 to 1844 and returned to join as Chemical Examiner and additionally as Deputy Assay Master of the Calcutta Mint.

==Work in India==

His first stint in India was marked by work in the subjects of botanical pharmacology, chemistry, galvanic electricity, and underwater conduction, among others. He worked on modifications to the Daniell cell and the use of tanned leather semi-permeable membranes in them. He identified the use of zinc to reduce the rusting of iron before the process of galvanizing had been established. O&#x27;Shaughnessy also analyzed the gun-cotton developed by Christian Friedrich Schönbein and recognized the role of nitrogen and correctly identified the role of sulphuric acid in removing water from the cotton. He also developed a silver chloride electrode and experimented on adding colour tones to the Daguerre photographic process. At Calcutta, he was a member of the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta, where he published one of his first papers on medical applications of cannabis. He validated folk uses of cannabis in India, discovered new applications, and ultimately recommended cannabis for a great variety of therapeutic purposes. O&#x27;Shaughnessy established his reputation by successfully relieving the pain of rheumatism and stilling the convulsions of an infant with cannabis. He eventually popularized its use back in England. His most famous success came when he quelled the wrenching muscle spasm of tetanus and rabies with resin. While he could not cure tetanus, he observed that the cannabis mixture reduced their symptoms of spasticity and their suffering. In 1837 he published his independent design of an electric motor. In 1839, O&#x27;Shaughnessy conducted experiments on an experimental telegraphy system that he set up in the Botanical Garden at Calcutta with the assistance of Nathaniel Wallich. A length of 22 miles of wire was laid by zigzagging them over bamboo posts. In 1841, he returned to England, where he introduced &quot;Cannabis indica&quot; to Western medicine and continued his scientific writings. He was a member of the London Electrical Society and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 16 March 1843. The Candidature for Election to Fellow of the Royal Society stated that he was &quot;distinguished for his acquaintance with the science of Medicine and Chemistry, eminent as a Physician and as a promoter of education among the natives of Bengal&quot;. O&#x27;Shaughnessy was a supporter of the idea of education in native languages in medicine. He also wanted locally available sources of medicine to be utilized to provide inexpensive aid. As a teacher, he took students on field trips to the Botanical Garden to introduce them to the local medicinal plants. In 1837 he prepared a &quot;Manual of Chemistry&quot; of which a thousand copies were printed for use in Calcutta. A second edition was produced in 1842. Another major book was the &quot;Bengal Dispensatory and Pharmacopeia&quot; which included an appendix on the &quot;improvement of Bengal pottery&quot; (1840) since earthenware imports from Europe were proving to be expensive. The &quot;Bengal Dispensatory&quot; included descriptions of several plant species that were made or overseen by Wallich including those of &quot;Abelmoschus longifolius&quot;, &quot;Pharbitis caerulea&quot;, &quot;Hebradendron pictorium&quot; and &quot;Garcinia pictoria&quot;. These descriptions have often been overlooked by botanists in the past.

==Return to India==
In 1844, O&#x27;Shaughnessy returned to India, where he worked in various government positions in the fields of pharmacology and assay. Lord Dalhousie became interested in the establishment of a telegraphic network and he learnt of the work of O&#x27;Shaugnessy and found that he could work on the scheme. Dalhousie informed the Military Board that O&#x27;Shaugnessy was to work directly under Dalhousie&#x27;s supervision and report directly without any other intermediary authorities. During this period he began work on various telegraph instruments and systems. After briefly returning to England in 1852, O&#x27;Shaughnessy was appointed Superintendent of Telegraphs in 1852. During the years 1853-5 3500 miles of telegraph were installed across India and he wrote numerous manuals and reports on his telegraph inventions. O&#x27;Shaughnessy was on leave in England during the mutiny year but in the same year Morse code was introduced into India and a message from Delhi to Punjab helped in moving troops in time. In 1858 a cable was laid in the Gulf of Mannar between India and Ceylon. O&#x27;Shaughnessy introduced a coil of fine wire in the circuit to protect the cables from lightning. His successor in the telegraphs department, Charles Adley, became a fierce critic of O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s work.

==Knighthood and return to England==
In 1856 he was knighted by Queen Victoria for his work on the telegraph in India. He was appointed Director-General of Telegraphs at this time. During the following years O&#x27;Shaughnessy wrote on telegraphy-related subjects, including a book of private codes for encrypted telegraphy. In 1860, O&#x27;Shaughnessy returned to Europe for sick leave where he remained in obscurity until his death from senile asthenia at Southsea on 8 January 1889. He was buried at Highland Road Cemetery, Portsmouth.

He adopted the surname Brooke by Royal Licence in 1861 on the death of a relative. He was married three times. His second wife was the daughter of Francis O&#x27;Shaughnessy and his third was Julia Greenly, daughter of Captain Sabine.

<doc id="1014467" wikidata="Q2069406" url="?curid=1014467" title="Brazil for Christ Pentecostal Church">
<text>The Brazil for Christ Pentecostal Church (Portuguese: &quot;Igreja Pentecostal O Brasil para Cristo&quot;) is a Pentecostal denomination founded in Brazil in the 1950s.

==Early history==
This denomination was founded by Manoel de Mello (1929–1990), a construction worker who called himself &quot;Missionary&quot;. Mello came to São Paulo from the semi-arid and impoverished state of Pernambuco, and in São Paulo Mello converted in the Assemblies of God, but soon accepted the Healing movement at that time named National Evangelism Crusade, today Foursquare Gospel Church in Brazil.

==Influence of Manoel de Mello==
In 1956 Manoel de Mello started his own church, the &quot;Igreja Pentecostal Brasil para Cristo&quot; (IBPC) (&quot;Brazil for Christ&quot; Church). Even though he was without a formal education, Mello was an eloquent preacher, using radio to spread his message, and his program, &quot;The Voice of Brazil for Christ&quot;, lasted on the air for two decades. He held meetings of healing and miracles in public squares and soccer stadiums. The IBPC grew mostly in poor, working-class neighborhoods in east São Paulo, populated mainly by immigrants from Northeast Brazil. The IPBC reached a nationwide presence in Brazil, though it is timidly present in foreign lands. Small regional Pentecostal movements were added to the IPBC, but also many people left this movement to start their own denominations, like the God is Love Pentecostal Church, and the House of Blessing Church. For a period of time, the IPBC was a member of the World Council of Churches. In 1986 Mello left the direction of his church and died four years later in 1990. The IBPC lost its impetus to the new charismatic movements, passed by internal problems, and lost many members to other churches, such as the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God.

==Contemporary history==
The &quot;Brazil for Christ&quot; Church has today a significant presence in Brazil, with more than 1,000 churches, and some foreign work in Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Portugal, and in the United States.

<text>John Wodehouse, 2nd Earl of Kimberley (10 December 1848 - 7 January 1932), known as Lord Wodehouse from 1866 to 1902, was a British peer and landowner, who was the first member of the Labour Party in the House of Lords.

Wodehouse was born at the family home in Montagu Square, Marylebone. His father John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley was a leading Liberal statesman in the government of William Ewart Gladstone and the family were noted landowners in Norfolk. Like his father he attended Eton College.

He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1867. On going down from Cambridge he managed the family estates near Wymondham, becoming a specialist in agriculture. He was also active in the local Liberal Party, acting as party agent; on succeeding to the peerage in 1902 he took the Liberal whip. However, Kimberley was conscious of the increasing organisation of agricultural workers in Norfolk. Small farmers had formed the National Farmers Union in 1908, and the National Union of Agricultural Workers was growing.

Unlike many other farms, Kimberley paid over the wage rate demanded by the NUAW, which made him very popular in the union but at a competitive disadvantage. He spoke up for his workers on Norfolk County Council. The agricultural workers in Norfolk were the backbone of the local Labour Party, and in the general election of 1918, Kimberley sent a telegram of support to the Labour candidate in South Norfolk who was opposing a Liberal who supported the Lloyd George Coalition government. He sent a further telegram in 1920 when there was a by-election which Labour won. This activity caused the press to nickname him &quot;the Labour Earl&quot;.

Kimberley was returned as a Labour candidate to Norfolk County Council in 1922, and was also Chairman of his Rural District Council and Board of Guardians. However, at this time there were no Labour members in the House of Lords and so he retained the Liberal whip. He transferred his allegiance formally in January 1924 when the first Labour government was formed. He was defeated for re-election to Norfolk County Council in 1925.

Kimberley was a distant cousin of the writer P. G. Wodehouse, both being descended from Sir Armine Wodehouse, 5th Baronet, and the writer was the godfather of his first grandson, the fourth earl.

Two of Kimberley&#x27;s sons, Philip Wodehouse and Edward Wodehouse, died on active service in the Great War. His eldest son John, a noted polo player, inherited the earldom on his death.

<text>Kevin Brereton (born February 20, 1972), better known by his stage name k-os (; &quot;chaos&quot;), is a Canadian alternative rapper, singer, songwriter and producer. His given name may also be cited as Kheaven, a spelling he later adopted.

The alias &quot;k-os&quot;, spelled with a lower case &quot;k&quot;, was intended to be less aggressive than the pseudonyms of other rappers whose names were all upper case, such as KRS-One. It is an acronym for &quot;Knowledge of Self&quot;, although in a later interview he said that it originally stood for &quot;Kevin&#x27;s Original Sound&quot;. k-os&#x27; music incorporates a wide variety of music genres, including rap, funk, rock, and reggae. The lyrics frequently focus on promoting a &quot;positive message&quot; while at times expressing criticism of mainstream hip hop culture&#x27;s obsession with money, fame and glorification of violence.
A musician as well as a producer, k-os has written and produced nearly every part of all four of his albums. k-os usually performs with a live band, which is traditionally uncommon in the hip hop genre. He sometimes plays guitar and keyboard both during live performances and in the studio.

k-os received his first musical exposure with the single &quot;Musical Essence&quot;, released in 1995. After the release of his second single &quot;Rise Like the Sun&quot; in 1996, he withdrew from the industry because he was dissatisfied with his musical style. He reappeared briefly in 1999 and released his debut album &quot;Exit&quot; in 2002. The album received positive reviews but sold relatively few copies. He released his second album &quot;Joyful Rebellion&quot; in 2004, which received platinum status in Canada. A third album, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2006 and also went platinum. His fourth album, &quot;Yes!&quot;, was released in 2009. His fifth album &quot;Black on Blonde&quot; was released in 2013. He released his sixth album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Fly Without Gravity&quot;, in 2015. From 1996 to 2016, K-os was the third best-selling Canadian hip hop artist in Canada (behind Drake and Swollen Members).

==Early life and childhood==
k-os was born at St. Michael&#x27;s Hospital in Toronto. He and his two younger brothers Joshua and Andrew Richard were raised by Trinidadian Jehovah&#x27;s Witness parents. His father was a minister at two congregations in the Greater Toronto Area. k-os moved along with his family to Trinidad while he was in grade three. In Trinidad, k-os surrounded himself with music to deal with being away from Canada. He returned to Canada with his mother in his teen years, taking up residence in Whitby, Ontario, a town east of Toronto, while attending Anderson Collegiate Vocational Institute. His father temporarily stayed behind in Trinidad to continue his work. His father worked as a computer engineer and became Director of Communications for BWIA, the national Trinidadian airline, while his mother owned a cosmetics company.

Growing up, k-os was a fan of artists and groups as diverse as New Order, Depeche Mode, Rx Bandits, Michael Jackson, Boogie Down Productions, Slick Rick, A Tribe Called Quest, and The Beatles. He said that he was &quot;insecure&quot; in high school and he pursued his musical ambitions because after performing at an assembly in his high school gym he realized performing attracted people towards him and it made him feel &quot;powerful and ... secure&quot;. In 1992, he attended Carleton University in Ottawa for one semester to please his father. He returned to Toronto and enrolled into York University. Being friends with Nigel Williams, a member of the band Pocket Dwellers, Nigel encouraged k-os to continue to develop his musical abilities when he was confronted with &quot;difficult forays&quot;.

==Music career ==
===Early career===
While attending York University, k-os gained his first exposure in the music industry in 1995 when he released the single &quot;Musical Essence&quot; with a music video financed by a VideoFACT grant. He dropped out of the university shortly afterwards. The single was produced with friends Clarence Gruff and Kevin Risto; currently, Risto is one half of the production duo known as Midi Mafia (produced the 50 Cent single &quot;21 Questions&quot;). After winning a MuchMusic Video Award for the single, k-os was noticed by NBA player John Salley, who became his manager. With the single gaining moderate success, k-os was invited to perform in the 1995 &quot;Hip-Hop Explosion Tour&quot;, with other Canadian acts such as Rascalz and Ghetto Concept. Salley and Raphael Saadiq began work with k-os on his planned debut &quot;Missing Links&quot;, eventually releasing his second single &quot;Rise Like the Sun&quot; in 1996. k-os suddenly withdrew from the music industry in 1996 after receiving an offer from BMG. k-os would later say that during this time he had already completed several albums but was dissatisfied with his music. He described his music as &quot;pretentious and derivative,&quot; and stated at the time that he was &quot;still trying to figure out who he was.&quot;

He continued to live with his manager Salley in Los Angeles. Soon after, Red1 of the Rascalz, whom k-os befriended at the 1995 &quot;Explosion Tour&quot;, invited him to move to Vancouver, British Columbia. There he contributed a verse and chorus lines to the Rascalz&#x27; &quot;Global Warning&quot; album, released in 1999. He had also been invited to contribute to Rascalz&#x27; groundbreaking single &quot;Northern Touch&quot;, but was unable to participate due to other commitments. k-os returned to the music scene by performing at the North by Northeast music festival in 1999. He took stage with the Vancouver band Namedropper.

Inspired by Michael Jackson, A Tribe Called Quest, The Beatles, The Roots and Stevie Wonder, k-os worked on a new debut album. He described his new musical focus on &quot;doing stuff really obscure and making music for myself.&quot;
He recorded a demo tape and began looking for a record company to sign with, eventually settling on Capitol Records. Later, the parent company EMI transferred his record deal to another label, Astralwerks, co-owned by Virgin Records, after some management and scheduling issues.
After the transfer k-os was added to the roster of the Toronto-based artist management firm &quot;Chris Smith Management&quot;.

===2002–2003===
On March 26, 2002, k-os released his debut album &quot;Exit&quot; in Canada to critical acclaim. The United States release followed the next year on January 28, 2003. The album incorporated several music styles, and was described as a &quot;carefully blended pastiche of hip-hop, soul, rock, R&amp;B, and a touch of reggae&quot; by &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;.
&quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; called the album &quot;One of the finest hip-hop records Canada has ever produced.&quot;
The first single and promotional track for the album was &quot;Heaven Only Knows&quot;. Like the &quot;Musical Essence&quot; single, the video for &quot;Heaven Only Knows&quot; was sponsored by a VideoFACT grant. The second single, &quot;Superstarr Pt. Zero&quot;, was then released, which won &quot;Best Music Video&quot; award at the 2003 Urban X-Posure Awards.

After the Canadian release of the album, k-os toured with India Arie across United States to promote his album. Despite receiving positive reviews, &quot;Exit&quot; sold only 40,000 albums in the U.S.
and 27,000 in Canada according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album went on to win several music awards including the &quot;Album Design of the Year&quot; award at the Juno Awards of 2003. k-os won the &quot;Best International Hip Hop Artist&quot; award at the Source Awards the same year. k-os also appeared and performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! In 2003, k-os collaborated with The Chemical Brothers on their single &quot;Get Yourself High&quot;. The track was nominated for &quot;Best Dance Recording&quot; at the 2005 Grammy Awards. k-os said, on the show &quot;profile&quot; on mtv, that The Chemical Brothers sent him 5 tracks and he picked the one they wanted him to pick (&quot;Get Yourself High&quot;) and he freestyled to it. In the same year, the song &quot;Freeze&quot; was featured in the songlist for SSX 3.

===2004–2005===

Despite suggesting that &quot;Exit&quot; might be his only album,
k-os released his second album &quot;Joyful Rebellion&quot; on August 24, 2004. The album was well received and became platinum in Canada in February 2005.
The album and the second album single, &quot;Crabbuckit&quot;, were rated the most downloaded &quot;Hip Hop/Rap&quot; album and track on the iTunes Store in Canada upon their release. The album also earned the number two spot on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Karen Bliss&#x27;s top ten album list for 2004, where she described the artist as a &quot;destined superstar.&quot;
The album maintained the same formula as &quot;Exit&quot;; k-os himself later described &quot;Joyful Rebellion&quot; as, to quote the Canadian Press, &quot;a rant against the state of hip hop&quot;.
&quot;Joyful Rebellion&quot; featured a total of six singles. The debut single, &quot;B-Boy Stance&quot;, was followed by &quot;Crabbuckit&quot;, &quot;Man I Used to Be&quot;, and &quot;The Love Song&quot;, each accompanied by a music video. The radio exclusive titles &quot;Crucial&quot; and &quot;Dirty Water&quot; were released shortly after. The single &quot;Crabbuckit&quot; went on to be nominated three times at the 2005 Canadian Radio Music Awards.

k-os was nominated four times at the 2004 Canadian Urban Music Awards and won two awards for the single &quot;B-Boy Stance&quot;. In 2005, k-os received three Juno Awards for the album. In the same year, the single &quot;Crabbuckit&quot; won the &quot;Best Pop Video&quot; award out of four nominations while &quot;Man I Used to Be&quot; won &quot;MuchVibe Best Rap Video&quot;, &quot;Best Director&quot; and &quot;Best Cinematography&quot; at the annual MuchMusic Video Awards. He won the &quot;Best Songwriter&quot; and &quot;Fan Choice Award&quot; at the 2005 Canadian Urban Music Awards. On November 15, 2005, k-os released the &quot;Publicity Stunt&quot; DVD. The DVD featured singles and concert footage dating back to 1998 and footage from the 2005 concert at the Molson Amphitheatre, Canada&#x27;s highest attended Hip Hop concert.
According to the Canadian Recording Industry Association, the DVD became platinum in February 2006 in Canada.

In a relatively quiet dispute, some lyrics from the single &quot;B-Boy Stance&quot; were interpreted as an insult on the Toronto-based rapper K&#x27;naan. In the single, k-os rapped &quot;They took cameras to Africa for pictures to rhyme/Over; Oh, yes, the great pretenders&quot;, and &quot;Religious entertainers who want to be life savers&quot;. K&#x27;naan interpreted the lyrics as being aimed at him filming the music video for the single &quot;Soobax&quot; in Kenya. Friends say that k-os was simply expressing ideas about the LoveMovement (his videproduction team) who shot the video in Kenya and ex manager Sol guy who was managing K&#x27;naan at the time. k-os has been said to believe that hip hop allows friends to express their ideas to each other via song. He was very puzzled by Knaan&#x27;s personal &#x27;public&#x27; angle on the lyrics of &quot;B-Boy Stance&quot; especially because his song Revolutionary Avocado came after Knaan&#x27;s repeated efforts to collaborate with k-os. Later on k-os told younger brother Josh that he believed it was a way for K&#x27;naan to &#x27;get attention&#x27; very close to the release date of his album and that Sol guy, who k-os left to be managed by &quot;Chris Smith Management&quot;, pit the two against each other

K&#x27;naan responded in the song &quot;Revolutionary Avocado&quot; with the lyrics: &quot;You the all-knowing with a beer bottle/Wishing you was Plato and me Aristotle?/...Suburban negro turned hip-hop hero/Is there a reason he really hates me, though?&quot; Furthermore, K&#x27;naan stated in an interview that he thought &quot;k-os was out of line&quot;. The two have since spoken and there is no conflict.

===2006===
Early in 2006, k-os collaborated with the CBC Radio Orchestra to compose &quot;Burning to Shine.&quot;
A documentary produced by new media pioneer McLean Greaves chronicling the production and performance of the song aired on Canadian national television on February 2, 2006, and was titled after the song. k-os then traveled across Canada recording his third album, stopping mainly in Toronto, Vancouver and Halifax. In the proceeding summer, the first single from the upcoming album titled &quot;ELEctrick Heat – the seekwiLL&quot; was released. The single became the &quot;#1 most downloaded Single of the Week&quot; on iTunes. During the year, k-os also recorded a version of John Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; for the &quot;Make Some Noise&quot; campaign of the human rights organization Amnesty International.

Before the release of his third album, &quot;Atlantis: Hymns For Disco&quot;, k-os wrote derogatory comments on his Myspace page aimed at Jason Richards, a contributing writer at Toronto&#x27;s &quot;NOW&quot; magazine, for his review of the album. k-os stated that he was angered by Richards referring to him in the review as a &quot;crossover pop artist disguised as a true-school b-boy&quot;. He was also disillusioned when he remembered he had granted an interview to Richards when he was a teenager, and that they had similar small town Trinidadian upbringings. Nervousness about the experimental nature of &quot;Atlantis&quot; and the passive aggressiveness of Canadian media most likely led to his blow up.
Part of the comment called Richards &quot;a black man ... manipulated by his indie rock nerd bosses&quot; and called on him to &quot;eat a dick!&quot; NOW says that k-os called Richards &quot;a &#x27;sambo&#x27; beholden to his &#x27;white indie rock nerd bosses&#x27;&quot; in October 2006.
After receiving advice from a psychologist on Myspace k-os later removed the comments, stating in an interview that it was a &quot;personal situation&quot;
between himself and Richards and he was angered because the two had previously &quot;had many discussions on music&quot;. 

k-os&#x27; comments also received attention from the lead vocalist of the band Danko Jones, who wrote to NOW magazine saying that k-os &quot;had too much sunshine massaged up his ass&quot;.
k-os responded to the letter, making sarcastic remarks discussing a band named &quot;STANKO JONES&quot;, which referred to Danko Jones. He also remarked again upon Jason Richards, comparing him to the &quot;Arnold Jackson&quot; character played by Gary Coleman on the sitcom &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;. Jones stated in an interview that he thought k-os&#x27; comments were a &quot;lame response&quot;, and that &quot;a five-year-old could come up with something wittier&quot;. k-os and Danko shared a rehearsal space and often had in depth conversations during their breaks outside the rehearsal space. He was very disappointed that someone whom he considered a friend spoke out in the press before trying to contact him first.

On October 10, 2006, &quot;Atlantis: Hymns For Disco&quot; was released in Canada, with a global release scheduled on February 6, 2007. The album went platinum in Canada during December of the same year.
Atlantis, written and produced by k-os, featured collaborations with Sam Roberts and Buck 65. The album debuted as number one and number five on the &quot;Digital Albums&quot; and &quot;Current Albums&quot; Canadian charts, respectively. The album reached number five on Music World&#x27;s top ten in its opening week.
While the album continued to merge several musical genres, k-os described the album as being more vocal due to him becoming more comfortable with his singing voice.
&quot;Atlantis&quot; was also described as leaving behind the &quot;social commentaries&quot; and hip hop critique present on his last two albums.
Subsequent singles are &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; and &quot;Flypaper&quot;. ESPN&#x27;s Sunday NFL Countdown has used the chorus of &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; as an intro returning from commercial break the past two seasons. k-os was one of the top 3 nominees for the Juno Awards of 2007 with five nominations, but failed to win any.

===2007–2010===
His fourth studio album, entitled &quot;Yes!&quot;, was released on April 14, 2009. Four singles were released from the album. They were &quot;4, 3, 2, 1&quot;, &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, &quot;I Wish I Knew Natalie Portman&quot; and &quot;Zambony&quot;.

k-os also held an online contest from 2008 to 2009 at Indaba Music in which he provided the public with 11 tracks from the album &quot;Yes!&quot; to be remixed. At the end of the contest, the most voted remixes of each song were selected to be on a remix album of &quot;Yes!&quot; entitled &quot;Yes It&#x27;s Yours (Fan Remix Album)&quot;, which is set to be released in the spring of 2009. The 11 contest winners were also awarded $1,000 each.

In April 2009, k-os began the Karma Tour across Canada. For this tour, no advance tickets were sold. Fans were simply asked to donate what they think the show was worth as they leave the venue.

In October 2009, k-os paired up with the Stephen Lewis Foundation and their campaign A Dare to Remember to raise money for HIV/AIDS affected families in Africa. The musician will return to his old job at The Bay and will help customers select toys in the store&#x27;s toy department.

In November 2009, Need for Speed Nitro was released. k-os&#x27;s song &quot;Fun&quot; was featured on the soundtrack, along with the likes of Taking Back Sunday, Rye Rye, Major Lazer, and others.

On February 28, 2010, k-os performed at the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony in Vancouver. On August 9, 2010, k-os released a follow-up mixtape to &quot;Yes!&quot;, entitled &quot;The Anchorman Mixtape&quot;. Mainly recorded on his tour bus, it featured leftover tracks from &quot;Yes!&quot;, as well as new tracks.

===2011–2013===
On October 4, 2011, in Canada, Much Music released his March 30, 2011 &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; concert recordings at the Masonic Temple in Toronto as &quot;MuchMusic presents K-OS LIVE&quot;, that also includes a DVD of all the live performances. The CD portion of the release additionally included &quot;Catch 22&quot;, &quot;Faith Part 2&quot; featuring Drake, and two versions of &quot;Holy Cow&quot;.

On October 30, 2012, k-os announced via Facebook that the album release date would have to be pushed back due to &quot;sample clearance issues&quot;. He went on to mention that a sample from Neil Young was taking longer than expected to clear. On November 5, 2012, K-OS announced the release date for his double LP entitled, &quot;Black on Blonde&quot; via Twitter and Facebook. A November 13, 2012 pre-order via iTunes was also announced. The first single off the album &quot;The Dog Is Mine&quot; was released on iTunes on September 18, 2012. The follow-up single &quot;Nyce 2 Know Ya&quot; was released on iTunes on October 9, 2012, and peaked at number 47 on the Canadian Hot 100. On January 29, 2013, &quot;Black on Blonde&quot; was released and charted at number 16 on the Canadian Albums Chart.

===2014–present===
k-os&#x27; latest album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Fly Without Gravity,&quot; was released in September 2015.

He followed it up with mixtape &quot;Views From the Stix&quot; which was a surprise released on May 20, 2016, ahead of the Victoria Day holiday in Canada. The mixtape was produced when k-os visited his family&#x27;s countryside home near Whitby, Ont., about thirty minutes outside Toronto. The title is a direct reference to &quot;Views from the Six&quot;, the original title of Drake&#x27;s album &quot;Views&quot; (2016).

In 2018, k-os released a new single titled &quot;No Bucks&quot; along with the music video.

On May 29, 2020, k-os released an EP called &quot;Boshido&quot;, a collaboration effort with producer Kaytranada. It contains a remix to &quot;Crucial&quot;, previously released on Kaytranada&#x27;s SoundCloud in 2013.

<doc id="1014470" wikidata="Q8077214" url="?curid=1014470" title="Åsa-Nisse">
<text>Åsa-Nisse is a Swedish literary character created by Stig Cederholm. The character first appeared in the weekly magazine Tidsfördrif in 1944, and later in a series of 20 films, produced between 1949 and 1969. In 1960 it also became a comic series, which is still produced and published periodically in its own magazine. A new Åsa-Nisse film was released in 2011.

== Concept ==
The character Åsa-Nisse, literally &quot;Nils on the Ridge&quot; or &quot;Ridge-Nisse&quot;, is a somewhat elderly man living with his wife &quot;Eulalia&quot; on a farm in the countryside village of Knohult in Småland. To the dismay of his wife, Åsa-Nisse never really seems to produce an honest day&#x27;s work, and instead his activities seem to focus on various antics where he is accompanied by his friend and side-kick &quot;Klabbarparn&quot;. One of their favourite activities is poaching, while managing to stay one step ahead of the law, personified by the local policeman. Other characters include &quot;Knohultarn&quot; and &quot;Sjökvist&quot;, the local merchant. Much of the humor, particularly in the original stories, is derived from the characters&#x27; peculiar dialect.

== Adaptations ==

=== Comics===

In 1944 the character was adapted into a comic strip drawn by Gösta Gummesson, with dialogue written by various authors including Gits Olsson, Bengt Linder, Leif Bergendorff, Olle Nilsson and Pidde Andersson.

=== Films ===
The character has also been adapted into a popular series of burlesque comedy films.

John Elfström portrayed Åsa-Nisse in 19 of the 20 films and Arthur Rolén played the side-kick Klabbarparn (Ågren) in 18. Brita Öberg played Åsa-Nisse&#x27;s wife Eulalia and Mona Geijer-Falkner played Klabbarparn&#x27;s wife Kristin. Fourteen of the films were directed by Ragnar Frisk. In ten of the films, Bertil Boo made an appearance as &quot;the singing farmer&quot;.

Kjell Bergqvist plays Åsa-Nisse in the 2011 reboot film &quot;Åsa-Nisse – wälkom to Knohult&quot;. This is the first Åsa-Nisse film since 1969.

===Musical===

The novels have also been adapted into a stage musical.

== Reputation ==
While the 19 film sequels are a testament to Åsa-Nisse&#x27;s popularity the movies have always been panned by critics both then and now. Some even see it as a low point in Swedish cinema that works as a stark contrast to Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s work of the same period. Their style of humour is now out of fashion but re-runs are still frequent on TV and they have been released on VHS and DVD.

<text>naim is a messaging and chat program written by Daniel Reed in C; it supports the protocols AIM, ICQ, IRC, and RPI&#x27;s Lily CMC protocols. Unlike most messaging clients, it is not graphical; it runs from the console using the ncurses library. naim is free software, licensed under the GNU GPL.

naim is a multiplatform program. It is primarily aimed at Unix-like systems.

naim uses the AOL instant messenger TOC protocol instead of the OSCAR protocol. This means naim lacks some features other instant messaging services have.

<text>Cotransporters are a subcategory of membrane transport proteins (transporters) that couple the favorable movement of one molecule with its concentration gradient and unfavorable movement of another molecule against its concentration gradient. They enable coupled or cotransport (secondary active transport) and include antiporters and symporters. In general, cotransporters consist of two out of the three classes of integral membrane proteins known as transporters that move molecules and ions across biomembranes. Uniporters are also transporters but move only one type of molecule down its concentration gradient and are not classified as cotransporters.

==Background==

Cotransporters are capable of moving solutes either up or down gradients at rates of 1,000 to 100,000 molecules per second. They may act as channels or transporters, depending on conditions under which they are assayed. The movement occurs by binding to two molecules or ions at a time and using the gradient of one solute&#x27;s concentration to force the other molecule or ion against its gradient. Some studies show that cotransporters can function as ion channels, contradicting the classical models. For instance, the wheat HKT1 transporter shows two modes of transport by the same protein.

Cotransporters can be classified as antiporters and symporters. Both use electric potential and/or chemical gradients to move protons and ions against their concentration gradient. In plants the proton is considered a secondary substance, and high proton concentration in the apoplast powers the inward movement of certain ions by symporters. A proton gradient moves the ions into the vacuole by the proton-sodium antiporter or the proton-calcium antiporter. In plants, sucrose transport is distributed throughout the plant by the proton-pump where the pump creates a gradient of protons so that there are many more on one side of the membrane than the other. As the protons diffuse back across the membrane, the free energy liberated by this diffusion is used to co-transport sucrose. In mammals, glucose is transported through sodium dependent glucose transporters, which use energy in this process. Here, since both glucose and sodium are transported in the same direction across the membrane, they would be classified as symporters. The glucose transporter system was first hypothesized by Dr. Robert K. Crane in 1960, this is discussed later in the article.

==History==
Dr. Robert K. Crane, a Harvard graduate, had been working in the field of carbohydrate biochemistry for quite some time. His experience in the areas of glucose-6-phosphate biochemistry, carbon dioxide fixation, hexokinase and phosphate studies led him to hypothesize cotransport of glucose along with sodium through the intestine. Pictured right is of Dr. Crane and his drawing of the cotransporter system he proposed in 1960, at the international meet on membrane transport and metabolism. His studies were confirmed by other groups and are now used as the classical model to understand cotransporters.

==Mechanism==
Antiporters and symporters both transport two or more different types of molecules at the same time in a coupled movement. An energetically unfavored movement of one molecule is combined with an energetically favorable movement of another molecule(s) or ion(s) to provide the power needed for transport. This type of transport is known as secondary active transport and is powered by the energy derived from the concentration gradient of the ions/molecules across the membrane the cotransporter protein is integrated within.

Cotransporters undergo a cycle of conformational changes by linking the movement of an ion with its concentration gradient (downhill movement) to the movement of a cotransported solute against its concentration gradient (uphill movement). In one conformation the protein will have the binding site (or sites in the case of symporters) exposed to one side of the membrane. Upon binding of both the molecule which is to be transported uphill and the molecule to be transported downhill a conformational change will occur. This conformational change will expose the bound substrates to the opposite side of the membrane, where the substrates will disassociate. Both the molecule and the cation must be bound in order for the conformational change to occur. This mechanism was first introduced by Oleg Jardetzky in 1966. This cycle of conformational changes only transports one substrate ion at a time, which results in a fairly slow transport rate (100 to 104 ions or molecules per second) when compared to other transport proteins like ion channels. The rate at which this cycle of conformational changes occurs is called the turnover rate (TOR) and is expressed as the average number of complete cycles per second performed by a single cotransporter molecule.

==Types==

===Antiporters===

Antiporters use the mechanism of cotransport (coupling the movement of one ion or molecule down its concentration gradient with the transport of another ion or molecule up its concentration gradient), to move the ions and molecule in opposite directions. In this situation one of the ions will move from the exoplasmic space into the cytoplasmic space while the other ion will move from the cytoplasmic space into the exoplasmic space. An example of an antiporter is the sodium-calcium exchanger. The sodium-calcium exchanger functions to remove excess calcium from the cytoplasmic space into the exoplasmic space against its concentration gradient by coupling its transport with the transport of sodium from the exoplasmic space down its concentration gradient (established by the active transport of sodium out of the cell by the sodium-potassium pump) into the cytoplasmic space. The sodium-calcium exchanger exchanges 3 sodium ions for 1 calcium ion and represents a cation antiporter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Na+/Ca+&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells also contain anion antiporters such as the Band 3 (or AE1) anion transport protein. This cotransporter is an important integral protein in mammalian erythrocytes and moves chloride ion and bicarbonate ion in a one-to-one ratio across the plasma membrane based only on the concentration gradient of the two ions. The AE1 antiporter is essential in the removal of carbon dioxide waste that is converted to bicarbonate inside the erythrocyte.

===Symporters===

In contrast to antiporters, symporters move ions or molecules in the same direction. In this case both ions being transported will be moved either from the exoplasmic space into the cytoplasmic space or from the cytoplasmic space into the exoplasmic space. An example of a symporter is the sodium-glucose linked transporter or SGLT. The SGLT functions to couple the transport of sodium in the exoplasmic space down its concentration gradient (again, established by the active transport of sodium out of the cell by the sodium-potassium pump) into the cytoplasmic space to the transport of glucose in the exoplasmic space against its concentration gradient into the cytoplasmic space. The SGLT couples the movement of 1 glucose ion with the movement of 2 sodium ions.

===Examples of cotransporters===

Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) – is also known as sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 and is encoded by the SLC5A1 gene. SGLT1 is an electrogenic transporter as the sodium electrochemical gradient drives glucose uphill into the cells. SGLT1 is a high affinity Na+ /glucose cotransporter that has an important role in transferring sugar across the epithelial cells of renal proximal tubules and of the intestine, in particular the small intestine.

Na+/phosphate cotransporter (NaPi) – Sodium-phosphate cotransporters are from the SLC34 and SLC20 protein families. They are also found across the epithelial cells of renal proximal tubule and of the small intestine. It transfers inorganic phosphate into cells through active transport with the help of a Na+ gradient. Similar to SGTL1, they are classified as electrogenic transporters. NaPi coupled with 3 Na+ ions and 1 divalent Pi, are classified as NaPi IIa and NaPi IIb. NaPi that couples with 2 Na+ and 1 divalent Pi are classified as NaPi IIc.

Na+/I− symporter (NIS) – Sodium-Iodide is a type of symporter that is responsible for transferring iodide in the thyroid gland. NIS is primarily found in cells of the thyroid gland and also in the mammary glands. They are located on the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells where 2 Na+ ions and 1 I− ion is coupled to transfer the iodide. NIS activity helps in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease, including the highly successful treatment of thyroid cancer with radioiodide after thyroidectomy.

Na-K-2Cl symporter – This specific cotransporter regulates the cell volume by controlling the water and electrolyte content within the cell. The Na-K-2Cl Cotransporter is vital in salt secretion in secretory epithelia cells along with renal salt reabsorption. Two variations of the Na-K-2Cl symporter exist and are known as NKCC1 and NKCC2. The NKCC1 cotransport protein is found throughout the body but NKCC2 is found only in the kidney and removes the sodium, potassium, and chloride found in the body&#x27;s urine, so it can be absorbed into the blood.

GABA transporter (GAT) – neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporters are members of the solute carrier family 6 (SLC6) of sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter receptor transporters that are located in the plasma membrane and regulate the concentration of GABA in the synaptic cleft. The SLC6A1 gene encodes GABA transporters. The transporters are electrogenic and couples 2 Na+, 1 Cl− and 1 GABA for inward translocation.

K+Cl− Symporter – The K+-Cl− cotransporter family consists of four specific symporters known as KCC1, KCC2, KCC3, and KCC4. The KCC2 isoform is specific to neuronal tissue and the other three can be found in various tissues throughout the body. This cotransporter family controls the concentration levels of potassium and chloride within cells through the combined movement of K+/H+ and Cl−/HCO3− exchangers or through combined movement of both ions due to concentration activated channels. The four known KCC proteins team up to form two separate subfamilies with KCC1 and KCC3 pairing together and KCC2 and KCC4 becoming a pair to facilitate ion movement.

<doc id="1014478" wikidata="Q194387" url="?curid=1014478" title="Costa Rica national football team">
<text>The Costa Rica national football team () represents Costa Rica in men&#x27;s international football. The national team is administered by the Costa Rican Football Federation (FEDEFUTBOL), the governing body for football in Costa Rica. It has been a member of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) since 1927, the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) since 1961, and a member of the Central American Football Union (UNCAF) since 1990.

Costa Rica is the most successful national football team from the region of Central America, winning three CONCACAF Championships (1963, 1969, 1989) and leading the Copa Centroamericana tournament with four championships up until 2017, when it was absorbed into the CONCACAF Nations League. Costa Rica is the only national team in Central America to have played in six FIFA World Cup editions. Costa Rica&#x27;s national football team has the all-time highest average Football Elo Ranking in Central America with 1597.1, and the all-time highest Football Elo Ranking in Central America, with 1806 in 2014.

Since the late 1980s, the team has continuously been visible as a solidly competitive side and has been widely considered to be the second or third best team in the CONCACAF, with a prominent performance in the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, making it to the knockout stage in their debut after finishing second in their group during the first phase, below Brazil. They also qualified for the 2002 and 2006 World Cups. In 2014, Costa Rica achieved their best performance in history by finishing first in their group that consisted of three former World Cup champions: Uruguay, Italy, and England. During the round 16 they defeated Greece 5–3 via a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw. Moreover, during their match against the Greek team, Keylor Navas saved more than 15 shots. They reached the quarter-finals for the first time but were defeated by the Netherlands, also in a penalty shoot-out (3–4) after a scoreless draw on 5 July. Both their 2018 and 2022 World Cup campaigns ended in a fourth place group stage exit, with their only points coming from a 2–2 draw against Switzerland in 2018 and a 1–0 win over Japan in 2022.

==History==
===Early history===
The national team made its debut in the Independence Centenary Games held in Guatemala City in September 1921, winning their first game 7–0 against El Salvador. In the final, Costa Rica defeated 6–0 Guatemala to claim the trophy.

Costa Rica&#x27;s team in the late 1940s acquired the nickname &quot;The Gold Shorties&quot;. Throughout the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s, they were the second strongest team in the CONCACAF zone behind Mexico, finishing runners-up in World Cup qualifying in the 1958, 1962 and 1966 qualifiers. Stars of the side during this period included Ruben Jimenez, Errol Daniels, Leonel Hernandez and Edgar Marin. However, Costa Rica was not able to utilize this advantage, hence failed to reach any World Cup at that decade.

At the end of the 1960s their fortunes declined as Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Haiti, Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Canada rose in prominence.

===1980s===
Costa Rica failed to qualify for any of the World Cups in the 1970s and 1980s, and did not reach the final round of the CONCACAF qualifying until the 1986 qualifiers.

They participated in two consecutive Summer Olympic Games, in Moscow 1980 and in Los Angeles 1984. In 1980, Costa Rica competed against Yugoslavia, Finland and Iraq in Group D, losing 3–2, 3–0 and 3–0 respectively. In Los Angeles, the Ticos lost 3–0 against the United States, and 4–1 against Egypt, but beat a strong Italy team, which included Walter Zenga, Pietro Vierchowod, Franco Baresi and Aldo Serena, 1–0 with a goal by the midfielder Enrique Rivers.

===1990 World Cup===

Costa Rica won the 1989 CONCACAF Championship to qualify for the finals of a World Cup for the first time. In the first round of the qualifiers, they beat Panama 3–1 on aggregate after a 2–0 away victory in the second leg, with goals by Juan Cayasso and Hernán Medford. They were drawn against Mexico in the second round, but advanced automatically when their opponents were disqualified for age fraud.

Costa Rica started the final qualifying group stage with a home victory and an away defeat against both Guatemala and the United States. They drew 1–1 with Trinidad and Tobago and then beat the same opponents 1–0 at home with a goal by Cayasso. They achieved an important away win, 4–2 against El Salvador at the Estadio Cuscatlán, with goals from Carlos Hidalgo, Cayasso and a brace from Leonidas Flores, before beating El Salvador 1–0 in San José with a goal from Pastor Fernández. They finished first in the group table, ahead of the United States on goal difference.

Placed in Group C at the World Cup finals, Costa Rica began by beating Scotland 1–0 thanks to another goal by Cayasso. Although they lost to Brazil by the same score, they came from behind to beat Sweden 2–1 in their final group match to reach the knockout stages. There, they lost 4–1 to Czechoslovakia, for whom Tomáš Skuhravý scored a hat-trick.

===2002 World Cup===
The Ticos played first in qualification for the 2002 World Cup held in South Korea and Japan. During the qualifiers, Costa Rica were coached by Brazilian Gílson Nunes, and then by the naturalised Brazilian, Alexandre Guimarães. The first qualifying group stage began with an unexpected 2–1 defeat to Barbados. After this humiliation, Costa Rica beat the United States 2–1 at the Ricardo Saprissa Stadium, with goals from Rolando Fonseca and Hernán Medford. They then beat Guatemala 2–1 in the Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto, with two goals from Paulo Wanchope and Barbados 3–0 at the Ricardo Saprissa, with goals from Jafet Soto, Fonseca and Medford. A draw against the United States and a 2–1 defeat to Guatemala forced Costa Rica into a play-off against Guatemala in Miami. Costa Rica won 5–2 with two goals from Fonseca and one each from Wanchope, Reynaldo Parks and Jafeth Soto.

Costa Rica displayed fine attacking form during the final qualifying round, beginning with a 2–2 draw against Honduras at the Ricardo Saprissa, with goals from Fonseca and Rodrigo Cordero, and a 3–0 defeat of Trinidad and Tobago at the Morera Soto. Their only loss in this round came when the United States beat them 1–0. Costa Rica bounced back with a 2–1 win against Mexico in Mexico City, a match known as the &quot;Aztecazo&quot;, with goals from Fonseca and Medford. Further wins over Jamaica, Honduras and Trinidad and Tobago took Costa Rica to the brink of qualification, which they sealed with an emotional 2–0 win against the United States in the Saprissa, with a brace from Fonseca.
In the finals, Costa Rica were drawn into Group C with Brazil, China, and Turkey. Their campaign started in Gwangju, where the Ticos beat China 2–0. In their second game against Turkey in Incheon, Winston Parks scored an 86th-minute goal to earn a 1–1 draw. Against Brazil, Costa Rica fought back from 3–0 down to 3–2 early in the second half, only to concede two further goals and lose 5–2. With Turkey beating China 3–0, Costa Rica finished behind Turkey on goal difference and were eliminated.

===2006 World Cup===
Costa Rica again managed to qualify for the World Cup finals in 2006, albeit with difficulties that saw their American coach Steve Sampson depart after they required away goals to beat Cuba in the preliminary phase. The Colombian Jorge Luis Pinto took over for the next round, which began with a disastrous 5–2 defeat at home against Honduras and a 2–1 loss in Guatemala. Costa Rica recovered with two wins over Canada and a resounding 5–0 triumph over Guatemala, when Wanchope scored a hat-trick and Carlos Hernández and Fonseca added further goals. Costa Rica advanced to the hexagonal round by winning the group.

In the final round they started with a 2–1 defeat against Mexico at the Saprissa, before beating Panama by the same score, with goals from Wayne Wilson and Roy Myrie. Pinto was dismissed after a goalless draw with Trinidad and Tobago, and Guimarães returned as coach. His first match ended in a 3–0 defeat to the United States, but wins followed against Guatemala, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago. Costa Rica decisively beat the United States in the Saprissa, 3–0, with a goal from Wanchope and two from Hernández, to guarantee their third World Cup qualification.


On 9 June 2006, Costa Rica played their debut match in Munich in the opening match of the World Cup against the hosts, Germany. Wanchope scored to equalise after an early goal from Philipp Lahm, and later added another, but Costa Rica lost 4–2. They failed to match this encouraging performance in their remaining two games, losing 3–0 against Ecuador and 2–1 against Poland in a dead rubber.


===2010 World Cup===
Costa Rica began the qualifying competition for the 2010 World Cup against Grenada, winning 5–2 on aggregate (2–2, 3–0). They won all six games played in the next phase, against El Salvador (1–0, 3–1), Haiti (3–1, 2–0) and Suriname (7–0, 4–1).

With two games left in the Hexagonal round, Costa Rica trailed Honduras by one point in trying to win the third automatic qualification place behind the United States and Mexico. When Honduras lost 3–2 at home to the United States, Costa Rica overtook them with a 4–0 win against Trinidad and Tobago. Needing to win the final match in Washington, D.C. against the United States to ensure qualification, the Ticos led 2–0 at half-time, but Jonathan Bornstein scored an injury-time equaliser to draw the match 2–2. Meanwhile, Honduras&#x27;s 1–0 victory over El Salvador moved them into third place in the group table on goal difference.

Costa Rica finished fourth, pushing them into a play-off with the fifth-placed team from the CONMEBOL region, Uruguay. The Ticos lost the first leg in San José 1–0, after a goal by Diego Lugano, and finished with ten men after Randall Azofeifa was sent off. In the second leg, played at the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, Sebastián Abreu put Uruguay ahead twenty minutes from time, and although Walter Centeno equalised, the 1–1 draw sent Uruguay to the World Cup finals, 2–1 on aggregate.

After failing to qualify, the team began a new era, with the young talent of players such as Azofeifa, Keylor Navas, Cristian Bolaños, Michael Barrantes and Joel Campbell. Rónald González was the interim coach before Ricardo La Volpe was appointed in September 2010. He lasted only ten months before being replaced by the Colombian, Jorge Luis Pinto, in his second spell in charge. During this period, Costa Rica played many friendlies against the top-ranked teams in the world, including the world champion Spain, most of them in the new national stadium, the Estadio Nacional, which was opened in 2011.

===2014 World Cup===
The Ticos&#x27; 2014 World Cup campaign began with a 2–2 draw against El Salvador in the third round of the qualifiers. They followed this with a 4–0 win over Guyana with a hat-trick by Álvaro Saborío. Two defeats to Mexico put the Ticos one defeat away from elimination, but they resurrected their campaign with a 1–0 win against El Salvador, with the only goal scored by José Miguel Cubero. They clinched a final round berth with a 7–0 win over Guyana, with goals scored by Randall Brenes, Saborío, Cristian Bolaños, Celso Borges and Cristian Gamboa.

The fourth round began with a 2–2 draw against Panama. In March, Costa Rica lost 1–0 against the United States in Denver, and launched an unsuccessful appeal against the match because of inclement weather. Costa Rica again fell 1–0 to the United States in the Gold Cup that June. Costa Rica then won 2–0 against Jamaica, beat Honduras 1–0 against, drew 0–0 at the Azteca against Mexico and won at home 2–0 against Panama. In September, they won 3–1 against the United States in San José.

On 10 September 2013, Costa Rica drew 1–1 with Jamaica, thanks to a goal from Brenes, to qualify with two games to spare. After a 1–0 loss at Honduras and 2–1 win over Mexico in October, Costa Rica finished second in the table, behind the United States.
Costa Rica were drawn in finals Group D against three previous tournament winners – Italy, England and Uruguay – and were given odds of 2500–1 to win the tournament. However, they beat Uruguay and Italy and drew 0–0 with England to finish top of the group and qualify for the knockout stage.
In the second round, they beat Greece 5–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw, seeing them through to the quarter-finals for the first time. There, they held the Netherlands to a 0–0 draw after extra time, before losing 4–3 on penalties. Costa Rica rose 12 places to 16th in the FIFA World Rankings. Former player Rónald González cited their long-term progress since 2007 as the reason for their achievement.

===2018 World Cup===

The Ticos&#x27; qualification for the 2018 World Cup started with a bye to the fourth qualifying round, where they won five games and drew one, winning their group. In the final round, they finished second behind Mexico to qualify automatically, winning four matches, drawing four and losing two.
Costa Rica were drawn in Group E alongside Brazil, Switzerland and Serbia. Many key players from 2014 remained in the squad, but they made a disappointing exit at the group stage. Costa Rica lost their first two games, against Serbia and Brazil, without scoring, but drew 2–2 with Switzerland in their last match after equalising in injury time.

===2022 World Cup===
The Ticos&#x27; qualification for the 2022 World Cup started with a bye to the final qualifying round. They finished fourth behind the United States to advance to inter-confederation play-offs winning seven matches, drawing four and losing three. In the inter-confederation play-offs in Al Rayyan, Qatar, Costa Rica won the match 1–0 against New Zealand and qualified for the World Cup.

On November 23, 2022, Costa Rica lost 7–0 against Spain, the biggest World Cup loss since 2010. This match also tied for their worst defeat in professional football with a match against Mexico, which ended with Mexico 7–0 Costa Rica in Mexico Cityon 17 August 1975. After defeating Japan and scoring two goals against Germany in the first half, the latter scored three goals and eliminated Costa Rica.

==Home stadium==
Estadio Nacional is the home stadium of the Costa Rica national team since its opening on 10 January 2011 This venue hosts their friendly matches as well as the World Cup qualifying matches against CONCACAF rivals. Previous matches were played in Estadio Ricardo Saprissa or in Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto.

==Team image==
Costa Rica traditionally wears a red jersey with blue shorts and white socks. Their away kit historically was a Juventus-style black and white striped jersey with white shorts and white or black socks, due to these colors being the ones of CS La Libertad, one of the oldest clubs in Costa Rica. In the 1990 FIFA World Cup, the striped kit was used for two matches due to its resemblance to the home kit of FK Partizan of which Bora Milutinovic, then-coach of Costa Rica, was a fan. However, after 1997, the striped kit was replaced by a white kit. In 2015, Boston-based sportswear company New Balance became the provider of the national team, after taking over for Italian company Lotto. Since 2023, Adidas is the kit provider for the national team.

<doc id="1014483" wikidata="Q6262572" url="?curid=1014483" title="John W. Taylor (Mormon)">
<text>John Whittaker Taylor (May 15, 1858 – October 10, 1916) was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and was the son of John Taylor, the church&#x27;s third president. While he was an apostle, Taylor was excommunicated from the LDS Church for opposing the church&#x27;s abandonment of plural marriage. He was subsequently posthumously re-baptized in 1965. He was also reinstated to his position in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

==Family and occupation==
John W. Taylor was born in Provo, Utah Territory, while his parents, John Taylor and Sophia Whitaker, were taking shelter there, along with other church members, during the Utah War. He married May Leona Rich (daughter of John Taylor Rich and Agnes Young) on October 19, 1882, and moved to Cassia County, Idaho, to ranch. As a practitioner of plural marriage, Taylor later married Nellie Todd, Janet Maria Wooley, Eliza Roxie Welling, Rhoda Welling, and Ellen Georgina Sandberg. He also worked as a county clerk and a newspaper editor.

Taylor&#x27;s son, Samuel, became his biographer and a prolific writer of fiction and non-fiction.

== Church service and conflict ==
In the LDS Church, Taylor was ordained as a deacon around 1872 and as a teacher in 1874. He also served as missionary in the United States, Canada, and England. Taylor was called as an apostle and member of the church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles by his father. He was ordained on May 15, 1884, his 26th birthday.

Taylor was a staunch believer in the doctrine of plural marriage, and had in total six wives and 36 children. Although the church officially forbade new plural marriages with the 1890 Manifesto, when Taylor had three wives, he continued to privately marry additional wives. Under pressure, he submitted his resignation from the Quorum of the Twelve on October 28, 1905. Matthias F. Cowley also resigned from the Quorum at the same time over the plural marriage dispute. The following February, Marriner W. Merrill died. In the April general conference of 1906, the resignations of Cowley and Taylor were presented to and accepted by the general church membership. As a result, three new apostles were called to replace them and Merrill: George F. Richards, Orson F. Whitney, and David O. McKay.

Taylor disputed with the Quorum of the Twelve often after his resignation. He was finally excommunicated on March 28, 1911 for continued opposition to the Second Manifesto. However, he remained a believer in Mormonism until his death. He died of stomach cancer at his home in Forest Dale, Salt Lake County, Utah, at age 58. He was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery.

Taylor was posthumously officially rebaptized by proxy and reinstated into the church and on May 21, 1965, received the ordinance of Restoration of Blessings by proxy under the hands of Joseph Fielding Smith, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, with the unanimous approval of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

==Honors==
The Taylor Stake of the LDS Church, which was headquartered in Raymond, Alberta, was named in Taylor&#x27;s honor. As an apostle, Taylor had made considerable efforts to assist the Latter-day Saint settlers in Canada. The Taylor Stake was renamed the Raymond Alberta Stake in the 1970s.

In the 2000s, the town of Raymond built a street named Taylor Street in his honor. An LDS Church chapel was built on the street, and it is named the Taylor Street Chapel.

<text>Joe Creason (June 10, 1918 – August 14, 1974) was a journalist who wrote for &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; in Louisville, Kentucky.

He was born in Benton, Kentucky, which he would later humorously call &quot;the only town in Kentucky where I was born.&quot; After graduation from the University of Kentucky in 1940, he became the editor of a Benton newspaper, and then the editor of a newspaper in Murray. He then accepted a position as a sports reporter, feature writer, and columnist for &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; in 1941.

His popular column, &quot;Joe Creason&#x27;s Kentucky,&quot; began in 1963 and documented the lives of everyday Kentuckians. Creason traveled through every county in Kentucky in search of material for these stories, and he often printed stories sent in to him by readers. These articles were written in a quirky and simple style, featuring colorful and amusing characters. The articles were collected into two books and a record album.

Creason was also an amateur historian, and he co-wrote and edited &quot;The Civil War in Kentucky,&quot; an award-winning newspaper supplement. He was also president of the University of Kentucky Alumni Association.

Creason is credited with starting the movement to make the Kentucky coffeetree the first official state tree of Kentucky, a status it held from 1976 until 1994 when it was replaced by the tulip poplar.

Creason continued writing and working until his death, which occurred while playing tennis with WHAS radio personality Milton Metz. Joe Creason Park, where he died, is named after him.

The Bingham family that owned &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot;, other friends of Creason, and alumni of the University of Kentucky made donations to the UK School of Journalism to establish the Joe Creason Lecture Series, which began in 1977 with a lecture by columnist James J. Kilpatrick. James Reston of The New York Times gave the next lecture, in 1979, and it has been held each year since.

<doc id="1014485" wikidata="Q4523726" url="?curid=1014485" title="Oregon v. Mitchell">
<text>Oregon v. Mitchell, , was a U.S. Supreme Court case in which the states of Oregon, Texas, Arizona, and Idaho challenged the constitutionality of Sections 201, 202, and 302 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) Amendments of 1970 passed by the 91st United States Congress, and where John Mitchell was the respondent in his role as United States Attorney General. The Supreme Court ruled that the literacy test ban under Section 201, the minimum residency duration requirement for voter registration and the uniform rule for absentee voting in presidential elections under Section 202, and that Congress lowering the voting age in federal elections from 21 to 18 under Section 302 were all constitutional, but that Congress lowering the voting age in state and local elections from 21 to 18 under Section 302 was unconstitutional.

==Holdings==

===Section 201===

Despite the Court upholding Section 201 unanimously, Potter Stewart, Warren Burger, and Harry Blackmun in a single opinion, William J. Brennan, Byron White, and Thurgood Marshall in a separate single opinion, and John Marshall Harlan II in a separate opinion argued the literacy test ban was constitutional under Section 2 of the 15th Amendment. In separate opinions, William O. Douglas argued that it was constitutional under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause, while Hugo Black argued that it was constitutional under both Section 2 of the 15th Amendment and Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause.

===Section 202===

The Court upheld Section 202 by an 8–1 ruling with Douglas and Brennan, White, and Marshall arguing the minimum residency duration requirement for voter registration and the uniform rule for absentee voting in presidential elections was constitutional under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to enforce the Privileges or Immunities Clause. Stewart, Burger, and Blackmun also argued Section 202 was constitutional under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to enforce the Privileges or Immunities Clause but more broadly under the Necessary and Proper Clause of Article I, Section VIII to protect constitutional provisions related to freedom of movement in general and under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section II specifically. Black argued Section 202 was constitutional under the Congressional Elections Clause of Article I, Section IV and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Harlan dissented and argued Section 202 was unconstitutional under the 10th Amendment by the delegation of powers under the Presidential Electors Clause and the Electoral College Meetings Clause of Article II, Section I.

===Section 302===

The Court upheld Section 302 lowering the voting age in federal elections by a 5–4 ruling with Douglas and Brennan, White, and Marshall arguing it was constitutional under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause, and Black arguing it was constitutional under the Congressional Elections Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Harlan and Stewart, Burger, and Blackmun dissented and argued that Section 302 as applied to federal elections was unconstitutional under the 10th Amendment by the delegation of powers under the House Electors Qualifications Clause of Article I, Section II, the Congressional Elections Clause, the 17th Amendment, and the Presidential Electors Clause and the Electoral College Meetings Clause of Article II, Section I. In a separate 5–4 ruling where Black joined Harlan and Stewart, Burger, and Blackmun to form the majority, the Court held that Section 302 lowering the voting age in state and local elections was unconstitutional under the 10th Amendment by the delegation of powers under the House Electors Qualifications Clause and the 17th Amendment, while Douglas and Brennan, White, and Marshall argued it was also constitutional under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause.

==26th Amendment==

Less than seven months after &quot;Oregon v. Mitchell&quot; was decided, the Court&#x27;s Section 302 holdings with respect to minimum age requirements as voter qualifications were superseded by the ratification of the 26th Amendment.

==Subsequent cases==

In &quot;Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc.&quot; (2013), the Court concluded that the Section 302 holding that permitted Congress to preempt state voter qualifications for minimum voting age in federal elections under the Equal Protection Clause was of minimal precedential value to that decision.

<text>John W. Taylor (March 26, 1784 – September 18, 1854) was an early 19th-century U.S. politician from New York. He served twice as speaker of the House of Representatives.

==Life==
Taylor was born in 1784 in that part of the Town of Ballston, then in Albany County, New York, which was, upon the creation of Saratoga County in 1791, split off to form the Town of Charlton. He received his first education at home.

Taylor graduated from Union College in 1803 as valedictorian of his class. Then he studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1807, and practiced in Ballston Spa, New York. In 1806, he married Jane Hodge (died 1838), of Albany, New York, and they had eight children. He was a member from Saratoga County of the New York State Assembly in 1812 and 1812–13.

Taylor served in the United States House of Representatives for 20 years, from 1813 to 1833, and was twice elected as Speaker of the House: in 1820 and in 1825. In 1819, he supported the proposed Tallmadge Amendment regarding the Missouri Territory&#x27;s admission to the Union as a free state (which passed the House, but was defeated in the Senate), and was a staunch proponent of the subsequent Missouri Compromise of March 1820. During the floor debate on the Tallmadge Amendment, Taylor boldly criticized southern lawmakers who frequently voiced their dismay that slavery was entrenched and necessary to their existence.

After leaving Congress, Taylor resumed his law practice in Ballston Spa, and was a member of the New York State Senate (4th D.) in 1841 and 1842. He resigned his seat on August 19, 1842, after suffering a paralytic stroke. In 1843, he moved to Cleveland, Ohio, to live with his eldest daughter and her husband William D. Beattie, and died there 11 years later. He was buried in the Ballston Spa Village Cemetery.

<text>Mary Poppins Opens the Door, is a British children&#x27;s fantasy novel, by the Australian-British writer P.L. Travers, the third book and last novel in the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; series that features the magical English nanny Mary Poppins. It was published in 1943, by Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc and illustrated by Mary Shepard and Agnes Sims.

==Plot summary==
On Guy Fawkes Night, Mary Poppins arrives in the wake of the last fireworks display by the Banks family. The Banks children, Michael, Jane, the twins, and Annabel plead with her to stay. She reluctantly agrees to do so &quot;till the door opens.&quot; When an anxious Jane points out that the nursery door is always opening, she clarifies &quot;the other door.&quot;

Mrs. Banks has Mary and the children find a piano tuner, who happens to be Mary&#x27;s cousin, Mr. Twigley. When Mary and the children visit, Mr. Twigley tries to unburden himself from seven wishes given to him when he was born. Besides pianos, Mr. Twigley also specialises in songbirds such as nightingales, one of which he releases when he&#x27;s finished. He also provides music boxes for Mary and the Banks children to dance to. When they return home later, the drawing room piano is playing perfectly, and when the Banks children ask Mary what happened, she sharply rebukes them.

Other adventures in the book include Mary telling the story of a king (implied to be Old King Cole) who was outsmarted by a cat (known as &quot;The Cat That Looked at a King&quot;), the park statue of Neleus that comes to life for a time during one of their outings, their visit to confectioner Miss Calico and her flying peppermint sticks, an undersea (High-Tide) party where Mary Poppins is the guest of honour, and a party between fairy tale rivals in the Crack between the Old Year and the New. When the children ask why Mary Poppins, a real person, is there, they are told that she can be considered as a fairy tale that has come true. The next morning, Jane and Michael find definite proof of the last night&#x27;s adventure, and this time she does not deny it, simply telling them that they too may end up living happily ever after.

Finally, after Mary and the children have a non-magical (but nonetheless wondrous) afternoon playing on the swings at the Park, the citizens of the town as well as many other characters from the previous two books turn out in front of the house to have a farewell party. Before going inside, Mary urges the children to be good and remember everything she told them, and they realise that it is Mary, not the other characters, who is departing. They rush to the nursery to see her open and walk through the nursery door&#x27;s reflection in the window. Mary Poppins then opens her parrot headed umbrella, and it soars up into the sky, taking her with it. The Banks Children are happy she kept her promise by staying till the &quot;door&quot; opened. Mrs Banks arrives afterwards, and sees the children alone. Mrs Brill tells her that Mary Poppins has left again, and she is distraught about what she is going to do without a nanny for the children. Mr Banks is distracted by the music playing outside, and encourages his wife to just forget about it and dance with him.

When he has finished dancing with his wife, he sees what he thinks is a shooting star, (though it is really Mary Poppins flying away on her umbrella) and they all wish upon it. The children wish to remember Mary Poppins for the rest of their lives, and they faintly make her out in the star. They wave and she waves back to them. The narrator remarks, &quot;Mary Poppins herself had flown away, but the gifts she had brought would remain for always.&quot;

They promise to never forget her, and she hears this and smiles and waves to them, before the darkness hides her, and they see her and her umbrella for the last time ever.

The Banks Family sigh that Mary Poppins has gone, but happily decide to sit by the fire together. (This presumably meaning that the parents have decided to spend more time with their children thanks to Mary&#x27;s lessons).

==Film adaptation==
In 2004, Julie Andrews appeared in a live-action/animated 10-minute short film produced by DisneyToon Studios for the 40th Anniversary DVD release of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. &quot;The Cat That Looked at a King&quot; was based on &quot;Mary Poppins Opens the Door,&quot; and was the first project offered to The Answer Studio, which included former employees of Walt Disney Animation Japan.

As the film opens, two modern-day British children are looking at chalk drawings at the same location where Dick Van Dyke&#x27;s character, Bert, did his artwork in the original movie. Andrews (as herself) greets the children and takes them into the chalk drawing where they watch the tale of a cat (Tracey Ullman) that challenges a king (David Ogden Stiers) to a trivia contest. If the cat wins, the king must give up his obsession with facts and figures and reconnect with his queen. Back in the real world—where she, like Poppins, denies that she has been away—Andrews and the cat face each other as the shadow of Mary Poppins is framed by one of the chalk drawings.

The concept of Mary Poppins staying until &quot;the door opens&quot; is used in &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;.

<text>Carrickfergus Castle (from the Irish &quot;Carraig Ḟergus&quot; or &quot;cairn of Fergus&quot;, the name &quot;Fergus&quot; meaning &quot;strong man&quot;) is a Norman castle in Northern Ireland, situated in the town of Carrickfergus in County Antrim, on the northern shore of Belfast Lough. Besieged in turn by the Scottish, rebel Irish, English, and French, the castle played an important military role until 1928 and remains one of the best preserved medieval structures in Northern Ireland. It was strategically useful, with 3/4 of the castle perimeter surrounded by water (although in modern times only 1/3 of it is surrounded by water due to land reclamation). Today it is maintained by the Department for Communities as a state care historic monument, at grid ref: J4143 8725.

==Origins==
Carrickfergus was built by John de Courcy in 1177 as his headquarters, after he conquered eastern Ulster and ruled as a petty king until 1204, when he was ousted by another Norman adventurer, Hugh de Lacy. Initially de Courcy built the inner ward, a small bailey at the end of the promontory with a high polygonal curtain wall and east gate. It had several buildings, including the great hall. From its strategic position on a rocky promontory, originally almost surrounded by sea, the castle commanded Carrickfergus Bay (later known as Belfast Lough), and the land approaches into the walled town that developed beneath its shadow.

==English control==

Lord Edmund Savage of the Ards was Seneschal of Ulster and Constable of Carrickfergus Castle in the late 14th century under Richard II. The castle also appears in the official English records in 1430 when King John laid siege to it and took control of what was then Ulster&#x27;s premier strategic garrison. Following its capture, constables were appointed to command the castle and the surrounding area. In 1217 the new constable, De Serlane, was assigned one hundred pounds to build a new curtain wall so that the approach along the rock could be protected, as well as the eastern approaches over the sand exposed at low tide. The middle-ward curtain wall was later reduced to ground level in the eighteenth century, save along the seaward side, where it survives with a postern gate and the east tower, notable for a fine array of cross-bow loops at basement level.

A chamber on the first floor of the east tower is believed to have been the castle&#x27;s chapel on account of its fine Romanesque-style double window surround, though the original chapel must have been in the inner ward. The ribbed vault over the entrance passage, the murder hole and the massive portcullis at either end of the gatehouse are later insertions started by Hugh de Lacey who died in 1248 and did not live to see its completion in around 1250. It was finished by King Henry III.

After the collapse of the Earldom of Ulster in 1333, the castle remained the Crown&#x27;s principal residential and administrative centre in the north of Ireland. During the early stages of the Nine Years War (1595–1603), when English influence in the north became tenuous,
crown forces were supplied and maintained through the town&#x27;s port. And in 1597, the surrounding country was the scene for the Battle of Carrickfergus.

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries improvements were made to accommodate artillery, including externally splayed gunports and embrasures for cannon, though these improvements did not prevent the castle from being attacked and captured on many occasions during this time. Marshal Schomberg besieged and took the castle in the week-long Siege of Carrickfergus in 1689. This is also the place where Schomberg&#x27;s leader, King William III first set foot in Ireland on 14 June 1690.

In 1760, after fierce fighting in the town, it was surrendered to French invaders under the command of Francois Thurot. They looted the castle and town and then left, only to be caught by the Royal Navy.

==Later use==

In 1778, a small but significant event in the American War of Independence began at Carrickfergus, when John Paul Jones, in the face of reluctance by his crew to approach too close to the Castle, lured a Royal Navy vessel from its moorings into the North Channel, and won an hour-long battle. In 1797 the Castle, which had on various occasions been used to house prisoners of war, became a prison and it was heavily defended during the Napoleonic Wars; six guns on the east battery remain of the twenty-two that were used in 1811.

For a century it remained a magazine and armoury. During the First World War it was used as a garrison and ordnance store and during the Second World War as an air raid shelter.

It was garrisoned continuously for about 750 years until 1928, when its ownership was transferred from the British Army to the new Government of Northern Ireland for preservation as an ancient monument. Many of its post-Norman and Victorian additions were then removed to restore the castle&#x27;s original Norman appearance. It remains open to the public. The banqueting hall has been fully restored and there are many exhibits to show what life was like in medieval times. It was built and re-built three times, and still stands today.

On the day of his wedding, 29 April 2011, Prince William of Wales was created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, and Baron Carrickfergus. The latter title of peerage, along with the geographical barony itself, had been extinct since Victorian times. The title is now only ceremonial with no official connection to the castle.

*1568: William Piers

<text>The Nab Tower is a tower originally planned for anti-submarine protection in the English Channel in World War I. It was sunk over the Nab rocks east of the Isle of Wight to replace a lightship after the war, and is a well-known landmark for sailors as it lies off Spithead and marks the deep-water eastern entry into the Solent.

==History==

During the First World War, the British Admiralty designed eight towers codenamed M-N that were to be built and positioned in the Straits of Dover to protect allied merchant shipping from German U-boats. Designed by civilian Guy Maunsell, the towers were to be linked together with steel nets and armed with two 4-inch guns with the idea of closing the English Channel to enemy ships.

However, by the end of the war in 1918 only one such tower had been completed, at the then-cost of one million pounds, and was located at Shoreham Harbour, awaiting deployment. While another part-built tower would eventually be dismantled in 1924, there remained the completed metal cylinder sitting on a raft of concrete.

In 1920 the completed tower was towed by two paddle-wheel tugs to the Nab rock, a rock in the deep-water approach to the eastern Solent and previously marked by a lightship. Buoyancy was provided by the honeycomb construction of the concrete base, creating 18 watertight compartments. When these were flooded, the structure sank and settled to rest at an angle of 3 degrees from vertical towards the northeast – a characteristic tilt which is obvious to this day.
Initially, the tower had a single centrally-placed lamp containing an Osram gas-filled incandescent light bulb, which gave a single white flash every ten seconds, with a visible range of 16 nautical miles. A fog horn was also installed, in a separate shed on the tower top. Later, the single light was replaced by a pair of small (fifth-order) revolving dioptric optics, each of which produced a single flash every 10 seconds; they were mounted in small turrets on opposite sides of the tower: one shone red towards the north-west, the other shone white towards the south-east (their arcs overlapped, so that vessels approaching from seaward would see the red light as well as the white if their course took them too close to St Catherine&#x27;s Point, approaching from the west, or Selsey Bill, approaching from the east). In December 1935 a radio beacon was added.

In 1938 a more powerful diaphone fog signal was installed (in place of the old fog horn), which gave one 2.5-second blast every minute. It was synchronised with the radio beacon; by timing the delay between receiving the radio signal and the audible signal, vessels were able to calculate their distance from the tower. The tower was equipped with a fog bell, as well as the diaphone, which sounded one stroke every 7.5 seconds.

The Nab Tower was manned as a lighthouse, but also functioned as a Royal Navy signal station; and during World War II it was equipped with a pair of Bofors guns to provide some defence to the Solent approach, and actually shot down several aircraft. The Royal Navy withdrew its personnel from the tower some time after the war, but the tower remained under Ministry of Defence ownership until 1984, when Trinity House acquired the freehold (they had previously taken over responsibility for the light itself from the Admiralty in 1929).

The Nab Tower still functions as a lighthouse, but since 1983 it has been unmanned. That year, a helicopter pad was constructed on the tower and a new pre-fabricated lantern-tower was installed containing an automated acetylene lamp; as well as powering the lamp, acetylene gas drove the revolving mechanism for the lightweight GRP optic in which the lamp was set. In 1995 the light was converted to solar power operation and a new Orga rotating beacon was installed in the lantern (later a Vega VRB-25 rotating beacon was used).

In November 1999, the merchant freighter &quot;Dole America&quot;, carrying a cargo of bananas and pineapples, hit the Nab. The ship was badly damaged and only avoided sinking by being run aground. The base of the tower suffered superficial and internal damage. The damage was repaired in 2001.

The tower was featured as the main setting of the 1951 Hammer thriller &quot;The Dark Light&quot;.

==Major refurbishment in 2013==
In 2013, Trinity House commissioned BAM Nuttall to undertake a major refurbishment programme due to extensive corrosion of the upper levels, meaning it was unsafe to land helicopters upon the helipad. Partial dismantling of the structure followed, undertaken with the help of a tower crane, which was installed within a former ammunition shaft. The height of the tower was reduced from 27 metres to 17, all external steel and cladding were removed and the existing concrete sub-structure was coated in a new layer of gun-applied concrete. On completion, new AIS and RACON beacons were fitted, along with a fixed main LED light (and identical standby light) with a 12 nautical mile range; a new fog signal was also installed, sounding two blasts every 30 seconds (altered to one blast in 2022). All are solar powered.

The distinctive red lantern structure, removed as part of the refurbishment, is now on display at Hurst Castle, together with the old rotating beacon. In addition, a pair of rotating 4th-order dioptric optics, which were in use on the tower prior to automation, are also displayed at the castle.

<text>Brit Tzedek v&#x27;Shalom, also known as Jewish Alliance for Justice and Peace, was an organization of American Jews and describes its members as &quot;deeply committed to Israel&#x27;s well-being through the achievement of a negotiated settlement to the long-standing Israeli–Palestinian conflict&quot;. They describe this as &quot;necessitating an end to Israel&#x27;s occupation of land acquired during the 1967 war and an end to Palestinian terrorism&quot;. The group endorses a two-state solution to the conflict. The founding president of this organization is Marcia Freedman.

In 2006, it collaborated with Americans for Peace Now and the Israel Policy Forum to lobby Congress against the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act 2006 (H.R. 4681), which was supported by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). The bill eventually became law, but in a form that was quite different from the original language proposed by AIPAC.

 they list 38 chapters. A press release from October 14, 2006 claimed more than 35,000 members.

According to its January 2010 newsletter, it integrated into J Street. This is apparently for strategic coordination, instead of an outright merger.

<doc id="1014514" wikidata="Q567940" url="?curid=1014514" title="Another Brick in the Wall">
<text>&quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; is a three-part composition on Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;The Wall&quot;, written by the bassist, Roger Waters. &quot;Part 2&quot;, a protest song against corporal punishment and rigid and abusive schooling, features a children&#x27;s choir. At the suggestion of the producer, Bob Ezrin, Pink Floyd added elements of disco.

&quot;Part 2&quot; was Pink Floyd&#x27;s first UK single since &quot;Point Me at the Sky&quot; (1968). It sold more than four million copies worldwide and topped singles charts in 14 countries, including the UK and the US. It was nominated for a Grammy Award and was ranked number 384 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

== Concept ==
The three parts of &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; appear on Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1979 rock opera album &quot;The Wall&quot;. They are essentially one verse each, although Part 2 sees its own verse sung twice: once by Floyd members, and the second time by the guest choir along with Waters and Gilmour. During &quot;Part 1&quot;, the protagonist, Pink, begins building a metaphorical wall around himself following the death of his father. In &quot;Part 2&quot;, traumas involving his overprotective mother and abusive schoolteachers become bricks in the wall. Following a violent breakdown in &quot;Part 3&quot;, Pink dismisses everyone he knows as &quot;just bricks in the wall.&quot;

Bassist Roger Waters wrote &quot;Part 2&quot; as a protest against rigid schooling, particularly boarding schools. &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; appears in the film based on the album. In the &quot;Part 2&quot; sequence, children enter a school and march in unison through a meat grinder, becoming &quot;putty-faced&quot; clones, before rioting and burning down the school.

== Recording ==

At the suggestion of the producer Bob Ezrin, Pink Floyd added elements of disco, which was popular at the time. According to the guitarist, David Gilmour:

Gilmour recorded his guitar solo using a 1955 Gibson Les Paul Gold Top guitar with P-90 pickups. The American session guitarist Lee Ritenour said in a 2024 interview that Ezrin had him record some ideas for the solo, as Pink Floyd could not decide how to end it. Though his parts were not used, he said he detected his influence in the last bars of Gilmour&#x27;s solo.

Despite his reservations about the disco element, Gilmour felt the final song sounded like Pink Floyd. When Ezrin heard the song with a disco beat, he was convinced it could become a hit, but felt it needed to be longer, with two verses and two choruses. The band resisted, saying they did not release singles; Waters told him: &quot;Go ahead and waste your time doing silly stuff.&quot; 

While the band members were away, Ezrin edited the takes into an extended version. He also had the engineer Nick Griffiths record children singing the verse at Islington Green School, close to Pink Floyd&#x27;s studio. Griffiths was instructed to record only two or three children. Inspired by a Todd Rundgren album featuring an audience in each stereo channel, he suggested recording a school choir. The school allotted only 40 minutes for the recording.

Alun Renshaw, the head of music at the school, was enthusiastic, and said later: &quot;I wanted to make music relevant to the kids – not just sitting around listening to Tchaikovsky. I thought the lyrics were great – &#x27;We don&#x27;t need no education, we don&#x27;t need no thought control&#x27; ... I just thought it would be a wonderful experience for the kids.&quot; The children&#x27;s choir in the recording featured 23 students, who practised for about a week to prepare. Renshaw hid the lyrics from the headteacher, Margaret Maden, fearing she might stop the recording. Maden said: &quot;I was only told about it after the event, which didn&#x27;t please me. But on balance it was part of a very rich musical education.&quot;

Renshaw and the children spent a week practising before he took them to a recording studio near the school. According to Ezrin, when he played the children&#x27;s vocals to Waters, &quot;There was a total softening of his face, and you just knew that he knew it was going to be an important record.&quot; Waters said: &quot;It was great—exactly the thing I expected from a collaborator.&quot;

The children of Islington School received tickets to a Pink Floyd concert, an album and a single. Though the school received a payment of £1,000, there was no arrangement for royalties for the children. Following a change to UK copyright law in 1996, they became eligible for royalties from broadcasts. After the royalties agent Peter Rowan traced the choir members through the social network service Friends Reunited and other means, they successfully lodged a claim for royalties with the Performing Artists&#x27; Media Rights Association in 2004.

== Reception ==
&quot;Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)&quot; was released as a single, Pink Floyd&#x27;s first in the UK since &quot;Point Me at the Sky&quot; (1968). It was also the Christmas number one of 1979 and the final number one of the decade in the UK. In the US, it reached number 57 on the disco chart. The single sold over 4 million copies worldwide. &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as a &quot;catchy but foreboding selection, with its ominously steady drum work and angry lyrics.&quot; Critic Mike Cormack said &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)&quot; was a &quot;magnificent achievement: its catchy rhythm undercutting the darkness of the song’s theme, the irony of its chorus belying the acidulous disdain of the lyric, Waters’ quality as a wordsmith on display with the excellent phrase ‘dark sarcasm’, and the simplicity of its structure giving it a tight focus.&quot;

The song won Waters the 1983 British Academy Award for Best Original Song for its appearance in the &quot;Wall&quot; film. &quot;Part 2&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Rock Duo or Group. It appeared at number 384 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2010 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

The lyrics attracted controversy. The Inner London Education Authority described the song as &quot;scandalous&quot;, and according to Renshaw, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher &quot;hated it&quot;. Renshaw said, &quot;There was a political knee-jerk reaction to a song that had nothing to do with the education system. It was [Waters&#x27;] reflections on his life and how his schooling was part of that.&quot; The single, as well as the album &quot;The Wall&quot;, were banned in South Africa in 1980 after it was adopted by supporters of a nationwide school boycott protesting instituted racial inequities in education under apartheid.

== Roger Waters versions ==

A live version of &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2&quot; with Cyndi Lauper on vocals, recorded on 21 July 1990 at Potsdamer Platz, was released as a single on 10 September 1990 to promote &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot;. The B-side was the live version of &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; performed with Scorpions at the same concert.

In promotion of &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot; a new studio version was recorded by Roger Waters &amp; The Bleeding Heart Band that was released on promo compilation titled &quot;The Wall Berlin &#x27;90&quot; featuring Pink Floyd and Roger Waters solo recordings.

Another live version appeared on Waters&#x27; album &quot;In the Flesh – Live&quot;, integrated between &quot;The Happiest Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Mother&quot; as on the original album, but with a reprise of the first verse ending the song.

For later shows, Waters usually employed local school choirs to perform the song with him (as can be seen on &quot;Roger Waters: The Wall&quot;). From 2011 to 2013, Waters added an acoustic coda called &quot;The Ballad of Jean Charles de Menezes&quot;.

<doc id="1014518" wikidata="Q910267" url="?curid=1014518" title="Volatile organic compound">
<text>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are organic compounds that have a high vapor pressure at room temperature. They are common and exist in a variety of settings and products, not limited to house mold, upholstered furniture, arts and crafts supplies, dry cleaned clothing, and cleaning supplies. VOCs are responsible for the odor of scents and perfumes as well as pollutants. They play an important role in communication between animals and plants, such as attractants for pollinators, protection from predation, and even inter-plant interactions. Some VOCs are dangerous to human health or cause harm to the environment, often despite the odor being perceived as pleasant, such as &quot;new car smell&quot;.

Anthropogenic VOCs are regulated by law, especially indoors, where concentrations are the highest. Most VOCs are not acutely toxic, but may have long-term chronic health effects. Some VOCs have been used in pharmaceutical settings, while others are the target of administrative controls because of their recreational use. The high vapor pressure of VOCs correlates with a low boiling point, which relates to the number of the sample&#x27;s molecules in the surrounding air, a trait known as volatility.

==Definitions==
Diverse definitions of the term VOC are in use. Some examples are presented below.

===Canada===
Health Canada classifies VOCs as organic compounds that have boiling points roughly in the range of . The emphasis is placed on commonly encountered VOCs that would have an effect on air quality.

===European Union===
The European Union defines a VOC as &quot;any organic compound as well as the fraction of creosote, having at 293.15 K a vapour pressure of 0.01 kPa or more, or having a corresponding volatility under the particular conditions of use;&quot;. The VOC Solvents Emissions Directive was the main policy instrument for the reduction of industrial emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the European Union. It covers a wide range of solvent-using activities, e.g. printing, surface cleaning, vehicle coating, dry cleaning and manufacture of footwear and pharmaceutical products. The VOC Solvents Emissions Directive requires installations in which such activities are applied to comply either with the emission limit values set out in the Directive or with the requirements of the so-called reduction scheme. Article 13 of The Paints Directive, approved in 2004, amended the original VOC Solvents Emissions Directive and limits the use of organic solvents in decorative paints and varnishes and in vehicle finishing products. The Paints Directive sets out maximum VOC content limit values for paints and varnishes in certain applications. The Solvents Emissions Directive was replaced by the Industrial Emissions Directive from 2013.

===China===
The People&#x27;s Republic of China defines a VOC as those compounds that have &quot;originated from automobiles, industrial production and civilian use, burning of all types of fuels, storage and transportation of oils, fitment finish, coating for furniture and machines, cooking oil fume and fine particles (PM 2.5)&quot;, and similar sources. The Three-Year Action Plan for Winning the Blue Sky Defence War released by the State Council in July 2018 creates an action plan to reduce 2015 VOC emissions 10% by 2020.

===India===
The Central Pollution Control Board of India released the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act in 1981, amended in 1987, to address concerns about air pollution in India. While the document does not differentiate between VOCs and other air pollutants, the CPCB monitors &quot;oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2), fine particulate matter (PM10) and suspended particulate matter (SPM)&quot;.

===United States===
The definitions of VOCs used for control of precursors of photochemical smog used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies in the US with independent outdoor air pollution regulations include exemptions for VOCs that are determined to be non-reactive, or of low-reactivity in the smog formation process. Prominent is the VOC regulation issued by the South Coast Air Quality Management District in California and by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). However, this specific use of the term VOCs can be misleading, especially when applied to indoor air quality because many chemicals that are not regulated as outdoor air pollution can still be important for indoor air pollution.

Following a public hearing in September 1995, California&#x27;s ARB uses the term &quot;reactive organic gases&quot; (ROG) to measure organic gases. The CARB revised the definition of &quot;Volatile Organic Compounds&quot; used in their consumer products regulations, based on the committee&#x27;s findings.

In addition to drinking water, VOCs are regulated in pollutant discharges to surface waters (both directly and via sewage treatment plants) as hazardous waste, but not in non-industrial indoor air. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates VOC exposure in the workplace. Volatile organic compounds that are classified as hazardous materials are regulated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration while being transported.

==Biologically generated VOCs==

Most VOCs in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere are biogenic, largely emitted by plants.
Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) encompass VOCs emitted by plants, animals, or microorganisms, and while extremely diverse, are most commonly terpenoids, alcohols, and carbonyls (methane and carbon monoxide are generally not considered). Not counting methane, biological sources emit an estimated 760 teragrams of carbon per year in the form of VOCs. The majority of VOCs are produced by plants, the main compound being isoprene. Small amounts of VOCs are produced by animals and microbes. Many VOCs are considered secondary metabolites, which often help organisms in defense, such as plant defense against herbivory. The strong odor emitted by many plants consists of green leaf volatiles, a subset of VOCs. Although intended for nearby organisms to detect and respond to, these volatiles can be detected and communicated through wireless electronic transmission, by embedding nanosensors and infrared transmitters into the plant materials themselves.

Emissions are affected by a variety of factors, such as temperature, which determines rates of volatilization and growth, and sunlight, which determines rates of biosynthesis. Emission occurs almost exclusively from the leaves, the stomata in particular. VOCs emitted by terrestrial forests are often oxidized by hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere; in the absence of NOx pollutants, VOC photochemistry recycles hydroxyl radicals to create a sustainable biosphere–atmosphere balance. Due to recent climate change developments, such as warming and greater UV radiation, BVOC emissions from plants are generally predicted to increase, thus upsetting the biosphere–atmosphere interaction and damaging major ecosystems. A major class of VOCs is the terpene class of compounds, such as myrcene.

Providing a sense of scale, a forest in area, the size of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, is estimated to emit of terpenes on a typical August day during the growing season. Maize produces the VOC (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and other plant hormones.

== Anthropogenic sources ==

Anthropogenic sources emit about 142 teragrams (1.42 × 1011 kg, or 142 billion kg) of carbon per year in the form of VOCs.

The major source of man-made VOCs are:
* Fossil fuel use and production, e.g. incompletely combusted fossil fuels or unintended evaporation of fuels. The most prevalent VOC is ethane, a relatively inert compound.
* Solvents used in coatings, paints, and inks. Approximately 12 billion litres of paint are produced annually. Typical solvents include aliphatic hydrocarbons, ethyl acetate, glycol ethers and acetone. Motivated by cost, environmental concerns, and regulation, the paint and coating industries are increasingly shifting toward aqueous solvents.
* Compressed aerosol products, mainly butane and propane, estimated to contribute 1.3 million tonnes of VOC emissions per year globally.
* Biofuel use, e.g., cooking oils in Asia and bioethanol in Brazil.
* Biomass combustion, especially from rain forests. Although combustion principally releases carbon dioxide and water, incomplete combustion affords a variety of VOCs.

==Indoor VOCs==

Due to their numerous sources indoors, concentrations of VOCs indoors are consistently higher in indoor air (up to ten times higher) than outdoors due to the many sources. VOCs are emitted by thousands of indoor products. Examples include: paints, varnishes, waxes and lacquers, paint strippers, cleaning and personal care products, pesticides, building materials and furnishings, office equipment such as copiers and printers, correction fluids and carbonless copy paper, graphics and craft materials including glues and adhesives, permanent markers, and photographic solutions. Human activities such as cooking and cleaning can also emit VOCs. Cooking can release long-chain aldehydes and alkanes when oil is heated and terpenes can be released when spices are prepared and/or cooked. Cleaning products contain a range of VOCs, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols and esters. Once released into the air, VOCs can undergo reactions with ozone and hydroxyl radicals to produce other VOCs, such as formaldehyde.

Some VOCs are emitted directly indoors, and some are formed through the subsequent chemical reactions. The total concentration of all VOCs (TVOC) indoors can be up to five times higher than that of outdoor levels.

New buildings experience particularly high levels of VOC off-gassing indoors because of the abundant new materials (building materials, fittings, surface coverings and treatments such as glues, paints and sealants) exposed to the indoor air, emitting multiple VOC gases. This off-gassing has a multi-exponential decay trend that is discernible over at least two years, with the most volatile compounds decaying with a time-constant of a few days, and the least volatile compounds decaying with a time-constant of a few years.

New buildings may require intensive ventilation for the first few months, or a &quot;bake-out&quot; treatment. Existing buildings may be replenished with new VOC sources, such as new furniture, consumer products, and redecoration of indoor surfaces, all of which lead to a continuous background emission of TVOCs, and requiring improved ventilation.

There are strong seasonal variations in indoors VOC emissions, with emission rates increasing in summer. This is largely due to the rate of diffusion of VOC species through materials to the surface, increasing with temperature. This leads to generally higher concentrations of TVOCs indoors in summer.

=== Indoor air-quality measurements ===
Measurement of VOCs from the indoor air is done with sorption tubes e. g. Tenax (for VOCs and SVOCs) or DNPH-cartridges (for carbonyl-compounds) or air detector. The VOCs adsorb on these materials and are afterwards desorbed either thermally (Tenax) or by elution (DNPH) and then analyzed by GC–MS/FID or HPLC. Reference gas mixtures are required for quality control of these VOC measurements. Furthermore, VOC emitting products used indoors, e.g. building products and furniture, are investigated in emission test chambers under controlled climatic conditions. For quality control of these measurements round robin tests are carried out, therefore reproducibly emitting reference materials are ideally required. Other methods have used proprietary Silcosteel-coated canisters with constant flow inlets to collect samples over several days. These methods are not limited by the adsorbing properties of materials like Tenax.

=== Regulation of indoor VOC emissions ===
In most countries, a separate definition of VOCs is used with regard to indoor air quality that comprises each organic chemical compound that can be measured as follows: adsorption from air on Tenax TA, thermal desorption, gas chromatographic separation over a 100% nonpolar column (dimethylpolysiloxane). VOC (volatile organic compounds) are all compounds that appear in the gas chromatogram between and including &quot;n&quot;-hexane and &quot;n&quot;-hexadecane. Compounds appearing earlier are called VVOC (very volatile organic compounds); compounds appearing later are called SVOC (semi-volatile organic compounds).

France, Germany (AgBB/DIBt), Belgium, Norway (TEK regulation) and Italy (CAM Edilizia) have enacted regulations to limit VOC emissions from commercial products. European industry has developed numerous voluntary ecolabels and rating systems, such as EMICODE, M1, Blue Angel, GuT (textile floor coverings), Nordic Swan Ecolabel, EU Ecolabel, and Indoor Air Comfort. In the United States, several standards exist; California Standard CDPH Section 01350 is the most common one. These regulations and standards changed the marketplace, leading to an increasing number of low-emitting products.

===Health risks===
Respiratory, allergic, or immune effects in infants or children are associated with man-made VOCs and other indoor or outdoor air pollutants.

Some VOCs, such as styrene and limonene, can react with nitrogen oxides or with ozone to produce new oxidation products and secondary aerosols, which can cause sensory irritation symptoms. VOCs contribute to the formation of tropospheric ozone and smog.

Health effects include eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches, loss of coordination, nausea, hearing disorders and damage to the liver, kidney, and central nervous system. Some VOCs are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans. Key signs or symptoms associated with exposure to VOCs include conjunctival irritation, nose and throat discomfort, headache, allergic skin reaction, dyspnea, declines in serum cholinesterase levels, nausea, vomiting, nose bleeding, fatigue, dizziness.

The ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly from those that are highly toxic to those with no known health effects. As with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect will depend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics. At present, not much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organics usually found in homes.

==== Ingestion ====
While null in comparison to the concentrations found in indoor air, benzene, toluene, and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) were found in samples of human milk and increase the concentrations of VOCs that we are exposed to throughout the day. A study notes the difference between VOCs in alveolar breath and inspired air suggesting that VOCs are ingested, metabolized, and excreted via the extra-pulmonary pathway. VOCs are also ingested by drinking water in varying concentrations. Some VOC concentrations were over the EPA&#x27;s National Primary Drinking Water Regulations and China&#x27;s National Drinking Water Standards set by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

==== Dermal absorption ====
The presence of VOCs in the air and in groundwater has prompted more studies. Several studies have been performed to measure the effects of dermal absorption of specific VOCs. Dermal exposure to VOCs like formaldehyde and toluene downregulate antimicrobial peptides on the skin like cathelicidin LL-37, human β-defensin 2 and 3. Xylene and formaldehyde worsen allergic inflammation in animal models. Toluene also increases the dysregulation of filaggrin: a key protein in dermal regulation. this was confirmed by immunofluorescence to confirm protein loss and western blotting to confirm mRNA loss. These experiments were done on human skin samples. Toluene exposure also decreased the water in the trans-epidermal layer allowing for vulnerability in the skin&#x27;s layers.

===Limit values for VOC emissions===

Limit values for VOC emissions into indoor air are published by AgBB, AFSSET, California Department of Public Health, and others. These regulations have prompted several companies in the paint and adhesive industries to adapt with VOC level reductions their products. VOC labels and certification programs may not properly assess all of the VOCs emitted from the product, including some chemical compounds that may be relevant for indoor air quality. Each ounce of colorant added to tint paint may contain between 5 and 20 grams of VOCs. A dark color, however, could require 5–15 ounces of colorant, adding up to 300 or more grams of VOCs per gallon of paint.

=== VOCs in healthcare settings ===
VOCs are also found in hospital and health care environments. In these settings, these chemicals are widely used for cleaning, disinfection, and hygiene of the different areas. Thus, health professionals such as nurses, doctors, sanitation staff, etc., may present with adverse health effects such as asthma; however, further evaluation is required to determine the exact levels and determinants that influence the exposure to these compounds.

Concentration levels of individual VOCs such as halogenated and aromatic hydrocarbons vary substantially between areas of the same hospital. Generally, ethanol, isopropanol, ether, and acetone are the main compounds in the interior of the site. Following the same line, in a study conducted in the United States, it was established that nursing assistants are the most exposed to compounds such as ethanol, while medical equipment preparers are most exposed to 2-propanol.

In relation to exposure to VOCs by cleaning and hygiene personnel, a study conducted in 4 hospitals in the United States established that sterilization and disinfection workers are linked to exposures to d-limonene and 2-propanol, while those responsible for cleaning with chlorine-containing products are more likely to have higher levels of exposure to α-pinene and chloroform. Those who perform floor and other surface cleaning tasks (e.g., floor waxing) and who use quaternary ammonium, alcohol, and chlorine-based products are associated with a higher VOC exposure than the two previous groups, that is, they are particularly linked to exposure to acetone, chloroform, α-pinene, 2-propanol or d-limonene.

Other healthcare environments such as nursing and age care homes have been rarely a subject of study, even though the elderly and vulnerable populations may spend considerable time in these indoor settings where they might be exposed to VOCs, derived from the common use of cleaning agents, sprays and fresheners. In one study, more than 200 chemicals were identified, of which 41 have adverse health effects, 37 of them being VOCs. The health effects include skin sensitization, reproductive and organ-specific toxicity, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and endocrine-disrupting properties. Furthermore, in another study carried out in the same European country, it was found that there is a significant association between breathlessness in the elderly population and elevated exposure to VOCs such as toluene and o-xylene, unlike the remainder of the population.

=== VOCs in hospitality and retail ===
Workers in hospitality are also exposed to VOCs from a variety of sources including cleaning products (air fresheners, floor cleaners, disinfectants, etc.), building materials and furnishings, as well as fragrances. One of the most common VOC found in hospitality settings are alkanes, which are a major ingredient in cleaning products (35%). Other products present in hospitality that contain alkanes are laundry detergents, paints, and lubricants. Housekeepers in particular may also be exposed to formaldehyde, which is present in some fabrics used to make towels and bedding, however exposure decreases after several washes. Some hotels still use bleach to clean, and this bleach can form chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. Fragrances are often used in hotels and are composed of many different chemicals.

There are many negative health outcomes associated with VOC exposure in hospitality. VOCs present in cleaning supplies can cause skin, eye, nose, and throat irritation, which can develop into dermatitis. VOCs in cleaning supplies can also cause more serious conditions, such as respiratory diseases and cancer. One study found that n-nonane and formaldehyde were the main drivers of eye and upper respiratory tract irritation while cancer risks were driven by chloroform and formaldehyde. Some solvent-based products have also been shown to cause damage to the kidneys and reproductive organs. One study showed that the star rating of the hotel may influence VOC exposure, as hotels with lower star ratings tend to have lower quality materials for the furnishings. Additionally, due to a movement among higher-end hotels to be more environmentally friendly, there has been a shift to using less harsh cleaning agents.

Another similar environment that exposes workers to VOCs are retail spaces. Studies have shown that retail spaces have the highest VOC concentrations compared to all other indoor spaces such as residences, offices, and vehicles. The concentration of VOCs present as well as the types depend on the type of store, but common sources of VOCs in retail spaces include motor vehicle exhaust, building materials, cleaning products, products, and fragrances. One study found that VOC concentrations were higher in retail storage spaces compared to the sales areas, particularly formaldehyde. In retail spaces, formaldehyde concentrations ranged from 8.0 to 19.4 μg/m3 compared to 14.2 to 45.0 μg/m3 in storage spaces. Occupational exposure to VOCs also depends on the task. One study found that workers were exposed to peak total VOC concentrations when they were removing the plastic film off of new products. This peak was 7 times higher than total VOC concentration peaks of all other tasks, contributing greatly to retail workers&#x27; exposure to VOCs despite being a relatively short task.

One way that VOC concentrations can be kept minimal within retail and hospitality is by ensuring there is proper air ventilation. Employers can ensure proper ventilation by placing furniture in a way that enhances air circulation, as well as checking that the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system is working properly to remove pollutants from the air. Workers can make sure that air vents are not blocked. 

==Analytical methods==
===Sampling===
Obtaining samples for analysis is challenging. VOCs, even when at dangerous levels, are dilute, so preconcentration is typically required. Many components of the atmosphere are mutually incompatible, e.g. ozone and organic compounds, peroxyacyl nitrates and many organic compounds. Furthermore, collection of VOCs by condensation in cold traps also accumulates a large amount of water, which generally must be removed selectively, depending on the analytical techniques to be employed.
Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) techniques are used to collect VOCs at low concentrations for analysis. As applied to breath analysis, the following modalities are employed for sampling: gas sampling bags, syringes, evacuated steel and glass containers.

===Principle and measurement methods===
In the U.S., standard methods have been established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and another by U.S. OSHA. Each method uses a single component solvent; butanol and hexane cannot be sampled, however, on the same sample matrix using the NIOSH or OSHA method.

VOCs are quantified and identified by two broad techniques. The major technique is gas chromatography (GC). GC instruments allow the separation of gaseous components. When coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID) GCs can detect hydrocarbons at the parts per trillion levels. Using electron capture detectors, GCs are also effective for organohalide such as chlorocarbons.

The second major technique associated with VOC analysis is mass spectrometry, which is usually coupled with GC, giving the hyphenated technique of GC-MS.

Direct injection mass spectrometry techniques are frequently utilized for the rapid detection and accurate quantification of VOCs. PTR-MS is among the methods that have been used most extensively for the on-line analysis of biogenic and anthropogenic VOCs. PTR-MS instruments based on time-of-flight mass spectrometry have been reported to reach detection limits of 20 pptv after 100 ms and 750 ppqv after 1 min. measurement (signal integration) time. The mass resolution of these devices is between 7000 and 10,500 m/Δm, thus it is possible to separate most common isobaric VOCs and quantify them independently.

===Chemical fingerprinting and breath analysis===
The exhaled human breath contains a few thousand volatile organic compounds and is used in breath biopsy to serve as a VOC biomarker to test for diseases, such as lung cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi: 10.1002/bmc.835&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One study has shown that &quot;volatile organic compounds ... are mainly blood borne and therefore enable monitoring of different processes in the body.&quot; And it appears that VOC compounds in the body &quot;may be either produced by metabolic processes or inhaled/absorbed from exogenous sources&quot; such as environmental tobacco smoke. Chemical fingerprinting and breath analysis of volatile organic compounds has also been demonstrated with chemical sensor arrays, which utilize pattern recognition for detection of component volatile organics in complex mixtures such as breath gas.

===Metrology for VOC measurements===
To achieve comparability of VOC measurements, reference standards traceable to SI units are required. For a number of VOCs gaseous reference standards are available from specialty gas suppliers or national metrology institutes, either in the form of cylinders or dynamic generation methods. However, for many VOCs, such as oxygenated VOCs, monoterpenes, or formaldehyde, no standards are available at the appropriate amount of fraction due to the chemical reactivity or adsorption of these molecules. Currently, several national metrology institutes are working on the lacking standard gas mixtures at trace level concentration, minimising adsorption processes, and improving the zero gas. The final scopes are for the traceability and the long-term stability of the standard gases to be in accordance with the data quality objectives (DQO, maximum uncertainty of 20% in this case) required by the WMO/GAW program.

<doc id="1014528" wikidata="Q7128317" url="?curid=1014528" title="List of Palmerston Forts at Portsmouth">
<text>The [[Palmerston Forts]] that encircle Portsmouth were built in response to the 1859 Royal Commission dealing with the perceived threat of a French invasion. The forts were intended to defend the Dockyard in Portsmouth. Construction was carried out by the Royal Engineers and civilian contractors (under Royal Engineer supervision). In addition to the newly constructed forts, extensive work was carried out on existing fortifications.

The Portsmouth defences can be split into four distinct groups of forts, comprising four sea forts built in the Solent, a group of forts on Portsea Island, a group of forts along Portsdown Hill overlooking Portsmouth, and a group of forts on the Gosport peninsula.

As well as these forts surrounding Portsmouth, further protection for Portsmouth was provided by additional Palmerston forts on the Isle of Wight.

== Solent forts ==
These man-made island forts were originally built to protect the eastern approaches to Portsmouth Harbour from attack by enemy forces. The four armour-plated forts were designed by Captain E. H. Stewart, overseen by Assistant Inspector General of Fortifications, Colonel W. F. D. Jervois. Construction took place between 1865 and 1880, at a total cost of £1,177,805. By the time the forts had been completed, the threat of invasion had long since passed and although the forts were armed and re-armed as technology advanced, they were never used in anger. They were decommissioned in 1956 and put up for sale in the 1960s, although they were not sold until the 1980s. The subsequent purchaser, in 2012, was Clarenco (previously known as Amazing Retreats), operated by Michael Clare. His plan was for two of the forts to be converted into hotels and one into a museum.

The restoration was completed for Spitbank Fort and No Man&#x27;s Land Fort, both hotels at the time, but not for Horse Sand Fort. In 2020, the three were listed for sale.

*Spitbank Fort 
*St Helens Fort
*Horse Sand Fort
*No Man&#x27;s Land Fort

== Portsea Island forts ==
These forts are situated on Portsea Island, the low-lying island on which most of the city of Portsmouth is located. None of the forts were originally built as a result of the 1859 Royal Commission, but they did receive improvements because of it.
*Fort Cumberland
*Eastney Batteries
*Lumps Fort
*Southsea Castle
*Point Battery
*Hilsea Lines

== Portsdown Hill forts ==
These forts are located along Portsdown Hill overlooking Portsmouth, and were a response to advancing weapons technology. This new technology made it possible for shelling accurate over a number of miles to take place. The forts were intended to prevent a hostile force landing further along the coast, approaching Portsmouth from the mainland, taking the tactical high ground to the north of the dockyard. As such, the forts are designed so that all of their main weapons face inland, protecting Portsmouth from the rest of England.
*Fort Wallington
*Fort Nelson, Portsmouth
*Fort Southwick
*Fort Widley
*Fort Purbrook
*Crookhorn Redoubt
*Farlington Redoubt

== Gosport forts ==
These are situated on the Gosport peninsula. Again, they were built to prevent an enemy force landing along the coast and approaching Portsmouth from inland, and had their main weaponry facing away from Portsmouth.
*Fort Monckton
*Fort Gilkicker
*Stokes Bay Lines
*Browndown Battery
*Fort Fareham
*Fort Gomer
*Fort Grange
*Fort Rowner
*Fort Brockhurst
*Fort Elson

<doc id="1014534" wikidata="Q2558939" url="?curid=1014534" title="Projectively extended real line">
<text>In real analysis, the projectively extended real line (also called the one-point compactification of the real line), is the extension of the set of the real numbers, formula_1, by a point denoted . It is thus the set formula_2 with the standard arithmetic operations extended where possible, and is sometimes denoted by formula_3 or formula_4 The added point is called the point at infinity, because it is considered as a neighbour of both ends of the real line. More precisely, the point at infinity is the limit of every sequence of real numbers whose absolute values are increasing and unbounded.

The projectively extended real line may be identified with a real projective line in which three points have been assigned the specific values , and . The projectively extended real number line is distinct from the affinely extended real number line, in which and are distinct.

== Dividing by zero ==

Unlike most mathematical models of numbers, this structure allows division by zero:
: formula_5
for nonzero &quot;a&quot;. In particular, and , making the reciprocal function a total function in this structure. The structure, however, is not a field, and none of the binary arithmetic operations are total – for example, is undefined, even though the reciprocal is total. It has usable interpretations, however – for example, in geometry, the slope of a vertical line is .

== Extensions of the real line ==

The projectively extended real line extends the field of real numbers in the same way that the Riemann sphere extends the field of complex numbers, by adding a single point called conventionally .

In contrast, the affinely extended real number line (also called the two-point compactification of the real line) distinguishes between and .

== Order ==

The order relation cannot be extended to formula_6 in a meaningful way. Given a number , there is no convincing argument to define either or that . Since can&#x27;t be compared with any of the other elements, there&#x27;s no point in retaining this relation on formula_6. However, order on formula_1 is used in definitions in formula_6.

== Geometry ==

Fundamental to the idea that is a point &quot;no different from any other&quot; is the way the real projective line is a homogeneous space, in fact homeomorphic to a circle. For example the general linear group of 2 × 2 real invertible matrices has a transitive action on it. The group action may be expressed by Möbius transformations (also called linear fractional transformations), with the understanding that when the denominator of the linear fractional transformation is , the image is .

The detailed analysis of the action shows that for any three distinct points &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;R&quot;, there is a linear fractional transformation taking &quot;P&quot; to 0, &quot;Q&quot; to 1, and &quot;R&quot; to that is, the group of linear fractional transformations is triply transitive on the real projective line. This cannot be extended to 4-tuples of points, because the cross-ratio is invariant.

The terminology projective line is appropriate, because the points are in 1-to-1 correspondence with one-dimensional linear subspaces of formula_10.

== Arithmetic operations ==

=== Motivation for arithmetic operations ===
The arithmetic operations on this space are an extension of the same operations on reals. A motivation for the new definitions is the limits of functions of real numbers.

=== Arithmetic operations that are defined ===
In addition to the standard operations on the subset formula_1 of formula_6, the following operations are defined for formula_13, with exceptions as indicated:
:formula_14

=== Arithmetic operations that are left undefined ===
The following expressions cannot be motivated by considering limits of real functions, and no definition of them allows the statement of the standard algebraic properties to be retained unchanged in form for all defined cases.&lt;/math&gt;, resolve to the standard rules: see Wheel theory.}} Consequently, they are left undefined:
:formula_15
The exponential function formula_16 cannot be extended to formula_6.

== Algebraic properties ==
The following equalities mean: &quot;Either both sides are undefined, or both sides are defined and equal.&quot; This is true for any formula_18
:formula_19
The following is true whenever expressions involved are defined, for any formula_18
:formula_21
In general, all laws of arithmetic that are valid for formula_1 are also valid for formula_6 whenever all the occurring expressions are defined.

== Intervals and topology ==
The concept of an interval can be extended to formula_6. However, since it is not an ordered set, the interval has a slightly different meaning. The definitions for closed intervals are as follows (it is assumed that 
formula_25):

: formula_26

With the exception of when the end-points are equal, the corresponding open and half-open intervals are defined by removing the respective endpoints. This redefinition is useful in interval arithmetic when dividing by an interval containing 0.

formula_6 and the empty set are also intervals, as is formula_6 excluding any single point.&lt;/math&gt; (where the interval on either side is defined), all intervals excluding formula_29 and formula_6 may be naturally represented using this notation, with formula_31 being interpreted as formula_32, and half-open intervals with equal endpoints, e.g. formula_33, remaining undefined.}}

The open intervals as a base define a topology on formula_6. Sufficient for a base are the bounded open intervals in formula_1 and the intervals formula_36 for all formula_37 such that formula_38

As said, the topology is homeomorphic to a circle. Thus it is metrizable corresponding (for a given homeomorphism) to the ordinary metric on this circle (either measured straight or along the circle). There is no metric which is an extension of the ordinary metric on formula_39

== Interval arithmetic ==
Interval arithmetic extends to formula_6 from formula_1. The result of an arithmetic operation on intervals is always an interval, except when the intervals with a binary operation contain incompatible values leading to an undefined result. In particular, we have, for every formula_42:
:formula_43
irrespective of whether either interval includes and .

== Calculus ==
The tools of calculus can be used to analyze functions of formula_6. The definitions are motivated by the topology of this space.

=== Neighbourhoods ===
Let formula_45 and formula_46.
* is a neighbourhood of , if contains an open interval that contains .
* is a right-sided neighbourhood of , if there is a real number such that formula_47 and contains the semi-open interval formula_48.
* is a left-sided neighbourhood of , if there is a real number such that formula_47 and contains the semi-open interval formula_50.
* is a punctured neighbourhood (resp. a right-sided or a left-sided punctured neighbourhood) of , if formula_51 and formula_52 is a neighbourhood (resp. a right-sided or a left-sided neighbourhood) of .

=== Limits ===

==== Basic definitions of limits ====
Let formula_53 formula_54 and formula_55.

The limit of &quot;f&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;x&quot;) as approaches &quot;p&quot; is &quot;L&quot;, denoted
: formula_56
if and only if for every neighbourhood &quot;A&quot; of &quot;L&quot;, there is a punctured neighbourhood &quot;B&quot; of &quot;p&quot;, such that formula_57 implies formula_58.

The one-sided limit of &quot;f&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;x&quot;) as &quot;x&quot; approaches &quot;p&quot; from the right (left) is &quot;L&quot;, denoted
: formula_59
if and only if for every neighbourhood &quot;A&quot; of &quot;L&quot;, there is a right-sided (left-sided) punctured neighbourhood &quot;B&quot; of &quot;p&quot;, such that formula_57 implies formula_61

It can be shown that formula_56 if and only if both formula_63 and formula_64.

==== Comparison with limits in formula_1 ====
The definitions given above can be compared with the usual definitions of limits of real functions. In the following statements, formula_66 the first limit is as defined above, and the second limit is in the usual sense:
* formula_56 is equivalent to formula_56
* formula_69 is equivalent to formula_70
* formula_71 is equivalent to formula_72
* formula_73 is equivalent to formula_74
* formula_75 is equivalent to formula_76
* formula_77 is equivalent to formula_78

==== Extended definition of limits ====
Let formula_46. Then &quot;p&quot; is a limit point of &quot;A&quot; if and only if every neighbourhood of &quot;p&quot; includes a point formula_80 such that formula_81

Let formula_82, &quot;p&quot; a limit point of &quot;A&quot;. The limit of &quot;f&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;x&quot;) as &quot;x&quot; approaches &quot;p&quot; through &quot;A&quot; is &quot;L&quot;, if and only if for every neighbourhood &quot;B&quot; of &quot;L&quot;, there is a punctured neighbourhood &quot;C&quot; of &quot;p&quot;, such that formula_83 implies formula_84

This corresponds to the regular topological definition of continuity, applied to the subspace topology on formula_85 and the restriction of &quot;f&quot; to formula_86

=== Continuity ===

The function
: formula_87
is continuous at if and only if is defined at and
: formula_88

If formula_89 the function
: formula_90
is continuous in if and only if, for every formula_91, is defined at and the limit of formula_92 as tends to through is formula_93

Every rational function , where and are polynomials, can be prolongated, in a unique way, to a function from formula_6 to formula_6 that is continuous in formula_4 In particular, this is the case of polynomial functions, which take the value formula_97 at formula_98 if they are not constant.

Also, if the tangent function formula_99 is extended so that
: formula_100
then formula_99 is continuous in formula_102 but cannot be prolongated further to a function that is continuous in formula_4

Many elementary functions that are continuous in formula_104 cannot be prolongated to functions that are continuous in formula_105 This is the case, for example, of the exponential function and all trigonometric functions. For example, the sine function is continuous in formula_102 but it cannot be made continuous at formula_107 As seen above, the tangent function can be prolongated to a function that is continuous in formula_102 but this function cannot be made continuous at formula_107

Many discontinuous functions that become continuous when the codomain is extended to formula_6 remain discontinuous if the codomain is extended to the affinely extended real number system formula_111 This is the case of the function formula_112 On the other hand, some functions that are continuous in formula_104 and discontinuous at formula_114 become continuous if the domain is extended to formula_111 This is the case for the arctangent.

== As a projective range ==

When the real projective line is considered in the context of the real projective plane, then the consequences of Desargues&#x27; theorem are implicit. In particular, the construction of the projective harmonic conjugate relation between points is part of the structure of the real projective line. For instance, given any pair of points, the point at infinity is the projective harmonic conjugate of their midpoint.

As projectivities preserve the harmonic relation, they form the automorphisms of the real projective line. The projectivities are described algebraically as homographies, since the real numbers form a ring, according to the general construction of a projective line over a ring. Collectively they form the group PGL(2, R).

The projectivities which are their own inverses are called involutions. A hyperbolic involution has two fixed points. Two of these correspond to elementary, arithmetic operations on the real projective line: negation and reciprocation. Indeed, 0 and ∞ are fixed under negation, while 1 and −1 are fixed under reciprocation.

<doc id="1014550" wikidata="Q5471001" url="?curid=1014550" title="Fort Cumberland (England)">
<text>Fort Cumberland is a pentagonal artillery fortification erected to guard the entrance to Langstone Harbour, east of the Dockyard of Portsmouth on the south coast of England. It was sited to protect the Royal Navy Dockyard, by preventing enemy forces from landing in Langstone Harbour and attacking from the landward side. Fort Cumberland is widely recognised as the finest example of a bastion trace fort in England. It is a scheduled monument and a Grade II* listed building

==The first fort (1747-1785)==

The first fort on the site was built by the Duke of Cumberland. Although there did previously exist an earthwork battery on the site, built in 1714. Work on Cumberland&#x27;s fort commenced on 1 January 1747 and was substantially complete by the end of 1748. The fort had an irregular star shaped form, and was of earthwork construction. In section, the defences comprised a glacis, banquette and covered way, a dry ditch, berm, rampart, parapet and terre-plein. Within the body of the fort, a number of brick buildings were constructed, comprising a guardhouse, storeroom and powder magazine; of the two proposed barrack blocks, only one is believed to have been completed.

==The second fort (1785-1812)==

Fort Cumberland was completely rebuilt in masonry, and on a considerably larger scale, as part of a programme to improve the fortifications of Portsmouth. Major building work started in 1785, although preliminary stockpiling of materials began in 1782, and was essentially completed by 1812. In the course of construction all traces of the original fort were destroyed, with the exception of the guard house and store room, both of which were incorporated into the new design. The second fort occupies a similar position to the first, but is substantially larger in scale, enclosing an area of , and on a different alignment. It is a pentagonal fort, with five bastions and a ravelin on the western side. It was the last fort with angle bastions to be built in the United Kingdom, and the first to provide casemated ordnance.

==Re-armament: the 1850s - 1860s==

By the late 1850s, the development of rifled cannon had rendered the fort&#x27;s smooth bored muzzle loading ordnance obsolete. In late 1858 the fort was transferred from the War Department to the Board of Admiralty and, in 1859 it became the headquarters of the Royal Marine Artillery. Between 1860 and 1861, the defences were improved to accommodate new muzzle loaded Armstrong guns.

==Re-armament: the 1880s - 1890s==

Between 1886 and 1892, major modifications were made to three of the bastions to accommodate new armaments, 6inch B.L. MkIV guns on Mark IV Hydropneumatic Disappearing mountings. These modifications included cutting down the bastions and infilling them internally, and the creation of new magazines underneath. By 1892, the fort was equipped with three BLs, two RMLs and 1 64 pounder.

==The fort in the 20th century==

Fort Cumberland remained in military ownership for most of the twentieth century, serving as a base for the Royal Marine Artillery howitzer and anti aircraft brigade, and later for the Royal Marine Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisation, as an experimental and training centre. Beginning in 1938, Fort Cumberland also provided space for the Inter-Service Training and Development Centre. The fort saw brief action during the Second World War when, on 26 August 1940, it was hit by a German air raid in which eight Royal Marines were killed, amongst them Second Lieutenant Harold Jameson. It was used by the Royal Marines into the 1970s.

In 1964 the fort was scheduled as an ancient monument, and subsequently taken into the guardianship of English Heritage in 1975. Since that time, the fort has served as a base for English Heritage&#x27;s archaeological team, the Central Archaeology Service (formerly the Central Excavation Unit). In 1998, the Ancient Monuments Laboratory were relocated to the fort, leading to the creation of a new Centre for Archaeology. Currently access is limited to pre-booked guided tours.

The Fort is now a Grade II* Listed Building, and many of its surrounding buildings, for example the Guard House, Hospital and Officers&#x27; Quarters, are Listed Grade II.
Since 2018 the fort has housed The Portsmouth Distillery Co. in a number of the casements. The distillery produces both rum and gin. The fort is also home to two veterans charities, Company of Makers and Forgotten Veterans UK.

<doc id="1014551" wikidata="Q7341861" url="?curid=1014551" title="Robert Barclay Allardice">
<text>Robert Barclay Allardice of Ury (25 August 1779, Stonehaven, Kincardineshire – 1 May 1854), generally known as Captain Barclay, was a notable Scottish walker of the early 19th century, known as the celebrated pedestrian. His most famous feat was walking 1000 miles in 1000 hours for 1000 guineas in 1809. He is considered the father of the 19th-century sport of pedestrianism, a precursor to racewalking.

He should not be confused with his father, who had assumed the name Robert Barclay Allardice and undertook the first redevelopment of the town of Stonehaven.

== Family ==
Robert Barclay Allardice was a member of an ancient Scottish family (see Clan Barclay) and the great-great-grandson of Robert Barclay, 2nd of Ury (1648–1690), who in 1678 published a noted &quot;Apology&quot; (i.e. defence) of the Quaker faith. The family that founded Barclays Bank was descended from this 2nd Laird.

Captain Barclay&#x27;s father was Robert Barclay, 5th of Ury (1732–1797), MP for Kincardineshire from 1788. The MP was descended via his mother, Une, daughter of Ewen Cameron of Lochiel from Clan Cameron. The 5th laird&#x27;s first wife (and cousin) was Lucy, daughter of David Barclay of Cheapside, a wealthy London merchant. She died in childbirth, leaving a daughter, also Lucy, who married Samuel Galton Jr. of the Lunar Society.

Robert Senior remarried many years later, in 1776, Sarah Ann Allardice, a descendant of Robert II of Scotland and of the Earls of Airth, Menteith and Strathearn. In recognition of the nobility of his wife&#x27;s family Robert Barclay thenceforth took the surname of Allardice. Robert Barclay Allardice, the subject of this article, was born the year after the marriage. Several brothers and sisters followed.

Several of the Barclay family were noted for unusual strength. The first Laird of Ury was reputed one of the strongest men in the country at the time of the English Civil War, and Robert Barclay Allardice senior was himself a noted pedestrian, who once walked 510 miles (820 km) from Ury to London in 10 days.

Captain Barclay made his home at Fritwell Manor in Oxfordshire.

== Feats of pedestrianism ==
* In 1801 Captain Barclay walked 110 miles (177 km) in in a muddy park
* In 1802 Barclay walked 64 miles (103 km) in 10 hours
* In 1805 Barclay walked 72 miles (116 km) between breakfast and dinner
* In 1806 Barclay walked 100 miles (161 km) over bad roads in 19 hours
* In 1807 Barclay walked 78 miles (125 km) on hilly roads in 14 hours

== The thousand-hour walk ==
Captain Barclay&#x27;s most famous exploit took place between 1 June and 12 July 1809 at Newmarket, during which he walked 1 mile (1.6 km) in each of 1000 successive hours to win an initial wager of 1000 guineas.

The enterprise quite caught the public imagination. &quot;The Times&quot;, which carried little general interest news, printed this report alongside an account of the campaigns of Marshal Soult in the Peninsular War (14 July):
:The gentleman on Wednesday completed his arduous pedestrian undertaking, to walk a thousand miles in a thousand successive hours, at the rate of a mile in each and every hour. He had until four o&#x27;clock P.M. to finish his task; but he performed his last mile in the quarter of an hour after three, with perfect ease and great spirit, amidst an immense concourse of spectators. The influx of company had so much increased on Sunday, that it was recommended that the ground should be roped in. To this, Captain Barclay at first objected; but the crowd became so great on Monday, and he had experienced so much interruption, that he was at last prevailed upon to allow this precaution to be taken. For the last two days he appeared in higher spirits, and performed his walk with apparently more ease, and in shorter time than he had done for some days before. With the change of the weather, he had thrown off his loose great coat, which he wore during the rainy period, and on Wednesday performed in a flannel jacket. He also put on shoes thicker than any which he had used in the earlier part of his performance. He said that during the first night after his walk he would have himself awoke twice or thrice, to avoid the danger of a too sudden transition from almost constant exertion to a state of long repose.

:One hundred to one, and indeed any odds whatever, were offered on Wednesday; but so strong was the confidence in his success, that no bets could be obtained. The multitude of people who resorted to the scene of action, in the course of the concluding days, was unprecedented. Not a bed could be procured on Tuesday night at Newmarket, Cambridge, or any of the towns and villages in the vicinity, and every horse and every species of vehicle was engaged. Among the Nobility and Gentry who witnessed the conclusion of this extraordinary feat, were:—

:The Dukes of Argyle and St. Alban&#x27;s; Earls Grosvenor, Bessborough and Jersey; Lords Foley and Somerville; Sir John Lode, Sir F. Standish, &amp;c. &amp;c.

:Capt Barclay had a large sum depending upon his undertaking. The aggregate of the bets is supposed to amount to £100,000.—He commenced his feat on the first of June.

During the 42 days of this exercise his time per mile increased and his weight dropped (186 lbs) (154 lbs). If the report of the total wagers was accurate they were equivalent to some £5 million ($US 8 million) in modern terms.

The first woman to emulate his feat successfully was Emma Sharp.

==Financial backer and trainer of boxers==
In addition to walking Captain Barclay was active in the financial backing and training of bare-knuckle fighters. The most celebrated fighters that he trained were Tom Molineaux and Tom Cribb, (Champion of England).

== Army career ==
Captain Barclay&#x27;s rank was in the 23rd Regiment of Foot, which he joined in 1805. In 1809 he served as aide-de-camp to the Marquess of Huntly on the ill-fated Walcheren Campaign, starting out just 5 days after the completion of the 1000-mile feat.

== Claims to titles ==
Captain Barclay claimed the Earldom of Airth, his lawyers claiming that this title could be inherited through the female line. The claim was rejected by the House of Lords in 1839. A similar claim to the Earldoms of Menteith and Strathearn was not pursued. A curious aside to the latter claim is that it would have implied that Captain Barclay was the rightful King of Scotland.

== Descent of the title ==
Captain Barclay died in 1854 from injuries from the kick of a horse. The only surviving child from his marriage was a daughter, Margaret, who had moved to America but eventually resettled in Great Britain and retired to Cornwall with her eldest son, also a Robert Barclay-Allardice (who later became Mayor of Lostwithiel between 1899-1901 and 1904-6). This Robert Barclay-Allardice married and had one daughter, Mary Graham Barclay-Allardice, whose descendants (through an only daughter, Margaret – the great-great granddaughter of Captain Barclay) live in Gloucestershire and Hampshire.

The Lairdship of Ury, heritable only through the male line, passed to a third cousin, Charles Barclay, who lived in Surrey.

<text>The Jamaica national football team, nicknamed the &quot;Reggae Boyz&quot;, represents Jamaica in men&#x27;s international football. The team&#x27;s first match was against Haiti in 1925. The squad is under the supervising body of the Jamaica Football Federation (JFF), which is a member of the Caribbean Football Union (CFU), Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), and the global jurisdiction of FIFA. Jamaica&#x27;s home matches have been played at Independence Park since its opening in 1962

Their sole appearance in the FIFA World Cup was in 1998, where the team finished third in its group and failed to advance. The team also competed in the Caribbean Cup winning six times. Jamaica also competes in the CONCACAF Gold Cup, appearing thirteen times and finishing twice as runners-up to Mexico in 2015 and the United States in 2017. They were also invited to the Copa América in 2015 and 2016, being eliminated in the group stage on both occasions. Jamaica also qualified for the 2024 Copa América.

==History==

=== Early history (1786–1962) ===
In 1893, Jamaica&#x27;s first football club, the Kingston Cricket Club, was formed. In 1910, the Jamaica Football Federation (JFF) was formed and controlled all of the games. The first game was played on 22 March 1925, as the opener in a three game series against Haiti. Jamaica won the first game, 2 to 1, followed by victories of 3-0 and 1-0 in the other two. In 1926, Jamaica hosted Haiti at Sabina Park and won 6–0. At the 1930 Central American Games in Cuba, Jamaica made its first international tournament appearance and lost both games in its group.
From 1925 to 1962, Jamaica had regular games with teams from Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti, and Cuba, as well as with clubs like the Haitian Racing CH and Violette AC, the British Corinthians, and the Argentinean Tigers.

In 1952, the Caribbean All-Star team was formed with players from Trinidad, Cuba, Haiti, and Suriname. The team played four matches against Jamaica in Sabina Park. Jamaica won the second game 2–1 and the fourth 1–0, and the All-Stars won the first game 5–1 and the third 1–0.

===Post-independence (1962–1989)===
In 1962, the same year Jamaica became independent, the JFF became a member of FIFA. At the 1962 Central American and Caribbean Games played in Jamaica, the national team was led by Brazilian coach Jorge Penna. Jamaica finished in fourth place, with two wins over Puerto Rico and Cuba. A year later, Jamaica competed in the first CONCACAF Championship in El Salvador, where the team finished last in its group, which included Mexico, the Netherlands Antilles, and eventual winner Costa Rica.

In 1965, Jamaica attempted to qualify for the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England. After finishing first in its preliminary group that included Cuba and the Netherlands Antilles; Jamaica faced Costa Rica and Mexico in the final round, where the winner would qualify for the World Cup. Opening the final round campaign with a 3–2 loss at home against Mexico, Jamaica lost the return match 8–0, with Isidoro Díaz getting a hat-trick for Mexico. Jamaica then lost 7–0 to Costa Rica and ended with a draw at home in the return match, ultimately finishing with a single point. In January 1967, Jamaica attempted to qualify for the CONCACAF Championship but was eliminated after finishing third in the group of five.

In 1968, George Hamilton became the new coach as Jamaica attempted to qualify for the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. Most of the squad for the campaign was young with only a few remaining players from its previous attempt at qualifying being in the team. This was due to most of its players being either retired or migrated abroad. Jamaica finished last with zero points from four games. After finishing last in the 1969 CONCACAF Championship and not qualifying for the following championship, Jamaica had to withdraw from qualifying for the 1973 CONCACAF Championship after 17 players were suspended for poor behavior during a tour to Bermuda. In 1977, Jamaica competed in qualifying for the 1977 CONCACAF Championship, which was also the qualifier for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Taking on Cuba in the first round, Jamaica lost both of its games 5–1 on aggregate.

Jamaica did not attempt to qualify for the 1982 and 1986 due to insufficient funds and a poorly prepared team. The team returned to international competition after qualifying for the 1989 CONCACAF Championship, which was part of the qualifiers for the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. After defeating Puerto Rico 3–1 on aggregate in the preliminary round, Jamaica played the United States for a spot in the finals. After a 0–0 draw at home, Jamaica lost 5–1 in the US and was eliminated.

===Caribbean triumph and World Cup appearance (1990–2000)===
In 1990, Carl Brown was signed as head coach and led Jamaica into qualifying for the 1990 Caribbean Cup, finishing tied for third place after the final round was abandoned due to Tropical Storm Arthur. In 1991, Jamaica defeated Trinidad and Tobago 2–0 to win the Caribbean Cup and qualify for the CONCACAF Gold Cup. In the Gold Cup, Jamaica finished last with zero points in a group consisting of Honduras, Mexico, and Canada.

After the Jamaicans lost to Trinidad and Tobago in the final of the 1992 Caribbean Cup, they started their campaign in preliminary rounds of qualifying for the 1994 World Cup. After defeating Puerto Rico 3–1 on aggregate in the second preliminary round, Jamaica eliminated Trinidad and Tobago and was grouped with Bermuda, Canada, and El Salvador, two of which would advance to the final round. Jamaica opened the second round with two 1–1 draws against Canada and Bermuda, but the team lost its return match in Canada after a single goal from Dale Mitchell. After a 3–2 home win over Bermuda and two losses to El Salvador, Jamaica finished in third place and was eliminated.

In 1993, Jamaica finished in second place after losing on penalties to Martinique in the final of the Caribbean Cup, which was a qualifier for the CONCACAF Gold Cup which was held later that year. During this tournament, the team opened with a 1–0 loss to the US before recording their first Gold Cup win against Honduras. After qualifying in second place with a 1–1 draw against Honduras, Jamaica lost 6–1 to Mexico in the semi-final in Mexico City. After not qualifying for the final round of the 1994 Caribbean Cup despite recording its largest-ever win margin in a 12–0 win against the British Virgin Islands, the team decided to hire Brazilian René Simões to assist Brown with the goal of qualifying for the 1998 World Cup. After being eliminated in the group stage of both the 1995 Caribbean Cup by virtue of head-to-head and the 1996 Caribbean Cup, Jamaica opened its 1998 World Cup qualifiers with an 2–0 aggregate win over Suriname and defeated Barbados 3–0 in the following round. In 1997, Simões, by then promoted to head coach, scouted for players in England that had Jamaican heritage to join the national team. Paul Hall, Fitzroy Simpson, Deon Burton and Robbie Earle were all named in the squad due their heritage. The term &#x27;UB40&#x27; became used in Jamaica and more widely to describe their British-born players such as Hall and Gayle, the term is a nod to the English band UB40, who perform reggae, a genre of music that originated in Jamaica. After finishing winless in the first four games of the final qualifying round, Jamaica recorded three 1–0 wins over El Salvador, Canada, and Costa Rica, with Burton scoring the winning goal in each of the latter two matches. After a 0–0 draw against Mexico, Jamaica secured its qualification and made its first-ever World Cup appearance, and the following day was declared a national holiday.

In 1998, Jamaica competed at the 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup, finishing first in a group comprising World Cup champion Brazil, Guatemala, and El Salvador. With the help of goalkeeper Warren Barrett, Jamaica opened with a 0–0 tie against Brazil. After wins over Guatemala and El Salvador, Jamaica advanced to the semi-final against Mexico. The match went into overtime before Mexican player Luis Hernandez scored the winning goal. In the third-place playoff, Jamaica lost 1–0 to Brazil, ending in fourth place. At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Jamaica finished third in Group H with three points from a 2–1 win against Japan in Lyon. Theodore Whitmore scored both goals in the victory.

The following month, Jamaica competed in the finals of the 1998 Caribbean Cup, which was a qualifier for the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. After finishing first in its group, Jamaica won the final 2–1 against Trinidad and Tobago, with goals from Oneil McDonald and Dean Sewell. In 1999, Jamaica experienced its biggest defeat in a 9–0 loss against Costa Rica. After finishing second in its group, Jamaica was eliminated by Cuba in the semi-finals of the 1999 Caribbean Cup. At the Gold Cup, Jamaica finished last in its group, losing against Colombia and Honduras 2–0 and 1–0, respectively.

In the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification semi-finals, Jamaica faced Honduras, El Salvador, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the second group. Jamaica finished second, securing a spot in the final round despite losing two games to Honduras and El Salvador. In the final round of qualifying, Jamaica finished in fifth place after being eliminating by Honduras. Between the two rounds of World Cup qualifying, Jamaica was eliminated in the group stage of the 2001 Caribbean Cup by goal-difference and missed out on qualifying for the Gold Cup the following year. Jamaica qualified for the 2003 Gold Cup, reaching the quarter-finals before being eliminated by Mexico 5–0 at the Estadio Azteca.

Jamaica started its 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign in the second round with a 4–1 aggregate win over Haiti to reach the third round. Jamaica finished third in group play, with a 1–1 draw against the US and one point away from reaching the next round. Coach Sebastião Lazaroni was sacked due to the team&#x27;s performance. In the 2005 Caribbean Cup, Jamaica tied its largest-ever win margin record with a 12–0 win over Saint Martin, with Luton Shelton and Roland Dean both getting hat-tricks. After reaching the final with wins against Saint Lucia and French Guiana, Jamaica claimed its third title and a spot at the Gold Cup. At the Gold Cup, Jamaica reached the quarter-finals before losing to the US 3–1 in Foxborough, with American player DaMarcus Beasley scoring two goals.

In 2006 and 2007, Jamaica continued to struggle, with one Jamaican journalist dubbing the team &quot;The Reggae Toyz&quot;. The team failed to qualify for the 2007 Caribbean Cup after being eliminated due to goals scored, with St. Vincent and the Grenadines scoring three more goals than Jamaica. Two managers later, the team only earned a single point from three matches in the third round of qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. With coach Theodore Whitmore, Jamaica secured three wins from its remaining matches, jumping from 116th to 83rd place in the world rankings. Despite the team&#x27;s final win over Canada, Jamaica was eliminated by goal difference after Mexico finished three goals ahead.

Jamaica later qualified with a 4–1 win over Antigua and Barbuda, finishing two goals ahead of Guatemala in its group. After the team finished last in its group for the 2012 Caribbean Cup and failed to record a win in six matches in the fourth round of qualifying, team manager Theodore Whitmore resigned and was replaced by German coach Winfried Schäfer. After a 2–0 loss to the US, Jamaica finished in last place and was eliminated.

After qualifying for the 2015 Gold Cup due to winning the 2014 Caribbean Cup, Jamaica was invited to compete in the 2015 edition of the Copa América in Chile. At the Copa America, Jamaica was drawn in Group B with Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina.

<text>The Grande Dixence Dam () is a concrete gravity dam on the Dixence at the head of the Val d&#x27;Hérémence in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. At high, it is the tallest gravity dam in the world, seventh tallest dam overall, and the tallest dam in Europe. It is part of the Cleuson-Dixence Complex. With the primary purpose of hydroelectric power generation, the dam fuels four power stations, totaling the installed capacity to , generating approximately annually, enough to power 400,000 Swiss households.

The dam withholds the Lac des Dix (&#x27;Lake of the Ten&#x27;), its reservoir. With a surface area of 4 km2, it is the second largest lake in Valais and the largest lake above 2,000 m in the Alps. The reservoir receives its water from four different pumping stations; the Z’Mutt, Stafel, Ferpècle and Arolla. At peak capacity, it contains approximately of water, with depths reaching up to . Construction on the dam began in 1950 and was completed in 1961, before officially commissioning in 1965.

== History ==

In 1922, Energie Ouest Suisse (EOS) became established with a few small power stations. To generate substantial amounts of electricity, EOS looked to the Valais canton which contains 56% of Switzerland&#x27;s glaciers and stores the largest amount of water in Europe. In 1927, EOS acquired the license for the upper Dixence basin. In 1929, 1,200 workers constructed the first Dixence dam which would be complete in 1935. The first dam would supply water to the Chandoline Power Station which has a capacity of 120 MW.

After the Second World War, growing industries needed electricity and construction on the Cleuson Dam began in 1947 and was completed in 1951. The original Dixence dam was submerged by the filling of Lac des Dix beginning in 1957, it can still be seen when the reservoir level is low.
Plans for the Super Dixence Dam were finalized by the recently founded company, Grande Dixence SA. Construction on the Super Dixence Dam began in late 1950. By 1961, 3,000 workers had finished pouring of concrete, completing the dam. 
At 285 m, it was the world&#x27;s tallest dam at the time, but it was surpassed by the Nurek Dam of Tajikistan in 1972 (300 m). It remains the world&#x27;s tallest gravity dam.

In the 1980s, Grande Dixence SA and EOS began the Cleuson-Dixence project which improved the quality of electricity produced by building new tunnels along with the Bieudron Power Station. By the time the Cleuson-Dixence Complex was complete, the power generated had more than doubled.

A short documentary film, &quot;Opération béton,&quot; was made about the dam&#x27;s construction by Jean-Luc Godard as first-time director.

== Characteristics ==

The Grande Dixence Dam is a high, long concrete gravity dam. The dam is wide at its base and wide at its crest. The dam&#x27;s crest reaches an altitude of . The dam structure contains approximately of concrete. To secure the dam to the surrounding foundation, a grout curtain surrounds the dam, reaching a depth of and extending on each side of the valley.

Although the dam is situated on the relatively small Dixence, water supplied from other rivers and streams is pumped by the Z’Mutt, Stafel, Ferpècle and Arolla pumping stations. The pumping stations transport the water through of tunnels into Lac des Dix. Water from the high Cleuson Dam, located to the northwest, is also transported from its reservoir, the Lac de Cleuson. Three penstocks transport water from Lac des Dix to the Chandoline, Fionnay, Nendaz and Bieudron power stations, before being discharged into the Rhône below. All the pumping stations, power stations and dams form the Cleuson-Dixence Complex. Although the complex operates with water being pumped from one reservoir to another, it does not technically qualify as a pumped-storage scheme.

Most of the water comes from glaciers melting during the summer. The lake is usually at full capacity by late September, and empties during the winter, eventually reaching its lowest point around April.

== Power stations ==
=== Chandoline Power Station ===
The Chandoline Power Station was the power station for the original Dixence Dam. The Grande Dixence Dam submerged the original dam but the power station still operates with water received from the reservoir of the Grande Dixence Dam, Lac des Dix. The power station is the smallest of the four, producing from five Pelton turbines with a gross head of .

=== Fionnay Power Station ===
The Fionnay Power Station receives water from the Grande Dixence Dam by a long tunnel with an average gradient of 10%. Once the tunnel reaches a surge chamber at Louvie in Bagnes, it turns into a penstock which descends at a gradient of 73% for until it reaches the power station. The water, now flowing at a maximum rate of spins six Pelton turbines, generating a combined maximum capacity of .

==== Nendaz Power Station ====
After arriving at the Fionnay Power Station from the Grande Dixence Dam, water then travels through a pressure tunnel which eventually leads into the Péroua surge chamber, above the Nendaz Power Station. The water, which remains at a maximum rate of spins six Pelton turbines, generating a combined maximum capacity of .

The Nendaz power station is located within mountains between Aproz and Riddes and is the second-largest hydroelectric power station in Switzerland after the Bieudron Power Station.

=== Bieudron Power Station ===
The water travels down a long penstock from the Grande Dixence Dam before reaching the Bieudron Power Station down. The water spins three pelton turbines, generating a combined capacity of . The power station was constructed after the Nendaz and Fionnay power stations. The power station was built by both Grande Dixence SA and Energie Ouest Suisse between 1993 and 1998 at a cost of US$1.2 billion.
The Bieudron Power Station alone holds three world records, for the height of its head (), the output of each Pelton turbine and the output per pole of the generators . It was taken out of service in December 2000 after the rupture of a penstock. The power station became partially operational in December 2009 and fully operational in 2010.

<text>Saint Aubert, also known as Saint Autbert, was bishop of Avranches in the 8th century and is credited with founding Mont Saint-Michel.

==Life==

Aubert lived in France during the reign of Childebert III (695-711) and died about 720. He was born of a noble family from Genetas, and received an extensive education. When the See of Avranches became vacant, Aubert, known for his wisdom and piety, was chosen bishop.

==Legend==

In 708 Aubert had a vision in which the Archangel Michael instructed him to build an oratory on the rocky tidal island at the mouth of the Couesnon. Aubert did not pay attention to this vision at first, doubting it was a true vision. The archangel appeared a second time, but still Aubert hesitated, lest this be a demonic manifestation. At last in exasperation Michael appeared to him again, this time poking him in his head and ordering him to complete the task. Where the archangel touched him, Aubert was left with a hole in his skull. After this the oratory was built. It was dedicated on 16 October 709. Here he at first established canons; then the Benedictines. Aubert is reputed to have been buried at the oratory.

The relic of Aubert&#x27;s skull, complete with hole where the archangel&#x27;s finger pierced it, can still be seen at the Saint-Gervais Basilica in Avranches. Skeptics suggest that the skull is in fact a historic relic showing evidence of trepanation.

Aubert is regarded as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church, with a feast day of 10 September.

<text>Clarence Page (born June 2, 1947) is an American journalist, syndicated columnist, and senior member of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; editorial board.

==Early years==
Page was born in Dayton, Ohio, and attended Middletown High School in Middletown where he worked on the school&#x27;s bi-weekly newspaper. After graduating in 1965, he worked freelance as a writer and photographer for &quot;The Middletown Journal&quot; and &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, while he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in journalism from Ohio University.

==Career==
After his graduation from university in 1969, Page took a position with &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;, and was drafted into the military after only six months with the paper. He found himself assigned as an Army journalist with the 212th Artillery Group at Fort Lewis, Washington, when his obligation ended and he made his way back to the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1971.

Page is a frequent panelist on &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; (on hiatus as of January, 2021), a regular contributor of essays to &quot;The PBS NewsHour&quot;, host of several documentaries on the Public Broadcasting Service, and an occasional commentator on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition Sunday&quot;. Page often appears as a political analyst on the &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot; on MSNBC. He also appeared in the 1993 film &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, playing himself as a talk show panel member. Page&#x27;s achievements came despite an undiagnosed case of ADD, the effects of which he recounts in a chapter in &quot;Positively ADD&quot;.

Clarence Page wrote an editorial piece about &quot;Richie&quot; Daley and his achievements as mayor of Chicago.

==Personal life==
Page was married to and later divorced from Leanita McClain, a &quot;Tribune&quot; columnist who also focused on race. In 1987 Page married Lisa Johnson with whom he has one son, Grady Jonathan.

==Honors and awards==
Page has received &quot;honoris causa&quot; doctorates from Columbia College Chicago, Lake Forest College, and Nazareth College in Rochester, New York.

<text>Ó Seachnasaigh, O&#x27;Shaughnessy, collectively Uí Sheachnasaigh, clan name Cinél nAedha na hEchtghe, is a family surname of Irish origin. The name is found primarily in County Galway and County Limerick. Their name derives from Seachnasach mac Donnchadh, a 10th-century member of the Uí Fiachrach Aidhne, which the Ó Seachnasaigh were the senior clan of. The town of Gort, Ireland, was the main residence of the family since at least the time of their ancestor, King Guaire Aidne mac Colmáin.

==Naming conventions==

==History==

Up until the late 17th century the Ó Seachnasaighs held the sub-district of Uí Fiachrach Aidhne known as Cenél Áeda na hEchtge (modern Irish, Cinéal nAedha na hEchtghe), meaning &quot;kindred of Aedh of the Slieve Aughty&quot;, which was also their clan name. Cinéal nAedha na hEchtghe / Kinelea consisted roughly of the civil parishes of Beagh, Kilmacduagh and Kiltartan and also parts of the civil parishes of Kibeacanty and Kilthomas. Their closest related kinsmen were the Ó Cathail / O Cahill clan, originally chiefs of eastern Kinelea, and the other clans of Uí Fhiachrach Aidhne the most prominent of which were the Ó hEidhin / O Hynes, Ó Cléirigh / O Cleary and Mac Giolla Cheallaigh / Kilkelly septs. Up until the mid-17th century, the O&#x27;Hynes clan were still styled lords of Uí Fhiachrach Aidhne even though the Ó Seachnasaighs had become more powerful than their kinsmen during this century. In the 1690s, Captain Roger O&#x27;Shaughnessy had his lands confiscated for supporting the Jacobite cause against William of Orange, with the lands going to Sir Thomas Prendergast, 1st Baronet. A legal battle raged on into the first half of the 18th century between the Ó Seachnasaigh and the Prendergasts, the family who were granted the lands, with the Ó Seachnasaigh eventually losing the case. The senior line of the Ó Seachnasaighs may have died out in the 1900s.

O&#x27;Shaughnessy castles include Gort Castle, Fiddaun Castle, Ardamullivan Castle, Newtown Castle, Derryowen, which is just inside the County Clare border, Ballymulfaig, and a castle on one of the islands in Lough Cutra. According to a list naming the castles of County Galway and their owners, drawn up in 1574 by the English administration in Ireland, Islandmore Castle (now Thoor Ballylee) was listed as being owned by a John O&#x27;Shaughnessy.

The last &quot;de facto&quot; Ó Seachnasaigh lord of Kinelea died at Gort after returning home from the Battle of Aughrim on 12 July 1691. Thousands of bearers of the name still survive both in their homeland and further abroad.

<doc id="1014587" wikidata="Q6421043" url="?curid=1014587" title="Klingon High Council">
<text>In the fictional &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe the Klingon High Council (in Klingon tlhIngan yejquv) is the supreme ruling body of the Klingon Empire. The council meets at the Great Hall of the First City of the Klingon Empire on the planet Qo&#x27;noS (also known as Kronos in Federation standard).

One of the writers responsible for Klingon background was Ronald D. Moore, who wrote famous Klingon episodes such as &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;, where the Klingon High Council is first depicted in Star Trek. Later episodes and content in the franchise showed or referenced the High Council.

The sets for the High Council building, called The Great Hall, was designed by Richard James; this and other settings won an Emmy award for best art direction.

== Production and Writing ==
Star Trek writer Ronald D. Moore had a reputation among the writers for having a talent for Klingon episodes, after he worked on the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;. He also worked on the Klingon romantic comedy episide &quot;House of Quark&quot;, which also featured the Klingon High Council.

An example of scenes with the High Council for example show Gowron in the Great Hall, where they meets. Showing, the High Council in hall posed a budget challenge for set design for the producer David Livingston, to produce the Great Hall set in &quot;House of Quark&quot;. This was solved by only making half of the great hall, and then by coordinating with the Director; the set would be redressed between shots to show the other half of the hall. The Klingon Great Hall was designed by Richard James for &quot;Sins of Father&quot;; the Great Hall and others sets won an Emmy.

The exterior of the hall was a painting by Syd Dutton of Illusion Arts.

One of the major episodes involving the High Council, was &quot;Redemption&quot;. Written by Ronald D. Moore, it aired as a cliffhanger with two parts in between seasons four and five of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. The story involved control of the Klingon High Council and involved many characters such as Worf, Gowron, Picard, the Duras sisters, and involving Starfleet and the Romulans as well.

==Form==
The High Council is presided over by the Chancellor, and is composed of a loosely faction-based, informal cabinet. Prominent members are generally leaders of one of the various Houses of the Empire – most of the seats are hereditary and some are conferred on distinguished figures, as with the House of Lords, the exact number of council members is not known. The Chancellor sits in an elevated chair at the front of the room, and the other council members surround him in a semicircle. A large Klingon insignia hangs on the wall at the front of the room, which is located behind the council members.

The council directs the political, diplomatic, military and internal matters of state. The Chancellor is empowered to enter into treaties on behalf of the council and the people, and has general executive power, although he is considered a primus inter pares subordinate to the Emperor. They also provide overall strategic direction on military matters, but in practice tactical and logistical matters are left to the battlefield commanders.

The council is also the final Court of Appeal, deciding matters pertaining to the various Klingon Houses. One example would be granting dispensation to allow a woman to rule over a house if her husband died in unusual circumstances and they had no sons (DS9&#x27;s &quot;The House of Quark&quot;). If one of the Houses falls and another makes a claim to the lands and property of the House, the council will judge the validity of the claim.

The council acts as all three branches of government - executive, legislative and judicial. For crimes committed against the Empire, the council can judge the guilt of an individual Klingon and his entire family. If the Klingon is found guilty of a crime, he and his entire family will suffer the consequences of the crime. For example, treason causes the family to lose their honor for seven generations.

It appears that the members of the council serve at the pleasure of the Chancellor. This is the reason that Worf&#x27;s brother Kurn was granted a seat on the council after the 2367 civil war, and was later taken from Kurn when Worf refused Gowron&#x27;s orders to turn against the Federation in 2372.

The Chancellor has, at various times, been informally referred to as &quot;leader&quot; of the High Council (TNG&#x27;s &quot;Unification I&quot;). Formally, however, the role also carries the title of &quot;Klingon supreme commander&quot; (TNG&#x27;s &quot;Reunion&quot;), which presumably means commander-in-chief of the military.

The means of choosing the Chancellor vary. One way would be challenging the Chancellor to a fight to the death. If the challenger was victorious, the old Chancellor would be dead, and the challenger would usually take the role of Chancellor for himself, or in rare cases bestow the role to another. If a Chancellor died of natural causes or not as a result of direct combat, an Arbiter of Succession would be named. The Arbiter would designate the strongest challengers, who would then fight each other to the death for the office. There is one known time when a Chancellor named his own successor - shortly after the Praxis explosion Chancellor Gorkon named his daughter Azetbur as Chancellor in the event of his death.

==History==
For at least 300 years prior to the events of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the Klingon Empire had been ruled by the High Council. The various High Councils during this time had to deal with monumental events in the history of the Klingon race and the galaxy at large, such as first contact with the humans, years of armed conflict with the Federation, the explosion of Praxis, détente and peace with the Federation, a civil war over the succession crisis, a war of aggression against Cardassia, renewed conflict with the Federation, a restoration of their alliance with the Federation, and the galaxy-wide Dominion War.

===The Emperor===
Prior to the mid-21st century, an Emperor presided over the Klingon Empire. Whether the High Council existed or not is open to debate; as is what role, if any, the High Council played. The Klingon-language translation of &quot;Hamlet&quot; suggests that the Emperor is &quot;First Among Equals&quot; in Klingon politics - but this may not be the generally accepted view in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. From about the mid 21st century to 2369, there was no Emperor.

In 2369, Kahless the Unforgettable apparently reappeared on the planet Boreth; upon which the original Kahless said he would one day return. It was later revealed that the monks living there had created a clone of Kahless because they felt Klingon society was on the decline, and that only Kahless could bring them back to their former glory. Though the deception was soon revealed, Worf felt that the clone could still play a valuable role in Klingon society. Worf managed to convince Gowron to accept Kahless as Emperor. Rather than serve as an absolute monarch, as previous emperors had done, the Emperor would be a spiritual figurehead of national identity, similar to the Japanese Emperor, while the actual power would still rest with the Chancellor and the High Council. The Klingon people were told not that this new Kahless was a clone, but that he was an heir to the original Kahless and the throne. Emperor Kahless II was installed soon afterwards.

===Known Chancellors of the High Council===
* Chancellor Mow&#x27;ga (2nd Empire; approximate Earth dates not known)
* Chancellor M&#x27;Rek (c. 2154)
* Chancellor L&#x27;Rell (2257-?)
* Chancellor Gorkon (?–2293) - Began the peace process with the Federation after the explosion of Praxis. Assassinated by Federation and Klingon officials opposed to the peace process. (Gorkon is the Chancellor at the start of &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;.)
* Chancellor Azetbur (2293–?) - The daughter of Gorkon, named Chancellor after Gorkon&#x27;s assassination. She presided over the uncovering of the conspiracy against peace and the murder of her father, finally leading to détente with the Federation. Her appointment as Chancellor was almost unheard of in Klingon culture, because while there was largely no gender discrimination in the Klingon military, females were traditionally barred from serving on the High Council, let alone becoming Chancellor.
* Chancellor K&#x27;mpec (?–2367) - The longest serving Chancellor, who enlisted the Federation to oversee a rightful succession after he was poisoned by a rival.
* Chancellor Gowron (2367–2375) - His rise to power occurred during a civil war with the Romulan-backed Duras house. He presided over the bulk of the Dominion War, having launched an aggressive invasion of Cardassian space, believing Cardassia&#x27;s new civilian government was infiltrated by Changeling spies. He withdrew from the Khitomer Accords and briefly ignited war with the Federation who came to Cardassia&#x27;s defense, having known there were no Changelings in the Detapa Council. He restored the Accords to bolster the war effort against the Dominion, but his political opportunism quickly took hold and impeded the war effort. Killed in a duel with Worf, who proclaimed Martok the new Chancellor.
* Chancellor Martok (beginning 2375)

<text>Marktrock is a music festival held each year around 15 August, in the heart of the university town of Leuven, Belgium. There is also a smaller Marktrock festival in Poperinge, which is held on the last Saturday of August.

The name Marktrock comes from the Dutch word , meaning market, and it is held on 2 squares (4 until 24th edition) in the historical city center of Leuven: &quot;Oude Markt&quot; and &quot;Ladeuzeplein&quot;. Until the 24th edition (2006), the three-day festival always had 15 August Assumption Day as its last day.

In 2004, the 22nd edition of the Marktrock festival was held in Leuven and it has grown into one of Europe&#x27;s biggest urban music festivals with over 350,000 visitors each year.

On 5 February 2007, the Marktrock VZW organization announced the end of the festival. The main reasons behind the decision were the raising price of quality artists and groups, the low capacity of the main stage on the Oude Markt, the new and expensive legal regulations each year, the financial risk of open-air festivals, and the organization refused to raise entry tickets for the Oude Markt stage again. The rain during the 2006 edition certainly didn&#x27;t help either. Over the 24-year history of the original Marktrock, more than 1,400 artists performed at Marktrock, more than 5 million people visited the festival, and it launched several Belgian artists.

In March 2007, Marktrock came under new management, which revived the festival and redesigned the 2007 edition. The free stages disappeared, replaced by two paying stages: the Oude Markt focused on local and upcoming bands, while the larger Ladeuzeplein featured established and international artists. This new set-up met with significant criticism and attendance was low.

For the 2008 edition, the festival was once again revamped, bringing back the various free stages throughout the city, leaving only the Oude Markt with an entry fee. The festival still struggled to draw the crowds it used to draw.

The 2009 festival changed its approach once more, ditching both the entry fee and international acts. It secured additional funding from the city of Leuven on the condition that the festival would focus on local talent. Despite a line-up of mostly obscure bands, this edition drew an estimated 95,000 visitors, causing minor organisational problems as visitors were turned back from venues that were filled to capacity.

<text>Cannabis sativa is an annual herbaceous flowering plant. The species was first classified by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. The specific epithet &quot;sativa&quot; means &#x27;cultivated&#x27;. Indigenous to Eastern Asia, the plant is now of cosmopolitan distribution due to widespread cultivation. It has been cultivated throughout recorded history and used as a source of industrial fiber, seed oil, food, and medicine. It is also used as a recreational drug and for religious and spiritual purposes.

==Description==

The flowers of &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; plants are most often either male or female, but, only plants displaying female pistils can be or turn hermaphrodite. Males can never become hermaphrodites. It is a short-day flowering plant, with staminate (male) plants usually taller and less robust than pistillate (female or male) plants. The flowers of the female plant are arranged in racemes and can produce hundreds of seeds. Male plants shed their pollen and die several weeks prior to seed ripening on the female plants. Under typical conditions with a light period of 12 to 14 hours, both sexes are produced in equal numbers because of heritable X and Y chromosomes. Although genetic factors dispose a plant to become male or female, environmental factors including the diurnal light cycle can alter sexual expression. Naturally occurring monoecious plants, with both male and female parts, are either sterile or fertile; but artificially induced &quot;hermaphrodites&quot; can have fully functional reproductive organs. &quot;Feminized&quot; seed sold by many commercial seed suppliers are derived from artificially &quot;hermaphroditic&quot; females that lack the male gene, or by treating the plants with hormones or silver thiosulfate.

=== Chemical constituents ===


Although the main psychoactive constituent of &quot;Cannabis&quot; is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant is known to contain more than 500 compounds, among them at least 113 cannabinoids; however, most of these &quot;minor&quot; cannabinoids are only produced in trace amounts. Besides THC, another cannabinoid produced in high concentrations by some plants is cannabidiol (CBD), which is not psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effect of THC in the nervous system. Differences in the chemical composition of &quot;Cannabis&quot; varieties may produce different effects in humans. Synthetic THC, called dronabinol, does not contain cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), or other cannabinoids, which is one reason why its pharmacological effects may differ significantly from those of natural &quot;Cannabis&quot; preparations.

Beside cannabinoids, the chemical constituents of &quot;Cannabis&quot; include about 120 compounds responsible for its characteristic aroma. These are mainly volatile terpenes and sesquiterpenes.
* α-Pinene
* Myrcene
* Linalool
* Limonene
* Trans-β-ocimene
* α-Terpinolene
* Trans-caryophyllene
* α-Humulene, contributes to the characteristic aroma of &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot;
* Caryophyllene, with which some hashish detection dogs are trained

A 1980 study identifying constituents of &quot;C. sativa&quot; established 19 major chemical families (number of chemicals within group):
* (18)
* (6)
* (12)
* (18)
* (55)
* (11)
* (14)
* (20)
* (46)

* (18)
* (14)
* (111)
* (2)
* (7)
* (9)
* (32)
* (98)
* (1)

Cannabis also produces numerous volatile sulfur compounds that contribute to the plant&#x27;s skunk-like aroma, with Prenylthiol (3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol) identified as the primary odorant. These compounds are found in much lower concentrations than the major terpenes and sesquiterpenes. However, they contribute significantly to the pungent aroma of cannabis due to their low odor thresholds as often seen with thiols or other sulfur-containing compounds.

A number of specific aromatic compounds have been implicated in variety-specific aromas. These include another class of volatile sulfur compounds, referred to as tropical volatile sulfur compounds, that include 3-mercaptohexanol, 3-mercaptohexyl acetate, and 3-mercaptohexyl butyrate. These compounds possess powerful and distinctive fruity, tropical, and citrus aromas in low concentrations such as those found in certain cannabis varieties. These compounds are also important in the citrus and tropical flavors of hops, beer, wine, and tropical fruits.

In addition to volatile sulfur compounds, the heterocyclic compounds indole and skatole (3-Methyl-1&quot;H&quot;-indole) contribute to the chemical or savory aromas of certain varieties. Skatole in particular was identified as a key contributor to this scent. This compound is found in mammalian feces and is used in the perfuming industry. It possesses a complex aroma that is highly dependent on concentration.

==Cultivation==
A &quot;Cannabis&quot; plant in the vegetative growth phase of its life requires more than 16–18 hours of light per day to stay vegetative. Flowering usually occurs when darkness equals at least 12 hours per day. The flowering cycle can last anywhere between seven and fifteen weeks, depending on the strain and environmental conditions. When the production of psychoactive cannabinoids is sought, female plants are grown separately from male plants to induce parthenocarpy in the female plant&#x27;s fruits (popularly called &quot;sin semilla&quot; which is Spanish for &quot;without seed&quot; ) and increase the production of cannabinoid-rich resin.

In soil, the optimum pH for the plant is 6.3 to 6.8. In hydroponic growing, the nutrient solution is best at 5.2 to 5.8, making &quot;Cannabis&quot; well-suited to hydroponics because this pH range is hostile to most bacteria and fungi.

Tissue culture multiplication has become important in producing medically important clones, while seed production remains the generally preferred means of multiplication. Sativa plants have narrow leaves and grow best in warm environments. They do, however, take longer to flower than their Indica counterparts, and they grow taller than the Indica cannabis strains as well.

=== Cultivars ===
Broadly, there are three main cultivar groups of cannabis that are cultivated today:
* Cultivars primarily cultivated for their fibre, characterized by long stems and little branching.
* Cultivars grown for seed which can be eaten entirely raw or from which hemp oil is extracted.
* Cultivars grown for medicinal or recreational purposes, characterized by extensive branching to maximize the number of flowers.
A nominal if not legal distinction is often made between industrial hemp, with concentrations of psychoactive compounds far too low to be useful for that purpose, and marijuana.

== Uses ==
&quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; seeds are chiefly used to make hempseed oil which can be used for cooking, lamps, lacquers, or paints. They can also be used as caged-bird feed, as they provide a source of nutrients for most animals. The flowers and fruits (and to a lesser extent the leaves, stems, and seeds) contain psychoactive chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are consumed for recreational, medicinal, and spiritual purposes. When so used, preparations of flowers and fruits (called marijuana) and leaves and preparations derived from resinous extract (e.g., hashish) are consumed by smoking, vaporising, and oral ingestion. Historically, tinctures, teas, and ointments have also been common preparations. In traditional medicine of India in particular &quot;cannabis sativa&quot; has been used as hallucinogenic, hypnotic, sedative, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory agent. Terpenes have gained public awareness through the growth and education of medical and recreational cannabis. Organizations and companies operating in cannabis markets have pushed education and marketing of terpenes in their products as a way to differentiate taste and effects of cannabis. The entourage effect, which describes the synergy of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other plant compounds, has also helped further awareness and demand for terpenes in cannabis products.

<text>Eden is a 1958 social science fiction novel by Polish writer Stanisław Lem. It was first published in 1958 in issues 211-271 of the newspaper &quot;Trybuna Robotnicza&quot;. The first book edition was in 1959. It was first published in English in 1989 ().

==Plot==
A starship crew—Captain (in the original, Coordinator), Doctor, Engineer, Chemist, Physicist and Cyberneticist (robotics expert)—crash land on an alien world they call Eden. After escaping their wrecked ship they set out to explore the planet, first traveling through an unsettling wilderness and coming upon an abandoned automated factory. There they find a constant cycle of materials being produced and then destroyed and recycled. Perplexed, they return to their ship. At the crash site they find a local sentient alien has entered their vessel. They name these large creatures, with small torsos retractable into their large bodies, doublers (a translation of Lem&#x27;s neologism &quot;dubelt&quot;, to mean &quot;double-bodied&quot;).

The next day the expedition begins to come into contact with the local civilization, and their strange, wheel-like vehicles. Eventually they come into conflict with a vehicle&#x27;s pilot, who is a doubler. Killing the pilot and fleeing in his vehicle, they return to the ship and prepare defenses. After an attack never comes, they assemble their jeep and half the team sets out to explore further, the other half remaining behind to repair the ship.

The jeep team eventually discovers structures resembling graves and hundreds of preserved skeletons, and adjacent to it, a settlement. Two expedition members exploring the settlement become caught in a stampede of doublers, who seem totally indifferent to the presence of the alien expedition. One doubler however, comes to the jeep and refuses to return to the settlement, and is brought back to the ship. While the expedition explored the settlement, a large group of doubler vehicles had reconnoitered the crash site and then fled.

After a while the crew learns that the local civilization is planning to act against them. Shortly thereafter the area around the ship is bombarded for several hours, with all hits falling into a circular ditch made earlier. It turns out they were bombarded with &quot;micromechanical devices&quot;, from which a wall of glass begins to grow and eventually assembles into a dome, an attempt to isolate the ship.

The doubler that has joined the group proves to be uncommunicative, leading some of the crew to suggest that it has some sort of intellectual disability. The crew also begins to postulate that the &quot;naked&quot; doublers they have seen are the victims of genocide. Choosing to explore further, the crew activates &quot;Defender&quot;, a large tank which they have managed to repair. Blasting through the glass dome they travel far southwest, observing from a distance, for the first time, everyday doubler life.

Returning to the ship in the night, the crew encounters a group of doublers being gassed to death, and act in self defense with their antimatter weapons, killing an indeterminate number of both &quot;naked&quot; and &quot;soldier&quot; doublers. When the Defender team returns to the ship, they find that most of the glass wall has repaired itself, and blast another hole. Returning to the ship until the radioactivity dies down, the expedition plans its next move. In the middle of the meeting a dressed doubler suddenly enters, and the crew makes contact, discovering the doubler to have knowledge of astronomy.

The first contact however, is soon turned into a bitter victory, as the crew learns that this doubler has unwittingly exposed himself to radiation by entering the hole made by Defender. Informing the doubler of his impending death, both parties struggle to learn as much as they can. Through a developed computer translator, the crew and the doubler can speak to one another and begin to gain an understanding of the other&#x27;s species.

An indistinct image emerges of doublers&#x27; Orwellian information-controlled civilization that is almost self-regulating, with a special kind of system of government—one that officially does not exist and is thus impossible to destroy. The society is controlled through a fictitious advanced branch of information science Lem dubs &quot;procrustics&quot;, based on the control and stratification of information flows within the society. It is used for molding groups within a society and ultimately a society as a whole to behave as designed by secret hidden rulers. One example described in the novel is the above-mentioned settlement, kind of a &quot;concentration camp&quot; without any guards, designed so that the prisoners stay inside apparently of their own &quot;free&quot; will.

Although the doublers know almost nothing of nuclear science, they once conducted a massive genetic experiment to enhance the species. This attempt failed miserably, resulting in deformed doublers who, if they survive, are often driven to the fringes of society. Much like the government, the very existence of this experiment, and the factories created for it, are denied, and anyone with the knowledge of them is eliminated. The doubler explains that the information disseminated to the higher echelons of doubler society was that humans, having been subjected to the effects of cosmic rays throughout their space journey, were mutant monsters that were being quarantined, but he had seen it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and chose to pursue it, a choice the humans greatly empathize with.

Finally the ship is repaired and the crew is ready to leave Eden. The astronomer doubler, although recovering fully from his radiation exposure, decides to stay behind, and as the starship takes off, much to the crew&#x27;s sadness, the two doublers stand by the ship&#x27;s exhaust, choosing to die rather than return to their oppressive society.

The planet is seen from the distance once again, a beautiful violet sphere, whose beauty, they now recall, was the very reason they crashed while attempting too close a fly-by and hitting the atmosphere by mistake. It was because of its beauty that they called it, when first seeing it, Eden.

==Literary criticism==

Lem&#x27;s own opinion about the book was unflattering. He wrote &quot;From today&#x27;s perspective Eden is neutral in my eyes. It is so-so. From the point of view of literature it is a rather unsuccessful book; its characters tend to be schematic and the pictured universe is a bit &quot;flat&quot; and one-dimensional.&quot;

Marek Oramus in his essay &quot;Doktryna nieingerencji&quot; (&quot;Doctrine of Noninterfence&quot;) writes that the novel marks the beginning of the full maturity of Lem as a writer. He also notes that, although the technology in the novel overall is rather archaic from today&#x27;s point of view, the novel describes something that is called nanotechnology today. He also remarks that &quot;Eden&quot; is the first of Lem&#x27;s stories about failed &quot;first contact&quot;. Lem&#x27;s later writings of this type are much more skeptical, the best known case being &quot;Solaris&quot;.

==Background==
The book was written in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic while under a Soviet-style regime, which in all Eastern Bloc countries had a system of all-pervasive censorship and information control and stratification.

<doc id="1014594" wikidata="Q3661835" url="?curid=1014594" title="Parkland Walk">
<text>The Parkland Walk is a linear green pedestrian and cycle route in London, which follows the course of the railway line that used to run between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace, through Stroud Green, Crouch End, Highgate and Muswell Hill. It is often mistakenly described as 4.5 miles long, but even taking in the gap between the two sections it still only totals 3.1 miles (5.0 km). The route follows the bridges and cuttings of the line, but avoids the closed surface section of Highgate station and its adjoining tunnels, which are closed to walkers for safety reasons. The walk is almost all in Haringey, but a short stretch between Crouch Hill and Crouch End Hill is in Islington and this section incorporates Crouch Hill Park.

The walk is a local nature reserve and a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation. It was declared a local nature reserve in 1990 and is London&#x27;s longest such reserve. Between Finsbury Park and Highgate, the path forms part of the Capital Ring strategic walking route.

==History==
===Railway line===
The route of the path between Finsbury Park and Highgate was constructed originally by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway in the 1860s, as part of its railway line from Finsbury Park to Edgware. Before the line was opened on 22 August 1867, it was purchased by the larger Great Northern Railway (GNR). Branch lines from Finchley to High Barnet and from Highgate to Alexandra Palace opened in 1872 and 1873. The GNR became part of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923.

Plans were published by London Underground in the 1930s for the incorporation of these lines into the Northern line (the Northern Heights Plan), but the onset of World War II stopped the work at an advanced stage. After the war, the development plan was abandoned but passenger trains continued to run on this line until 3 July 1954, when British Railways (the successor to the LNER) ended such services permanently. The Alexandra Palace branch closed completely in 1957, but the link from Finsbury Park to Highgate and East Finchley remained open to freight traffic until 1964. Even after freight traffic had ceased, the line continued to be used to transfer empty tube stock between lines; this ceased in 1970, because of the poor condition of some of the intermediate bridges, and the track was lifted in 1972.

===Creation of the walk===
After the track was lifted, most of the platforms and station buildings were demolished. The sections of the line from Finsbury Park to Highgate and from Highgate to Alexandra Palace, excluding the intermediate section through the tunnels and station at Highgate, were converted into the Parkland Walk. This was officially opened in 1984, following extensive re-surfacing and improvements to access. In the late 1980s, the park was threatened by a plan to build a road along its route but the plan was withdrawn following local opposition which was co-ordinated by &quot;The Friends of the Parkland Walk&quot;.

The walk was declared a local nature reserve in 1990.

==Route description==

===Finsbury Park to Crouch Hill===
The route starts near to Finsbury Park station, at the western side of the East Coast Main Line, beside a foot overbridge that gives access from the eastern end of Oxford Road to Finsbury Park itself. The route rises on an embankment overlooking the back gardens of the Victorian suburban houses. The route then bridges Upper Tollington Park.

The next bridge takes the walk over Stapleton Hall Road, at a point where the Gospel Oak to Barking railway line also passes beneath the road. Stroud Green station once stood at this point, with its platforms cantilevered out over the sides of the bridge over Stapleton Hall Road. The station master&#x27;s house still survives at road level, but there are no traces of the track- or road-side station buildings, which were destroyed in a fire in 1967.

After crossing Mount Pleasant Villas on an overbridge, the embankment gives way to a cutting as the land rises north-westwards. The route continues beneath overbridges carrying Mount View Road and Crouch Hill.

===Crouch Hill to Crouch End Hill===
Immediately after passing under Crouch Hill to the left, a large block house can be seen; this was originally built to house switchgear for the Northern Heights project, as part of the plans to incorporate the line into the tube system. This has been redeveloped by adding extensions, cantilevered off the north and west sides of the existing building, and extending a short distance over the Parkland Walk. Now known as &quot;The Cape&quot;, it is managed directly by Islington Council and houses a community energy centre, a youth centre, a new ecology centre and Ashmount School&#x27;s after-school club. There is a public cafe in the building to which there is direct access from the Parkland Walk.

Passing the blockhouse, the walk enters Crouch Hill Park which spreads to the south of the old railway line. The new park has a triangular form covering an area of , which is bounded by the walkway to the north and housing on the other sides; it is home to birds, invertebrates and bats, including some species locally uncommon or declining. It can be accessed from a number of access points on the Parkland Walk, from a public footpath called the Vicarage Path and from pedestrian entrances to the south and west of the park. A new building within the park contains Ashmount School, a community primary school, and Bowlers Community Nursery, which is a separate charity-run voluntary nursery.

Beyond the site of the new school building, and just before Crouch End station, is a footbridge across the Parkland Walk which crossed over the railway. It was retained after the line&#x27;s closure and now connects Haslemere Road in Haringey to Crouch Hill Park in Islington.

At this point, the still extant but partly overgrown platforms of Crouch End station remain. The route passes under the site of the former station building, and the road bridge over the cutting carrying Crouch End Hill, at the far end of the platforms.

===Crouch End Hill to Highgate tunnels===
Beyond this, the cutting opens out on the northern side as the route skirts a hill, parallel to Hornsey Lane where some apartment blocks have been built. The route bridges Stanhope Road on a footbridge replacing the original structure. The route continues on an embankment to a brick-built bridge over Northwood Road, beneath which traffic can flow in only one direction at a time. The surrounding ground rises rapidly and the route becomes a cutting at the end of which the portals of the southern pair of Highgate tunnels come into view. Vestiges of line-side electrical equipment for the planned 1930s electrification of the line and part of the structure of the old Highgate station are visible through the tunnels. The tunnels are closed to pedestrian access; consequently, the main route ends here with an exit onto Holmesdale Road. Should the walker choose to proceed further, they can travel uphill along Holmesdale Road which soon joins Archway Road; continuing along Archway Road, travelling north past Highgate station, leads to the junction between Archway Road and Muswell Hill Road.

===Cranley Gardens to Alexandra Palace===
The route between the northern end of the Highgate Tunnels and the Northern Line depot at Wellington Junction is used by trains entering the depot; the rest of the cutting around Highgate Wood from Wellington Junction to Cranley Gardens station is outside the wood&#x27;s fence. It is not officially part of Parkland Walk and so is allowed to stay overgrown.

A further shorter section of the walk begins along Muswell Hill Road, just beyond Cranley Gardens, where the road overbridge crosses the old line. At the site of the former Cranley Gardens railway station the old trackbed has been replaced with a school and housing. The walk continues opposite, via steps down to the trackbed, towards Alexandra Palace, skirting the side of Muswell Hill. The span of the seventeen-arch viaduct over St James&#x27;s Lane gives a view eastwards and southwards over London. The route ends with a pedestrian tunnel, replacing the former overbridge, which passes under the road Muswell Hill itself. At this point, Muswell Hill primary school has been built on the trackbed and the suburb&#x27;s former railway station.

The pedestrian route by-passes the primary school and leads into Alexandra Park, where further remains of the rail route can be seen. The former Alexandra Palace station building still exists and is used for community purposes.

==Wildlife==

===Flora===

No trees were permitted to grow close to the track when the railway was operational. The range of trees found today has grown up in the last fifty years. Most arrived naturally (oak, ash, birch, hawthorn, cherry, apple, holly, rowan, sycamore and yew), but a few additional species have been planted (field maple, hazel, black Italian poplar and white poplar).

More than three hundred species of wild flowers have been recorded on the Parkland Walk. They range from commonplace to exotic. Species sighted include Michaelmas daisies, goldenrods, buddleia and Guernsey fleabane.

===Fauna===
The great variety of plant life sustains a wide range of animals. Twenty two species of butterfly have been recorded. Hedgehogs benefit from the proximity of adjacent homes and occasional feedings from homeowners. Foxes are plentiful and muntjac (a small species of deer) are seen occasionally. A colony of slowworms thrive along the grassy embankment. More than sixty species of bird have been seen along the walk and many breed here. Parkland Walk is known to be an important site for bats in the London context, providing important foraging habitat and an excellent dark commuting route. A significant bat roost is known to exist in the vicinity.
==Arts &amp; culture==
===Spriggan sculpture and Stephen King===

Along the walk just before the disused platforms at Crouch End, a man-sized green spriggan sculpture by Marilyn Collins has been placed in one of the alcoves of the wall at the footbridge before the former Crouch End station.

According to a local urban legend, a ghostly &#x27;goat-man&#x27; haunted the walk in the 1970s and 1980s. Local children playing out in the evenings would &#x27;dare&#x27; each other to walk the Parkland Walk from the Crouch End Hill bridge to the Crouch Hill bridge in the darkness. It has been suggested that the sculpture, and the Parkland Walk generally, provided the inspiration for Stephen King&#x27;s short story &quot;Crouch End&quot;. However, as the story was first published in 1980 and the sculpture not erected until 1993, there can be no connection between the Spriggan and the story. It is possible that the walk may have inspired King, as he stayed with friend and Crouch End resident Peter Straub during the 1970s. No definite link between the Parkland Walk and the story has ever been proven.

=== Graffiti ===
London newspaper Ham &amp; High reports that &quot;Parkland Walk has a long history as a &#x27;spot&#x27; where well known graffiti artists decorate tunnels&quot;, seen as a positive by some local residents and the Friends of Parkland Walk.

===Chewing gum art trail===
In 2020, artist Ben Wilson was invited to produce a series of miniature artworks on blobs of chewing gum along the Walk. Council funding was initially mooted for the project, but when this fell through Wilson went ahead anyway. Subjects depicted on the works include a rescue dog, a jogger and a ghost station from the Walk&#x27;s original railway.

== Crouch Hill Park project ==
The Islington section of the Parkland Walk formed a part of the Crouch Hill Park project, which provided improved accommodation for several institutions and reinstated an area of previously derelict parkland to the south of the Parkland Walk as a public park and nature reserve. The project included the demolition of the existing building of the Bowlers Nursery and the Crouch Hill Recreation Centre, and their replacement with new building containing the relocated Ashmount School, a community primary school, and a new Bowlers Nursery. It also involved the rebuilding a blockhouse originally built to house switching gear for the never completed Northern Heights plan, and subsequently used to house a youth project. The whole project was executed at a total cost of £13m to Islington Council.

The project was opposed by the Friends of the Parkland Walk, the Ashmount Site Action Group the Highgate Society and the 20th Century Society all of whom favoured retention of the original school building on the original site off Hornsey Lane. It was also opposed by the Islington Green Party. The project was supported by both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, by the Ashmount School governors, by Ashmount school parents and by Bowlers Nursery. When the council carried out a consultation amongst residents, two thirds of the respondents were in favour of the scheme. The project was also closely scrutinised by the Mayor of London whose consent was required as the land is specially protected Metropolitan Open Land and further examined by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government who could have chosen to call the project in and hold a public inquiry but despite requests to do so, did not. Objections to the project were made both to Islington, to the Mayor of London and the Secretary of State. An application for judicial review was threatened, but in the event did not materialise.

Further, a formal complaint against the council for proceeding with the project was made to the Local Government Ombudsman by the &quot;Ashmount Site Action Group&quot; (ASAG) but was not upheld. In the council election of 2010 all three councillors elected for the local ward, in Islington, Hillrise, (two Liberal Democrat, one Labour) had publicly declared their support for the scheme. The project was financed by Islington Council under a number of budget headings recognising that the project was contributing to the re accommodation of several different bodies. It also received a special grant due to its &quot;low carbon&quot; status. In particular it was expected that a significant part of the cost of reproviding Ashmount School would be raised by realising the value of the old school site on Hornsey Lane. However, when Islington Council, relying on the recommendations of a planning inspector, applied to the Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove for permission to cease to use the old site for a school, permission was refused, and the site was requisitioned, without compensation to Islington Council, for use by a Free School.

In order to conform with the rules for building on Metropolitan Open Land, the footprint of the new school building did not exceed that of the demolished buildings. The design includes a brown roof, climbing plants on walls, and areas of planted grassland, wild flowers and woodland. Bowlers Nursery moved into the new building in August 2012 and Ashmount School moved to the site in January 2013. Building operations at the Cape were finally completed in February 2013, two years and four months after the contract to carry out the work was signed by Islington Council. The Crouch Hill Project received a 2012 BREEAM award. Factors behind this award include the use of rain water harvesting, natural ventilation systems to keep the school building cool in summer and the setting up of an &quot;energy centre&quot; in the blockhouse which by means of combined heat and power provides district heating both for the whole site and for social housing near the site, as well as generating electricity. The main fuel used is gas, but there is also provision for the use of biomass in the form of woodchips. The architects were Penoyre &amp; Prasad and the contractors were Willmott Dixon.

<text>Honoré-Beaugrand station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and is the eastern terminus of the Green Line. It is located in the district of Tétreaultville. The station opened on June 6, 1976, replacing Frontenac station as the terminus.

== Overview ==
Designed by Papineau, Gérin-Lajoie, Le Blanc, Edwards, it is a normal side platform station built in open cut. A vast mezzanine at the eastern end of the station provides access to three exits, two of which are surrounded by bus loops serving a large number of bus routes from the east end of the island. The stairs from the mezzanine to the platforms are surmounted by ceramic murals, one the reverse of the other, by Jean-Paul Mousseau.

Entrances/exits are at 7950 and 7955, rue Sherbrooke and 4755, rue Honoré-Beaugrand.

The station is equipped with the MétroVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the time till the next train.

In 2016, work began on a $20m renovation project at the station, including waterproofing, replacement of paving &amp; lighting and the installation of three elevators. In December 2018, the station became the 14th accessible Metro station on the network.

==Origin of the name==
Honoré-Beaugrand was named after the adjoining rue Honoré-Beaugrand, which was in turn named after Honoré Beaugrand, who served as mayor of Montreal from 1885 to 1887. He founded the Montreal newspaper &quot;La Patrie&quot; in 1879. Soon after, he left the city to travel and write.

== Terminus Honoré-Beaugrand ==
There is a bus terminus on both sides of Sherbrooke Street.

<text>There are several subgenres of reggae music including various predecessors to the form.

==Pre-reggae styles==
===Mento===
Reggae grew out of earlier musical styles such as mento, ska and rocksteady. Mento is a Jamaican folk music based on traditions brought to Jamaica by West African slaves which blended with later influences such as the quadrille. Mento reached its peak of popularity in the 1950s with the success of acts such as Louise Bennett, Count Lasher, Lord Flea, Laurel Aitken, and Harry Belafonte, but is sometimes confused with calypso, a similar style from Trinidad.

===Ska===
Ska began in the 1950s, coinciding with Jamaica&#x27;s independence from Great Britain. By the 1950s, musicians began to absorb the influences R&amp;B and jazz from the United States, resulting in the development of ska. It incorporates elements of mento and calypso, as well as American Jazz and R&amp;B, which were popular on Jamaican radio. The style is characterized by chord chops on the offbeat, sometimes called &quot;upstrokes&quot;. The tempo is usually upbeat and often features horns, usually trumpets, saxophones, and trombones, as well as pianos and keyboards, bass, and drums. In the early-to-mid 1960s, ska became the most popular form of music in Jamaica and set the stage for rocksteady and reggae. Many of ska&#x27;s popular acts such as Desmond Dekker &amp; the Aces, Bob Marley and the Wailers, the Skatalites, Toots &amp; the Maytals, Byron Lee &amp; the Dragonaires, and the Melodians, later became associated with reggae.

===Rocksteady===
In 1966, many ska musicians began to favour slower rhythms and beats, and the form began to evolve into rocksteady. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as the Gaylads, Toots &amp; the Maytals, the Heptones and the Paragons.

==Early reggae==
The &quot;early reggae&quot; era can be traced as starting in roughly 1968. The influence of funk music from American record labels such as Stax began to permeate the music style of studio musicians and the slowing in tempo that occurred with the development of rocksteady had allowed musicians more space to experiment with different rhythmic patterns. One of the developments which separated early reggae from rocksteady was the &quot;bubble&quot; organ pattern, a percussive style of playing that showcased the eighth-note subdivision within the groove.

The guitar &quot;skanks&quot; on the second and fourth beat of the bar began to be replaced by a strumming pattern similar to mento and the so-called double chop that can be heard so audibly in the introduction of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Stir It Up&quot; was developed during this time. More emphasis was put on the groove of the music, and there was a growing trend of recording a &quot;version&quot; on the B-side of a single. The mass popularity of instrumental music in the ska and rocksteady eras continued in reggae, producing some of the most memorable recordings of the early reggae era. Cover versions of Motown, Stax and Atlantic Records soul songs remained popular in early reggae, often helping Jamaican artists gain a foothold in foreign markets such as the UK.

As a testament to its far reaching impact in other markets, this era and sound of reggae is sometimes referred to in retrospect as &quot;skinhead reggae&quot; because of its popularity among the working class skinhead subculture in the UK during the late 1960s and early 1970s. One Caribbean band based in London, The Pyramids, even released an entire album dedicated to the unruly English youth culture under the name Symarip which featured songs such as &quot;Skinhead Moonstomp&quot; and &quot;Skinhead Girl&quot;. Eventually the, often experimental, sounds of early reggae gave way to the more refined sound made popular by Bob Marley&#x27;s most famous recordings. Indeed, this era seems fittingly capped off by the 1973 release of &quot;Catch a Fire&quot;. Notable artists from this era include John Holt, Toots &amp; the Maytals and The Pioneers.

==Roots reggae==
Roots reggae usually refers to the most recognizable kind of reggae, popularized internationally by artists like Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, which dominated Jamaican recordings from around 1972 into the early 1980s. While there are distinct musical characteristics to this era of reggae music, the term &quot;roots&quot; often implies more the message of the music than specifically its musical style and is still often used today to refer either to a musical style/subgenre or to give context to an artists music that may, in fact, cover several subgenres of reggae. Roots reggae, in this descriptive sense, can be typified by lyrics grounded in the Rastafarian movement&#x27;s &quot;Back to Africa&quot; message, equation of colonialism and slavery with the Biblical captivity in Babylon, and, of course, the belief in one living God, Jah, manifested as Ethiopia&#x27;s Emperor Haile Selassie. Recurrent lyrical themes include poverty and resistance to economic and racial oppression as well as more poetic meditations on spiritual or topical themes.

Musically, the &quot;roots&quot; sound and era have a number of distinct features. Drummers developed more complex kick drum patterns based around the &quot;one drop&quot; of rocksteady and incorporated influences from Funk and R&amp;B. The guitar, piano and keyboard patterns in the music were refined from the creative explorations of the early reggae era into the patterns most recognizable as reggae throughout the world. Simple chord progressions were often used to create a meditative feeling to complement the lyrical content of the songs. This refining of rhythmic patterns and simplification of chord progressions brought the bass guitar entirely to the forefront, helping to make bass one of the most definitive features of reggae as a genre. Producer/engineers like King Tubby, Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and Prince Jammy (before he became a king) also played a large role in the development of the roots sound, with their heavy use of tape delay and reverb effects becoming one of the most recognizable features of the music. The roots sound can be best identified in the Jamaican recordings of the late 1970s by artists such as Burning Spear, Max Romeo, The Abyssinians, Culture and Israel Vibration.

==Rockers==
The term &quot;rockers&quot; refers to a particular sound of roots reggae, pioneered in the mid-1970s by Sly &amp; Robbie, and popular in the late 1970s. Rockers is best described as a somewhat more mechanical and aggressive style of playing reggae with a greater use of syncopated drum patterns.

==Lovers rock==

The lovers rock subgenre originated in South London in the mid-1970s. The lyrics are usually about love. It is similar, if not a continuation, to Rocksteady. Notable lovers rock artists include: Janet Kay, Kofi, Louisa Marks, and Tradition.

==Dub==
Dub is a genre of reggae that was pioneered in the early days by studio producers Lee &#x27;Scratch&#x27; Perry and King Tubby. It involves extensive remixing of recorded material, and particular emphasis is placed on the drum and bass line. The techniques used resulted in an even more visceral feel described by King Tubby as sounding &quot;jus’ like a volcano in yuh head.&quot; Augustus Pablo and Mikey Dread were two of the early notable proponents of this music style, which continues today.

==Rub-a-Dub==
&quot;Rub-a-Dub&quot; is the term for the style of reggae in a more specific era from the late 1970s to the mid 1980s, and ruled but not limited to one band, the Roots Radics. Its signature sound is a slow tempo and heavy bass line. Back then, it was considered &quot;Dancehall&quot; music.

==Steppa==
Steppers/Steppa in reggae is the typical 4-4 discobeat in essence. The UK styled steppers is the digital bassline style often with effects in the mix.

==Newer styles and spin-offs==
===Hip hop and rap===

Toasting is a style of talking over music, making heavy use of rhythmic phrasing and rhyme patterns, that was developed in the 1950s by Jamaican disc jockeys looking to add excitement to the mainly American R&amp;B records they played in outdoor venues, called &quot;lawns&quot;, and dancehalls. This style was developed by pioneers Count Machuki, King Stitt and Sir Lord Comic who took the current style of introducing and speaking over records played by sound systems and developed it into a unique style. As ska moved to rocksteady, this style of vocals gained a wider audience among Jamaican listeners. One of the earliest examples of this style is Sir Lord Comic&#x27;s 1966 recording, &quot;The Great Wuga Wuga&quot;. This style finally gained chart topping popularity in the late 1960s with deejays such as U-Roy and Dennis Alcapone scoring numerous hits. This style of speaking over records may have had a great impact on a young Jamaican DJ named Kool Herc, who had emigrated to New York City in the late 1960s where he began holding parties in the Bronx. It was Kool Herc&#x27;s parties and the scene that sprung up around them that is generally credited as birth of hip hop and rap. Mixing techniques developed later in dub music have also influenced hip hop.

===Dancehall===

The dancehall genre was developed in the late 1970s by pioneers such as Yellowman and Eek-A-Mouse. The style is characterized by a &quot;deejay&quot; singing and rapping over riddims and was originally developed in the sound system culture in the wake of the increased popularity of early pioneers like Big Youth. The style of these early deejays was developed into a more continual rhythmic pattern of rapping that contained much more melody than the rapping style being developed in America around this time. It is important to note that the rhythmic patterns dancehall deejays developed in their rapping are based around the phrasing and speech patterns of Jamaican patois. An important characteristic of dancehall was the role of the selectors (and later operators) on the sound systems, who would routinely use the volume control on their mixers to remix the riddim around the vocalists rhythmic patterns. Musicians took the rhythms created by this mixing technique and began incorporating them into the music they played and recorded, a style still often referred to today as the &quot;mix&quot;. An early example of this in recording would be Barrington Levy&#x27;s 1984 hit, &quot;Here I Come&quot;. &quot;Ragga&quot; (or &quot;raggamuffin&quot;) is usually used to refer to the type of dancehall music that emerged since the 1980s which is based almost entirely around these &quot;mix&quot; rhythms and contains almost no elements of what is traditionally perceived as reggae. In recording, ragga instrumentation primarily consists of synthesizers and drum machines. Sampling and MIDI sequencing is also often used in ragga production. A definitive example of &quot;ragga&quot; might be Beenie Man&#x27;s 1998 hit, &quot;Who Am I&quot;. Dancehall is a style and genre that was developed primarily by urban youth in Jamaica, as such its lyrical content is based in the lives of the people who made it and often contains lyrical content considered by many Jamaicans to be overly sexual or violent. In a word, dancehall might be described as &quot;raw&quot; and it has often been maligned in a similar way to gangsta rap despite the fact that many &quot;conscious&quot; artists continue to release dancehall music. In February 2009, dancehall with lyrical content &quot;deemed explicitly sexual and violent&quot; was banned from the airwaves by the Broadcasting Commission of Jamaica.

===Raggamuffin===

Raggamuffin, usually abbreviated as ragga, is a subgenre of reggae that is closely related to dancehall and dub. The term raggamuffin is an intentional misspelling of ragamuffin, and the term &quot;raggamuffin music&quot; describes the music of Jamaica&#x27;s &quot;ghetto youths&quot;. The instrumentation primarily consists of electronic music. Sampling often serves a prominent role as well. As ragga matured, an increasing number of dancehall artists began to appropriate stylistic elements of hip hop music, while ragga music, in turn, influenced more and more hip hop artists. Ragga is now mainly used as a synonym for dancehall reggae or for describing dancehall with a deejay chatting rather than deejaying or singing on top of the riddim.

===Reggaeton===

Reggaeton is a form of urban music that first became popular with Latin American youths in the mid 1980s to early 1990s. Reggaeton&#x27;s predecessor originated in Panama as reggae en español artist El General . After the music&#x27;s gradual exposure in Panama, Jamaica influence and heritage in Panama it eventually evolved into reggaeton. It blends West-Indian reggae and dancehall with Latin American genres such as bomba, plena, salsa, merengue, Latin pop and bachata, as well as hip hop, contemporary R&amp;B and electronica. Notable acts of early Reggaeton style music are Dj Nelson and Dj Playero.

===Reggae fusion===

Reggae fusion is a mixture of reggae or dancehall with elements of other genres, such as hip hop, R&amp;B, jazz, rock, drum and bass, punk or polka. Although artists have been mixing reggae with other genres from as early as the early 1970s, it was not until the late 1990s when the term was coined.

===ReggaeEDM===

ReggaeEDM is a fusion music genre that blends the rhythmic, bass-heavy sound of reggae with the synthetic, high-energy beats of electronic dance music (EDM). Emerging from the roots of Jamaican sound system culture, ReggaeEDM evolved as artists experimented with combining the soulful grooves of reggae and dub with modern electronic production.

People Magazine recognizes Kēvens &quot;as the creator of the reggaeEDM genre, a mix of reggae and rock&quot;. Based in Miami, FL Kēvens fuses elements jungle, reggae and live drum and bass. He is credited with coining the term &quot;ReggaeEDM&quot; in 1998 to describe his distinctive sound at the Florida Zen Music Festival.

Other notable artist who have influenced the emerging genre include Thievery Corporation, Adrian Sherwood, Asian Dub Foundation, and Major Lazer.

<text>The Oklahoma panhandle (formerly called No Man&#x27;s Land, the Public Land Strip, the Neutral Strip, or Cimarron Territory) is a salient in the extreme northwestern region of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Its constituent counties are, from west to east, Cimarron County, Texas County and Beaver County. As with other salients in the United States, its name comes from the similarity of its shape to the handle of a pan. Its largest city is Guymon in Texas County. Black Mesa State Park, located in Cimarron County, is the highest point in the state. Other points of interest include Beaver Dunes Park, Optima Lake, and the Optima National Wildlife Refuge. Oklahoma Panhandle State University is ten miles away from Guymon.

Paleo-Indian people settled in the region around 8450 BCE. Native American horticulturists inhabited the region before the European colonists arrived in the 16th century. The area became part of New Spain with the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, which set the western boundary of the Louisiana Purchase at the 100th meridian. The outcome of the Mexican War of Independence made the panhandle a part of Mexico in 1821. The area was part of the Texas Republic from its formation in 1836 until Texas became part of the United States in 1846, which left the area federal property. The area was incorporated into Oklahoma Territory and later split into three counties when Oklahoma obtained statehood in 1907.

As of the 2020 United States census, the region has a population of 28,729, and Texas County is the only county in Oklahoma to have a plurality of Hispanic residents, which make up 48.1 percent of the county&#x27;s population. Its economy is primarily agricultural, and its political elections sway in favor of the Republican Party.

==Geography==

The panhandle, long and wide, is bordered by Kansas and Colorado at 37°N on the north, New Mexico at 103°W on the west, Texas at 36.5°N on the south, and the remainder of Oklahoma at 100°W on the east.

The largest town in the region is Guymon, which is the county seat of Texas County. Black Mesa, the highest point in Oklahoma at , is located in Cimarron County. The panhandle occupies nearly all of the true High Plains within Oklahoma, being the only part of the state lying west of the 100th meridian, which generally marks the westernmost extent of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The North Canadian River is named Beaver River or Beaver Creek on its course through the panhandle. Its land area is and comprises 8.28 percent of Oklahoma&#x27;s land area. The area includes Beaver Dunes Park with sand dunes along the Beaver River and Optima Lake, the home of the Optima National Wildlife Refuge.

==History==

What is now the Oklahoma panhandle has been occupied for millennia. The Paleo-Indian people of the region were part of the Beaver River complex. A Paleo-Indian encampment, the Bull Creek site, dates back to approximately 8450 BCE, and the Badger Hole site dates to circa 8400 BCE.

Shortly before the arrival of European explorers, the panhandle was home to Southern Plains villagers. From 1200 to 1500, the semi-sedentary panhandle culture peoples, including the Antelope Creek phase, lived in the region in large, stone-slab and plaster houses in villages or individual homesteads. As horticulturists, they farmed maize and indigenous crops from the Eastern Agricultural Complex. Several Antelope Creek phase sites were founded near present-day Guymon, including the McGrath, Stamper and Two Sisters sites. The arrival of horses from Spain in the 16th century allowed American Indian tribes to increase their hunting ranges. These Southern Plains villagers became the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes.

The Western history of the panhandle traces its origins as being part of New Spain. The Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819 between Spain and the United States set the western boundary of this portion of the Louisiana Purchase at the 100th meridian. With Mexican independence in 1821, these lands became part of Mexico. With the formation of the Texas Republic, they became part of Texas. When Texas joined the U.S. in 1846, the strip became part of the United States.

The Cimarron Cutoff for the Santa Fe Trail passed through the area soon after the trade route was established in 1826 between the Mexicans in Santa Fe and the Americans in St. Louis. The route was increasingly used during the California Gold Rush. The cutoff passed several miles north of what are now Boise City, Oklahoma, and Clayton, New Mexico, before continuing toward Santa Fe.

When Texas sought to enter the Union in 1845 as a slave state, federal law in the United States, based on the Missouri Compromise, prohibited slavery north of 36°30&#x27; north latitude. Under the Compromise of 1850, Texas surrendered its lands north of 36°30&#x27;, rather than have a portion of the state as &quot;free&quot; territory. The 170-mile strip of land, a &quot;neutral strip&quot;, was left with no state or territorial ownership from 1850 until 1890. It was officially called the &quot;Public Land Strip&quot; and was commonly referred to as &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land.&quot;

The Compromise of 1850 also established the eastern boundary of New Mexico Territory at the 103rd meridian, thus setting the western boundary of the strip. The Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 set the southern border of Kansas Territory as the 37th parallel. This became the northern boundary of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land.&quot; When Kansas joined the Union in 1861, the western part of Kansas Territory was assigned to the Colorado Territory but did not change the boundary of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land.&quot;

===Cimarron Territory===
After the Civil War, cattlemen moved into the area. Gradually they organized themselves into ranches and established their own rules for arranging their land and adjudicating their disputes. There was still confusion over the status of the strip, and some attempts were made to arrange rent with the Cherokees, despite the fact that the Cherokee Outlet ended at the 100th meridian. In 1885, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that the strip was not part of the Cherokee Outlet. In 1886, Interior Secretary L. Q. C. Lamar declared the area to be public domain and subject to &quot;squatter&#x27;s rights&quot;.

The strip was not yet surveyed, and as that was one of the requirements of the Homestead Act of 1862, the land could not be officially settled. Settlers by the thousands flooded in to assert their &quot;squatter&#x27;s rights&quot; anyway. They surveyed their own land and by September 1886 had organized a self-governing and self-policing jurisdiction, which they named the Cimarron Territory. Senator Daniel W. Voorhees of Indiana introduced a bill in Congress to attach the so-called territory to Kansas. It passed both the Senate and the House of Representatives but was not signed by President Grover Cleveland.

The organization of Cimarron Territory began soon after Secretary Lamar declared the area open to settlement by squatters. The settlers formed their own vigilance committees, which organized a board charged with forming a territorial government. The board enacted a preliminary code of law and divided the strip into three districts. They also called for a general election to choose three members from each district to form a government.

The elected council met as planned, elected Owen G. Chase as president, and named a full cabinet. They also enacted further laws and divided the strip into five counties (Benton, Beaver, Palo Duro, Optima, and Sunset), three senatorial districts (with three members from each district), and seven delegate districts (with two members from each district). The members from these districts were to be the legislative body for the proposed territory. Elections were held November 8, 1887, and the legislature met for the first time on December 5, 1887.

Chase went to Washington, D.C., to lobby for admission to Congress as the delegate from the new territory. He was not recognized by Congress. A group disputing the Chase organization met and elected and sent its own delegate to Washington. A bill was introduced to accept Chase but was never brought to a vote. Neither delegation was able to persuade Congress to accept the new territory. Another delegation went in 1888 but was also unsuccessful.

===Settlement and assimilation===
In 1889, the Unassigned Lands to the east of the territory were opened for settlement, and many of the residents went there. The remaining population was generously estimated by Chase at 10,000 after the opening. Ten years later, an actual count revealed a population of 2,548. The passage of the Organic Act in 1890 assigned &quot;Public Land Strip&quot; to the new Oklahoma Territory, and ended the short-lived Cimarron Territory aspirations.
In 1891, the government completed the survey, and the remaining squatters were finally able to secure their homesteads under the Homestead Act. The new owners were then able to obtain mortgages against their property, enabling them to buy seed and equipment. Capital and new settlers came into the area, and the first railroad, the Rock Island, built a line through the county from Liberal, Kansas, to Dalhart, Texas. Agriculture began changing from subsistence farms to grain exporters.

&quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; became Seventh County under the newly organized Oklahoma Territory and was soon renamed Beaver County. Beaver City became the county seat. When Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were combined in 1907 as the state of Oklahoma, Beaver County was divided into Beaver, Texas, and Cimarron counties. The Oklahoma panhandle had the highest population at its first census in 1910, 32,433 residents, compared to 28,729 in the 2020 census.

===Dust Bowl===
The panhandle was severely affected by the drought of the 1930s. The drought began in 1932 and created massive dust storms. By 1935, the area was widely known as being part of the Dust Bowl. The dust storms were largely a result of poor farming techniques and the plowing up of the native grasses that had held the fine soil in place. Despite government efforts to implement conservation measures and change the basic farming methods of the region, the Dust Bowl persisted for nearly a decade. It contributed significantly to the length of the Great Depression in the United States. Each of the three counties experienced a major loss of population during the 1930s.

The social impact of the dust bowl and the resulting emigration of tenant farmers from Oklahoma is the setting for the 1939 novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; by Nobel Prize-winning author John Steinbeck.

==Demographics==

As of the 2010 census, there were a total of 28,751 people, 10,451 households, and 7,466 families in the three counties that comprise the Oklahoma panhandle. The racial makeup of the region was 80.26% white (including persons of mixed race), 59.46% non-Hispanic white, 1.34% African American, 1.21% Native American, 1.18% Asian, 0.12% Pacific Islander, 15.53% from other races, and 2.78% from two or more races. Hispanic and Latino Americans made up 35.85% of the population. The median income for a household in the region was $34,404, and the median income for a family was $40,006. Males had a median income of $27,444 versus $19,559 for females. The per capita income for the region was $16,447.

==Economy==
The panhandle is rather thinly populated (when compared to the rest of Oklahoma) making the labor force in this region very small. Farming and ranching operations occupy most of the economic activity in the region, with ranching dominating the drier western end. The region&#x27;s higher educational needs are served by Oklahoma Panhandle State University in Goodwell, 10 miles southwest of Guymon.

==Politics==
The Oklahoma panhandle is one of the most universally Republican areas of what has become one of the most Republican states in the nation. Beaver and Texas counties last supported a Democrat for president in 1948, while Cimarron County last supported a Democrat in 1976. In the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the three counties gave a weighted average of 86.1% of their votes to Donald Trump and 12.3% to Kamala Harris, with Trump carrying the state over Harris 66.2% to 31.9%.

In the 2006 Oklahoma gubernatorial election, the Oklahoma panhandle counties were the only three where the majority voted against the successfully reelected Democratic incumbent, Governor Brad Henry. In 2012, Democratic voters in the panhandle voted for Randall Terry, an anti-abortion activist, over incumbent Democrat Barack Obama in the Democratic Presidential primary.

<text>Zero Gravity Corporation (also known as Zero-G) is an American company based in Exploration Park, Florida, formerly of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which operates weightless flights from United States airports. Zero-G is governed under Part 121 of FAA regulations (as are all US commercial passenger and cargo airlines) enabling the company to cater to both tourists and researchers alike. Zero-G is operated by Everts Air Cargo who holds the 121 certificate.

==History==
Founded by entrepreneur Peter Diamandis, astronaut Byron K. Lichtenberg, and NASA engineer Ray Cronise, the company has been operating weightless flights since 2004. Over 15000 were clients as of November 2017. A number of notable passengers have been on weightless flights run by the company, including Penn Jillette and Teller, Martha Stewart, Burt Rutan, Buzz Aldrin, Casey Neistat, John Carmack, and Tony Hawk. Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking also completed a shortened flight on April 26, 2007.

In April 2006, Zero-G became the first commercial company to gain permission from the Kennedy Space Center to use its space shuttle runway and landing facilities.
On April 21, 2007, it began regular flights from Las Vegas for the general public at ticket prices of US$3,675. &quot;Good Morning America&quot; aired promotional footage featuring the show&#x27;s weatherman Sam Champion during a preview flight in Ohio.
On December 9, 2007, Zero G hosted Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman of &quot;MythBusters&quot; to disprove the conspiracy theory that the Apollo Moon landing was a hoax.

In March 2008, the company was acquired by Space Adventures.

On April 20, 2011, a Safety Approval was granted to Zero-G by the FAA which allows the company to &quot;...offer reduced gravity parabolic flights to prospective suborbital launch operators to meet the applicable components of the crew qualification and training requirements outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations (14 C.F.R., Section 460.5).&quot;

==Flight experience==

, the price of a flight for a single passenger starts at US$8,200.
The unique Weightless Weddings Experience is also included in the list of services
 Noah and Erin Fulmor were the first couple to get married in weightlessness.

Fliers undergo a brief training session before embarking. A flight lasts 90 to 100 minutes, and consists of fifteen parabolas, each of which simulates about 30 seconds of reduced gravity: one that simulates Martian gravity (one-third of Earth&#x27;s), two that simulate Lunar gravity (one-sixth of Earth&#x27;s), and 12 that simulate weightlessness. Each parabola begins with the aircraft climbing at a 45-degree angle at approximately , peaks at , and ends with the aircraft pointed down at a 30-degree angle.

==Fleet==

The company owns and operates a Boeing 727-227F Advanced, registration N794AJ, dubbed &quot;G-FORCE ONE&quot;. They fly parabolic arcs similar to those of NASA&#x27;s KC-135 reduced gravity aircraft. 

Zero-G’s Weightless Lab research program provides access to low gravity environments for technological development, which have been used in biomedical and pharmaceutical research, fluid and fundamental physics, materials science, aerospace engineering, space exploration hardware and human space habitation. 

Past clients, such as Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corporation, California Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Mayo Clinic, Purdue University, and Tethers Unlimited, claim that parabolic flights support their space research objectives and test readiness.

==Research flights for NASA==
NASA has a microgravity services contract with Zero-G, which provided the first flights under this contract on September 9 and 10, 2008. Flight time from Ellington Field near Johnson Space Center was provided for the FASTRACK Space Experiment Platform. The flights were funded by NASA&#x27;s Strategic Capabilities and Assets Program.

<doc id="1014631" wikidata="Q559596" url="?curid=1014631" title="Vic Toews">
<text>Victor Toews (; born September 10, 1952) is a Canadian politician and jurist. Toews is a justice of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench of Manitoba. He represented Provencher in the House of Commons of Canada from 2000 until his resignation on July 9, 2013, and served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, most recently as Minister of Public Safety. He previously served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1995 to 1999, and was a senior cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon. Prior to his appointment to the judiciary, Toews was a member of the Conservative Party of Canada.
==Personal life==
Toews was born September 10, 1952, in Filadelfia, Boquerón Department, Paraguay to Mennonite Canadian parents. His father, Victor David Toews, was a Reverend who was teaching in the Fernheim Mennonite Colony with Toews mother, Anna Peters. In 1920, his paternal great-grandparents were killed in a bomb blast during the Russian Civil War after the Russian Revolution. Vic Toews has five siblings: Bernhard, Clara, Marlene, Edward, and Esther. His family left Paraguay in 1956 for Canada and settled in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Toews speaks Mennonite Low German (his mother tongue), Spanish and English. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in History from the University of Winnipeg (1973), and a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Manitoba (1976). Toews was called to the Manitoba Bar in 1977. He joined the provincial Ministry of Justice in 1976 and became a Crown attorney the following year.

===Divorce===
Toews divorced from his wife of 30 years, Lorraine Kathleen Fehr, after it was discovered that he had fathered a child with a young Conservative Party staffer. In divorce documents, Fehr claimed Toews had a much earlier relationship with the family&#x27;s child care provider. This incident later became publicized in February 2012, when an anonymous Twitter account (later discovered to be a Liberal Party staffer) began posting information from Toews&#x27; divorce affidavit (that were on the public record, filed with the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Manitoba) as reaction to the introduction of Bill-30.

===Conviction===
In 2005, Toews was charged with violating Manitoba&#x27;s &quot;Election Finances Act&quot; in the 1999 provincial election. During the election cycle, it was discovered that his election campaign had spent $7,500 more than the allowed limit. Toews pleaded guilty, and was later convicted and fined $500.

== Provincial politician ==

Toews joined the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 1989, winning a seat in the 1995 election, by narrowly defeating NDP incumbent Harry Schellenberg in the north Winnipeg riding of Rossmere. In 1999, the Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 1999 provincial election and Toews himself lost to Schellenberg in a rematch.

===Minister of Labour===

Toews was appointed to the cabinet of Premier Gary Filmon after the election, becoming Minister of Labour on May 9, 1995. In his debut speech to the legislature, he said that his political philosophy was partly influenced by leaders of Canada&#x27;s social democratic movement, as well as his own Mennonite upbringing.

Toews&#x27;s tenure as Labour Minister was marked by a difficult relationship with organized labour. His first major legislative initiative was Bill 26 (1996), which required unions to disclose the salaries of their officials and indicate how membership dues were spent, mandated union certification votes to take place within seven days of an application, and granted employees the right to prevent their dues from being donated to political parties. Several labour leaders described the bill as anti-union. NDP leader Gary Doer argued that the provision regarding donations unfairly targeted his party, and suggested that corporate shareholders should be given the same right to shield their investments from party donations. Toews rejected these criticisms, and argued that Bill 26 provided greater autonomy to individual workers.

Toews&#x27;s department proposed the privatization of home-care delivery services in 1996, drawing opposition from many in the field and triggering an extended strike. He was also forced to deal with strikes at Boeing, Inco, and the Manitoba Lotteries Corporation, leading one journalist to describe 1996 as &quot;the busiest year for picketing since the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike&quot;. Toews blamed unions for provoking the strikes, saying they were conducted &quot;for political, not economic, reasons.&quot;

Toews cancelled the provincial Payment of Wages Fund in July 1996, argued that it was not achieving its purpose. The stated intention of the fund was to allow workers to collect revenues from employers who entered bankruptcy or receivership.

===Minister of Justice===

On January 6, 1997, Toews was promoted to Minister of Justice, Attorney General and Keeper of the Great Seal, with further responsibility for Constitutional Affairs.

====Approach to crime and the judiciary====

As Justice Minister, Toews earned a reputation for focusing on &quot;law and order&quot; issues. One of his first ministerial decisions was to grant jail superintendents the right to institute complete smoking bans, impose random drug tests, and monitor prisoners&#x27; calls. In August 1998, Toews announced that his ministry would hire more Crown attorneys and construct more than seventy new beds for the Headingley Correctional Institution, in an attempt to incarcerate more dangerous offenders.

Toews also introduced legislation to make parents legally responsible for the crimes of their children. Members of the opposition New Democratic Party argued that the plan would be ineffective, citing past experiments in the United States as evidence.

Toews criticized some criminal justice initiatives brought forward by the federal government of Jean Chrétien. In 1997, he announced that Manitoba would not enforce or administer the Canadian gun registry. Two years later, he described changes to the federal &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot; as both ineffective and too expensive. Toews nonetheless cooperated with the federal government on several issues. In March 1998, he stood with federal cabinet minister Lloyd Axworthy to announce a plan discouraging court sentences for non-violent aboriginal offenders. Toews said that the proposal was &quot;sensitive to the needs of the aboriginal community&quot;, and that it would reduce the number of repeat offenders.

Toews&#x27;s relationship with the judiciary was sometimes difficult. In May 1998, he asked a judicial appointment committee to add two names to a list of proposed judges. Some argued that this was improper interference, while Toews stated that he acted to ensure the appointment of more bilingual judges. In 1999, he delivered a speech to the Alberta Summit on Justice that criticized judges for intervening in political matters. He was quoted as saying that judges, unlike parliamentarians, &quot;are not well-placed to understand and represent the social, economic and political values of the public&quot;. Some attendees criticized his speech, and a representative of the Legal Aid Society of Alberta described it as &quot;inflammatory and sensational&quot;. Toews stated on another occasion that judges have a relatively light workload. Chief Provincial Justice Judith Webster described this as &quot;misleading and inaccurate&quot;.

In May 1999, Toews announced that Manitoba would accept a Supreme Court of Canada decision granting spousal benefits to same-sex couples.

===Opposition criticism===

The New Democrats argued that Crown offices were underfunded under Toews&#x27; watch, and suggested that the Justice Department&#x27;s prosecutorial duties were compromised.

During a legislative debate in June 1999, Toews accused NDP Justice Critic Gord Mackintosh of mischief for repeatedly calling the province&#x27;s Street Peace gang hotline only to hang up before leaving a message. Calls to the hotline were meant to be confidential and anonymous, but Toews later acknowledged that calls from government buildings had been tracked and that he received Mackintosh&#x27;s name from an employee in his department. Premier Filmon described Toews&#x27;s conduct in the matter as inappropriate. During the fallout from this controversy, Toews was forced to admit that the hotline had gone unanswered for several months.

==Federal politician==

===Party alignment===

After leaving provincial politics, Toews turned his attention to the federal scene and Canada&#x27;s &quot;unite-the-right&quot; movement. He had been a supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada for decades federally. Although he did not endorse the United Alternative initiative when it was first announced in 1999, he began calling for cooperation between the Tories and the right-wing Reform Party of Canada. He expressed interest in working with the Canadian Alliance, a successor to the Reform Party that sought to build support among Blue Tory Progressive Conservatives. Toews endorsed Tom Long&#x27;s bid for the Alliance leadership in June 2000, and approved of Brian Pallister&#x27;s efforts to bring the Progressive Conservatives into cooperation with the new party.

Toews formally joined the Alliance in the buildup to the 2000 federal election, and defeated four other candidates to win the party&#x27;s nomination in Provencher, a primarily rural riding in southeastern Manitoba. The riding was held by Liberal incumbent David Iftody, but had elected conservative candidates in the past. Toews defeated Iftody with a nearly 7,000-vote margin in the general election. The Liberals won a national majority government, and Toews was appointed as Justice Critic in the opposition shadow cabinet.

The Canadian Alliance was weakened by internal divisions in mid-2001, with several MPs calling on party leader Stockwell Day to resign. Toews did not take a strong position for or against Day&#x27;s leadership, but issued a call for party discipline pending a formal review. When Day resigned, Toews worked on Grant Hill&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign to become the new party leader.

In 2003, Toews recommended that Alliance members purchase Progressive Conservative membership cards to support the leadership bid of Jim Prentice. He denied this constituted interference, and said that members of the two parties should be encouraged to work together.

===Conservative MP===

After the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservative parties merged to form the Conservative Party of Canada in 2003, Toews joined the new party, and was a Manitoba organizer in Stephen Harper&#x27;s successful bid to become its first elected leader. He returned to office in the 2004 federal election as the Liberals were reduced to a minority government, and was retained as Justice Critic in the parliament that followed.

On January 25, 2005, Toews pleaded guilty to the charge of exceeding his personal campaign expense limits in the 1999 provincial election. He claimed that the overspending resulted from a miscommunication between his campaign and the provincial party as to how some expenses were to be accounted. There were some calls for him to resign as Justice Critic, but nothing came of this. Toews received a $500 fine, and the charge remained on his record.

A &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; poll taken in late December 2005 showed Toews as the most popular choice to replace Stuart Murray as leader of the Manitoba Progressive Conservatives. He declined to contest the position, and was returned without difficulty in the 2006 Canadian federal election.

===Policy views===

As Justice Critic from 2001 to 2005, Toews frequently accused the Liberal government of being unfocused on crime issues. He supported the Chrétien government&#x27;s decision to create a national sex offender registry in 2002, but criticized the government for not making the bill retroactive to include the names of previously convicted offenders. The non-retroactive approach followed the model of previous legislation in the United Kingdom.

Toews criticized some Supreme Court decisions, and on one occasion accused former Chief Justice Antonio Lamer of overseeing a &quot;frenzy of constitutional experimentation&quot;. He also called for official reviews of judicial appointments, arguing that the policy views of judges should be known before they take office. In September 2004, he delivered a speech to the National Pro-Life Conference entitled &quot;Abuse of the Charter by the Supreme Court&quot;. In this speech, Toews criticized judicial implementation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, suggested that judges were implementing social policy, and called on his audience to build organizations to challenge the courts.

Toews spoke favourably of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms on its twentieth anniversary in 2002, describing it as &quot;a powerful check on the power of government to unreasonably intrude on our rights and freedoms&quot;. He also called for governments to demonstrate more willingness to use the Charter&#x27;s Notwithstanding Clause to overrule court decisions. Toews specifically argued that the clause should have been used to overturn a court decision that he claimed weakened Canada&#x27;s child pornography laws. (The Liberal government brought forward remedial legislation to address this decision, without resorting to a Constitutional strategy.)

Initially considered a moderate within the Canadian Alliance, Toews later became known for endorsing socially conservative causes. He was a vocal opponent of Bill C-250 (2003), which made sexual orientation a protected category under Canada&#x27;s hate crime legislation. Toews stated that the bill could restrict freedom of expression and religion, and was quoted as saying that a &quot;homosexual activist&quot; could sue a hotel chain to remove Bibles as hate literature. He later emerged as a prominent opponent of same-sex marriage, and suggested that changing the definition of marriage in Canada could result in polygamy being legalized. In 2005, he launched an extended filibuster to delay committee work on the issue. Despite his efforts, same-sex marriage was legalized in the summer of 2005.

During this period, Toews also argued that religious organizations should be permitted to deny gay organizations the use of their facilities, supported increasing the age of sexual consent in Canada from fourteen to sixteen, and opposed the decriminalization of cannabis. He continued to oppose the federal gun registry.

===Federal Minister of Justice===
The Conservatives won a minority government in the 2006 election. On February 6, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Toews to cabinet as Canada&#x27;s Minister of Justice and Attorney-General.

In mid-2006, Toews&#x27;s department prepared draft legislation concerning religious rights and freedom of speech in relation to same-sex marriage. Some speculated that this legislation was intended to protect the &quot;free speech&quot; of religious leaders and others who criticize homosexual behaviour. The legislation was never brought forward. The House of Commons defeated a motion to reopen the debate on same-sex marriage in December 2006. While Toews remains personally opposed to same-sex marriage, he later indicated that the Harper government would not revisit the issue again.

In late October 2006, an Ontario Superior Court Judge struck down a part of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Security of Information Act&quot; as unconstitutional. This law had previously been used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to obtain search warrants for the home and office of Ottawa journalist Juliet O&#x27;Neill, after she received and published leaked information about Maher Arar. In the same week, an Ottawa judge struck down as unconstitutional a section of the &quot;Anti-terrorism Act&quot; that defined terrorism as crime motived by religion, politics or ideology. Toews later announced that the Harper government would not appeal the O&#x27;Neill decision.

In December 2006, Toews and Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Jim Prentice announced plans to repeal Section 67 of the &quot;Canadian Human Rights Act&quot;. The ministers argued that this provision sometimes prevented status aboriginals and on-reserve workers from registering human rights complaints, and said that its repeal would extend full rights protection to all First Nations people.

Toews called a judicial inquiry into the 1985 Air India bombing in February 2006. He abolished the Law Commission of Canada later in the year, saying that the government would commission other agencies to do its research work.

====Criminal justice====
Gun-related crimes

Toews introduced two bills in May 2006, requiring mandatory minimum prison sentences for persons convicted of gun crimes and eliminating house arrest as an option for various offenses. Opposition parties amended the second bill in October 2006, retaining the ban on house arrests for serious violent and sexual offenders but permitting it for non-violent property offenders. NDP Justice Critic Joe Comartin argued that this change addressed the legitimate concerns of Canadians, while removing what he described as &quot;the radical, extreme over-reaction&quot; of the Conservatives. Toews called for the bill to be passed in its original form.

In November 2006, Toews introduced a bill to toughen bail conditions for persons accused of gun-related crimes. The bill included a &quot;reverse-onus&quot; clause requiring the accused to demonstrate why they should not be held in custody. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty and Toronto Mayor David Miller indicated their support for the bill.

Age of consent

In June 2006, Toews introduced a Bill C-2 to raise the age of sexual consent from fourteen to sixteen. The bill included an exemption for adolescents who have relations with persons no more than five years older than themselves. Under Canadian law, &quot;sexual consent&quot; covers all activities from kissing to intercourse. Liberal MP Irwin Cotler argued that the Conservative Party was misrepresenting the issue to the Canadian public, and noted that the sexual exploitation of persons under eighteen is already illegal under Canadian law. Toews&#x27;s proposed changes were supported by other interested parties, including Manitoba Justice Minister Gord Mackintosh. The bill became law in February 2008, over a year after Toews left the Justice portfolio.

Dangerous offender status

Toews introduced a &quot;three strikes&quot; bill to the House of Commons in October 2006, stipulating that persons found guilty of three sexual or violent crimes will be automatically categorized as dangerous offenders unless they can convince a judge otherwise. Persons labeled as dangerous offenders under Canadian law may be kept in prison indefinitely. Critics argued that the proposed law was too broad in its scope, and included vaguely defined categories in its list of serious offenses. Civil libertarian groups also argued that the bill threatened the constitutional principle of accused persons being presumed innocent until proven guilty, and suggested that it may not withstand a court challenge.

Youth justice

In August 2006, Toews told reporters that he was willing to consider lowering the age of criminal responsibility in Canada from twelve to ten. He indicated that his focus was on treatment rather than jail time, although he did not rule out jail sentences for ten-year-olds. A Justice Department spokesman later clarified that there were no plans to bring forward such legislation. In October 2006, Toews announced plans to introduce more severe sentencing provisions under the &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot;.

Other

In June 2006, Toews brought forward amendments to expand Canada&#x27;s collection of DNA samples from convicted criminals, and later proposed amendments to ensure convicted sex offenders are automatically included in this registry. He also confirmed that his government would arm guards at the Canada-United States border, and would not revive plans by the previous Liberal administration to decriminalize simple possession of cannabis.

MPs from all parties agreed to fast-track passage of a bill toughening penalties for street racing in November 2006. In the same month, Toews introduced a bill to give the police extra powers against persons who drive while under the influence of drugs.

=====Criticism=====
Some provincial justice ministers expressed concern about the costs of Toews&#x27;s proposed sentencing reforms. Toews acknowledged that his government&#x27;s gun sentencing laws would cost $246 million per year for new prison space and $40 million for operating costs, but argued that the changes were necessary and were requested by police and provincial officials.

Liberal MP Michael Ignatieff criticized Toews&#x27;s approach to crime, arguing that adding thousands of people to Canada&#x27;s prison system will lead to young offenders becoming hardened adult criminals, and will not make Canada safer in the long term. Former Ontario Chief Justice Patrick LeSage also criticized Toews&#x27;s approach to crime issues, arguing that the country was not experiencing a crime wave and did not need &quot;draconian&quot; laws to ensure its safety.

=====Judicial appointments=====
Soon after he assumed office, Toews announced that public hearings would be held for the next justice appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. This policy was criticized by Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin and former justice John Major, who expressed concern that these hearings could foment the &quot;political warfare&quot; associated with American judicial appointments. In late February, Prime Minister Harper nominated Marshall Rothstein from a shortlist prepared by the previous Liberal administration. MPs were permitted to ask questions of Rothstein, although the ultimate power of appointment continued to rest with the prime minister. Rothstein was supported by Liberal members of the judicial committee, and was quickly confirmed to the bench.

In November 2006, Toews announced that police representatives would be appointed to the provincial judicial advisory committees that review the qualifications of potential judges. This proposal was widely criticized by the Canadian media and by opposition MPs, some of whom argued that Toews&#x27;s intent was to stack the courts with right-wing judges. In an unprecedented move, Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin and the Canadian Judicial Council issued a statement that Toews&#x27;s proposal would &quot;compromise the independence of the Advisory Committees&quot;, and called for the minister to consult with judicial and legal representatives before making any changes. The Federation of Law Societies of Canada has also criticized Toews&#x27;s plan, arguing that the government had &quot;politicized&quot; the judicial appointments process. Ontario Chief Justice Roy McMurtry and Attorney General Michael Bryant added their opposition in early 2007, with Bryant arguing that &quot;the forces of legal populism&quot; were threatening to &quot;tear asunder the basic principle of judicial independence&quot;. Toews indicated that he would proceed with his changes despite the opposition, though he was removed from the Justice portfolio before the new system could be implemented. In January 2007, the Conservatives appointed two powerful Ontario police union leaders to an advisory committee.

===President of the Treasury Board===

Prime Minister Stephen Harper shuffled his cabinet on January 4, 2007, and appointed Toews as President of the Treasury Board. Some commentators argued that Toews&#x27;s hardline approach to law-and-order issues was damaging the Conservative Party&#x27;s image among centrist voters, and described his replacement Rob Nicholson as presenting a more moderate image.

In his first major speech after the shuffle, Toews announced increased penalties and longer jail terms for bureaucrats who commit fraud against the government. In the same month, he announced that the Canadian Wheat Board would be subject to the &quot;Access to Information Act&quot;.

As Treasury Board President, Toews was responsible for overseeing the &quot;Federal Accountability Act&quot;, which was passed into law in 2006. In January 2008, he introduced a Lobbying Act to replace Canada&#x27;s Lobbyists Registration Act. The new Act created a category of senior public officials called &quot;designated public office holders&quot;, whose interactions with lobbyists would need to be reported. It also created a Commissioner of Lobbying (to replace the Registrar of Lobbyists), and increased penalties for violations. The coordinator of the group Democracy Watch was strongly critical of the changes, noting that the new rules only covered &quot;oral and arranged communication&quot; between ministers and government officials while exempting written correspondence and chance encounters. After the Act officially became law in July 2008, it was discovered that some arranged meetings between ministers, government officials and lobbyists&#x27; clients would not have to be reported at all, if the lobbyist who arranged the meeting was not actually present. Lobbyists were not required to report such meetings, and the clients would only be required to do so if they were themselves registered under the act.

In February 2008, Toews and Minister of Public Works Michael Fortier announced that the Harper government would spend $10 million less on public opinion research in its next budget. This decision followed criticism that the government was spending far more on polls than the previous Liberal administrations. Toews&#x27; department also shut down the Co-ordination of Access to Information Requests System (CAIRS) in April 2008. Critics argued that the system provided a vital resource for citizens attempting to investigate previously released documents. Toews argued that it was expensive, and slowed access to government information.

During a June 2008 parliamentary debate, Toews described Canadian jurist Louise Arbour, the retiring United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as a &quot;disgrace&quot;. He indicated that he made the remarks with respect to her past statements on Israel (during the 2006 Lebanon War, Arbour argued that the killing of innocent civilians by any party could amount to war crimes). This statement was widely criticized. Liberal MP Martha Hall Findlay responded that Toews had taken Arbour&#x27;s remarks &quot;completely out of context&quot;, and described his comments as an &quot;appalling&quot; personal attack. Claire L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé also criticized Toews&#x27; comments, writing that Arbour had avoided taking sides in the Middle East conflict.

Toews was invited to speak at an event marking the 25th anniversary of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but declined.

In November 2007, disgraced businessman and lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber filed an affidavit in Ontario Superior Court that contained serious accusations against former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The Canadian media subsequently reported that Justice officials had prepared a briefing note on Schreiber the previous year, while Toews was still minister. Bureaucrats indicated that neither Toews nor his successor, Rob Nicholson, had read the material. Some columnists suggested that the Conservative ministers may have intentionally avoided briefings on the subject.

===Minister responsible for Manitoba===

In late 2007, Toews indicated that the Harper government would not prioritize funding for a new football stadium proposed by Winnipeg media mogul David Asper. He later modified his position, and announced in June 2008 that he was interested in moving forward with a revised stadium plan.

Toews&#x27;s public visibility declined after his reassignment as Treasury Board President, and the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; reported in May 2008 that he was not playing a prominent role in discussions about the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg or the proposed football stadium.

===Federal Minister of Public Safety===

On January 19, 2010, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that Toews would replace Peter Van Loan as the new Public Safety Minister. The Adult Entertainment Association of Canada released a statement in 2010 that the government&#x27;s crackdown on sex industry worker visas had resulted in a stripper shortage, and Toews responded by saying that the strip clubs that were short on strippers because of the crackdown were engaging in human trafficking.

On April 22, 2010, Toews was accused of political interference regarding the Conservative government’s decision to cancel plans to build an $88-million facility for the Canadian HIV Vaccine Initiative (CHVI) but managed to escape blame in the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health report. CHVI was originally launched in 2007 and its initial cornerstone was the establishment in Canada of a pilot scale HIV vaccine manufacturing facility to produce clinical trial lots. Liberal MPs on the committee accused Toews and other Conservative ministers of shirking their parliamentary duties by not appearing, while Tory MPs said a week&#x27;s notice wasn&#x27;t enough time for them to fit a committee meeting into their schedules. Winnipeg spent three years and  $750,000 on its bid for a new centre, expecting to employ 60 to 70 people in high-tech jobs. Had it been built, the facility would have been capable of providing a Canadian homegrown vaccine for the COVID-19 pandemic. Over a decade later, Moderna USA proposes to fill that mRNA facility void and partner with local resources.

In February 2012, as Minister, Toews introduced the &quot;Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act&quot; (also known as Bill C-30). The bill, which made no mention of children or &quot;Internet predators&quot; outside of its title, would have granted police agencies expanded powers, mandate that internet service providers (ISPs) provide subscriber information without a warrant and compel providers to reveal information transmitted over their networks with a warrant. When criticised about privacy concerns, Toews responded that people &quot;can either stand with us or with the child pornographers.&quot; Public response followed, with an anonymous Twitter account posting personal information of Toews&#x27; court proceedings during his divorce, and around this time Conservative support appeared to back away from the bill and open up to amendments. Toews later denied that he had made the &quot;child pornographers&quot; reference, despite his comments being available in Hansard and on video. In February 2013 the government announced Bill C-30 would be scrapped entirely in favor of changes in Canada&#x27;s warrant-less wiretap law. Vic Toews resigned from his position on July 8, 2013 and retired from politics.

==Judicial career==

On March 7, 2014, Toews was appointed as a Judge on the Court of King&#x27;s Bench of Manitoba by Justice Minister Peter MacKay.

In March 2015, Toews had his judicial paycheque garnished to pay rent he owed while he lived in Gatineau during his time as a federal politician. His former landlord won an order from the Quebec Rental Board for Toews to pay $3,900 plus interest that had been unpaid for more than a year. Toews argued that he did not understand the judicial document that had been sent to him by the collections agency because it was only written in French. However, the judge overseeing the case did not accept this argument, saying that given Toews&#x27; legal experience, including his time as Justice Minister, meant he should have been aware of the issue when receiving a judicial document marked &quot;DÉCISION&quot;.

In March 2017, Toews ruled that &quot;R v Jordan&quot;&#x27;s 18-month limit before a provincial court case stayed for unreasonable delay did not apply to the speeding case he was deciding. He overturned the decision below because while the delay between the speeding incident and the day the case went to trial was exactly 18 months, the ticket was issued eight days after the speeding incident and the trial was therefore held within the 18-month limit.

==Ethics commissioner&#x27;s ruling of conflict of interest==

In April 2017, Canada&#x27;s ethics commissioner found that Toews had broken the &quot;Conflict of Interest Act&quot; by providing advice and meeting public officials on behalf of the Peguis First Nation for the Kapyong Barracks land transfer issue. In 2007, Toews, then President of the Treasury Board, had approved the transfer of the barracks to the Canada Lands Company. The Peguis First Nation, among others, filed suit against the government and named Toews as a respondent. Toews was barred by the &quot;Conflict of Interest Act&quot; from acting for any other party in the case as a formerly involved cabinet minister. Toews also breached the two-year cooling off period for public office holders by consulting for Norway House Cree Nation through his wife&#x27;s company. After receiving a private complaint, the Canadian Judicial Council, announced that it would review Toew&#x27;s actions. Toews challenged the ethics commissioner&#x27;s finding to the Federal Court of Canada, which prompted the judicial council to suspend its review pending the outcome of the challenge. Toews then suspended his challenge in November 2017, saying that he wanted the judicial council proceedings to be resolved as soon as possible.

<text>Sir Richard Hoare (1648 – 6 January 1719) was the English founder of C. Hoare &amp; Co, the oldest extant bank in the United Kingdom.

==Business career==
Raised near Smithfield Market in London, only son of horse-dealer Henry Hoare (died 1699) and Cicely (died 1679), Richard Hoare began his working life apprenticed to the goldsmith Richard Moore from 9 June 1665 for seven years. He was granted the Freedom of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths on 5 July 1672. This date marks the foundation of C. Hoare &amp; Co as a goldsmith&#x27;s business at the sign of the Golden Bottle in Cheapside, London.

== Political career ==
Hoare, a Tory, stood for election as Sheriff of London in June 1702 but was unsuccessful. He was knighted by Queen Anne in October 1702. He attained the office of alderman in September 1703. At the election of May 1705, he first stood for the constituency of London, but could only manage fifth place as the City Tories were soundly defeated. He also failed in the City election of 1708, finishing seventh as the Whigs once again dominated the poll.

Contesting the mayoral election of September 1710 he unsuccessfully challenged the Whig leader (Sir) Gilbert Heathcote but was appointed Sheriff of London instead and was elected to Parliament in the same year, finishing second in the poll. He finally became Lord Mayor of London in September 1712 having also contested the election in 1711. The City election of 1713 saw Hoare returned to Parliament having again finished second but he did not stand in 1715. He subsequently withdrew from public life in 1718 due to ill-health. Hoare died at Hendon on 6 January 1719. 

A monument to his memory stands in the church of St Dunstan-in-the-West and was designed and created by Thomas Stayner.

== Family ==
Hoare married Susanna Austen; they had 17 children (one of whom was Henry Hoare I).

<text>Daufuskie Island, located between Hilton Head Island and Savannah, is the southernmost inhabited sea island in South Carolina. It is long by almost wide – approximate surface area of (5,000 acres). With over of beachfront, Daufuskie is surrounded by the waters of Calibogue Sound, the Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean. It was listed as a census-designated place in the 2020 census with a population of 557.

Accessible only by ferry or barge, and with a full-time population of just over 400, Daufuskie Island contains environmental preserves, private communities, resorts, Gullah houses, diverse art galleries and history. The island was named a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places due to its Gullah and Civil War history. The island is also the setting of Pat Conroy&#x27;s memoir &quot;The Water Is Wide&quot; recounting Conroy&#x27;s experiences teaching on Daufuskie in the late 1960s.

==History==
Daufuskie Island has been inhabited for thousands of years, as evidenced by ancient piles of discarded oyster shells exhibiting pottery shards from all phases of the hunter-gathering period. Prior to European arrival numerous Indian tribes inhabited the Lowcountry and islands. Culturally and linguistically these tribes were of Muskogean stock. &quot;Daufuskie&quot; comes from the Muscogee language and means &quot;sharp feather&quot;, for the island&#x27;s distinctive shape.

As early as 1523, Spanish explorers were sailing the southeastern coast of North America in search of potential settlements. By 1565, the Spanish had settled in St. Augustine, Florida, and were pushing up the coast establishing and maintaining additional colonies. Concurrent with these 16th-century ambitions for settlement, the French also made attempts at colonization in South Carolina Lowcountry areas. By the mid-1600s the English began to explore the southern coast. Prosperous Caribbean planters sponsored several expeditions to South Carolina. Captain William Hilton and Robert Sandford both made voyages to Port Royal Sound and vicinity. In July 1666 Sanford entered Calibogue Sound between Hilton Head and Daufuskie.

It was during this period of early exploration that Spanish settlers introduced their distinctive Iberian horses to the Southeastern coast. Today the descendants of these horses are known as &quot;Carolina Marsh Tacky&quot;. These sturdy, intelligent horses are particularly well adapted to the swampy and marshy lowcountry region. Examples of this rare breed can still be found on Daufuskie.

In 1684, Spanish soldiers enlisted the help of native warriors to fight Scottish settlers in Port Royal, and thus began the uneasy and difficult history of native entanglement in European settlement history. The inevitable clash of cultures culminated with the so-called Yamasee uprising that consisted of three brutal battles on the southwestern shore of Daufuskie Island between 1715 and 1717 that gave this piece of land the name it still bears today, Bloody Point.

The quest for religious freedom ultimately brought two European families to Daufuskie Island—the great-grandson of French Huguenot David Mongin, and the daughter of Italian Prince Filippo de Martinangelo who escaped the Inquisition. The story of these two founding families is intertwined throughout their long history, and both rose to become powerful island plantation owners.

The American Revolution brought divided loyalties to the lowcountry. Daufuskie received the nickname &quot;Little Bermuda&quot; during the Revolution due to the residents&#x27; Loyalist sentiments. After the Revolution, Daufuskie thrived with the introduction of world-famous sea island cotton, a variety prized by European mills. High quality, sea island cotton exceeded all other long-staple cottons in fiber length, as well as fineness and strength. It was during this period of strong economic growth that several large plantation mansions were constructed.
The building of American wooden tall ships triggered the demand for timber from live oak trees abundant on Daufuskie. This hardwood species, unique to the southeastern coast, was prized by shipbuilders for its strength and resistance to rot, as well as its naturally curved limbs. Daufuskie was in the center of the &quot;live oaking&quot; trade crucial to the development of US maritime power. Shipwrights traveled to Daufuskie and the lowcountry to fell the oaks, hew them, and lug the pieces by oxen to coastal landings. The USS &quot;Constitution&quot;—&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;—was constructed with live oak.

Prior to the Civil War, there were eleven plantations on Daufuskie. Large homes were constructed on several of these tracts – Oakley Hall at Bloody Point, Melrose, and Haig Point. The mansion at Haig Point was unique as it was built of tabby. It was the largest tabby domestic building erected in coastal South Carolina.

Introduced in the southeast by early Spanish settlers, tabby is a type of concrete made by burning oyster shells to create lime, then mixing it with water, sand, ash and broken oyster shells. Three of the best-preserved, tabby-walled single slave dwellings still standing in Beaufort County can be found today at Haig Point.
Early in the Civil War, Union forces occupied the Beaufort-area islands. Union troops on Daufuskie supported the siege and reduction of Fort Pulaski protecting the Savannah River entrance. This Union presence caused white plantation owners to flee, leaving property and slaves behind. After the war, Daufuskie&#x27;s remoteness allowed Gullah culture to survive and flourish through the generations.

The Gullah language is a legacy of the original slaves and later laborers who remained once the plantations folded. The lowcountry was remote until the mid-20th century, but the isolation of Daufuskie created the perfect climate for the language and manners of the Gullah people to remain remarkably well preserved. The local dialect is heavily influenced by West African languages and rural English. Daufuskie is in the center of the Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor.

Following the Civil War the farming, mining, and timber industries were re-established in Beaufort County and the lowcountry. This activity meant the waterways around Daufuskie, with its critical position between Port Royal and Savannah, became very busy. Navigation aids became necessary to support the increased volume of shipping. In 1873 the Haig Point Range Lights were constructed on the island&#x27;s northern end. This was followed by the Bloody Point Range Lights in 1883 built to assist ships approaching the Savannah River entrance.

From the 1880s the oyster industry flourished on Daufuskie. By the turn of the century the island had a population of 2,000-3,000, most of whom worked in this lucrative shellfish trade. The flat coastline, saltmarsh estuary, and natural oyster reefs, combined with a lengthy spawning season, make waters surrounding Daufuskie the perfect habitat for growing abundant clusters of meaty, briny oysters. Daufuskie oysters were known as far away as Bar Harbor and New York. It is reported that the Tsar of Russia preferred Daufuskie oysters.

Eventually, in the 1950s, pollution closed the oyster beds and the island&#x27;s economy declined. Electricity came to the island in 1953 and telephones in 1972; however, with few opportunities for work, the population shrank to less than a hundred people, leaving a legacy of rich Gullah history. In the 1980s developers started making plans to make Daufuskie Island a residential development destination, and the planned developments of Bloody Point, Melrose, Haig Point, and Oakridge were born. Despite this progress and development, the island&#x27;s historic district has remained untouched to preserve the Gullah culture, and today the entire island is on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Industry==
The island&#x27;s shoreline and tidal range are conducive to the lengthy spawning season of oysters. On the island, the oysters grow in clusters rather than individually. The natives of the island valued the natural abundance of oysters. Massive mounds of shucked oyster shells found on the island stand as testament to the extensive use of oysters on the island by its native residents. Native Americans used the meat of the oysters as food and used shells to fashion tools, fertilizers, and tabby. The oyster industry began on Daufuskie Island in the 1880s, when an Italian immigrant named Luigi Paolo Maggioni leased oyster beds and opened a raw shuck oyster house. Later in 1893, he opened the L.P. Maggioni and Company Oyster Factory. The factory harvested, shucked, steamed, and canned oysters to ship to Savannah. The success of the company brought several others to the island. Several shucking shacks and factories remained on the island after the L.P. Maggioni Company moved to Savannah, Georgia. The oyster industry flourished as people as far away as Bar Harbor and New York considered Daufuskie Island oysters a delicacy. “Daufuski” brand oysters with the distinctive Indian chief label were shipped worldwide, reportedly even enjoyed by Tsar Nicolas II of Russia. The 1930s depression and World War II caused the oyster industry to decline as many left the island for better job opportunities. The industry faced more setbacks as pollution from the Savannah River in the 1950s contaminated the island oyster beds. New wage and hour laws increased labor costs, resulting in the cannery closing after the 1986 spring season. Fortunately, mom-and-pop shops continue to sell oysters on the island.

==Locations==
The island is now split into five parts.
To the northeast is the Haig Point Club, a private, member-owned residential club with around 150 year-round residents and over 225 homes.

South of Haig Point was the Melrose Resort and residential community. Farther south on the eastern side of the island is Oak Ridge, a small undeveloped oceanfront community, followed by Bloody Point, a semi-private residential community.

Melrose Resort remains in disrepair as of April 2019, and the former owner faces charges for using resort money to pay for his own expenses.

The western part of the island is unincorporated land. About 100 residents live in a variety of accommodations, from cabins and small houses to waterfront homes with private docks. This section of the island received federal designation as a historic district in the early 1980s. According to a study conducted by the Savannah College of Art and Design, the island has excellent examples of Gullah homes that have not been altered. There are descendants of the Gullah people living in this area on land which they have owned since just after the Civil War. The Historic District is also known for its artisan shops, &quot;quirky restaurants&quot; and one coffee shop (located in the Mary Fields School where author Pat Conroy once taught), wildlife and historic church. Most of the Historic District is traversed by historic winding dirt roads lined with Live Oaks, most of them looking very much the same as they did at least a century ago, including School Road, Benjie&#x27;s Point, Prospect Road, Bryant Road, and Pappy&#x27;s Landing.

A census in 2007 by the local Daufuskie Island Fire and Rescue Department counted a total of just 429 residents living full-time on the entire island. Rock musician John Mellencamp built a house on the island and uses it as a retreat.

==Demographics==

Daufuskie Island is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Beaufort County, in the U.S. state of South Carolina. In covers the population of Daufuskie Island, the southernmost inhabited sea island in South Carolina and a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. It was first listed as a census-designated place (CDP) in the 2020 census with a population of 557.

===2020 census===
==Culture and governance==
The island is home to the First Union African Baptist Church, which is Daufuskie&#x27;s oldest building, and is still in use today as a place of worship.

There are two historic lighthouses on Daufuskie Island: the Bloody Point Lighthouse, built in 1883, and the Haig Point Lighthouse, built ten years earlier.

The island is part of Beaufort County, South Carolina, and has an elected council. The Daufuskie Island Council serves as the official voice between Daufuskie and the county and other stakeholder groups.

Daufuskie had a long-standing tradition of self-governance, with the Beaufort County Sheriff&#x27;s office responding only to emergencies. Due to an influx of tourism, the island requested a greater police presence to monitor visitors in 2018. The now-consistent police presence is resulting in an increased number of tickets and warnings for residents and visitors alike for golf cart registrations and open containers.

==Education==
Daufuskie Island School is a Beaufort County public school built in 1997. It is a modern facility with two classrooms, lunchroom and library. The students are in multigrade classrooms: pre-K through 2nd grade and 3rd grade through 5th grade. Generally there are around 15-18 students each year, and the school has significant community support and many volunteers on the island.

Students in grades 6–12 are transported to Hilton Head Middle School and Hilton Head High School by a ferry. On Daufuskie, these students take a small school bus to the ferry. Once the students reach Hilton Head, they are picked up by a county school bus and taken to their appropriate school campus. The entire trip is about an hour and ten minutes each morning and afternoon. The students often do their homework or simply nap during the boat ride.

==Transportation==
No bridges connect Daufuskie Island with mainland South Carolina; therefore all island access must come by boat. A public ferry makes several daily transits between Buckingham Landing in the Bluffton area and Melrose Landing on Daufuskie.

Beaufort County provides a subsidized ferry that transports residents. The Haig Point Club has its own private ferry service. There are also several private companies that provide 25-30 minute water taxi services to the island. Residents of the clubs, as well as some of the other residents on the island, use golf carts and bicycles to travel around the island, although there are also some regular vehicles.

==Flora and fauna==

The Daufuskie Island Conservancy is one of several local organizations charged with preserving the ecosystem, flora and fauna, and quality of life on Daufuskie Island.

Daufuskie Island boasts a wide variety of nature and animal life. One of the notable animals that inhabit the island is the fox squirrel. The bald eagle is also one of the creatures found on the island.

==Climate==
Daufuskie Island has a humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and cool, refreshing winters.

==In popular culture==
The Jimmy Buffett song &quot;Prince of Tides&quot; (from his 1988 album &quot;Hot Water&quot;) laments the development of Daufuskie and loss of the Gullah culture.

Pat Conroy&#x27;s 1972 book &quot;The Water Is Wide&quot; is set on Daufuskie, fictionalized as Yamacraw Island. The book recounts Conroy&#x27;s experiences teaching on the island in 1969. The book won Conroy a humanitarian award from the National Education Association and an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award. The book was made into a feature film, &quot;Conrack&quot;, starring Jon Voight in 1974. The novel was also produced as &quot;The Water Is Wide&quot; in 2006, a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie starring Jeff Hephner.

One episode of the National Geographic Channel television series &quot;Diggers&quot; (S2, E10; 2013) featured professional treasure hunters Tim Saylor and George &quot;KG&quot; Wyant visiting Daufuskie seeking pirates&#x27; gold.

The March 2014 issue of &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; magazine featured the Daufuskie part-time home of singer John Mellencamp.

&quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; magazine designated restaurant Marshside Mama&#x27;s, at the County Landing on Daufuskie, as one of the &quot;Ten Best Beach Bars&quot; in America.

The Travel Channel show &quot;Bizarre Foods America&quot; featured a segment with Daufuskie native Sallie Ann Robinson on a show (S1, E8; 2012) dedicated to Lowcountry and Gullah food and culture.

Bill Gunn’s 1980 film Personal Problems centers around a nurse in Harlem who is originally from Daufuskie.

The basic concept revolves around dividing people into in-groups and out-groups. When speaking with someone from an out-group, the out-group must be honored, and the in-group humbled. That is achieved with special features of the Japanese language, which conjugates verbs based on both tense and politeness. It may also include social concepts such as gift giving or serving. The &quot;uchi–soto&quot; relationship can lead to someone making great personal sacrifices to honor a visitor or other person in an out-group.

One of the complexities of the &quot;uchi–soto&quot; relationship lies in the fact that groups are not static; they may overlap and change over time and according to situation. 

&quot;Uchi–soto&quot; groups may be conceptualized as a series of overlapping circles. One&#x27;s position within the group and relative to other groups depends on the context, situation, and time of life. For example, a person usually has a family, a job, and other groups or organizations to which they belong. Their position within the various groups and in relation to other groups changes according to circumstances at a given moment. 

=== Examples ===
A company employee may occupy a superior position within the specific company but a humble one in relation to the company&#x27;s customers. The same employee may hold a black belt, giving them a superior position within a karate club but may be a beginner at tennis and thus occupy an inferior position in the tennis club. 

The workplace is a typical example: the employees below a middle manager are in his in-group and may be spoken to using casual speech. His bosses or even, in large companies, people in other departments, are in an out-group and must be spoken to politely. However, when dealing with someone from another company, the middle manager&#x27;s entire company is the in-group, and the other company is the out-group. Thus, it is acceptable for the middle manager to speak about his own company, even his bosses, in non-honorific speech. That emphasizes that his company is one group, and although the group may have subdivisions inside of itself, it does not include the other company.

For example, when speaking with subordinates, a manager might omit the honorific &quot;-san&quot;, but he would be unlikely to do so when addressing his superiors. On the other hand, when dealing with an outsider, essentially any person not directly connected to his company, he omits all honorifics to speak about anyone in the company, including his superiors.

However, when the same manager speaks to a subordinate about the subordinate&#x27;s family, he refers to the subordinate&#x27;s family, which is the subordinate&#x27;s in-group but not his, in polite terms. However, he refers to his own family, which is his in-group but not the subordinate&#x27;s, in plain language.

Thus, the manager and the subordinate both refer to their own families as &quot;kazoku&quot; (family) and to the other&#x27;s family as &quot;go-kazoku&quot; (honorable family).

In addition to features of the Japanese language, &quot;uchi–soto&quot; also extends to social actions. For instance, in a Japanese home the most senior family member, usually the father or grandfather, normally takes a bath first; the rest of the family follows in order of seniority. 

A visitor to the home, however, is offered the first bath. Similarly, an overnight guest is offered the best sleeping arrangements even if it greatly inconveniences the rest of the family. That case is a difficult point for Westerners in Japan, who have usually been taught to be polite by refusing accommodations that inconvenience others.

==Language examples==

For detailed information, see honorific speech in Japanese.

Japanese honorific language (&quot;keigo&quot;) is divided into three forms: polite, humble and respectful. Within these forms are specific words and prefixes.

For example, the verb &quot;to eat&quot; may be given as follows: 

* &quot;taberu&quot; (plain: &quot;I/we/you/they eat&quot; or &quot;he/she/it eats&quot;)
* &quot;itadaku&quot; (humble, literally &quot;to receive&quot;, used to refer to oneself or one&#x27;s in-group)
* &quot;meshiagaru&quot; (respectful, used to refer to one&#x27;s superior)
The noun &quot;a drink&quot; may be given as follows;

* &quot;nomimono&quot; (one&#x27;s own drink), or
* &quot;o-nomimono&quot; (someone else&#x27;s drink)

Nouns involving the family, the household, or familial relations normally take honorific prefixes when denoting an out-group and not when denoting an in-group.

Some nouns change completely for the same reasons, such as &quot;chichi&quot; and &quot;haha&quot; (&quot;my father&quot;, &quot;my mother&quot;) vs. &quot;o-tō-san&quot; and &quot;o-kā-san&quot; (&quot;your father&quot; and &quot;your mother&quot;, and they are also used to address one&#x27;s own parents respectfully).

<doc id="1014669" wikidata="Q1331985" url="?curid=1014669" title="Overlay network">
<text>An overlay network is a computer network that is layered on top of another (logical as opposed to physical) network. The concept of overlay networking is distinct from the traditional model of OSI layered networks, and almost always assumes that the underlay network is an IP network of some kind. 

Some examples of overlay networking technologies are, VXLAN, BGP VPNs, both Layer 2 and Layer 3, and IP over IP technologies, such as GRE or IPSEC Tunnels. IP over IP technologies, such as SD-WAN are a class of overlay network.

==Structure==
Nodes in an overlay network can be thought of as being connected by virtual or logical links, each of which corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. For example, distributed systems such as peer-to-peer networks are overlay networks because their nodes form networks over existing network connections.

The Internet was originally built as an overlay upon the telephone network, while today (through the advent of VoIP), the telephone network is increasingly turning into an overlay network built on top of the Internet.

===Attributes===
Overlay networks have a certain set of attributes, including separation of logical addressing, security and quality of service. Other optional attributes include resiliency/recovery, encryption and bandwidth control.

==Uses==
===Telcos===
Many telcos use overlay networks to provide services over their physical infrastructure. In the networks that connect physically diverse sites (wide area networks, WANs), one common overlay network technology is BGP VPNs. These VPNs are provided in the form of a service to enterprises to connect their own sites and applications. The advantage of these kinds of overlay networks are that the telecom operator does not need to manage addressing or other enterprise specific network attributes. 

Within data centers, it was more common to use VXLAN, however due to its complexity and the need to stitch Layer 2 VXLAN-based overlay networks to Layer 3 IP/BGP networks, it has become more common to use BGP within data centers to provide Layer 2 connectivity between virtual machines or Kubernetes clusters.

===Enterprise networks===
Enterprise private networks were first overlaid on telecommunication networks such as Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode packet switching infrastructures but migration from these (now legacy) infrastructures to IP-based MPLS networks and virtual private networks started (2001~2002) and is now completed, with very few remaining Frame Relay or ATM networks. 

From an enterprise point of view, while an overlay VPN service configured by the operator might fulfill their basic connectivity requirements, they lack flexibility. For example, connecting services from competitive operators, or an enterprise service over an internet service and securing that service is impossible with standard VPN technologies, hence the proliferation of SD-WAN overlay networks that allow enterprises to connect sites and users regardless of the network access type they have.

===Over the Internet===
The Internet is the basis for more overlaid networks that can be constructed in order to permit routing of messages to destinations not specified by an IP address. For example, distributed hash tables can be used to route messages to a node having a specific logical address, whose IP address is not known in advance.

====Quality of Service====
Guaranteeing bandwidth through marking traffic has multiple solutions, including IntServ and DiffServ. IntServ requires per-flow tracking and consequently causes scaling issues in routing platforms. It has not been widely deployed. DiffServ has been widely deployed in many operators as a method to differentiate traffic types. DiffServ itself provides no guarantee of throughput, it does allow the network operator to decide which traffic is higher priority, and hence will be forwarded first in congestion situations. 

Overlay networks implement a much finer granularity of quality of service, allowing enterprise users to decide on an application and user or site basis which traffic should be prioritised.

===Ease of Deployment===
Overlay networks can be incrementally deployed at end-user sites or on hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from ISPs. The overlay has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes a message traverses before reaching its destination.

For example, Akamai Technologies manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of multicast).

==Advantages==
===Resilience===
The objective of resilience in telecommunications networks is to enable automated recovery during failure events in order to maintain a wanted service level or availability. As telecommunications networks are built in a layered fashion, resilience can be used in the physical, optical, IP or session/application layers. Each layer relies on the resilience features of the layer below it. Overlay IP networks in the form of SD-WAN services therefore rely on the physical, optical and underlying IP services they are transported over. Application layer overlays depend on the all the layers below them. The advantage of overlays are that they are more flexible/programmable than traditional network infrastructure, which outweighs the disadvantages of additional latency, complexity and bandwidth overheads.

====Application Layer Resilience Approaches====
&quot;Resilient Overlay Networks (RON)&quot; are architectures that allow distributed Internet applications to detect and recover from disconnection or interference. Current wide-area routing protocols that take at least several minutes to recover from are improved upon with this application layer overlay. The RON nodes monitor the Internet paths among themselves and will determine whether or not to reroute packets directly over the Internet or over other RON nodes thus optimizing application-specific metrics.

The Resilient Overlay Network has a relatively simple conceptual design. RON nodes are deployed at various locations on the Internet. These nodes form an application layer overlay that cooperates in routing packets. Each of the RON nodes monitors the quality of the Internet paths between each other and uses this information to accurately and automatically select paths from each packet, thus reducing the amount of time required to recover from poor quality of service.

===Multicast===
&quot;Overlay multicast&quot; is also known as &quot;End System&quot; or &quot;Peer-to-Peer Multicast&quot;. High bandwidth multi-source multicast among widely distributed nodes is a critical capability for a wide range of applications, including audio and video conferencing, multi-party games and content distribution. Throughout the last decade, a number of research projects have explored the use of multicast as an efficient and scalable mechanism to support such group communication applications. Multicast decouples the size of the receiver set from the amount of state kept at any single node and potentially avoids redundant communication in the network.

The limited deployment of IP Multicast, a best-effort network layer multicast protocol, has led to considerable interest in alternate approaches that are implemented at the application layer, using only end-systems. In an overlay or end-system multicast approach, participating peers organize themselves into an overlay topology for data delivery. Each edge in this topology corresponds to a unicast path between two end-systems or peers in the underlying internet. All multicast-related functionality is implemented at the peers instead of at routers, and the goal of the multicast protocol is to construct and maintain an efficient overlay for data transmission.

==Disadvantages==
* No knowledge of the real network topology, subject to the routing inefficiencies of the underlying network, may be routed on sub-optimal paths
* Possible increased latency compared to non-overlay services
* Duplicate packets at certain points.
* Additional encapsulation overhead, meaning lower total network capacity due to multiple payload encapsulation

==List of overlay network protocols==
Overlay network protocols based on TCP/IP include:
* Distributed hash tables (DHTs) based on the Chord
* JXTA
* XMPP: the routing of messages based on an endpoint Jabber ID (Example: nodeId_or_userId@domainId\resourceId) instead of by an IP Address
* Many peer-to-peer protocols including Gnutella, Gnutella2, Freenet, I2P and Tor.
* PUCC
* Solipsis: a France Télécom system for massively shared virtual world

Overlay network protocols based on UDP/IP include:
* Distributed hash tables (DHTs) based on Kademlia algorithm, such as KAD, etc.
* Real Time Media Flow Protocol – Adobe Flash

<doc id="1014681" wikidata="Q7198893" url="?curid=1014681" title="Pitching position">
<text>In baseball, there are two legal pitching positions: the windup, and the set. Colloquially, the set is often referred to as &quot;the stretch&quot;, although this term actually only refers to one part of the pitching motion when pitching from the set.

==Definitions==
===Windup===
A pitcher is in the windup when, with the ball, the pitcher stands on or directly in front of the pitching rubber, located at the top of the mound, with their feet pointing toward home plate. Prior to throwing a pitch, the pitcher has the option of taking one step back toward second base or to either side, using their free leg (left leg for a right-handed pitcher). During the delivery of the pitch, the pitcher must take one step forward, in the direction of home plate. Alternatively, the pitcher may step off the rubber with their pivot foot (the right foot, for right-handed pitchers) or step toward and throw or feign a throw to a base, subject to the balk rules. The balk rules do not apply if there are no runners on base. In the windup, the time of pitch is the instant when one of the following occurs: the pitcher commits to taking a step backward, or they take a step to the side, or bring their hands together.

===Set===
A pitcher is in the set when, with the ball, they stand on, or directly in front of—and touching—the pitching rubber, with their toes pointing toward the side (toward third base for a right-handed pitcher) and their arms apart at their sides. This initial part of the set is called the stretch, because the pitcher usually stretches toward home plate to take signs from the catcher. At this point, the pitcher may make any number of preparatory movements necessary for delivering the pitch. The pitcher may optionally throw to a base or disengage the rubber, but in order to pitch, he first brings his arms together in front of his body (a movement punctuated with a discernible pause). This is called &quot;coming set&quot;. After coming set, the pitcher takes a step toward home and delivers the pitch. Typically, pitchers from the set use a high leg kick, thus lunging toward home in pitching; a pitcher may instead release the ball more quickly by using the &quot;slide step&quot;, quickly stepping directly and immediately toward home and pitching. In the set position, the time of pitch is that instant when the pitcher makes a move toward home plate after coming set.

As with the windup, prior to the time of pitch, the pitcher may step toward and throw or feign a throw to a base, subject to the balk rules, or disengage the rubber by stepping back (toward second base) with their pivot foot.

==Strengths and weaknesses==

Both types of pitching position have their strengths and weaknesses. Compared to the set, the windup has a relatively slower execution, and it is therefore better suited for situations in which there are no baserunners or when the lead runner is on third base, because it is difficult to steal home plate. Conversely, a pitch from the set, having a relatively faster execution, is preferred when there are baserunners. Faster execution is important to prevent stolen bases.

However, some pitchers, particularly relief pitchers, are more comfortable pitching from the set position and thus use it regardless of the situation. Whether a pitcher starts from the windup or the stretch is all about what feels best for their own personal preference. The reason more than half of pitchers start from the windup position is because that type of motion gets a little bit more of a rhythm going before pitching.

==Impact==
Data analysis indicates that pitch velocity is equivalent whether thrown from the windup or the set position.

Additionally, common wisdom is that the set is less damaging to the connective tissue of a pitcher&#x27;s arm, but research in this area has been unable to support this hypothesis.

<text>The retinenes (retinene1 and retinene2) are chemical derivatives of vitamin A (see retinol) formed through oxidation reactions.

Retinene1 is better known as retinal and is fundamental in the transduction of light into visual signals in the photoreceptor level of the retina (known as the visual cycle). Retinene2 is more formally known as dehydroretinal.

The energy of impinging photons will convert retinaldehyde from an 11-cis isomer into an all-trans form. In the retina, this conversion induces a conformational change in the surrounding opsin protein pigment, leading to signaling through the G protein transducin. Retinaldehyde also forms a part of bacteriorhodopsin, a light-induced proton pump found in some archaea.

Experimentally, it is possible to replace 11-cis retinaldehyde by perfusing retinal tissue preparations with retinaldehyde derivatives. Selective modification of the retinaldehyde structure, particularly the density of electrons in the π-orbitals, can lead to insights into the interaction between the retinaldehyde moiety and the surrounding pigment protein.

&quot;The names of all these molecules have recently been changed ... vitamin A is now retinol, retinene is retinal; there is also retinoic acid&quot;—George Wald (1967).

<text>Elne (; ) is a commune in the Pyrénées-Orientales department in southern France.

It lies in the former province of Roussillon, of which it was the first capital, being later replaced by Perpignan. Its inhabitants are still called &quot;Illibériens&quot; in reference to the city&#x27;s Iberian name, Illiberis, one that it shared with the Illiberis that became Granada, Spain.

==Geography==
Elne is located in the canton of La Plaine d&#x27;Illibéris and in the arrondissement of Perpignan. It is situated from the Mediterranean near the Tech River, in Pyrénées-Orientales, from Perpignan and from Argelès.

==History==

Elne, from the heights of its fortified site, dominates the narrow plain of Roussillon between the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean. Numerous archeological researches have shown that the surrounding countryside has been occupied since Neolithic times. Elne was an Iberian &quot;oppidum&quot; or fortified town. Elne is the oldest town in Roussillon and since it is situated on the way towards the Iberian Peninsula, successive civilisations have left their traces. The first mention of the settlement, under the name of &quot;Illiberis&quot;, occurs in the history of Livy (xxi.24). It was the Iberian city at which Hannibal pitched camp having crossed the Pyrenees in 218 BCE, where he negotiated with the assembled Gaulish chiefs his safe passage through their territories on the way to Italy. In the first century CE, however, it was no more than &quot;a modest vestige of a hitherto great city&quot; (Pliny).

In the fourth century, Illiberis was renamed &quot;Castrum Helenae&quot; after Helena, the mother of Constantine, whence its modern name was derived by degrees. In 350 A.D., this was the location of the assassination of Constans, a son of Constantine. With the division of southern Gaul in 462, Elne became one of the &quot;seven cities&quot; of Septimania. Its Catholic bishopric was established in the 6th century. The first known bishop of Elne, Dominus, was mentioned in 571 in the Chronicle of John of Biclarum. The bishop of Elne attended the Council of Toledo in 599. Numerous synods were held by the bishops of Elne: That of 1027 in Toulouges upheld the Peace and Truce of God, that no one should attack his enemy from Saturday at nine o&#x27;clock to Monday at one. Further synods were held in 1058, 1114, 1335, 1337, 1338, 1339, 1340, and 1380.

When the Arabs crossed the Pyrenees in 719 Elne was one of the first towns to be attacked, and when the counts of Roussillon achieved independence, Perpignan became the capital of the county, with Elne remaining the Episcopal city.

The high altar of the present cathedral of Sainte-Eulalie-et-Sainte-Julie was consecrated in 1069. Its Romanesque cloister was built in the 12th to 14th centuries. In 1285, under the Aragonese domination, during the Aragonese Crusade instigated by Pope Martin IV, the town was plundered, the cathedral set on fire and the people, who had taken refuge inside, massacred by the French troops of Philip III.

During the later Middle Ages, Elne was increasingly overshadowed by the growing prosperity of nearby Perpignan; the counts of Roussillon moved their seat from Elne to Perpignan, and after vicissitudes lasting two centuries the episcopal seat was finally transferred to Perpignan also, in 1601 by a Bull of Pope Clement VIII.

In 1472 the inhabitants of Elne revolted against French rule. The town, yet again besieged, was conquered and its captain, Bernat d&#x27;Oms, beheaded (1474). In 1493 Elne, along with all Roussillon, was returned to the Crown of Aragon. In 1641 Elne suffered another siege by the French and after the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), became French. The medieval ramparts were partly destroyed in 1680 on Louis XIV&#x27;s orders.

Since then Elne has become an agricultural town which, in spite of repeated destructions caused by its several invaders, remains a witness to its past glories, attracting some 70,000 visitors annually.

In the twentieth century a sculptor and a painter have left their imprint: Aristide Maillol and Etienne Terrus, to whom a local museum is dedicated. &quot;Pomone&quot; by Maillol serves as the World War II war memorial, and the studio of Terrus, where Henri Matisse and André Derain were received, saw the birth of the Fauve movement.

Currently the city is extending towards the north, in a carefully planned urbanization— &quot;Las Trillas&quot;— extending over 40 hectares, which takes advantage of picturesque views of the cathedral. A pedestrian boulevard through the city, on the model of Barcelona&#x27;s successful &quot;Las Ramblas&quot;, is under way, as well as a new square, &quot;Place Jordi&quot; incorporating the ramparts of the upper city.

<text>Florencia Vicenta de Casillas-Martínez Cardona (born July 19, 1940), known by her stage name Vikki Carr, is an American vocalist. She has a singing career that spans more than five decades. 

Born in El Paso, Texas, to Mexican parents, she has performed in a variety of musical genres, including pop, jazz and country, while her greatest success has come from singing in Spanish. She established the Vikki Carr Scholarship Foundation in 1971. Vikki Carr has won three Grammys and was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008 at the 9th Annual Latin Grammy Awards.

==Career==

Cardona was born in El Paso, Texas, on July 19, 1940. In 1958, she graduated from Rosemead High School in Rosemead, California, in a class that included famed fashion designer Bob Mackie. Under the stage name &quot;Vikki Carr&quot; she signed with Liberty Records in 1962. Her first single to achieve success was &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot;, which in 1962 reached No. 3 in Australia and No. 115 in the United States. Producer Phil Spector heard Carr cutting the song in the studio and immediately produced his own cover version with the Blossoms (though it was presented as a recording by The Crystals) which reached No. 1 in the United States. In 1966, Carr toured South Vietnam with actor/comedian Danny Kaye to entertain American troops. The following year, her album &quot;It Must Be Him&quot; was nominated for three Grammy Awards. The title track reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States in 1967, sold more than 1 million copies and received a gold disc.

Carr followed with two US Top 40 hits: 1968&#x27;s &quot;The Lesson&quot; and 1969&#x27;s &quot;With Pen in Hand&quot;. Around this time, Dean Martin called her &quot;the best girl singer in the business&quot;. In total, Carr had 10 singles and 13 albums that made the US pop charts.

In 1968, Carr taped six specials for London Weekend TV. She made frequent appearances on various television programs, such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Bing Crosby Show&quot; in the 1964–1965 season. She appeared on The Carol Burnett Show in 1969. In 1970, she was named &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. A favorite of Johnny Carson&#x27;s, she appeared more than 30 times on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, even hosting on occasion.

She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1981. Carr also achieved the rare feat of singing for five presidents during her career: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton. The bicultural nature of her career has included recording with Vicente Fernandez and Pepe Aguilar while the likes of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin were friends.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Carr had enormous success in the Latin music world, winning Grammy Awards for Best Mexican-American Performance in 1986 for her album &quot;Simplemente Mujer&quot;, Best Latin Pop Album in 1992 for &quot;Cosas del Amor&quot; and Best Mexican-American Performance in 1995 for &quot;Recuerdo a Javier Solís&quot;. She also received Grammy nominations for the discs &quot;Brindo a La Vida, Al Bolero, A Ti&quot; (1993) and &quot;Emociones&quot; (1996). Her numerous Spanish-language hit singles include &quot;Total&quot;, &quot;Discúlpame&quot;, &quot;Déjame&quot;, &quot;Hay Otro en Tu Lugar&quot;, &quot;Esos Hombres&quot;, &quot;Mala Suerte&quot; and &quot;Cosas del Amor&quot;. &quot;Cosas del Amor&quot; spent more than two months at No. 1 on the US Latin charts in 1991, her biggest Spanish-language US hit. Her Spanish-language albums have been certified gold and platinum in Mexico, Chile, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Colombia and Ecuador. She also voiced Georgette in the Latin American dub of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;.

In 1999, Carr taped a PBS TV special, &quot;Vikki Carr: Memories, Memorias&quot;, in which she performed popular bilingual tunes from the 1940s and 1950s. Her guests were Arturo Sandoval and Jack Jones. In 2001, she released a bilingual holiday album, &quot;The Vikki Carr Christmas Album&quot;.

Carr appeared to great acclaim in a 2002 Los Angeles production of the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Follies&quot;, which also featured Hal Linden, Patty Duke and Harry Groener. In 2006, Carr made a cameo appearance in a straight-to-video thriller called &quot;Puerto Vallarta Squeeze.&quot; Carr hosted a PBS TV special in 2008, &quot;Fiesta Mexicana&quot;, which celebrated the music and dance of Mexico. Later that year she was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Latin Recording Academy. Carr marked the occasion with an appearance on the Latin Grammy telecast, in which she performed &quot;Cosas del Amor&quot; with Olga Tañón and Jenni Rivera.

In 2014, Carr was invited by producer Gerry Gallagher to record with Latin rock legends El Chicano, Alphonse Mouzon, Brian Auger, Alex Ligertwood, Salvador Santana, Ray Parker Jr., Lenny Castro, Siedah Garrett, Walfredo Reyes Jr., Pete Escovedo, Peter Michael Escovedo, Jessy J, Marcos J. Reyes and David Paich, and is featured on a remake of the Latin classic &quot;Sabor A Mi&quot; from a 2019 Gallagher studio album. In August, she headlined a benefit in El Paso for the Walmart shooting victims of the 2019 El Paso shooting.

==Personal life==
Carr has been married three times, first to producer and entertainment attorney Dann Moss, then paint company executive Michael Nilsson. She was married to San Antonio, Texas, physician Pedro De Leon from 1993 until his death in 2019.

==Charitable work==
Carr devotes time to charities including the United Way, the American Lung Association, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. For 22 years, she hosted benefit concerts to support Holy Cross of San Antonio Middle and High School in San Antonio, Texas. In 1971, she established the Vikki Carr Scholarship Foundation dedicated to offering college scholarships to Hispanic students in California and Texas. The foundation, since 2018 partnered with the San Antonio Area Foundation, has awarded more than 280 scholarships totaling more than $250,000.

<text>Pete Namlook (born 25 November 1960 as Peter Kuhlmann in Frankfurt, West Germany, died on 8 November 2012) was an ambient and electronic music producer and composer. In 1992, he founded the German record label FAX +49-69/450464, which he oversaw. He was inspired by the music of Eberhard Weber, Miles Davis, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Chopin, Wendy Carlos, Tangerine Dream and Pink Floyd, and most importantly Klaus Schulze. 

Pete Namlook released many solo albums, as well as collaboration albums with notable artists such as Klaus Schulze, Bill Laswell, Geir Jenssen (Biosphere), Gaudi, Richie Hawtin, Tetsu Inoue, Uwe Schmidt (Atom™), Amir Abadi (Dr. Atmo), and David Moufang (Move D).

By August 2005, Namlook and collaborators had released 135 albums (excluding re-releases, vinyl singles, compilations of existing material, and FAX releases beginning with PS, in which he personally was not involved in the music making).

&quot;Namlook&quot; is &quot;Koolman&quot;, a phonetic rendering of his real name, spelled backwards.

Kuhlmann died on 8 November 2012 after suffering a heart attack.

<doc id="1014694" wikidata="Q2597317" url="?curid=1014694" title="Real projective space">
<text>In mathematics, real projective space, denoted or is the topological space of lines passing through the origin 0 in the real space It is a compact, smooth manifold of dimension , and is a special case of a Grassmannian space.

==Basic properties==
===Construction===
As with all projective spaces, is formed by taking the quotient of formula_1 under the equivalence relation for all real numbers . For all in formula_1 one can always find a such that has norm 1. There are precisely two such differing by sign. Thus can also be formed by identifying antipodal points of the unit -sphere, , in formula_3.

One can further restrict to the upper hemisphere of and merely identify antipodal points on the bounding equator. This shows that is also equivalent to the closed -dimensional disk, , with antipodal points on the boundary, formula_4, identified.

===Low-dimensional examples===
* is called the real projective line, which is topologically equivalent to a circle. Thinking of points of as unit-norm complex numbers formula_5 up to sign, the diffeomorphism is given by formula_6. Geometrically, a line in formula_7 is parameterized by an angle formula_8 and the endpoints of this closed interval correspond to the same line.
* is called the real projective plane. This space cannot be embedded in . It can however be embedded in and can be immersed in (see here). The questions of embeddability and immersibility for projective -space have been well-studied.
* is diffeomorphic to SO(3), hence admits a group structure; the covering map is a map of groups Spin(3) → SO(3), where Spin(3) is a Lie group that is the universal cover of SO(3).
===Topology===
The antipodal map on the -sphere (the map sending to ) generates a Z2 group action on . As mentioned above, the orbit space for this action is . This action is actually a covering space action giving as a double cover of . Since is simply connected for , it also serves as the universal cover in these cases. It follows that the fundamental group of is when . (When formula_9 the fundamental group is due to the homeomorphism with ). A generator for the fundamental group is the closed curve obtained by projecting any curve connecting antipodal points in down to .

The projective -space is compact, connected, and has a fundamental group isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2: its universal covering space is given by the antipody quotient map from the -sphere, a simply connected space. It is a double cover. The antipode map on has sign formula_10, so it is orientation-preserving if and only if is even. The orientation character is thus: the non-trivial loop in formula_11 acts as formula_12 on orientation, so is orientable if and only if is even, i.e., is odd.

The projective -space is in fact diffeomorphic to the submanifold of formula_13 consisting of all symmetric matrices of trace 1 that are also idempotent linear transformations.

==Geometry of real projective spaces==
Real projective space admits a constant positive scalar curvature metric, coming from the double cover by the standard round sphere (the antipodal map is locally an isometry).

For the standard round metric, this has sectional curvature identically 1.

In the standard round metric, the measure of projective space is exactly half the measure of the sphere.
===Smooth structure===
Real projective spaces are smooth manifolds. On &quot;Sn&quot;, in homogeneous coordinates, (&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1), consider the subset &quot;Ui&quot; with &quot;xi&quot; ≠ 0. Each &quot;Ui&quot; is homeomorphic to the disjoint union of two open unit balls in R&quot;n&quot; that map to the same subset of RP&quot;n&quot; and the coordinate transition functions are smooth. This gives RP&quot;n&quot; a smooth structure.

===Structure as a CW complex ===
Real projective space RP&quot;n&quot; admits the structure of a CW complex with 1 cell in every dimension. 

In homogeneous coordinates (&quot;x&quot;1 ... &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1) on &quot;Sn&quot;, the coordinate neighborhood &quot;U&quot;1 = {(&quot;x&quot;1 ... &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1) | &quot;x&quot;1 ≠ 0} can be identified with the interior of &quot;n&quot;-disk &quot;Dn&quot;. When &quot;xi&quot; = 0, one has RP&quot;n&quot;−1. Therefore the &quot;n&quot;−1 skeleton of RP&quot;n&quot; is RP&quot;n&quot;−1, and the attaching map &quot;f&quot; : &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 → RP&quot;n&quot;−1 is the 2-to-1 covering map. One can put
formula_14

Induction shows that RP&quot;n&quot; is a CW complex with 1 cell in every dimension up to &quot;n&quot;. 

The cells are Schubert cells, as on the flag manifold. That is, take a complete flag (say the standard flag) 0 = &quot;V&quot;0 &lt; &quot;V&quot;1 &lt;...&lt; &quot;Vn&quot;; then the closed &quot;k&quot;-cell is lines that lie in &quot;Vk&quot;. Also the open &quot;k&quot;-cell (the interior of the &quot;k&quot;-cell) is lines in (lines in &quot;Vk&quot; but not &quot;V&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1). 

In homogeneous coordinates (with respect to the flag), the cells are
formula_15

This is not a regular CW structure, as the attaching maps are 2-to-1. However, its cover is a regular CW structure on the sphere, with 2 cells in every dimension; indeed, the minimal regular CW structure on the sphere.

In light of the smooth structure, the existence of a Morse function would show RP&quot;n&quot; is a CW complex. One such function is given by, in homogeneous coordinates,
formula_16

On each neighborhood &quot;Ui&quot;, &quot;g&quot; has nondegenerate critical point (0...,1...,0) where 1 occurs in the &quot;i&quot;-th position with Morse index &quot;i&quot;. This shows RP&quot;n&quot; is a CW complex with 1 cell in every dimension.

===Tautological bundles===
Real projective space has a natural line bundle over it, called the tautological bundle. More precisely, this is called the tautological subbundle, and there is also a dual &quot;n&quot;-dimensional bundle called the tautological quotient bundle.

==Algebraic topology of real projective spaces==

===Homotopy groups===
The higher homotopy groups of RP&quot;n&quot; are exactly the higher homotopy groups of &quot;Sn&quot;, via the long exact sequence on homotopy associated to a fibration.

Explicitly, the fiber bundle is: formula_17
You might also write this as formula_18
or formula_19 by analogy with complex projective space.

The homotopy groups are:
formula_20

===Homology===
The cellular chain complex associated to the above CW structure has 1 cell in each dimension 0, ..., &quot;n&quot;. For each dimensional &quot;k&quot;, the boundary maps &quot;dk&quot; : δ&quot;Dk&quot; → RP&quot;k&quot;−1/RP&quot;k&quot;−2 is the map that collapses the equator on &quot;S&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1 and then identifies antipodal points. In odd (resp. even) dimensions, this has degree 0 (resp. 2): 

formula_21

Thus the integral homology is
formula_22
This space is classifying space of &quot;O&quot;(1), the first orthogonal group.

The double cover of this space is the infinite sphere formula_23, which is contractible. The infinite projective space is therefore the Eilenberg–MacLane space &quot;K&quot;(Z2, 1). 

For each nonnegative integer &quot;q&quot;, the modulo 2 homology group formula_24. 

Its cohomology ring modulo 2 is 
formula_25
where formula_26 is the first Stiefel–Whitney class: it is the free formula_27-algebra on formula_26, which has degree 1.

<doc id="1014696" wikidata="Q7110441" url="?curid=1014696" title="Ould Lammas Fair">
<text>The Ould Lammas Fair is a traditional fair held in Ballycastle, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, every year on the last Monday and Tuesday of August. It is associated with the Lammas harvest festival.

The fair has been running for nearly 400 years, with records dating back to the 17th century but having origins possibly much older. Traditionally most of the crowds attending the fair would have been traders from throughout Ireland and from Kintyre, Islay, Jura and elsewhere along the Scottish coast. It is widely considered to be the oldest fair in Ireland.

Various goods are traditionally sold at the fair. These include livestock and traditional foods such as yellowman, which is a local variant of honeycomb, and dulse, which is a type of edible seaweed.

A ballad, &quot;The Ould Lammas Fair in Ballycastle O&quot;, was written by local shopkeeper and bog oak carver John Henry MacAuley and enhanced the local fame of the fair. MacAuley was also a well known fiddler, but died in 1937 before his song became famous.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Widely considered to be one of the oldest annual fairs in Ireland, The Ould Lammas Fair has been running for over 400 years with records dating back to the 17th century. However the origins of the festival may go back further. The ruined fortress of Dunaneeny Castle which overlooks the harbour is said to be where the fair first began. In 1571 the local chieftain Sorley Boy MacDonnell ordered the celebration of public games for the coming of age of his nephew Gillaspick MacDonnell. The Lammas Fair can trace its origins to these games and the sheep markets held in the area. The Irish language name of the castle, Dún an Aonaigh translates as &quot;fort of the assembly&quot; or &quot;fort of the fair&quot; - further alluding to the origins of Ballycastle&#x27;s Ould Lammas Fair. 

In 1606 Randall MacDonnell obtained a charter entitling him to hold six fairs annually at Dunaneeny Castle, one of which was to be the last Tuesday in August - which coincides with the modern date of The Ould Lammas Fair. Following the decline of Dunaneeny Castle and the MacDonnells of Antrim moving their primary base to Dunluce Castle and eventually Glenarm Castle, its likely that this is when the fair moved to its more traditional location of being centred around The Diamond as well as along Castle Street, Ann Street and Quay Road.

Its possible that the fair can trace its origins back even further to the ancient Celtic festival of Lughnasadh, which celebrates the beginning of the harvest season. 

=== The Troubles ===
On 28 August 2001 a Royal Ulster Constabulary officer discovered a large incendiary bomb in the centre of Ballycastle whilst the fair was running. After the area was cleared British Army bomb disposal experts defused the device. The attempted attack was initially claimed by the Red Hand Defenders. However, the RUC later suggested that it was carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
The 2020 and 2021 editions of The Ould Lammas Fair were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The fair had been held without interruption for nearly four centuries, including through both world wars. 

== &quot;The Ould Lammas Fair&quot; song ==
One of the most famous songs hailing from the local area is &quot;The Ould Lammas Fair&quot; written by written by John Henry MacAulay, a shopkeeper in the town and a well known fiddler who died in 1937 before his song gained the fame that it has today. A line in his song; “There’s a neat little cabin on the slopes of fair Knocklayde” is thought to refer to the cottage he grew up in.

Lyrics:

&quot;Verse&quot;

At the Ould Lammas Fair in Ballycastle long ago,
I met a pretty colleen who set me heart a-glow,
She was smiling at her daddy buying lambs from Paddy Roe,
At the Ould Lammas Fair in Ballycastle-O.
Sure I seen her home that night,
When the moon was shining bright,
From the ould Lammas Fair in Ballycastle-O.

&quot;Chorus&quot;

At the ould Lammas Fair, boys were you ever there?
Were you ever at the Fair In Ballycastle-O?
Did you treat your Mary Ann to some Dulse and Yellow Man?
At the ould Lammas Fair in Ballycastle-O.

&quot;Verse&quot;

In Flander’s fields afar while resting from the War,
We drank Bon Sante to the Flemish lassies O.
But the scene that haunts my memory is kissing Mary Ann,
Her pouting lips all sticky from eating Yellow Man,
As we passed the silver Margy and we strolled along the strand,
From the ould Lammas Fair in Ballycastle-O.

&quot;Chorus&quot;

&quot;Verse&quot;

There’s a neat little cabin on the slopes of fair Knocklayde,
It’s lit by love and sunshine where the heather honey’s made,
With the bees ever humming and the children’s joyous call,
Resounds across the valley as the shadows fall.
Sure I take my fiddle down and my Mary smiling there,
Brings back a happy mem’ry of the Lammas Fair.

&quot;Chorus&quot;

== Association with the Puck Fair ==
Another fair which contends for the title of the oldest annually held fair in Ireland is The Puck Fair which is held in Killorglin, County Kerry. One of the traditions of the Puck Fair is the crowning of King Puck, a wild goat typically captured from MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks and brought back to the town to be crowned. In 1979 King Puck was flown to Belfast in order to attend the Ould Lammas Fair in Ballycastle. 

Previously in the 1960s a delegation from Ballycastle made the journey to Killorglin as guests of the fair committee there and Killorglin people reciprocated later in the month. The delegation from Ballycastle brought gifts of yellow man and a recording of the iconic song about the Ould Lammas Fair, with the Killorglin delegation reciprocating by bringing King Puck to Ballycastle. According to local story the plan was for the goat to lead a parade and then be freed at Murlough Bay or nearby Fair Head, where lots of mountain goats roam. However when the delegation stopped at a pub in Ballyvoy, on the road to Fair Head, King Puck escaped with locals saying he became a menace causing damage throughout the area around Ballyvoy village. The story goes that no one could catch him, though someone tried to shoot him, leaving a bullet mark on one of his horns.

<text>The Audi Q7 is a crossover SUV made by the German manufacturer Audi, unveiled in September 2005 at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Production of this seven-seater SUV began in the autumn of 2005 at the Volkswagen Bratislava Plant in Bratislava, Slovakia.

The Q7 was the first SUV sold by Audi and went on sale in 2006. Later, Audi&#x27;s second SUV, the Q5, was unveiled as a 2009 model. Audi has since unveiled a third SUV model, the Q3, which went on sale in the third quarter of 2011, and a fourth SUV model, the Q2, which went on sale in November 2016. The Q7 shares a Volkswagen Group MLB platform and chassis with the Bentley Bentayga, Lamborghini Urus, Porsche Cayenne and the Volkswagen Touareg.

The Q7 is the second largest vehicle from Audi, being surpassed by the Q6 since 2022. While the Q7 has been the flagship SUV in Audi&#x27;s product portfolio, a top-of-the-line model with a lower roof, called the Audi Q8, was released in 2018.

It was one of the vehicles involved in the Volkswagen emissions scandal, with the company ordered to buy back some of the affected cars manufactured between 2009 and 2012. The Q7 is also subject to hundreds of NTSB complaints with many relating to potentially catastrophic engine failure issues, and a class-action lawsuit related to squealing brakes.


==First generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 4L; 2005)==

The Q7 (internally designated &quot;Typ 4L&quot;) utilizes a modified version of the Volkswagen Group PL71 platform. Previewed by the Audi Pikes Peak quattro concept car, the Q7 is designed more for on-road use, and was not meant for serious off-road use where a transfer case is needed. In an off-road test through the Australian outback it fared well for a &quot;soft roader&quot;.

Development began in 2002 under the code AU 716, primarily focused on the Pikes Peak Concept. Design work was frozen for the Concept in July 2002, for presentation at the North American International Auto Show in January 2003. Following the introduction of the concept, full-scale development began on Typ 4L of the PL71 platform.

The production design was frozen in late 2003, for a late 2005 start of production. Prototypes went into testing in 2004, with development concluding in the first half of 2005. It introduced the world&#x27;s only series production passenger car V12 TDI diesel engine.

Giles Smith, writing for &quot;the Guardian&quot; described the first-generation Q7 as &quot;the SUV that dwarfs everybody else&#x27;s SUV.&quot; Writing for the same newspaper, Martin Love described the interior as &quot;a master class in luxury&quot; whilst calling the Q7 &quot;vast, whale-like, bloated ... it&#x27;s the Lurch of the hard shoulder, a gas-guzzling Zeppelin&quot; and saying &quot;clearly those who buy SUVs couldn&#x27;t give a monkey&#x27;s about petrol consumption, but responsible makers such as Audi need to protect these people from themselves.&quot; In &quot;the Sunday Times&quot;, Gavin Conway called the Q7 &quot;vast and intimidating&quot; and said &quot;the whole cabin feels expensively made out of high-quality materials&quot; before noting the lack of space in the third row of seats compared to similar cars from other manufacturers.

Although lacking a low-range transfer case, it has permanent four-wheel drive system with a central locking differential, and a self-levelling air suspension with Continuous Damping Control, called adaptive air suspension, which helps in off-road situations.

As part of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, the car featured software that allowed it to cheat at emissions tests, giving the impression that it emitted far-less harmful nitrogen oxide pollution that it actually does.

0– performance for Q7 3.6 VR6 FSI is 8.5s, 4.2 V8 FSI is 7.4s and for 5.9 V12 TDI is 5.5s.

===Safety===
Despite its multiple airbags and safety electronics, such as Electronic Stability Programme (ESP), the Q7 scored only four stars out of five () in the Euro NCAP crash test for adult occupant protection. According to Audi, this was caused by a design error, and has since been fixed in cars manufactured after the test which should allegedly lead to five stars. Official tests to prove this remain to be done as of March 2009. &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that &quot;because of its size and wadded insulation, the Q7 provides its driver with a spectacularly complete illusion of safety&quot; before noting that SUVs are more likely to get into crashes, especially rollovers.

However, in the United States, the Q7 received five out of five stars () from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety test for both front and side impacts. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Q7 its Top Safety Pick 2009, with &quot;Good&quot; ratings in all 14 measured categories of the front and side impact test.
The 2015 Q7 has a rollover risk of 18.5%.

===North American models===
It was first released as 2007 model, with Q7 4.2 quattro available at launch.

===Q7 hybrid (2005)===
The Q7 hybrid is a concept vehicle using the engine from the 4.2 FSI with an electric motor to provide extra torque, and nickel-metal hydride battery. It has 0– acceleration time of 6.8 seconds. The vehicle weighs , heavier than the petrol counterpart.

The vehicle was unveiled at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show.

Audi reportedly was going to introduce a hybrid version of the Q7 sometime in the future. However, the low US dollar caused Audi to drop the plans for the US market, but stated limited quantities would be available for the commercial market. Audi&#x27;s research and development chief, Michael Dick, later announced Q7 hybrid would be produced in limited numbers for test purposes only and that development work would focus on a more advanced lithium-ion battery-based hybrid system for the Q5.

===Q7 3.0 TDI clean diesel (2010)===
The Q7 3.0 TDI clean diesel is a version of the 3.0 V6 TDI with selective catalytic reduction. The engine was later used in the next generation of the Q7 for the European market. The 3.0-litre TDI S line can accelerate from in 8.4 seconds and has a top speed of .

US models of the 2009 Audi Q7 TDI Premium went on sale in 2009–15 with a base MSRP of $50,900 (excluding a destination charge of $825, taxes, title or dealer charges).

===Q7 4.2 TDI (2007–2009)===
The vehicle was unveiled at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show.

The production version went on sale in early summer 2007.

===Q7 V12 TDI (2008–2012)===

The V12 TDI engine was &quot;based&quot; on the diesel technology from Audi R10 TDI race car, though both engines are completely unrelated: the bore / stroke / angle of the blocks are different and they do not share a single component. The only twelve-cylinder diesel engine used in any passenger car, it was rated at and of torque. This gives the vehicle a acceleration time of 5.5 seconds. The Q7 V12 TDI is, according to Audi, the best handling Q7 due to a revised suspension, tires and brakes. Audi claims the Q7 V12 TDI can handle a lateral acceleration of over .9 g on a skid-pad.

The concept vehicle originally appeared at the 2006 Paris Motor Show.

Audi had announced V12 diesel version for the US market using diesel emission treatment technology jointly developed with Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz under the label &quot;BlueTec&quot;. Audi cancelled the plan to federalize the Q7 V12 TDI for the US market due in part to the global financial crisis of 2008.

This V12 version is no longer available for the model year 2013 in anticipation of the cosmetic and mechanical update of Q7 for 2014. The auto listing websites, mobile.de and autoscout24.de, have shown the 2012 model year availability of V12 version.

===Audi Q7 coastline (2008)===
The Audi Q7 coastline is a concept version of the Q7 V12 TDI that features an Inuit white interior with wood decoration. The design theme was inspired by luxury yachts. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show.

===Facelift (2010–2015)===

The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance.

Exterior changes include new front and rear lights which better incorporate LED lighting with optional LED turn signals and daytime running lights, new wheel designs, chrome accents, four new paint colours, and updated body styling in the front and rear.

A redesigned interior includes a new instrument cluster, new leather seating, ambient door lighting, new interior colour choices, new trim, and the third generation MMI control system.

===Q7 3.0 TDI clean diesel quattro (2009–2015)===
It is a version of 3.0 TDI with selective catalytic reduction. CO2 emission was reduced to 234 g/km with Euro 6 certification, but the vehicle is heavier.

Per Popular Mechanics 01 Oct. 2009, at 72.5MPH with an RPM of 2,200 - 2,500 (the sweet spot of the top 6th gear), the car achieved a 29.6 MPG of diesel. The 8-speed transmission, available 2011 and later, was 11-14% more fuel-efficient than the previous 6-speed transmission (available since 2009-2010 model year) in U.S. models.

===Q7 2011===
A brand new facelift brought optional LED headlights, an 8-speed transmission, start/stop fuel-saving technology, CO2 rating reduced to 195 g/km, and a wraparound tailgate design. Also, more flat and metallic colours became available and 21-inch titanium-effect wheels became an optional extra. Certain models now achieved upwards of 37 MPG IMP. The 3.6 L V6 and 4.2 L V8 gasoline engines both of which are naturally-aspirated have been replaced by 3.0 L supercharged V6 gasoline engines. One of the supercharged engines puts out and of torque. The other engine, also found in the Audi S4 and Audi S5 Cabrio, puts out and of torque is used in the S-line Prestige Q7. Both engines have the same fuel economy.

===Q7 2012===
Audi added their new Audi Connect to the MMI system, which adds internet-driven POI search, via user input or the voice control system, as well as access to online services delivering local fuel prices, news, weather and other information. Audi Connect also offers in-car WiFi connectivity for up to 8 devices.

2012 was the last model year for the V12 version.

===US models===
The vehicles were introduced in 2006 as 2007 models. Available models include 3.6 FSI Quattro and 4.2 FSI Quattro.

Changes include standard LED taillights with available LED turn signals and daytime running lights and SIRIUS traffic system.

The production version went on sale in July 2006.

For 2011, the 3.6 FSI and 4.2 FSI engines were replaced by two 3.0 L TFSI supercharged engines. The base version develops ( for 2012) and of torque, while the S-Line has and of torque.

The V12 Diesel engine is not available in the United States.

=== Powertrain ===
===Transmission===
All models include 6-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission as standard. A 6-speed manual transmission was offered only in Europe on the first generation Q7 with the 3.6-litre engine. From 2010 (2011 model year in the U.S.), the 8-speed automatic transmission is standard.

== Second generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 4M; 2015)==

The second generation Audi Q7 was unveiled in January 2015 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The diesel- and petrol-powered versions were released for retail sales in 2015, followed shortly by diesel-powered plug-in hybrid variant, which is sold in Europe, but not in Canada.

In 2016 the BBC noted the Q7 as one of several models on the market which were too large to fit in a standard parking space.

=== Q7 e-tron ===
The plug-in hybrid, called the Q7 e-tron TDI Quattro, is powered by a 3.0-litre TDI V6 turbo-diesel engine mated with an electric motor-generator placed in the 8-speed automatic gearbox to provide a maximum output power of and a maximum torque of four-wheel drive. An electronically controlled clutch can disconnect the V6 engine from the rest of the powertrain. The electric motor is powered by a 17.3 kWh lithium-ion battery capable of delivering an all-electric range of . The Q7 e-tron produces emissions between 50 and 48 g/km, and has a fuel consumption of under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The &quot;Irish Independent&quot; found these official fuel economy claims to be completely unrealistic, although they noted that the they achieved in their tests to be &quot;still exceptional for a large SUV like this&quot;. The Q7 e-tron accelerates from zero to in 6.2 seconds in hybrid mode, and in 6.5 seconds in all-electric mode. Its top speed in hybrid mode is and in electric mode.

Audi announced the Q7 e-tron TFSI at the 2015 Shanghai Auto Show, developed specially for Asian markets (China, South Korea, Singapore and Japan). Its 2.0 TFSI and electric motor deliver and of system torque – enough to accelerate from 0 to in 5.9 seconds and for a top speed of . The standard consumption of 2.5 liters of fuel (94.1 US mpg) corresponds to emissions of less than 60 grams per kilometer (96.6 g/mi). All-electric range will be up to . Audi&#x27;s marketing of the model has led to accusations of greenwashing.

Due to its large size and poor environmental record, Environmental Action Germany nominated the Q7 plug-in hybrid for their &quot;Goldener Geier&quot; (&quot;Golden Vulture&quot;) 2020 award.
===Markets===
The second generation of the Q7 will be the first of the Q7 to be sold in Bangladesh.

The Q7 2.0 TFSI (1984 cc, ) is also available in the Russia, United States, Canada, India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

For Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; Audi debuted a commercial for the SQ7 directed by the Russo brothers featuring unreleased scenes from the car chase feature in the film as well as providing several SQ7 and other vehicles for the film.

=== 2020 facelift ===
The Q7 was facelifted for the 2020 model year, introducing styling tweaks such as a redesigned grille, front and rear bumpers, new side sills, chrome trim for the tailgate and revised exhaust tips. It comes with two-tone paint as standard, which highlights the front splitter, side skirts, wheel arches and rear diffuser in anthracite, a range of mild-hybrid powertrains and refined chassis. Inside, Audi installed a new infotainment system with dual touchscreens. The dashboard and center console were also updated to accommodate the new system.

LED headlights are included as standard, Matrix LEDs or HD Matrix LEDs and Audi Laser Light are offered as additional cost options. The HD Matrix LEDs and Audi Laser Light combine automatic controlled high beam with small laser module in each unit to double the range of the Q7&#x27;s full beam.

Air suspension as standard (only on Prestige and Technik trims in US and Canada, respectively). Audi has also expanded the Q7&#x27;s options list to include a new active roll-stabilisation system (only available on SQ7 Prestige and SQ7 in US and Canada, respectively). It provides active anti-roll bars, controlled by a 48-volt electric motor that automatically adjust to reflect the driving style and road conditions.

Three mild-hybrid 3.0-litre V6 powertrains are available, with the choice of two diesels and one petrol. The entry-level 45 TDI diesel produces and of torque with a claimed time of 7.1 seconds and a top speed of . Mid-range 50 TDI models produce and of torque, delivering a of 6.3 seconds and a top speed of . The 55 TFSI petrol model comes with and of torque, with a claimed 5.6 seconds and a electronically limited top speed. An eco-focused plug-in hybrid 55 TFSI e version will be introduced a few months after initial sales.

Audi also offers a performance-focused SQ7 version, powered by a 429BHP (that can be upgraded to max 650hp) 4.0-litre V8 turbodiesel with of torque; it has a claimed time of 4.8 seconds and a limited top speed of . The US model will use a V8 engine with the same displacement (shared with the US-market SQ8), albeit fueled by gasoline/petrol and producing and of torque; it went on sale in late spring 2020.

Sales in the UK started from September 2019.

Now, SQ7 offers a TFSI variant with a 4.0 twin-turbocharged V8 petrol engine delivers and of torque. It accelerates from within 4.3 seconds and on to a maximum speed of .

=== 2024 facelift ===

Audi announced a second facelift for the 2024 model year, introducing further enhancement to the front and rear headlight design, whilst offering features such as HD Matrix LED headlights featuring a Laser high-beam and different lighting signatures, while the OLED rear lights feature their own new design.

<doc id="1014713" wikidata="Q5544402" url="?curid=1014713" title="George Seifert">
<text>George Gerald Seifert (born January 22, 1940) is an American former football coach. He served as the head coach for the San Francisco 49ers and the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL). Seifert owned the second-greatest winning percentage in NFL history by a head coach at the time of his resignation as the 49ers head coach, second to Guy Chamberlin. Among coaches with at least 100 wins, his winning percentage is fifth best in football history.

==Youth==
Seifert was born and raised in San Francisco. He ushered at 49ers home games at Kezar Stadium while he attended San Francisco Polytechnic High School across the street. He attended the University of Utah, playing guard and linebacker for the Utes.

==Early coaching career==
He served as graduate assistant at his alma mater for a year before being hired as head coach of Westminster College in Salt Lake City at age 25, where he led the Parsons to a 3–3 record.

After working as an assistant at the University of Iowa, the University of Oregon, and Stanford University, Seifert was hired as head coach at Cornell University, then fired in November 1976 after going in two seasons. He then returned to Stanford in 1977, where he met Bill Walsh. When Walsh moved to the 49ers in 1979, Seifert joined his coaching staff the following year as the team&#x27;s defensive backs coach. Seifert was promoted to defensive coordinator in 1983.

As a 49er assistant, Seifert defenses finished in the top ten in fewest points allowed in each of his six seasons in that capacity: fourth in 1983, first in 1984, second in 1985, third in 1986 and 1987, and eighth in 1988. His final two defenses, 1987 and 1988, finished first and third in fewest yards allowed, respectively.

==Head coaching career==

===San Francisco 49ers (1989–1996)===
On Seifert&#x27;s 49th birthday, the 49ers won Super Bowl XXIII. Four days later, on January 26, 1989, Seifert was promoted to succeed Walsh as 49ers head coach as Walsh moved to the front office; owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. wanted a &quot;name coach&quot; but Walsh&#x27;s push for Seifert won out, which happened as the Cleveland Browns wanted to interview Seifert for the job. He would soon be characterized as a coach with intense focus and superstition, whether that involved bluntness or not walking across the 49ers helmet spraypainted on the practice turf. Seifert coached his first game as a head coach against the Indianapolis Colts and saw a 30–24 victory that got the ball rolling for a dominant season. Bolstered by an MVP season from Joe Montana to go with a highly ranked defense, the 49ers went 14–2 (losing those two games by a combined total of five points) to clinch the #1 seed in the playoffs. They crushed their opponents in the Divisional Round and NFC championship to reach Super Bowl XXIV. They blew out the Denver Broncos 55–10, the worst defeat for a team in Super Bowl history; that Niners team is considered one of the best ever. Seifert was the first rookie head coach to win the Super Bowl since Don McCafferty in Super Bowl V.

The 1990 team tried to return to the Super Bowl for a possible &quot;three-peat&quot;, which started with ten straight wins to start the season. They roared to the end of the year with a record of 14–2, handily above the second seed New York Giants. The two teams would meet in the NFC Championship at Candlestick Park for a highly contested defensive affair; the teams were tied 6–6 at halftime. Montana was knocked out of the game on a rough hit while trying to preserve a 13–9 lead in which New York did not score a touchdown, but a late Roger Craig fumble got the Giants another chance and they drove down the field to kick a game-winning field goal and end the 49ers season; it was only the second postseason loss at home since 1981. As it would turn out, it was the last postseason game for Montana and Craig as 49ers, as an elbow injury knocked Montana out of 1991 and most of 1992 and Craig left in free agency. Steve Young went on to become the starting quarterback for the Niners, with Montana getting traded in 1993.

The 1991 season saw the departure of Craig and Ronnie Lott. The 49ers lost four of their first six games. A narrow 10–3 loss to the New Orleans Saints had the team at 4–6. From that point, the 49ers won the last six games in a row, but in the last game of the year, they did not control their playoff hopes. Atlanta held the tiebreaker with their two wins over San Francisco to sneak in as the sixth seed, while New Orleans had 11 wins to win the division. San Francisco missed the playoffs for the first time since 1982.

The 1992 team (where Seifert ceded a portion of the playcalling on offense to his coordinator) saw the Niners engage in history with the &quot;No Punt Game&quot; against the Buffalo Bills in a 34–31 loss. It was one of only two losses for the team that year as the Niners won eight straight games to close out the regular season with the #1 seed at 14–2, as Steve Young went on to be named the league&#x27;s MVP. The 49ers rolled over Washington to reach the NFC Championship against the Dallas Cowboys in San Francisco. A four turnover day could not be overcome as Dallas took the lead in the second quarter and never let go in a 30–20 victory.

The 1993 team went to the NFC Championship for the fifth time in the last six seasons, although they had a shaky start, winning three of their first six games. They ran off six straight wins to get to 9–3 before stumbling onto one win in their last four games, ranking as the #2 seed. They won the Divisional playoff game but had to go to #1 seed Dallas for the NFC Championship, where Dallas scored 21 second quarter points in a 38–21 rout.

Seifert and the Niners had a tremendous 1994 season that saw Young win another MVP award with a historic passer rating (112.8), as the team scored a franchise record 505 points. They went 13–3 and dominated their competition in the playoffs, with the closest game being a 38–28 victory over Dallas in the NFC Championship. The 49–26 victory over the San Diego Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX was historic as Young threw for six touchdown passes, and Seifert became one of few coaches with multiple Super Bowl championships.

The 1995 and 1996 seasons saw San Francisco reach the postseason each time only to lose to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round, the latter being a 35–14 rout on the road. Walsh had been hired as an offensive assistant prior to the 1996 season, which had been seen in some way as a sign of Seifert&#x27;s vulnerability as head coach, and he himself thought the year would be like 1994 as &quot;another live-or-die season&quot; (the previous year, he had let defensive coordinator Pete Carroll have the responsibilities of the defense). Despite owning the best winning percentage of any NFL head coach in the league&#x27;s history, 49ers management did not offer an extension on Seifert&#x27;s contract. 49ers team president Carmen Policy desired to hire California head coach Steve Mariucci to the same position in the 49ers organization. Policy offered Seifert the opportunity to remain head coach for the final year of his contract, with Mariucci serving as offensive coordinator and head coach-in-waiting. Seifert then resigned. His 98 wins are still the most in franchise history.

===Carolina Panthers (1999–2001)===
After two years out of the game, Seifert was hired by the Carolina Panthers as head coach. He was also de facto general manager; the Panthers had not had a general manager since Bill Polian&#x27;s departure in 1997. During his first training camp with the Panthers, he told his players that they should not act like wildebeests. He explained that wildebeests usually give up when caught by a lion. &quot;Don&#x27;t be that wildebeest,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&#x27;t give up.&quot;

In his first season, Seifert led the Panthers to an 8–8 record, a four-game improvement from 1998. The most notable play of that year came when quarterback Steve Beuerlein scored a game-winning touchdown on a fourth-and-five quarterback draw with five seconds left in the fourth quarter to defeat the Green Bay Packers. The Panthers went into the final day of the regular season in contention for a playoff berth; however, their victory margin over the New Orleans Saints needed to be 18 points greater than the Packers&#x27; margin over the Arizona Cardinals in order to make the playoffs. While the Panthers routed the Saints 45–13, the Packers beat the Cardinals 49–24, leaving the Packers ahead on point differential and eliminating the Panthers.

The Panthers were competitive for most of 2000 as well but needed to win their season finale against the Oakland Raiders to finish at .500. Instead, the Raiders won in a 52–9 rout, still one of the most lopsided losses in Carolina history, and the Panthers finished with a 7–9 record.

Seifert presided over the 2001 NFL draft, which netted the Panthers Steve Smith and Kris Jenkins, two cornerstones of the franchise. Seifert made the push to not retain Beuerlein as the starting quarterback, instead going with Jeff Lewis (signed in 1999) as the intended starter. However, Lewis struggled mightily in the preseason, leading Seifert to cut Lewis before the season even started, as 29-year-old rookie quarterback Chris Weinke was tabbed to start for the team. In the first game of the season, they pulled off a shocking upset of the defending NFC Central champion Minnesota Vikings, winning 24–13. They followed up that impressive victory by losing every game the rest of the year, finishing at 1–15 (with nine losses by eight points or less), the worst record in franchise history. The Panthers&#x27; final two games were played before what are still the two smallest crowds in franchise history (in terms of turnstile count), including a 38–6 loss to the New England Patriots that drew only 21,000 people. After the game, Seifert announced that he was planning to return for the 2002 season. Team owner Jerry Richardson had other plans, however, firing Seifert the following day. Richardson stated that the energy &quot;has been sucked out of our organization and our fan base. In my opinion, we had no alternative.” Wesley Walls, who played for Seifert in both San Francisco and Carolina, stated that Seifert lacked a cohesive leadership in the locker room with the Panthers, saying that when the team started to get worse, &quot;we felt like he kind of disappeared a little bit from us&quot;, while not placing the blame fully on Seifert. For his part, Seifert said he had no hard feelings or regrets about how his tenure went down in Carolina, only wishing they had won more games.
Seifert is the first head coach since the implementation of the 16-game schedule in place from 1978 to 2020 to guide a team to 15 consecutive losses following a Week 1 victory. Seifert&#x27;s dubious distinction would be matched by Doug Marrone of the 2020 Jacksonville Jaguars.

Entering the 2024 season, Seifert, Matt Rhule (2020–2022), and Frank Reich (2023) are the only Panthers coaches to have never had a winning season nor coached a playoff game.

==Broadcasting stint==
CBS Sports hired Seifert to serve as a panelist for &quot;The NFL Today&quot; in its first season after CBS regained NFL broadcast rights (for the AFC) in 1998. His performance was not well received, however, and the network removed him before the end of the regular season.

==Personal life==
Seifert currently resides in Bodega Bay, California and Incline Village, Nevada with his wife Linda. They have two children, Eve and Jason.

<doc id="1014716" wikidata="Q442829" url="?curid=1014716" title="Silvina Ocampo">
<text>Silvina Ocampo (28 July 1903 – 14 December 1993) was an Argentine short story writer, poet, and artist. Ocampo&#x27;s friend and collaborator Jorge Luis Borges called Ocampo &quot;one of the greatest poets in the Spanish language, whether on this side of the ocean or on the other.&quot; Her first book was &quot;Viaje olvidado&quot; (1937), translated as &quot;Forgotten Journey&quot; (2019), and her final piece was &quot;Las repeticiones&quot;, published posthumously in 2006.

Before establishing herself as a writer, Ocampo was a visual artist. She studied painting and drawing in Paris where she met, in 1920, Fernand Léger and Giorgio de Chirico, forerunners of surrealism.

She received, among other awards, the Municipal Prize for Literature in 1954 and the National Poetry Prize in 1962.

== Personal life ==
Ocampo was born to a wealthy family in Buenos Aires, the youngest of six daughters (Victoria, Angélica, Francisca, Rosa, Clara María, and Silvina) of Manuel Silvio Cecilio Ocampo and Ramona Aguirre Herrera. Her family resided on the Canary Islands before moving into Argentina on the mid 19th century. Ocampo was the sister of Victoria Ocampo, the founder and editor of the prestigious Argentine journal &quot;Sur&quot;.

Ocampo was educated at home by tutors and in Paris. Her family belonged to the upper bourgeoisie, a fact that allowed her to have a very complete training. She had three governesses (one French and two English), a Spanish teacher, and an Italian teacher. Because of this, the six sisters learned to read in English and French before Spanish. This trilingual training would later influence Ocampo&#x27;s writing, according to Ocampo herself.

Her ancestors belonged to the Argentine aristocracy and owned extensive lands. Her great-great-great-great-grandfather, José de Ocampo, was governor of Cuzco before moving to Virreinato del Río de la Plata. Manuel José de Ocampo (her great-great-great-grandfather) was one of the first governors when independence was declared. Her great-grandfather Manuel José de Ocampo y González was a politician and candidate for president of the country. He was also a friend of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. Her grandfather, Manuel Anselmo Ocampo, was a rancher. Another of her ancestors was Domingo Martinez de Irala, conqueror of Asunción and future governor of Río de la Plata and Paraguay. The brother of Ocampo&#x27;s great-great-great-grandmother, Juan Martín de Pueyrredón, was Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Another distant relative is Juan Manuel de Rosas who was the main leader until 1852.

Her mother, Ramona Máxima Aguirre, was one of eight children. She enjoyed gardening and playing the violin. Her family was of Creole origins and religious. Her father, Manuel Silvio Cecilio Ocampo Regueira, was born in 1860 and was an architect. He was one of nine children and had a conservative character.

In winter, Ocampo visited her great-grandfather, who lived nearby, daily. During the summer, her family lived in a villa in San Isidro, a modern house that in its time had electricity and running water. Currently, this house (Villa Ocampo) is a UNESCO site and recognized as a historical monument. In the summer, she took classes on the second floor, where she learned the fundamentals that would later help her become a writer.

The critic Patricia Nisbet Klingenberg maintains, however, that as a child Ocampo &quot;lived a lonely existence, relieved primarily by the companionship of various household workers [. . . ] This, then, is the place from which her works emerge, from memory and identification with those identified as other.&quot;

Two events that had a significant impact on Ocampo in her youth were the marriage of her sister Victoria and the death of her sister Clara. She stated that Victoria&#x27;s marriage had taken away her youth: &quot;Hubo un episodio de mi niñez que marcó mucho nuestra relación. Victoria me quitó la niñera que yo más quería, la que más me cuidó, la que más me mimó: Fanni. Ella me quería a mí más que a nadie. Fanni sabía que yo la adoraba, pero cuando Victoria se casó y se la llevó con ella nadie se atrevió a oponérsele&quot; [There was an episode from my childhood that strongly marked our relationship. Victoria took away the nanny that I loved the most, the one who cared for me the most, the one who pampered me the most: Fanni. She loved me more than anyone else. Fanni knew I adored her, but when Victoria married and took her with her, no one dared to oppose her]. She also stated that she began to hate socializing once Clara died.

In 1908, Ocampo traveled to Europe for the first time with her family. Later she studied drawing in Paris with Giorgio de Chirico and Fernand Léger. Among her friends was the Italian writer Italo Calvino, who prefaced her stories. Back in Buenos Aires, she worked on painting with Norah Borges and María Rosa Oliver. She held various exhibitions, both individual and collective. When Victoria founded the magazine &quot;Sur&quot; in 1931, which published articles and texts by many important writers, philosophers, and intellectuals of the 20th century, Ocampo was part of the founding group. However, like Borges and Bioy Casares, she did not have a prominent role in the decisions about the content to be published, which was a task performed by Victoria and José Bianco.

In 1934, Ocampo met her future husband, the Argentine author Adolfo Bioy Casares. They married in 1940. The relationship between the two was complex, and Bioy openly had lovers. Some authors have described Ocampo as a victim, but others, such as Ernesto Montequin, have rejected this portrait: &quot;Eso la pone en un lugar de minusválida. La relación con Bioy fue muy compleja; ella tuvo una vida amorosa bastante plena [. . .] La relación con Bioy podía hacerla sufrir, pero también la inspiraba&quot; [That puts her in a handicapped place. The relationship with Bioy was very complex; she had a fairly full love life [. . . ] The relationship with Bioy Casares could make her suffer, but it also inspired her].

Ocampo and Bioy remained together until her death, despite her husband&#x27;s frequent infidelities. In 1954, Bioy&#x27;s extramarital daughter, Marta, was born. Ocampo adopted Marta and raised her as her own. Marta Bioy Ocampo died in an automobile accident shortly after Ocampo&#x27;s own death. Bioy Casares&#x27;s son by another mistress, Fabián Bioy, later won a lawsuit for the right to the estates of Ocampo and Bioy Casares; Fabián Bioy died in 2006.

== Career and literary works ==
Ocampo began her career as a short story writer in 1936. Ocampo published her first book of short stories, &quot;Viaje olvidado,&quot; in 1937, followed by three books of poetry: &quot;Enumeración de la patria&quot;, &quot;Espacios métricos,&quot; and &quot;Los sonetos del jardín&quot;. She was a prolific writer, producing more than 175 pieces of fiction during one forty-year period.

Ocampo frequently collaborated with other writers. She wrote &quot;Los que aman, odian&quot; (&quot;Those Who Love, Hate&quot;) with Bioy Casares in 1946, and with J. R. Wilcock she published the theatrical work &quot;Los Traidores&quot; in 1956. With Borges and Bioy Casares, Ocampo co-authored the celebrated &quot;Antología de la literatura fantástica&quot; in 1940, and also the &quot;Antología poética Argentina&quot; in 1941.

Before turning to writing, Ocampo had studied painting in Paris under the cubist Fernand Léger and proto-surrealist Giorgio de Chirico. Ocampo did not abandon her artistic training; she produced illustrations for Borges&#x27; poetry and painted throughout her life. Borges perceived a connection between Ocampo&#x27;s painting and poetry, writing that &quot;like Rosetti and Blake, Silvina has come to poetry by the luminous paths of drawing and painting, and the immediacy and certainty of the visual image persist in her written pages.&quot;

Unpublished works by Ocampo are part of the Silvina Ocampo Collection at the University of Notre Dame.

Ocampo was awarded Argentina&#x27;s National Prize for Poetry in 1962, among other literary awards.

=== First publications ===
Ocampo published her first book of short stories, &quot;Viaje olvidado,&quot; in 1937. Most of the stories do not exceed two pages in length. The book was reviewed by Victoria Ocampo in &quot;Sur&quot;, where she remarked on the autobiographical aspects of the stories and reproached her sister for having &quot;distorted&quot; those childhood memories. &quot;Sur&quot; played a foundational role in the life of Ocampo, facilitating her connections with Borges, Bioy, Wilcock, and others in her circle. It was in this magazine where the first stories, poems, and translations of Ocampo appeared.

Despite the initial negative reviews of &quot;Viaje olvidado&quot;, the book came to be considered a fundamental text within the writer&#x27;s collection of works, introducing readers to the features and themes that would characterize her future works. A few years later, Ocampo collaborated with Borges and Bioy Casares in the preparation of two anthologies: &quot;Antología de la literatura fantástica&quot; (1940), with a prologue by Bioy, and &quot;Antología poética Argentina&quot; (1941). In 1942, she introduced her first two books of poetry, &quot;Enumeración de la Patria&quot; and &quot;Espacios métricos&quot;. From then on, she alternated writing narratives with poetry.

In 1948, she published &quot;Autobiografía de Irene&quot;, stories where she shows a greater fluency in writing and a greater influence of Borges and Bioy appears. Despite this, the book did not have much impact at the time of its appearance. Two years earlier she had written a crime novel with Bioy Casares, &quot;Los que aman, odian&quot;.

After several years of publishing only poetry &quot;(Los sonetos del jardín&quot;, &quot;Poemas de amor desesperado&quot;, &quot;Los nombres&quot;, which won the National Poetry Prize) she returned to writing stories in 1959 with &quot;La furia&quot;, with which she finally obtained some recognition. &quot;La furia&quot; is often considered the point in which Ocampo reached the fullness of her style.

=== The 1960s and 70s ===
Ocampo was somewhat less active in terms of editorial presence in the 1960s, as she only published the volume of short stories, &quot;Las invitadas&quot; (1961), and the poetry book, &quot;Lo amargo por dulce&quot; (1962). In contrast, she was somewhat more fruitful during the 1970s. During these years, Ocampo published the poems &quot;Amarillo celeste&quot;, &quot;Árboles de Buenos Aires&quot;, and &quot;Canto escolar&quot;. She also published the story &quot;Los días de la noche&quot; and a series of children&#x27;s stories: &quot;El cofre volante&quot;, &quot;El tobogán&quot;, &quot;El caballo alado&quot;, and &quot;La naranja maravillosa&quot;.

=== Last years and posthumous publications ===
The publication of her last two books, &quot;Y así sucesivamente&quot; (1987) and &quot;Cornelia frente al espejo&quot; (1988), coincided with her onset of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The illness gradually reduced her faculties until leaving her debilitated during her last three years. She died in Buenos Aires on 14 December 1993, at the age of 90. She was buried in the family crypt of the Recoleta Cemetery, a cemetery where Bioy Casares is also buried.

Volumes of her unpublished texts appeared posthumously, including poetry and short novels. In 2006, four of her works were published: &quot;Invenciones del recuerdo&quot; (an autobiography written in free verse), &quot;Las repeticiones&quot; (a collection of unpublished short stories that includes two short novels), &quot;El vidente&quot;, and &quot;Lo mejor de la familia&quot;. In 2007, the novel &quot;La torre&quot; &quot;sin fin&quot; was published for the first time in Argentina, and in 2008, &quot;Ejércitos de la oscuridad&quot; appeared, a volume that includes various texts. All the material was edited by Sudamericana, which also reissued some of her short story collections. In 2011, &quot;La promesa&quot; was published, a novel that Ocampo began around 1963 and that, with long interruptions and rewrites, finished between 1988 and 1989, pressured by her illness. The edition was in the care of Ernesto Montequin.

== Critical reception ==
For most of her career, Argentine critics did not recognize the merit of Ocampo&#x27;s works. Due to some extent to her relationship with Borges, her stories were criticized as not being &quot;Borgesian enough.&quot; It was the veneration of Borges and her sister Victoria that prevented critics from understanding the formal and thematic originality of her stories. Instead, they saw them as a failure in their attempt to copy the style of these other writers. It was only in the 1980s that critics and writers began to recognize her talent and write about her legacy. Eminent representatives of &quot;Sur&quot; attempted to rescue Ocampo&#x27;s short story collection, including Joseph Bianco, Sylvia Molloy, and Enrique Pezzoni.

Ocampo has been described as a shy woman who refused interviews and preferred a low profile. Critics wanted a firm statement about her position with respect to the &quot;literary norm&quot; so that they would know how to read her works and ensure that they were properly interpreting them, but they were unable to receive such a statement. In an interview with María Moreno—one of the few interviews Ocampo gave—Ocampo explained why she did not like to give interviews: &quot;Tal vez porque protagonizo en ellas el triunfo del periodismo sobre la literatura” [Perhaps because I represent the triumph of journalism over literature in them].The only requirement that Ocampo put in order to be interviewed was that none of the questions be about literature. The only thing she said about the matter was the following: &quot;Escribo porque no me gusta hablar, para dejar un testimonio más de la vida o para luchar contra ese exceso de materia que acostumbra a rodearnos. Pero si lo medito un poco, diré algo más banal&quot; [I write because I don&#x27;t like to talk, to leave one more testimony of life or to fight against that excess of matter that usually surrounds us. But if I ponder it a little, I&#x27;ll say something else more banal].

Ocampo&#x27;s habit of refusing to say much about her private life, methodology, and literature makes it difficult for critics to develop an analysis of her intentions. For Judith Podlubne, Ocampo&#x27;s works are meta-literary. She says that the lack of information about where the writer comes from results in a dependence on literary norms. Sylvia Molloy suggests that criticism tries to reduce originality to something known, &quot;reading what is read&quot; instead of reading Ocampo&#x27;s stories in their originality.

In recent years, critics have rediscovered Ocampo, and some unpublished works have been published in compilations such as &quot;Las repetitions y otros cuentos&quot; (2006) and &quot;Ejércitos de la oscuridad&quot; (2008).

=== Feminism ===
Because Ocampo has rarely had a direct say on feminist issues, it is not clear whether or not she considered herself a feminist. Depending on their interpretation of her works, critics have taken varying positions. Due to her association with Simone de Beauvoir through her sister Victoria, Amícola deduces that Ocampo was a feminist of the French and English tradition. Amícola states that it is evident that the Ocampo sisters were sensitive to the changes that were announced from France (and England) for the feminine question and, therefore, it is not inconsistent to try to think of Silvina Ocampo&#x27;s stories as a special reading and putting into discourse what women perceive in the world.

Carolina Suárez-Hernán considers that Ocampo is a feminist or at least works from feminist angles. Suárez-Hernán bases her opinion on the context of Ocampo&#x27;s literature, stating that Ocampo&#x27;s literature contains a deep reflection on femininity and numerous demands for women&#x27;s rights, as well as a critique of her situation in society. Ocampo finds different mechanisms of creation and deconstruction of the feminine. The women in her works are complex and present the dark side of femininity, and the multiple female representations shows an ambiguity that challenges the one-dimensional vision of the female character.

From three stories—&quot;Cielo de claraboyas&quot; (1937), &quot;El vestido de terciopelo&quot; (1959), y &quot;La muñeca&quot; (1970)—Amícola suggests that Ocampo&#x27;s tales question the absence of sex-gender and of the feminine vision in psychoanalysis developed by Freud, with a special focus on the horrifying. Amícola does what Ocampo does not understand about the critics; she focuses too much on the horror of her stories and ignores the humor. Ocampo told Moreno her frustration: &quot;Con mi prosa puedo hacer reír. ¿Será una ilusión? Nunca, ninguna crítica menciona mi humorismo&quot; [With my prose I can make people laugh. Will it be an illusion? No critic ever mentions my humor].

In contrast, Suárez-Hernán proposes that the humor used in Ocampo&#x27;s work helps to subvert female stereotypes. For Suárez-Hernán, Ocampo&#x27;s work maintains a subversive and critical stance that finds pleasure in transgression. Established patterns are broken and roles are interchangeable; stereotypical oppositions of femininity and masculinity, good and evil, and beauty and ugliness are subjected to satirical treatment. Likewise, space and time are subverted and the boundaries between the mental categories of space, time, person, and animal are blurred.

When María Moreno asked her what she thought about feminism, Ocampo replied: &quot;Mi opinión es un aplauso que me hace doler las manos&quot; [My opinion is a round of applause that makes my hands hurt]. &quot;¿Un aplauso que le molesta dispensar?&quot; [An applause that bothers you to give?], questioned Moreno. &quot;¡Por qué no se va al diablo!&quot; [Why don&#x27;t you go to hell!] was Ocampo&#x27;s reply. Regarding the female vote in Argentina, Ocampo said, &quot;Confieso que no me acuerdo. Me pareció tan natural, tan evidente, tan justo, que no juzgué que requería una actitud especial&quot; [I confess that I do not remember. It seemed so natural, so evident, so fair, that I did not consider it required a special attitude].

=== Childhood and adulthood ===
Amícola suggests that Ocampo&#x27;s intention is to create child characters that aim to demystify the idea of infantile innocence. Amícola proposes the example of confronting children versus adults to create a polarization. Suárez-Hernán also suggests that the children&#x27;s narrative voice becomes a strategy to generate the ambiguity that is a part of the unreliable narrator; the reader always harbors doubts about the narrator&#x27;s understanding of the facts as well as their credibility.

For Suárez-Hernán, the stories show the asymmetry between the world of adults and the world of children; parents, teachers, and governesses embody the sanctioning institution and are often nefarious figures. Suárez-Hernán considers that women, children, and the poor in Ocampo&#x27;s work act in a subordinate position dominated by stereotypes. According to Suárez-Hernán, the world of childhood is privileged over adulthood as an appropriate space to subvert social structures; thus, the child&#x27;s gaze will be the instrument to undermine the structural bases and transgress established limits. However, Suárez-Hernán believes that the powers attributed to the girl and her perversity generate disturbance in the reader who cannot avoid identifying with the adult woman.

== Themes ==
Ocampo&#x27;s work has fantastical qualities, like her contemporary Borges. Critics note that Ocampo&#x27;s writing particularly focused on transformations, such as metamorphosis, doubling, splitting, and fragmenting of the self.

Critic Cynthia Duncan, from the University of Tennessee, contends that the fantastical elements concealed latent feminist themes:[Ocampo&#x27;s] female characters, like Cristina, are not radical, outspoken feminists. They do not overtly criticize their husbands, nor do they rebel in predictable ways. They go about their lives quietly and submissively, until the fantastic intervenes to upset the traditional order that has been imposed on them. It is, perhaps, this aspect of Silvina Ocampo&#x27;s work which makes it most disquieting to readers, male and female alike.Another critic, Patricia N. Klingenberg, has argued that the &quot;raging, destructive female characters of Ocampo&#x27;s stories should be viewed as part of her preoccupation with the victimization and revenge of women, children and &#x27;deviants&#x27; in her works.&quot;

Ocampo reportedly said that the judges for Argentina&#x27;s National Prize for fiction in 1979 adjudged her work &quot;demasiado crueles&quot;—too cruel—for the award.

=== Reflexivity ===
The theme of reflexivity is present in many of Ocampo&#x27;s works. The concept of reflexivity can be defined, in terms of literal objects, as a representation of &quot; . . . identity and otherness,&quot; and as a link with other texts. In her collection of short stories &quot;La furia&quot;, the repetition of objects such as mirrors, light, glass objects, and clocks is observed. The use of reflected light and the objects that reflect it are found many times throughout the works. Some authors such as María Dolores Rajoy Feijoo interpret these reflective objects, such as mirrors and watches, as vehicles of self-reflexivity, and the modified and reproduced identity, in the fantastic tales of Ocampo: &quot;Instead of seeing the reflected room, I saw something outside in the mirror, a dome, a kind of temple with yellow columns and, deep down, inside some niches in the wall, divinities. I was undoubtedly the victim of an illusion&quot; (Cornelia in front of the mirror).

=== Childhood ===
Childhood is a recurring theme in Ocampo&#x27;s tales. Although the use of the infantile perspective is something in common with other Latin American authors, Ocampo is distinguished by her perversion of the infantile perspective. Childhood&#x27;s sense of perversion has led many critics to make psychological connections between her tales and Freudian theories. According to Fiona Joy Mackintosh, Freud&#x27;s ideas, specifically his ideas about dreams, the taboo, and the polymorphous perversion of children, are some of the key elements that lurk as a ubiquitous harbinger within the lines of text in Ocampo&#x27;s stories. Ocampo also experiments with the consequences of living in a world separated from adult society in &quot;La raza inextinguible,&quot; but she also explores elements involved in the aging process and alludes that there are positive effects implicit in the characters who mix childhood traits with those of adults. One of her most notable works on the theme of childhood perversion is &quot;El pecado mortal,&quot; which recounts the deception of a girl by a servant. Then the girl makes her first communion without confessing her sin. Some critics have interpreted this story as an intercession of the perversion of childhood, the awakening of sexual identity, and the incorporation of various social classes and the subversion of power that these sexual acts entail.

=== Metamorphosis ===
In many of her stories, Ocampo uses physical and psychological changes (characterized as metamorphosis) to transform many of her characters. These include the transition from people to plants (the human-plant hybridism in &quot;Sabanas de Tierra&quot;), into animals (the human-feline hybridism in &quot;El rival&quot;), into machines (the human-inanimate hybridism &quot;El automóvil&quot;), and in other people (for example, &quot;Amado en el amado&quot;).

Ocampo uses gradual changes in her short story &quot;Sabanas de tierra&quot; to highlight the metamorphic process of a gardener in a plant. These changes are typically noted by their transitions in senses and actions, for example, sound, smell, visual changes, and taste. According to Juan Ramón Vélez García, many of these processes of metamorphosis indicate biblical connections in Genesis. Vélez García interprets the transformative features of the characters as a cycle or return, highlighting the biblical phrase &quot;pulvis es et in pulverem reverteris&quot; (Vélez García K.R. 2006). The characters in &quot;Sabanas de tierra&quot; do not have proper names. Ishak Farag Fahim believes that this reflects an attempt to generalize the ideas and worldview that the story seeks to communicate.

== Legacy ==
Ocampo&#x27;s own merit as a writer has been overshadowed by her associations with her sister Victoria Ocampo, her husband Adolfo Bioy Casares, and her friend Jorge Luis Borges. In recent years, however, Ocampo&#x27;s work has been newly translated into English, bringing greater awareness to Ocampo&#x27;s accomplishments as a writer.

Ocampo is buried at La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires.
