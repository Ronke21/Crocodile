<text>Nanyehi (Cherokee: ᎾᏅᏰᎯ), known in English as Nancy Ward (c.1738 – c.1823), was a Beloved Woman and political leader of the Cherokee. She advocated for peaceful coexistence with European Americans and, late in life, spoke out for Cherokee retention of tribal hunting lands. She is credited with the introduction of dairy products to the Cherokee economy.

==Life==
&quot;Nanyehi&quot; (meaning &quot;one who goes about&quot;) was born c. 1738 in the Cherokee chief-city, Chota (or &quot;town of refuge&quot;). Today, that area is within Monroe County, on the southeastern border of Tennessee. Her mother, a sister of Attakullakulla, was a member of the Wolf Clan. According to Nanyehi&#x27;s descendant, John Walker &quot;Jack&quot; Hildebrand, her father was &quot;Fivekiller&quot;, who was a member of the Lenape (Delaware) tribe.

While a young teen, Nanyehi was married to &quot;Tsu-la&quot; (or &quot;Kingfisher&quot;). According to historian Emmet Starr, he was a member of the Deer Clan. By the time she was 17, Nanyehi and Kingfisher had two children, Catherine &quot;Ka-Ti&quot; Walker and Littlefellow &quot;Hiskyteehee&quot; Fivekiller.

In the 1755 Battle of Taliwa, when the Cherokee fought their traditional enemy, the Muscogee (Creek) people, Nanyehi accompanied her husband to the field, located in what is now northern Georgia. She chewed his bullets before he loaded his gun, so that the jagged edges would inflict more damage. After Kingfisher was killed in the battle, Nanyehi picked up his rifle and led the Cherokee warriors to victory.

In the late 1750s, Nanyehi married an Irish trader, Bryant Ward. She became known as Nancy, an anglicized version of her name. The couple had a daughter together, Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Ward, who would one day marry General Joseph Martin. Bryant Ward eventually left her, and returned to his base in South Carolina and his first wife.

===Beloved Woman and diplomat===
For her actions at the Battle of Taliwa, the Cherokee awarded her the title of &quot;Ghigau&quot; (or &quot;Beloved Woman&quot;). This made her the only female voting member of the Cherokee general council. She was also named the leader of the women&#x27;s clan council that authorized her to become an ambassador and negotiator for all her people.

Nanye&#x27;hi became a &quot;de facto&quot; ambassador between the Cherokee and the British and European Americans. She had learned the art of diplomacy from her maternal uncle, the influential chief &quot;Attakullakulla&quot; (&quot;Little Carpenter&quot;). In 1781, she was among the Cherokee leaders who met with an American delegation led by John Sevier, to discuss American settlements along the Little Pigeon River in Tennessee. Nanyehi expressed surprise that there were no women negotiators among the Americans. Sevier was equally astonished that the Cherokee had entrusted such important work to a woman. Nanyehi reportedly told him, 
&quot;You know that women are always looked upon as nothing; but we are your mothers; you are our sons. Our cry is all for peace; let it continue. This peace must last forever. Let your women&#x27;s sons be ours; our sons be yours. Let your women hear our words.&quot;

An American observer said that her speech was very moving.

== Changes to Cherokee society ==
In the early 1760s, the Cherokee entered an alliance with the British colonists who were fighting the French and their allies in the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe). Each side had Native American allies in North America. In exchange for their assistance, the British Americans promised to protect the Cherokee from their enemies: the Creek and Choctaw peoples.

The British built military stations and frontier posts on Cherokee land. These posts gradually attracted more European-American settlers. A group of White frontiersmen killed a group of Cherokee in present-day West Virginia, who were returning from having helped the British take over Fort Duquesne (at present-day Pittsburgh). Outraged, the Cherokee killed more than 20 settlers in retaliation. Conflict broke out that lasted two years, during which the Cherokee captured Fort Loudon on the Tellico River in August 1760.

A decade later, In May 1775, a group of Delaware, Mohawk and Shawnee emissaries formed a delegation that headed south to support the British who were trying to gain the help of the Cherokee and other tribes for war with their rebel colonies.

== Revolutionary War years ==
The Cherokee had to face multiple issues during the Revolutionary War. Most of the tribes were originally allied with the British against the rebel colonists. They wanted to expel the European-American settlers from their lands. Ward&#x27;s cousin, the war chief, Dragging Canoe, wanted to ally with the British against the settlers, but Nanyehi wanted to keep peace with the rebels. In early July 1776, Ward, warned a group of white settlers living near the Holston River and on the Virginia border about an imminent attack by her people. In late July 1776, Dragging Canoe, Oconostota, and The Raven led a surprise attack on the Overmountain settlements of Heaton&#x27;s station, Fort Watauga, and Carter&#x27;s Valley, respectively. After being beaten back by the frontiersmen, Cherokee raiding parties continued attacks against the isolated settlements in the region. State militias retaliated, destroying Native villages and crops. The Carolina Light Horse Rangers and Virginia Royal Scots formed a punitive expedition against Cherokee settlements in Fall of that year, that burnt most of the Overhill Cherokee towns, crops, and winter supplies. Devastated, the Cherokee sought peace in January 1777, and gave up hunting grounds in east Tennessee to the American frontiersmen.

===Captive rescue===
In her role as a Beloved Woman, Nancy Ward had the authority to spare captives. Following the Cherokee attacks on the Watauga settlements, she saved settler Lydia (Russell) Bean, the wife of William Bean, at what is present day&#x27;s Elizabethton, Tennessee. She took Bean into her house and nursed her back to health from her wounds. A recovered Bean taught Nanyehi a new loom-weaving technique, which she then taught other women in the tribe. The Cherokee women had typically made garments by sewing a combination of processed hides, handwoven vegetal fiber cloth, and cotton or wool cloth bought from traders. Women wove all the cloth in the village for tribal members&#x27; garments.

Lydia Bean had reclaimed two of her dairy cows from the settlement. While she was living with Nanyehi, she taught the Cherokee woman how to care for the cows, milk them, and process the milk into dairy products. Both the animals and their products would sustain the Cherokee when hunting was bad. Starr wrote that Nancy Ward successfully raised cows and was said to have been the first to introduce that industry among the Cherokees. Those Cherokee who adopted loom weaving and dairy farming began to resemble European-American subsistence farmers. According to a 1933 account, Nanyehi was also among the first Cherokees to own African-American slaves.

===Cherokee–American War years===
With the signing of the Treaty of Dewitt&#x27;s Corner in early 1777, Dragging Canoe, whose lone counsel to continue the war against the frontier settlements had been dismissed, left the area of the traditional Cherokee towns with many like-minded warriors and their families. The group traveled further down the Tennessee River valley, away from the White men. He and about 500 Cherokee settled 11 new tribal towns centered on the convergence of the Tennessee River with South Chickamauga Creek. This band was thereafter known as the Chickamauga (or Lower) Cherokee.

Ward&#x27;s peace efforts had not prevented another invasion of the Cherokee territory by the North Carolina militia in 1778. The force under Evan Shelby destroyed more villages and demanded further land cessions. Ward and her family were captured in the battle, but they were eventually released and returned to Chota. In 1780, Ward continued to warn Patriot soldiers of attacks, in an effort to prevent further retaliatory raids against her people. According to folklorist, Harold Felton, she even sent cattle to the starving militia. In July 1781, Nanyehi negotiated a peace treaty between her people and the Americans. No longer facing a major Cherokee threat along the western frontier, the Overmountain Men were able to send a considerable amount of man power to support the eastern seaboard militias and Washington&#x27;s Continental army against British General Cornwallis&#x27; forces in the American Revolution.

Ward continued promoting alliance and mutual friendship between the Cherokee and the Americans, helping negotiate the Cherokee Treaty of Hopewell (1785). Nanyehi objected to further sales of Cherokee lands to whites, but her objections were largely ignored. The Cherokee were under pressure in Georgia and Alabama from encroachment by White settlers. Some leaders believed that ceding lands bought them some time and helped preserve the Cherokee people. The Chickamauga, however, continued their relentless fight against frontier settlers up to the 1794 establishment of the Cherokee Nation.

==Later life==
In 1808 and again in 1817, the Women&#x27;s Council reportedly spoke out against the cession or sale to the United States of any more lands. In 1817 Nanyehi was too sick to attend the Cherokee council at which leaders discussed whether or not to move west of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory, as was proposed by Georgia and the US federal government. She sent a letter to the council, writing: 
&quot;…don&#x27;t part with any more of our lands but continue on it and enlarge your farms and cultivate and raise corn and cotton and we, your mothers and sisters, will make clothing for you… It was our desire to forewarn you all not to part with our lands.&quot;

Despite her efforts, in 1819 the Cherokee ceded their lands north of the Hiwassee River and she was forced to join other Cherokee in moving south.

Nancy Ward opened an inn in southeastern Tennessee at Womankiller Ford, on the Ocowee River (present-day Ocoee River). Her son cared for her during her last years.

==Death==
Ward died 1822 – 1824, before the Cherokee were removed from their remaining lands. She and her son, Fivekiller, are buried at the Nancy Ward Tomb, on top of a hill not far from the site of the inn, south of present-day Benton, Tennessee.

==Legacy==
*Cherokee oral history tells that in her last years Nanyehi repeatedly had a vision showing a &quot;great line of our people marching on foot. Mothers with babies in their arms. Fathers with small children on their back. Grandmothers and Grandfathers with large bundles on their backs. They were marching West and the &#x27;Unaka&#x27; (White Soldiers) were behind them. They left a trail of corpses the weak, the sick who could not survive the journey.&quot;
*A chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Tennessee was named after her.
*In 1923 the Nancy Ward chapter of the DAR, based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, placed a memorial marker at the two Ward grave sites in Benton. 
*The Polk County Historical and Genealogical Society maintains a Nancy Ward Room in their genealogy library.
*Polk County, Tennessee is trying to raise money to establish a Nancy Ward Museum. 
*Nanyehi has been documented in historical papers and accounts. She is noted in the Calendar of Virginia State Papers, the South Carolina State Papers, &quot;James Mooney&#x27;s History, Myths, and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees&quot;, and the Draper Collection. 
*Theodore Roosevelt mentions her in his book, &quot;The Winning of the West&quot; (1905).
*A statue of Nancy Ward, carved by James Abraham Walker around 1906, was sold in 1912. It stood in a cemetery in Grainger County, Tennessee for about 70 years, but was stolen in the early 1980s.
*In 2024, an episode of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; revealed that Cherokee actor Wes Studi is her direct descendant, his sixth great grandmother.

<doc id="1010051" wikidata="Q1327022" url="?curid=1010051" title="Culture of Spain">
<text>The culture of [[Spain]] is influenced by its Western origin, its interaction with other cultures in Europe, its historically Catholic religious tradition, and the varied national and regional identities within the country. It encompasses literature, music, visual arts, cuisine as well as contemporary customs, beliefs, institutions, and social norms. Beyond Spain, Spanish culture is the foundation of most of Latin American cultures and the Filipino culture. 

==History==
The ancient peoples of Spain included Celts, Iberians, Celtiberians, Tartessians, Vascones, as well as Phoenician, Greek and Carthaginian colonies. From an early age, It was entirely conquered by Rome, becoming a province of the Roman Empire (Hispania). The ancient Romans left a lasting cultural, religious, political, legal and administrative legacy in Spanish history, being today the cultural basis of modern Spain. The subsequent course of Spanish history added new elements to the country&#x27;s culture and traditions.

The Visgoths established a united Hispania and kept the Latin and Christian legacy in Spain between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages. Muslim influences played a significant role during the Early Middle Ages in the areas conquered by the Umayyads. However, these influences were not completely assimilated into the Spanish culture, leading to conflicts and ultimately to the Christian &quot;Reconquista&quot; (&quot;Reconquest&quot;) that would largely shape the culture of the country. After the definitive defeat of the Muslims during the Reconquista in 1492, Spain became again an entirely unified Roman Catholic country. In addition, the nation&#x27;s history and its Mediterranean and Atlantic environment have played a significant role in shaping its culture, and also in shaping other cultures, such as the culture of Latin America through the colonization of the Americas. 

, around 85% of modern Spanish language is derived from Latin. Ancient Greek has also contributed substantially to Spanish vocabulary, especially through Latin, where it had a great impact. Spanish vocabulary has been in contact from an early date with Arabic, having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula with around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin and minor influences but not least from other languages including Basque, Celtic and Gothic.

Spain has one of the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world.

==Literature==
The term &quot;Spanish literature&quot; refers to literature written in the Spanish language, including literature composed by Spanish and Latin American writers. It may include Spanish poetry, prose, and novels.

Spanish literature is the name given to the literary works written in Spain throughout time, and those by Spanish authors worldwide. Due to historic, geographic, and generational diversity, Spanish literature has a great number of influences and is very diverse. Some major movements can be identified within it.

Highlights include the Cantar de Mio Cid, the oldest preserved Spanish cantar de gesta. It is written in medieval Spanish, the ancestor of modern Spanish.

&quot;La Celestina&quot; is a book published anonymously by Fernando de Rojas in 1499. This book is considered to be one of the greatest in Spanish literature, and traditionally marks the end of medieval literature and the beginning of the literary renaissance in Spain.

Besides its importance in the Spanish literature of the Golden Centuries, Lazarillo de Tormes is credited with founding a literary genre, the picaresque novel, so called from Spanish &quot;pícaro&quot;, meaning &quot;rogue&quot; or &quot;rascal&quot;. In these novels, the adventures of the &quot;pícaro&quot; expose injustice while simultaneously amusing the reader.

Published by Miguel de Cervantes in two volumes a decade apart, Don Quixote is the most influential work of literature to emerge from the Spanish Golden Age and perhaps the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature, it regularly appears at or near the top of lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published.

==Painting and sculpture==

Spain&#x27;s greatest painters during the Spanish Golden Age period included El Greco, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, Diego Velázquez, and Francisco Goya, who became world-renowned artists between the period of the 17th century to 19th century also in early parts of the 20th century. However, Spain&#x27;s best known artist since the 20th century has been Pablo Picasso, who is known for his abstract sculptures, drawings, graphics, and ceramics in addition to his paintings. Other leading artists include Salvador Dalí, Juan Gris, Joan Miró, and Antoni Tàpies.

==Architecture==

During the Prehistoric period, the megalithic Iberian and Celtic architectures developed. Through the Roman period, both urban development (ex. the Emerita Augusta) and construction projects ( the Aqueduct of Segovia) flourished. After the pre-Romanesque period, in the architecture of Al-Andalus, important contributions were made by the Caliphate of Córdoba (the Great Mosque of Córdoba), the Taifas (Aljafería, in Zaragoza), the Almoravids and Almohads (La Giralda, Seville), and the Nasrid of the Kingdom of Granada (Alhambra, Generalife).

Later, several currents appear: Mudéjar (the Alcázar of Seville), the Romanesque period (the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela), the Gothic period (the Cathedrals of Burgos, León and Toledo), the Renaissance (Palace of Charles V in Granada), the Baroque period (Granada Cathedral), the Spanish colonial architecture, and Neoclassical style (ex. the Museo del Prado) are the most significant. In the 19th century eclecticism and regionalism, the Neo-Mudéjar style and glass architecture bloom. In the 20th century, the Catalan Modernisme (La Sagrada Família by Gaudí), modernist architecture, and contemporary architecture germinated.

==Cinema==

In recent years, Spanish cinema, including within Spain and Spanish filmmakers abroad, has achieved high marks of recognition as a result of its creative and technical excellence. In the long history of Spanish cinema, the great filmmaker Luis Buñuel was the first to achieve universal recognition, followed by Pedro Almodóvar in the 1980s. Spanish cinema has also seen international success over the years with films by directors like Segundo de Chomón, Florián Rey, Luis García Berlanga, Carlos Saura, Julio Medem and Alejandro Amenábar. Woody Allen, upon receiving the prestigious Prince of Asturias Award in 2002 in Oviedo remarked: &quot;when I left New York, the most exciting film in the city at the time was Spanish, Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s one. I hope that Europeans will continue to lead the way in filmmaking because at the moment not much is coming from the United States.&quot;

Non-directors have obtained less international notability. Only the cinematographer Néstor Almendros, the actress Penélope Cruz and the actors Fernando Rey, Antonio Banderas, Javier Bardem and Fernando Fernán Gómez have obtained some recognition outside of Spain. Mexican actor Gael García Bernal has also recently received international attention in films by Spanish directors.

Today, only 10 to 20% of box office receipts in Spain are generated by domestic films, a situation that repeats itself in many nations of Europe and the Americas. The Spanish government has therefore implemented various measures aimed at supporting local film production and movie theaters, which include the assurance of funding from the main national television stations. The trend is being reversed with the recent screening of mega productions such as the €30 million film Alatriste (starring Viggo Mortensen), the Academy Award-winning Spanish/Mexican film Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth (El Laberinto del Fauno), Volver (starring Penélope Cruz), and Los Borgia (€10 million), all of them hit blockbusters in Spain.

Another aspect of Spanish cinema mostly unknown to the general public is the appearance of English-language Spanish films such as The Machinist (starring Christian Bale), The Others (starring Nicole Kidman), Basic Instinct 2 (starring Sharon Stone), and Miloš Forman&#x27;s Goya&#x27;s Ghosts (starring Javier Bardem and Natalie Portman). All of these films were produced by Spanish firms.

==Languages==

Spain is a multilingual country with a relatively complex sociolinguistic situation. According to the article 3 of the 1978 Constitution, Spanish is the official language of the State, while other languages may also be official in autonomous communities according to the latter&#x27;s regional statutes, as it is the case with Catalan/Valencian, Basque and Galician. Spanish, a Romance language, has become the hegemonic language in Spain. It has also become a global language (with the majority of its speakers now located outside of Spain, most of them in Latin America) and one of six official languages of the United Nations. Its current hegemony in Spain is subtly fostered by neoliberal discourses on educational choice, flexibility and competition.

Another Romance language, Catalan is a co-official language in the autonomous communities of the Balearic Islands, Catalonia and the Valencian Community (where it is known as Valencian). It is also spoken in parts of the autonomous communities of Aragon (in La Franja) and Murcia (in El Carche). While most of the native speakers of Catalan are located in Spain, the language is also natively spoken in the microstate of Andorra and parts of Italy (Alghero) and France (Roussillon). Galician is a language of the Western Ibero-Romance branch closely related to Portuguese, spoken in the autonomous community of Galicia (where it enjoys co-officiality along Spanish) and small areas in neighbouring Asturias and Castile and León.

Aranese, a standardized form of the Pyrenean Gascon variety of the Occitan language, is spoken in the Val d&#x27;Aran in northwestern Catalonia together with Spanish and Catalan, enjoying official recognition. Other Romance languages of Spain include, Astur-Leonese, Aragonese, Extremaduran, Fala language and Quinqui jargon. Caló language, considered a mixed Romani-Romance language, is spoken by a number of Spanish Romani.

Considered to be a language isolate relative to any other known living language, Basque is a non-Indoeuropean language co-official together with Spanish in the Basque autonomous community and in the northern part of Navarre.

Regarding the Spanish autonomous cities in North Africa, the largely rural variety of vernacular Moroccan &quot;Darija&quot; Arabic characteristic of Jbala is spoken together with Spanish in Ceuta, whereas tamazight is spoken in Melilla in addition to Spanish.

==Religion==
About 56% of Spaniards identify as belonging to the Roman Catholic religion; 3% identify with another religious faith, and about 39% as non-religious.

==Holidays==
An important Spanish holiday is &quot;Semana Santa&quot; (Holy Week), celebrated the week before Easter with large parades and other religious events. Spaniards also hold patronal festivals to honor their local saints in churches, cities, towns and villages. The people decorate the streets, build bonfires, set off fireworks and hold large parades, bullfights, and beauty contests.

One of the best-known Spanish celebrations is the &quot;festival of San Fermin,&quot; which is celebrated every year in July in Pamplona. Bulls are released into the streets, while people run ahead of the animals to the bullring.

==Sports==

Association football is the most popular sport in Spain, with notable teams including Real Madrid and Barcelona, who rank amongst the most successful and prestigious clubs in world football. Other notable Spanish clubs include Atlético Madrid, Sevilla, Athletic Bilbao and Valencia CF. The top division of Spanish football, La Liga, has featured several of the most outstanding players of all time, such as Johan Cruyff, Diego Maradona, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, the latter two often being featured in debates concerning the greatest player ever. The Spain national football team have won three UEFA European Championship titles and the FIFA World Cup in 2010. Spain is one of only eight countries ever to have won the FIFA World Cup, doing so in South Africa in 2010, the first time the team had reached the final.

==Cuisine==
A significant portion of Spanish cuisine derives from the Roman tradition. The Moorish people were a strong influence in a part of Spain for many centuries. Several ingredients from the Americas were introduced to Europe through Spain during the so-called Columbian exchange, and a modern Spanish cook could not do without potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, and beans. These are some of the primary influences that have differentiated Spanish cuisine from Mediterranean cuisine, of which Spanish cuisine shares many techniques and food items.

The essential ingredient for real Spanish cooking is olive oil, as Spain produces 44% of the world&#x27;s olives. However, butter or lard are also important, especially in the north.

Daily meals eaten by Spaniards in many areas of the country are still very often made traditionally by hand, from fresh ingredients bought daily from the local market. This practice is more common in the rural areas and less common in the large urban areas like Barcelona or Madrid, where supermarkets are beginning to displace the open air markets. However, even in Madrid food can be bought from the local shops; bread from the &quot;panadería&quot; and meat from the &quot;carnicería&quot;.

One popular custom when going out is to be served tapas with a drink, including sherry, wine and beer. In some areas, such as Almería, Granada or Jaén in Andalusia, and Madrid, León, Salamanca or Lugo tapas are given for free with a drink and have become very well known for that reason. Almost every bar serves something edible when a drink is ordered, without charge. However many bars exist primarily to serve a purchased &quot;tapa&quot;.

Another traditional favorite is the churro with a mug of thick hot chocolate to dip churros in. &quot;Churrerías,&quot; or stores that serve churros, are quite common. The Chocolatería San Ginés in Madrid is especially famous as a place to stop and have some chocolate with churros, often late into the night (even dawn), after being out on the town. Often traditional Spanish singers and musicians will entertain the guests. 

As is true in many countries, the cuisines of Spain differ widely from one region to another, even though they all share certain common characteristics, which include:
* The use of olive oil as a cooking ingredient in items such as fritters. It is also used raw.
* The use of sofrito to start the preparation of many dishes.
* The use of garlic and onions as major ingredients.
* The custom of drinking wine during meals.
* Serving bread with the vast majority of meals.
* Consumption of salad, especially in the summer.
* The consumption of a piece of fruit or a dairy product as dessert. Desserts such as tarts and cake are typically reserved for special occasions.

==Education==

The Spanish educational system follows a highly decentralized model. In a gradual manner, most powers over education policies were transferred to the autonomous communities. The regional public administrations are thus responsible for education policies, funding and expenditure allocation.

As of 2020, the overarching educative legislation is regulated by the (LOMCE), an organic law.

Relative to the average in European countries, Spain has a low share of students in public centres in both primary (69% of students in public centres) and secondary education (68%). This is largely due to the salient role of the so-called &quot;educación concertada&quot;, which allows for privately owned centres funded by public money.

== Cultural diplomacy ==
The cultural diplomacy of Spain has set European integration and Ibero-American relations among its main goals. It has used branding strategies such as the so-called &quot;&quot;. Since the 1980s, Spain has taken part in a number of &quot;horizontal&quot; initiatives as member of multilateral international organizations of the Ibero-American space such as the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI, which was repurposed in 1985) and the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB).

Similarly to other European countries, Spain has used the model of cultural institute (in the case of Spain the Instituto Cervantes) as leading tool for cultural diplomacy, with common aims such as the dissemination of the country brand, cultural exchange and cooperation, and linguistic and educational promotion.

==Nationalisms and regionalisms==

A strong sense of national identity exists in many autonomous communities. These communities—even those that least identify themselves as Spanish—have contributed greatly to many aspects of mainstream Spanish culture.

Most notably, the Basque Country and Catalonia have widespread nationalist sentiment. Many Basque and Catalan nationalists demand statehood for their respective territories. Basque aspirations to statehood have been a cause of violence (notably by ETA), although most Basque nationalists (like virtually all Catalan nationalists) currently seek to fulfill their aspirations peacefully.

There are also several communities where there is a mild sense of national identity (but a great sense of regional identity): Galicia, Andalusia, Asturias, Navarre (linked to Basque culture), Aragon, Balearic Islands and Valencia (the last two feeling attached to Catalan culture in different ways) each have their own version of nationalism, but generally with a smaller percentage of nationalists than in the Basque Country and Catalonia.

There is some traction in the province of León pushing to separate from Castile and León, possibly together with the provinces of Zamora and Salamanca.

Spain has a long history of tension between centralism and nationalism. The current organisation of the state into autonomous communities (similar to a federal organization) under the Spanish Constitution of 1978 is intended as a way to incorporate these communities into the state.

<text>The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) is a joint United States Navy – United States Air Force command in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The JTWC is responsible for the issuing of tropical cyclone warnings in the North-West Pacific Ocean, South Pacific Ocean, and Indian Ocean for all branches of the U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. government agencies. Their warnings are intended primarily for the protection of U.S. military ships and aircraft, as well as military installations jointly operated with other countries around the world. Its U.S. Navy components are aligned with the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command.

==History==

The origins of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center can be traced back to June 1945, when the Fleet Weather Center/Typhoon Tracking Center was established on the island of Guam, after multiple typhoons, including Typhoon Cobra of December 1944 and Typhoon Connie in June 1945, had caused a significant loss of men and ships. At this time the center was one of three Navy and two Air Force units responsible for tropical cyclone reconnaissance and warnings in the Pacific. Over the next few years the coordination of tropical warnings between the centers was at times difficult or impossible due to various communication problems.

During 1958, the United States Department of Defense weather services and the Weather Bureau formed the Joint Meteorology Committee to the Pacific Command and proposed the formation of a joint Navy and Air Force center for typhoon analysis and forecasting. A committee was subsequently set up to study the issue which issued a report during January 1959, which gave recommendation that the center be set up. Based on the report and the conclusions reached at the March 1959 Annual Tropical Cyclone Conference, the Joint Meteorology Committee formally urged, The Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Command (CINCPAC) to establish a Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The CINCPAC subsequently petitioned the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who gave permission for the center to be set up effective May 1, 1959, under the command of the Fleet Weather Center&#x27;s commander.

The JTWC initially consisted of ten people with two officers and three enlisted personnel provided by each service. It was required to provide warnings on all tropical cyclones between the Malay Peninsula and the International Dateline for U.S. government agencies. They also had to determine reconnaissance requirements, prepare annual typhoon summaries, and conduct research into tropical cyclone forecasting and detection. In November 1962, Typhoon Karen destroyed the building housing the Fleet Weather Center/Joint Typhoon Warning Center. It relocated in a more typhoon-proof building in 1965.

Between 1971 and 1976, CINCPAC gradually expanded out the JTWC&#x27;s area of responsibility, to include the area between the International Dateline and the African coasts. In October 1978, the Fleet Weather Center/JTWC became the Navy Oceanographic Command Center/Joint Typhoon Warning Center and responsible for the whole oceanic environment, from the bottom of the ocean to the top of the atmosphere. The JTWC subsequently started issuing warnings for the Southern Hemisphere between the African coast and the International Dateline during October 1980. It was relocated to Pearl Harbor on January 1, 1999, due to the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission round. During October 2011, the JTWC&#x27;s name changed from the &quot;Naval Maritime Forecast Center/Joint Typhoon Warning Center&quot; to just the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, as it became a stand-alone command for the first time in its 52-year history.

=== Alternate Joint Typhoon Warning Center ===
In case of debilitation of the agency, the Alternative Joint Typhoon Warning Center (AJTWC) assumes JTWC&#x27;s functions. The AJTWC was first designated as the Tokyo Weather Central by the Fleet Weather Facility in Yokosuka, Japan, before eventually being re-designated to Pearl Harbor in November 1977. The first time the AJTWC had to activate was after Typhoon Omar passed above Guam in 1992, incapacitating the JTWC for 11 days. The AJTWC was then relocated back to Yokosuka as part of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission.

==Standards and practices==

The center is staffed by about 61 U.S. Air Force and Navy personnel . The JTWC uses several satellite systems and sensors, radar, surface and upper level synoptic data as well as atmospheric models to complete its mission. A more modernized method for forecasting tropical cyclones had become apparent by the 1980s. Prior to the development of Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System (ATCF), the tools used by the Department of Defense to forecast tropical cyclone track were acetate, grease pencils, and disparate computer programs. The ATCF software was developed by the Naval Research Laboratory for the JTWC beginning in 1986, and used since 1988. It was adapted for use at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in 1990.

JTWC adheres to the World Meteorological Organization&#x27;s (WMO) rules for storm names and adheres to acknowledged guidelines for intensity of tropical cyclones and tropical storms, with the exception of using the U.S. standard of measuring sustained winds for 1-min instead of the 10-min span recommended by the WMO (see Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). The JTWC is not one of the WMO designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres, nor one of its Tropical cyclone warning centers, as its main mission is to support the United States government agencies. JTWC monitors, analyzes, and forecasts tropical cyclone formation, development, and movement year round. Its area of responsibility covers 89% of the world&#x27;s tropical cyclone activity. The way the JTWC labels tropical cyclones vary depending on the location and intensity of the cyclone. A scale is used for systems in the Western Pacific based on the wind speed. Elsewhere of the agency&#x27;s responsibility area, all systems with a wind speed of at least 34 knots (63 km/h) are labeled as &quot;Tropical Cyclone&quot;, regardless of the estimated intensity.

When monitoring disturbances, the agency labels them as an invest (short for investigation area), and numbers them from 90 to 99, followed by a &quot;W&quot; (West Pacific), &quot;B&quot; (Bay of Bengal), &quot;A&quot; (Arabian Sea), &quot;S&quot; (South Indian Ocean), or &quot;P&quot; (South Pacific), based on the location of the system. The numbers are rotated for each time a disturbance forms within a basin, meaning the next invest in the same basin after 99 would be numbered 90.

===Tropical Cyclone Warnings===
A tropical cyclone warning is a text message issued on a tropical cyclone by the JTWC. It contains the storm&#x27;s position and direction, wind speed and the wind distribution, the forecasts of them, and the remarks of the information. Warnings are updated every six hours for the North Pacific and North Indian Ocean (00Z, 06Z, 12Z, 18Z), and are updated every twelve hours for the South Pacific and South Indian Ocean (00Z, 12Z). For a warning to be issued, a storm system must meet one or more of the following criteria:
* It must have a closed circulation and maximum sustained winds of in the North Pacific or in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans.
* Its maximum sustained winds within the close circulation are expected to increase to or greater within 48 hours.
* It may endanger life and/or property within 72 hours.
* USINDOPACOM directs the JTWC to begin warnings
A graphic is produced in each warning in a low-bandwidth image tailored for mariners. Like the National Hurricane Center (NHC), the error cone accounts for basin-specific 5-year average uncertainty in the center location but is expanded to include the size of the storm (in the form of the maximum 34-knot wind radius at each time). For this reason, the JTWC error cone will always be larger than the NHC error cone, provided the tropical cyclone is producing at least 34-knot winds. On the graphic, the shaded zone represents the potential area of tropical storm force winds and is referred to as the avoidance area by Navy ship routing officers. A different graphic may be issued on the &quot;off-hour&quot; tropical cyclone fix cycles (03Z, 09Z, 15Z, 21Z) if a tropical cyclone is within of one of the six designated installations in the Western North Pacific, when one of these installations sets TCCOR 2 or higher on the Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness scale, or when the JTWC is directed by USINDOPACOM.

A warning may be amended whenever a significant change is made to the forecast track, intensity, and/or tropical cyclone best track position before the next regular warning is issued, or it may be corrected due to administrative or typographical errors. Additionally, the JTWC may issue a relocated warning to indicate a significant re-assessment of the tropical cyclone&#x27;s location and movement.

===Prognostic Reasoning===
Prognostic Reasoning Messages are bulletins that accompany a tropical cyclone warning and discuss the tropical cyclone, and are intended to be for meteorologists. They are released at the synoptic time plus three hours (0300Z, 0900Z, 1500Z, or 2100Z), and contain two sections: the 6 hour summary and analysis, and forecast discussion. The former section includes details on the position and intensity of the system, the satellite imagery, the steering mechanism of the system, and the environment the cyclone is in (covering vertical wind shear, sea surface temperature, and outflow) and forecaster assessment, as well as the confidence of the position, intensity, and wind radii. It also compares the Dvorak estimates of agencies. The latter section covers significant changes in forecast (if any) and discusses said forecast and forecast models, and covers the confidence in the forecast. Prior to June 21, 2021, only tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific had their own Prognostic Reasoning Message, and those in the Indian Ocean would have the discussion in the remarks section of warning text messages.

===Significant Tropical Weather Advisory===
Released daily, a Significant Tropical Weather Advisory discusses any tropical disturbances within the JTWC&#x27;s area of responsibility and their potential for further tropical cyclogenesis. Two separate bulletins are issued for the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. The bulletin indicates the chance of becoming a tropical cyclone for each tropical disturbance based on the environment that the disturbance is situated in. The disturbances are categorized as one of the following:
* Low: Unlikely to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within the next 24 hours.
* Medium: Higher potential and may develop into a significant tropical cyclone beyond 24 hours.
* High: Likely to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within the next 24 hours; a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert is issued under this circumstance.

In October 2019, the JTWC modified the bulletin format to include subtropical systems and clarity, stating that the RSMC issues warnings on subtropical systems whereas the JTWC does not.

===Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert===

A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) is issued when an area of disturbed weather (designated an invest) has a high chance to develop into a tropical cyclone within the following 24 hours. It briefly describes the meteorological environment and how it could aid in development of the system. The alert is then accompanied by a graphic depicting the path of the disturbance and a forecast path. The forecast path is depicted as either a rectangle with a centerline—indicating that the invest would follow along the centerline—or a circle around the disturbance&#x27;s current position—indicating uncertainty of its future direction. The necessity of such issuance is based on data gathered on the synoptic scale, and utilizes satellite or other pertinent data. The JTWC follows a checklist to determine whether or not a TCFA should be issued on tropical disturbances. The checklist contains five sections and a miscellaneous section for special cases, covering conditions in the atmosphere starting from the surface to 200 millibar level ( above the surface) as well as sea surface temperatures, while also utilizing the Dvorak technique. If there are a total of at least 35 points, a TCFA shall be issued.

===Annual Tropical Cyclone Report===
An Annual Tropical Cyclone Report (ATCR) is prepared by the staff of the JTWC, describing operationally or
meteorologically significant cyclones that occurred within the JTWC&#x27;s responsibility area. Details highlight significant
challenges and/or shortfalls in the tropical cyclone warning system and serve as a focal point for future research
and development efforts. Also included are tropical cyclone reconnaissance statistics and a summary of
research and development efforts, operational tactics, techniques and procedure development,
and outreach that members of the JTWC conducted or contributed to throughout the year.

<text>Wheeler Peak is the tallest mountain in the Snake Range and in White Pine County, in Nevada, United States. The summit elevation of makes it the second-highest peak in Nevada, just behind Boundary Peak. With a topographic prominence of , Wheeler Peak is the most topographically prominent peak in White Pine County and the second-most prominent peak in Nevada, just behind Mount Charleston. The mountain is located in Great Basin National Park and was named for George Wheeler, leader of the Wheeler Survey of the late 19th century.

==Peak features==
Wheeler Peak has an impressive headwall above a large glacial cirque, large moraines and an active rock glacier. The top of the mountain is covered by deep snow most of the year. A paved road runs from the Great Basin National Park visitor center to several small camping areas, the highest more than halfway up the mountain. The mountain&#x27;s prominence is due to a Miocene detachment fault that brought the deep Cambrian Prospect Mountain quartzite to the top of the mountain.

=== Doso Doyabi ===
Doso Doyabi stands about one mile to the east of Wheeler and reaches with of prominence. In 1854–1855, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Steptoe named what is now Wheeler Peak in honor of Jefferson Davis. Davis was then serving as Secretary of War in the United States government. In 1869, during the Wheeler Survey, it was proposed that the peak be named after George Wheeler. Wheeler states that the idea was abandoned when it was learned that in 1859 James H. Simpson had suggested naming the peak &quot;Union&quot;, though the Wheeler name was later used for the primary peak.
In January 2019 the Nevada State Board on Geographic Names approved changing the name of Jeff Davis Peak to Doso Doyabi, which means White Mountain in Shoshone;
later that year, the change was approved by the United States Board on Geographic Names.

==Climate==
== Access ==
A well-maintained trail, the Wheeler Peak Summit Trail, leads from a trail-head near the end of Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive directly to the summit, making for a hike. Afternoon storms are likely during the summer.

== Wheeler Peak vs. Boundary Peak ==
The distinction of highest point in Nevada goes to the summit of Boundary Peak, so named because it is just east of the Nevada-California border, at the northern terminus of the White Mountains. Wheeler Peak is, however, the tallest independent mountain in the state since Boundary Peak is considered a subsidiary summit of Montgomery Peak, whose summit is in California. The topographic prominence of Boundary Peak is , which falls under the often used cutoff for an independent peak. Also, Boundary Peak is less than away from its higher neighbor, while Wheeler Peak is over 230 miles from the nearest higher peak.

By contrast the prominence of Wheeler Peak, at , is the twelfth largest in the contiguous United States. It is also the twelfth most topographically isolated summit in the contiguous United States.

== Nearby features ==

The limestone Lehman Caves, at the base of the mountain, feature a large collection of shield formations. Tours of the caves are offered year round by the National Park Service. Higher up on the glacial moraine is a grove of ancient Great Basin Bristlecone Pines of great age. A Bristlecone Pine named Prometheus, which was at least 4,862 years old and the oldest known non-clonal organism, grew here before it was inadvertently cut down in 1964 as part of a research project. Limber Pine, which can live for over 1,000 years, are also found in the area.

<doc id="1010065" wikidata="Q282531" url="?curid=1010065" title="Train (band)">
<text>Train is an American pop rock band from San Francisco that was formed in 1993. As of 2025, the band consists of Pat Monahan (lead vocals), Taylor Locke (guitar, vocals), Hector Maldonado (bass, vocals), Jerry Becker (keyboards, guitar), and Matt Musty (drums).

With a lineup that included original members Monahan, Rob Hotchkiss, Jimmy Stafford, Scott Underwood, and Charlie Colin, the band achieved mainstream success with their debut album &quot;Train&quot;. The album was released in 1998 with the hit &quot;Meet Virginia&quot;. Train&#x27;s 2001 album, &quot;Drops of Jupiter&quot;, contained the lead single &quot;Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)&quot;. The single won two Grammy Awards in 2002, and the album was certified double platinum. Train&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;My Private Nation&quot;, released in 2003, was certified platinum in the United States with the hit &quot;Calling All Angels&quot;. Following the departures of Hotchkiss and Colin, the band released their fourth album, &quot;For Me, It&#x27;s You&quot; in 2006, with Brandon Bush (keyboards) and Johnny Colt (bass). Despite a generally positive reception from critics, the album was commercially unsuccessful. Because of this, Train went on a three-year hiatus from recording any new music.

In late 2009, Train released the album &quot;Save Me, San Francisco&quot;, from which the album&#x27;s three singles—the RIAA 11× platinum-certified international hit &quot;Hey, Soul Sister&quot;, &quot;If It&#x27;s Love&quot; and &quot;Marry Me&quot;—reached numbers 3, 34, and 34, respectively, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album was certified gold by both the RIAA and ARIA. In April 2012, Train released &quot;California 37&quot;. The first single from the album, entitled &quot;Drive By&quot;, reached number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was a Top 10 hit in the UK. This album was followed by &quot;Bulletproof Picasso&quot; (2014), &quot;Christmas in Tahoe&quot; (2015), &quot;Train Does Led Zeppelin II&quot; (2016), and &quot;A Girl, a Bottle, a Boat&quot; (2017). Their album &quot;AM Gold&quot; was released on May 20, 2022.

Train has sold over 10 million albums and 30 million tracks worldwide.

==History==

=== 1993–1997: Formation ===
Following the dissolution of his Led Zeppelin cover band &quot;Rogues Gallery&quot;, singer Pat Monahan left his hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania, in late 1993. He resettled in California and crossed paths with Berklee College of Music alumnus Rob Hotchkiss, who performed in coffee houses and local clubs. The two shared lead vocals, with Hotchkiss on guitar and harmonica, and Monahan playing percussion, including a modified conga attached to a kick-drum pedal. Hotchkiss had been the lead singer for L.A.-based Apostles. After deciding to form a full band, the duo recruited Jimmy Stafford (lead guitarist for The Apostles) on guitar, Charlie Colin on bass, and Scott Underwood on drums, thus solidifying Train&#x27;s lineup in 1994. Train attempted to get signed under Columbia Records in 1996, but were rejected. Subsequently, the band decided to release their first self-titled CD independently. By 1997, they were touring nationally, opening concerts for bands such as Barenaked Ladies, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Cracker and Counting Crows.

=== 1998–2000: &quot;Train&quot; ===
&quot;Train&quot; is the band&#x27;s eponymous debut album. Initially released on Aware/RED, a joint venture with Columbia, A&amp;R executive Tim Devine picked up the record for release on Columbia. The album was released on February 24, 1998, with a different track listing from its independent counterpart. It was self-produced for $25,000, and three singles from the album were released. The first single released, &quot;Meet Virginia&quot;, was sent to adult album alternative radio in March 1998. In 2000, it became a top-20 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 20. The second single, &quot;Free&quot;, was released in July 1998 and experienced success on pop/mainstream rock stations, and the third single was &quot;I Am&quot;, released in 1999. The album brought the band national fame, and was certified platinum by the RIAA. Following the success of the debut album, the band began working on their second album.
===2001–2002: &quot;Drops of Jupiter&quot;===
&quot;Drops of Jupiter&quot;, the band&#x27;s second album, was produced by Brendan O&#x27; Brien, who has also worked with artists such as Pearl Jam, King&#x27;s X, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E-Street Band and Neil Young. Before the release of the second album, the band released the single &quot;Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)&quot;. The song was a massive hit; it entered the Hot 100 on March 10, 2001, and spent 54 weeks on the chart before being relegated to the recurrents chart. The song won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, which was written by Paul Buckmaster, known for his string arrangements for Elton John. (The band reportedly hired Buckmaster expressly to create a sound similar to his arrangement for John&#x27;s &quot;Burn Down The Mission&quot;.)

The album &quot;Drops of Jupiter&quot; was released on March 27, 2001, and became Train&#x27;s first multi-platinum album, with the success of the lead single. The album was Train&#x27;s first top ten album, peaking at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was also a top ten hit in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number eight. &quot;She&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, the second single from &quot;Drops of Jupiter&quot; was a modest success and was featured in the 2001 comedy &quot;The Animal&quot; and the 2003 animated comedy &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;. The album was eventually certified double platinum in the United States and in Canada. It was also certified gold in Australia.

During the &quot;Drops of Jupiter&quot; tour, the band released a live DVD of a sold-out concert in the band&#x27;s hometown of San Francisco at The Warfield. The DVD was titled &quot;Midnight Moon&quot; and featured Train&#x27;s hits from the first two albums among others. The concert was recorded on May 26, 2001.

===2003–2004: &quot;My Private Nation&quot;===

In 2003, Rob Hotchkiss left the band citing creative differences. According to band interviews, he resented being pushed away as a songwriter and decided to leave. Hotchkiss started pursuing a solo career, after having contributed to six of the 11 songs on the (at the time) upcoming album &quot;My Private Nation&quot;. His solo album, the critically acclaimed &quot;Midnight Ghost&quot;, was released in 2004.

The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;My Private Nation&quot;, was released in June 2003 with the lead single &quot;Calling All Angels&quot; becoming Train&#x27;s third top 20 hit. &quot;Calling All Angels&quot; was a major hit on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and has been certified RIAA Gold.

In October 2003, bassist Charlie Colin was forced to leave the band because of substance abuse. According to singer Pat Monahan, Colin was &quot;a mess&quot;. After a live presentation in Oregon, Monahan called an emergency meeting and told the band that &quot;you can have your bass player, or you can have your singer&quot;. He was replaced by Johnny Colt, bass player for the Black Crowes.

In 2004, their non-album song &quot;Ordinary&quot; was featured in the movie &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. In 2007, it was featured again, this time in the NBC series &quot;Heroes&quot;. The music video for &quot;Ordinary&quot; was in rotation on MTV, but the song only charted on the Adult Top 40 Tracks chart. In July 2005, after the song was featured in an advertising campaign for Cingular, the band released &quot;Get to Me&quot; as the final single from &quot;My Private Nation&quot;. &quot;Get to Me&quot; (written by Rob Hotchkiss and Pat Monahan) reached number nine on the Billboard Adult Top 40. Paul Buckmaster returned on &quot;My Private Nation&quot; with string arrangements for the tracks &quot;Lincoln Avenue&quot; and &quot;Your Every Color&quot;. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA.

The album was released on January 31, 2006, and peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200 chart. However, it failed commercially, becoming the first album of the band&#x27;s career to fail to receive an RIAA certification. The album was the band&#x27;s only album to include members Johnny Colt on bass and Brandon Bush playing keyboard.

=== 2006–2008: Hiatus===

On August 11, 2009, Train released their first single in more than three years. Fall Out Boy&#x27;s co-manager Jonathan Daniel helped Train begin their comeback after a couple of off years. The song &quot;Hey, Soul Sister&quot;, from their fifth studio album, &quot;Save Me, San Francisco&quot;, was released on August 11, 2009, while the rest of the album was released about two and a half months later on October 27, 2009. The single was a major success, becoming their second-career top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in its 16th week on the chart, after surging from number 23 to number seven during the week of January 30, 2010, largely because of an 81% increase in digital sales from the previous week. Like their earlier hit &quot;Get to Me&quot;, this song gained further popularity when it was used as the commercial soundtrack to launch Samsung&#x27;s 3D television during the Oscars. It is now their highest-charting single. &quot;Hey, Soul Sister&quot; is also the most played song in Australian radio history, the most downloaded iTunes song of 2010, the best selling single in Columbia Records history, and has been certified RIAA 6 x platinum. The album itself peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

Train&#x27;s second single from the album, &quot;If It&#x27;s Love&quot;, peaked at number 34, making it their most successful secondary single from any record. &quot;If It&#x27;s Love&quot; has been RIAA certified gold. Train released the third single from the record, &quot;Marry Me&quot;, on October 25, 2010. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 95, the first time Train have had three consecutive singles on this chart. The song peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. &quot;Marry Me&quot; was featured on &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; on February 1, 2011. &quot;Marry Me&quot; has been certified RIAA Gold. Train released a Christmas single called &quot;Shake Up Christmas&quot;, which was featured in commercials internationally as part of Coca-Cola&#x27;s Christmas commercial series in 2010. The single charted at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks&quot;. The single also charted at #99 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100. Train&#x27;s single &quot;Save Me, San Francisco&quot; peaked at number 75 on the Billboard Hot 100, at 22 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and 7 on the Adult Pop Songs chart.

=== 2012–2013: &quot;California 37&quot; ===
&quot;Drive By&quot;, the lead single off of Train&#x27;s sixth studio album, was released worldwide on January 10, 2012. It peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as reaching Platinum certifications in Australia New Zealand, and the United States.

On April 13, 2012, Train released their sixth studio album, &quot;California 37&quot;. According to Monahan, much of it was written while the group was touring &quot;Save Me, San Francisco&quot;. &quot;I didn&#x27;t spend 3 months or 5 months writing, I just wrote throughout the course of the last 3 years,&quot; said Monahan. &quot;We have 13 songs that we&#x27;ve recorded and I want to hear every single one of them over and over again.&quot; The album release was preceded by a promotional single of &quot;Feels Good at First&quot; on March 21, for iTunes Store customers who pre-ordered the album. The album debuted at number 10 on the UK Albums Chart, and became their highest-charting album since &quot;Drops of Jupiter&quot; which peaked at number six in 2001. In the United States, &quot;California 37&quot; debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 76,000 copies. It is their fourth top 10 album and their highest-charting album in the US.

Train&#x27;s next single, &quot;50 Ways to Say Goodbye&quot;, was released on June 11, with its &quot;self-deprecating lyrics about the failure in gracefully ending a relationship&quot;, coupled with &quot;slightly tacky mariachi horns&quot;. It peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and charted for 12 weeks. and was certified gold by the RIAA on September 20. For the summer of 2012, Train toured mostly on the east coast of the United States.

In late July, Train demanded that the Family First New Zealand, an organization that opposes same-sex marriage in New Zealand, refrain from the unauthorized use of &quot;Marry Me&quot; from its &quot;Protect Marriage&quot; website.

In November, Train released &quot;Bruises&quot;, a country-oriented duet with Ashley Monroe. The song has also been recorded with different female singers: For Canada, the song was recorded in both English and French with Marilou, and for Australia with Delta Goodrem.

In December, Train released the single, &quot;Mermaid&quot;. The group would later film the song&#x27;s video at the 2013 Pro Bowl in Honolulu.

Train was scheduled to perform at the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s 2013 National Scout Jamboree, along with singer Carly Rae Jepsen. In March 2013, both backed out of performing for the event and cited the controversy over the BSA policy on gays as the reason. Train released a statement saying the band &quot;strongly opposes any kind of policy that questions the equality of any American citizen ... We look forward to participating in the Jamboree this summer, as long as they make the right decision before then&quot;. The Boy Scout Jamboree subsequently brought in Three Doors Down as the headlining band.

Train toured the United States and Canada from July 11 to August 14, 2013, in 25 headlining shows titled Mermaids of Alcatraz Tour. The tour included singer Gavin DeGraw, The Script, Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead. Country music singer Ashley Monroe joined part of the tour, singing &quot;Bruises&quot; and one or two of her songs from her album during Train&#x27;s set.

===2014–2015: &quot;Bulletproof Picasso&quot;===

In November 2013, Train announced plans for a new album to be released in the summer of 2014. On May 5, 2014, guitarist Jimmy Stafford tweeted: &quot;An anagram of the first single from the new @train album is now available! SGIJANNULAEBENEL. Yep.&quot; which fans quickly deciphered and replied &quot;Angel in Blue Jeans&quot;. On June 5, 2014, Scott Underwood posted a message thanking fans for their support as he leaves to pursue writing, producing, and other music-related ventures. He had been in the band for 20 years, and has been replaced by Drew Shoals. At the time of release, the only original members left were Pat Monahan and guitarist Jimmy Stafford. On June 9, 2014, it was announced that the album would be titled &quot;Bulletproof Picasso.&quot; The album is led by the single &quot;Angel in Blue Jeans&quot; written by the Norwegian Duo &quot;Espionage&quot;. It was released the same day as the album&#x27;s announcement. The single peaked at number 79 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and at number 8 on the US Adult Top 40 (&quot;Billboard&quot;). The rest of the album was released on September 12, 2014, in Germany and Australia, September 15, 2014, in France, and September 16, 2014, in the United States.

Although the album peaked high on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and all four of its singles made a spot on the US Adult Top 40 (&quot;Billboard&quot;), none of the singles were subsequent hits, thus making it fail commercially. It also failed to receive an RIAA certification, the band&#x27;s first album since &quot;For Me, It&#x27;s You&quot; to do so.

===2015: &quot;Christmas in Tahoe&quot;===

Gigs included New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and the final date in San Francisco. The sets consisted entirely of Led Zeppelin covers, and featured no regular band material. They also appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on June 10 and played &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Living Loving Maid (She&#x27;s Just A Woman).&quot; The album peaked at number 71 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Luxemburg argues that trade unions, reformist political parties and the expansion of social democracy—while important to the proletariat&#x27;s development of class consciousness—cannot create a socialist society as Eduard Bernstein, among others, argued. Instead, she argues from a historical materialist perspective that capitalism is economically unsustainable and will eventually collapse and that a revolution is necessary to transform capitalism into socialism. The pamphlet was heavily influential in revolutionary socialist circles and along with Luxemburg&#x27;s other work an important precursor to left communist theory.

==Background==
In 1878, Germany&#x27;s chancellor Otto von Bismarck imposed anti-socialist laws. As a result, thousands were arrested and hundreds exiled, political newspapers were closed and all political activity except elections was made illegal. During this period, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) declared itself to be revolutionary and repudiated the parliamentary road to socialism. The SPD&#x27;s platform gave expression to the concerns of the urban working class in Germany and its share of the vote grew from 312,000 in the 1881 federal elections to more than 1.4 million in the 1890 elections.

In 1890, anti-socialist laws were lifted and a wave of strikes and trade union militancy followed. Fearing that the strikes would &quot;scare off&quot; conservative members or that repression might return, SPD leaders renounced the more revolutionary aspects of their program. At the 1891 Erfurt Congress, the party program enshrined Marxism—and the overthrow of capitalism—as the &quot;official&quot; thinking of the SPD, but argued for practical tasks appropriate for a time when revolution was not on the immediate agenda. Leading German socialist Eduard Bernstein was one of the authors of the Erfurt Programme.

Polish-born socialist Rosa Luxemburg moved to Germany in 1898 as the debate over revolution was raging within the SPD. Revolutionary socialists argued that socialism can only be achieved through the self-emancipation of the working class through an act of revolution. On the other side were the reformists, or revisionists, who argued that capitalism had reached a stage in which it was no longer necessary to call for revolution, but that enough reforms could be put into place—more democratic rights, more social welfare programs and so on—that over time would transform capitalism into socialism.

Bernstein advocated for revisionism with a series of articles on the &quot;Problems of Socialism&quot; between 1896–1898 and later a book, &quot;Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie&quot; (&quot;The Prerequisites for Socialism and the Tasks of Social Democracy&quot;), published in 1899. The SPD leadership did not officially support or reject Bernstein&#x27;s views. Revolutionary activist Alexander Parvus responded with a series of vehement criticisms in early 1898 that led the issue into open debate within the party.

==Writing==
Leadership of the efforts by revolutionaries within the SPD to tackle Bernstein&#x27;s views fell to Luxemburg. She responded to Bernstein with two series of articles in Leipziger Volkszeitung in September 1898 and April 1899, which were collected as Part I of &quot;Social Reform or Revolution&quot; in 1899. Part II consisted of a response to Bernstein&#x27;s book. The two parts were first published together in 1908.

==Themes==
While a detailed critique of the thinking of Eduard Bernstein it includes a short critique of marginalism and identifies credit and the stock market as things that will exacerbate capitalism&#x27;s periodic crises—not, as Bernstein had argued, measures that gradually remove the tendency towards crisis.

Luxemburg pointed out that Bernstein was little more than a utopian if he believed that socialism could be reformed into existence, comparing his arguments to those of French utopian Charles Fourier. The importance of trade unions, she argued, is not that they could end bourgeois ownership of capital, but that they are the body by which workers come together and understand that they are part of a class. Through struggles for reforms, they realize their class power. Luxemburg likened union struggles to the &quot;labor of Sisyphus&quot;—the mythical figure who was condemned to push a stone up a hill over and over again. The same applied to reforms won through the ballot box.

In the end, Luxemburg concluded that Bernstein was not simply arguing for a &quot;more realistic&quot; way to socialism, but had thrown out the prospect of socialism: That is why people who pronounce themselves in favour of the method of legislative reform in place and in contradistinction to the conquest of political power and social revolution, do not really choose a more tranquil, calmer and slower road to the same goal, but a different goal. Our program becomes not the realization of socialism, but the reform of capitalism; not the suppression of the wage labor system but the diminution of exploitation, that is, the suppression of the abuses of capitalism instead of suppression of capitalism itself.

Rather than diminish the importance of the struggle for reforms, Luxemburg argued that these struggles are central. &quot;In a word&quot;, she wrote, &quot;democracy is indispensable not because it renders superfluous the conquest of political power by the proletariat but because it renders this conquest of power both necessary and possible&quot;.

==Reception==
The writing and publication of &quot;Social Reform or Revolution&quot; took place against the backdrop of party congresses in 1899, 1901 and 1903. Luxemburg&#x27;s positions won out against Bernstein, with the SPD remaining committed to orthodox Marxism. Karl Kautsky supported Luxemburg&#x27;s position, lending her views great weight both within Germany and internationally.

<text>The 1969 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of Parliament&#x27;s 36th term. It saw the Second National Government headed by Prime Minister Keith Holyoake of the National Party win a fourth consecutive term. This is the most recent election where an incumbent government won a fourth term in office.

==1967 electoral redistribution==
Through an amendment in the Electoral Act in 1965, the number of electorates in the South Island was fixed at 25, an increase of one since the 1962 electoral redistribution. It was accepted that through the more rapid population growth in the North Island, the number of its electorates would continue to increase, and to keep proportionality, three new electorates were allowed for in the 1967 electoral redistribution for the next election. In the North Island, five electorates were newly created (, , , , and ) and one electorate was reconstituted () while three electorates were abolished (, , and ). In the South Island, three electorates were newly created (, , and ) and one electorate was reconstituted () while three electorates were abolished (, , and ). The overall effect of the required changes was highly disruptive to existing electorates, with all but three electorates (, , and ) having their boundaries altered. These changes came into effect with the 1969 election.

The increase to 84 electorates was the first since the 1902 electoral distribution. Due to the fixed number of South Island electorates, the number of North Island electorates has increased in every subsequent election until the introduction of mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) for the , which fixed the number of seats at 120.

===MPs retiring in 1969===
Four National MPs and five Labour MPs intended to retire at the end of the 35th Parliament.

Sir Walter Nash MP for Hutt had announced he would retire at the end of the term in 1969, but he died on 4 June 1968 triggering a by-election instead.

==Election==
The election was held on 29 November. Turnout was 88.94%. The total number of MPs had increased to 84, with at least 3 of the 4 new seats likely Labour seats. 55 and 25 electorates were in the North Island and South Island, respectively, plus the 4 Māori electorates.

==Results==
National pulled off a cliff-hanger victory. National won 45 seats, and Labour won 39 seats, though Labour&#x27;s share of the vote was only 1% behind National. The Social Credit Party lost its only seat in Parliament: Hobson, formerly held by then party leader Vernon Cracknell.

Despite the hopes of a reinvigorated Labour party under Norman Kirk, Labour was overconfident, started too late, and did not win in Auckland. Relations with the Federation of Labour and the unions were not good, and an industrial dispute on the ship &quot;Wainui&quot; cost Labour three Auckland seats according to Kirk. Labour MP Warren Freer personally believed that &quot;had it not been for the seamen&#x27;s strike during the election period, we could have won&quot;.

In , Labour was first on election night but lost when special votes were counted.

<doc id="1010086" wikidata="Q605340" url="?curid=1010086" title="Wari culture">
<text>The Wari () were a Middle Horizon civilization that flourished in the south-central Andes and coastal area of modern-day Peru, from about 500 to 1000 AD.

Wari, as the former capital city was called, is located north-east of the modern city of Ayacucho, Peru. This city was the center of a civilization that covered much of the highlands and coast of modern Peru. The best-preserved remnants, beside the Wari Ruins, are the recently discovered Northern Wari ruins near the city of Chiclayo, and Cerro Baúl in Moquegua. Also well-known are the Wari ruins of Pikillaqta (&quot;Flea Town&quot;), a short distance south-east of Cuzco &quot;en route&quot; to Lake Titicaca.

However, there is still a debate whether the Wari dominated the Central Coast or the polities on the Central Coast were commercial states capable of interacting with the Wari people without being politically dominated by them.

==History==

Archaeological evidence points toward the Wari empire taking control of a number of small villages in Peru&#x27;s Carahuarazo Valley in approximately 600 A.D., during the empire&#x27;s initial expansion. The incursion caused a number of the valley&#x27;s existing villages to be abandoned, with one partially destroyed to make room for a Wari administrative center known as Jincamocco. The Wari introduced terracing agriculture to the area, shifting the staple crops of the valley from tubers to both tubers and maize. Wari storage structures have been found in the area, seemingly &quot;paired&quot; with some of remaining villages&#x27; agricultural sites; these were likely used to store both staple crops. Wari occupation of the Carahuarazo Valley lasted until roughly 800 A.D., leading to the abandonment of most of the valley&#x27;s sites after that time.

Early on, the Wari expanded their territory to include the ancient oracle center of Pachacamac, though it seems to have remained largely autonomous. Later, the Wari became dominant in much of the territory of the earlier Moche and later Chimu cultures. The reason for this expansion has been debated; it is believed to have been driven by religious conversion, the spread of agricultural knowledge (specifically terrace agriculture), or military conquest. Militarism and the associated threat/violence that comes with it has consistently played a part in the expansion and maintenance of ancient empires with Wari being of no exception. Evidence of the violence present in Wari culture is most visible at the city of Conchopata.

As a result of centuries of drought, the Wari culture began to deteriorate around 800 AD. Archeologists have determined that the city of Wari was dramatically depopulated by 1000 AD, although it continued to be occupied by a small number of descendant groups. Buildings in Wari and in other government centers had doorways that were deliberately blocked up, as if the Wari intended to return, someday when the rains returned. By the time this happened, though, the Wari had faded from history. In the meantime, the dwindling residents of the Wari cities ceased all major construction. Archaeological evidence shows significant levels of interpersonal violence, suggesting that warfare and raiding increased amongst rival groups upon the collapse of the Wari state structure. With the collapse of the Wari, the Late Intermediate Period is said to begin.

==Government==

Little is known about the details of the Wari administrative structure, as they did not appear to use a form of written record. Instead, they used a tool called khipu, or &quot;knot record.&quot; Despite being most widely known for its use in Inca accounting, many scholars believe that the earliest use of it as a recording tool happened in Wari.
Archaeologists, however, still rely on homogeneous administrative architecture and evidence of significant social stratification to help better understand the complex sociopolitical hierarchy of Wari.

The discovery in early 2013 of an undisturbed royal tomb, El Castillo de Huarmey, offers new insight into the social and political influence of the Wari during this period. The variety and extent of the burial items accompanying the three royal women indicate a culture with significant material wealth and the power to dominate a significant part of northern coastal Peru for many decades.

Another example of burials helping to establish social stratification is in the city of Conchopata where the remains of more than 200 individuals have been found. This city is located about 10 km from the capital city. Prior to its excavation, the city was believed to be that of potters, but the burials studied instead showed that there were servants, middle-class, elite, and even perhaps low kings or governors occupying the city. Further investigations on a random selection of the burials from the site have shown that 26 percent of both male and female adult crania studied had at least one posterior wound, while only females had been subject to anterior wounds. The different levels of violence based on sex is evidence of some type of systematic hierarchy.

==Architecture==
During its expansion period, the Wari state established architecturally distinctive administrative centers in many of its provinces, but they often did not have formal planning as many other Andean cities did. These centers are clearly different from the architecture of Tiwanaku, which is believed to have been a more federalized state by some scholars (such as John W. Janusek). Wari architecture was most often made of rough fieldstones that had been coated in white plaster. The compounds were usually large, rectangular enclosures with no windows, just a few entries, and the sites had no central place for people to gather for rituals or ceremonies. This is in almost direct contrast with Tiwanaku where there was a more open architectural plan that could easily accommodate multiple people at once. A form of architecture distinctive to Wari was the use of D-shaped structures. These structures were commonly used for temples and were relatively small at only 10 meters.
Using administrative centers like their temples, the Wari greatly influenced the surrounding countryside. Scholars were able to look at the Inca to reconstruct some of the architecture of the Wari. Along the Inca highway system, several Wari provincial sites were found, suggesting that the Wari used a similar road network. They also created new fields with terraced field technology, which the Inca also drew inspiration from.

== Social Life ==

Based on remains from multiple Wari sites, archaeologists have determined that feasts and offerings of food were a powerful driving force in the social life of the Wari. Multiple instances of camelid remains found in the province of Cotocotuyoc point toward the usage of such animals as symbols of social capital, especially because they were uncommon in the area. Some camelid remains were found devoid of cut marks and stacked on top of human bones, leading researchers to think they were intentionally not fully eaten to display the feast&#x27;s host&#x27;s wealth, in a process known as ritual wasteful consumption.

== Religion ==
The Wari worshipped the Staff god, a chief deity in many Andean cultures. Some of the oldest depictions of the Staff god appear on Wari textiles and pottery urns, estimated to be over 3,000 years old. Some scholars believe that the Wari Staff god was a predecessor of the three Incan principle gods, Sun, Moon, and Thunder.

The Wari practiced animal sacrifice. Complete skeletal remains of a young camelid and thirty-two guinea pigs were found buried in a &quot;lineage house&quot; in the city of Conchopata, ten kilometers from the capital city of Wari. The complete nature of the remains, as well as the age of the camelid, point toward the animals being sacrificed at the end of the Ayachuco valley&#x27;s rainy season.

== Art ==

The Wari are particularly known for their textiles, which were well-preserved in desert burials. The standardization of textile motifs serves as artistic evidence of state control over elite art production in the Wari state. Surviving textiles include tapestries, hats and tunics for high-ranking officials. There are between six and nine miles of thread in each tunic, and they often feature highly abstracted versions of typical Andean artistic motifs, such as the Staff God. It is possible that these abstract designs served &quot;a mysterious or esoteric code to keep out uninitiated foreign subjects&quot; and that the geometric distortions made the wearer&#x27;s chest appear larger to reflect their high rank.

The Wari also produced highly sophisticated metalwork and ceramics, with similar designs to the textiles. The most common metals used were silver and copper, though gold Wari artifacts also survive. The most common metal objects were &quot;qiru&quot;, bowls, jewelry, mummy bundle masks, mantle pins, and sheet figures who demonstrate how the tunics were worn. Ceramics were typically polychrome and frequently depicted food and animals. Conchopata appears to have been the ceramic center of Wari culture given the high quantities of pottery tools, firing rooms, pit kilns, potsherds, and ceramic molds. In one of the D-shaped temples at Conchopata, there were large smashed chicha vessels on the floor and human heads placed as offerings as a form of human sacrifice.

<doc id="1010088" wikidata="Q3995966" url="?curid=1010088" title="Total suspended solids">
<text>Total suspended solids (TSS) is the dry-weight of suspended particles, that are not dissolved, in a sample of water that can be trapped by a filter that is analyzed using a filtration apparatus known as sintered glass crucible. TSS is a water quality parameter used to assess the quality of a specimen of any type of water or water body, ocean water for example, or wastewater after treatment in a wastewater treatment plant. It is listed as a conventional pollutant in the U.S. Clean Water Act. Total dissolved solids is another parameter acquired through a separate analysis which is also used to determine water quality based on the total substances that are fully dissolved within the water, rather than undissolved suspended particles.

TSS is also referred to using the terms total suspended matter (TSM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM). All three terms describe the same essential measurement. TSS was previously called non-filterable residue (NFR), but was changed to TSS because of ambiguity in other scientific disciplines.

== Measurement ==
TSS of a water or wastewater sample is determined by pouring a carefully measured volume of water (typically one litre; but less if the particulate density is high, or as much as two or three litres for very clean water) through a pre-weighed filter of a specified pore size, then weighing the filter again after the drying process that removes all water on the filter. Filters for TSS measurements are typically composed of glass fibres. The gain in weight is a dry weight measure of the particulates present in the water sample expressed in units derived or calculated from the volume of water filtered (typically milligrams per litre or mg/L).

If the water contains an appreciable amount of dissolved substances (as certainly would be the case when measuring TSS in seawater), these will add to the weight of the filter as it is dried. Therefore, it is necessary to &quot;wash&quot; the filter and sample with deionized water after filtering the sample and before drying the filter. Failure to add this step is a fairly common mistake made by inexperienced laboratory technicians working with sea water samples, and will completely invalidate the results as the weight of salts left on the filter during drying can easily exceed that of the suspended particulate matter.

Although turbidity purports to measure approximately the same water quality property as TSS, the latter is preferred when available as it provides an actual weight of the particulate material present in the sample. In water quality monitoring situations, a series of more labor-intensive TSS measurements will be paired with relatively quick and easy turbidity measurements to develop a site-specific correlation. Once satisfactorily established, the correlation can be used to estimate TSS from more frequently made turbidity measurements, saving time and effort. Because turbidity readings are somewhat dependent on particle size, shape, and color, this approach requires calculating a correlation equation for each location. Further, situations or conditions that tend to suspend larger particles through water motion (e.g., increase in a stream current or wave action) can produce higher values of TSS not necessarily accompanied by a corresponding increase in turbidity. This is because particles above a certain size (essentially anything larger than silt) are not measured by a bench turbidity meter (they settle out before the reading is taken), but contribute substantially to the TSS value.

== Definition problems ==
Although TSS appears to be a straightforward measure of particulate weight obtained by separating particles from a water sample using a filter, it suffers as a defined quantity from the fact that particles occur in nature in essentially a continuum of sizes. At the lower end, TSS relies on a cut-off established by properties of the filter being used. At the upper end, the cut-off should be the exclusion of all particulates too large to be &quot;suspended&quot; in water. However, this is not a fixed particle size but is dependent upon the energetics of the situation at the time of sampling: moving water suspends larger particles than does still water. Usually it is the case that the additional suspended material caused by the movement of the water is of interest.

These problems in no way invalidate the use of TSS; consistency in method and technique can overcome short-comings in most cases. But comparisons between studies may require a careful review of the methodologies used to establish that the studies are in fact measuring the same thing.

TSS in mg/L can be calculated as:
: (dry weight of residue and filter − dry weight of filter alone, in grams)/ mL of sample * 1,000,000

<doc id="1010090" wikidata="Q616066" url="?curid=1010090" title="Coarctation of the aorta">
<text>Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a congenital condition whereby the aorta is narrow, usually in the area where the ductus arteriosus (ligamentum arteriosum after regression) inserts. The word &quot;coarctation&quot; means &quot;pressing or drawing together; narrowing&quot;. Coarctations are most common in the aortic arch. The arch may be small in babies with coarctations. Other heart defects may also occur when coarctation is present, typically occurring on the left side of the heart. When a patient has a coarctation, the left ventricle has to work harder. Since the aorta is narrowed, the left ventricle must generate a much higher pressure than normal in order to force enough blood through the aorta to deliver blood to the lower part of the body. If the narrowing is severe enough, the left ventricle may not be strong enough to push blood through the coarctation, thus resulting in a lack of blood to the lower half of the body. Physiologically its complete form is manifested as interrupted aortic arch.

== Classification ==

There are three types of aortic coarctations:
# Preductal coarctation: The narrowing is proximal to the ductus arteriosus. Blood flow to the aorta that is distal to the narrowing is dependent on the ductus arteriosus; therefore severe coarctation can be life-threatening. Preductal coarctation results when an intracardiac anomaly during fetal life decreases blood flow through the left side of the heart, leading to hypoplastic development of the aorta. This is the type seen in approximately 5% of infants with Turner syndrome.
# Ductal coarctation: The narrowing occurs at the insertion of the ductus arteriosus. This kind usually appears when the ductus arteriosus closes.
# Postductal coarctation: The narrowing is distal to the insertion of the ductus arteriosus. Even with an open ductus arteriosus, blood flow to the lower body can be impaired. This type is most common in adults. It is associated with notching of the ribs (because of collateral circulation), hypertension in the upper extremities, and weak pulses in the lower extremities. Postductal coarctation is most likely the result of the extension of a muscular artery (ductus arteriosus) into an elastic artery (aorta) during fetal life, where the contraction and fibrosis of the ductus arteriosus upon birth subsequently narrows the aortic lumen.

Aortic coarctation and aortic stenosis are both forms of aortic narrowing. In terms of word root meanings, the names are not different, but a conventional distinction in their usage allows differentiation of clinical aspects. This spectrum is dichotomized by the idea that aortic coarctation occurs in the aortic arch, at or near the ductus arteriosus, whereas aortic stenosis occurs in the aortic root, at or near the aortic valve. This naturally could present the question of the dividing line between a post valvular stenosis and a preductal coarctation; nonetheless, the dichotomy has a practical use, as most defects are either one or the other.

== Signs and symptoms ==
In mild cases, children may show no signs or symptoms at first and their condition may not be diagnosed until later in life. Some children born with coarctation of the aorta have additional heart defects, such as aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus or mitral valve abnormalities.

Coarctation is about twice as common in boys as it is in girls. It is frequently found in girls who have Turner syndrome.

Symptoms may be absent with mild narrowings (coarctation). When present, they include breathing difficulties, poor appetite or trouble feeding, and failure to thrive. Later on, children may develop symptoms related to problems with blood flow and an enlarged heart. They may experience dizziness or shortness of breath, fainting or near-fainting episodes, chest pain, abnormal tiredness or fatigue, headaches, or nosebleeds. They have cold legs and feet or have pain in their legs with exercise (intermittent claudication).

In cases of more severe coarctations, babies may develop serious problems soon after birth because not enough blood can get through the aorta to the rest of their body.
Arterial hypertension in the arms with low blood pressure in the lower extremities is classic. In the lower extremities, weak pulses in the femoral arteries and arteries of the feet are found.

The coarctation typically occurs after the left subclavian artery. However, if situated before it, blood flow to the left arm is compromised and asynchronous or radial pulses of different &quot;strength&quot; may be detected (normal on the right arm, weak or delayed on the left), termed &quot;radio-radial delay&quot;. In these cases, a difference between the normal radial pulse in the right arm and the delayed femoral pulse in the legs (either side) may be apparent, whilst no such delay would be appreciated with palpation of both delayed left arm and either femoral pulses. On the other hand, a coarctation occurring after the left subclavian artery will produce synchronous radial pulses, but &quot;radio-femoral delay&quot; will be present under palpation in either arm (both arm pulses are normal compared to the delayed leg pulses).

== Diagnosis ==
With imaging, resorption of the lower part of the ribs may be seen, due to increased blood flow over the neurovascular bundle that runs there. Prestenotic dilatation of the aortic arch and left subclavian artery, as well as indentation at the site of coarctation results in a classic &#x27;figure 3 sign&#x27; on x-ray. The characteristic bulging of the sign is caused by dilatation of the aorta due to an indrawing of the aortic wall at the site of cervical rib obstruction, with consequent poststenotic dilatation. This physiology results in the &#x27;3&#x27; image for which the sign is named. When the esophagus is filled with barium, a reverse 3 or E sign is often seen and represents a mirror image of the areas of prestenotic and poststenotic dilatation.

Coarctation of the aorta can be accurately diagnosed with magnetic resonance angiography. In teenagers and adults echocardiograms may not be conclusive. 

The severity of coarctation of the aorta can be rated by a combination of the smallest aortic cross-sectional area of the aorta (adjusted for body surface area) as measured by 3D-rendered contrast MRI, as well as mean heart rate–corrected flow deceleration in the descending aorta as measured by phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging.

== Prevention ==
Unfortunately, coarctations can not be prevented because they are usually present at birth. The best thing for patients who are affected by coarctations is early detection. Some signs that can lead to a coarctation have been linked to pathologies such as Turner syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, and other family heart conditions.

== Treatment ==
In adults and children found to have coarctation, treatment is conservative if asymptomatic, but may require surgical resection of the narrow segment if there is arterial hypertension. The first operations to treat coarctation were carried out by Clarence Crafoord in Sweden in 1944. In some cases angioplasty can be performed to dilate the narrowed artery, with or without the placement of a stent graft.

For fetuses at high risk for developing coarctation, a novel experimental treatment approach is being investigated, wherein the mother inhales 45% oxygen three times a day (3 x 3–4 hours) beyond 34 weeks of gestation. The oxygen is transferred via the placenta to the fetus and results in dilatation of the fetal lung vessels. As a consequence, the flow of blood through the fetal circulatory system increases, including that through the underdeveloped arch. In suitable fetuses, marked increases in aortic arch dimensions have been observed over treatment periods of about two to three weeks.

The long-term outcome is very good. Some patients may, however, develop a narrowing (stenosis) or dilatation at the previous coarctation site. All patients with unrepaired or repaired aortic coarctation require follow-up in specialized Congenital Heart Disease centers.

=== Complications of surgery ===
Surgical treatment involves resection of the stenosed segment and re-anastomosis. Two complications specific to this surgery are left recurrent nerve palsy and chylothorax, as the recurrent laryngeal nerve and thoracic duct are in the vicinity. Chylothorax is a troublesome complication and is usually managed conservatively by adjusting the diet to eliminate long-chain fatty acids and supplementing medium-chain triglycerides. When conservative management fails surgical intervention is then most often required. Fluorescein dye can aid in the localisation of chyle leak.

== Prognosis ==

=== Side effects ===
Previously, hypertension was defined as a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg but has since been revised by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force to a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or higher in adults. This is a severe problem for the heart and can cause many other complications. In a study of 120 coarctation repair recipients done in Groningen, The Netherlands, twenty-nine patients (25%) experienced hypertension in the later years of life due to the repair. While hypertension has many different factors that lead to this stage of blood pressure, people who have had a coarctation repair — regardless of the age at which the operation was performed — are at much higher risk than the general public of hypertension later in life. Undetected chronic hypertension may result earlier atherosclerosis in the arterial area and can lead to earlier death among coarctation repair patients, at higher rates as time progresses.

Angioplasty is a procedure done to dilate an abnormally narrow section of a blood vessel to allow better blood flow. This is done in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. Typically taking two to three hours, the procedure may take longer but usually patients are able to leave the hospital the same day. After a coarctation repair 20-60% of infant patients may experience reoccurring stenosis at the site of the original operation. This can be fixed by either another coarctectomy.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major issue for patients who have undergone a coarctation repair. Many years after the procedure is done, heart disease not only has an increased chance of affecting coarctation patients, but also progresses through the levels of severity at an alarmingly increased rate. In one study, one fourth of the patients who experienced a coarctation later died of heart disease, some at a relatively young age.

Clinical criteria are used in most studies when defining recurrence of coarctation (recoarctation) when blood pressure is at a difference of &gt;20 mmHg between the lower and upper limbs. This procedure is most common in infant patients and is uncommon in adult patients. 10.8% of infant patients underwent recoarctations at less than two years of age while another 3.1% of older children received a recoarctation.

People who have had a coarctation of the aorta are likely to have bicuspid aortic valve disease. Between 20% and 85% of patients are affected by this disease. Bicuspid aortic valve disease is a big contributor to cardiac failure, which in turn makes up roughly 20% of late deaths to coarctation patients.

=== Follow-up ===
Because of the risk of recoarctation and late hypertension, check-ups are needed once a year or less frequently depending on the individual case. It is important to visit the cardiologist on a regular basis. Depending on the severity of the patient&#x27;s condition, which is evaluated on a case-by-case level, visiting a cardiologist can be a once a year or less frequent surveillance check-up. Keeping a regular schedule of appointments with a cardiologist after a coarctation procedure is complete helps increase the chances of optimal health for the patients. Nowadays, life expectancy is considered normal given the repair was successfully done in early childhood. Treatment of recoarctation is usually successfully done without the need for open-heart surgery. Recoarctation is increasingly less common in the modern era. Late hypertension does also seem to be much less of a problem if the coarctation repair was performed within the first 5 years of life. Life expectancy and quality of life are therefore the same or very close to that of the normal population, but check ups are recommended so that those few percent who need further treatment get it in time.

== History ==

The condition was largely unidentified until the mid-20th century. History of the condition prior to 1945 has been understood via post-mortem records, the first series of which was published in 1928, which examined cases as far back as 1791. The first surgery for coarctation of the aorta was performed by Clarence Crafoord and G. Nylin on October 19, 1944 in Stockholm, Sweden on a 12-year old boy.

An anecdotal history statement describes the first diagnosed case of the coarctation of the aorta in Julia the daughter of the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine after the autopsy in 1832 in Beirut, the referenced manuscript still exists in one of the Maronite monasteries in Mount Lebanon.

==Biography==
Gaines was among the fifth generation of his sharecropper family to be born on the Riverlake Plantation in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana. That became the setting and premise for many of his later works. He was the eldest of 12 children, raised by his aunt, who was disabled and had to crawl to get around the house. Although born generations after the end of slavery, Gaines grew up impoverished, living in the old slave quarters on the plantation.

Gaines&#x27; first years of school took place in the plantation church. When the children were not picking cotton in the fields, a visiting teacher came for five to six months of the year to provide basic education. Gaines then spent three years at St. Augustine School, a Catholic school for African Americans in New Roads, Louisiana. Schooling for African-American children did not continue beyond the eighth grade during this time in Pointe Coupee Parish.

When he was 15 years old, Gaines moved to Vallejo, California, to join his mother and stepfather, who had left Louisiana during World War II. He wrote his first novel at 17 while he was babysitting his youngest brother Michael. According to one account, he wrapped it in brown paper, tied it with string, and sent it to a New York publisher, who rejected it. Gaines burned the manuscript, but later rewrote the novel, which became his first published book, &quot;Catherine Carmier&quot;.

In 1956, Gaines published his first short story, &quot;The Turtles&quot;, in a college magazine at San Francisco State University (SFSU). The next year, he earned a degree in literature from SFSU. After spending two years in the Army, he won a writing fellowship to Stanford University.

From 1981 until retiring in 2004, Gaines was a Writer-in-Residence at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. In 1996, Gaines spent a full semester as a visiting professor at the University of Rennes in France, where he taught the first creative writing class ever offered in the French university system.

In the final years of his life, Gaines lived on Louisiana Highway 1 in Oscar, Louisiana, where he and his wife, Dianne Gaines, built a home on part of the old plantation where he grew up. He had the building where he attended church and school moved to his property.

Gaines died from natural causes at his home on November 5, 2019. He was 86 years old.

<text>The Eau Rouge is a small, stream in the Belgian province of Liège. It is a right tributary of the Amblève.

It starts in the Hautes Fagnes (&quot;High Fens&quot;) and ends in Challes, near Stavelot in the river Amblève. The French words mean &quot;red water&quot;, and the river gets its name from the reddish coloration of the stones and riverbed due to the presence of iron-oxide deposits. The Eau Rouge is particularly geomorphologically interesting, as it appears to be using the old Warche river stream bed.

The Eau Rouge has been a border river for several periods in its existence, including an administrative boundary under the Roman Empire between Cologne and Tongeren, and the state border between the Netherlands and Prussia from 1815 to 1839 and then between Belgium and Prussia from 1839 to 1919.

==Eau Rouge and the F1 circuit==
The Eau Rouge has lent its name to the Eau Rouge corner, one of the best-known corners in Formula One race tracks in the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps motor racing circuit, at the point where the track crosses it for the first time.

<text>The Cajundome is a 13,500-seat multi-purpose arena located in Lafayette, Louisiana on the University of Louisiana at Lafayette campus. It is home to the Louisiana Ragin&#x27; Cajuns men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball programs in addition to hosting various university events and commencement ceremonies including high school graduations.

The arena hosts many regional &amp; national touring concerts (seating for concerts up to 13,500) and special events, such as World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) events and the annual outdoor Cajun Heartland State Fair, an eleven-day state fair that attracts more than 50,000 guests. The arena also hosts the annual Jr. Beta Club Louisiana state conventions for middle and elementary school students and the Sr. Beta Conventions for high schoolers on occasion. The facility is a recognizable Lafayette landmark that was built by the State of Louisiana, partially funded by the City of Lafayette, and is owned by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and managed by the CAJUNDOME Commission.

Currently, the CAJUNDOME is the largest basketball arena in the Sun Belt Conference, the largest college basketball arena in Louisiana, the third largest overall indoor arena in Louisiana (behind the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans and the Brookshire Grocery Arena in Bossier City), one of the largest mid-major college basketball arenas, and in the top 10 largest college basketball arenas in the Deep South.

==History==
===Renovations===
The arena underwent a $20 million renovation in 2016, providing seating, concession, and accessibility along with signage &amp; branding updates to the venue.

The CAJUNDOME completed renovations in January 2020 on a former storage space to open The Table Room, an approximate 300 capacity venue available for pre-show early entry events and private event rentals. The all-ages venue consists of table seating, a small performance area and full bar service. 

==Sports==

The Lafayette Roughnecks of the AF2 played at the CAJUNDOME in 2001.

It hosted the 1998, 1999, and 2007 Sun Belt Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournaments.

===Boxing===
On April 27, 2019, Regis Prograis defeated Kiryl Relikh in the sixth round by TKO to win the WBA super-lightweight championship.

===Ice Hockey===
====Louisiana IceGators====
The Louisiana IceGators of the East Coast Hockey League played host in the CAJUNDOME from 1995 to 2005. During that time, the arena earned the nickname &#x27;The Frozen Swamp&#x27;. In 2005, the franchise folded due to financial problems and drops in attendance after the IceGators were in the Top 4 for attendance in the ECHL. In 2009, Danny Smith, a local businessman, decided to bring back the Louisiana IceGators but this time in the Southern Professional Hockey League. A few months after Smith bought it, the franchise was sold to E.C. &quot;Chuck&quot; Anselmo Jr. and E.C. &quot;Chuck&quot; Anselmo, III. In their first season, the IceGators played at Blackham Coliseum. In their second season, the IceGators moved to the CAJUNDOME. In early 2016, the Louisiana IceGators and the SPHL announced that the IceGators would suspend operations for the 2016–17 season citing that the arena renovations would not be completed in time for the season.

== Convention Center ==
In 2002, a new convention center addition to the arena was built. The new addition added 37,301 square feet (3,465 m2) of exhibit hall space to the Cajundome&#x27;s 40,000 square feet (3,716 m2) of arena floor space plus 39,685 square feet (3687 m2) of meeting space including a 15,682 square foot (1457 m2) ballroom, 12,159 square feet (1130 m2) of pre-function space and a 17,590 square foot (1630 m2) outdoor mall holding up to 2,118 for outdoor events.

==Use as a shelter==
In 2005, following the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and soon after Hurricane Rita, the Cajundome became one of the Federal Emergency Management Agency&#x27;s evacuee shelters. Staffed by Red Cross, Salvation Army, Americorp and a host of local charities, the facility became a center of relief for thousands. The recently opened Convention Center addition was also utilized as a distribution logistics point and also housed a Special Needs Clinic. This clinic served those needing additional care not deemed urgent or emergency by local area hospitals.

<text>The Battle of Groton Heights (also known as the Battle of Fort Griswold, and occasionally called the Fort Griswold massacre) was a battle of the American Revolutionary War fought on September 6, 1781 between a small Connecticut militia force led by Lieutenant Colonel William Ledyard and the more numerous British forces led by Brigadier General Benedict Arnold and Lieutenant Colonel Edmund Eyre.

Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton ordered Arnold to raid the port of New London, Connecticut, in an unsuccessful attempt to divert General George Washington from marching against Lord Cornwallis&#x27;s army in Virginia. The raid was a success, but the Connecticut militia stubbornly resisted British attempts to capture Fort Griswold across the Thames River in Groton, Connecticut. New London was burned along with several ships, but many more ships escaped upriver.

Several leaders of the attacking British force were killed or seriously wounded, but the British eventually breached the fort. As the British entered the fort the Americans surrendered, but the British continued firing and killed many of the defenders. However, the high number of British casualties in the overall expedition against Groton and New London led to criticism of Arnold by some of his superiors. The battle was the last major military encounter of the war in the northern United States, preceding and being overshadowed by the decisive Franco-American Siege of Yorktown about six weeks later.

==Background==
Groton&#x27;s history dates back to 1655. It was originally a part of New London, its larger counterpart on the other side of the Thames River on the northern shore of Long Island Sound. It was an important maritime port and became one of the largest along the New England coastline. Groton officially separated from New London and incorporated as a separate town in 1705.

During the American Revolutionary War, the Groton–New London port was a major center of American naval operations, including highly successful privateering operations against British shipping, yet it was poorly protected. Fort Trumbull on the New London side was little more than a redoubt open on the inland side, while Fort Griswold in Groton was a more substantial fort. It was roughly square and bastioned, surrounded by a ditch and some outer earthen defenses. Both were typically garrisoned by small companies of militia, including a few artillerymen, and overall command of the area&#x27;s defenses was directed by Lieutenant Colonel William Ledyard. The forts suffered from continuous shortages of provisions and equipment. Fort Trumbull was unfinished; Fort Griswold&#x27;s infrastructure was complete, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder, cannonballs, food, and troops to conduct an effective stand against the British.

In August 1781, Continental Army Major General George Washington realized that there was an opportunity to strike at the British army of Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis in Virginia. He began moving his forces south from the New York area, using a variety of stratagems to deceive Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton, the British Commander-in-Chief and head of the British forces in New York City. Clinton realized on September 2 that he had been deceived. 

Clinton decided to launch a raid into Connecticut in an effort to draw Washington&#x27;s attention. He only planned it as a raid, but he also believed that New London could be used as a base for further operations into the interior of New England if a permanent British occupation could be established. He gave Brigadier General Benedict Arnold command of the forces for the raid. Arnold was a native of Norwich, Connecticut just up the river from New London. He had been a successful Patriot general, but had changed sides to support the British the previous September.

==Prelude==
The forces assembled by the British were divided into two divisions, numbering about 1,700 men. The first was under Lieutenant Colonel Edmund Eyre, composed of the 40th and 54th Regiments of Foot and a Loyalist provincial regiment of Cortlandt Skinner&#x27;s New Jersey Volunteers. The second division was under Arnold&#x27;s command and consisted of the 38th Foot and a variety of Loyalist units, including the Loyal American Regiment and Arnold&#x27;s provincial regiment, known as the American Legion. The expedition also included about 100 Hessian jägers, a small number of artillerymen, three six-pound guns, and a howitzer, all of which were divided among the divisions. These troops were embarked on transports and sailed on September 4 in the company of a fleet of smaller armed ships, led by Commodore John Bazely in the fifth-rate .

The fleet anchored about west of New London to make final preparations, and then sailed for New London late on September 5, intending to make a nighttime landing. However, contrary winds prevented the transports from reaching the port until it was already daylight on September 6. In the early hours of that morning, Rufus Avery witnessed the fleet&#x27;s arrival as a colonial officer stationed at Fort Griswold:

... about three o&#x27;clock in the morning, as soon as I had daylight so as to see the fleet, it appeared a short distance below the lighthouse. The fleet consisted of thirty-two vessels... I immediately sent word to Captain William Latham, who commanded [Fort Griswold], and who was not far distant. He very soon came to the fort, and saw the enemy&#x27;s fleet, and immediately sent a notice to Col. William Ledyard, who was commander of the harbor, Fort Griswold, and Fort Trumbull.

Upon receiving the alert, Ledyard sent a messenger to notify Governor Jonathan Trumbull and local militia leaders of the British arrival, and went to Fort Griswold to arrange its defenses. Fort Griswold&#x27;s guns were fired twice, a signal of enemy approach. However, one of the British ships fired a third round, changing the meaning of the signal to indicate the arrival of a victorious friend. This signal confusion led to delays in mustering militia companies.

At sunrise on September 6, the British landed on both sides of the mouth of the Thames River. The people of the town could do nothing but evacuate, and several ships in the harbor escaped upstream. The 800-man detachment that Arnold led in New London met with no resistance. The defenders of Fort Trumbull, 23 men led by Captain Shapley, fired a single volley, spiked the guns, and boarded boats to cross the river to Fort Griswold, following orders left by Colonel Ledyard. Seven of Shapley&#x27;s men were wounded, and one of the boats was captured; the detachment that Arnold sent to take Fort Trumbull sustained four or five killed or wounded, according to Arnold&#x27;s account. Arnold&#x27;s troops continued into the town where they set about destroying stockpiles of goods and naval stores. Under the orders given, parts of the town were supposed to be spared, some of which was the property of those secretly loyal to the British, but at least one of the storehouses contained a large quantity of gunpowder, which Arnold evidently had not known. When it ignited, the resulting explosion set fire to the surrounding buildings. The fire was soon uncontrollable and 143 buildings were consumed by flames. Several ships in the harbor were able to escape upriver when the wind changed.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Colonel Eyre&#x27;s force of 800 men landed on the east side of the Thames River, but they were slowed by tangled woodlands and swamplands. The New Jersey Loyalists landed after the initial wave of regulars, also delayed by the difficulty in moving the artillery through rough conditions, and they did not participate in the assault.

The other division of troops landed on the east side of the river ... under the command of Col. Eyre and Major Montgomery. This division ... got to the terminus of the woods ... a little south of east on a direct line from the fort. Here the division halted, and Major Montgomery sent Captain Beckwith with a flag to the fort to demand its surrender. Colonel Ledyard ... sent a flag and met Beckwith... The bearer of the American flag answered, &quot;Colonel Ledyard will maintain the fort to the last extremity.&quot; Eyre sent a second parley flag, threatening to give no quarter if the militia did not surrender. Ledyard&#x27;s response was as before, even though some of his subordinates argued that they should leave the fort and fight outside it.

Arnold ordered Eyre to assault the fort, believing that it would fall easily. However, upon reaching a prominence from which he could see its defenses, Arnold realized that the fort was more complete than anticipated and that taking it would not be easy. One of the reasons for taking the fort was to prevent the escape of boats upriver, and many had already passed beyond the fort; Arnold, therefore, attempted to recall Eyre, but the battle was joined a few minutes before the messenger arrived.

==Battle==

On the return of the second parley flag, Eyre launched a full-scale assault upon the fort and its roughly 150 defenders. Stephen Hempstead, a sergeant in Shapley&#x27;s Company, recounted, &quot;When the answer to their demand had been returned... the enemy were soon in motion, and marched with great rapidity, in a solid column... they rushed furiously and simultaneously to the assault of the southwest bastion and the opposite sides.&quot; As the British neared the ditch, they were met by a bombardment of grapeshot that killed and wounded many. This briefly scattered them, but they reformed into two units. Eyre led one force against the southwest bastion, where American fire repulsed the assault, seriously wounding Eyre and several of his officers. (New London historian Frances Manwaring Caulkins asserted that Eyre was mortally wounded, while Benedict Arnold reported that Eyre survived.) Major William Montgomery led the second party to an abandoned redoubt just east of the fort. From there, they moved across the ditch and assaulted the ramparts. This unit gained the bastion against fierce resistance, but Montgomery was killed by the thrust of a 10-foot pike from Jordan Freeman, a black man who had previously been a slave in service to Colonel Ledyard. Montgomery&#x27;s men were finally able to open a gate from inside, and the British force poured into the fort. Seeing that the fort was penetrated, Colonel Ledyard ordered a cease fire and prepared to surrender it to the British.

What happened next is controversial. The most detailed accounts of the event are from American sources and are fairly consistent in what they describe. According to these accounts, the British continued to fire on the Americans despite Ledyard&#x27;s signs of surrender, and much of the garrison was consequently either killed or seriously wounded. Rufus Avery wrote in his account, &quot;I believe there was not less than five or six hundred men of the enemy on the parade in the fort. They killed and wounded nearly every man in the fort as quick as they could.&quot;

Some accounts say that Captain George Beckwith killed Ledyard, while others say it was Captain Stephen Bromfield, who assumed command after Major Montgomery was killed. Randall&#x27;s assessment is that Ledyard offered his sword to &quot;…Van Buskirk just as British soldiers ran up and bayonetted him.&quot;

A black soldier named Lambert Latham is credited with killing the British officer who killed Colonel Ledyard. Stephen Hempstead recalled the scene in the aftermath: &quot;Never was a scene of more brutal wanton carnage witnessed than now took place. The enemy were still firing upon us... [until] they discovered they were in danger of being blown up.&quot; Rufus Avery believed that the attack was called off due to the chance that further musket fire might set off the fort&#x27;s powder magazine. The British left a burning powder trail to destroy Fort Griswold&#x27;s magazine, but a militiaman entered the fort and extinguished the fire.

British descriptions of the battle ascribe several possible reasons for their behavior. During the battle, the fort&#x27;s flag was allegedly shot down. Many British soldiers interpreted this as striking the colors, that is, making a sign of surrender. Then, the British suffered significant casualties when they approached the fort openly believing the Americans would not shoot. Consequently, they did not trust Ledyard&#x27;s legitimate surrender, and they vented their anger over the death and wounding of their commanding officers. Other accounts say that Americans in one part of the fort were unaware that Ledyard had surrendered, and continued to fight. Therefore, the British soldiers also continued fighting, mistrusting those who attempted to surrender.

Early British historians generally did not report much beyond Arnold&#x27;s report of the expedition, which was unexceptional. William Gordon, however, reported in his 1788 history of the war that the &quot;Americans had not more than a half dozen killed&quot; before the fort was stormed, and that &quot;a severe execution took place after resistance ceased.&quot; He wrote, further, that Ledyard “presented him his sword” and was &quot;immediately run through and killed&quot;, but doesn’t mention the details which appear in later accounts. An Italian historian wrote in 1809, &quot;The assailants massacred as well those who surrendered as those who resisted.&quot;

However, neither Rufus Avery nor Stephen Hempstead saw Ledyard killed. Avery said, &quot;…[Ledyard] was about six feet from them when I turned my eyes off from him, and went up to the door of the barracks…&quot; and &quot;It was but a moment that I had turned my eyes from Col. L. and saw him alive, and now I saw him weltering in his gore!&quot; Hempstead said, &quot;I turned suddenly round… crushed me to the ground. The first person I saw afterwards, was my brave commander, a corpse by my side, having been run through the body with his own sword…&quot; 

Two black men and one indigenous man are recorded among the defenders of Fort Griswold. The black men were Jordan Freeman and Lambert Latham, who both were killed in action. Tom Wansuc was a Pequot Indian who was stabbed in the neck with a bayonet.

==Aftermath==
The casualties and losses at Fort Griswold marked one of the greatest in the history of Groton and Connecticut, and was one of the last British victories in North America before the end of the war. The battle left nearly 100 families homeless and destroyed nine public buildings and much of the town&#x27;s waterfront. The state identified losses in 1792 that totaled more than £61,000, or $200,000 Continental dollars. Some who lost homes or property were awarded land in the Western Reserve.

The fighting at Fort Griswold left dozens of Americans dead. The &quot;Groton Gazette&quot; reported that casualties numbered about 150. Some survivors escaped, such as George Middleton, but others were taken prisoner, including Stephen Hempstead. He stated, &quot;After the massacre, they plundered us of everything we had, and left us literally naked.&quot; Hempstead was among the wounded and reported how he was placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet. The wagon was allowed to run down the hill, where it stopped when it struck a tree, throwing some of the men off the wagon and aggravating their injuries. Arnold reported that 85 men &quot;were found dead in Fort Griswold, and sixty wounded, most of them mortally.&quot; 

Arnold later issued a report stating that 48 British soldiers were killed and 145 wounded. Clinton praised Arnold for his &quot;spirited conduct&quot;, but also complained about the high casualty rate; about 25 percent of the troops sent against Fort Griswold were killed or wounded. One British observer wrote that it had been like &quot;a Bunker Hill expedition&quot;, and many British soldiers blamed Arnold for the events at Fort Griswold, even though he had not been in a position to intervene. Arnold next proposed a raiding expedition against Philadelphia, but the surrender of Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis at Yorktown in late October ended that idea.

==Legacy==
Fort Trumbull was extensively modified in the 19th century, and both it and Fort Griswold are now preserved in state parks. The Fort Griswold park also includes the Groton Monument, erected in the 1820s to commemorate the battle. Both forts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

There is a plaque on the main gate at Fort Griswold listing the fort&#x27;s defenders and their fates.

<doc id="1010127" wikidata="Q1770822" url="?curid=1010127" title="Carbon-13">
<text>Carbon-13 (13C) is a natural, stable isotope of carbon with a nucleus containing six protons and seven neutrons. As one of the environmental isotopes, it makes up about 1.1% of all natural carbon on Earth.

== Detection by mass spectrometry ==
A mass spectrum of an organic compound will usually contain a small peak of one mass unit greater than the apparent molecular ion peak (M) of the whole molecule. This is known as the M+1 peak and comes from the few molecules that contain a 13C atom in place of a 12C. A molecule containing one carbon atom will be expected to have an M+1 peak of approximately 1.1% of the size of the M peak, as 1.1% of the molecules will have a 13C rather than a 12C. Similarly, a molecule containing two carbon atoms will be expected to have an M+1 peak of approximately 2.2% of the size of the M peak, as there is double the previous likelihood that any molecule will contain a 13C atom.

In the above, the mathematics and chemistry have been simplified, however it can be used effectively to give the number of carbon atoms for small- to medium-sized organic molecules. In the following formula the result should be rounded to the nearest integer:

:formula_1

where &quot;C&quot; = number of C atoms, &quot;X&quot; = amplitude of the M ion peak, and &quot;Y&quot; = amplitude of the M +1 ion peak.

13C-enriched compounds are used in the research of metabolic processes by means of mass spectrometry. Such compounds are safe because they are non-radioactive. In addition, 13C is used to quantify proteins (quantitative proteomics). One important application is in stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). 13C-enriched compounds are used in medical diagnostic tests such as the urea breath test. Analysis in these tests is usually of the ratio of 13C to 12C by isotope ratio mass spectrometry.

The ratio of 13C to 12C is slightly higher in plants employing C4 carbon fixation than in plants employing C3 carbon fixation. Because the different isotope ratios for the two kinds of plants propagate through the food chain, it is possible to determine if the principal diet of a human or other animal consists primarily of C3 plants or C4 plants by measuring the isotopic signature of their collagen and other tissues.

== Uses in science ==

Due to differential uptake in plants as well as marine carbonates of 13C, it is possible to use these isotopic signatures in earth science. Biological processes preferentially take up the lower mass isotope through kinetic fractionation. In aqueous geochemistry, by analyzing the δ13C value of carbonaceous material found in surface and ground waters, the source of the water can be identified. This is because atmospheric, carbonate, and plant derived δ13C values all differ. In biology, the ratio of carbon-13 and carbon-12 isotopes in plant tissues is different depending on the type of plant photosynthesis and this can be used, for example, to determine which types of plants were consumed by animals. Greater carbon-13 concentrations indicate stomatal limitations, which can provide information on plant behaviour during drought. Tree ring analysis of carbon isotopes can be used to retrospectively understand forest photosynthesis and how it is impacted by drought.

In geology, the 13C/12C ratio is used to identify the layer in sedimentary rock created at the time of the Permian extinction 252 Mya when the ratio changed abruptly by 1%. More information about usage of 13C/12C ratio in science can be found in the article about isotopic signatures.

Carbon-13 has a non-zero spin quantum number of , and hence allows the structure of carbon-containing substances to be investigated using carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance.

The carbon-13 urea breath test is a safe and highly accurate diagnostic tool to detect the presence of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection in the stomach. The urea breath test utilizing carbon-13 is preferred to carbon-14 for certain vulnerable populations due to its non-radioactive nature.

== Production ==
Bulk carbon-13 for commercial use, e.g. in chemical synthesis, is enriched from its natural 1% abundance. Although carbon-13 can be separated from the major carbon-12 isotope via techniques such as thermal diffusion, chemical exchange, gas diffusion, and laser and cryogenic distillation, currently only cryogenic distillation of methane (boiling point −161.5°C) or carbon monoxide (b.p. −191.5°C) is an economically feasible industrial production technique. Industrial carbon-13 production plants represent a substantial investment, greater than 100 meter tall cryogenic distillation columns are needed to separate the carbon-12 or carbon-13 containing compounds. The largest reported commercial carbon-13 production plant in the world as of 2014 has a production capability of ~400 kg of carbon-13 annually. In contrast, a 1969 carbon monoxide cryogenic distillation pilot plant at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories could produce 4 kg of carbon-13 annually.

<doc id="1010129" wikidata="Q1418865" url="?curid=1010129" title="Fireball XL5">
<text>Fireball XL5 is a 1960s British children&#x27;s science-fiction puppet television series about the missions of &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, a vessel of the World Space Patrol that polices the cosmos in the year 2062. Commanded by Colonel Steve Zodiac, &quot;XL5&quot; defends Earth from interstellar threats while encountering a wide variety of alien civilisations.

Inspired by the Space Race, &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; was created by the husband-and-wife team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed by their production company AP Films (APF) for ITC Entertainment. It was APF&#x27;s final black-and-white series and the third to be made in what the Andersons dubbed &quot;Supermarionation&quot;: a style of production in which the characters were played by electronic marionettes whose mouth movements were synchronised with the voice actors&#x27; pre-recorded dialogue. Zodiac was voiced by Paul Maxwell while two of his companions – &quot;XL5&quot; co-pilot Robert the Robot and &quot;space doctor&quot; Venus – were voiced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson themselves. The series&#x27; scale model special effects were directed by Derek Meddings.

Filming of &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;″s 39 half-hour episodes began in February 1962 and the series premiered on ATV London (part of the ITV network) on 28 October that year. It was also purchased by NBC in the United States, becoming the only Anderson series to air on an American network. The TV episodes were supplemented by an audio play, comic strips in &quot;TV Comic&quot; and &quot;TV Century 21&quot;, and other tie-ins including books, toys and model kits. The series was regularly repeated on British TV until 1974 and has since been released on DVD in the UK, US, Canada and Australia.

In June 2023 the British free-to-air vintage film and nostalgia television channel Talking Pictures TV commenced a rerun of the series on Saturday afternoons. Whilst in the United States the series, along with other Anderson Supermarionation series, will be shown on MeTV Toons from July 25th. 

Regarded by some commentators as a space opera or space Western, &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; has been praised for its music; its closing theme – &quot;Fireball&quot;, sung by Don Spencer – was commercially released to moderate success in the UK charts. It is often confused with &quot;Space Patrol&quot;, a puppet series with a similar premise that was made by the Andersons&#x27; former collaborators Roberta Leigh and Arthur Provis.

==Premise==
Set in the year 2062, the series follows the missions of Earth spaceship &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, commanded by Colonel Steve Zodiac of the World Space Patrol (WSP). Zodiac&#x27;s crew comprises Dr Venus, an authority on space medicine; engineer and navigator Professor Matthew Matic; and co-pilot Robert: a transparent, anthropomorphic robot who often exclaims &quot;ON-OUR-WAY-&#x27;OME!&quot; as &quot;XL5&quot; returns to base.

&quot;XL5&quot; patrols Sector 25 of charted interstellar space and is one of at least 30 &quot;Fireball XL&quot; vessels (an &quot;XL30&quot; is mentioned in the episode &quot;The Firefighters&quot;). The ship has a &quot;gravity activator&quot; for artificial gravity and consists of two detachable sections. A winged nose cone dubbed &quot;Fireball Junior&quot; houses the cockpit and serves as a self-contained short take-off and vertical landing craft for exploring planets. The main, larger section contains a navigation bay, laboratory, workshops, lounge and crew quarters, together with the rocket motors that enable interstellar travel. On arrival at an alien world, the main section usually remains in orbit while &quot;Fireball Junior&quot; travels down to the surface.

The WSP is based at Space City, located on an unnamed island in the South Pacific Ocean. The organisation is headed by Commander Zero, assisted by Lieutenant Ninety. For unspecified reasons, the city&#x27;s 25-storey, T-shaped control tower is seen to rotate (in one episode (&quot;Dangerous Cargo&quot;), a character (Zoonie the Lazoon) accidentally causes it to turn fast enough for those inside to suffer vertigo). &quot;XL5&quot;″s deep-space patrols are missions of three months&#x27; duration; between missions, the ship is on call at Space City. The ship blasts off from a mile-long launch rail ending in a 40-degree incline. On its return to Space City, it lands vertically in a horizontal attitude using underside-mounted retro-rockets.

Until the episode &quot;Faster Than Light&quot;, &quot;XL5&quot; travels through space at sub-light speeds. Its rocket motors, powered by a &quot;nutomic&quot; reactor, provide a maximum safe speed of &quot;Space Velocity 7&quot;, allowing the ship to reach the outlying star systems of charted space within a few months. The crew do not wear spacesuits outside the ship: instead, they take &quot;oxygen pills&quot; to survive the vacuum while using thruster packs to manoeuvre. The ship&#x27;s &quot;neutroni&quot; radio enables virtually instantaneous communication with Space City and other space vessels over vast distances.

==Characters==
===Regular===

* Colonel Steve Zodiac (voiced by Paul Maxwell): the pilot and commanding officer of &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;. In the episode &quot;Space City Special&quot; he is declared &quot;Astronaut of the Year&quot;.
* Doctor Venus (voiced by Sylvia Anderson): a doctor of space medicine, of French origin. Zodiac personally selected her to be a member of the &quot;XL5&quot; crew. According to the episode &quot;The Last of the Zanadus&quot;, Venus has served on the ship for five years.
* Professor Matthew &quot;Matt&quot; Matic (voiced by David Graham): &quot;XL5&quot;″s engineer, navigator and science officer.
* Robert the Robot (voiced by an uncredited Gerry Anderson through an artificial larynx): the co-pilot of &quot;XL5&quot;, a transparent robot invented by Professor Matic and Earth&#x27;s most advanced mechanical man.
* Zoonie the Lazoon (voiced by David Graham): Venus&#x27;s lazy, semi-telepathic pet from planet Colevio. During his early appearances, he can say no more than &quot;welcome home&quot;. His vocabulary expands as the series progresses, often due to him mimicking other characters.
* Commander Wilbur Zero (voiced by John Bluthal): the operational commander-in-chief of the World Space Patrol and chief controller of Space City. Despite his gruff exterior, he shows great respect and care for his subordinates, especially Zodiac. Zero&#x27;s rank appears to be above that of Colonel but below that of Space General.
* Lieutenant Ninety (voiced by David Graham): Space City&#x27;s assistant controller. He is young, inexperienced and the one most often on the receiving end of Commander Zero&#x27;s scathing attitude (although Zero also refers to him as &quot;the best lieutenant Space City has&quot;). In one episode he is shown training to be an &quot;XL&quot; pilot.

===Recurring===
* Jock Campbell (voiced by John Bluthal): Space City&#x27;s chief engineer, of Scottish origin.
* Eleanor and Jonathan Zero (both voiced by Sylvia Anderson): Commander Zero&#x27;s wife and young son.
* Captain Ken Ross (voiced by John Bluthal): pilot of &quot;Fireball XL7&quot;. He often needs rescuing by the &quot;XL5&quot; crew.
* Mr and Mrs Boris and Griselda Space Spy (voiced by David Graham and Sylvia Anderson): a villainous husband-and-wife pair of Russian origin who first appear in the episode &quot;Spy in Space&quot;.
* The Subterrains (voiced by John Bluthal and David Graham): a race of hostile aliens from Planet 46.

After making &quot;Supercar&quot;, production company AP Films (APF) presented its investor – Lew Grade of Associated Television – with two ideas for a follow-up series. One of these, titled &quot;Century 21&quot; (the original name of the spaceship), was commissioned and produced as &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;. The rejected proposal, &quot;Joe 90&quot;, was about a boy called Joe who dreams of carrying out daring space missions as an astronaut codenamed &quot;Joe 90&quot;. Unlike &quot;Century 21&quot;, this concept had a hybrid format – the fantasy sequences being filmed with puppets while the framing stories used live actors. The only creative element shared by the two ideas was the character of Professor Matic. APF would not revisit &quot;Joe 90&quot; until 1967, when it developed a series of that title that bore little resemblance to the original idea.

&quot;Century 21&quot; drew inspiration from the Space Race of the early 1960s. Despite its title, it was originally to have been set in the 30th century, in the year 2962. This was subsequently changed to 2062. At the same time, the &quot;United States Space Patrol&quot; became the &quot;World Space Patrol&quot; and the name of Colonel Zodiac&#x27;s spaceship (as well as the series itself) was changed first to &quot;Nova X 100&quot;, then &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;. The &quot;XL&quot; of the final title was taken from &quot;Castrol XL&quot; engine oil. Thirty-seven of the series&#x27; 39 episodes were written by Alan Fennell, Anthony Marriott or Dennis Spooner, all newcomers to the APF productions. (Spooner, however, had submitted unfilmed scripts for &quot;Supercar&quot;.) Script supervision was performed by series co-creators and voice artists Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, who also wrote the first episode (&quot;Planet 46&quot;) and &quot;Space Monster&quot;.

Filming at APF&#x27;s studios on the Slough Trading Estate began in February 1962. Three stages were used: two for puppet filming (permanent sets on one stage, one-offs on the other) and another for special effects. To speed up production, two puppet filming units were created to allow episodes to be shot in pairs by different crews, who alternated on the first two stages while the effects crew used the third. The production of each episode consisted of a week&#x27;s principal photography on the main puppet stage followed by inserts-filming on the secondary stage, coinciding with two weeks of effects shooting. After a unit vacated one of the puppet stages, it was set up for the other unit to start or resume filming on another episode.

===Characters and voice-recording===
The concept brochure for &quot;Century 21&quot; described Colonel Zodiac and Dr Venus as the &quot;Mr and Miss America&quot; of 2962. Venus&#x27; face was modelled on her voice actor, Sylvia Anderson. Character dialogue was recorded at a studio in Borehamwood.

Robert the Robot had a Perspex body with a head adapted from a plastic tumbler. He was the only regular in a Gerry Anderson puppet series to be voiced by Anderson himself, who &quot;spoke&quot; the robot&#x27;s lines (as well as those of supporting robot characters) through an artificial larynx. As remembered by Anderson in a deleted scene of the documentary &quot;Filmed in Supermarionation&quot; (2014):

Anderson also noted that due to the silent or aspirate nature of the letter &quot;h&quot;, the larynx did not register its vocalisation; thus, Robert&#x27;s customary cry of &quot;On our way home!&quot; was rendered as &quot;ON-OUR-WAY-&#x27;OME!&quot;. Daniel O&#x27;Brien, author of &quot;SF:UK – How British Science Fiction Changed the World&quot;, describes Robert as a &quot;very English homage&quot; to the character Robby the Robot from the 1956 film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.

===Effects and music===
After working on the Andersons&#x27; earlier productions as a contractor, effects director Derek Meddings became a full-time employee of APF and formed his own unit with Brian Johnson as his assistant. According to Meddings, some of the more action-packed episodes featured as many as &quot;40 to 50&quot; effects shots. The rotating Space City control tower, whose filming model was made of wood and card, was inspired by contemporary revolving restaurants. &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; was the first TV series to employ front projection-based visual effects.

The &quot;XL5&quot; spaceship was designed by associate producer and former APF art director Reg Hill. Three models were made: a version, which was used for close-up shots, and two smaller ones measuring and . &quot;XL5&quot;″s rocket sled launch was based on rumoured Soviet plans to fire craft into space on a track ending in a ramp. Although the 1951 film &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; had featured a similar concept, Gerry Anderson denied that &quot;XL5&quot;″s launch method was copied from this. During the filming of the launch sequence, &quot;XL5&quot; was pulled down its rail on wires by a technician running along a platform above the set. Fast cutting was employed to conceal the shaking of the model. Some of the series&#x27; rocket sound effects were created by recording a jet plane at a nearby airfield.

The Jetmobiles – personal hovercraft that the &quot;XL5&quot; crew use to explore the surfaces of planets – were conceived as a way of limiting the number of scenes that showed the characters walking, thus helping to conceal their lack of realistic articulation. Originally the vehicles were to have been rocket-powered; however, tests with miniature explosives proved too destructive so the method of propulsion was changed. The characters of APF&#x27;s later series &quot;Stingray&quot; and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; use vehicles similar to the Jetmobiles.

The opening theme music features saxophones as well as series composer Barry Gray&#x27;s first use of an Ondes Martenot. The closing theme song – &quot;Fireball&quot;, arranged by Charles Blackwell and performed by Don Spencer – was a minor hit in the UK, spending 12 weeks on the music charts, peaking at number 32 in March 1963.

==Broadcast and reception==
&quot;Fireball XL5&quot; was the only Anderson series to be sold to a US network: NBC, which aired it as parts of its Saturday morning children&#x27;s block from 1963 to September 1965. In the UK, the series was regularly repeated on the ITV network until 1974, followed by an additional re-run in 1985.

In June 2023, the British channel Talking Pictures TV began re-broadcasting the series. Whilst in the United States the series, along with other Anderson Supermarionation series, will be shown on MeTV Toons from July 25th.

===Critical response===
According to Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, authors of &quot;Collins Telly Guide&quot;, &quot;the sheer ambition of the show is its charm.&quot; Matthew Millheiser of review website DVD Talk praises the series: &quot;&quot;Fireball XL5&quot; might be kitschy, might be chock-full of scientific inaccuracies and glaring anachronisms that was par-for-the-course for cheesy sci-fi of the time, and even might have a few clunker episodes in the mix. But the care, innovation, and sheer imagination in each episode are positively infectious.&quot; He goes on to describe the series as &quot;simple, clean, clearly delineated fun&quot; and &quot;the perfect type of children&#x27;s entertainment: it doesn&#x27;t talk down to its audience, it doesn&#x27;t bog down the characters with a faux sophistication or glib hipness, and it has enough dazzle, charm, and imagination to make the show enjoyable and entertaining for adults.&quot; For Anthony Clark, &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; &quot;marks the start of the truly great Anderson-produced puppet show [...] [W]hen you sprinkle the episodes with humour, lace them with action and tie them up with Barry Gray&#x27;s fantastic music, the result transcends the show&#x27;s rudimentaries, transforming it into something enduringly special.&quot; Comparing it to the Andersons&#x27; follow-up, &quot;Stingray&quot;, which he considers to be very similar, Clark describes &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; as &quot;[p]erhaps [...] a little more playful and a little less slick, but what it lacks in polish it more than makes up for in energy and pace.&quot;

According to Paul Mavis of DVD Talk, the series is &quot;not as ambitious ideas-wise&quot; as &quot;Stingray&quot; yet &quot;still charms, thanks to its simple yet nicely designed production and that velvety, strangely ethereal black-and-white world it creates.&quot; He also states that &quot;while there aren&#x27;t nearly as many elaborate &#x27;hardware&#x27; set-ups as later Anderson outings [...] the budget-imposed simplicity adds an amusingly ironic, sleek modernist tone&quot; to the series. In contrast, Stuart Galbraith IV describes the &quot;hardware&quot; as &quot;pretty retro even by 1962 standards&quot;, adding that the overall production &quot;looks more like &quot;Rocky Jones, Space Ranger&quot; than &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.&quot; On the writing, he notes that while earlier episodes are mostly &quot;strange-planet/Earth-under-threat-type stories&quot;, there is an increasing focus on character development as the series progresses. Mavis argues that the characters are limited by the fact that they were purposely conceived as &quot;action/adventure stereotypes&quot;. On the writing generally, he considers the &quot;old-school comic book&quot;-style plots to be &quot;less sophisticated than the production design, frequently falling into the same pattern: the UN-like World Space Patrol recognizes a threat from an alien civilisation, sending in Steve Zodiac and team to neutralise it ... before almost getting themselves killed.&quot;

For John Peel, &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; is one of several APF series to feature capable female characters who are weakened by negative gender stereotypes. Peel describes medical expert Dr Venus as being &quot;relegated to secondary chores&quot;, calling this an example of &quot;standard Anderson sexism&quot;. Writing for Decider.com, Meghan O&#x27;Keefe praises &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;″s humour and special effects but criticises the series&#x27; &quot;almost incomprehensible level of misogyny [...] Dr Venus is criticised for not fetching coffee fast enough and later, when she praises Steve&#x27;s heroism, he replies, &#x27;Thanks, I think you&#x27;re cute, too.&#x27;&quot; O&#x27;Keefe also comments that the series &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem concerned with the morality or the larger social implications of space travel. Just as Dr Venus is constantly written off as a woman, the aliens we meet speak an uncomfortably foreign language and are painted as maniacal terrorists willing to go on suicide missions to destroy Earth [...] There&#x27;s no nuance, but then, that clearly wasn&#x27;t the goal. Anderson was clearly trying to make an entertaining show, and it&#x27;s very, very amusing.&quot;

Ian Fryer characterises the series as a Space Western, arguing that Steve Zodiac essentially plays the role of an interstellar sheriff. Fryer also compares David Graham&#x27;s voice for Professor Matic to that of Western actor &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes and the French-born Venus to Marlene Dietrich as Frenchy in the film &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1939). According to Fryer, the series adapts Western stock characters to create an air of &quot;warmth and familiarity&quot;.

The series&#x27; music has been positively received. According to Clark, the closing theme song&#x27;s opening lyric, &quot;I wish I was a spaceman&quot;, had a &quot;timely resonance&quot; for audiences of the early Space Age. Describing the series overall as &quot;better than a lot of live-action movies&quot;, Mark Voger of NJ.com argues that the music &quot;would be at home in any live-action thriller.&quot;

==Tie-ins and home video==
The TV series was supplemented by an audio play, &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot;, which was produced by APF in association with Pye Records. Written by Alan Fennell and released as a 7-inch vinyl EP in February 1965, this was a semi-educational adventure about a sleeping boy who has a dream in which he meets the &quot;XL5&quot; crew, who teach him about spaceflight and the Apollo programme. Patrick Moore was scientific advisor on the production.

&quot;Fireball XL5&quot; also spawned tie-ins including toys, an MPC playset with rocket ship and figures, model kits, puppets, ray guns, water pistols, comic strips, and annuals. A black-and-white comic strip, drawn by Neville Main, was printed in &quot;TV Comic&quot; from 1962 to 1964. In January 1965, the strip moved to the newly-launched &quot;TV Century 21&quot; comic, where it remained for the next five years. The comics adventures, written by Tod Sullivan and drawn by Mike Noble, were printed in colour until 1968, when it evolved into a text feature. Four annuals, featuring comic strips and text stories, were published by Collins between 1963 and 1966. The &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; strips from &quot;TV Century 21&quot; were reprinted in &quot;Countdown&quot; (later named &quot;TV Action&quot;) in 1971 and 1972 and again in Engale Marketing&#x27;s &quot;Action 21&quot; in 1988 and 1989. In the US, Gold Key Comics published a single-issue comic book in 1963; the following year, Little Golden Books published a colour illustrated storybook which was released in the UK under the title &quot;Fireball XL5 – A Big Television Book&quot;.

The series was released on Region 1 DVD by A&amp;E Home Video in 2003. A Region 2 box set with new bonus material was released in 2009, superseding a 2004 version which had no extras. Also in 2009, a colourised version of the episode &quot;A Day in the Life of a Space General&quot; was released on Blu-ray Disc. In 2021, Network Distributing released the full series on Blu-ray.

<doc id="1010134" wikidata="Q7287318" url="?curid=1010134" title="Ralph Camroux Morris">
<text>Colonel Randolph &quot;Ralph&quot; Camroux Morris (3 March 1895 – 19 December 1977, London) was a coffee planter, British Army officer, and hunter-naturalist who was born in India. A pioneer of wildlife conservation in India, a member of the Bombay Natural History Society, he also represented South Indian Europeans in the Indian parliament after 1947. Along with Jim Corbett and Hasan Abid Jafry, he organized an all-India conference for the preservation of wildlife in 1936. Morris was among the first to make use of electric fences to protect crops from elephants and other wildlife in India. He was a member of the first Indian Wildlife Board which made efforts to establish laws to conserve wildlife in post-Independence India.

== Biography ==

Ralph was born in Attikan estate in the Biligirirangan Hills, the son of Mabel Camroux and Randolph Hayton Morris. Morris Sr. was the son of an Perthshire church rector who left home at the age of 18 to work on a ship. He landed in India in 1877 at a time of famine and worked at various estates before starting the first coffee plantation in the Biligirirangans, an area he identified while out hunting. Morris Sr. was a friend of G. P. Sanderson. Ralph was sent to study in England at Blue Coat School and at Blundell&#x27;s in Devon before returning to join his father at the estate. In 1895, his father was gored by a wounded gaur while out hunting. He was taken to Mysore and survived but died in 1918 from pneumonia in the one lung that remained. Ralph became a member of the Bombay Natural History Society in 1919, the same year in which he married Heather, daughter of another BNHS member Angus M. Kinloch, who lived in Kotagiri in the Nilgiris. In 1935, Ralph joined the Vernay-Hopwood expedition, sponsored by Arthur S. Vernay, to the Upper Chindwin of Burma. Another expedition was made into the Malay jungles in the same year in search of the Javan Rhinoceros. He was a President of the United Planters&#x27; Association of South India (UPASI) for one and half years in 1937-38 before joining as a volunteer officer in the war (Indian Army Reserve of Officers). He served in the Middle East and North Africa, seeing action at the Siege of Tobruk. He returned after the war to work at his estate and extended it to &quot;Honnametti&quot;. After Independence, he represented the South Indian Europeans in the Legislative Assembly. In 1955 he sold off his estate to the Birla family and settled in the UK.

He documented the wildlife of the region in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. His estate was visited by numerous people including Leslie Coleman, Victor Brooke, Arthur S. Vernay, John Faunthorpe, Kenneth Anderson, the ornithologist Salim Ali, as well as the Maharaja of Mysore.
In 1933, a fellow sportsman and friend Major Leonard Mourant Handley wrote a book called &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Moon&quot; with a chapter on &quot;The Great Blue Hills of Ranga&quot; which was reviewed by Morris (under his initials &quot;R.C.M.&quot;) in the &quot;Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society&quot; who stated that &quot;there should surely be some limit to the inaccuracies which find their way into modern books, which purport to set forth observations of interest to natural scientists and Shikaris.&quot; Morris found 38 inaccuracies and Handley filed a case of libel in Middlesex and was awarded a damage of 3000 pounds in 1937. Morris never attended the trial and it was suggested the friction between the two former friends arose from differences between Mrs Morris and Mrs Handley.The secretary of the Bombay Natural History Society noted in volume 51 of the journal:
A species of flying squirrel is named after Morris, &quot;Olisthomys morrisi&quot;, which was collected during the Vernay-Hopwood Chindwin Expedition.

In 1994, one of Ralph&#x27;s three daughters Monica Jackson, a mountaineer and anthropologist, reflected on her roots in a book called &quot;Going Back&quot;.

==Writings==

Morris contributed notes mainly to the journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. He also served as an editor and contributor to the short-lived “Indian Wild Life” magazine published by the ‘All India Conference for the Preservation of Wild Life’ from 1936 to 1939, ceasing due to the outbreak of World War II.

<text>The Chusovaya () is a river flowing in Perm Krai, Sverdlovsk Oblast and Chelyabinsk Oblast of Russia. A tributary of the Kama, which in turn is a tributary of the Volga, discharges into the Chusovskoy Cove of the Kamsky Reservoir. The river is remarkable in that it originates on the eastern slopes of the Ural Mountains in Asia, crosses the mountains, and mostly runs on their western slopes in Europe. The Chusovaya River is widely used as a source of water. In particular, its water is taken from the Volchikhinsky Reservoir, , to the Verkhneisetsky Reservoir to supply the major city of Yekaterinburg. Fifteen smaller reservoirs are spread over about 150 tributaries of the river.

There are numerous metal and coal mines along the Chusovaya, and the river was intensively used to deliver their production to the western Russia. However, industrial navigation nearly halted with the development of railways in the early 20th century. Chusovoy is the major remaining port on the river.

The Chusovaya River is famous for its hundreds of large rocks located along the shoreline which are the major tourist attraction of the area. Some rocks posed much danger to boats, especially during the spring thaw. They are generally called (, lit. fighters). Many of them have individual names and are protected by the state as natural monuments.

==Hydrography ==
The basin of the Chusovaya River has an area of and an average elevation of . The river is (777 kilometres according to other sources) and has an average height gradient of 0.4 m/km. It has two sources: Poludennaya Chusovaya and Western (Zapadanaya) Chusovaya. The former originates in a swampy area in the north of Chelyabinsk Oblast and flows to the north. After , it merges with the Western Chusovaya, which starts at the Ufaley ridge. Then the river flows for about on the eastern slope of the Ural Mountains; here its width is . In the upper stream Chusovaya takes many tributaries and shows on its shores outcrops of crystalline shale, which were formed through the interaction of magmatic and sedimentary rocks.
In the middle reaches, the river slopes have canyon-like character. Here the river cuts through several low mountain ranges, which tower above the riverbed as cliffs called . There are about 200 of them in the middle reaches and about 50 are protected by the state as natural monuments. are of sedimentary origin and are made from limestone and rarely dolomite, anhydrite and shale; they rise above the water and extend for . Limestone is prone to weathering which often creates peculiar shapes. Karst processes created numerous caves and grottoes in this area. The river here has a mountainous character with about 70 rapids, and its elevation here decreases by over a length of . Large boulders sometimes protrude above the water surface. Here the river is wide and is rather winding, skirting mountain ranges and making numerous loops. One loop near Utkinskoy settlement is in diameter and is almost a closed loop.

In the lower reaches, after exiting from the Ural Mountains, the river has a plain character. Here it flows through meadows, marshes, deciduous and mixed forests; it slows down and widens in some places up to , making occasional broad bends. The river discharges into the Chusovskoy Cove of Kama Reservoir, which is associated with the Kama hydroelectric power station located from the mouth of the Kama River. Construction of the dam resulted in flooding of the lower reaches of the Chusovaya up to from the mouth. The bottom of the river throughout its length is mainly covered in pebbles.

The water discharge varies between with the average of . The flow is relatively strong – about 10 times that of such rivers as Volga and Kama; it is about on average and may reach in some places. Chusovaya usually freezes in late October through early December and thaws in April. Ice jams are common for the lower reaches with the increase in the water level of up to . The river is fed by snow (55%). precipitation (29%) and underground waters (18%). The floods typically occur between mid-April and mid-June. During the early summer, there are 6–7 rain floods with water levels rising up to . In July through August, the river depth decreases to in some places.

===Tributaries===
Chusovaya takes more than 150 tributaries with the largest being the river Sylva. The Kumysh tributary dives underground for about 6 km; the place where it disappears is called нырок in Russian (&quot;dive&quot; in English) by the local people, and the place where it resurfaces is named вынырок (&quot;coming to the surface&quot;). Such behavior is unusual but not unique to Kumysh and is observed for about 15 other rivers of the Urals. The main tributaries of the Chusovaya are from source to mouth:

*Revda (left)

*Mezhevaya Utka (right)
*Serebryanka (right)

== Flora and fauna==
The upper reaches of the Chusovaya have abundant marshes and meadows. Forests are rare and are mostly pine forests. The middle reaches are covered by boreal coniferous forests, which are dominated by pine, Siberian Pine, larch and fir. Forests are scarce also in the lower reaches and mostly contain aspen, birch, mountain ash and willow. Fishes include minnow, bass, ruffe, roach, pike, ide (&quot;Leuciscus idus&quot;), chub (&quot;Squalius cephalus&quot;) and bream. There are colonies of crayfish. The tributaries show traces of beavers and the main river hosts muskrats. In the autumn, the river is visited by ducks, geese and other waterfowl. The surrounding forests are inhabited by usual taiga animals such as moose, brown bear, wolf, lynx, fox, hare, squirrel, hazel grouse and black grouse.

== History==
The river had long been inhabited by people, as evident from numerous Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements found on the river banks. The 15th Century chronicler Giacomo Filippo Foresti (a.k.a. Jacobus Philippus Foresti da Bergamo) mentioned a river in the area named the &quot;Thisageta&quot;, and the 19th Century archaeologist Sir Ellis Minns proposed that the Chusovaya may originally have been named after the Thyssagetae, a little-known steppe tribe who apparently lived in the area.

In the Middle Ages, the river basin was mostly populated by Bashkirs, Mansi and Komi-Permyaks. It is assumed that the Battle of Chulmandore, in which Komi-Permyaks defeated Mongols, occurred near the river mouth. The Chusovaya River was first mentioned in 1396 in the Novgorod chronicles. Russians started active explorations of the Urals in the early 16th century, and the first Russian settlement Nizhnechusovskie Gorodki appeared on Chusovaya in 1568. From 1579, the garrison of this settlement was headed by the Russian explorer Ermak. The entire river basin was then owned by merchants Stroganov. Stroganovs in particular supplied the expedition of Ermak in the autumn of 1581 up the Chusovaya and beyond the Urals.

Subsequently, the vast lands beyond the Urals, including the upper Chusovaya, were given to Demidov, and the border between the possessions of Stroganov and Demidov was at the river Mezhevaya Utka. Demidov was actively exploring the rich local deposits in his lands and built several iron works, including Polevskoy (1722), Vasilyevo-Shaitansky (1732), Sredneuralskiy (1734) and Seversky (1735).

Before construction of the railway across the Urals, the river served as an important route for transporting metals and fur from the Urals to the western Russia. The first port for this purpose was built in the mouth of the Utka tributary in 1703 by the orders of Peter the Great. Every spring, with the start of the flood, heavily loaded barges were sent from the wharf in the upper Chusovaya to Perm. It was rather difficult to navigate heavy wooden ships through the fast and winding river and many were crashing to the coastal cliffs. About 50 barges had major accidents between 1857 and 1861 on the Chusovaya. In the spring of 1877 alone, 47 barges sank drowning more than 100 men, 23 of those barges crashed at one and the same cliff Brigand (). Massive efforts were spent from the 17th through 19th centuries to improve the navigation conditions on Chusovaya. The most dangerous shore cliffs were blown up with dynamite, including the Brigand (this was one of the world&#x27;s first controlled underwater explosions.) Smaller boulders protruding at the river center were removed, and hundreds mooring poles had been installed. Logs were set up in the places where the currents tended to wash up boats on the rocks in order to soften the impact. These measures drastically reduced the number of accidents (from 10% to 4% of the total number of shipments in 1890) and the traffic on the river grew from 49,500 tonnes in 1862 to 128,800 tonnes in 1873. It then dropped to 107,200 tonnes and remained at this level through the 1890s.

The barges used on Chusovaya were sturdy wooden boats long and wide that could carry up to 200 tonnes. Some barges were reinforced inside with metal stripes and could sustain up to 10 navigation seasons. Barges were equipped with roped weights, which were thrown overboard to increase the drag thereby reducing the barge speed when needed. The first steamship appeared on Chusovaya in 1841, it was a metal vessel named &quot;Nikita Demidov&quot;. For the first three years, the ship was bringing barges loaded with the production of the Staroutkinsky plant between Suksun and Levshino. In 1844, there was an attempt to run the ship in the middle reaches. After a 24-day trip, she managed to pass only and then crashed, once again illustrating the difficulty of navigating the river.

River shipping declined after 1878 with the opening of the Gornozavodskaya railway. Since the early 20th century, shipment of metals was nearly halted and the barges were only occasionally transporting grain and supplies. The last barge trip occurred in 1920. As a result, many settlements along the river bank have been abandoned. However, the ironworks remained and provided the Soviet Army with metal during World War II.

== Commercial use ==
The Chusovaya is extensively used for water supply. In particular, water from Volchihinskoe reservoir is supplied to the Upper Iset Pond to serve the needs of Yekaterinburg and its suburbs. In order to improve the water supply, Nyazepetrovsk cascade was built in the mid-1970s. With this hydraulic system, Western Chusovaya was supplied with water from the Nyazepetrovsk reservoir on the Ufa. There are 15 small reservoirs at the plants on the tributaries of Chusovaya.

The river basin contains numerous deposits of iron, chromium, platinum, gold, diamond and coal. They were developed since the 17th century, some have been depleted and some are still being mined. Major settlements on the river (from source to the mouth) are Revda, Pervouralsk, Bilimbai, Staroutkinsk, Kyn, Ust-Koiva, Chusovoy and Verhnechusovskie Gorodki.

River is navigable from the city of Chusovoy, but the navigation sees very little commercial use nowadays. The railway bridge at the river mouth limits the height of passing ships to . Besides, between the 1930s and early 1980s, the river basin was intensively used for logging; logs were rafted loose, i.e. neither guided nor bundled, that cluttered the river. The last such rafting was carried out on Chusovaya in 1973, and since 1990 it is legally prohibited in Russia.

== Ecology==
According to the Office for Environmental Protection of Perm Oblast, the water of the river near the town of Chusovoy is contaminated and does not meet the standards for the drinking and sanitary water. In 2006, the content of copper exceeded the maximum permissible concentration (MPC) twice, manganese 8 times, iron 5 times, petroleum 2 times (it was 21 times MPC in 2003) and hexavalent chromium 1.5 times (mostly due to the plant &quot;Chrompic&quot; in Pervouralsk). The biggest polluters of the river are Chusovskoy Steel Works and Chusovskoy Gorvodocanal.

== Tourism ==
Chusovaya has long been known for its rock formations, many of which have poetic names. They pose no dangers to light vessels and attract tourism. A tourist route was formed here in the 1960s and was visited by about 3,000 people per year. In one summer season of the 1980s, several tens of thousands tourists drafted along the river.

The major objects of attraction are the river banks, rocks and their caves and grottoes. Many of these rocks are under state protection as natural monuments. About 200,000 people annually visit the Kungur Cave near Chusovoy. This labyrinth of karst caves was formed as a result of dissolution of gypsum and anhydrites by water at a depth of and is explored only up to about .

<doc id="1010141" wikidata="Q2638955" url="?curid=1010141" title="Gilbreath's conjecture">
<text>Gilbreath&#x27;s conjecture is a conjecture in number theory regarding the sequences generated by applying the forward difference operator to consecutive prime numbers and leaving the results unsigned, and then repeating this process on consecutive terms in the resulting sequence, and so forth. The statement is named after Norman L. Gilbreath who, in 1958, presented it to the mathematical community after observing the pattern by chance while doing arithmetic on a napkin. In 1878, eighty years before Gilbreath&#x27;s discovery, François Proth had, however, published the same observations along with an attempted proof, which was later shown to be incorrect.

== Motivating arithmetic ==

Gilbreath observed a pattern while playing with the ordered sequence of prime numbers

:2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ...

Computing the absolute value of the difference between term &quot;n&quot; + 1 and term &quot;n&quot; in this sequence yields the sequence

:1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2, ...

If the same calculation is done for the terms in this new sequence, and the sequence that is the outcome of this process, and again &quot;ad infinitum&quot; for each sequence that is the output of such a calculation, the following five sequences in this list are

:1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, ...
:1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, ...
:1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, ...
:1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, ...
:1, 2, 0, 0, 2, ...

What Gilbreath—and François Proth before him—noticed is that the first term in each series of differences appears to be 1.

== The conjecture ==

Stating Gilbreath&#x27;s observation formally is significantly easier to do after devising a notation for the sequences in the previous section. Toward this end, let formula_1 denote the ordered sequence of prime numbers, and define each term in the sequence formula_2 by

: formula_3

where formula_4 is positive. Also, for each integer formula_5 greater than 1, let the terms in formula_6 be given by

: formula_7

Gilbreath&#x27;s conjecture states that every term in the sequence formula_8 for positive formula_5 is equal to 1.

== Verification and attempted proofs ==
François Proth released what he believed to be a proof of the statement that was later shown to be flawed. Andrew Odlyzko verified that formula_10 is equal to 1 for formula_11 in 1993, but the conjecture remains an open problem. Instead of evaluating &quot;n&quot; rows, Odlyzko evaluated 635 rows and established that the 635th row started with a 1 and continued with only 0s and 2s for the next &quot;n&quot; numbers. This implies that the next &quot;n&quot; rows begin with a 1.

==Generalizations==
In 1980, Martin Gardner published a conjecture by Hallard Croft that stated that the property of Gilbreath&#x27;s conjecture (having a 1 in the first term of each difference sequence) should hold more generally for every sequence that begins with 2, subsequently contains only odd numbers, and has a sufficiently low bound on the gaps between consecutive elements in the sequence. This conjecture has also been repeated by later authors. However, it is false: for every initial subsequence of 2 and odd numbers, and every non-constant growth rate, there is a continuation of the subsequence by odd numbers whose gaps obey the growth rate but whose difference sequences fail to begin with 1 infinitely often. is more careful, writing of certain heuristic reasons for believing Gilbreath&#x27;s conjecture that &quot;the arguments above apply to many other sequences in which the first element is a 1, the others even, and where the gaps between consecutive elements are not too large and are sufficiently random.&quot; However, he does not give a formal definition of what &quot;sufficiently random&quot; means.

<doc id="1010144" wikidata="Q767987" url="?curid=1010144" title="Frederick Walter Champion">
<text>Frederick Walter Champion (24 August 1893, Surrey – 21 April 1970, Scotland) was a British forester, worked in British India and East Africa and is considered the &#x27;Father of Camera Trap Photography&#x27;. In the UK and India he became famous in the 1920s as one of the first wildlife photographers and conservationists.

== Early life ==
Champion grew up in a family of nature lovers. His father was the English entomologist George Charles Champion. His brother Sir Harry George Champion was also a forester, well known for classifying the forest types of India.

Champion travelled to India in 1913 and served in the Police Department in East Bengal until 1916. He was commissioned into the British Indian Army Reserve of Officers (Cavalry branch) as a second lieutenant on 21 August 1916, promoted temporarily to captain on 8 March 1917 and to lieutenant on 21 August 1917. He saw service with the 31st Lancers and then he was appointed wing officer with the Kurram Militia on 8 March 1917, a Frontier Corps unit based on the North West Frontier of India. He retired a lieutenant but was granted the rank of captain on 1 May 1922.

== Commitment to conservation ==
After returning from the war, he joined the Imperial Forestry Service in the United Provinces of India and became Deputy Conservator of Forests. Owing to his experiences during the war, he abhorred shooting and killing and blisteringly criticised sport hunting. He preferred shooting wildlife with a camera in the Sivalik Hills and pioneered camera trapping: in the 1920s he developed cameras triggered by tripwires. Using a flashlight as well, he obtained dozens of remarkable night-time photographs, which are among the first of wild tigers, leopards, sloth bears, dholes and other wildlife. He recognized that with good photographs of tigers, it was possible to tell individuals apart by their different stripe patterns.

Champion was a passionate conservationist, before conservation became fashionable, and campaigned hard for protection of tigers and their forest habitats. He strongly believed in the protectionist role of the forest department in India. He championed the idea of limiting gun licenses, stopping motor-cars from entering Reserved Forests and reducing rewards for killing wildlife. His commitment to conservation inspired his friend Jim Corbett, among other hunter-turned-conservationists. Together with Corbett, he was a founding member of India&#x27;s first national park established in 1935, which was renamed to Corbett National Park in 1957.

When India became independent in 1947, Champion moved to East Africa, where he continued to work as Divisional Forest Officer for Kilimanjaro and the Serengeti until he retired.

<text>Njurunda () is a small village in Sundsvall Municipality, located in Västernorrland County, Sweden. The village is situated at the mouth of the Ljungan river and located about 17 kilometers south of Sundsvall. It is primarily a sleeper town for Sundsvall, with a residential population of about 5,000 households and about 450 small to medium-sized businesses. The elementary school is Kyrkmons skola, which has about 339 students, most of whom head on to Kvissleby and Nivrenaskolan for their 7th - 9th grades before they finally move on to the secondary schools in Sundsvall.

The town was the seat of the former Nivren rural municipality, which later was swallowed by Sundsvall municipality in the consolidation process during the 1960s. Historically, there have been people living in Njurunda since the 5th century. The population, however, did not grow significantly until the 14th century, but late that century the Black Death halted this growth. Industrialization began around 1830 when several saw mills were established close to the Ljungan, which was used to float logs out to the coast.

The Njurunda area is also home to the ruins of a 12th-century church.

<doc id="1010162" wikidata="Q71537" url="?curid=1010162" title="Benjamin Lebert">
<text>Benjamin Lebert (born 9 January 1982) is a German writer. He was born in Freiburg. His first novel, &quot;Crazy&quot;, was published when Lebert was only 16 years old. The international bestseller about a handicapped teenage rebel has been licensed to 33 nations and was made into a feature film by Hans-Christian Schmid (see here), and has drawn comparisons to Jerome Salinger&#x27;s &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;. In 2003, Lebert published a second novel, &quot;Der Vogel ist ein Rabe&quot; (&quot;The Bird Is a Raven&quot;).

Lebert lives in Hamburg.

==Background==
Benjamin Lebert and his father were close, they bonded over the similar taste of the Rock and Roll lifestyle and music. He was influenced by American pop culture like Pink-Floyd, Jekyll and Hyde (the musical), Rolling Stones, etc. In an interview with the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Lebert said his “father loves [rock and roll], has for centuries...He likes the Rolling Stones -- they&#x27;re a rock group from way back.” The father and son’s love of classic rock influenced Lebert’s writing.

He first began writing journalistic articles for the young-adult supplement of the &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;. 

Lebert is partially paralyzed on the left side of his body since birth. This prevented him from performing basic tasks such as tying his shoes, using utensils, and working with his fine motor skills. When he began to write, it was based on the difficult experiences he faced every day and switching schools. Due to various academic challenges, Lebert attended several schools, including the boarding school that inspired the setting of his best-selling novel &quot;Crazy&quot;. He dropped out of school in ninth grade. After his success with the publication of the novel, he returned to school and graduated.
The novel &quot;Crazy&quot; was based on his struggles while in boarding school and the friendships he made. 

==&quot;Crazy. A Novel&quot;==
The main character is also named Benjamin, nicknamed Benni. The book gets its name from one of the characters, Benni&#x27;s roommate Janosch, who uses &quot;crazy&quot; frequently to describe events they encountered as thrilling and exciting. Benjamin’s friend group uses “crazy” as inspiration for how they want to live life. Like Lebert, Benni suffers from partial paralysis on the left side of his body and struggles achieving passing grades in school. 

Lebert based his novel on his experiences attending boarding school and the people he met while there. The plot centers around Benni and his gang of friends that quickly become his family. Janosch is Benjamin’s roommate, the rest of friends include Fat Felix, Skinny Felix, Florian AKA girl, and Troy. Together the boys get into trouble and explore what it is to grow up. The novel also features Benjamin’s parents and sister. Benjamin’s mother is a doctor of alternative medicines. She protects Benjamin fiercely. Benjamin’s father is an engineer that eventually divorces his wife. He has very high expectations for Benjamin. Benjamin has a great relationship with his sister who always lets him accompany her on adventures with her lesbian friends.

This novel deals with important events such Benjamin exploring his sexuality, how he forms relationships with the other boys, how his disability impacts how he forms these relationships, and the subsequent trouble they cause together. The friends also search for life&#x27;s meaning. Throughout the novel, it is evident that his friends view him as “normal,” but Benjamin constantly thinks he is not and struggles with self-esteem. In the end, he leaves the boarding school having gained some more teenage experiences and friendships. 

The novel was a bestseller and is frequently used as school reading.

Stern Magazine praised the novel: &quot;No one has ever been so right-on in expressing the drama of being young. A sensation.&quot; Some critics claim the novel should not be read by teens, but should be reserved for a more mature audience that is capable of understanding the more mature themes of the novel. Other critics feel that &quot;Crazy&quot; was an accurate representation of teenage rebellion. To also quote a negative voice, a Kirkus Reviews article criticizes the generality of the characters’ adventures, and the repetition of discussions on “life, God, and sex are unfortunately both redundant and banal” The author also dismisses claims made that &quot;Crazy&quot; is similar to &quot;The Catcher and the Rye&quot; by J. D. Salinger, saying, “Salinger’s Catcher remains the gold standard. Crazy is another imitation.”

<doc id="1010164" wikidata="Q13416804" url="?curid=1010164" title="Warner Bros. Animation">
<text>Warner Bros. Animation Inc. (abbreviated as WBA) is an American animation studio which is part of the Warner Bros. Television Group, a division of Warner Bros., which is a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery and serves as the animation division and label of Warner Bros.

As the successor to Warner Bros. Cartoons, which was active from 1933 to 1969, the studio is closely associated with the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; characters, among others. Warner Bros. re-established its animation division in 1980 to produce &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;–related works, and Turner Broadcasting System merged with WBD predecessor Time Warner in 1996. In March 2001, Hanna-Barbera was absorbed into the studio.

In recent years, Warner Bros. Animation has specialized in producing television and direct-to-video animation featuring characters from other properties owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, including Turner Entertainment (which owns the rights to properties originally created by the MGM cartoon studio), Hanna-Barbera, Ruby-Spears, and DC Entertainment.

== History ==
=== 1970–1986: Restarting the studio ===
The original Warner Bros. Cartoons studio, as well as all of Warner Bros.&#x27;s short subject production divisions, closed its doors on October 10, 1969, due to the rising costs and declining returns of short subject production. Outside animation companies were hired to produce new &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;-related animation for TV specials and commercials at irregular intervals. In 1975, Warner Bros. Cartoon alumnus Chuck Jones began producing a series of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; specials at his Chuck Jones Productions animation studio, the first of which was &quot;Carnival of the Animals&quot;. These specials, and a 1975 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; retrospective feature film titled &quot;Bugs Bunny: Superstar&quot; (distributed by United Artists, the previous owner of the pre-1950 Warner Bros. library), led Jones to produce &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie&quot; for Warner Bros. in 1979. This film blended classic &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts with newly produced wraparounds of Bugs Bunny introducing each cartoon. Warner Bros. responded to the success of this film by reestablishing its own cartoon studio.

Warner Bros. Animation opened its doors on March 15, 1980, to produce compilation films and television specials starring the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters. The studio&#x27;s initial head was Hal Geer, who had been the original studio&#x27;s sound effects editor during its final days, and he was soon joined by Friz Freleng, who left DePatie–Freleng (which became Marvel Productions after being sold to Marvel Comics), and returned to Warner as executive producer. The new wraparounds for &quot;The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie&quot; (1981), &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales&quot; (1982) and &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Fantastic Island&quot; (1983) featured footage by a new Warner Bros. Animation staff, composed mainly of veterans from the golden age of WB cartoons, including writers John Dunn and Dave Detiege.

By 1986, Freleng had departed, and Hal Geer also stepped down the following year. Geer was briefly replaced by Steven S. Greene, who in turn was replaced by Freleng&#x27;s former secretary Kathleen Helppie-Shipley, who would spearhead a major revival of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; brand in the years that followed. The studio continued production on special projects starring the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters, sporadically producing new &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts for theaters such as &quot;The Duxorcist&quot; (1987), &quot;Night of the Living Duck&quot; (1988), &quot;Box-Office Bunny&quot; (1990), and &quot;Carrotblanca&quot; (1995). Many of these shorts, as well as the new footage in the compilation film &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Quackbusters&quot; (which includes &quot;The Duxorcist&quot;), were directed by Greg Ford and Terry Lennon, as well as Darrell Van Citters.

=== 1986–1996: Moving into television animation ===
Beginning in 1986, Warner Bros. moved into regular television animation production. Warners&#x27; television division was established by WB Animation President Jean MacCurdy, who brought in producer Tom Ruegger and much of his staff from Hanna-Barbera Productions&#x27; &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot; series (1988–1991). A studio for the television unit was set up in the office tower of the Imperial Bank Building adjacent to the Sherman Oaks Galleria northwest of Los Angeles. Darrell Van Citters, who used to work at Disney, would work at Warner Bros. on the newer Bugs Bunny shorts, before leaving to form Renegade Animation in 1992. The first Warner Bros. original animated TV series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; (1990–1995) was produced in conjunction with Amblin Entertainment, and featured young cartoon characters based upon specific &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; stars, and was a success. Later Amblin/Warner Bros. television shows, including &quot;Animaniacs&quot; (1993–1998), its spin-off &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; (1995–1998), and &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; (1995–1997) followed in continuing the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; tradition of cartoon humor.

Warner Bros. Animation also began developing shows based upon comic book characters owned by sister company DC Comics. These programs, including &quot;&quot; (1992–1995), &quot;&quot; (1996–2000), &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; (1997–1999), &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; (1999–2001), and &quot;Justice League/Justice League Unlimited&quot; (2001–2006) proved popular among both children and adults. These shows were part of the DC animated universe. A &quot;Batman&quot; spin-off feature, &quot;&quot;, was produced in 1993 and bumped up to theatrical release. The film was near universally-well received by critics but performed poorly at the box-office, though it eventually became a commercial success through its subsequent home video releases. In 2003, Warner Bros. Television Animation was folded and was subsequently merged with Warner Bros. Animation.

==== 1990–2004: Warner Bros. Feature Animation ====
During the rise of the animation renaissance in the early 1990s, Warner Bros. distributed its first animated films: &quot;The Nutcracker Prince&quot; in 1990, which is a Canadian-produced feature film based on E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s classic holiday tale &quot;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King&quot;; and &quot;Rover Dangerfield&quot; in 1991, whose title character is a dog whose look and mannerisms are inspired by his voice actor Rodney Dangerfield. Both films received negative reviews and under-performed at the box office due to lack of promotion. Three years later after the release of &quot;Rover Dangerfield&quot;, Warner distributed Don Bluth&#x27;s &quot;Thumbelina&quot;, which also received mixed reviews from critics and under-performed at the box office.

That same year, Warner Bros., as well as several other Hollywood studios, moved into feature animation following the success of Walt Disney Feature Animation&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Max Howard, a Disney alumnus, was brought in to head the new division, which was set up in Sherman Oaks near the television studio in nearby Glendale. Turner Feature Animation, later merged and named Warner Bros. Feature Animation, like all of the in-house feature animation studios, proved an unsuccessful venture, as five of the six films, under-performed during its original theatrical releases (due to lack of promotion).

The first of Warner&#x27;s animated features was &quot;Space Jam&quot; (1996), a live-action/animated hybrid which starred NBA star Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny (Jordan had previously appeared with the Looney Tunes in a number of Nike commercials). The film featured live-action sequences directed by Joe Pytka and animated sequences directed by Bruce W. Smith and Tony Cervone. &quot;Space Jam&quot; received mixed reviews from critics but proved to be a success at the box office. Animation production for &quot;Space Jam&quot; was primarily done at the new Sherman Oaks studio, although much of the work was outsourced to animation studios around the world.

Before the success of &quot;Space Jam&quot;, a Turner Entertainment-run studio that spun off from Hanna-Barbera were already producing animated features following the success of the Disney features. The first was &quot;The Pagemaster&quot;, a fantasy adventure directed by Joe Johnston (live-action) and Maurice Hunt (animation) that starred the performances of Macaulay Culkin and Christopher Lloyd with the live-action segments serving as bookends for the film&#x27;s story. Released by 20th Century Fox, the film under-performed and received negative reviews from critics during its holiday release of 1994. After the merger with Turner and Warner Bros.&#x27;s parent company Time Warner in 1996, Turner Feature Animation completed its second and last feature, &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1997), directed by Mark Dindal, which was met with warm critical and audience reception but under-performed due to little marketing and fanfare. By the time of the film&#x27;s release, however, Turner Feature Animation had merged with Warner Bros. Feature Animation and transferred a majority of its staff from said studio, making &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; the second film from Warner Bros. Feature Animation.

The following year, its third film, Frederik Du Chau&#x27;s &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; (1998), underwent production difficulties and also received mixed reviews from critics. However, its soundtrack (such as one of the songs, &quot;The Prayer&quot;) received some praise and accolades, including an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe win.

The fourth animated feature from Warner Bros. Feature Animation, Brad Bird&#x27;s &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1999), received widespread acclaimed reception from critics and audiences. However, the studio decided to rush its release to the end of the summer with a rushed marketing push.

The studio&#x27;s next film, &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot; (2001), was another animated/live-action mix that suffered through another troubled production. This time, the animation sequences, directed by Piet Kroon and Tom Sito, were completed long before the live-action parts were filmed, eventually directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly and starring Bill Murray. The resulting film received mixed reviews and underperformed, although it was successful enough on home video for Warner&#x27;s Television Animation department to produce a related Saturday morning cartoon, &quot;Ozzy &amp; Drix&quot; (2002–2004) for its WB broadcast network.

Following the releases of &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; and &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot;, the feature animation staff was scaled back, and the entire animation staff – feature and television – were moved to the larger Sherman Oaks facility.

Warner Bros. Feature Animation&#x27;s sixth and final project, &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; was released in 2003. It was intended to be the starting point for a reestablishment of the classic cartoons brands, including a planned series of new &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; theatrical shorts, produced by &quot;Back in Action&quot; writer and producer Larry Doyle. After &quot;Back in Action&quot;, directed by Joe Dante (live-action) and Eric Goldberg (animation), received mixed reviews from critics and under-performed at the box office, production was shut down on the new shorts, and, in 2004, Warner Bros. Feature Animation was folded and merged into Warner Bros. Animation, and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; has been mostly relegated on television until 2021&#x27;s &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;.

: Combines live-action with animation.

=== 1996–2019: Acquisitions of libraries ===
Warners&#x27; parent company Time Warner merged with Turner Broadcasting System in 1996, not only regaining the rights to the previously sold &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts but also taking on two more animation studios: Turner Feature Animation and Hanna-Barbera Productions. Turner Feature was immediately folded into Warner Bros. Feature Animation, while Hanna-Barbera merged with Warner Bros. Animation itself. Until 1998, Hanna-Barbera operated on its original lot at 3400 Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood, California, one of the last &quot;big name&quot; studios with a Hollywood zip code. Studio operations, archives, and its extensive animation art collection were then moved northwest to Sherman Oaks. Hanna-Barbera occupied space in the office tower adjacent to the Sherman Oaks Galleria along with Warner Bros. Animation.

Following the death of William Hanna in 2001, Warner fully took over production of H-B related properties such as &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, producing a steady stream of &quot;Scooby&quot; direct-to-video films and two new series, &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot; (2002–2006) and &quot;Shaggy &amp; Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!&quot; (2006–2008). The Turner merger also gave WB access to the pre-May 1986 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library, which included its classic cartoon library (including such characters as Tom and Jerry (originally created by the H-B duo), Droopy, Barney Bear, Screwy Squirrel, and George and Junior). WBA has since co-produced a series of direct-to-video films with Turner which starred Tom and Jerry. Besides producing content for the daytime market, Warner Bros. Animation also produced &quot;Baby Blues&quot; with sister company Warner Bros. Television and &quot;3-South&quot; with MTV Animation for primetime.

The series which Hanna-Barbera had been producing for Turner&#x27;s Cartoon Network before and during the Time Warner/Turner merger were shifted to production at Cartoon Network Studios, a sister company to Warner Bros. Animation. WBA is today exclusively involved in the production of animated television programming and direct-to-video features. It produced many of the shows airing on the Kids&#x27; WB Saturday morning programming block of The CW until May 24, 2008. These programs included &quot;Shaggy &amp; Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!&quot;, &quot;Krypto the Superdog&quot;, &quot;Xiaolin Showdown&quot;, &quot;The Batman&quot;, and the aforementioned &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot; and &quot;Tom and Jerry Tales&quot;. By 2007, the studio had downsized significantly from its size during the late 1990s. Warner Bros. downsized the studio further in June, shut down the Sherman Oaks studio, and had Warner Bros. Animation moved to the Warner Bros. Ranch in Burbank, California. In early 2008 after the demise of Kids&#x27; WB!, Warner Bros. Animation became almost dormant with only &quot;&quot; in production at the time.

To expand the company&#x27;s online content presence, Warner Bros. Animation launched the new KidsWB.com (announced as T-Works) on April 28, 2008. The website gathers its core animation properties in a single online environment that is interactive and customizable for site visitors. The Kids&#x27; WB website offers both originally produced content along with classic animated episodes, games, and exploration of virtual worlds. Some of the characters to be used in the project from the Warner libraries include those of Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera, pre-1986 MGM animated characters and DC Comics.

In 2009, sister network Cartoon Network announced &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot; in the Fall 2009–2010 season by Warner Bros. Animation. Warner Bros. Animation recently announced several new projects, such as &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; (formerly called &quot;Laff Riot&quot;); a reboot of &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, and several series based on DC Comics properties such as &quot;MAD&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, and &quot;Young Justice&quot;.

Warner Bros. Animation is also producing &quot;DC Showcase&quot;, a series of short subjects featuring lesser-known comic book superheroes, to be released in tandem with direct-to-video films based on DC Comics properties.

On July 30, 2010, &quot;Coyote Falls&quot;, a 3D cartoon featuring Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner was released, being the first time WB Animation produced theatrically released content since &quot;The Karate Guard&quot; (the last Tom and Jerry short) in 2005, and the first time the animation studio used full CGI and stereoscopic 3D. Two more theatrical Road Runner cartoons have followed during the year (&quot;Fur of Flying&quot; and &quot;Rabid Rider&quot;). On June 8, 2011, three more shorts were announced: &quot;I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat&quot; with Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny, which was released with &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot;; &quot;Daffy&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; with Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd, which was released with &quot;Journey 2: The Mysterious Island&quot;; and &quot;Flash in the Pain&quot; starring Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. All of these 6 shorts, directed by Matthew O&#x27;Callaghan and produced by Reel FX Creative Studios are available on the official Warner Bros. Animation YouTube channel.

On October 27, 2014, Warner Bros. Animation collaborated with sister studio Williams Street for the first time for its first production for Adult Swim, &quot;Mike Tyson Mysteries&quot;, which satirizes the style and conventions of cartoons from the 1970s (such as &quot;Scooby-Doo)&quot; and celebrity-driven series such as &quot;Mister T&quot;. Warner Bros. Animation also produced &quot;—&quot;a stop-motion animated adaptation of the New Line Cinema film &quot;Elf&quot; and its musical adaptation—as a Christmas special for NBC, starring Jim Parsons.

=== 2019–present: Reconstruction with animation ===
On June 11, 2018, a new series of shorts, &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;, was announced by Warner Bros. Animation. Set for release in 2019 on both linear and streaming television platforms, its first &quot;season&quot; would feature 1,000 minutes (or 16 hours and 40 minutes) of new one-to-six minute cartoons featuring the brand&#x27;s marquee characters, voiced by their current voice actors in &quot;simple, gag-driven and visually vibrant stories&quot; that are rendered by multiple artists employing &quot;a visual style that will resonate with fans.&quot; Sam Register, president of Warner Bros. Animation, and Peter Browngardt, creator of &quot;Secret Mountain Fort Awesome&quot; and &quot;Uncle Grandpa&quot;, would serve as executive producers.

In August 2021, it was announced that Jason DeMarco had been named SVP Anime &amp; Action Series/Longform for Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios.

On May 11, 2022, Warner Bros. Animation was moved under Warner Bros. Television after the dissolution of the Warner Bros. Global Kids, Young Adults and Classics division by new owner Warner Bros. Discovery.

On October 11, 2022, Warner Bros. Animation merged its development and production teams with Cartoon Network Studios as part of a further restructuring by Warner Bros. Discovery; the merger would not affect the studios&#x27; output or branding.

<doc id="1010167" wikidata="Q422752" url="?curid=1010167" title="Ceruloplasmin">
<text>Ceruloplasmin (or caeruloplasmin) is a ferroxidase enzyme that in humans is encoded by the &quot;CP&quot; gene.

Ceruloplasmin is the major copper-carrying protein in the blood, and in addition plays a role in iron metabolism. It was first described in 1948. Another protein, hephaestin, is noted for its homology to ceruloplasmin, and also participates in iron and probably copper metabolism.

== Function ==

Ceruloplasmin (CP) is an enzyme () synthesized in the liver containing 6 atoms of copper in its structure. Ceruloplasmin carries more than 95% of the total copper in healthy human plasma. The rest is accounted for by macroglobulins. Ceruloplasmin exhibits a copper-dependent oxidase activity, which is associated with possible oxidation of Fe2+ (ferrous iron) into Fe3+ (ferric iron), therefore assisting in its transport in the plasma in association with transferrin, which can carry iron only in the ferric state. The molecular weight of human ceruloplasmin is reported to be 151kDa.

Despite extensive research, much is still unknown about the exact functions of CP, most of the functions are attributed to CP focus on the presence of the Cu centers. These include copper transport to deliver the Cu to extrahepatic tissues, amine oxidase activity that controls the level of biogenic amines in intestinal fluids and plasma, removal of oxygen and other free radicals from plasma, and the export of iron from cells for transport through transferrin.

Mutations have been known to disrupt the binding of copper to CP and will disrupt iron metabolism and cause an iron overload.

Ceruloplasmin is a relatively large enzyme (~10 nm); the larger size prevents the bound copper from being lost in a person&#x27;s urine during transport.

== Active site structure ==
The multicopper active site of CP contains a type I (T1) mononuclear copper site and a trinuclear copper center ~ 12-13 Å away (see figure 2).  The tricopper center consists of two type III (T3) coppers and one type II (T2) copper ion.  The two T3 copper ions are bridged by a hydroxide ligand while another hydroxide ligand links the T2 copper ion to the protein.  The T1 center is bridged to the tricopper center by two histidine (His1020, His1022) residues and one Cys(1021) residue.  The substrate binds near the T1 center and is oxidized by the T1 Cu2+ ion forming the reduced Cu+ oxidation state.  The reduced T1 Cu+ then transfers the electron through the one Cys and two His bridging residues to the tricopper center.  After four electrons have been transferred from the substrates to the copper centers, an O2 binds at the tricopper center and undergoes a four-electron reduction to form two molecules of water.
==Regulation==

A cis-regulatory element called the GAIT element is involved in the selective translational silencing of the Ceruloplasmin transcript.
The silencing requires binding of a cytosolic inhibitor complex called IFN-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) to the GAIT element.

== Clinical significance ==

Like any other plasma protein, levels drop in patients with hepatic disease due to reduced synthesizing capabilities.

Mechanisms of low ceruloplasmin levels:
* Gene expression genetically low (aceruloplasminemia)
* Copper levels are low in general
** Malnutrition/trace metal deficiency in the food source
** Zinc toxicity, due to induced copper deficiency
* Copper does not cross the intestinal barrier due to ATP7A deficiency (Menkes disease and Occipital horn syndrome)
* Delivery of copper into the lumen of the ER-Golgi network is absent in hepatocytes due to absent ATP7B (Wilson&#x27;s disease)

Copper availability doesn&#x27;t affect the translation of the nascent protein. However, the apoenzyme without copper is unstable. Apoceruloplasmin is largely degraded intracellularly in the hepatocyte and the small amount that is released has a short circulation half life of 5 hours as compared to the 5.5 days for the holo-ceruloplasmin.

Ceruloplasmin can be measured by means of a blood test; this can be done using immunoassays . The sample is spun and separated; it is stored around 4 °C Celsius for three days. This test is to determine if there are signs of Wilson disease. Another test that can be done is a urine copper level test; this has been found to be less accurate than the blood test. A liver tissue test can be done as well.

Mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene (&quot;CP&quot;), which are very rare, can lead to the genetic disease aceruloplasminemia, characterized by hyperferritinemia with iron overload. In the brain, this iron overload may lead to characteristic neurologic signs and symptoms, such as cerebellar ataxia, progressive dementia, and extrapyramidal signs. Excess iron may also deposit in the liver, pancreas, and retina, leading to cirrhosis, endocrine abnormalities, and loss of vision, respectively.

=== Deficiency ===

Lower-than-normal ceruloplasmin levels may indicate the following:
* Wilson disease (a rare [UK incidence 2/100,000] copper storage disease).
* Menkes disease (Menkes kinky hair syndrome) (rare – UK incidence 1/100,000)
* Copper deficiency
* Aceruloplasminemia
* Zinc toxicity

=== Excess ===

Greater-than-normal ceruloplasmin levels may indicate or be noticed in:
* copper toxicity / zinc deficiency
* pregnancy
* oral contraceptive pill use
* lymphoma
* acute and chronic inflammation (it is an acute-phase reactant)
* rheumatoid arthritis
* Angina
* Alzheimer&#x27;s disease
* Schizophrenia
* Obsessive-compulsive disorder

=== Reference ranges ===

Normal blood concentration of ceruloplasmin in humans is 20–50 mg/dL.

<doc id="1010169" wikidata="Q11864082" url="?curid=1010169" title="Tavastians">
<text>The Tavastians (; ) were an ancient Finnish tribe that inhabited the historical province of Tavastia (). In Russian sources, they are called &quot;Yem&quot; (Емь) or &quot;Yam&quot; (Ямь), but the term later disappeared from the Russian language after Finland was incorporated into the Swedish realm. The Tavastians are often noted for their conflicts with Novgorod.

The Tavastians are also a modern subgroup of the Finnish people, distinguished by their use of Tavastian dialects.

== History ==
Tavastia () has been inhabited since the early Stone Age. The core area of ancient Tavastia was formed around Lake Vanajavesi. Example of organized cooperation of iron age Tavastians are the hillforts that form a clear line in south-north direction around Hämeenlinna. Most remarkable from these hillforts is the Rapola Castle which is the biggest hillfort found in Finland, but also Tenhola hillfort in Hattula and Hakoinen Castle were important fortresses. Villages were often developed around the fortresses and for example Hattula and Vanaja-Janakkala had their beginning in this way. In historical sources Tavastians are first time mentioned in 1042.

Possibly the oldest known road of Finland, Hämeen härkätie (&#x27;Oxen Road of Tavastia&#x27;) connected Tavastia with the western coast of Finland. First signs of Christianity can be dated to the 11th century.

The &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; describes Tavastians in frequent conflicts with Novgorod and Karelians as well as other Baltic Finns from the 11th to 14th centuries.

The album reached #127 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. It was the band&#x27;s final album with the lineup consisting of Ivan Doroschuk (vocals), Stefan Doroschuk (guitar), Colin Doroschuk (keyboards) and Allan McCarthy (keyboards).

During the recording process, &quot;The Safety Dance&quot; became big in America, requiring the band to put recording on hold and do a tour.

This album was re-released on CD in Canada in 1997 by Oglio Records as part of a &quot;two-fer&quot; including &quot;Rhythm of Youth&quot;.

It was also re-mastered and re-released in Canada in 2010 by Bulldog Brothers/Unidisc. In addition to the tracks on the LP, it also contains an extended version of &quot;Where Do The Boys Go?&quot;. The extended version of &quot;Where Do the Boys Go?&quot; was intended to be used on the original CD release by Statik in 1984, but was left off.

<text>Senegambia, officially the Senegambia Confederation or Confederation of Senegambia, was a loose confederation in the late 20th century between the West African countries of Senegal and its neighbour The Gambia, which is almost completely surrounded by Senegal. The confederation was founded on 1 February 1982 following an agreement between the two countries signed on 12 December 1981. It was intended to promote cooperation between the two countries, but was dissolved by Senegal on 30 September 1989 after The Gambia refused to move closer toward union. The Senegambia Confederation should not be confused with the historic Senegambia region, generally shortened to &quot;the Senegambia&quot;.

== Background ==
=== Early history ===
As a political unit, Senegambia was created by duelling French and English colonial forces in the region. Competition between the French and English started in the late 16th century when merchants from both nations started to establish trading centres in the region. Although there was some overlap in their areas of influence, French trade centred on the Senegal River and the Cap-Vert region and English trade on the Gambia River. As European trading activities in the region intensified, Senegambia quickly became a major African center of the Atlantic triangular trade, with merchants from Europe bringing manufactured goods to trade for gold, ivory and slaves.

During various periods of conflict between the British and the French in the 18th century, the trading posts of both nations in Senegambia quickly became military targets. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, American merchant Thomas Cumming convinced Southern Secretary William Pitt to dispatch a British expeditionary force to capture French trading posts in Senegal; after the expedition was successful, the region under British occupation was transformed into the crown colony of Senegambia. The unified region collapsed in 1779. With the British occupied by the American War of Independence in North America, the French recaptured Saint Louis and destroyed the largest British trading post in the Gambia region. The unified region ended officially in 1783 in the aftermath of the British defeat by and independence of the United States.

The Treaty of Versailles (signed along with the Treaty of Paris that officially ended the American War of Independence) created a balance between France and Britain: Saint Louis, l&#x27;île de Gorée and the Senegal River region were restored to France, and the Gambia was left to the British. In the 1860s and 1870s, both nations began to consider a land-trading proposal to unify the region, with the French trading another West African holding for the Gambia, but the exchange was never completed. Although the areas were ruled by separate, competing powers, they did not determine an official border between the French and British Senegambian colonies until 1889. At the time, France agreed to accept the current border between the two countries and remove its border trading posts.

This decision resulted in the future Senegal (which gained its independence from France in 1960) and the Gambia (which gained independence from Britain in 1965) sharing a large problem: how to successfully maintain two separate countries in a region with shared yet diverse cultural values, and one nation virtually surrounded by another.

=== Prelude of the confederation ===
For each country, the &quot;lock and key&quot; border situation has posed unique problems for international relations, especially in trade and control of regions surrounding the Senegal–Gambia border. Since the end of colonization, the Senegalese government had maintained trade barriers that provided preferential treatment for French goods imported into the country, while the Gambia had virtually no trade barriers. The opposing trade policies fueled a large black market around the Senegal–Gambia border, which brought cheaper manufactured goods into Senegal. The black market also attracted an export drain into the Gambia. The Senegalese government began to institute a delayed payment system with its groundnut (peanut) farms. When farmers sold their harvest to the Senegalese government, they would get a voucher, known as a chit, which they could turn into cash after a three-month waiting period. Not wanting to wait for the Senegalese marketing system to pay them, more farmers began to smuggle their goods to Banjul, where the Gambian government paid in cash. An even greater issue for both countries was the ease with which violence could spread through the region. With shared ethnic communities on both sides of the border, a successful coup in one country could lead to a group of sympathizers in the other, bringing danger to the democratic regimes of both countries.

This fear was realized during the 1981 coup attempt to oust President Dawda Jawara of the Gambia. Though the coup attempt was not well organized and quickly fell apart, it resulted in a prolonged period of instability and violence in the Gambia, as the rebels released many criminals from prisons and armed them in hopes that they would support the uprising. Per an existing defense agreement, Jawara requested Senegal to help him in defeating the coup. The Senegalese government responded vigorously, sending hundreds or even thousands of soldiers and put down the insurrection. This strong reaction was probably motivated by Senegal&#x27;s own security concerns; its pro-Western stance caused tensions with other African states, and it was feared that neighbouring countries might use the Gambia, secessionists in the Casamance region (the region of Senegal south of the Gambian border), or other dissident groups to destabilize the Senegalese government. Specific threats came from Kwame Nkrumah&#x27;s Ghana, Moussa Traoré&#x27;s Mali, Ahmed Sékou Touré&#x27;s Guinea, João Bernardo Vieira&#x27;s Guinea-Bissau, and Muammar al-Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya. While the Senegalese government speculated about some dangers, in the late 1980s it had border skirmishes with Mauritania.

After the coup attempt in the Gambia, its government realized that its security forces were not adequate to stop or prevent political upheaval. Security of the region was becoming more and more difficult to maintain. The Gambia had previously lacked a proper army, instead solely relying on a police force, and subsequently began to set up its own military. Despite this, the Gambian government still felt the need to improve its position, and thus began to support a union with Senegal. This prospect also found renewed interest in Senegal. Léopold Sédar Senghor, first President of Senegal, was one of &quot;&quot; (&quot;the three fathers&quot;) of Negritude—a literary and ideologically socialist movement of pan-Africanism, encouraging Africans throughout the Diaspora to embrace their shared culture. Senghor&#x27;s belief in Negritude informed the possibility of unification between Senegal and the Gambia, and fostered the belief that unification would happen as an organic process. In fact, Senegal and the Gambia had already commissioned a United Nations report to study the possible plans and benefits of unification between the two countries in the 1960s.

==Period of the Confederation==
=== Union and early issues ===
In December 1981, Senegal and the Gambia signed an agreement to form a confederation which officially came into existence on 1 February 1982. The two countries agreed to unite their militaries, security forces, economies and monetary systems. Politically, Senegal and the Gambia maintained separate cabinets, though shared power in a confederate government, with a Senegalese serving as president and a Gambian serving as vice-president. In the short term, the Senegambia Confederation was a pragmatic union based on a mutual security interest. As noted, the Senegalese government feared national instability caused by uprisings in either the Gambia or the Casamance region. The attempted coup resulted in both countries&#x27; leaders promoting the unification ideas which had been developing in the region.

However, there were early issues in regards to the Senegambia Confederation. The new union proved to be &quot;largely ceremonial&quot; in many regards, and neither member state was satisfied with its conditions. Hughes and Lewis, in their Senegambia analysis, list many problems with unions which often lead to failure, which this union shared. Throughout the integration process, support came primarily from the two governments and their social elites; neither the Senegalese nor the Gambian people at large were particularly interested in integration. In addition, the Gambian government (and the Gambian people) began to fear losing their own power and identity through Senegalese engulfment.

One early problem was the integration of the security forces, as the Gambia still had no military. Gambian President Jawara, though initially supportive of the confederation, was much less enthusiastic about creating a Gambian army. The Senegalese government probably had to pressure him into organizing his own military, as it did not want to assume sole responsibility for the security of the Gambia. The Gambia finally created a military, in form of the Gambia National Army and Gambian National Gendarmerie, in 1983. In turn, parts of these new units became part of the Confederal Army which consisted of two-thirds Senegalese and one-third Gambian soldiers. As the Gambian government was reluctant to heavily invest in its military to match Senegal&#x27;s security spending, the Confederal Army remained Senegalese-dominated and Gambians junior partners. Key positions in the Gambia such as the airport, harbor, and even the protection of Jawara himself thus remained the responsibility of Senegalese soldiers. Ironically, this caused opposition parties to claim that the confederation was threatening the Gambia&#x27;s national sovereignty and economy.

=== Growing conflicts over economic issues and collapse ===
The greatest tensions grew in regards to economic issues. According to Arnold Hughes, the Gambians had two primary concerns: one was a reluctance to fully integrate economically, and the other worried that the Senegalese would opt for a unitary Senegambian state rather than a confederation. In general, the economic policies of the two states did not match well; whereas Senegal had traditionally favored a centralized, almost mercantilistic economy, the Gambia relied on free trade and low tariffs. In January 1984, Senegal proposed a customs and monetary union; it hoped that the confederation could be transformed into an economically united state, as they wanted to shut down the Gambian reexport trade and build a trans-Gambian highway and bridge to connect the rest of Senegal with its southern provinces. The Gambia opposed the customs union, and initially the monetary union as well. It saw the trans-Gambian highway and bridge project as a threat to its sovereignty and feared the loss of revenue generated by Gambian trade with Senegal&#x27;s southern provinces as well as ferry services of the Gambia River. Ultimately, Senegal and the Gambia continued to compete economically instead of cooperating for the duration of the confederation.

The mounting tensions gradually undermined the confederation. Discussions about implementing a customs and monetary union continued to stall to the frustration of Senegal&#x27;s government. In early 1986, an economic crisis and foreign exchange shortages seemed to push the Gambians to finally consider adopting the West African CFA franc, used by Senegal. The latter offered that its membership in the West African Monetary Union could be transferred to the Senegambia Confederation, so that both Senegal and the Gambia were automatically members. The Gambians rejected this, instead demanding that their country join the West African Monetary Union as an independent member. As a result of these differences, the monetary and customs union were never achieved. Around 1987, President Abdou Diouf greatly upset the Gambians when he declared in a speech that the Gambia had been an &quot;accident of history&quot;.

Eventually, disputes erupted over the rotation of the confederal presidency. In August 1989, Senegal unilaterally pulled out its troops from the Gambia when it was threatened by Mauritania. The Gambia felt its interests were not being protected, and initiated legal measures to dissolve the union. The end came on 23 August 1989, when President Diouf decided it was best that the confederation be placed aside after the talks about a customs union remain fruitless. The eight-year Senegambia Confederation was one of the longest-lived African unions of the period.

===Legacy===
In the Gambia, the end of the confederation had little impact on the national economy, but considerably changed the local political and security situation. With the removal of the Senegalese troops, the Gambian government had to rely for the first time solely on its own military which was already internally divided and suffered from considerable unrest over favoritism and other issues. These problems resulted in repeated mutinies of Gambian soldiers and ultimately led to a coup d&#x27;état during which Yahya Jammeh overthrew Jawara.

In Senegal, the confederation&#x27;s end resulted in worsening the living conditions of the Casamance region&#x27;s population, as the latter had economically benefited from the union. This caused tensions which helped militant separatists, most importantly the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MDFC), to grow in strength and thus partially contributed to the outbreak of the armed Casamance conflict. After Jammeh took power in 1994, the Gambia began to provide substantial support to the MDFC insurgency.

The collapse of the confederation meant that the area&#x27;s black market and large-scale smuggling continued; by 1990, estimates show that 20% of the Gambian groundnut market was from smuggled Senegalese crops. Smuggling became one of the major sources of income for the MDFC rebels. In 2020, Gambia was among the five largest global exporters of rosewood, despite declaring its own stocks close to extinction in the 2010s, thanks to timber illegally harvested in and smuggled from Casamance.

== Politics ==
=== Government ===
Though Senegal and the Gambia maintained their own national governments, a confederate cabinet was also formed. Per the 1981 agreement, a Senegalese would always serve as the President and a Gambian as the vice-president of Senegambia. Both countries agreed to coordinate their defense and foreign policies. A confederal parliament and permanent secretariat were also organized; the former began meeting for one month annually from 1984. The Senegambia Permanent Secretariat was responsible for implementing the various agreements of the two countries.

In 1985, the Senegambian government consisted of the following individuals:

#President Abdou Diouf (Senegalese)
#Vice President Dawda Jawara (Gambian)
#Minister of Defense Médoune Fall (Senegalese)
#Minister of Economic Affairs Momodou S.K. Manneh (Gambian)
#Minister of Finance Sheriff Saikula Sisay (Gambian)
#Minister of Foreign Affairs Ibrahima Fall (Senegalese)
#Minister of Information Djibo Leyti Kâ (Senegalese)
#Minister of Security Ibrahima Wone (Senegalese)
#Minister of Transportation Robert Sagna (Senegalese)
#Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Lamin Kiti Jabang (Gambian)
#Deputy Minister of Security Alieu Badji (Gambian)
=== Military ===
Senegambia Confederation relied on three militaries: The Confederal Army, the Senegalese military, and the Gambian military. While the latter two remained national forces, the Confederal Army was organized from 1983/84 as integrated force of the confederation. It was composed of two-thirds Senegalese and one-third Gambian soldiers, and supposed to deploy anywhere within the confederation. In the Gambia, the Confederal Army quickly assumed a position of prestige. As living costs were much higher in Senegal than the Gambia, the pay grade in the Senegalese military was higher than in the Gambian military. The Confederal Army&#x27;s pay grade was adjusted to fit the Senegalese standards, meaning that Gambian troops in the Confederal Army were paid better than in the national Gambian military. The Confederal Army also had higher training standards than the Gambian military. As a result, positions in the Confederal Army were highly coveted among Gambians; selection officers exploited this to their own favor, leading to favoritism and corruption. Regardless of these issues, the Gambia never matched the resources or manpower invested by Senegal into the Confederal Army; the latter thus always remained dominated by Senegalese.

<text>The State Duma is the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia, the upper house being the Federation Council. It was established by the Constitution of the Russian Federation in 1993.

The Duma headquarters are located in central Moscow, a few steps from Manege Square. Its members are referred to as deputies. The State Duma replaced the Supreme Soviet as a result of the new constitution introduced by Boris Yeltsin in the aftermath of the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993, and approved in a nationwide referendum.

In the 2007 and 2011 Russian legislative elections a full party-list proportional representation with 7% electoral threshold system was used, but this was subsequently repealed. The legislature&#x27;s term length was initially 2 years in the 1993–1995 elections period, and 4 years in 1999–2007 elections period; since the 2011 elections the term length is 5 years.

==History==
===Early history===

The history of the duma dates back to the boyar dumas of Kievan Rus&#x27; and Muscovite Russia as well Tsarist Russia. The State Duma of the Russian Empire was founded in 1905 after the violence and upheaval in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and was Russia&#x27;s first elected parliament. The first two attempts by Tsar Nicholas II (1868–1918) to make it active were ineffective. Subsequently, each of these Dumas was dissolved after only a few months. The third Duma was the only one to last until the end of its five-year term.
After the 1907 electoral reform, the third Duma, elected in November 1907, was largely made up of members of the upper classes, as radical influences in the Duma had almost entirely been removed. The establishment of the Duma after the 1905 Revolution was to herald significant changes to the previous Russian Imperial autocratic system. Furthermore, the Duma was later to have an important effect on Russian history, as it was one of the contributing factors in the February Revolution of 1917, the first of two that year, which led to the abolition of the Tsarist autocracy in Russia and the overthrow of the Tsardom.

===Recent history===
====1990s====
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, the Soviet system of government was abolished and a new Constitution was introduced and approved by a referendum. The new Charter transformed the Russian Federation into a federal semi-presidential republic, with a bicameral parliament composed by the State Duma and the Federation Council.

In the December 1993 elections pro-Yeltsin parties won 175 seats in the Duma versus 125 seats for the left bloc. The balance of power lay with the sixty-four deputies of the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. Only parties that won more than five percent of the vote were given party-list seats: eight passed the threshold in 1993. In addition to those eight parties, a pool of thirty-five deputies was entitled to form a registered group to reflect regional or sectoral interests. Business was governed by a steering committee, the Duma Council, consisting of one person from each party or group. The most important task was dividing up the chair positions in the Duma&#x27;s twenty-three committees, which was done as part of a power-sharing &quot;package&quot; deal.

Despite the fact that the Russian Constitution states that the State Duma is elected for four years, it was decided to elect the first State Duma for two years. The 1995 election resulted in a strong boost for the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, which became the first political party of Russia and elected 157 seats: a Communist, Gennady Seleznyov, was elected as Speaker of the State Duma. The &quot;presidential party&quot; Our Home – Russia won 55 seats.

During the second half of the 1990s, the Duma became an important forum for lobbying by regional leaders and businessmen looking for tax breaks and legislative favors. The work of the leading committees, such as those for defense, foreign affairs, or budget, attracted a good deal of media attention and lobbying activity.

====2000s====
In the early 2000s, following the 1999 parliamentary elections, the pro-presidential Unity party and the Communist Party were the leading forces in the State Duma.

After the 2003 elections, a dominant-party system was established with the newly formed pro-presidential United Russia party dominating. In all subsequent elections, United Russia has always received an absolute majority of seats (more than 226). During the presidency of Vladimir Putin, the State Duma became increasingly referred to as a rubber stamp, with there being a shift to electoral authoritarianism.

After the 2007 elections, a four-party system was formed with a United Russia, Communist Party, Liberal Democratic Party and A Just Russia. Other parties could not get enough votes to go to the State Duma. Only in 2016 elections, two other parties, Rodina and the Civic Platform, were able to get one seat.

In 2008, after the adoption of amendments to the Constitution, the term of the State Duma was increased from four to five years.

====2010s====
A 2016 exposé by Dissernet showed that one in nine members of the State Duma had obtained academic degrees with theses that were substantially plagiarized and likely ghostwritten.

In 2018, it became known that the State Duma building will be reconstructed. In March 2019 it became known that the repair will begin in May 2019 and will end in September 2020. During this period, the State Duma was temporarily housed in the House of Unions. In addition, a draft of a new conference room, which would be an amphitheatre, was presented.

==== 2020s ====
After the 2021 elections, in addition to the four main parties, the New People party was also elected to the State Duma. Thus, for the first time since 1999, a five-party State Duma was formed.

==Powers of the State Duma==
The State Duma has special powers enumerated by the Constitution of Russia. They are:

* Consent to the appointment of the Prime Minister of Russia.
* Hearing annual reports from the Government of the Russian Federation on the results of its work, including on issues raised by the State Duma.
* Deciding the issue of confidence in the Government of the Russian Federation.
* Appointment and dismissal of the Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia.
* Appointment and dismissal of the Chairman and half of the auditors of the Accounts Chamber.
* Appointment and dismissal of the Commissioner for Human rights, who shall act according to federal constitutional law.
* Announcement of amnesty.
* Bringing charges against the President of the Russian Federation for his impeachment (requires a two-thirds majority).

The State Duma adopts decrees on issues relating to its authority by the Constitution of the Russian Federation.

== Election ==

The legal framework that is used to elect Duma differed over the years. Except for parliamentary election of 2007 and election of 2011, the mixed system of parallel voting was used to elect Duma. The system was restored back in February 2014 from a party-list proportional representation system enacted in 2003 with an increased threshold of 7% which was lowered this time to 5%.

=== Constituencies ===

According to the law adopted in 2014 the Russian territory is divided into constituencies which are used for elections of single candidates per constituency. However, a single &quot;united&quot; constituency is used for the distribution of party-list.

== Procedures ==

=== Bills and laws ===
Bills of the State Duma are adopted by a majority of the total number of deputies of the State Duma, unless another procedure is envisaged by the Constitution. All bills are first approved by the State Duma and are further debated and approved (or rejected) by the Federation Council.

Relatively few roll call votes have been published that identify individual deputies&#x27; votes. The votes of individuals are recorded only if the voting is open and the electronic method is used. While not all votes are officially roll call votes, every time a deputy electronically votes a computer registers the individual deputy&#x27;s vote.

==Membership==
Any citizen of the Russian Federation aged 21 or older who has the right to participate in elections may be elected as a deputy to the State Duma. However, that same person may not be a deputy to the Federation Council. In addition, a State Duma deputy cannot hold office in any other representative body of state power or bodies of local self-government. The office as deputy of the State Duma is a full-time and professional position. Thus, deputies to the State Duma may not be employed in the civil service or engage in any activities for remuneration other than teaching, research or other creative activities.

=== Chairmen of the State Duma ===

*Ivan Rybkin (1994–1996)
*Gennadiy Seleznyov (1996–2003)
*Boris Gryzlov (2003–2011)
*Sergey Naryshkin (2011–2016)
*Vyacheslav Volodin (since 2016)

<doc id="1010189" wikidata="Q422001" url="?curid=1010189" title="Retinal">
<text>Retinal (also known as retinaldehyde) is a polyene chromophore. Retinal, bound to proteins called opsins, is the chemical basis of visual phototransduction, the light-detection stage of visual perception (vision).

Some microorganisms use retinal to convert light into metabolic energy. One study suggests that approximately three billion years ago, most living organisms on Earth used retinal, rather than chlorophyll, to convert sunlight into energy. Because retinal absorbs mostly green light and transmits purple light, this gave rise to the Purple Earth hypothesis.

Retinal itself is considered to be a form of vitamin A when eaten by an animal. There are many forms of vitamin A, all of which are converted to retinal, which cannot be made without them. The number of different molecules that can be converted to retinal varies from species to species. Retinal was originally called [[retinene]], and was renamed after it was discovered to be vitamin A [[aldehyde]].

Vertebrate animals ingest retinal directly from meat, or they produce retinal from carotenoids – either from α-carotene or β-carotene – both of which are carotenes. They also produce it from β-cryptoxanthin, a type of xanthophyll. These carotenoids must be obtained from plants or other photosynthetic organisms. No other carotenoids can be converted by animals to retinal. Some carnivores cannot convert any carotenoids at all. The other main forms of vitamin A – retinol and a partially active form, retinoic acid – may both be produced from retinal.

Invertebrates such as insects and squid use hydroxylated forms of retinal in their visual systems, which derive from conversion from other xanthophylls.

==Vitamin A metabolism==

Living organisms produce retinal by irreversible oxidative cleavage of carotenoids.

For example:
catalyzed by a beta-carotene 15,15&#x27;-monooxygenase or a beta-carotene 15,15&#x27;-dioxygenase.

Just as carotenoids are the precursors of retinal, retinal is the precursor of the other forms of vitamin A. Retinal is interconvertible with retinol, the transport and storage form of vitamin A:

catalyzed by retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs) and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs).

Retinol is called vitamin A alcohol or, more often, simply vitamin A. Retinal can also be oxidized to retinoic acid:

catalyzed by retinal dehydrogenases also known as retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDHs) as well as retinal oxidases.

Retinoic acid, sometimes called vitamin A acid, is an important signaling molecule and hormone in vertebrate animals.

==Vision==
Retinal is a conjugated chromophore. In the Vertebrate eyes, retinal begins in an 11-&quot;cis&quot;-retinal configuration, which — upon capturing a photon of the correct wavelength — straightens out into an all-&quot;trans&quot;-retinal configuration. This configuration change pushes against an opsin protein in the retina, which triggers a chemical signaling cascade, which results in perception of light or images by the brain. The absorbance spectrum of the chromophore depends on its interactions with the opsin protein to which it is bound, so that different retinal-opsin complexes will absorb photons of different wavelengths (i.e., different colors of light).

===Opsins===

Retinal is bound to opsins, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Opsins, like other GPCRs, have seven transmembrane alpha-helices connected by six loops. They are found in the photoreceptor cells in the retina of eye. The opsin in the vertebrate rod cells is rhodopsin. The rods form disks, which contain the rhodopsin molecules in their membranes and which are entirely inside of the cell. The N-terminus head of the molecule extends into the interior of the disk, and the C-terminus tail extends into the cytoplasm of the cell. The opsins in the cone cells are OPN1SW, OPN1MW, and OPN1LW. The cones form incomplete disks that are part of the plasma membrane, so that the N-terminus head extends outside of the cell. In opsins, retinal binds covalently to a lysine in the seventh transmembrane helix through a Schiff base. Forming the Schiff base linkage involves removing the oxygen atom from retinal and two hydrogen atoms from the free amino group of lysine, giving H2O. Retinylidene is the divalent group formed by removing the oxygen atom from retinal, and so opsins have been called retinylidene proteins.

Opsins are prototypical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Cattle rhodopsin, the opsin of the rod cells, was the first GPCR to have its amino acid sequence and 3D-structure (via X-ray crystallography) determined. Cattle rhodopsin contains 348 amino acid residues. Retinal binds as chromophore at Lys296. This lysine is conserved in almost all opsins, only a few opsins have lost it during evolution. Opsins without the retinal binding lysine are not light sensitive. Such opsins may have other functions.

Although mammals use retinal exclusively as the opsin chromophore, other groups of animals additionally use four chromophores closely related to retinal: 3,4-didehydroretinal (vitamin A2), (3&quot;R&quot;)-3-hydroxyretinal, (3&quot;S&quot;)-3-hydroxyretinal (both vitamin A3), and (4&quot;R&quot;)-4-hydroxyretinal (vitamin A4). Many fish and amphibians use 3,4-didehydroretinal, also called dehydroretinal. With the exception of the dipteran suborder Cyclorrhapha (the so-called higher flies), all insects examined use the (&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomer of 3-hydroxyretinal. The (&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomer is to be expected if 3-hydroxyretinal is produced directly from xanthophyll carotenoids. Cyclorrhaphans, including &quot;Drosophila&quot;, use (3&quot;S&quot;)-3-hydroxyretinal. Firefly squid have been found to use (4&quot;R&quot;)-4-hydroxyretinal.
===Visual cycle===
The visual cycle is a circular enzymatic pathway, which is the front-end of phototransduction. It regenerates 11-&quot;cis&quot;-retinal. For example, the visual cycle of mammalian rod cells is as follows:
#all-&quot;trans&quot;-retinyl ester + H2O → 11-&quot;cis&quot;-retinol + fatty acid; RPE65 isomerohydrolases;
#11-&quot;cis&quot;-retinol + NAD+ → 11-&quot;cis&quot;-retinal + NADH + H+; 11-&quot;cis&quot;-retinol dehydrogenases;
#11-&quot;cis&quot;-retinal + aporhodopsin → rhodopsin + H2O; forms Schiff base linkage to lysine, -CH=N+H-;
#rhodopsin + hν → metarhodopsin II (i.e., 11-&quot;cis&quot; photoisomerizes to all-&quot;trans&quot;):
#:(rhodopsin + hν → photorhodopsin → bathorhodopsin → lumirhodopsin → metarhodopsin I → metarhodopsin II);
#metarhodopsin II + H2O → aporhodopsin + all-&quot;trans&quot;-retinal;
#all-&quot;trans&quot;-retinal + NADPH + H+ → all-&quot;trans&quot;-retinol + NADP+; all-&quot;trans&quot;-retinol dehydrogenases;
#all-&quot;trans&quot;-retinol + fatty acid → all-&quot;trans&quot;-retinyl ester + H2O; lecithin retinol acyltransferases (LRATs).

Steps 3, 4, 5, and 6 occur in rod cell outer segments; Steps 1, 2, and 7 occur in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells.

RPE65 isomerohydrolases are homologous with beta-carotene monooxygenases; the homologous ninaB enzyme in &quot;Drosophila&quot; has both retinal-forming carotenoid-oxygenase activity and all-&quot;trans&quot; to 11-&quot;cis&quot; isomerase activity.

==Microbial rhodopsins==

All-&quot;trans&quot;-retinal is also an essential component of microbial opsins such as bacteriorhodopsin, channelrhodopsin, and halorhodopsin, which are important in bacterial and archaeal anoxygenic photosynthesis. In these molecules, light causes the all-&quot;trans&quot;-retinal to become 13-&quot;cis&quot; retinal, which then cycles back to all-&quot;trans&quot;-retinal in the dark state. These proteins are not evolutionarily related to animal opsins and are not GPCRs; the fact that they both use retinal is a result of convergent evolution.

==History==
The American biochemist George Wald and others had outlined the visual cycle by 1958. For his work, Wald won a share of the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Haldan Keffer Hartline and Ragnar Granit.

<text>A is a type of household cleaning tool that originated in Japan. Consisting of durable cloth strips attached to a stick or pole, it is used for moving dust from surfaces onto the floor where it can be swept up or vacuumed. Similar to a feather duster, it is not to be confused with an ōnusa.

This duster, made of a bamboo pole and cloth strips, is a fixture in every Japanese home.

The &quot;hataki&quot; does not trap dust but, with its familiar sound, pushes it onto the floor where it can be swept up.

<text>The Musée Rodin () of Paris, France, is an art museum that was opened in 1919, primarily dedicated to the works of the French sculptor Auguste Rodin. It has two sites: the Hôtel Biron and surrounding grounds in central Paris, as well as just outside Paris at Rodin&#x27;s old home, the Villa des Brillants at Meudon, Hauts-de-Seine. The collection includes 6,600 sculptures, 8,000 drawings, 8,000 old photographs and 7,000 objets d&#x27;art. The museum receives 700,000 visitors annually.

While living in the Villa des Brillants, Rodin used the Hôtel Biron as his workshop from 1908, and subsequently donated his entire collection of sculptures – along with paintings by Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir that he had acquired – to the French State on the condition that they turn the buildings into a museum dedicated to his works. The Musée Rodin contains most of Rodin&#x27;s significant creations, including &quot;The Thinker&quot;, &quot;The Kiss&quot; and &quot;The Gates of Hell&quot;. Many of his sculptures are displayed in the museum&#x27;s extensive garden. The museum includes a room dedicated to the works of Camille Claudel and one of the two castings of &quot;The Mature Age&quot;.

The gardens around the museum building contain many of the famous sculptures in natural settings. Behind the museum building are a small lake and casual restaurant. Additionally, the nearby Métro stop, Varenne, features some of Rodin&#x27;s sculptures on the platform. The building is served by Métro (Line 13), RER (Line C: Invalides) and bus (69, 82, 87, 92).

== Permanent collections ==
=== Sculptures ===

Rodin&#x27;s sculptures are the work of an artist who chose to defy the norms of his time. Among the works of his youth, &quot;Man with a Broken Nose&quot; appears out of step with contemporary aesthetic norms, while &quot;The Age of Bronze&quot; rejects contemporary mechanisms of physical expression. This absence of artifice, like the nudity of &quot;The Thinker&quot; or &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; guarantees the timelessness of Rodin&#x27;s works.

The artist also stands out by the monumental aspect of some of his works: &quot;Balzac&quot;, &quot;The Burghers of Calais&quot; or the impressive, unfinished &quot;The Gates of Hell,&quot; which contains many elements representing the major works of Rodin (&quot;The Thinker, Ugolino, The Kiss&quot; or &quot;the Three Shades&quot;).

=== Drawings ===
The graphic collection at the Musée Rodin contains around 7,000 drawings. They can be associated with different styles and periods: observation of landscapes, fantasy works inspired by Dante or Baudelaire, numerous erotic nudes or even portraits.

=== Photography ===
The Musée Rodin preserves an important collection of 25,000 photographs. Among these, 7,000 were collected by Rodin himself. The artist showed indeed a great interest for this science and art, and he has collaborated with many photographers, such as Eugène Druet, Jacques-Ernest Bulloz, Adolphe Braun or Edward Steichen.

Subjects and themes are varied, Rodin&#x27;s personal albums attest to his centres of interest and artistic sources, while the portraits and newspaper photographs illustrate his work and his life. Above all, these photographs are a great source to learn what happened in the studio between 1877 and Rodin&#x27;s death, in 1917.

===Camille Claudel room===
The Camille Claudel room contains such Claudel works as the 1913 casting of &quot;The Mature Age&quot; (1898), &quot;The Wave&quot; (1897), &quot;The Waltz&quot;, &quot;Sakountala&quot; (1905), and an 1892 casting of &quot;Bust of Rodin&quot; (1888–89).

Claudel, a student and model for Rodin, and soon his collaborator, associate, and lover, worked with Rodin from 1884 until the early 1890s. They kept in close contact until 1899.

=== Rodin as a collector ===
During the twenty last years of his life, as he was living in Meudon, Rodin started a collection of ancient works of art from Egypt, Greece and Rome, then later from the Far East. As the collection was growing, the different pieces invaded the studio and his house, replacing the casts after Antique statues. As Rodin&#x27;s fame grew, the commissions he received enabled him to continue his collection, reaching over 6.000 works in 1917.

In addition, Rodin&#x27;s friendships and tastes led him to surrounding himself with works by the Naturalists (Théodule Ribot, Alfred Roll) and Symbolists (Eugène Carrière, Charles Cottet...). Through a series of exchanges made with his artists friends, Rodin owned works of art from Jules Dalou, Alexandre Falguière or Jean-Paul Laurens. He also realised important purchases: three Van Gogh&#x27;s (including &quot;Père Tanguy&quot;, late 1887), Renoir&#x27;s &quot;Nude in the Sunlight&quot; and Monet&#x27;s &quot;Belle-Île&quot;.

=== Contemporary art exhibitions ===
Recently, contemporary art exhibitions are also organized, as it was done as early as 1949 when the first Salon de la jeune sculpture took place at the Musée Rodin.
Artists such as Anthony Caro, Eugène Dodeigne, Étienne Bossut exhibited at the museum.
Bill Viola, Adel Abdessemed and Mircea Cantor have been invited to screen videos in the park for the « Nuit des musées ».
In 2010, artworks by Belgian artist Wim Delvoye were exhibited, as well as a program of video-performances by artists such as Vito Acconci, Sanja Iveković, Marina Abramović and Mona Hatoum. A Henry Moore exhibition, dedicated to his studio and small sculptures, ran there from October 2010 to February 2011.

== Museum locations ==

=== Hôtel Biron, Paris ===
First opened to the public on 4 August 1919, the Musée Rodin was housed in a mansion, formerly called the Hôtel Peyrenc de Moras, designed with the lines of classical architecture and ornamented with rocaille decoration. It was built in the Rue de Varenne, between 1727 and 1732. From 1788, the Hôtel was occupied by a series of owners and tenants. In 1820, the Duchess of Charost sold the entire property to three nuns belonging to a religious congregation, the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. A boarding school for girls was opened and the decorations were progressively sold. Between 1820 and 1904, several buildings were constructed on the estate, the Chapel in particular, designed by the architect Jean Juste Gustave Lisch and achieved in 1876.

The Society was dissolved in 1904 due to the &#x27;religious orders&#x27; law involving the separation of church and state which prohibited religious orders from teaching. The sisters were evicted and the estate was put up for sale. Awaiting a buyer, tenants were allowed to occupy the building; among them were Jean Cocteau, Henri Matisse, Isadora Duncan and Rainer Maria Rilke, whose future wife Clara Westhoff was living in the Hôtel and was the first to tell Rodin about the estate. In 1908, the sculptor rented four ground-floor rooms to use as his studios. From 1911 onwards, he occupied the whole building. In 1911, as the French state had committed itself to purchasing the Hôtel Biron, Rodin started to negotiate with it. The artist announced officially his intention to donate all his works to the French state, as well as his drawings and his collection of antiquities in the condition that the State keeps all these collections at the Hôtel Biron, which will become the Musée Rodin in exchange of the right to reside there all his life.

In 1916, the French Assembly passed a law permitting the State to accept the donations and allocated the mansion and its garden to a museum. Léonce Bénédite was appointed executor of the sculptor&#x27;s will: his tasks were to manage Rodin&#x27;s artistic heritage and to supervise the organisation of the future museum.

Listed as a historical monument in 1926, the Hôtel Biron and its grounds have since undergone major renovation and restoration work, to better assert their role as a museum. The most recent scheme was the restoration which began in 2012 and was completed by 12 November 2015, Rodin&#x27;s 175th birthday. The renovations cost 16 million euro ($17.4 million), and were hailed as a &quot;moral duty&quot; by France&#x27;s Culture Minister Fleur Pellerin.

=== Musée Rodin in Meudon ===
On December 19, 1895, Rodin purchased a Louis XIII-style house in brick and stone, built on the heights of Meudon and called &quot;La Villa des Brillants&quot;. In 1900, almost 50 people, including sculptor&#x27;s assistants, workers and casters, were employed there by Rodin and, although he continued to go to his Paris studios daily, his major creative work was done in Meudon. The place became soon a major place of attraction for friends, admirers or celebrities from France or abroad. It is also in Meudon that Rodin and his wife, Rose Beuret, have chosen to be buried.

After the death of Rodin, the villa and the studio also became a museum, open three days per week. Visitors can discover the atmosphere of the studio and the place where Rodin liked to live and work. Inaugurated in 1948, the museum also permits to glimpse numerous plasters, including casts for Rodin&#x27;s monumental works, such as the &quot;Burghers of Calais&quot; and the &quot;Gates of Hell&quot; which allow to discover the different steps of the creative process.

<doc id="1010199" wikidata="Q1066356" url="?curid=1010199" title="Charles W. Morgan (ship)">
<text>Charles W. Morgan is an American whaling ship built in 1841 that was active during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Ships of this type were used to harvest the blubber of whales for whale oil which was commonly used in lamps. &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; has served as a museum ship since the 1940s and is now an exhibit at the Mystic Seaport museum in Mystic, Connecticut. She is the world&#x27;s oldest surviving (non-wrecked) merchant vessel, the only surviving wooden whaling ship from the 19th century American merchant fleet (of an estimated 2,700 built), and second to USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, the oldest seaworthy vessel in the world. &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.

== Construction ==

&quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; (often referred to simply as &quot;the &quot;Morgan&quot;&quot;) was a whaling ship named for owner Charles Waln Morgan (1796–1861). He was a Philadelphian by birth; he moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1818 and invested in several whalers over his career. He chose Jethro and Zachariah Hillman&#x27;s shipyard in New Bedford to construct a new ship. The &quot;Morgan&quot; live oak keel was laid down in February 1841 and fastened together with copper bolts. The bow and stern pieces of live oak were secured to the keel by an apron piece. The sturdy stern post was strengthened with hemlock root and white oak. Yellow pine shipped from North Carolina was used for the ship&#x27;s beams, and hemlock or hackmatack was used for the hanging knees.
Construction proceeded until April 19, 1841, when the workers went on strike, demanding a ten-hour work day. The strike gathered support until it encompassed the shipyard, the oil refineries, and the cooper shops; Morgan was appointed chairman of the employers and given the task of resolving it. He opposed their demands, and a meeting with four master mechanics ended in failure. An agreement was reached on May 6 when the workers accepted a 10½ hour workday. Work resumed on the ship without incident and she was launched on July 21, 1841. &quot;Morgan&quot; was registered as in length, inches in breadth, and in depth. She measured 314 gross register tons.

&quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; was outfitted at Rotch&#x27;s Wharf for the next two months while preparations were made for her first voyage. Captain Thomas Norton sailed her into the Atlantic alongside &quot;Adeline Gibbs&quot; and &quot;Nassau&quot; towards the Azores. A stop was made at Porto Pim (Horta, Azores) on Faial Island to gather supplies before crossing the Atlantic. The ship passed Cape Horn, then charted a course to the north. On December 13, the men launched in their whaleboats and took their first whale. The &quot;Morgan&quot; entered the port of Callao in early February and departed again on the 10th for the Galapagos Islands. In 1844, the ship sailed to the Kodiak Grounds before sailing for home on August 18. She returned to her home port in New Bedford on January 2, 1845. The voyage of three years and three months resulted in 59 whales being processed for 1,600 barrels of sperm oil, 800 barrels of right whale oil, and five tons of whale bone.

== Service life ==
&quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; made most of her 37 voyages in her 80 years of service from her home port of New Bedford, Massachusetts, ranging in length from nine months to five years. She brought home a total of 54,483 barrels of sperm and whale oil and 152,934 pounds of whalebone. She sailed in the Indian and South Atlantic Oceans, surviving ice and snow storms. She was based in San Francisco between 1888 and 1904.

&quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; had more than 1,000 whalemen of all races and nationalities in her lifetime. Her crew included sailors from Cape Verde, New Zealand, the Seychelles, Guadeloupe, and Norfolk Island. The ship&#x27;s crew averaged around 33 men per voyage. As with other whaleships in the 19th century, the &quot;Morgan&quot; was often home to the captain&#x27;s family. She was owned and managed by the J. &amp; W. R. Wing Company of New Bedford.

Experts have calculated the lifetime financial returns from &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; at over $1.4 Million. Voyage #6 had the highest return with a combined value of Sperm oil, Whale oil and Whalebone of over $165,000.

During her years of service, &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; was used in several movies, including &quot;Miss Petticoats&quot; (1916), &quot;Down to the Sea in Ships&quot; (1922), and &quot;Java Head&quot; (1923).

== Voyage summary ==
== Preservation ==
&quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; was nearly destroyed in 1924 when the steamer &quot;Sankaty&quot; caught fire and broke free of her mooring lines. The burning &quot;Sankaty&quot; drifted across the river and into &quot;Morgan&quot;″s port quarter, but the Fairhaven firemen managed to save her. This event spurred Harry Neyland and some New Bedford citizens to restore and preserve the &quot;Morgan&quot;, but the attempts were unsuccessful. Neyland then persuaded Colonel Edward Howland Robinson Green to save the ship. Neyland appealed to Green that the &quot;Morgan&quot; was of historical importance and was a family heirloom because she was once co-owned by Green&#x27;s grandfather and his wife&#x27;s company. Green had the ship towed to his estate in Round Hill (Dartmouth, Massachusetts) and founded Whaling Enshrined, consisting of himself, Neyland, and John Bullard, the great-grandson of Charles Waln Morgan.

The &quot;Morgan&quot; underwent restoration by Captain George Fred Tilton and was turned into an exhibition for Green&#x27;s estate in a berth constructed by Frank Taylor. Green held a dedication ceremony on the 86th anniversary of the ship&#x27;s launch and gave her to Whaling Enshrined on July 21, 1926. The ship&#x27;s fate came into question when Tilton died in 1932 and Green died in 1935, resulting in lengthy court proceedings over Green&#x27;s estate. The 1938 New England hurricane damaged &quot;Morgan&quot;″s hull and tore the sails; Whaling Enshrined attempted to secure funds for the ship but were unable to do so.

In 1941, the &quot;Morgan&quot; was saved by the Marine Historical Association (later renamed Mystic Seaport) based on Taylor&#x27;s word that the ship could be freed and towed to Mystic, Connecticut. Taylor&#x27;s crew dug the ship from her berth and dredged a channel for her to pass through, but the first attempt to pull her free was unsuccessful. More digging and caulking of the ship preceded her successful tugging into the channel, and the century-old hull withstood the move and floated into bay with assistance from the Coast Guard cutter &quot;General Greene&quot;.

She was towed to the old berth in Fairhaven for several days of preparations and repairs prior to the trip to Mystic.

On November 5, 1941, &quot;General Greene&quot; pulled &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; from the wharf only to have her be caught by the tide and swept downstream, coming to rest on a mud flat and taking two hours to be freed. The journey came to an end on November 8 when she passed through the Mystic bridge and was moored in the Mystic Seaport. The Seaport took shape around &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; with the restoration of its buildings and historic ships that came to reside alongside the &quot;Morgan&quot;. &quot;Over it all, the &quot;Morgan&quot; presided like Old Neptune-the centerpiece, the king seated on a throne of gravel, towering high above the scene.&quot;

==Restoration==
&quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; arrived at Mystic Seaport in December 1941, and she was declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. In 1971, Melbourne Brindle of Bridgeport, Connecticut designed four commemorative stamps of historic landmarks including the &quot;Morgan&quot;.

For the first 30 years at Mystic Seaport, she was surrounded by a bed of sand to prevent her from sinking. Even so, she was open to the public and was the centerpiece of a recreated 19th century maritime village museum inspired by Colonial Williamsburg. She is the only preserved 19th century whaling ship in the world.

The Mystic Seaport undertook a restoration and preservation project in 1968 to make her seaworthy, and the sand bed was removed. Prior to the 1968 restoration, she had a wide white stripe painted on her sides with large black squares that resembled gun ports when viewed at a distance. This &quot;camouflage&quot; was often employed by 19th century merchant ships to make them resemble warships so as to deter pirates and hostile navies.

In 2010, Mystic Seaport engaged in a multimillion-dollar project to restore the ship to seaworthy status. She was re-launched into the Mystic River on July 21, 2013, marking the 172nd anniversary of the vessel&#x27;s initial launch. During the summer of 2014, she sailed her 38th voyage on tour of New England seaports which included New London, Connecticut, Newport, Rhode Island, Boston, and her home town of New Bedford, Massachusetts.

<doc id="1010200" wikidata="Q665258" url="?curid=1010200" title="Herpangina">
<text>Herpangina, also called mouth blisters, is a painful mouth infection caused by coxsackieviruses. Usually, herpangina is produced by one particular strain of coxsackie virus A (and the term &quot;herpangina virus&quot; refers to coxsackievirus A), but it can also be caused by coxsackievirus B or echoviruses. Most cases of herpangina occur in the summer, affecting mostly children. However, it occasionally occurs in adolescents and adults. It was first characterized in 1920.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include sudden fever with sore throat, headache, loss of appetite, and often neck pain. Within two days of onset, an average of four or five (but sometimes up to twenty) 1 to 2 mm diameter grayish lumps form and develop into vesicles surrounded by redness. Over the next 24 hours, these become shallow ulcers, rarely larger than 5 mm diameter that heal in one to seven days. These lesions most often appear on the tonsillar pillars (adjacent to the tonsils), but also on the soft palate, tonsils, uvula, or tongue.

A small number of lesions (usually two to six) form in the back area of the mouth, particularly the soft palate or tonsillar pillars. The lesions progress initially from red macules to vesicles and lastly to ulcerations, which can be 2–4 mm in size.

==Cause==
Typically spreads via the fecal-oral route or via respiratory droplets.

==Diagnosis==
A diagnosis can be made from clinical signs and symptoms, and treatment consists of minimizing the discomfort of symptoms. It can be differentiated from herpetic gingivostomatitis by the positioning of vesicles - in herpangina, they are typically found on the posterior oropharynx, as compared to gingivostomatitis where they are typically found on the anterior oropharynx and the mouth.

==Treatment==
Treatment is usually supportive only, as the disease is self-limiting and usually runs its course in less than a week.

In children with herpangina, using peginterferon α-2b spray may recover more quickly. Silver ion Spray and Albinterferon may also heipful.

==Epidemiology==
* Most commonly affects infants and young children
* Typically occurs during the summer

==Etymology==
The term is derived from Greek &quot;herp&quot; &#x27;creeping, snakelike&#x27; and Latin &quot;angina&quot; &#x27;quinsy&#x27;, literally &quot;inflammation or swelling of the throat or part of the throat, esp. tonsillitis&quot;.

<text>A trywork is a furnace, used to heat blubber from whales for the recovery of oil, on a whaling ship. 

The trywork is located aft of the fore-mast, and is typically constructed of brick and attached to the deck with iron braces. Two cast-iron trypots are set atop the furnace. It is similar to the rendering process for producing lard by heating or frying fatty pork. A reservoir of water under the bricks keeps the furnace from scorching the wood of the deck.

In the 18th and 19th century New England whaling industry, tryworks on whaling ships allowed the vessels to stay at sea longer as it allowed them to boil out the oil during the voyage and not have to carry unprocessed blubber home. Slices of blubber were cut as thinly as possible for the process, and on New England whaling ships, these slices were known as &quot;bible leaves&quot; by the sailors. The ability to use tryworks at sea thus enabled the Yankee whaling industry to flourish.

<text>Luis Clemente Tiant Vega () (November 23, 1940 – October 8, 2024), nicknamed &quot;El Tiante&quot;, was a Cuban professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 19 years, primarily for the Cleveland Indians and the Boston Red Sox.

Tiant compiled a 229–172 record with 2,416 strikeouts, a 3.30 earned run average (ERA), 187 complete games, and 49 shutouts in innings. He was an All-Star for three seasons and 20-game winner for four seasons. He was the American League (AL) ERA leader in 1968 and 1972. He also was the AL leader in strikeouts per nine innings pitched in 1967 and the AL leader in shutouts in 1966, 1968, and 1974.

Tiant was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 1997, the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2002, the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 2009, and the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2012. He was considered for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame via voting of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America from 1988 to 2002, and by the Hall of Fame&#x27;s era committees in 2011, 2014, and 2017, falling short of the required votes for induction each time.

==Early years==
Tiant was the only child of Luis Tiant Sr. and Isabel Vega. From 1926 through 1948, the senior Tiant was a great left-handed pitcher for the Negro league&#x27;s New York Cubans during the summer and the Cuban professional league&#x27;s Cienfuegos in the winter, his heroics being followed by hundreds of thousands of Cubans. Luis Jr. followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps at an early age, joining both the local Little and Juvenile baseball leagues and rising to a star.

===Cuba and Mexico===
The 16 year-old Tiant was picked for the Cuban Juvenile League All-Star team in 1957. His talent drew the attention of former Cleveland Indians All-Star Bobby Ávila, who was scouting for talent in Cuba. Avila recommended him to the Mexico City Tigers of the Mexican League. Tiant was signed in 1959 for $150 a month, and for the next three years he divided his time between the Tigers and the Havana Sugar Kings in the International League.

===Cleveland Indians system===
At the end of the summer of 1961, and under Avila&#x27;s recommendation, Cleveland purchased Tiant&#x27;s contract for $35,000. But with the rise of Fidel Castro&#x27;s regime in his native Cuba—specifically, after heightened tensions following the U.S.-sponsored Bay of Pigs invasion in April of that year—it was impossible for Tiant to return home. He did not see his parents for 14 years.

Tiant progressed through the Indians&#x27; farm system beginning in 1962 with the Charleston Indians of the Eastern League, then with the Burlington Rangers—where he was one of the best pitchers in the Carolina League—in 1963, and lastly with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League in 1964. Tiant later recalled that at Charleston, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t speak very good English but I understand racism. They treated me like a dog, but when I got to Portland, I didn&#x27;t have any problems.&quot; After pitching to a 15–1 record at Triple-A Portland, which included a no-hitter and a one-hitter in consecutive starts, Tiant was called up by the Indians in mid-July 1964.

==MLB career==

===Cleveland Indians===
On July 19, 1964, Tiant debuted in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Indians with a four-single, 11 strikeout, 3–0 shutout victory against the defending AL Champion New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, beating their ace, Whitey Ford. Tiant finished his rookie season with a 10–4 win–loss record, 105 strikeouts, and a 2.83 earned run average (ERA) in 19 games.

In , Tiant had one of the greatest pitching seasons in major league history, leading the American League in ERA (1.60), shutouts (nine, including four consecutive), hits per nine innings (a still-standing franchise record 5.30, which broke Herb Score&#x27;s 5.85 in 1956 and would be a Major-League record until surpassed by Nolan Ryan&#x27;s 5.26 in 1972), and strikeouts per nine innings (9.22), while finishing with a 21–9 mark. His .168 opponent batting average set a new major league record, and his 19 strikeout/10 inning performance against the Minnesota Twins on July 3 set the American League record for strikeouts in a game. His 1.60 ERA in 1968 was the lowest in the AL in nearly half a century (since Walter Johnson&#x27;s dead-ball era 1.49 in 1919), second only in the Major Leagues in that time to National Leaguer (St. Louis Cardinals) Bob Gibson&#x27;s historic 1.12 the same year—the lowest mark ever during the live-ball era. And his four consecutive shutouts had been matched or bettered by only two other pitchers in the 50-year expansion era, both also in 1968: Don Drysdale (six) and Gibson again (five). 

With Sam McDowell, Sonny Siebert, and others, the Indians staff led the AL in strikeouts for five consecutive years, including a record 1189 in 1967, a mark which would stand for 30 years.

===Minnesota Twins===
After an injury-plagued season with the Indians in , Tiant was traded to the Minnesota Twins in a multi-player deal that brought fellow pitcher Dean Chance and third baseman Graig Nettles to the Indians. With Minnesota, Tiant began with six wins, but then he fractured his right scapula, essentially ending his season and, some felt, his career. He showed some promise in the spring training, but he was released.

===Boston Red Sox===
After being dropped by the Twins in spring training of 1971, the Atlanta Braves signed Tiant to a minor league contract to play with their Triple-A minor league Richmond team. Tiant began the process of reinventing himself as a pitcher by altering his delivery so that he turned away from home plate during his motion, in effect creating a hesitation pitch. According to Tiant, the new motion was a response to a drop in his velocity from his shoulder injury. Twisting and turning his body into unthinkable positions, Tiant would spend more time looking at second base than he did the plate as he prepared to throw.

He pitched well in Richmond, and was acquired by the Louisville Colonels, a farm team of the Boston Red Sox. He was quickly called back up to the majors, but struggled through 1971 with a 1–7 record and 4.88 ERA. In he regained his old form with a sparkling 15–6 season in which he threw six shutouts in just 19 starts and led the American League with a 1.91 ERA. He would win 20 games in , and 22 in an All-Star en route to becoming known as &quot;El Tiante&quot; at Fenway Park, one of the greatest and most beloved pitchers in Red Sox history and an enduring idol in Boston.

Though hampered by back problems in , he won 18 games for the American League Champion Red Sox, then excelled in the postseason. In the playoffs he bested the three-time defending World Champion Oakland Athletics, allowing only three hits in a 7–1 complete-game victory, then opened the World Series against The Big Red Machine Cincinnati Reds. His father and mother were in Fenway Park that game to watch their son defeat the Reds 6–0 in a five-hit shutout, having been allowed to visit from Cuba under a special visa.

Tiant won Game 4 as well (throwing 173 pitches in his second complete game in the series) and had a no-decision in a Game 6 that has been called the greatest game ever played (ending in a dramatic Carlton Fisk 12th-inning walk-off home run).

Tiant went 21–12 as an All-Star in , 12–8 in , and 13–8 in , furthering his status as a fan favorite and one of the greatest pitchers in Red Sox history.

===New York Yankees===
At the end of the 1978 season Tiant signed as a free agent with the New York Yankees. He compiled a 21–17 record in New York over 1979 and 1980.

===Pittsburgh Pirates and California Angels===
Tiant signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates as a free agent in 1981, pitching in just 9 games and going 2–5 with a 3.92 ERA. He also appeared in 21 games (all starts) for the Pirates&#x27; Triple-A Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League, posting a 13–7 record with 3.82 ERA.

He finished his career with a brief stint with the California Angels in 1982, pitching in 6 games and going 2–2 with a 5.76 ERA.

==Other leagues==
Tiant competed in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League in parts of seven seasons spanning 1963–1982, while compiling a record of 37–24 including 29 complete games, a 2.27 ERA, and a no-hitter in 1971. He was a member of the champion Leones del Caracas teams of 1966–67 and 1967–68. He gained induction into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 2009.

Tiant competed in the Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1989, initially signing with the Winter Haven Super Sox. He was subsequently traded to the Gold Coast Suns, in exchange for outfielder Ralph Garr and 500 Teddy Ruxpin toy bears (for use as a fan giveaway item). Tiant had an 0–1 record with 5.00 ERA for the Suns.

==Post-playing days==

Tiant was a minor league pitching coach in the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; farm system from 1992 to 1995, and in the Chicago White Sox&#x27;s farm system in 1997. During the 1996 Summer Olympics, he was the pitching coach for the Nicaraguan team.

Tiant served as the head coach for the baseball team at the Savannah College of Art and Design, an NCAA Division III program, from 1998 to 2001, where his teams compiled a record of 55–97 for a .366 winning percentage.

In 2002, Tiant was the pitching coach for Boston&#x27;s Class A Short Season affiliate, the Lowell Spinners, and has continued to serve as a special assignment instructor for the Red Sox.

Tiant, along with former batterymate Carlton Fisk, threw out the ceremonial first pitch before what proved to be the Red Sox&#x27; championship-winning Game 6 of the 2013 World Series at Fenway Park.

==MLB statistics==
Tiant&#x27;s major league stats:
==Hall of Fame candidacy==
Tiant was on the National Baseball Hall of Fame ballot from to , but peaked at 30.9% of the votes in his first ballot year. According to election rules at the time, players were permitted on the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America ballot for a maximum of 15 years; in his 15th and final appearance on the ballot, Tiant received 18.0% of the vote during 2002 balloting.

Tiant was considered again for induction by the Hall of Fame&#x27;s own Golden Era Committee (for the 1947–1972 era) in and , and by the Modern Era Baseball Committee (for the 1970–1987 era) in , but again fell short. The Golden Era Committee was replaced in July 2016 by a 16-member Golden Days Committee, to vote from a 10 candidate ballot for the 1950–1969 era. The Golden Days Committee elected its first Hall of Fame members in December 2021, but Tiant was not among them. He appeared on the Classic Baseball Era Committee&#x27;s ballot, but only received less than five votes.

==Personal life==
Tiant and his wife, Maria, had three children: Luis Jr., Isabel, and Daniel. As of 2001, the family was living in Southborough, Massachusetts.

An avid cigar smoker, Tiant launched a line of cigars that he formulated and designed, branding them with his nickname, &quot;El Tiante&quot;. Tommy John remembered Tiant&#x27;s cigars only too well from their days in the Indians organization. &quot;Luis would smoke these horrendous, long, Cuban cigars. We&#x27;d be on the bus all night, and wake up to a thick blue haze from Tiant&#x27;s ropes. Tiant had an almost supernatural ability for keeping a cigar lit. Luis would cut up in his high-pitched voice, joking, cackling, and the eternal flame held true. He could even take a shower and keep his stogie going. In the confined space of a bus, the smoke would gag you. He&#x27;d fall asleep on the bus, but the cigar would somehow stay alive all night.&quot;

Tiant appeared in an episode of &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Now Pitching, Sam Malone&quot;, which first aired on January 6, 1983. Sam Malone (Ted Danson) agrees to do a television beer commercial, co-starring with and &quot;relieving&quot; Tiant when the latter begins to fail in his promotion of the product.

Tiant authored two autobiographies:
* &quot;El Tiante, the Luis Tiant story&quot;, written with Joe Fitzgerald, released in 1976
* &quot;Son of Havana: A Baseball Journey from Cuba to the Big Leagues and Back&quot;, written with Saul Wisnia, released in May 2019

Tiant was the subject of two documentary films, the WGBH-TV 2003 production &quot;El Tiante: A Red Sox Story&quot; produced by Patricia Alvarado Nuñez, which premiered at the Harvard Film Archives and on television on GBH Channel 2 (PBS-Boston). &quot;The Lost Son of Havana&quot;, produced by Kris Meyer and the Farrelly brothers, and directed by Jonathan Hock. The story of his return visit to his roots in Cuba had its world premiere on April 23, 2009, at the Tribeca Film Festival, and was promptly acquired by ESPN Films.

Tiant died at his home in Wells, Maine, on October 8, 2024, at the age of 83.

<text>Virginia Key is an barrier island in Miami, Florida. It is located in Biscayne Bay south of Brickell and north of Key Biscayne and is accessible from the mainland via the Rickenbacker Causeway.

The island is mainly occupied by the Virginia Key Beach Park, Miami Seaquarium, Miami-Dade&#x27;s Central District Wastewater Treatment Plant, and the University of Miami&#x27;s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. Other facilities include the former Miami Marine Stadium, the National Marine Fisheries Service Southeast Fisheries Science Center, and an office of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

==History==

What is now Virginia Key was the southern end of a barrier island that extended from the New River inlet in Fort Lauderdale to just north of Key Biscayne. Early accounts by Spanish explorers indicated the existence of one or more inlets somewhere on the long spit of land enclosing the northern end of Biscayne Bay, but such inlets open and close over time. At the beginning of the 19th century, there was no inlet through the barrier island between the New River Inlet and Bear Cut, at the northern end of Key Biscayne. Hurricanes in 1835 and 1838 opened a new inlet, Narrows Cut (now known as Norris Cut), separating Virginia Key from what is now Fisher Island at the south end of Miami Beach.

The island was named by Frederick H. Gerdes of the United States Coast Survey in 1849. He noted that the island north of Key Biscayne had no name, and had not existed as an island until &#x27;Narrows Cut&#x27; had broken through &quot;ten or twelve&quot; years before (i.e., the hurricane of 1835 or 1838). He described Virginia Key as three miles (5 km) long and one mile (1.6 km) wide (later, as five miles (8 km) long and wide), &quot;with a fine Atlantic beach,&quot; but mostly covered with mangroves.

===Virginia Key Beach Park===
In May 1945, seven civil rights activists supported by the local NAACP chapter staged a &quot;wade-in&quot; at the whites’ only Baker&#x27;s Haulover Beach in Dade County Florida. Five men and two women protested Jim Crow era laws that denied access to recreation based on race. In a Miami emerging from World War II this meant &quot;colored&quot; people could not share with whites the legendary beaches along and in the waters of Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.

The struggle for a &quot;colored-only&quot; beach in Miami, which was part of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, fueled the anger of patriotic black servicemen who fought the racism of Nazi Germany only to return to a segregated America. Among the protesters was Attorney Lawson Thomas who later became the first Black appointed to Judge in the post-Reconstruction South. Lawyer Thomas remained on the beach, holding bail money for those who anticipated arrest. The NAACP had notified the local press and police of the time and place, hoping for arrests that would be central to a court challenge of local discrimination laws and policies. On instruction from local government representatives, police refused to cite the protestors, telling Thomas to contact County Commissioner Charles H. Crandon.

Local businessmen and government officials had privately conceded something had to be done about the race problem. The economy was – and is – heavily reliant upon its good reputation with tourists. A decision was made to compromise race restrictions on recreation by designating a &quot;colored-only&quot; beach on Virginia Key. Crandon and Thomas negotiated the establishment of the &quot;Virginia Key Beach, a Dade County Park for the exclusive use of Negroes,&quot; (today, the Historic Virginia Key Beach Park). It opened on August 1, 1945.

There are several urban myths about the selection of Virginia Key by county officials, each with a kernel of truth – but there was an historic connection of at least several decades’ standing. A 1918 survey map of the &quot;Abandoned Military Reservation&quot; on Virginia Key located a &quot;Negro Dancing Pavilion&quot; on the island&#x27;s southeastern shore of the &quot;colored-only&quot; beach. From 1945 to 1947, Miami&#x27;s Blacks traveled to the beach exclusively by boat – public and private. The opening of the Rickenbacker Causeway in 1947 connected Virginia Key and Key Biscayne with the mainland and vehicular travel began.

The new Park enjoyed instant popularity. For a time, county government honored the &quot;separate but equal&quot; status of Virginia Key Beach with its white counterpart, Crandon Park on Key Biscayne. The original temporary buildings were replaced by permanent construction, a miniature railroad carried beachgoers around the park, and a seaside merry-go-round whirled riders of all ages. Still, Crandon Park was over with two miles (3 km) of beachfront and Virginia Key with a half-mile of beach.

When Crandon Park got a zoo, Virginia Key Beach got a pond with ornamental plants and so things began to change. When residents of Key Biscayne needed a place to dump their garbage and pump their sewage, the breezes on Virginia Key Beach turned sour, the water clouded with effluents. The long-term environmental impact has yet to be fully determined. Still, Virginia Key Beach remained a popular, even sacred place within Miami&#x27;s Black community.

===Park decline and restoration===
Segregation of Miami-Dade beaches finally ended in the early 1960s with another protest led by the late Rev. Theodore Gibson, Garth C. Reeves, Oscar Range and others. Crandon Park and Virginia Key Beach would no longer be used exclusively by one race or another, but open for all to enjoy. When beaches closer to historically Black residential neighborhoods desegregated, Virginia Key Beach gradually declined both in use and upkeep. By the 1980s, picnicking families mingled with gay couples and nudists using Virginia Key Beach. In 1982, the County transferred the former colored-only park to the City of Miami with a deed restriction that it only be used as a park and that the City continued the level of services and maintenance. The City closed the Park shortly thereafter citing high maintenance costs.

Shuttered for two decades, Virginia Key Beach was eroded by storms, its buildings damaged and vandalized, and park lands invaded by exotic plants and animals. Beset by declining revenues, some City officials began to speculate over schemes to sell off the development rights on Virginia Key. As plans leaked, a local coalition formed among Miami&#x27;s grassroots activists protesting any commercial development and asking for a complete restoration and re-opening of Miami&#x27;s largest park and only public park on the Atlantic Ocean. The leadership at City Hall appointed an official community-based civil rights task force to provide a public forum for the park&#x27;s future.

In time, the civil right&#x27;s task force developed into a trust that was given the charge of re-opening the park as an open green space for a multi-cultural society. The restoration process was divided into two major areas: environmental and historical. The trust undertook the daunting task of removing all exotic vegetation from the park while replenishing the landscape with native vegetation. In August, 2002 the site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and given a Florida Historical Marker.
On February 22, 2008, the Virginia Key Beach Park Trust re-opened the park to the public. Today, it is known as an ecological treasure which contains the largest mangrove wetland in the state. Historic landmarks such as the bathhouse, concession stand, carousel house, train tunnel, and picnic pavilions have all been renovated and opened for public use. The beach is open for wading only.

==Special features==
The Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) is one of the Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) Facilities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA/AOML is a part of the US Department of Commerce (DOC) and is located in Miami, Florida. AOML&#x27;s mission is to conduct basic and applied research in oceanography, tropical meteorology, atmospheric and oceanic chemistry, and acoustics. The research seeks to understand the physical characteristics and processes of the ocean and the atmosphere, both separately and as a coupled system.

Along the causeway onto Virginia Key is a long strip of bay front popular with windsurfers and sailors, called Hobie Beach after the Hobie Cats that set sail from the shore. It&#x27;s also the only Miami-area beach that allows dogs. Nearby rest rooms and a great view of the curving shoreline make this an ideal place for tailgate parties.

The Miami Seaquarium is a marine park on Virginia Key, opened in 1955.

The Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science, founded by F.G. Walton Smith, is the University of Miami&#x27;s graduate school of marine and atmospheric science. Dr. Roni Avissar is the Dean of the Rosenstiel School . Located on a campus on Virginia Key in Miami, it is the only tropical applied and basic marine and atmospheric research institute of its kind in the continental United States. The Rosenstiel School conducts a broad range of research on local, regional, national and global levels. More than 100 Ph.D. faculty members, 150 graduate students and a research support and administrative staff of 250 comprise the academic community.

The Maritime and Science Technology (MAST) Academy public magnet school is located on Virginia Key. Several hundred high school specially-selected students from Miami get their education at MAST Academy.

A mountain biking park is located on the northern end of Virginia Key. Constructed by the Virginia Key Bicycle Club, the park features novice, intermediate and advanced trails. It is located just past Virginia Key Outdoor Center, just down the road from the former Jimbo&#x27;s location on Arthur Lamb Jr. road on the north point of Virginia Key.

<doc id="1010220" wikidata="Q16937280" url="?curid=1010220" title="Salamander heater">
<text>A salamander heater is any of a variety of portable forced-air or convection space heaters, often using kerosene or propane as fuel but also requiring electricity, used in ventilated areas for worksite comfort. Salamander heaters are most often found at construction sites. Depending on style, they can also be referred to as &quot;torpedo furnaces&quot;, &quot;salamander furnaces&quot;, or simply, &quot;salamanders&quot;.

Salamander heaters date back to at least 1915. In the early 1940s, W.L. Scheu of Scheu Manufacturing Company, a producer of temporary portable space heating equipment, developed the modern salamander heater to provide warmth to allow construction crews to work in inclement weather. Sales spread across the US, and by the 1950s, to Europe.

==Name==
The name, also applied to various types of heating device, comes from the mythical salamander, a beast that lived in fire and could control fire. Examples from kitchen use include high temperature ovens and, from the 17th and 18th century, a browning element.

<text>Russell Frank Ebert (22 June 1949 – 5 November 2021) was an Australian rules footballer and coach. He is considered one of the greatest players in the history of Australian rules football in South Australia. Ebert is the only player to have won four Magarey Medals, which are awarded to the best and fairest player in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). He is one of four Australian rules footballers to have a statue at Adelaide Oval, the others being Ken Farmer, Malcolm Blight and Barrie Robran. Football historian John Devaney described Ebert as coming &quot;as close as any player in history to exhibiting complete mastery over all the essential skills of the game,&quot; and he is widely regarded as the Port Adelaide Football Club&#x27;s greatest-ever player. Aside from his 392 games at Port Adelaide, Ebert played 25 games for in the 1979 VFL season and collected over 500 possessions as a midfielder for the club, which reached the preliminary final. Ebert was an inaugural inductee into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, and he was posthumously elevated to Legend status in June 2022, the highest honour that can be bestowed onto an Australian footballer.

== Early life ==

The fourth of six children of Doreen and Albert Ebert, Russell was born in the South Australian river town of Berri. Russell&#x27;s father Albert was a footballer with the Alawoona Football Club and captain coached the team to a premiership in 1953. At eight years old Ebert was in the crowd when Port Adelaide defeated Norwood in the 1957 SANFL Grand Final.

Russell&#x27;s family moved to Loxton during his high-school years and the town was home to his junior football club, the Loxton Football Club, where he played with his brothers.

As a teenager, Ebert gained employment with the Bank of Loxton. He was subsequently transferred to the Savings Bank at Waikerie. Ebert joined the Waikerie Football Club and played alongside Bruce Light, who eventually played for Port Adelaide with him.

== Football career ==
Before Ebert agreed to join Port Adelaide, six other SANFL clubs (North Adelaide, Central District, Woodville, Norwood, Glenelg and South Adelaide) approached Ebert about joining their clubs. In an interview with John Wood about this period in time, Ebert said he was set on joining North Adelaide but their representative &quot;never came back&quot;.

=== Port Adelaide (1968–1978) ===

In 1968, Eric Freeman, Port Adelaide&#x27;s full-forward, was selected to play for the Australian cricket team for the upcoming Ashes series. The absence of Freeman provided Ebert the opportunity, as an 18-year-old, to claim the full-forward position in the team. Ebert made his debut in the first round of the 1968 SANFL season against Glenelg on Alberton Oval. Ebert remained in Waikerie during 1968, driving back and forth between the Riverland and Adelaide for training and match day. During that season, Ebert kicked six goals in a game against both North Adelaide and Sturt. He played all but one senior game for Port Adelaide in his first season. In his first season of league football, Ebert benefited from experienced Port Adelaide premiership players such as John Cahill, Trevor Obst, Peter Obst, Ronald Elleway and Eric Freeman after his return from playing test cricket in England. In Ebert&#x27;s first season with Port Adelaide the club qualified for the 1968 SANFL Grand Final against Sturt, reigning premiers for the past two seasons. Sturt won the match by 27 points. At the end of year Ebert was the recipient of Port Adelaide&#x27;s leading goal-kicker award in his debut season after kicking 44 goals. He was also awarded the club&#x27;s best first year player award.

In 1969, Ebert moved from the forward line to the centre and consolidated the position as his own in the Port Adelaide line up. It was during the 1969 SANFL season that members of Port Adelaide&#x27;s golden era were retiring from football en masse, resulting in Fos Williams providing league debuts to 15 first-year players. As a result of this influx of junior players the club finished sixth, winning 9 of 20 games.

In 1970, Ebert was selected for the South Australian state football team for the first time. Port Adelaide finished the 1970 SANFL season as minor premiers for the first time since the club won the 1965 SANFL Grand Final. They would lose both finals to eventual 1970 SANFL Grand Finalists Glenelg and Sturt, the latter recording their fifth straight premiership. At the end of the season, Port Adelaide recognised Ebert as the club&#x27;s best player during their finals series.

During the 1971 pre-season, Port Adelaide defeated South Melbourne in a trial match in Victoria. On 26 June 1971 the publication &quot;Inside Football&quot; reported that Carlton had approached Port Adelaide with the intention of freeing Ebert from his contract to play for them in the VFL. Ebert confirmed that he returned to Melbourne, after South Australia played Victoria in that state earlier in the year, to meet Carlton officials but that nothing came of it, saying, &quot;I haven&#x27;t heard from Carlton since I went over after the State game. It was during this year that Ebert won his first Magarey Medal, awarded to the fairest and most brilliant player in the SANFL, receiving 21 votes from the league umpires, one more vote than runner up Peter Marker and Phil Haughan, who both received 20 votes each. In 1971 Ebert was also awarded his first Port Adelaide best and fairest. Port Adelaide reached the 1971 SANFL Grand Final but lost to minor premiers North Adelaide by 20 points.

In 1972, Port Adelaide again reached the SANFL Grand Final and again lost to North Adelaide, this time by 56 points. North Adelaide went on to win the 1972 Championship of Australia defeating Carlton. At the end of the season Ebert was awarded his second club best and fairest.

For the 1973 SANFL season, Port Adelaide finished the minor round fourth. On 8 September 1973, the club faced fifth place Norwood, at Norwood Oval, in the Elimination Final. Norwood won the match by 36 points in what was Fos Williams&#x27;s last outing as coach of Port Adelaide. Twenty-six years later Fos Williams said that Ebert was the best player he had seen play for Port Adelaide and that &quot;it was my privilege to coach him&quot;. At the conclusion of the 1973 SANFL season, Alan Schwab from Richmond and Ron Joseph from North Melbourne both made approaches to Ebert offering him contracts to play for their respective clubs in the VFL. Footscray and Melbourne also made approaches regarding acquiring Ebert around this time.

==== Port Adelaide captain (1974–1978) ====
For the 1974 SANFL season, John Cahill took over as Port Adelaide coach from Fos Williams, and one of his first actions was to appoint Ebert as club captain. During the 1974 pre-season Port Adelaide defeated South Melbourne on Alberton Oval by 10 points. During the season at a Port Adelaide fundraiser at Alberton Oval titled &#x27;Build Local Players&#x27;, Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was present and congratulated Ebert on his season to that point. Ebert won the 1974 Magarey Medal, his second, in front of runner-up Rick Davies of Sturt. Port Adelaide lost the 1974 SANFL Preliminary Final to Glenelg by 49 points with Ebert&#x27;s summation published in the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; being &quot;Disappointed...what else can I say?&quot;.

In 1975, Ebert captained the South Australian state team for the first time. Port Adelaide finished the minor round of the 1975 SANFL season in fourth place. Ebert was best on ground in Port Adelaide&#x27;s 30-point win over North Adelaide in the First Elimination Final, collecting 42 disposals and 1 goal. The following week Port Adelaide comfortably beat reigning premiers Sturt by 67 points in the First Semi Final. Port Adelaide lost the Preliminary Final to Norwood by 30 points despite leading at the end of the third quarter by 6 points.

Port Adelaide finished the 1976 SANFL season as minor premiers, two and a half wins ahead of second placed Sturt. Ebert was selected as captain and centre in &quot;The News&quot; &#x27;1976 Team of the Year&#x27;. That year Ebert won his third Magarey Medal by a record margin of 17 votes over runner-up Barry Norsworthy of Central District. With 42 votes he became the sixth SANFL player to become a triple Magarey medallist. In the lead up to the 1976 Magarey Medal, Ebert noted that he would rather win the premiership than have another Magarey Medal. In an interview with Alan Shiell, Ebert stated that &quot;It&#x27;s a big thrill to win the medal but its still an individual award&quot;. Port Adelaide qualified for the 1976 SANFL Grand Final after defeating Glenelg by 43 points in the Second Semi Final. That years SANFL Grand Final sold a state record 66,987 tickets. When the SANFL ran out of tickets they opened Football Park&#x27;s gates for free and the crowd grew by an estimated 15,000. The gates were shut by police 90 minutes before the bounce as spectators were being crushed. Subsequently, the police allowed thousands of spectators onto the field to sit along the fence to prevent any further physical injuries. In Ebert&#x27;s fourth attempt at winning an SANFL Grand Final, he and his club were unsuccessful, with Sturt defeating Port Adelaide by 41 points. During an interview with Mike Sheehan on &quot;Open Mike&quot; regarding the loss of the 1976 SANFL Grand Final, in the context of Port Adelaide having now lost its last four Grand Finals, Ebert noted that he started to question &quot;whether I was to blame&quot; for the club&#x27;s failure to win a premiership.

After two seasons where Port Adelaide was forced to play games away from Alberton Oval, the club returned to playing SANFL games at its traditional venue in front of record crowds, including an attendance of 22,738 against Norwood on 11 June 1977. Ebert won his first premiership as a player as Port Adelaide broke its 12-year drought, defeating Glenelg at Football Park in the 1977 SANFL Grand Final. Before the presentation of the Thomas Seymour Hill Trophy, thousands of spectators stormed the ground. When Ebert recalled this moment he noted that &quot;[i]t was quite dangerous to have close to ten thousand people just stampede onto the oval into a really confined space. We just looked for our teammates and got into the huddle...Everyone just wanted to get out there and be a part of it&quot;. Ebert kept only one guernsey from his playing career, the one he wore in the 1977 premiership decider. Ebert was awarded SANFL life membership during the 1977 SANFL season. 
Following the success of Port Adelaide&#x27;s 1977 premiership, the club, led by Ebert, finished fourth during the minor round of the 1978 SANFL season, qualifying for finals. Ebert finished runner up by one vote in the 1978 Magarey Medal count to Kym Hodgeman of Glenelg. Port Adelaide comfortably beat West Torrens in the Elimination Final. The club then faced Glenelg, 1977 runners-up, in the First Semi Final. Glenelg were in control of the game for the first three quarters but a &quot;gutsy&quot; effort by Ebert in the midfield helped Port Adelaide win the match and qualify for the Preliminary Final against Norwood.

===North Melbourne (1979)===
On 22 January 1979 Ebert spoke to Bob McLean, Port Adelaide&#x27;s general manager, informing him of his intention to play with North Melbourne for the 1979 VFL season. In response McLean tabled to Ebert the largest contract offer in the history of the Port Adelaide Football Club but Ebert declined. Many Victorian Football League clubs had chased Ebert for a decade until North Melbourne finally won his signature. Port Adelaide agreed to lease Ebert to North Melbourne for the 1979 season in exchange for Mark Dawson, as well as paying Ebert $35,000. In response to Ebert moving from the SANFL to the VFL, the former league&#x27;s president Max Basheer lamented that &quot;[f]rom a state and club viewpoint we cannot afford to lose players of this calibre&quot;. During 1979 Ebert continued to operate his business, a sports store, in Adelaide. Ebert would fly to Melbourne for the Tuesday training session, fly back to Adelaide, work until the middle of Thursday, fly to Melbourne again, play for North Melbourne in the VFL, and fly back Saturday night. North Melbourne agreed to cover Ebert&#x27;s large travel costs.

According to Malcolm Blight, when North Melbourne suffered a series of injuries during 1979, Ron Barassi utilised Ebert in a range of different positions. Ebert&#x27;s tally of twenty-five games for North Melbourne is the VFL/AFL record for the most games in a career in that league that only lasted one season. During his season with North Melbourne Ebert would play alongside Malcolm Blight, Graham Cornes, Keith Greig, Ross Glendinning, Wayne Schimmelbusch, Gary Dempsey and Graham Melrose. Ebert collected the most disposals of any North Melbourne player during 1979. North Melbourne finished second on the ladder and reached the Preliminary Final.

After a challenging year balancing his business, family and football commitments Ebert did not consider playing another season with North Melbourne in 1980. Despite this, when Ebert was asked if he was glad he played for North Melbourne he unequivocally answered affirmatively saying &quot;Absolutely...It was one of the most demanding, one of the most exciting and one of the most satisfying years that I can remember.&quot;

===Port Adelaide return (1980–1987)===

Ebert returned to Port Adelaide as a player for the 1980 SANFL season. From his experiences the previous year playing in the VFL with North Melbourne, Ebert suggested Port Adelaide increase the weight training it required of its players, noting that the Victorian players were more advanced in this facet of the game. During the season Ebert played forward alongside Tim Evans, who that year kicked 144 goals in the SANFL, a record at the time. After a dominant season finishing top of the ladder, Port Adelaide entered the 1980 SANFL Grand Final against Norwood, who finished the minor round fifth, as firm favourites. Norwood provided a strong challenge, leading the match at three quarter time, but Port Adelaide, who lost Tim Evans with an injury during the game, mounted a comeback, winning the premiership decider by 18 points. Ebert also won his record-setting fourth Magarey Medal in 1980, garnering 49 votes from the SANFL&#x27;s umpires. Runner-up Michael Taylor of Norwood, who was coincidentally sitting on the table next to Ebert at the Magarey Medal gala, was first to congratulate him on winning the fourth medal. During the 1980 SANFL season Ebert broke John Cahill&#x27;s games played record of 264 senior matches for Port Adelaide. Ebert retired with 392 games for Port Adelaide, a record that has never been beaten. In 2020 Ebert described Port Adelaide&#x27;s 1980 side as being &quot;as good a side here in South Australia that I had ever played with&quot;.

In September 1981, during an interview, Ebert, then aged 32, noted that &quot;When you get to 30 everyone wants you to retire. But I still enjoy competing; I&#x27;m happy to compete with any age group&quot;. Port Adelaide defeated Glenelg by 51 points in the 1981 SANFL Grand Final. Post-match, Ebert was awarded the inaugural Jack Oatey Medal in recognition of being the best player afield during the game. This was Port Adelaide&#x27;s third consecutive SANFL premiership, although Ebert missed the 1979 SANFL Grand Final whilst he was with North Melbourne.

On 12 June 1982, an interstate match was held at Football Park between Western Australia and a South Australian side featuring eight Port Adelaide players including Ebert. In that match South Australia defeated Western Australia by 116 points. Port Adelaide finished the 1982 SANFL season as minor premiers. Port Adelaide reached the 1982 SANFL Preliminary Final but its quest for a fourth consecutive premiership was ended in a fiery match against Glenelg, who won the game by 1 point. During this match an infamous incident between David Granger and Graham Cornes occurred, with the former punching the latter. Trevor Gill, in writing his match report for The News, observed that Norwood, Glenelg&#x27;s opponent in the 1982 SANFL Grand Final, would be beneficiaries of the gruelling encounter against Port Adelaide. The following week Norwood did win the Grand Final, defeating Glenelg by 62 points. On 7 October 1982, Port Adelaide coach John Cahill left the club to accepted the head coaching role at Collingwood. As a result of this Ebert was appointed captain-coach of Port Adelaide on 15 October 1982. Ebert would be one of the last playing coaches in senior Australian rules football.

==== Port Adelaide captain-coach (1983–1985) ====
In his first season as captain-coach of Port Adelaide Ebert would start the 1983 SANFL season without the club&#x27;s star centre-half back Greg Phillips, who had joined John Cahill at Collingwood. On 16 May 1983 at Football Park, Ebert captained South Australia for the third time, in what was the states first win over Victoria since 1965.

On 23 June 1984 in a game against West Torrens at Football Park Ebert broke the SANFL record for most games played in that competition, surpassing Paul Bagshaw&#x27;s tally of 360 games. In 1984 Port Adelaide reached its only Grand Final with Ebert as coach. Port Adelaide&#x27;s opponent in the 1984 SANFL Grand Final was Norwood who finished the minor round in fifth position. In front of 50,271 spectators Port Adelaide relinquished a 3-point lead at the final change of the 1984 SANFL Grand Final to eventually lose to Norwood by 9 points. During 1984 Ebert was presented with the Adidas Golden Boot award by Ted Whitten. At the time Ebert was only the fifth Australian recipient of the award.

Ebert retired as a player at the end of 1985 for Port Adelaide, where his 392 games remains a club record. In 2020 Ebert joked about the longevity of his career, noting that &quot;I guess when you are captain-coach you can pick yourself!&quot;.

====Other matches====
Ebert also played 29 interstate/State of Origin matches for South Australia and one pre-season/night series match for North Melbourne (these are considered senior by the SANFL but not the VFL/AFL). If these are included, Ebert played a total of 447 senior career games.

The VFL/AFL and SANFL list Ebert&#x27;s total as 446, excluding his pre-season/night series match for North Melbourne.

Regardless of the differing viewpoints, Ebert&#x27;s total was the all-time record in elite Australian rules football at the time of his retirement, and Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke wrote Ebert a letter congratulating him on his achievement.

Ebert held the record until it was broken by Peter Carey in either Round 6 or Round 7 of 1988; Carey retired at the end of that season with a total of 467 senior career games.

Ebert played in the inaugural E. J. Whitten Legends Game in 1996.

==== Port Adelaide non-playing coach (1986–1987) ====
Ebert continued at the club as a non-playing coach for the 1986 SANFL season. However, Ebert began his first season as a non-playing coach without his star wingman and reigning club best and fairest, Craig Bradley, who had been acquired by Carlton. Brad Gotch also returned to Victoria to play for St Kilda. During a training session Port Adelaide&#x27;s full forward Tim Evans suffered a cracked tibia after stepping on a sprinkler, leading the club&#x27;s greatest goal-kicker to retire. Port Adelaide in 1986 finished the minor round in third place behind North Adelaide and Glenelg. Greg Anderson won the 1986 Magarey Medal despite being knocked unconscious the week before against Glenelg. In the 1986 SANFL First Semi-Final, Woodville defeated Port Adelaide by 7 points.

The 1987 SANFL season signalled a significant list restructure for Port Adelaide. Ebert debuted eight new juniors to Port Adelaide&#x27;s league side during the season. Greg Phillips and Bruce Abernethy returned from Collingwood to Port Adelaide to resume playing for the club in 1987. Meanwhile Dwayne Russell and Ben Harris left for VFL clubs Geelong and the Brisbane Bears. Despite overtures from Essendon, Port Adelaide and Ebert managed to hold reigning Magarey Medallist Greg Anderson to the final year of contract for the 1987 SANFL season. Port Adelaide improved on their minor round performance the previous year under Ebert, this time finishing second on the ladder, behind North Adelaide. The club lost both of its 1987 finals against Norwood and Glenelg by 34 points and 2 points, respectively.

After failing to win a final for three consecutive seasons after the 1984 SANFL Grand Final loss, Ebert was sacked as coach of Port Adelaide and was replaced by John Cahill for the 1988 SANFL season. Although the three seasons preceding Ebert&#x27;s dismissal as coach were ultimately unsuccessful, he is credited with blooding a large number of champions that helped propel the club into the Australian Football League. These players include:
* 1983 – Tim Ginever
* 1984 – Greg Anderson, Darren Smith, Wayne Mahney, Roger Delaney
* 1985 – Mark Tylor, Rohan J. Smith, David Hynes, George Fiacchi, Darryl Borlase
* 1986 – Geoff Phelps
* 1987 – Andrew Obst, Paul Northeast, Scott Hodges, David Brown

=== Woodville coach (1988–1990) ===
At the conclusion of 1977, Woodville coach Malcolm Blight accepted an offer from Geelong to move to Victoria and coach the club for the upcoming 1988 VFL season. Ebert, having recently lost his position as Port Adelaide coach to John Cahill, accepted to fill the equivalent role at Woodville. In his first season as coach of Woodville, the club won the 1988 Escort Cup Final defeating Port Adelaide by 45 points in front of 31,210 at Football Park. The 1988 Escort Cup was the only piece of silverware that the Woodville Football Club ever won.

Woodville merged with West Torrens at the end of the 1990 SANFL season. Ebert was thus the last coach of Woodville as a stand-alone club.

=== South Australia coach (1996–1998) ===
Ebert coached the South Australian state team from 1996 to 1998. The side achieved memorable wins over Western Australia in 1996 and 1998.

=== Playing style ===
Ebert was a strong-bodied player whose physical build and stamina allowed him to dominate football matches. With a high skill level, errors were rare, and his ability to hit teammates with accurate, spearing passes made him very effective in attacking roles. Ebert was able to win his own ball and could quickly handball effectively under pressure.

In 1971, under coach Fos Williams, Williams had a rule that nobody playing in his side could do a drop kick, which requires an extreme level of precision to execute effectively and accurately on a very consistent basis. However, according to teammate Brian Cunningham, after Ebert kicked a couple of goals in a game with a drop kick, Williams acknowledged Ebert&#x27;s skill and made a special dispensation for him—and him alone.

Gordon Schwartz, football journalist, described Russell Ebert as &quot;a perfect example to the younger generation. On field he maintains expressionless concentration, never indulges in tantrums, and plays with great intensity and energy...Few players of his ability are as industrious. He doesn&#x27;t believe that his talent entitles him to rest on his laurels and let other people do most of the work.&quot;

John Cahill, team-mate and coach of Ebert, described the latter&#x27;s playing style as being &quot;so strong over the ball - and such power in his legs. He rarely fell over; he was perfectly balanced.&quot;

== Media ==
In 1991, Ebert accepted a role working as a commentator at Adelaide radio station FIVEaa. At the station Ebert also worked as a sports talkback panellist. Ebert was a member of the FIVEaa commentary team, along with Ken Cunningham and Chris Dittmar, that called Port Adelaide&#x27;s win in the 2004 AFL Grand Final.

== Charity work ==

Ebert used his footballing fame in South Australia to benefit a large array of local charities over many decades. After his death, Warren Tredrea noted that Ebert &quot;was the first to give back using his profile as a champion footballer to help many others through his work with the community programs at the football club and charities away from the club. His legacy goes beyond the game of football&quot;. Ebert himself noted that role models in the community are &quot;uniquely poised to positively impact...each time you see that face, each time you hear about the Port Adelaide Football Club you will resonate with the messages that were given on that day.”

In 1980, Ebert became involved with the Crippled Children&#x27;s Association (CCA) along with Barrie Robran and Peter Marker. They worked together with the charity for 25 years. The CCA was eventually renamed as Novita Children&#x27;s Services. In 2006 Ebert was a co-founder of the Mighty River Run with John Riddell and Jason Carter. The event is a convoy of boats that travels along the River Murray to raise money for Novita in order to assist people living with disability in South Australia. The 2021 Mighty River Run was conducted in Ebert&#x27;s honour and raised over $700,000 for Novita.

Ebert was involved with the Outback Odyssey fundraiser for almost three decades. Between 2013 and 2021 the Outback Odyssey raised over $1,000,000 for the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

Ebert was involved in educational programs that sought to prevent domestic violence. In 2015 Ebert welcomed Centacare and the South Australian Department of Education into Alberton Oval to develop a project that sought to educate teenage boys about respectful relationships. The project became known as the &#x27;Power to End Violence against Women&#x27; and between 2016 and 2021 over 5,000 students have been involved in the program. Ebert was quoted as saying “It&#x27;s not only domestic violence ... it is [about] respecting women.”

In 1999, Ebert returned to Port Adelaide to help expand the clubs involvement in community programs. For the following 20 years, before his illness in 2021, Ebert was a key organiser for the club&#x27;s array of charitable programs. Ebert was involved with the Ice Factor Program that sought to provide team sport to disengaged youth. In 2011 Ebert provided lectures for aged care provider ACH Group outlining strategies on how to stay healthy in later years.

== Personal life ==

Ebert married Dian Lehmann. Ebert and Dian raised three children, Tammie, Ben and Brett. Ebert&#x27;s brothers Jeff and Craig also played for Port Adelaide in the SANFL making their debuts in 1972 and 1981 respectively. In the 2002 AFL National Draft, Ebert&#x27;s son Brett was selected under the league&#x27;s Father-son rule to play for Port Adelaide in the AFL after playing for the same club in the SANFL. Ebert&#x27;s nephew Brad also both played for Port Adelaide in the SANFL and AFL. Brad Ebert&#x27;s grandfather was Trevor Obst, and his great-grandfather was Ken Obst; both also played for Port Adelaide.

=== Death ===
In late December 2020, Ebert was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Ebert first publicly disclosed his health issues on 26 December 2020 at a Port Adelaide past players reunion. On 5 November 2021, Ebert died at the age of 72 from AML. Later that evening, Steven Marshall, Premier of South Australia, offered his family the option of honouring Ebert with a state funeral. On 9 November 2021, the Ebert family, along with the indented host, the Port Adelaide Football Club, accepted the offer for a state funeral to be held at Alberton Oval. On 16 November 2021, approximately 4,000 people attended Ebert&#x27;s state funeral.

Gillon McLachlan, chief executive officer of the AFL, issued a statement paying tribute to Ebert, concluding that &quot;The child in me will always admire the great footballer but the adult that I am is in awe of what Russell Ebert was as a man, and his loss after bravely confronting his illness is devastating for his family, for his club, his many fans and for the state of South Australia, where he has given so much. He was everything you would hope to be in a man, and perhaps the best of all of us.&quot; At the Glenelg Football Club Centenary Gala, held a few days after Ebert had passed away, the audience paused to celebrate his career, and the band played the INXS song &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; in his honour. &quot;Seven News Adelaide&quot; produced a 20-minute tribute to Ebert shortly after his death titled &quot;Remembering Russell&quot;.

== Honours ==

In 1984, Ebert was awarded an Order of Australia Medal for his service to Australian football.

Ebert is widely held to be the greatest player to have played for the Port Adelaide Football Club. He was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996 and is centre for Port Adelaide&#x27;s greatest team. In June 2022, Ebert was posthumously elevated to Legend status in the Australian Football Hall of Fame, making him the 32nd individual and only the second player after Haydn Bunton Sr. (who played 17 games for the club after playing the majority of his career at Fitzroy and Subiaco) to be awarded the highest individual honour in the sport.

In 2021, Ebert was recognised with &quot;Legend&quot; status in the South Australian Sport Hall of Fame.

In 2014, the western gate into Alberton Oval was named as the Russell Ebert Gate in honour of Ebert. In 2015, a statute of Ebert, sculpted by Tim Thompson, was unveiled on the eastern concourse of Adelaide Oval. Ebert was the second and currently only one of four Australian rules footballers to have a statue at Adelaide Oval, with the other players being Barrie Robran, Malcolm Blight, and Ken Farmer.

An online poll of Port Adelaide supporters in 2015 saw Ebert, three decades after he had played his last football game, garner 60% of the vote, ahead of next best Gavin Wanganeen, who received 23%. The &quot;Adelaide Advertiser&quot;, in recognition of Port Adelaide&#x27;s 150th anniversary in 2020, selected the club&#x27;s all-time top 150 players, from both the AFL and SANFL, and ranked Ebert at number one.

The SANFL scheduled a &quot;Russell Ebert Tribute Match&quot; for 22 May 2022 on Loxton Oval between Port Adelaide and West Adelaide in honour of Ebert. A curtain raiser to this match is planned to feature Loxton and Waikerie, Ebert&#x27;s two junior clubs.

<text>Glycogen storage disease type II (GSD-II), also called Pompe disease, and formerly known as GSD-IIa or Limb–girdle muscular dystrophy 2V, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder which damages muscle and nerve cells throughout the body. It is caused by an accumulation of glycogen in the lysosome due to a deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme (GAA). The inability to break down glycogen within the lysosomes of cells leads to progressive muscle weakness throughout the body and affects various body tissues, particularly in the heart, skeletal muscles, liver and the nervous system.

GSD-II and Danon disease are the only glycogen storage diseases characterised by a defect in lysosomal metabolism. It was first identified in 1932 by Dutch pathologist Joannes Cassianus Pompe, making it the first glycogen storage disease to be discovered.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Infantile-Onset (IOPD)===
The infantile-onset (IOPD) form usually comes to medical attention within the first few months of life, either clinically or through newborn screening. The usual presenting features are cardiomyopathy, cardiomegaly, hypotonia, respiratory distress, muscle weakness, feeding difficulties, and failure to thrive.
IOPD patients can be further classified by Cross-Reactive Immunological Material (CRIM) status which is an important predictor of clinical response. Patients that produce no GAA protein are referred to as CRIM negative. Therefore, they can develop highly sustained antibody titers for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Immunomodulation or immunotherapy is an effective treatment to prevent an immune response to ERT.

The main clinical findings include floppy baby appearance, delayed motor milestones, and feeding difficulties. Moderate hepatomegaly may or may not be present. Facial features include macroglossia, hypernasal speech, hearing loss, and myopathic facies. Cardiopulmonary involvement is manifested by increased respiratory rate, use of accessory muscles for respiration, recurrent chest infections, decreased air entry in the left lower zone (due to cardiomegaly), arrhythmias, and evidence of heart failure.

Before the development of a treatment, the median age at death in untreated cases was 8.7 months, usually due to cardiorespiratory failure. However, this outcome has drastically changed since enzyme replacement therapy became available, improving with early initiation of treatment.

===Late onset form===
The Late-onset (LOPD) form differs from the infantile-onset principally in the relative lack of cardiac involvement. The onset has a slower progression and can present at any decade of life. Cardiac involvement may occur but is milder than in the infantile form. Skeletal involvement is more prominent with a predilection for the lower limbs.

Late-onset features include impaired cough, recurrent chest infections, hypotonia, progressive muscle weakness, delayed motor milestones, difficulty swallowing or chewing, and reduced vital capacity.

One of the difficulties with attributing the illness solely to genetic deficiencies is that, even between people as genetically similar as identical twins, the symptoms may differ. For example, one may be in pain, whilst the other may not. Similarly, the rate of muscle deterioration of one may be faster than the other.

Prognosis depends on the age of onset of symptoms with a better prognosis being associated with later onset disease.

==Cause==

Pompe disease has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two faulty copies of the gene—one from each parent—are required to be born with the disorder. As with all cases of autosomal recessive inheritance, children have a one in four chance of inheriting the disorder when both parents carry the defective gene, and although both parents carry one copy of the defective gene, they are usually unaffected by the disorder.

The disease is caused by a mutation in a gene (acid alpha-glucosidase: also known as acid maltase) on the long arm of chromosome 17 at 17q25.2-q25.3 (base pair 75,689,876 to 75,708,272). The number of mutations described is currently (in 2010) 289 with 67 being non-pathogenic mutations and 197 pathogenic mutations. The remainder are still being evaluated for their association with disease.

The gene spans approximately 20 kb and contains 20 exons with the first exon being noncoding. The coding sequence of the putative catalytic site domain is interrupted in the middle by an intron of 101 bp. The promoter has features characteristic of a housekeeping gene. The GC content is high (80%) and distinct TATA and CCAAT motifs are lacking.

Most cases appear to be due to three mutations. A transversion (T → G) mutation is the most common among adults with this disorder. This mutation interrupts a site of RNA splicing.

The gene encodes a protein—acid alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20)—which is a lysosomal hydrolase. The protein is an enzyme that normally degrades the alpha -1,4 and alpha -1,6 linkages in glycogen, maltose and isomaltose and is required for the degradation of 1–3% of cellular glycogen. The deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of structurally normal glycogen in lysosomes and cytoplasm in affected individuals. Excessive glycogen storage within lysosomes may interrupt the normal functioning of other organelles and lead to cellular injury.

A putative homologue—acid alpha-glucosidase-related gene 1—has been identified in the nematode &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;.

==Diagnosis==
In the early-onset form, an infant will present with poor feeding causing failure to thrive, or with difficulty breathing. The usual initial investigations include chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography. Typical findings are those of an enlarged heart with non-specific conduction defects. Biochemical investigations include serum creatine kinase (typically increased 10 fold) with lesser elevations of the serum aldolase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase. Diagnosis is made by estimating the acid alpha-glucosidase activity in either skin biopsy (fibroblasts), muscle biopsy (muscle cells), or white blood cells. The choice of sample depends on the facilities available at the diagnostic laboratory.

In the late-onset form, an adult will present with gradually progressive arm and leg weakness, with worsening respiratory function. Electromyography may be used initially to distinguish Pompe from other causes of limb weakness. The findings on biochemical tests are similar to those of the infantile form, with the caveat that the creatine kinase may be normal in some cases. The diagnosis is by estimation of the enzyme activity in a suitable sample.

On May 17, 2013, the Secretary&#x27;s Discretionary Advisory Committee on Heritable Diseases in Newborns and Children (DACHDNC) approved a recommendation to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to add Pompe to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). The HHS secretary must first approve the recommendation before the disease is formally added to the panel.

===Classification===
There are exceptions, but levels of alpha-glucosidase determine the type of GSD-II an individual may have. More alpha-glucosidase present in the individual&#x27;s muscles means symptoms occur later in life and progress more slowly. GSD-II is broadly divided into two onset forms based on the age symptoms occur.

The infantile-onset form is usually diagnosed at 4–8 months; muscles appear normal but are limp and weak preventing the child from lifting their head or rolling over. As the disease progresses, heart muscles thicken and progressively fail. Without treatment, death usually occurs due to heart failure and respiratory weakness.

The late or later onset form occurs later than one to two years and progresses more slowly than the Infantile-onset form. One of the first symptoms is a progressive decrease in muscle strength starting with the legs and moving to smaller muscles in the trunk and arms, such as the diaphragm and other muscles required for breathing. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. Enlargement of the heart muscles and rhythm disturbances are not significant features but occur in some cases.

==Treatment==
Cardiac and respiratory complications are treated symptomatically. Physical and occupational therapy may be beneficial for some patients. Alterations in diet may provide temporary improvement but will not alter the course of the disease. Genetic counseling can provide families with information regarding risk in future pregnancies.

On April 28, 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a biologic license application (BLA) for alglucosidase alfa, rhGAA (Myozyme), the first treatment for patients with Pompe disease, developed by a team of Duke University researchers. This was based on enzyme replacement therapy using biologically active recombinant human alglucosidase alfa produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Myozyme falls under the FDA orphan drug designation and was approved under a priority review.

The FDA approved Myozyme for administration by intravenous infusion of the solution. The safety and efficacy of Myozyme were assessed in two separate clinical trials in 39 infantile-onset patients with Pompe disease ranging in age from 1 month to 3.5 years at the time of the first infusion. Myozyme treatment prolongs ventilator-free survival and overall survival. Early diagnosis and early treatment lead to much better outcomes. The treatment is not without side effects which include fever, flushing, skin rash, increased heart rate, and even shock; these conditions, however, are usually manageable.

Myozyme costs an average of US$300,000 a year and must be taken for the patient&#x27;s entire life, so some American health insurers have refused to pay for it. In August 2006, Health Canada approved Myozyme for the treatment of Pompe disease. In June 2007, the Canadian Common Drug Review issued its recommendations regarding public funding for Myozyme therapy. Their recommendation was to provide funding to treat a tiny subset of Pompe patients (Infants less one year of age with cardiomyopathy).

In May 2010, the FDA approved Lumizyme for the treatment of late-onset Pompe disease. Lumizyme and Myozyme have the same generic ingredient (alglucosidase alfa) and manufacturer (Genzyme Corporation). The difference between these two products is in the manufacturing process. Myozyme is made using a 160-L bioreactor, while Lumizyme uses a 4000-L bioreactor. Because of the difference in the manufacturing process, the FDA claims that the two products are biologically different. Myozyme is FDA approved for replacement therapy for infantile-onset Pompe disease.

In July 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the authorization of avalglucosidase alfa. Avalglucosidase alfa (Nexviazyme) was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2021, and in the European Union in June 2022.

In December 2022, the EMA recommended the authorization of cipaglucosidase alfa. The approval was given in June 2023. In the EU, the therapy is available to all age groups without restrictions on weight of patients.

In September 2023, the FDA approved a two-component therapy of Pombiliti (cipaglucosidase alfa-atga) and Opfolda (miglustat) 65 mg capsules for adults living with late-onset Pompe disease weighing more than 40 kg and who are not improving on their current enzyme replacement therapy.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for individuals with Pompe disease varies according to the onset and severity of symptoms, along with lifestyle factors. Without treatment the infantile form (which can typically be predicted by mutation analysis) of the disease is particularly lethal — in these cases, the time taken to begin treatment is critical, with evidence that days (not weeks or months) matter.

Myozyme (alglucosidase alfa) is a recombinant form of the human enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase, and is also currently being used to replace the missing enzyme. In a study which included the largest cohort of patients with Pompe disease treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to date findings showed that Myozyme treatment clearly prolongs ventilator-free survival and overall survival in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease as compared to an untreated historical control population. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that initiation of ERT before six months of age, which could be facilitated by newborn screening, shows great promise to reduce the mortality and disability associated with this devastating disorder. Taiwan and several states in the United States have started newborn screening and results of such regimens in early diagnosis and early initiation of the therapy have dramatically improved the outcome of the disease; many of these babies have reached normal motor developmental milestones.

Another factor affecting the treatment response is the generation of antibodies against the infused enzyme, which is particularly severe in Pompe infants who have a complete deficiency of the acid alpha-glucosidase. Immune tolerance therapy to eliminate these antibodies has improved the treatment outcome.

A Late Onset Treatment Study (LOTS) was published in 2010. The study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aglucosidase alfa in juvenile and adult patients with Pompe disease. LOTS was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 90 patients at eight primary sites in the United States and Europe. Participants received either aglucosidase alfa or a placebo every other week for 18 months. The average age of study participants was 44 years. The primary efficacy endpoints of the study sought to determine the effect of Myozyme on functional endurance as measured by the six-minute walk test and to determine the effect of aglucosidase alfa on pulmonary function as measured by percent predicted forced vital capacity.

The results showed that, at 78 weeks, patients treated with aglucosidase alfa increased their distance walked in six minutes by an average of approximately 25 meters as compared with the placebo group which declined by 3 meters (P=0.03). The placebo group did not show any improvement from baseline. The average baseline distance walked in six minutes in both groups was approximately 325 meters.
Percent predicted forced vital capacity in the group of patients treated with aglucosidase alfa increased by 1.2 percent at 78 weeks. In contrast, it declined by approximately 2.2 percent in the placebo group (P=0.006).

There is an emerging recognition of the role that diet and exercise can play in functionally limiting symptom progression. This is an area for further study, as there is no clear consensus guideline, but rather a body of case study work that suggests that appropriate physical activity can be an effective tool in managing disease progression. In one such study, side-alternating vibration training was used 3 times weekly for 15 weeks. The results showed that, at 15 weeks, the patient had a 116-meter (70%) improvement to their 6MWT, which is significant compared with the results from the aforementioned LOTS study.
==Epidemiology==
The total birth prevalence of Pompe disease is 1:18,698. 

== History ==
The disease is named after Joannes Cassianus Pompe, who characterized it in 1932. Pompe described the accumulation of glycogen in muscle tissue in some cases of a previously unknown disorder. This accumulation was difficult to explain as the enzymes involved in the usual metabolism of glucose and glycogen were all present and functioning.

The basis for the disease remained a puzzle until Christian de Duve&#x27;s discovery of lysosomes in 1955 for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1974. His co-worker Henri G. Hers realised in 1965 that the deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme (alpha-glucosidase) for the breakdown of glycogen could explain the symptoms of Pompe disease. This discovery led to establishing the concept of lysosomal storage diseases, of which 49 have been described (to date).

Despite recognizing the basis for the disease, treatment proved difficult. Administration of the enzyme leads to its uptake by the liver and not the muscle cells where it is needed. In the early 1990s Dutch scientists Arnold Reuser and Ans van der Ploeg were able to show that using alpha-glucosidase containing phosphorylated mannose residues purified from bovine testes increased the enzyme&#x27;s activity in normal mouse muscles.

Later in 1998, Yuan-Tsong Chen and colleagues at Duke University, using the enzyme produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells demonstrated for the first time that the enzyme can clear the glycogen and improve muscle function in Pompe disease quail. The results of the work at Duke were impressive with one treated bird recovering to the point of being able to fly again.

This was followed by the production of clinical-grade alpha-glucosidase in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in the milk of transgenic rabbits. This work eventually culminated in the start of clinical trials with the first clinical trial including four babies receiving enzyme from rabbit milk at Erasmus MC Sophia Children&#x27;s Hospital and three babies receiving enzyme grown in CHO cells at Duke University in 1999.

The currently approved Myozyme is manufactured by Genzyme Corp. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its development was a complex process. Genzyme first partnered with Pharming Group NV which had managed to produce acid alpha-glucosidase from the milk of transgenic rabbits. They also partnered with a second group based at Duke University using Chinese hamster ovary cells. In 2001, Genzyme acquired Novazyme which was also working on this enzyme. Genzyme also had its product (Myozyme) grown in CHO cells under development. In November 2001, Genzyme chief executive Henri Termeer organised a systematic comparison of the various potential drugs in a mouse model of Pompe disease. It was found that the Duke enzyme was the most efficacious, followed by Myozyme. However, due to easier manufacture of Myozyme, work on the other products was discontinued.

Funding for research in this field was in part provided by the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the Acid Maltase Deficiency Association in the US and by the Association of Glycogen Storage Disease in the UK, as well as the International Pompe Association.

John Crowley became involved in the fund-raising efforts in 1998 after two of his children were diagnosed with Pompe. He joined the company Novazyme in 1999, which was working on enzyme replacement treatment for Pompe. Novazyme was sold to Genzyme in 2001 for over US$100 million. The 2010 film &quot;Extraordinary Measures&quot; is based on Crowley&#x27;s search for a cure.

As of 2019, many biomedical companies are developing gene therapy in hopes of helping the body create alpha-glucosidase on its own.

In 2021, in-utero enzyme replacement therapy infusions were provided to the fetus of an Ottawa, Ontario, mother who had had two previous children with Pompe disease. The medical team was a collaboration between Ottawa Hospital, Children&#x27;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, the University of California, San Francisco, and Duke University. The child, born in June 2021, is thriving as of November 2022.

<text>A rhabdomyoma is a benign tumor of striated muscle. Rhabdomyomas may be either cardiac or extracardiac (occurring outside the heart). Extracardiac forms of rhabdomyoma are sub-classified into three distinct types: adult type, fetal type, and genital type.

Cardiac rhabdomyomas are the most common primary tumor of the heart in infants and children. It has an association with tuberous sclerosis. In those with tuberous sclerosis, the tumor may regress and disappear completely, or remain consistent in size. A common histological feature is the presence of spider cells, which are cardiac myocytes with enlarged glycogen vacuoles separated by eosinophilic strands, resembling the legs of a spider.

It is most commonly associated with the tongue, and heart, but can also occur in other locations, such as the vagina.

Malignant skeletal muscle tumors are referred to as rhabdomyosarcoma. Only rare cases of possible malignant change have been reported in fetal rhabdomyoma. The differential diagnosis in the tongue includes ectomesenchymal chondromyxoid tumor.

==Cardiac Rhabdomyoma==

It is much more common to find metastasis from an alternate site than a primary heart tumor. However, primary cardiac tumors do occur. One of these is the cardiac rhabdomyoma. Approximately 80-90% of these tumors are found in patients with tuberous sclerosis, a genetic condition causing multiple tumors, with most found prior to the age of one. Although these tumors are most commonly treated with resection, symptomatic tumors in fetuses have been shown to decrease in size after maternal sicrolimus administration. If clinically silent, they can be watched with routine imaging as the tumor will likely spontaneously regress.

=== Clinical Picture ===
The specific clinical picture of a patient with a cardiac rhabdomyoma is determined by its location in the heart. However, if symptomatic, most patients will present with heart failure or an arrhythmia such as ventricular tachycardia or heart block. The severity of the symptoms will vary based on the size of the mass.

=== Detection ===

Cardiac rhabdomyomas are usually found in the ventricular walls or on the valves of the heart. With imaging techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), these tumors are being detected with increased frequency and even in the prenatal period. Routine surveillance of children with tuberous sclerosis for cardiac rhabdomyoma or other cardiovascular manifestations of their disease may include electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiography.

<text>Un Ponte Per (&quot;A Bridge to&quot;) is an Italian-based humanitarian organization created in the aftermath of the first Iraq War in 1991. Its purpose is to oppose the domination of the Southern countries of the world by those of the North and to prevent further conflict, particularly in the Mideast. In addition to its activities in the Middle East, it opened a second zone of operations in the former Yugoslavia.

Un Ponte Per operates in Iraq (as Un Ponte Per Baghdad). In September 2004 a number of the group&#x27;s workers, including Italians Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, were kidnapped. They were released three weeks later.

<doc id="1010250" wikidata="Q881855" url="?curid=1010250" title="Molar pregnancy">
<text>A molar pregnancy, also known as a hydatidiform mole, is an abnormal form of pregnancy in which a non-viable fertilized egg implants in the uterus. It falls under the category of gestational trophoblastic diseases. During a molar pregnancy, the uterus contains a growing mass characterized by swollen chorionic villi, resembling clusters of grapes. The occurrence of a molar pregnancy can be attributed to the fertilized egg lacking an original maternal nucleus. As a result, the products of conception may or may not contain fetal tissue. These molar pregnancies are categorized into two types: partial moles and complete moles, where the term &#x27;mole&#x27; simply denotes a clump of growing tissue or a ‘growth&#x27;.

A complete mole is caused by either a single sperm (90% of the time) or two sperm (10% of the time) combining with an egg that has lost its DNA. In the former case, the sperm reduplicates, leading to the formation of a &quot;complete&quot; 46-chromosome set. Typically, the genotype is 46,XX (diploid) due to subsequent mitosis of the fertilizing sperm, but it can also be 46,XY (diploid). However, 46,YY (diploid) is not observed. On the other hand, a partial mole occurs when a normal egg is fertilized by one or two sperm, which then reduplicates itself, resulting in genotypes of 69,XXY (triploid) or 92,XXXY (tetraploid).

Complete moles carry a 2–4% risk, in Western countries, of developing into choriocarcinoma and a higher risk of 10–15% in Eastern countries, with an additional 15% risk of becoming an invasive mole. In contrast, incomplete moles can become invasive as well but are not associated with choriocarcinoma. Notably, complete hydatidiform moles account for 50% of all cases of choriocarcinoma.

Molar pregnancies are relatively rare complications of pregnancy, occurring in approximately 1 in 1,000 pregnancies in the United States, while in Asia, the rates are considerably higher, reaching up to 1 in 100 pregnancies in countries like Indonesia.

==Signs and symptoms==

Molar pregnancies usually present with painless vaginal bleeding in the fourth to fifth months of pregnancy. The uterus may be larger than expected, or the ovaries may be enlarged. There may also be more vomiting than would be expected (hyperemesis). Sometimes there is an increase in blood pressure along with protein in the urine. Blood tests will show very high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

==Cause==
The cause of this condition is not completely understood. Potential risk factors may include defects in the egg, abnormalities within the uterus, or nutritional deficiencies. Women under 20 or over 40 years of age have a higher risk. Other risk factors include diets low in protein, folic acid, and carotene. The diploid set of sperm-only DNA means that all chromosomes have sperm-patterned methylation suppression of genes. This leads to overgrowth of the syncytiotrophoblast whereas dual egg-patterned methylation leads to a devotion of resources to the embryo, with an underdeveloped syncytiotrophoblast. This is considered to be the result of evolutionary competition, with male genes driving for high investment into the fetus versus female genes driving for resource restriction to maximise the number of children.

==Pathophysiology==
A hydatidiform mole is a pregnancy/conceptus in which the placenta contains grapelike vesicles (small sacs) that are usually visible to the naked eye. The vesicles arise by distention of the chorionic villi by fluid. When inspected under the microscope, hyperplasia of the trophoblastic tissue is noted. If left untreated, a hydatidiform mole will almost always end as a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage).

Based on morphology, hydatidiform moles can be divided into two types: in &quot;complete moles&quot;, all the chorionic villi are vesicular, and no sign of embryonic or fetal development is present. In &quot;partial moles&quot;, some villi are vesicular, whereas others appear more normal, and embryonic/fetal development may be seen but the fetus is always malformed and is never viable.
In rare cases, a hydatidiform mole co-exists in the uterus with a normal, viable fetus. These cases are due to twinning. The uterus contains the products of two conceptions: one with an abnormal placenta and no viable fetus (the mole), and one with a normal placenta and a viable fetus. Under careful surveillance, it is often possible for the woman to give birth to the normal child and to be cured of the mole.

===Parental origin===
In most complete moles, all nuclear genes are inherited from the father only (androgenesis). In approximately 80% of these androgenetic moles, the most probable mechanism is that an egg with an empty nucleus or no nucleus is fertilized by a single sperm, followed by a duplication of all chromosomes/genes (a process called endoreduplication). In approximately 20% of complete moles, the most probable mechanism is that an empty egg is fertilized by two sperm. In both cases, the moles are diploid (i.e. there are two copies of every chromosome). In all these cases, the mitochondrial genes are inherited from the mother, as usual.

Most partial moles are triploid (three chromosome sets). The nucleus contains one maternal set of genes and two paternal sets. The mechanism is usually the reduplication of the paternal haploid set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) fertilization of the egg.

In rare cases, hydatidiform moles are tetraploid (four chromosome sets) or have other chromosome abnormalities.

A small percentage of hydatidiform moles have biparental diploid genomes, as in normal living persons; they have two sets of chromosomes, one inherited from each biological parent. Some of these moles occur in women who carry mutations in the gene &quot;NLRP7&quot;, predisposing them towards molar pregnancy. These rare variants of hydatidiform mole may be complete or partial.

==Diagnosis==


The diagnosis is strongly suggested by ultrasound (sonogram), but definitive diagnosis requires histopathological examination. On ultrasound, the mole resembles a bunch of grapes (&quot;cluster of grapes&quot; or &quot;honeycombed uterus&quot; or &quot;snow-storm&quot;). There is increased trophoblast proliferation and enlarging of the chorionic villi, and angiogenesis in the trophoblasts is impaired.

Sometimes symptoms of hyperthyroidism are seen, due to the extremely high levels of hCG, which can mimic the effects of thyroid-stimulating hormone.
==Treatment==
Hydatidiform moles should be treated by evacuating the uterus by uterine suction or by surgical curettage as soon as possible after diagnosis, in order to avoid the risks of choriocarcinoma. Patients are followed up until their serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) level has fallen to an undetectable level. Invasive or metastatic moles (cancer) may require chemotherapy and often respond well to methotrexate. As they contain paternal antigens, the response to treatment is nearly 100%. Patients are advised not to conceive for half a year after hCG levels have normalized. The chances of having another molar pregnancy are approximately 1%.

Management is more complicated when the mole occurs together with one or more normal fetuses.

In some women, the growth can develop into gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. For women who have complete hydatidiform mole and are at high risk of this progression, evidence suggests giving prophylactic chemotherapy (known as P-chem) may reduce the risk of this happening. However P-chem may also increase toxic side effects, so more research is needed to explore its effects.

===Anesthesia=== 
The uterine curettage is generally done under the effect of anesthesia, preferably spinal anesthesia in hemodynamically stable patients. The advantages of spinal anesthesia over general anesthesia include ease of technique, favorable effects on the pulmonary system, safety in patients with hyperthyroidism and non-tocolytic pharmacological properties. Additionally, by maintaining patient&#x27;s consciousness one can diagnose the complications like uterine perforation, cardiopulmonary distress and thyroid storm at an earlier stage than when the patient is sedated or is under general anesthesia.

==Prognosis==
More than 80% of hydatidiform moles are benign. The outcome after treatment is usually excellent. Close follow-up is essential to ensure that treatment has been successful. Highly effective means of contraception are recommended to avoid pregnancy for at least 6 to 12 months. Women who have had a prior partial or complete mole have a slightly increased risk of a second hydatidiform mole in a subsequent pregnancy, meaning a future pregnancy will require an earlier ultrasound scan.

In 10 to 15% of cases, hydatidiform moles may develop into invasive moles. This condition is named &quot;persistent trophoblastic disease&quot; (PTD). The moles may intrude so far into the uterine wall that hemorrhage or other complications develop. It is for this reason that a post-operative full abdominal and chest X-ray will often be requested.

In 2 to 3% of cases, hydatidiform moles may develop into choriocarcinoma, which is a malignant, rapidly growing, and metastatic (spreading) form of cancer. Despite these factors which normally indicate a poor prognosis, the rate of cure after treatment with chemotherapy is high.

Over 90% of women with malignant, non-spreading cancer are able to survive and retain their ability to conceive and bear children. In those with metastatic (spreading) cancer, remission remains at 75 to 85%, although their childbearing ability is usually lost.

==Etymology==

The etymology is derived from &quot;hydatisia&quot; (Greek &quot;a drop of water&quot;), referring to the watery contents of the cysts, and &quot;mole&quot; (from Latin &quot;mola&quot; = millstone/false conception). The term, however, comes from the similar appearance of the cyst to a hydatid cyst in an echinococcosis.

<text>Choriocarcinoma is a malignant, trophoblastic cancer, usually of the placenta. It is characterized by early hematogenous spread to the lungs. It belongs to the malignant end of the spectrum in gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). It is also classified as a germ cell tumor and may arise in the testis or ovary.

==Signs and symptoms==
* increased quantitative chorionic gonadotropin (the &quot;pregnancy hormone&quot;) levels
* vaginal bleeding
* shortness of breath
* hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
* chest pain
* chest X-ray shows multiple infiltrates of various shapes in both lungs
* presents in males as a testicular cancer, sometimes with skin hyperpigmentation (from excess chorionic gonadotropin cross reacting with the alpha MSH receptor), gynecomastia, and weight loss (from excess chorionic gonadotropin cross reacting with the LH, FSH, and TSH receptor) in males
* can present with decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) due to hyperthyroidism

== Cause ==
Choriocarcinoma of the placenta during pregnancy is preceded by:
* hydatidiform mole (50% of cases)
* spontaneous abortion (20% of cases)
* ectopic pregnancy (2% of cases)
* normal term pregnancy (20–30% of cases)
* hyperemesis gravidarum

Rarely, choriocarcinoma occurs in primary locations other than the placenta; very rarely, it occurs in testicles. Although trophoblastic components are common components of mixed germ cell tumors, pure choriocarcinoma of the adult testis is rare. Pure choriocarcinoma of the testis represents the most aggressive pathologic variant of germ cell tumors in adults, characteristically with early hematogenous and lymphatic metastatic spread. Because of early spread and inherent resistance to anticancer drugs, patients have poor prognosis. Elements of choriocarcinoma in a mixed testicular tumor have no prognostic importance.

Choriocarcinomas can also occur in the ovaries and other organs.

==Pathology==
Characteristic feature is the identification of intimately related syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts without formation of definite placental type villi. Since choriocarcinomas include syncytiotrophoblasts (beta-HCG producing cells), they cause elevated blood levels of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin.

Syncytiotrophoblasts are large multi-nucleated cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. They often surround the cytotrophoblasts, reminiscent of their normal anatomical relationship in chorionic villi. Cytotrophoblasts are polyhedral, mononuclear cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and a clear or pale cytoplasm. Extensive hemorrhage is a common finding.

==Treatment==
Since gestational choriocarcinoma (which arises from a hydatidiform mole) contains paternal DNA (and thus paternal antigens), it is exquisitely sensitive to chemotherapy. The cure rate, even for metastatic gestational choriocarcinoma, is more than 90% when using chemotherapy for invasive mole and choriocarcinoma.

As of 2019, treatment with either single-agent methotrexate or actinomycin-D is recommended for low-risk disease, while intense combination regimens including EMACO (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide and vincristine (Oncovin) are recommended for intermediate or high-risk disease.

Hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) can also be offered to patients &gt;40 years of age or those for whom sterilisation is not an obstacle. It may be required for those with severe infection and uncontrolled bleeding.

Choriocarcinoma arising in the testicle is rare, malignant and highly resistant to chemotherapy. The same is true of choriocarcinoma arising in the ovary. Testicular choriocarcinoma has the worst prognosis of all germ-cell cancers.

<text>Mainpuri (; ) is a city in Mainpuri district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is the administrative headquarters of Mainpuri district and is situated to the north-east of Agra and is 270 km from New Delhi. Mainpuri is located in the Braj region, which holds special religious significance to Hindus as the homeland of Krishna.

As of 2011, Mainpuri had a population of 136,557 in 24,498 households.

==Geography==
Mainpuri is located on a branch of the historical Grand Trunk Road, about 110 km from the city of Agra. The Isan river is on the east side of town. Mainpuri is about 5 km downstream from the point where the Isan receives the Kak Nadi as a tributary. In this area, up until about 1 km downstream of Mainpuri, the Isan has a relatively shallow bed and often overflows during the monsoon season. Three bridges cross the Isan river in Mainpuri; the northernmost is by the Devi temple on the road to [[KURAWLI]. The soil in this area is a mix of loam and &quot;[[usar]]&quot;.

On the south of Mainpuri is the railway, along with the train station. [[Mainpuri railway station]] was deliberately built in the middle of an unproductive &quot;usar&quot; plain so it wouldn&#x27;t take away from the available farmland.

The main street in Mainpuri is a section of the Agra road running east–west through town. This is the main commercial centre and many of the public buildings are built here. The [[Bhanwat]] road branches off from the main road and heads south to the train station.

Mainpuri historically consisted of two separate settlements: [[Mainpuri Khas]], the old town, in the north and surrounding the raja&#x27;s &quot;garhi&quot; (fort-palace complex); and Mukhamganj, or Ganj, further south on the main road. The Katra road historically marked the southern boundary of Mainpuri Khas. Mainpuri Khas was historically surrounded by a wall, with six gates. The names of five are known: the Debi, Tal, Madar, Deoraya, and Ganesh Darwazas. The name of the sixth is not recorded. Nagaria, a suburb of Mainpuri, is near where the Tal Darwaza once stood.

===Climate===
==History==
According to tradition, a branch of the Chauhan Rajputs came to Mainpuri from [[Asauli]] under one Raja Partab Rudr sometime between 1363 and 1391 (1420-1448 &quot;[[samvat]]&quot;). They were accompanied by fighters from the [[Mathuriya Brahman]]s, who later became merchants instead.

A new site called Mukhamganj, which is now the main part of town, was founded in 1746 by Raja Jaswant Singh on the Grand Trunk Road. It was named after Mukham Singh, who is variously recorded as a son of Jaswant&#x27;s who born out of wedlock or as his own childless brother. The new town quickly grew as people moved here from the town of [[Karimganj, Mainpuri|Karimganj]], further north. Mukhamganj quickly eclipsed Karimganj, which dwindled from a large town to a smaller village.

In 1802, the British founded a [[Civil Lines|civil station]] just east of Mainpuri to serve as the headquarters of the new [[Etawah district]]. The civil station consisted of three settlements: Gola Bazar, Nagla Chamaran, and Nagla Pazawa. Due to its position as an administrative headquarters, the entire town of Mainpuri quickly grew. In 1804, it was attacked and pillaged by forces under [[Yashwant Rao Holkar]], the Maratha ruler of [[Indore State|Indore]].

Major construction was done in Mainpuri from 1848 to 1850, involving the Raikesganj marketplace and a school, and again in the 1870s, involving three marketplaces, a post office, more schools, and a drainage system for the city. The three marketplaces built in the 1870s included one for vegetable produce, one for ghee and cotton, and one, called Laneganj after its builder, for grain. Laneganj, which replaced Raikesganj as the city&#x27;s main grain market, stretched from the Raikesganj sarai in the south to the intersection of the Katra and Kuraoli roads in the north, on the border with Mainpuri Khas. A large masonry tank was also built next to the Laneganj market, with a stone [[chhatri]] at each corner. In the hotter part of the year, the tank was fed by a canal coming up to the town from the south, where it ultimately branched off from the Nagaria distributary.

At the turn of the 20th century, there was still a large open area between the town of Mainpuri and the train station to the south. There was a [[brickyard]] in this area. At the east end of town was a cotton ginning mill. There were about 20 makers of &quot;tarkashi&quot; work (wood inlaid with brass wire) in the city at the time. In terms of commerce, there was an active trade in cotton, grain, iron, and vegetables.

At this time, Mainpuri was divided into four wards (two in Mainpuri Khas and two in Mukhamganj). The wards in Mainpuri Khas were Misrana, comprising the [[mohalla]]s Katra, Misrana, and Chautiana; and Purohitana, comprising the mohallas Purohitana, Sotiana, Baghban, and Bharatwal. The wards in Mukhamganj were Chhapaiti, comprising the mohallas Agarwala, Lohai, and Chhapaiti; and Gariwan, comprising the mohallas Gariwan, Saraogian, and Dariba.

As of the 1901 census, the city of Mainpuri had a population of exactly 19,000 (not counting the civil station, which had a population of exactly 1,000). The population was 73% Hindu (13,955) and 23% Muslim (4,436); the remaining 3% (609) followed other religions. Sometime between 1901 and 1910, the city limits were expanded southward to include the train station.

==Demographics==
As of the [[2011 Census of India|2011 census]], Mainpuri had a population of 136,557, in 24,498 households. This population was 52.2% male (71,274) and 47.8% female (65,283). The 0-6 age group numbered 17,360 (9,276 male and 8,084 female), or 12.7% of the total population. 22,540 residents were members of Scheduled Castes, or 16.5% of the total. The town&#x27;s literacy rate was 83.4% (counting only people age 7 and up).

==Notable temples==
There are several ancient and well-known Hindu temples in the city. These include Sheetla Devi Temple which hosts a 20-day rural exhibition-cum-trade fair every year in March/April. Bhimsen Mandir is an ancient Shiva temple and Falahari Ashram situated on Jyoti-Devi Road has very a rare statue of the goddess [[Durga]] with 18 arms. Another ancient Shiv temple is Chandeshwar Mandir situated on Chandeshwar Road. Also located on Devi Road are the twin Shiv temples of Kale Mahadev and Shweat Mahadev. Hanuman Temple situated on old Tehsil Road is visited by thousands on Tuesdays and Saturdays.

==Industry==
[[Cotton gin]]ning, oilseed milling, lamp and [[glass]] manufacturing constitute the prominent industries. [[Peanut]] farming is a small but well-spread out industry. The town is also renowned for its [[tobacco]] and wooden sculptures. A large amount of the population depends on agriculture produce to fulfill daily needs. The agricultural equipment industry is predominant — Siyaram Agency is one of the leading equipment manufacturers in the district.

===&quot;Tarkashi&quot;===
Mainpuri is renowned for its woodwork inlaid with brass wire, a process known as &quot;tarkashi&quot; (literally &quot;wire-drawing&quot;). Dark [[shisham]] wood is the main type of wood used, and some of the items commonly decorated in this way are footwear, plates and trays, various small boxes, and photo frames. &quot;Tarkashi&quot; items are made by gently hammering brass strips into chiselled-out incisions in the wood. A [[stencil]] is used to mark out complex designs beforehand. &quot;Tarkashi&quot; work is typically a slow process – a plate with a 30 cm [[diameter]] can take up to 20 days – so the items tend to be relatively expensive.

==Places of interest==

Fort/Garhi of Mainpuri is situated at old Mainpuri. The fort is not a spot of tourist interest. It is the private property of erstwhile raja of two estates, Mainpuri and Lawan (Dausa, Rajasthan) and repaired, maintained and restored by him.

Attractions include the parks Phoolbagh and Lohia Park. Phoolbagh is situated at Jail Chauraha while Lohia Park is situated at District Collectorate. Both have green lawns and fountains.

Mainpuri is also known for the [[sarus crane]] (&quot;[[Grus antigone]]&quot;). This bird, called &quot;krouncha&quot; in India, is revered as a symbol of marital fidelity and is celebrated in myth and legend. There are estimated to be 8,000-10,000 sarus cranes in India. Two-thirds of its population resides in the villages Harwai,Andani of Karhal.

Another place of interest in the Mainpuri District is the [[Saman Bird Sanctuary]]. The [[Siberian crane]] comes here in its migration cycle and stays for 3–4 months from November to February. Part-time wildlife photographer Mr. Shashank Raghav has contributed his photos to depict the wildlife of the Mainpuri District, especially the different species of birds which can be found in nearby areas of the Saman Bird Sanctuary within the Mainpuri district.

==Healthcare==
The district hospital is called Maharaja Tej Singh Jila Chikitsalya. Mainpuri Janch Kendra is a Registered Pathology in the district in the fields of biotechnology and biochemistry. Mainpuri District has a very high number of cancer patients due to consumption of &quot;kapuri&quot; ([[camphor]]) flavoured tobacco.

==Education==
As of 2009, Mainpuri has 61 schools teaching at the primary level, 11 schools teaching at the secondary level, and 4 public libraries.

===Engineering College===
[[Government Engineering College, Mainpuri]](खर्रा)) (Rajkiya Engineering College, REC) is a government [[engineering college]] in Mainpuri. It is a constituent college of [[Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University]] (formerly [[Uttar Pradesh Technical University]]) in [[Lucknow]]. The college has four branches: computer science, civil, electrical, and mechanical with 63 students in each branch. REC is situated at Shikohabad - Mainpuri Road. There is one government polytechnic college. It has three branches of engineering, electronics, microprocessors and instrumentation and control. It is located at Sindhiya Tiraha near new Mandi.

==Accessibility==
Mainpuri is well-connected to other parts of the state by road and broad-gauge railway so one can visit Mainpuri by train. Currently, the only two trains are the Kalindi Express and the Kanpur Anand Vihar Express, which connect Mainpuri to [[Delhi]] and [[Kanpur]]. The city is also linked by railways to [[Farrukhabad]] and [[Shikohabad]], [[Etawah]] and [[Kanpur]]. Major cities within a range of Mainpuri include [[Agra]], [[Delhi]], [[Bareilly]], [[Meerut]], [[Firozabad]], [[Shikohabad]], [[Etawah]], [[Jhansi]], [[Gwalior]] and [[Kanpur]].

The Agra Lucknow Expressway connects Mainpuri to Lucknow.

The closest civil airport is at Agra, which is 110  km away.

<text>The Johannesburg Ring Road is a set of freeways that circle the city of Johannesburg, South Africa and service the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. The entire ring road is approximately 83 km long and was an e-toll highway (with open road tolling) from 3 December 2013 up until e-tolls were shut down in Gauteng on 12 April 2024.

==History==

Construction on the Ring Road began in the late 1960s. Sections of the Eastern Bypass first opened in 1971 while the last section of the Southern Bypass opened in 1986.

The Ring Road had two major aims when it was built: to allow traffic not destined for Johannesburg to bypass the city along a number of high-speed freeways in quick and easy fashion and also to allow for the mobility of Apartheid South African Army to defend the state from hostile neighbours or to quell violence in black townships during a state of emergency.
==The Route==

The Road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, and form an loop around Johannesburg. The 3 freeways that create the Ring Road include the N3 Eastern Bypass, the N1 Western Bypass and the N12 Southern Bypass.

The entire road was built with asphalt and is mostly 8 lanes wide throughout (4 lanes in either direction), with parts having up to 12 lanes wide in some areas (6 lanes in either direction), the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic.

The main intersections that complete the ring road include the Elands Interchange, that connects the N3 Eastern Bypass with the N12 Southern Bypass, the Diepkloof Interchange, that connects the N12 Southern Bypass with the N1 Western Bypass and finally the Buccleuch Interchange connecting the N1 Western Bypass with the N3 Eastern Bypass.

<doc id="1010256" wikidata="Q1532243" url="?curid=1010256" title="Libman–Sacks endocarditis">
<text>Libman–Sacks endocarditis is a form of non-bacterial endocarditis that is seen in association with systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and malignancies. It is one of the most common cardiac manifestations of lupus (the most common being pericarditis).

==Presentation==
Libman–Sacks endocarditis itself is typically asymptomatic. Affected persons most commonly present with embolisms secondary to dislodged vegetations. However, in some cases, severe valvular dysfunction may develop. People with systemic lupus erythematosus may present with other symptoms of the underlying diseases that give rise to Libman–Sacks endocarditis. 

=== Complications ===
Libman–Sacks endocarditis may result in arterial emboli, valvular insufficiency, and heart failure. Infective endocarditis occurs more frequently with those with systemic lupus erythematosus.

==== Emboli ====
Vegetations occurring in the context of Libman–Sacks endocarditis may dislodge to form emboli and cause embolism (including cerebral embolism (presenting as stroke or transient ischaemic attack), mesenteric ischaemia (presenting with severe abdominal pain), or peripheral arterial embolism (presenting with limb coldness)).

== Causes ==
Libman–Sacks endocarditis occurs in association with systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and malignancies.

=== Systemic lupus erythematosus ===
In systemic lupus erythematosus, Libman–Sacks endocarditis has been linked to pericarditis, presence of anticardiolipin antibodies, arterial and venous thromboses, and neuropsychiatric manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus. Libman–Sacks endocarditis is associated with greater systemic lupus erythematosus duration and severity. In some cases, Libman–Sacks endocarditis may be the presenting pathology in systemic lupus erythematosus, especially in the presence of concurrent antiphospholipid syndrome.

==Pathophysiology==
The initial cause of Libman–Sacks endocarditis is poorly understood. It is thought to occur in the context of a hypercoagulable state which leads to endothelial injury and subsequent deposition of thrombi and inflammatory molecules in affected valves. The vegetations that are thus formed consist of immune complexes, platelet thrombi, fibrin, and mononuclear cells. The vegetations may dislodge and cause embolisms.

=== Histopathology ===
Libman–Sacks endocarditis involves formation of cardiac lesions that may take the form of vegetations or thickening of the valvular leaflets.

The vegetations are small and formed from strands of fibrin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. Vegetations are most often small-to-moderate in size (up to 10 mm), but may sometimes be large (larger than 10 mm). The mitral valve is typically affected, and the vegetations occur on the ventricular and atrial surface of the valve. Though the left-sided heart valves (mitral and aortic) are most commonly affected, any heart valve as well as adjoining structures may become involved.

Libman–Sacks lesions rarely produce significant valve dysfunction and the lesions only rarely embolize. However, there is data to suggest an association between Libman–Sacks endocarditis and a higher risk for embolic cerebrovascular disease in people with systemic lupus erythematosus.

==Diagnosis==
Libman–Sacks endocarditis should be considered in instances of thromboembolism in persons with underlying pathology that is associated with LSE. Libman–Sacks endocarditis is diagnosed with echocardiography. Other potential etiologies (e.g. infective endocarditis) should be excluded through an extensive assessment (complete blood count and metabolic panel, blood cultures). Libman–Sacks endocarditis can also be identified post-mortem during an autopsy.

=== Echocardiography ===
Echocardiography is considered the primary evaluation for Libman–Sacks endocarditis; transesophageal echocardiography has greater sensitivity and specificity than transthoracic echocardiography. In case of a negative TTE in the presence of clinical signs of Libman–Sacks endocarditis, transesophageal echocardiography may be attempted to confirm the presence of the condition.

Vegetations of the cardiac valves and endocardium are characterised by irregular borders, heterogenous echo density, and an absence of independent motion. Vegetations are usually small, but may be as large as 10mm. The basal and middle portions of the mitral and aortic valves are most commonly involved. Leaflet thickening or regurgitation may be present. There may be other cardiac pathology related to the underlying cause, e.g., lupus.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Differential diagnoses include: rheumatic valvular disease, atrial myxoma, degenerative valvular disease, infective endocarditis, vasculitis, cholesterol emboli syndrome, fibroelastoma, and Lambl&#x27;s excrescences.

==Management/treatment==
The condition should be monitored to follow the development of the vegetations, and health personnel should be conscious of the potential risks associated with the condition.

There is a paucity of empirical evidence on treatment options for persons with Libman–Sacks endocarditis, and treatment should focus on the underlying cause. Anticoagulant treatment is recommended in cases with previous thromboembolic event for prevention of subsequent occurrences. Surgical intervention may be indicated in case of significant valvular dysfunction.

== Prognosis ==
Libman–Sacks endocarditis is often associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.

== Epidemiology ==
Libman–Sacks endocarditis has been observed in 0.2% in of the general population at autopsy. It occurs most commonly in those aged 40 to 80 years.

Libman–Sacks endocarditis vegetations are observed in 10% of systemic lupus erythematosus cases (however, in one study, vegetations were noted in 43% of systemic lupus erythematosus cases (0% in controls), and valvular thickening in 51% of systemic lupus erythematosus cases (7% in controls)). There is a significant correlation between systemic lupus erythematosus duration and severity, and the incidence of Libman–Sacks endocarditis. Libman–Sacks endocarditis has been identified in 1.25% of those with malignant disease at autopsy.

== History ==
It was first described by Emanuel Libman and Benjamin Sacks at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City in 1924. The association between Libman–Sacks endocarditis and antiphospholipid syndrome was first noted in 1985.

<text>The Durban Outer Ring Road is a half ring road that circles the coastal city of Durban, South Africa. It is part of the N2 highway which links the North and South Coasts of KwaZulu-Natal.

==Route==
From north to south, the Outer Ring Road begins from the M41 Mount Edgecombe Interchange between Mount Edgecombe and uMhlanga as 3×3 wide freeway. In late 2013 construction began to upgrade the M41 and N2 interchange to a full flowing interchange from its prior diamond interchange shape and was completed and opened on the 30 October 2018.

From the M41, the N2 then fans into a 4×4 wide freeway as it begins to circle the urban parts of Durban. The freeway passes M25 KwaMashu Highway, M45 Queen Nandi Road including a Petropoort (the only urban freeway petrol station in Durban) and continuing to the massive Umgeni Interchange. The interchange is a dual road interchange starting with M21 Inanda Road and linking to the M19 Umgeni Road.
In 2012, due to heavy congestions with the M19 Umgeni Road and the N2 SANRAL decided to upgrade the M19 interchange to a semi-free flowing interchange. The project was supposed to have reached completion in May 2014 but delays from local workers and striking has prolonged this, however it was completed and opened in October 2015. Two huge viaduct bridges have been erected for free-flowing traffic for commuters travelling on the M19 West to reach the N2 North, and for the N2 North to reach the M19 West without stopping at signals.

The N2 continues south to reach the EB Cloete Interchange with the N3 highway coming from Johannesburg. Nicknamed &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;, this is the only five-stack free-flowing interchange in South Africa.

Once passing the interchange with the N3, the N2 continues into the southern parts of Durban meeting the terminus of the freeway portion of the M7 at the Solomon Mahlangu Drive Interchange and continuing southwards passing the M1 Higginson Highway. The N2 then meets the R102 for the Umlazi off-ramp and would continue with an old Durban International Airport offramp, however in 2010 the airport was relocated to the north of Durban. The off-ramp still exists but there is no signage or destination route.

The Durban Outer Ring Road ends at the Reunion Interchange with the M4, which provides an alternative route to the bypass for commuters who wish to drive through the central parts of the city. The M4 begins in Ballito and passes in a southerly direction along the coast as a parallel alternative to the N2 cutting through the city centre and ending at the N2 at the defunct Durban International Airport. After the M4 the N2 heads towards Amanzimtoti, the highway changes back to 2×2 lanes and over-head urban signage ends as the freeway makes its way to the South Coast.

<text>The Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien ( &quot;Vienna Museum of Art History&quot;, often referred to as the &quot;Museum of Fine Arts, Vienna&quot;) is an art museum in Vienna, Austria. Housed in its festive palatial building on the Vienna Ring Road, it is crowned with an octagonal dome. The term &quot;Kunsthistorisches Museum&quot; applies to both the institution and the main building. It is the largest art museum in the country and one of the most important museums worldwide.

Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary opened the facility around 1891 at the same time as the Natural History Museum, Vienna which has a similar design and is directly across Maria-Theresien-Platz. The two buildings were constructed between 1871 and 1891 according to plans by Gottfried Semper and Baron Karl von Hasenauer. The emperor commissioned the two Ringstraße museums to create a suitable home for the Habsburgs&#x27; formidable art collection and to make it accessible to the general public. The buildings are rectangular, with symmetrical Renaissance Revival façades of sandstone lined with large arched windows on the main levels and topped with an octagonal dome high. The interiors of the museums are lavishly decorated with marble, stucco ornamentation, gold-leaf, and murals. The grand stairway features paintings by Gustav Klimt, Ernst Klimt, Franz Matsch, Hans Makart and Mihály Munkácsy.

== Nazi-looted art ==
In 2010, an Austrian government panel recommended that the Kunsthistorisches Museum should restitute two altar panels by the 16th-century Dutch artist, Maerten van Heemskerck to the heirs of Richard Neumann, a Jewish art collector in Vienna plundered by the Nazis.

In 2015, a dispute over a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, &quot;The Fight Between Carnival and Lent&quot; (1559), erupted between Poland and Austria. Poland presented evidence that the painting had been seized by Charlotte von Wächter, the wife of Krakow&#x27;s Nazi governor Otto von Wächter, during the German occupation of Poland. The Kunsthistorisches Museum, insisted that it had owned the painting since the 17th century, and that the artwork seized by von Wächter in 1939 &quot;was a different painting&quot;.

== Recent events ==

One of the museum&#x27;s most important objects, the &quot;Cellini Salt Cellar&quot; sculpture by Benvenuto Cellini, was stolen on 11 May 2003 and recovered on 21 January 2006, in a box buried in a forest near the town of Zwettl. It was featured in an episode of &quot;Museum Secrets&quot; on the History Channel. It had been the greatest art theft in Austrian history.

The museum is the subject of Johannes Holzhausen&#x27;s documentary film &quot;The Great Museum&quot; (2014), filmed over two years in the run up to the re-opening of the newly renovated and expanded Kunstkammer rooms in 2013.

From October 2018 through January 2019 the museum hosted the world&#x27;s largest-ever exhibition of works by Pieter Bruegel the Elder called &quot;Bruegel – Once in a Lifetime&quot;.

<text>The N21 is a proposed national route in the City of Cape Town, South Africa. It is also known as the Peninsula Expressway ring road. Once complete, it will link the northern suburbs on the Atlantic seaboard (Melkbosstrand &amp; Bloubergstrand) with the southern suburbs on False Bay (Muizenberg). The R300 freeway is entirely part of the proposed route (the freeway will be extended at both ends).

== Background ==

=== Proposed route ===
The proposed freeway will include sections of the existing R300 freeway and will be tolled. The name of the consortium involved in the construction of the Expressway is &quot;Penway&quot;, short for Peninsula Expressway. The Penway has also become the local nickname for the Expressway.

Explosive growth of the Cape Town metropolitan area, especially in terms of local and international tourism, the wine industry, and the film industry, has pushed the traffic situation to a critical point.

=== Environment ===
A number of environmental impact studies have been done, to determine whether new sections of the freeway will upset the delicate ecological systems in the Cape Town area. New sections will run south of the N2 towards Zeekoevlei, which is a wetland area, and north of the N1, up to the area near Melkbosstrand.

== Projects ==

=== Project R300 ===
During the 1990s and 2000s, the national road agency and Western Cape Department Of Road And Transportation began the final construction of the R300, the first section of the highway.

=== Project N21 ===
The Peninsula Expressway will have junctions with three National Roads, the N1, the N2, and the N7 as well as the M3 and the M5 which are Cape Town metropolitan freeways.

In August 2022 the Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works announced the launch of an environmental impact assessment for the extension of the R300 from its current terminus at the N1 northwards to the R302 (Wellington Road).

== Opposition ==
The project to extend the R300 has been opposed by some members of society due to them wanting to preserve the areas in which the proposed road is meant to pass (such as wetlands and sanctuaries).

<doc id="1010269" wikidata="Q7242168" url="?curid=1010269" title="Pretoria Ring Road">
<text>The Pretoria Ring Road, also known as the Pretoria Bypass, is a collection of two bypasses that together form a partial ring road around the city of Pretoria, South Africa. It consists of a section of the N1 highway (known as the Eastern Bypass) as well as a section of the N4 highway (known as the Northern Bypass). It is entirely in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality.

== Route ==

=== Eastern Bypass ===
The Pretoria Eastern Bypass is formed by the N1 highway, from the Brakfontein Interchange with the Ben Schoeman Freeway (N1; N14) in Centurion to the Doornpoort Interchange with the Platinum Highway (N4) in northern Pretoria, a length of approximately 30 km.

It heads north-east from Brakfontein (bypassing Centurion CBD) and then turns north after the Flying Saucer Interchange with the R21 highway, eventually reaching the Proefplaas Interchange east of Pretoria CBD, where it meets the N4 highway (Maputo Corridor) coming from eMalahleni and Mbombela in the east. Here, the N4 designation joins the N1 northwards to be co-signed for 12 km up to the Doornpoort Interchange, where the N4 becomes the Platinum Highway (Pretoria Northern Bypass) westwards towards Brits and Rustenburg while the N1 continues north on its present highway towards Mokopane and Polokwane.

The section of the Eastern Bypass from the Brakfontein Interchange to the Proefplaas Interchange, which is also known as the Danie Joubert Freeway, is a toll-free section while the remaining 12 km section to Doornpoort is a toll road with physical toll booths at the northbound ramp exits. At the Doornpoort Interchange is the Pumulani Toll Plaza on the N1 north and the Doornpoort Toll Plaza on the N4 west.

The section of the Eastern Bypass from the Brakfontein Interchange to the Proefplaas interchange was part of the Gauteng e-toll system and had open road tolling from 3 December 2013 onwards. On 12 April 2024, e-tolls were discontinued in Gauteng, effectively making this section of the road a toll-free section. SANRAL maintains the toll-free section while Bakwena maintains the N1/N4 section from the Proefplaas Interchange northwards.

At the Brakfontein Interchange, a highway links south-west to Krugersdorp (designated as the N14) while the Ben Schoeman Freeway links north to the Pretoria CBD (designated as the N14) and south to Midrand and Johannesburg (designated as the N1).

=== Northern Bypass ===
The Pretoria Northern Bypass is formed by the N4 highway, from the Doornpoort Interchange with the N1 highway (Eastern Bypass) to the Brits Toll Plaza, a length of approximately 36 km.

It heads west from the Doornpoort Toll Plaza, bypassing Wonderboom Airport and Onderstepoort, to reach an interchange with the R80 highway (Mabopane Highway; which connects with Mabopane and Soshanguve in the north) in Akasia. It continues westwards to reach the Brits Toll Plaza, where it leaves the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality, enters the North West Province and proceeds to Brits and Rustenburg.

The Northern Bypass is part of the Platinum Highway maintained by Bakwena.

== Significance ==

Before the opening of the Northern Bypass, the N4 national route, which is coming from Witbank and Mbombela in the east, passed westwards through Pretoria from the Proefplaas Interchange on regular city streets (today designated as the M2 and M4 roads) and exited Pretoria westbound as the Magalies Toll Route, a 20 km tolled highway to Hartbeespoort.

This new realignment of the N4 (the Northern Bypass) means that both Hartbeespoort and Pretoria Central are now bypassed to the north for east–west traffic. Traffic coming from Rustenburg in the west and heading towards towns east (and south) of Pretoria no-longer has to pass through the city centre and interfere with local traffic.

Before the opening of the Eastern Bypass, the N1 national route, which is coming from Johannesburg in the south, passed northwards through Pretoria on regular city streets (today designated as the R101) and exited Pretoria northbound on Lavender Road/Old Warmbaths Road.

This new realignment of the N1 (the Eastern Bypass) means that Pretoria Central is now bypassed to the east for north–south traffic. Traffic coming from Polokwane in the north and heading towards towns south (and south-west) of Pretoria no-longer has to pass through the city centre.

<text>Thomas Leslie &quot;Jack&quot; Axford, (18 June 1894 – 11 October 1983) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Thomas Axford was born on 18 June 1894 at Carrieton in South Australia. His father was an auctioneer, originally from Tasmania. When Axford was two years old, the family moved to Western Australia, settling in Coolgardie. Educated at Coolgardie Primary School, he worked at the Boulder City Brewery after completing his schooling. In 1912, he enlisted in the 84th Infantry (Goldfields Regiment) of the Citizen Military Forces.

==First World War==
In July 1915, at the age of 21, Axford joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for service in the First World War. He was assigned to the 11th Reinforcements of the 16th Battalion on 9 August 1915, which left Australia on HMAT &quot;Benalla&quot; that November. He arrived in the Middle East to join his unit in March 1916, missing the just completed Gallipoli Campaign.

In June 1916, Axford&#x27;s battalion went to France to fight on the Western Front. During the Battle of Mouquet Farm on 11 August 1916, Axford was evacuated with shellshock. He returned to the battalion after two days. During most of 1917, the battalion was engaged in fighting in Belgium, attacking the Hindenburg Line. During the Third Battle of Ypres, in fighting at Gapaard Farm, Axford was badly wounded in the knee by shrapnel. After medical treatment in England he rejoined the battalion in January 1918. The following month, he was promoted to lance corporal. During the German spring offensive, from March to April 1918, 16th Battalion was heavily engaged in fighting around Hébuterne. In May he was awarded the Military Medal (MM).

It was during the Battle of Hamel, on 4 July 1918, that the events that led to Axford being awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) took place. His platoon was attacking towards Vaire Wood when a neighbouring platoon came under heavy fire. Axford took prompt action to remedy the situation. The citation for his VC read:
In addition to being awarded the VC, Axford was promoted to corporal several days after the battle. Shortly before the end of the war, Axford returned to Australia on furlough. He was discharged from the AIF on 2 February 1919.

==Later life==
Axford returned to his old job at the Boulder Brewery, then went to learn a trade at Kalgoorlie Foundry, but was not eligible under the Australian Soldiers&#x27; Repatriation Act. He undertook various laboring jobs in the Eastern Goldfields. Later on he worked for a sewing machine company, and did casual work wherever he could get it until the early 1930s, when he worked initially as a commissionaire, then as a records clerk with the Western Australian Department of Mines in Perth.

He had married Lily Maud Foster, a shop assistant, at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Perth, on 27 November 1926. They lived in the Perth suburb of Mount Hawthorn and were to have five children.

In June 1941, during the Second World War, he left his position at the Department of Mines to serve in the army&#x27;s Western Australian Echelon and Records Office, in Perth, part of Headquarters Western Command. He was discharged with the rank of sergeant in April 1947, and returned to his position as a records clerk at the Department of Mines.

He died on 11 October 1983 while aboard a flight returning to Australia following a Victoria Cross and George Cross Association reunion. Survived by his five children, he was cremated at the Karrakatta Crematorium in Perth. His wife predeceased him earlier in 1983.

==Legacy==
Axford&#x27;s war medals, including his Victoria Cross, were donated to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where they are on display. Axford Park in Mount Hawthorn, and the Thomas Axford ward at the former Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood, are named in his honour. On Anzac Day 2018, Axford and fellow VC recipient John Carroll, were honoured with a paver on the Walk of Fame in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia.

<text>In computing, a file system or filesystem (often abbreviated to FS or fs) governs file organization and access. A &quot;local&quot; file system is a capability of an operating system that services the applications running on the same computer. A distributed file system is a protocol that provides file access between networked computers.

A file system provides a data storage service that allows applications to share mass storage. Without a file system, applications could access the storage in incompatible ways that lead to resource contention, data corruption and data loss.

There are many file system designs and implementations with various structure and features and various resulting characteristics such as speed, flexibility, security, size and more.

Files systems have been developed for many types of storage devices, including hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), magnetic tapes and optical discs.

A portion of the computer main memory can be set up as a RAM disk that serves as a storage device for a file system. File systems such as tmpfs can store files in virtual memory.
A &quot;virtual&quot; file system provides access to files that are either computed on request, called &quot;virtual files&quot; (see procfs and sysfs), or are mapping into another, backing storage.

== Etymology ==

From and before the advent of computers the terms &quot;file system&quot;, &quot;filing system&quot; and &quot;system for filing&quot; were used to describe methods of organizing, storing and retrieving paper documents. By 1961, the term &quot;file system&quot; was being applied to computerized filing alongside the original meaning. By 1964, it was in general use.

== Architecture ==

A local file system&#x27;s architecture can be described as layers of abstraction even though a particular file system design may not actually separate the concepts.

The &quot;logical file system&quot; layer provides relatively high-level access via an application programming interface (API) for file operations including open, close, read and write delegating operations to lower layers. This layer manages open file table entries and per-process file descriptors. It provides file access, directory operations, security and protection.

The &quot;virtual file system&quot;, an optional layer, supports multiple concurrent instances of physical file systems, each of which called a file system implementation.

The &quot;physical file system&quot; layer provides relatively low-level access to a storage device (e.g. disk). It reads and writes data blocks, provides buffering and other memory management and controls placement of blocks in specific locations on the storage medium. This layer uses device drivers or channel I/O to drive the storage device.

== Attributes ==

=== File names ===
A file name, or filename, identifies a file to consuming applications and in some cases users.

A file name is unique so that an application can refer to exactly one file for a particular name. If the file system supports directories, then generally file name uniqueness is enforced within the context of each directory. In other words, a storage can contain multiple files with the same name, but not in the same directory.

Most file systems restrict the length of a file name.

Some file systems match file names as case sensitive and others as case insensitive. For example, the names codice_1 and codice_2 match the same file for case insensitive, but different files for case sensitive.

Most modern file systems allow a file name to contain a wide range of characters from the Unicode character set. Some restrict characters such as those used to indicate special attributes such as a device, device type, directory prefix, file path separator, or file type.

=== Directories ===

File systems typically support organizing files into directories, also called folders, which segregate files into groups.

This may be implemented by associating the file name with an index in a table of contents or an inode in a Unix-like file system.

Directory structures may be flat (i.e. linear), or allow hierarchies by allowing a directory to contain directories, called subdirectories.

The first file system to support arbitrary hierarchies of directories was used in the Multics operating system. The native file systems of Unix-like systems also support arbitrary directory hierarchies, as do, Apple&#x27;s Hierarchical File System and its successor HFS+ in classic Mac OS, the FAT file system in MS-DOS 2.0 and later versions of MS-DOS and in Microsoft Windows, the NTFS file system in the Windows NT family of operating systems, and the ODS-2 (On-Disk Structure-2) and higher levels of the Files-11 file system in OpenVMS.

=== Metadata ===

In addition to data, the file content, a file system also manages associated metadata which may include but is not limited to:

* name
* size which may be stored as the number of blocks allocated or as a byte count
* when created, last accessed, last backed-up
* owner user and group
* access permissions
* file attributes such as whether the file is read-only, executable, etc.
* device type (e.g. block, character, socket, subdirectory, etc.)

A file system stores associated metadata separate from the content of the file.

Most file systems store the names of all the files in one directory in one place—the directory table for that directory—which is often stored like any other file.
Many file systems put only some of the metadata for a file in the directory table, and the rest of the metadata for that file in a completely separate structure, such as the inode.

Most file systems also store metadata not associated with any one particular file.
Such metadata includes information about unused regions—free space bitmap, block availability map—and information about bad sectors.
Often such information about an allocation group is stored inside the allocation group itself.

Additional attributes can be associated on file systems, such as NTFS, XFS, ext2, ext3, some versions of UFS, and HFS+, using extended file attributes. Some file systems provide for user defined attributes such as the author of the document, the character encoding of a document or the size of an image.

Some file systems allow for different data collections to be associated with one file name. These separate collections may be referred to as &quot;streams&quot; or &quot;forks&quot;. Apple has long used a forked file system on the Macintosh, and Microsoft supports streams in NTFS. Some file systems maintain multiple past revisions of a file under a single file name; the file name by itself retrieves the most recent version, while prior saved version can be accessed using a special naming convention such as &quot;filename;4&quot; or &quot;filename(-4)&quot; to access the version four saves ago.

See comparison of file systems § Metadata for details on which file systems support which kinds of metadata.

=== Storage space organization ===

A local file system tracks which areas of storage belong to which file and which are not being used.

When a file system creates a file, it allocates space for data. Some file systems permit or require specifying an initial space allocation and subsequent incremental allocations as the file grows.

To delete a file, the file system records that the file&#x27;s space is free; available to use for another file.

A local file system manages storage space to provide a level of reliability and efficiency. Generally, it allocates storage device space in a granular manner, usually multiple physical units (i.e. bytes). For example, in Apple DOS of the early 1980s, 256-byte sectors on 140 kilobyte floppy disk used a &quot;track/sector map&quot;.

The granular nature results in unused space, sometimes called slack space, for each file except for those that have the rare size that is a multiple of the granular allocation. For a 512-byte allocation, the average unused space is 256 bytes. For 64 KB clusters, the average unused space is 32 KB.

Generally, the allocation unit size is set when the storage is configured.
Choosing a relatively small size compared to the files stored, results in excessive access overhead.
Choosing a relatively large size results in excessive unused space.
Choosing an allocation size based on the average size of files expected to be in the storage tends to minimize unusable space.

=== Fragmentation ===

As a file system creates, modifies and deletes files, the underlying storage representation may become fragmented. Files and the unused space between files will occupy allocation blocks that are not contiguous.

A file becomes fragmented if space needed to store its content cannot be allocated in contiguous blocks. Free space becomes fragmented when files are deleted.

This is invisible to the end user and the system still works correctly. However this can degrade performance on some storage hardware that work better with contiguous blocks such as hard disk drives. Other hardware such as solid-state drives are not affected by fragmentation.

=== Access control ===


A file system often supports access control of data that it manages.

The intent of access control is often to prevent certain users from reading or modifying certain files.

Access control can also restrict access by program in order to ensure that data is modified in a controlled way. Examples include passwords stored in the metadata of the file or elsewhere and file permissions in the form of permission bits, access control lists, or capabilities. The need for file system utilities to be able to access the data at the media level to reorganize the structures and provide efficient backup usually means that these are only effective for polite users but are not effective against intruders.
Methods for encrypting file data are sometimes included in the file system. This is very effective since there is no need for file system utilities to know the encryption seed to effectively manage the data. The risks of relying on encryption include the fact that an attacker can copy the data and use brute force to decrypt the data. Additionally, losing the seed means losing the data.

=== Storage quota ===

Some operating systems allow a system administrator to enable disk quotas to limit a user&#x27;s use of storage space.

=== Data integrity ===

A file system typically ensures that stored data remains consistent in both normal operations as well as exceptional situations like:
* accessing program neglects to inform the file system that it has completed file access (to close a file)
* accessing program terminates abnormally (crashes)
* media failure
* loss of connection to remote systems
* operating system failure
* system reset (soft reboot)
* power failure (hard reboot)

Recovery from exceptional situations may include updating metadata, directory entries and handling data that was buffered but not written to storage media.

=== Recording ===

A file system might record events to allow analysis of issues such as:
* file or systemic problems and performance
* nefarious access

=== Data access ===

==== Byte stream access ====

Many file systems access data as a stream of bytes. Typically, to read file data, a program provides a memory buffer and the file system retrieves data from the medium and then writes the data to the buffer. A write involves the program providing a buffer of bytes that the file system reads and then stores to the medium.

==== Record access ====

Some file systems, or layers on top of a file system, allow a program to define a record so that a program can read and write data as a structure; not an unorganized sequence of bytes.

If a &quot;fixed length&quot; record definition is used, then locating the nth record can be calculated mathematically, which is relatively fast compared to parsing the data for record separators.

An identification for each record, also known as a key, allows a program to read, write and update records without regard to their location in storage. Such storage requires managing blocks of media, usually separating key blocks and data blocks. Efficient algorithms can be developed with pyramid structures for locating records.

=== Utilities ===

Typically, a file system can be managed by the user via various utility programs.

Some utilities allow the user to create, configure and remove an instance of a file system. It may allow extending or truncating the space allocated to the file system.
Directory utilities may be used to create, rename and delete &quot;directory entries&quot;, which are also known as &quot;dentries&quot; (singular: &quot;dentry&quot;), and to alter metadata associated with a directory. Directory utilities may also include capabilities to create additional links to a directory (hard links in Unix), to rename parent links (&quot;..&quot; in Unix-like operating systems), and to create bidirectional links to files.

File utilities create, list, copy, move and delete files, and alter metadata. They may be able to truncate data, truncate or extend space allocation, append to, move, and modify files in-place. Depending on the underlying structure of the file system, they may provide a mechanism to prepend to or truncate from the beginning of a file, insert entries into the middle of a file, or delete entries from a file. Utilities to free space for deleted files, if the file system provides an undelete function, also belong to this category.

Some file systems defer operations such as reorganization of free space, secure erasing of free space, and rebuilding of hierarchical structures by providing utilities to perform these functions at times of minimal activity. An example is the file system defragmentation utilities.

Some of the most important features of file system utilities are supervisory activities which may involve bypassing ownership or direct access to the underlying device. These include high-performance backup and recovery, data replication, and reorganization of various data structures and allocation tables within the file system.

=== File system API ===

Utilities, libraries and programs use file system APIs to make requests of the file system. These include data transfer, positioning, updating metadata, managing directories, managing access specifications, and removal.

=== Multiple file systems within a single system ===

Frequently, retail systems are configured with a single file system occupying the entire storage device.

Another approach is to partition the disk so that several file systems with different attributes can be used. One file system, for use as browser cache or email storage, might be configured with a small allocation size. This keeps the activity of creating and deleting files typical of browser activity in a narrow area of the disk where it will not interfere with other file allocations. Another partition might be created for the storage of audio or video files with a relatively large block size. Yet another may normally be set &quot;read-only&quot; and only periodically be set writable. Some file systems, such as ZFS and APFS, support multiple file systems sharing a common pool of free blocks, supporting several file systems with different attributes without having to reserved a fixed amount of space for each file system.

A third approach, which is mostly used in cloud systems, is to use &quot;disk images&quot; to house additional file systems, with the same attributes or not, within another (host) file system as a file. A common example is virtualization: one user can run an experimental Linux distribution (using the ext4 file system) in a virtual machine under his/her production Windows environment (using NTFS). The ext4 file system resides in a disk image, which is treated as a file (or multiple files, depending on the hypervisor and settings) in the NTFS host file system.

Having multiple file systems on a single system has the additional benefit that in the event of a corruption of a single file system, the remaining file systems will frequently still be intact. This includes virus destruction of the &quot;system&quot; file system or even a system that will not boot. File system utilities which require dedicated access can be effectively completed piecemeal. In addition, defragmentation may be more effective. Several system maintenance utilities, such as virus scans and backups, can also be processed in segments. For example, it is not necessary to backup the file system containing videos along with all the other files if none have been added since the last backup. As for the image files, one can easily &quot;spin off&quot; differential images which contain only &quot;new&quot; data written to the master (original) image. Differential images can be used for both safety concerns (as a &quot;disposable&quot; system - can be quickly restored if destroyed or contaminated by a virus, as the old image can be removed and a new image can be created in matter of seconds, even without automated procedures) and quick virtual machine deployment (since the differential images can be quickly spawned using a script in batches).

== Types ==

=== Disk file systems ===

A &quot;disk file system&quot; takes advantages of the ability of disk storage media to randomly address data in a short amount of time. Additional considerations include the speed of accessing data following that initially requested and the anticipation that the following data may also be requested. This permits multiple users (or processes) access to various data on the disk without regard to the sequential location of the data. Examples include FAT (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32), exFAT, NTFS, ReFS, HFS and HFS+, HPFS, APFS, UFS, ext2, ext3, ext4, XFS, btrfs, Files-11, Veritas File System, VMFS, ZFS, ReiserFS, NSS and ScoutFS. Some disk file systems are journaling file systems or versioning file systems.

==== Optical discs ====

ISO 9660 and Universal Disk Format (UDF) are two common formats that target Compact Discs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs. Mount Rainier is an extension to UDF supported since 2.6 series of the Linux kernel and since Windows Vista that facilitates rewriting to DVDs.

=== Flash file systems ===
A &quot;flash file system&quot; considers the special abilities, performance and restrictions of flash memory devices. Frequently a disk file system can use a flash memory device as the underlying storage media, but it is much better to use a file system specifically designed for a flash device.

=== Tape file systems ===

A &quot;tape file system&quot; is a file system and tape format designed to store files on tape. Magnetic tapes are sequential storage media with significantly longer random data access times than disks, posing challenges to the creation and efficient management of a general-purpose file system.

In a disk file system there is typically a master file directory, and a map of used and free data regions. Any file additions, changes, or removals require updating the directory and the used/free maps. Random access to data regions is measured in milliseconds so this system works well for disks.

Tape requires linear motion to wind and unwind potentially very long reels of media. This tape motion may take several seconds to several minutes to move the read/write head from one end of the tape to the other.

Consequently, a master file directory and usage map can be extremely slow and inefficient with tape. Writing typically involves reading the block usage map to find free blocks for writing, updating the usage map and directory to add the data, and then advancing the tape to write the data in the correct spot. Each additional file write requires updating the map and directory and writing the data, which may take several seconds to occur for each file.

Tape file systems instead typically allow for the file directory to be spread across the tape intermixed with the data, referred to as &quot;streaming&quot;, so that time-consuming and repeated tape motions are not required to write new data.

However, a side effect of this design is that reading the file directory of a tape usually requires scanning the entire tape to read all the scattered directory entries. Most data archiving software that works with tape storage will store a local copy of the tape catalog on a disk file system, so that adding files to a tape can be done quickly without having to rescan the tape media. The local tape catalog copy is usually discarded if not used for a specified period of time, at which point the tape must be re-scanned if it is to be used in the future.

IBM has developed a file system for tape called the Linear Tape File System. The IBM implementation of this file system has been released as the open-source IBM Linear Tape File System — Single Drive Edition (LTFS-SDE) product. The Linear Tape File System uses a separate partition on the tape to record the index meta-data, thereby avoiding the problems associated with scattering directory entries across the entire tape.

==== Tape formatting ====

Writing data to a tape, erasing, or formatting a tape is often a significantly time-consuming process and can take several hours on large tapes. With many data tape technologies it is not necessary to format the tape before over-writing new data to the tape. This is due to the inherently destructive nature of overwriting data on sequential media.

Because of the time it can take to format a tape, typically tapes are pre-formatted so that the tape user does not need to spend time preparing each new tape for use. All that is usually necessary is to write an identifying media label to the tape before use, and even this can be automatically written by software when a new tape is used for the first time.

===Database file systems===
Another concept for file management is the idea of a database-based file system. Instead of, or in addition to, hierarchical structured management, files are identified by their characteristics, like type of file, topic, author, or similar rich metadata.

IBM DB2 for i (formerly known as DB2/400 and DB2 for i5/OS) is a database file system as part of the object based IBM i operating system (formerly known as OS/400 and i5/OS), incorporating a single level store and running on IBM Power Systems (formerly known as AS/400 and iSeries), designed by Frank G. Soltis IBM&#x27;s former chief scientist for IBM i. Around 1978 to 1988 Frank G. Soltis and his team at IBM Rochester had successfully designed and applied technologies like the database file system where others like Microsoft later failed to accomplish. These technologies are informally known as &#x27;Fortress Rochester&#x27; and were in few basic aspects extended from early Mainframe technologies but in many ways more advanced from a technological perspective.

Some other projects that are not &quot;pure&quot; database file systems but that use some aspects of a database file system:
* Many Web content management systems use a relational DBMS to store and retrieve files. For example, XHTML files are stored as XML or text fields, while image files are stored as blob fields; SQL SELECT (with optional XPath) statements retrieve the files, and allow the use of a sophisticated logic and more rich information associations than &quot;usual file systems.&quot; Many CMSs also have the option of storing only metadata within the database, with the standard filesystem used to store the content of files.
* Very large file systems, embodied by applications like Apache Hadoop and Google File System, use some &quot;database file system&quot; concepts.

===Transactional file systems===
Some programs need to either make multiple file system changes, or, if one or more of the changes fail for any reason, make none of the changes. For example, a program which is installing or updating software may write executables, libraries, and/or configuration files. If some of the writing fails and the software is left partially installed or updated, the software may be broken or unusable. An incomplete update of a key system utility, such as the command shell, may leave the entire system in an unusable state.

Transaction processing introduces the atomicity guarantee, ensuring that operations inside of a transaction are either all committed or the transaction can be aborted and the system discards all of its partial results. This means that if there is a crash or power failure, after recovery, the stored state will be consistent. Either the software will be completely installed or the failed installation will be completely rolled back, but an unusable partial install will not be left on the system. Transactions also provide the isolation guarantee, meaning that operations within a transaction are hidden from other threads on the system until the transaction commits, and that interfering operations on the system will be properly serialized with the transaction.

Windows, beginning with Vista, added transaction support to NTFS, in a feature called Transactional NTFS, but its use is now discouraged. There are a number of research prototypes of transactional file systems for UNIX systems, including the Valor file system, Amino, LFS, and a transactional ext3 file system on the TxOS kernel, as well as transactional file systems targeting embedded systems, such as TFFS.

Ensuring consistency across multiple file system operations is difficult, if not impossible, without file system transactions. File locking can be used as a concurrency control mechanism for individual files, but it typically does not protect the directory structure or file metadata. For instance, file locking cannot prevent TOCTTOU race conditions on symbolic links.
File locking also cannot automatically roll back a failed operation, such as a software upgrade; this requires atomicity.

Journaling file systems is one technique used to introduce transaction-level consistency to file system structures. Journal transactions are not exposed to programs as part of the OS API; they are only used internally to ensure consistency at the granularity of a single system call.

Data backup systems typically do not provide support for direct backup of data stored in a transactional manner, which makes the recovery of reliable and consistent data sets difficult. Most backup software simply notes what files have changed since a certain time, regardless of the transactional state shared across multiple files in the overall dataset. As a workaround, some database systems simply produce an archived state file containing all data up to that point, and the backup software only backs that up and does not interact directly with the active transactional databases at all. Recovery requires separate recreation of the database from the state file after the file has been restored by the backup software.

===Network file systems===
A &quot;network file system&quot; is a file system that acts as a client for a remote file access protocol, providing access to files on a server. Programs using local interfaces can transparently create, manage and access hierarchical directories and files in remote network-connected computers. Examples of network file systems include clients for the NFS, AFS, SMB protocols, and file-system-like clients for FTP and WebDAV.

===Shared disk file systems===
A &quot;shared disk file system&quot; is one in which a number of machines (usually servers) all have access to the same external disk subsystem (usually a storage area network). The file system arbitrates access to that subsystem, preventing write collisions. Examples include GFS2 from Red Hat, GPFS, now known as Spectrum Scale, from IBM, SFS from DataPlow, CXFS from SGI, StorNext from Quantum Corporation and ScoutFS from Versity.

=== Special file systems ===
Some file systems expose elements of the operating system as files so they can be acted on via the file system API. This is common in Unix-like operating systems, and to a lesser extent in other operating systems. Examples include:
* devfs, udev, TOPS-10 expose I/O devices or pseudo-devices as special files
* configfs and sysfs expose special files that can be used to query and configure Linux kernel information
* procfs exposes process information as special files

===Minimal file system / audio-cassette storage===
In the 1970s disk and digital tape devices were too expensive for some early microcomputer users. An inexpensive basic data storage system was devised that used common audio cassette tape.

When the system needed to write data, the user was notified to press &quot;RECORD&quot; on the cassette recorder, then press &quot;RETURN&quot; on the keyboard to notify the system that the cassette recorder was recording. The system wrote a sound to provide time synchronization, then modulated sounds that encoded a prefix, the data, a checksum and a suffix. When the system needed to read data, the user was instructed to press &quot;PLAY&quot; on the cassette recorder. The system would &quot;listen&quot; to the sounds on the tape waiting until a burst of sound could be recognized as the synchronization. The system would then interpret subsequent sounds as data. When the data read was complete, the system would notify the user to press &quot;STOP&quot; on the cassette recorder. It was primitive, but it (mostly) worked. Data was stored sequentially, usually in an unnamed format, although some systems (such as the Commodore PET series of computers) did allow the files to be named. Multiple sets of data could be written and located by fast-forwarding the tape and observing at the tape counter to find the approximate start of the next data region on the tape. The user might have to listen to the sounds to find the right spot to begin playing the next data region. Some implementations even included audible sounds interspersed with the data.

===Flat file systems===
In a flat file system, there are no subdirectories; directory entries for all files are stored in a single directory.

When floppy disk media was first available this type of file system was adequate due to the relatively small amount of data space available. CP/M machines featured a flat file system, where files could be assigned to one of 16 &quot;user areas&quot; and generic file operations narrowed to work on one instead of defaulting to work on all of them. These user areas were no more than special attributes associated with the files; that is, it was not necessary to define specific quota for each of these areas and files could be added to groups for as long as there was still free storage space on the disk. The early Apple Macintosh also featured a flat file system, the Macintosh File System. It was unusual in that the file management program (Macintosh Finder) created the illusion of a partially hierarchical filing system on top of EMFS. This structure required every file to have a unique name, even if it appeared to be in a separate folder. IBM DOS/360 and OS/360 store entries for all files on a disk pack (&quot;volume&quot;) in a directory on the pack called a &quot;Volume Table of Contents&quot; (VTOC).

While simple, flat file systems become awkward as the number of files grows and makes it difficult to organize data into related groups of files.

A recent addition to the flat file system family is Amazon&#x27;s S3, a remote storage service, which is intentionally simplistic to allow users the ability to customize how their data is stored. The only constructs are buckets (imagine a disk drive of unlimited size) and objects (similar, but not identical to the standard concept of a file). Advanced file management is allowed by being able to use nearly any character (including &#x27;/&#x27;) in the object&#x27;s name, and the ability to select subsets of the bucket&#x27;s content based on identical prefixes.

== Implementations ==

An operating system (OS) typically supports one or more file systems. Sometimes an OS and its file system are so tightly interwoven that it is difficult to describe them independently.

An OS typically provides file system access to the user. Often an OS provides command line interface, such as Unix shell, Windows Command Prompt and PowerShell, and OpenVMS DCL. An OS often also provides graphical user interface file browsers such as MacOS Finder and Windows File Explorer.

===Unix and Unix-like operating systems===
Unix-like operating systems create a virtual file system, which makes all the files on all the devices appear to exist in a single hierarchy. This means, in those systems, there is one root directory, and every file existing on the system is located under it somewhere. Unix-like systems can use a RAM disk or network shared resource as its root directory.

Unix-like systems assign a device name to each device, but this is not how the files on that device are accessed. Instead, to gain access to files on another device, the operating system must first be informed where in the directory tree those files should appear. This process is called mounting a file system. For example, to access the files on a CD-ROM, one must tell the operating system &quot;Take the file system from this CD-ROM and make it appear under such-and-such directory.&quot; The directory given to the operating system is called the &quot;mount point&quot; – it might, for example, be . The directory exists on many Unix systems (as specified in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) and is intended specifically for use as a mount point for removable media such as CDs, DVDs, USB drives or floppy disks. It may be empty, or it may contain subdirectories for mounting individual devices. Generally, only the administrator (i.e. root user) may authorize the mounting of file systems.

Unix-like operating systems often include software and tools that assist in the mounting process and provide it new functionality. Some of these strategies have been coined &quot;auto-mounting&quot; as a reflection of their purpose.
* In many situations, file systems other than the root need to be available as soon as the operating system has booted. All Unix-like systems therefore provide a facility for mounting file systems at boot time. System administrators define these file systems in the configuration file fstab (&quot;vfstab&quot; in Solaris), which also indicates options and mount points.
* In some situations, there is no need to mount certain file systems at boot time, although their use may be desired thereafter. There are some utilities for Unix-like systems that allow the mounting of predefined file systems upon demand.
* Removable media allow programs and data to be transferred between machines without a physical connection. Common examples include USB flash drives, CD-ROMs, and DVDs. Utilities have therefore been developed to detect the presence and availability of a medium and then mount that medium without any user intervention.
* Progressive Unix-like systems have also introduced a concept called supermounting; see, for example, the Linux supermount-ng project. For example, a floppy disk that has been supermounted can be physically removed from the system. Under normal circumstances, the disk should have been synchronized and then unmounted before its removal. Provided synchronization has occurred, a different disk can be inserted into the drive. The system automatically notices that the disk has changed and updates the mount point contents to reflect the new medium.
* An automounter will automatically mount a file system when a reference is made to the directory atop which it should be mounted. This is usually used for file systems on network servers, rather than relying on events such as the insertion of media, as would be appropriate for removable media.

====Linux====
Linux supports numerous file systems, but common choices for the system disk on a block device include the ext* family (ext2, ext3 and ext4), XFS, JFS, and btrfs. For raw flash without a flash translation layer (FTL) or Memory Technology Device (MTD), there are UBIFS, JFFS2 and YAFFS, among others. SquashFS is a common compressed read-only file system.

====Solaris====
Solaris in earlier releases defaulted to (non-journaled or non-logging) UFS for bootable and supplementary file systems. Solaris defaulted to, supported, and extended UFS.

Support for other file systems and significant enhancements were added over time, including Veritas Software Corp. (journaling) VxFS, Sun Microsystems (clustering) QFS, Sun Microsystems (journaling) UFS, and Sun Microsystems (open source, poolable, 128 bit compressible, and error-correcting) ZFS.

Kernel extensions were added to Solaris to allow for bootable Veritas VxFS operation. Logging or journaling was added to UFS in Sun&#x27;s Solaris 7. Releases of Solaris 10, Solaris Express, OpenSolaris, and other open source variants of the Solaris operating system later supported bootable ZFS.

Logical Volume Management allows for spanning a file system across multiple devices for the purpose of adding redundancy, capacity, and/or throughput. Legacy environments in Solaris may use Solaris Volume Manager (formerly known as Solstice DiskSuite). Multiple operating systems (including Solaris) may use Veritas Volume Manager. Modern Solaris based operating systems eclipse the need for volume management through leveraging virtual storage pools in ZFS.

====macOS====
macOS (formerly Mac OS X) uses the Apple File System (APFS), which in 2017 replaced a file system inherited from classic Mac OS called HFS Plus (HFS+). Apple also uses the term &quot;Mac OS Extended&quot; for HFS+. HFS Plus is a metadata-rich and case-preserving but (usually) case-insensitive file system. Due to the Unix roots of macOS, Unix permissions were added to HFS Plus. Later versions of HFS Plus added journaling to prevent corruption of the file system structure and introduced a number of optimizations to the allocation algorithms in an attempt to defragment files automatically without requiring an external defragmenter.

File names can be up to 255 characters. HFS Plus uses Unicode to store file names. On macOS, the filetype can come from the type code, stored in file&#x27;s metadata, or the filename extension.

HFS Plus has three kinds of links: Unix-style hard links, Unix-style symbolic links, and aliases. Aliases are designed to maintain a link to their original file even if they are moved or renamed; they are not interpreted by the file system itself, but by the File Manager code in userland.

macOS 10.13 High Sierra, which was announced on June 5, 2017, at Apple&#x27;s WWDC event, uses the Apple File System on solid-state drives.

macOS also supported the UFS file system, derived from the BSD Unix Fast File System via NeXTSTEP. However, as of Mac OS X Leopard, macOS could no longer be installed on a UFS volume, nor can a pre-Leopard system installed on a UFS volume be upgraded to Leopard. As of Mac OS X Lion UFS support was completely dropped.

Newer versions of macOS are capable of reading and writing to the legacy FAT file systems (16 and 32) common on Windows. They are also capable of &quot;reading&quot; the newer NTFS file systems for Windows. In order to &quot;write&quot; to NTFS file systems on macOS versions prior to Mac OS X Snow Leopard third-party software is necessary. Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and later allow writing to NTFS file systems, but only after a non-trivial system setting change (third-party software exists that automates this).

Finally, macOS supports reading and writing of the exFAT file system since Mac OS X Snow Leopard, starting from version 10.6.5.

===OS/2===
OS/2 1.2 introduced the High Performance File System (HPFS). HPFS supports mixed case file names in different code pages, long file names (255 characters), more efficient use of disk space, an architecture that keeps related items close to each other on the disk volume, less fragmentation of data, extent-based space allocation, a B+ tree structure for directories, and the root directory located at the midpoint of the disk, for faster average access. A journaled filesystem (JFS) was shipped in 1999.

===PC-BSD===
PC-BSD is a desktop version of FreeBSD, which inherits FreeBSD&#x27;s ZFS support, similarly to FreeNAS. The new graphical installer of PC-BSD can handle &quot;/ (root) on ZFS&quot; and RAID-Z pool installs and disk encryption using Geli right from the start in an easy convenient (GUI) way. The current PC-BSD 9.0+ &#x27;Isotope Edition&#x27; has ZFS filesystem version 5 and ZFS storage pool version 28.

===Plan 9===
Plan 9 from Bell Labs treats everything as a file and accesses all objects as a file would be accessed (i.e., there is no ioctl or mmap): networking, graphics, debugging, authentication, capabilities, encryption, and other services are accessed via I/O operations on file descriptors. The 9P protocol removes the difference between local and remote files. File systems in Plan 9 are organized with the help of private, per-process namespaces, allowing each process to have a different view of the many file systems that provide resources in a distributed system.

The Inferno operating system shares these concepts with Plan 9.

===Microsoft Windows===

Windows makes use of the FAT, NTFS, exFAT, Live File System and ReFS file systems (the last of these is only supported and usable in Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10; Windows cannot boot from it).

Windows uses a &quot;drive letter&quot; abstraction at the user level to distinguish one disk or partition from another. For example, the path represents a directory on the partition represented by the letter C. Drive C: is most commonly used for the primary hard disk drive partition, on which Windows is usually installed and from which it boots. This &quot;tradition&quot; has become so firmly ingrained that bugs exist in many applications which make assumptions that the drive that the operating system is installed on is C. The use of drive letters, and the tradition of using &quot;C&quot; as the drive letter for the primary hard disk drive partition, can be traced to MS-DOS, where the letters A and B were reserved for up to two floppy disk drives. This in turn derived from CP/M in the 1970s, and ultimately from IBM&#x27;s CP/CMS of 1967.

====FAT====
The family of FAT file systems is supported by almost all operating systems for personal computers, including all versions of Windows and MS-DOS/PC DOS, OS/2, and DR-DOS. (PC DOS is an OEM version of MS-DOS, MS-DOS was originally based on SCP&#x27;s 86-DOS. DR-DOS was based on Digital Research&#x27;s Concurrent DOS, a successor of CP/M-86.) The FAT file systems are therefore well-suited as a universal exchange format between computers and devices of most any type and age.

The FAT file system traces its roots back to an (incompatible) 8-bit FAT precursor in Standalone Disk BASIC and the short-lived MDOS/MIDAS project.

Over the years, the file system has been expanded from FAT12 to FAT16 and FAT32. Various features have been added to the file system including subdirectories, codepage support, extended attributes, and long filenames. Third parties such as Digital Research have incorporated optional support for deletion tracking, and volume/directory/file-based multi-user security schemes to support file and directory passwords and permissions such as read/write/execute/delete access rights. Most of these extensions are not supported by Windows.

The FAT12 and FAT16 file systems had a limit on the number of entries in the root directory of the file system and had restrictions on the maximum size of FAT-formatted disks or partitions.

FAT32 addresses the limitations in FAT12 and FAT16, except for the file size limit of close to 4 GB, but it remains limited compared to NTFS.

FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 also have a limit of eight characters for the file name, and three characters for the extension (such as .exe). This is commonly referred to as the 8.3 filename limit. VFAT, an optional extension to FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32, introduced in Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.5, allowed long file names (LFN) to be stored in the FAT file system in a backwards compatible fashion.

====NTFS====
NTFS, introduced with the Windows NT operating system in 1993, allowed ACL-based permission control. Other features also supported by NTFS include hard links, multiple file streams, attribute indexing, quota tracking, sparse files, encryption, compression, and reparse points (directories working as mount-points for other file systems, symlinks, junctions, remote storage links).

====exFAT====
exFAT has certain advantages over NTFS with regard to file system overhead.

exFAT is not backward compatible with FAT file systems such as FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32. The file system is supported with newer Windows systems, such as Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows 11.

exFAT is supported in macOS starting with version 10.6.5 (Snow Leopard). Support in other operating systems is sparse since implementing support for exFAT requires a license. exFAT is the only file system that is fully supported on both macOS and Windows that can hold files larger than 4 GB.

===OpenVMS===
===MVS===

Prior to the introduction of VSAM, OS/360 systems implemented a hybrid file system. The system was designed to easily support removable disk packs, so the information relating to all files on one disk (&quot;volume&quot; in IBM terminology) is stored on that disk in a flat system file called the &quot;Volume Table of Contents&quot; (VTOC). The VTOC stores all metadata for the file. Later a hierarchical directory structure was imposed with the introduction of the &quot;System Catalog&quot;, which can optionally catalog files (datasets) on resident and removable volumes. The catalog only contains information to relate a dataset to a specific volume. If the user requests access to a dataset on an offline volume, and they have suitable privileges, the system will attempt to mount the required volume. Cataloged and non-cataloged datasets can still be accessed using information in the VTOC, bypassing the catalog, if the required volume id is provided to the OPEN request. Still later the VTOC was indexed to speed up access.

===Conversational Monitor System===

The IBM Conversational Monitor System (CMS) component of VM/370 uses a separate flat file system for each virtual disk (&quot;minidisk&quot;). File data and control information are scattered and intermixed. The anchor is a record called the &quot;Master File Directory&quot; (MFD), always located in the fourth block on the disk. Originally CMS used fixed-length 800-byte blocks, but later versions used larger size blocks up to 4K. Access to a data record requires two levels of indirection, where the file&#x27;s directory entry (called a &quot;File Status Table&quot; (FST) entry) points to blocks containing a list of addresses of the individual records.

===AS/400 file system===
Data on the AS/400 and its successors consists of system objects mapped into the system virtual address space in a single-level store. Many types of objects are defined including the directories and files found in other file systems. File objects, along with other types of objects, form the basis of the AS/400&#x27;s support for an integrated relational database.

===Other file systems===
* The Prospero File System is a file system based on the Virtual System Model. The system was created by B. Clifford Neuman of the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California.
* RSRE FLEX file system - written in ALGOL 68
* The file system of the Michigan Terminal System (MTS) is interesting because: (i) it provides &quot;line files&quot; where record lengths and line numbers are associated as metadata with each record in the file, lines can be added, replaced, updated with the same or different length records, and deleted anywhere in the file without the need to read and rewrite the entire file; (ii) using program keys files may be shared or permitted to commands and programs in addition to users and groups; and (iii) there is a comprehensive file locking mechanism that protects both the file&#x27;s data and its metadata.
* TempleOS uses RedSea, a file system made by Terry A. Davis.

== Limitations ==

=== Design limitations ===

File systems limit storable data capacity generally driven by the typical size of storage devices at the time the file system is designed and anticipated into the foreseeable future.

Since storage sizes have increased at near exponential rate (see Moore&#x27;s law), newer storage devices often exceed existing file system limits within only a few years after introduction. This requires new file systems with ever increasing capacity.

With higher capacity, the need for capabilities and therefore complexity increases as well. File system complexity typically varies proportionally with available storage capacity. Capacity issues aside, the file systems of early 1980s home computers with 50 KB to 512 KB of storage would not be a reasonable choice for modern storage systems with hundreds of gigabytes of capacity. Likewise, modern file systems would not be a reasonable choice for these early systems, since the complexity of modern file system structures would quickly consume the limited capacity of early storage systems.

===Converting the type of a file system===
It may be advantageous or necessary to have files in a different file system than they currently exist. Reasons include the need for an increase in the space requirements beyond the limits of the current file system. The depth of path may need to be increased beyond the restrictions of the file system. There may be performance or reliability considerations. Providing access to another operating system which does not support the existing file system is another reason.

====In-place conversion====
In some cases conversion can be done in-place, although migrating the file system is more conservative, as it involves a creating a copy of the data and is recommended. On Windows, FAT and FAT32 file systems can be converted to NTFS via the convert.exe utility, but not the reverse. On Linux, ext2 can be converted to ext3 (and converted back), and ext3 can be converted to ext4 (but not back), and both ext3 and ext4 can be converted to btrfs, and converted back until the undo information is deleted. These conversions are possible due to using the same format for the file data itself, and relocating the metadata into empty space, in some cases using sparse file support.

====Migrating to a different file system====
Migration has the disadvantage of requiring additional space although it may be faster. The best case is if there is unused space on media which will contain the final file system.

For example, to migrate a FAT32 file system to an ext2 file system, a new ext2 file system is created. Then the data from the FAT32 file system is copied to the ext2 one, and the old file system is deleted.

An alternative, when there is not sufficient space to retain the original file system until the new one is created, is to use a work area (such as a removable media). This takes longer but has the benefit of producing a backup.

===Long file paths and long file names===
In hierarchical file systems, files are accessed by means of a &quot;path&quot; that is a branching list of directories containing the file. Different file systems have different limits on the depth of the path. File systems also have a limit on the length of an individual file name.

Copying files with long names or located in paths of significant depth from one file system to another may cause undesirable results. This depends on how the utility doing the copying handles the discrepancy.

<doc id="1010283" wikidata="Q6154549" url="?curid=1010283" title="Janine Haines">
<text>Janine Winton Haines, AM (née Carter; 8 May 1945 – 20 November 2004) was an Australian politician who was a Senator for South Australia from 1977 to 1978 and again from 1981 to 1990. She represented the Australian Democrats, and served as the party&#x27;s leader from 1986 to 1990, becoming the first female federal parliamentary leader of an Australian political party. She was pivotal in &quot;shaping the Australian Democrats into a powerful political entity that held the balance of power in the Senate&quot;.

==Life==
Haines was born in Tanunda, South Australia, to a schoolteacher mother and policeman father, and travelled around South Australia with her parents and younger brother, due to her father&#x27;s job. They eventually settled in Adelaide and she attended Brighton High School. She married Ian Haines, whom she met at University of Adelaide where they were both studying mathematics, in 1967. They had two daughters, Melanie and Bronwyn. She taught English part-time and commenced an MA thesis on the poet Shaw Neilson but this was interrupted when she suffered a severe whiplash injury in a car accident.

She died in 2004, at age 59, from a degenerative neurological condition, and was honoured with a state funeral in Adelaide.

==Political career==
Haines became the assistant of Robin Millhouse, an important player in the South Australian conservative party the Liberal and Country League. Millhouse founded the Liberal Movement and the short-lived New LM which merged into the Australian Democrats in 1977. She was appointed to fill a casual vacancy in the Senate by the Parliament of South Australia, on the nomination of Labor premier Don Dunstan, on 14 December 1977. As a result of the 1977 Referendum the appointment was required to be from the same party as the resigning Senator, &quot;unless there is no member of that party available to be chosen or appointed&quot;. The casual vacancy arose following the resignation of Steele Hall who had been elected as a representative of the former Liberal Movement. Controversially, Dunstan chose to nominate Haines, who had been third on the Liberal Movement ticket from which Hall had been elected in 1975. Haines was not a member of the Liberal Movement at the time of her appointment, with the party dissolving in 1976. A majority of Liberal Movement members, including Hall and second on the ticket, Michael Wilson, joined the Liberal Party, while Haines joined the Democrats.

Haines did not contest the 1977 Australian federal election, and her Senate term expired on 30 June 1978. She was elected for a six-year term at the 1980 Australian federal election. On 14 August 1986, she was chosen by Democrats members as Senate leader on the retirement of inaugural leader Don Chipp.

She remained Senate leader until resigning to contest the House of Representatives seat of Kingston in the March 1990 election, believing the Democrats needed a &quot;high profile lower house presence&quot;. She was unsuccessful in the face of a negative campaign waged against her by both major parties. She was succeeded as interim Senate leader for several months by deputy Dr Michael Macklin (Qld), pending the customary election of a new leader by party members, at which Janet Powell was successful.

==Later career==
After leaving parliament Haines worked in a number of public positions including being president of the Australia Privacy Charter Council and deputy chancellor of the University of Adelaide.

She was invested with membership of the Order of Australia (AM) on 11 June 2001.

She wrote a book &quot;Suffrage to Sufferance: One Hundred Years of Women in Politics&quot; (Allen and Unwin, North Sydney, 1992, ) which has been a prescribed text in universities and schools.

<doc id="1010286" wikidata="Q5634691" url="?curid=1010286" title="HMS Triumph (1870)">
<text>HMS &quot;Triumph&quot; was a broadside ironclad battleship of the Victorian era, the sister-ship of . These two ships comprise the &quot;Swiftsure&quot; class of 1870.

The two sister-ships, which were built side by side by Palmers, were designed and built specifically to serve as flagships on distant stations, primarily with the Pacific squadron. They were powered by a Maudslay horizontal twin-cylinder return connecting-rod engine, and were the last British battleships to be fitted with a hoisting screw.

==Construction==
The ship was built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, Jarrow, Northumberland. She was launched on 27 September 1870. On 28 November, during fitting out, she was severely damaged by fire. As a result, she was not completed until 8 April 1873.

==Service history==
&quot;Triumph&quot; was initially commissioned in 1873 for the Channel Fleet, being transferred after a short time to the Mediterranean. On 1 March 1877, she collided with the steamship but was not damaged. She paid off in 1877 to be prepared for transfer to the Pacific as flagship, replacing after her indecisive action against the Peruvian rebel ship &quot;Huascar&quot;.

On 21 November 1881, while &quot;Triumph&quot; was off Chile, an explosion occurred caused by a drying compound called &quot;xerotine siccative&quot;, also called a patent drier. Three men were killed and seven were wounded.
She was relieved by &quot;Swiftsure&quot; in 1882.

&quot;Triumph&quot; returned to Portsmouth, where she was refitted, receiving new boilers and launching rails for torpedoes. She served as Pacific flagship from January 1885 until December 1888, and was present at the official opening of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Vancouver harbour in 1887 for both ceremonial reasons and protection against a rumoured Fenian attack. Her relief at that time by &quot;Swiftsure&quot; signalled the end of her foreign service.

Returning home, she was for a short time in reserve at Devonport, and was then flagship at Queenstown between February 1890 and September 1892. She returned to the reserve at Devonport, where she remained until July 1900. She was disarmed to become a depot ship at Plymouth. Captain Arthur William Edward Prothero was appointed in command on 11 July 1902, for command of Fleet Reserve at Devonport, but the appointment was cancelled and Captain Cecil Thursby was appointed in command from 16 July 1902. In September that year it was announced that her engines and boilers would be removed, and the vessel converted into a hulk. In 1903, with her machinery removed, she was a training ship for boy artificers at Chatham under the new name of &quot;Tenedos&quot;. From 1905 she was tender to , and in 1910 was moved to Devonport to form part of the stoker training establishment, with the name of &quot;Indus IV&quot;. She was towed to Invergordon in 1914 to become a floating store with the name of &quot;Algiers&quot;. She was sold in November 1921, having remained afloat thirteen years longer than her sister.

<text>HMS &quot;Triumph&quot; (N18) was a T-class submarine of the Royal Navy. She was laid down by Vickers at Barrow-in-Furness and launched in 1938. The boat was lost in transit in 1942, with a crew of 64, and its fate was unknown until the sunken boat was rediscovered in June 2023.

==Career==
At the onset of the Second World War, &quot;Triumph&quot; was a member of the 2nd Submarine Flotilla. From 26–29 August 1939, the flotilla deployed to its war bases at Dundee and Blyth.

===Home waters===

On 26 December 1939, &quot;Triumph&quot; hit a German mine in the North Sea. She lost of her bow when it was blown off. Her pressure hull was also damaged, but her torpedoes did not detonate. She managed to limp home under the protection of fighter aircraft and destroyers, and was under repair at Chatham Dockyard until 27 September 1940.

===Mediterranean===
Operating in the Mediterranean from early 1941, &quot;Triumph&quot; sank the Italian merchants &quot;Marzamemi&quot;, &quot;Colomba Lofaro&quot;, &quot;Ninfea&quot;, &quot;Monrosa&quot;, the Italian auxiliary patrol vessels V 136 / &quot;Tugnin F&quot;, &quot;Valoroso&quot;, V 190 / &quot;Frieda&quot; and V 137 / &quot;Trio Frassinetti&quot;, the Italian tug &quot;Dante de Lutti&quot; and salvage vessel , the German merchant &quot;Luvsee&quot;, and the Greek sailing vessels &quot;Panagiotis&quot; and &quot;Aghia Paraskevi&quot;. She also damaged the Italian armed merchant cruiser , the Italian tankers &quot;Ardor&quot; and &quot;Poseidone&quot;, the Italian merchant &quot;Sidamo&quot; and the German merchant &quot;Norburg&quot;

In June 1941 she sank the Italian submarine near northern Egypt.

==Sinking and discovery==

&quot;Triumph&quot; was also used for covert operations, such as landing agents in German-occupied areas. She was planned to be used as a rendezvous for commandos in Operation Colossus, but this had to be cancelled when the landing site became untenable. She undertook one such mission in December 1941, in which she successfully landed agents at Antiparos, Greece on the 30th. She failed to pick up the agents as scheduled on 9 January, and was lost probably to a collision with a mine. All sixty-four crew were lost. A memorial plaque to the boat and her lost crew members was placed in All Saints&#x27; Church, Lindfield, West Sussex.

In June 2023 Greek researchers led by Kostas Thoktaridis discovered the lost submarine in the Aegean Sea at a depth of 203 metres. The submarine rests on the seabed of the open sea with an 8-degree starboard list, dozens of kilometres away from the shores of Sounion. The lowered periscopes and sealed hatches testify that the &quot;Triumph&quot; was in a deep dive during its final moments. The diving planes and rudder are in a straight position, indicating that it was at a steady depth.

<text>The is an origami model named after the tamatebako of Japanese folk tale. It is a modular cube design that can be opened from any side. If more than one face of the model is opened, the cube falls apart and cannot easily be reconstructed. The model, and the directions for creating it, had been lost for centuries and only recently rediscovered.

Drawings from a three volume set of wood carvings, published in 1743 by Ōoka Shunboku, featured a colored origami cube. In 1993, Yasuo Koyanagi identified the cube as the Tamatebako, and the model was published in the book &quot;Koten-ni-miri-origami&quot; by Satoshi Tagaki. The popular origami historian, Masao Okamura then was able to reconstruct the model, and by comparison to other traditional works, verify the model&#x27;s authenticity.

==Basic folding instructions==
Valley-fold a square into thirds between both pairs of edges, creating nine sub-squares. Cut a diagonal X across the entire center square, pinwheel-fold the outer edges, and fold the protruding pinwheel flaps inward, interleaving them to produce a multilayered square with the top woven together. Fold outward the triangular flaps cut from the center square. This creates one face of the cube; the entire cube requires six identical modules.
For each module, tuck one opposing pair of cut flaps into the pockets at the base of the pinwheel, and insert the remaining pair of cut flaps into the pockets of two other faces to assemble the entire cube. The resulting tamatebako can be opened from any face by either unfolding the pinwheel or gently pulling one face completely off the rest of the cube.

==Variations==

The cube can also be assembled by gluing together the undersides of the flaps of adjacent faces. When the glue is dry, tuck the glued flaps into the pinwheel pockets in the same manner as above, with each face having one pair of flaps tucked into itself and the other two tucked into the adjacent faces. Like the original version, the glued cube can be opened from any face by unfolding its pinwheel, but will not fall apart if multiple faces are opened.

A more elaborate traditional version of the Tamatebako can be made in the form of a cuboctahedron, still using six square pinwheel faces as described above. All four of the cut center flaps from each pinwheel square are extended outward; each of the eight new faces is formed by overlapping one flap each from three adjacent faces to form an equilateral triangle. Originally, the overlapped triangle was glued together, although it is possible to construct a triangular face hinge that does not require glue.

The folding pattern for this form was documented by Isao Honda in 1933 alongside the simple cube. It was also documented by Harry Houdini as a &quot;Japanese hexagon puzzle box&quot; in 1922 without the simple cube version, in the company of several other traditional models which he learned from a Japanese acquaintance. Like the cube, this form can also be opened from any of the six square faces by unfolding each pinwheel, but will not fall apart if assembled with glue.

<doc id="1010309" wikidata="Q415571" url="?curid=1010309" title="Bleomycin">
<text>Bleomycin is a medication primarily used to treat cancer. This includes Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, and cervical cancer among others. Typically used with other cancer medications, it can be given intravenously, by injection into a muscle or under the skin. It may also be administered inside the chest to help prevent the recurrence of a pleural effusion due to cancer; however talc is better for this. It may sometimes be used to treat other difficult-to-treat skin lesions such as plantars warts in immunocompromised patients.
Common side effects include fever, weight loss, vomiting, and rash. A severe type of anaphylaxis may occur. It may also cause inflammation of the lungs that can result in lung scarring. Chest X-rays every couple of weeks are recommended to check for this. Bleomycin may cause harm to the baby if used during pregnancy. It is believed to primarily work by preventing the synthesis of DNA.
Bleomycin was discovered in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. It is made by the bacterium &quot;Streptomyces verticillus&quot;.

==Medical uses==

===Cancer===
Bleomycin is mostly used to treat cancer. This includes testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, and Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, and less commonly non-Hodgkin&#x27;s disease. It can be given intravenously, by intramuscular injection, or under the skin.

===Other uses===
It may also be put inside the chest to help prevent the recurrence of a pleural effusion due to cancer. However, for scarring down the pleura, talc appears to be the better option although indwelling pleural catheters are at least as effective in reducing the symptoms of an effusion(such as dyspnea).

While potentially effective against bacterial infections, its toxicity prevents its use for this purpose. It has been studied in the treatment of warts but is of unclear benefit.

== Side effects ==
The most common side effects are flu-like symptoms and include fever, rash, dermatographism, hyperpigmentation, alopecia (hair loss), chills, and Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon (discoloration of fingers and toes). The most serious complication of bleomycin, occurring upon increasing dosage, is pulmonary fibrosis and impaired lung function. It has been suggested that bleomycin induces sensitivity to oxygen toxicity and recent studies support the role of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1beta in the mechanism of bleomycin-induced lung injury. Any previous treatment with bleomycin should therefore always be disclosed to the anaesthetist prior to undergoing a procedure requiring general anaesthesia. Due to the oxygen sensitive nature of bleomycin, and the theorised increased likelihood of developing pulmonary fibrosis following supplemental oxygen therapy, it has been questioned whether patients should take part in scuba diving following treatment with the drug. Bleomycin has also been found to disrupt the sense of taste.

=== Lifetime cumulative dose ===
Bleomycin should not exceed a lifetime cumulative dose greater than 400 units. Pulmonary toxicities, most commonly presenting as pulmonary fibrosis, are associated with doses of bleomycin greater than 400 units.

== Mechanism of action ==
Bleomycin acts by induction of DNA strand breaks. Some studies suggest bleomycin also inhibits incorporation of thymidine into DNA strands. DNA cleavage by bleomycin depends on oxygen and metal ions, at least &quot;in vitro&quot;. The exact mechanism of DNA strand scission is unresolved, but it has been suggested that bleomycin chelates metal ions (primarily iron), producing a pseudoenzyme that reacts with oxygen to produce superoxide and hydroxide free radicals that cleave DNA. An alternative hypothesis states that bleomycin may bind at specific sites in the DNA strand and induce scission by abstracting the hydrogen atom from the base, resulting in strand cleavage as the base undergoes a Criegee-type rearrangement, or forms an alkali-labile lesion.

== Biosynthesis ==
Biosynthesis of bleomycin is completed by glycosylation of the aglycones. Bleomycin naturally occurring-analogues have two to three sugar molecules, and DNA cleavage activities of these analogues have been assessed, primarily by the plasmid relaxation and break light assays.

== History ==

Bleomycin was first discovered in 1962 when the Japanese scientist Hamao Umezawa found anticancer activity while screening culture filtrates of &quot;Streptomyces verticillus&quot;. Umezawa published his discovery in 1966. The drug was launched in Japan by Nippon Kayaku in 1969. In the US, bleomycin gained FDA approval in July 1973. It was initially marketed in the US by the Bristol-Myers Squibb precursor, Bristol Laboratories, under the brand name Blenoxane.

==Research==
Bleomycin is used in research to induce pulmonary fibrosis in mice. It accomplishes this by preventing alveolar cell proliferation, which in turn leads to cellular senescence.

<doc id="1010311" wikidata="Q1639826" url="?curid=1010311" title="Micromanagement (gameplay)">
<text>Micromanagement in gaming is the handling of detailed gameplay elements by the player. It appears in a wide range of games and genres, including strategy video games, construction and management simulations, and pet-raising simulations. Micromanagement has been perceived in different ways by game designers and players for many years: some perceive it as a useful addition to games that adds options and technique to the gameplay, something that is necessary if the game is to support top-level competitions; some enjoy opportunities to use tactical skill in strategic games; others regard it as an unwelcome distraction from higher levels of strategic thinking and dislike having to do a lot of detailed work. Some developers attempt to minimize micromanagement in a game&#x27;s interface for this reason.

==Combat==
Detailed management of units in combat aims to maximize damage given to enemy units and minimize damage to the player&#x27;s units. For standard combat units the most common techniques are: grouping units into formations, for example to keep lightly armored shooters behind and protected by more heavily armored melee units; concentrating the fire of all ranged units on one target and then a second, etc., to destroy threats as fast as possible; withdrawing seriously damaged units from combat, if repairing / healing them is cheaper than replacing them; &quot;dancing&quot; units that have taken some damage out of enemy weapons range and then back into combat once the enemy have locked on to another target; using military tactics such as flanking and counterattacks; exploiting nontransitive (&quot;circle of death&quot; or &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot;) power relationships between units; using cheap units to draw the enemy&#x27;s fire away from more expensive units, gameplay especially typical of games of the real-time tactics type. Micromanagement is even more necessary for units with special abilities, that can only be used infrequently. &quot;Micromanagement&quot; in this sense is often abbreviated to &quot;micro&quot;, which can be used as a noun or a verb.

==Versus macromanagement==

There is sometimes confusion regarding the difference between micromanagement and macromanagement, normally abbreviated as &#x27;micro&#x27; and &#x27;macro&#x27; respectively. Macro generally refers to managing large quantities of tasks at the same time. For example, building units from various structures throughout the game while also building more structures, scouting, creating new bases, etc. This is different from micro, which is generally controlling small numbers of units and giving them very specific orders.

==Economic==
The range of possible economic micromanagement techniques is much wider than for combat, because strategy games&#x27; economies work in so many different ways. If the game uses &quot;worker&quot; units to gather resources and / or build things (a common technique in real-time strategy games), one must make sure none are idle and that they are doing the right things, and must avoid letting enemy raiders destroy them. In some turn-based games one tells colonies what percentages of their efforts to put into various activities such as industrial growth, research, and building defenses or combat units; as colonies grow or the strategic situation changes, one has to check and adjust these ratios. In Sid Meier&#x27;s &quot;Civilization&quot; series, it may be important for either economic or military reasons to build railroads as fast as possible, and doing this efficiently requires considerable micromanagement of Settler/Engineer units.

==Twitch vs trick==

Some forms of micromanagement involve continuous input of a large number of commands over a short period of time. This is known as twitch micromanagement. For example, a micromanagement technique known as kiting requires continuous input from the player in order to keep their character at an optimum distance from a target. Another example of twitch micromanagement can be found in racing games whereby a player is required to keep making split second adjustments to the position of their vehicle.

In contrast to twitch micromanagement, some game elements need only occasional input from the player in order to exploit tricks in their behavior. In these situations, quick thinking is rewarded over continuous, quick reaction. This is known as trick micromanagement.

Other types of games are based entirely on micromanagement, such as pet-raising simulations and games like &quot;Cake Mania&quot;, where the player&#x27;s ability to micromanage is often the only skill being tested by the game.

==Policy-based==
Some games are designed in such a way that players must constantly set or check strategic parameters to ensure that operations are proceeding smoothly and efficiently. A typical city-building game or 4X game, for example, requires the player to regulate taxation and production levels in order to keep their industries and commerce flowing. The amount of detail that goes into a simulation like this may necessitate spending a disproportionate amount of time in adjusting relatively minor parameters in order to achieve maximum efficiency.

==Controversy==
Micromanagement can divert the player&#x27;s attention from grand strategy by overloading the player with repetitive and mechanical work. Some commentators think that &quot;Strategy is irrelevant in today&#x27;s real-time strategy games when you&#x27;re playing against a fourteen-year-old who can click twice as fast as you.&quot; Games in which constant micromanagement is needed are often described as &quot;micromanagement hell&quot;.

In turn-based games the need for economic micromanagement is generally regarded as a defect in the design, and more recent TBS games have tried to minimize it. But hands-on tactical combat is a feature of many turn-based games (e.g. &quot;Master of Orion II&quot;, &quot;Space Empires III&quot;, &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic III&quot;), and reviewers complained about the difficulty of controlling combat in &quot;Master of Orion 3&quot;.

There is controversy between fans of different RTS games about whether micromanagement is: (a) a skill which involves making decisions quickly while under pressure; or (b) a chore which degenerates into a &quot;clickfest&quot; where a player who is faster with the mouse usually beats a player who is better at grand strategy. As a result, real time strategy games vary widely from e.g. &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;, which eliminates most economic micromanagement and reduces tactical micromanagement, to &quot;StarCraft&quot;, in which both economic and tactical micromanagement are considered important skills. Software has been developed to analyze players&#x27; actions per minute (commonly known as APM). Other games aim for differing levels of micromanagement of different types: for instance, the Relic Entertainment title &quot;Dawn of War 2&quot; minimises economic micromanagement as much as possible, such that there is no base construction, all units are produced from a single source, and resources are accumulated automatically over time by controlling strategic battlefield locations, while on the other hand the game emphasises tactical micromanagement as its primary skill, with combat taking place principally between relatively small squads of highly effective and highly vulnerable units, with victory a function of the rapid deployment of special weapons and tactics in order to counter enemy manoeuvres and inflict maximum damage quickly while avoiding sustaining damage.

A Gamasutra article pointed out that micromanagement in &quot;Civilization III&quot; resulted in the game becoming &quot;a chore more than a game,&quot; explaining: &quot;Computers can now animate more units than any player could reasonably want to control, and the number will continue to increase exponentially.&quot;

Many role-playing video games and first-person shooters are developing more advanced hotkey layouts, allowing these genres to develop their own micromanagement skills.

==In popular culture==
*The popular Internet-distributed mockumentary series &quot;Pure Pwnage&quot; coined the term &quot;über-micro&quot;, a term describing unusually superior levels of micromanagement. In one episode, it was claimed that micromanagement was discovered in &quot;The Battle of 1974&quot;.
*In South Korea, the real-time strategy game &quot;StarCraft&quot; is highly popular as a professional sport. The need to micromanage efficiently and multitask under pressure are regarded as features that make it suitable for top-level competitions. The game is broadcast on Korean national television, showing professional players&#x27; micromanagement skills.

<text>HMS &quot;Thetis&quot; was an second-class protected cruiser of the Royal Navy, launched on 13 December 1890. Her first significant mission was service in the Bering Sea Patrol with American warships in a combined effort to suppress poaching in the Bering Sea.

She served on the Mediterranean Station until relieved in March 1901. She was paid off at Chatham in early June 1901, and was placed in the Fleet reserve. She was commissioned at Chatham on 25 November 1902 with a complement of 273 officers and men for service on the China Station. She left Sheerness on 14 December, stopping in Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Aden and more places before arriving in China the following year.

The latter half of her career was spent as a mine-layer. Laden with concrete, she was deliberately sunk at as a blockship in attempt to block the canal in the Zeebrugge Raid during the First World War, on 23 April 1918.
Post-war, &quot;Thetis&quot; was beached on a sandbank west of the harbour entrance. The wreck was cleared in 1957.

<text>Arnold Frolows (15 January 1950 – 12 January 2025) was an Australian radio personality best known as music director at the Australian radio station triple j.

==Life and career==
Frolows started his career in music in 1970, as a manager of Virgin record stores in London.

After returning to Australia in late 1974 he was hired as one of the foundation staff of Double Jay in Sydney, which began broadcasting in January 1975. He managed the record library and programming of the station. He temporarily returned to the United Kingdom where he was, among other things, head of A&amp;R, at Virgin Records UK.

In 1983, he re-joined triple j, where he took on the role of music director, a position that he held until his retirement from the station in 2003. During this time he also hosted &quot;Ambience&quot;, a program focussing on ambient music until the late 1980s. During his last few years at the station, he was criticised in the music media as being &quot;too old&quot; to work at a youth station.

After leaving Triple J, Frolows remained with the ABC to become a programmer for the new digital radio station ABC DiG, then music director at ABC JAZZ.

Frolows died at Mona Vale Hospice in Sydney, on 12 January 2025, at the age of 74, less than a month after having been diagnosed with pancreatic and liver cancer.

Situated in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal, India; it comes under Darjeeling Wildlife division and can be reached from Siliguri in 30 minutes. Sukna, the gateway to the sanctuary, is only 13 km from Siliguri and 28 km from Bagdogra airport. The sanctuary sprawls over 159 km2 of reserve forest and was started as a game sanctuary in 1955. In 1959, it got the status of a sanctuary mainly to protect the Indian bison and royal Bengal tiger, which were facing the threat of extinction.

==Geography==

The forest type in Mahananda WLS varies from riverain forests like Khayer-Sisoo to dense mixed-wet forest in the higher elevation in Latpanchar area of Kurseong hills. The variation in elevation and forest types helps the existence of a large number of species of mammals, birds and reptiles. Varying elevation from 166 metres at the southern range of Sukna forest to the elevation up to 1,500 metres at Latkothi beat office covers varied vegetation and is home to superb biome restricted species. Latpanchar actually forms the highest part of the Sanctuary, with an average elevation of 1,400 metres.

==Biodiversity== 
Avian fauna listed from this park are of A1, A2 and A3 categories with IBA site code IN-WB-07.

<doc id="1010319" wikidata="Q1514366" url="?curid=1010319" title="HMS Thetis (N25)">
<text>HMS &quot;Thetis&quot; (N25) was a Group 1 T-class submarine of the Royal Navy which sank during sea trials in Liverpool Bay, England on 1 June 1939. After being salvaged and repaired, the boat was recommissioned as HMS &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; in 1940. It served during the Second World War until being lost with all hands in the Mediterranean on 14 March 1943.

The &quot;Thetis&quot; accident happened after the inner hatch on a torpedo tube was opened while the outer hatch to the sea was also open. Four men successfully used the aft escape chamber to reach the surface and be rescued. A total of 99 men died as a result. The sinking led to the redesign of all torpedo tubes on British and Australian submarines. A latch, known as the &quot;&quot;Thetis&quot; clip&quot;, was added to the inner torpedo tube door so it could be fractionally opened to check the tube was not open to the sea before being fully opened.

==As HMS &quot;Thetis&quot;==
&quot;Thetis&quot; was built by Cammell Laird in Birkenhead, England and launched on 29 June 1938. After completion, trials were delayed because the forward hydroplanes jammed, but eventually started in Liverpool Bay under Lieutenant Commander Guy Bolus. &quot;Thetis&quot; left Birkenhead for Liverpool Bay to conduct her final diving trials, accompanied by the tug &quot;Grebe Cock&quot;. As well as her normal complement of 59 men she was carrying technical observers from Cammell Laird and other naval personnel, a total of 103 men. The first dive was attempted at about 14:00 on 1 June 1939. The submarine was too light to dive, so a survey of the water in the various tanks on board was made. One of the checks was whether the internal torpedo tubes were flooded.

Lieutenant Frederick Woods, the torpedo officer, opened the test cocks on the tubes. Unfortunately, the test cock on tube number 5 was blocked by some enamel paint so no water flowed out even though the bow cap was open. Prickers to clear the test cocks had been provided but they were not used. This combined with a confusing layout of the bow cap indicators — they were arranged in a vertical line with 5 at the bottom (2,1,4,3,6, and then 5) and the &quot;Shut&quot; position for tube 5 on the dial was the mirror image of tube 6 above it — led to the inner door of the tube being opened. The inrush of water caused the bow of the submarine to sink to the seabed below the surface. How the outer door (bow cap) to Tube 5 became open to the sea is unknown: Woods maintained that not more than 10 minutes before he opened the tube all the indicators were at &quot;Shut&quot;.

An indicator buoy was released and smoke candle fired. By 16:00, &quot;Grebe Cock&quot; was becoming concerned for the safety of &quot;Thetis&quot; and radioed HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot; submarine base at Gosport. A search was immediately instigated. Although the stern remained on the surface, only three RN personnel (Lieutenant Frederick Woods, Captain Harry Oram and Leading Stoker Walter Arnold) and one Cammell Laird man (Fitter Frank Shaw) escaped before the rest were overcome by carbon dioxide poisoning caused by the crowded conditions, the increased atmospheric pressure and a delay of 20 hours before the evacuation started. Ninety-nine lives were lost in the incident: 51 crew members, 26 Cammell Laird employees, 8 other naval officers, 7 Admiralty overseeing officers, 4 Vickers-Armstrong employees, 2 caterers and a Mersey pilot. The crew waited before abandoning the vessel until she had been discovered by the destroyer , which had been sent to search for her and which indicated her presence by dropping small explosive charges into the water.

In order to effect an escape from the stricken vessel, the crew were required to enter the submarine&#x27;s aft escape chamber, the forward chamber being at deeper than safe depth. Four men, three RN personnel (Lieutenant Woods, Captain Oram and Leading Stoker Arnold) and one Cammell Laird&#x27;s employee (Fitter Shaw) successfully used the escape chamber. Two men escaped, then an attempt with four men failed, drowning three. There was one more double escape. Any further attempts were not successful.

The incident attracted legal action from one of the widows, who brought a claim of negligence against the shipbuilders, for not removing the material blocking the valve. The Admiralty successfully invoked Crown Privilege (now termed Public Interest Immunity) and blocked the disclosure of, amongst other items, &#x27;the contract for the hull and machinery of &quot;Thetis&quot; as evidence in court, on the basis that to do so would be &#x27;injurious to the public interest&#x27;. The case is one of interest in English law, as the judges in this case accepted the Admiralty&#x27;s claim at face value with no scrutiny, a ruling later overturned.


The Liverpool &amp; Glasgow Salvage Association was commissioned to salvage the sunken submarine. On completion of the salvage operation the bell from &quot;Thetis&quot; was presented to the Liverpool &amp; Glasgow Salvage Association by the Admiralty. It is now at the Merseyside Maritime Museum, along with the plate from number five torpedo tube and the officers&#x27; wardroom clock.

One further fatality occurred during salvage operations, when one of the divers died from &quot;the bends&quot; on 23 August 1939. On 3 September, &quot;Thetis&quot; was intentionally grounded ashore at Traeth Bychan, Anglesey. It was the same day that war was declared. Human remains that had not already been removed by the salvage team were then brought out to a naval funeral, with full honours.

The loss went beyond that of a submarine&#x27;s crew. Among the dead were two naval constructors and several of the submarine team from Cammell-Laird. These were experienced designers and builders of submarines who would have been needed during the war. Among the letters of condolence was one from Hitler.
The &quot;Thetis&quot; disaster was in marked contrast to the successful rescue of the survivors of , which had sunk off the coast of New Hampshire just a week previously. &quot;Squalus&quot; however, unlike &quot;Thetis&quot;, sank on an even keel, allowing a diving chamber to be used whereas the extreme angle of the &quot;Thetis&quot; made this impossible.

A memorial to the crew was unveiled at Maeshyfryd Cemetery, Holyhead on 7 November 1947. A second was unveiled on 1 June 2014, at the River Walkway, Woodside, Birkenhead.

==As HMS &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;==
After being successfully salvaged and repaired the submarine was commissioned in 1940 as HMS &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; under the command of Lt. Cdr. Cecil Crouch.

During the next 18 months, she saw service in the Atlantic Ocean: In December 1940 she was on patrol in the Bay of Biscay and on 15 December she encountered and sank the Italian submarine .

In the autumn of 1942, &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; was converted with her sister ships and to carry two &quot;Chariots&quot; (a type of manned torpedo) and their crews for operations against Axis shipping in harbour, and was transferred with them to the Mediterranean Sea in December 1942.

Their first mission, Operation Principal, was undertaken in December 1942, the three boats taking their charges to targets around the Mediterranean. &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;″s objective was shipping in Cagliari, but the operation was not a success, and &quot;P311&quot; was lost at La Maddalena, her intended target.

A second operation against Palermo harbour in January 1943 was more successful. On 2–3 January, the manned torpedoes entered the harbour and mined the ships there, sinking the hull of the incomplete light cruiser &quot;Ulpio Traiano&quot; and the freighter .

A further mission to Tripoli harbour took place on 18 January. This was to prevent the Axis using blockships to neutralize Tripoli harbour, which was about to be occupied by the British Eighth Army.

On 20 February 1943, &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; shelled the Albanian sailboat &quot;Villanzen Veli&quot; off Bari. The British submarine was forced to dive and escape by the combined fire of the Italian auxiliary cruiser &quot;Brindisi&quot; and a coastal battery, while the sailboat only received light damage.

&quot;Thunderbolt&quot; was sunk on 14 March 1943 off Sicily by the Italian corvette &quot;Cicogna&quot;, which had detected her and attacked with depth charges. &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; sank in of water, with the loss of all hands.

==Appearance in the media==
The 1950 film &quot;Morning Departure&quot;, directed by Roy Ward Baker, was based on a stage play of the same name by Kenneth Woollard that itself was based on the loss of HMS &quot;Thetis&quot; (N25). The play was very popular at the time the film was made. Besides being presented on stage in several theatres in Britain, it had already been made as a live TV play by the BBC, first on 1 December 1946. The film starred John Mills and Richard Attenborough and was the feature film debut of Michael Caine. The actor James Hayter, who was a relative of one of the Naval Officers who died in HMS &quot;Thetis&quot;, Commander Reginald Hayter RN, plays the cook A/B Higgins in the film. It features the accidental sinking of a British submarine, HMS &quot;Trojan&quot;, when on exercise. The submarine detonates an unexploded mine from World War Two and sinks to the seabed after several compartments are flooded due to the explosion, killing the majority of the submarine&#x27;s crew. Of the surviving crew in a watertight compartment, eight are able to escape through the gun hatch and conning tower using the only available breathing apparatus. The remaining crew wait for the submarine to be salvaged. This is eventually abandoned due to bad weather and they perish.

The cause of the loss of &quot;Thetis&quot; – flooding due to both inner and outer torpedo hatches being open to the sea – was used in the 1968 film &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;, where the character played by Patrick McGoohan describes a method of sabotaging a submarine by blocking the tube test cocks, fooling a torpedoman into believing the outer hatch was closed. How it got open in the movie without displaying on the appropriate indicator boards was avoided.

Alexander Fullerton&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;Not Thinking of Death&quot; centres around a fictionalised account of the sinking (with &quot;Thetis&quot; renamed to &quot;Trumpeter&quot;).

The loss of the &quot;Thetis&quot; was the inspiration for part of the &quot;Railway station&quot; episode (episode 2) of British science fiction television series &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot;.

In 1997, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio play about the &quot;Thetis&quot; disaster. The play was called &quot;Close Enough To Touch&quot; and was written by Liverpool writer Fred Lawless. The play was also broadcast on BBC Radio Merseyside and the BBC World Service. In 1999, a play entitled &quot;HMS Thetis&quot; by Mark Gee in association with David Roberts, was performed at the Liverpool Bluecoat Chambers and at Birkenhead&#x27;s Pacific Road Theatre. The play starred John McArdle and also the newly employed First Year Apprentices from Cammell Laird Shipyard (Paul Gillies, Dave Gill, Alan Lane, Chris Motley, Mike Jebb, Steve Taylor, Ollie Dodson, Stuie Dicken, Mark Poland, Ben McDonald, Tony Cummins, Barry Hayes, Chris Hall, Martin King, Graham Crilly, Billy Coburn, Matty Brassey).

In 2000 the documentary &quot;Death in the Bay&quot;, produced by BBC Northwest, was broadcast in the UK. It covered the loss of the vessel and the subsequent enquiry, together with interviews with relatives of two of the men lost in the tragedy and the son of a survivor, Leading Stoker Arnold.

<text>Sea Rim State Park is a state park in southeast Texas.
The park is located on the Gulf of Mexico in southern Jefferson County, south of Port Arthur and just west of Sabine Pass. The park was closed for several years due to extensive damage from Hurricanes Rita (2005) and Ike (2008). The park reopened in 2010.

==Description==

The D. Roy Harrington Beach unit is the coastal portion of the park, offering beach access between the Gulf of Mexico and the mainland marshes. Swimming in the marshes is not recommended due to the presence of alligators.

The Marshlands unit is located in the inland marshes of southern Jefferson County. It holds the park’s only cabin as well as the boat launch for the boat trails. The park does rent canoes and kayaks so that these areas of the park may be explored by visitors.

Many species of migratory birds stop in or pass through the park. Ideal places to view them include the Gambusia Nature Trail, Willow Pond boardwalk, and wildlife viewing platform located in Fence Lake accessible by boat.

The park loans out fishing equipment, crabbing equipment, junior ranger backpacks, binoculars, and personal flotation devices at the headquarters building for free.

McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge borders the park.

Three nearby national wildlife refuges on the Texas coast - Brazoria N.W.R., San Bernard and Big Boggy - form a vital complex of coastal wetlands harboring more than 300 bird species.

==History==
The park land was purchased from the Planet Oil and Mineral Corporation and Horizon Sales Corporation in 1972, and opened in 1977.

The portion of Texas State Highway 87 extending through Sea Rim to High Island is closed, having been destroyed in 1989 by Hurricane Jerry. Previous storms had eroded the beach, leaving the highway vulnerable to storm-generated surf.

In September 2005, Hurricane Rita did extensive damage to Sea Rim State Park, forcing its closure. Hurricane Ike caused further damage in 2008. In April 2010, the park re-opened to limited daytime use. By June 2014, TPWD had restored services at the park. The park provides water and electric service to campsites located off of the beach. Visitors have an option to camp on the beach in primitive campsites. More detailed information is available on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Division website.

<doc id="1010330" wikidata="Q3773987" url="?curid=1010330" title="Kosteletzkya">
<text>Kosteletzkya is a genus of the plant family Malvaceae that includes the seashore mallow (&quot;K. pentacarpos&quot;). It includes about 27 species found worldwide.

Although similar in appearance to &quot;Hibiscus&quot;, &quot;Kosteletzkya&quot; typically bears more flattened capsules that dehisce . The genus was separated from &quot;Hibiscus&quot; in 1835 by Carl Borivoj Presl, who named it after Vincenz Franz Kosteletzky (1801–1887).

Phylogenetic evidence supports this genus being polyphyletic, with New World and Malagasy species of &quot;Kosteletzkya&quot; belonging to completely different clades within the Hibisceae. Under a revised nomenclature, only New World species would retain the genus name &quot;Kosteletzkya&quot;. An alternate revision would be to merge all New World &quot;Kosteletzkya&quot; species into &quot;Hibiscus&quot;.

== Species ==
These species are recognized by Plants of the World Online as of June 2022:
*&quot;Kosteletzkya adoensis&quot;

<text>John Smith (1721–1797) was a Scottish physician and academic.

Smith was born in Maybole, Scotland, where his father, William, was a merchant.
He studied at the University of Glasgow beginning in 1736, entered Balliol College, Oxford in 1744 with the support of the Snell Exhibition, and earned a B.A. in 1748 and an M.A. in 1751 from Balliol.
He then studied under Nathan Alcock in St Mary Hall, earning his doctorate in 1757. Alcock left Oxford for Bath in the same year, and Smith took his place. At Oxford, he taught anatomy and chemistry. Despite not being a mathematician, he held the Savilian chair of geometry from 1766 until his death in 1797.
