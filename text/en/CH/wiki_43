Rajskub was raised in Trenton, Michigan, having moved there from Detroit. Along with two older sisters, she is the daughter of Betty and Tony Rajskub, a pharmacist&#x27;s assistant and a pipefitter, respectively.
One of her childhood inspirations was the television series &quot;Moonlighting&quot;. Rajskub attended the Center for Creative Studies and later the San Francisco Art Institute. During the early nineties, she often performed at various open mics in San Francisco.

She later moved to Los Angeles working as a waitress in a Hard Rock Cafe.
==Career==
Rajskub&#x27;s first part was as an Oompa-Loompa in a community theater production of &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, and her first starring role was Raggedy Ann. In 1996 she appeared in music videos for the songs &quot;The Good Life&quot; by Weezer and &quot;The New Pollution&quot; by Beck.

Rajskub was one of the original cast members of &quot;Mr. Show with Bob and David&quot;. From 1996–1998, she had a recurring role on the HBO series &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; as booking assistant Mary Lou Collins, appearing in 18 episodes. She would later have a recurring, semi-regular role on the short-lived but hit 90&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet,&quot; playing Chloe in 15 episodes.

Her most notable role is CTU systems analyst Chloe O&#x27;Brian on &quot;24&quot;, which she joined in 2003 at the start of the show&#x27;s third season. Her character was a hit with viewers and critics and was one of the few cast members to return in the show&#x27;s fourth season. After being a regular guest star for two seasons, Rajskub became a main cast member in the show&#x27;s fifth season. By the end of the series, she was the lead female, with top billing second only to Kiefer Sutherland. Her character also had the honor of saying the final words of the series in the season 8 series finale. Rajskub and Sutherland appeared briefly as their &quot;24&quot; characters in a 2007 episode, &quot;24 Minutes&quot;, of the Fox animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In August 2013, it was announced that she would reprise her Chloe O&#x27;Brian role in the 2014 limited series &quot;24: Live Another Day&quot;.

Rajskub appeared in Kelsey Grammer&#x27;s &quot;The Sketch Show&quot; on Fox Television, &quot;The King of Queens&quot; as a character named Priscilla, and in numerous films including &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot;, &quot;Legally Blonde 2&quot;, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot;, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot;, &quot;The Anniversary Party&quot;, &quot;Firewall&quot;, &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;, music videos for Beck, Weezer and Sheryl Crow, as well as portraying a blind woman in the film &quot;Road Trip&quot;.

Rajskub was part of a comic duo (with Karen Kilgariff) called Girls Guitar Club. In 2006, she made a cameo appearance in &quot;Partings&quot;, the 6th season finale of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, where she played a trobairitz looking for her big break. (Rajskub had previously appeared on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as the female lead in &quot;A Film by Kirk&quot;, a short film made by the character Kirk Gleason.) She has volunteered as an actress with the Young Storytellers Program. She has an educational background as a painter, having attended the San Francisco Art Institute. 

Rajskub has been nominated twice for a Screen Actors Guild Award; once in 2005, and again in 2007 for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. She guest-starred on &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot; episode &quot;Prime Minister&quot; as Karen, an Art Garfunkel fanatic. She guest-starred as &quot;Gail the Snail&quot; in an episode of &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; titled &quot;The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention&quot;, and reprised the role in the ninth-season finale, &quot;The Gang Squashes Their Beefs,&quot; and season thirteen&#x27;s &quot;The Gang Beats Boggs: Ladies Reboot.&quot; In 2009, she also appeared in the film &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot; as Sarah, one of Julie Powell&#x27;s close friends. In 2010, Rajskub performed stand-up on &quot;John Oliver&#x27;s New York Stand Up Show&quot;. In June 2010, she appeared in the &quot;Lovesick&quot; episode during the second season of the USA series &quot;Royal Pains&quot;.

From July through October 2010, she performed in her solo show, &quot;Mary Lynn Spreads Her Legs&quot;, at the Steve Allen Theater in Los Angeles. Reviewer F. Kathleen Foley of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote &quot;that cheerfully vulgar title sums up the overall tone, which is often breezily obscene&quot;. The show, written by Rajskub with help from director/developer Amit Itelman, was inspired by Rajskub&#x27;s experiences with pregnancy, childbirth, and early motherhood. 

In January 2011, Rajskub guest-starred in the episode &quot;Our Children, Ourselves&quot; on the second season of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Modern Family&quot;. In the fall of 2011, Rajskub appeared in the short-lived sitcom &quot;How to Be a Gentleman.&quot; Also in 2011, Rajskub&#x27;s web series, &quot;Dicki&quot;, began airing on My Damn Channel. &quot;Dicki&quot; is based on a number of people that Rajskub grew up with in and around Michigan. The title character is a 40-year-old woman who lives at home with her parents, makes crafts, and takes her art seriously. &quot;Dicki&quot; has been one of My Damn Channel&#x27;s most successful web series to date. The first season concluded in November 2011, but a second season is currently in development. Rajskub performed in the June 2012 edition of &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell My Mother!

In 2012 she began hosting a podcast on the Nerdist Network called &quot;Kickin&#x27; it Mary Lynn Style&quot;.

In 2013, Rajskub appeared in the fourth season of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; in a silent yet well-received role as Heartfire, a character Rajskub has said &quot;speak[s] from the heart, but do[es]n&#x27;t use any words.&quot; In the same year Rajskub also appeared in the web series &quot;All Growz Up with Melinda Hill&quot;.

Rajskub was featured in a music video for the Self song &quot;Looks and Money&quot; in 2015, directed by Dave Foley and starring himself with Rajskub.

In August 2016, Rajskub appeared at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in &quot;24 Hours With Mary Lynn Rajskub&quot;. A comedy special that dealt with issues of domestic life as well as her stardom and work in various independent ventures, the performance was well-received by both critics and fans.

In 2017, Rajskub appeared in the first season of the Adult Swim series &quot;Dream Corp LLC&quot;, playing Patient 46 in the episode &quot;Are You Down With OCD?&quot;. Her appearance involved two leading characters, T.E.R.R.Y. (Stephen Merchant) and Patient 88 (Nicholas Rutherford), competing for her attention. Rajskub appeared in the 2018 comedy &quot;Night School&quot;, starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish. The movie received middling reviews, with Michael Phillips of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; noting that &quot;the actors aren&#x27;t the problem with &quot;Night School&quot;; the material is.&quot;

In 2021, Rajskub released a 49-minute comedy special called &quot;Mary Lynn Rajskub: Live from the Pandemic&quot;. The same year, she appeared in Amazon&#x27;s science fiction movie &quot;The Tomorrow War&quot;, starring Chris Pratt, Yvonne Strahovski and J.K. Simmons. Rajskub also had a four-episode role in the Hulu series &quot;The Dropout&quot;, a dramatization of the Theranos scandal starring Amanda Seyfried; Rajskub played Lorraine Fuisz, wife of William H. Macy&#x27;s Richard Fuisz.

In 2022, Rajskub released her first book, &quot;Fame-ish: My Life At The Edge Of Stardom&quot;. In 2023, she was a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune&quot;, where she was a fan favorite. An official clip of her and fellow actor Paul Scheer accrued over two million views on TikTok.

<doc id="1022159" wikidata="Q172831" url="?curid=1022159" title="1960 European Nations' Cup">
<text>The 1960 European Nations&#x27; Cup was the inaugural tournament of the UEFA European Championship, held every four years and organised by UEFA. The first tournament was held in France. It was won by the Soviet Union, who beat Yugoslavia 2–1 in Paris after extra time.

The tournament was a knockout competition, with just 17 teams entering. There were some notable absences, including West Germany, Italy, Netherlands and England, each of whom had voted against the creation of the tournament in 1957. The entrants would play home-and-away matches until the semi-finals; the final four teams would then move on to the final tournament, whose host was selected after the teams became known.

In the quarter-finals, Spain, who were under Francoist rule, refused to travel to the Soviet Union for political reasons. After a proposal to play the tie over one leg at a neutral venue were rejected by the Soviets, Spain were disqualified: accordingly, three of the final four teams were from communist countries: the USSR, Czechoslovakia, and SFR Yugoslavia, to go with hosts France.

In the semi-finals, the Soviets made easy work of the Czechoslovaks in Marseille, beating them 3–0. The other match saw a nine-goal thriller as Yugoslavia came on top 5–4 after coming back from a two-goal deficit twice. Czechoslovakia beat the French 2–0 for third place.

In the final, Yugoslavia scored first, but the Soviet Union, led by legendary goalkeeper Lev Yashin, equalised in the 49th minute. After 90 minutes the score was 1–1, and Viktor Ponedelnik scored with seven minutes left in extra time to give the Soviets the inaugural European Championship.

<doc id="1022163" wikidata="Q7700631" url="?curid=1022163" title="Tensei Kono">
<text>was a prominent Japanese mystery and science fiction writer who won the Mystery Writers of Japan Award and was a two-time finalist for the Naoki Prize. His short fiction including his often-reprinted story &quot;Triceratops&quot; has been translated into English in anthologies such as &quot;Speculative Japan: Outstanding Tales of Japanese Science Fiction and Fantasy&quot;, &quot;The Best Japanese Science Fiction Stories&quot; and &quot;The World Treasury of Science Fiction&quot;. In total, he published more than 30 novels and short story collections.

== Life ==
Kono was born in Kōchi, Kōchi Prefecture and studied French literature at Keio University. While at the university he began writing poems, plays, and fantasy novels, publishing his play &quot;The Fallen Hawk&quot; in the school&#x27;s literary magazine.

He died at the age of 77 on January 29, 2012 due to aspiration pneumonia.

== Writing career ==

In 1958, Kono dropped out of Keio University and began working in television. The following year he submitted &quot;Going My Way&quot; to a call for original novels for the Nippon Television program &quot;Night Prism&quot;, where his work received an honorable mention. He also began publishing hard-boiled mystery stories in publications such as the Japanese edition of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine. In 1960 he published the collection of short stories &quot;Young Men Die in the Sun&quot; and the following year the collection &quot;On the Asphalt&quot;. In 1964 he won the Mystery Writers of Japan Award for &quot;Satsui to iu Na no Kachiku&quot; (殺意という名の家畜 &quot;A Livestock Named Murderous&quot;). As a result of his success in mystery writing he was named one of the &quot;three hard-boiled crows&quot; alongside fellow authors Takashi Takajo and Haruhiko Ōyabu, all of whom were born in 1935.

Kono&#x27;s 1969 mystery novel &quot;Others&#x27; Castle&quot; was a finalist for the prestigious Naoki Prize, as was his 1974 book &quot;Group of Painting Knives&quot;.

In addition to writing mysteries, Kono also began writing science fiction and fantasy stories after meeting Masami Fukushima, the editor of &quot;SF Magazine&quot;. He became a prominent science fiction writer known for stories that mixed mysterious imagery from both nature and civilization. Among such works are his two collections of &quot;city naturalist&quot; short stories set in a surrealistic suburban landscape.

Kono&#x27;s 1974 city naturalist story &quot;Triceratops&quot; (&quot;トリケラトプス&quot;) is his work most frequently translated into English. The story was first published in English in the August 1982 issue of OMNI. The story is about a &quot;normal, middle-class Japanese father and son who live in a subdivision normal in every way but one: the fabric of time is torn just enough to allow them to see dinosaurs in the streets.&quot; The story has since been reprinted in &quot;The Best Japanese Science Fiction Stories&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Omni Book of Science Fiction&quot;, and &quot;The World Treasury of Science Fiction&quot;.

His story &quot;Hikari,&quot; originally published in 1976 in &quot;Shukan Shosetsu&quot;, was translated and printed in the 2007 anthology &quot;Speculative Japan: Outstanding Tales of Japanese Science Fiction and Fantasy&quot;. The story focuses on a narrator riding a train at night who seeing a distant city of shining light and then learns about the people who live there. In a review in &quot;Strange Horizons&quot;, &quot;Hikari&quot; was described by Niall Harrison as &quot;an odd but haunting story, deeply sceptical of transcendence.&quot;

Kono&#x27;s city naturalist series has been described as &quot;delicately evocative&quot; and &quot;among the best of any Japanese SF writer,&quot; with the stories in the series compared to the works of Ray Bradbury. Kono&#x27;s writings have also been compared to both Jorge Luis Borges and the early works of J. G. Ballard.

<doc id="1022166" wikidata="Q7824731" url="?curid=1022166" title="Top-six play-offs">
<text>After a top-five play-off system was used, a play-off structure involving the top six teams was used to determine the winners of the Super League competition in British rugby league from 2002 through to 2008.

Apart from the grand final, all matches were staged at the home ground of the team placed higher in the final league table. A similar system was used by the Australian National Soccer League. The A-League uses the same system to determine its champions, but with a subtle difference outlined below.

From week two on, the top-six play-offs system reflects exactly the Page playoff system.

With the expansion of Super League from 12 teams to 14 for 2009, the number of teams making the play-offs increased from 6 to 8. For details of the new system, see Super League play-offs.

==How it worked==
Week one
* Elimination semi-final A: 3rd vs 6th
* Elimination semi-final B: 4th vs 5th

Week two
* Qualification final: 1st vs 2nd
* Elimination final: winners of elimination semi-final A vs winners of elimination semi-final B

Week three
* Preliminary final: losers of qualification match vs winners of elimination final

Week Four
* Grand final: winners of Qualification Match vs winners of Final Qualifier

==The A-League system==
(System used in season 2009/10, 2010/11,2011/12)
Week one
* Major semi-final leg 1: 2nd vs 1st
* Elimination semi-final A: 3rd vs 6th
* Elimination semi-final B: 4th vs 5th

Week two
* Major semi-final leg 2: 1st vs 2nd
* Minor semi-final : elimination semi-final A winner vs elimination semi-final B winner

Week three
* Preliminary final: loser of major semi-final vs winner of minor semi-final

Week four
* Grand final: winner of major semi-final vs winner of preliminary final
(System used after season 2012/13, which is also adopted to World Curling Championships since 2018):
Week one
* Elimination final A: 3rd vs 6th
* Elimination final B: 4th vs 5th

Week two
* semi-final A: higher ranked elimination final winner vs 2nd
* semi-final B: lower ranked elimination final winner vs 1st

Week three
* Grand final: higher ranked semifinal winner vs lower ranked semifinal winner

==Competitions==
In addition to the Super League, the top-six system is also used in the Championship and the Championship One, as well Rugby League Conference National. A modified method was used in the 2018 Australian domestic limited-overs cricket tournament.

<doc id="1022169" wikidata="Q458633" url="?curid=1022169" title="Miguel Pro">
<text>José Ramón Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez, also known as Blessed Miguel Pro, SJ (January 13, 1891 – November 23, 1927) was a Mexican Jesuit priest executed under the presidency of Plutarco Elías Calles on the false charges of bombing and attempted assassination of former Mexican President Álvaro Obregón.

Pro&#x27;s arrest, without a trial or evidential support, gained prominence during the Cristero War. Known for his religious piety and innocence, he was beatified in Rome on September 25, 1988, by Pope John Paul II as a Catholic martyr, killed &quot;in odium fidei&quot; (&quot;in hatred of the faith&quot;).

==Historical background==
At the time of Pro&#x27;s death, Mexico was ruled by fiercely anti-clerical and anti-Catholic President Plutarco Elías Calles who had begun what writer Graham Greene called the &quot;fiercest persecution of religion anywhere since the reign of Elizabeth.&quot;

==Childhood==
Miguel Pro, whose full name was José Ramón Miguel Agustín, was born into a mining family on January 13, 1891, in Guadalupe, Zacatecas. He was the third of eleven children, four of whom had died as infants or young children. From a young age, he was called &quot;Cocol&quot; as a nickname. Two of his sisters joined a convent. He entered the Jesuit novitiate at El Llano on August 15, 1911.

==Jesuit life in Mexico, persecution, exile abroad, and ordination==
One of his companions, Pulido, said that he &quot;had never seen such an exquisite wit, never coarse, always sparkling.&quot; He was noted for his charity and ability to speak about spiritual subjects without boring his audience. Pulido remarked that there were two Pros: the playful Pro and the prayerful Pro. He was known for the long periods he spent in the chapel.

Long-time President of Mexico Porfirio Díaz was ousted in 1911 after staging a rigged reelection, and a struggle for power – the Mexican Revolution – began.

Pro studied in Mexico until 1914 when a massive wave of governmental anti-Catholicism forced the novitiate to dissolve and the Jesuits to flee to Los Gatos, California, in the United States. He then went to study in Granada, Spain (1915–19), and from 1919 to 1922 taught in Nicaragua.

Back in Mexico, a new constitution for the country had been signed (1917). Five articles of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico were particularly aimed at suppression of the Catholic Church. Article 3 mandated secular education in schools, prohibiting the Church from participating in primary and secondary education. Article 5 outlawed monastic religious orders. Article 24 forbade public worship outside of church buildings, while Article 27 restricted religious organizations&#x27; rights to own property. Finally, Article 130 revoked basic civil rights of clergy members: priests and religious workers were prevented from wearing their habits, were denied the right to vote, and were forbidden from commenting on public affairs to the press. Most of the anti-clerical provisions of the constitution were removed in 1998.

For his theological studies Pro was sent to Enghien, Belgium, where the French Jesuits (also in exile) had their faculty of Theology. His health continued to deteriorate. There he was ordained a priest on August 31, 1925. He wrote on that occasion: &quot;How can I explain to you the sweet grace of the Holy Spirit, which invades my poor miner&#x27;s soul with such heavenly joys? I could not hold back the tears on the day of my ordination, above all at the moment when I pronounced, together with the bishop, the words of the consecration. After the ceremony the new priests gave their first blessing to their parents. I went to my room, laid out all the photographs of my family on the table, and then blessed them from the bottom of my heart.&quot;

His first assignment as a priest was to work with the miners of Charleroi, Belgium. Despite the socialist, communist, and anarchist tendencies of the workers, he was able to win them over and preach the Gospel to them.

Three months after ordination, he was forced to undergo several operations for ulcers. He remained cheerful and courageous, explaining that the source of his strength was his prayer.

==Return to Mexico==
In summer 1926 – his studies in Europe completed – Pro returned to Mexico. On the way he visited Lourdes where he celebrated Mass and visited the grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes.

Pro arrived at Veracruz on July 8, 1926. Plutarco Elías Calles was now president of Mexico. Unlike his predecessors, Calles vigorously enforced the anti-Catholic provisions of the 1917 constitution, implementing the so-called Calles Law, which provided specific penalties for priests who criticized the government (five years&#x27; imprisonment) or wore clerical garb in certain situations outside their churches (500 pesos). This law went into effect on July 31, 1926.

By this time, some states, such as Tabasco under the notorious anti-Catholic Tomás Garrido Canabal, had closed all the churches and cleared the entire state of openly serving priests, killing many of them, forcing a few to marry, the remaining few serving covertly at risk of their lives. On his return Pro served a Church which was forced to go &quot;underground&quot;. He celebrated the Eucharist clandestinely and ministered the other sacraments to small groups of Catholics.

Details of Pro&#x27;s ministry in the underground church come from his many letters, signed with the nickname &quot;Cocol&quot;. In October 1926, a warrant for his arrest was issued. He was arrested and released from prison the next day, but kept under surveillance.

==Arrest and execution==
A failed attempt to assassinate Álvaro Obregón, which only wounded him, in November 1927, provided the state with a pretext for arresting Pro again, this time with his brothers Humberto and Roberto. A young engineer who confessed his part in the attempted assassination testified that the Pro brothers were not involved. Miguel and his brothers were taken to the Detective Inspector&#x27;s Office in Mexico City.

On November 23, 1927, Pro was executed without trial. President Calles gave orders to have Pro executed for the assassination attempt. Calles had the execution meticulously photographed, and the newspapers throughout the country carried photos on the front page the following day. Presumably, Calles thought that the sight of the pictures would frighten the Cristero rebels who were fighting against his troops, particularly in the state of Jalisco. However, they had the opposite effect. 

Pro and his brothers were visited by Generals Roberto Cruz and Palomera Lopez around 11 p.m. on November 22, 1927. The next day, as Pro walked from his cell to the courtyard and the firing squad, he blessed the soldiers, knelt, and briefly prayed quietly. Declining a blindfold, he faced his executioners with a crucifix in one hand and a rosary in the other and held his arms out in imitation of the crucified Christ and shouted out, &quot;May God have mercy on you! May God bless you! Lord, Thou knowest that I am innocent! With all my heart I forgive my enemies!&quot; Before the firing squad was ordered to shoot, Pro raised his arms in imitation of Christ and shouted the defiant cry of the Cristeros, &quot;¡Viva Cristo Rey!&quot; – &quot;Long live Christ the King!&quot;. When the initial shots of the firing squad failed to kill him, a soldier shot him at point-blank range.

Calles is reported to have looked down upon a throng of 40,000 which lined Pro&#x27;s funeral procession. Another 20,000 waited at the cemetery where he was buried without a priest present, his father saying the final words. The Cristeros became more animated and fought with renewed enthusiasm, many of them carrying the newspaper photo of Pro before the firing squad.

==Beatification==
Pro&#x27;s spiritual writings were approved by theologians on 1 June 1947, and his cause was formally opened on 11 January 1952, granting him the title of Servant of God.

At Pro&#x27;s beatification in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square on September 25, 1988, Pope John Paul II said:

<doc id="1022176" wikidata="Q7824657" url="?curid=1022176" title="Top-five play-offs">
<text>A play-off structure involving the top five teams is used to determine the winners of the Super League competition in British rugby league. Apart from the grand final, all matches are staged at the home ground of the team placed higher in the final league table.

The same system was used in the NSWRL&#x27;s Sydney Competition 1973–1994, the Super League in its only season 1997, the VFL, 1972–1990 and New Zealand&#x27;s Lion Red Cup, 1994–1996, and Bartercard Cup, 2000–2006.

From week two on the top-five play-offs system reflects exactly the Page playoff system.

==Procedure==
Week one

* Qualification final: 2nd vs 3rd
* Elimination final: 4th vs 5th
* Bye: 1st

Week two

* Major semi-final: 1st vs winners of qualification final
* Minor semi-final: losers of qualification final vs winners of elimination final

Week three

* Preliminary final: losers of major semi-final vs winners of minor semi-final
* Bye: winners of major semi-final

Week four

* Grand final: winners of major semi-final vs winners of preliminary final

This is considered a good playoff system, as while it allows fifth place to take part, it is incredibly difficult for fourth and them to be crowned champions as they must beat every other team at some point.

The only NSWRL team to win the premiership from 5th was Brisbane in 1993.

In elite Australian Rules Football, only twice have the premiers won from fifth – Norwood in 1984 and North Adelaide in 2018. No AFL/VFL team won from fifth under this format (1972–1990), and no WAFL team has won under this format as of 2021.

If all matches have the same odds to win, then seed 1 has 37.5% to be champion; seed 2 and 3 have 25% to be champion; seed 4 and 5 have 6.25%;

Seed 1 has two chances to reach the final, and only needs to win 1 match to clinch it. It is only eliminated before the final if loses against both finalists, and doesn´t win any match.

Seed 2 and 3 need to win 2 out of 3 matches to reach the final (they are like in a best-of-3 semi-final, but with different opponents in any round).

Seed 4 and 5 need to win all other 4 opponents without loss to be crowned. Any loss means its elimination.

==Example==
The 1994 NSWRL finals occurred as follows:

<text>The Louisville metropolitan area is the 43rd largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the United States. It had a population of 1,395,855 in 2020 according to the latest official census, and its principal city is Louisville, Kentucky.

The metropolitan area was originally formed by the United States Census Bureau in 1950 and consisted of the Kentucky county of Jefferson and the Indiana counties of Clark and Floyd. As surrounding counties saw an increase in their population densities and the number of their residents employed within Jefferson County, they met Census criteria to be added to the MSA. Jefferson County, Kentucky, plus eleven outlying countiesseven in Kentucky and four in Southern Indianaare now a part of this MSA. Two other counties, one each in Kentucky and Indiana, were part of the MSA in the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Censuses, but were spun off by the Census Bureau into their own Micropolitan Statistical Areas (μSA) in 2013 and 2018 respectively.

The formal name given to the area by the Census Bureau is the Louisville/Jefferson County, Kentucky–Indiana, metropolitan statistical area, though it is regularly referred to as Kentuckiana. It is now the primary MSA of the Louisville/Jefferson County–Elizabethtown, KY-IN Combined Statistical Area, as defined by the United States Bureau of the Census in 2000 and recently redefined in 2018. The combined statistical area (CSA) adds the counties of Hardin County, Kentucky, and LaRue County, Kentucky. In 2020, the Census Bureau measured the combined statistical area&#x27;s population at 1,601,309.

Before the 2023 definitions were released, the CSA had two additional micropolitan statistical areas, Bardstown, Kentucky μSA and Scottsburg, Indiana μSA. In 2023, the Bardstown μSA was dissolved with Nelson County being added to the Louisville MSA and Scottsburg, Indiana μSA was dissolved, no longer considered a statistical area by the OMB. In addition, Meade County, which was part of the Elizabethtown MSA, was detached and added to the Louisville MSA. Trimble County, on the northeastern edge of the Louisville MSA, was detached in 2023.

==Definitions==
, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines the Louisville–Jefferson County MSA as including Bullitt, Henry, Jefferson, Meade, Nelson, Oldham, and Shelby Counties in Kentucky and Clark, Floyd, Harrison, and Washington Counties in Indiana. The larger Louisville/Jefferson County–Elizabethtown CSA adds the Elizabethtown, Kentucky, MSA, consisting of Hardin and LaRue Counties.

In 2003, the Jefferson County government merged with that of its largest city and county seat, Louisville, forming a new entity, the Louisville–Jefferson County Metro Government (official long form) or Louisville Metro (official short form). All small cities within Jefferson County became part of the new Louisville Metro government while retaining their city governments. For statistical and ranking purposes, the United States Census Bureau uses the statistical entity Louisville–Jefferson County metro government (balance), Kentucky, to represent the portion of the consolidated city-county of Louisville–Jefferson County that does not include any of the 83 separate incorporated places (municipalities) located within the city and county.

<doc id="1022185" wikidata="Q789352" url="?curid=1022185" title="Baldwin effect">
<text>In evolutionary biology, the Baldwin effect describes an effect of learned behaviour on evolution. James Mark Baldwin and others suggested that an organism&#x27;s &quot;ability to learn&quot; new behaviours (e.g. to acclimatise to a new stressor) will affect its reproductive success and will therefore have an effect on the genetic makeup of its species through natural selection. It posits that subsequent selection might reinforce the originally learned behaviors, if adaptive, into more in-born, instinctive ones. Though this process appears similar to Lamarckism, that view proposes that living things &quot;inherited&quot; their parents&#x27; acquired characteristics. The Baldwin effect only posits that learning ability, which is genetically based, is another variable in / contributor to environmental adaptation. First proposed during the Eclipse of Darwinism in the late 19th century, this effect has been independently proposed several times, and today it is generally recognized as part of the modern synthesis.

==&quot;A New Factor in Evolution&quot;==

The effect, then unnamed, was put forward in 1896 in a paper &quot;A New Factor in Evolution&quot; by the American psychologist James Mark Baldwin, with a second paper in 1897. The paper proposed a mechanism for specific selection for general learning ability. As the historian of science Robert Richards explains:

Selected offspring would tend to have an increased capacity for learning new skills rather than being confined to genetically coded, relatively fixed abilities. In effect, it places emphasis on the fact that the sustained behaviour of a species or group can shape the evolution of that species. The &quot;Baldwin effect&quot; is better understood in evolutionary developmental biology literature as a scenario in which a character or trait change occurring in an organism as a result of its interaction with its environment becomes gradually assimilated into its developmental genetic or epigenetic repertoire. In the words of the philosopher of science Daniel Dennett:

An update to the Baldwin effect was developed by Jean Piaget, Paul Weiss, and Conrad Waddington in the 1960s–1970s. This new version included an explicit role for the social in shaping subsequent natural change in humans (both evolutionary and developmental), with reference to alterations of selection pressures.

Subsequent research shows that Baldwin was not the first to identify the process; Douglas Spalding mentioned it in 1873.

==Controversy and acceptance==

Initially Baldwin&#x27;s ideas were not incompatible with the prevailing, but uncertain, ideas about the mechanism of transmission of hereditary information and at least two other biologists put forward very similar ideas in 1896. In 1901, Maurice Maeterlinck referred to behavioural adaptations to prevailing climates in different species of bees as &quot;what had merely been an idea, therefore, and opposed to instinct, has thus by slow degrees become an instinctive habit&quot;. The Baldwin effect theory subsequently became more controversial, with scholars divided between &quot;Baldwin boosters&quot; and &quot;Baldwin skeptics&quot;. The theory was first called the &quot;Baldwin effect&quot; by George Gaylord Simpson in 1953. Simpson &quot;admitted that the idea was theoretically consistent, that is, not inconsistent with the modern synthesis&quot;, but he doubted that the phenomenon occurred very often, or if so, could be proven to occur. In his discussion of the reception of the Baldwin-effect theory Simpson points out that the theory appears to provide a reconciliation between a neo-Darwinian and a neo-Lamarckian approach and that &quot;Mendelism and later genetic theory so conclusively ruled out the extreme neo-Lamarckian position that reconciliation came to seem unnecessary&quot;. In 1942, the evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley promoted the Baldwin effect as part of the modern synthesis, saying the concept had been unduly neglected by evolutionists.

In the 1960s, the evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr contended that the Baldwin effect theory was untenable because
# the argument is stated in terms of the individual genotype, whereas what is really exposed to the selection pressure is a phenotypically and genetically variable population;
# it is not sufficiently emphasized that the degree of modification of the phenotype is in itself genetically controlled;
# it is assumed that phenotypic rigidity is selectively superior to phenotypic flexibility.

In 1987 Geoffrey Hinton and Steven Nowlan demonstrated by computer simulation that learning can accelerate evolution, and they associated this with the Baldwin effect.

Paul Griffiths suggests two reasons for the continuing interest in the Baldwin effect. The first is the role &quot;mind&quot; is understood to play in the effect. The second is the connection between &quot;development&quot; and evolution in the effect. Baldwin&#x27;s account of how neurophysiological and conscious mental factors may contribute to the effect brings into focus the question of the possible survival value of consciousness.

Still, David Depew observed in 2003, &quot;it is striking that a rather diverse lot of contemporary evolutionary theorists, most of whom regard themselves as supporters of the Modern Synthesis, have of late become &#x27;Baldwin boosters&#x27;&quot;. These

According to Dennett, also in 2003, recent work has rendered the Baldwin effect &quot;no longer a controversial wrinkle in orthodox Darwinism&quot;. Potential genetic mechanisms underlying the Baldwin effect have been proposed for the evolution of natural (genetically determinant) antibodies. In 2009, empirical evidence for the Baldwin effect was provided from the colonisation of North America by the house finch.

The Baldwin effect has been incorporated into the extended evolutionary synthesis.

==Comparison with genetic assimilation==
The Baldwin effect has been confused with, and sometimes conflated with, a different evolutionary theory also based on phenotypic plasticity, C. H. Waddington&#x27;s genetic assimilation. The Baldwin effect includes genetic accommodation, of which one type is genetic assimilation. Science historian Laurent Loison has written that &quot;the Baldwin effect and genetic assimilation, even if they are quite close, should not be conflated&quot;.

<text>Christopher Andrew &quot;Christy&quot; Moore (born 7 May 1945) is an Irish folk singer, songwriter and guitarist. In addition to his significant success as a solo artist, he is one of the founding members of the bands Planxty and Moving Hearts. His first album, &quot;Paddy&quot; &quot;on the Road&quot; was recorded with Dominic Behan in 1969. In 2007, he was named as Ireland&#x27;s greatest living musician in RTÉ&#x27;s People of the Year Awards.

== Early life ==
Moore was born in Newbridge, County Kildare, Ireland and attended Newbridge College. His mother Nancy Moore was a Fine Gael election candidate. He was originally a bank employee who wanted to express himself using traditional music. During a bank strike in 1966, which lasted twelve weeks, he went to England, as many striking officials did, but didn&#x27;t return when the strike was settled. &quot;I had a wild and wonderful time in England, with no bank manager looking over my shoulder,&quot; he said. Doing general labouring work, he frequented the folk clubs and the Irish music pubs where he met Seamus Ennis, Margaret Barry, Luke Kelly, Martin Byrnes and many other traditional musicians. When Irish singing trio The Grehan Sisters, with whom Moore was previously acquainted, moved to the north of England from Dublin in 1967, they assisted Moore to get a higher profile by giving him contacts and support slots on their concerts.

== Musical career ==
1973 brought his first major release, &quot;Prosperous&quot;, which brought together the four musicians who shortly thereafter formed Planxty: Liam O&#x27;Flynn, Andy Irvine and Dónal Lunny. For a time they called themselves &quot;CLAD&quot;, an acronym of their names, but soon decided on Planxty.

After leaving Planxty in 1975, Moore continued on his solo career, reforming his old band on occasion (which he has been doing ever since). He also formed the band Moving Hearts with Lunny and five other musicians in 1980. In 1987 he appeared on Gay Byrne&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; performing with The Dubliners for their 25th anniversary. In 2000, he published his autobiography, &quot;One Voice&quot;.

Moore&#x27;s earlier lifestyle resulted in a decline in health and several operations. Moore&#x27;s battle with alcohol, and subsequent heart operations, have taken their toll. At the end of the 1990s, Moore reduced his workload for medical reasons.

Some of Moore&#x27;s songs are heavily influenced by drink and the effects of drink, his song &quot;Delirium Tremens&quot; being a good example. Listening to Johnny Mulhern&#x27;s song &quot;Hard Cases&quot; caused Moore to recall the Galway drinking scene with local musicians Mickey Finn, Pete Galligan, Corky and Terry Smith.

On 17 April 2009, Moore released his first new studio album in four years, entitled &quot;Listen&quot;, and promoted it through a series of live gigs.

In December 2011, Moore released the album &quot;Folk Tale&quot;. His next album &quot;Where I Come From&quot; was released in November 2013 and features a new protest song called &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Day&quot;. The album peaked at number three in the Irish album charts. &quot;On the road&quot; was released in November 2017, &quot;Magic Nights&quot; was released in November 2019, and his most recent album &quot;A Terrible Beauty&quot;, was released in November 2024.

== Political and social commentary ==

Moore is best known for his political and social commentary which reflects a left-wing, Irish republican perspective, despite the fact that his mother was a Fine Gael county councillor and parliamentary candidate in Kildare. He supported the republican H-Block protestors with the albums &quot;H-Block&quot; in 1978, the launch of which was raided by the police, and &quot;The Spirit of Freedom&quot;. He has also recorded songs by the hunger striker Bobby Sands, including &quot;Back Home in Derry&quot; which is based on Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s song &quot;The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. He ceased supporting the military activities of the IRA in 1987 as a result of the Enniskillen bombing.

Political songs he has performed throughout his career include Mick Hanly&#x27;s &quot;On the Blanket&quot; about the protests of republican prisoners, &quot;Viva la Quinta Brigada&quot;, about the Irishmen who fought in the Spanish Civil War against Franco, and &quot;Minds Locked Shut&quot; about Bloody Sunday in Derry.

Moore has endorsed a long list of leftist causes, ranging from El Salvador to Mary Robinson in the 1990 presidential election. He has incorporated songs about Salvador Allende (&#x27;Allende&#x27;) and Ronald Reagan (&#x27;Ronnie Reagon&#x27;) into his repertoire.

At the Glastonbury Festival in 2005, he sang about the Palestinian solidarity activist Rachel Corrie, whom he also dedicated his album of the same year to, Burning Times. He supported the anti-nuclear movement in Ireland playing in many concerts and at festivals in Carnsore Point for the cause.

== Banned song ==
&quot;They Never Came Home&quot; is a song about the Stardust fire of 1981 where 48 people died. The song was recorded on the &quot;Ordinary Man&quot; album and was released on the B-side of a single in 1985. The song achieved notoriety when Moore was taken to court over claims in the song prejudicial to an ongoing court case determining compensation. For instance, the song claimed, &quot;hundreds of children are injured and maimed, and all just because the fire exits were chained&quot;. Mr Justice Murphy ordered the &quot;Ordinary Man&quot; album to be withdrawn from the shops, and costs were awarded against Moore. &quot;Another Song Is Born&quot; was recorded for the album&#x27;s re-release. &quot;They Never Came Home&quot; later appeared on his box set and on the album &quot;Where I Come From&quot;.

In 2024, the jury at the Stardust tribunal found that one exit was locked at the time of the fire and blocked from the outside by a parked van, another exit was unlocked but had chains tied across the panic bar which gave the impression of it being locked to those inside, another exit was partially blocked by a portable stage, and one exit had been locked but was unlocked by a bouncer after the fire alarm went off who then wedged the door open with a doormat. This doormat became dislodged and the doors closed over and had to be forced open from the inside.

== Musical style ==
His solo style includes driving rhythms on guitar and bodhrán as well as slower ballads.

== Family ==
Moore&#x27;s brother Barry, whose stage name is Luka Bloom, is also a singer-songwriter. His nephew, Conor Byrne, is also a traditional flautist and tin whistle player, with Christy appearing on his &quot;Wind Dancer&quot; album.

== Memorable events ==
=== Detention incident, 2004 ===
In October 2004, Moore was stopped and detained by Special Branch officers at the Welsh port of Holyhead, taken into an office and questioned about the lyrics of his songs. The following day, he released a statement saying: &quot;My driver and I were stopped and held for two hours at Holyhead last Monday, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2002. My driver and I were held separately in two interrogation rooms. I found the whole experience threatening. I was questioned about the contents of my briefcase.&quot; Despite initial reports to the contrary, the singer&#x27;s van, which was full of musical equipment, was not searched. &quot;I was questioned about lyrics of songs and I was asked a lot of personal questions about members of my family and my children and about my home. At no time was I given any explanation as to why I was being held and interrogated in this manner&quot;, he added. He said the fact that Irish people are still being treated this way on their way to Britain is very &quot;saddening&quot;. &quot;I had hoped to deal with this matter out of the public domain. But seeing as it has become a news item, I feel the need to offer my side of the story. I found the whole affair quite frightening.&quot;

=== Penguin book of Irish poetry ===
In 2010, Christy Moore&#x27;s song &quot;Lisdoonvarna&quot;, which he wrote, gained entry in &quot;The Penguin Book of Irish Poetry&quot;.

<text>The Nokia 3310 is a discontinued GSM mobile phone announced on 1 September 2000, and released in the fourth quarter of the year, replacing the popular Nokia 3210. It sold very well, being one of the most successful phones, with 126 million units sold worldwide, and being one of Nokia&#x27;s most iconic devices. The phone is still widely acclaimed and has gained a cult status due to its reputation for durability.

Several variants of the 3310 have been released, including the Nokia 3315, 3320, 3330, 3350, 3360, 3390 and 3395.

The Nokia 3310 was produced at factories in Finland and Hungary. The 3315s were produced in South Korea for the Asia-Pacific market.

A new mobile phone based on the 3310 design was launched in 2017. The new Nokia 3310 model comes with a comprehensive update over its predecessor, with a 2.4&quot; color display, a 2 Megapixel rear camera and a microSD slot.

==Design==


The 3310 was developed at the Copenhagen Nokia site in Denmark and unveiled at the &quot;Don&#x27;t be bored. Be totally board.&quot; lifestyle event in Oberhausen, Germany, as well as &quot;Nokia Unplugged&quot; concerts in the Asia-Pacific region. It is a compact and sturdy phone featuring an 84 × 48 pixel pure monochrome display. It has a lighter removable battery variant which has fewer features; for example the 133 g (4.6 oz) battery version has a start-up image of two hands touching while the version does not. It is a slightly rounded rectangular unit that is typically held in the palm of a hand, with the buttons operated with the thumb. The blue button is the main button for selecting options, with &quot;C&quot; button as a &quot;backspace&quot;, &quot;back&quot; or &quot;undo&quot; button. Up and down buttons are used for navigation purposes. The on/off/profile button is a stiff black button located on the top of the phone. Like its predecessor Nokia 3210, the 3310 was marketed as a customizable consumer-oriented handset targeting the youth. It is about a centimeter shorter than the 3210.

The 3310 has durable casing and construction, which is often humorously exaggerated in online communities. Numerous videos exist of the phone being put through increasingly-severe tests of the phone&#x27;s strength, including being dropped from a great height (sometimes protected by makeshift cases made from various objects), being crushed by heavy objects or being struck by vehicles or hammers. The 3310&#x27;s reputation for durability led HMD Global to develop the Nokia 800 Tough with MIL-STD-810G standard compliance in mind.

==Features==
The Nokia 3310&#x27;s main new feature introduced over its predecessors was a Chat function. This is an instant messaging-like feature that works on standard SMS. The 3310 was popular for SMS text messaging because of Chat and also because it allowed long messages three times the size of a standard SMS text message, at 459 characters. It also featured threaded SMS writing and voice dialing for the quick dialing of selected numbers.

The 3310 is known for having many features that were rare for the time. These include many utilities, such as a calculator, Nokia network monitor, stop watch and a reminder function. It has four games: &quot;Pairs II&quot;, &quot;Space Impact&quot;, &quot;Bantumi&quot;, and the hugely popular &quot;Snake II&quot;. The &quot;Snake&quot; series of games has been popular on Nokia handsets since the late 1990s. &quot;CNET&quot; remembered &quot;Space Impact&quot;, a shoot &#x27;em up in which the player fires projectiles at oncoming aliens, as a mediocre game overall but impressive for fitting a mobile device with its complexity and length. It was later recreated for other mobile devices.

The Nokia 3310 runs on Nokia&#x27;s proprietary Series 20 software.

The Nokia 3310 uses a MiniSIM (more commonly known as a standard SIM).

==Customization==
The Nokia 3310 can be customized with interchangeable &quot;Xpress-On&quot; covers, and thousands of different designs have been produced by various companies. It also has over 35 ringtones built-in with space for seven custom tones. These can either be downloaded, or composed by the user on the handset. The phone has various &quot;profiles&quot; that can set several preferences such as silent mode where the phone will not ring, useful for situations where it is inappropriate to do so. Screensavers can be made from received picture messages.

==Variants==
===3315, 3390 and 3395===

An enhanced version of the 3310 is the Nokia 3315, which has some additional features:
* A picture editor to edit pictures for use in SMS Picture messaging and screensavers on the phone
* Timed profiles
* Could use self-made and received ringtones as SMS tones
* Fixed some of the bugs found in the 3310
* Automatic keypad locking after a specified time
* Accidental emergency calls are not possible because keyguard is always &quot;on&quot;
* Peanut-like interconnected silicon key mat
3315s sold in Singapore and Malaysia had a blue backlight for the LCD screen and keypad, as opposed to green in other markets.

The 3315 was also released in Australia. Most versions of the 3310 could be upgraded to include the additional features of the 3315 by using a data cable.

There are two North American variants of the 3310; one is the Nokia 3390, which operates on GSM 1900. The Nokia 3395 is an updated version of the 3390, which includes the additional features of the Asian 3315 model, and it has poor reception if connected to a GSM 850 area.

===WAP-enhanced models (3330 and 3350)===

The Nokia 3330 added a CSD-based WAP capability, animated Screensavers, a pinball game named &quot;Bumper&quot;, and phonebook (stored in the phone memory as opposed to the SIM card in earlier models) with a 100-entry capacity to the model. It also has the capability of downloading additional game content via WAP (such as &quot;Snake II&quot; mazes, &quot;Bumper&quot; tables, and &quot;Space Impact&quot; chapters).

An Asia-Pacific only version, known as the Nokia 3350, was, in essence, an improved 3330 with WAP, rhythmic backlight alert, animated Screensavers, two-way Navi-Key, dedicated call and hang buttons, Chinese lunar calendar, and a 96-by-65-pixel screen. Some 3350s have back covers that feature a photo-insert window, allowing users to put personal pictures from photographs, magazine cut-outs, etc.

===AMPS/D-AMPS-based versions (3320 and 3360)===
The Nokia 3360 and 3320 are related models designed for the U.S. and Canadian markets, respectively. They are externally similar to the 3310 and 3390, but they use Digital AMPS (&quot;TDMA&quot;)/AMPS technology rather than GSM.

Like the Asian 3350, they include two dedicated call and hang buttons and two soft keys. They also feature an infrared port. Unlike the 3390, the 3360 and 3320 do not support voice dialing. At 136 grams each, they are also slightly heavier than the 3390, which weighs 119 grams.

==Legacy==

The Nokia 3310 has a reputation of great durability, and many Internet memes have been made calling the phone &quot;indestructible&quot; or &quot;the Nokia Brick&quot; and praising its durability compared to modern smartphones. In a retrospective piece, TechRepublic called the Nokia 3310 &quot;a big tough cockroach of a phone&quot; and praised its &quot;legendary durability&quot;.

In November 2015, the Nokia 3310 was chosen as one of the first three &quot;National Emojis&quot; for Finland. The emoji is referred to as &quot;The Unbreakable&quot;, as the phone was known for its aforementioned toughness and durability.

==Revival==

On 14 February 2017, it was reported that a revived version of the 3310 would be unveiled at the 2017 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona by HMD Global Oy, the Finnish manufacturer with rights to market phones under the Nokia brand, forecasting a price point of €49. On 26 February 2017, the modernized version of the 3310 was launched at a price of €49.

<text>The Windsor Bridge or Windsor Town Bridge, an iron and granite arch bridge over the River Thames, connects the towns of Windsor and Eton in the English county of Berkshire. The Thames Path crosses the river here. The bridge carries pedestrian and cycle traffic, and crosses the Thames just above Romney Lock. It is a Grade II listed structure.

==History==

It is likely that the first bridge on this site was built in the 12th century AD. By 1172 it is recorded that Osbert de Bray derived over £4 from tolls levied on vessels passing beneath the bridge. In 1242, permission was granted for oak trees to be felled in Windsor Forest for the purpose of constructing a new bridge between Windsor and Eton. By 1819 the wooden bridge, presumably rebuilt many times over its life, had deteriorated and it was decided to build a new bridge in new materials.

==Description==

Construction on the current bridge was started in 1822 and it opened on 1 June 1824. The bridge has three arches, each comprising seven cast iron segments, and is supported in mid-stream by two granite piers.

Built as a road bridge, tolls were originally levied on traffic crossing the bridge. Following protests and a court case, &quot;The Mayor &amp;c. of New Windsor and ano. v Joseph Taylor&quot;, which went to the highest court at the time, these tolls were scrapped in 1897. In the 20th century the bridge carried the A332, the busy main road between Slough and Windsor.

In 1970, cracks were discovered in some of the cast iron segments, and despite local protests, but with almost equal support, it was decided to close the bridge to all motorised traffic. All such traffic between Windsor and Eton must now travel via the Queen Elizabeth Bridge on the Royal Windsor Way (formerly the Windsor and Eton relief road) to the west. For those approaching from Old Windsor or Runnymede, the Albert Bridge provides an alternative route via Datchet&#x27;s High Street.

In 2002 the bridge was refurbished, with repairs to the structure and new parapets including integral lighting. The bridge deck was replaced using Yorkstone and seating areas provided. The bridge remains in use by pedestrians and cyclists only; it provides an excellent walking route from central Windsor to Eton&#x27;s High Street, and a good viewing spot for both the river and Windsor Castle.

===Proximity to railway stations===

About east of the bridge is Windsor &amp; Eton Riverside railway station, served by South Western Railway trains to London Waterloo, while Windsor &amp; Eton Central railway station, up the hill to the south-west, is served by Great Western Railway trains to Slough for connecting services to London Paddington.

<doc id="1022197" wikidata="Q335522" url="?curid=1022197" title="Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons">
<text>Admiral Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons, (21 November 179023 November 1858) was an eminent British Admiral of the Royal Navy, and diplomat, who ensured Britain&#x27;s victory in the Crimean War, during which he was Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, by his contribution at the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855) with both the Royal Navy and the British Army.

As a consequence of his &#x27;intelligence and great ability&#x27;, &#x27;quiet humour&#x27;, &#x27;frankness and urbanity&#x27;, and &#x27;vigilance and practical skill&#x27;, Lyons was appointed to ambassadorial positions in Sweden, and in Switzerland, and to the court of King Otto of Greece.

Lyons (whose brother Vice-Admiral John Lyons was on at the Battle of Trafalgar and served as British Ambassador to Egypt) was the father of the diplomat Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons (who was the British Ambassador to the USA who solved the Trent Affair, and who was later British Ambassador to France). Edmund&#x27;s nephews included Admiral of the Fleet Sir Algernon Lyons.
== Family ==

Edmund Lyons was born at Whitehayes House, Burton, near Christchurch, on 21 November 1790. He was the fourth son of Captain John Lyons, an owner of extensive sugar plantations in Antigua, whose British residence was at St. Austen&#x27;s, Lymington, Hampshire, and Catherine (née Walrond), daughter of Maine Swete Walrond, 5th Marquis de Vallado. His brothers included Vice-Admiral John Lyons
(1787–1872), who was on board at the Battle of Trafalgar and who served as British Ambassador in Egypt; Maine Walrond Lyons, (1798–1827), a lieutenant in the Royal Navy who was killed at Battle of Navarino; and Humphrey Lyons (1802–1873), a lieutenant-general in the Indian (Bombay) Army.

His nephews included Admiral of the Fleet Sir Algernon McLennan Lyons (1833–1908), and Richard Lyons Pearson, Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. His godparents were Sir Richard Hussey Bickerton and Lady Bickerton.

== Naval and diplomatic service ==

Lyons first went to sea on board HMS &quot;Terrible&quot; in 1798, when he was eight years old. He then returned to England to attend Hyde Abbey School near Winchester, which he attended until 1803, when he joined the Royal Navy and the crew of the frigate HMS &quot;Active&quot;, with which he remained for four years. He served at the passage of the Dardanelles, under Sir John Duckworth, in February 1807.

He was posted to the West Indies later in 1807 and commissioned as a lieutenant in 1809, as which he participated in the capture of Banda Neira, for which he was mentioned for gallantry and promoted. Lyons then served as a flag-lieutenant, to Rear-Admiral Drury, aboard HMS &quot;Minden&quot; (74 guns). In 1810, he served in the 18-gun sloop notably at the capture, from the Dutch, on 9 August 1810, of Banda Neira in the Moluccas during the Invasion of the Spice Islands: Lyons was involved in the assault on Fort Belgica.

=== Lyons destroys Fort Marrack ===

In 1811, a planned British attack on the fortified port of Fort Marrack, in the Sunda Strait of Batavia, Dutch East Indies, was postponed after the Royal Navy received intelligence that Dutch reinforcements had arrived. Lyons with only 34 men attacked the fort anyway and destroyed its 180-strong garrison and 54 guns. Lyons was on 25 July dispatched to land Dutch prisoners on the island. On his return journey, on 30 July, he decided to launch a surprise midnight attack on the Dutch fort with the 34 men who accompanied him. Lyons stormed and captured the Dutch battery, and dispersed its Dutch garrison of 180 men and two boat-crews, and gunned down the Dutch reinforcements as they arrived, and then dismantled the fort and destroyed its 54 guns with dynamite so that they could not be used on the British Fleet.

This action was praised by the Royal Navy as &#x27;the most outstanding example of individual bravery in the wars which followed the French Revolution&#x27;. Lyons&#x27;s Commander-in-Chief, Commodore Broughton, acknowledged Lyons&#x27;s &#x27;gallantry and zeal&#x27; but criticised Lyons because &#x27;the attack was made contrary to orders&#x27;. but Lyons was nevertheless for this action mentioned in dispatches and proposed for early promotion to the rank of Commander, which he received on 21 March 1812.

=== Marriage and issue ===
After his attack on Marrack, Lyons&#x27;s health deteriorated and he returned to Britain. In 1814, he was promoted to captain and commanded the sloop in the fleet that escorted the French King Louis XVIII and other allied sovereigns from England to France. On 18 July 1814, at Southwick, Hampshire, he married Augusta Louisa (1792–1852), daughter of Captain Josias Rogers of the navy. He was unemployed until 1828, whilst he and his wife had two sons and two daughters:

# Anne Theresa Bickerton Lyons (1815–1894), who married Philip Hartmann Veit von Würtzburg, Baron von Würtzburg, in Bavaria, in 1839.

=== Early Mediterranean service ===

Lieutenant Maine Walrond Lyons, one of Edmund Lyons&#x27;s younger brothers, was killed at the Battle of Navarino in 1827. The Duke of Clarence, who was the heir presumptive to the British throne, subsequently appointed Edmund, in 1828, to command the 46-gun frigate during the end of the Greek War of Independence.

Lyons arrived in Malta on 20 May 1828, when Sir Richard Hussey Bickerton and Admiral Sausages described him, in letters to their Fleet Commander, as &#x27;a man of intelligence and great ability&#x27;. Lyons and his wife rented the most expensive house in Valletta, where they home-schooled their four children in grammar and in Enlightenment philosophy.

On HMS &quot;Blonde&quot;, Lyons was involved in the capture of Kastro Morea in the Peloponnese, for which he was knighted in both France and Greece. The following year, Lyons took the Blonde to become the first British warship to visit Sevastopol, the Caucasus, and Odessa: as a consequence of which 25 years later, Lyons was the only senior officer involved in the Crimean War who had direct knowledge of the Black Sea. In 1831 Lyons was appointed to command of the frigate , which he brought home to England before he sailed it for the Mediterranean in February 1832.

=== Diplomat at Athens, Switzerland, and Sweden ===
In August 1832, Lyons transported the new King Otto of Greece, and the Bavarian Regency, from Brindisi to Nauplia, and then, in 1833, from Trieste to Athens. Lyons left the navy in January 1835, was knighted in the Royal Guelphic Order, and was appointed by Lord Palmerston as the British diplomat at Athens, as which he remained for almost fifteen years, during which he was on 29 July 1840 created baronet, and in July 1844 he was made a Knight Grand Cross in the Civil Division of the Order of the Bath.

In 1849 Lyons was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to the Confederated States of the Swiss Cantons and was on 14 January 1850 promoted to Rear-Admiral of the Blue in the Royal Navy, and was in 1851 appointed minister at Stockholm, at which his wife died.

=== Second-in-command of Mediterranean Fleet ===

In November 1853, with the advocacy of Sir James Graham, Lyons returned to active service in the Royal Navy, and was appointed second in command of the British Mediterranean Fleet, and was granted a pension of £900 per annum for his diplomatic service. Lyons left England for the Dardanelles, as Rear-Admiral of the White, on board the steam frigate HMS &quot;Terrible&quot; on 5 November 1853, before he then took command of his flagship, the new screw-steam ship-of-the-line (91 guns).

== Crimean War: maverick nature and private correspondences ==
=== Sir James Graham ===

Lyons maintained secret private correspondence with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir James Graham, whose plans for an amphibious assault on Sevastopol Lyons advocated at the Allied Counsels of War between July and August 1854, despite the policy his immediate superior, Vice-Admiral Dundas.

Lyons also maintained direct private correspondences with various Cabinet ministers, and published memos to the British public, in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, through its reporters such as John Delane, and Austen Henry Layard, and William Howard Russell, in which he criticised the policies of Admiral Dundas, who disliked Lyons&#x27;s wilful independence. However, Dundas&#x27;s superiors within the Navy preferred Lyons, whom they considered to be the more competent and the more charismatic, and encouraged Lyons&#x27;s independence, by private correspondence and plans, such as those for the assault on Sevastopol, of which officers between Sir James Graham and Lyons in rank, such as Dundas, were not aware.

Both the English Fleet and the French Fleet zealously commended Lyons&#x27;s &#x27;skill and boldness&#x27; during the Crimean War. Lyons&#x27;s white-blonde hair became identified with his maverick temerity. Lyons&#x27;s hair was similar to the hair of Nelson, whom Lyons idolized. However, Lyons did not possess the strategic intelligence of Nelson and attained his victories, such as the destruction of Fort Marrack (see above) and the attack on Sevastopol (see below), by temerity rather than by meticulous planning. Lyons disliked paperwork: when Admiral Dundas ordered him to organize transports for the invasion of the Crimea, Lyons immediately employed a subordinate, his flag captain William Mends, to do it for him.

=== Lord Raglan and the army ===

Furthermore, Lyons&#x27;s charisma made him a favourite of the Army General Lord Raglan, with whom he maintained another private correspondence. The friendship between Lyons and Raglan was productive of an inter-service rapport during the Crimean War and Lyons served as an intermediary between the Navy and the Army. When Lyons captured Balaklava, he advised Raglan to adopt it as the base for the British Army: Raglan did so. However, this was a poor decision because it compelled the army to suffer the Crimean winter.

Although he was a Naval Commander, Lyons led a force during the diversionary attack on Sevastopol on 17 October 1854. Idiosyncratically, Lyons ignored Admiral Dundas&#x27;s orders to remain disengaged and proceeded to attack on his own initiative: on this occasion, however, Lyons&#x27;s attack was unsuccessful and the ships were damaged and heavy casualties sustained. However, although the attack failed, Lyons was praised for his bravery by the High Command. Lyons conceded that he was responsible for the failure, but the High Command blamed Dundas for the failure, dismissed Dundas, and, in January 1855, made Lyons Commander-in-Chief.

Lyons continued to work productively with Raglan to improve supply arrangements in the Bosphorus and at Balaklava. Lyons secured another diplomatic triumph when he secured, in May 1855, French consent to capture of Kerch and occupation of the Sea of Azov: this operation destroyed the logistic support of the Russian army in the Crimea and enabled the allied victory.

=== Later Crimean War ===

In June 1855, Lyons lost both his own son, Edmund, a captain in the Royal Navy, who had been wounded in a night attack on Sevastopol, and his friend and colleague Lord Raglan. Lyons after the defeat of Sevastopol led a successful expedition, which was the first military action to involve armoured warships, to capture Kinburn on 17 October 1855, which enabled access to the Bug and Dnieper rivers. In July 1855, Lyons, who had already received the honour of Knight Grand Cross of the Civil Division of the Order of the Bath, received the honour of Knight Grand Cross of the Military Division of the same order. He is one of few persons to have attained the rank of Knight Grand Cross in both divisions of the Order of the Bath. Lyons attended the January 1856 allied Council of War at Paris, and subsequent to the Treaty of Paris he relinquished his post of Commander in Chief of the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean, for which a Banquet was subsequently hosted for him at the Mansion House, London and he was awarded the Freedom of the City of London on 24 May 1856.

Lyons&#x27;s contribution to the Crimean War was imperative to the allied success. He transported the British Army to the Crimea and he ensured its supplies and support by the military on land, where he led assaults, including the Kerch operation, and where his friendship with Lord Raglan enabled the coordination of the Royal Navy with the British Army and Navy.

== Final years, death, and legacy ==
Edmund Lyons was created a Baron, of Christchurch, on 23 June 1856. He entered the House of Lords between Admiral George Byron, 7th Baron Byron, and Thomas Foley, 4th Baron Foley. He was promoted to Vice-Admiral on 19 March 1857 and held the temporary rank of Admiral from December 1857 until his death. He escorted Queen Victoria to Cherbourg in August 1858. Lyons died, on 23 November 1858, at Arundel Castle, which was the seat of his son-in-law, Henry Granville Fitzalan-Howard, 14th Duke of Norfolk, where he is interred in the vault beneath the Fitzalan Chapel.

There is a life-sized statue of him, by Matthew Noble, in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, which remains there. The Edmund River and Lyons River in Australia are named after him.

Lyons&#x27;s &#x27;intelligence and great ability&#x27; and &#x27;bravery, spirit, and commitment&#x27; earned him the loyalty of the officers and rank-and-file whom he commanded, and he was described as &#x27;as lavish with his praise of others as he was anxious to be praised by his superiors&#x27;. His 1859 Obituary described him as &#x27;affable, playful, and full of quiet humour&#x27;, as having &#x27;frankness and urbanity&#x27;, as having &#x27;inimitable&#x27; ability in &#x27;graphic description&#x27;, and as having &#x27;vigilance and practical skill&#x27; with which he was &#x27;prompt in expedients&#x27;. However, Edmund Lyons was described by a Foreign Secretary, George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon as &#x27;irritable and one of the vainest men I ever knew&#x27;.

<doc id="1022200" wikidata="Q6078052" url="?curid=1022200" title="Aerial work platform">
<text>An aerial work platform (AWP), also an aerial device, aerial lift, boom lift, bucket truck, cherry picker, elevating work platform (EWP), mobile elevating work platform (MEWP), or scissor lift, is a mechanical device used to provide temporary access for people or equipment to inaccessible areas, usually at height. There are various distinct types of mechanized access platforms.

They are generally used for temporary, flexible access purposes such as maintenance and construction work or by firefighters for emergency access, which distinguishes them from permanent access equipment such as elevators. They are designed to lift limited weights — usually less than a ton, although some have a higher safe working load (SWL) — distinguishing them from most types of cranes. They are usually capable of being set up and operated by a single person.

Regardless of the task they are used for, aerial work platforms may provide additional features beyond transport and access, including being equipped with electrical outlets or compressed air connectors for power tools. They may also be equipped with specialist equipment, such as carrying frames for window glass. Underbridge units are also available to lift operators down to a work area.

As the name suggests, cherry pickers were initially developed to facilitate the picking of cherries. Jay Eitel invented the device in 1944 after a frustrating day spent picking cherries using a ladder. He went on to launch the Telsta Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA in 1953 to manufacture the device. Another early cherry picker manufacturer was Stemm Brothers, Leavenworth, WA. Other uses for cherry pickers quickly evolved.

==Lifting mechanisms==
There are several distinct types of aerial work platforms, which all have specific features which make them more or less desirable for different applications. The key difference is in the drive mechanism which propels the working platform to the desired location. Most are powered by either hydraulics or possibly pneumatics. The different techniques also reflect in the pricing and availability of each type.

=== Aerial device ===
Aerial devices were once exclusively operated by hydraulic pistons, powered by diesel or gasoline motors on the base unit. Lightweight electrically powered units are gaining popularity for window-cleaning or other maintenance operations, especially indoors and in isolated courtyards, where heavier hydraulic equipment cannot be used. Aerial devices are the closest in appearance to a crane – consisting of a number of jointed sections, which can be controlled to extend the lift in a number of different directions, which can often include &quot;up and over&quot; applications.

====Articulated====
The most common type of aerial device are known in the AWP industry as knuckle boom lifts or articulated boom lifts, due to their distinctive shape, providing easy access to awkward high reach positions.

This type of AWP is the most likely of the types to be known as a &quot;cherry picker&quot;, owing to its origins, where it was designed for use in orchards (though not just cherry orchards). It lets the picker standing in the transport basket pick fruit high in a tree with relative ease (with the jointed design ensuring minimum damage to the tree). The term &quot;cherry picker&quot; has become generic, and is commonly used to describe articulated lifts (and more rarely all AWPs).

====Straight telescopic boom====
Another type of aerial device is a straight boom lift or telescopic boom lift, which as its name suggests has a boom that extends straight out for direct diagonal or vertical reach by the use of telescoping sections, letting you take full advantage of the boom length range.

====Spider legs====
Some AWPS are classified as spider lifts due to the appearance of their legs as they unfold, extend and stabilise, providing a wide supportive base to operate safely. These legs can be manual or hydraulic (usually depending on size and price of the machine).

====Domains of use====
AWPs are widely used for maintenance and construction of all types, including extensively in the power and telecommunications industries to service overhead lines, and in arboriculture to provide an independent work platform on difficult or dangerous trees. A specialist type of the articulated lift is the type of fire apparatus used by firefighters worldwide as a vehicle to provide high level or difficult access. These types of platforms often have additional features such as a piped water supply and water cannon to aid firefighters in their task.

=== Scissor lift ===

A scissor lift is a type of platform that can usually only move vertically. The mechanism to achieve this is the use of linked, folding supports in a criss-cross X pattern, known as a pantograph (or scissor mechanism). The upward motion is achieved by the application of pressure to the outside of the lowest set of supports, elongating the crossing pattern, and propelling the work platform vertically. The platform may also have an extending deck to allow closer access to the work area, because of the inherent limits of vertical-only movement.

The contraction of the scissor action can be hydraulic, pneumatic or mechanical (via a leadscrew or rack and pinion system). Depending on the power system employed on the lift, it may require no power to descend, able to do so with a simple release of hydraulic or pneumatic pressure. This is the main reason that these methods of powering the lifts are preferred, as it allows a fail-safe option of returning the platform to the ground by release of a manual valve.

Apart from the height and width variables, there are a few considerations required when choosing a scissor lift. Electric scissor lifts have smaller tyres and can be charged by a standard power point. These machines usually suit level ground surfaces and have zero or minimal fuel emissions. Diesel scissor lifts have larger rough terrain tyres with high ground clearance for uneven outdoor surface conditions. Many machines contain outriggers that can be deployed to stabilise the machine for operation.

=== Hotel lift ===
There are a number of smaller lifts that use mechanical devices to extend, such as rack and pinion or screw threads. These often have juxtaposed sections that move past each other in order to facilitate movement, usually in a vertical direction only. These lifts usually have limited capability in terms of weight and extension, and are most often used for internal maintenance tasks, such as changing light bulbs.

==Motive mechanisms==

AWPs, by their nature, are designed for temporary works and therefore frequently require transportation between sites, or simply around a single site (often as part of the same job). For this reason, they are almost all designed for easy movement and the ability to ride up and down truck ramps.

===Unpowered===
These usually smaller units have no motive drive and require external force to move them. Dependent on size and whether they are wheeled or otherwise supported, this may be possible by hand, or may require a vehicle for towing or transport. Small non-powered AWPs can be light enough to be transported in a pickup truck bed, and can usually be moved through a standard doorway.

===Self-propelled===
These units are able to drive themselves (on wheels or tracks) around a site (they usually require to be transported to a site, for reasons of safety and economy). In some instances, these units will be able to move whilst the job is in progress, although this is not possible on units which require secure outriggers, and therefore most common on the scissor lift types. The power can be almost any form of standard mechanical drive system, including electric or gasoline powered, or in some cases, a hybrid (especially where it may be used both inside and outside).

Such person lifts are distinguished from telescopic handlers in that the latter are true cranes designed to deliver cargo loads such as pallets full of construction materials (rather than just a person with some tools).

===Vehicle-mounted===
Some units are mounted on a vehicle, usually a truck. They can also be mounted on a flat-back pick-up van known as a self drive, though other vehicles are possible, such as flatcars. This vehicle provides mobility, and may also help stabilize the unit – though outrigger stabilizers are still typical, especially as vehicle-mounted AWPs are amongst the largest of their kind. The vehicle may also increase functionality by serving as a mobile workshop or store.

== Control ==

The power assisted drive (if fitted) and lift functions of an AWP are controlled by an operator, who can be situated either on the work platform itself, or at a control panel at the base of the unit. Some models are fitted with a panel at both locations or with a remote control, giving operator a choice of position. A control panel at the base can also function as a safety feature if for any reason the operator is at height and becomes unable to operate his controls. Even models not fitted with a control panel at the base are usually fitted with an emergency switch of some sort, which allows manual lowering of the lift (usually by the release of hydraulic or pneumatic pressure) in the event of an emergency or power failure.

Controls vary by model, but are frequently either buttons or a joystick. The type and complexity of these will depend on the functions the platform is able to perform, such as:
* Vertical movement
* Lateral movement
* Rotational movement (cardinal direction)
* Platform / basket movement — normally, the system automatically levels the platform, regardless of boom position, but some allow overrides, tilting up to 90° for work in difficult locations.
* Ground movement (in self-propelled models)

== Safety ==

The majority of manufacturers and operators have strict safety criteria for the operation of AWPs. In some countries, a licence and insurance is required to operate some types of AWP. Most protocols advocate training every operator, whether mandated or not. Most operators adopt a checklist of verifications to be completed before each use. Manufacturers recommend regular maintenance schedules.

Work platforms are fitted with safety or guard rails around the platform itself to contain operators and passengers. This is supplemented in most models by a restraining point, designed to secure a safety harness or fall arrester. Some work platforms also have a lip around the floor of the platform itself to avoid tools or supplies being accidentally kicked off the platform. Some protocols require all equipment to be attached to the structure by individual lanyards.

When using AWPs in the vicinity of overhead power lines, users may be electrocuted if the lift comes into contact with electrical wiring. Non-conductive materials, such as fiberglass, may be used to reduce this hazard. &#x27;No Go Zones&#x27; may be designated near electrical hazards.

AWPs often come equipped with a variety of tilt sensors. The most commonly activated sensor is an overweight sensor that will not allow the platform to raise if the maximum operating weight is exceeded. Sensors within the machine detect that weight on the platform is off-balance to such a point as to risk a possible tip-over if the platform is raised further. Another sensor will refuse to extend the platform if the machine is on a significant incline. Some models of AWPs additionally feature counterweights, which extend in order to offset the danger of tipping the machine inherent in extending items like booms or bridges.

As with most dangerous mechanical devices, all AWPs are fitted with an emergency stop button which may be activated by a user in the event of a malfunction or danger. Best practice dictates fitting of emergency stop buttons on the platform and at the base as a minimum. Other safety features include automatic self-checking of the AWP&#x27;s working parts, including a voltmeter that detects if the lift has insufficient power to complete its tasks and preventing operation if supply voltage is insufficient. Some AWPs provide manual lowering levers at the base of the machine, allowing operators to lower the platform to the ground in the event of a power or control failure, or unauthorized use of the machine.

==Rental equipment==

AWPs are often bought by equipment rental companies, who then rent them out to construction companies or individuals needing these specialised machines. The market for these machines is known to be marked by especially strong boom and bust cycles, and after a great demand in the 1990s the market crashed in 2001, leading to a strong contraction amongst the manufacturers. The industry began a strong growth period again in 2003 that resulted in peak shipments in 2007 prior to the economic crash in 2008. The 2008 crash has caused a strong consolidation amongst rental companies and the industry reached high unit shipment levels again in 2018.

<text>The [[Nokia]] 5510 is a mobile phone announced on October 11, 2001 and released in December of that year. The Nokia 5510 features a full QWERTY keyboard, an 84 x 48 monochrome display, and is notable for its digital music player, the company&#x27;s first mobile phone with music player capabilities. It has a 64 MB memory for storing audio files.

== Features ==
The 5510 shared many of the features of the Nokia 3310 due to both phones sharing components with each other, such as a built-in calculator, stopwatch and a reminder function. It also includes the same five games that came with the Nokia 3330: &quot;Snake II&quot;, &quot;Space Impact&quot;, &quot;Bumper&quot;, &quot;Bantumi&quot;, and &quot;Pairs II&quot;. However, the 5510 also had the ability to play digital music files transferred onto its 64 MB internal flash memory via USB encoded in LSE format via the included Nokia software (from either MP3 or WAV format); as well as being able to receive FM radio.

== Design ==
Compared to other mobile phones of its generation, the 5510 is unusual in that it has an almost complete QWERTY keyboard, rather than the conventional telephone keypad. This keyboard is divided on the left and right sides of the front panel, with the 84 x 48 monochrome display at the center, and the navigational buttons below it (the display and navigational buttons are almost identical to those found on the 3310). Also, four black buttons are located on the side of the phone to allow quick access to the music player, FM radio, and the volume controls.

The removable backplate on the handset was designed in such a way that pressure on the middle of the plastic could easily cause the plate to crack; this was highlighted in many reviews of the model at the time of release.

== Music ==
The 5510 could play both MP3 and AAC audio files but not in their usual formats, instead the files must be encrypted and packaged into a Lockstream Embedded (.lse) files, which was a DRM technology that ensured that the encrypted files could only be played on the device. This encryption could be achieved using the bundled Nokia PC Suite software. Additionally it could record AAC audio directly from its internal FM radio, or through its built-in 2.5 mm (3/32&quot;) audio jack to another format with the extension .rel which only the phone could play back. The music player on the phone also has a built-in equalizer with several pre-sets to fine-tune the music being played.

== Software ==

The bundled version of the Nokia Audio Manager software was designed to encode music and transfer it to the phone via USB, but encoding would typically take several minutes per song and the software only ran under Windows. The design was that files encoded and transferred to the device could not be converted back to their original formats for playing on other devices.

However alternatives to the Nokia Audio Manager did exist, such as Nokryptia, a cross-platform command line tool distributed as source code which by exploiting a special case of the Lockstream Embedded file format could convert MP3 audio files almost instantly to the 5510 playable Lockstream Embedded format. Nokryptia worked by prefixing the MP3 file with a special header that then allowed the MP3 to follow unencrypted (the tool also supported the reverse, removing the header to restore the original MP3 file, however this was only possible on files encoded by the technique and the tool could not restore a file encoded by the Nokia Audio Manager).

<doc id="1022207" wikidata="Q4634102" url="?curid=1022207" title="3-2-1">
<text>3–2–1 is a British game show that made by Yorkshire Television for ITV. It ran for ten years, from 29 July 1978 to 24 December 1988, with Ted Rogers as the host.

It was based on a Spanish game show called &quot;Un, dos, tres... responda otra vez&quot; and was a trio of three shows in one: a quiz, variety and a game show.

The show was a huge success, consistently pulling in large ratings. The first series, though intended as a summer filler, attracted up to 16.5 million viewers and subsequent years never peaked below 12 million. The show occupied a Saturday early evening slot for most of its run.

The final Christmas special, broadcast on 24 December 1988, attracted 12.5 million viewers, but an eleventh series was not commissioned. Ted Rogers claimed in an April 1996 interview that &quot;The Oxbridge lot got control of TV and they didn&#x27;t really want it. It was too downmarket for them. We were still getting 12 million viewers when they took it off after ten years. These days if a show gets nine million everyone does a lap of honour.&quot;

==The format==
The overall objective of the game was to survive elimination through to part three of the show, and try to unravel a series of cryptic clues in order to win the star prize. However, one of the clues referred to &quot;Dusty Bin,&quot; the show&#x27;s booby prize; any contestants who wound up with Dusty at the end of the show received only a new dustbin. Each show had a theme, such as &quot;Seacruise&quot; or the &quot;Swinging Sixties&quot;. All of the variety acts, quiz questions, stage sets and clues subsequently followed this theme. In later series, Dusty would appear at the start of the show dressed in a costume relating to that week&#x27;s theme. The changing themes were dropped for the final series where a more generic stage set was re-used each week.

===Part 1: The 1,000-to-1 quiz===
In part one of the show, three couples had the chance to win up to £1,000 in the &quot;1,000 to 1 quiz&quot;. The first round consisted of a maximum of 10 questions in 30 seconds, each correct answer being worth £10 (or in the first series £1, but with three rounds available). Passes were permitted but there was no opportunity to return to the question. Each member of the couple answered in turn with the lady answering first and the first answer was given to her to avoid the possibility of a zero score, An incorrect answer, or the time limit, would immediately end the round. Each correct answer in the second round was worth the total amount scored in the first, hence the need to avoid a zero score which would have meant a couple were playing for nothing.

The questions were usually of the same &#x27;word association&#x27; format. Ted Rogers would say, for example, an island and the contestants would have to name the country to which it belonged (e.g. Ted: &quot;Gozo&quot;, Contestant: &quot;Malta&quot;). Another example would be songs and the artist or group who made it (e.g. Ted: &quot;Never Say Die&quot;, Contestant: Cliff Richard).

In the first series, the winners of the quiz would return the following week to compete again, while the other two couples would progress to part two, but from the second series, this changed to the worst-performing couple being eliminated, taking home the money they won in the quiz and a ceramic model of Dusty Bin.

Dusty Bin was conceived as the booby prize by the show&#x27;s producer Derek Burrell-Davis and created as a cartoon character by the designer and animator John Sunderland, who also designed the opening and end titles and the themed &#x27;costumes&#x27; for Dusty Bin.

In the final series (1987–1988), the 1,000-to-1 quiz was replaced by a general-knowledge, fingers-on-buzzers quiz. As before, three couples participated, in just two rounds of questions. Each couple began with £10 and could earn another £10 for each correct answer in the first round. The first round required ten correct answers (in other words, the round would not end if ten questions had been read out and not all answered correctly). As soon as Ted started to ask the question, the couple who hit the buzzer first, after Ted had said their name, had three seconds to answer the question, and if they failed to answer the question in three seconds, or answered the question wrong, Ted would say &quot;On Offer&quot; and the other two couples would have a chance to answer the question. Again, the couple who hit the buzzer first, after Ted had said their name, had three seconds to answer, and if they failed to answer the question in three seconds, or answer the question wrong, that question would go into the bin. Following the first round, Ted would give the couples a break, while, he introduced a &quot;newcomer&quot; to 3–2–1 (another addition to the final series). This was a chance for an act to perform, much like the later rounds as normal, though, the &quot;newcomer&quot; had never appeared on 3–2–1 before. Following the newcomer act, round two of the quiz would be played, with only fifteen questions been asked. As with previous series, whatever money the couples had after the first round would be the value of the question to them in the second round, and it was the same format for answering the questions. The maximum a couple could win in this round was £1,650 (as in the starting £10, ten first-round questions answered correctly plus all fifteen in the second round), however, this was never achieved. At the end of the two rounds of questions, the couple with the least money would leave with the money they&#x27;d won and their ceramic Dusty Bin, then they would go to the commercial break. On the 1987 and 1988 Christmas specials, the quiz only consisted of 20 questions worth £100.

===Part 2: The elimination===
The elimination mechanism for reducing the remaining couples down to one changed over the course of the show. In the first two series, it was a physical game to fit in with the show&#x27;s theme. This changed in 1981 to the contestants competing head to head in a computer game (such as &quot;Breakout&quot;), and was finally amended in 1982 to an elimination question which the last two couples would answer after seeing the first three variety acts in part two of the show. The commercial break followed the question, and in 1986 and 1987, a viewers&#x27; question was posed to win a colour television, with three runners up getting a ceramic Dusty Bin. The entry form for that was in that week&#x27;s edition of &quot;TV Times&quot;.

===Part 3: The acts and prize clues===
In the early years, the third round was referred to as Take it or Leave it?. The final version of the show&#x27;s format was amended in 1982 so that from the beginning of part two of the show, the two remaining couples from the quiz watched the first three variety acts together. At the end of each act, one of the performers would come over to the table and give Ted a clue object (or MacGuffin as Ted sometimes called them) and read a corresponding rhyme to provide clues for that particular prize.

After three acts, the couples would decide on which object they would like to reject in the hope that it was Dusty Bin, after hearing the first two rhymes again and then take part in the final elimination question. The losers would leave with the money they had won in part one, their ceramic Dusty Bin and a consolation prize (such as a twelve-piece dinner service) and the winners would go through to part three of the show.

In the first series there were six items brought to the table however this was revised down to five from the second series. 

At the beginning of part three, Ted would decode the clue and reveal the prize which the final couple rejected before the end of part two. Another act would then perform and leave another clue, leaving three on the table. Ted would then re-read one of the earlier two clues, before the couple chose their second item to reject before that prize was then revealed to them. The final variety act would perform and leave a last clue. Ted would then re-read one of the previous clues and the couple would reject their third item, and another prize was then revealed. Ted would then re-read the remaining two clues and the couple would be faced with their final decision leaving them with the prize they have chosen and ultimately won, after seeing what the other prize they had rejected was, and also with the prize they had won, they had the money they won in part one of the show. Unlike the eliminated couples, the winning couple did not receive a ceramic Dusty Bin, unless they had Dusty at the end of the show, all they got was a brand new dustbin, the money they won in part one and a ceramic Dusty Bin. As well as Dusty Bin, which was always one of the five prizes, the other four prizes normally included a car and a holiday. Later series sometimes featured two cars as prizes.

The clues became notorious for being almost impossibly difficult and obscure, having only a remote connection to the prizes, which contestants sometimes did not appear to grasp even after Ted had revealed it to them. It has often been suggested that the clues had more than one possible explanation, allowing the producers to control which prize the contestants received. Indeed, in one episode, Ted jokingly said to confused contestants, attempting to make a decision: &quot;well, the rhymes could mean anything, as you know.&quot;.

For example, a wishbone brought on by Sonny Hayes came with the clue &quot;Take one that never changes, add a pub and a precious stone, bring them all up-to-date, and now, you&#x27;re on your own.&quot;, which the contestants rejected hoping it referred to Dusty Bin. Rogers&#x27; explanation of the clue was: &quot;&#x27;Take one that never changes&#x27;, well, that could be Dusty Bin which of course is where you might throw a wishbone. &#x27;Add a pub and a precious stone&#x27;, well, that doesn&#x27;t point to Dusty. &#x27;Bring them all up-to-date, and now you&#x27;re on your own.&#x27;. Well, what about the wishbone? Sonny said &#x27;a large wishbone&#x27;, so what might a large wishbone come from? Something larger than a chicken. Turkey, maybe? Now, &#x27;one that never changes.&#x27; is a constant, a pub can also be an inn, there&#x27;s a lot of precious stones but how many go with &#x27;constant inn&#x27;? How about opal? Yes, Constantinople, up to date, the pride of Turkey, you&#x27;ve rejected a 3–2–1 holiday!&quot;.

==Acts who appeared on the show==
The early series of the programme featured a regular cast of comedy performers including Chris Emmett, Mike Newman, Felix Bowness, Debbie Arnold and Duggie Brown. This format was changed for later series when each show featured a number of variety acts of the day as well as a house dance troupe such as the Brian Rogers Connection who would perform solos for the first act. They would later often dance behind the acts who would invariably top the bill. Previous dance/hostess troupes who appeared include Lipstick (choreographed by hostess Libby Roberts) and the Gentle Secs.

Other hostesses who appeared on the show include: Mireille Allonville, Jenny Layland, Patsy Ann Scott, Annie St John, Karen Palmer, Gail Playfair, Tula, Alison Temple-Savage, Libby Roberts, Fiona Curzon, Karan David, Wei Wei Wong, Caroline Munro and Lynda Lee Lewis.

Acts who appeared included: Gloria Gaynor, George Roper, Ken Dodd, Charlie Williams, Bonnie Langford, Duncan Norvelle, Black Lace, Bernie Winters, Stutz Bear Cats, Kit and the Widow, Wall Street Crash, Kiki Dee, Michael Ball, &#x27;Nasty Nigel&#x27; Lythgoe, Martin &quot;The Beast&quot; Francis, Tom Pepper, Fay Presto, Pete Price, Manhattan Transfer, Shane Richie, the Flaming Hamsters, Stan Boardman, Fascinating Aida, Showaddywaddy, Kajagoogoo, Frankie Howerd, Colm Wilkinson, Wilfrid Brambell from Steptoe and Son, Sinitta, Five Star, Indigo Lady, Cheryl Baker, Phil Cornwell, Jaki Graham, Nana Mouskouri, the Chuckle Brothers, Brian Conley, Roy Walker, the Drifters, John Sparkes, Wayne Sleep, Andrew O&#x27;Connor, Gareth Hunt, Peter Beckett, Syd Lawrence (with his orchestra), Humphrey Lyttelton, Frankie Vaughan, Jessica Martin, the Foxes, Mud, Keith Harris and Orville, Mick Miller, Diane Solomon, Tony Christie, Cover Girls, Lyn Paul, the Searchers, the Rockin&#x27; Berries, Stephanie Lawrence, Don Lusher (with his band), Madeline Bell, Georgie Fame, Wayne Dobson, the Real Thing, Rebecca Storm, Richard Digance, Anna Dawson, Marion Montgomery, Bill Maynard, the Krankies, Terry Scott, Carmel McSharry, Bob Carolgees, Diana Dors, Lionel Blair, Alvin Stardust, Phil Cool, Vince Eager, Mike Reid, Nicholas Parsons, Sheila Steafel, Danny La Rue, Les Dennis, The Wurzels, Joan Benham, Ken Colyer (with his jazzmen), Frazer Hines, Charlie Williams, Pan&#x27;s People (as Dee Dee Wilde&#x27;s Pan&#x27;s People), Rita Webb, The Great Soprendo, Bernard Bresslaw, Charlie Drake, Aimi MacDonald, Mark Heap (the Two Marks), Vince Hill and Paul Da Vinci.

As was the style of the day, the show often featured speciality acts such as a female singer who sang unconvincing renditions of popular songs whilst her male partner sketched caricatures of famous people connected with the song on a flip chart (e.g. a sketch of Marilyn Monroe was drawn whilst the Elton John song Candle in the Wind was performed) who were Trevillion and (Sadie) Nine. The other songs performed were Smile (Though, Your Heart is Breaking), Eye of the Tiger accompanied by sketches of Charlie Chaplin and a boxer. The prize announcers were: Anthony Schaeffer (1984–1985) and later John Benson (1986–87), who had provided the famous voice-over for &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;.

The Christmas editions of the show sometimes featured celebrities in place of regular contestants. The first Christmas show for 1978 (but broadcast in January 1979 due to industrial action at YTV) featured three celebrity partners, paired according to their fields of work, with Pat Coombs and Julian Orchard (comedy), Terry Wogan and Clodagh Rodgers (pop music), and Mick Channon and Rachael Heyhoe-Flint (sport). Wogan and Rodgers went through to the final. The pair eliminated the five prizes available for charity, becoming the series&#x27; first contestants to end up with Dusty Bin, much to their embarrassment. However, as it was a Christmas special, Dusty Bin contained a cheque for £2,000 for their chosen charity, along with a donation of £3,000 from YTV for a Variety Club Sunshine Coach for a local special educational needs school.

The 1983 Christmas edition featured teenagers as contestants playing for local charities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a representative from Scotland in the audience receiving an average total from the teams&#x27; quiz earnings for their charity. The winning team ended up with Dusty Bin, but this was revealed to be the star prize, meaning all four charities won their prizes.

In the 1984 Christmas edition, the teams were Barbara Windsor and John Inman, Anita Harris and Bernie Winters, and Suzanne Dando and Bernie Clifton. Windsor and Inman were the winners, but they too won Dusty Bin; however on this occasion, the prizes were all revealed to be booby prizes, and again Dusty Bin was the star prize. Windsor and Inman were in on the set up and deliberately contrived to win the dustbin.

The DJ Janice Long appeared as a contestant on the very first episode with her then husband, Trevor, in July 1978

==Hand gesture==
Ted Rogers would regularly make a lightning fast 3–2–1 hand gesture. This became an important gimmick of the show – and a school playground favourite – mainly because it was quite difficult to do, and resulted in a rude hand gesture if performed incorrectly. The correct way of doing the gesture is to hold up three fingers (index, middle, and ring) on the right hand, facing inward; two (index and middle) facing outward; and then one (index) facing inward, turning the wrist while changing the fingers.

==Dusty Bin==
Dusty Bin was both the show&#x27;s mascot and its booby prize. Dusty would appear at the start of each show, dressed in the style of that week&#x27;s theme, though, this did not occur in the 1987 series, as these programmes did not have a theme as per previous series.

The cartoon character of Dusty Bin was created by freelance designer John Sunderland, who developed the character based on the show producers&#x27; brief for a booby prize which would work on the British version of the show. The original Spanish version had a pumpkin as a booby prize. Sunderland&#x27;s concept for the shows&#x27; original titles, which were shown on the original series, included the birth of the bin. The character came to life as Yorkshire Television&#x27;s chevron logo falls to earth after shooting up into the sky like a rocket above the studios, exploding in a dustbin standing by the studio&#x27;s stage door. The bin contained a clown&#x27;s costume, parts of which become one with the bin, bringing it to life as the character Dusty Bin; part dustbin, part clown, all enduring iconic character.

The original robotic Dusty Bin, and his Yorkshire Terrier dog Garbage, was put together by Ian Rowley, in his converted chapel workshop in Rodley, Leeds. He used over 73 microprocessors, which was cutting edge 1980s remote control robotic technology in that day, at a cost around £10,000 to manufacture – which was a small fortune in those days – to control Dusty and Garbage, and in 151 shows, some of Dusty&#x27;s &amp; Garbage&#x27;s antics included dressing up as a caveman and dinosaur, bullfighting as a matador and bull, dressing up as a baby, driving into the studio in a Ford Model T, juggling balls like a clown, playing the piano like Elton John, flying round the studio with a James Bond jetpack, escaping from chains like Harry Houdini, riding a bike, spraying Ted Rogers with paint and even driving a tank into the studio, to bomb the audience with confetti. There are three Dustys made in total, one which is fully robotic is with the creator Ian Rowley. Another is greeting people at the ITV studio entrance and the third is owned by Ted Rogers&#x27;s son Danny.

==In popular culture==
In 1999, as part of their Christmas special entitled &quot;The Phantom Millennium&quot;; French and Saunders included Dusty Bin in a parody of &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;; where Dusty Bin played &quot;Droid DB-321&quot;. Dawn French makes the 3–2–1 &quot;hand signal&quot; whilst she commands the droid in the guise of Queen Amanana (A parody of Queen Amidala). Also, as part of &quot;Comic Relief 2007&quot;, the BBC showed a short sketch based around The Proclaimers&#x27; 1988 song &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna be (500 Miles)&quot;. Directed by and starring Peter Kay, it featured Dusty Bin dancing with a gaggle of forgotten celebrities from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The song was released as a CD single and DVD. Dusty also appeared briefly in a robot-themed chapter of the webcomic Scary Go Round.

The Class 321 trains were nicknamed &#x27;Dusty Bins&#x27; due to the number bearing the same name as the game show, and class 153 unit number 153 321 is also affectionately known as &#x27;Dusty Bin&#x27; by train crews because of its number. The Airbus A321 is also nicknamed &#x27;Dusty Bin&#x27; due to the type bearing the same name as the show.

A 2001 episode of ChuckleVision entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Quizzical&quot; features Ted Rogers as a downmarket game show host. In one scene where the Chuckle Brothers are hiding from Rogers in two dustbin cans, Rogers shouts &quot;Come back here with my dustbin!&quot;, possibly in reference to Rogers&#x27; association with 321 and Dusty Bin. Also in another scene where Rogers hosts the game show &quot;Trophy&#x27;s Cabinet&quot; he begins with a small hand gesture, which is likely a parody of his famous 321 hand gesture.

&quot;The Burkiss Way&quot;, a radio comedy show which co-starred 3-2-1 regular Chris Emmett, parodied the show with a sketch involving a final clue of &quot;It&#x27;s a dustbin and not a car.&quot;, which was revealed to be an anagram of &quot;It&#x27;s a car and not a dustbin.&quot; and thus by rejecting it, the contestants had turned down winning a new car.

Another parody was performed on &quot;Russ Abbot&#x27;s Madhouse&quot;, in which the show was named 1-2-3. The host - played by Les Dennis - presents as the final clue a suitcase and the rhyme: &quot;I pack my bags to go on one, and stay in a nice hotel, and see the sun shine through the palm trees; this a travel agent might sell.&quot; The eager contestants (Russ Abbot and Bella Emberg) pick this prize, certain it will be the holiday... It turns out to be the bin.

In the Artic text adventure game &quot;Planet of Death&quot; that was made for all major 8 bit computers in the early 80s, 3-2-1 was a major clue towards the end of the game. When the character got past the force field, they entered a room that contained their ship and the lift that would take them off the planet. However, the lift is unpowered so on some further exploration the character comes across another room in which, there are 3 switches and the clue reads – &quot;3,2,1 – No Dusty, Bin Rules.&quot;.

The two time (Scottish) BAFTA award winning jester and pro-gamer, Brian “Limmy” Limond regularly analyses old episodes of the show on his Twitch stream.

==DVD game==
An interactive DVD version of &quot;3–2–1&quot; was released by Universal in 2007. Hosted by Dusty Bin (though, Rogers appears in series clips used for the game), it offers both questions from original broadcasts and current ones.

==The prizes==
&quot;3–2–1&quot; become notorious for the unconventional, cheap, and tacky prizes it awarded to winners. For instance, couples only won a brand new metal dustbin if the final clue revealed was &quot;Dusty Bin&quot;. A pet dog was also awarded. Episode 1 featured a St. Bernard and a year&#x27;s supply of brandy. This was rejected by Janice Long and her then husband Trevor. Other less extravagant prizes have included: a sofa that turns into a pool table, gold nuggets, a share in a racehorse, a family set of folding bicycles, a year&#x27;s supply of fish, and matching &#x27;his and hers&#x27; sheepskin coats.

<doc id="1022216" wikidata="Q3452878" url="?curid=1022216" title="Rugby league nines">
<text>Rugby league nines (or simply nines) is a version of rugby league football played with nine players on each side. The game is substantially the same as full rugby league, with some differences in rules and shorter games. Nines is usually played in festivals, as its shorter game play allows for a tournament to be completed in a day or over a single weekend. 

In July 2021, International Rugby League (IRL) chair Troy Grant stated that the organization was considering a bid for rugby league nines to be played at the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane. Rugby sevens, a similarly-condensed version of rugby union, has been a core Olympic event since 2016.

==Laws==
The laws of the game are the same as standard rugby league laws with the following exceptions.

* Each team is allowed a squad of up to fifteen players, with no more than nine players on the field at any time. Unlimited substitutions are allowed from a named bench of four players.
* The match lasts for 18 minutes, divided into two halves of 9 minutes. There is no half time interval but teams are allowed a maximum of 1 minute to change ends. Each half starts with a place kick. 
* Scrums consist of no more than 5 forwards, with a maximum 3 in the front row and 2 in the second row. When the ball is in the scrum no more than 4 players from each team shall act as backs. The ball must emerge from behind the feet of the second row. 
* Conversions after a successful try take the form of drop kicks. Players from the team that has conceded the score do not have to retire behind the try line but must not interfere with any conversion attempt.
* When points have been scored the team against which points have been scored will restart the game with a tap restart from the centre of the half-way line. 
* When a team is awarded a penalty then play must proceed by way of a tap 10-metres in advance of where the infringement took place.
* In the event of misconduct by a player the referee can suspend for 5 minutes. In the Carnegie Floodlit Nines, a major nines competition, this has been reduced to 2 minutes.

<doc id="1022221" wikidata="Q202531" url="?curid=1022221" title="Deception Point">
<text>Deception Point is a 2001 mystery-thriller novel by American author Dan Brown. It is Brown&#x27;s third novel. It was published by Simon &amp; Schuster.

The novel follows White House intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton&#x27;s involvement in corroborating NASA&#x27;s discovery of a meteorite that supposedly contains proof of extraterrestrial life, resembling the ALH84001 case. The discovery comes at a time close to the United States presidential election in which her father is running. The discovery will aid the campaign of her employer, the incumbent president of the United States, Zachary Herney, but put her further at odds with her already estranged father, Senator Sedgwick Sexton, who is running for election. Ms. Sexton, accompanied by a team of experts, must prove the authenticity of the meteorite, which will either make or break the campaign of President Herney.

==Plot==
On the eve of a United States presidential election, NASA discovers a meteorite in the Milne Ice Shelf containing fossils of insect-like creatures, seemingly proving the existence of extraterrestrial life. The discovery could potentially be a deciding factor in the presidential election, in which one of the key issues is whether to continue funding NASA. Incumbent US President Zachary Herney favors supporting space research, while his challenger Senator Sedgewick Sexton argues for dissolving NASA.

President Herney sends a team of experts to the Arctic to verify the authenticity of the extraterrestrial insect: oceanographer Michael Tolland, astrophysicist Corky Marlinson, glaciologist Norah Mangor, paleontologist Wailee Ming, and National Reconnaissance Office employee Rachel Sexton, Senator Sexton&#x27;s daughter.

When the scientists find an anomaly that calls the authenticity of NASA&#x27;s discovery into question, they are attacked by a Delta Force team that had secretly been spying on them. The Delta Force soldiers kill Ming and Mangor while leaving Rachel, Tolland and Marlinson to perish on an ice floe, but they are rescued by the Navy submarine USS &quot;Charlotte&quot;. Rachel alerts presidential advisor Marjorie Tench and NRO director William Pickering of the attack, and Pickering sends an air transport to bring them back to the United States.

Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Tench tries to sabotage Sexton&#x27;s campaign by blackmailing his aide, Gabrielle Ashe, with photos of an extramarital affair that she had with Senator Sexton, and reveals that Sexton is secretly backed by a coalition of private aerospace corporations who would profit from NASA&#x27;s dissolution. Ashe discovers that Tench&#x27;s claims are true, but also finds out that NASA lied about the origin of the meteorite.

The surviving scientists retreat to Tolland&#x27;s research ship off the New Jersey coast, where they fully re-analyze their data and discover that the meteorite is fake. A surprise attack by the Delta Force team prompts Rachel to fax the data to her father, asking for help. In the ensuing skirmish, all Delta Force soldiers are killed, their helicopter is sunk, and Pickering is revealed to be their commander; he masterminded the fake meteorite to aid Herney&#x27;s campaign and prevent the dissolution of NASA. The ship and Pickering are sucked in by a vortex, while a Coast Guard Osprey picks up Rachel, Tolland and Marlinson.

Sexton attempts to reveal Rachel&#x27;s fax in a press conference in hopes of implicating NASA and the president in the meteorite hoax, but Rachel and Gabrielle swap Rachel&#x27;s fax with the photo evidence of Sexton&#x27;s affair with Gabrielle, humiliating him and ruining his chances of winning the election. By the end of the story, Michael and Rachel have developed a romantic relationship.

==Characters==
Authentication team: During the story, NASA invites five external experts to help authenticate the meteorite finding as secondary sources:

* Rachel Sexton: A data analyst for the NRO and Senator Sexton&#x27;s daughter, Rachel&#x27;s relationship with her father is antagonistic because of his infidelity, which indirectly contributed to her mother&#x27;s death in an accident. Her involvement in the authentication is eventually proven to be purely political.
* Michael Tolland: An oceanographer and television celebrity-scientist, Tolland possesses excellent educational and social skills and does not exhibit unchecked anger, as other characters do. Tolland can remain calm under fire and think out of the box. Having lost his wife to cancer, Tolland gradually develops a crush on Rachel.
* Corky Marlinson: A world-renowned astrophysicist and a staunch proponent of the authenticity of the meteorite, Corky has little knowledge of proper social conduct. Corky survives a shark attack.
* Norah Mangor: A prickly glaciologist, Norah has a tough, tomboyish personality; she is suffocated with ice and snow early in the book by Pickering&#x27;s death squad and was thrown into the Arctic Ocean along with her sled.
* Wailee Ming: A paleontologist with an impeccable dress habit; he is drowned early in the book by Pickering&#x27;s death squad when he attempted to investigate an irregularity in the extraction hole.

Politicians:
* Zachary Herney: The President of the United States, criticized for his extravagant expenditure of U.S. money on low-yield areas (including the allegedly futile search for extraterrestrial life) while the important areas of nation (such as education) suffer from the lack of funds. The events of the story lead him into revising government extravagance.
* Senator Thomas Sedgewick Sexton: Rachel&#x27;s father and an ambitious presidential candidate in the book. Senator Sexton is corrupt, promiscuous, and ruthless; he accepts bribes, engages in several extramarital affairs and would even sacrifice his daughter to crush his political opponent harder, but the consequences of his actions eventually destroy his political standing. Because of his ego, he does not take computer security seriously and chooses weak passwords for his computer.
* Marjorie Tench: Senior Adviser to the president. Described as very astute and ruthless, she anonymously sends information about the president&#x27;s expenditure on NASA to lure Sexton into attacking the organization. Tench has kept the meteorite discovery a secret, intending to use it as a justification for the expenditure, making Sexton&#x27;s criticism backfire. When Rachel informs her of the fake nature of the meteorite, Tench attempts to hush it up before being killed by Pickering&#x27;s death squad.
* Gabrielle Ashe: Senator Sexton&#x27;s aide and one-time mistress, she relays information about NASA&#x27;s extravagance to Senator Sexton. When the senator&#x27;s campaign collapses, she infiltrates NASA to help salvage the campaign by finding potential evidences of falsification. Gabrielle later threatens to expose her one-time illegitimate affair in order to dissuade Sexton from sacrificing her daughter for his political ambitions. Failing to succeed, she and Rachel cooperate to replace the meteorite fiasco evidence with photos of said affair.

NASA:
* Lawrence Ekstrom: Administrator of NASA; serves no purpose in the book beyond attracting suspicion.
* Chris Harper: NASA section manager; he appears in four dedicated chapters and explains how NASA did not find the meteorite as claimed.

NRO:
* William Pickering: The main antagonist, director of the NRO and the handler of the Delta Force team featured in the book, he is the mastermind behind main plot line. Pickering&#x27;s intention is to help president Herney maintain the office for ulterior motives of his own; his ultimate goal is to make NASA a division of the NRO, thus rendering its operations clandestine. He and the Delta Force team under his command would kill anyone who is a threat to his plan, even Marjorie Tench, the president&#x27;s adviser, who once had disagreed with him. Pickering is sucked into a vortex.
* Delta Force team: A team of three males, they are the death squad of William Pickering and have access to state-of-the-art technology of the time, such as surveillance microbots, an Aurora aircraft, a Kiowa Warrior helicopter and weapons that manufacture their own munitions. All three are killed; two are eaten by sharks and their leader is drowned inside a Kiowa Warrior.

<text>Castletroy (, meaning O&#x27;Troy&#x27;s Landing or O&#x27;Troy&#x27;s Callow) is a suburb of Limerick, Ireland. The town was named after Castle Troy also known as the Black Castle, which is located on the southern bank of the River Shannon, roughly 2 km east of the University of Limerick. However the name likely predates the castle itself as the area may have been used by the O’Turrain clan (who were no longer in the area by the time the castle was built) having used it as a safe harbour for navigating the river.

==History==
Historically, the district was entirely separate to Limerick, and consisted of little development aside from the villages of Annacotty and Monaleen. With the creation of the University of Limerick, as well as the growth of Limerick city itself, this began to change. Castletroy is one of the fastest-growing residential areas in Ireland and has now engulfed the old villages of Annacotty and Monaleen (&quot;Móin a lín&quot; - field of flax).

Castletroy includes three primary schools Milford NS, Monaleen NS and a Gaelscoil (Gaelscoil Chaladh an Treoigh), the secondary school, Castletroy College, and a number of hotels including the Kilmurry Lodge Hotel and Castletroy Park Hotel. It is also host to both Milford and Monaleen GAA Clubs.

Castletroy Golf Course is well known and divides Monaleen and Castletroy itself. Kilbane, Castletroy Heights, Monaleen Heights and Monaleen Park were the original housing developments and were once surrounded by farmland. These houses are the oldest.

Recent developments include numerous sprawling housing estates, with much of the new development concentrated near Castletroy College. The Castletroy Shopping Centre extends to some and is located off Dublin road at Kilmurry roundabout adjacent to the Briarfield estate. It includes a SuperValu supermarket and 24 mall shops, McDonald&#x27;s restaurant and an eight-screen Odeon cinema. Lidl have recently opened a branch in Castletroy. A local park has also been built including a children&#x27;s playground and skatepark. The National Technology Park is home to some major business in Castletroy such as &#x27;Vistakon&#x27;, a contact lens division of Johnson &amp; Johnson and Viagogo an online ticket marketplace for buying and selling tickets to live events. More recently Chicago based financial institution Northern Trust has expended in Castletroy&#x27;s Hamilton House 2 and opened a new office in City East Plaza also in Castletroy.

In the past several attempts were made by Limerick City Council to expand its area of control to include Castletroy as part of its plan to expand the old city boundary to include large suburbs just outside the boundary. Up until June 2014 Castletroy and neighbouring suburbs were not within the city boundary despite being part of the city’s overall urban fabric. The amalgamation of the 2 local authorities in Limerick from 2014 saw all areas of Limerick (city and county) come under one united and single authority for the first time. The merger of the authorities saw the city area expanded to include all urban areas (including Castletroy) within the Limerick urban area into the Limerick Metropolitan District within the merged Limerick authority.

==Places of interest==
=== Castle Troy also known as The Black Castle ===
Located on the southern bank of the River Shannon, roughly 2 km East of the University of Limerick. Castle Troy was erected in the reign of Henry III (1216-1272) by one of the O&#x27; Briens. Many years later it was the seat of the MacKeoghs, a war-like tribe, often in conflict with neighbouring chiefs. The MacKeoghs continued to hold land in Castletroy, but at some point before the reign of Elizabeth I the castle was taken over by their overlord, the Earl of Desmond. The Earl of Desmond rebelled against the English monarchy and their lands were foirfeit and the Castle Troy became the property of Sir John Bourke of Brittas.

According to tradition when Cromwell landed in 1649 with his New Model Army his general Henry Ireton in 1651 led an army on Limerick and set up cannons on Harty&#x27;s Hill and battered the castle as it was ideally positioned to defend the city against forces moving down the River Shannon. Castle Troy was granted to James Duke of York in 1666 and later sold to the Hollow Blade Company in 1703.

Castletroy Castle&#x27;s history is recounted in verse in Hogan&#x27;s &quot;Lays, Legends of Thomond&quot;:

* Lo! grey Castletroy by war,
* Tide and time batter&#x27;d Stands,
* like an old chief With his armour all shatter&#x27;d
* As if musing, in gloomy and gaunt desolation
* On the red feudal days
* When Green Erin was a Nation.
* There the warlike Mac keoghs,
* In their power and revell&#x27;d
* And often in fight
* Were their sounding spears levell&#x27;d
* &#x27;Till Cromwell, the fiend, with his
* Tower-cleaving cannon,
* Ploughed their strong castle walls
* On the brink of the Shannon&quot;.

=== Jewish graveyard ===
There is a small Jewish graveyard in Castletroy. This dates from the late 19th century when Limerick had a sizable Jewish community and was renovated and reopened by Chief Rabbi Mervis in 1990. Limerick&#x27;s Jewish population waned over the decades, though a number of Jewish people lived in Castletroy as late as the 1980s.

<doc id="1022248" wikidata="Q2081248" url="?curid=1022248" title="Carnaross">
<text>Carnaross or Carnaros () is a village in County Meath, Ireland, approximately 4 km northwest of Kells on the R147 road between Kells and Virginia, County Cavan.

== Etymology ==
Carnaross is an anglicisation of the Irish language &quot;Carn na Ros&quot;, meaning &quot;cairn of the woods&quot; or &quot;rock of the woods&quot;.

Specifically, &quot;carn&quot; is believed to refer to a local cairn; an ancient pagan burial site or heap of stones over a grave. Evidence for such a burial site may exist nearby in a farmers field. Known as Keim the churchyard, this site contains an ogham inscribed stone which was discovered in 2006. Other sources suggest that &quot;carn&quot; is derived from &quot;carraig&quot;, the Irish for stone or rock.

Separately, &quot;ros&quot; is believed to refer to a hill or promontory covered with trees or brushwood.

==History==
===Parish===
The parish of Carnaross is composed of the three mediaeval parishes of Castle Kieran, Loughan and Dulane. Carnaross is not mentioned as a townland earlier than 1837, and even then John O&#x27;Donovan in the Ordnance Survey Field Name Books, refers to it as &quot;a group of houses (two of them public houses) called Carnaross&quot;.

A number of sources record holy wells in the area, including one dedicated to Saint Anne.

===Former constituent parishes===
====Loghan====
One of the former constituent parishes, Loghan or Loughan, is described by Samuel Lewis in his 1837 &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot; as being:
:&quot;a parish, partly in the barony of Castlerahan, county of Cavan, and province of Ulster, but chiefly in the barony of Upper Kells, county of Meath, and province of Leinster, 4 miles (N. W.) from Kells, on the road from Dublin by Kells to Enniskillen; containing 3795 inhabitants, of which number, 339 are in the village of Loghan.&quot;

Lewis notes that there was then a private school (with 60 pupils) at Carnaross, and the remains small church close to the which was dedicated to Saint Kieran.

====Dulane====
Lewis (1837) also has an entry for the parish of Duleen or Dulane, which is also described as being the barony of Upper Kells &quot;on the road to Moynalty; containing 1503 inhabitants&quot;. He notes that the &quot;&quot;land is generally of good quality; and the system of agriculture is improved&quot; with &quot;sufficient quantity of bog for fuel&quot; A private school of 50 children is recorded, with a number of ancient crosses in the local churchyard.

&quot;The Diocese of Meath : Ancient and Modern&quot;, published in 1862 by Anthony Cogan, describes the church at Dulane as being at least partly ruined and having &quot;every appearance of antiquity&quot;&quot;. The area is recorded as being the ancient site of an abbey of Tuilen, or Tulan, founded by Saint Ciaran in the sixth century.

====Castlekeiran====
Castlekeiran is also described in &quot;The Diocese of Meath : Ancient and modern&quot; (Cogan, 1862):
:&quot;Castlekeiran, a village, in the parish of Loghan, barony of Upper Kells, county of Meath, and province of Leinster, 2 ½ miles (W. N. W.) from Kells; containing 24 houses and 162 inhabitants.&quot;
:&quot;Castlekeiran is called sometimes hter-Chiarain. This place was anciently called Bealaigh-duin, &quot; the Road or Pass of the Fort&quot;. A monastery was founded here on the southern bank of the Abhainn-Sele, or Blackwater, by Saint Ciaran, which was called Diseart Chiarain-Bealaigh-duin.&quot;

=== Ogham stone ===
An Ogham stone, found in Keim Churchyard has an inscription which reads &quot;COVAGNI MAQI MUCOI LUGUNI&quot;. This translates from ogham as: &quot;Cuana son of the people of Lugh&quot;. The tribes of the Gaileanga and Luighne occupied these territories anciently, with Cuana, Maelan, Mac Maelan and Leochain or Loughan cited as a chiefly names amongst notices for these Luighne and Gaileanga. Cuana is linked with the ancient battle of Belach-Duinn (Castlekeiran).

===Annalistic references===
The Annals of the Four Masters have the following notices relating to Carnaross :

:&quot;770. Ciaran,* the Pious, of Bealach-dain, died on 14 June.&quot;

:&quot;855. Siadhal, Abbot of -Chiarain (Castlekieran), died.&quot;

:&quot;868. Comsudh, Abbot of -Chiarain, of Bealach-duin, died.&quot;

:&quot;949. Castlekieran was plundered by the Danes.&quot;

:&quot;961. Dubhthach, Abbot of Castlekieran, died.&quot;

==Notable buildings==
A former Church of Ireland building on the R147, constructed from sheet metal in the 19th century, is one of the more unusual features of Carnaross. This church, known as the &quot;Iron Church&quot;, fell into disuse in the 1970s but was subsequently purchased by a family from Collon, County Louth and used as an independent evangelical place of worship.

Carnaross is home to a cattle mart. The mart held Ireland&#x27;s first virtual mart during the COVID-19 restrictions in 2020.

<text>The Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) was a research institute in the field of computing and telecommunications founded in 1986 by Hermann Hauser and Andy Hopper.

==History==
When Olivetti acquired Acorn Computers in 1985, Hauser, who was Acorn&#x27;s co-founder, became vice-president for research at Olivetti where he was in charge of laboratories in the US and Europe. In 1986, Hauser co-founded the Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) in Cambridge, England, along with Professor Andy Hopper. Hopper became the laboratory&#x27;s Director.

In 1988, Hauser left Olivetti. In 1997 the lab became the Olivetti &amp; Oracle Research Lab. In January 1999 it was acquired by AT&amp;T Corporation and became AT&amp;T Laboratories Cambridge.

AT&amp;T Laboratories Cambridge was for three years Europe&#x27;s leading communications engineering research laboratory. The laboratory was internationally recognised as a centre of excellence, undertaking advanced research into communications, multimedia and mobile technologies.

As a result of heavy losses, AT&amp;T restructured its worldwide research efforts and the Cambridge labs closed on 24 April 2002.

<doc id="1022250" wikidata="Q3752902" url="?curid=1022250" title="Raheen, County Limerick">
<text>Raheen () is a large suburb of Limerick, Ireland. Initially developed to ease population overspill from the city of Limerick, Raheen is socioeconomically diverse, ranging from older, poor-class housing estates to relatively affluent areas.

==History==
The oldest parts of the area were built in the 1960s and 1970s. In the following years, Raheen and neighbouring Dooradoyle both experienced growth, particularly during the Celtic Tiger. Raheen became one of Limerick&#x27;s more multicultural areas, as it was a common destination for immigrants. It has for a long time contained notable populations of Jewish, South Asian and Chinese descent, with a large influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe arriving during Ireland&#x27;s economic boom.

Until 2014, Raheen, as with many other large Limerick city suburbs, was outside the boundary of Limerick City Council. Local government was under the jurisdiction of Limerick County Council, itself a separate authority to the city council with responsibility towards County Limerick. June 2014 saw the merger of the Limerick authorities into one unified authority. The merger saw the expansion of the city boundaries to include Raheen. Limerick City Council made many attempts in the past to extend its control over these parts of the city but were unsuccessful as part of a boundary extension to the city council area.

==Economy==
The local economy is highly dependent on light and heavy industry based at Raheen Business Park. It is the home of many international companies, and multi-national concerns with premises there including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Analog Devices, Dell, Banta, ON Semiconductor, Stryker Corp. (formerly Howmedica), RRD GTS, and Emutex. The Dell manufacturing plant was one of the largest employers in Limerick before its closure in January 2009, which dealt a major blow to the economy of the greater Limerick area. The former Dell plant has since been taken over by Regeneron.

The radio station Spin South West and a Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board (LCETB) campus (formerly FÁS) operate from the Raheen Industrial Estate. The Industrial Estate is divided into two sections, the old section entrance is on the Raheen Roundabout (R526 St Nessan Road and R510) the Second Entrance is on the New Section with its entrance on the M20.

==Amenities==
Raheen shares many amenities with neighbouring Dooradoyle, including the Crescent Shopping Centre and the main campus of University Hospital Limerick. Shops and restaurants/café&#x27;s are located around the Raheen and adjoining Father Russell Road area. St. Nessan&#x27;s Church (a Roman Catholic church) is located in Raheen.

Schools in the area include St. Paul&#x27;s National School and St. Nessan&#x27;s National School. Secondary schools in the area include Crescent Comprehensive College (in Dooradoyle) and Gaelscoil an Raithin.

==Transport==
Raheen has 3 different city bus routes running through it, operated by Bus Éireann: 

* 301 (Westbury/Shannon Banks-Father Russell Road via City Centre)
* 304 (UL-Raheen/Ballycummin via City Centre)
* 304A (Monaleen-Raheen via Bus/Rail Station)

The 301 and 304 run via the city centre between Father Russell Road and Raheen to Westbury/Shannon Banks and UL respectively. The 304A runs between Raheen and Monaleen via Colbert Station on Parnell Street, avoiding the city centre.

The R526 runs through Raheen into Limerick City Centre. National road N69 starts in the area, linking it to Tralee, County Kerry, as well as the N18 linking Limerick to nearby Shannon Airport and further on to Ennis, County Clare and Galway City. 

Raheen also hosts exits to the M20 and M7 motorways, linking Limerick city to Cork and Dublin.

<doc id="1022251" wikidata="Q4478332" url="?curid=1022251" title="Nikolai Ustryalov">
<text>Nikolai Vasilyevich Ustryalov (; November 25, 1890 – September 14, 1937) was a Russian politician and a leading pioneer of National Bolshevism. His great-uncle was Nikolay Gerasimovich Ustryalov. Ustryalov and many of his followers were later charged with counter-revolutionary activity and executed during the Great Purge.

==Early years==
Ustryalov was born in Saint Petersburg. He graduated in law from Moscow University in 1913. Teaching at Moscow University, he was initially a member of the Constitutional Democratic Party. Ustryalov belonged to a tendency of Slavophile intellectuals, although from early on he departed from his contemporaries by being less enthusiastic about the Eastern Orthodox Church than the likes of Sergei Bulgakov and Peter Berngardovich Struve. He started out as a supporter of the &quot;Whites&quot; in the Russian Civil War and saw service under the command of Aleksandr Kolchak. However Ustryalov changed his views towards a fusion of nationalism with Bolshevism, with the new communism presented as the best hope for re-establishing Russia as an international power.

==Ideology==
Amongst Ustryalov&#x27;s written works were contributions to &quot;The Problems of Great Russia&quot; and &quot;Morning of Russia&quot;, two pre-Bolshevik journals in which he called for unity amongst the Slavs and rejoiced in the overthrow of Tsarist rule. In exile he founded the journal &quot;Okno&quot; (Window) with other dissidents and in 1921 published his seminal collection of articles &quot;Smena vekh&quot; (&quot;Change of Landmarks&quot;), in which he expounded his theories of nationalism and that gave rise to a weekly magazine, &quot;Smena vekh&quot;. The main ideologue for the Smenovekhovtsy as his followers became known, Ustryalov used written works such as &quot;In the Struggle for Russia&quot; (1920) and &quot;Under the Sign of Revolution&quot; (1925) to argue against the views of Struve. Claiming to be inspired by figures such as General Aleksei Brusilov and Vladimir Purishkevich, both of whom had said they would serve the Bolsheviks in the interests of Russia, Ustryalov called for a reconciliation with the Soviet Union as it was only the Bolsheviks who could guarantee Russia&#x27;s security. With the introduction of the New Economic Policy Ustryalov saw a process of &quot;normalisation&quot; beginning in the Soviet Union and argued that increasingly the USSR was &quot;like a radish&quot; in that it was red on the outside but white on the inside. Ustryalov did not consider himself a communist, rejecting the ideology as a foreign import, but began to use the term &quot;National Bolshevik&quot; after discovering it in the writings of German dissident Ernst Niekisch.

Despite his enthusiasm Ustryalov was dismissed as an enemy by Vladimir Lenin and lived in exile in Harbin, Manchuria. Here he worked as an advisor at the China Far East Railway, (KVZhD). He was Dean of the Faculty of Law at Harbin from 1920 until 1924.

==Return to the Soviet Union==
With attitudes towards National Bolshevism having thawed under Stalin, Ustryalov was able to return to the Soviet Union in 1935. Trotsky regarded the forces that gathered around Ustryalov as not wanting Russia to return to a state of semi-colonial dependence on Western capitalism and therefore anticapitalist without being the least bit socialist. According to Trotsky, Ustryalov and his followers foresaw the conversion of the Soviet state into a normal bourgeois state, and believed that this state should be supported. Ustryalov&#x27;s past as a White counted against him, however, and he struggled to find employment or even acceptance as a Soviet citizen in Moscow. Eventually he was sent to a gulag.

In 1937, during the Great Purge, he was arrested on charges of espionage and &quot;anti-Soviet agitation&quot;. On September 14, 1937, he was sentenced to death and executed on the same day.

<doc id="1022252" wikidata="Q1824774" url="?curid=1022252" title="International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism">
<text>The International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism—or Ligue internationale contre le racisme et l&#x27;antisémitisme (LICRA) in French—was established in 1927 and is opposed to intolerance, xenophobia, and exclusion.

In 1927, French journalist Bernard Lecache created &quot;The League Against Pogroms&quot; and launched a media campaign in support of Sholom Schwartzbard, who assassinated Symon Petliura on May 25, 1926, in the Latin Quarter of Paris. Schwartzbard viewed Petliura as responsible for numerous pogroms in Ukraine. After Schwartzbard&#x27;s acquittal, the league evolved into LICA (Ligue internationale contre l&#x27;antisémitisme, or International League Against Anti-Semitism), and Schwartzbard would become a prominent and active member of the organization.

In 1931, LICA counted 10,000 subscribers in France. It played a significant role during the battle between leagues in February 1934. After 1932, LICA evolved into LICRA, but the name was officially changed only in 1979 during the long presidency of Jean Pierre-Bloch (from 1968 to 1992 in office).

In September 1939, as the Second World War started, numerous LICRA subscribers were mobilized, and many were members of the Resistance throughout the war. During the German occupation of France, LICRA was banned by the Vichy government and had to regroup clandestinely to help the victims of Nazi racial measures. This was done by hiding them away from Paris, by providing them with fake IDs, and by helping them escape to Switzerland, Spain, and England.

In 1972, a law authorized LICRA to counsel victims of racist acts during their court appearances. Later, LICRA received considerable media attention during the case of &quot;LICRA v. Yahoo!&quot;, in which it brought charges against Yahoo! for selling Nazi memorabilia to people in France in violation of French laws proposed, passed, and used by and for LICRA.

The LICRA campaigns against neonazism and Holocaust denial. For example, it supported the Klarsfeld couple (Serge and Beate Klarsfeld) and was active during Klaus Barbie&#x27;s trial in 1987.

In the 1990s, LICRA opened branches abroad: in Switzerland, in Belgium, in Luxembourg, in Germany, in Portugal, in Quebec, and more recently, in Congo Brazzaville and in Austria.

From 1999, with the arrival of President Patrick Gaubert, LICRA broadened its scope to include addressing social issues such as work discrimination, citizenship, and disadvantaged youth.

==Commissions==
** The Psychological Help Commission supports distressed victims of racist or antisemitic acts.
** The Juridical Commission examines and decides whether to sue for racist speech or writing. It can also help victims with legal advice.
** The Youth Commission was created after the 2002 events to address a lack of young subscribers. It carries out local and national actions to make young people more sensitive to racism and antisemitism issues. This commission brings together subscribers aged 16 to 30 every second Sunday of the month.
** The Memory, History, and Human Rights Commission, created in 1986, informs and trains LICRA members. Its preventative actions are:
*** historical information about the members,
*** expertise regarding racism or antisemitism-related books, photos, and videos,
*** spread of historical knowledge to teachers and students.
** The Sport Commission tries to maintain sport as an integration tool. It leads prevention action towards violence in stadiums. It fights against communitarism and against those who use sport as a means of recruitment and infiltration. In Europe, the LICRA represents France in the FARE network.
** The Education Commission, led by Barbara Lefebvre and Alain Seksig, makes young people more aware of Republican values.

== Presidents ==
* Bernard Lecache (1927–1968)
* Jean Pierre-Bloch (1968–1992)
* Jean-Pierre Pierre-Bloch, son of Jean Pierre-Bloch
* Pierre Aidenbaum (1992–1999)
* Patrick Gaubert (1999–2010)
* Alain Jakubowicz (2010–2017)
* Mario Stasi (since 2017)

==Objectives and resources==
The LICRA&#x27;s aim is to stay in permanent alertness concerning any kind of discrimination. It fights against everyday racism and the banalization of xenophobic acts. It helps the victims, who are often unaware of their rights. It pays attention to any racist speech in the media. It does not want to challenge the press&#x27;s freedom of speech, but only to find and correct any hate or discrimination incitement. It also makes sure that any negationist document is removed from sale.

The LICRA acts on the field via its volunteers in every region. The action program is voted on by nine commissions (historical memory, juridical, education, cultural, sport, Europe, integration, citizenship, and youth). Since 1932, the LICRA has published a newspaper called &quot;le droit de vivre&quot; (the right to live), which is an essential aid to expressing the LICRA&#x27;s values and engagements. Given out to all the members, it is a tool of internal and external communication. It allows us to sum up LICRA&#x27;s local, national, and international actions. Depending on the actuality, many personalities (political, NGO, sports, etc.) express themselves in its columns.

==Financing==
The LICRA is mainly financed by state subsidies. It receives around 500,000 euros every year from the French government.

<doc id="1022256" wikidata="Q868968" url="?curid=1022256" title="River Conwy">
<text>The River Conwy (; ) is a river in north Wales. From its source to its discharge in Conwy Bay it is long and drains an area of 678 square km. &quot;Conwy&quot; was formerly anglicised as &quot;Conway.&quot;

The name &#x27;Conwy&#x27; derives from the old Welsh words &quot;cyn&quot; (chief) and &quot;gwy&quot; (water), the river being originally called the &#x27;Cynwy&#x27;.

It rises on the Migneint moor where a number of small streams flow into Llyn Conwy, then flows in a generally northern direction, being joined by the tributaries of the rivers Machno and Afon Lledr before reaching Betws-y-coed, where it is also joined by Llugwy. From Betws-y-coed the river continues to flow north through Llanrwst, Trefriw (where it is joined by the Afon Crafnant) and Dolgarrog (where it is joined by Afon Porth-llwyd and Afon Ddu) before reaching Conwy Bay at Conwy. A local quay, Cei Cae Gwyn, is located on its bank. During spring tides the river is tidal as far as Tan-lan, near Llanrwst.

==Tributaries of the River Conwy==
This is a list of named tributaries of the Conwy (and their tributaries) listed from source to sea;
* River Machno at Conwy Falls
* Afon Lledr near Betws-y-coed
* River Llugwy at Betws-y-coed
* Afon Gallt y Gwg
* Nant y Goron at Llanrwst
* Afon Crafnant &amp; Fairy Falls at Trefriw
** River Geirionydd
* Afon Ddu (1) at Dolgarrog
* Afon Porth-llwyd at Dolgarrog
* Afon Dulyn at Tal-y-bont
** Afon Ddu (2)
** Afon Garreg-wen
** Ffrwd Cerriguniawn
** Afon Melynllyn
* Afon Hiraethlyn near Tal-y-cafn
* Afon Roe near Llanbedr-y-Cennin
** Afon Tafolog
* Afon Gyffin at Conwy

==Geology and geomorphology==

The Conwy is bounded to the east by the rolling ancient mudstone hills of the Silurian period, the Migneint Moors. These acid rocks are generally covered in thin, often acid soils and for large parts of the upland areas the cover is of moor grass – &quot;Mollinia spp&quot; and &quot;Erica&quot; communities. As a result, the water entering the river tends to be acidic and often coloured brown with humic acids.

To the west, the catchment is underlain by older Cambrian rocks which are harder and the landscape is, as a consequence, more dramatic with high craggy hills and mountains, through which the river falls in cascades and waterfalls. Examples of torrential river geomorphology can be seen at Conwy Falls and in the Lledr Gorge. The land to the east is highly forested with planted non-native conifers.

On the western side of the valley are a number of lakes and reservoirs. The rocks are also rich in minerals and there are many abandoned mine sites where copper, lead and silver have been mined since Roman times.

The river valley downstream of Betws-y-coed is relatively wide and fertile, and supports dairying and sheep rearing. In the winter, these pastures are used to nurture the sheep brought down from the mountains to avoid the worst of the winter weather.

==SSSI==
Aber Afon Conwy is a site of special interest. It has acquired such a status due to its marine and terrestrial biology. The tidal reach of the site is around . Its upstream boundary is south of Tal y Cafn, and the whole site encompasses Conwy Bay. The shoreline is supported by natural rock, in addition to boulder clay cliff, sand dune, salt marsh and woodland.

==Culture and history==
The scattered communities along the Conwy valley have ancient traditions with archeological evidence of habitation back to the Stone Age. The Romans occupied this area up to 400 AD and there has been continuous habitation since that time. The valley is home to two of the oldest churches in Wales, those at Llanrhychwyn and Llangelynnin, which respectively date back to the 11th and 12th centuries.

Much of the Conwy valley was laid waste in the Wars of the Roses by the Earl of Pembroke, under the orders of Edward IV, the Yorkist king, following a Lancastrian attack on the town of Denbigh in 1466.

At the mouth of the Conwy as it discharges into Conwy Bay is the town of Conwy with its World Heritage Site castle – Conwy Castle and two famous bridges. One of the earliest suspension bridges by Thomas Telford now carries a footpath whilst Robert Stephenson&#x27;s tubular iron bridge still carries the main Holyhead to London railway line. A third bridge now takes road traffic, and more recently still the A55 now runs in a tunnel under the estuary.

==Water quality==
Neither the River Conwy or its tributaries are monitored for quality by Natural Resources Wales. The river is routinely polluted by Dŵr Cymru sewage treatment plants and agricultural runoff. Algae blooms are common during the summer months. The river quality tends to be acidic in the headwaters with very low concentrations of the common anions and cations.

Natural Resources Wales monitors water levels in the valley, with a view to giving flood warnings. There are measuring stations at Betws-y-coed (Cwmlanerch), Llanrwst and Trefriw.

The Conwy is noted for its salmon and sea trout, although increasing acidification in the second half of the 20th century, especially in the poorly buffered upland waters has significantly impacted upon their spawning success. The construction of an artificial fish pass in the 1990s to allow migratory salmonids access to the river above Conwy falls was intended to help mitigate the effects of acidification.

The Conwy Crossing, an immersed tube tunnel, was built under the estuary during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was opened by the Queen in October 1991. This resulted in the loss of some saltmarsh but also led to the creation of Conwy RSPB Reserve.

Since 2002 the valley has been overlooked by the turbines of the Moel Maelogan wind farm.

==Situation==
The panorama shows the mouth of the Conwy Estuary from Deganwy Castle, the original defensive position of the area. However, problems with resupply in the event of siege and its destruction by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales in 1263 to prevent it falling into King Edward&#x27;s hands, led to a new castle being built across the water in Conwy town.

<doc id="1022274" wikidata="Q3088512" url="?curid=1022274" title="National Bolshevik Front">
<text>The National Bolshevik Front (NBF; ; &quot;Natsional-bolshevistskiy front&quot;, &quot;NBF&quot;) is a Russian political party with a political program of National Bolshevism. The party was founded in 2006 by supporters of Aleksandr Dugin following a split within Eduard Limonov&#x27;s National Bolshevik Party. The NBF is affiliated with Dugin&#x27;s Eurasian Youth Union.

The &quot;National Bolshevik Front&quot; name had previously been used for multiple strands of National Bolshevism. The name was initially used by the Russian National Bolshevik Party when the party was founded by Eduard Limonov and Aleksandr Dugin in 1993. The group soon changed its name as it emerged as a political party. Although abandoned by the Russian party, the National Bolshevik Front name was still used by a loose federation of European National Bolshevik organisations. The name was also used by National Bolshevik parties in Venezuela and Bolivia.

== History and ideology==
In August 2006, the &quot;National Bolshevik Front&quot; name was taken by Alexei Golubovich for a new anti-Limonovist splinter group from the NBP that he led. This new group has links with former NBP member Aleksandr Dugin and closely cooperates with the Eurasian Youth Union, a group of young supporters of Dugin&#x27;s neo-Eurasianism.

The NBF&#x27;s founders split from the NBP as they disagreed with what they perceived to be Limonov&#x27;s policies of forging political alliances with pro-Western liberals and oligarchs in order to overthrow Vladimir Putin&#x27;s government. The NBF considered this policy to be a betrayal of the original National Bolshevik fight against Western style democracy and capitalism. In the NBF&#x27;s view, the NBP is no longer a National Bolshevik party, but rather the radical-looking wing of a wider revolutionary front supported by the enemies of Russian sovereignty.

The new NBF perceives exiled oligarchs like Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky and liberal-democratic pro-Western and pro-market political forces (such as the Union of Right Forces, Yabloko, Democratic Union and Garry Kasparov&#x27;s supporters) as Russia&#x27;s internal enemies, the external ones being perceived as NATO, American imperialism and the new world order. NBF ideology is deeply rooted in the Russian and German National Bolshevik traditions (Ernst Niekisch, Nikolay Ustryalov, the Smenavekhites and the Mladorossi movement) and they reject political and economic liberalism as well as claiming to reject ethnocentric and chauvinist nationalism.

Although it is not officially supported by NBF doctrine, xenophobia, racism and antisemitism are much more mainstreamed by the aggressive NBF when compared to the more progressive Limonovist NBP.

<doc id="1022282" wikidata="Q244762" url="?curid=1022282" title="Mari, Syria">
<text>Mari (Cuneiform: , &quot;ma-riki&quot;, modern Tell Hariri; ) was an ancient Semitic city-state in modern-day Syria. Its remains form a tell 11 kilometers north-west of Abu Kamal on the Euphrates River western bank, some 120 kilometers southeast of Deir ez-Zor. It flourished as a trade center and hegemonic state between 2900 BC and 1759 BC. The city was built in the middle of the Euphrates trade routes between Sumer in the south and the Eblaite kingdom and the Levant in the west.

Mari was first abandoned in the middle of the 26th century BC but was rebuilt and became the capital of a hegemonic East Semitic state before 2500 BC. This second Mari engaged in a long war with its rival Ebla and is known for its strong affinity with Sumerian culture. It was destroyed in the 23rd century BC by the Akkadians, who allowed the city to be rebuilt and appointed a military governor (&quot;Shakkanakku&quot;). The governors became independent with the disintegration of the Akkadian Empire, and rebuilt the city as a regional center of the Euphrates valley. The Shakkanakkus ruled Mari until the second half of the 19th century BC, when the dynasty collapsed for unknown reasons. A short time later, Mari became the capital of the Amorite Lim dynasty. The Amorite Mari lasted only a short time before it was destroyed by Babylonia in c. 1761 BC, but it survived as a small settlement under the rule of the Babylonians and the Assyrians before being abandoned and forgotten during the Hellenistic period.

The Mariotes worshiped both Semitic and Sumerian deities and established their city as a major trading center. Although the pre-Amorite periods were characterized by heavy Sumerian cultural influence, Mari was not a city of Sumerian immigrants but a Semitic-speaking nation with a dialect similar to Eblaite. The Amorites were West Semites who began to settle the area before the 21st century BC; by the Lim dynasty (c. 1830 BC), they became the dominant population in the Fertile Crescent.

Mari&#x27;s discovery in 1933 provided an important insight into the geopolitical map of ancient Mesopotamia and Syria, due to the discovery of more than 25,000 tablets explicating the state administration in the 2nd millennium BC and the nature of diplomatic relations among the political powers of the region. They also revealed the wide trading networks of the 18th century BC, which connected areas as far as Afghanistan in Southern Asia and Crete in the Mediterranean.

==Name==

Written in Cuneiform (&quot;ma-riki&quot;), the name of the city can be traced to Itūr-Mēr, an ancient storm deity of northern Mesopotamia and Syria, who was considered the tutelary deity of the city, Georges Dossin noted that the name of the city was spelled identically to that of the storm god and concluded that Mari was named after him.

==History==
===Early Bronze Age===
====First kingdom====
It is believed that Mari did not grow from a small settlement, but was founded c. 2900 BC during the Mesopotamian Early Dynastic period I as a new city to control the waterways of the Euphrates trade routes connecting the Levant with the Sumerian south. The city was built about 1 to 2 kilometers from the Euphrates river to protect it from floods, and was connected to the river by an artificial canal 7 to 10 kilometers long whose route is hard to identify today.
The city is difficult to excavate as it is buried deep under later layers of habitation. A circular flood embankment was unearthed, containing an area 300 meters in length for gardens and craftsmen&#x27;s quarters, and a defensive circular internal rampart 6.7 m thick and 8 to 10 meters high, strengthened by defensive towers. Other findings include one of the city gates, a street beginning at the center and ending at the gate, and residential houses. Mari had a central mound, but no temple or palace has been unearthed there. A large building was however excavated (with dimensions of 32 m x 25 m), seemingly with an administrative function. It had stone foundations and rooms up to 12 meters long and 6 meters wide. The city was abandoned c. 2550 BC at the end of the Early Dynastic period II, for unknown reasons.
====Second kingdom====
Around the beginning of Early Dynastic period III (earlier than 2500 BC) Mari was rebuilt and populated again. The new city kept many of the first city&#x27;s exterior features, including the internal rampart and gate. Also kept was the outer circular embankment measuring 1.9 km in diameter, which was topped by a wall two meters thick capable of protecting archers.

However, the internal urban structure was completely changed and the new city was carefully planned. First to be built were the streets that descended from the elevated center into the gates, ensuring the drainage of rain water.

At the heart of the city, a royal palace was built that also served as a temple. Four successive architectural levels from the second kingdom&#x27;s palace have been unearthed (the oldest is designated &quot;P3&quot;, while the latest is &quot;P0&quot;). The last two levels are dated to the Akkadian period. The first two levels were excavated; the findings include a temple (Enceinte Sacrée or sacred enclosure) dedicated to an unknown deity, a pillared throne room, and a hall with three double wood pillars leading to the temple.

Six smaller temples were discovered in the city, including the temple called the Massif Rouge (unknown dedication), and temples dedicated to (INANA.ZA.ZA), Ishtarat, Ishtar, Ninhursag, and Shamash. All the temples were located in the center of the city except for the Ishtar temple; the area between the Enceinte Sacrée and the Massif Rouge is considered to have been the administrative center of the high priest.

The second kingdom appears to have been a powerful and prosperous political center, its kings held the title of Lugal, and many are attested in the city, the most important source being the letter of king Enna-Dagan c. 2350 BC, which was sent to Irkab-Damu of Ebla. In it, the Mariote king mentions his predecessors and their military achievements. However, the reading of this letter is still uncertain and many interpretations have been presented by scholars.

=====Mari–Ebla war=====
The earliest attested king in the letter of Enna-Dagan is Ansud, who is mentioned as attacking Ebla, the traditional rival of Mari with whom it had a long war, and conquering many of Ebla&#x27;s cities, including the land of Belan. The next king mentioned in the letter is Saʿumu, who conquered the lands of Ra&#x27;ak and Nirum. King Kun-Damu of Ebla defeated Mari in the middle of the 25th century BC. The war continued with Išhtup-Išar of Mari&#x27;s conquest of Emar at a time of Eblaite weakness in the mid-24th century BC. King Igrish-Halam of Ebla had to pay tribute to Iblul-Il of Mari, who is mentioned in the letter, conquering many of Ebla&#x27;s cities and campaigning in the Burman region.

Enna-Dagan also received tribute; his reign fell entirely within the reign of Irkab-Damu of Ebla, who managed to defeat Mari and end the tribute. Mari defeated Ebla&#x27;s ally Nagar in year seven of the Eblaite vizier Ibrium&#x27;s term, causing the blockage of trade routes between Ebla and southern Mesopotamia via upper Mesopotamia. The war reached a climax when the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish made an alliance with Nagar and Kish to defeat Mari in a battle near Terqa. Ebla itself suffered its first destruction a few years after Terqa in c. 2300 BC, during the reign of the Mariote king Hidar. According to , Hidar was succeeded by Ishqi-Mari whose royal seal was discovered. It depicts battle scenes, causing Archi to suggest that he was responsible for the destruction of Ebla while still a general.

=====Destruction of Mari by Sargon of Akkad=====

Just a decade after Ebla&#x27;s destruction (c. 2300 BC middle chronology), Mari itself was destroyed and burned by Sargon of Akkad, as shown by one of his year names (&quot;Year in which Mari was destroyed&quot;). Michael Astour proposed the date as c. 2265 BC (short chronology). Ishqi-Mari was probably the last king of Mari before the conquests by the Akkadian Empire. Sargon of Akkad collected tribute from Mari and Elam:

====Third kingdom====

Mari was deserted for two generations before being restored by the Akkadian king Manishtushu. A governor was appointed to govern the city who held the title Shakkanakku (military governor). Akkad kept direct control over the city, which is evident by Naram-Sin of Akkad&#x27;s appointment of two of his daughters to priestly offices in the city.

=====Shakkanakku dynasty=====

The first member of the Shakkanakku dynasty on the lists is Ididish, who was appointed in c. 2266 BC. According to the lists, Ididish ruled for 60 years and was succeeded by his son=, making the position hereditary.

The third Mari followed the second city in terms of general structure, phase &quot;P0&quot; of the old royal palace was replaced by a new palace for the Shakkanakku. Another smaller palace was built in the eastern part of the city, and contained royal burials that date to the former periods. The ramparts were rebuilt and strengthened while the embankment was turned into a defensive wall that reached 10 meters in width. The former sacred inclosure was maintained, so was the temple of Ninhursag. However, the temples of Ninni-Zaza and Ishtarat disappeared, while a new temple called the &quot;temple of lions&quot; (dedicated to Dagan), was built by the Shakkanakku Ishtup-Ilum and attached to it, was a rectangular terrace that measured 40 x 20 meters for sacrifices.

Akkad disintegrated during Shar-Kali-Sharri&#x27;s reign, and Mari gained its independence, but the use of the Shakkanakku title continued during the following Third Dynasty of Ur period. A princess of Mari married the son of king Ur-Nammu of Ur, and Mari was nominally under Ur hegemony. However, the vassalage did not impede the independence of Mari, and some Shakkanakkus used the royal title Lugal in their votive inscriptions, while using the title of Shakkanakku in their correspondence with the Ur&#x27;s court. The dynasty ended for unknown reasons not long before the establishment of the next dynasty, which took place in the second half of the 19th century BC.

===Middle Bronze Age===
====Lim dynasty====
The second millennium BC in the Fertile Crescent was characterized by the expansion of the Amorites, which culminated with them dominating and ruling most of the region, including Mari which in c. 1830 BC, became the seat of the Amorite Lim dynasty under king Yaggid-Lim. However, the epigraphical and archaeological evidences showed a high degree of continuity between the Shakkanakku and the Amorite eras.

Yaggid-Lim was the ruler of Suprum before establishing himself in Mari, he entered an alliance with Ila-kabkabu of Ekallatum, but the relations between the two monarchs changed to an open war. The conflict ended with Ila-kabkabu capturing Yaggid-Lim&#x27;s heir Yahdun-Lim and according to a tablet found in Mari, Yaggid-Lim who survived Ila-kabkabu was killed by his servants. However, in c. 1820 BC Yahdun-Lim was firmly in control as king of Mari.
Yahdun-Lim started his reign by subduing seven of his rebelling tribal leaders, and rebuilding the walls of Mari and Terqa in addition to building a new fort which he named Dur-Yahdun-Lim. He then expanded west and claimed to have reached the Mediterranean, however he later had to face a rebellion by the Yaminite nomads who were centered at Tuttul, and the rebels were supported by Yamhad&#x27;s king Sumu-Epuh, whose interests were threatened by the recently established alliance between Yahdun-Lim and Eshnunna. Yahdun-Lim defeated the Yaminites but an open war with Yamhad was avoided, as the Mariote king became occupied by his rivalry with Shamshi-Adad I of Shubat-Enlil, the son of the late Ila-kabkabu. The war ended in a defeat for Mari, and Yahdun-Lim was assassinated in c. 1798 BC by his possible son Sumu-Yamam, who himself got assassinated two years after ascending the throne while Shamshi-Adad advanced and annexed Mari.

====Shamshi-Adad of Assyria and Yasmah-Adad====
Shamshi-Adad (r. 1809-1775 BC) appointed his son Yasmah-Adad on the throne of Mari, the new king married Yahdun-Lim&#x27;s daughter, while the rest of the Lim family took refuge in Yamhad, and the annexation was officially justified by what Shamshi-Adad considered sinful acts on the side of the Lim family. To strengthen his position against his new enemy Yamhad, Shamshi-Adad married Yasmah-Adad to Betlum, the daughter of Ishi-Addu of Qatna. However, Yasmah-Adad neglected his bride causing a crisis with Qatna, and he proved to be an unable leader causing the rage of his father who died in c. 1776 BC, while the armies of Yarim-Lim I of Yamhad were advancing in support of Zimri-Lim, the heir of the Lim dynasty.
====Zimri-Lim of Mari====
As Zimri-Lim advanced, a leader of the &quot;Sim&#x27;alites&quot; (Zimri-Lim&#x27;s tribe) overthrew Yasmah-Adad, opening the road for Zimri-Lim who arrived a few months after Yasmah-Adad&#x27;s escape, and married princess Shibtu the daughter of Yarim-Lim I a short time after his enthronement in c. 1776 BC. Zimri-Lim&#x27;s ascension to the throne with the help of Yarim-Lim I affected Mari&#x27;s status, Zimri-Lim referred to Yarim-Lim as his father, and the Yamhadite king was able to order Mari as the mediator between Yamhad&#x27;s main deity Hadad and Zimri-Lim, who declared himself a servant of Hadad.

Zimri-Lim started his reign with a campaign against the &quot;Yaminites&quot;, he also established alliances with Eshnunna and Hammurabi of Babylon, and sent his armies to aid the Babylonians. The new king directed his expansion policy toward the north in the Upper Khabur region, which was named , where he subjugated the local petty kingdoms in the region such as Urkesh, and , forcing them into vassalage. The expansion was met by the resistance of Qarni-Lim, the king of Andarig, whom Zimri-Lim defeated, securing the Mariote control over the region in c. 1771 BC, and the kingdom prospered as a trading center and entered a period of relative peace. Zimri-Lim&#x27;s greatest heritage was the renovation of the Royal Palace, which was expanded greatly to contain 275 rooms, exquisite artifacts such as &quot;The Goddess of the Vase&quot; statue, and a royal archive that contained thousands of tablets.

====Babylonian period====
The relations with Babylon worsened with a dispute over the city of Hīt that consumed much time in negotiations, during which a war against Elam involved both kingdoms in c. 1765 BC. Finally, the kingdom was invaded by Hammurabi who defeated Zimri-Lim in battle in c. 1761 BC and ended the Lim dynasty, while Terqa became the capital of a rump state named the Kingdom of Hana. In the south, the region of Suhum became a Babylonian province.

Mari survived the destruction and rebelled against Babylon in c. 1759 BC, causing Hammurabi to destroy the whole city. However, by an act of mercy Hammurabi may have allowed Mari to survive as a small village under Babylonian administration (according to Marc Van De Mieroop).

===Late Bronze Age===
Later, Mari became part of Assyria and was listed among the territories conquered by the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I (reigned 1243–1207 BC). Afterward, Mari constantly changed hands between Assyria and Babylon.

===Iron Age===
In the middle of the eleventh century BC, Mari became part of Hana whose king Tukulti-Mer took the title &quot;king of Mari&quot; and rebelled against Assyria, causing the Assyrian king Ashur-bel-kala (r. 1074-1056 BC) to attack the city. Mari came firmly under the authority of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and was assigned in the first half of the 8th century BC to a certain Nergal-Erish to govern under the authority of king Adad-Nirari III (r. 810–783 BC).
In c. 760 BC, Shamash-Risha-Usur, an autonomous governor ruling parts of the upper middle Euphrates under the nominal authority of Ashur-dan III, styled himself the governor of the lands of Suhu and Mari, so did his son Ninurta-Kudurri-Usur. However, by that time, Mari was known to be located in the so-called Land of Laqe, making it unlikely that the Usur family actually controlled it, and suggesting that the title was employed out of historical reasons.

The city continued as a small settlement until the Hellenistic period before disappearing from records.

===Modern history===
By 2015, ISIS devastated and looted systematically the site and specially the royal palace. It was one of the first archaeological sites to be occupied by this group.

==People, language and government==
The founders of the first city may have been Sumerians or more probably East Semitic speaking people from Terqa in the north. I. J. Gelb relates Mari&#x27;s foundation with the Kish civilization, which was a cultural entity of East Semitic speaking populations, that stretched from the center of Mesopotamia to Ebla in the western Levant.

At its height, the second city was the home of about 40,000 people. This population was East-Semitic speaking one, and used a dialect much similar to the language of Ebla (the Eblaite language), while the Shakkanakku period had an East-Semitic Akkadian speaking population. West Semitic names started to be attested in Mari from the second kingdom era, and by the middle Bronze-Age, the west Semitic Amorite tribes became the majority of the pastoral groups in the middle Euphrates and Khabur valleys. Amorite names started to be observed in the city toward the end of the Shakkanakku period, even among the ruling dynasty members.
During the Lim era, the population became predominantly Amorite but also included Akkadian named people, and although the Amorite language became the dominant tongue, Akkadian remained the language of writing. The pastoral Amorites in Mari were called the &quot;Haneans&quot;, a term that indicate nomads in general, those Haneans were split into the &quot;Yaminites&quot; (sons of the south) and &quot;Sim&#x27;alites&quot; (sons of the north), with the ruling house belonging to the &quot;Sim&#x27;al&quot; branch. The kingdom was also a home to tribes of Suteans who lived in the district of Terqa.

Mari was an absolute monarchy, with the king controlling every aspect of the administration, helped by the scribes who played the role of administrators. During the Lim era, Mari was divided into four provinces in addition to the capital, the provincial seats were located at Terqa, Saggarâtum, Qaṭṭunān and Tuttul. Each province had its own bureaucracy, the government supplied the villagers with ploughs and agricultural equipments, in return for a share in the harvest.

==Culture and religion==

The first and second kingdoms were heavily influenced by the Sumerian south. The society was led by an urban oligarchy, and the citizens were well known for elaborate hair styles and dress. The calendar was based on a solar year divided into twelve months, and was the same calendar used in Ebla &quot;the old Eblaite calendar&quot;. Scribes wrote in Sumerian language and the art was indistinguishable from Sumerian art, so was the architectural style.

Mesopotamian influence continued to affect Mari&#x27;s culture during the Amorite period, which is evident in the Babylonian scribal style used in the city. However, it was less influential than the former periods and a distinct Syrian style prevailed, which is noticeable in the seals of kings, which reflect a clear Syrian origin. The society was a tribal one, it consisted mostly of farmers and nomads (Haneans), and in contrast to Mesopotamia, the temple had a minor role in everyday life as the power was mostly invested in the palace. Women enjoyed a relative equality to men, queen Shibtu ruled in her husband&#x27;s name while he was away, and had an extensive administrative role and authority over her husband&#x27;s highest officials.

The Pantheon included both Sumerian and Semitic deities, and throughout most of its history, Dagan was Mari&#x27;s head of the Pantheon, while Mer was the patron deity. Other deities included the Semitic deities; Ishtar the goddess of fertility, Athtar, and Shamash, the Sun god who was regarded among the city most important deities, and believed to be all-knowing and all-seeing. Sumerian deities included Ninhursag, Dumuzi, Enki, Anu, and Enlil. Prophecy had an important role for the society, temples included prophets, who gave council to the king and participated in the religious festivals.

==Economy==
The first Mari provided the oldest wheel workshop yet discovered in Syria, and was a center of bronze metallurgy. The city also contained districts devoted to smelting, dyeing, and pottery manufacture, using charcoal brought by river boats from the upper Khabur and Euphrates area.

The second kingdom&#x27;s economy was based on both agriculture and trade. It was centralized and directed through a communal organization, with grain stored in communal granaries and distributed according to social status. The organization also controlled the animal herds in the kingdom. Some groups were direct beneficiaries of the palace instead of the communal organization, including the metal and textile producers and military officials. Ebla was an important trading partner and rival, Mari&#x27;s position made it an important trading center astride the road linking the Levant and Mesopotamia.

The Amorite Mari maintained the older aspects of the economy, still largely based on irrigated agriculture along the Euphrates valley. The city remained a trading center for merchants from Babylonia and other kingdoms, with goods from the south and east transported on riverboats bound for the north, northwest and west. The main trade was metals and tin from the Iranian Plateau exported west as far as Crete. Other goods included copper from Cyprus, silver from Anatolia, wood from Lebanon, gold from Egypt, olive oil, wine, and textiles, and even precious stones from modern Afghanistan.

==Excavations and archive==

Mari was discovered in 1933, on the eastern flank of Syria, near the Iraqi border. A Bedouin tribe was digging through a mound called Tell Hariri for a gravestone that would be used for a recently deceased tribesman, when they came across a headless statue. After the news reached the French authorities currently in control of Syria, the report was investigated, and digging on the site was started on December 14, 1933, by archaeologists from the Louvre in Paris. The location of the fragment was excavated, revealing the temple of Ishtar, which led to the commencing of the full scale excavations. Mari was classified by the archaeologists as the &quot;most westerly outpost of Sumerian culture&quot;.

Since the beginning of excavations, over 25,000 clay tablets in Akkadian language written in cuneiform were discovered. Finds from the excavation are on display in the Louvre, the National Museum of Aleppo, the National Museum of Damascus, and the Deir ez-Zor Museum. In the latter, the southern façade of the &quot;Court of the Palms&quot; room from Zimri-Lim&#x27;s palace has been reconstructed, including the wall paintings.

Mari has been excavated in annual campaigns in 1933–1939, 1951–1956, and since 1960. André Parrot conducted the first 21 seasons up to 1974, and was followed by (1979–2004), and Pascal Butterlin (starting in 2005). A journal devoted to the site, released in 8 volumes between 1982 and 1997, was &quot;Mari: Annales de recherches interdisciplinaires&quot;. Archaeologists have tried to determine how many layers the site descends, according to French archaeologist André Parrot, &quot;each time a vertical probe was commenced in order to trace the site&#x27;s history down to virgin soil, such important discoveries were made that horizontal digging had to be resumed.&quot;

===Mari tablets===
Over 25,000 tablets were found in the burnt library of Zimri-Lim written in Akkadian from a period of 50 years between circa 1800 – 1750 BC. They give information about the kingdom, its customs, and the names of people who lived during that time. More than 3000 are letters, the remainder includes administrative, economic, and judicial texts. Almost all the tablets found were dated to the last 50 years of Mari&#x27;s independence, and most have now been published. The language of the texts is official Akkadian, but proper names and hints in syntax show that the common language of Mari&#x27;s inhabitants was Northwest Semitic. Six of the tablets found were in the Hurrian language.

==Current situation==
Excavations stopped from 2011 as a result of the Syrian Civil War and have not restarted. The site came under the control of armed gangs and suffered large scale looting. A 2014 official report revealed that robbers were focusing on the royal palace, the public baths, the temple of Ishtar, and the temple of Dagan. Based on satellite imagery, looting continued until at least 2017.

<text>In abstract algebra, a derivative algebra is an algebraic structure of the signature

where 

:&lt;&quot;A&quot;, ·, +, &#x27;, 0, 1&gt; 

is a Boolean algebra and D is a unary operator, the derivative operator, satisfying the identities:

# &quot;x&quot;DD ≤ &quot;x&quot; + &quot;x&quot;D 
# (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;)D = &quot;x&quot;D + &quot;y&quot;D. 

xD is called the [[derivative]] of x. Derivative algebras provide an algebraic abstraction of the [[derived set (mathematics)|derived set]] operator in topology. They also play the same role for the modal logic &quot;wK4&quot; = &quot;K&quot; + (&quot;p&quot;∧□&quot;p&quot; → □□&quot;p&quot;) that Boolean algebras play for ordinary propositional logic.

<text>Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical, fictional, or philosophical discourse. It aims to understand the nature of gender inequality. It examines women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s social roles, experiences, interests, chores, and feminist politics in a variety of fields, such as anthropology and sociology, communication, media studies, psychoanalysis, political theory, home economics, literature, education, and philosophy.

Feminist theory often focuses on analyzing gender inequality. Themes often explored in feminist theory include discrimination, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, patriarchy, stereotyping, art history and contemporary art, and aesthetics.

== History ==
&quot;The Changing Woman&quot; is a Navajo myth that gave credit to a woman who, in the end, populated the world. By the 1790s, the leading feminist voice in both the U.K. and U.S. was Mary Wollstonecraft, whose &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792) was influenced by the lesser-known American Judith Sargent Murray. Both women asserted that the best route to improving women&#x27;s condition is education. Their ideas influenced American Charles Brockden Brown, who wrote &quot;Dialogues of Alcuin&quot; in 1797. The Anglophone world saw no feminist theory of note until &quot;Men and Women: Brief Hypothesis Concerning the Difference in their Genius&quot; (1824) by American John Neal, who repeated Wollstonecraft&#x27;s and Murray&#x27;s theories, but added the assertion that women are unlike, but not inferior to men. This and other essays by Neal in the 1820s filled an intellectual gap between female scholars in the 1790s and those surrounding the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention. As a male writer insulated from many common forms of attack against female feminist thinkers, Neal&#x27;s advocacy was crucial in bringing the field back into the mainstream in the U.K. and the U.S. By the time of the convention, writing by Neal, Sarah Grimké, and Margaret Fuller had solidified ideas from sporadic publications over the previous sixty years into a movement that reached a wider audience.

In 1851, Sojourner Truth addressed women&#x27;s rights issues through her publication, &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman&quot;. Sojourner Truth addressed the issue of women having limited rights due to men&#x27;s flawed perception of women. Truth argued that if a woman of color can perform tasks that were supposedly limited to men, then any woman of any color could perform those same tasks. After her arrest for illegally voting, Susan B. Anthony gave a speech within court in which she addressed the issues of language within the constitution documented in her publication, &quot;Speech after Arrest for Illegal voting&quot; in 1872. Anthony questioned the authoritative principles of the constitution and its male-gendered language. She raised the question of why women are accountable to be punished under law but they cannot use the law for their own protection (women could not vote, own property, nor maintain custody of themselves in marriage). She also critiqued the constitution for its male-gendered language and questioned why women should have to abide by laws that do not specify women.

Nancy Cott makes a distinction between &quot;modern feminism&quot; and its antecedents, particularly the struggle for suffrage. In the United States she places the turning point in the decades before and after women obtained the vote in 1920 (1910–1930). She argues that the prior &quot;woman movement&quot; was primarily about woman as a &quot;universal&quot; entity, whereas over this 20-year period it transformed itself into one primarily concerned with social differentiation, attentive to &quot;individuality&quot; and diversity. New issues dealt more with woman&#x27;s condition as a social construct, gender identity, and relationships within and between genders. Politically, this represented a shift from an ideological alignment comfortable with the right, to one more radically associated with the left.

Susan Kingsley Kent says that Freudian patriarchy was responsible for the diminished profile of feminism in the inter-war years, others such as Juliet Mitchell consider this to be
overly simplistic since Freudian theory is not wholly incompatible with feminism. Some feminist scholarship shifted away from the need to establish the origins of family, and towards analyzing the process of patriarchy. In the immediate postwar period, Simone de Beauvoir stood in opposition to an image of &quot;the woman in the home&quot;. De Beauvoir provided an existentialist dimension to feminism with the publication of &quot;Le Deuxième Sexe&quot; (&quot;The Second Sex&quot;) in 1949.
As the title implies, the starting point is the implicit inferiority of women, and the first question de Beauvoir asks is &quot;what is a woman&quot;?
A woman she realizes is always perceived of as the &quot;other&quot;, &quot;she is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her&quot;. In this book and her essay, &quot;Woman: Myth &amp; Reality&quot;, de Beauvoir anticipates Betty Friedan in seeking to demythologize the male concept of woman. &quot;A myth invented by men to confine women to their oppressed state. For women, it is not a question of asserting themselves as women, but of becoming full-scale human beings.&quot; &quot;One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman&quot;, or as Toril Moi puts it &quot;a woman defines herself through the way she lives her embodied situation in the world, or in other words, through the way in which she makes something of what the world makes of her&quot;. Therefore, the woman must regain subject, to escape her defined role as &quot;other&quot;, as a Cartesian point of departure.
In her examination of myth, she appears as one who does not accept any special privileges for women. Ironically, feminist philosophers have had to extract de Beauvoir herself from out of the shadow of Jean-Paul Sartre to fully appreciate her. While more philosopher and novelist than activist, she did sign one of the &quot;Mouvement de Libération des Femmes&quot; manifestos.

The resurgence of feminist activism in the late 1960s was accompanied by an emerging literature of concerns for the earth and spirituality, and environmentalism. This, in turn, created an atmosphere conducive to reigniting the study of and debate on matricentricity, as a rejection of determinism, such as Adrienne Rich and Marilyn French while for socialist feminists like Evelyn Reed, patriarchy held the properties of capitalism. Feminist psychologists, such as Jean Baker Miller, sought to bring a feminist analysis to previous psychological theories, proving that &quot;there was nothing wrong with women, but rather with the way modern culture viewed them&quot;.

Elaine Showalter describes the development of feminist theory as having a number of phases. The first she calls &quot;feminist critique&quot; – where the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls &quot;Gynocritics&quot; – where the &quot;woman is producer of textual meaning&quot; including &quot;the psychodynamics of female creativity; linguistics and the problem of a female language; the trajectory of the individual or collective female literary career and literary history&quot;. The last phase she calls &quot;gender theory&quot; – where the &quot;ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system&quot; are explored&quot;. This model has been criticized by Toril Moi who sees it as an essentialist and deterministic model for female subjectivity. She also criticized it for not taking account of the situation for women outside the west.
From the 1970s onwards, psychoanalytical ideas that have been arising in the field of French feminism have gained a decisive influence on feminist theory. Feminist psychoanalysis deconstructed the phallic hypotheses regarding the Unconscious. Julia Kristeva, Bracha Ettinger and Luce Irigaray developed specific notions concerning unconscious sexual difference, the feminine, and motherhood, with wide implications for film and literature analysis.

In the 1990s and the first decades of the 21st century, intersectionality played a major role in feminist theory, leading to the development of transfeminism and queer feminism and the consolidation of Black, anti-racist and postcolonial feminisms, among others. The rise of the fourth wave in the 2010s led to new discussions on sexual violence, consent and body positivity, as well as a deepening of intersectional perspectives. Simultaneously, feminist philosophy and anthropology saw a rise in new materialist, affect-oriented, posthumanist and ecofeminist perspectives.

== Disciplines ==

There are a number of distinct feminist disciplines, in which experts in other areas apply feminist techniques and principles to their own fields. Additionally, these are also debates which shape feminist theory and they can be applied interchangeably in the arguments of feminist theorists.

===Bodies===
In Western thought, the body has been historically associated solely with women, whereas men have been associated with the mind. Susan Bordo, a modern feminist philosopher, in her writings elaborates the dualistic nature of the mind/body connection by examining the early philosophies of Aristotle, Hegel, and Descartes, revealing how such distinguishing binaries such as spirit/matter and male activity/female passivity have worked to solidify gender characteristics and categorization. Bordo goes on to point out that while men have historically been associated with the intellect and the mind or spirit, women have long been associated with the body, the subordinated, negatively imbued term in the mind/body dichotomy.
The notion of the body (but not the mind) being associated with women has served as a justification to deem women as property, objects, and exchangeable commodities (among men). For example, women&#x27;s bodies have been objectified throughout history through the changing ideologies of fashion, diet, exercise programs, cosmetic surgery, childbearing, etc. This contrasts to men&#x27;s role as a moral agent, responsible for working or fighting in bloody wars.
The race and class of a woman can determine whether her body will be treated as decoration and protected, which is associated with middle or upper-class women&#x27;s bodies. On the other hand, the other body is recognized for its use in labor and exploitation which is generally associated with women&#x27;s bodies in the working-class or with women of color.
Second-wave feminist activism has argued for reproductive rights and choice. The women&#x27;s health movement and lesbian feminism are also associated with this Bodies debate.

=== The standard and contemporary sex and gender system ===

The standard sex determination and gender model consists of evidence based on the determined sex and gender of every individual and serve as norms for societal life. The model that the sex-determination of a person exists within a male/female dichotomy, giving importance to genitals and how they are formed via chromosomes and DNA-binding proteins (such as the sex-determining region Y genes), which are responsible for sending sex-determined initialization and completion signals to and from the biological sex-determination system in fetuses. Occasionally, variations occur during the sex-determining process, resulting in intersex conditions. The standard model defines gender as a social understanding/ideology that defines what behaviors, actions, and appearances are normal for males and females. Studies into biological sex-determining systems also have begun working towards connecting certain gender conducts such as behaviors, actions, and desires with sex-determinism.

====Socially-biasing children sex and gender system====

The socially biasing children&#x27;s sex and gender model broadens the horizons of the sex and gender ideologies. It revises the ideology of sex to be a social construct that is not limited to either male or female. The Intersex Society of North America which explains that &quot;nature doesn&#x27;t decide where the category of &#x27;male&#x27; ends and the category of &#x27;intersex&#x27; begins, or where the category of &#x27;intersex&#x27; ends and the category of &#x27;female&#x27; begins. Humans decide. Humans (today, typically doctors) decide how small a penis has to be, or how unusual a combination of parts has to be before it counts as intersex&quot;. Therefore, sex is not a biological/natural construct but a social one instead since, society and doctors decide on what it means to be male, female, or intersex in terms of sex chromosomes and genitals, in addition to their personal judgment on who or how one passes as specific sex. The ideology of gender remains a social construct but is not as strict and fixed. Instead, gender is easily malleable and is forever changing. One example of where the standard definition of gender alters with time happens to be depicted in Sally Shuttleworth&#x27;s &quot;Female Circulation&quot; in which the &quot;abasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England&quot;. In other words, this quote shows what it meant growing up into the roles of a female (gender/roles) changed from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, the contemporary sex gender model is accurate because both sex and gender are rightly seen as social constructs inclusive of the wide spectrum of sexes and genders and in which nature and nurture are interconnected.

===Epistemologies===
Questions about how knowledge is produced, generated, and distributed have been central to Western conceptions of feminist theory and discussions on feminist epistemology. One debate proposes such questions as &quot;Are there &#x27;women&#x27;s ways of knowing&#x27; and &#x27;women&#x27;s knowledge&#x27;?&quot; And &quot;How does the knowledge women produce about themselves differ from that produced by patriarchy?&quot; Feminist theorists have also proposed the &quot;feminist standpoint knowledge&quot; which attempts to replace the &quot;view from nowhere&quot; with the model of knowing that expels the &quot;view from women&#x27;s lives&quot;. A feminist approach to epistemology seeks to establish knowledge production from a woman&#x27;s perspective. It theorizes that from personal experience comes knowledge which helps each individual look at things from a different insight.

It is central to feminism that women are systematically subordinated, and bad faith exists when women surrender their agency to this subordination (for example, acceptance of religious beliefs that a man is the dominant party in a marriage by the will of God). Simone de Beauvoir labels such women &quot;mutilated&quot; and &quot;immanent&quot;.

===Intersectionality===

Intersectionality is the examination of various ways in which people are oppressed, based on the relational web of dominating factors of race, sex, class, nation and sexual orientation. Intersectionality &quot;describes the simultaneous, multiple, overlapping, and contradictory systems of power that shape our lives and political options&quot;. While this theory can be applied to all people, and more particularly all women, it is specifically mentioned and studied within the realms of black feminism. Patricia Hill Collins argues that black women in particular, have a unique perspective on the oppression of the world as unlike white women, they face both racial and gender oppression simultaneously, among other factors. This debate raises the issue of understanding the oppressive lives of women that are not only shaped by gender alone but by other elements such as racism, classism, ageism, heterosexism, ableism etc.

===Language===

In this debate, women writers have addressed the issues of masculinized writing through male gendered language that may not serve to accommodate the literary understanding of women&#x27;s lives. Such masculinized language that feminist theorists address is the use of, for example, &quot;God the Father&quot;, which is looked upon as a way of designating the sacred as solely men (or, in other words, biblical language glorifies men through all of the masculine pronouns like &quot;he&quot; and &quot;him&quot; and addressing God as a &quot;He&quot;). Feminist theorists attempt to reclaim and redefine women through a deeper thinking of language. For example, feminist theorists have used the term &quot;womyn&quot; instead of &quot;women&quot;. Some feminist theorists have suggested using neutral terminology when naming jobs (for example, police officer versus policeman or mail carrier versus mailman). Some feminist theorists have reclaimed and redefined such words as &quot;dyke&quot; and &quot;bitch&quot;.

===Psychology===
Feminist psychology is a form of psychology centered on societal structures and gender. Feminist psychology critiques the fact that historically psychological research has been done from a male perspective with the view that males are the norm. Feminist psychology is oriented on the values and principles of feminism. It incorporates gender and the ways women are affected by issues resulting from it. Ethel Dench Puffer Howes was one of the first women to enter the field of psychology. She was the executive secretary of the National College Equal Suffrage League in 1914.

One major psychological theory, &quot;relational-cultural theory&quot;, is based on the work of Jean Baker Miller, whose book &quot;Toward a New Psychology of Women&quot; proposes that &quot;growth-fostering relationships are a central human necessity and that disconnections are the source of psychological problems&quot;. Inspired by Betty Friedan&#x27;s &quot;Feminine Mystique&quot;, and other feminist classics from the 1960s, relational-cultural theory proposes that &quot;isolation is one of the most damaging human experiences and is best treated by reconnecting with other people&quot;, and that a therapist should &quot;foster an atmosphere of empathy and acceptance for the patient, even at the cost of the therapist&#x27;s neutrality&quot;. The theory is based on clinical observations and sought to prove that &quot;there was nothing wrong with women, but rather with the way modern culture viewed them&quot;.

====Psychoanalysis====

Psychoanalytic feminism and feminist psychoanalysis are based on Freud and his psychoanalytic theories, but they also supply an important critique of it. It maintains that gender is not biological but is based on the psycho-sexual development of the individual, but also that sexual difference and gender are different notions. Psychoanalytical feminists believe that gender inequality comes from early childhood experiences, which lead men to believe themselves to be masculine, and women to believe themselves feminine. It is further maintained that gender leads to a social system that is dominated by males, which in turn influences the individual psycho-sexual development. As a solution it was suggested by some to avoid the gender-specific structuring of the society coeducation. From the last 30 years of the 20th century, the contemporary French psychoanalytical theories concerning the feminine, that refer to sexual difference rather than to gender, with psychoanalysts like Julia Kristeva, Maud Mannoni, Luce Irigaray, and Bracha Ettinger that invented the concept matrixial space and matrixial Feminist ethics, have largely influenced not only feminist theory but also the understanding of the subject in philosophy, art, aesthetics and ethics and the general field of psychoanalysis itself. These French psychoanalysts are mainly post-Lacanian. Other feminist psychoanalysts and feminist theorists whose contributions have enriched the field through an engagement with psychoanalysis are Jessica Benjamin, Jacqueline Rose, Ranjana Khanna, and Shoshana Felman.
===Literary theory===
Feminist literary criticism is literary criticism informed by feminist theories or politics. Its history has been varied, from classic works of female authors such as George Eliot, Virginia Woolf, and Margaret Fuller to recent theoretical work in women&#x27;s studies and gender studies by &quot;third-wave&quot; authors.

In the most general terms, feminist literary criticism before the 1970s was concerned with the politics of women&#x27;s authorship and the representation of women&#x27;s condition within literature. Since the arrival of more complex conceptions of gender and subjectivity, feminist literary criticism has taken a variety of new routes. It has considered gender in the terms of Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, as part of the deconstruction of existing power relations.

=== Film theory ===

Many feminist film critics, such as Laura Mulvey, have pointed to the &quot;male gaze&quot; that predominates in classical Hollywood film making. Through the use of various film techniques, such as shot reverse shot, the viewers are led to align themselves with the point of view of a male protagonist. Notably, women function as objects of this gaze far more often than as proxies for the spectator. Feminist film theory of the last twenty years is heavily influenced by the general transformation in the field of aesthetics, including the new options of articulating the gaze, offered by psychoanalytical French feminism, like Bracha Ettinger&#x27;s feminine, maternal and matrixial gaze.

===Art history===
Linda Nochlin and Griselda Pollock are prominent art historians writing on contemporary and modern artists and articulating Art history from a feminist perspective since the 1970s. Pollock works with French psychoanalysis, and in particular with Kristeva&#x27;s and Ettinger&#x27;s theories, to offer new insights into art history and contemporary art with special regard to questions of trauma and trans-generation memory in the works of women artists. Other prominent feminist art historians include: Norma Broude and Mary Garrard; Amelia Jones; Mieke Bal; Carol Duncan; Lynda Nead; Lisa Tickner; Tamar Garb; Hilary Robinson; Katy Deepwell.

===History===

Feminist history refers to the re-reading and re-interpretation of history from a feminist perspective. It is not the same as the history of feminism, which outlines the origins and evolution of the feminist movement. It also differs from women&#x27;s history, which focuses on the role of women in historical events. The goal of feminist history is to explore and illuminate the female viewpoint of history through rediscovery of female writers, artists, philosophers, etc., in order to recover and demonstrate the significance of women&#x27;s voices and choices in the past.

===Geography===

Feminist geography is often considered part of a broader postmodern approach to the subject which is not primarily concerned with the development of conceptual theory in itself but rather focuses on the real experiences of individuals and groups in their own localities, upon the geographies that they live in within their own communities. In addition to its analysis of the real world, it also critiques existing geographical and social studies, arguing that academic traditions are delineated by patriarchy, and that contemporary studies which do not confront the nature of previous work reinforce the male bias of academic study.

===Philosophy===

The Feminist philosophy refers to a philosophy approached from a feminist perspective. Feminist philosophy involves attempts to use methods of philosophy to further the cause of the feminist movements, it also tries to criticize and/or reevaluate the ideas of traditional philosophy from within a feminist view. This critique stems from the dichotomy Western philosophy has conjectured with the mind and body phenomena. There is no specific school for feminist philosophy like there has been in regard to other theories. This means that Feminist philosophers can be found in the analytic and continental traditions, and the different viewpoints taken on philosophical issues with those traditions. Feminist philosophers also have many different viewpoints taken on philosophical issues within those traditions. Feminist philosophers who are feminists can belong to many different varieties of feminism. The writings of Judith Butler, Rosi Braidotti, Donna Haraway, Bracha Ettinger and Avital Ronell are the most significant psychoanalytically informed influences on contemporary feminist philosophy.

===Sexology===

Feminist sexology is an offshoot of traditional studies of sexology that focuses on the intersectionality of sex and gender in relation to the sexual lives of women. Feminist sexology shares many principles with the wider field of sexology; in particular, it does not try to prescribe a certain path or &quot;normality&quot; for women&#x27;s sexuality, but only observe and note the different and varied ways in which women express their sexuality. Looking at sexuality from a feminist point of view creates connections between the different aspects of a person&#x27;s sexual life.

From feminists&#x27; perspectives, sexology, which is the study of human sexuality and sexual relationship, relates to the intersectionality of gender, race and sexuality. Men have dominant power and control over women in the relationship, and women are expected to hide their true feeling about sexual behaviors. Women of color face even more sexual violence in the society. Some countries in Africa and Asia even practice female genital cutting, controlling women&#x27;s sexual desire and limiting their sexual behavior. Moreover, Bunch, the women&#x27;s and human rights activist, states that society used to see lesbianism as a threat to male supremacy and to the political relationships between men and women. Therefore, in the past, people viewed being a lesbian as a sin and made it death penalty. Even today, many people still discriminate homosexuals. Many lesbians hide their sexuality and face even more sexual oppression.

===Monosexual paradigm===

Monosexual Paradigm is a term coined by Blasingame, a self-identified African American, bisexual female. Blasingame used this term to address the lesbian and gay communities who turned a blind eye to the dichotomy that oppressed bisexuals from both heterosexual and homosexual communities. This oppression negatively affects the gay and lesbian communities more so than the heterosexual community due to its contradictory exclusiveness of bisexuals. 
Blasingame argued that in reality dichotomies are inaccurate to the representation of individuals because nothing is truly black or white, straight or gay. Her main argument is that biphobia is the central message of two roots; internalized heterosexism and racism. Internalized heterosexism is described in the monosexual paradigm in which the binary states that you are either straight or gay and nothing in between. Gays and lesbians accept this internalized heterosexism by morphing into the monosexial paradigm and favoring single attraction and opposing attraction for both sexes. Blasingame described this favoritism as an act of horizontal hostility, where oppressed groups fight amongst themselves. Racism is described in the monosexual paradigm as a dichotomy where individuals are either black or white, again nothing in between. The issue of racism comes into fruition in regards to the bisexuals coming out process, where risks of coming out vary on a basis of anticipated community reaction and also in regards to the norms among bisexual leadership, where class status and race factor predominately over sexual orientation.

===Politics===

Feminist political theory is a recently emerging field in political science focusing on gender and feminist themes within the state, institutions and policies. It questions the &quot;modern political theory, dominated by universalistic liberalist thought, which claims indifference to gender or other identity differences and has therefore taken its time to open up to such concerns&quot;.

Feminist perspectives entered international relations in the late 1980s, at about the same time as the end of the Cold War. This time was not a coincidence because the last forty years the conflict between US and USSR had been the dominant agenda of international politics. After the Cold War, there was continuing relative peace between the main powers. Soon, many new issues appeared on international relation&#x27;s agenda. More attention was also paid to social movements. Indeed, in those times feminist approaches also used to depict the world politics. Feminists started to emphasize that while women have always been players in international system, their participation has frequently been associated with non-governmental settings such as social movements. However, they could also participate in inter-state decision-making process as men did. Until more recently, the role of women in international politics has been confined to being the wives of diplomats, nannies who go abroad to find work and support their family, or sex workers trafficked across international boundaries. Women&#x27;s contributions has not been seen in the areas where hard power plays significant role such as military. Nowadays, women are gaining momentum in the sphere of international relations in areas of government, diplomacy, academia, etc.. Despite barriers to more senior roles, women currently hold 11.1 percent of the seats in the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and 10.8 percent in the House. In the U.S. Department of State, women make up 29 percent of the chiefs of mission, and 29 percent of senior foreign positions at USAID. In contrast, women are profoundly impacted by decisions the statepersons make.

=== Economics ===
Feminist economics broadly refers to a developing branch of economics that applies feminist insights and critiques to economics. However, in recent decades, feminists like for example Katrine Marçal, author of &quot;Who Cooked Adam Smith&#x27;s Dinner?&quot; has also taken up a critique of economics. Research in feminist economics is often interdisciplinary, critical, or heterodox. It encompasses debates about the relationship between feminism and economics on many levels: from applying mainstream economic methods to under-researched &quot;women&#x27;s&quot; areas, to questioning how mainstream economics values the reproductive sector, to deeply philosophical critiques of economic epistemology and methodology.

One prominent issue that feminist economists investigate is how the gross domestic product (GDP) does not adequately measure unpaid labor predominantly performed by women, such as housework, childcare, and eldercare. Feminist economists have also challenged and exposed the rhetorical approach of mainstream economics. They have made critiques of many basic assumptions of mainstream economics, including the &quot;Homo economicus&quot; model. In the &quot;Houseworker&#x27;s Handbook&quot; Betsy Warrior presents a cogent argument that the reproduction and domestic labor of women form the foundation of economic survival; although, unremunerated and not included in the GDP. According to Warrior:Economics, as it&#x27;s presented today, lacks any basis in reality as it leaves out the very foundation of economic life. That foundation is built on women&#x27;s labor; first her reproductive labor which produces every new laborer (and the first commodity, which is mother&#x27;s milk and which nurtures every new &quot;consumer/laborer&quot;); secondly, women&#x27;s labor composed of cleaning, cooking, negotiating social stability and nurturing, which prepares for market and maintains each laborer. This constitutes women&#x27;s continuing industry enabling laborers to occupy every position in the work force. Without this fundamental labor and commodity there would be no economic activity.Warrior also notes that the unacknowledged income of men from illegal activities like arms, drugs and human trafficking, political graft, religious emoluments and various other undisclosed activities provide a rich revenue stream to men, which further invalidates GDP figures. Even in underground economies where women predominate numerically, like trafficking in humans, prostitution and domestic servitude, only a tiny fraction of the pimp&#x27;s revenue filters down to the women and children he deploys. Usually the amount spent on them is merely for the maintenance of their lives and, in the case of those prostituted, some money may be spent on clothing and such accouterments as will make them more salable to the pimp&#x27;s clients. For instance, focusing on just the U.S., according to a government sponsored report by the Urban Institute in 2014, &quot;A street prostitute in Dallas may make as little as $5 per sex act. But pimps can take in $33,000 a week in Atlanta, where the sex business brings in an estimated $290 million per year.&quot;

Proponents of this theory have been instrumental in creating alternative models, such as the capability approach and incorporating gender into the analysis of economic data to affect policy. Marilyn Power suggests that feminist economic methodology can be broken down into five categories.

===Legal theory===

Feminist legal theory is based on the feminist view that law&#x27;s treatment of women in relation to men has not been equal or fair. The goals of feminist legal theory, as defined by leading theorist Clare Dalton, consist of understanding and exploring the female experience, figuring out if law and institutions oppose females, and figuring out what changes can be committed to. This is to be accomplished through studying the connections between the law and gender as well as applying feminist analysis to concrete areas of law.

Feminist legal theory stems from the inadequacy of the current structure to account for discrimination women face, especially discrimination based on multiple, intersecting identities. Kimberlé Crenshaw&#x27;s work is central to feminist legal theory, particularly her article &quot;Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist Politics&quot;. &quot;DeGraffenreid v. General Motors&quot; is an example of such a case. In this instance, the court ruled the plaintiffs, five Black women including Emma DeGraffenreid, who were employees of General Motors, were not eligible to file a complaint on the grounds they, as black women, were not &quot;a special class to be protected from discrimination&quot;. The ruling in &quot;DeGraffenreid&quot; against the plaintiff revealed the courts inability to understand intersectionality&#x27;s role in discrimination. &quot;Moore v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc.&quot; is another ruling, which serves to reify the persistent discrediting of intersectionality as a factor in discrimination. In the case of &quot;Moore&quot;, the plaintiff brought forth statistical evidence revealing a disparity in promotions to upper-level and supervisory jobs between men and women and, to a lesser extent, between Black and white men. Ultimately, the court denied the plaintiff the ability to represent all Blacks and all females. The decision dwindled the pool of statistical information the plaintiff could pull from and limited the evidence only to that of Black women, which is a ruling in direct contradiction to &quot;DeGraffenreid&quot;. Further, because the plaintiff originally claimed discrimination as a Black female rather than, more generally, as a female the court stated it had concerns whether the plaintiff could &quot;adequately represent white female employees&quot;. &quot;Payne v. Travenol&quot; serves as yet another example of the courts inconsistency when dealing with issues revolving around intersections of race and sex. The plaintiffs in &quot;Payne&quot;, two Black females, filed suit against Travenol on behalf of both Black men and women on the grounds the pharmaceutical plant practiced racial discrimination. The court ruled the plaintiffs could not adequately represent Black males; however, they did allow the admittance of statistical evidence, which was inclusive of all Black employees. Despite the more favorable outcome after it was found there was extensive racial discrimination, the courts decided the benefits of the ruling – back pay and constructive seniority – would not be extended to Black males employed by the company. &quot;Moore&quot; contends Black women cannot adequately represent white women on issues of sex discrimination, &quot;Payne&quot; suggests Black women cannot adequately represent Black men on issues of race discrimination, and &quot;DeGraffenreid&quot; argues Black women are not a special class to be protected. The rulings, when connected, display a deep-rooted problem in regards to addressing discrimination within the legal system. These cases, although they are outdated are used by feminists as evidence of their ideas and principles.

===Communication theory===
Feminist communication theory has evolved over time and branches out in many directions. Early theories focused on the way that gender influenced communication and many argued that language was &quot;man made&quot;. This view of communication promoted a &quot;deficiency model&quot; asserting that characteristics of speech associated with women were negative and that men &quot;set the standard for competent interpersonal communication&quot;, which influences the type of language used by men and women. These early theories also suggested that ethnicity, cultural and economic backgrounds also needed to be addressed. They looked at how gender intersects with other identity constructs, such as class, race, and sexuality. Feminist theorists, especially those considered to be liberal feminists, began looking at issues of equality in education and employment. Other theorists addressed political oratory and public discourse. The recovery project brought to light many women orators who had been &quot;erased or ignored as significant contributors&quot;. Feminist communication theorists also addressed how women were represented in the media and how the media &quot;communicated ideology about women, gender, and feminism&quot;.

Feminist communication theory also encompasses access to the public sphere, whose voices are heard in that sphere, and the ways in which the field of communication studies has limited what is regarded as essential to public discourse. The recognition of a full history of women orators overlooked and disregarded by the field has effectively become an undertaking of recovery, as it establishes and honors the existence of women in history and lauds the communication by these historically significant contributors. This recovery effort, begun by Andrea Lunsford, Professor of English and Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric at Stanford University and followed by other feminist communication theorists also names women such as Aspasia, Diotima, and Christine de Pisan, who were likely influential in rhetorical and communication traditions in classical and medieval times, but who have been negated as serious contributors to the traditions.

Feminist communication theorists are also concerned with a recovery effort in attempting to explain the methods used by those with power to prohibit women like Maria W. Stewart, Sarah Moore Grimké, and Angelina Grimké, and more recently, Ella Baker and Anita Hill, from achieving a voice in political discourse and consequently being driven from the public sphere. Theorists in this vein are also interested in the unique and significant techniques of communication employed by these women and others like them to surmount some of the oppression they experienced.

Feminist theorist also evaluate communication expectations for students and women in the work place, in particular how the performance of feminine versus masculine styles of communicating are constructed. Judith Butler, who coined the term &quot;gender performativity&quot; further suggests that, &quot;theories of communication must explain the ways individuals negotiate, resist, and transcend their identities in a highly gendered society&quot;. This focus also includes the ways women are constrained or &quot;disciplined&quot; in the discipline of communication in itself, in terms of biases in research styles and the &quot;silencing&quot; of feminist scholarship and theory.

Who is responsible for deciding what is considered important public discourse is also put into question by feminist theorists in communication scholarship. This lens of feminist communication theory is labeled as revalorist theory which honors the historical perspective of women in communication in an attempt to recover voices that have been historically neglected. There have been many attempts to explain the lack of representative voices in the public sphere for women including, the notion that, &quot;the public sphere is built on essentialist principles that prevent women from being seen as legitimate communicators in that sphere&quot;, and theories of subalternity&quot;, which, &quot;under extreme conditions of oppression...prevent those in positions of power from even hearing their communicative attempts&quot;.

=== Public relations ===
Feminist theory can be applied to the field of public relations. The feminist scholar Linda Hon examined the major obstacles that women in the field experienced. Some common barriers included male dominance and gender stereotypes. Hon shifted the feminist theory of PR from &quot;women&#x27;s assimilation into patriarchal systems &quot; to &quot;genuine commitment to social restructuring&quot;. Similarly to the studies Hon conducted, Elizabeth Lance Toth studied Feminist Values in Public Relations. Toth concluded that there is a clear link between feminist gender and feminist value. These values include honesty, sensitivity, perceptiveness, fairness, and commitment.

===Design===
Technical writers have concluded that visual language can convey facts and ideas clearer than almost any other means of communication. According to the feminist theory, &quot;gender may be a factor in how human beings represent reality.&quot;

Men and women will construct different types of structures about the self, and, consequently, their thought processes may diverge in content and form. This division depends on the self-concept, which is an &quot;important regulator of thoughts, feelings and actions&quot; that &quot;governs one&#x27;s perception of reality&quot;.

With that being said, the self-concept has a significant effect on how men and women represent reality in different ways.

Recently, &quot;technical communicators&#x27; terms such as &#x27;visual rhetoric,&#x27; &#x27;visual language,&#x27; and &#x27;document design&#x27; indicate a new awareness of the importance of visual design&quot;.

Deborah S. Bosley explores this new concept of the &quot;feminist theory of design&quot; by conducting a study on a collection of undergraduate males and females who were asked to illustrate a visual, on paper, given to them in a text. Based on this study, she creates a &quot;feminist theory of design&quot; and connects it to technical communicators.

In the results of the study, males used more angular illustrations, such as squares, rectangles and arrows, which are interpreted as a &quot;direction&quot; moving away from or a moving toward, thus suggesting more aggressive positions than rounded shapes, showing masculinity.

Females, on the other hand, used more curved visuals, such as circles, rounded containers and bending pipes. Bosley takes into account that feminist theory offers insight into the relationship between females and circles or rounded objects. According to Bosley, studies of women and leadership indicate a preference for nonhierarchical work patterns (preferring a communication &quot;web&quot; rather than a communication &quot;ladder&quot;). Bosley explains that circles and other rounded shapes, which women chose to draw, are nonhierarchical and often used to represent inclusive, communal relationships, confirming her results that women&#x27;s visual designs do have an effect on their means of communications.

Based on these conclusions, this &quot;feminist theory of design&quot; can go on to say that gender does play a role in how humans represent reality.

===Black feminist criminology===
Black feminist criminology theory is a concept created by Hillary Potter in 2006 to act as a bridge that integrates Feminist theory with criminology. It is based on the integration of Black feminist theory and critical race feminist theory.

As Potter articulates this theory, Black feminist criminology describes experiences of Black women as victims of crimes. Other scholars, such as Patrina Duhaney and Geniece Crawford Mondé, have explored Black feminist criminology in relation to current and formerly incarcerated Black women.

For years, Black women were historically overlooked and disregarded in the study of crime and criminology; however, with a new focus on Black feminism that sparked in the 1980s, Black feminists began to contextualize their unique experiences and examine why the general status of Black women in the criminal justice system was lacking in female specific approaches. Potter explains that because Black women usually have &quot;limited access to adequate education and employment as consequences of racism, sexism, and classism&quot;, they are often disadvantaged. This disadvantage materializes into &quot;poor responses by social service professionals and crime-processing agents to Black women&#x27;s interpersonal victimization&quot;.

Most crime studies focused on White males/females and Black males. Any results or conclusions targeted to Black males were usually assumed to be the same situation for Black females. This was very problematic since Black males and Black females differ in what they experience. For instance, economic deprivation, status equality between the sexes, distinctive socialization patterns, racism, and sexism should all be taken into account between Black males and Black females. The two will experience all of these factors differently; therefore, it was crucial to resolve this dilemma.

Black feminist criminology is proposed as the solution to this problem. It takes four factors into account:

* The social structural oppression of Black women (such as through the lens of Crenshaw&#x27;s intersectionality).
* Nuances of Black communities and cultures. 
* Black intimate and familial relations. 
* The Black woman as an individual.

These four factors, Potter argues, helps Black feminist criminology describe the differences between Black women&#x27;s and Black men&#x27;s experiences within the criminal justice system. Still, Potter urges caution, noting that, just because this theory aims to help understand and explain Black women&#x27;s experiences with the criminal justice system, one cannot generalize so much that nuances in experiences are ignored. Potter writes that Black women&#x27;s &quot;individual circumstances must always be considered in conjunction with the shared experiences of these women.&quot;

===Feminist science and technology studies===

Feminist science and technology studies (STS) refers to the transdisciplinary field of research on the ways gender and other markers of identity intersect with technology, science, and culture. The practice emerged from feminist critique on the masculine-coded uses of technology in the fields of natural, medical, and technical sciences, and its entanglement in gender and identity. A large part of feminist technoscience theory explains science and technologies to be linked and should be held accountable for the social and cultural developments resulting from both fields.

Some key issues feminist technoscience studies address include:

* The use of feminist analysis when applied to scientific ideas and practices
* Intersections between race, class, gender, science, and technology
* The implications of situated knowledges
* Politics of gender on how to understand agency, body, rationality, and the boundaries between nature and culture

=== Ecological feminism or ecofeminism ===
In the 1970s, the impacts of post-World War II technological development led many women to organise against issues from the toxic pollution of neighbourhoods to nuclear weapons testing on indigenous lands. This grassroots activism emerging across every continent was both intersectional and cross-cultural in its struggle to protect the conditions for reproduction of Life on Earth. Known as ecofeminism, the political relevance of this movement continues to expand. Classic statements in its literature include Carolyn Merchant, United States, &quot;The Death of Nature&quot;; Maria Mies, Germany, &quot;Patriarchy and Accumulation on a World Scale&quot;; Vandana Shiva, India, &quot;Staying Alive: Women Ecology and Development&quot;; Ariel Salleh, Australia, &quot;Ecofeminism as Politics: nature, Marx, and the postmodern&quot;. Ecofeminism involves a profound critique of Eurocentric epistemology, science, economics, and culture. It is increasingly prominent as a feminist response to the contemporary breakdown of the planetary ecosystem.

<text>The Armed Forces Service Medal (AFSM) is a military award of the United States military that was created on January 11, 1996, by President Bill Clinton under . The AFSM is a deployed service medal that is presented to those service members who engage in &quot;significant activity&quot; for which no other U.S. campaign or service medal is authorized.

==Appearance== 
The Armed Forces Service Medal is a round bronze medal in diameter. The obverse of the medal bears a demi-torch, as held by the Statue of Liberty, with rays radiating from behind the torch. Encircling at the top is the inscription &quot;ARMED FORCES SERVICE MEDAL&quot;. The reverse bears the eagle found on the United States Department of Defense seal. Below is a laurel wreath with the inscription &quot;IN PURSUIT OF DEMOCRACY&quot; at the top.

The suspension and ribbon of the medal are wide and consists of the following edge stripes from outside edge to the center: goldenlight, jungle green, green, mosstone green, and goldenlight. The center stripe is wide in bluebird.

==Criteria==
The Armed Forces Service Medal is the non-combat parallel of the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal which is normally awarded for combat operations and other combat support missions.

The AFSM may be awarded to service members who, on or after June 1, 1992:

* Participate, or have participated, as members of U.S. military units, in a designated U.S. military operation deemed to be a significant activity.
* Encounter no foreign armed opposition or imminent hostile action.

The term &quot;significant activity&quot; is determined by theater commanders and is normally deemed to be participation in a U.S. military operation considered to hold a high degree of scope, impact, and international significance that the operation warrants the presentation of a permanent service medal.

Service members must have been permanently assigned, attached, or detailed to a unit that deployed to participate in a designated U.S. operation within the area of eligibility for 30 consecutive days (or for the full period when an operation is less than 30 days) or for 60 non-consecutive days.

Aircrew members must have participated as a regular assigned crew member on an aircraft flying into, out of, within, or over the area of eligibility in direct support of the designated military operation for 30 consecutive days or 60 non-consecutive days. One day of service is credited for the first sortie flown on any day. Additional sorties flown on the same day receive no further credit.

The AFSM may be authorized for U.S. military operations for which no other U.S. campaign or service medal is appropriate such as:
* Peacekeeping operations
* Prolonged humanitarian operations
* U.S. military operations in direct support of the United Nations (UN) or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and for operations of assistance to friendly foreign nations. The award is only appropriate if the NATO, UN, or foreign operation involves a concurrent U.S. military support operation.

The AFSM is not authorized for participation in national or international exercises. For operations in which personnel of only one military department participate, the AFSM will be awarded only if there is no other suitable award available to the department.

; Additional awards and devices:
One award of the Armed Forces Service Medal is authorized for each designated military operation. Only one AFSM is awarded for multiple deployments for the same designated operation. Subsequent awards are denoted by wearing a bronze service star on the AFSM suspension and service ribbon. 
A silver service star is worn in lieu of five bronze service stars.

== Approved operations ==

As an exception to Department of Defense policy, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the Armed Forces Service Medal may be awarded concurrently for Operations Joint Guard and Joint Endeavor. While Operation Sharp Guard was conducted during the Bosnia War, the Veterans of Foreign Wars refuses to accept Veterans of the Bosnian War who received the Armed Forces Service Medal.

<doc id="1022293" wikidata="Q7741316" url="?curid=1022293" title="The Id (band)">
<text>The Id were an English new wave/synthpop band from the Wirral, Merseyside, England, formed in 1977. They are best recalled as the precursor to the band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), in which Id members Andy McCluskey (bass, vocals), Paul Humphreys (keyboards) and Malcolm Holmes (drums) would reunite; Gary Hodgson (guitar) would also reappear as a technician for the new group. A number of The Id&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Electricity&quot;, were re-recorded by OMD.

==Formation==
The Id formed in September 1977. McCluskey and Humphreys had met each other at school, sharing interests in early electronic artists like Brian Eno and Kraftwerk and played together since 1975. Humphreys went to study electronics at Riversdale College, in Liverpool, where he met Gary Hodgson and Steve Hollas (bass).

The group also included Julia Kneale (vocals), Neill Shenton (guitar) and John Floyd (vocals), all of whom had short-lived tenures. The band gigged regularly in the Merseyside area, performing original material largely written by McCluskey and Humphreys.

==Recordings==
In early 1978 The Id recorded &quot;Electricity&quot;, &quot;Julia&#x27;s Song&quot; (lyrics by Julia Kneale) and &quot;The Misunderstanding&quot; at the Open Eye studio in Liverpool, following advice from Eric&#x27;s Club owner Roger Eagle. &quot;Julia&#x27;s Song&quot; was included on the following year&#x27;s compilation release, &quot;Street to Street: A Liverpool Album&quot; (Open Eye Records / OE LP 501). In December 2002, all three tracks were released as an EP by Engine Records.

In August 1978 the band split up. McCluskey joined Dalek I Love You the same month, but left within a month to reunite with Humphreys to form OMD.

===OMD versions===
A new recording of &quot;Electricity&quot; was released as OMD&#x27;s first single on Factory in 1979. It was again re-recorded by the band for their eponymous debut album, released in February 1980, and re-released as a single. It remains one of the group&#x27;s best known songs.

A new recording of &quot;Julia&#x27;s Song&quot; also featured on the album, with Malcolm Holmes contributing percussion. He reunited with McCluskey and Humphreys in 1980 for touring and promotional work for the album (together with Dave Hughes also formerly of Dalek I Love You), and for recording the group&#x27;s second album &quot;Organisation&quot;, also featuring a radical re-recording of Id track &quot;The Misunderstanding&quot;. Holmes then became a permanent member of OMD.

&quot;Julia&#x27;s Song&quot; was also recorded for OMD&#x27;s debut Peel session in August 1979 and &quot;The Misunderstanding&quot;, similar to the &quot;Organisation&quot; version, was recorded for their third session for the DJ in September 1980.

Another song by The Id, &quot;Radio Waves&quot;, was recorded by OMD for their 1983 album &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot;. The track had been co-written by John Floyd.

&quot;Julia&#x27;s Song&quot; received a further radical re-recording, featuring a brass section, in 1984, when it featured as the B-side to OMD&#x27;s hit single &quot;Talking Loud &amp; Clear&quot;.

Gary Hodgson worked as a keyboard technician for OMD during their live performances and has provided similar services for Oasis.

<doc id="1022298" wikidata="Q1007634" url="?curid=1022298" title="Estelí">
<text>Estelí (), officially Villa de San Antonio de Pavia de Estelí is a city and municipality within the Estelí department. It is the 8th largest city in Nicaragua due to the high urbanization of its municipality, at 84.8%, with an urban population of 111,244 (2022 estimate). It is also the eighth-largest municipality, and an active commercial center in the north, known as &quot;the Diamond of the Segovia&quot; (this name being created by Oscar Corea Molina in his radio show &quot;Trampolin 43”) and the de facto capital of the north.

Located on the Pan-American Highway, 150 km north of Managua, Estelí is a fast-growing and progressive city. It enjoys a pleasant climate most of the year due to its location in the north central highlands at a mean elevation of 844 m (2769 ft) above sea level. The city is also surrounded by forested mountains of pines, oaks, and walnuts, and plateaus up to 1600 m above sea level, some of which are protected as natural reserves.

==History==

The first settlement of what would become the City of Esteli occurred in Villa Vieja in 1685. It was founded by a group of Spaniards fleeing Nueva Segovia which at that time suffered from pirate attacks. Villa Vieja was then replaced by a new settlement (San Antonio de Pavia) from where the city of Esteli has grown. Today there is evidence of the first church in the Villa Vieja sector of the city.

The town is described in 1858 as &quot;a little town in a small plain through which winds the river of the same name...&quot; It is described as having a grist-mill and that &quot;the country produces considerable wheat of medium quality.&quot;

Esteli was described in 1920 as having 8,000 inhabitants and as being a rich and growing center.

Estelí was the scene of heavy fighting in the civil war against the Somoza government from 1978 to 1979. The city was heavily air-bombed by the regime&#x27;s National Guard and burnt by the FSLN guerrillas, which reduced many of the city&#x27;s buildings to rubble. The human casualties were around 15,000; many of them were youths massacred on suspicion of being part of the insurrection due to the infiltration of anti-government guerillas from the Pacific of Nicaragua whom used the city as a war theater. Estelí rebuilt all but some structures, such as the Teatro Montenegro and the Government Palace, and a few may still show bullet holes.

==Economy and tourism==

The land around Estelí is perfect for growing tobacco for use in cigars, and the town became a refuge for Cuban cigar makers after the Cuban Revolution in 1959. Award-winning cigars have made Estelí one of the most important cigar-producing cities in the world. Estelí also has many language schools. Restaurants and hotels cater to tourists traveling to nearby natural reserves and other parts of the region. Natural Reserves around the area include Miraflor, Tisey-Estanzuela, Las Brisas-Quiabuc, Tomabú, Tepesomoto, and Moropotente.

According to the World Bank and International Finance Corporation&#x27;s Municipal Scorecard 2008, which complements the annual Doing Business report, the municipality of Estelí ranks 1st and 2nd, out of 143 municipalities in ten Latin American countries, in quality and efficiency to obtain a construction permit and municipal operating license respectively. Esteli has improved its performance from the Municipal Scorecard 2007, where it ranked 5th out of 65 municipalities in five countries.

==Infrastructure==
Estelí has the best water supply system in the country with near-full population coverage. It also has extensive sewage disposal coverage.

At least three airfields have been built in Esteli throughout history, although none exists today. One of the first airfields documented played the role of alternate airport from 1930 to 1934 when TACA established the service to carry passengers with an El Salvador-Tegucigalpa-Danli-Ocotal-Esteli-Managua route. La Thompson, which is three miles north of Estelí, is where the second airstrip was built and used by a company named &quot;Thonsson Corwell&quot; to help complete a stretch of the Pan-American Highway. The third airfield was built in the north end of town in the 1980s but has now been urbanized.

In 1950 there was a proposal to create a railroad branch from Esteli to Matagalpa which would eventually connect the city to other parts of the country including Prinzapolka Port in the Caribbean and Managua.

In 1940 efforts were made to expand Nicaragua&#x27;s railroad from El Sauce to the north via Estelí. Thirteen kilometers of rail, the town of Río Grande, and a railroad bridge were built with the intention of taking the rail up to Esteli along the Aquespalapa or Villanueva river, which originates in the Quiabuc mountains; however, the project was abandoned.

Estelí is home to one of the most successful and most popular football clubs in the country, the Real Estelí, nicknamed &quot;El Tren del Norte&quot; (&quot;The Train of the North&quot;). They play their home games at the Estadio Independencia, a name created by Oscar Corea Molina. Real Estelí Baloncesto plays in the Basketball Champions League Americas.

It is also home to a professional baseball team, Estelí, which makes it one of only three cities in the country with both a professional football (soccer) and baseball team. During the 1970s, Estelí participated in the &quot;Roberto Clemente&quot; baseball tournament and had one of the best baseball teams in the country with the help of one-time big league players like Porfi Altamirano and Albert Williams.

Estelí also counts on a championship-winning professional cycling team called Real Estelí Ciclismo, which is member of the Cycling Federation of Nicaragua. In May 2019, Real Estelí won first place in the Elite group of the Europa Tour 2019 cycling competition in San Salvador, El Salvador, hosted by the Cycling Federation of El Salvador. The team also won second place in the Master B category.

==Gastronomy==
Due to its altitude Estelí can be quite chilly at night or in the morning and even cold in winter. Thus, like all northern mountainous regions of Nicaragua, Estelí&#x27;s gastronomy consists of a hearty mountain diet of beef, game, veal, rabbit, geese, sausages, and heavy soups like albóndiga, queso, res, etc. There&#x27;s a high consumption of milk products like smoked or spicy cheeses like ahumado and picante, and regional corn-based dishes like delicious montucas, salty-sour repochetas, and semi-sweet güirilas. For breakfast, chorizo, refried beans, sour cream, and home-made style bread are more common and black coffee is the king of drinks any time of the day. Though illegal, cususa (a clear alcoholic drink) is also consumed, especially on the outskirts of the city or in small cantinas (bars).

<text>The 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup was the second edition of the UEFA European Championship. The final tournament was held in Spain. It was won by the hosts 2–1 over the defending champions, the Soviet Union.

The tournament was a knockout competition; 29 teams entered (Greece withdrew after the draw after refusing to play Albania). The Soviet Union, Austria and Luxembourg received byes to the round of 16. The teams played home-and-away matches until the semi-finals; the final four teams would move on to the final tournament, whose host was selected after the teams became known.

Luxembourg proved to be the giant-killers of the qualifying rounds; they beat the Netherlands 3–2 on aggregate (1–1 and 2–1), and then drew with Denmark 3–3 and 2–2, before losing the replay 1–0. Denmark thus became the most surprising of the qualifiers for the final tournament, joining the Soviet Union, Spain, and Hungary. In the semi-finals, the Soviet Union defeated the Danes 3–0 in Barcelona, and Spain beat Hungary 2–1 in extra time in Madrid, the winning goal being scored by Amancio. This set up a showdown between Spain and the Soviet Union in the final, only four years after Spain had been disqualified for refusing to travel to Moscow to play the Soviet Union. On this occasion – and with the championship of Europe on the line – General Franco let his team play the Soviets. In front of more than 79,000 people, including Franco himself, at the Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid, the hosts won 2–1 after a late goal from Marcelino.

<text>The krone (alternatively crown; , , , , , , , , , ) was the official currency of Austria-Hungary from 1892 (when it replaced the gulden as part of the adoption of the gold standard) until the dissolution of the empire in 1918. The subunit was one hundredth of the main unit, and was called a in the Austrian and a in the Hungarian part of the Empire.

== Name ==
The official name of the currency was (, pl. ) in Austria and in Hungary. The Latin form (plural ), abbreviated to on the smaller coins, was used for the coinage of the mostly German-speaking part of the empire known as Cisleithania. Currency names in other ethnic languages were also recognised and appeared on the banknotes: (pl. ) in Czech, (pl. ) in Polish, , (pl. , ) in Ukrainian, (pl. ) in Italian, (pl. ) in Slovene, / (singular and plural) in Serbo-Croatian, (pl. ) in Slovak, and (pl. ) in Romanian. These terms all translate to the English word &quot;crown&quot;.

The symbol of the currency was the abbreviation K. or sometimes Kr.

== History ==

=== Introduction ===
After several earlier attempts the Austro-Hungarian Empire adopted the gold standard in 1892 according to a plan drawn up by the Hungarian Minister of Finance Sándor Wekerle. This plan included the introduction of the new currency, the Krone. It consisted of 100 &quot;Heller&quot; (Austria) or &quot;Fillér&quot; (Hungary). The value of the Krone was set at 2 kronen = 1 gulden. From 1900 onward, Krone notes were the only legal banknotes of the Empire.

=== First World War ===
The currency depreciated sharply as a result of the First World War, which was financed mostly by the issue of War Bonds rather than through taxation. Consumer prices rose sixteenfold during the war, as the government had no hesitation in running the Austro-Hungarian Bank&#x27;s printing presses to pay its bills: this triggered a higher inflation rate than in other combatant countries.

=== After 1918 ===

==== Austria ====

After the end of the First World War it was initially hoped that the Krone might remain the common currency of the Empire&#x27;s successor states, but in January 1919 the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) became the first successor state to overstamp the Austro-Hungarian Bank&#x27;s notes, limiting their validity to its own territory. Czechoslovakia followed suit in February 1919, and on 12 March 1919 the new Republic of Austria stamped the notes circulating in its territory with &quot;DEUTSCHÖSTERREICH&quot;.

The Austrian economy did not stabilise after the war, and a period of hyperinflation followed: the money supply increased from 12 to 30 billion Kronen in 1920, and to about 147 billion Kronen at the end of 1921. In August 1922 consumer prices were 14,000 times greater than before the start of the war eight years earlier. The highest-denomination banknote issued was the 500,000 Kronen note, issued in 1922. Faith in the currency had been lost, and people spent money as fast as they received it. In October 1922 Austria secured a loan of 650 million gold Kronen from the League of Nations, with a League of Nations Commissioner supervising the country&#x27;s finances. This stabilized the currency at a rate of 14,400 paper Kronen to 1 gold Krone. On 2 January 1923 the Austrian National Bank (Österreichische Nationalbank) began operations, taking over control of the currency from the Austro-Hungarian Bank which had gone into liquidation.

In December 1923 the Austrian Parliament authorised the government to issue silver 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000-kronen coins which were to be designated &quot;half-Schilling&quot;, &quot;Schilling&quot;, and &quot;double Schilling&quot;. The Schilling became the official currency of Austria currency on 20 December 1924, at a rate of 10,000 Kronen to 1 Schilling.

==Over-stamped Austro-Hungarian krone==

=== Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina ===

In these territories of Austria-Hungary, which became part of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) in 1918, Krone banknotes were stamped by the new authorities and became issues of the Serb, Croat and Slovene krone. In 1920 this was replaced by the dinar at a rate of 1 dinar = 4 Kronen.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
In Czechoslovakia the currency was superseded by the Czechoslovak koruna, at par. The names of the present-day &quot;koruna&quot; and &quot;haléř&quot; (in the Czech Republic) and the pre-Euro &quot;koruna&quot; and &quot;halier&quot; (in Slovakia) are derived from the Austro-Hungarian Krone and Heller.

=== Fiume ===
The Fiume Krone (Corona Fiumana) - (Cor., FiuK) was introduced on 18 April 1919 by over-printing the existing Austro-Hungarian Krone notes, under the authority of the Italian National Council of Fiume who ruled the city. There were two issues: the 1919/21 Issue (1 and 2 kronen), and the 1920 Issue (2, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 1,000 kronen). The over-printed notes were in circulation from April 1919 to February 1921. In September 1920 the Italian Lira was introduced as the official currency. The unofficial exchange rate to the lira was 2.5 FiuK to 1 Lira.

=== Hungary ===

In Hungary the Austro-Hungarian currency was overstamped and then replaced by the Hungarian korona at par. The Hungarian korona was devalued by hyperinflation, due to the consequences of World War I and the Treaty of Trianon. It was replaced by the pengő on 21 January 1927, at a rate of 12,500 korona to 1 pengő.

=== Romania ===
In Romania there were two issues of over-stamped notes: the 1919 First Provisional Issue (stamp on the Austrian side of the note), and the 1919 Second Provisional Issue (stamp on the Hungarian side). Both issues included 10, 20, 50, 100, 1000, and 10,000 korona denominations. The issue dates of the base Austro-Hungarian krone notes used ranged from 1902 to 1918.

=== Complete denomination sets of over-stamped notes ===

== Coins ==
== Banknotes ==
Krone banknotes were designed and printed in Vienna from 1900 onward. These banknotes were used throughout the Monarchy. All banknotes issued by the Austro-Hungarian Bank were bilingual in German and Hungarian: the denomination was also indicated in other languages of the Monarchy. Until World War I, all banknotes had a German and a Hungarian side; during the war, some banknotes were issued with text in both languages on either side. The designers included Koloman Moser, Rudolf Rössler, Josef Pfeiffer and László Hegedűs. The engraver was Ferdinand Schirnböck.

<text>Bonapartism () is the political ideology supervening from Napoleon Bonaparte and his followers and successors. The term was used to refer to people who hoped to restore the House of Bonaparte and its style of government. In this sense, a &quot;Bonapartiste&quot; was a person who either actively participated in or advocated for conservative, nationalist, monarchist, and imperial political factions in 19th-century France. Although Bonapartism emerged in 1814 with the first fall of Napoleon, it only developed doctrinal clarity and cohesion by the 1840s.

After Napoleon, the term was applied to French politicians who seized power in the Coup of 18 Brumaire, ruling in the French Consulate and subsequently in the First and Second French Empires. The &quot;Bonapartistes&quot; desired an empire under the House of Bonaparte, the Corsican family of Napoleon Bonaparte (Napoleon I of France) and his nephew Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III of France). In the 21st century, the term is more generally used for political movements that advocate for an authoritarian centralised state, with a strongman and charismatic leader, support for the military, and conservatism.

==Beliefs==

Marxism and Leninism developed a vocabulary of political terms that included Bonapartism, derived from their analysis of the career of Napoleon Bonaparte. Karl Marx, a student of Jacobinism and the French Revolution, was a contemporary critic of the Second Republic and the Second Empire. He used &quot;Bonapartism&quot; to refer to a situation in which counter-revolutionary military officers seize power from revolutionaries, and use selective reforms to co-opt the radicalism of the popular classes. Marx argued that in the process, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower ruling class.

Noted political scientists and historians greatly differ on the definition and interpretation of Bonapartism. Sudhir Hazareesingh&#x27;s book &quot;The Legend of Napoleon&quot; explores numerous interpretations of the term. He says that it refers to a &quot;popular national leader confirmed by popular election, above party politics, promoting equality, progress, and social change, with a belief in religion as an adjunct to the State, a belief that the central authority can transform society and a belief in the &#x27;nation&#x27; and its glory and a fundamental belief in national unity.&quot; Hazareesingh believes that although recent research shows Napoleon used forced conscription of French troops, some men must have fought believing in Napoleon&#x27;s ideals. He says that to argue Bonapartism co-opted the masses is an example of the Marxist perspective of false consciousness: the idea that the masses can be manipulated by a few determined leaders in the pursuit of ends.

==Bonapartist claimants==
After becoming emperor in 1804, Napoleon I established a Law of Succession, providing that the Bonapartist claim to the throne should pass firstly to Napoleon&#x27;s own legitimate male descendants through the male line. At that time he had no legitimate sons, and it seemed unlikely he would have any due to the age of his wife Joséphine. He eventually achieved an annulment, without Papal approval, of his marriage to Josephine. He married the younger Marie Louise, with whom he had one son.

The law of succession provided that if Napoleon&#x27;s own direct line died out, the claim passed first to his older brother Joseph and his legitimate male descendants through the male line, then to his younger brother Louis and his legitimate male descendants through the male line. His other brothers, Lucien and Jérôme, and their descendants, were omitted from the succession (even though Lucien was older than Louis) because they had either politically opposed the Emperor or made marriages of which he disapproved. Napoleon abdicated in favor of his son after his defeat in 1815. Although the Bonapartes were deposed and the old Bourbon monarchy restored, Bonapartists recognised Napoleon&#x27;s son as Napoleon II. A sickly child, he was virtually imprisoned in Austria, and died young and unmarried, without any descendants. When the French Empire was restored to power in 1852, the emperor was Napoleon III, Louis Bonaparte&#x27;s only living legitimate son (their brother Joseph having died in 1844 without having had a legitimate son, only daughters).

In 1852, Napoleon III enacted a new decree on the succession. The claim was given to his own male legitimate descendants in the male line (though at that time he had no son, Louis later had a legitimate son, Eugène, who was recognised by Bonapartists as &quot;Napoleon IV&quot; before dying young and unmarried). If Napoleon III&#x27;s line died out, he decreed that the claim should pass to Jérôme, Napoleon&#x27;s youngest brother (who had previously been excluded), and his male descendants by Princess Catharina of Württemberg in the male line (excluded were his descendants by his first marriage, to the American commoner Elizabeth Patterson, of which Napoleon I had greatly disapproved). The Bonapartist claimants since 1879 have been the descendants of Jérôme and Catherine of Württemberg in the male line.

The Bonapartist laws of succession were far from traditional. The family members ignored primogeniture (by excluding Lucien Bonaparte and his descendants); they annulled marriages to achieve their goals; and they did not submit to the Pope&#x27;s rights as final arbiter on the validity of marriages. The very claim of the Bonaparte family to rule France was far from traditional.

==Marxism==
Based on the career of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Marxism and Leninism defined Bonapartism as a political expression. Karl Marx was a student of Jacobinism and the French Revolution, as well as a contemporary critic of the Second Republic and Second Empire. He used the term &quot;Bonapartism&quot; to refer to a situation in which counter-revolutionary military officers seize power from revolutionaries, and use selective reformism to co-opt the radicalism of the masses. In the process, Marx argued, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower ruling class. He believed that both Napoleon I and Napoleon III had corrupted revolutions in France in this way. Marx offered this definition of and analysis of Bonapartism in &quot;The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte&quot;, written in 1852. In this document, he drew attention to what he calls the phenomenon&#x27;s repetitive history with one of his most quoted lines, typically condensed aphoristically as: &quot;History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.&quot;

==Other Bonapartists==

Faustin Soulouque&#x27;s Second Empire of Haiti was influenced by Napoleon&#x27;s First French Empire. In 1976, when president Jean-Bédel Bokassa, a great admirer of Napoleon I, made himself Emperor Bokassa I of Central Africa, he declared that the ideology of his regime was Bonapartism and added golden bees to his imperial standard.

<doc id="1022321" wikidata="Q7357537" url="?curid=1022321" title="Roe effect">
<text>The Roe effect is a hypothesis about the long-term effect of abortion on the political balance of the United States, which suggests that since supporters of the legalization of abortion cause the erosion of their own political base, the practice of abortion will eventually lead to the restriction or illegalization of abortion. It is named after &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court case that effectively legalized abortion nationwide in the U.S. Its best-known proponent is James Taranto of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; who coined the phrase &quot;Roe effect&quot; in &quot;Best of the Web Today&quot;, his OpinionJournal.com column.

Put simply, this hypothesis holds that:
*Those who favor legal abortion are much more likely to have the procedure than those who oppose it.
*Children usually follow their parents&#x27; political leanings.
*Therefore, pro-abortion rights parents will have more abortions and, hence, fewer children.
*Therefore, the pro-abortion rights population gradually shrinks in proportion to the anti-abortion population.
*Therefore, support for legal abortions will decline over time.

A similar argument suggests that political groups that oppose abortion will tend to have more supporters in the long run than those who support it. In 2005, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; published a detailed explanation and statistical evidence that Taranto says supports his hypothesis.

Taranto first discussed the concept in January 2003, and named it in December 2003. He later suggested that the Roe effect serves as an explanation for the fact that the fall in teen birth rates is &quot;greatest in liberal states, where pregnant teenagers would be more likely to [have abortions] and thus less likely to carry their babies to term.&quot;

The &quot;Journal&quot; has also published articles about this topic by Larry L. Eastland and Arthur C. Brooks. Eastland has argued that Democrats have had higher rates of abortion than Republicans following &quot;Roe,&quot; while Brooks points out liberals have a lower fertility rate than conservatives.

According to American historian Elizabeth Fox-Genovese the existence of such an effect &quot;cannot be doubted&quot; but &quot;its nature, causes, and consequences may be.&quot; Fox-Genovese said that &quot;Taranto has advanced an arresting argument that deserves more extended treatment.&quot;

Wellesley College Professor of Economics Phillip Levine, while acknowledging that Taranto&#x27;s hypothesis cannot be dismissed out of hand, has said there are several flaws in Taranto&#x27;s reasoning. He writes that the conditions laid out by Taranto make several incorrect assumptions, most notably that pregnancies are events that are completely out of the control of the women. He writes, &quot;If people engage in sexual activity (or not), or choose to use birth control (or not), independent of outside influences, then [Taranto&#x27;s and Eastland&#x27;s] statistical statements would be valid.&quot; Levine concludes that the hypothesis passes the test of plausibility but that it &quot;would be unwarranted to draw any definitive conclusions regarding the actual contribution of the Roe Effect in determining contemporary political outcomes.&quot;

<doc id="1022322" wikidata="Q863984" url="?curid=1022322" title="Fox toolkit">
<text>The FOX toolkit is an open-source, cross-platform widget toolkit, i.e. a library of basic elements for building a graphical user interface (GUI). FOX stands for Free Objects for X.

It features a hard-wired Windows 95-style theme available for both Microsoft Windows itself as well as the X Window System (which is used on many UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems).

The FOX toolkit has been released under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence. Development began 1997 by Jeroen van der Zijp while he was affiliated at CFDRC. Since then, Jeroen van der Zijp maintains the core library and test applications, with the help of user community.

The FOX toolkit is written in C++, with language bindings available for Python, Ruby and Eiffel. The FOX source code distribution supports building with many different (commercial and free) C++ compilers.

==Cross-platform compatibility==
FOX differentiates itself in the following way from other cross-platform toolkits:
* Tk is a cross-platform toolkit but does not have all of the widgets that FOX considers desirable.
* Qt up to version 4.5 used to have a licensing model that required a commercial license in some cases where FOX would not.
* wxWidgets promotes the use of native widgets on each supported platform.
* FLTK is a fast, low-footprint library that supports rapid application development, and requires less code to use, but lacks advanced widgets.

All of these toolkits have some support for programming natively on the classic Mac OS and/or macOS platforms, which FOX currently does not support.

FOX uses a technique similar to the Java Swing-style approach to display a graphical user interface to the screen, using only graphical primitives available on that platform, as opposed to the original Java AWT-style approach which used native widgets. This means that applications will have a similar look and feel across platforms. In theory, porting FOX to a new platform should also be easier than implementing support for native widgets.

On the downside, it usually means that FOX applications will look and feel different from native applications for those platforms, which some users may find confusing. Also, certain native platform features may not be available immediately, such as comprehensive printing support or internationalized input handling, because they will need to be re-implemented in a cross-platform way before they can be used in FOX. Some applications, like Xfe File Manager, allow changing the color scheme to better integrate with the system&#x27;s theme colors. On Arch Linux, an app called FOX Control Panel is available to change the color scheme of all FOX applications system-wide. It ships with the main FOX Toolkit package.

==Messaging system==
FOX offers a transparent bi-directional messaging system. Each widget sends its message to a certain target. Each message is composed by a selector that identifies its kind and an id that is unique and provided by the widget&#x27;s enumeration. The advantage is that each widget can call a target widget&#x27;s method in a transparent manner, even if the method does not exist. Vice versa, in the implementation of the individual message handler, since the sender is known, the target can also dispatch a message to the sender. This is a particularly important feature in component oriented software, where components may be written by different people, or even different organizations.

The FOX messaging system simplifies the GUI update strategy: during widget update, the widgets can ask from their targets to update them. This means that a command message does not also have to explicitly update any widgets as it is typical. In case an application implements N command messages each updating M widgets, then M*N updates must be executed and at most M*N messages must be implemented. On the other hand, if widgets request for update, only N command messages and at most M update messages are implemented. This strategy separates the GUI update from data changes, making the GUI a real-time reflection of the underlying data structures.

== Internals ==

=== Dependencies ===
Under hood it depends on the cross-platform libraries, which include the following:

* Open GL
* OpenGL Utility Library
* libjpeg
* libpng
* LibTIFF
* zlib (lz)
* bzip2 for file compression

==Hello World==
The following example creates a FOX application and a dialog with a button on C++:

#include &quot;fx.h&quot;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 FXApp application(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;FoxTest&quot;);
 application.init(argc, argv);
 FXMainWindow *main=new FXMainWindow(&amp;application, &quot;Hello&quot;, NULL, NULL, DECOR_ALL);
 new FXButton(main, &quot;&amp;Hello, World!&quot;, NULL, &amp;application, FXApp::ID_QUIT);
 application.create();
 main-&gt;show(PLACEMENT_SCREEN);
 return application.run();


It is also possible to create dialogs with Python 2.2 and Ruby:

&quot;FXPy&quot;

#!/usr/bin/env python3

from FXPy.fox import *
import sys
def runme():
 app = FXApp(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Test&quot;)
 app.init(sys.argv)
 main = FXMainWindow(app, &quot;Hello&quot;, None, None, DECOR_ALL)
 button = FXButton(main, &quot;&amp;Hello, World!&quot;, None, app, FXApp.ID_QUIT)
 app.create()
 main.show(PLACEMENT_SCREEN)
 app.run()
if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
 runme()
&quot;FXRuby&quot;

require &#x27;fox16&#x27;
include Fox
application = FXApp.new(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;FoxTest&quot;)
main = FXMainWindow.new(application, &quot;Hi&quot;, nil, nil, DECOR_ALL)
FXButton.new(main, &quot;&amp;Hello, World!&quot;, nil, application, FXApp::ID_QUIT, 
 LAYOUT_FILL_X | BUTTON_TOOLBAR | FRAME_RAISED | FRAME_THICK)
application.create()
main.show(PLACEMENT_SCREEN)
application.run()

<doc id="1022323" wikidata="Q869669" url="?curid=1022323" title="King Creole">
<text>King Creole is a 1958 American musical drama film directed by Michael Curtiz and based on the 1952 novel &quot;A Stone for Danny Fisher&quot; by Harold Robbins. Produced by Hal B. Wallis, the film stars Elvis Presley, Carolyn Jones, Walter Matthau, Dolores Hart, Dean Jagger, Vic Morrow, Liliane Montevecchi and Paul Stewart, and it follows a nineteen-year-old (Presley) who gets mixed up with crooks and involved with two women.

Presley later indicated that of all the characters that he portrayed throughout his acting career, the role of Danny Fisher in &quot;King Creole&quot; was his favorite. To make the film, Presley was granted a 60-day deferment from January to March 1958 for beginning his military service. Location shooting in New Orleans was delayed several times by crowds of fans attracted by the stars, particularly Presley.

The film was released on July 2, 1958, by Paramount Pictures to critical and commercial success. Many critics praised Presley&#x27;s performance, and the film peaked at number five on the &quot;Variety&quot; box-office earnings chart. The soundtrack song &quot;Hard Headed Woman&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart and number two on the R&amp;B chart, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), while the soundtrack album peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart.

==Plot==
Nineteen-year-old high school student Danny Fisher works before and after school in order to support his father and sister Mimi. After Danny&#x27;s mother died, his grieving father lost his job as a pharmacist and moved his impoverished family to the French Quarter in New Orleans.
At work one morning, Danny rescues Ronnie from her abusive date. After a taxi ride to Danny&#x27;s high school, she kisses him. Danny responds to some schoolmates&#x27; teasing by kissing Ronnie and punching one of them in the face. That earns him a trip to the principal&#x27;s office. Miss Pearson, his teacher, tells Danny that he will not graduate. Principal Mr. Evans is sympathetic but powerless to help, so Danny decides to drop out of school.

When he leaves the school grounds, three young men take him into an alley. Their leader, Shark, wants revenge for Danny hitting his brother. Danny defends himself so well that Shark invites him to join them. Mr. Fisher tries to convince his son to stay in school. Instead, he helps Shark&#x27;s gang shoplift at a five-and-dime by singing &quot;Lover Doll&quot; to distract the customers and staff.
Only Nellie, working at the snack bar, notices his complicity in the theft, but she does not report him. Danny invites Nellie to a fictitious party in a hotel room; finding nobody else there, she starts crying and leaves after admitting that she still wants to see him again, but not under those conditions.
That night, Danny meets Ronnie again at The Blue Shade night club, where he works. At first, she pretends not to know him, as she is accompanied by her boyfriend and the club&#x27;s owner, Maxie Fields, aka &quot;The Pig&quot;. When Maxie does not believe her, she claims that she heard Danny sing once. Maxie insists that Danny prove that he can sing. His rendition of &quot;Trouble&quot; impresses Charlie LeGrand, the honest owner of the King Creole club, the only nightspot in the area not owned by Maxie. He offers Danny a job as a singer.

Meanwhile, Mr. Fisher gets work as a pharmacist in a drug store, but his boss Mr. Primont is constantly demeaning him. That makes it easier for Danny to go against his father&#x27;s wishes and take Charlie&#x27;s offer. When Danny is a hit, Maxie tries to hire him. Danny declines his offer out of loyalty to Charlie.

Shark, now working for Maxie, suggests to Danny they beat up Primont to help his father. When Mr. Fisher leaves the store dressed in Primont&#x27;s hat and coat (lent due to a rainstorm), Shark recognizes him, but mugs him anyway, as that would be even better for Maxie&#x27;s purposes. Danny&#x27;s father is so badly injured that he needs an expensive operation, which Maxie pays for. Maxie blackmails Danny into signing with him by threatening to tell his father about his involvement in the mugging. Danny pummels Maxie and helps Ronnie leave him.

Maxie sends his henchmen after Danny. Shark and another gang member trap him in an alley. Danny knocks out one of his pursuers. Shark stabs Danny but is killed. Ronnie finds Danny and takes him to her house to recover. She asks him to forget her sordid past and pretend to love her. Danny replies that it would not be difficult and kisses her. Maxie drives up, accompanied by Dummy, a member of Danny&#x27;s former gang. Maxie fatally shoots Ronnie. Dummy, who had been befriended by Danny, grapples with Maxie, but the gun goes off, killing its owner.

Danny returns to the King Creole. He sings the lines, &quot;Let&#x27;s think of the future, forget the past, you&#x27;re not my first love, but you&#x27;re my last&quot;, to Nellie in the audience. Mr. Fisher arrives to listen to his son sing.

==Production==
Hal Wallis acquired the rights to &quot;A Stone for Danny Fisher&quot; in February 1955 for $25,000, with the intention of giving the lead role of a New York boxer to either James Dean or Ben Gazzara. The role was originally written for Dean, but the project was canceled after his death in 1955. In January 1957, following the success of an off-Broadway stage version of the story, Presley was suggested as a possible replacement. After negotiations were completed, the character of Fisher was changed from a boxer to a singer and the location was moved from New York to New Orleans.

Wallis selected Michael Curtiz, a noted director of the Hollywood studio system whose works included &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; and &quot;Casablanca&quot;. Curtiz decided to shoot the film in black-and-white for dramatic ambiance and to give the streets a film noir appearance. He also selected an experienced cast to support Presley, including Walter Matthau and Carolyn Jones, as well as Dolores Hart, Presley&#x27;s co-star in the 1957 film &quot;Loving You.&quot; Curtiz instructed a &quot;taken aback&quot; Presley to lose fifteen pounds and shave his sideburns for the role, both of which Presley did.

On December 20, 1957, a month before filming was due to begin, Presley received his draft notice. Presley and Paramount had to request special permission to defer Presley&#x27;s enlistment to allow him to finish the film. Both pointed out to the draft board that a delay in filming would cost them a large sum of money invested in the pre-production of the film. On December 27, Presley received a 60-day deferment.

Filming took place between January 20 and March 10, 1958, mostly at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, California, and on location in the French Quarter in New Orleans, Louisiana, scene of the bayou was filmed at Lake Pontchartrain. During filming, Presley was constantly moved to avoid the crowds of fans who came to see him on location, which delayed the filmmaking. Wallis had rented a house for Presley&#x27;s privacy, and a second one after one of his assistants noticed that the back of the houses in the block led to the back of the houses on the adjacent street. To escape from the crowds, Presley would climb to the roof of one house and cross over onto the roof of the other. After a fan discovered his path, he resided on the tenth floor of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, which was rented for the whole cast.

Before filming began, Curtiz was convinced that Presley would be a &quot;conceited boy&quot;, but after a few weeks of working together, he described Presley as a &quot;lovely boy&quot; who would go on to be a &quot;wonderful actor&quot;. Presley, after seeing an early copy of the finished film, thanked Curtiz for giving him the opportunity to show his potential as an actor; he would later cite Danny Fisher as his favorite role of his acting career. Fourteen days after the completion of &quot;King Creole&quot;, Presley was officially inducted into the U.S. Army.

==Reception==

The film was first shown at Loew&#x27;s State Theater in New York City on July 2, 1958. During the opening week, it ranked number five in box-office earnings on the &quot;Variety&quot; national survey. The film received critical acclaim. King Creole was another financial success at the box office for Elvis, making $2.64 million in North America at the box office in 1958 alone

During the May 1959 Mexican premiere at Américas Cinema in Mexico City, a riot started when, according to the local newspapers, 600 teenagers broke into the theater without paying the admission fee. The crowd occupied the balcony area and destroyed the seats while they threw flaming papers and debris to the attendants. As some women tried to leave the premises, they were stripped of their clothing by the rioters. The group was reported to be a mixture of university students and other locals. The anti-riot police arrived to the scene, and they scattered the crowd, but no arrests were made. Writer Parménides García Saldaña recounted the incident on his article &quot;El Rey Criollo&quot;, in which he detailed the presence of gangs and their harassment of the women in attendance.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Billboard&quot; wrote:

Elvis Presley&#x27;s new film shapes up as a box-office winner. It&#x27;s got plenty of action and characterisation and the star gives his best acting performance to date ... (the) Incidents and characters of the original novel are distorted, but the plot stands up well and the dialog is salty and emotion-packed. As Danny, Presley exhibits improved histrionics and provides many moving and tense moments. Carolyn Jones is a knockout as a fallen thrush who would like to love him; their aborted romance gives the pic its finest scenes.
&quot;Variety&quot; declared that the film &quot;shows the young star [Presley] as a better than fair actor&quot;.

Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also gave a favorable review:

Mr. Curtiz and his players have got it snugly draped around Mr. Presley&#x27;s shoulders. And there it stays, until a limp melodramatic home stretch, even with eight or so of those twitching, gyrating musical interludes. ... These also perfectly typify the Bourbon Street honky-tonks that Mr. Curtiz and his fine photographer, Russ Harlan, have beguilingly drenched with atmosphere. Matching, or balancing, the tunes are at least seven characterizations that supply the real backbone and tell the story of the picture. ... for Mr. Presley, in his third screen attempt, it&#x27;s a pleasure to find him up to a little more than Bourbon Street shoutin&#x27; and wigglin&#x27;. Acting is his assignment in this shrewdly upholstered showcase, and he does it, so help us over a picket fence.

&quot;The Spectator&quot;, however, criticized the relationship of Presley&#x27;s character with his love interests:

The girls in his (Michael Curtiz&#x27;s) latest film, King Creole, are both played by good, serious actresses: Carolyn Jones and Dolores Hart... Both are shown to be hungrily, desperately, unpridefully in love with him (Presley&#x27;s character). They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but a little rough affection... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with the air of a small, fastidious boy being pressed to eat marshmallow and, though he feels a bit sick, not quite knowing how to get out of it... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, though you may be put off at first by his pale, puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence you might imagine in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is pretty low on his list), are well worth taking a look at.

About Presley&#x27;s performance, &quot;DownBeat&quot; wrote, &quot;Let it be noted that Elvis Presley&#x27;s latest, King Creole, is his best picture thus far--comparatively speaking, of course. Maybe about 10 more films (and as many drama coaches) from now Elvis might begin to get an inkling of what acting&#x27;s all about.&quot;

&quot;TV-Radio Mirror&quot; praised Presley&#x27;s acting over his past roles: &quot;Elvis Presley does his strongest acting job so far. Two years ago, Presley on the screen was a laughing stock. But nobody is laughing now.&quot;

Meanwhile, The &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; criticized the violence depicted in the film and rated the movie a III, denoting poor, stating, &quot;This entangled series of cliches, each with more unlikely motivation than the last, provides the most unattractive Presley vehicle so far. His numbers only offer intermittent relief from the calculated violence and viciousness, and he can do little to balance the disagreeable movie.&quot;

&quot;Commonweal&quot; lamented the lack of punishment to the main character for his actions, but praised the director for his influence on Presley:

No doubt adults won&#x27;t be moved much by &quot;King Creole&quot; one way or the other, but unfortunately teenage audiences may be taken in, especially since Danny is supposed to be a sympathetic character and at the end goes unpunished by the police for his crimes ... It must be said in favor of Director Michael Curtiz that he does succeed in getting Presley to act every now and then, but the cards are stacked in such an obvious manner against Danny that even Montgomery Clift couldn&#x27;t have handled the role with conviction.

&quot;Catholic World&quot; commented:

Playing a part— an underprivileged youth who, on and off, displays some dignity and honest aspirations — that requires some histrionic effort, Presley shows signs that he is getting the hang of acting. The picture itself, however, after a promising enough beginning turns into a lurid melodramatic hash composed in about equal part of juvenile delinquency, gangsterism and sex. These may be legitimate dramatic subjects but the script gives them an illegitimate viewpoint and leaves muddled moral issues dangling.

&quot;The Florence Times&quot; wrote of Presley:

The fellow isn&#x27;t a bad actor. Of course, he&#x27;s nothing at all sensational and the Academy Award isn&#x27;t in danger, but there are Hollywood habitues who&#x27;ve gotten by for years with less ability. In fact, given the normal amount of the more painstaking type of direction, it is entirely possible that Mr. Wiggle-hips could develop into a really competent actor. As long, however, as he can continue to attract audiences in present proportions there&#x27;s little need in worrying with drama schools.

&quot;Allrovi&quot; rated the movie with four stars out of five, stating, &quot;The film&#x27;s highlight is a brief exchange of fisticuffs between Elvis and Walter Matthau. Together with &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, &quot;King Creole&quot; is one of the best filmed examples of the untamed, pre-army Elvis Presley.&quot;

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS by Paramount Pictures in 1986. In 2000, it was released on DVD with remastered sound and image, featuring the original theatrical trailer. On April 21, 2020, it was released on Blu-ray as part of the Paramount Presents label.

<doc id="1022343" wikidata="Q42546" url="?curid=1022343" title="Chausie">
<text>The Chausie () is a domestic breed of cat that was developed by breeding a few individuals from the non-domestic species jungle cat (&quot;Felis chaus&quot;) to a far greater number of domestic cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;). The Chausie was first recognized as a domestic breed by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1995. Within the domestic breeds, the Chausie is categorized as a non-domestic hybrid source breed. Because Chausies are mostly descended from domestic cats, by about the fourth generation they are fully fertile and completely domestic in temperament.

== History ==

The first hybrids of the jungle cat (&quot;Felis chaus&quot;) and the domestic cat (&quot;Felis silvestris catus&quot;) may have been born in Egypt several thousand years ago. The jungle cat is native to a vast region spanning Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East. For the most part, it is an Asian species of wild cat that lives by rivers and lakes. But the species is found in one small area of North Africa: the Nile Delta. It is well known that the ancient Egyptians kept domestic cats as pets. Many domestic cat mummies have been found interred in Egyptian temples. What is not so well known is that one other species of cat was occasionally preserved after death via mummification; that was the jungle cat. &quot;F. chaus&quot; is not a timid species; they are known for moving into abandoned buildings and living as happily by irrigation canals as by wild rivers, provided that adequate prey and shrubbery for cover are available. Because domestic cats are likely to have frequently encountered jungle cats along the Nile and occasionally even within their owners&#x27; homes, it seems that hybrids of the two species were probably often born there.

A few people experimented with breeding &quot;F. chaus&quot; to &quot;F. s. catus&quot; in the late 1960s and 1970s. Their intention was to provide a sensible alternative to keeping non-domestic cats as pets. However, the Chausie breed did not truly begin until the 1990s, when a dedicated group of breeders named the breed &quot;Chausie&quot; (after &quot;Felis chaus&quot;) and developed a planned breeding program and goals. These breeders asked for and received registration status from TICA in 1995. The breed worked its way through the New Breed Class from May 2001 through April 2013, and became TICA&#x27;s newest Championship breed on May 1, 2013. Chausies are now being bred in both North America and Europe. The breed has begun the new breed recognition process in the World Cat Federation (WCF).

== Characteristics ==

Currently, most authentic Chausies produced are late generation cats with fully domestic temperaments. Their TICA registration certificates will usually indicate that they are &quot;C&quot; generation or &quot;SBT,&quot; which nearly always means they are four generations or more beyond the jungle cat (&quot;F. chaus&quot;). In cases where they are &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; generation, it is usually because they have been recently outcrossed to another domestic breed to improve specific cosmetic traits, but the cats are nonetheless more than four generations beyond the handful of nondomestic ancestors.

Although the official, permissible outcrosses for the Chausie breed during early breed development were the Abyssinian and the domestic shorthair (no recognizable breed), in practice any kind of purely domestic outcross could be used. TICA rules only dictated that cats must be a certain number of generations removed from the jungle cat ancestors and have three generations of registered Chausie ancestors to be eligible for competition at shows. Consequently, a variety of breeds, albeit usually lively outgoing breeds (see below), were used to develop the Chausie breed and continue to be used occasionally as outcrosses. This has given the breed a diverse and healthy genetic foundation.

== Appearance ==

=== Body ===
Chausies are bred to be medium to large in size, as compared to traditional domestic breeds. Most Chausies are a little smaller than a male Maine Coon, for example, but larger than a Siamese. Adult Chausie males typically weigh . Adult females are usually . However, because Chausies are built for running and jumping, they are long-bodied and leggy with medium boning. The torso is deep-chested with flat sides. The ears are broad, tall, and set high on the head, about two fingers apart. The cheekbones are striking—prominent, long, and angular—and the eyes are flattened on top and form a half oval below.

=== Coat colors and patterns ===
The TICA Chausie breed standard allows three colors: solid black, black grizzled tabby, and black ( brown) ticked tabby. Because the Chausie breed is relatively new, Chausies are still frequently born that have a variety of other colors and patterns, but only cats in the three permissible colors can be entered in new breed classes at cat shows, and only the three colors will be eligible eventually for championship classes. Gold or yellow eye color is preferred, though yellower and lighter shades of green are allowed.

Solid black Chausies may have faint tabby markings (called ghost markings) as kittens, but usually acquire a dense, even black pigmentation with maturity. Sometimes black grizzled tabby Chausies will appear indistinguishable from solid black Chausies when the amount of grizzling is minimal. Exposure to strong sunlight, as with most black cats, can cause black Chausies to lighten slightly and appear brownish.
Black grizzled tabbies are unique to the Chausie breed among domestic cats. The grizzled pattern comes from the jungle cat; it is never found in domestic cats unless they have &quot;F. chaus&quot; ancestors. The kittens are often born completely black, although occasionally they may have a bit of light colored fur on the chin or neck at birth. As the kittens get older, they begin to look more and more like tabbies. However, they are tabbies with black on black markings. That is, the background color is a sort of dark brownish black, and the markings, such as the mid-line stripe on the spine, are pure black. In addition, alternating bands of off-white appear on individual hairs in the background color. The bands are along the middle of each hair. The root of each hair is mousie gray, while the tip of each hair is black. The off-white banding or &quot;ticking&quot; usually appears first on the neck, chin, and belly, as well as the insides of the ears. Later, the grizzling will often extend up the sides from belly to almost the spine. In the most heavily grizzled cats, the grizzling extends over the back of the neck, on the face, and even on the legs and tail. Usually the grizzling is complete by age 3 years. The effect in the best cats is spectacular. Grizzling does have a wide range of expression, however, and some cats never have more than a few banded hairs in the ears or in one spot on the belly, occasionally not even that.
Black ticked tabby Chausies have black ticking, black stripes on the inside of the upper legs and to a lesser extent on the outside, black rings on the tail, a black tail tip, and black tabby markings around the eyes. They are also known as brown ticked tabbies because, although the markings are black, the background color is brownish. The background color can vary in hue across a large range. While Chausie breeders try to avoid producing the very reddish brown background color seen in the Abyssinian breed, they do produce everything else in the range. Background color may be reddish gold, it may be a light golden brown, warm beige, cold beige, and even a very cool light gray with just a hint of brown in it. The latter is a very wild looking background color. Random polygenes influence the background color. Every time a black ticked tabby kitten is born, breeders start guessing what the background color will be, but it cannot be known for certain until the cat ages.

== Behavior ==
Because breeders outcrossed the foundation jungle cats to mostly intelligent, outgoing breeds such as the Abyssinian and Oriental Shorthair, Chausies are intelligent, active, athletic cats. They are often very &quot;busy&quot; as kittens. As adults, they are quieter, but they still retain a playfulness and lifelong curiosity. Chausies do not like to be alone; they need to have other cats as companions or have human company most of the time. Chausies get along well with dogs, too, and will do fine if raised with a canine in the house. Additionally, Chausies form deep bonds with people. They are loyal, and may have difficulty adjusting if re-homed as adults.

As with all non-domestic hybrid source breeds, some Chausies may inherit intestinal tracts similar to that of the non-domestic ancestors. The intestinal tract may be a little shorter than that of the traditional over elongated domestic cat&#x27;s. A shorter intestinal tract is known to be incapable of processing ingredients derived from plants. That would include any kind of cereals, as well as vegetables, herbs, and spices. Those ingredients will serve as triggers for chronic intestinal inflammation and eventually lead to chronic inflammatory bowel disease that is perpetuated by multiple allergies to low quality, incomplete proteins in commercial cat food. Regardless of the cause, Chausies do seem somewhat prone to developing food allergies. To prevent this, breeders advise Chausie owners to feed only very high quality cat foods, containing as little of plant-derived ingredients as possible, or a homemade diet. If homemade diets are fed, it should be with the guidance of someone experienced in preparing them, because meat by itself does not contain all the nutrients that Chausies require.

<doc id="1022345" wikidata="Q3562205" url="?curid=1022345" title="Multi-pitch climbing">
<text>Multi-pitch climbing is a type of climbing that typically takes place on routes that are more than a single rope length (circa 50 to 70 metres) in height (or distance), and thus where the lead climber cannot complete the climb as a single pitch. Where the number of pitches exceeds 6–10 (300–500 metres), it can become big wall climbing, or where the pitches are in a mixed rock and ice mountain environment, it can become alpine climbing. Multi-pitch rock climbs can come in traditional, sport, and aid formats. Some have free soloed multi-pitch routes.

Multi-pitch climbing is more complex and riskier than single-pitch climbing as the climbers will remain exposed on the route (e.g. a rock climbing route, an ice climbing, or a mixed climbing route) for longer, and it will often involve the use of hanging belays, long abseils, and the creation of belay anchors. Rescues from multi-pitch climbs are far more serious, and climbers will use additional protection to avoid this. Multi-pitch climbing requires greater communication between climbers; advanced climbers can use the riskier—but faster— simul climbing.

==Description==
Multi-pitch lead climbing involves ascending climbing routes that cannot be completed in a single pitch (which is typically a rope-length), usually due to their height but also due to routes that move in unusual directions (e.g. routes with a lot of traversing). Multi-pitch routes are most commonly traditional climbing routes (i.e. the leader inserts the climbing protection as they ascend), but there are also multi-pitch sport climbing routes (i.e. the climbing protection is pre-bolted into the route, or at least where important belay anchors are pre-bolted such as on El Capitan in Yosemite).

Multi-pitch climbs are usually done in teams of pairs, and the position of leader can alternate between pitches or after a group of pitches (called &quot;block leading&quot;) as long as both climbers have the skill and competence to lead on the route. Alternatively, one climber can lead all of the pitches while the other climber constantly belays them, and is then belayed themselves from the top by the lead climber on each pitch (see image left). Where both climbers are very comfortable on the terrain and want to move quickly, they can use simul climbing, although this is a more complex and riskier technique.

In addition to climbing in pairs, multi-pitch climbs can be done as solo climbs, either as free solo climbing (i.e. no protection used), or as rope solo climbing (i.e. a self-belaying system used).

The boundary between multi-pitch climbing and big wall climbing or alpine climbing is not defined. Generally, multi-pitch routes that are &quot;at least&quot; 6–10 pitches or 300–500 metres in length, and mostly require hanging belays (i.e. due to the sheer nature of the route) are considered &quot;big wall routes&quot;. Long multi-pitch climbs on mountains whose route is not continually on a sheer &quot;big wall&quot; face, are sometimes referred to as alpine rock climbing. Ice climbing and mixed climbing can also be done as multi-pitch climbing, or as part of an alpine climbing route.

==Equipment==
Multi-pitch climbing requires all the equipment used in leading a single-pitch sport, traditional or ice climbing route, but with a few specific additions:

* Extra belaying equipment. Multi-pitch climbers need additional slings, cord, and screwgate carabiners to create strong and secure belay anchors at the end of each pitch. In addition, belaying from above usually requires additional self-locking devices (e.g. grigris). For longer multi-pitch routes (i.e. closer to big wall climbing), ascenders might be used by the second climber to speed progression.
* Abseiling equipment. Even where the multi-pitch climbers can exit upon completing the climb via a walking trail (versus having to abseil back down), the risk of a forced retreat during the climb means that sufficient equipment for safe abseiling is also always carried; this means having several abseil devices (e.g. the figure 8), additional prusik cords, and also extra coils of rope as a basic requirement.
* Protective clothing. A forced abseil retreat on a multi-pitch climb can be risky, however, abseiling an injured climber on a multi-pitch route is an even more serious undertaking. Multi-pitch climbers will therefore tend to take additional precautions that they might not use on single-pitch routes such as wearing helmets and belay gloves or fingerless climbing gloves, to minimize the risk of retreat from any form of injury. They will also bring additional food and water provisions and all-weather clothing as well.

==Techniques==

While many of the techniques of single-pitch lead climbing are common to multi-pitch climbing, there are specific techniques that are important to be able to execute well to safely ascend a multi-pitch climbing route:

* Belay anchors. A key technique in multi-pitch climbing is the ability to create very robust belay anchors that can hold the strong downward and upward forces a belayer can experience on a multi-pitch route in any climber fall. Some of these anchors may also need to be used later as abseil points in the event of a retreat or after summiting the route. Popular multi-pitch routes can have permanent bolted belay anchors.
* Hanging belays and belaying from above. Some multi-pitch climbs will have belay points that have no ledge to stand on, and thus the belayer will be hanging from the rock face from the belay anchor. In addition, belaying from above a climber can involve additional belay equipment (such as a grigri) and techniques to avoid forces being applied directly to the belayer&#x27;s harness in the event of a climber fall.
* Changing leads. Multi-pitch climbers sometimes need to be able to switch roles efficiently at the end of each pitch. Where the pair alternate leads, the second climber can continue past the belay to lead the next pitch (e.g., the belayer keeps belaying). However, where they need to swap roles at the belay anchor, there are a number of techniques required to ensure that the changeover is done safely and efficiently.
* Communication. Because of the greater distances between climbers (the individual pitches of multi-pitch routes are often typically a full rope-length), and the need for the lead climber to have the time to set up a strong belay anchor, it is important that the pair understand the signals and commands that indicate when such tasks have been completed and the lead climber is ready to belay.
* Fall factor management. Multi-pitch climbers need to avoid the lead climber falling with no climbing protection in situ, so that they fall all the way down to the belayer and then the same distance again below the belayer. Such a fall has a fall-factor of 2 and will create significant strains on both the belay anchors and the belayer. To avoid this, the lead will clip into protection just above the belay anchor.
* Rope management. Once the lead climber creates the new belay anchor to belay their partner below, they need to take in the slack rope until there is a taut line between the pair. As they will often be standing on a small platform (or even no platform in a hanging belay), they need to ensure that the rope they pull up does not get caught up equipment or get tangled, and will therefore use some manner of coiling technique.
* Time and retreat management. Retreat from a multi-pitch climb can be difficult, and at a minimum will require abseils which are in themselves a risk factor. Mult-pitch climbers, therefore, need to be aware of their time-keeping, and the specific points at which retreat becomes more difficult, and/or where abseil points are less plentiful (some popular multi-pitch routes have bolted belay anchors that double as abseil points).

==Competition multi-pitch climbing==
In October 2022, the first competition climbing event in a multi-pitch format was hosted on an artificial climbing wall built on the Verzasca Dam in Switzerland as the &#x27;Red Bull Dual Ascent&#x27;. Teams of climbing pairs faced off in head-to-head contests on identical side-by-side 6-pitch routes, with the winning team finishing the route in the fastest time. Unlimited falls were allowed as long as the lead climber returned to the base of the pitch (or penalty points were accepted instead). The first event was won by Alberto Ginés López and Luka Potočar. The October 2023 event was held in a mixed team format, with Jernej Kruder and his sister Julija Kruder taking first prize.

==Grading==
Multi-pitch climbing routes are generally graded in the same way as their equivalent single-pitch sport route grading, traditional route grading, or ice route grading routes. Each pitch on a multi-pitch route will be separately graded so that, for example, a 3-pitch multi-sport climbing route might be graded as French sport: 7c, 7b, 8a; or a 5-pitch multi-traditional climbing route might be graded as American YDS: 5.10a, 5.10b, 5.10a, 5.11c, 5.9. Harder or easier options on individual pitches will also be highlighted and separately graded, so that, for example, a pitch might be graded as French sport: 7c &quot;avoidable&quot; or &quot;max&quot; (you don&#x27;t have to do the 7c part) / 7a &quot;obligatory&quot; or &quot;obj&quot; (you will have to do at least 7a graded climbing).

Sometimes an &quot;overall&quot; grade is quoted for a multi-pitch route (in addition to the grades of individual pitches), however, this is usually the grade of the hardest pitch on the route (e.g. see &quot;Yeah Man&quot; image opposite).

In common with big wall grading, where there are very difficult sections of individual pitches that are well above the general level of difficulty of the overall route (i.e. a common feature of bigger walls as it is harder to find big routes of a consistent difficulty level), an aid climbing option might be highlighted, which will have an attached aid climbing grade, for example, an individual pitch on a multi-traditional climbing route might be graded as: 5.10a (with no aid) or 5.7 A2 (with aid), and the type of aid needed also explained.

==In film==
A number of notable films have been made focused on multi-pitch (and big wall climbing) including: 
*&quot;El Capitan&quot;, a 1978 documentary film about an early ascent of &quot;The Nose&quot; (VI 5.9 C2) on El Capitan.
*&quot;Meru&quot;, a 2015 documentary film about the ascent of a Himalayan big wall route called the &quot;Shark&#x27;s Fin&quot;,
*&quot;Valley Uprising&quot;, a 2014 Amazon Prime documentary film about rock climbing in Yosemite, that includes big wall climbing.
*&quot;The Dawn Wall&quot;, a 2017 Netflix documentary film about Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson&#x27;s ascent of the first-ever big wall route at .
*&quot;Free Solo&quot;, a 2018 Netflix documentary film about Alex Honnold&#x27;s free solo climb of &quot;Freerider&quot; on El Capitan.
* &quot;The Alpinist&quot;, a 2021 documentary film about the late Canadian alpinist Marc-André Leclerc, featuring his solo ascent of Torre Egger in Patagonia

<text>&quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot;: Adventures of a Curious Character is an edited collection of reminiscences by the Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman. The book, published in 1985, covers a variety of instances in Feynman&#x27;s life. The anecdotes in the book are based on recorded audio conversations that Feynman had with his close friend and drumming partner Ralph Leighton.

==Summary==
The book has many stories which are lighthearted in tone, such as his fascination with safe-cracking, studying various languages, participating with groups of people who share different interests (such as biology or philosophy), and ventures into art and samba music. 

Other stories cover more serious material, including his work on the Manhattan Project (during which his first wife, Arline, died of tuberculosis) and his critique of the science education system in Brazil. The section &quot;Monster Minds&quot; describes his slightly nervous presentation of his graduate work on the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory in front of Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, Henry Norris Russell, John von Neumann, and other major scientists of the time.

The anecdotes were edited from taped conversations that Feynman had with his close friend and drumming partner Ralph Leighton. Its surprise success led to a sequel, &quot;What Do You Care What Other People Think?&quot;, also taken from Leighton&#x27;s taped conversations. &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot; became a national bestseller.

The book&#x27;s title is taken from a comment made by a woman at Princeton University after Feynman asked for both cream and lemon in his tea, not being familiar with the proper etiquette.

The final chapter, &quot;Cargo Cult Science&quot;, was adapted from Feynman&#x27;s 1974 commencement address at the California Institute of Technology, in which he cautioned graduates not to minimize the weaknesses of their research in the pursuit of a preferred conclusion. He drew an analogy to the cargo cult phenomenon in the South Pacific Ocean in which, as he understood it, islanders built a mock airstrip to cause airplanes loaded with imported goods to land. Similarly, he argued, adopting the appearances of scientific investigation without a self-critical attitude will fail to produce reliable results.

==Reception==
Feynman&#x27;s &quot;cargo cult&quot; metaphor was used by Tomasz Witkowski in his criticism of social science and psychology in particular. In the first part of his book &quot;Psychology Led Astray&quot;, Witkowski asks &quot;Is Psychology a Cargo Cult Science?&quot;, pointing out that the growth in the number of psychologists worldwide has been parallel with a decrease in mental health. He also points to other articles applying the cargo cult metaphor to criticize social sciences.

Murray Gell-Mann was upset by Feynman&#x27;s account in the book of the weak-interaction work and threatened to sue, resulting in a correction being inserted in later editions.

Feynman was criticized for a chapter titled &quot;You Just &quot;Ask&quot; Them?&quot; where he recounts attempting to pick up a woman, insulting her after she refuses his advances. Feynman states at the end of the chapter that this behavior was not typical.

<text>Kelly Bishop (born Carole Jane Bishop; on February 28, 1944) is an American actress and dancer, best known for her roles as matriarch Emily Gilmore on the series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; and as Marjorie Houseman, the mother of Jennifer Grey&#x27;s Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman in the film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;. Bishop originated the role of Sheila in &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; for which she won a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical. In 2023, she starred as Mrs. Ivey in &quot;The Watchful Eye&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Bishop was born on February 28, 1944, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. She grew up in Denver, Colorado, where she trained to be a ballet dancer, and as a teenager, moved to California attending the San Jose Ballet School. At 18, she headed to New York City and landed her first job dancing in a year-round ballet company at Radio City Music Hall. Bishop continued to dance in Las Vegas, summer stock, and on television until she was cast in 1967 in &quot;Golden Rainbow,&quot; her first Broadway role.

==Career==

Bishop moved to New York City to try to become a ballet dancer. Bishop&#x27;s big break came when she was cast as the sexy, hard-edged Sheila in the 1975 Broadway production of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, for which she won the 1976 Tony Award as &quot;Best Supporting or Featured Actress (Musical)&quot; as well as the 1976 Drama Desk Award for &quot;Outstanding Actress in a Musical&quot;. Many details of the character Sheila&#x27;s past were drawn from Bishop&#x27;s real life, as she helped develop the character during early workshops. She was also cast in Broadway productions of &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;, Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Proposals&quot;, the Tony Award-winning &quot;The Last Night of Ballyhoo&quot;, and &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. 

In film, she was cast opposite Jill Clayburgh in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s big-screen drama &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot; (1978). In the 1987 film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, she was originally set for a small role, but took on the much bigger role of Mrs. Houseman when Lynne Lipton (originally cast to play the role) fell ill during the first week of shooting.

Bishop went on to play mothers to high-profile stars in features: Howard Stern&#x27;s in the Betty Thomas-directed comedy &quot;Private Parts&quot; (1997), and Tobey Maguire&#x27;s in &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; (2000). Additional feature credits include &quot;Ich und Er&quot; (USA: &quot;Me and Him&quot;, 1988), &quot;Queens Logic&quot; (1991), &quot;Cafe Society&quot; (1995), &quot;Miami Rhapsody&quot; (1995) and &quot;Blue Moon&quot; (2002).

Bishop debuted on television in &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. She starred in the Mike Nichols&#x27; series &quot;The Thorns&quot; in 1988. She played Lisa Ann Walter&#x27;s mother on &quot;My Wildest Dreams&quot; in 1995. She guest-starred on, among other series, &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;.

From 2000 to 2007, Bishop starred in The WB/CW series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as wealthy New England matriarch Emily Gilmore. She reprised her role in the 2016 miniseries &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot; on Netflix. She would later reunite with Amy Sherman-Palladino, who created &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, on &quot;Bunheads&quot;, which aired from 2012 to 2013 and was canceled after the first season. Bishop has since appeared in television shows including &quot;Army Wives&quot;, &quot;Mercy&quot;, &quot;The Good Wife&quot;, and playing Benedetta in the Golden Globe-winning series &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;, in which she was again reunited with Sherman-Palladino. Bishop currently stars in the TV drama series &quot;The Watchful Eye&quot; (which premiered on January 30, 2023) as Mrs. Ivey.

Following the end of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, Bishop returned to theater, performing in &quot;Becky Shaw&quot; at the Second Stage Theatre in 2008 and as Evangeline Harcourt in the 2011 revival of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; alongside Sutton Foster and Joel Grey, as well as appearing in the 2011 movie &quot;Friends with Kids&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bishop resides in South Orange, New Jersey. She was first married to stagehand and electrician Peter Miller in 1970 before divorcing in 1975. She was married to the TV talk show host Lee Leonard until his death in 2018.

McCarthy began appearing in television and film in the late 1990s and first gained recognition for her role as Sookie St. James on the television series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000–2007). She played Dena on the ABC sitcom &quot;Samantha Who?&quot; (2007–2009) before starring as Molly Flynn on the CBS sitcom &quot;Mike &amp; Molly&quot; (2010–2016), for which she received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 2011. McCarthy&#x27;s appearances as a host on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (2011–2017) led to a win for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2017.

McCarthy gained critical acclaim for her performance in the comedy film &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; (2011), receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She went on to star in several commercially successful comedies, including &quot;Identity Thief&quot; (2013), &quot;The Heat&quot; (2013), &quot;Tammy&quot; (2014), &quot;St. Vincent&quot; (2014), &quot;Spy&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Boss&quot; (2016).

When Samantha wakes from her coma, Dena convinces Samantha that they have always been best friends. While Andrea eventually forces her to reveal the truth, Samantha still remains friends with Dena. She guest starred in &quot;Rita Rocks&quot; and on &quot;Private Practice&quot;. In 2010, McCarthy played supporting roles in films &quot;The Back-up Plan&quot; and &quot;Life as We Know It&quot;.

===2011–2017: &quot;Mike and Molly&quot;, &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; and mainstream success===

In 2010, McCarthy was cast in a leading role on the CBS sitcom &quot;Mike &amp; Molly&quot;. Television critic Lucy Mangan from the &quot;Guardian&quot; commended McCarthy and her co-star Billy Gardell on some “unfeasibly delicate and charming work”, while decrying the show itself for hanging every one of its gags on the subject of their weight. In 2011, McCarthy had a breakout performance in the comedy film &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; alongside Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper. She received wide critical acclaim and press coverage for her performance. McCarthy received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. She received BAFTA, Critics&#x27; Choice and Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations, and well as won Boston Society of Film Critics Award, New York Film Critics Online Award for Best Supporting Actress, Women Film Critics Circle Award for Best Comedic Actress, and MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance. 
One of McCarthy&#x27;s most memorable scenes in &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; was improvised, according to director Paul Feig. In fall 2011, after achieving fame from &quot;Bridesmaids&quot;, she received her first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her role on &quot;Mike &amp; Molly&quot;. 

In June 2011, she hosted the Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards. She was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in June 2012 along with 175 others. McCarthy hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on October 1, 2011, April 6, 2013, February 1, 2014, February 13, 2016, and May 12, 2017.

After her &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; breakout, McCarthy had supporting roles in the comedy films &quot;This Is 40&quot; (2012), the spinoff to Judd Apatow&#x27;s film &quot;Knocked Up&quot;, and &quot;The Hangover Part III&quot; (2013). 

In 2013, McCarthy co-starred in the crime comedy &quot;Identity Thief&quot; with Jason Bateman. &quot;Identity Thief&quot;, her star vehicle, opened at No. 1 at the box office, and grossed $174 million worldwide despite negative reviews. R. Kurt Osenlund of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; praised McCarthy&#x27;s performance, writing that she &quot;gives a performance leagues better than anything to be expected in a mainstream, early-in-the-year release, padding a typically sketched character with layers of hilarity and pathos. McCarthy owns &#x27;Identity Thief&#x27; with a turn of limitless surprise, making an otherwise adequate comedy soar as a star vehicle. She is riveting in simply-penned moments of remorse and confession, adding tearful depth to her ace timing and formidable physical comedy.&quot; Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety magazine&quot; praised McCarthy but criticized the script, saying &quot;Melissa McCarthy proves she’s got what it takes to carry a feature, however meager the underlying material.&quot; She received People&#x27;s Choice and MTV Movie Awards nomination for her performance. Later in 2013, McCarthy co-starred with Sandra Bullock in the buddy cop comedy &quot;The Heat&quot;. The film was released in the United States and Canada on June 28, 2013, to both critical and commercial success. With McCarthy being called &quot;box office gold,&quot; &quot;The Heat&quot; grossed $229 million worldwide. She won American Comedy Award for Best Comedy Actress - Film, and well as received nominations an Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in a Comedy and MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.

In 2013, McCarthy founded the production company On the Day Productions with her husband Ben Falcone. &quot;Tammy&quot; was the company&#x27;s first project. The film cost $20 million. McCarthy co-wrote the script for the road comedy film, which was released in 2014. McCarthy&#x27;s character loses her job and her car, and then learns that her husband has been unfaithful. To get away, she is forced to rely on her alcoholic grandmother (Susan Sarandon) for transportation as they embark on a journey of self-discovery. Although a box office success, grossing over $100 million from a $20 million budget, it received highly negative reviews from critics with McCarthy received Razzie nomination for Worst Actress. On Rotten Tomatoes, the site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Melissa McCarthy remains an engaging screen presence, but her efforts aren&#x27;t enough to keep the jumbled &quot;Tammy&quot; on track.&quot; Later in 2014, McCarthy played the female lead, opposite Bill Murray, in the comedy-drama film &quot;St. Vincent&quot;, directed and written by Theodore Melfi. The film received positive reviews from critics and her performance as an overworked single mom was noted.

In May 2015, McCarthy received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In August 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked her as the third highest-paid actress of 2015, with earnings of $23 million. Also in 2015, McCarthy played the lead in frequent collaborator Paul Feig&#x27;s spy comedy &quot;Spy&quot;, a role that earned McCarthy her first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed $235 million worldwide against a $65 million budget. McCarthy&#x27;s performance was praised by critics. Richard Roeper of &quot;The Chicago Sun Times&quot; called her &quot;as funny and as winning as anyone in the movies these days&quot;. Tom Russo of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; credited the film&#x27;s success to McCarthy, writing, &quot;part of what makes the action comedy such a loopy blast is the identity shifts she pulls on the audience.&quot; Bill Goodykoontz of &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; called the film McCarthy&#x27;s return to form, writing &quot;Finally, after the promise shown in &quot;Bridesmaids&quot;, but sold short since by weak scripts in films like &quot;Tammy&quot; and &quot;Identity Thief&quot;, Melissa McCarthy gets a movie vehicle worthy of her talents.&quot;

In 2016, McCarthy starred in the comedy film &quot;The Boss&quot;, a film based on a character which McCarthy had created in the Los Angeles Groundlings – a wealthy businesswoman &quot;who goes to jail for insider trading, and struggles to reinvent herself as America&#x27;s new sweetheart when she&#x27;s released&quot;. Although it received generally negative reviews from critics, it grossed over $78 million worldwide on a budget of $29 million. Also that year, she played an author and scientist in the all-female reboot of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, directed by Paul Feig. The film grossed $229.1 million worldwide against its $144 million budget, making it a box office bomb with losses of over $70 million following theaters taking their revenue cut.

The commercial featured the song &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot;.

===2018–present: Dramatic roles and awards recognition===

McCarthy starred and produced another comedy film directed by Ben Falcone, &quot;Life of the Party&quot;. The film was released on May 11, 2018. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $65 million. She also starred in &quot;The Happytime Murders&quot;, an adult puppet buddy cop crime comedy film directed by Brian Henson. The film was released on August 24, 2018, and received mostly negative reviews and was a box-office bomb, grossing $27.5 million worldwide against a $40–47 million budget. It went on to debut to $9.5 million, marking the lowest opening of McCarthy&#x27;s career as a lead. 

Later in 2018, she starred as celebrity biographer Lee Israel in the dark comedy-drama film &quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&quot; directed by Marielle Heller. She replaced Julianne Moore, who was fired shortly before shooting was to begin. McCarthy&#x27;s performance as Lee drew high praise. &quot;Film Journal International&quot; said McCarthy&#x27;s performance is &quot;stunning&quot;, and her previous film roles &quot;could not anticipate how fearlessly and credibly she inhabits Lee Israel.&quot; 

She received an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination, and well as Golden Globe, Critics&#x27; Choice, Screen Actors Guild Awards and BAFTA Awards nominations. She won Best Actress awards from New York Film Critics Online, San Francisco Bay Area Film Critics Circle, Boston Society of Film Critics, Vancouver Film Critics Circle and Florida Film Critics Circle. At the 39th Golden Raspberry Awards, McCarthy won two awards: for Worst Actress (&quot;Life of the Party&quot; and &quot;The Happytime Murders&quot;) and Redeemer Award for her &quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&quot; performance.

In 2019, McCarthy played the lead in the crime film &quot;The Kitchen&quot;. It received mostly negative reviews from critics and was a box-office bomb. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman described the film as &quot;just like &quot;Widows&quot;, except not as good.&quot; Gleiberman was critical of the script but praised McCarthy&#x27;s fierce performance. The following year, she returned to comedy with the leading role in the &quot;Superintelligence&quot;. In 2021, she starred in the superhero comedy film &quot;Thunder Force&quot;, and the comedy-drama film &quot;The Starling&quot;, both was released on Netflix.

She executive produced and starred in the Hulu limited thriller drama series, &quot;Nine Perfect Strangers&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Lucy Mangan said: &quot;Most engagingly, there is Melissa McCarthy, sweeping all before her as charismatic, bestselling author Frances, who has recently been dealt harsh blows and is here to have pampered time to recover. As is so often the case with the magnificent McCarthy, she is the best, most arresting thing in the series, and every time she comes back on screen you wriggle with delight.&quot; She received Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Movie/Miniseries for her performance in series. In 2022, she co-starred with Ben Falcone in the Netflix comedy series, &quot;God&#x27;s Favorite Idiot&quot;.

On June 28, 2019, it was announced that McCarthy was in talks to play Ursula in Disney&#x27;s film &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, set to be directed by Rob Marshall. On February 18, 2020, McCarthy confirmed her casting as the villainess during an interview on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;. The film was released in 2023 and grossed over $569 million worldwide against a total production budget of $250 million. Peter Debruge from the &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;If Bailey is the film’s big discovery, then McCarthy is its no-brainer. Dolled up to look like Divine’s evil-stepsister in her glowing green lair, the comic star’s just delicious as the movie’s deep-sea villain. Her timing is impeccable, and though the part is virtually identical to the one Pat Carroll originated, she aces what’s demanded of these tricky remakes: Basically, McCarthy manages to hit every beat the super fans expect, while surprising with every pause and inflection.&quot;

McCarthy starred opposite Jerry Seinfeld in the comedy film &quot;Unfrosted&quot; for Netflix. She also set to star in the film &quot;Genie&quot; written by Richard Curtis.

==Personal life==
McCarthy married her longtime boyfriend Ben Falcone, an actor and member of The Groundlings, on October 8, 2005. The couple have two daughters, Vivian and Georgette. McCarthy&#x27;s pregnancy with Vivian was written into the last season of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. Vivian and Georgette both made an appearance in the 2016 film &quot;The Boss&quot;, with the former playing a younger version of her mother&#x27;s character.

Falcone often makes cameo appearances in McCarthy&#x27;s films and TV series, such as a third-season episode of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, &quot;The Nines&quot;, &quot;Bridesmaids&quot;, &quot;The Heat&quot;, &quot;Tammy&quot;, &quot;Identity Thief&quot;, &quot;Spy&quot;, &quot;The Boss&quot;, &quot;Life of the Party&quot;, &quot;The Happytime Murders&quot;, &quot;Thunder Force&quot;, &quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&quot; and &quot;Nine Perfect Strangers.&quot;

In the April 2021 issue of &quot;Instyle&quot;, McCarthy said that, with regard to politics, &quot;It&#x27;s very polarizing, but, I mean, I&#x27;m on the left for sure, though I&#x27;m not an extremist. And I think just saying like, &quot;Can&#x27;t we all just be kind to each other?&quot; and that gets a &quot;F— you, lady,&quot; I don&#x27;t know what to do.&quot;

In August 2021, McCarthy joined the 40x40 campaign launched by Meghan Markle to mark her 40th birthday. 40x40 is a campaign that asks people around the world to spend 40 minutes of their time mentoring women reentering the workforce and combating the outsized economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women.

McCarthy studied textiles at Southern Illinois University and was interested in a fashion career before she pursued her interests in acting. When she moved to New York City, it was to attend the Fashion Institute of Technology. One of her closest friends is the shoe designer Brian Atwood. McCarthy also spent time working as a customer for a dance company.

In 2015, McCarthy announced her first clothing collection, Melissa McCarthy Seven7, for plus-size women. The line includes clothes up to size 28. In an interview with More, McCarthy stated that &quot;people don&#x27;t stop at size 12. I feel like there&#x27;s a big thing missing where you can&#x27;t dress to your mood above a certain number. Malls segregate &quot;plus-size&quot; clothes stores and hide these stores away from other sections of the mall.&quot; Seven7, which was developed alongside Sunrise Brands, debuted in August 2015 on the Home Shopping Network.

<text>Osteoprotegerin (OPG), also known as osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (OCIF) or tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 11B (TNFRSF11B), is a cytokine receptor of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily encoded by the &quot;TNFRSF11B&quot; gene.

OPG was first discovered as a novel secreted TNFR related protein that played a role in the regulation of bone density and later for its role as a decoy receptor for receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL). OPG also binds to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and inhibits TRAIL induced apoptosis of specific cells, including tumour cells. Other OPG ligands include syndecan-1, glycosaminoglycans, von Willebrand factor, and factor VIII-von Willebrand factor complex.

OPG has been identified as having a role in tumour growth and metastasis, heart disease, immune system development and signalling, mental health, diabetes, and the prevention of pre-eclampsia and osteoporosis during pregnancy.

== Biochemistry ==

OPG is largely expressed by osteoblast lineage cells of bone, epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, breast and skin, vascular endothelial cells, as well as B-cells and dendritic cells in the immune system.

OPG is a soluble glycoprotein which can be found as either a 60-kDa monomer or a 120-kDa dimer linked by disulfide bonds. The dimerisation of OPG is necessary for RANK-RANKL inhibition as dimerisation increases the affinity of OPG for RANKL (from a KD of 3 μM as a monomer to 10nM as a dimer). As a monomer, OPG would have insufficient affinity for RANKL to compete with RANK and effectively suppress RANK-RANKL interactions.

OPG proteins are made up of 380 amino acids which form seven functional domains. Domains 1-4 are cysteine-rich N-terminal domains that interact with RANKL during binding. Domains 5-6 are death domains that contribute to the dimerisation of OPG. Domain 7 is a C-terminal heparin-binding domain ending with a cysteine (Cys-400) which also plays an important role in the dimerisation of OPG.

OPG expression can be upregulated by IL-1β, 1α,25(OH)2D3, Wnt/β-catenin signalling through Wnt16, Wnt4 and Wnt3a TNFα and estrogen. OPG expression can also be upregulated transcriptionally through DNA binding sites for estrogen receptor α (ER-α) and TCF in the promoter region of the OPG gene. 
Downregulation of OPG can be effected by TGF-β1, PTH and DNA methylation of a CpG island in the OPG gene.

=== Estrogen and OPG regulation ===

OPG expression in osteoblast lineage cells is highly regulated by estrogens such as estradiol (E2). E2 transcriptionally regulates OPG expression through binding estrogen receptors (predominantly ER-α) on osteoblast lineage cell surfaces. The E2-ERα complex then translocates into the cell nucleus where it binds an estrogen response element in the promoter region of the OPG gene to upregulate OPG mRNA transcription.

Estrogens can also post-transcriptionally regulate OPG protein expression through the suppression of the microRNA (miRNA) miR-145. miR-145 binds miRNA binding sites in the 3’UTR of OPG mRNA transcripts and suppresses the translation of OPG proteins. Estrogen binds its ER-β receptor on the cell surface to suppress many miRNAs, including miR-145, thus blocking inhibition of OPG mRNA translation.

Estrogen suppresses osteoclastogenesis through the upregulation of OPG expression in osteoblast lineage cells. Androgens such as testosterone and DHT also inhibit osteoclastogenesis, however androgens act directly through androgen receptors on osteoclast precursor cells without affecting OPG expression in osteoblasts. Further, in the absence of aromatase enzymes converting testosterone into estrogen, testosterone and DHT downregulate OPG mRNA expression.

== Function ==

OPG plays an important role in bone metabolism as a decoy receptor for RANKL in the RANK/RANKL/OPG axis, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. OPG has also been shown to bind and inhibit TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) which is responsible for inducing apoptosis in tumour, infected and mutated cells.

=== Bone metabolism ===

The RANK/RANKL/OPG axis is a critical pathway in maintaining the symbiosis between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. RANKL is released by osteoblast lineage cells and binds to receptor RANK on the surface of osteoclast progenitor cells RANK-RANKL binding activates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway resulting in the upregulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). NFATc1 is a master regulator for the expression of essential cytokines during the differentiation of osteoclast precursor cells into mature osteoclasts, known as osteoclastogenesis. Mature osteoclasts then bind to bone through tight junctions and release digestive enzymes to resorb the old bone. As bone is resorbed, collagen and minerals are released into the local microenvironment creating both the space and minerals needed for osteoblasts to lay down new bone. As a decoy receptor for RANKL, OPG inhibits RANK-RANKL interactions thus suppressing osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.

OPG is also a decoy receptor for TRAIL, another regulator of osteoclastogenesis in osteoclast precursor cells and an autocrine signal for mature osteoclast cell death. TRAIL induces osteoclastogenesis by binding to specific TRAIL receptors on osteoclast precursor cell surfaces, inducing TRAF6 signalling, activating NF-κB signalling and upregulating NFATc1 expression. During osteoclastogenesis the different TRAIL receptors on the cell surface change resulting in an increase of apoptosis inducing TRAIL receptors expressed on mature osteoclasts.
As a decoy receptor for both RANKL and TRAIL, OPG simultaneously suppresses osteoclastogenesis while also inhibiting TRAIL induced cell death of mature osteoclast cells. OPG has an equally high affinity for RANKL and TRAIL suggesting that it is equally effective at blocking osteoclastogenesis and inhibiting osteoclast apoptosis.

== Disease ==
=== Atrophic nonunion shaft fractures ===
A normal steady state of bone metabolism seems to be present in patients with atrophic nonunion fractures, despite the high serum OPG. Only serum OPG was significantly higher in the patients compared to healed and healing controls. (49)

=== Osteoporosis ===
Osteoporosis is a bone-related disease caused by increased rates of bone resorption compared to bone formation. A higher rate of resorption is often caused by increased osteoclastogenesis and results in symptoms of osteopenia such as excessive bone loss and low bone mineral density.

Osteoporosis is often triggered in post-menopausal women due to reduced estrogen levels associated with the depletion of hormone-releasing ovarian follicles. Decreasing estrogen levels result in the downregulation of OPG expression and reduced inhibition of RANKL. Therefore RANKL can more readily bind to RANK and cause the increased osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption seen in osteoporosis. Decreased estrogen is a common cause of osteoporosis that can be seen in other conditions such as ovariectomy, ovarian failure, anorexia, and hyperprolactinaemia.

Osteoblastic synthesis of bone does not increase to compensate for the accelerated bone resorption as the lower estrogen levels result in increased rates of osteoblast apoptosis. The higher rate of bone resorption compared to bone formation leads to the increased porosity and low bone mineral density of individuals with osteoporosis.

=== Cancer ===
Tumour endothelial cells have been found to express higher levels of OPG when compared to normal endothelial cells. When in contact with tumour cells, endothelial cells express higher levels of OPG in response to integrin αvβ3 ligation and the stimulation of NF-kB signalling.

OPG expression has been found to promote tumour growth and survival through driving tumour vascularisation and inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

OPG has been identified as one of the many pro-angiogenic factors involved in the vascularisation of tumours. Tumour angiogenesis is required for tumour growth and movement as it supplies the tumour with nutrients and allows metastatic cells to enter the bloodstream. As a decoy receptor for TRAIL, OPG also promotes tumour cell survival by inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptosis of tumour cells.

==== Bone metastasis ====
Bone is a common site of metastasis in cancers such as breast, prostate and lung cancer. In osteolytic bone metastases, tumour cells migrate to the bone and release cytokines such as parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), IL-8 and PGE2. These cytokines act on osteoblasts to increase RANKL and decrease OPG expression resulting in excess bone resorption. During resorption osteoclasts release nutrients such as growth factors and calcium from the mineralised bone matrix which cultivates a supportive environment for the proliferation and survival of tumour cells.

Most bone metastases result in osteolytic lesions, however prostate cancer causes osteoblastic lesions characterised by excess bone formation and high bone density. Prostate cancer releases cytokines such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF), endothelin-1, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), sclerostin and Wnt proteins that act on local bone to increase osteoblast proliferation and activity. Wnt proteins also act on osteoblasts to upregulate OPG expression through β-catenin signalling and suppress osteoclastic bone resorption.

==== Multiple myeloma ====
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer involving malignant plasma cells, called myeloma cells, within the bone marrow. Multiple myeloma is associated with osteolytic bone lesions as the usually high levels of OPG in the bone marrow are diminished resulting in increased osteoclastic absorption. The reduced OPG in multiple myeloma is caused by suppression of both constitutive OPG transcription and the OPG inducing cytokines TGF-β and Wnt. In addition, the efficacy of OPG in bone marrow is impeded with multiple myeloma by excessive binding to syndecan-1. OPG binds to syndecan-1 on the surface of normal and multiple myeloma plasma cells to be internalised and degraded. However the overabundance of proliferating myeloma cells results in the excessive binding and inhibition of OPG by syndecan-1. Simultaneously, multiple myeloma is associated with unusually high levels of osteoclastogenesis-inducing factors.
The decreased OPG transcription and increased OPG protein degradation combined with increased osteoclastogenesis result in the osteolytic lesions that are characteristic of multiple myeloma.

====Otosclerosis====
Otosclerosis is a disorder of the middle ear, characterized by abnormal bone growth at the foot plate of the stapes which affect its mobility, resulting in progressive hearing loss. OPG gene polymorphisms c.9C&gt;G and c.30+15C&gt; have shown genetic association with OTSC in Indian and Tunisian populations. Some of the reports have shown significantly reduced or missing OPG expression in otosclerotic tissues which might be a causal factor for abnormal bone remodeling during disease manifestation. 

=== Juvenile Paget&#x27;s disease ===
This is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is associated with mutations in this gene.

<text>The Strawbs are an English rock band founded in 1964 as the Strawberry Hill Boys. The band started out as a bluegrass group, but eventually moved on to other styles such as folk rock and progressive rock.

They are best known for their hit &quot;Part of the Union&quot;, which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart in February 1973, as well as for &quot;Lay Down&quot;, a popular progressive rock hit from the same LP. Strawbs toured with Supertramp in their &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; tour, doing their own &quot;Hero and Heroine&quot; tour, which drew musical similarities and themes.

==History==

===Early days===
The Strawbs formed in 1964 as the Strawberry Hill Boys while the founder members were at St Mary&#x27;s Teacher Training College, Strawberry Hill, London. The name was shortened to &#x27;the Strawbs&#x27; for a June 1967 concert in which they wanted to display the band name on stage. Their long-time leader and most active songwriter is guitarist and singer Dave Cousins (guitar, dulcimer, banjo, vocals) (born David Joseph Hindson, 7 January 1945, Hounslow, Middlesex). In the early days, Strawbs played with Sandy Denny (later lead singer of Fairport Convention and Fotheringay).

Although they started in the 1960s as a bluegrass band, the band&#x27;s repertoire shifted to favour their own (mainly Cousins&#x27;) material. While in Denmark in 1967, the Strawbs (Cousins, Tony Hooper and Ron Chesterman) with Sandy Denny recorded 13 songs for a proposed first album, &quot;All Our Own Work&quot;. It was apparently not issued in Denmark and the fledgling band could not get a UK record deal. (Meanwhile, Denny left to join Fairport Convention and the album was forgotten until it was issued on Pickwick Hallmark in the UK in the mid-1970s.)

They were the first UK group signing to Herb Alpert&#x27;s A&amp;M Records and recorded their first single, &quot;Oh How She Changed&quot;, in 1968. This was produced and arranged by Gus Dudgeon and Tony Visconti, who also worked on their critically acclaimed first album, &quot;Strawbs&quot; (1969). Between the first and second A&amp;M albums, in 1969, a sampler, &quot;Strawberry Music Sampler No. 1&quot;, was recorded. According to the 2001 CD reissue, only 99 copies of the original vinyl LP were pressed.

After the folk-tinged &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, Cousins and Hooper added Rick Wakeman on keyboards, Richard Hudson on drums, and John Ford on bass. The new line-up had their London debut at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, where they recorded their third album, &quot;Just a Collection of Antiques and Curios&quot;; the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reported on the concert with the headline &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s superstar&quot; in reference to Wakeman. Wakeman stayed with them for one further album, &quot;From the Witchwood&quot;, then departed to join Yes, remarking to the press that &quot;I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll all benefit from the split because we were beginning to compromise a lot on ideas – like we&#x27;d use half of my ideas and half of theirs – and I don&#x27;t think it was helping what was eventually coming out. We ended up lacking challenge. Complacency set in, and for the last couple of months we just weren&#x27;t working.&quot;

He was replaced by Blue Weaver, who had previously been with Amen Corner and Fair Weather. This line-up produced what many feel to be the archetypal Strawbs album &quot;Grave New World&quot;, before yet another change, the departure of founding member Hooper, who was replaced by electric guitarist Dave Lambert, formerly of Fire and the King Earl Boogie Band.

===Pop success===
Lambert&#x27;s arrival in 1972 coincided with a move towards a harder rock style on the next album, &quot;Bursting at the Seams&quot;. The first single from the album with Lambert on board, &quot;Lay Down,&quot; hit the UK Singles Chart at number 12, followed by a further single from the album, &quot;Part of the Union,&quot; which went up to number 2. The album also reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart and the band undertook a 52-date UK tour to packed houses. The harder rock style was also evidenced by Cousins&#x27; solo album, &quot;Two Weeks Last Summer&quot;, recorded that summer, with guests such as Roger Glover from Deep Purple and Jon Hiseman from Colosseum.

Following a US tour, the group split, with Hudson and Ford deciding to record their own material, firstly as Hudson Ford, later as The Monks and High Society. Weaver also left the band, eventually finding a gig with the Bee Gees; he also played with Mott the Hoople.

Cousins and Lambert rebuilt the band, adding John Hawken (formerly of the Nashville Teens and Renaissance) on keyboards, Rod Coombes formerly with Stealers Wheel and Chas Cronk on bass. This line-up recorded the 1974 &quot;Hero and Heroine&quot; and &quot;Ghosts&quot;, and tended to concentrate on the North American market with relatively little touring in the UK. Strawbs still retain a fan base today in the US and Canada. &quot;Hero And Heroine&quot; went platinum in Canada, and both albums sold extremely well in the US too. A further album, &quot;Nomadness&quot;, recorded without Hawken, was less successful, and was their last for A&amp;M Records.

In a review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1974, Ken Barnes wrote:
&quot;Strawbs moved from folkier days to a lush, stately and mellotron-dominated sound, with similarities to Yes, King Crimson and the Moody Blues. They wrote more compelling songs than the former two, and possessed more lyrical/musical substance than the latter.&quot;

Signed to the Deep Purple–owned Oyster label, they recorded two more albums with two keyboardists replacing Hawken – Robert Kirby, also known for his string arrangements (notably Nick Drake) and John Mealing of jazz-rock group If. Coombes was replaced by Tony Fernandez (known for working on Rick Wakeman&#x27;s solo albums) for a further album, &quot;Deadlines&quot;, this time on the Arista label. Although recording was complete on a further album, &quot;Heartbreak Hill&quot;, featuring Andy Richards on keyboards, Cousins&#x27; decision in 1980 to leave the band to work in radio effectively signalled the band&#x27;s demise, and the album remained in the vaults for many years.

===Re-formation===
A reunion on Rick Wakeman&#x27;s TV show &quot;Gas Tank&quot; in 1983 resulted in an invitation to re-form to headline 1983&#x27;s Cambridge Folk Festival. The &quot;Grave New World&quot; line-up plus Brian Willoughby (who had replaced Lambert when he left in 1978 during the making of &quot;Heartbreak Hill&quot;, and had also begun a partnership with Dave Cousins as an acoustic duo from 1979 onwards) went on from there to perform occasionally in the UK, the US and Europe over the next few years, replacing Weaver with Chris Parren from the Hudson Ford band and Ford himself (when he relocated to the US) with bass player Rod Demick.

1993 saw the band touring in the UK for their 25th anniversary, but the next few years saw little activity. In the summer of 1998 Cousins staged a 30th-anniversary event in Chiswick Park in London, which saw several different line-ups of the band perform. The final of these – the &quot;Bursting at the Seams&quot; line-up plus Willoughby – became the ongoing version of the band, with annual tours in subsequent years.

===Acoustic Strawbs and beyond===
An injury to Cousins&#x27; wrist coinciding with a Cousins &amp; Willoughby commitment brought Dave Lambert in to work with Cousins &amp; Willoughby, which soon became Acoustic Strawbs, recording an album, &quot;Baroque &amp; Roll&quot;, in 2001. That trio began to tour on a regular basis – first in the UK, then the US and Canada, and on into Europe, the three guitars of Acoustic Strawbs effortlessly reproducing much of the majesty and depth of the &quot;big&quot; Strawbs keyboard-laden instrumentation.

Willoughby was replaced by Chas Cronk when Willoughby left in 2004 to spend more time working with his partner, Cathryn Craig. Cronk has brought bass and bass pedals, which further add to the depth of the Acoustic Strawbs sound. 2004 also saw the return of the &quot;Hero And Heroine&quot; line-up of the electric band, touring in tandem with the acoustic line-up, and recording their first new album for 25 years, &quot;Deja Fou&quot;, on the Strawbs&#x27; own label, Witchwood Records.

===Spin-off bands===
In 1973, Hudson and Ford quit to form Hudson Ford, with the line-up of Chris Parren (keyboards), Mickey Keen (guitar and sound engineer), and Ken Laws (drums). They produced four albums, three for A&amp;M (&quot;Nickelodeon&quot;, &quot;Free Spirit&quot;, &quot;Worlds Collide&quot;) and a fourth for CBS (&quot;Daylight&quot;). They also had hit singles with &quot;Pick Up the Pieces&quot; and &quot;Burn Baby Burn&quot;, and toured extensively in the UK, the US and Canada.

Switching genres in the late &#x27;70s, Hudson, Ford and Terry Cassidy combined with Clive Pearce on drums (Hudson was then playing guitar, having switched from drums) to produce the punk-flavoured 1979 album, &quot;Bad Habits&quot;, as the Monks (not to be confused with the 1960s garage/beat group of the same name). The album spawned a number 19 hit in the UK singles chart, &quot;Nice Legs, Shame About the Face&quot;, which featured a mildly risquė cover. They dabbled with 1930s-style music in 1980 as High Society before returning to the pseudo-punk format of the Monks for a follow-up album released in Canada only, &quot;Suspended Animation&quot;, with the addition of Brian Willoughby on guitar and Chris Parren on keyboards.

While the album failed to produce further UK chart success, the band were huge in Canada particularly, playing stadium gigs; &quot;Suspended Animation&quot; went platinum in Canada too. The CD re-release of &quot;Suspended Animation&quot; includes six bonus tracks, recorded for a third album but never before released, by Hudson, Ford and Cassidy — Huw Gower guests on one track on lead guitar.

===Recently===

Since 2007, the Strawbs have been recording and touring in two formats: the acoustic format with Cousins, Lambert and Cronk; and the entirely original &quot;Hero and Heroine/Ghosts&quot; line-up of the electric band from 1974: Cousins, Lambert, Cronk, Coombes and Hawken. The line-up undertook two tours in 2006.

For that particular recording, and other concerts on the same tour, vocalist and bass player John Ford (member of an earlier Strawbs line-up) flew over from New York to perform with members of the &quot;Hero and Heroine&quot; line-up. The &quot;Hero and Heroine&quot; line-up toured again in 2007 in the UK, including gigs at the Robin 2 (Bilston), The Stables (Wavendon), and several locations in Southern and Southwestern England. This line-up also toured the UK and US in May–June 2008. Following the US tour, John Hawken announced his intention to leave the group. The remaining four members (the &quot;Nomadness&quot; line-up) continued as the core of the electric band. In January 2009, it was announced that Oliver Wakeman would be playing keyboards with the band on tours of Canada, the UK and Italy.

In 2006, the Strawbs released a four-disc boxed set called &quot;A Taste of Strawbs&quot;. The &quot;Hero and Heroine&quot;/&quot;Ghosts&quot; line-up recorded a new studio album, &quot;The Broken Hearted Bride&quot;, released in September 2008.

Dave Cousins recorded a new solo album, &quot;The Boy in the Sailor Suit&quot;, with The Blue Angel Orchestra. In 2008, he released his third solo album, &quot;Secret Paths&quot;, with steel guitarist Melvin Duffy. Along with the album, he toured the US in spring 2008 (joined by Ian Cutler for the early part of the tour). A concert album from this tour, entitled &quot;Duochrome&quot;, was released in September 2008.

Lambert Cronk also released an album in April 2007 entitled &quot;Touch the Earth&quot;, on which former Strawbs drummer Tony Fernandez and former Strawbs keyboard player Andy Richards both play. The Strawbs&#x27; website announced that neither Rod Coombes nor Oliver Wakeman were available for the October/November 2010 tours of Canada and the UK. (Coombes has educational commitments, and Wakeman was committed to recording a new Yes album.) For these tours, Tony Fernandez (who played with Strawbs on &quot;Deadlines&quot; and &quot;Heartbreak Hill&quot;) was employed on drums, and John Young on keyboards.

The November 2012 tour featured a line-up of Cousins, Lambert, Cronk, Adam Wakeman and Adam Falkner. In February 2014 the band gigged with a line-up of Cousins, Lambert, Cronk, Wakeman and Fernandez. Their album &quot;Prognostic&quot; was issued in October 2014.

In 2017, the band released &quot;The Ferryman&#x27;s Curse&quot; with a line-up of Cousins, Lambert, Cronk, Fernandez and Dave Bainbridge.

The band toured the US in 2019 as part of their 50th-anniversary celebration. The tour included a three-day event in Lakewood, New Jersey, featuring former members along with special guests/friends appearing (Annie Haslam, Larry Fast, Tony Visconti, Wesley Stace, and others).

The band released &quot;Settlement&quot; on 26 February 2021.

On 14 July 2023, the Strawbs released a new album, &quot;The Magic Of It All&quot;, recorded in Cape Town in 2022. It features David Cousins, Blue Weaver and John Ford.

South African documentary filmmaker Niel van Deventer approached singer David Cousins with the idea of producing a documentary about the Strawbs and the group&#x27;s influence around the world. Niel wanted to film while new songs were being recorded at a studio in Cape Town. David Cousins came with a bunch of his best songs, keyboardist and producer Blue Weaver flew to Cape Town to produce the sessions and co-write some of the songs, while John Ford joined to collaborate on the songs from a studio in New York.

&quot;The Magic Of It All&quot; album was released simultaneously on vinyl, CD and download via Cherry Red on 14 July. The documentary &quot;The Magic Of It All&quot; will be released later.

On 11 August 2023, the Strawbs gave their final live show and farewell gig at Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention 2023.

<text>Thury-Harcourt () is a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Thury-Harcourt-le-Hom. The town is south of Caen, in the Orne valley. It is part of Norman Switzerland, which attracts visitors for various sports and outdoor activities with its hilly terrain.

==History==
The original name is Thury, but the Marquis of Thury received a benefice from Henry d&#x27;Harcourt under the name of the Duke of Harcourt in 1709, requiring a change of name. The town was occupied by the forces of Nazi Germany in June 1940 after France&#x27;s surrender ended the Battle of France. For four years the village lived under Nazi occupation as part of the German military administration in occupied France during World War II. Thury-Harcourt was liberated by British soldiers who were part of the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division. The 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division fought their way into and through Thury-Harcourt in August 1944.

==Administration==

At the local elections of March 2014, the mayor Paul Chandelier was re-elected. The municipal council consists of 19 members, including the mayor and 5 deputy mayors.

==Population==
==Sights==
* The park and gardens of the Château of the Dukes of Harcourt were constructed in 1635 by Odet d&#x27;Harcourt and expanded upon in 1714 and 1723.

In the battles of the Second World War, after the Normandy landings the town was bombed for the first time on 30 June 1944; the château escaped damage. It was during fierce fighting against the British 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division on 13–4 August 1944 that the German forces retreated from the town and set fire to the chateau, which had suffered little damage up to that point. The fire destroyed many public archives, a library of nearly 15,000 volumes, and hundreds of family records.
* Roman Catholic church of Saint Sauveur, 12th century, in the middle of the town. It was bombed in the summer of 1944, and only the nave remained. It has now been restored to what it was before the war.
 railway station was destroyed by air strikes in 1944 and reconstructed in the 1950s. The passenger line opened in 1873 and was closed in 1971. Freight service stopped in 1983.
A tourist train from Louvigny (close to Caen) to Clécy operated from 1991 to 1994.

*The village of Saint-Benin merged with Thury-Harcourt in 1858. Its Roman Catholic church is from the 16th century. The gothic choir is in good condition, but the nave was lost in a fire in the 19th century. The church is constructed from limestone and mortar. It has a gable roof, crowned with a cross. The belltower is supported by four 13th century buttresses, decorated with gargoyles bearing human faces.

==Notable people==

* Pierre Gringore, the poet laureate of Louis XII, was born here.
* In 1863 Paul Héroult, invented the extraction of aluminium by electrometallurgy. He also invented the electric oven in 1900.
* Jean Le Sueur (1598–1668), priest of the parish, accompanied many local families in their migration to Canada. He became the first secular priest in New France (now Quebec).
* Jean Baptiste Legardeur de Repentigny, born at Thury-Harcourt about 1632, first master of Québec.
* Raoul Tesson, (1150–1213) Vicomte de Saint Sauveur, Seigneur de Thury et de la Roche Tesson, Sénéchal de Normandie. 
* Maurice Delaunay (1901–1995), politician, leader of Calvados 1936-1940.

==Events==
In the sixteenth century many families emigrated to Canada, taking with them the curate and abbot of the parish, (Lesueur). He founded the parish Saint-Sauveur, Quebec.
Pierre Legardeur got general control of Nouvelle-France and gave his name to the towns of Le Gardeur and Repentigny in Quebec.

===Sporting events===
The commune has hosted two major Canoe polo events, the 2007, European championship and 2014 ICF World Championships.

<doc id="1022417" wikidata="Q10286944" url="?curid=1022417" title="Sudbury school">
<text>A Sudbury school is a type of school, usually for the K-12 age range, where students have complete responsibility for their own education, and the school is run by a direct democracy in which students and staff are equal citizens. Students use their time however they wish, and learn as a by-product of ordinary experience rather than through coursework. There is no predetermined educational syllabus, prescriptive curriculum or standardized instruction.

This is a form of democratic education and fulfills the criteria of a Democratic School.

== Definition ==
Daniel Greenberg, one of the founders of the original Sudbury Model school, writes that the two things that distinguish a Sudbury Model school are that everyone is treated equally (adults and children together) and that there is no authority other than that granted by the consent of the governed.

While each Sudbury Model school operates independently and determines their own policies and procedures, they share a common culture. 

Sudbury Valley Schools give full responsibility for the learning process to the student. This means that lessons are usually requested by students from teachers. In addition, the school is a direct democracy in which students and teachers participate equally in the school. Parents are explicitly excluded from most areas of school organization.

== Etymology and Spread ==
The name &quot;Sudbury&quot; originates from the Sudbury Valley School, founded in 1968 in Framingham, Massachusetts, near Sudbury, Massachusetts. Though there is no formal or regulated definition of a Sudbury Model school, there are now more than 60 schools that identify themselves with Sudbury around the world. Some, though not all, include &quot;Sudbury&quot; in their name. These schools operate as independent entities and are not formally associated in any way.

==Underlying beliefs==

Sudbury schools are based on:

# The educational belief that children are extremely good at (and therefore do not need to be taught) the main behaviors they will need as adults, such as creativity, imagination, alertness, curiosity, thoughtfulness, responsibility, and judgement. What children lack is experience, which can be gained if adults guide students in open ways.
# The sociopolitical belief that having full democratic rights in childhood is the best way to become an adult who is comfortable functioning within a democracy.

&quot;The fundamental premises of the school are simple: that all people are curious by nature; that the most efficient, long-lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; that age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group; and that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility.&quot;

==School democracy==
All aspects of governing a Sudbury school are determined by the weekly school meeting, modeled after the traditional New England town meeting. School Meeting passes, amends and repeals school rules, manages the school&#x27;s budget, and decides on hiring and firing of staff. Each individual present—including students and staff—has an equal vote, and most decisions are made by simple majority.

School rules are normally compiled in a law book, updated repeatedly over time, which forms the school&#x27;s code of law. Usually, there is a set procedure to handle complaints, and most of the schools follow guidelines that respect the idea of due process of law. There are usually rules requiring an investigation, a hearing, a trial, a sentence, and allowing for an appeal, generally following the philosophy that students face the consequences of their own behavior.

==Learning==
The Sudbury pedagogical philosophy may be summarized as the following:
Learning is a natural by-product of all human activity. Learning is self-initiated and self-motivated.

The educational model states that there are many ways to learn and that learning is a process someone does, not a process that is done to him or her; According to the model the presence and guidance of a teacher is not necessary.

The free exchange of ideas and free conversation and interplay between people provides broad exposure to areas that may prove relevant and interesting to students. Students are of all mixed ages. The older students learn from younger students and vice versa. The presence of older students provides role models, both positive and negative, for younger students. The pervasiveness of play has led to a recurring observation by first-time visitors to a Sudbury school that the students appear to be in perpetual &quot;recess&quot;.

Implicitly and explicitly, students are given responsibility for their own education: The only person designing what a student will learn is the student. Exceptions are when a student asks for a particular class or arranges an apprenticeship. Sudbury schools do not compare or rank students—the school requires no tests, evaluations, or transcripts.

Reading is treated the same as any other subject: Students learn to read when they choose, or simply by going about their lives.

&quot;Only a few kids seek any help at all when they decide to learn. Each child seems to have their own method. Some learn from being read to, memorizing the stories and then ultimately reading them. Some learn from cereal boxes, others from game instructions, others from street signs. Some teach themselves letter sounds, others syllables, others whole words. To be honest, we rarely know how they do it, and they rarely tell us.&quot;

Sudbury Valley School claims that all of their students have learned to read. While students learn to read at a wide variety of ages, there appears to be no drawback to learning to read later: No one who meets their older students could guess the age at which they first learned to read.

==Comparison with related models==

The model differs in some ways from other types of democratic schools and free schools, but there are many similarities:
* De-emphasis of classes: There is no curriculum or set of required courses. Instead learner interest guides things, with students studying what they want to study. There are generally no classrooms, just rooms where people choose to congregate.
* Age mixing: students are not separated into age-groups of any kind and are allowed to mix freely, interacting with those younger and older than themselves; free age-mixing is emphasized as a powerful tool for learning and development in all ages.
* Autonomous democracy: parents have limited involvement or no involvement in the school administration; Sudbury schools are run by a democratic school meeting where the students and staff participate exclusively and equally. Such meetings are also the sole authority on hiring and firing of staff, unlike most other schools.

<doc id="1022429" wikidata="Q214874" url="?curid=1022429" title="Jhelum River">
<text>The Jhelum River is a major river in South Asia, flowing through India and Pakistan, and is the westernmost of the five major rivers of the Punjab region. It originates at Verinag and flows through the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir, into Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir, then the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is a tributary of the Chenab River and has a total length of about .

==Etymology==
A Pakistani author, Anjum Sultan Shahbaz, recorded some stories of the name Jhelum in his book &quot;Tareekh-e-Jhelum&quot;:

The Sanskrit name for the river is &quot;Vitástā&quot;, derived from an apocryphal legend regarding the origin of the river in the Nilamata Purana. The name survives in the Kashmiri name for this river, &quot;Vyath&quot; and in Punjabi (and more commonly in Saraiki) as &quot;Vehat&quot;. It was called the Hydaspes by the armies of Alexander the Great.

==History==

The river Jhelum was originally recognized by the name Vitasta. The river was called &quot;Hydaspes&quot; () by the ancient Greeks.

Alexander III of Macedon and his army crossed the Jhelum in BCE 326 at the Battle of the Hydaspes River, where he defeated an Indian king, Porus. According to Arrian (&quot;Anabasis&quot;, 29), he built a city &quot;on the spot whence he started to cross the river Hydaspes&quot;, which he named &quot;Bukephala&quot; (or &quot;Bucephala&quot;) to honour his famous horse Bucephalus, buried in present-day Jalalpur Sharif. It is thought that ancient Bukephala was near the site of modern Jhelum. According to Gujrat district historian Mansoor Behzad Butt, Bukephalus was buried in Jalalpur Sharif, but the people of Mandi Bahauddin, a district close to Jehlum, believed that their tehsil Phalia was named after Alexander&#x27;s dead horse, saying that the name &quot;Phalia&quot; was a distortion of &quot;Bucephala&quot;.

The waters of the Jhelum are allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty. India is working on a hydropower project on a tributary of Jhelum river to establish first-use rights on the river water over Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty.

==Legends==
According to Hindu puranas, the goddess Parvati was requested by the sage Kashyapa to come to Kashmir to purify the land from the evil practices and impurities of the pishachas living there. Parvati assumed the form of a river in the netherworld. Her consort Shiva struck with his spear near the abode of Nila, (Verinag spring). With this stroke of the spear, Parvati emerged from the netherworld. He excavated a ditch measuring one &quot;vitasti&quot; using the spear, through which the river, originating from the netherworld, came out, and so he gave her the name &quot;Vitástā&quot;.

The ancient Greeks also regarded the river as a god, as they did most mountains and streams. The poet Nonnus in the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; calls the &quot;Hydaspes&quot; a titan-descended god, the son of the sea-god Thaumas and the cloud-goddess Elektra, the brother of Iris, goddess of the rainbow, and half-brother to the harpies, the snatching winds. Since the river is in a foreign country, it is not clear whether they named the river after the god, or whether the god &quot;Hydaspes&quot; was named after the river.

==Course==
The river Jhelum rises from Verinag spring at the foot of the Pir Panjal in the southeastern Kashmir Valley administered by India. It is joined by its tributaries 
* Lidder River near village Mirgund at Khanabal 
* Veshaw River at Sangam in Anantnag 
* Sind River at Shadipora
* Pohru River at Doabgah in Sopore, Jammu and Kashmir. 
It flows through Srinagar and Wular Lake before entering Pakistan-administered Kashmir through a deep narrow gorge. The Kishanganga River/Neelum River, the largest tributary of the Jhelum, joins it at Domel, Muzaffarabad, as does the next largest, the Kunhar River of Kaghan Valley. It is then joined by the Poonch River, and flows into the Mangla Dam reservoir in the Mirpur District. The Jhelum enters Pakistani Punjab in the Jhelum District. From there, it flows through the plains of Pakistan&#x27;s Punjab, forming the boundary between the Jech and Sindh Sagar Doabs. It ends in a confluence with the Chenab River at Trimmu in the Jhang District. The Chenab merges with the Sutlej to form the Panjnad River, which joins the Indus River at Mithankot.

Most of the villages and important cities of Kashmir valley are situated on the banks of Jhelum.

==Lakes==
==Dams, barrages and bridges==
The river has rich power generation potential in India. Water control structures are being built as a result of the Indus Basin Project, including the following:
* Mangla Dam, completed in 1967, is one of the largest earth-fill dams in the world, with a storage capacity of 
* Karot Hydropower Project is an under-construction concrete-core rockfill gravity large dam in Pakistan, with a planned installed capacity of 720 MW.
* Rasul Barrage, constructed in 1967, has a maximum flow of 850,000 ft³/s (24,000 m³/s).
* Trimmu Barrage, constructed in 1939 some 20 km from Jhang Sadar at the confluence with the Chenab, has maximum discharge capacity of 645,000 ft³/s (18,000 m³/s).
* Victoria Bridge, Haranpur, constructed in 1973, approximate 5 km from Malakwal near Chak Nizam village. Its length is 1 km, mainly used by Pakistan Railways, but there is a passage for light vehicles, motorcycles, cycles and pedestrians on one side.
* Uri Dam with 480 MW Hydroelectric station is located in Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir.
* Uri Dam II with 240 MW Hydroelectric station is also located in Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir.
* Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plant with 330 MW Hydroelectric station is located in Bandipora district of Jammu and Kashmir.

==Canals==
* Canals in and around the city of Srinagar.
* The Upper Jhelum Canal runs from Mangla Dam to the Chenab.
* The Rasul-Qadirabad Link Canal. 
* The Chashma-Jhelum Link Canal runs from the Chashma Barrage on the Indus River to the Jhelum river downstream of Rasul Barrage. This is from Mari Shah Sakhira town.

<text>Alfaião is a Portuguese civil parish in the municipality of Bragança. The population in 2011 was 173, in an area of 17.58 km².

==History==
Located in the central part of the municipality of Bragança, it was located a dozen of kilometres southeast of the Roman castro of &quot;Brigantina&quot;. The settlement had its beginnings in a local castro that existed during the Iron Age. In 1758, metallic objects were discovered in the remnants of a building, referred to as the &quot;castle&quot; by the locals. A later historian suggested that the castle was of Roman origin, owing to the discovery of old military implements from that period. The same author also alluded to a second fortification &quot;in top of the mountain...there was an old ancient Castle, and it can still be seen the bowls used there...&quot; Similar references were echoed by the Abbot of Baçal (and other investors), who confirmed the existence of two different settlements in Alfaião: &quot;Castelo das Freiras&quot; and &quot;Alto da Veiga&quot; (or also &quot;Vale de Castro&quot;.

Few references to Alfaião&#x27;s founding exist, and the parish was only mentioned in documents during the middle of the 13th century. One of the records date back to the &quot;Inquirições&quot; (administrative inventory) of 1258 ordered by Afonso III include a reference to a &quot;parrochia Sancti Martini de Alfayãa&quot;, in the lands near Bragança. Further references are sketchy, indicating that during the reign of King Sancho I the parishioners of Alfaião developed their community in parallel with the growth and establishment of Bragança. After the creation of the bishopric of Miranda do Douro, the local Church of São Martinho fell within the authority of that church, until the diocese was extinguished and the clergy transferred to the Sé in Bragnaça. At the time it had 70 inhabitants.

The parish had its own local magistrate, subordinate to the superior judges and government of the city of Bragança by 1775. The local community had no local postal authority, and a visitor from the University in Coimbra referred to a community of less than 30 homes.

==Geography==
The topography in this region is planar, with hilltops oscillating between 500 and 750 metres high. The rapids of the Sabor River cut across the southern portion of the parish.

Owing to its distance from Bragança, its demographic level has declined since the middle of the 20th century, when at the time its population hovered around 331 inhabitants.

It is connected primarily across the EN217 (Bragança-Izeda-Mogadouro corridor) and rural road (by way of São Pedro de Sarracenos) to the municipal seat.

==Architecture==
* Church of São Martinho (), located in the middle of the main village, the parochial church includes two minor altars (with images of &quot;Nossa Senhora do Rosário&quot; and &quot;Nosso Senhor Crucificado&quot;) and a main altar (with an image of its patron saint São Martinho); the ecclesiastical parish of Alfaião pertained to the Monastery of Castro de Avelãs since 1490, the archbishop of Braga assigning the abbot at the time; between 1501 and 1514, its clergy were served from the monastery; the construction of the current church occurred in the 17th century; the first baptisms were registered in 1627; the first marriage was documented in 1628; in 1706, its second parish priest Father Carvalho da Costa, who was assigned by a canon at the Sé Church in Miranda, earned 150$000 réis, the parish included 66 neighbours; the first death was recorded in 1724; by 21 April 1758, the parish which was located between two mounts and pertained to the bishop of Miranda do Douro, comarca and seat of Bragança, and was subject to the House of Braganza. The church was considered &quot;indecent and incapable&quot; by a visiting vicar from the University, and reconstruction/remodelling works were begun in 1775, in order to enlarge the main chapel, create a new sacristy and parochial residences (which were in ruins and located half a league from the church). The parish holdings produced 15 alqueires of corn annually, but the University covered the tithes, as well as providing a stipend of 8$000 réis, candlewax, wine, hosts, repairs to the main chapel, sacristy and residences of the pastor (in addition to 16 alqueires of bread and $180 réis that covered the archdeacon). In 1798 a new image of Saint Martin was commissioned by a local benefactor.
* Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Veiga (), the first reference to this chapel, came from abbot João de Loureiro Medeiros (21 Abril 1758), who mentioned that it was dedicated to &quot;Nossa Senhora da Encarnação&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of the Incarnation&quot;), situated in this place called Veiga; the local religious brotherhood celebrated a festival on 25 March, with a sermon and procession; on 25 April by the locals; and it was believed that the patron saint granted miracles to the faithful, resulting in an annual pilgrimage to the small chapel.
* Chapel of São Sebastião (), a chapel administered by the clergy at the Sé of Miranda do Douro; the abbot João de Loureiro Medeiros identified chapel to Saint Sebastian, which existed outside of Alfaião, on the road leading to Bragança;

<doc id="1022434" wikidata="Q7132668" url="?curid=1022434" title="Paper soccer">
<text>Paper soccer (or paper hockey) is an abstract strategy game played on a square grid representing a soccer or hockey field. Two players take turns extending a line representing the position of a ball until it reaches one of the grid&#x27;s two-goal spaces. A traditional paper-and-pencil game, it is commonly played in schools and can be found in some magazines. Many computer implementations of the game also exist. Despite the game&#x27;s simple rules, paper soccer has various expanded strategies and tactics.

== General rules ==
The game&#x27;s pitch is drawn as a rectangle on a grid, with small extended rectangles in the center of each of the two shortest sides to represent the two goalposts. The grid can be of any size, although both sides should be an even number of squares to allow a center point for kickoff. The goal areas are typically 2 × 1 squares in size.

A &quot;ball&quot; is marked as a dot in the center of the pitch. Players alternately move the ball to a new point by drawing a line from its current position to a new one. Each move must be to a point orthogonally or diagonally adjacent. The ball cannot be moved beyond the boundary of the pitch, nor along a line that has already been drawn (including the boundary of the pitch).

If the ball is moved to a point that already has one or more lines connected to it, including the perimeter of the pitch, the ball &quot;bounces&quot; and the player immediately takes another turn. The player&#x27;s move ends only when the ball reaches a point with no existing lines.

The winner is the player who places the ball in their opponent&#x27;s goal. A player also wins if their opponent scores an own goal. If the ball reaches a point from which it cannot be moved (such as a corner of the pitch) this is regarded as a draw, or a loss for the player unable to move, depending on the rules being played. In some versions of the game, their own goals and moves that make it impossible to move are illegal.

=== Variants and modifications ===
The players can regulate the pitch&#x27;s shape in various ways by altering the pitch&#x27;s dimensions or the placement of the gates. In some variants, one or more special lines may be added to the pitch. This modification is found in computer applications, and expanded variants of this modification are used by PDE Football.

In some variants, gameplay can be continued from the central pitch&#x27;s point after a goal is scored or after a play is blocked. The player who did not score moves first from the central point. The game is finished when a move from the central point is not possible, and the player who scored the most goals wins.

Another variant allows a player to make a &quot;bounce&quot; during any turn if the line of that bounce would cross an existing diagonal line.

Another variant is Texas Soccer which allows no &quot;X&quot; marks to be made as the ball can no longer cross through a diagonal line.

== Strategy ==

Since the ball&#x27;s movement cannot overlap previously drawn lines, a player can block their opponent&#x27;s potential moves by filling strategic points on the board and limiting the mobility of their opponent. Another strategy is based on the use of &quot;bounces&quot; for streamlining mobility, which can greatly aid in scoring goals or blocking access to the player&#x27;s own goal area. In versions of the game where a player who cannot move loses, a player can focus on moving the ball to a position where their opponent cannot move it further.

In some early computerized versions of this game, the AI player tends to choose the shortest path to the player&#x27;s goal, ignoring bounces and other strategies. That strategy is not universal. Computer version of Paper Soccer include graphs and pathfinding (just as other games like Quoridor). Computer programs still do not play this game at competitive/top level.

== Game notation ==

Each move in the game may be recorded as a string of one or more digits from 0 to 7, each digit representing the direction of a move (with 0 corresponding to &#x27;north&#x27;, 1 to &#x27;north-east&#x27;, 2 to &#x27;east&#x27; and so on) across a single grid. Multiple digits are used to record bounce moves. This notation has been used in a PlayOK.com service.

== Similar games ==
There are two similar games that imitate paper soccer. Their mechanisms also depend on drawing lines to describe a ball&#x27;s movement on a field.

=== Paper soccer (Russian variant) ===

This paper-and-pencil game also involves drawing lines to adjacent points on a grid and is distinguished by a larger play area and players extending the line to three points each turn. The line can change direction at each point but must not touch any existing line (there are no bounce moves). If a player becomes trapped and unable to draw this line, then their turn is forfeited and the opponent gets a &quot;penalty kick&quot;. This special move is a straight line in any of the eight compass directions, extending six points, and is the only occasion that other lines may be crossed. If the penalty lands on an already-occupied point or there are less than three unoccupied points available to move, an additional penalty kick is earned. After six such penalties, if there are insufficient valid moves then the other player starts with a penalty kick. Some versions with very large grids have players extend the line through four points per turn and penalty kicks across 13 points.

The strategy involves blocking an opponent&#x27;s potential moves, outmaneuvering the opponent at the edges of the field, and setting traps for penalty kicks in range of the opponent&#x27;s goal. If a trap is not executed successfully, the opponent may be able to reverse it in an extreme move.

The game was popular in many parts of the former Soviet Union. Several Russian magazines describe the game and there are a number of computer versions as well.

=== &quot;xrSoccer&quot; ===
Published in 2005, &quot;xrSoccer&quot; is a computer game by eXtreme Results International Inc. It may be adapted to paper-and-pencil form for two players. It has common features with the previously described versions of paper soccer but gameplay generally differs.

The pitch is a 14 × 20 grid (13 × 19 points) with goal gates on the shorter sides. Starting from the center point, the line is extended to three points per turn. The line can touch occupied points and cross existing lines (there are no bounce moves) but cannot move along an existing line. If a player has no place to extend the line, the computer repositions the ball on the nearest unblocked point. This can be favourable when executed properly, as the ball is usually moved depending on the last direction of the line before it became blocked, and can be used to maneuver closer to the opponent&#x27;s goal. After scoring a goal, the ball is reset to the center point and the game continues until all possible goals are scored.

<text>Aveleda is a former &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) in the municipality of Bragança, Portugal. In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Aveleda e Rio de Onor. The population in 2011 was 196, in an area of 62.20 km2. It is situated close to the northern border with Spain.

==History==
The parish of Aveleda derives its name from the village, whose toponymy has a number of significances. For one, there is the Roman interpretation, derived from the Roman &quot;Avé Leda&quot;, which means &quot;beautiful place&quot;, while others assume that the name was derived from &quot;Veleda&quot;, a venerated Visigothic or Suebic priest of the 4th century. Another interpretation suggests that the name was derived from &quot;ave feliz&quot;.

What is certain, is that this name only appeared during the 1250 &quot;Inquirições&quot; of Afonso III. This is because the area around Aveleda was under the protection of Spanish monasteries of Moreirola and San Martin de Castanheda. It was there that the celebrated &quot;Abbott of Baçal&quot; was parish priest (between 1896 and 1910), always travelling by foot and complying a dossier of his thoughts in Memórias Arqueológico: Históricas do Distrito de Bragança, a twelve-tome work detailing the municipal history. In this case, he referred specifically to the village of Varge (on the southern perimeter of Aveleda), which was derived from &quot;varzena&quot; or &quot;varcena&quot;, a medieval term to designate artificial or natural low wetlands. The wells in this area are also referred to by the local peoples as &quot;varja&quot; or &quot;varjas&quot;, literally &quot;fish traps&quot;.

The Matriz Church, on a slight elevation, dates back to the 18th century.

The bridge that crosses the Pepim River in Aveleda, constructed on stone, was completed in 1952.

==Geography==
Aveleda is located along the Portuguese-Spanish border within the &quot;Parque Natural de Montesinho&quot; (&quot;Montesinho Natural Park&quot;), three kilometres northeast of the municipal seat of Bragança.

It is characterized by hills and river-valleys, along a plateau with an average of 500 metres altitude. It is crossed by two water courses that flow from north to south: the &quot;Ribeira das Igrejas&quot;, which crosses the village of Varge, and the &quot;Ribeira de Pepim&quot;, which intersects the village of Aveleda. Both ravines spring from the &quot;Serra de Pedralba&quot;, crossing from Spain, and flow as tributaries of the Sabor River.

==Architecture==
There are several vestiges of historical architecture and rural constructions in this parish, that include: the two main historical springs/wells (&quot;Fonte da Pinela&quot; and &quot;Fonte d&#x27;Aldeia&quot;), which were subterranean channels of potable water; watermills and ancient blacksmith&#x27;s forge. The following were classified by IGESPAR as national monuments or architecturally significant heritage:

===Civic===
* Fountain of Pinela ()

===Religious===
* Church of São Cipriano (), built in the 17th century, the parochial church of Aveleda was directed by the abbey Meixedo, before falling under the administration of Miranda;
* Church of São Miguel (), a relatively small parish, the church of Varge had little more than 40 parishioners at the time of its institution, during the 17th century;
* Chapel of São Sebastião (), constructed during the 18th century, the chapel has been a site for pilgrims, first for São Julião, but later Santo Padre (celebrated on 20 January), during the winter seasons. A register of azulejo is located above the main portal.

<doc id="1022444" wikidata="Q797612" url="?curid=1022444" title="Babe (Bragança)">
<text>Babe is a Portuguese civil parish in the municipality of Bragança. The population in 2011 was 238, in an area of 25.62 km2.

==History==
A. Pereira Lopo, writing in 1898, alludes to the &quot;greatness&quot; of the Castro of Babe, which had been an important station during the Roman era. This includes many monuments located in its shadow, including altar stone dedicated to Jupiter (with the inscription &quot;I.O.M.&quot;) and funerary stone (&quot;A1 e EQVITIAL (ae) II&quot;) with vestiges of three figures in low relief.

It was situated on the Roman road from Braga to Castile. Remains of the Roman settlement can be found in funerary crypts and Bronze Age implements. Popular tradition suggests that a road was built for Elizabeth of Portugal to pass through or beside the village.

There is no consensus about the origin of the name &quot;Babe&quot;. Some suggest , which means &quot;[small] door&quot; (). Others suggest that the name originated from the Roman era.

The modern parish of Babe, dates to the medieval period, when it was referred to as &quot;Sancti Petride Babi&quot;, which it would continue to remain until the 13th-century &quot;Inquirições&quot; of King Afonso III. The documents associated with the King&#x27;s inventory are the first records of a parochial institution (1258), although it is likely that the local church had existed prior to these records. The church dedicated to &quot;São Pedro&quot; (), which, already on the decline, was substituted by the new &quot;Church of Santa Maria de Laviados&quot;, later to the invocation of &quot;Nossa Senhora da Conceição&quot;.

The Treaty of Babe, between John I of Portugal and John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster, was signed here on 26 March 1387.

Babe&#x27;s evolution has been affected by the population emigration and aging of the community.

==Geography==
Situated 10.5 kilometres from the municipal seat of Bragança, Babe occupies an area accessible by the EN218, or along the EN308 from Gimonde. It is located on the southern portion of the Montesinho Natural Park (, a mountainous plateau along the border between Spain and northern Portugal. At an average altitude of 750 metres, it is crossed by the Igrejas River and many of its tributaries.

The parish is bordered by Gimonde, Palácios, Caravela, São Julião and Laviados.

==Architecture==

===Civic===
* Fountains of Babe ().

===Religious===
* Church of São Pedro (). From 1258, most of the town belonged to the Hospitaller Order, under the Monastery of Castro de Avelãs since 1258. Only in the 17th century was a church built, supported in subsequent years by patronage from hereditary nobles, including the Dukes of Braganza. The plain single-nave church, in the Manueline style had two side altars, one dedicated to &quot;Nossa Senhora do Rosário&quot;, the other to the &quot;Souls of Purgatory&quot; (supported by the &quot;Confraternity of Souls&quot; ();
* Chapel of São Sebastião (). The first reference to this chapel is by the rector José Alvares da Silva on 17 April 1758.
* Chapel of São José (), dating back to 1697 (from an inscription on the façade).

The case centered on the constitutionality of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, which prohibited the killing, capturing, and selling of certain migratory birds pursuant to a treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom. The state of Missouri challenged the enforcement of the Act within its jurisdiction, arguing that the regulation of game was not expressly delegated to the federal government by the United States Constitution and therefore was reserved for the states under the Tenth Amendment; accordingly, the United States government had no constitutional right to enter into a treaty concerning game regulation.

In a 7–2 decision, the Court upheld the Act as constitutional, since it was enacted pursuant to the federal government&#x27;s express power to make treaties and to enact laws pursuant to treaties, which the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution elevates above state law. The Court also reasoned that protecting wildlife was in the national interest and could only be accomplished through federal action.

&quot;Missouri&quot; is also notable for Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes&#x27;s articulation of the legal theory of a &quot;living constitution&quot;, which purports that the Constitution changes over time and adapts to new circumstances without formal amendments.

==Facts==
Congress had previously passed laws regulating the hunting of migratory waterfowl on the basis that such birds naturally migrated across state and international borders freely, and hence the regulation of the harvest of such birds could not realistically be considered to be province solely of individual states or groups of states. However, several states objected to this theory, and twice successfully sued to have such laws declared unconstitutional, on the premise that the U.S. Constitution gave Congress no enumerated power to regulate migratory bird hunting, thereby leaving the matter to states pursuant to the Tenth Amendment.

Disgruntled with these rulings, Congress then empowered the State Department to negotiate with the United Kingdom—which at the time still largely handled the foreign relations of Canada—a treaty pertaining to this issue. The treaty was subsequently ratified and came into force, requiring the federal government to enact laws regulating the capturing, killing, or selling of protected migratory birds, an obligation that it fulfilled in the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

The state of Missouri requested that U.S. Game Warden Ray Holland be enjoined from implementing the Act, arguing that it was &quot;an unconstitutional interference with the rights reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment, and [...] the acts of the defendant [...] invade the sovereign right of the State and contravene its will manifested in statutes.&quot; Additionally, Missouri claimed that states had an &quot;absolute&quot; right to regulate game within their borders as recognized by &quot;ancient law, feudal law, and the common law in England&quot; as an &quot;attribute of government and a necessary incident of sovereignty.&quot; The state also warned that permitting the federal government to regulate birds could set a dangerous precedent for government to broaden its power over other domains for which it had no enumerated constitutional power.

==Judgment==
In an opinion authored by Justice Holmes, the Supreme Court dismissed Missouri&#x27;s demand for an injunction against the federal government, holding that protection of a state&#x27;s quasi-sovereign right to regulate game is insufficient jurisdictional basis to enjoin enforcement of the laws at issue.

The Supreme Court ruled the Migratory Bird Treaty Act constitutional, relying primarily on article VI, clause 2, sometimes known as the &quot;Supremacy Clause&quot;, which establishes that treaties are the &quot;supreme law of the land&quot; and supersede state law accordingly. The ruling implied that treaty provisions were not subject to questioning by the states under the process of judicial review.

In the course of his judgment, Justice Holmes remarked on the nature of the Constitution as an &quot;organism&quot; that must be interpreted in contemporaneous terms:

With regard to that we may add that when we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It was enough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their successors much sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. The case before us must be considered in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago. The treaty in question does not contravene any prohibitory words to be found in the Constitution. The only question is whether it is forbidden by some invisible radiation from the general terms of the Tenth Amendment. We must consider what this country has become in deciding what that amendment has reserved.

Justice Willis Van Devanter and Justice Mahlon Pitney dissented without issuing an opinion.

==Reception==
Many legal analysts have argued that the decision implies that Congress and the President can essentially amend the Constitution by means of treaties with other countries. These concerns came to a head in the 1950s with the Bricker Amendment, a series of proposed amendments that would have placed restrictions on the scope and ratification of treaties and executive agreements entered into by the United States. More recently, a similar provision has been proposed as the fourth article of the Bill of Federalism, a list of ten proposed amendments drafted by law professor Randy Barnett.

Legal scholar Judith Resnik contests the implication that &quot;Missouri&quot; allows for treaties to expand the federal government&#x27;s power, arguing that in the decades since the decision, courts have ruled that the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides Congress with broader regulatory power without the need for a treaty.

Jurist and law professor Thomas Healy has suggested that &quot;Missouri&quot; may not be good law, meaning more recent decisions could overturn the ruling and establish new limits on the Treaty power.

<text>Kevin Robert Elz, often referred to in computing circles as Robert Elz, or simply kre, is a computer programmer and a pioneer in connecting Australia to the Internet, and more recently, in connecting Thailand.

==Career==
Some of his achievements include developing a number of important Internet RFC documents, helping connect Australia to the world-wide Internet, developing the internet-based research network within Australia, and operating the .au domain registry from 1986 through to the late 1990s. He also managed the Usenet hierarchy from its inception in the 1980s until the mid-1990s. In the early 1980s he contributed to the operation of the Australian Computer Science network (ACSnet originally developed by Bob Kummerfeld and Piers Dick-Lauder University of Sydney) and in 1989 with Torben Nielsen of the University of Hawaiʻi he completed the connection work that brought the internet to Australia, which enabled AARNet to develop soon after.

He is an Honorary Fellow at the University of Melbourne, where for some years he worked in the Computer Science department.

An ardent cricket fan, Elz is also credited for pioneering online text commentary for cricket matches.

Having previously lived and worked in Melbourne for many years, he currently lives in Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand, where he is an honorary lecturer in the Computer Engineering Department of the Prince of Songkla University.

==Operation of .com.au==
As the architect of the early domain-name eligibility criteria for &quot;.com.au&quot;, Elz was largely responsible for Australia&#x27;s not experiencing a domain name gold rush in the mid-1990s. The eligibility policy required a direct connection between a company&#x27;s official name and its domain name, in contrast to the strictly first-come-first-served policy of the .com registry.

Elz was, however, criticised during his tenure, as domain name applications often took many months to be examined, despite the commercialisation of the Internet and customer demands for quick turnaround times. In 1990, Elz delegated responsibility for the &quot;.gov.au&quot; and &quot;.edu.au&quot; domains to Geoff Huston at the Australian National University. Elz handed the operation of &quot;.com.au&quot; to Melbourne IT in 1996. Responsibility for other domains was transferred to auDA in 2001.

<text>In myrmecology, a solarium is an above-ground earthen structure constructed by some ant species for the purpose of nest thermoregulation and brood incubation. Solaria are usually dome-shaped and fashioned from a paper-thin layer of soil, connected to the main nest by way of subterranean runs. Some species, such as &quot;Formica candida&quot;, construct solaria using plant materials.

&quot;Tapinoma erraticum&quot; is an example of a solaria-constructing species whose skill at so doing was noted by Horace Donisthorpe in the early 20th century in his book &quot;British Ants, their Life Histories and Classification&quot;.

<text>Randy Shilts (August 8, 1951February 17, 1994) was an American journalist and author. After studying journalism at the University of Oregon, Shilts began working as a reporter for both &quot;The Advocate&quot; and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, as well as for San Francisco Bay Area television stations. In the 1980s, he was noted for being the first openly gay reporter for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. 

His first book, &quot;The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk&quot;, was a biography of LGBT activist Harvey Milk. His second book, &quot;And the Band Played On&quot;, chronicled the history of the AIDS epidemic. Despite some controversy surrounding the book in the LGBT community, Shilts was praised for his meticulous documentation of an epidemic that was little-understood at the time. It was later made into an HBO film of the same name in 1993. His final book, &quot;Conduct Unbecoming: Gays and Lesbians in the US Military from Vietnam to the Persian Gulf&quot;, examined discrimination against lesbians and gays in the military.

Shilts garnered several accolades for his work. He was honored with the 1988 Outstanding Author award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors, the 1990 Mather Lectureship at Harvard University, and the 1993 Lifetime Achievement Award from the . Diagnosed with HIV in 1985, Shilts died of an AIDS-related illness in 1994 at the age of 42.

==Early life==
Born August 8, 1951, in Davenport, Iowa, Shilts grew up in Aurora, Illinois, with five brothers in a conservative, working-class family. He majored in journalism at the University of Oregon, where he worked on the student newspaper, the &quot;Oregon Daily Emerald&quot;, as managing editor. While an undergraduate he came out publicly as gay, and ran for student office with the slogan &quot;Come out for Shilts.&quot; Randy Shilts was one of the first openly gay journalists to write for a major US newspaper. His writing focused on LGBT issues, including the struggle for gay rights.

==Journalism==
Shilts graduated near the top of his class in 1975, but as an openly gay man, he struggled to find full-time employment in what he characterized as the homophobic environment of newspapers and television stations at that time. Shilts wrote for gay news magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot; but quit in 1978 after publisher David Goodstein began requiring employees to participate in EST; Shilts later wrote an exposé of Goodstein&#x27;s brand of EST, the Advocate Experience. Shilts also says &quot;The Advocate&quot; was a &quot;publication that had all these dirty classified ads in it. That I couldn’t send the publication to my parents that I worked for because it was all filled up with &#x27;Gay white man wants somebody to piss on,&#x27; you know?&quot; He subsequently worked as a freelance journalist until he was hired as a national correspondent by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in 1981, becoming &quot;the first openly gay reporter with a gay &#x27;beat&#x27; in the American mainstream press.&quot; AIDS, the disease that would later kill him, first came to nationwide attention that same year and soon Shilts devoted himself to covering the unfolding story of the disease and its medical, social, and political ramifications. During the early years of the AIDS crisis, he denounced San Francisco&#x27;s gay leaders as &quot;inept&quot; and &quot;a bunch of jerks,&quot; accusing them of hiding the emerging epidemic. In 1984, Shilts controversially supported closing the city&#x27;s gay bathhouses.

==Books==
In addition to his extensive journalism, Shilts wrote three books. His first book, &quot;The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk&quot;, is a biography of openly gay San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, who was assassinated by a political rival, Dan White, in 1978. The book broke new ground, being written at a time when &quot;the very idea of a gay political biography was brand-new.&quot;

Shilts&#x27;s second book, &quot;And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic&quot;, published in 1987, won the Stonewall Book Award and would sell over 700,000 copies until 2004. The book made Shilts a trusted commentator on AIDS, to the point that he was the closing speaker at 1989&#x27;s Fifth International AIDS Conference in Montreal. &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; is an extensively researched account of the early days of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. The book was translated into seven languages, and was later made into an HBO film of the same name in 1993, with many big-name actors in starring or supporting roles, including Matthew Modine, Richard Gere, Anjelica Huston, Phil Collins, Lily Tomlin, Ian McKellen, Steve Martin, and Alan Alda, among others. The film earned twenty nominations and nine awards, including the 1994 Emmy Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie.

His last book, &quot;Conduct Unbecoming: Gays and Lesbians in the US Military from Vietnam to the Persian Gulf&quot;, which examined discrimination against lesbians and gays in the military, was published in 1993. Shilts and his assistants conducted over a thousand interviews while researching the book, the last chapter of which Shilts dictated from his hospital bed.

Shilts saw himself as a literary journalist in the tradition of Truman Capote and Norman Mailer. Undaunted by a lack of enthusiasm for his initial proposal for the Harvey Milk biography, Shilts reworked the concept, as he later said, after further reflection: I read &quot;Hawaii&quot; by James Michener. That gave me the concept for the book, the idea of taking people and using them as vehicles, symbols for different ideas. I would take the life-and-times approach and tell the whole story of the gay movement in this way, using Harvey as the major vehicle.

==Criticism and praise==
Although Shilts was applauded for bringing public attention to gay civil rights issues and the AIDS crisis, he was also harshly criticized (and spat upon on Castro Street) by some in the gay community for calling for the closure of gay bathhouses in San Francisco to slow the spread of AIDS. Fellow Bay Area journalist Bob Ross called Shilts &quot;a traitor to his own kind&quot;. In a note included in &quot;The Life and Times of Harvey Milk&quot;, Shilts expressed his view of a reporter&#x27;s duty to rise above criticism: I can only answer that I tried to tell the truth and, if not be objective, at least be fair; history is not served when reporters prize trepidation and propriety over the robust journalistic duty to tell the whole story.

Shilts&#x27; tenacious reporting was highly praised by others in both the gay and straight communities who saw him as &quot;the pre-eminent chronicler of gay life and spokesman on gay issues&quot;. Shilts was honored with the 1988 Outstanding Author award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors, the 1990 Mather Lectureship at Harvard University, and the 1993 Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists&#x27; Association.

In 1999, the Department of Journalism at New York University ranked Shilts&#x27;s AIDS reporting for the &quot;Chronicle&quot; between 1981 and 1985 as number 44 on a list of the top 100 works of journalism in the United States in the 20th century.

==Illness and death==
Although Shilts told &quot;The New York Times&quot; he had declined to be told the results of his HIV test until he had completed the writing of &quot;And the Band Played On&quot;, concerned that the 1987 test result would interfere with his objectivity as a writer, he had earlier announced knowing that he was HIV positive since 1985.

In 1992, Shilts became ill with &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; pneumonia and suffered a collapsed lung; the following year, he was diagnosed with Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview in the spring of 1993, Shilts observed, &quot;HIV is certainly character-building. It&#x27;s made me see all of the shallow things we cling to, like ego and vanity. Of course, I&#x27;d rather have a few more T-cells and a little less character.&quot; Despite being effectively homebound and on oxygen, he was able to attend the Los Angeles screening of the HBO film version of &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; in August 1993. Shilts died at 42 on February 17, 1994, at Davies Medical Center in San Francisco, California, being survived by his partner Barry Barbieri, his mother, and his brothers. His brother Gary had conducted a commitment service for the couple the previous year. After a funeral service at Glide Memorial Church, Shilts was buried at Redwood Memorial Gardens in Guerneville; his longtime friend, Daniel R. Yoder (1952–1995), was later buried alongside him.

==Legacy==
Shilts bequeathed 170 cartons of papers, notes, and research files to the local history section of the San Francisco Public Library. At the time of his death, he was planning a fourth book, examining homosexuality in the Roman Catholic Church. As a fellow reporter put it, despite an early death, in his books Shilts &quot;rewrote history. In doing so, he saved a segment of history from extinction.&quot; Historian Garry Wills wrote of &quot;And the Band Played On&quot;, &quot;This book will be to gay liberation what Betty Friedan was to early feminism and Rachel Carson&#x27;s &quot;Silent Spring&quot; was to environmentalism.&quot; NAMES Project founder Cleve Jones described Shilts as &quot;a hero&quot; and characterized his books as &quot;without question the most important works of literature affecting gay people.&quot;

After his death, his longtime friend and assistant Linda Alband explained the motivation that drove Shilts: &quot;He chose to write about gay issues for the mainstream precisely because he wanted other people to know what it was like to be gay. If they didn&#x27;t know, how were things going to change?&quot; In 1998, Shilts was memorialized in the Hall of Achievement at the University of Oregon School of Journalism, honoring his refusal to be &quot;boxed in by the limits that society offered him. As an out gay man, he carved a place in journalism that was not simply groundbreaking but internationally influential in changing the way the news media covered AIDS.&quot; A &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reporter summed up the achievement of his late &quot;brash and gutsy&quot; colleague:

Perhaps because Shilts remains controversial among some gays, there is no monument to him. Nor is there a street named for him, as there are for other San Francisco writers such as Jack Kerouac and Dashiell Hammett. ... Shilts&#x27; only monument is his work. He remains the most prescient chronicler of 20th century American gay history.

In 2006, &quot;Reporter Zero&quot;, a half-hour biographical documentary about Shilts featuring interviews with friends and colleagues, was produced and directed by filmmaker Carrie Lozano. In 2014, Shilts was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields.&quot;

Shilts is the subject of a 2019 biography, &quot;The Journalist of Castro Street: The Life of Randy Shilts&quot; by Andrew E. Stoner, released May 30, 2019 from the University of Illinois Press. In June 2019, Shilts was one of the inaugural fifty American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn.

In 2024, it was announced that author Michael Lee would write a biography about Shilts&#x27;s life. About the biography, Lee stated, &quot;I think that he has a very substantial and complicated legacy. And I think that that legacy still plays out today. And I&#x27;m hoping that with this book it captures more of that complexity in a way that actually portrays the full human that he was.&quot;

<doc id="1022483" wikidata="Q3818551" url="?curid=1022483" title="Olallieberry">
<text>The olallieberry ( ), sometimes spelled ollalieberry, olallaberry, olalliberry, ollalaberry or ollaliberry, is the marketing name for the &#x27;Olallie&#x27; blackberry released by the USDA-ARS (in collaboration with Oregon State University). The berry was a selection from a cross between the &#x27;Black Logan&#x27; (syn. &#x27;Mammoth&#x27;), developed by Judge James Logan in California, and the youngberry, which was developed by Byrnes M. Young in Louisiana. 

According to Judge Logan, &#x27;Black Logan&#x27; was a cross between the eastern blackberry &#x27;Crandall&#x27; and the western dewberry &#x27;Aughinbaugh&#x27;. &#x27;Youngberry&#x27; was from &#x27;Phenomenal&#x27; x &#x27;Austin Mayes&#x27;. &#x27;Phenomenal&#x27; in turn is a cross of the &#x27;Aughinbaugh&#x27; western dewberry and &#x27;Cuthbert&#x27; red raspberry and so has a similar background to Logan&#x27;s &#x27;Loganberry&#x27; because it shares a parent.

==Development and cultivation==
The original cross was made in 1935 by George Waldo with the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS), who ran the cooperative blackberry breeding program between the USDA-ARS and Oregon State University from 1932 until the 1960s. Selected in 1937 and tested in Oregon, Washington and California as &quot;Oregon 609&quot; (OSC 609), it was named &quot;Olallie&quot; and released in 1950.

During the 20th century, the Olallieberry was hybridized with the Chehalem blackberry to produce the Marion blackberry or &quot;Marionberry&quot;, which when used as the fruit in a pie was named as the official state pie of Oregon in 2017.

== Olallieberry pedigree ==




==In popular culture==

&quot;Olallie&quot; means berry in the Chinook Jargon. Olallie Lake in Oregon&#x27;s Cascade Range is named after the Chinook term due to the abundance of berries in that area.

<text>The Communist Party of Spain ([[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]) (in Spanish: &quot;Partido Comunista de España (marxista-leninista)&quot;, PCE (m-l)) is a communist political party in Spain, formed in 1964 through the merger of splinter groups of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE).

PCE(m-l) followed the line of the Chinese Communist Party and Maoism until it took the side of the Party of Labour of Albania, which granted it official recognition, against the Chinese, during the events that led to the Sino-Albanian split.

==History==
The PCE(m-l) party was formed by communists dissatisfied that the Communist Party of Spain, under the leadership of Santiago Carrillo, had abandoned the armed struggle in 1964. It remained small throughout its existence and in 1968 it shrunk further when a sector of its militants abandoned the party to join the Organisation of Marxist–Leninists of Spain.

In January 1971, at the time when the need was felt to renew the fight against the Francoist rule of Spain, the then Communist Party of Spain (Marxist–Leninist), together with the Spanish National Liberation Front &quot;(FELN)&quot; and &quot;Vanguardia Socialista&quot;, took part in the foundation of the Revolutionary and Patriotic Antifascist Front &quot;(FRAP)&quot; at a meeting in Paris held in a house owned by American writer Arthur Miller. The PCE(m-l) launched then the Coordinating Committee of the Revolutionary Antifascist Patriotic Front, which held its constituent conference in 1974, and was designed to coordinate student insurrections against the Francisco Franco dictatorial regime based on the model of the student demonstrations of May 1968 in France. Initially the Front was led by Julio Álvarez del Vayo, &quot;FELN&quot; leader and a former member of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party.

Other fronts of PCE(m-l) were:
*&quot;Convención Republicana de los Pueblos de España&quot;
*&quot;Juventud Comunista de España (marxista-leninista)&quot;
*&quot;Federación Universitaria Democrática Española&quot;
*&quot;Unión Popular Antifascista&quot;

PCE(m-l) published &quot;Revolución Española&quot;. In 1977, during the Spanish transition to democracy, it started publishing &quot;Vanguardia obrera&quot; as the organ of the Central Committee of the party.

The party was legalized in 1981. That year, a split surged in the party, with a dissident group forming a parallel PCE(m-l) and publishing its own version of &quot;Vanguardia obrera&quot;.

The sixth and last congress of PCE(m-l) was held in 1992, voting to dissolve the party. An agreement was made to form a new group, the &quot;Partido Comunista Democratico&quot;, but that was never carried out. The main leader of PCE(m-l), Raúl Marco, had broken away in 1991 to form the &quot;Colectivo Octubre&quot;, which evolved into Organización Comunista Octubre.

The Organización Comunista Octubre merged with a number of other regional splits from the PCE (m-l) to form the &quot;Comité Estatal de Organizaciones Comunistas&quot; (CEOC).

The CEOC with four other communist organizations merged in 2007 to form the re-founded PCE(m-l). The new PCE (m-l) continues the Hoxhaist line of the old PCE (m-l) and is an active member of the ICMLPO, an international grouping of Hoxhaist communist parties.

<text>Cükätaw (pronounced ; Сhuvash: Çÿхету [Cühetu] Tatar: Җүкәтау, Juketau, ), or Zhukotin () was a medieval Bolgar city during the 10th to 15th centuries CE. The city was situated on the right bank of the Kama, near the modern city of Chistopol. 

In the 10th to 13th centuries it was one of the most important centres of the fur trade in Volga Bulgaria. The city was the capital of the Cükätaw Duchy. In 1236 Cükätaw was destroyed by Batu Khan&#x27;s troops during the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria. Following the Russian pirate raids in the 14th and 15th centuries, the city&#x27;s power declined. After the town was sacked by Yuri of Zvenigorod in 1414, it was abandoned. The ruins are situated near the modern village of Danaurovka.

== Etymology ==
From the Chuvash language Zhuketau is translated as Thin Mountain (hill) from &quot;Zhuke&quot; - Thin, Narrow and &quot;Tau&quot; - mountain, hill. The ancient fortress city was located on a narrow hill.

<text>The Buenos Aires Convention (Third Pan-American Convention) is an international copyright treaty signed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 11 August 1910, providing mutual recognition of copyrights where the work carries a notice containing a statement of reservation of rights (Art. 3). This was commonly done with the phrase &quot;All rights reserved&quot; (; ) next to the copyright notice. This implementation varied as US law only required the author and year of publishing. Copyright protection under the convention is granted for the shorter of the terms of the protecting country and the source country of the work (&quot;rule of the shorter term&quot;, Arts. 6, 7). The rather vague nature of the requirement for a statement of reservation led to the development of longer and more legalistic wordings, which have persisted despite the developments in international copyright law.

The convention is specifically retained by the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) of 6 September 1952 (Art. 18 Geneva Act), with the most recent formulation taking precedence in case of conflict. As the Buenos Aires Convention was not modified, the presence of a simple copyright notice was sufficient to ensure mutual recognition of copyright between countries which became parties to the UCC (which only Honduras never did). As of , all parties to the Buenos Aires Convention are also parties to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which provides for mutual recognition of copyright without any formalities (Art. 5.2 Berne).

The Buenos Aires Convention became a &quot;special agreement&quot; in the terms of Article 20 of the Berne Convention. It remains in force, notably for determining the source country of a work and hence the term of protection which is applicable in countries which apply the &quot;rule of the shorter term&quot;: when a work is simultaneously published in a Convention State and a non-Convention State, the Convention State will be taken to be the source country regardless of the term of protection in the non-Convention State.

<doc id="1022499" wikidata="Q1781967" url="?curid=1022499" title="Aysgarth Falls">
<text>Aysgarth Falls are a triple flight of waterfalls, surrounded by woodland and farmland, carved out by the River Ure over an almost stretch on its descent to mid-Wensleydale in the Yorkshire Dales of England, near the village Aysgarth. The falls are quite spectacular after heavy rainfall as thousands of gallons of water cascade over the series of broad limestone steps, which are divided into three stages: Upper Force, Middle Force and Lower Force.

The falls are an SSSI.

== Description ==

Aysgarth Falls have attracted visitors for more than 200 years, including John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner and William Wordsworth, all of whom enthused about the falls&#x27; outstanding beauty. The falls were created when meltwater from the Ice Age that had been held back by a terminal moraine spilled down over the area and eroded the boulder clay and the bedrock limestone underneath. The falls drop over a half-mile section of the river.

The Falls are situated in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. There is a visitors&#x27; centre with an exhibition, information, items for sale, a café, toilets and a pay-and-display car park.

There are public footpaths through the wooded valley, offering views of the river and falls. Wild flowers appear in the spring and summer, for example snowdrops in January and February, primroses in April and bluebells in May, and birds, squirrels and deer may also be seen. Occasionally salmon can be seen leaping up the falls in autumn. Nearby is St Andrew&#x27;s Church, which reputedly has the largest churchyard in England. The church has a medieval painted wooden screen rescued from the destroyed Jervaulx Abbey.

The name originates from Old Norse and means the open space in the oak trees.

== Popular culture ==
All three falls were featured in the films &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; and Emily Brontë&#x27;s Wuthering Heights, and they were featured on the television programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; as one of the wonders of the North.

<doc id="1022500" wikidata="Q5232867" url="?curid=1022500" title="David Davis Walker">
<text>David Davis Walker (January 19, 1840 – October 4, 1918) was an American businessman. He started his career as a dry goods wholesaler in St. Louis, Missouri. He was the co-founder of Ely &amp; Walker, which remains a clothing brand to this day.

==Early life==
David Davis Walker was born on January 19, 1840, on a farm near Bloomington, Illinois, to George E. Walker (1797–1864) and Harriet Mercer (1802–1869). His paternal grandfather, Thomas Walker, was an English slave trader. Walker was a first cousin of Senator and Supreme Court Justice David Davis.

At age fourteen, he was sent to the Beloit Preparatory Academy, part of Beloit College in Wisconsin.

==Business career==
In 1857, Walker went to St. Louis for business training with the merchandiser Crow, McCreery &amp; Co., then the largest wholesale dry goods house in the city. He worked his way up from office boy, and became a partner after just eight years with the firm. He became ill as a result of his workaholic habits, quitting in 1878, and spent the next two years recovering.

In 1880, he went back to work, forming Ely, Walker &amp; Co. with Frank Ely and others. The business was highly successful, and in 1883 it was incorporated as the Ely &amp; Walker Dry Goods Company. He remained President of the company until 1892, and thereafter retained the largest interest in the firm. In 1896, the company built a massive warehouse on Washington Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri, which became known as Ely Walker Lofts. His sons David Davis, Jr., Joseph Sidney and George Herbert all had involvement with the Ely &amp; Walker firm, which continued as a major clothing manufacturer until it was acquired by Burlington Industries after World War II, but George went into banking.

==Personal life==
Walker married Martha Adela Beaky. They had six children including George Herbert Walker.

==Death and legacy==
Walker died in 1918 at Walker&#x27;s Point, his son George&#x27;s seaside property in Kennebunkport, Maine, the modern-day Bush compound. His great-grandson, George H. W. Bush, and his great-great-grandson, George W. Bush, both served as President of the United States.

<text>Alan Hugh Dale (born 6 May 1947) is a New Zealand actor, known for his early long-running role as Jim Robinson in Australian TV soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;, American series&#x27; &quot;The O.C.&quot; (as Caleb Nichol) and &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; (as Bradford Meade), as well as recurring and guest roles in &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Entourage&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; and &quot;Dynasty&quot; as Joseph Anders.

==Early life and work==

Dale was born on 6 May 1947 in Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand. One of four children, Dale enjoyed his childhood, but his family was relatively poor. Growing up in New Zealand without television, Dale loved rugby union, the theatre and amateur dramatics. His first performance was for a school concert, at the age of 13, doing an impression of comedian Shelley Berman. After moving northwards, his parents became founding members of an amateur theatre in Auckland called &#x27;The Little Dolphin Theatre&#x27;. Dale often operated the stage equipment used to produce weather effects,

Dale was a skilled rugby player, but opted to move into drama instead because &quot;the acting fraternity didn&#x27;t like footballers and the footballers didn&#x27;t like actors. [...] Acting gave me the same buzz and there was the chance of a longer career.&quot; He gave up rugby at the age of 21 because it was not considered a workable career at the time, and he had to support his family. Acting roles were limited in New Zealand so Dale worked in multiple jobs, including as a male model, a car salesman and a realtor. While working as a milkman he heard the disc jockey at his local radio station resign during a broadcast. Dale went over to the station and told the managers he could do a better job. They gave him a trial and then signed him up for the afternoon show. At the age of 27, he decided to become a professional actor.

==Acting career==

===Early roles and &quot;Neighbours&quot;===
Dale&#x27;s first professional acting job was playing an Indian in a production of &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; at the Grafton Theatre in Auckland. His first on-screen role came in the New Zealand television drama &quot;Radio Waves&quot;, which although not successful, he described as &quot;nine months of solid work and great fun.&quot; In the late 1970s, Dale moved to Australia at the age of 32, due to the limited acting work in New Zealand. He applied to the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney, but was rejected because he &quot;was a lot older than anybody else on the course.&quot; He was soon cast as Dr. John Forrest in the Australian soap opera &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;, where he remained for three-and-a-half years until 1982.

In 1985, Dale was cast in the continuing role of Jim Robinson in the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. He appeared on the show from the first episode and stayed for eight years before his character was killed off in 1993. He found working on &quot;Neighbours&quot; &quot;exciting&quot; and it enabled him to provide for his sons, but he said: &quot;You were a totally replaceable commodity; [the production company] didn&#x27;t put any value on any of the people appearing in the show.&quot; He expanded: &quot;I didn&#x27;t like it there, they were not nice people. When we decided that we hated each other, the company and me, one of the things the company did was to market everything they could out of us and pay us nothing.&quot; Dale and the company (Grundy Television) parted on &quot;bad terms&quot;, although he would later go on to appear on the show again in 2018 and 2019.

After &quot;Neighbours&quot;, Dale struggled to find work in Australia because he was typecast as Jim Robinson. His only regular sources of income were voice-overs, and publishing magazines about his former show which he &quot;made quite a lot of money out of&quot;. He lost most of his profits investing in a failed children&#x27;s magazine. In 1999, he was cast in the American television film &quot;First Daughter&quot;, which was filmed in Australia. After discovering he could perform a convincing American accent, Dale attended the film&#x27;s premiere, finally moving with his family to the United States permanently in January 2000. Dale, his second wife Tracey, and their then two-year-old son Nick moved into an &quot;awful little flat&quot; in Los Angeles and found an agent. Dale recalled telling his wife in Melbourne that &quot;there&#x27;s no way this is going to work. But if it does, it proves you can do anything.&quot;

===Wider success===

At the age of 52, he began to revive his career and started taking acting classes, something he had not thought about after being cast in &quot;Neighbours&quot;. He described his age, unknown status and willingness to work for a relatively low fee as being his main assets for getting work in America. His drama teacher, whom he has remained with ever since, told him &quot;that you might want to play great roles, but truth is you will get cast as a specific type. Just work out your type. The others in the class said I was a bit Anthony Hopkins and a bit Sean Connery and that went into my head. I thought if I go for roles those guys would go for I&#x27;m more likely to get them.&quot; The first role he was offered was a part in a series called &quot;Sign of Life&quot;, a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of &quot;ER&quot;. Since then, Dale has been &quot;busier than ever&quot;.

He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;Torchwood&quot;, &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;, &quot;Californication&quot;, and &quot;The Practice&quot;. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in &quot;JAG&quot; and its spin-off &quot;NCIS&quot;, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, playing the &quot;Toothpick Man&quot;. He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of &quot;24&quot;, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial &quot;Midnight Man&quot; and the Australian series &quot;Sea Patrol&quot; in 2008. He also had recurring parts on &quot;Undercovers&quot;, &quot;Entourage&quot; as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series &quot;Moving Wallpaper&quot; as a fictional version of himself. He had a recurring role as King George in the series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, and Emmett in &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, before joining the main cast of &quot;Dominion&quot; in 2014, playing General Edward Riesen.

From 2003 to 2010, Dale appeared in his longest running American roles. He starred in the Fox TV series, &quot;The O.C.&quot; playing Caleb Nichol, a wealthy tycoon. The producers saw that the character had further potential, and made his initially recurring role a regular character in the series. After 35 appearances, Caleb was killed off in the second-season episode &quot;The O.Sea&quot; in 2005. Dale was disappointed that Caleb was written out and described it as a mistake by the production staff. In 2006, Dale was cast in the starring role of Bradford Meade, the owner of Meade Publications in the ABC show &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;. Although he impressed the producers in his audition, he initially lost the role to a &quot;bigger star&quot;. After said star began &quot;causing trouble&quot; and was fired, Dale was given the part. Bradford was killed off during the show&#x27;s second season. Dale appeared in the second-season finale of &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;Live Together, Die Alone&quot;, as Charles Widmore, a businessman and leader of the Others. Dale&#x27;s publicist was initially worried that Widmore (who was an integral part of the show&#x27;s mystery) would become a starring role, meaning it would be hard for Dale to appear in both &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; at the same time. The part became a recurring role, with Dale appearing numerous times between seasons two (2006) and six (2010). He enjoyed the role but often found it difficult due to his character&#x27;s unclear motivation.

In March 2008, Dale replaced Peter Davison in the lead role of King Arthur in the London West End production of Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Spamalot&quot; at the Palace Theatre. He accepted the role because he was a huge fan of &quot;Monty Python&quot; and considered that &quot;life&#x27;s too short&quot; for him to have turned down a West End part. Although he has seen all of the &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; sketches and &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, Dale had never seen &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (from which &quot;Spamalot&quot; is &quot;lovingly ripped off&quot;) and had to buy a copy to prepare for the role. It was not his first experience in musical theatre because he appeared in a 1984 Australian production of &quot;Applause&quot;, but Dale found the comic timing of the part to be the hardest task. &quot;On stage, the battle is to find all of the humorous moments and not skip over them. [...] There&#x27;s an art to Python humour and I&#x27;m aiming to try and get every single joke just right.&quot; He was succeeded in the role by Sanjeev Bhaskar on 23 June 2008.

Dale has also made several film appearances. He appeared as the Romulan Praetor Hiren in &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, a part he got after the actor originally cast fell ill, and had small parts in films such as &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot;, &quot;After the Sunset&quot;, and the minor part of General Ross in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;. Dale said his script for &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; was printed on tin foil so it was impossible to replicate, in order to keep the film&#x27;s plot a secret. He appeared in four films released in 2011: &quot;A Little Bit of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Priest&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid of the Dark&quot;, and &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;, having joined late in the film&#x27;s production.

==Popularity and style==
Despite his mainstream success upon his move to America, Dale remained primarily known for his role as Jim Robinson in &quot;Neighbours&quot; in the United Kingdom and Australia for several years. This was spoofed in a promotional ident for the UK&#x27;s Channel 4 in 2007 which sees Dale taking part in a mock interview about the sudden upturn in his career, before being accosted by an Australian fan, who recognises him as Jim Robinson. Discussing this association after &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;&#x27;s 2007 Golden Globe win, Dale noted: &quot;Every article I read I&#x27;m always, &#x27;Ex-soap star Jim Robinson&#x27;. Maybe now people will just get to know me as actor Alan Dale.&quot; In 2007, Amazon.co.uk reported that they had sold more DVDs of films and television shows featuring Dale than any featuring other ex-&quot;Neighbours&quot; cast members.

Dale&#x27;s characters on most of the American television shows he has appeared on have shared similar character traits, which Dale describes as the &quot;go-to powerful guy&quot;. &quot;I either play rulers of the world or the guy who kills the ruler of the world&quot;, he said, recalling that his age benefited him after moving to the US, because &quot;A lot of the American middle-aged faces were too familiar, I came along and people were saying &#x27;Who is this great new guy?&#x27; And I was cheap&quot;. Following his appearance as Senator Eaton in &quot;The Killing&quot; in 2011, reviewers commented on his tendency to play powerful, wealthy and mysterious characters in many shows. Maureen Ryan of &quot;TV Squad&quot; wrote that it was &quot;lovely to see Alan Dale playing a typically Alan Dale-ian character. He&#x27;s always so great at playing That Sketchy Wealthy Guy With a Hidden Agenda, which he has now played on, I believe, 87 different shows. And he always does it well.&quot; Coincidentally, Dale&#x27;s characters in &quot;Neighbours&quot;, &quot;The O.C.&quot; and &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; have all been killed off by a fatal heart attack. Christopher Rosen of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; wrote in 2008 that &quot;with his square jaw and seemingly no nonsense attitude, Mr. Dale is the go-to actor when casting directors need a conservative-looking authoritarian. When he comes onto the screen, audiences immediately take him seriously, since he radiates rich, smug and serious. He demands your respect.&quot; Rosen says that Dale is &quot;not even...a particularly good actor&quot; but is &quot;fine enough&quot; and &quot;bring[s] a no frills, no gimmicks style to his roles,&quot; and &quot;manages to give a consistent performance in every show he appears on.&quot;

Jayne Nelson, writing in magazine &quot;SFX&quot;, named Dale the second most &quot;serial&quot; science-fiction guest star after Mark Sheppard. She wrote: &quot;The thing is, soap-opera origins aside, Dale is always good. Which is why he keeps getting so much work...Dale never lets you down, always (well, usually) summoning up a pitch-perfect accent, too. There&#x27;s something comforting about his presence on a show, as though the fact he&#x27;s in it has lent it some weight.&quot; In a profile of his work on &quot;cult shows&quot;, Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy called Dale an &quot;institution&quot;.

==Personal life==

In 1968, Dale married his girlfriend, Claire. The couple had two children, Simon and Matthew, both of whom are involved in the entertainment industry, Simon as a radio announcer at Kiss 100 and Matthew as a writer, film maker and actor. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979. At the time, Dale lived in Auckland but after the divorce he moved to Sydney with his sons.

On 8 April 1990, he married Tracey Pearson, the 1986 Miss Australia, whom he met at the 1986 Australian Grand Prix, when she was 21 and he was 39. Dale described it as &quot;the most appropriate relationship I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; Dale also has two children from this marriage, Daniel and Nick.

He and his family now live in Manhattan Beach, California and also owns property in Australia. Dale sold his holiday home in New Zealand in 2011 for $1.25m. Both of Dale&#x27;s parents died in 2007. Dale describes his life philosophy as being Winston Churchill&#x27;s quote &quot;Never, never, never give up&quot;, and counts Gene Hackman as his &quot;big acting hero&quot;.

<text>Explorer 6, or S-2, was a NASA satellite, launched on 7 August 1959, at 14:24:20 GMT. It was a small, spherical satellite designed to study trapped radiation of various energies, galactic cosmic rays, geomagnetism, radio propagation in the upper atmosphere, and the flux of micrometeorites. It also tested a scanning device designed for photographing the Earth&#x27;s cloud cover. On 14 August 1959, Explorer 6 took the first photos of Earth from a satellite.

== Experiments ==
=== Beacon (108 and 378 MHz) ===
This experiment measured the electron density near the satellite. The observational equipment comprised two coherent transmitters operating at 108 and 378 MHz. Doppler difference frequency and change in Faraday rotation of the 108 MHz signal were observed. Signals were observed from the receiving station at Hawaii for 20 to 70 minutes during each of eight passes during 11 days. Severe fading and a strong magnetic storm added to difficulties in data interpretation. The 378 MHz beacon transmitter failure terminated the experiment.

=== Fluxgate Magnetometer ===
A fluxgate magnetometer was used to measure the component of the magnetic field parallel to the spin axis of the vehicle. The measurements, when combined with those made with the search coil magnetometer (which measured components of the ambient field perpendicular to spin axis of vehicle) and the aspect sensor, where intended to determine the direction and magnitude of the ambient magnetic field. It was intended to obtain measurements at altitudes up to 8 Earth radii, but due to permanent multipole disturbances within the vehicle, the fluxgate magnetometer became saturated and returned no data. Thus, information was available from only the search coil and the aspect indicator.

=== Ion Chamber and Geiger–Müller Counter ===
The instrumentation for this experiment consisted of a Neher-type integrating ionization chamber and an Anton 302 Geiger–Müller tube (GM). Due to the complex nonuniform shielding of the detectors, only approximate energy threshold values were available. The ion chamber responded omnidirectionally to electrons and protons with energies greater than 1.5 and 23.6 MeV, respectively. The GM tube responded omnidirectionally to electrons and protons with energies greater than 2.9 and 36.4 MeV respectively. Counts from the GM tube and pulses from the ion chamber were accumulated in separate registers and telemetered by the analog system. The time that elapsed between the first two ion chamber pulses following a data transmission and the accumulation time for 1024 GM tube counts were telemetered digitally. Very little digital data were actually telemetered. The ion chamber operated normally from launch through 25 August 1959. The GM tube operated normally from launch through 6 October 1959.

=== Micrometeorite ===
A micrometeorite detector (micrometeorite momentum spectrometer), which employed piezoelectric crystal microphones as sensing elements, was used to obtain statistics on the momentum flux and the variations of flux of micrometeorites. Although pulses were detected, the experiment returned no data of scientific value.

=== Proportional Counter Telescope ===
A triple-coincidence omnidirectional proportional counter telescope was used to observe protons (with E&gt;75 MeV) and electrons (with E&gt;13 MeV) in the terrestrial trapped radiation region. The scientific objective of the telescopes was to determine some of the properties of high-energy radiation in interplanetary space, including the proportion of counts due to X-rays versus those due to protons and other high-energy particles. Comparison with results from the Cosmic Ray Ionization Chamber makes it possible to determine the type and energy of particles responsible for the measurement.

Each telescope consists of seven proportional counter tubes, six in a concentric ring around the seventh running parallel along their lengths. These bundles of tubes lie on their sides projecting through the top of one of the equipment boxes in the hexagonal base of Ranger 1. Three of the outer tubes are exposed to space and three project into the equipment box. Each set of three is connected electronically into a group that feeds into a pulse amplifier and pulse shaper. The central tube feeds into its own equivalent circuit.

The two telescopes were designated a &quot;low-energy&quot; and &quot;high-energy&quot; telescope, differing only in the amount of shielding and its configuration. The counters in the high-energy telescope were 3-inch long, 0.5-inch diameter brass tubes with a thickness of 0.028 inches. A lead shield of 5 grams per cm2 thickness surrounds the entire assembly. The low-energy unit has the same size tubes but made of steel with a wall thickness of 0.508 ± 0.0025-mm. Half the assembly has 5 grams per cm2 lead shielding along the length of the tubes. The unshielded half of the assembly is the exposed portion that particles can reach without encountering spacecraft structural material, giving an angular resolution of under 180° for low-energy particles. The low-energy telescope can detect protons with energies greater than or equal to 10 MeV and electrons greater than or equal to 0.5 MeV. The high-energy telescope detects 75 MeV and above protons and 13 MeV and above electrons in triple-coincidence, and bremsstrahlung above 200 keV in the central tube.

When a particle passes through the bundle of tubes, the electronic circuit determines which groups have been penetrated. If a pulse comes from all three groups at once, a triple-coincidence, the particle was a high-energy one, rather than a low-energy one or an X-ray. The triple-coincidence events are telemetered together with the single counts from the center tube to determine counts due to high-energy versus low-energy sources. The high-energy telescope counting rate allows correction of the low-energy telescope data in order that the particle flux incident on the unshielded portion of the low-energy unit can be calculated. Comparing data from the low-energy telescope and the Cosmic-Ray Ionization Chamber (both detect particles in the same energy range) makes it possible to determine the average ionization per particle, from which the type and energy of the particle can be determined.

Several magnetic storms occurred during the active life of the experiment. The date of transmission of the last useful information was on 6 October 1959, after which the transmitter failed to operate.

=== Scintillation Counter ===
The scintillation counter experiment was designed to make direct observations of electrons in the Earth&#x27;s radiation belts with a detector insensitive to bremsstrahlung. This experiment consisted of a cylindrical plastic scintillator cemented to a photomultiplier tube. The instrument viewed space through a foil-covered window in the payload shell, but the instrument also responded to more energetic particles passing through the payload shell. The minimum energies detectable were 200 keV for electrons and 2 MeV for protons. For electrons between 200 and 500 keV, the detector efficiency times the omnidirectional geometric factor was 0.0008-cm2 count per electron; whereas for electrons of energy greater than 500 keV, it was 0.16-cm2 count per electron. For very penetrating particles, the geometrical factor rose to its maximum value of 3.5 cm2. The scintillation counter was sampled continuously for analog transmission and intermittently (every 2 minutes, 15 seconds, or 1.9 seconds, depending upon the satellite bit rate) for digital transmission. The transmitter broadcasting the analog data for this experiment failed on 11 September 1959. Data were received on a limited duty cycle from the digital transmitter until early October 1959.

=== Search-Coil Magnetometer ===
This experiment was designed to survey the gross magnetic field of the Earth, to investigate the interplanetary magnetic field, and to detect evidence of any lunar magnetic field. No interplanetary or lunar magnetic fields could be measured, however, because of the spacecraft&#x27;s low apogee. The instrument was similar to that flown on Pioneer 1 and consisted of a single search coil mounted so that it measured the magnetic field perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis. The instrument had a range of 0.6 nT to 1200 nT. No inflight calibration was provided. Some degradation of the telemetry signal occurred due to ionospheric effects. Insufficient ground observations on the electron content of the ionosphere prevented correcting the data for these effects. The experiment had both digital and analog outputs. The magnetometer amplitude and phase were sampled continuously for analog transmission and intermittently (every 2 minutes, 15 seconds, or 1.9 seconds, depending on satellite bit rate) for digital transmission. The magnetometer worked until loss of the telemetry signal in early October 1959.

=== TV Optical Scanner ===
The TV optical scanner flown was an improved version of the TV system first employed on Pioneer 2. The experiment consisted of an optical unit containing a concave spherical mirror and phototransistor, a video amplifier, timing and logic circuits, and telemetry. The experiment was designed to test the feasibility of using such instrumentation to obtain low-resolution daylight cloud cover photographs. The scanner also served as a forerunner to the TV camera systems carried on later, more advanced satellites. The scanner&#x27;s optical axis was directed 45° away from the spacecraft spin axis, which was parallel to the orbital plane. The vehicle&#x27;s spin furnished the line scanning, and the spacecraft&#x27;s forward motion along its trajectory provided the frame scanning. During a scan (one spacecraft revolution), a single scan spot (element) on Earth was viewed and transmitted back to Earth. During the next spacecraft revolution, an adjacent spot was scanned. This procedure was repeated until a line of 64 such spots was formed. Then the process was repeated to form an adjacent line of elements, and so on, until a frame, or picture, was obtained. The system could produce useful photographs only when the spacecraft&#x27;s velocity and orbital position were such that successive lines overlapped. (At apogee, for example, the TV lines were separated by a distance about equal to their length, and hence no meaningful picture could be obtained). Data obtained from this experiment are limited and of extremely poor quality. Proper spacecraft orientation was never achieved, resulting in a considerable amount of blank space between successive scan lines. The scanner&#x27;s logic circuits also failed to operate normally (only every fourth scan spot could be successfully reproduced), further reducing the resolution. The last useful data were obtained on 25 August 1959.

=== VLF Receiver (15.5 kHz) ===
This Very low frequency (VLF) receiver was designed to study Whistler mode propagation and ionospheric noise on 15.5 kHz signals transmitted from Annapolis, Maryland. The signals were received on a small electric antenna which was simultaneously used to transit Very high frequency (VHF) telemetry. The signal intensity on a 3-db bandwidth of 100 hz was observed along with the antenna impedance. The dynamic range of the receiver was about 80 db. This experiment operated from launch up to about 160 km before failure. With the antenna in a folded configuration for launch, the receiver recorded all data at a sensitivity reduced by about 30 db. At , the signals disappeared into the noise background. However, by special techniques, data were made usable all the way up to .

== Launch ==
The satellite was launched on top of a Thor-Able rocket in Cape Canaveral, Florida into a highly elliptical orbit on 7 August 1959, at 14:24:20 GMT.

== First image of Earth by a satellite ==
On 14 August 1959, Explorer 6 took the first image of Earth ever by a satellite. It was over Mexico at an altitude of approximately . The image was a picture of the north central Pacific Ocean, transmitted to a ground station in Hawaii over a 40 minute span.

== ASAT test ==
On 13 October 1959, an anti-satellite missile (ASAT) test of the Bold Orion missile used Explorer 6 as a target. The missile successfully passed within of the satellite. Launch took place within the Atlantic Missile Range Drop Zone (AMR DZ). The altitude, latitude and longitude of the drop point were , 29° North and 79° West, respectively. Bold Orion successfully intercepted the Explorer 6 satellite, passing its target at a range of less than and an altitude of .

== Mission ==
The satellite was spin-stabilized at 2.8 rotation per second (rps), with the direction of the spin axis having a right ascension of 217° and a declination of 23°. Four solar cell paddles mounted near its equator recharged the storage batteries while in orbit. Each experiment except the television scanner had two outputs, digital and analog. An Ultra high frequency (UHF) transmitter was used for the digital telemetry and the TV signal. Two Very high frequency (VHF) transmitters were used to transmit the analog signal. The VHF transmitters were operated continuously. The UHF transmitter was operated for only a few hours each day. Only three of the solar cell paddles fully erected, and this occurred during spin-up rather than prior to spin-up as planned. Consequently, initial operation of the payload power supply was 63% nominal, and this decreased with time. The decreased power caused a lower signal-to-noise ratio affecting most of the data, especially near apogee. One VHF transmitter failed on 11 September 1959, and the last contact with the payload was made on 6 October 1959, at which time the solar cell charging current had fallen below that required to maintain the satellite equipment.

The satellite&#x27;s orbit decayed on 1 July 1961.

A total of 827 hours of analog and 23 hours of digital data were obtained.

<text>Andrei Mikhailovich Kivilev (, 20 September 1973 – 12 March 2003) was a professional road bicycle racer from Taldykorgan, Kazakhstan. In March 2003, he crashed during the Paris–Nice race and subsequently died of his injuries. His death was the trigger for the UCI to implement the compulsory wearing of helmets in all endorsed races.

== Career ==
Born in Taldykorgan, Almaty Province, Kivilev began his amateur racing career in Spain, before moving to France, where he wore the EC Saint-Étienne jersey. In 1993, he had a successful Regio-Tour as part of a successful tour for the Kazakh team: Kivilev won the points competition; teammate Alexander Vinokourov won the combined competition; and the team won the team competition. He secured a professional contract with Festina in 1998 and rode with them until the end of 1999. Kivilev had a modest time at Festina, where his best results were fifth at the Championship of Zurich and seventh at the Critérium International. Despite his lack of professional victories, Kivilev attracted admirers for his riding style, and despite interest from US Postal Service, signed with Ag2r Prévoyance in 2000, before moving to Cofidis in 2001. It was at Cofidis that his career started to take off: in his first season, not only did he win the Route du Sud and stage five of the Dauphiné Libéré race, between Romans-sur-Isère and Grenoble, but also had a sensational performance in the Tour de France. Having lost over eighteen minutes on a windswept and attritional stage 4 between Huy and Verdun, Kivilev was allowed to form part of a fourteen-man breakaway on stage 8 between Colmar and Pontarlier and gained 33 minutes on the race favourites. Kivilev was an able climber, and limited his losses on the big hills. His time trialling let him down when he lost a podium place to Joseba Beloki on the final time trial. Nevertheless, Kivilev finished the tour in 4th position. In fact, with later doping scandals eliminating those ahead of him on the podium, the French newspaper Le Monde retroactively (and unofficially) named Kivilev winner of the 2001 Tour de France.

== Death ==
On 11 March 2003, Kivilev was racing in the second stage of Paris–Nice, between La Clayette and Saint-Étienne. Approximately forty kilometres from the stage finish, as the peloton passed through Saint-Chamond, he collided with his Polish teammate Marek Rutkiewicz and German Volker Ordowski of Team Gerolsteiner. Rutkiewicz and Ordowski were not seriously hurt and finished the stage, but the helmetless Kivilev hit the ground and did not rise. He fell into a coma, initially being taken to the Saint-Chamond hospital before being transferred via air to the intensive care unit at Saint-Étienne hospital, where he was diagnosed with a serious skull fracture and two broken ribs. His condition worsened overnight, and he died of his injuries at 10 a.m. on 12 March 2003. He was survived by his wife Natalia and six-month-old son Leonardo. A few days later, his friend Alexander Vinokourov won the race.

== Legacy ==

After Kivilev&#x27;s death, the UCI made the wearing of helmets compulsory. They had previously tried to introduce this requirement in 1991, but some riders protested this at the Paris–Nice race, so the rule was not introduced. The nature of Kivilev&#x27;s death, in that he was a lead rider, in one of the top French cycling teams, racing in a top stage race, coupled with advances in helmet technology, brought the debate back to the fore and conclusively so for the UCI. Whilst many riders were initially still against compulsory helmet use, the UCI ensured the rules requiring helmets to be worn at all times would be in place for the 2003 Giro d&#x27;Italia, which started just eight weeks after Kivilev&#x27;s death. Dissension to the rule was initially high, but the new rules were affirmed in October 2003. Whilst at first the rule was loose and not tightly enforced, especially on mountain-top finishes, it has since been enforced more strictly and helmet-wearing is now universal and uncontroversial in the peloton of both professional as well as amateur races. It has also become common-place among recreational riders in many parts of the world.

<text>Gideon Decker Robertson, (August 26, 1874 – August 25, 1933) was a Canadian Senator and Canadian Cabinet minister.

Robertson was a telegrapher by profession and had links with conservatives in the labour movement. In January 1917, he was appointed to the Senate as a Conservative as a means of bringing in labour representation during the First World War. When Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden formed a Unionist government in October as a means of creating a national government for the war effort, he included Robertson in the cabinet, making him minister without portfolio despite not having a seat in the House of Commons, to represent organised labour.

==Winnipeg General Strike==
On November 8, 1918, Robertson became Minister of Labour.

He held this portfolio in 1919 during the Winnipeg General Strike. At the beginning of the strike Robertson and Minister of Interior Arthur Meighen went to the city to meet the &quot;Citizens&#x27; Committee of 1000&quot; which had been formed by local businessmen and professionals in opposition to the strike. He refused to meet the Central Strike Committee to hear their demands.

Robertson ordered federal government employees to return to work or lose their jobs.

On June 17, he ordered the arrest of the twelve principal strike leaders, including J. S. Woodsworth. Robertson also supported the government&#x27;s decision to send in the Royal North-West Mounted Police to crush the strike in an action that became known as &quot;Bloody Saturday&quot;.

Robertson earned the longstanding enmity of the left and labour movement for his role in the strike. Despite his background, most of the working class did not consider him a legitimate representative of workers.

==Minister of Labour under two prime ministers==
Robertson retained his position as labour minister when Arthur Meighen became Prime Minister of Canada until the government&#x27;s defeat in the 1921 federal election.

Robertson returned to government when R. B. Bennett&#x27;s Conservatives won the 1930 election, and again became Minister of Labour, but remained unpopular with his constituents.

When visiting Winnipeg in 1932, six thousand workers met him at the railway station with the slogan: &quot;A Faker Comes to Town.&quot; He stepped down as Labour minister in February and died in Ottawa the next year, two weeks after being paralyzed by a stroke.

<text>The zhanmadao () was a single-bladed anti-cavalry Chinese sword. It originated during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) and was especially common in Song China (960–1279).

== General characteristics ==
The &quot;zhanmadao&quot; is a single-edged sabre with a long broad blade, and a long handle suitable for two-handed use. It was used as an anti-cavalry weapon, dating from Emperor Cheng of Han, made to slice through a horse&#x27;s legs. This is mentioned in the &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot;, a Song military manual from 1072. It featured prominently against the Jin armies in campaigns between 1129 and 1141.

The earliest variant of the &quot;zhanmadao&quot; is called zhanmajian (), literally &quot;horse beheading &quot;jian&quot;&quot;. The &quot;zhanmajian&quot; existed during the Han dynasty, so called because it was supposedly able to cut off a horse&#x27;s head. The difference between the two is that &quot;zhanmajian&quot; is double-edged whereas the &quot;zhanmadao&quot; is single-edged, which persists with the meaning of &quot;jian&quot; and &quot;dao&quot;. Another suggestion is that the &quot;zhanmajian&quot; was an execution tool used on special occasions rather than a military weapon.

Surviving examples include a sword that might resemble a nagamaki in construction; it had a wrapped handle long making it easy to grip with two hands with a blade that was long and straight, with a slight curve in the last half.

== Similar weapons ==
Possible variations of these Chinese swords were the changdao of Tang dynasty and Ming dynasty, wodao of Qing dynasty, as well as miaodao of the Republican Era.

<doc id="1022544" wikidata="Q499396" url="?curid=1022544" title="Love in the Time of Cholera">
<text>Love in the Time of Cholera () is a novel written in Spanish by Colombian Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel García Márquez and published in 1985. Edith Grossman&#x27;s English translation was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1988.

==Plot summary==
The main characters of the novel are Florentino Ariza and Fermina Daza. Florentino and Fermina fall in love in their youth. A secret relationship blossoms between the two with the help of Fermina&#x27;s Aunt Escolástica. They exchange love letters. But once Fermina&#x27;s father, Lorenzo Daza, finds out about the two, he demands his daughter stop seeing Florentino immediately. When she refuses, he moves with her to another city where they live with relatives of his deceased wife. Regardless of the distance, Fermina and Florentino continue to communicate via telegraph. Upon her return, Fermina realizes that her relationship with Florentino was nothing but a dream since they are practically strangers; she breaks off her engagement to Florentino and returns all his letters.

A young and accomplished national hero, Dr. Juvenal Urbino, meets Fermina and begins to court her. Despite her initial dislike of Urbino, Fermina gives in to her father&#x27;s persuasion and the security and wealth Urbino offers, and they wed. Urbino is a physician devoted to science, modernity, and &quot;order and progress&quot;. He is committed to the eradication of cholera and to the promotion of public works. He is a rational man whose life is organized precisely and who greatly values his importance and reputation in society. He is a herald of progress and modernization.

Even after Fermina&#x27;s engagement and marriage, Florentino swore to stay faithful and wait for her; but his promiscuity gets the better of him and he has hundreds of affairs. Even with all the women he is with, he makes sure that Fermina will never find out. Meanwhile, Fermina and Urbino grow old together, going through happy years and unhappy ones and experiencing all the reality of marriage. Urbino proves in the end not to have been an entirely faithful husband, confessing one affair to Fermina many years into their marriage. Though the novel seems to suggest that Urbino&#x27;s love for Fermina was never as spiritually chaste as Florentino&#x27;s was, it also complicates Florentino&#x27;s devotion by cataloging his many trysts as well as a few potentially genuine loves.

As an elderly man, Urbino dies in a fall. After the funeral Florentino proclaims his love for Fermina once again and tells her he has stayed faithful to her all these years. Hesitant at first because she is only recently widowed, and finding his advances untoward, Fermina comes to recognize Florentino&#x27;s wisdom and maturity. She eventually gives him a second chance, and their love is allowed to blossom during their old age. They go on a steamship cruise up the river together.

*Lorenzo Daza – Fermina Daza&#x27;s father, a mule driver; he despised Florentino and forced him to stop meeting Fermina. He is revealed to have been involved in some illicit businesses to build his fortune.
*Jeremiah de Saint-Amour – The man whose suicide is introduced as the opening to the novel; a photographer and chess-player.
*Aunt Escolástica – The woman who attempts to aid Fermina in her early romance with Florentino by delivering their letters for them. She is ultimately sent away by Lorenzo Daza for this.
*Tránsito Ariza – Florentino&#x27;s mother.
*Hildebranda Sánchez – Fermina&#x27;s cousin.
*Miss Barbara Lynch – The woman with whom Urbino confesses having had an affair, the only one during his long marriage.
*Leona Cassiani – She starts out as the &quot;personal assistant&quot; to Uncle Leo XII at the R.C.C., the company which Florentino eventually controls. At one point, it is revealed that the two share a deep respect, possibly even love, for each other, but will never actually be together. She has a maternal love for him as a result of his &quot;charity&quot; in rescuing her from the streets and giving her a job.
*Diego Samaritano – The captain of the riverboat on which Fermina and Florentino ride at the end of the novel.
*América Vicuña – The 14-year-old girl who toward the end of the novel is sent to live with the elderly Florentino; he is her guardian while she is in school. They have a sexual relationship, and after being rejected by Florentino and failing her exams, she kills herself. Her grooming and subsequent suicide provides a counterpoint to the novel&#x27;s grand romantic themes.

==Setting==
The story occurs mainly in an unnamed port city somewhere near the Caribbean Sea and the Magdalena River in Colombia. While the city remains unnamed throughout the novel, descriptions and names of places suggest it is based on an amalgam of Cartagena and the nearby city of Barranquilla. The fictional city is divided into such sections as &quot;The District of the Viceroys&quot; and &quot;The Arcade of the Scribes&quot;. The novel takes place approximately between 1880 and the early 1930s. The city&#x27;s &quot;steamy and sleepy streets, rat-infested sewers, old slave quarter, decaying colonial architecture, and multifarious inhabitants&quot; are mentioned variously in the text and mingle in the lives of the characters.

==Major themes==
===Narrative as seduction===
Some critics choose to consider &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; as a sentimental story about the enduring power of true love. Others criticize this opinion as being too simple.

This is manifested by Ariza&#x27;s excessively romantic attitude toward life, and his gullibility in trying to retrieve the sunken treasure of a shipwreck. It is also made evident by the fact that society in the story believes that Fermina and Juvenal Urbino are perfectly happy in their marriage, while the reality of the situation is not so ideal. Critic Keith Booker compares Ariza&#x27;s position to that of Humbert Humbert in Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot;, saying that just as Nabokov&#x27;s Humbert, despite being a &quot;pervert, a rapist, and a murderer,&quot; is able to charm the reader into sympathizing with his situation with his first-person account, Márquez&#x27;s Ariza is able to garner the reader&#x27;s sympathy, even though the reader is reminded repeatedly of his more sinister exploits through the charming third-person narration.

===Relationship between love and passion===
The term &quot;cholera&quot; as it is used in Spanish, , can also denote passion or human rage and ire in its feminine form. (The English adjective has the same meaning.) Considering this meaning, the title is a pun: cholera as the disease, and cholera as passion, which raises the central question of the book: is love helped or hindered by extreme passion? The two men can be contrasted as the extremes of passion: one having too much, one too little; the central question of which is more conducive to love and happiness becomes the specific, personal choice that Fermina faces through her life. Florentino&#x27;s passionate pursuit of nearly countless women stands in contrast to Urbino&#x27;s clinical discussion of male anatomy on their wedding night. Urbino&#x27;s eradication of cholera in the town takes on the additional symbolic meaning of ridding Fermina&#x27;s life of rage, but also the passion. 
It is this second meaning to the title that manifests itself in Florentino&#x27;s hatred for Urbino&#x27;s marriage to Fermina, as well as in the social strife and warfare that serves as a backdrop to the entire story.

===Aging and death===
Jeremiah Saint-Amour&#x27;s death inspires Urbino to meditate on his own death, and especially on the infirmities that precede it. It is necessary for Fermina and Florentino to transcend not only the difficulties of love but also the societal opinion that love is a young person&#x27;s prerogative (not to mention the physical difficulties of love when one is older).

==Critical reception==
The novel received critical acclaim. The literary critic Michiko Kakutani praised the book in a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, saying: &quot;Instead of using myths and dreams to illuminate the imaginative life of a people as he&#x27;s done so often in the past, Mr. Garcia Marquez has revealed how the extraordinary is contained in the ordinary ... The result is a rich, commodious novel, a novel whose narrative power is matched only by its generosity of vision.&quot; The writer Thomas Pynchon, also for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, argued: &quot;This novel is also revolutionary in daring to suggest that vows of love made under a presumption of immortality – youthful idiocy, to some – may yet be honored, much later in life when we ought to know better, in the face of the undeniable. ... There is nothing I have read quite like this astonishing final chapter, symphonic, sure in its dynamics and tempo, moving like a riverboat too ... at the very best it results in works that can even return our worn souls to us, among which most certainly belongs &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;, this shining and heartbreaking novel.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

Stone Village Pictures bought the movie rights from the author for US$3 million, and Mike Newell was chosen to direct it, with Ronald Harwood writing the script. Filming started in Cartagena, Colombia, during September 2006.

The $50 million film, the first major foreign production filmed in the scenic walled city in twenty years, was released on November 16, 2007, by New Line Cinema. On his own initiative, García Márquez persuaded singer Shakira, who is from the nearby city of Barranquilla, to provide two songs for the film.

==References in popular culture==

In the 2000 film &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, the main character, Rob (played by John Cusack) owns a record store. While recounting tales of past lovers he says: &quot;I&#x27;m not the smartest guy in the world, but I&#x27;m certainly not the dumbest. I mean, I&#x27;ve read books like &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; and &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;, and I think I&#x27;ve understood them. They&#x27;re about girls, right? Just kidding.&quot;

At the end of Jeanine Cummins&#x27; novel &quot;American Dirt&quot;, the protagonist Lydia re-reads &quot;Amor en los tiempos del colera&quot;, first in Spanish, then again in English. The final two sentences of the novel reference the protagonist&#x27;s love of the book: &quot;No one can take this from her. This book is hers alone.&quot;

In the British sitcom &quot;Bad Education&quot;, the text is used in the after school book club Rosie Gulliver attends, and Alfie Wickers decides to join them to impress Rosie and attempts to read the book in six hours. However, he finds the book boring and gets his class to read one chapter each and bring him their versions of the summary.

In the episode &quot;Milk&quot; of the first season of the American sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, the novel is mentioned as being the favorite of the show&#x27;s protagonist, Ted Mosby. He is also shown reading the book at the Farhamptom Train Station right before he meets the titular Mother in the finale episode &quot;Last Forever&quot;.

In &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Rival&quot; (&quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; second episode of season 6), Marge Simpson is seen reading &quot;Love in the Time of Scurvy&quot;, a clear reference to the novel.

In the &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; episode &quot;New Haven Can Wait&quot; (season 2, episode 6), Jordan, a Literature professor at Yale University, asks Nate what he thinks of the book. However, he has never read it and clearly does not understand the reference.

In the film &quot;Playing It Cool&quot;, Topher Grace plays the character Scott. Scott is a writer and is deeply moved by the book so much that he often leaves copies of the book in public places for others to find and read. He leaves a note in the book for the assumed reader explaining how this book changed his life. Chris Evans, the main character/narrator, finally picks up the book to read. After reading the book, the narrator applies it to his own life. He says that there are people in our lives that are so important, they dwarf everything else.

In the Chris Rock film &quot;Top Five&quot;, Rosario Dawson quotes the novel, saying, &quot;Too much love is as bad for this as no love at all&quot; when talking about her favorite authors.

In the 2014 entry to the Sims franchise, &quot;The Sims 4&quot;, an in-game book &quot;Love in the Time of Sandwiches&quot; serves as an allusion to the real world novel.

The book was a major part of the plot of the movie &quot;Serendipity&quot;, where Sara writes her number in the book in the hope that Jon will one day find it.

Sales of &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The title of the 2020 television show &quot;Love in the Time of Corona&quot; is a play on the title of the novel, replacing &quot;cholera&quot; with a reference to the coronavirus disease that caused the ongoing pandemic.

Multiple musical artists have recorded songs with titles inspired by the book, including Danny Elfman (&quot;Love in the Time of Covid&quot;), AJJ (&quot;Love in the Time of Human Papillomavirus&quot;) and Oneohtrix Point Never (&quot;Love in the Time of Lexapro&quot;).

In episode 4 of the 2021 Korean drama &quot;My Roommate Is a Gumiho&quot;, the male lead character Shin Woo-yeo (Jang Ki-yong) references the novel by saying, &quot;You could be Fermina Daza in someone&#x27;s eyes.&quot;

<text>Colonel Claypool&#x27;s Bucket of Bernie Brains (C2B3) was an experimental rock supergroup featuring bassist Les Claypool, guitarist Buckethead, keyboardist Bernie Worrell and drummer Brain.

==History==
Les Claypool, bassist of many bands, including Primus, collaborated with virtuoso guitarist Buckethead, funk keyboardist Bernie Worrell, and former Primus drummer Brain under the name Colonel Claypool&#x27;s Bucket of Bernie Brains (a combination of all the band members&#x27; names), after they met at the 2002 Bonnaroo Music and Arts festival. Worrell, Brain and Buckethead were there to perform with Bill Laswell as Praxis. Laswell was not able to play at the concert, so Claypool invited them to jam with him. From this point, they developed the concept of this supergroup. Their concerts pushed the improvisational envelope by preparing no material and not rehearsing beforehand. At one of their shows they prepared sandwiches onstage for the audience members to eat.

Colonel Claypool&#x27;s Bucket of Bernie Brains reunited in 2004 to record &quot;The Big Eyeball in the Sky&quot;, an album with equal parts instrumental and vocal songs. The band began an 18-state tour of the US on September 24, 2004. Claypool said the tour was &quot;a traveling, oversized sock-puppet show spawned by the characters of a Tobe Hooper film and scored by Danny Elfman on bad acid.&quot; The album features only one guest, the multi-talented Gabby La La (noted as Gabby Lang on Les Claypool&#x27;s Frog Brigade&#x27;s &quot;Purple Onion&quot;) on vocals and sitar. She also opened on every show during the 2004 tour to mixed reviews as a solo act, sometimes with members of C2B3.

Produced and Engineered by Les Claypool, with photography by Jay Blakesberg and album packaging designed by Zoltron. 

Keyboardist Bernie Worrell died at his home in Everson, Washington, on June 24, 2016.

&quot;G-Force&quot; was released in the United States on July 24, 2009. It grossed $292.8 million worldwide against a production budget of $150 million. It received mostly negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==

A special government program, training and deploying highly intelligent rodents as secret agents, is facing abolition from the FBI. To save the department, Dr. Ben Kendall, the head of the program, orders an unauthorized mission for the primary field team known as G-Force, consisting three guinea pigs named Darwin, Blaster, Juarez, respectively, a mole named Speckles, and a fly named Mooch. The mission is to infiltrate the residence of home electronics magnate Leonard Saber, and acquiring information about a new microchip he has developed. Darwin finds a classified file titled Clusterstorm on Saber&#x27;s personal computer, containing plans for global extermination, and downloads it to his PDA. However, the next day during a briefing with the FBI, the file turns out to be false, which angers Ben&#x27;s superior, Agent Kip Killian, who shuts down the program. He orders the animals&#x27; capture, forcing Darwin, Blaster, Juarez, and Speckles to escape and hide in a delivery truck.

The truck goes to a pet store where they are mistaken for ordinary rodents and are locked up in a cage. There, they meet Hurley, another guinea pig, Bucky, a cocky hamster, and three mice. Determined to finish their mission, each of them forms an escaping plan. Blaster and Juarez get themselves sold to a family, while Speckles pretends to be dead to get buried, but is thrown into a garbage truck instead, seemingly crushed to death. Darwin escapes with Hurley&#x27;s help, who becomes convinced that Darwin is his long-lost brother due to their birthmark. While Blaster and Juarez escape their new owners, Ben and his assistant, Marcie retrieve Darwin&#x27;s PDA from the FBI, and discover that it is infected with an extermination virus. Saber holds a meeting with his associates, including his prime engineer, the mysterious &quot;Mr. Yanshu&quot;, and reports that Clusterstorm will launch in less than 48 hours.

On their way to Ben&#x27;s house, Darwin and Hurley see a Saberling coffee machine and Darwin decides to investigate it. Upon trying to remove its microchip, the coffee machine turns into a violent robot, but they manage to destroy it. G-Force reunites at Ben&#x27;s, but after hearing of what happened to Speckles, Ben reveals to the team that neither of them were genetically engineered as they believed to. They were rescued from various places, and Darwin himself was bought from a pet shop just like Hurley told him earlier. Despite learning their true origins, the team still has their faith in themselves. Deciding to use the infected PDA to shut down the microchips, they go to Saber&#x27;s mansion in their hamster ball-shaped vehicles, during which they escape from the FBI agents sent by Killian to capture them.

At Saber&#x27;s mansion, the team tries to reach the mainframe, but Hurley accidentally steps on a bomb-trap, resulting in an explosion which separates Blaster and Juarez from Darwin. Clusterstorm activates, turning all Saberling products into killing machines around the world. When an FBI field team led by Killian arrives at Saber&#x27;s mansion to arrest him, he claims that he simply wanted to use the microchips for electronic communication. Arriving in Saber&#x27;s basement, Darwin discovers that a surviving Speckles is Mr. Yanshu, the mastermind behind Clusterstorm (Yanshu means &quot;mole&quot; in Chinese). He elaborates his plan to use the Saberling products for a bombardment of space debris to make Earth&#x27;s surface uninhabitable, therefore destroying humanity as revenge for killing his family. He amalgamates the various appliances into a giant robot, which overpowers the police. Darwin falls from above, losing the PDA in the process, but Hurley saves him and uses his weight to lift Darwin up to the robot.

Darwin tries to convince Speckles to change his ways, reminding him of how Ben took them in and made them a real family. Realizing his plan will cost him the only family he has left, Speckles attempts to shut down the system and fails. Mooch recovers the PDA and Darwin uploads the virus to the main server, destroying the robot, while Juarez save them from falling. They later find Hurley under the ruins, injured and unconscious. Darwin states that Hurley&#x27;s actions were truly heroic, and finally acknowledges him as his brother. Hurley regains consciousness and becomes a member of the team.

G-Force receives personal recognition from the FBI Director, who tells them that Saber had been assigned to recall all his products, while Speckles is given the duty of removing the microchips before rejoining the team. Killian is relocated to an FBI base on the South Pole as a punishment for trying to arrest G-Force. The FBI gives full support to Ben&#x27;s program, with Bucky and the mice joining it, and Darwin, Blaster, Juarez, and Hurley become official FBI Special Agents.
