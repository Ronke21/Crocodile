<text>The British Rail Class 153 &quot;[[Sprinter (British Rail)|Super Sprinter]]&quot; are single-coach diesel-hydraulic railcars which were converted from two-coach Class 155 diesel multiple units in the early 1990s. The class was intended for service on rural branch lines, either where passenger numbers do not justify longer trains or to boost the capacity on services with high passenger volume.

==Description==
In 1987 and 1988, Regional Railways took delivery of 35 two-coach Class 155 units, built by Leyland Bus at its Workington factory, to replace older DMUs. After the Class 155s entered service, a further requirement emerged for the replacement of ageing railcars on rural lines, mostly of Class 121 and Class 122. British Rail decided to meet this need by dividing each unit in the Regional Railways Class 155 fleet into two separate railcars that could then be converted for use independently, which would create a fleet of 70 vehicles. The seven further Class 155 units that had been delivered to the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (WYPTE) in 1989 were not included in this plan.

In 1990, British Rail awarded a contract for the work to Hunslet-Barclay and it was undertaken at the firm&#x27;s Kilmarnock plant in 1991 and 1992. The Class 155 units had been numbered from 155301 to 155335 and consisted of DMSL(A) vehicles 52301 to 52335 and DMSL(B) vehicles 57301 to 57335. After separation, the DMSL(A) vehicles were given new unit numbers from 153301 to 153335, while the DMSL(B) vehicles were renumbered 57351 to 57385 (incrementing each by 50) and given matching &#x27;unit&#x27; numbers from 153351 to 153385.

The conversion involved retrofitting a driver&#x27;s cab into the spaces previously used for luggage racks at the &quot;inside&quot; end (B-end) of each vehicle, where each vehicle had previously been coupled back-to-back with its matching opposite in a Class 155 formation. This new cab is notably smaller than the original one at the A-end, as the positions of the exterior doors were not changed during the conversion, and it was necessary to reduce the size of the vestibule slightly in order to provide enough space for the driver. The difference in cab sizes is visible from the outside of the vehicle, which appears unsymmetrical when viewed from the sides. The arrangement of headlights on the new cab end is also different to that on the original cab end.

They are fitted with BSI automatic couplers and are able to work in tandem with other multiple units with BSI couplers and compatible coupler electrical wiring; these are Classes 142, 143, 144, 150, 155, 156, 158, 159, 170 and 172. Gangway connections are provided at either end to allow passengers and staff to walk between units working in multiple, in-class as well as 150/2, 155, 156, 158 and 159. The maximum speed of was unchanged.

=== Current operations ===

==== Wales &amp; Borders ====

Transport for Wales Rail has a fleet of 24 Class 153s in active service. They are normally used on rural branch lines – such as the Heart of Wales Line from to and on local stopping services from to via – but are also used on some mainline services. One is used daily on the short Cardiff Queen Street to Cardiff Bay shuttle.

Following a timetable change in December 2006, Arriva Trains Wales had lost three of its then-11 Class 153 units, leaving it with eight. Two were transferred to East Midlands Trains with the other going to First Great Western. In October 2018 all eight passed with the franchise to Transport for Wales (KeolisAmey Wales), who acquired a further five from Great Western Railway in April 2019, five from Abellio Greater Anglia in December 2019, four from East Midlands Railway in January 2020 and another two from EMR in November 2020, which brought the total number up to 24 until a further two units were acquired.

As at February 2020, Transport for Wales was the only train operating company to have modified 153s to comply with the requirements of the Persons with Reduced Mobility Technical Specification for Interoperability (PRM-TSI), which came into effect on 1 January 2020. In June 2021, the new state-owned Transport for Wales Rail purchased eight outright for continued use on the Heart of Wales line after plans to replace them with Class 170 units were cancelled. In July 2022, the refurbishment of the 26 units was completed.

====Scotland====

In 2019 and 2020, five former GWR 153s moved from Northern to Abellio ScotRail for use on West Highland Line services between Glasgow and , in conjunction with ScotRail&#x27;s existing fleet. The first refurbished carriage was unveiled in late 2020. The first unit began service on 19 July 2021.

The trains have also been refurbished inside providing free Wi-Fi, plug and USB sockets, and maps of the West Highland Line on the tables. ScotRail describe the service offering as &quot;Highland Explorer&quot; and charge a £10 upgrade fee for passengers using it. Due to a local agreement with driver&#x27;s union ASLEF, ScotRail&#x27;s Class 153s can only be driven from the A-end cab the B-end cab being considered too cramped for long-distance driving.

====Network Rail====

In May 2021, Network Rail purchased three units (153311, 153376, and 153385) for use on infrastructure monitoring services.

===Former operations===
====Regional Railways====

Regional Railways operated Class 153s on many branch lines throughout the Midlands, Wales and Northern England, both individually and with other classes of Sprinter unit. They were initially allocated to Heaton (15), Cardiff Canton (9), Plymouth Laira (10), Crown Point (16) and Tyseley (20). Class 153s were often found working services from;

* to 
* to 
* to via Leicester
* to 
* to and 
* to and 

====Post privatisation====
In the lead up to privatisation of British Rail, ownership of the fleet passed to Angel Trains (30) and Porterbrook (40) in April 1994. Upon privatisation, they were initially operated by Anglia Railways, Central Trains, First North Western, Northern Spirit, and Wales &amp; West.

====South West England====
First Great Western took over the Wessex Trains fleet upon the merger of the two franchises. Wessex Trains had, in turn, inherited its fleet of 13 units from its predecessor Wales &amp; West.

Units were used on local services in Cornwall, Devon, and around Bristol. They were also used on Bristol Temple Meads to Weymouth, Southampton Central, and Worcester Foregate Street services, and the Swindon via Melksham to Southampton Central service.

In mid-2004, Wessex Trains received a further two units from Central Trains to allow it to lengthen some services.

Following the introduction of a new timetable in December 2006, four units were taken off lease and stored at Eastleigh Works. After a period in storage these four units were pressed into service with East Midlands Trains.

In December 2007, First Great Western received an additional Class 153 from Arriva Trains Wales, bringing its total to 12. This unit arrived in the blue with gold star livery of former operator First North Western.

For summer 2011, two London Midland Class 153s were allocated to the South West for strengthening purposes, based at Exeter TMD for the duration. This allocation was eventually made permanent as a result of London Midland keeping three Class 150 units after the new Class 172s entered service. This brought First Great Western&#x27;s number of Class 153 units up to 14.

Nine of those 14 units later left the fleet, with the remaining five moving to Transport for Wales in April 2019 after being displaced by internal cascading.

====East Anglia====
Anglia Railways inherited a small fleet of seven units, for local services in Suffolk and Norfolk. Services operated by these units included Ipswich to Cambridge, Peterborough, Felixstowe and Lowestoft, and Norwich to Lowestoft, Great Yarmouth and Cromer. One set was also hired to First Great Eastern for use on the Gainsborough line.

In 2004, Anglia Railways became part of the Greater Anglia franchise operated by One which was subsequently renamed National Express East Anglia. Two units left the franchise to East Midlands Trains. During 2012, Porterbrook began refurbishing the body and interiors and repainting them in base white with red doors and Greater Anglia logos.

In 2014, a rolling refurbishment of Abellio Greater Anglia&#x27;s Class 153s commenced, which included new interior panels, tables, carpets and lighting. All were replaced by Class 755s in late 2019. These then moved to Transport for Wales in December 2019 to cover for delays with its new rolling stock.

==== West Midlands ====
West Midlands Trains used eight Class 153 DMUs on commuter lines in the West Midlands including the Leamington Spa to Nuneaton line and the Marston Vale line between Bedford and Bletchley. After from London Overground and s&#x27; deployment on those two lines, they were used with s and s on Birmingham-Hereford and Snow Hill Lines.

All eight were inherited from Central Trains in their livery. All were repainted into London Midland city lines livery upon refurbishment at Eastleigh Works. The Class 153s that were used on the Stourbridge Town branch line have been replaced by new built lightweight railcars. This was due to take place in December 2008, but the delivery of the new units was delayed, and after several months of bustitution London Midland reintroduced diesel services from 15 March pending the completion of Class 139 testing. The Class 139 received passenger certification from Network Rail in March 2009 and the service finally began three months later. In December 2020 the final Class 153s were withdrawn from service and put into long-term storage. Before withdrawal, they mostly operated on the Birmingham-Hereford line.

====East Midlands====

East Midlands Trains inherited many examples of Class 153 units, receiving six from Central Trains, three from National Express East Anglia and four former First Great Western units that had been stored at Eastleigh Works. In December 2007, East Midlands Trains received two from Arriva Trains Wales and two from Northern Rail. All passed with the East Midlands franchise to East Midlands Railway in August 2019. In January 2020, four were transferred to Transport for Wales. At one point in April 2020, only three EMR Class 153s were in service, following the implementation of an emergency timetable due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with all others being stored out of use as surplus to requirement. Two more returned to services by July 2020, while five others (153302, 153318, 153368, 153372, 153374, and 153382) had their leases terminated.

All of the East Midlands Trains Class 153 units were repainted into the company&#x27;s local lines livery.

In July 2010, the first unit 153319 entered Neville Hill TMD for a C6 refresh programme. The work included corrosion repair, internal refresh and a cab refurbishment programme.

East Midlands Railway&#x27;s fleet of Class 153s were used on rural routes:

*Nottingham to Worksop (one diagram used two units)
*Nottingham to Matlock via Derby
*Nottingham to Skegness
*Leicester to Lincoln
*Peterborough to Lincoln and Doncaster
*Newark North Gate to Grimsby Town (to Cleethorpes after 1900 and during summer)
*Derby to Crewe via Stoke-on-Trent
*Cleethorpes to Barton-on-Humber
The last of the East Midlands Railway Class 153s were withdrawn in December 2021, as they were not compliant with the Persons with Reduced Mobility Technical Specification for Interoperability (PRM-TSI) regulations. Class 156 units replaced them on the Barton-on-Humber route from 13 December.

==== Northern England ====

The Northern Rail franchise started operations in December 2004. It inherited the fleets previously operated by Arriva Trains Northern (ATN) and First North Western (FNW), whose routes the new franchise incorporated. Northern Rail&#x27;s successor Arriva Rail North at one point operated the largest fleet of Class 153 units.

Northern Rail inherited a fleet of eight units from FNW, which were used on local services around Manchester and and on and to and to services. The fleet was repainted in the now obsolete North Western Trains blue and gold livery. Prior to becoming part of Northern Rail, four former FNW units were transferred to the Arriva Trains Wales franchise, since the lines operated by FNW in Wales were transferred to this new company.

A larger fleet of 12 units was inherited from ATN. They are used on various local services around , and . One regular job is the to services, which see a unit stabled at Cleethorpes overnight and Sunday. Other jobs are the to via Retford and Sheffield, and the Saturday-only Sheffield to Cleethorpes via Retford.

In December 2007, two units were taken off lease from Northern Rail and transferred to East Midlands Trains.

In the first half of 2018, five units were transferred from Great Western Railway on a temporary basis to boost capacity until the new Class 195 units entered service; three of these then moved to Abellio ScotRail in 2019, with the remainder following in 2020. On 1 March 2020, Arriva Rail North&#x27;s Class 153 units transferred to new operator Northern Trains.

All Northern Trains Class 153s were sent to storage at Ely Potter Papworth Terminal by December 2021.

==Preservation and further use==
The stripped out bodyshell of unit 153374 has been donated to the Llanelli and Mynydd Mawr Railway, for static use as a community cafe, at Cynheidre.

Two Class 153s have been bought by Great Central Railway, primarily for use in training staff from East Midlands Railway and CrossCountry.

In 2024 Go-op Co-operative Ltd. received approval from the ORR to run services between Swindon, Taunton and Weston-super-Mare under an open-access agreement using refurbished Class 153 units.

==Models==
When the units were first introduced, Hurst models produced a detailing kit to convert a Dapol model of a 155 into a 153.

The Class 153 has been produced in OO gauge by Hornby in Central Trains, First North Western, Abellio Greater Anglia, Northern Rail, Regional Railways, East Midlands Trains, London Midland City, Arriva Trains Wales, and Great Scenic Railways of Devon and Cornwall (Wessex Trains) liveries. These models have been praised for their detail.

Dapol announced a British N gauge model of the Class 153 in October 2008. The model debuted at the Warley National Model Railway Exhibition in November 2009. In 2010, Dapol issued their model in &quot;St Ives Bay Line&quot; advertising livery.

Several 153s have also been produced for rail simulators. Making Tracks have a digital model available for the PC railway simulator Microsoft Train Simulator, whilst Just Trains has released the model for Railworks.

<doc id="1017886" wikidata="Q1251847" url="?curid=1017886" title="Phosphofructokinase deficiency">
<text>Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a rare muscular metabolic disorder, with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. It is characterized as a deficiency in the Phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme throughout the body, including the skeletal muscles and red blood cells. Phosphofrucotkinase is an enzyme involved in the glycolytic process. The lack of PFK blocks the completion of the glycolytic pathway. Therefore, all products past the block would be deficient, including Adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

It may affect humans as well as other mammals (especially dogs). It was named after the Japanese physician Seiichiro Tarui (b. 1927), who first observed the condition in 1965.

==Presentation==

===In humans===
Human PFK deficiency is categorized into four types: classic, late-onset, infantile and hemolytic. These types are differentiated by age at which symptoms are observed and which symptoms present.

====Classic form====
Classic phosphofructokinase deficiency is the most common type of this disorder. This type presents with exercise-induced muscle cramps and weakness (sometimes rhabdomyolysis), myoglobinuria, as well as with haemolytic anaemia causing dark urine a few hours later.
Hyperuricemia is common, due to the kidneys&#x27; inability to process uric acid following damage resulting from processing myoglobin. Nausea and vomiting following strenuous exercise is another common indicator of classic PFK deficiency. Many patients will also display high levels of bilirubin, which can lead to a jaundiced appearance. Symptoms for this type of PFK deficiency usually appear in early childhood.

====Late-onset form====
Late-onset PFK deficiency, as the name suggests, is a form of the disease that presents later in life. Common symptoms associated with late-onset phosphofructokinase deficiency are myopathy, weakness and fatigue. Many of the more severe symptoms found in the classic type of this disease are absent in the late-onset form.

====Infantile form====
Phosphofructokinase deficiency also presents in a rare infantile form. Infants with this deficiency often display floppy infant syndrome (hypotonia), arthrogryposis, encephalopathy and cardiomyopathy. The disorder can also manifest itself in the central nervous system, usually in the form of seizures. PFK deficient infants also often have some type of respiratory issue. Survival rate for the infantile form of PFK deficiency is low, and the cause of death is often due to respiratory failure.

====Hemolytic form====
The defining characteristic of this form of the disorder is hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells break down prematurely. Muscle weakness and pain are not as common in patients with hemolytic PFK deficiency.

===In dogs===
Presentation of the canine form of the disease is similar to that of the human form. Most notably, PFK deficient dogs have mild, but persistent, anemia with hemolytic episodes, exercise intolerance, hemoglobinuria, and pale or jaundiced mucous membranes. Muscle weakness and cramping are not uncommon symptoms, but they are not as common as they are in human PFKM deficiency.

==Risk factors==

===In humans===
In order to get Tarui&#x27;s disease, both parents must be carriers of the genetic defect so that the child is born with the full form of the recessive trait. The best indicator of risk is a family member with PFK deficiency.

===In dogs===
Canine phosphofructokinase deficiency is found mostly in English Springer Spaniels and American Cocker Spaniels, but has also been reported in Whippets and Wachtelhunds. Mixed-breed dogs descended from any of these breeds are also at risk to inherit PFK deficiency.

==Pathophysiology==
Phosphofructokinase is a tetrameric enzyme that consists of three types of subunits: PFKL (liver), PFKM (muscle), and PFKP (platelet). The combination of these subunits varies depending on the tissue in question. In this condition, a deficiency of the M subunit (PFKM) of the phosphofructokinase enzyme impairs the ability of cells such as erythrocytes and rhabdomyocytes (skeletal muscle cells) to use carbohydrates (such as glucose) for energy. Unlike most other glycogen storage diseases, it directly affects glycolysis.
The mutation impairs the ability of phosphofructokinase to phosphorylate fructose-6-phosphate prior to its cleavage into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate which is the rate limiting step in the glycolysis pathway. Inhibition of this step prevents the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which results in a lack of available energy for muscles during heavy exercise. This results in the muscle cramping and pain that are common symptoms of the disease.

===In humans===
Genetic mutation is the cause of phosphofructokinase deficiency. Several different mutations in the gene that encodes for PFKM have been reported in humans, but the result is production of PFKM subunits with little to no function. As a result, affected individuals display only about 50–65% of total normal phosphofructokinase enzyme function.

===In dogs===
PFK deficiency is believed to be the result of a nonsense mutation in the gene that encodes for PFKM. This results in an unstable, truncated protein that lacks normal function. This results in a near complete loss of PFKM activity in the skeletal muscle. Dogs with the mutation display 10–20% of normal PFK activity in their erythrocytes, due to a higher proportion of PFKM in those cells.

==Diagnosis==
Symptoms of phosphofructokinase deficiency can closely resemble those of other metabolic diseases, include deficiencies of phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, lactate dehydrogenase, beta-enolase and aldolase A. Thus, proper diagnosis is important to determine a treatment plan.
A diagnosis can be made through a muscle biopsy that shows excess glycogen accumulation. Glycogen deposits in the muscle are a result of the interruption of normal glucose breakdown that regulates the breakdown of glycogen. Blood tests are conducted to measure the activity of phosphofructokinase, which would be lower in a patient with this condition. Patients also commonly display elevated levels of creatine kinase.

==Management==
Treatment usually entails that the patient refrain from strenuous exercise to prevent muscle pain and cramping. Avoiding carbohydrates is also recommended.

A ketogenic diet also improved the symptoms of an infant with PFK deficiency. The logic behind this treatment is that the low-carb high fat diet forces the body to use fatty acids as a primary energy source instead of glucose. This bypasses the enzymatic defect in glycolysis, lessening the impact of the mutated PFKM enzymes. This has not been widely studied enough to prove if it is a viable treatment, but testing is continuing to explore this option.

Genetic testing to determine whether or not a person is a carrier of the mutated gene is also available.

Mitapivat (brand name Pyrukynd) may improve symptoms by stimulating pyruvate kinase, another enzyme in the glycolytic pathway.

==In dogs==
Diagnosis of canine phosphofructokinase deficiency is similar to the blood tests used in diagnosis of humans. Blood tests measuring the total erythrocyte PFK activity are used for definitive diagnosis in most cases. DNA testing for presence of the condition is also available.

Treatment mostly takes the form of supportive care. Owners are advised to keep their dogs out of stressful or exciting situations, avoid high temperature environments and strenuous exercise. It is also important for the owner to be alert for any signs of a hemolytic episode. Dogs carrying the mutated form of the gene should be removed from the breeding population, in order to reduce incidence of the condition.

For 2024, &quot;Newsweek&quot; placed MD Anderson at #1 in their annual list of the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Specialized Hospitals&quot; in oncology.

==History==
The cancer center is named after Monroe Dunaway Anderson, who feared that in the event of one of the partners&#x27; deaths, his company would lose a large amount of money to estate tax and be forced to dissolve. To avoid this, Anderson created the MD Anderson Foundation with an initial sum of $300,000. In 1939, after Anderson&#x27;s death, the foundation received $19 million.

In 1941, the Texas Legislature had appropriated $500,000 to build a cancer hospital and research center. The Anderson Foundation agreed to match funds with the state if the hospital were located in Houston in the Texas Medical Center (another project of the Anderson Foundation) and named after Anderson.

Since 1945 the Texas Medical Center was formed largely due to the efforts of the M.D. Anderson Foundation, which provided significant financial support and land. This initiative, coupled with the establishment of the M.D. Anderson Hospital for Cancer Research, laid the groundwork for what would become the largest medical center in the world.

Using surplus World War II Army barracks, the hospital operated for 10 years from a converted residence and 46 beds leased in a Houston hospital before moving to its current location in Texas Medical Center in 1954. This move allowed for significant expansion and the development of state-of-the-art facilities. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the center continued to expand its research capabilities and patient care services.

In 2015, the university was placed on a censure list issued by the American Association of University Professors for denying tenure to two professors. As part of the investigative process, the university questioned the AAUP&#x27;s credentials and their ability to adjudicate tenure disputes.

==Organization==

<doc id="1017889" wikidata="Q3043149" url="?curid=1017889" title="Pyruvate kinase deficiency">
<text>Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder of the enzyme pyruvate kinase which affects the survival of red blood cells. Both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance have been observed with the disorder; classically, and more commonly, the inheritance is autosomal recessive. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is the second most common cause of enzyme-deficient hemolytic anemia, following G6PD deficiency.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms can be extremely varied among those suffering from pyruvate kinase deficiency. The majority of those suffering from the disease are detected at birth while some only present symptoms during times of great physiological stress such as pregnancy, or with acute illnesses (viral disorders). Symptoms are limited to or most severe during childhood. Among the symptoms of pyruvate kinase deficiency are:
* Mild to severe hemolytic anemia
* Cholecystolithiasis
* Tachycardia
* Hemochromatosis
* Icteric sclera
* Splenomegaly
* Leg ulcers
* Jaundice
* Fatigue
* Shortness of breath

The level of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is elevated: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate which is the substrate for Pyruvate kinase, is increased and so the Luebering-Rapoport pathway is overactivated. This led to a rightward shift in the oxygen dissociation curve of hemoglobin (i.e. it decreases the hemoglobin affinity for oxygen): In consequence, patients may tolerate anemia surprisingly well.

==Cause==
Pyruvate kinase deficiency is due to a mutation in the PKLR gene. There are four pyruvate kinase isoenzymes, two of which are encoded by the PKLR gene (isoenzymes L and R, which are used in the liver and erythrocytes, respectively). Mutations in the PKLR gene therefore cause a deficiency in the pyruvate kinase enzyme.

180 different mutations have been found on the gene coding for the L and R isoenzymes, 124 of which are single-nucleotide missense mutations. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is most commonly an autosomal recessive trait. Although it is mostly homozygotes that demonstrate symptoms of the disorder, compound heterozygotes can also show clinical signs.

==Pathophysiology==

Pyruvate kinase is the last enzyme involved in the glycolytic process, transferring the phosphate group from phosphenol pyruvate to a waiting adenosine diphosphate (ADP) molecule, resulting in both adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and pyruvate. This is the second ATP producing step of the process and the third regulatory reaction. Pyruvate kinase deficiency in the red blood cells results in an inadequate amount of or complete lack of the enzyme, blocking the completion of the glycolytic pathway. Therefore, all products past the block would be deficient in the red blood cell. These products include ATP and pyruvate.

Mature erythrocytes lack a nucleus and mitochondria. Without a nucleus, they lack the ability to synthesize new proteins so if anything happens to their pyruvate kinase, they are unable to generate replacement enzymes throughout the rest of their life cycle. Without mitochondria, erythrocytes are heavily dependent on the anaerobic generation of ATP during glycolysis for nearly all of their energy requirements.

With insufficient ATP in an erythrocyte, all active processes in the cell come to a halt. Sodium potassium ATPase pumps are the first to stop. Since the cell membrane is more permeable to potassium than sodium, potassium leaks out. Intracellular fluid becomes hypotonic, water moves down its concentration gradient out of the cell. The cell shrinks and cellular death occurs, this is called &#x27;dehydration at cellular level&#x27;. This is how a deficiency in pyruvate kinase results in hemolytic anaemia, the body is deficient in red blood cells as they are destroyed by lack of ATP at a larger rate than they are being created.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency can be done by full blood counts (differential blood counts) and reticulocyte counts. Other methods include direct enzyme assays, which can determine pyruvate kinase levels in erythrocytes separated by density centrifugation, as well as direct DNA sequencing. For the most part when dealing with pyruvate kinase deficiency, these two diagnostic techniques are complementary to each other as they both contain their own flaws. Direct enzyme assays can diagnose the disorder and molecular testing confirms the diagnosis or vice versa. Furthermore, tests to determine bile salts (bilirubin) can be used to see whether the gall bladder has been compromised.

==Treatment==
Most affected individuals with pyruvate kinase deficiency do not require treatment. Those individuals who are more severely affected may die in utero of anemia or may require intensive treatment. With these severe cases of pyruvate kinase deficiency in red blood cells, treatment is the only option, there is no cure. However, treatment is usually effective in reducing the severity of the symptoms.

The most common treatment is blood transfusions, especially in infants and young children. This is done if the red blood cell count has fallen to a critical level. The transplantation of bone marrow has also been conducted as a treatment option.

There is a natural way the body tries to treat this disease. It increases the erythrocyte production (reticulocytosis) because reticulocytes are immature red blood cells that still contain mitochondria and so can produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, a treatment option in extremely severe cases is to perform a splenectomy. This does not stop the destruction of erythrocytes but it does help increase the amount of reticulocytes in the body since most of the hemolysis occurs when the reticulocytes are trapped in the hypoxic environment of the spleen. This reduces severe anemia and the need for blood transfusions.

Mitapivat was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2022.

==Epidemiology==

Pyruvate kinase deficiency happens worldwide, however northern Europe, and Japan have many cases. The prevalence of pyruvate kinase deficiency is around 51 cases per million in the population (via gene frequency).

== Other animals ==
In addition to humans, several other animals are known to be susceptible to pyruvate kinase deficiency, including dogs and cats.

<doc id="1017894" wikidata="Q110915991" url="?curid=1017894" title="Governor-General of Solomon Islands">
<text>The governor-general of Solomon Islands is the representative of the Solomon Islands&#x27; monarch, currently King Charles III, in Solomon Islands. The governor-general is appointed by the monarch after their nomination by the National Parliament by vote. The functions of the governor-general include appointing ministers, judges, and ambassadors; giving royal assent to legislation passed by parliament; and issuing writs for election.

In general, the governor-general observes the conventions of the Westminster system and responsible government, maintaining a political neutrality, and has to always act only on the advice of the prime minister. The governor-general also has a ceremonial role: hosting events at the official residenceGovernment House in the capital, Honiaraand bestowing honours to individuals and groups who are contributing to Solomon Islands and their communities. When travelling abroad, the governor-general is seen as the representative of Solomon Islands and its monarch.

Governors-general are appointed for a five-year term of office. Since 7 July 2024, the governor-general has been Reverend David Tiva Kapu.

The office of the governor-general was created on 7 July 1978, when Solomon Islands gained independence from the United Kingdom as a sovereign state and an independent constitutional monarchy. Since then, eight individuals have served as governor-general.

==Appointment==
Unlike most other Commonwealth realms, the governor-general of Solomon Islands is nominated by the country&#x27;s Parliament, rather than being proposed by its prime minister (as is the convention in the other Commonwealth realms). The appointment is made by the monarch of Solomon Islands following a simple majority vote of the National Parliament. Section 27 of the Constitution of Solomon Islands provides that:

There shall be a Governor-General of Solomon Islands who shall be appointed by the Head of State in accordance with an address from Parliament and who shall be the representative of the Head of State in Solomon Islands.

The term of office is five years, and is renewable once.

===Oath of office===
The oath of office of the governor-general is:

==Dismissal==
The governor-general may be dismissed by the monarch for &quot;for misbehaviour or for such other cause as may be prescribed by Parliament&quot;, after an address from Parliament supported by at least two-thirds majority of all members of parliament.

If the office of governor-general becomes vacant, due to death or dismissal, the speaker of the National Parliament of Solomon Islands becomes acting governor-general until a new appointment is made. If the office of Speaker is vacant or unable to perform those functions, then the vice-regal duties are carried out by the Chief Justice.

==Functions==
Solomon Islands shares the person of the sovereign equally with 14 other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations. As the sovereign works and resides outside of Solomon Islands&#x27; borders, the governor-general&#x27;s primary task is to perform the monarch&#x27;s constitutional duties on his or her behalf. As such, the governor-general carries out his or her functions in the government of Solomon Islands on behalf and in the name of the Sovereign.

The governor-general&#x27;s powers and roles are derive from the Constitution of Solomon Islands Part IV Sections 27, 28 &amp; 29, and set out certain provisions relating to the governor-general.

===Constitutional role===
The governor-general is responsible for early dissolutions of parliament, which may occur upon the resolution of an absolute majority of members of parliament. Parliamentary terms otherwise run for four years. The governor-general is responsible for appointing the date of the general election, which must occur within four months of the dissolution of parliament. After an election, the governor-general convenes a meeting of parliament to elect the prime minister in accordance with section 33 of the constitution. Once a prime minister is elected, the governor-general appoints the other ministers on the prime minister&#x27;s advice.

The prime minister keeps the governor-general fully informed concerning the general conduct of the government of Solomon Islands and furnishes the governor-general with such information as the governor-general may request with respect to any particular matter relating to the government of Solomon Islands.

The governor-general, on the Sovereign&#x27;s behalf, gives royal assent to laws passed by the National Parliament of Solomon Islands.

The governor-general acts on the advice of the Cabinet, to issue regulations, proclamations under existing laws, to appoint state judges, ambassadors and high commissioners to overseas countries, and other senior government officials.

The governor-general is also responsible for issuing Royal Commissions of Inquiry, and other matters, as required by particular legislation; and authorises many other executive decisions by ministers such as approving treaties with foreign governments.

The prime minister can be removed from office by the governor-general upon the passage of a no-confidence motion by an absolute majority of the members of parliament. The outgoing prime minister remains in office until a new prime minister is elected by the national parliament. In the event of the prime minister&#x27;s death in office, the governor-general &quot;after consultation with the other Ministers&quot; appoints one of the other government ministers to act as a prime minister until a new election is held.

===Ceremonial role===
The governor-general&#x27;s ceremonial duties include opening new sessions of parliament by delivering the Speech from the Throne, welcoming visiting heads of state, and receiving the credentials of foreign diplomats.

The governor-general also presents honours at investitures to Solomon Islanders for notable service to the community, or for acts of bravery.

===Community role===
The governor-general provides non-partisan leadership in the community, acting as patron of charitable, service, sporting and cultural organisations, and attending functions throughout the country.

The governor-general also encourages, articulates and represents those things that unite Solomon Islanders together.

==Privileges==
===Salary===
The governor-general receives an annual salary of 130,000 SBD.

Former governors-general receive a pension set at sixty per cent of the incumbent governor-general&#x27;s salary.

===Symbols===
The governor-general uses a personal flag, which features a lion passant atop a St. Edward&#x27;s royal crown with &quot;Solomon Islands&quot; written on a two-headed frigatebird, all on a blue background. It is flown on buildings and other locations in Solomon Islands to mark the governor-general&#x27;s presence.

===Residence===
Government House in Honiara is the official residence of the governor-general of Solomon Islands.

Upon retirement, governors-general are provided with an official residence free of rent and the cost of water, gas, and electricity is paid for by the government.

<doc id="1017899" wikidata="Q1515419" url="?curid=1017899" title="Crop (implement)">
<text>A crop, sometimes called a riding crop or hunting crop, is a short type of whip without a lash, used in horse riding, part of the family of tools known as riding aids. This can also be commonly used in abusive ways, but used correctly can have good outcomes for both the rider and horse.

==Types and uses==
A modern crop usually consists of a long shaft of fiberglass or cane which is covered in leather, fabric, or similar material. The rod of a crop thickens at one end to form a handle, and terminates in a thin, flexible tress such as wound cord or a leather tongue, known as a keeper. The thin end is intended to make contact with the horse, whilst the keeper prevents the horse&#x27;s skin from being marked. The handle may have a loop of leather to help secure the grip or a &quot;mushroom&quot; on the end to prevent it from slipping through the rider&#x27;s hand.

The length of a crop is designed to allow enough leverage for it to be accelerated rapidly with a controlled flick of the wrist, without causing the rider balancing problems. Thus, a true crop is relatively short.

The term &quot;whip&quot; is a more common term that includes both riding crops as well as longer types of horse whips used for both riding and ground work. A whip is a little slower than a crop, mostly due to having slightly greater length and flexibility.
===In equestrianism===
Crops are principally designed to back up the natural aids (leg, seat and voice) of a rider.
The crop should not be used as punishment, where the animal fails to perform a wanted behaviour and as such is hit. Positive Punishment (+P) is the term used for the adding of an unpleasant stimulus for the performance or non performance of a behaviour. Not only has it been shown to be unsuccessful in training the horse, it also has serious implications for animal welfare, and the development of learned helplessness.
*&quot;Dressage whip&quot; is a true whip, longer than a crop, (up to , including lash or popper) for horse training, allowing a rider to touch the mount&#x27;s side while keeping both hands on the reins.
&quot;Hunting whips&quot; are not for use on the horse, but have a &quot;hook&quot; at the end to use in opening and shutting gates without dismounting, as well as a long leather thong to keep the hounds from coming near the horse&#x27;s legs, and possibly getting kicked.

===Other uses===
====Weapon====
Crops can be carried as a weapon. In the Sherlock Holmes series of novels and short stories, Holmes is occasionally said to carry one as his favourite weapon (e.g., &quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons&quot;). Specifically, it is a &quot;loaded&quot; hunting crop. Such crops were sold at one time. Loading refers to the practice of filling the shaft and head with a heavy metal (e.g., steel, lead) to provide some heft.

====BDSM====
Crops are sometimes used in BDSM as part of impact play. Art deco sculptor Bruno Zach produced perhaps his best known sculpture—called &quot;The Riding Crop&quot; (c. 1925)—which features a scantily clad dominatrix wielding a crop.

<doc id="1017902" wikidata="Q4707539" url="?curid=1017902" title="Alan Pope">
<text>Alan William Pope (August 2, 1945 – July 8, 2022) was a Canadian politician. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1977 to 1990, and served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Bill Davis and Frank Miller.

==Early years==
Pope was raised in Northern Ontario, and was educated at Waterloo Lutheran University and Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto. He worked as a lawyer before entering politics. Pope served as an alderman for Timmins City Council from 1973 to 1974.

==Provincial politics==
In the 1975 provincial election, he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the riding of Cochrane South but lost to Bill Ferrier of the NDP by 1,292 votes. He ran again in the 1977 provincial election, this time defeating Ferrier by 2,276 votes.

He was appointed a parliamentary assistant in Davis&#x27;s government in 1978, and was promoted to Minister without portfolio on August 30, 1979. He faced a minor controversy in 1979, when Ed Deibel, the leader of the small Northern Ontario Heritage Party, publicly claimed that Pope had promised to cross the floor to join the party, which Pope denied.

He was re-elected in the 1981 provincial election. Pope was promoted to Minister of Natural Resources on April 10, 1981. He served in that position for the remainder of the Davis administration&#x27;s time in office. Responding to a report on the state of the province&#x27;s provincial park system, Pope promised a significant increase in the number of parks. However, he refused to prohibit mining, hunting, and fishing within park grounds. In 1982, after a dispute over wild rice harvesting on Mud Lake, Pope ruled that traditional native harvesting rights would be upheld and that the ministry would not allow commercial harvesting to proceed.

===Political views===
Pope&#x27;s position in the Progressive Conservative Party was unusual. He supported the interventionist policies of the Davis government and was sometimes considered to be on the progressive wing of the party. However, he was not a Red Tory and did not support the party&#x27;s Toronto-based establishment (commonly known as the &quot;Big Blue Machine&quot;). Pope was rather a populist, who sought greater power for the party&#x27;s neglected local branches in northern, eastern, and southwestern Ontario. In that sense, his position in the provincial Progressive Conservatives was similar to John Diefenbaker&#x27;s role in the federal party a generation earlier.

===Support for Frank Miller===
In 1985, Pope was a prominent figure behind Frank Miller&#x27;s campaign to succeed Davis as party leader. Some regarded his presence in Miller&#x27;s camp as unusual since Miller&#x27;s supporters tended to be older figures from the party&#x27;s right wing. Pope nonetheless proved an effective campaigner for Miller by compiling much-needed polling data and devising strategies for Miller&#x27;s supporters at the party convention. One strategy was to have some of Miller&#x27;s delegates vote for the progressive Larry Grossman on the second ballot, which resulted in the narrow elimination of the centrist Dennis Timbrell (that was considered strategic voting as Timbrell was considered a greater threat than Grossman). Miller narrowly defeated Grossman on the third ballot to become party leader, and Pope was promoted to Minister of Health on February 8, 1985.

It was under Miller&#x27;s leadership, however, that the Progressive Conservative Party lost its 42-year grip on power. Miller was reduced to a fragile minority government in the 1985 provincial election and proved unable to sustain his party in power. Pope was named Attorney General of Ontario in a post-election shuffle on May 17, 1985, but did little of significance before Miller&#x27;s government was defeated on a motion of non-confidence in the house by the Liberals and the NDP. He resigned his portfolio on June 26, 1985, and moved into the opposition benches.

===Leadership campaign===
Pope ran to succeed Miller as leader in the November 1985 Progressive Conservative leadership convention. His campaign was weaker than expected, however, as many considered Miller&#x27;s rightward shift a key factor in the party losing power. Furthermore, one of his campaign staff was caught polling party members as to whether religion would make a difference in the leadership race, which was seen by some as a reference to Larry Grossman&#x27;s Jewish background, and Pope made a public apology. Pope also broke with John Thompson, his first campaign manager, fairly early in the race.

At the November leadership convention, Pope made a dramatic entrance by delivering a rousing speech surrounded by his &quot;grassroots&quot; delegates on the convention floor, rather than from the podium. That foreshadowed future leadership speeches by figures such as Jim Flaherty. Pope also tried to portray himself as a unifying figure in the party and noted that the animosity between frontrunners Grossman and Dennis Timbrell was threatening to tear the party asunder (one of his campaign buttons read, &quot;Don&#x27;t take sides, take Pope&quot;.) In spite of such efforts, he finished a weak third on the first ballot and was dropped from the race. Many expected that Pope would have given Timbrell a second-ballot victory by endorsing him, but Pope surprisingly remained silent and allowed Grossman to defeat Timbrell by a mere 19 votes.

===Last years in legislature===
Pope had a poor relationship with Grossman, was not given a critic&#x27;s portfolio after the convention. He resumed his law practice in Timmins while still an MPP, and he spent two days a week away from the legislature. He nonetheless ran for re-election in the 1987 provincial election and retained his seat. The Progressive Conservatives under Grossman were resoundingly defeated in the election, which left Pope as one of only 16 Tory MPPs (out of 130 seats) remaining.

Pope was not given a critic&#x27;s portfolio in this parliament and did not play a prominent role in the party&#x27;s affairs. He decided not to run for the leadership again in 1990 and endorsed Dianne Cunningham for the position. He did not campaign in the 1990 provincial election.

===Cabinet positions===


===Pope and Mike Harris===
Although Pope&#x27;s anti-establishment rhetoric and populism foreshadowed Mike Harris&#x27;s tenure as party leader, the two men were frequent adversaries in the Progressive Conservative Party after 1985. In 1997, Pope made headlines when he publicly criticized Premier Harris and accused the government of demonizing teachers and supporting the teachers&#x27; strike against Harris&#x27;s Bill 160 (the &quot;Education Quality Improvement Act&quot;), which removed the ability of collective bargaining agreements to regulate working conditions for teachers, introduced teacher testing, and allowed the government to increase class sizes and reduce preparation time.

==Later years==

In 2004, Pope chaired a committee looking into Timmins&#x27;s involvement in the 2006 Ontario Games. As of 2003, he acted as counsel for the law firm of Racicot, Maisonneuve, Labelle, Gosselin. He wrote a series of articles on the 2004 federal election for the &quot;Sudbury Star&quot; newspaper, arguing that no party was adequately focused on issues of concern to Northern Ontario.

In 2006, Pope wrote a report on the Kashechewan Crisis, recommending that residents of the community be relocated to a new reserve site near Timmins.

He was married to Linda Fillion-Pope and they have one son, David and his wife Kirstin Danielson have two children Beatrice and Theodore Pope. He also has a daughter

Pope died on July 8, 2022, in Calgary, Alberta following heart surgery.

<text>The Heliodorus pillar is a stone column that was erected around 113 BCE in central India in Besnagar (Vidisha), Madhya Pradesh. The pillar is commonly named after Heliodorus (identified by him as a Garuda-standard), who was an ambassador of the Indo-Greek king Antialcidas from Taxila, and was sent to the Indian ruler Bhagabhadra. A dedication written in Brahmi script was inscribed on the pillar, venerating Vāsudeva (Krishna), the &quot;Deva deva&quot; the &quot;God of Gods&quot; and the Supreme Deity. The pillar also glorifies the Indian ruler as &quot;Bhagabhadra the savior&quot;. The pillar is a stambha which symbolizes joining earth, space and heaven, and is thought to connote the &quot;cosmic axis&quot; and express the cosmic totality of the Deity.

The Heliodorus pillar site is located near the confluence of two rivers, about northeast from Bhopal, from the Buddhist stupa of Sanchi, and from the Hindu Udayagiri site.

The pillar was discovered by Alexander Cunningham in 1877. Two major archaeological excavations in the 20th-century have revealed the pillar to be a part of an ancient Vāsudeva temple site. Aside from religious scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita, the epigraphical inscriptions on the Heliodorus pillar and the Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions contain some of the earliest known writings of Vāsudeva-Krishna devotion and early Vaishnavism and are considered the first archeological evidence of its existence. The pillar has been called one of the earliest surviving records of a foreign convert into Vaishnavism. An alternative interpretation is that making dedications to foreign gods was only a logical practice for the Greeks, intended to appropriate their local power and cannot be regarded as a &quot;conversion&quot; to Hinduism.

The pillar was first discovered by Alexander Cunningham in 1877 near the ancient city of Besnagar in neighbourhood of Vidisha in central India. Besnagar was founded near the confluence of Betwa River and Halali River (formerly, Bais River and the basis for &quot;Bes&quot;-nagar). The fertile region was historically important because it was on the trade route between the northern Gangetic valley, the Deccan and the South Indian kingdoms of the subcontinent. The Besnagar site is at the northeastern periphery of the confluence, and close to Sanchi and Udayagiri, both ancient and of significance to Buddhism and Hinduism.
When Cunningham first saw it, the pillar was thickly encrusted with ritually applied red paste (vermillion). This encrusted pillar was the object of worship and ritual animal sacrifice. Next to the red-colored pillar was a high soil mound, and on top of the mound a priest had built his home and surrounded it with a compound wall. The locals at the time called the pillar the &quot;Khamba Baba&quot; or &quot;Kham Baba&quot;.

Cunningham, an avid British archaeologist credited with many discoveries of ancient sites on the subcontinent, saw no inscription due to the thick crust surrounding the pillar. He nevertheless sensed its historical significance from the shape and the visible features such as the crowning emblem, carved fan, rosettes, the faceted symmetry merging into a round section. He also guessed there may be an inscription below the crust, and reported the pillar as, &quot;the most curious and novel&quot; of all his discoveries. Near the standing Besnagar pillar, Cunningham found the remains of a fan-palm pinnacle, which he thought originally belonged to the pillar. Assuming that this broken part was part of the standing pillar, he sketched a composite version. The fan-palm design is otherwise known to be associated to the worship of Samkarsana-Balarama, another one of the Vrishni heroes.

A short distance away, Cunningham found a second pillar capital on the ground with an emblem in the form of a &quot;makara&quot; (mythical elephant-crocodile-fish composite). He assumed, based on the shape of the bell, which he considered &quot;of true Ashokan proportions&quot;, that this broken part was part of a lost pillar of the Ashokan period. Further, about a kilometer away, Cunningham found a third pillar capital of similar style, with an emblem in the form of a &quot;kalpadruma&quot; (wishing tree). Cunningham assumed this discovery too was related to the Besnagar pillar in some way. The kalpa tree design is otherwise known to be associated to the goddess Sri Lakshmi.

Later research showed that the fan palm pinnacle could not fit, and the discovery of the inscription on the pillar suggested that a Garuda emblem was crowning the structure.

===Second survey in 1909–1910===

Between 1909 and early 1910, nearly 30 years after the pillar&#x27;s discovery, a small Indian and British archaeological team led by H H Lake revisited the site. After the thick red crust was cleaned out, they found Brahmi script inscriptions. John Marshall reported the discovered inscriptions, and to everyone&#x27;s surprise, the longer inscription related to a Greek ambassador named Heliodorus of 2nd-century BCE and the deity Vāsudeva. An additional smaller inscription on the pillar listed human virtues, later identified to be from a verse of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.
The pillar and the unusual inscriptions attracted two larger archaeological excavations. The first was completed between 1913 and 1915, under Bhandarkar, but left incomplete because the priest blocked efforts citing rights to his home and compound walls his ancestors had built over the mound. The second excavation was completed between 1963 and 1965, under Khare, who had convinced the locals to move their religious practice to a location near a tree close by and relocating the priest&#x27;s family. The archaeologists for the second excavation had full access to the Besnagar pillar site.

===Third survey in 1913–1915===

The 1913–15 excavations, though partial, revealed that the modern era Besnagar site had experienced numerous floods that had deposited silt over the last 2,000 years. The partial dig uncovered an extensive rectangular, square and other substructure and many brick foundations aligned to the cardinal axes. More ruined parts, plates and capitals were also found. The relative alignments suggested that the Besnagar pillar was likely a part of a more extensive ancient site.

===Fourth survey in 1963–1965===
The 1963–65 excavations revealed that the mound under the demolished later era priest home, contained the brick foundation for a sanctum (&quot;garbhagriha&quot;) and pillared halls (&quot;mandalas&quot;) of an elliptical temple. Further excavations below the foundation revealed a different foundation of likely a more ancient temple. These ancient temple foundation, layout and structures were similar to those discovered at Chittorgarh (Rajasthan). A more comprehensive excavation underneath the pillar and around the pillar led to the discovery that the pillar itself was much deeper, had a metal-stone interface, features Cunningham&#x27;s early report had missed, and that secondary foundations were added over time to match the new ground level after major floods. Further, many more structures and items were discovered at the site. The archaeologists discovered that the Heliodorus pillar itself was one of eight pillars, all aligned along the north-south axis. These discoveries confirmed that the Besnagar Heliodorus pillar was a part of a more extensive ancient temple site.

==Pillar==
The 1913 excavation revealed that a significant part of the Heliodorus pillar is below the platform. It sits on top of the remains of a more ancient pillar probably damaged by floods. Over time, silt from various floods have deposited and a raised platform was added at some point. The pillar shaft has a base support of two placement stones held with a layer of stone-metal. Above this was an untrimmed stone portion of the pillar. Above the untrimmed section is a trimmed octagonal cross-section. The original ground level was about 4.5 centimeter above the junction of the untrimmed and trimmed section. Above the length with octagonal facet is the section of the pillar with sixteen facets. Above the sixteenths section is the thirty-two faceted section, beyond which is the short round pillar section all the way to the top where sat the crowning emblem (now missing). The pillar is about 17.7 feet above a square platform (12 feet side), and the platform itself is about 3 feet high above the ground. The currently visible portion of the pillar&#x27;s octagonal section is about 4 feet 10 inches high. The sixteenths section is fully visible and is 6 feet 2 inches high. The thirty-twos is also fully visible and is about 11.5 inches high, while the round section is 2 feet and 2 inches high. The bell capital is about 1 feet 6 inches deep and 1 feet 8 inches wide. The abacus is a 1 feet 7 inch sided ornate square.
The ornamental bands on the pillar are at the junctions of the octagon-sixteenths and sixteenths-thirty-seconds sections. The lower ornamental band consists of half-rosettes, while the upper ornamental band is a festoon with birds (swag with flowers, leaves and hanging vines). Early scholars mistook it as geese (or swan), but a closer examination revealed that they are regular pigeon-like birds, not geese (nor swan). The upper festoon is about 6.5 inches long. According to Donald Stadtner, the capitals found at the Heliodorus pillar site are similar, yet different in ways from the Sunga capitals found at Sanchi. The Sanchi discoveries lack the clockwise birds, the &quot;makara&quot; and the band found in Besnagar. They have elephants and lions, which are absent in Besnagar. According to Julia Shaw, the elephants and lions motif is typically found with Buddhist art of this period. The two styles have differences yet informed the other, states Shaw.

The Heliodorus pillar is neither tapered nor polished like the ancient Ashokan pillars found in India. It is also about half the diameter of Ashoka pillars. The Brahmi inscriptions are found on the octagonal surface just below the lower ornamental band of half-rosettes.

The 1963–65 excavations suggest that the site had an elliptical shrine – possibly 4th to 3rd-century BCE – with a brick foundation and likely a wooden superstructure. This was destroyed by a flood around 200 BCE. New soil was then added and the ground level raised to build a new second temple to Vāsudeva, with a wooden pillar (Garuda dhvaja) in front of the east-facing elliptical shrine. This too was destroyed by floods sometime in the 2nd-century BCE. In late 2nd-century BCE, after some ground preparation, yet another Vāsudeva temple was rebuilt, this time with eight stone pillars aligned in the north-south cardinal axis. Only one of these eight pillars have survived: the Heliodorus pillar.

===Inscriptions===
There are two inscriptions on the pillar. The inscriptions have been analysed by several authors, such as E. J. Rapson, Sukthankar, Richard Salomon, and Shane Wallace.

The text of the inscriptions is in the Brahmi script of the Sunga period, the language is Central-western epigraphic Prakrit, with a few Sanskritized spellings. The first inscription describes the private religious dedication of Heliodorus (Translations: Richard Salomon):

The second inscription on the pillar, in the same script, recites a verse from the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;:
The identity of the King Bhagabhadra in the longer inscription is contested. Early scholars proposed that he may have been the 5th ruler of the Sunga dynasty, as described in some Puranic lists. However, later excavations by German archaeologists near Mathura (Sonkh) have shown that the Sunga dynasty may have ended before the Heliodorus pillar was installed. Therefore, it is probable that the Bhagabhadra may have been a local ruler. The virtues in the shorter inscription has been variously translated by different scholars. John Irwin, for example, translates it as &quot;Restraint, Renunciation and Rectitude&quot;.

===Garuda capital===

The Garuda capital of the Heliodorus pillar has not been found in the surveys, but it has been suggested that it had already been excavated by Cunningham, who was unaware of the Garuda attribution of the pillar, and that the remains of this Garuda capital were transferred to the Gwalior Museum together with the other artefacts initially discovered at the site. In particular, a statue fragment in the Gwalior Museum, composed of bird&#x27;s feet holding a Naga, with the tail end resting on a portion of a vedika, may correspond to the lost Garuda capital of the Heliodorus pillar.

According to Susan L. Huntington, the Garuda capital on the Heliodorus pillar was probably similar to a portable Garuda standard illustrated on one of the nearly contemporary reliefs at Bharhut. In Bharhut, a man riding a horse is seen holding a portable pillar-standard, crowned by a bird-man creature similar to a Kinnara. The same concept of Garuda pillar may have been adopted for the Heliodorus pillar. Further, the Bharhut relief was dedicated by an individual from Vidisha, the town where the Heliodorus pillar is located, as explained in the attached dedicatory inscription, which suggests that the Garuda capital in the Bharhut relief may just be an imitation of the one on the Heliodorus pillar. The inscription in Brahmi script next to the relief of the Garuda pillar at Bharhut reads:

====Association with other Vrishni heroes====
Other sculptures and pillar capitals were found near the Heliodorus pillar, and it is thought they were dedicated to Vāsudeva&#x27;s kinsmen, otherwise known as the Vrishni heroes and objects of the Bhagavata worship. These are a &quot;tala&quot; (fan-palm capital), a &quot;makara&quot; (crocodile) capital, a banyan-tree capital, and a possible statue of the goddess Lakshmi, also associated with the Bhagavat worship. Just as Garuda is associated with Vāsudesa, the fan-palm capital is generally associated with Saṃkarṣaṇa, and the &quot;makara&quot; is associated with Pradyumna. The banyan-tree capital with &quot;ashtanidhis&quot; is associated with Lakshmi.

The presence of these pillar capitals, found near the Heliodorus pillar, suggests that the Bhagavata worship, although centered around the figures of Vāsudeva and Saṃkarṣaṇa, may also have involved the worship of other Vrishni deities, such as Pradyumna, son of Vāsudeva. For example, there may have been a Pradyumna temple at Besnagar, or at least the Pradyumna pillar with its &quot;Makara&quot; emblem may have been incorporated into the Vāsudeva shrine. In effect, the findings surrounding the Heliodorus pillar suggest the worship of a trio of the Vrishni heroes in this time and area, composed of the three deities Vāsudesa, Saṃkarṣaṇa and Pradyumna.

Excavations suggests that these various pillars with their symbolic capitals were standing in line at the site, and that the Heliodorus pillar was just one of them, standing at the northern end of the line. Although the pillars are aniconic, it is probable that now lost sculptures representing the deities, broadly similar to the depictions on Vāsudeva and Samkarshana on the coins of Agathocles of Bactria (190–180 BCE), were located in adjoining shrines. An inscription on an octagonal pillar found in nearby Besnagar does mention a &quot;Garudadvaja&quot; installed in a Temple of Vasudeva (&quot;Vasudeva prasadauttama&quot;) by a Gautamiputra Bhagavata, suggesting that there may have been two Garuda pillars, just as there were two fan-palm pillars, in front the Vāsudeva Temple.

====Association with Garuda====
The sun bird Garuda is the traditional vehicle of Vāsudeva. In the Mahabharata (probably compiled between the 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE), Garuda appears as the vehicle of Vishnu.

However, the understanding of Vāsudeva as an emanation of Vishnu probably appeared much later, as there is nothing to suggest it in the early evidence: the worship of Vāsudeva between the 4th century BCE and the 2nd century BCE was a warrior-hero worship, after which the progressive amalgamation with Vishnu and Narayana would follow, developing during the Kushan period and culminating during the Gupta period.

Slightly later, the Nagari inscription also shows the association of the Hindu deity Narayana with Bhagavatism. Vishnu would much later become prominent in this construct, so that by the middle of the 5th century CE, during the Gupta period, the term &quot;Vaishnava&quot; would replace the term &quot;Bhagavata&quot; to describe the followers of this worship, and Vishnu would now be more popular than Vāsudeva.

==Temple==
In 1910, an archaeological team led by H H Lake revisited the Heliodorus pillar site and nearby mounds. They found the Brahmi inscriptions on the pillar, and noticed several mistakes in the early Cunningham report. They also found many other broken wall pieces, pillar sections and broken statues in different mounds along the river, within a kilometer from the pillar. Lake speculated these to be variously related to Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. Near the Heliodorus pillar site, his team discovered Sapta-Matrikas (seven mothers of the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism), dating to the 5th–6th century CE. These discoveries suggest that Besnagar was probably an important ancient temples and pilgrimage site.

The 1963–65 excavations revealed that the Heliodorus pillar was a part of an ancient temple site. The archaeologists found an ancient elliptical foundation, extensive floor and plinth produced from burnt bricks. Further, the foundations for all the major components of a Hindu temple – &quot;garbhagriha&quot; (sanctum), &quot;pradakshinapatha&quot; (circumambulation passage), &quot;antarala&quot; (antechamber next to sanctum) and &quot;mandapa&quot; (gathering hall) – were found. These sections had a thick support base for their walls. These core temple remains cover an area of 30 x 30 m with 2.40 m. The sections had post-holes, which likely contained the wooden pillars for the temple superstructure above. In the soil were iron nails that likely held together the wooden pillars. According to Khare, the superstructure of the temple was likely made of wood, mud and other perishable materials.

The sub-surface structure discovered was nearly identical to the ancient temple complex discovered in Nagari (Chittorgarh, Rajasthan) – about 500 kilometers to the west of Vidisha, and the Nagari temple too has been dated to the second half of the 1st-millennium BCE. The archaeological discoveries about Vāsudeva Krishna at the Mathura site – about 500 kilometers to the north, states Khare, confirm that Garuda, &quot;Makara&quot; found at this site, palm-leaf motifs were related to early Vaishnavism. The Heliodorus pillar was a part of an ancient Vaishnava temple. According to Susan Mishra and Himanshu Ray, the Heliodorus pillar Besnagar site (2nd century BCE) and the Nagari site (1st century BCE) are perhaps the &quot;earliest Hindu temples&quot; that archaeologists have discovered.

==Archaeological characteristics and significance==
The Heliodorus pillar, being dated rather precisely to the period of the reign of Antialkidas (approximately 115–80 BCE), is an essential marker of the evolution of Indian art during the Sunga period. It is, following the Pillars of Ashoka, the next pillar to be associated clearly with a datable inscription. The motifs on the pillar are key in dating some of the architectural elements of the nearby Buddhist complex of Sanchi. For example, the reliefs of Stupa No.2 in Sanchi are dated to the last quarter of the 2nd century BCE due to their similarity with architectural motifs on the Heliodorus pillar as well as similarities of the paleography of the inscriptions. A remaining fragment of the Garuda capital is located at the Gujari Mahal Museum in Gwalior.

===Nature and evolution of Vāsudeva===

Vāsudeva refers to &quot;Krishna, son of Vasudeva&quot;, &quot;Vāsudeva&quot; in the lengthened form being a vṛddhi-derivative of the short form Vasudeva, a type of formation very common in Sanskrit signifying &quot;of, belonging to, descended from&quot;. The worship of Vāsudeva may have evolved from the worship of a historical figure belonging to the Vrishni clan in the region of Mathura. He is also known as a member of the five &quot;Vrishni heroes&quot;. According to Upinder Singh &quot;Vāsudeva-Krishna was the Indian God bearing the closest resemblance to the Greek God Herakles&quot;. He was also depicted on the coinage of Agathocles of Bactria , which shows that he was already widely considered as a deity by that time, and probably as early as the 4th century according to literary evidence. In the Heliodorus pillar, Vāsudeva-Krishna was worshipped as the &quot;God of Gods&quot;, the Supreme Deity. At one point Vāsudeva-Krishna came to be associated to the God Narayana-Vishnu. Epigraphically, this association is confirmed by the Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions of the 1st century BCE. It is thought that &quot;by the beginning of the Christian era, the worship of Vasudeva, Vishnu and Narayana amalgamated&quot;. As a third step, Vāsudeva-Krishna was incorporated into the Chatur-vyūha concept of successive emanations of the God Vishnu. By the 2nd century CE, the &quot;&quot;avatara&quot; concept was in its infancy&quot;, and the depiction of Vishnu with his four emanations (the &quot;Chatur-vyūha&quot;) starts to become visible in art at the end of the Kushan period.

Based on Helliodorus pillar evidence it has been suggested that Heliodorus is one of the earliest Westerners on record to convert to Vaishnavism whose evidence has survived. But some scholars, most notably A. L. Basham and Thomas Hopkins, are of the opinion that Heliodorus was not the earliest Greek to convert to Bhagavata Krishnaism. Hopkins, chairman of the department of religious studies at Franklin and Marshall College, has said, &quot;Heliodorus was presumably not the earliest Greek who was converted to Vaishnava devotional practices although he might have been the one to erect a column that is still extant. Certainly there were numerous others including the king who sent him as an ambassador.&quot; Professor Kunja Govinda Goswami of Calcutta University concludes that Heliodorus &quot;was well acquainted with the texts dealing with the Bhagavata religion.&quot;
According to Indologist Edwin F. Bryant, Heliodorus converted to the Krishna religion during this period. This is evident from the column dedicated to Garuda, Vishnu&#x27;s eagle carrier, which features an inscription where Heliodorus identifies himself as a devotee of Vasudeva Krishna. The fact that a prominent foreign envoy embraced the Krishna tradition in the first century BCE suggests that the tradition had established firm roots by then. Moreover, there are several other inscriptions prior to the Common Era, created by Indian sponsors of the Vasudeva Krishna tradition.

Alternatively, the dedication made by Heliodorus to Vāsudeva as supreme deity may simply have been a diplomatic gesture. This may also have been an instance of a typically Greek religious practice: according to Harry Falk, it was a logical and normal practice for Greeks to make dedications to foreign gods, as they were just interested in appropriating their power, and this natural Greek behaviour cannot be construed as a &quot;conversion to Hinduism&quot;.

===Alternative interpretation===
According to Allan Dahlquist, an alternative interpretation of the inscription is possible. Shakyamuni Buddha too was called a Bhagavan, and Heliodorus originated from Taxila where Buddhism was strong. At the time of Dahlquist&#x27;s 1962 publication, he stated there was no proof that a sect of Vishnu-Krishna devotees existed at that time in Taxila. Lastly, according to Dahlquist, there is no definite evidence that Vāsudeva should necessarily refer to Vishnu-Krishna. As god-of-the-god, Vāsudeva can well be associated with Indra, who had a key role in Buddhism, stated Dahlquist.

Later scholars have questioned Dahlquist&#x27;s analysis and assumptions. Kuiper criticizes him for interpreting the dubious source of Megasthenes, ignoring all the &quot;indications to the contrary&quot;, and dispute Dahlquist&#x27;s treatment of the evidence. The Greek texts that describe ancient India, have numerous references that suggest the existence of Vishnu-Krishna before the time of Heliodorus. For example, there is little doubt that &quot;Methora&quot; in ancient Greek texts is same as Mathura, &quot;Sourasenoi&quot; as Shurasenas, Herakles of India is Hari-Krishna, &quot;Kleisobora&quot; is Krishna-pura. Similarly, early Buddhist sources provide evidence of Krishna worship, such as the &quot;Niddesa&quot; which somewhat derogatorily mentions both Vāsudeva and Baladeva The Jataka tales too include a story about Krishna. Heliodorus converted to the Krishna religion when he was serving as an envoy. The Heliodorus pillar&#x27;s inscription is generally dated to the late 2nd century BCE or about 100 BCE, is attributed to Heliodorus, as recording his devotion to the Vaishnava Vāsudeva sect.

===Related evidence===
During the Besnagar site excavations by archaeologists Lake and Bhandarkar, a number of additional inscriptions were found such as one in Vidisha. These also mention Vaishnava-related terms. In one of those inscriptions, is the mention of another Bhagavata installing a pillar of Garuda (vahana of Vishnu) at the &quot;best temple of Bhagavat&quot; after the king had ruled for twelve years.

A pillar from nearby Buddhist Sanchi, Pillar 25, is thought to be contemporary with the Heliodorus pillar, and is also dated to the 2nd century BCE.

<text>Suzie McConnell-Serio (born July 29, 1966) is a former American women&#x27;s basketball coach and player. She was the head coach for the women&#x27;s basketball team at the University of Pittsburgh from 2013 to 2018. In 2004, she was named WNBA Coach of the Year as coach of the Minnesota Lynx. She was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Career==
Born in Pittsburgh, McConnell-Serio attended Seton-La Salle Catholic High School, leading the Lady Rebels to the PIAA state championship in 1984. McConnell-Serio played college basketball at Penn State. In four seasons at Penn State (1984–85 through 1987–88), she helped the Lady Lions to a 95–33 record and four consecutive NCAA tournament appearances. In the process, she was named the school&#x27;s first First-Team All-American while setting NCAA Division I records for career assists (1,307), assists in a season (355 in 1987) and season assist average (11.8 in 1987). Her assist total and assist per game average led the nation in both 1986 &amp; 1987. She also set the record for most career points by anyone with 1,000-plus assists at 1,897 points. In 2011, Courtney Vandersloot of Gonzaga University passed her in number of assists in a single season with 367 in 2011, and number of career points with 1,000-plus assists with 2,073 points. As of the start of the 2017–18 season, she still holds the records for most career assists, most assists per game in a season (and most assists per game in a season by a sophomore and by a junior), and most career triple-doubles. She graduated from Penn State in 1988. She won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award in 1988. At the time, this award was given to the best women&#x27;s basketball player in the country no taller than ; the height limit was later increased to before it was discontinued in 2013. She also ended her college career with seven career triple-doubles, which at the time was an NCAA all-divisions women&#x27;s record (later equaled by Louella Tomlinson of Saint Mary&#x27;s). This record has since been broken by Oregon&#x27;s Sabrina Ionescu.

Before joining the Minnesota Lynx, McConnell-Serio served as head coach of the girls&#x27; basketball team at Oakland Catholic High School in Pittsburgh for 13 years, from 1991 to 2003. During that time, her teams won 3 PIAA state championships (1993, 2001, 2003), were runners-up twice (2000–2002), and won five consecutive district championships (1999–2003). On December 17, 2002, she reached a coaching milestone with her 300th win. She finished her high school coaching career after the 2002–03 season with a 321–86 record.

McConnell-Serio also played in the WNBA. The former point guard played three seasons with the Cleveland Rockers (1998–2000). As a first-year player in 1998, she earned WNBA Newcomer of the Year and All-WNBA First Team honors after averaging 8.6 ppg and 6.4 apg (second in the league). She was a two-time winner of the Kim Perrot Sportsmanship Award (1998 and 2000) and finished her professional career with averages of 6.4 ppg and 4.6 apg in 81 contests.

In January 2003, McConnell-Serio returned to the WNBA as head coach of the Minnesota Lynx and took a team that finished 10–22 in the previous season to an 18–16 record and first-ever playoff appearance.

One year later, McConnell-Serio took a team picked to finish last in the Western Conference by a number of preseason publications and made a return trip to the playoffs and in the process was named the 2004 WNBA Coach of the Year. The &#x27;04 Lynx, who earned a franchise-best #3 seed in the WNBA Western Conference, tied franchise records for wins (18), home victories (11) and road wins (7) all set in McConnell-Serio&#x27;s first season. In addition, Minnesota enjoyed a franchise-record six-game winning streak.

However, the Lynx struggled in the 2005 and 2006 season, and McConnell-Serio resigned at mid-season on July 23, 2006.

Prior to her professional playing career, McConnell-Serio won two Olympic medals. She was a member of a gold medal-winning U.S. women&#x27;s basketball team in the 1988 Summer Olympics, and earned a bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

McConnell-Serio also won a gold medal at the 1991 World University Games. She won the 2004 WNBA Coach of the Year Award. In 1999, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine named her one of the Top 50 Athletes of the Century in Pennsylvania.

On April 13, 2007, McConnell-Serio was named the head coach at Duquesne University.

On April 12, 2013, McConnell-Serio was named the head coach at the University of Pittsburgh. She was fired on April 5, 2018.

<text>Muckle Flugga () is a small rocky island north of Unst in the Shetland Islands, Scotland. It is often described as the northernmost point of the British Isles, but the smaller islet of Out Stack is actually further north. It used to be the northernmost inhabited island, but forfeited that accolade to Unst when Muckle Flugga Lighthouse was automated in 1995 and the last residents moved out.

Muckle Flugga and neighbouring Little Flugga take their names from the Old Norse &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;cliff island&quot;. The larger island&#x27;s name has frequently appeared on lists of unusual place-names.

According to local folklore, Muckle Flugga and nearby Out Stack were formed when two giants, Herman and Saxa, fell in love with the same mermaid. They fought over her by throwing large rocks at each other, one of which became Muckle Flugga. To get rid of them, the mermaid offered to marry whichever one would follow her to the North Pole. They both followed her and drowned, as neither could swim.

<text>Gubbio () is an Italian town and &quot;comune&quot; in the far northeastern part of the Italian province of Perugia (Umbria). It is located on the lowest slope of Mt. Ingino, a small mountain of the Apennines.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The oldest evidence of human habitation in the Gubbio valley dates back to the Middle Palaeolithic, but only during the Neolithic period (6000-3000 BCE) does the earliest evidence of relatively permanent settlements emerge. Agriculture and animal husbandry were introduced to the valley around the 6th to 5th millennium BCE. Stone tools (made of local chert) and pottery have been found from this period. The styles and decorations of the pottery have a resemblance to contemporary finds from Marche and Lazio. At the excavated site of San Marco, east of Gubbio, archaeologists found a ditch with various almost-intact ceramic vessels, which may indicate a deliberate deposit as part of some sort of ritual.

Little evidence has been found from the Chalcolithic period (3500-2300 BCE) in the Gubbio valley.

====Bronze Age====
During the Middle to Late Bronze Age (1400-1200 BCE), there appears to have been a significant increase in population throughout the region. Beginning around 1400 BCE, there appears to have been a major shift in the settlement pattern in the Gubbio valley: from dispersed habitation of the valley below to &quot;the occupation of a single, strategically placed, upland site&quot;: Monte Ingino. This site, on a hilltop overlooking present-day Gubbio, was &quot;probably chosen because of its naturally defended position, good visibility of surrounding terrain, and access to surrounding pasture&quot;. The settlement at Monte Ingino was polyfocal, with people inhabiting sites on the slopes below the summit (such as Via dei Consoli and Vescovado), while the mountaintop itself, with its harsher climate, was only occupied seasonally, during spring. The valley below was under human use, as indicated by &quot;sporadic finds&quot;, but no actual settlement existed there.

The summit of Monte Ingino was &quot;undoubtedly&quot; the focus of ritual activity. An enormous amount of archaeological material has been found here, including some 30,000 pottery fragments and more than 25,000 animal bone fragments. These appear to have been part of some consumption ritual: a huge feast that served as a &quot;communal display&quot; to neighboring communities, who would have been able to see the smoke from the cooking fire; this ritual may have been performed by specific individuals &quot;while placed in this outpost above the territory over which they had to maintain control&quot;. Later, in the Archaic period, this ritual appears to have become much more formalized.

Later, around 1200-1100 BCE, another settlement area was established on the neighboring hilltop of Monte Asciano. This site served as a less prominent ritual center, and may have also been covered by a settlement, although only one hut has been excavated here. Occupation of Monte Asciano continued until about 950 BCE, when the local population all moved to the slopes below.

The Gubbio valley in the Bronze Age would have still been covered by &quot;a moist woodland environment which remained relatively cool and moist during the summer months&quot;. This period is probably the first time when people started cutting down significant parts of these woods to clear space for agriculture. Agricultural technology at the time was probably similar to that of Northern Europe during the Iron Age, with light wooden ards pulled by animals. Barley may have been cultivated on some of the gentler slopes near Monte Ingino and Monte Asciano. Pigs, whose bones make up a large portion of the bones found, could have been kept close to the settlements, where they would have readily consumed household food scraps, and then also taken to local woodlands, which would have been a great food source for them. Cows, whose bones are rather uncommon, may have also been kept; they could have been pastured in either naturally open areas or artificial clearings. Sheep and goats were most likely kept and grazed in the uplands around the settlements (sheep bones are also fairly common among the bone samples).

Woodland resources would have been abundant due to the more extensive forest cover. Red deer are attested from small amounts at Monte Ingino; roe deer are attested in small amounts at both Monte Ingino and Monte Asciano. Nuts and berries could have been foraged from the woodlands, as well as smaller game, and freshwater fish could be caught either in the perennial mountain stream between Monte Ingino and Monte Foce, or in the bigger streams (Saonda and Assino) down in the valley. Firewood would have been collected in these woodlands and brought back up to the sites in the hills, and flint would have been obtained from cobbles in the stream beds. Water supplies were probably derived either from the natural springs in the hills or from the seasonal streams between the hills.

====Iron Age====
Monte Asciano remained inhabited in the early Iron Age (1200-1000 BCE), and the sites of Vescovado and Sant&#x27;Agostino primarily date from this period as well.

===Ancient===
====Archaic period====
By the Archaic period, the main area of settlement had shifted to the lower slopes of Monte Asciano, including Sant&#x27;Agostino. Monte Ascoli itself was used as a religious sanctuary during this period. Finds from this period include a drystone platform, dozens of bronze figurines dated to between the 5th-3rd centuries BCE, and an &quot;aes rude&quot; probably dating from the 3rd century BCE.

====Umbrian period====
As &quot;Ikuvium&quot;, it was an important town of the Umbri in pre-Roman times, made famous for the discovery there in 1444 of the Iguvine Tablets, a set of bronze tablets that together constitute the largest surviving text in the Umbrian language.

According to Dorica Manconi, pre-Roman Ikuvium was located in a &quot;well-defined&quot; area in the vicinity of the present-day city. It was &quot;bounded by the cemeteries (S. Benedetto, Via Eraclito, etc.), between the river Camignano, the continuation of Via dei Consoli, Viale Parruccini and the wall so-called &quot;del vallo&quot;, extending over about 34 hectares and surrounded by a huge area of land to be used for agriculture and stock-farming&quot;. This is supported by a high number of archaeological finds in the area, including a &quot;vernice nera&quot; kiln possibly from the 3rd or 2nd century BCE as well as a necropolis at San Biagio. A number of smaller rural settlements also existed throughout the valley, dependent on the main town; the two best-known archaeologically were at Mocaiana and Casa Regni.

Gubbio is one of only two Umbrian towns known to have minted its own coins before the Roman conquest (the other was Todi).

====Roman period====
After the Roman conquest in the 2nd century BC – it kept its name as &quot;Iguvium&quot; – the city remained important, as attested by its Roman theatre, the second-largest surviving in the world.

Originally, Gubbio held strategic importance as controlling a major highway through the mountains. However, when the Via Flaminia was constructed 223 BCE, it bypassed Gubbio by several miles to the east. This caused Gubbio to lose much of its significance, and it declined gradually throughout the Imperial period.

After the Social War, the people of Gubbio were enrolled in the Roman tribe Clustumina.

The date of Gubbio&#x27;s theatre is unknown, although its size, its layout, and the rustication on the exterior suggest that it was built during or after the reign of Claudius. The remains of a large structure nearby may represent a mill of some sort. The Roman temple of the Guastaglia, within present-day Gubbio, has had its foundations excavated, and an inscription originally in the theatre (now in the Palazzo dei Consoli) records that the &quot;quattuorvir&quot; Gnaeus Satrius Rufus financed the restoration of the theatre and of a temple of Diana at Gubbio in the 1st century CE.

A funerary inscription records one Vittorius Rufus as &quot;avispex extispicus sacerdos publicus et privatus&quot; — that is, someone who interpreted bird flight and entrails, as well as managed public and private rituals — and another lists a Sestus Vetiarius Surus with a similar title. This is unusual because this profession was not very common in the Roman world, but it had been important among the Umbri and Etruscans (and featured prominently in the Iguvine tablets), suggesting that these religious practices continued locally. In the Imperial period, the cults of Isis and her son Harpocrates were also imported from Egypt.

===Middle ages===
====11th-13th centuries====
Gubbio became very powerful at the beginning of the Middle Ages. The town sent 1000 knights to fight in the First Crusade under the lead of Girolamo of the prominent Gabrielli family, who, according to an undocumented local tradition, were the first to reach the Church of the Holy Sepulchre when Jerusalem was seized (1099).

In terms of vegetation and land use, data is largely not available until the early medieval period. In the 11th century, cultivation was limited to the land immediately around the city and around the &quot;curtis&quot; of the individual feudal castles. Toward the beginning of the 11th century, &quot;the combination of demographic growth and the declining control by feudal lords over their land&quot; led to a more favorable contract for peasants such as &quot;enfiteusi&quot;. As a result, woodland was cleared to make room for farmland, pastures were converted to farmland, and uncultivated areas were also put to more intensive agriculture. This agriculture included cereal crops, vines, olives, and fruit trees. Mixed cultivation, such as wheat interspersed with rows of vines, was introduced and especially well suited for hilly areas. Watermills had been introduced by this point (at least) and were an important part of the rural economy.

The following centuries in Gubbio were turbulent, featuring wars against the neighbouring towns of Umbria. One of these wars saw the miraculous intervention of its bishop, Ubald, who secured Gubbio an overwhelming victory (1151) and a period of prosperity. In the struggles of Guelphs and Ghibellines, the Gabrielli, such as the Cante dei Gabrielli (c. 1260–1335), fought for the Guelph faction, supporting the papacy. As Podestà of Florence, Cante exiled Dante Alighieri, ensuring his own lasting notoriety.

In the 13th century (1200s), there was &quot;further economic expansion&quot;; Gubbio had to expand its city walls and construct new buildings to accommodate a growing population. This was accompanied by opening up more land for agriculture, especially in hilly areas, and even the upper hills. Documents from this period mention place names suggesting woodlands (Cerqueto, Monte Acera, Colle Cerrone, Cerquattino, Sterpeto) indicate the expansion of farmland during this period.

====14th-15th centuries====
In the early 1300s, there was a major population increase; in addition to vines, olives, and fruit trees, new crops were introduced: flax and hemp. Landlords were now based in the city, and peasants had greater autonomy over the land; at the same time, the population growth meant that they had to expand cultivation into increasingly poor soil areas in order to support the larger urban population. Then the plague happened in 1348, killing almost half the population. Cultivation significantly decreased, and woodlands regrew. The rural economy shifted more toward animal husbandry, and farmland was turned into pasture. These trends continued into the early 1400s.
In 1350 Giovanni Gabrielli, count of Borgovalle seized power as the lord of Gubbio. His rule was short, and he was forced to hand over the town to Cardinal Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz, representing the Papal states (1354).

A few years later, Gabriello Gabrielli, the bishop of Gubbio, also proclaimed himself lord of Gubbio (). Betrayed by a group of noblemen which included many of his relatives, the bishop was forced to leave the town and seek refuge at his home castle at Cantiano.

In the 1400s, there was a major economic revival of the city of Gubbio, and accordingly the demand for grain and other agricultural produce increased. Again, land was cleared for cultivation, and peasants were encouraged to do so by the Comune: at one point, peasants were given an extremely favorable contract: a peasant who cleared more than three &quot;mine&quot; in a single year was granted ownership of that land as well as its harvest. The Comune issued an edict in 1422 stipulating that all landowners must have their lands sown with &quot;good grain&quot; or face a large fine in the Camera Comunale. These indicate how strong the demand was for grain. Also, flax and hemp were cultivated, indicating the commercial demand from the city. By the end of the 1400s, so much land had been turned over to farmland that shepherds&#x27;s complaints are recorded saying that they could no longer find suitable pastureland and had to take their flocks into the Marche.

With the decline of the political prestige of the Gabrielli, Gubbio was thereafter incorporated into the territories of the House of Montefeltro. The lord of Urbino, Federico da Montefeltro rebuilt the ancient Palazzo Ducale in Gubbio, incorporating in it a studiolo veneered with intarsia like his studiolo at Urbino.

===Early modern period===
====16th-17th centuries====
The maiolica industry at Gubbio reached its apogee in the first half of the 16th century, with metallic lustre glazes imitating gold and copper.

There was significant deforestation around the 16th century, both in the uplands and lowlands, and some of the steep slopes that today only support &quot;limited scrub and woodland cover&quot; may have had more significant forests before the 1500s, supported by thicker soils that have since been eroded away. Also, especially since the 16th century, ditches and levees have been constructed to control water flow, significantly altering the drainage patterns in the valley.

Gubbio became part of the Papal States in 1631, when the della Rovere family, to whom the Duchy of Urbino had been granted, was extinguished. In 1860 Gubbio was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy along with the rest of the Papal States.

The name of the Pamphili family, a great papal family, originated in Gubbio then went to Rome under the pontificate of Pope Innocent VIII (1484–1492), and is immortalized by Diego Velázquez and his portrait of Pope Innocent X.

==Geography==

Gubbio is located in an upland valley in the Apennine Mountains, in the northeastern part of the present-day region of Umbria. This particular part of Umbria is a transitional area, close to both Marche to the east and Tuscany to the west. As a result, Gubbio has historically had strong political and cultural ties to both of those regions.

The Gubbio valley itself is arranged on a northwest-to-southeast axis. A steep limestone escarpment bounds the basin to the northeast. Unusually, streams flow through the Gubbio valley in two opposite directions, although both streams ultimately flow to the Tiber. These two streams are the Assino and the Chiascio. Two smaller streams, both called Saonda, run along the western side of the basin; one is a tributary of the Assino and the other is a tributary of the Chiascio. There is no clear watershed between the two Saondas, which may explain why they have the same name.

The municipality borders Cagli (PU), Cantiano (PU), Costacciaro, Fossato di Vico, Gualdo Tadino, Perugia, Pietralunga, Scheggia e Pascelupo, Sigillo, Umbertide and Valfabbrica.

===Geology===
The Gubbio Basin is a graben filled with river and lake sediments. Drainage is to the northwest and southwest; the rest is mostly surrounded by &quot;marly-arenaceous formations on the hills&quot;, while to the north is a steep escarpment. The surrounding mountains are primarily limestone and marl. Sediment runoff from the escarpment created several alluvial fans below it, resulting in the central part of the valley being higher. This is the reason behind the unusual opposite-flowing streams in the valley.

The origins lie during the Pleistocene, when tectonic activity simultaneously caused the basin to sink and the mountains to rise. There was once a lake in the basin. In the early Holocene, the lake disappeared and a stream system emerged.

===&quot;Frazioni&quot;===
The frazioni (territorial subdivisions) of the &quot;comune&quot; of Gubbio are the villages of: Belvedere, Bevelle, Biscina, Branca, Burano, Camporeggiano, Carbonesca, Casamorcia-Raggio, Cipolleto, Colonnata, Colpalombo, Ferratelle, Loreto, Magrano, Mocaiana, Monteleto, Monteluiano, Nogna, Padule, Petroia, Ponte d&#x27;Assi, Raggio, San Benedetto Vecchio, San Marco, San Martino in Colle, Santa Cristina, Scritto, Semonte, Spada, Torre Calzolari and Villa Magna.

==Monuments and sites of interest==


The historical centre of Gubbio has a decidedly medieval aspect: the town is austere in appearance because of the dark grey stone, narrow streets, and Gothic architecture. Many houses in central Gubbio date to the 14th and 15th centuries, and were originally the dwellings of wealthy merchants. They often have a second door fronting on the street, usually just a few centimetres from the main entrance. This secondary entrance is narrower, and or so above the actual street level. This type of door is called a &quot;porta dei morti&quot; (door of the dead) because it was proposed that they were used to remove the bodies of any who might have died inside the house. This is almost certainly false, but there is no agreement as to the purpose of the secondary doors. A more likely theory is that the door was used by the owners to protect themselves when opening to unknown persons, leaving them in a dominating position.

=== Religious architecture or sites ===
* &quot;Duomo&quot;: This cathedral was built in the late 12th century. The most striking feature is the rose-window in the façade with, at its sides, the symbols of the Evangelists: the eagle for John the Evangelist, the lion for Mark the Evangelist, the angel for Matthew the Apostle and the ox for Luke the Evangelist. The interior has a latine cross plan with a single nave. The most precious art piece is the wooden Christ over the altar, of the Umbrian school.
* &quot;San Francesco&quot;: This church from the second half of the 13th century is the sole religious edifice in the city having a nave with two aisles. The vaults are supported by octagonal pilasters. The frescoes on the left side date from the 15th century.
* &quot;Santa Maria Nuova&quot;: This is a typical Cistercian church of the 13th century. In the interior is a 14th-century fresco portraying the so-called &quot;Madonna del Belvedere&quot; (1413), by Ottaviano Nelli. It also has a work by Guido Palmeruccio. Also from the Cistercians is the &quot;Convent of St. Augustine&quot;, with some frescoes by Nelli.
* &quot;Basilica of Sant&#x27;Ubaldo&quot;, with a nave and four aisles is a sanctuary outside the city. Noteworthy are the marble altar and the great windows with episodes of the life of Ubald, patron of Gubbio. The finely sculpted portals and the fragmentary frescoes give a hint of the magnificent 15th-century decoration once boasted by the basilica.
* &quot;San Giovanni Battista, Gubbio&quot;: 13th-century church with one nave only with four transversal arches supporting the pitched roof, a model for later Gubbio churches.
* &quot;San Domenico&quot;, once known as San Martino
* &quot;Sant&#x27;Agostino&quot;
* &quot;Santa Croce della Foce&quot;

=== Secular architecture or sites ===
* &quot;Roman Theatre&quot;: This ancient open air theater built in the 1st century BC using square blocks of local limestone. Traces of mosaic decoration have been found. Originally, the diameter of the cavea was 70 metres and could house up to 6,000 spectators. 
* &quot;Roman Mausoleum&quot;: This Mausoleum is sometimes said to be of Gaius Pomponius Graecinus, but on no satisfactory grounds.
* &quot;Palazzo dei Consoli&quot;: Dating to the first half of the 14th century, this massive palace, is now a museum housing the Iguvine Tablets.
* &quot;Palazzo and Torre Gabrielli&quot;
* &quot;Palazzo Ducale&quot;: The Palace built from 1470 by Luciano Laurana or Francesco di Giorgio Martini for Federico da Montefeltro. Famous is the inner court, reminiscent of the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino.
* &quot;Museo Cante Gabrielli&quot;: This museum is housed in the &quot;Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo&quot;, which once belonged to the Gabrielli family.
* &quot;Vivian Gabriel Oriental Collection&quot;: This is a museum of Tibetan, Nepalese, Chinese and Indian art. The collection was donated to the municipality by Edmund Vivian Gabriel (1875–1950), British colonial officer and adventurer, a collateral descendant of the Gabrielli who were lords of Gubbio in the Middle Ages.

==Culture==
Gubbio is home to the Corsa dei Ceri, a run held every year always on Saint Ubaldo Day, the 15th day of May, in which three teams, devoted to Ubald, Saint George and Saint Anthony the Great run through throngs of cheering supporters clad in the distinctive colours of yellow, blue and black, with white trousers and red belts and neckbands, up much of the mountain from the main square in front of the Palazzo dei Consoli to the basilica of St. Ubaldo, each team carrying a statue of their saint mounted on a wooden octagonal prism, similar to an hour-glass shape tall and weighing about .

The race has strong devotional, civic, and historical overtones and is one of the best-known folklore manifestations in Italy; the Ceri was chosen as the heraldic emblem on the coat of arms of Umbria as a modern administrative region.

A celebration like the Corsa dei Ceri is held also in Jessup, Pennsylvania. In this small town the people carry out the same festivities as the residents of Gubbio do by &quot;racing&quot; the three statues through the streets during the Memorial Day weekend. This remains an important and sacred event in both towns.

Gubbio was also one of the centres of production of the Italian pottery (maiolica), during the Renaissance. The most important Italian potter of that period, Giorgio Andreoli, was active in Gubbio during the early 16th century.
The town&#x27;s most famous story is that of &quot;The Wolf of Gubbio&quot;; a man-eating wolf that was tamed by St. Francis of Assisi and who then became a docile resident of the city. The legend is related to the 14th-century &quot;Little Flowers of St. Francis&quot;.

===The Gubbio Layer===

Gubbio is also known among geologists and palaeontologists as the discovery place of what was at first called the &quot;Gubbio layer&quot;, a sedimentary layer enriched in iridium that was exposed by a roadcut outside of town. This thin, dark band of sediment marks the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, also known as the K–T boundary or K–Pg boundary, between the Cretaceous and Paleogene geological periods about million years ago, and was formed by infalling debris from the gigantic meteor impact probably responsible for the mass extinction of the dinosaurs. Its iridium, a heavy metal rare on Earth&#x27;s surface, is plentiful in extraterrestrial material such as comets and asteroids. It also contains small globules of glassy material called tektites, formed in the initial impact. Discovered at Gubbio, the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary is also visible at many places all over the world. The characteristics of this boundary layer support the theory that a devastating meteorite impact, with accompanying ecological and climatic disturbance, was directly responsible for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

===Gubbio in fiction===

In Hermann Hesse&#x27;s novel &quot;Steppenwolf&quot; (1927) the isolated and tormented protagonist – a namesake of the wolf – consoles himself at one point by recalling a scene that the author might have beheld during his travels: &quot;(...) that slender cypress on the hill over Gubbio that, though split and riven by a fall of stone, yet held fast to life and put forth with its last resources a new sparse tuft at the top&quot;.

The town is a backdrop in Antal Szerb&#x27;s novel &quot;Journey by Moonlight&quot; (1937) as well as Danièle Sallenave&#x27;s &quot;Les Portes de Gubbio&quot; (1980).

The TV series &quot;Don Matteo&quot;, where the title character ministers to his parish while solving crimes, was shot on location in Gubbio between 2000 and 2011.

The 2024 novel &quot;What We Buried&quot; by Robert Rotenberg takes place in Canada and Gubbio. In particular, the novel involves the 40 &quot;Martyrs of Gubbio&quot;, civilians seized from their homes by German soldiers late in WW2 and shot, in reprisal for the shooting of a German officer by partisans.

===Other===
Anna Moroni, a popular cook on the Italian daytime TV series &quot;La Prova del Cuoco&quot; discusses Gubbio in many of her TV segments. She often cooks dishes from the region on TV, and she featured Gubbio in her first book.

==Sport==
A.S. Gubbio 1910 football club play in Serie C at the Pietro Barbetti Stadium.

==Transportation==
The city is served by Fossato di Vico–Gubbio railway station located in Fossato di Vico; until 1945 it also operated the Central Apennine railway (&quot;Ferrovia Appenino Centrale&quot; abbreviation &quot;FAC&quot;) with a narrow gauge which departed from Arezzo and reached as far as Fossato di Vico and in Gubbio had his own railway station located in via Beniamino Ubaldi 2, now completely demolished.

<text>The Workers Party of Jamaica (WPJ) was a Marxist-Leninist political party in Jamaica. WPJ was founded on 17 December 1978 by Trevor Munroe, along with Elean Thomas and others. Trevor Munroe, a Rhodes scholar from Oxford University, served as its general secretary. The forerunner of WPJ was the Workers Liberation League.

WPJ was a &quot;critical ally&quot; of the People&#x27;s National Party (PNP) of Michael Manley. With WPJ backing, the PNP government developed closer relations to Cuba, which irritated the United States. However, in the late 1970s, the WPJ participated in Jamaican popular resistance to fiscal controls imposed on the country by the International Monetary Fund and accepted by Manley. The 1980 elections resulted in a victory of the rightist Jamaica Labour Party. Manley&#x27;s association with the communist WPJ may have contributed to his defeat.

The WPJ youth organization, Young Communist League of WPJ, was a member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

By 1992, the WPJ was defunct.

<text>Kirstie Mary Allsopp (born 31 August 1971) is a British television presenter, best known as co-presenter of Channel 4 property shows including &quot;Location, Location, Location&quot;, &quot;Love It or List It UK&quot;, &quot;Relocation, Relocation&quot; and &quot;Location Revisited&quot;.

==Background==
Allsopp is the eldest child and daughter of Charles Allsopp, 6th Baron Hindlip, a former chairman of Christie&#x27;s, by his marriage to Fiona Victoria Jean Atherley McGowan (1947–2014). She has a younger brother, Henry William (b. 1973), and two younger sisters, Sofie (b. 1980) and Natasha Fiona (b. 1986). Owing to her father&#x27;s peerage, she is entitled to use the courtesy style The Honourable Kirstie Allsopp. The designer and businesswoman Cath Kidston is her cousin.

She attended ten schools as a child, including St Clotilde&#x27;s in Lechlade, Gloucestershire, and Bedales near Petersfield, Hampshire. After spending time in India teaching English, Allsopp returned to the UK and began a series of positions, working for &quot;Country Living&quot; and &quot;Food &amp; Home&quot; magazines and at Hindlip &amp; Prentice Interiors, and she studied Art History at Christie&#x27;s.

Allsopp set up her own home search company, Kirmir, in 1996, focusing on top end purchases in Central and West London.

In August 2014, Allsopp was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

==Personal life==
Her husband (since January 2025) is property developer Ben Andersen, and they have two sons, Bay (b. 2006) and Oscar (b. 2008). She is also stepmother to her partner&#x27;s two sons from a previous relationship. They live in London.

In 2009 Allsopp and her family bought and restored a house called Meadowgate, in rural Devon. It had been empty for 39 years. The restoration and interior decorating were the subject of the TV series &quot;Kirstie&#x27;s Homemade Home&quot;. It was again the setting for her &quot;Kirstie&#x27;s Homemade Christmas&quot; programme, showing people how to have an individual Christmas using secondhand and homemade products such as wreaths from material found from nearby woods. 

Allsopp was criticised in 2022 for comments she made about people not being able to purchase housing, arguing many people are not willing to make enough sacrifices like cutting out coffee, Netflix, and going to the gym. Allsopp, who received financial support from her family to purchase her first home, claimed &quot;...there are loads of people who can [make sacrifices] and don’t.&quot; Following criticism Allsopp posted several responses on Twitter before quitting the platform.

<text>Józef Jerzy Boguski (; 1853–1933) was a Polish chemist and a professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic.

==Life==

Boguski served as an assistant in St. Petersburg to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.

From 1895 Boguski was a professor at Warsaw&#x27;s Wawelberg and Rotwand School, and from 1920 at the Warsaw Polytechnic. He carried out pioneering studies in chemical kinetics and formulated &quot;Boguski&#x27;s rule&quot; concerning the speed of dissolution of solids in liquids.

It was at a laboratory run by Boguski in the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at &quot;Krakowskie Przedmieście&quot; 66 in Warsaw that his cousin Maria Skłodowska (Marie Curie), future investigator of radioactivity and future double Nobel laureate, in 1890–91 began her practical scientific training.

During World War I, Boguski studied explosives and poisons with military applications. He was also a popularizer of science.

==Honors==
In 1926 Kraków University and the Warsaw Polytechnic bestowed an honorary doctorate on Boguski. In the same year, he also became an Honorary Member of the Polish Chemical Society.

<doc id="1017969" wikidata="Q5598232" url="?curid=1017969" title="Gray Media">
<text>Gray Media, Inc. is an American publicly traded television broadcasting company based in Atlanta. Founded in 1946 by James Harrison Gray as Gray Communications Systems, the company owns or operates 180 stations across the United States in 113 markets. Its station base consists of media markets ranging from as large as Atlanta to one of the smallest markets, North Platte, Nebraska.

==History==
James H. Gray started his communication business with the purchase of The Herald Publishing Company (a company founded in 1897 to promote &quot;The Albany Herald&quot;, a newspaper that started publication in 1891), in 1946 after he returned from World War II. The purchase included WALB radio. Gray launched WALB-TV in 1954. In 1960, Gray purchased WJHG-TV in Panama City, Florida, and followed it later in the decade with KTVE serving Monroe, Louisiana and southern Arkansas.

In 1986 Gray died, leaving his 50.5% share of the stock in a trust for his children with stipulation that they run the business together, sell their stock with each other or sell out together. It caused difficulties as two of the three wanted to sell, but the third was against the purchase. In 1991, to break the stalemate, the board of directors had the company purchase 25% of their shares.

===Gray Communication Systems===
The company was then taken public on NASDAQ&#x27;s small-cap market in the 2nd quarter 1992. The price per share dropped to $8. The company put itself-or any part up-for sale by the end of 1992. While the board of directors received about 40 offers, Bull Run Corporation eventually stepped in and purchased the remaining shares of the Gray siblings, who as part of the deal resigned from the board.

New management took over all three TV stations. Bull Run Corporation, primarily owned by J. Mack Robinson, decided to make Gray a Southeast regional media company, expanding its focus beyond the state of Georgia. Gray purchased two TV stations (WKYT-TV and WYMT-TV) from the failed and government-seized Kentucky Central Insurance Company in September 1994 after a court challenge to the sale by Kentucky Central builder Garvice Kincaid.

In 1994 and 1995, Gray purchased two newspapers, the &quot;Rockdale Citizen&quot; (acquired May 31, 1994) and &quot;Gwinnett Post-Tribune&quot; (acquired January 1995; quickly renamed &quot;Gwinnett Daily Post&quot;) and seven advertising weeklies. In 1995, the company moved its stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange. By this time, Robinson, directly or through Bull Run, owned 44% of the company&#x27;s stock. Gray had started to focus on its TV station segment over the newspaper holding while TV produced more income and the newspapers&#x27; income were declining. Just months after doubling the &quot;Daily Post&quot;″s staff, one third were laid off and a quarter of &quot;The Albany Herald&quot;″s staff followed in January 1996. Newspaper leaders resigned during this period–from the corporate president in late 1995 to the &quot;Citizen&quot;&#x27;s editor and publisher.
In 1996, Gray added additional TV stations while entering additional communication industry segments. In 1996, &quot;Fortune&quot; considered the company the nation&#x27;s 81st fastest growing company, with a 48% growth rate, and as if to prove the point, Gray purchased WRDW-TV in January 1996. In September of the same year, a basket purchase from First American Media, Inc. earned the company two more TV stations, (WCTV and WVLT-TV), Satellite and Production Business Services, which was renamed Lynqx Communications and PortaPhone paging business.

In August and September 1996, Gray raised additional operating funds by various means. On August 20, KTVE was sold for cash and accounts receivable. The company issued and sold Class B common stock (through a public offering), senior subordinated notes and preferred stock in September. Also, a new bank credit facility was arranged. This brought the company total to $534.5 million in available funds with $409.5 million directly available.

Also in September 1996, Ralph Gabbard, the newly named president and CEO, died from a heart attack at age 50. Robinson, Bull Run&#x27;s chair, took over as interim CEO and president with Bull Run CEO Robert Prather as interim executive vice-president, acquisitions.

With its additional funds, Gray continued purchasing in 1997 with two announcements in January and February. The company bought Gulflink Communications, Inc., a transportable satellite uplink business based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in April 1997 to go along with Lynqx. With Raycom Media acquiring a station from AFLAC Broadcast Group, Inc., forcing them to sell WITN-TV to Gray, which was finalized on August 1, 1997. The &quot;Gwinnett Daily Post&quot; increased circulation in 1997 through a deal with Genesis Cable Communications to provide the paper to its metro Atlanta subscribers at Genesis&#x27;s expense.

In 1998, Gray started to expand beyond its Southeast region. As the company agreed to purchase the Busse Broadcasting Corporation, which owned KOLN, KGIN-TV and WEAU. Gray&#x27;s ownership of a newspaper and TV station in Albany, Georgia, while grandfathered was examined under the media cross-ownership rule of the FCC due to this potential purchase. WALB was thus sold to Liberty Corp.&#x27;s Cosmos Broadcasting in August 1998.

In 2002, Robinson became chairman and CEO, his son-in-law Hilton Howell vice chairman, Prather president/COO and Jim Ryan senior vice president. They had Gray purchase 14 Benedek Broadcasting stations while that company was in bankruptcy.

===Gray Television===

In 2006, the company spun off its five daily newspapers and wireless messaging business into the newly formed Triple Crown Media, later (in 2010) renamed Southern Community Newspapers. A new strategy of purchasing stations in college towns or capitals was put into place by.

The company had overpaid for a pair of stations and was over leveraged like many other station groups entering the Great Recession. Advertising revenues dropped. The twin problems caused its shares to trade at its lowest at 16 cents in 2008, thus the NYSE indicated they might delist the company. Loan covenants could have forced the company into default. Robinson stepped down with Howell replacing him in 2008.
On July 30, 2009, Gray was awarded a contract to manage seven Young Broadcasting-owned stations. Through December 31, 2012, Gray would earn $2.2 million and an opportunity to earn additional specified incentive fees if certain performance targets were exceeded.

Prather left the company in 2013 and Howell took over the president title. On November 4, 2013, Gray announced that it would purchase Yellowstone Holdings for $23 million, adding local stations: KGNS-TV, KGWN, KCWY and KCHY-LP. Three weeks later, on November 20, Gray announced it would purchase Hoak Media and Parker Broadcasting for $335 million, and North Dakota&#x27;s Fox affiliate KNDX/KXND for $7.5 million. As part of the deal, stations KAQY, KHAS-TV and KXJB, were proposed to be sold to Excalibur Broadcasting and operated by Gray under a &quot;local marketing agreements&quot;. On December 19, it was announced that stations KREX-TV and WMBB would be sold to Nexstar Broadcasting Group, while KFQX would be sold to Mission Broadcasting. On March 25, 2014, Prime Cities Broadcasting, owner of KNDX/KXND, requested that the FCC dismiss the sale of KNDX/KXND to Excalibur.

The sale was completed on June 13, 2014. However, some stations were forced to go off the air and their programming was moved to a multicast stream on adjacent channels, due to some stations being unable to receive regulatory approval, after the FCC&#x27;s ruling on joint sales agreements. Those silent stations would then be sold off to minority interest, pending FCC approval.

On July 24, 2014, SJL Broadcasting announced that it would sell WJRT-TV and WTVG to Gray, for $128 million. The sale was completed on September 15.

In July 2015, Gray closed its accounting and human resources offices in Albany (housed in the same building as The Albany Herald), combining them with the corporate offices in Atlanta.

In September 2015, Gray announced that it would acquire the television and radio stations of Schurz Communications for $442.5 million. It also purchased KCRG-TV in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, from the locally owned Gazette Company, who owned the station from its sign-on in 1953.

In January 2016, Gray opened a national news bureau in Washington, D.C., led by former APTV journalist Jacqueline Policastro. The bureau was designed to provide enhanced coverage of national political issues for Gray&#x27;s local stations.

On May 13, 2016, Gray announced that it would acquire WDTV and WVFX in Clarksburg, West Virginia, from Withers Broadcasting for $26.5 million. On June 3, 2016, it was announced that Gray would acquire two stations that were spun-off from the Nexstar-Media General merger; KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa, and WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin, for $270 million. On February 16, 2017, Gray announced that it would acquire WABI-TV in Bangor, Maine, and WCJB-TV in Gainesville, Florida, from Diversified Communications for $85 million. On May 4, 2017, Gray announced its intent to acquire WCAX-TV in Burlington, Vermont, from Mount Mansfield Television for $29 million.

In April 2017, Gray filed a lawsuit against Nick Prueher and Joe Pickett, founders of the Found Footage Festival, for fraud and copyright infringement, after having booked an appearance on the morning show of a Gray station as a fake strongman act, &quot;Chop and Steele&quot;, and utilizing the footage during their show. The parties later agreed to a settlement.

On May 21, 2018, Gray entered into an agreement to acquire KNHL from Legacy Broadcasting for $475,000. Gray intended to turn KNHL into a satellite of its NBC affiliate KSNB-TV.

On June 25, 2018, Gray announced its intent to acquire Raycom Media for $3.65 billion, pending regulatory approval. The combined company would be led by Raycom&#x27;s current president and CEO Pat LaPlatney, with current Gray CEO Hilton Howell acting as executive chairman and co-CEO. The acquisition, which Gray expected to close in late 2018, would give Gray 142 stations in 92 markets, making Gray the third-largest owner of television stations in the United States, with a total market share of 24%.

Although Gray foresaw that the acquisition would receive regulatory approval quickly, due to limited market overlap between the two companies and its still-relatively low total market reach post-acquisition. Gray would divest nine stations in markets where Gray and Raycom both already owned stations, including WTNZ, WTOL, KXXV, WTXL, WFXG, KWES-TV, WPGX, WSWG and WDFX-TV. The sale was approved by the FCC on December 20, 2018. The deal was completed on January 2, 2019.

Gray announced on April 24, 2019, a joint venture with Grand Ole Opry Entertainment Group, a subsidiary of Ryman Hospitality Properties, a former owner of The Nashville Network. The services would consist of a broadcast diginet and an OTT streaming platform. The joint venture is based in Nashville under general manager Drew Riefenberger. Gray contributed distribution and marketing capabilities, multicast knowledge and affiliate Gray TV stations. The Circle TV network made its launch on January 1, 2020.

On February 1, 2021, Gray announced its intent to acquire all Quincy Media&#x27;s broadcasting properties for $925 million in cash. To comply with federal regulators, Gray would divest Quincy stations in Tucson; Harrisburg, Illinois; Waterloo/Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Madison, La Crosse and Wausau in Wisconsin over to Allen Media Group. Gray&#x27;s acquisition of Quincy Media was completed on August 2.

In March 2021, Gray revealed plans to purchase a shuttered General Motors plant in Atlanta suburb Doraville, Georgia, and transform the site into a media production community called Assembly. The &quot;studio city&quot; is set to include multiple film studios, as well as apartments, townhomes, a hotel, corporate offices, restaurants and retail space. In September 2021, Gray Television purchased Doraville-based Third Rail Studios for $27.5 million.

On May 3, 2021, Gray announced plans to buy the television division of Meredith Corporation for $2.7 billion. If approved, Gray would sell WJRT-TV to acquire competing station WNEM-TV, owned by Meredith. It is revealed that Allen Media Group would purchase WJRT-TV in Flint for $70 million. The sale was completed on December 1.

On September 18, 2021, Gray launched &quot;InvestigateTV&quot;, a weekly program featuring investigative stories from a national team and Gray local investigations to a national audience. The program draws from an investigative unit formed at WVUE under Raycom ownership.

In January 2022, Gray acquired 24 low-powered station from Lowcountry 34 Media for over $3.75 million.

In March 2022, Gray acquired 4 stations from L4 Media Group: KBXS-CD in Shreveport, Louisiana, WBXA-CD in Birmingham, Alabama, WBXC-CD in Champaign, Illinois, and WBXM-CD in Montgomery, Alabama.

In May 2022, Gray reached an agreement with the Telemundo Network Group expanding the term of Gray’s affiliation agreements with Telemundo. This new agreement allows Gray the right to launch the first local Telemundo affiliations on their television stations in 22 additional markets.

On September 28, 2022, Gray announced its intent to purchase WBQC-LD for $2.5 million. The sale was completed on November 21, making WBQC-LD a sister station to WXIX-TV.

On September 11, 2023, &quot;InvestigateTV+&quot;, a weekday expansion of the &quot;InvestigateTV&quot; franchise, launched on all Gray television stations and is syndicated to stations outside of a Gray market.

On October 1, 2023, the Peachtree Sports Network will launch in Georgia, focusing on live, local sports programming all year long. The broadcast network will launch in Atlanta but will soon air on Gray-owned over-the-air channels in Albany, Augusta, Columbus, Macon and Savannah in the coming months.

On November 7, 2023, Gray, Warner Bros. Discovery and Lionsgate teamed up to form Free TV Networks, a new company to be led by broadcasting veteran Jonathan Katz, with presence in both broadcast networks and FAST streaming channels. The company will launch broadcast and FAST streaming versions of The365, a channel for African-American audiences, and Outlaw, a network for Western programming, as well as FAST channels VCR Action and VCR Haha, under the joint venture on January 1, 2024. Later, on November 10, 2023, it was announced that Circle would cease its broadcast operations on December 31, 2023, with plans on transitioning to FAST streaming and other avenues, as well as a likely chance for the broadcast operations of Circle to be replaced by one of two channels of the new Free TV Networks company.

On February 1, 2024, it was announced that Marquee and Gray had reached agreements to swap television stations in Wyoming and Utah. As part of the swap Marquee will end up with KCWY-DT in Casper, Wyoming; KGWN-TV in Cheyenne, Wyoming; KSTF in Scottsbluff, Nebraska; and KNEP in Sydney, Nebraska. At the same time Gray will get Marquee’s FCC permit authorizing construction of a new and currently unbuilt TV station KCBU in Salt Lake City.

On February 14, 2024, Gray Television and Syncbak launched Zeam, a free ad-supported steaming service that features local news, sports and weather.

===Gray Media===
On December 30, 2024, the Board of Directors at Gray Television formally approved changing the name of the company to &quot;Gray Media,&quot; after years of referring to the company internally and externally by that informal name.

==Staff==
Under the direction of executive chairman and CEO Hilton Howell, Gray Television was one of the first broadcasters to implement a COVID-19 vaccination mandate. He has said he is &quot;proud&quot; of the corporate culture he has helped create. Howell says he supports media consolidation and opposes an FCC cap on ownership. In their 2022 environmental, social, and governance (ESG) report, Howell noted he was committed to &quot;improving our gender and racial diversity in leadership, our business ethics and compliance policies, our training and development, and our responsible energy use&quot;. According to the report, under Howell&#x27;s leadership, the company aired a six-month series on health and wellness in Appalachia, known as &quot;Bridging the Great Health Divide&quot;, expanded their relationship with Telemundo to provide additional Spanish-language content in the United States, highlighted stories about historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), aired and produced content about Pride Month and Hispanic Heritage Month in local markets, and aired and produced two climate change series, &quot;Troubled Water&quot;, a documentary about the water crisis, and &quot;Coast &amp; Climate&quot;, a series about the impact of climate change in Louisiana.

===Stations===
==Management of Young Broadcasting stations==
On July 22, 2009, a New York bankruptcy judge approved a plan transferring ownership of Young Broadcasting and its stations to the company&#x27;s secured lenders. The plan included Gray Television coming in as an outside party to advise on the operations of Young-owned stations in seven markets through December 2012. The new Young Broadcasting still held the final say on overall operations for their stations, including programming and personnel.

The former Young-owned stations managed by Gray Television include:
*WKRN-TV in Nashville, Tennessee
*WTEN in Albany, New York; repeater WCDC-TV in Adams, Massachusetts; and an SSA with WXXA-TV
*WRIC-TV in Richmond, Virginia
*WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin
*KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa
*KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and its translators throughout South Dakota
*KLFY-TV in Lafayette, Louisiana

Young Broadcasting would retain ownership of all its stations, including three stations that Gray would not operate: KRON-TV in San Francisco, California, WATE-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee, and WLNS-TV in Lansing, Michigan, the last two due to Gray already owning stations in those markets. Gray considered the possibility of purchasing the Young stations if the group went on the market.

The agreement ended without any further extensions on December 31, 2012, and Young agreed to a merger with Media General in mid-2013. Gray would eventually purchase KWQC and WBAY outright when Nexstar Broadcasting Group acquired Media General in 2017, as Nexstar already owned WHBF-TV and WFRV-TV in each market. At that time, Gray had already acquired Sioux Falls rival station KSFY. Gray would also re-enter the Richmond market when it bought WWBT in 2019, following its merger with Raycom Media, and would also re-enter the Nashville market in 2021 with WSMV-TV after acquiring the television assets of Meredith Corporation.

==Washington News Bureau==
By January 20, 2016, Gray had set up their Washington news bureau by Jacqueline Policastro to enable stations to get interviews with U.S. Senators and Representatives serving their communities. The bureau cooperates with Lilly Broadcasting&#x27;s Washington bureau, previously started by Policastro, and is located at the NBC News Capitol Hill bureau, 400 N. Capitol Street. In February 2019, Gray announced that journalist Greta Van Susteren joined the company as its Chief National Political Analyst. Gray then announced in April 2019 Greta Van Susteren as host of a Sunday morning syndicated show, &quot;Full Court Press with Greta Van Susteren&quot;, which was launched in September 2019. Van Susteren departed the company for Newsmax TV in late 2022.

=== &quot;Local News Live&quot; ===
Originating from Gray&#x27;s Washington bureau is &quot;Local News Live&quot;, a hosted service of live breaking news and events from the 113 Gray television markets across the country, similar to &quot;LiveNOW from Fox&quot; (produced by Fox Television Stations) and &quot;The National Desk&quot; (produced by Sinclair Broadcast Group). The channel operates from 7 a.m. to midnight Eastern (with paid programing vacating their spots), features live newscasts at 7 a.m., 2 p.m., and 8 p.m. Eastern time, and repeats throughout the day when no breaking news is occurring. In addition to live events, the anchors interview reporters and use footage not otherwise seen on broadcast. &quot;Local News Live&quot; airs on Gray television live streams between local newscasts and as a separate option on Gray station websites.

==Sports programming==
Since 2023, Gray has created several over-the-air regional sports networks; including Arizona&#x27;s Family Sports, Gulf Coast Sports &amp; Entertainment Network, Matrix Midwest, Palmetto Sports &amp; Entertainment, Peachtree Sports Network, Rock Entertainment Sports Network (a joint venture with Rock Entertainment Group), Tennessee Valley Sports Entertainment Network and Silver State Sports &amp; Entertainment Network.

Nationally, Gray holds the rights to the American Association of Professional Baseball, the National Collegiate Hockey Conference, and Fight Sports.

Reles was born in 1913 in Chashniki in the southeastern part of the Vitebsk region. His father Leib was a teacher at a &quot;cheder&quot;, while his mother was the daughter of a prosperous merchant family. In 1914, the German advance and the Russian Revolution disrupted the economic livelihood of his family and the larger Jewish community of Chashniki, although the expulsion of Jews from within the war zone did not reach Chashniki. In 1918, Chashniki was incorporated into the borders of the newly formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and the surrounding area was transferred to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in March 1924. 

Reles&#x27; mother died in 1919 and his father began leaving Chashniki regularly to seek work, as his position as a &quot;melamed&quot; brought him under increasing government scrutiny. Reles stayed with his maternal grandfather, who cultivated an interest in Yiddish literature, including writers such as Sholem Aleichem. Reles spoke Belarusian and Russian as well as Yiddish, studying at a Soviet state-sponsored, Yiddish-language school, before moving to the local Belarusian-language school. He began to write poetry, initially in Belarusian, and then switched to Yiddish at the advice of his father. 

His first poem was published in a Soviet Jewish newspaper entitled &quot;Der Yunger Arbeiter&quot; in 1930. He wrote poems and prose in Yiddish and also several poems in Russian. In 1931, after graduating high school, he joined his two sisters who had left Chashniki and moved to Vitebsk, the nearest large city. Reles studied pedagogy at the Vitebsk Jewish Pedagogical Tekhnikum, an institution that trained instructors for the type of Soviet Yiddish-language schools that Reles had attended. After a year, he transferred to the Film Technical School and enrolled in the Scenario Department. When he finished his studies in Vitebsk in September 1934, he was offered a job teaching in Yanavichy, but instead continued further pedagogical studies in Minsk. He submitted a number of poems to the literary journal &quot;Shtern&quot;, the premiere Yiddish-language publication in Belarus. When he received no reply, he went to the paper&#x27;s editorial offices in Minsk, where the assistant editor Zelik Akselrod met with him and read his poems aloud. This was overheard by chief editor Izi Kharik from his office; Kharik accepted three out of four of Reles&#x27; works for publication. Kharik went on to become a mentor to Reles and, with Kharik&#x27;s help, Reles was released from his teaching obligations in Yanavichy and was accepted into the Yiddish literature department of the Minsk Pedagogical Institute. With Akselrod and Kharik&#x27;s recommendation, Reles was accepted to the Belarusian Writers&#x27; Union in 1936.

In late 1937, Reles left Minsk for a teaching position in a Yiddish school in Slutsk. In early 1939, he married his wife Yekha, and the couple soon had a daughter, Raisel. He continued to be active in Yiddish culture in Soviet Belarus and published his first poetry collection, &quot;Onheyb&quot;, in 1939, with Akselrod serving as the book&#x27;s editor.

Eventually Reles left Slutsk for another teaching position in Novogrudok and was joined by his wife and daughter; he also served as the content director for a local radio station. In early June 1941, he returned to Minsk to visit Akselrod, only to discover that Akselrod had been arrested along with two other well-known Yiddish writers on 30 May 1941 and was being held in a Minsk prison. Kharik had already been imprisoned, tortured, and executed by this time.

Reles joined the Red Army in the early part of 1941, fleeing the advancing German forces during the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. On July 3, German troops entered Novogrudok where his wife and daughter were still living; they were caught by the Nazis and murdered in the Holocaust.

After surviving the war in the Ural Mountains, Reles was demobilized from the army in late 1941, initially to join a road-cleaning crew, but then was recommended by his superiors as the editor of the district newspaper, &quot;Stroyitel&quot;&#x27; in Gremyachinsk.

After the war, Reles struggled to find work with Yiddish publications. He began writing in Russian for a number of journals and newspapers. He also began using the formal name &#x27;Grigorii&#x27; or the less formal &#x27;Girsh and Grisha&#x27; for his professional work. 

In 1948, Reles left his position on the staff of the journal &quot;Vozhyk&quot; after other editors informed him he was at the risk of investigation. Lacking other employment opportunities, Reles took a job teaching Russian literature and language at a night school. He began to publish in Yiddish again in 1961 in the Moscow-based journal &quot;Sovetish heymland&quot;, and went on to publish several collections of short stories and poetry in Yiddish, Belarusian, and Russian. 

Most of his works were translated and published in Belarusian. In the 1990s and early 2000s, he was an active contributor to the Minsk Jewish Cultural Association. In 1997, he published his memoirs in Russian, &quot;V krayu svetlykh berez&quot; (In the Land of Light Birch Trees) as a cultural poirtrait of Yiddish life in Belarus from 1930s. At the time of his death, at age 91, he had outlived the Soviet Union and was considered the &quot;patriarch of Jewish writers in Belarus&quot;.

<text>Ian Frazier (born 1951 in Cleveland, Ohio) is an American writer and humorist. He wrote the 1989 non-fiction history &quot;Great Plains&quot;, 2010&#x27;s non-fiction travelogue &quot;Travels in Siberia&quot;, and works as a writer and humorist for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

==Biography==
Frazier grew up in Hudson, Ohio. His father, David Frazier, was a chemist, who worked for Sohio; his mother, Peggy, was a teacher, as well as an amateur actor and director, who performed in and directed plays in local Ohio theaters. He graduated from Western Reserve Academy in 1969 and from Harvard University in 1973.

==Writing career==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic James Gorman described Frazier&#x27;s 1996 humor collection &quot;Coyote v. Acme&quot; (in the title piece, Wile E. Coyote is suing Acme Corporation, the manufacturer of products such as explosives and rocket-propelled devices purchased by the coyote to aid in hunting the Road Runner; these products always backfire disastrously) as the occasion for &quot;irrepressible laughter in the reader&quot;. The piece served as the basis for the film &quot;Coyote vs. Acme&quot;, which is set to be claimed as a tax write-off by Warner Bros. Discovery. The film is currently looking for a new distributor. 
Gorman rates Frazier&#x27;s first collection, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Dating Your Mom&quot;, as &quot;one of the best collections of humor ever published&quot;.

== Awards ==
*1989: Whiting Award
*1997: Thurber Prize for American Humor, for essay collection &quot;Coyote vs. Acme&quot;
*2009: Thurber Prize for American Humor, for essay collection &quot;Lamentations of the Father&quot;

<doc id="1017976" wikidata="Q1303753" url="?curid=1017976" title="Anti-obesity medication">
<text>Anti-obesity medication or weight loss medications are pharmacological agents that reduce or control excess body fat. These medications alter one of the fundamental processes of the human body, weight regulation, by: reducing appetite and consequently energy intake, increasing energy expenditure, redirecting nutrients from adipose to lean tissue, or interfering with the absorption of calories.

Weight loss drugs have been developed since the early twentieth century, and many have been banned or withdrawn from the market due to adverse effects, including deaths; other drugs proved ineffective. Although many earlier drugs were stimulants such as amphetamines, in the early 2020s, GLP-1 receptor agonists became popular for weight loss.

The medications liraglutide, naltrexone/bupropion, orlistat, semaglutide, and tirzepatide are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for weight management in combination with reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. As of 2022, no medication has been shown to be as effective at long-term weight reduction as bariatric surgery.

==Mechanisms of action==
===Energy intake===
* 5-HT2C receptor agonists reduce appetite by working on serotonin receptors in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus. Lorcaserin (Belviq) was FDA approved for weight loss but was withdrawn from the market because a safety clinical trial shows an increased occurrence of cancer.
*Cannabinoid receptor antagonists were developed to treat obesity because researchers noticed that cannabinoid agonists (such as THC, the main pharmacologically active component of cannabis), increased appetite. However, some drugs in this class such as rimonabant were withdrawn or ceased development to concerns about mental health and suicide. More selective drugs—some are in development that act only in peripheral tissues, not the brain—may be able to achieve this result with fewer adverse effects.
* GLP-1 agonists such as tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide slow gastric emptying and also have neurologically driven effects on appetite. It is unknown if GLP-1 agonists or dual/triple agonists of GLP-1 and/or the glucagon or GIP receptors act solely by reducing energy intake or if they also increase energy expenditure.
*Setmelanotide is an agonist of the melanocortin 4 receptor and is used in people with certain rare genetic conditions that cause obesity. It is less effective and not approved for general obesity.
*Some weight loss drugs act on the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine to reduce appetite.

===Energy expenditure===

*Adrenergic agonists that work on the beta-2 adrenergic receptor increase energy expenditure. Although some such as clenbuterol are used without medical approval for weight loss, none have achieved approval for this indication due to cardiac risks. The anti-obesity effects of amphetamines, besides acting on the brain to reduce energy intake, are also mediated by the beta-2 adrenergic receptor. Ephedrine (and related compounds that are also active ingredients in ephedra preparations) exert their effects by acting directly and indirectly as adrenergic agonists.
*The discontinued drug 2,4-dinitrophenol works by increasing energy expenditure by decreasing the efficiency of mitochondria (uncoupling agent). A prodrug of DNP, HU6, has been tested in clinical trials for weight loss and fatty liver disease.
*Fibroblast growth factor-21 receptor agonists and drugs increasing FGF-21 activity are being investigated for obesity-related diseases; they can increase energy expenditure and several have been tested in humans.
*Thyroid hormones, another early weight loss drug, also raised energy expenditure but ceased to be used for weight loss due to cardiac risks and other adverse effects. Selective thyromimetics that work on the thyroid hormone receptor beta may be able to exert some of the beneficial thermogenic effects of thyroid hormones with fewer adverse effects, but none have received approval as of 2023.

===Both===
*Amylin analogues can both reduce energy intake and increase expenditure and can usefully be combined with leptin analogues for synergistic effect. The dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist cagrilintide, in combination with semaglutide, was more effective than semaglutide alone in promoting weight loss in clinical trials.
*Glucagon receptor agonists both reduce energy intake and increase energy expenditure in humans. They can cause hyperglycemia so it is recommended to combine them with a hypoglycemic drug, such as a GLP-1 or GIP receptor agonist.

===Other mechanisms===
*Bimagrumab, an experimental drug, works by inhibiting the action of myostatin, which limits the size of skeletal muscle. The drug has shown the ability to increase lean mass simultaneously to decreasing fat mass in obese humans, which is beneficial because it preserves or increases energy expenditure while reducing risks associated with excess fat.
*Orlistat (Xenical) and cetilistat reduce intestinal fat absorption by inhibiting pancreatic lipase, an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in the intestine. Without this enzyme, triglycerides from the diet are prevented from being hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids and are excreted undigested. Frequent oily bowel movements steatorrhea is a possible side effect of using Orlistat. Originally available only by prescription, it was approved by the FDA for over-the-counter sale in February 2007. In May 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a revised label for Xenical to include new safety information about rare cases of severe liver injury that have been reported with the use of this medication. A 2010 phase 2 trial found cetilistat significantly reduced weight and was better tolerated than orlistat.
*SGLT2 inhibitors cause the loss of glucose in the urine each day and are associated with a modest, sustained weight loss of in people with type 2 diabetes. The weight loss is less than expected due to compensatory increases in energy intake, but is additive when combined with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

==History==
The first described attempts at producing weight loss are those of Soranus of Ephesus, a Greek physician, in the second century AD. He prescribed elixirs of laxatives and purgatives, as well as heat, massage, and exercise. This remained the mainstay of treatment for well over a thousand years. It was not until the 1920s and 1930s that new treatments began to appear. Based on its effectiveness for hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone became a popular treatment for obesity in euthyroid people. It had a modest effect but produced the symptoms of hyperthyroidism as a side effect, such as palpitations and difficulty sleeping. 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP) was introduced in 1933; this worked by uncoupling the biological process of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, causing them to produce heat instead of ATP. Overdose caused fatal hyperthermia and DNP also caused cataracts in some users. After the passage of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938, the FDA banned DNP for human consumption.

Amphetamines (marketed as Benzedrine) became popular for weight loss during the late 1930s. They worked primarily by suppressing appetite, and had other beneficial effects such as increased alertness. Use of amphetamines increased over the subsequent decades, including Obetrol and culminating in the &quot;rainbow diet pill&quot; regime. This was a combination of multiple pills, all thought to help with weight loss, taken throughout the day. Typical regimens included stimulants, such as amphetamines, as well as thyroid hormone, diuretics, digitalis, laxatives, and often a barbiturate to suppress the side effects of the stimulants. In 1967/1968 a number of deaths attributed to diet pills triggered a Senate investigation and the gradual implementation of greater restrictions on the market. While rainbow diet pills were banned in the US in the late 1960s, they reappeared in South America and Europe in the 1980s. In 1959, phentermine had been FDA approved and fenfluramine in 1973. In the early 1990s two studies found that a combination of the drugs was more effective than either on its own; &quot;fen-phen&quot; became popular in the United States and had more than 18 million prescriptions in 1996. Evidence mounted that the combination could cause valvular heart disease in up to 30 percent of those who had taken it, leading to withdrawal of fen-phen and dexfenfluramine from the market in September 1997.

In the early 2020s, GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide or tirzepatide became popular for weight loss because they are more effective than earlier drugs, causing a shortage for patients prescribed these medications for type 2 diabetes, their original indication.

After the FDA approved semaglutide (Wegovy®) and tirzepatide (Zepbound®) for chronic weight management, GLP-1 medications became available through various virtual weight loss programs, one of which being LifeMD.

==Patient population==
The United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have approved weight loss medications for adults with either a body-mass index (BMI) of at least 30, or a body-mass index of at least 27 with at least one weight-related comorbidity. This patient population is considered to have sufficiently high baseline health risks to justify the use of anti-obesity medication.

The American Academy of Pediatrics had not previously supported the use of weight loss medication in adolescents but issued new guidelines in 2023. It now recommends considering the use of weight loss medication in some overweight children aged 12 or older. The European Medicines Agency has approved semaglutide for children aged 12 or older who have a BMI in the 95 percentile for their age and a weight of at least . However, GLP-1 agonists may not be cost effective in this population.

==Medication==

=== US FDA approved ===
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves anti-obesity medications as an adjunctive therapy to diet and exercise for people for whom lifestyle changes do not result in sufficient weight loss. In the United States, semaglutide (Wegovy) is approved by the FDA for chronic weight management. The FDA guidelines say that a therapy may be approved if it results in weight loss that is statistically significant greater than placebo and generally at least five percent of body weight over six months that comes predominantly from fat mass. Some other prescription weight loss medications are stimulants, which are recommended only for short-term use, and thus are of limited usefulness for patients who may need to reduce weight over months or years. As of 2022, there is no pathway for approval for drugs that reduce fat mass without 5 percent overall weight loss, even if they significantly improve metabolic health; neither is there one for drugs that help patients maintain weight loss although this can be more challenging than losing weight.

As of 2022, no medication has been discovered that would equal the effectiveness of bariatric surgery for long-term weight loss and improved health outcomes.
===Withdrawn===

===Never approved===

==Safety and side effects==
Some anti-obesity medications can have severe, even, lethal side effects, fen-phen being a famous example. Fen-phen was reported through the FDA to cause abnormal echocardiograms, heart valve problems, and rare valvular diseases. Out of 25 anti-obesity medications withdrawn from the market between 1964 and 2009, 23 acted by altering the functions of chemical neurotransmitters in the brain. The most common side effects of these drugs that led to withdrawals were mental disturbances, cardiac side effects, and drug abuse or drug dependence. Deaths were associated with seven products. Ephedra was removed from the US market in 2004 over concerns that it raises blood pressure and could lead to strokes and death.

<text>Frederick John Blight (30 July 1913 – 12 May 1995) was an Australian poet of Cornish origin, his ancestors having arrived in South Australia on the &quot;Lisander&quot;, in 1851. In the 1987 recording &quot;John Blight&quot;, he describes his Cornish background and its influence on his style.

==Biography==
Born in Unley, South Australia, on 30 July 1913, Blight was educated at Brisbane State High School. During the Great Depression in Australia he tramped the Queensland outback looking for work. During the 1930s he undertook correspondence studies and attained his Chartered Accountancy Diploma, whereby in 1939 he found paid employment in Bundaberg, Queensland.

Following his wartime years spent in Canberra as an Inspector with the Government&#x27;s Prices Regulatory Department, he became a part-owner of timber mills in the Gympie region. He took up full-time writing in 1973. In 1987 he was awarded the Order Of Australia Medal (AM) for his contribution to Literature and Education.

Blight received numerous awards, including the Dame Mary Gilmore Medal, Grace Leven Prize for Poetry, The Patrick White Literary Award and the Christopher Brennan Award. He died on 12 May 1995 in Brisbane, Queensland, being survived by his wife, Beverley Madeline D&#x27;Arcy-Irvine and their two daughters, Katrina and Robyn.

John Blight&#x27;s papers are held in the Fryer Library at The University of Queensland.

<doc id="1017982" wikidata="Q677202" url="?curid=1017982" title="Jan Brożek">
<text>Jan Brożek or Johannes Broscius (November 1585 – 21 November 1652) was the most prominent Polish mathematician of his era and an early biographer of Copernicus. He held numerous ecclesiastical offices in the Catholic Church and was associated with the Kraków Academy for his entire career.

==Life==
Brożek was born in Kurzelów, a village in south-central Poland. His father, Jakub, was an educated landowner who introduced Jan to the principles of geometry. He received his primary education in Kurzelow, then continued his education in Krakow. In 1604, he enrolled in the Kraków Academy (now Jagiellonian University), where he received his baccalaureate on 30 March 1605. In 1610, he earned a magister degree (equivalent to a doctorate). His association with the Belgian mathematician, Adriaan van Roomen, greatly influenced his studies.

In early 1614, Brożek was appointed professor of astrology at the Kraków Academy. In 1618 he travelled to Torun, Danzig and Frombork gathering material for a biography on Nicolaus Copernicus. He also became adept at land surveys. Between 1616 and 1620, Brożek surveyed the boundaries of Krakow’s bishopric and made measurements for maps of the Dominican Order’s property near Krakow.

Beginning in 1620, he studied medicine at Padua, Italy and earned a doctorate in 1623. In Padua, Brożek became friends with Giovanni Camillo Glorioso, who in 1613 had succeeded Galileo in the chair of mathematics at the university. Afterward he served as physician to the bishop of Krakow until 1625.

Around this time, Brożek became embroiled in a long-running dispute between the Jesuits and the university. He sided with the university&#x27;s efforts to maintain independence from Jesuit dominance. In 1625, he wrote a pamphlet, &quot;Gratis&quot;, that was critical of the Jesuits. The printer of the pamphlet was arrested, whipped and exiled from Krakow. Brożek escaped serious punishment only because of his association with the university. Between 1627 and 1635, Brożek wrote reports to Rome and made ten trips to Warsaw, advocating for university independence and petitioning the royal court to defend their rights.

In 1629 he was ordained a priest and then between 1632 and 1638 he served as custodian at the university library. In 1639 he donated his extensive personal library to the university and also provided a substantial sum of money to purchase additional books and instruments. Shortly afterwards, he gave up his professorship and moved to Międzyrzec Podlaski. However, in 1648 Brożek returned to Krakow University and received a masters in theology. He earned a doctor of theology in 1650.

In addition to his university positions, Brożek held a number of ecclesiastical positions. He became a canon of various collegiate churches in Krakow, and earned stipends from several priories. He was later nominated canon at the Wawel Cathedral, a significant and lucrative posting.

Brożek was appointed rector of the university in 1652, a prestigious assignment, but served only briefly. That same year the plague decimated the populace in Krakow and Brożek died on 21 November 1652.

Brożek bequeathed his substantial library and collection of scientific instruments to the university. The library consisted of some 400 volumes on scientific subjects and 300 volumes on humanistic topics. Many of these books have survived. He gifted at least 36 scientific instruments to the school, including surveying and drawing instruments, astronomical devices and clocks. Only three of these instruments are still held by the university, most notably a mechanical armillary sphere known as the Globus Jagellonicus.

One of the Jagiellonian University&#x27;s buildings, the Collegium Broscianum, is named in his honor.

==Fields of contribution==
===Mathematics===
He was the most prominent Polish mathematician of the 17th century, working on the theory of numbers (particularly perfect numbers) and geometry. While studying perfect numbers, he postulated theorems which were the special cases of the then-unknown Fermat&#x27;s little theorem. He also studied medicine, theology and geodesy. Among the problems he addressed was why bees create hexagonal honeycombs; he demonstrated that this is the most efficient way of using wax and storing honey.

===Biography===
He contributed to a greater knowledge of Nicolaus Copernicus&#x27; theories and was his ardent supporter and early prospective biographer. Around 1618 he visited the chapter at Warmia and with the knowledge of Prince-Bishop Simon Rudnicki took from there a number of letters and documents in order to publish them, which he never did. He contributed to a better version of a short biography of Copernicus by Simon Starowolski. &quot;Following his death, his entire collection was lost&quot;; thus &quot;Copernicus&#x27; unpublished work probably suffered the greatest damage at the hands of Johannes Broscius.&quot;

Brożek wrote a biography of Stanislaw Grzepski, a sixteenth-century Polish mathematician and philologist. He also planned to write a history of the Kraków Academy but only fragments of a manuscript have been found.

== Works ==
Brożek was the author of more than thirty publications, all of them written in Latin. As was common among scholars in his era, he published his works under a Latinized version of his name, Johannes Broscius.

<text>Barcroft Henry Thomas Boake (26 March 1866 – 2 May 1892) was an Australian stockman and poet who wrote primarily within the bush poetry tradition. He was active for only a few years before his suicide at the age of 26.

Boake was born in Sydney to Irish-born professional photographer Barcroft Capel Boake; his mother died when he was thirteen. Educated at private schools, including a brief period in New Caledonia, Boake left home at the age of 17 and was apprenticed as a surveyor&#x27;s draughtsman. He disliked clerical work and in 1886 moved to the Monaro to work as an assistant surveyor. He later worked as a boundary rider and drover in the Outback. He returned to Sydney in early 1892 and hanged himself with a stockwhip a few months later.

Boake was first published in late 1890 and regularly appeared in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; prior to his death, with the posthumous publication of &quot;Where the Dead Men Lie, and Other Poems&quot; in 1897 bringing his work to a wider audience. His poems feature Outback settings and many of his best received works incorporate the subject of death. &quot;Where the Dead Men Lie&quot; is one of Australia&#x27;s most anthologised poems and popularised the term &quot;Never Never&quot; as a nickname for the Outback. Contemporary reviewers of Boake found his work to be inconsistent, but identified elements of brilliance and lamented his early death.

== Biography ==
===Childhood===

Boake was born on 26 March 1866 in his parents&#x27; home at Waterview Bay in Balmain, New South Wales. He was the first child of Florence Eva () and Barcroft Capel Boake. His father was born in Ireland and arrived in the colony of Victoria in 1857. He moved to Sydney in 1862 where he was a professional photographer, initially with Freeman Bros and then with his own studio. His mother was born in Australia, the daughter of an East India Company sailor.

Boake&#x27;s father established his own photography studio shortly after his son&#x27;s birth, and the family settled at Lavender Bay on Sydney&#x27;s North Shore. He had eight younger siblings, of whom three died in infancy. Boake grew up on Sydney Harbour and was a good swimmer and boatsman. As a child he was known as &quot;Bartie&quot;. At the age of eight he fell through a window leaving a permanent scar running from his eyelid to his scalp. As he grew older he would explore the then-wilderness of the Middle Harbour on foot, horseback or afloat, with friends or alone. He stood around , according to his father being &quot;of medium stature and slight build although strong and hardy&quot;.

Boake began his education at a day school in Milsons Point. In 1876, aged 10, he was sent to live in the French colony of New Caledonia for 18 months, boarding with his father&#x27;s friend Allan Hughan who had been appointed government photographer in Nouméa. He was &quot;put to a French school and made to learn the language&quot;, in which he became proficient. He returned to his family in 1878, with Assimul, a young Kanak boy who subsequently worked in Boake&#x27;s father&#x27;s studio for two years. Before their departure Assimul had given Boake a tattoo of his mother&#x27;s initials.

By the time Boake returned to Australia, his family had moved a short distance to North Willoughby. His mother died of puerperal fever in November 1879 after delivering twin sons, one of whom died a month later; the other was born with a mental disability and died as a teenager. After his mother&#x27;s death his maternal grandmother Matilda Clarke moved in with the family and took over running the household.

Boake attended Sydney Grammar School for two terms in 1878, but changed schools due to the difficulty of reaching the campus from the North Shore. He was subsequently sent to a private school in Hunter Street run by Edward Blackmore, which he attended for five years until the age of seventeen. According to Boake&#x27;s entry in the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot;, his father &quot;profoundly distrusted state schools&quot; and schooled his son accordingly.

===Adulthood===
After leaving school, Boake was apprenticed to James Reece as a draughtsman where he learned technical drawing. In March 1885 he passed the government examination and was employed as a temporary draughtsman in the Survey Office on £120 per year (). His father later recalled that he &quot;became very weary at his office life and of the hopeless inactivity of his fellow clerks&quot;. At the age of 18, Boake inherited a then-significant sum of £200 (), half of which was lost gambling on horse racing and half of which was lent to Reece and never recovered. He was extremely distressed when he had to reveal the losses to his father and considered the situation to be the main driver in him leaving Sydney for the country. In July 1886 Boake took up a position as a field assistant to Edwin Commins, based out of Adaminaby on the Monaro. He developed a friendship with the McKeahnie family of Rosedale Station, which comprised Alexander and Mary McKeahnie and their six children, including Charlie McKeahnie who has been identified as a possible model for Banjo Paterson&#x27;s &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;.

Boake&#x27;s term with Commins ended in August 1888, after which he took work as a station hand at Mullah Station near Trangie. His responsibilities included sheep shearing, mustering, and , and he also learned some wool classing. Mullah experienced a drought over the Australian summer of 1888–89, and in a letter to his father Boake recalled his experience fighting a bush fire. However he became dissatisfied with the slow pace of station life during the off-season, finding himself unoccupied for hours each day.

By May 1889 Boake had left Mullah Station and headed north to Queensland to seek droving work, moving cattle across the Outback between pastoral leases or to processing facilities. His first assignment saw him join a gang taking 1,100 of James Rutherford&#x27;s cattle from Davenport Downs Station on the Diamantina River south to another of his properties south of Cunnamulla. In May 1890, Boake joined W. A. Lipscomb, a surveyor, and remained with him until the end of 1891. About this time he began to send verses to &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, which were published. Boake&#x27;s term with Lipscomb ended in December 1891, after which he returned to Sydney to live with his father.

===Death===
Boake is believed to have died by suicide. His body was found hanging by the neck from a stockwhip at Long Bay, North Sydney, eight days after he disappeared on 2 May 1892. Boake was interred at St Thomas&#x27; Cemetery with his mother and siblings. His grave was initially unmarked, as his father had no money, but in 1897 Boake&#x27;s publisher A. G. Stephens arranged for the grave to be kerbed and turfed and for a headstone to be erected. One writer on Boake&#x27;s life has mentioned that the suicide took place during the 1891–93 depression when the poet was unable to find work, also noting that &quot;it has been suggested that he killed himself for the love of one of the McKeahnie girls&quot;, sisters of the horseman Charlie McKeahnie.

==Poetry==

Boake developed an interest in poetry through his father, who described himself as &quot;fond of stringing rhymes&quot; and had several ballads and odes appear in local publications. As a child he and his father would collaborate by each writing alternative lines of poetry. He read widely, with his influences including Australian writers Adam Lindsay Gordon, Marcus Clarke and Rolf Boldrewood. Boake&#x27;s earliest surviving poem is a four-line verse dedicated to Matilda Kate Rout, a photographic colourist five years his senior with whom he became close in 1883. It was placed in a locket together with photographs of the pair, with Rout retaining the locket until her death. It was donated to the Mitchell Library by Rout&#x27;s daughter in 1962.

&quot;Where the Dead Men Lie&quot; has been described as Boake&#x27;s &quot;signature poem&quot;. It is one of the most anthologised Australian poems, appearing in numerous national anthologies in the 20th and 21st centuries, although few other Boake poems have featured. It helped popularise the term &quot;Never Never&quot; as a term for the Australian outback. Boake&#x27;s 1892 poem &quot;Jimmy Wood&quot; has been cited by &quot;The Australian National Dictionary&quot; as the origin of the term &quot;&quot; for a person drinking alone in a pub.

===Themes===
A number of Boake&#x27;s poems concern death, with their subjects either dying or musing on the prospects of divine judgment and an afterlife. Ian Mair, literary critic for &quot;The Age&quot;, placed Boake in Romantic poetry&#x27;s tradition of &quot;loving death&quot; but concluded that Boake&#x27;s &quot;personality and career were overshadowed by mortality and its images&quot;.

===Publication history===
No collection of Boake&#x27;s works was published during his lifetime and there are no authoritative versions of several of his poems. &quot;Bulletin&quot; literary critic A. G. Stephens adopted the role of literary executor and edited &quot;Where the Dead Men Lie, and Other Poems&quot;, which was published by Angus &amp; Robertson in 1897 as part of a series on Australian poets. The collection, which included a brief biography, was reprinted twice and reportedly sold over 2,000 copies. A second edition, also edited by Stephens, was published in 1913, with four additional poems included and some previous notes altered or removed. Clement Semmler published a brief biography of Boake in 1966, while later efforts include a semi-fictionalised biography by Hugh Capel published in 2002, and an expanded collection and biography by Bill Refshauge published in 2007.

Stephens&#x27; role as Boake&#x27;s editor and literary executor has been scrutinised by later writers. In the 1960s, Semmler alleged in &quot;Australian Literary Studies&quot; that Stephens had removed entire passages of Boake&#x27;s original works and substituted his own verse. Semmler&#x27;s conclusions were disputed in a response by Stephens&#x27; daughter Alison. Stephens also sold off some of Boake&#x27;s papers – including manuscripts for published poems – as he experienced financial difficulties later in life, which are now considered lost.

Boake wrote under the name &quot;Surcingle&quot; – a component of horse tack – until early 1892, only months before his death. Owing to his use of a pseudonym and an absence of original manuscripts, editors have faced attribution difficulties and a number of poems have been wrongly attributed to Boake in various publications.

===Reception===
James Brunton Stephens praised Boake and endorsed the comments of a reviewer in &quot;The Queenslander&quot; that Boake &quot;could express the most dreadful sentiments in a way that might almost be termed pleasant&quot;.

However, Cecil Hadgraft, the author of Boake&#x27;s &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot; entry, observed that it was &quot;at least arguable that he died when he had written his best poetry&quot;.

<text>Stefan Władysław Bryła (: ; born 17 August 1886 in Kraków – died 3 December 1943 in Warsaw, Poland) was a Polish construction engineer and welding pioneer. He designed and built the first welded road bridge in the world.

==Biography==
Bryła was a professor at the Lwów University of Technology from 1927 and at the Warsaw University of Technology from 1934. Bryła was the author of basic methods of welding steel structures.

In 1927 he designed the Maurzyce Bridge, first welded road bridge in the world. The bridge was erected across the Słudwia River in Maurzyce near Łowicz, Poland in 1929. It was still in use in 1977 at which point plans were undertaken to replace it with a wider structure. Consequently, the bridge was reinstalled as a historical monument at a site slightly upstream. In 1995, the American Welding Society presented a Historic Welded Structure Award for the bridge to Poland. He also designed high rise buildings: Drapacz Chmur in Katowice and the Prudential in Warsaw in 1932.

During World War II, Bryła taught at the Secret Universities. His teaching there led to his arrest by the Germans on 16 November 1943, together with his family. After a brief incarceration in the Pawiak prison, he was subsequently executed during the Action AB by the Germans in Warsaw on 3 December 1943 at 13 Puławska Street. His commemorative grave is located at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.

<text>The Pacific island nation Nauru first competed at the Summer Olympic Games in the 1996 games in Atlanta. It is the least populated nation in the 206-member International Olympic Committee. The nation is mainly known for its weightlifting tradition and all seven athletes that had competed for Nauru at the Olympics before 2012 were weightlifters. The nation has never participated in any Winter Olympic Games. 

Under the leadership of Vinson Detenamo, the Olympic movement began in Nauru in the early 1990s. The Olympic Committee was established in 1991 and talks with the International Olympic Committee started the same year. In May 1994 Nauru presented its bid to join the IOC and in September 1994 the nation was accepted, clearing the path for participation in the 1996 games.

1996 was not the first time that Nauru athletes participated in the Olympics. After his win in the 1990 Commonwealth Games, weightlifter Marcus Stephen petitioned for citizenship of Samoa to compete in the 1992 games. Stephen competed for Nauru at the Olympics in 1996 and 2000, placing 11th in the 62 kg category in 2000. In 2009, he replaced Vinson Detenamo as president of Nauru&#x27;s National Olympic Committee.

Paul Coffa is the weightlifting coach of the Oceania Weightlifting Federation and has been Nauru&#x27;s Olympic coach since 1994.

<doc id="1018003" wikidata="Q623726" url="?curid=1018003" title="California State Route 163">
<text>State Route 163 (SR 163), or the Cabrillo Freeway, is a state highway in San Diego, California. The stretch of the former US 395 freeway runs from downtown San Diego just south of an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5), extending north through historic Balboa Park and various neighborhoods of San Diego to an interchange with I-15 in the neighborhood of Miramar. The freeway is named after Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, the first European to navigate the coast of present-day California.

The historic section of freeway through Balboa Park south of I-8 was the first freeway in San Diego County and one of the first in California. Prior to 1964, this was the southernmost section of U.S. Route 395 (US 395), which was truncated to Hesperia when it was replaced by I-15. This section is also designated as a State Scenic Highway.

==Route description==

SR 163 begins in downtown San Diego at an at-grade intersection with A Street and 11th Avenue. Shortly after, the freeway has an interchange with I-5 before entering Balboa Park. This section of SR 163 is built to parkway standards, featuring a wide, grassy median with trees, four through traffic lanes, and several very sharp curves, also passing under the Cabrillo Bridge. Shortly after leaving Balboa Park, SR 163 has an interchange with I-8 in Mission Valley. North of this interchange, SR 163 becomes a modern, Interstate-standard, eight-lane freeway. Continuing north, the freeway climbs uphill from Mission Valley to Linda Vista, where it has a partial interchange with I-805; traffic northbound on one freeway can only transfer only onto northbound of the other and southbound traffic can only transfer onto southbound direction of the other freeway. In Kearny Mesa, the freeway has a partial interchange with SR 52, one of the biggest bottlenecks in San Diego County. The freeway then heads north to and merges with I-15 near Miramar, where the southern terminus of the high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes of I-15 are located. Ramps were built to allow traffic on SR 163 to enter and exit the express lanes of I-15.

SR 163 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 163 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, and is designated as a scenic highway in Balboa Park by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a &quot;memorable landscape&quot; with no &quot;visual intrusions&quot;, where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.

==History==

The southernmost portion of the highway, running through Balboa Park, began construction in 1942 and opened in 1948 as part of US 395; it was the first freeway in San Diego County and one of the first in California. The Cabrillo Freeway was also part of US 80 from the late 1940s until 1964. This stretch of road has been called one of America&#x27;s most beautiful parkways, and was designated a California Historic Parkway in 2002.

On May 17, 1995, former US soldier and plumber Shawn Nelson stole a tank from the National Guard armory and went on a destructive rampage throughout San Diego. Driving onto SR 163, the tank was eventually disabled when it became stuck on a traffic barrier, where Nelson was shot and killed by San Diego police.

<text>Heteropyxis is a genus which includes three species of small evergreen trees. It was previously placed alone in family Heteropyxidaceae, but is now placed basally within Myrtaceae. The species of &quot;Heteropyxis&quot; are native to southern Africa.

&quot;Heteropyxis natalensis&quot;, commonly known as lavender tree or &quot;laventelboom&quot;, ranges from Zimbabwe through Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal of South Africa. It is a slender, upright tree which grows 5–7 metres in height, at forest margins, rocky outcrops, hillsides, and termite mounds. It bears panicles of fragrant flowers, cream to pale yellow in colour, from December to March.

Many classification schemes place &quot;Heteropyxis&quot; within family Myrtaceae. Recent embryological and DNA analyses seem to indicate that &quot;Heteropyxis&quot; and &quot;Psiloxylon&quot;, the sole member of family Psiloxylaceae are sister taxa to the Myrtaceae, but diverged before the origin of the common ancestor of the Myrtaceae.

<doc id="1018018" wikidata="Q15178216" url="?curid=1018018" title="Burzynski Clinic">
<text>The Burzynski Clinic is a clinic selling an unproven cancer treatment, which has been characterized as harmful quackery. It was founded in 1976 and is located in Houston, Texas, in the United States. It offers a form of chemotherapy originally called &quot;antineoplaston therapy&quot; devised by the clinic&#x27;s founder Stanislaw Burzynski in the 1970s. &quot;Antineoplaston&quot; is Burzynski&#x27;s term for a group of urine-derived peptides, peptide derivatives, and mixtures. There is no accepted scientific evidence of benefit from antineoplaston combinations for various diseases, and the Clinic&#x27;s claimed successes have not been replicated by independent researchers. The therapy has been rebranded in various ways over the years to mirror fashions in medicine, for example as a kind of &quot;immunotherapy&quot;. The therapy is administered through the ruse of running a large numbers of clinical trials, which long-time Burzynski lawyer Richard Jaffe has described as &quot;a joke&quot;.

The clinic has been the focus of criticism primarily due to the way its antineoplaston therapy is promoted, the costs for people with cancer participating in trials of antineoplastons and problems with the way these trials are run. Legal cases have been brought as a result of the sale of the therapy without regulatory approval.

Burzynski is also the president and founder of a pharmaceutical company, the Burzynski Research Institute, which manufactures his antineoplaston drugs.

==Stanislaw Burzynski==

Stanislaw Rajmund Burzynski was born in 1943. In 1967, Burzynski graduated from the Medical Academy in Lublin, Poland. In 1968, he received another degree. Burzynski claims this degree was a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but cancer researcher Saul Green found evidence indicating he received a D.Msc. (Doctor of Medical Science) after a one-year project and passage of a test.

Burzynski moved to the United States in 1970 and worked at Baylor College of Medicine until 1977. That year, he established the Burzynski Research Laboratory, where he began administering so-called antineoplaston therapy. Initially, the protocol was administered to 21 patients, but it was later offered more widely as an &quot;experimental&quot; therapy. This opened him up to &quot;charges of unethical conduct and to the suspicion he had become a merchant of false hope&quot;, which led to several instances of media controversy.

Burzynski incorporated his pharmaceutical company, the Burzynski Research Institute, in 1984. Reviewers of his scientific papers have disputed the design of the trials and scientific validity of the published results.

In February 2017, following lengthy hearings, the Texas Medical Board recommended Burzynski&#x27;s medical license be revoked, with the revocation suspended, and a fine of $360,000 for billing irregularities and other violations.

Burzynski was married to Barbara Burzynski, also a physician, until her death in 2021. They had three children, including Gregory Burzynski, a physician. Both Gregory and Barbara became board members of the Burzynski Research Institute and worked at the Burzynski Clinic.

==Antineoplaston therapy==

&quot;Antineoplaston&quot; is a name coined by Burzynski for a group of peptides, peptide derivatives, and mixtures that he uses as an alternative cancer treatment. The word is derived from &quot;neoplasm&quot;. A &quot;Reuters&quot; fact-check concluded that &quot;Online claims that the drugs are a cancer &#x27;cure&#x27; and that any of them has been FDA-approved, are misleading.&quot;

Although the therapy is promoted as natural and benign, it is in reality a form of chemotherapy with harmful side effects including severe neurotoxicity.

Though Burzynski first injected patients with his peptides in 1977, antineoplastons have never been approved for general use. The compounds are not licensed as drugs but are instead sold and administered as part of clinical trials at the Burzynski Clinic and the Burzynski Research Institute.

Burzynski stated that he began investigating the use of antineoplastons after detecting what he considered significant differences in the presence of peptides between the blood of cancer patients and a control group. He first identified antineoplastons from human blood. Since similar peptides had been isolated from urine, early batches of Burzynski&#x27;s treatment were isolated from urine. Burzynski has since produced the compounds synthetically.

The first active peptide fraction identified was called antineoplaston A-10 (3-phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedione). From A-10, antineoplaston AS2-1 was derived – a 4:1 mixture of phenylacetic acid and phenylacetylglutamine. The Burzynski Clinic website states that the active ingredient of antineoplaston A10-I is phenylacetylglutamine.

Since 2011, the clinic has marketed itself as offering &quot;personalized gene-targeted cancer therapy&quot;, which has stirred further controversy. David Gorski argues that the concept of &quot;personalised cancer therapy&quot; is &quot;more of a marketing term than a scientifically meaningful description&quot;. According to Gorski, a research oncologist, it appears unlikely that the Burzynski clinic would indeed be able to actually personalise gene-targeting therapies, i.e., &quot;identify who would benefit from specific targeted therapies simply from blood tests,&quot; as Burzynski claims, since there are no proven methods to achieve this. Consequently, many reject Burzynski&#x27;s claim of offering personalized medicine, because in reality his patients are administered untested combinations of various approved and unapproved medications, without a sound rationale for a given combination and without &quot;any concern for potential adverse reactions&quot;.

 the Clinic refreshed the branding of its offering to include the word &quot;immunotherapy&quot; in an attempt to leverage the popular excitement around cancer immunotherapy. The treatment however remains the same, using antineoplastons.

===Clinical trials===
According to the National Cancer Institute, as of August 2019, &quot;no phase III randomized, controlled trials of antineoplastons as a treatment for cancer have been conducted. Publications have taken the form of case reports, phase I clinical trials, toxicity studies, and phase II clinical trials&quot;, and &quot;for the most part, these publications have been authored by the developer of the therapy, Dr. Burzynski, in conjunction with his associates at the Burzynski Clinic. Although these studies often report remissions, other investigators have not been successful in duplicating these results.&quot;

From 1991 to 1995, the NCI initiated multiple phase II trials of antineoplastons. In 1995, after over $1 million had been spent on these trials, they were stopped due to fundamental conflicts between NCI investigators and Burzynski and his employees, notably around Burzynski&#x27;s insistence on approving all protocols in the NCI trial.

Since the mid-1990s, Burzynski registered some sixty clinical trials of antineoplastons and, in December 2010, a Phase III trial that did not open for patient recruitment. The results of these trials are seldom published in reputable journals, and the few that have been do not confirm the worth of the clinic&#x27;s treatments. The aim of registering so many trials, according to the 2008 book of long-time Burzynski lawyer Richard Jaffe, was to allow for treating any cancer Burzynski might want to treat.

The largest trial Burzynski registered was called CAN-1 and aimed to cover all clinic patients at that time. Jaffe wrote that CAN-1 was &quot;a joke&quot; of a clinical trial and explained the legal maneuvering:
All trials were paused (no new patients allowed) following a 2013 FDA inspection which found (for the third consecutive time) significant issues with his Institutional Review Board, and, according to reporting published in November 2013, substantial issues with the conduct of both the clinic and Burzynski as principal investigator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Szabo_11/15/2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efficacy===

Although Burzynski and his associates claim success in the use of antineoplaston combinations for the treatment of various diseases, and some of the clinic&#x27;s patients say they have been helped, there is no clinical evidence of the efficacy of these methods. The consensus among the professional community, as represented by the American Cancer Society and Cancer Research UK is that antineoplaston therapy is unproven, and the overall probability of the treatment turning out to be as claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than 35 years of investigation. Antineoplaston treatments have significant known side effects including severe neurotoxicity. Hypernatremia is also a significant risk given the high levels of sodium in antineoplaston infusions.

Independent scientists have been unable to reproduce the positive results reported in Burzynski&#x27;s studies: NCI observed that researchers other than Burzynski and his associates have not been successful in duplicating his results, and Cancer Research UK states that &quot;available scientific evidence does not support claims that antineoplaston therapy is effective in treating or preventing cancer.&quot;

There is no convincing evidence from randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature that antineoplastons are useful treatments of cancer, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved these products for the treatment of any disease. The American Cancer Society has stated since 1983 that there is no evidence that antineoplastons have any beneficial effects on cancer and recommended that people not buy these products since there could be serious health consequences. A 2004 medical review described antineoplaston treatment as a &quot;disproven therapy&quot;.

In 1998, three oncologists were enlisted by the weekly Washington newsletter &quot;The Cancer Letter&quot; to conduct independent reviews of Burzynski&#x27;s clinical trial research on antineoplastons. They concluded that the studies were poorly designed, not interpretable, and &quot;so flawed that it cannot be determined whether it really works&quot;. One of them characterized the research as &quot;scientific nonsense&quot;. In addition to questioning Burzynski&#x27;s research methods, the oncologists found significant and possibly life-threatening toxicity in some patients treated with antineoplastons.

In 2018 an article in &quot;The Lancet Oncology&quot; said &quot;This quackery has continued for 40 years and caused serious harm to desperate patients. Enough is enough!&quot;.

According to the American Cancer Society, &quot;Treatment can cost from $7,000 to $9,500 per month or more, depending on the type of treatment, number of consultations, and the need for surgery to implant a catheter for drug delivery. Available information suggests that health insurance plans often do not reimburse costs linked to this treatment.&quot; As of March 2015, the Burzynski Clinic required patients to provide a deposit before treatment starts, and their website informed patients that &quot;Since we are classified as &#x27;out of network&#x27; we are unable to accept Medicare, Medicaid and any HMO insurance.&quot;

Recent criticism has focused on the use of crowdfunding to raise the costs of quack treatments, including specifically hundreds of thousands of dollars in the case of the Burzynski Clinic.

== Legal issues ==

===FDA warnings===

In 1978, FDA representatives warned Burzynski that he was violating federal law because he was not administering antineoplastons in the context of a clinical trial. In 1981, FDA wrote in a letter, &quot;the FDA advises persons who inquire about Burzynski’s alleged cure that we do not believe the drug is fit for administration to humans and that there is no reason to believe Dr. Burzynski has discovered an effective cure for cancer.&quot;

In 1996, Burzynski&#x27;s use and advertising of antineoplastons as an unapproved cancer therapy were deemed to be unlawful by the U.S. FDA and the Texas Attorney General, and limits on the sale and advertising of the treatment were imposed as a result.

In 2009, the FDA issued a warning letter to the Burzynski Research Institute, stating that an investigation had determined the Burzynski Institutional Review Board (IRB) &quot;did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and FDA regulations governing the protection of human subjects.&quot; It identified a number of specific findings, among them that the IRB had approved research without ensuring risk to patients was minimized, had failed to prepare required written procedures or retain required documentation, and had failed to conduct required continuing reviews for studies, among others. The institute was given fifteen days to identify the steps it would take to prevent future violations.

Another warning issued in October 2012 notes that the Burzynski Clinic is advertising investigational drugs as being &quot;safe and effective&quot;, noting: 

The letter requires cessation of non-compliant promotional activities, including the use of testimonials and promotional interviews with Burzynski himself.

In June 2012, antineoplaston trials were paused following the death of a child patient. In January and February 2013, the FDA inspected Burzynski and his IRB in Houston. In December 2013, the FDA issued its findings in warning letters to Burzynski, expressing &quot;concerns about subject safety and data integrity, as well as concerns about the adequacy of safeguards in place at your site to protect patients...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Szabo_12/11/2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013 the FDA released the observational notes from an inspection of Burzynski as a principal investigator that took place between January and March 2013. Among the findings were &quot;[failure] to comply with protocol requirements related to the primary outcome, therapeutic response [...], for 67% of study subjects reviewed during the inspection&quot;, admitting patients who failed to meet inclusion criteria, failing to stop treatment when patients had severe toxic reactions to antineoplastons, and failure to report all adverse events. Further, the FDA told Burzynski, &quot;You failed to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under your care. Forty-eight (48) subjects experienced 102 investigational overdoses between January 1, 2005 and February 22, 2013 [...] There is no documentation to show that you have implemented corrective actions during this time period to ensure the safety and welfare of subjects.” The FDA also observed that Burzynski had denied patients informed consent by not informing them of extra costs that they might incur during treatment and that he could not account for his stock of the investigational drug. Lastly, the FDA observed: &quot;Your [...] tumor measurements initially recorded on worksheets at baseline and on-study treatment [...] studies for all study subjects were destroyed and are not available for FDA inspectional review&quot;, meaning that there was no way for the FDA to verify either initial tumor sizes or effects that the antineoplastons may have had.

In Burzynski&#x27;s written response to the 2013 FDA investigation, he states that the investigators &#x27;&quot;complied with all criteria for evaluation of response and made accurate assessments for tumor response.&quot;&#x27;

In December 2013, the FDA issued two warning letters, one to the Burzynski Institutional Review Board and one to Burzynski, the subjects of the investigations in February. The FDA found that Burzynski and the IRB had largely failed to address the concerns identified in the initial observation reports. The letter to Burzynski noted serious problems with medical files with respect to 6-year-old Josia Cotto, a young brain tumor patient who died while being treated by Burzynski with the sodium-rich antineoplastons and whose death apparently initiated the investigation. &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that Cotto&#x27;s blood sodium was measured before his death at &quot;a level that is typically fatal&quot;, but the Burzynski Clinic claimed that the measurement was erroneous.

On March 23, 2014, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that the FDA had decided to permit &quot;a handful&quot; of cancer patients to receive Burzynski&#x27;s treatment provided that the patients did not receive the treatment directly from him.

David Gorski wrote in 2014 that over four decades the FDA and state medical boards have been unable to shut down Burzynkski&#x27;s business selling unproven treatments – &quot;these organizations are supposed to protect the public from practitioners like Burzynski, but all too often they fail at their charges, in this case spectacularly.&quot;

The Burzynski Clinic has also made use of expanded access petitions, also known as compassionate use exemptions. According to an investigative report by STAT News published in August 2016, the clinic has benefited by politicians who lobbied the FDA to allow Burzynski to sell antineoplastons to families of patients with terminal diagnoses. According to FDA documents obtained by STAT, &quot;From 2011 to 2016, 37 members of Congress wrote to the FDA about Burzynski. [...] Most of the lawmakers asked the agency to grant constituents &#x27;compassionate use exemptions&#x27; so that they could try his unapproved drugs, or to allow his clinical trials to proceed.&quot; According to Burzynski, &quot;interventions by lawmakers were helpful.&quot; According to STAT, critics state that &quot;the congressional advocacy risks giving the terminally ill and their families a false sense of hope, while also conferring a measure of legitimacy on him that many believe he does not deserve.&quot;

However, FDA expanded access petitions were not always granted. Burzynski attempted to avoid FDA oversight by recruiting patients under Texas&#x27;s &quot;Right to try&quot; law, which was passed in 2015.

===Texas Medical Board===

In December 2010, the use of chemotherapeutic agents by the clinic has been characterized as &quot;random&quot; and their use of unapproved combinations &quot;with no known benefits but clear harms&quot; by the Texas Medical Board, which regulates and licenses physicians in the state of Texas, led to a case against Burzynski by that board. Burzynski was acquitted because he had not personally written the prescriptions.

In July 2014, the board filed a 202-page complaint against Burzynski to the Texas State Office of Administrative Hearings. The complaint addressed allegations by the Board including misleading patients into paying exorbitant charges, misrepresenting unlicensed persons to patients as licensed medical doctors, and misleading patients into accepting care from providers without significant education or training related to cancer treatment. Citing examples of problems with 29 patients, which were listed in the document, the board said that &quot;unapproved combinations of highly toxic chemotherapy&quot; were prescribed &quot;in ways that caused harm to several patients.&quot; In July 2015, Burzynski&#x27;s counsel, Richard Jaffe, withdrew from the case citing a potential conflict of interest, a result of Jaffe&#x27;s pursuing actions against Burzynski in bankruptcy court. With the addition of replacement counsel, the hearing was set to begin in November 2015.

In November 2015, the Texas Medical Board took Burzynski to court in Houston, Texas. Burzynski was accused of bait-and-switch tactics, improperly charging patients, not informing patients that he owns the pharmacy they were required to use to fill their medications, and of off-label prescribing of drugs. Burzynski&#x27;s former attorney Richard Jaffe has filed suit in Federal Court claiming unpaid legal fees of over $250,000. Burzynski through his current attorney denied all charges.

On March 3, 2017, the Texas Medical Board sanctioned Burzynski, placing him on probation and fining him $40,000. After being sanctioned for over 130 violations, he was allowed to keep his medical license and to continue to practice. Staff recommendations had been more punitive.&lt;ref name=&quot;TMB_2/15/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Probation terms included additional medical training, disclosure of the Board&#x27;s ruling to patients and medical facilities, and monitoring of his patient records.

===Lawsuits===

In 1983, a federal court issued an injunction against Burzynski, barring him from shipping antineoplastons in interstate commerce without FDA approval. Burzynski continued to use antineoplastons and was charged with 75 federal counts of mail fraud and violations of federal drug laws. In 1994, a 20-day trial resulted in the dismissal of the 34 counts of mail fraud. On the other 41 counts, the jury deadlocked, failing to come to a verdict. In a separate administrative proceeding, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners charged Burzynski with violations of Texas state law relating to his use of antineoplastons. An administrative law judge ruled that Burzynski violated a section of the Texas Health and Safety Code dealing with prescriptions for unapproved drugs. The Texas Court of Appeals ultimately upheld this determination in a 1996 decision.

In 1994, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed a lower court decision that Burzynski had defrauded a health insurance fund into reimbursing about $90,000 for antineoplaston treatment. The appeals court ruled that Burzynski &quot;may not trick the plaintiff into paying for an unlawful, unapproved drug.&quot;

In 1998, a federal judge ordered that Burzynski repay an insurance company over $200,000 he charged six patients for his unapproved treatments. The judge concluded that Burzynski was &quot;unjustly enriched&quot; by the insurance payments, but that the violations did not rise to fraud or misrepresentation.

In 1998, the parents of a 10-year-old girl with brain cancer sued Burzynski for fraud, saying he had misled them about the efficacy of his treatments. The girl, Christina Bedient, died of cancer after being treated with antineoplastons in 1996. Burzynski settled the suit by refunding some of the family&#x27;s expenses.

In December 2010, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners filed a multi-count complaint in the Texas State Office of Administrative Hearings against Burzynski for failure to meet state medical standards. In November 2012, a Texas State Office of Administrative Hearings administrative law judge ruled that Burzynski was not vicariously liable under Texas administrative law for the actions of staff at the clinic.

In January 2012, Lola Quinlan, an elderly, stage IV cancer patient, sued Burzynski for using false and misleading tactics to &quot;swindle her out of $100,000&quot;. She also sued his companies, The Burzynski Clinic, the Burzynski Research Institute, and Southern Family Pharmacy, in Harris County Court. She sued for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, deceptive trade and conspiracy. The case was dismissed after Quinlan died.

=== Legal threats to online critics ===

In November 2011, a music writer and editor for the British newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot; sought help raising £200,000 to have his 4-year-old niece, who was diagnosed with glioma, treated at the Burzynski Clinic. Several bloggers reported other cases of patients who had spent similar amounts of money on the treatment, and had died, and challenged the validity of Burzynski&#x27;s treatments. Marc Stephens, identifying himself as a representative of the Burzynski Clinic, sent emails accusing them of libel and demanding that coverage of Burzynski be removed from their sites. One of the bloggers who received threatening e-mails from Stephens was Rhys Morgan, a 17-year-old sixth-form student from Cardiff, Wales, at the time, previously noted for exposing the Miracle Mineral Supplement. Another was Andy Lewis, a skeptic and publisher of the Quackometer blog.

Following the publicity fallout resulting from the legal threats made by Stephens against the bloggers, the Burzynski Clinic issued a press release on November 29, 2011, confirming that the Clinic had hired Stephens &quot;to provide web optimization services and to attempt to stop the dissemination of false and inaccurate information concerning Dr. Burzynski and the Clinic&quot;, apologizing for comments made by Stephens to bloggers and for the posting of personal information, and announcing that Stephens &quot;no longer has a professional relationship with the Burzynski Clinic.&quot;

The story, including the threats against the bloggers, was covered by the &quot;BMJ&quot; (formerly the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;). The chief clinician at Cancer Research UK expressed his concern at the treatment offered, and Andy Lewis of Quackometer and science writer Simon Singh, who had previously been sued by the British Chiropractic Association, said that English libel law harms public discussion of science and medicine, and thus public health.

In an article in Skeptical Inquirer published in March 2014, skeptic Robert Blaskiewicz chronicled the activities by skeptics to investigate and challenge Burzynski&#x27;s claim of cancer treatments. He claimed aggressive actions by Burzynski&#x27;s supporters toward the critics, including contacting their employers, lodging complaints to state licensing boards and defamation. Blaskiewicz pointedly indicated that, although Burzynski had dismissed Marc Stephens, his clinic has not retracted the warnings of the possibility of lawsuits against critics, that it is &quot;a threat that hangs over all of these activists every day&quot;.

== Media and commentary ==

* In 2010, Eric Merola, an art director of television commercials, released a film titled &quot;Burzynski: Cancer is Serious Business&quot;, that promotes the Clinic&#x27;s claims and describes Burzynski&#x27;s use of antineoplastons and his legal clashes with government agencies and regulators. In March 2013, Merola released a follow-up movie to &quot;Cancer is Serious Business&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; commented that the first movie &quot;violates every basic rule of ethical filmmaking&quot; and that by interviewing only Burzynski&#x27;s supporters, the film&#x27;s producer &quot;is either unusually credulous, or doesn&#x27;t understand the difference between a documentary and an advertisement&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as having the qualities of a &quot;paranoid conspiracy theory&quot; and likened it to the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, adding that the film&#x27;s explanatory diagrams are &quot;simplistic to the point of idiocy&quot;. The &quot;Variety&quot; review concluded that &quot;despite its infotainment look, &quot;Burzynski&quot; ultimately proves convincing.&quot;
* In April 2013, Burzynski received the Pigasus Award, which is bestowed each April Fool&#x27;s Day by the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) to &quot;honor the five worst offenders who are intentionally or unintentionally peddling harmful paranormal and pseudoscientific nonsense.&quot; The Foundation cited as the basis for the award the high cost of antineoplaston treatments, the lack of controlled trials demonstrating efficacy, the lack of FDA approval on the treatments, the lack of published final results of any single clinical trial, and the existence of FDA warning letters concerning research method safety and possible rules violations impacting patient safety.
* In June 2013, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; explored Burzynski in a documentary titled &quot;Curing cancer or &#x27;selling hope&#x27; to the vulnerable?&quot; and argued &quot;Burzynski exploits a legal loophole&quot; by treating patients with antineoplastons &quot;as part of a clinical trial, so the drug does not need a licence&quot; for twenty years. The clinic complained to the Office of Communications (Ofcom) about the documentary, but the complaint was not upheld.
* In November 2013, an investigative report in &quot;USA Today&quot; by Liz Szabo accused Burzynski of selling &quot;false hope to families&quot; for years. In an interview with Reporting on Health, Szabo said that her interest in reporting on Burzynski was sparked when she emailed him with questions asking for a response to a book critical of him, and received a legal warning letter from his attorneys in reply.
* In August 2015, Burzynski was listed by the &quot;Houston Press&quot; as number 8 on a list of &quot;The 10 Most Embarrassing Houstonians&quot; accusing him of being &quot;Truly an embarrassment to such a medical city where some of the best cancer medicine in the world is performed.&quot;

<doc id="1018020" wikidata="Q6731539" url="?curid=1018020" title="Evaporative cooling (atomic physics)">
<text>Evaporative cooling is an atomic physics technique to achieve high phase space densities which optical cooling techniques alone typically can not reach.

Atoms trapped in optical or magnetic traps can be evaporatively cooled via two primary mechanisms, usually specific to the type of trap in question: in magnetic traps, radiofrequency (RF) fields are used to selectively drive warm atoms from the trap by inducing transitions between trapping and non-trapping spin states; or, in optical traps, the depth of the trap itself is gradually decreased, allowing the most energetic atoms in the trap to escape over the edges of the optical barrier. In the case of a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the velocities of the atoms in the trap, these atoms which escape/are driven out of the trap lie in the highest velocity tail of the distribution, meaning that their kinetic energy (and therefore temperature) is much higher than the average for the trap. The net result is that while the total trap population decreases, so does the mean energy of the remaining population. This decrease in the mean kinetic energy of the atom cloud translates into a progressive decrease in the trap temperature, cooling the trap. 

The process is analogous to blowing on a cup of coffee to cool it: those molecules at the highest end of the energy distribution for the coffee form a vapor above the surface and are then removed from the system by blowing them away, decreasing the average energy, and therefore temperature, of the remaining coffee molecules.
Evaporation is a change of state from liquid to gas.

== Radiofrequency induced evaporation ==

Radiofrequency (RF) induced evaporative cooling is the most common method for evaporatively cooling atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). Consider trapped atoms laser cooled on a |F=0 |F=1 transition. The magnetic sublevels of the |F=1 state (|m= -1,0,1) are degenerate for zero external field. The confining magnetic quadrupole field, which is zero at the center of the trap and nonzero everywhere else, causes a Zeeman shift in atoms which stray from the trap center, lifting the degeneracy of the three magnetic sublevels. The interaction energy between the total spin angular momentum of the trapped atom and the external magnetic field depends on the projection of the spin angular momentum onto the z-axis, and is proportional toformula_1From this relation it can be seen that only the |m=-1 magnetic sublevel will have a positive interaction energy with the field, that is to say, the energy of atoms in this state increases as they migrate from the trap center, making the trap center a point of minimum energy, the definition of a trap. Conversely, the energy of the |m=0 state is unchanged by the field (no trapping), and the |m=1 state actually decreases in energy as it strays from the trap center, making the center a point of maximum energy. For this reason |m=-1 is referred to as the trapping state, and |m=0,1 the non-trapping states.
From the equation for the magnetic field interaction energy, it can also be seen that the energies of the |m=1,-1 states shift in opposite directions, changing the total energy difference between these two states. The |m=-1|m=1 transition frequency therefore experiences a Zeeman shift. With this in mind, the RF evaporative cooling scheme works as follows: the size of the Zeeman shift of the -1+1 transition depends on the strength of the magnetic field, which increases radially outward from the trap center. Those atoms which are coldest move within a small region around the trap center, where they experience only a small Zeeman shift in the -1+1 transition frequency. Warm atoms, however, spend time in regions of the trap much further from the center, where the magnetic field is stronger and the Zeeman shift therefore larger. The shift induced by magnetic fields on the scale used in typical MOTs is on the order of MHz, so that a radiofrequency source can be used to drive the -1+1 transition. The choice of frequency for the RF source corresponds to a point on the trapping potential curve at which atoms experience a Zeeman shift equal to the frequency of the RF source, which then drives the atoms to the anti-trapping |m=1 magnetic sublevel and immediately exits the trap. Lowering the RF frequency is therefore equivalent to lowering the dashed line in the figure, effectively reducing the depth of the potential well. For this reason the RF source used to remove these energetic atoms is often referred to as an &quot;RF knife,&quot; as it effectively lowers the height of the trapping potential to remove the most energetic atoms from the trap, &quot;cutting&quot; away the high energy tail of the trap&#x27;s energy distribution. This method was famously used to cool a cloud of rubidium atoms below the condensation critical temperature to form the first experimentally observed Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)

== Optical evaporation ==

While the first observation of Bose-Einstein condensation was made in a magnetic atom trap using RF driven evaporative cooling, optical dipole traps are now much more common platforms for achieving condensation. Beginning in a MOT, cold, trapped atoms are transferred to the focal point of a high power, tightly focused, off-resonant laser beam. The electric field of the laser at its focus is sufficiently strong to induce dipole moments in the atoms, which are then attracted to the electric field maximum at the laser focus, effectively creating a trapping potential to hold them at the beam focus.

The depth of the optical trapping potential in an optical dipole trap (ODT) is proportional to the intensity of the trapping laser light. Decreasing the power in the trapping laser beam therefore decreases the depth of the trapping potential. In the case of RF-driven evaporation, the actual height of the potential barrier confining the atoms is fixed during the evaporation sequence, but the RF knife effectively decreases the depth of this barrier, as previously discussed. For an optical trap, however, evaporation is facilitated by decreasing the laser power and thus lowering the depth of the trapping potential. As a result, the warmest atoms in the trap will have sufficient kinetic energy to be able to make it over the barrier walls and escape the trap, reducing the average energy of the remaining atoms as previously described. While trap depths for ODTs can be shallow (on the order of mK, in terms of temperature), the simplicity of this optical evaporation procedure has helped to make it increasingly popular for BEC experiments since its first demonstrations shortly after magnetic BEC production.

<text>Edwin James Brady (7 August 1869 – 22 July 1952) was an Australian journalist and poet.

==Personal life==

From Irish parents, Brady was born at Carcoar, New South Wales, and was educated both in the United States and Sydney, Australia. Among his school friends were Christopher Brennan and Roderic Quinn.

He worked as a wharf clerk, a farmer, and journalist, and edited both rural and city newspapers.

His political leanings were as a confirmed socialist, and secretary of the first Socialist League of Australia, in Sydney, 1890. It was suggested that Brady and fellow poet Henry Lawson contemplated with becoming &#x27;New Australians&#x27; at the 1893 New Australia settlement in Paraguay, away from the influences of capitalism.

==Career==

Brady was a friend with poets Will H. Ogilvie (1869–1963), Roderic Quinn (1867–1949)), Banjo Paterson (1864–1941) and Henry Lawson (1867–1922). Several of those individuals were also members of the Bohemian group, the Dawn and Dusk Club, with Brady being the last. In 1910, Brady took Lawson on a poets&#x27; retreat, restoring Lawson&#x27;s health.

He was the editor of the &quot;Australian Workman&quot;, Sydney&#x27;s first trade union newspaper, in 1891-92. &quot;The Bulletin&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; were the repositories for many of his poems and prose. In 1899, equipped with a notebook, gun, and camera, Brady drove a wagon from Sydney to Townsville (although intending to reach the Gulf of Carpentaria) and back, recording the lives of the settlers.

Working at Grafton&#x27;s &quot;Daily Examiner&quot; in New South Wales, Brady wrote under the pen-name Nedi Woolli. The first name was an extension of Quinn&#x27;s name for Brady, and the last name being an indigenous name relating to the Yamba area; with Quinn normally calling him Ned. He later took over &quot;The Grip&quot; newspaper, but &#x27;it went &#x27;straight on the rocks&#x27; &#x27;.

Brady later established a writers&#x27; and artists&#x27; colony at Mallacoota, Victoria in 1909, and he continued to live there until his death.

He chronicled an eventful journey down the Murray River in a small motor boat from Albury to the coast in 1911 in &quot;River Rovers.&quot;

A passionate nationalist, he achieved his greatest fame with his book &quot;Australia Unlimited&quot;, a bestseller from its appearance in 1918, which urged dramatic increases in the national population. In 1926, a book entitled &quot;Industrial Australia&quot; was being written about the history and growth of industry within the country. His last work &quot;Two Frontiers&quot; was published in 1945. He also sought to write the biography of &quot;The Bulletin&quot; co-founder J. F. &#x27;Archie&#x27; Archibald. Publishers refused to print the biography.

Lines from his poem &quot;Far and Wide&quot; have been used in the Melbourne tourism advertisement running on ESPN2 and Tennis Channel during the 2016, 2017, and 2018 Australian Open.

:I&#x27;ll call you to the beaches,
::And you shall bide with me
:Along the river reaches
::And by the open sea.

== Later life ==

Brady, given as tall and debonair, in 1890 married Marion Cecilia Walsh; and in June 1895, married Annie Creo Dooley née Stanley, in June 1895. Aged 72, he married Florence Jane Bourke in 1942 in Victoria, and had a daughter.

After retiring, he continued living in a tent home in Mallacoota.

Aged 82, Brady died in 1952 at the Pambula Public Hospital of a heart condition. He was survived by his third wife, and six children from his first marriage.

<text>Thomas Henry Wintringham (15 May 1898 – 16 August 1949) was a British soldier, military historian, journalist, poet, Marxist, politician and author. He was a supporter of the Home Guard during the Second World War and was one of the founders of the Common Wealth Party.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Tom Wintringham was born 1898 in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. He was educated at Gresham&#x27;s School, Holt, and Balliol College, Oxford. In 1915 he was elected to a Brakenbury scholarship in History at Balliol, but during the First World War postponed his university career to join the Royal Flying Corps, serving as a mechanic and motorcycle despatch rider.

At the end of the war he was involved in a brief barracks mutiny, one of many minor insurrections which went unnoticed in the period. He returned to Oxford, and in a long vacation made a visit of some months to Moscow, after which he returned to England and formed a group of students aiming to establish a British section of the Third International, a Communist party. As the party was formed, Wintringham graduated from Oxford and moved to London, ostensibly to study for the bar at the Temple, but in fact to work full-time in politics.

===Political career and the Spanish Civil War===
In 1923, Wintringham joined the recently formed Communist Party of Great Britain. In 1925, he was one of the twelve CPGB officials imprisoned for seditious libel and incitement to mutiny. In 1930, he helped to found the Communist newspaper, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, and was one of the few named writers to publish articles in it. In writing for the Communist party&#x27;s theoretic journal &quot;Labour Monthly&quot;, he established himself as the party&#x27;s military expert. In &quot;LM&quot; articles and in booklets on the subject, Wintringham formed the arguments against Air Assault and called for air raid precautions several years before the bombing of Guernica. His arguments were the basis for the most successful of the Communist Party&#x27;s wartime campaigns, that for ARP provision, and shaped government policy on the issue in the years leading up to the war.

Although at the centre of the CPGB organisation, he was often at odds with Party policy, believing in a communism of alliance and co-operation, rather than the dominant Comintern ideology of &quot;class against class&quot;. Wintringham&#x27;s ideas became party dogma when the Comintern announced the &#x27;Popular Front&#x27;, a form of communism Wintringham was prepared to fight for.

In 1934, he became the founder, editor and major contributor of &quot;Left Review&quot;, the first British literary journal with a stated Marxist intent. Although published by Wintringham and funded by the CPGB, it embraced writers of all shades of socialism, regardless of their party affiliations. The journal established a pattern for what was to become cultural studies.

In 1935, he wrote &quot;The Coming World War&quot;, which was published both in the UK and the USA. In it, he predicted an inevitable world war between the imperialist powers and the USSR, most likely beginning with a conflict over Manchuria; that it would be primarily a mechanised conflict and therefore susceptible to revolutionary action by the working class.

At the start of the Spanish Civil War, Wintringham went to Barcelona as a journalist for the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, but he joined and eventually commanded the British Battalion of the International Brigades. Some socialist commentators have credited him with the whole idea of &quot;international&quot; brigades. He also had an affair with a US journalist, Kitty Bowler, whom he later married.

In February 1937 he was wounded in the Battle of Jarama. While injured in Spain he became friends with Ernest Hemingway, who based one of his characters upon him. He spent some months as a machine gun instructor. When he returned to the battalion the next summer he contracted typhoid, was again wounded at Quinto in August 1937 and was repatriated in October. His later book &quot;English Captain&quot; is based on these experiences.

In 1938, the Communist Party condemned Kitty Bowler as a Trotskyist spy but he refused to leave her: he quit the party instead. He came to mistrust the party&#x27;s subservience to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union and Comintern. Back in England, Tom Hopkinson recruited him to work for the magazine &quot;Picture Post&quot;.

===Second World War===
On returning from Spain, Wintringham began to call for an armed civilian guard to repel any Axis invasion, and as early as 1938 he had begun campaigning for what would become the Home Guard. He taught the troops tactics of guerrilla warfare, including a movement known as the &#x27;Monkey Crawl&#x27;. They were also taught how to deal with dive bombers.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Wintringham applied for an army officer&#x27;s commission but was rejected. When the Communist Party promulgated its policy of staying out of the war due to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, he strongly condemned their policies. Because of the appeasement policies of prime minister Neville Chamberlain, he also imagined the Tories to be Nazi sympathizers and wrote that they should be removed from office. He wrote for &quot;Picture Post&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, and wrote columns for &quot;Tribune&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;.

In May 1940, after the escape from Dunkirk, Wintringham began to write in support of the Local Defence Volunteers, the forerunner of the Home Guard. On 10 July, he opened the private Home Guard training school at Osterley Park, London.

Wintringham&#x27;s training methods were mainly based on his experience in Spain. He even had veterans who had fought alongside him in Spain who trained volunteers in anti-tank warfare and demolitions. He also taught street fighting and guerrilla warfare. He wrote many articles in &quot;Picture Post&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; propagating his views about the Home Guard with the motto &quot;a people&#x27;s war for a people&#x27;s peace&quot;.

The British Army determined that Wintringham was unreliable because of his communist past. After September 1940, the army began to take charge of the Home Guard training in Osterley and Wintringham and his comrades were gradually sidelined. Wintringham resigned in April 1941. Ironically, despite his activities in support of the Home Guard, Wintringham was never allowed to join the organisation itself because of a policy barring membership to Fascists and Communists.

In 1942, Wintringham proceeded to found a Common Wealth Party with Vernon Bartlett, Sir Richard Acland and J. B. Priestley. He received 48 percent of the vote at the Midlothian and Peebles Northern by-election in February 1943, previously a safe Tory seat. In the 1945 general election he stood in the Aldershot constituency, the Labour Party candidate standing down to give him a clear race against the incumbent Conservative MP. His wife Kitty stood in the same Midlothian constituency that he had come so close to winning two years earlier, but neither was elected. After the war Wintringham and many of the founders of Common Wealth left and joined the Labour Party, suggesting the dissolving of CW.

===Later life===
In his later years he worked mainly in radio and film, both producing documentary and critical programmes and writing criticism. He continued to write about military history, opposing the use and development of atomic weapons and championing Mao&#x27;s China and Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia over the monolithic bureaucracy of the Soviet Union. While he recognised and opposed the purges and repression that marred the achievements of the Soviet Union, he never accepted that Stalin himself was complicit or responsible for them.

His later campaigns and writing were mainly centred on the formation of a &#x27;World Guard&#x27; a neutral volunteer force (initially) to police Palestine and the partitioned India, and to be at the disposal of the United Nations.

Tom Wintringham died on 16 August 1949, aged 51, after a massive heart attack while he was staying with his sister at her farm at Owmby, Lincolnshire.

<doc id="1018042" wikidata="Q13189584" url="?curid=1018042" title="Illescas Peninsula">
<text>Illescas is a peninsula in northwestern Peru. It forms the southern boundary of the Sechura Bay, the largest bay in Peru. Sechura Bay also includes the northernmost portion of the Pacific Ocean that is under the influence of the Peru-Chile or Humboldt Current. The Illescas Peninsula is located in the department of Piura, and is scarcely inhabited. Part of Illescas was declared a reserved zone. Illescas is also the name given to the highest point of the peninsula (500 m.), the Cerro Illescas.

==A mountain between sea and a flatland desert==
The Peninsula and Cerro Illescas are located more than 150 km west of the Andes, in the middle of a flatland desert, the Sechura Desert. The cerro is a series of small hills (up to 500 m. in elevation) interspersed by narrow and short valleys formed during rare rain events. Vegetation cover is extremely reduced in the peninsula, and only a few shrub and tree species grow in the area, especially mesquite trees and shrubs locally known as zapote. An endemic species of fox, the Sechura fox is found in the peninsula. Along the coast, and at its westernmost point, there are colonies of sea lions, blue-footed boobies and Humboldt penguins.

==Regions==
The only human settlement of the Illescas Peninsula is the fishermen town of Bayovar.

==Geographic features==
*The Punta Aguja is the westernmost point of the peninsula, and is inhabited by colonies of marine mammals and seabirds.
*At the south end of Illescas, Playa sin fin extends for more than 100 km, and is the largest uninterrupted sandy shore along the Peruvian coastline.
*The Bayovar depression is an area north of Illescas, where a large area of the ground is below sea level (-34 m.). Large deposits of phosphorus ores and diatomite are found near the Bayovar depression.
*The Estuario de Virrilá is a 30 km long canal entering the Sechura Desert from the Sechura Bay. Despite its name, it is not an estuary.

<doc id="1018045" wikidata="Q529938" url="?curid=1018045" title="InterCity">
<text>InterCity (commonly abbreviated IC on timetables and tickets) is the classification applied to certain long-distance passenger train services in Europe. Such trains (in contrast to InterRegio, regional, local, or commuter trains) generally call at major stations only.

An international variant of the InterCity trains are the EuroCity (EC) trains, which consist of high-standard coaches and are run by a variety of operators.

== History ==

The Inter-City Rapid Transit Company was an Ohio interurban company, which began operations in 1930 as it had purchased its route from the Northern Ohio Traction &amp; Light Company. It remained in operation till 1940.

The use of &quot;Inter-City&quot; was reborn in the United Kingdom: A daily train of that name was introduced in 1950, running between the cities of London and Birmingham. This usage can claim to be the origin of all later usages worldwide.

In 1966 British Rail introduced the brand InterCity for all of its express train routes, and in 1986 the term was adopted by the InterCity sector of British Rail. Following the privatisation of the railways in Great Britain, the term is no longer in official use there although many people still refer to fast long-distance services as InterCity trains. The brand still exists though, and belongs to the Department for Transport.
In West Germany, the Deutsche Bundesbahn first used the name (then written &quot;Intercity&quot;) in 1968, denoting special first-class services on the F-Zug train network. Many of the Class VT 11.5 diesel multiple units formerly used on the TEE network were converted for early Intercity services.

In Switzerland, the InterCity brand replaced SwissExpress in the 1982 schedule.

In Norway, &quot;intercity&quot; (later also written &quot;InterCity&quot;) trains were introduced in 1975 on the Vestfold Line (the Oslo-Skien service), later also on the Østfold Line (Oslo-Halden). They were (relatively) fast trains on distances up to 2–3 hours. Today, the name is used not on the trains, but on the main lines from Oslo to Skien, Lillehammer, and Halden – and also on the Ringerike Line, which is under construction from Oslo to Hønefoss.

An international variant of InterCity, EuroCity (EC), was introduced in May 1987. EuroCity trains consist of high-standard, air conditioned coaches, are run by a variety of operators, and are usually subject to on-board border controls. For example, EuroCity trains running in Germany can be made up by rolling stock of either the SBB (Switzerland), ÖBB (Austria), SNCF (France), and less commonly by stock of the Czech ČD and Hungarian MÁV railways.

== InterCity by country ==

=== Austria ===
The Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) have operated IC services since 1991. However, contrary to most other countries, these are often little more than regional rail, as most long-distance, high-standard trains in Austria are likely to be EuroCity (EC) services, even when not leaving the Austrian borders (named &quot;ÖBB-EuroCity&quot; until 2011). Modernised stock of Eurofima coaches is used under the brand name &quot;ÖBB-InterCity&quot; (OIC) mainly on the Austrian Western and Southern Railways from Vienna to Salzburg and Villach.

The ÖBB also deployed electric multiple unit trains, from 2006 also three ICE T (Class 411, named &quot;ÖBB 4011&quot;) trainsets in cooperation with the Deutsche Bahn, currently running from Vienna to Frankfurt via Linz and Passau. ÖBB high-speed rail service is provided by Railjet (RJ) trains.

Since 2011, there is an hourly express train service on the Western Railway operated by WESTbahn, the only long-distance competitor of the ÖBB.

IC-Services:
* Western Railway
** Vienna–Linz–Salzburg (trains are operating from 5 am to 10 pm, hourly)
* Southern Railway
** Vienna–Bruck an der Mur–Klagenfurt–Villach (every 2 hours with several trains running as EC)
** Vienna–Bruck an der Mur–Graz (every 2 hours with several trains running as EC, 4 trains heading to Maribor, Ljubljana and Zagreb)
** Vienna–Wiener Neustadt–Mattersburg–Sopron–Csorna
** Graz–Klagenfurt (service is operating as &quot;Intercitybus&quot; till the Koralm Railway is opened)
* North railway
** Vienna–Břeclav (trains are operating as EC or D for Brno, Praha, Kraków, Warsaw and Berlin)
* Enns Valley Railway 
** Graz–Selzthal–Bischofshofen–Salzburg (4 trains per day).

** Innsbruck–Bregenz (service is running for Stuttgart and Dortmund).
The InterCity service from Vienna to Salzburg is going to be expanded for an hourly service to Landeck via Innsbruck by December 2008. Also, the service from Vienna to Graz is going to operate hourly by December 2008.
*Vienna-Košice Railway ( route Vienna-Bratislava-Žilina-Košice mainly on the territory of Slovakia ).
The IC44 and IC45 trains stop at Bratislava-Petržalka, Bratislava-Nové Mesto, Bratislava Hlavná Stanica, Trnava, Žilina, Poprad, and Kysak; it takes 6:22h for the whole journey.

=== Belgium ===

InterCity trains link all major cities of Belgium. Some of them serve also destinations outside the country. The IC between Liège and Brussels travels at 200 km/h on the HSL 2. However, because of the density of the train network with many connecting lines and the many small- and medium-sized cities in Belgium, most IC services also call at smaller stations or continue as local trains on branch lines.

=== Croatia ===
As of 2024, there are two InterCity services:
*&quot;IC Podravka&quot; (Zagreb – Osijek)
*&quot;IC Agram&quot; (Zagreb – Budapest)

The coaches used are similar to the ones used in Germany by DB.

Trains &quot;Slavonija&quot; and &quot;Cibalia&quot; connecting Zagreb and Vinkovci were part of IC network up to 2023, when they were downgraded to fast train (B). Speeds were up to 160 km/h between Slavonski Brod and Vinkovci.

Line Zagreb – Split served by tilting trains is designated as InterCity Nagibni (ICN).

=== Czech Republic ===

In the Czech Republic, the IC or Express trains service the following routes:

*Bohumín–Břeclav,
*Bohumín–Prague,
*Třinec–Prague,
*Cheb–Prague (served by Pendolino tilting trainsets),
*Havířov–Prague.

Most of the IC are served by trains of state-owned operator České dráhy with speeds up to 160 km/h but they have been converted into category Express in 2012 timetable. The other is served by trains of private operator RegioJet with speed up to 160 km/h. No surcharge is applied to IC trains but RegioJet runs reservation compulsory trains. Third private passenger operator LEO Express introduced express InterCity train service between Prague and Ostrava in November 2012, with speeds up to 160 km/h.

The state-owned operator České dráhy also serves line Prague–Ostrava (with some connections extended to Bohumín and Františkovy Lázně) with Pendolino trainsets under designation &quot;SuperCity&quot;, which conforms to IC standard. A compulsory reservation is applied on these trains.

=== Denmark ===
The Intercity network of the Danish State Railways consists of IC trains and their faster version, &quot;Lyntog&quot; (Lightning Train), which is identical but with fewer stops. Each train type operates hourly between the eastern terminus at Copenhagen and westwards to Odense–Århus–Ålborg, and less frequently to alternative destinations in Jutland. These are run by IC3 diesel materiel since most of the network is not electrified. There are also electrical IC trains run by IR4s in an hourly schedule from Copenhagen westwards to Odense and alternately Esbjerg/Sønderborg. This means during most of the day there are three trains an hour between Copenhagen and Odense. Quite unusual in the world, some trains will consist of both electrically and diesel-powered units coupled together. Being the only option for long-distance and some short-distance travel, there is no surcharge for IC and Lyntog. They have a maximum speed of 180 km/h. Additionally, there are a few IR trains during Friday and Sunday peak hours between Copenhagen and Århus. These are locomotive-run and have bilevel cars. The IC3 trains are planned to be replaced by new IC4 trains, originally in 2001. They first ran with passengers in 2008, but haven&#x27;t nearly replaced the IC3 yet. It is now planned to give the IC3 stock a 10-year life extension, and to eventually scrap IC4 trains, due to the plague of poor reliability. IR4 stock (Electric version of IC3) will release IC3 stock from the Esbjerg Line, allowing some IC3 trains to replace IC4 trains.

=== Finland ===
In Finland, VR has operated InterCity trains between major Finnish cities since August 1988. The first routes were Helsinki–Vaasa and Helsinki–Imatra, which later expanded to all major cities and include for instance Helsinki–Tampere–Oulu–Rovaniemi, Helsinki–Turku, Helsinki–Iisalmi and Helsinki–Joensuu. InterCity trains have become the standard as the Finnish long-distance rail travel mainstay, and their predecessors, blue-carriaged express trains, are being withdrawn off the schedules. The train tickets include an additional surcharge compared to ordinary express trains: 17 to 27% depending on journey length.

VR operates both ordinary InterCity trains (IC) and entirely double-decker trains (IC²). An ordinary IC train usually consists of 3 to 4 double-decker cars and 3 to 5 ordinary IC cars. In addition the train has a restaurant car. IC² trains consist only of double-decker cars and have no separate restaurant car with a sales trolley moving about in the train. However, due to high demand, VR ordered double-decker restaurant cars from Transtech in early 2011. The first carriages became operational in 2013. All IC-trains are smoke-free.

The trains run at a maximum speed of 140–160 km/h for single-decker trains and up to for double-deckers, which was VR&#x27;s aim in 1988. Only the &quot;Pendolino&quot; and &quot;Allegro&quot; trains are faster than InterCity trains in Finland.

=== France ===

In 2006, the SNCF rebranded Corail, Téoz and Lunéa services as &#x27;Intercités&#x27;, a brand for all of their &#x27;classic&#x27; services day and night.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, the InterCity network was launched in 1971 to accompany and eventually replace the Trans Europ Express trains. At first, IC services were first-class only, often using TEE stock and the then-new Class 103 locomotives. Trains ran bi-hourly. DB paid a royalty fee to BR for many years for the use of the brand name.

In 1978, it was decided to expand the IC network to services with both first and second class, and so the new scheme, called IC &#x27;79 was launched in 1979 with the motto &quot;Jede Stunde, jede Klasse&quot; (&quot;every hour, every class&quot;) to emphasize its new structure. Large numbers of air-conditioned open coach cars, the &quot;Bpmz 291&quot;, were built for InterCity services, which at first were using the TEE colour scheme.
In 1985, with many of the TEE trains gone and the introduction of the InterRegio, the network was expanded again, now covering virtually any major city of then-West Germany. It faced further changes after the German reunification and the introduction of the InterCityExpress in the early 1990s.

Today, after the abolition of the InterRegio in 2002, most long-distance connections in Germany are either IC or ICE trains; they most commonly offer at least bi-hourly service. Maximum speed for an IC is 200 km/h.

=== Greece ===
In Greece, InterCity trains operated by Italian government-owned Hellenic Train run in the following routes:

* Athens–Lamia–Larissa–Thessaloniki
* Athens–Lamia–Palaiofarsalos–Karditsa–Trikala–Kalambaka, one pair of trains per day at 160 km/h
* Thessaloniki–Serres–Drama–Xanthi-Alexandroupoli, one pair of trains per day at 160 km/h

===Hungary===
In Hungary the first InterCity train departed in 1991, since then almost 10 million people use these trains every year. Since then almost 250 InterCity trains operate in the country.

Intercity train services in Hungary:
* Budapest Déli pu–Pécs (Every 2–3 hours)
* Budapest Keleti pu–Pécs (Every 1–2 hours)
* Budapest Déli pu–Kaposvár–Nagykanizsa (Somogy IC)
* Budapest Déli pu.-Szekszárd-Baja (Gemenc IC)
* Budapest Keleti pu– Miskolc–Tiszai–Debrecen–Budapest Nyugati pu (Circle-IC, every 2 hours)
* Budapest Keleti pu–Miskolc–Tiszai (Every hour)
* Budapest Keleti pu–Győr–Sopron and Szombathely (Every hour)
* Budapest Keleti pu–Békéscsaba–Timișoara /Târgu Mureș/Simeria/Brașov/București-Nord (Every 2h)
* Budapest Keleti pu-Békéscsaba-Lőkösháza (Every hour)
* Budapest Nyugati pu–Nyíregyháza (Every 2 hours)
* Budapest Nyugati pu–Szeged (Every hour)

The Hungarian intercity trains are operated by MÁV-START, the Hungarian railway company.

=== Ireland ===
In the Republic of Ireland, Iarnród Éireann introduced the brand name InterCity in 1984, replacing the previous name of &quot;Mainline&quot;, which had been introduced in 1976. Initially applied to services operated by British Rail Mark 3 trains, it was later extended to include all services not part of the Dublin Suburban Rail network. Today the brand encompasses services between Dublin and Cork, Galway, Limerick, Tralee, Waterford, Sligo, Westport, Rosslare Europort, Ballina, and Ennis, as well as some regional services. A new InterCity logo was introduced in 2006, though the vast majority of rolling stock bore the original script logo and orange-tan livery until the final Mark 3 set was withdrawn in 2009. Since Ireland completed its replacement of the old Mark 2 and Mark 3 stock in 2012, it has one of the most modern InterCity fleets in the world.

Northern Ireland Railways and Iarnród Éireann both formerly operated trains on the Dublin–Belfast line under the InterCity brand, however this was replaced with the revived Enterprise brand name upon the introduction of the De Dietrich Ferroviaire rolling stock in 1997. This, coupled with the subsequent withdrawal of most coaching stock bearing the logo and the rebrand to the Translink name, means that the InterCity brand has largely disappeared from Northern Ireland Railways.

=== Italy ===


In Italy, InterCity trains constitute a capillary network that links the main cities across the peninsula. There were over 80-day (InterCity Sun) and night (InterCity Notte) services. Things changed with the opening of high-speed lines and the mixed public-private service. With the introduction of high-speed trains, intercity trains are limited to few services per day on mainline and regional tracks.

The daytime services (&quot;InterCity&quot; IC), while not frequent and limited to one or two trains per route, are essential in providing access to cities and towns off the railway&#x27;s mainline network. The main routes are Trieste to Rome (stopping at Venice, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Milan to Rome (stopping at Genoa, La Spezia, Pisa and Livorno / stopping at Parma, Modena, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Bologna to Lecce (stopping at Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi) and Rome to Reggio di Calabria (stopping at Latina and Naples). In addition, the Intercity trains provide a more economical means of long-distance rail travel within Italy.

The night trains (&quot;Intercity Notte&quot; ICN) have sleeper compartments and washrooms, but no showers on board (available only for &quot;Excelsior&quot; carriages). Main routes are Rome to Bolzano/Bozen (calling at Florence, Bologna, Verona, Rovereto and Trento), Milan to Lecce (calling at Piacenza, Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, Faenza, Forlì, Cesena, Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi), Turin to Lecce (calling at Alessandria, Voghera, Piacenza, Parma, Bologna, Rimini, Pescara, Termoli, San Severo,Foggia, Barletta, Bisceglie, Molfetta, Bari, Monopoli, Fasano, Ostuni and Brindisi) and Reggio di Calabria to Turin (calling at Naples, Rome, Livorno, La Spezia and Genova). Most portions of these ICN services run during the night; since most services take 10 to 15 hours to complete a one-way journey, their day-time portion provide extra train connections to complement with the Intercity services.

There are a total of 86 intercity trains running within Italy per day.

=== Netherlands ===
Intercity trains are very common in the Netherlands, but may differ from each other. While some intercity trains call only at larger stations, some others may also call at smaller stations or at all intermediate stations along a short stretch of its route. Hence, some stations may be served by one intercity train while another may pass it. For example, the Intercity trains between Arnhem Central station and Utrecht Central station alternately serve Driebergen-Zeist or Veenendaal-De Klomp (and both when the frequency is lowered from 4tph to 2tph in the evening). Often, intercity trains run as local trains along the very end of its route. For example, the Nijmegen to Den Helder intercity runs as regular intercity until Alkmaar, serving larger stations only, but running as local train between Alkmaar and Den Helder, serving all intermediate stations.

The average distance between station is shorter than most IC trains in most other countries, but frequencies are higher. All lines are served at least with 2tph, but many busy stretches are served have 4tph. From Utrecht Central there are even two different services to Amsterdam, one that serves the central station and two others and another that serves the south station and the airport. From December 2017 the frequency between Amsterdam, Utrecht and Eindhoven will be further increased to 6tph.

Rolling stock used mostly for intercity services in the Netherlands is VIRM. DD-AR trains have been converted to be used as &quot;New Intercity Double deckers&quot; and have been introduced to parts of the intercity network. Also, older ICM (formerly known as Koploper) EMUs are frequently seen on intercity routes. ICRm coaches, pulled by a TRAXX locomotive, can be seen on international stretches and the Intercity Direct.

=== Poland ===

In Poland IC trains operated by PKP Intercity S.A. up to 2009 served the following routes:

* Warsaw–Katowice /Kraków with speed up to 200 km/h.
* Warsaw–Katowice–Bielsko-Biała with speed up to 160 km/h
* Warsaw–Katowice–Gliwice with speed up to 160 km/h
* Warsaw–Poznań–Wrocław with speed up to 160 km/h
* Warsaw–Katowice–Opole–Wrocław with speed up to 160 km/h
* Warsaw–Poznań–Szczecin with speed up to 160 km/h
* Warsaw–Gdańsk–Gdynia with speed up to 200 km/h
* Warsaw–Dęblin–Lublin with speed up to 160 km/h
* Gdynia–Warsaw–Kraków with speed up to 200 km/h
* Gdynia–Warsaw–Gliwice with speed up to 160 km/h
* Szczecin–Berlin–Amsterdam Zuid WTC–Schiphol (jointly operated by PKP Intercity and Deutsche Bahn)

Apart from a single railway line (line nr 4, a.k.a. Centralna Magistrala Kolejowa–Central Railway Route), average speeds are much lower.

These trains mostly use the locomotive named Eurosprinter (EU44), EP09, sometimes EP08.

In 2009 IC category was renamed Express InterCity (EIC). Since December 2014 IC trains are regular express and fast trains (with pricing offers like TLK fast trains), also operated by PKP Intercity, mainly utilizing high-standard Pesa Dart (ED161) and Stadler FLIRT3 (ED160) electric multiple units. In addition to the EMU trains are served with refurbished cars pulled by EU07, EP07, and EP08 locomotives.

=== Portugal ===
In Portugal, InterCidades trains are operated by state-owned Comboios de Portugal (CP).

All routes (except Casa Branca to Beja) are operated using a 5600 Series electric locomotives pulling Corail and Modernized Sorefame passenger cars, all capable of running at a maximum speed of 200 km/h. This services have a Bar car and bicycle space.

The Casa Branca to Beja Shuttle service is operated using two 0450 Series DMUs with airline style interiors at a maximum speed of 120 km/h. Although this service is branded as InterCidades, it is truly a stopper service (like a Regional service) with lower comfort standards and no Bar car or vending machines. This service is expected to have a quality boost when the new Stadler FLIRT BMU units enter operations sometime after 2025.

The InterCidades network can be divided into the following:

* InterCidades Norte: connects Lisbon with northern Portugal. It complements the Alfa Pendular services so that, in average, there is one train per hour between Lisbon and Porto. It has the following routes and frequencies:
**Lisbon (Santa Apolónia) - Porto (Campanhã): 3 trains per day;
**Lisbon (Santa Apolónia) - Porto (Campanhã) - Braga: 2 trains per day;
**Lisbon (Santa Apolónia) - Porto (Campanhã) - Guimarães: 1 train per day;
**Lisbon (Santa Apolónia) - Porto (Campanhã) - Viana do Castelo: 1 train per day - Saturday service terminates at Porto and Sunday service begins at Porto;
*Intercidades Beira Alta: connects Lisbon with Guarda via Coimbra and Mangualde through the Portuguese central highlands. It complements the InterCidades Norte services between Lisbon and Coimbra and has the following route and frequencies:
**Lisbon (Santa Apolónia) - Coimbra - Guarda: 3 trains per day;
*Intercidades Beira Baixa: connects Lisbon with Covilhã via Abrantes and Castelo Branco following most of the Tagus valley before turning north towards the Portuguese central highlands. It complements the InterCidades Norte services between Lisbon and Entroncamento and has the following route and frequencies:
**Lisbon (Santa Apolónia) - Entroncamento - Covilhã: 3 trains per day;
*InterCidades Alentejo: connects Lisbon with the Alentejo capitals of Évora and Beja through the Alentejo plains. It has the following route and frequencies:
**Lisbon (Oriente) - Casa Branca - Évora: 4 trains per day on weekdays and 3 trains per day on weekends and holidays;
**Casa Branca - Beja: 4 trains per day on weekdays and 3 trains per day on weekends and holidays;
*InterCidades Sul: connects Lisbon with Faro through the Alentejo plains and the Algarve Hills. It complements the two daily Porto - Faro Alfa Pendular services and has the following route and frequencies:
**Lisbon (Oriente) - Faro: 3 trains per day with one extra summer Fridays service to Faro and one extra summer Sundays service to Lisbon.
=== Romania ===

Currently InterCity lines link the capital Bucharest to Brașov, Arad, Oradea, Cluj-Napoca, Târgu Mureș, Galați (all once daily), Suceava, Iași (twice daily), Piatra Neamț (once daily), Bacău (4x daily), Ploiești (6x daily), Craiova (twice daily) and Timișoara (once daily). There are also international trains branded as InterCity between the Hungarian capital, Budapest and some Transylvanian cities such as Cluj-Napoca, Târgu Mureș, Brașov, and others. These trains usually have specific names (Harghita, Ady Endre, etc.).

In the case of IC service running partially or totally on electrified lines as well as international IC-s locomotive-hauled trains are used. For some trains running exclusively on unelectrified lines (mainly in northern Transilvania) Siemens Desiro DMU-s are preferred. These trainsets look similar to standard Desiro DMU-s used for regional trains but have a different interior design with more comfortable seating.

All IC trains use 1st and 2nd class coaches with air conditioning, having automatic doors and a higher level of comfort than InterRegio trains. In order to compete with regional airlines, CFR Călători introduced special Business class coaches on the IC trains running between Oradea and Bucharest and Timișoara and Bucharest. The new class can be divided into two slightly different premium service levels, &quot;Business Exclusiv&quot; (1A) and &quot;Business Standard&quot; (1B). All of these coaches have wireless internet and wall sockets in order to permit the use of laptops, 4 channel audio system, bar, Exclusiv further providing larger space per customer, special leather seating and LCD screens for each seat.

The maximum speed on the Romanian Railways network is 160 km/h on the Bucharest - Constanța line, 140 km/h on the Bucharest - Ploiești line. The design speed for the rest of the network is either 120 km/h or 100 km/h.

In 2014, InterCity trains were replaced in their entirety by InterRegio trains, only to make an illegal comeback (train sets do not respect all the obligatory criteria for InterCity trains ironically signed by the same government a few months prior to their comeback) in 2022, with the new train timelist.

=== Serbia ===
From March 2022, state company called Srbija Voz operates InterCity route from Belgrade, the capital, to Novi Sad using 3 Stadler KISS EMUs reaching speeds up to 200 km/h, with journey length of 36 minutes. A massive expansion of IC routes is planned after the completion of Belgrade – Budapest and Belgrade – Niš high-speed lines.

=== Slovakia ===
In the Slovak Republic, InterCity trains run between the capital Bratislava and Košice (some IC trains continued from Bratislava to Vienna). In the past, the names of some of these trains used to be sold for commercial use (IC Šariš named by beer producer, IC Zelmer named by an electronic devices producer, IC Slovenka named by a magazine, IC Mora, IC Gorenje, both named after kitchen appliances producers). In 2012, no IC train had commercial name. All IC trains are named by natural monuments (IC Tatran, IC Kriváň, IC Gerlach, IC Rysy, IC Chopok, IC Ďumbier). All IC trains are subject to compulsory reservation to make comfort as high as possible. The seat reservation is included in the ticket price. The price varies, depending on the day of travel, and the time of reservation (the sooner you buy a ticket, the lower the price).

In the past, there were also 3 other InterCity services: IC 400/407 Donau (Danube) between Bratislava and Vienna, IC 532/533 Rákoczi from Košice to Budapest and IC 536/537 Hornád from Košice to Pécs. On this train passengers could travel without a reservation or surcharge, since it is impossible to use them for domestic transport in Slovakia.

All InterCity trains consist of new comfortable cars which are fully air conditioned.

First class and a restaurant car are available on all IC trains.

Maximum speed between Bratislava and Nové Mesto nad Váhom has been increased in the recent years and is now 160 km/h. On the rest of the route, maximum speed varies from 80 to 140 km/h.
There is a large reconstruction under way between Nové Mesto nad Váhom and Žilina. After the reconstruction is finished, it will be possible to increase maximum speed of this part of the route to 160 km/h.

=== Slovenia ===
Intercity trains in Slovenia mainly serve domestic routes, like running from Ljubljana (capital) to Celje, Ptuj, and Maribor. Additionally, there are also available Pendolino electric multiple tilting units ETR 310 (SŽ series 310) labeled as ICS lines connecting Slovenian largest cities, Ljubljana and Maribor and the Mediterranean region of Slovenia, Koper.

===Spain===
Renfe operates intercity trains in Spain. It was a long-distance train with high frequency. This denomination was created firstly in 1980. It started operating the electric train (EMU) Renfe 444 series, making the Madrid -Valencia vía Albacete line. It was capable of doing 140 km/h (87 mph).

In 1986 it expanded to Barcelona and Zaragoza, it was capable of doing 160 km/h (99 mph). In 1987 Renfe received new 448 series electric trains, those also being capable of doing 160 km/h. In the main lines this service was combined with fast trains or Talgos. In the less used lines it was a once a day train, as daily fast train. The last line was Irún -Madrid, operated by a 448 series. This service closed in 2008.

In 2012 they opened new lines with the same denomination, making medium and long-distance routes.

The main differences between this line and the other ones is that it has more stops, trains stop in some lines every 15 minutes or less.
This service can be divided in 3 categories: 
-New lines using old Medium distance tracks, but with more stops. -Long-distance routes with intercity fares. -Old MD (Medium distance) lines, some of them are two older MD lines together.

=== Sweden ===
During the 1980s, InterCity denoted trains of the highest standard in Sweden, serving as a fast and comfortable connection between major Swedish cities. Trains used to be set up of the most modern cars, always including a restaurant car. During the 1990s the Swedish State Railways introduced the new X 2000 units which replaced the InterCity trains in this role. In 2012 SJ started running services with Regina X55 trainsets under the name SJ 3000, which replaced InterCity trains on even more routes. InterCity trains now serve an auxiliary role, and are mainly used on lines where the track standard is too low to allow X 2000 and SJ 3000 trains to be utilised to their full potential, or on services which call at smaller stations with shorter distances inbetween them. InterCity trains are set up of modernised cars pulled by Rc6 locomotives with a maximum speed of 160 km/h. Some lines have services with both InterCity, SJ 3000 and X 2000 trains. As of July 2024 InterCity trains serve the following routes:
*Stockholm – Arlanda – Uppsala – Sala – Avesta – Hedemora – Säter – Borlänge – Falun. Some trains continue from Borlänge via Gagnef – Leksand – Rättvik to Mora;
*Stockholm – Arlanda – Uppsala – Gävle – Ljusdal – Ånge – Bräcke – Östersund – Åre – Duved. Some trains run along the East Coast Line and Central Line via Söderhamn – Hudiksvall – Sundsvall instead of the Northern Main Line between Gävle – Ljusdal – Ånge.
*Stockholm – Arlanda – Uppsala – Tierp – Gävle – Ockelbo – Bollnäs – Arbrå – Järvsö – Ljusdal
*Stockholm – Södertälje – Katrineholm – Hallsberg – Degerfors – Kristinehamn – Karlstad. Some trains continue from Karlstad via Arvika – Kongsvinger to Oslo;
Apart from the SJ, there are other train operators in Sweden who also run trains of a similar type. Only SJ, however, uses the name &quot;InterCity&quot;. SJ also runs services with similar locomotive trains under the brand SJ Regional, mainly between Stockholm – Uppsala and Gothenburg – Kalmar, as well as night trains (SJ Nattåg) between Stockholm – Umeå, Gothenburg – Umeå, Stockholm – Östersund – Duved and Stockholm – Malmö. These are however not branded as InterCity services.

=== Switzerland ===


Swiss InterCity services started in 1982, replacing the on the line Geneva-St. Gallen. There is no surcharge for InterCity services in Switzerland and the rolling stock consists of three types of formations:
* Standard type IV carriages (, Einheitswagen IV) and driving trailers of type IC, the same as on InterRegio services. A normal train composition consists of a Re 460 locomotive, 8 to 12 carriages and a driving trailer. Seating capacity is up to 900, depending on the train composition. Most carriages have a small compartment for storing bicycles and/or skis at one end of the carriage; this end is marked by a bicycle drawn on the outside of the closest doors. The type IV carriages are the least wheelchair friendly as they require climbing the stairs to enter. Overall, 533 carriages and driving trailers are in operation.
* Double-decker IC 2000 carriages for lines with heavy commuter load. These trains are also powered by a Re 460 locomotive, can be composed of up to 9 carriages with one driving trailer and offer close to 1,000 seats. At present, about 320 carriages are in use.
* A tilting train category called ICN for lines with many curves. These trains are electric multiple units and hence require no locomotive. One such multiple unit consists of 7 carriages and has a seating capacity of 480 passengers: 125 in first class, 332 in second class, and 23 in the dining car (which is part of second class). The fleet of ICN trains comprise 44 units.
If needed, two ICN trains can be combined to double the passenger capacity. In addition, several type IV carriages can be attached to an IC 2000 train set on the other side of the locomotive, especially if a group reservation requires extra carriages.

All carriages are air conditioned. Each train formation has first and second class carriages and, in most cases, a restaurant/bistro carriage. The availability of power sockets is constantly improved, sometimes even in second class. The maximal speed of all train types is 200 km/h, except for about half of type IV carriages that have not yet been upgraded and have a maximum speed of 160 km/h.

InterCity trains serve most of Swiss cities and provide direct connections from Zürich and Geneva airports. The InterCity routes within Switzerland according to 2009–2010 schedule include:
* Lugano – Bellinzona – Arth-Goldau – Luzern - Zug – Zürich HB;

===Ukraine===
Intercity+ (max. 160 km/h ) train services in Ukraine :
* Kyiv – Kharkiv
* Kyiv – Zaporizhzhia
* Kyiv – Dnipro
* Kyiv Darnytsia – Lviv – Przemysl
* Kyiv Darnytsia – Lviv – Truskavets
* Kyiv Darnytsia – Odesa
There were trains from Kharkiv and Dnipro to Crimea and from Kyiv to Donetsk.
They were suspended in 2014, shortly after Ukraine have lost control of some of its territories.
Currently, a shortened connection to Donbas is in service:
* Kyiv – Sloviansk – Kostiantynivka
These services are operated by Hyundai Rotem HRCS2, Škoda UZ class 675, KVBZ Ekr1 &quot;Tarpan&quot; trains, and KVBZ &quot;Ukrajina&quot; locomotive-hauled train .

Intercity (70 km/h – 90 km/h) train services in Ukraine :
* Kyiv Darnytsia – Lviv
* Kyiv – Kryvyi Rih
* Kharkiv – Kyiv – Vinnytsia
* Kharkiv – Donetsk (Suspended in 2014)
* Dnipro – Donetsk (Suspended in 2014)

Intercity and Intercity+ trains are operated by Ukrainian Rapid Railway Company (a branch of Ukrzaliznytsia).

=== United Kingdom ===

The term &quot;Inter-City&quot; was first used by the state railway company British Rail in 1966, to brand all its longer-distance, higher-speed services (the hyphen was dropped shortly afterwards, changing the name to &quot;InterCity&quot;). The brand was closely associated with a new design of carriage, the Mark 2 which revolutionised levels of comfort on the system. The system was hugely successful and became one of the world&#x27;s few profitable public railway services.

Today, Britain&#x27;s railways having been privatised, InterCity trains in the UK are operated by many different train companies including Greater Anglia, Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Great Western Railway, London North Eastern Railway, East Midlands Railway, Hull Trains, Lumo, Transport for Wales, Abellio ScotRail, TransPennine Express, Caledonian Sleeper, Grand Central and Eurostar. Most of these companies operate their services from one of the many London termini, with CrossCountry being the exception, running from Cornwall to Scotland. If travelling via London it is often necessary to change stations: a journey from Norwich to Cardiff would require a transfer from London Liverpool Street to London Paddington station via the London Underground.

Currently, InterCity trains in United Kingdom mainly use Hitachi AT300 in the form of Class 800, Class 801, Class 802, Class 803, Class 805, Class 807 and Class 810. InterCity 125 (Class 43 power car + 4/5/8 Mark 3 coaches, also named as HST), InterCity 225 (Class 91 + 9 Mark 4 coaches), Class 90 + 8/9 Mark 3 coaches + Driving Van Trailer, Voyager family classes 220, 221 &amp; 222 (4–7 coach DEMUs), class 180 (5 coach DMUs), Class 745, and class 390 (9 or 11 coach EMUs) on the Intercity lines.

The British Government have named their project to replace the InterCity 125 as well as InterCity 225 as the Intercity Express Programme. The resultant bidding process was won by Hitachi and Angel Trains and resulted in the Hitachi Super Express Trains being introduced, which Hitachi later designated the AT300.

<doc id="1018048" wikidata="Q7691432" url="?curid=1018048" title="Team Antonsen">
<text>Team Antonsen was a Norwegian sketch comedy television program which was shown on TV in spring 2004 on the Norwegian public channel NRK. The show consisted of four well-known comedians: Atle Antonsen, Harald Eia, Bård Tufte Johansen and Kristopher Schau performing various sketches.

The program also gave rise to a live performance in Oslo Spektrum in May 2004, called &quot;Team Antonsen Live: One Night Only&quot;. Originally only one performance was planned, but because the tickets were sold out, an additional performance was staged, &quot;Team Antonsen Live: One More Night Only&quot;.

The show typically made fun of spoken Nynorsk and Sami, as well as regional dialects from all over Norway—most commonly from Northern Norway and the cities of Bergen and Trondheim. Celebrities often appeared on the show—among others famous writer Anne Holt and accomplished singer Bertine Zetlitz. Team Antonsen had an average viewer-rating of over 700 000 viewers, a high figure for a late-night TV show in a country with 4.6 million people.

The show also spawned a stage comedy show called &quot;Team Antonsen Live: One Night Only&quot;, which was performed in Oslo Spektrum in May 2004. The comedians originally only planned one showing, but when tickets sold out they decided on performing one more, called &quot;Team Antonsen Live: One More Night Only&quot;.

The series won several Norwegian comedy awards, most notably the 2004 &quot;Gullruten&quot; for best humor show, &quot;Komiprisen&quot; for best show, as well as &quot;Komiprisen&quot; viewer&#x27;s award for their sketch &quot;Hjemme hos Haakon Børde&quot; (&quot;At Home with Haakon Børde&quot;).

Team Eckbo was a continuation of Team Antonsen which replaced Schau with fellow Norwegian comedian Espen Eckbo. Eckbo took over Antonsen&#x27;s role as the &quot;leader&quot; of the team. Antonsen, Schau, Tufte Johansen and Eia have performed together and with others in various configurations both before and after Team Antonsen, including the TV shows &quot;Midt i smørøyet&quot;, &quot;Lille lørdag&quot;, &quot;Åpen post&quot;, &quot;Storbynatt&quot;, Hjernevask, &quot;Tre brødre som ikke er brødre&quot;, &quot;Uti vår hage 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; and radio shows Verdensherredømme and &quot;Kommisjonen&quot; (on Kanal 24) / &quot;Misjonen&quot; (on P4).

<doc id="1018056" wikidata="Q3303740" url="?curid=1018056" title="British Rail Class 180">
<text>The British Rail Class 180 is a class of 14 diesel-hydraulic multiple unit passenger trains manufactured by Alstom at its Washwood Heath factory in 2000–01 for First Great Western (FGW). They are part of the Coradia 1000 family, along with the Class 175.

All Class 180s are owned by Angel Trains. Operations of the fleet commenced with FGW during December 2001, being tasked with express commuter services that used its capability. However, the type suffered frequent service disruptions due to recurring technical problems, particularly in regards to its hydraulic transmission system. FGW ultimately decided to return all of its Class 180s to the lessor in favour of refurbished InterCity 125 sets; the last train leaving its service in 2009. The Class 180s were held in storage for a time before new operators were secured.

During 2008, Hull Trains replaced its Class 222 fleet with several of the Class 180 sets; it operated the type through to 2020 until its replacement by Class 802 sets. Starting in 2009, Grand Central also leased several Class 180s; it operated the type exclusively until November 2023 when it introduced Class 221s onto some services. Five Class 180 sets also returned to service with FGW; the operator&#x27;s first refurbished unit was introduced on 28 May 2012. These five sets have since been transferred to Grand Central.

The four units formerly used by Hull Trains were transferred to East Midlands Railway, the first entering service in January 2020; these four units were withdrawn by East Midlands Railway in May 2023. Several proposed operators, such as First Harrogate Trains and Platinum Trains, also envisioned operating Class 180s; however, their track access applications were rejected by the Office of Road and Rail (ORR).

== Background ==
As a part of its agreement to operate the Greater Western franchise, First Great Western (FGW) was required to increase the frequency of its express service from London Paddington to Cardiff to half-hourly. In order to do this, the operator required additional rolling stock suitable for high-speed long distance services. In October 1997, FGW ordered fourteen five-carriage Alstom Coradia diesel multiple-units (DMU) from Alstom; these were broadly similar to the Class 175s that were then under construction for sister company First North Western, the most noticeable difference being the ability to reach speeds of up to .

On 18 April 2000, the first unit was publicly unveiled. Due to late-stage difficulties encountered, the commencement of full main-line testing was postponed until December 2000. Despite this six-month schedule slippage, Alstom openly claimed that the trains would be capable of entering service in time for the May 2001 timetable change. The first entered regular service in December 2001. Due to their delayed entry into service, in May 2001 FGW was forced to introduce Class 47 hauled Mark 2 sets on London Paddington to Penzance services to release InterCity 125 sets for additional Cardiff services.

== Description ==
There are 14 Class 180 sets, numbered 180101-180114. There are five cars per unit: two Standard Class Driving Motors, two Standard Class Intermediate Motors and a First Class Intermediate Motor. All coaches are equipped with a Cummins QSK19 diesel engine, which develops at 2,100 rpm.

The trains feature a hydraulic transmission supplied by Voith, which is a three-speed type, with integral hydrodynamic braking (rated at 750 kW short term, 420 kW continuous). One bogie per coach is powered, with both axles driven. Total vehicle weight is 278 tonnes. The units feature Scharfenberg couplers.

== Operations ==
=== Current operators ===
==== Grand Central ====

Grand Central initially planned to operate a pair of Class 180s on its London King&#x27;s Cross to Sunderland service, having secured the rights to a fourth daily service in each direction. During early 2009, a pair of Class 180s started being operated by the company in conjunction with its three High Speed Trains (HSTs). Grand Central had initially announced that the two units would run as a ten-car train; it subsequently stated that they would be run separately for greater flexibility. Grand Central initially gave its Class 180s the fleet name &quot;Zephyr&quot;; the established &quot;Adelante&quot; name was later re-introduced. Maintenance is carried out at Heaton TMD and Crofton TMD.

During 2010, Grand Central commenced the lease of an additional three Class 180 units for the launch of its new services to . Originally, the service was intended to be operated under the brand name &quot;Grand Northern&quot;, as part of the parent company Grand Union; in practice, it has been operated as Grand Central so that units can be interchanged between the two routes.

Prior to entering service with Grand Central, the fleet was subject to modification work undertaken by Railcare, during which it was outfitted with Wi-Fi and at-seat sockets, amongst other changes to the amenities. In August 2011, one of the initial two units, 180112, was named &quot;James Herriot&quot; at a ceremony held at London King&#x27;s Cross; it was also the first train to carry Grand Central&#x27;s new logo and orange stripe livery. During September 2009, the units entered revenue service in September 2009, while the Bradford service was launched on 23 May 2010.

Other sets also received individual names. During October 2010, 180107 was named &quot;Hart of the North&quot; as a result of a public competition conducted through the &quot;Hartlepool Mail&quot;, while 180105 became as &quot;The Yorkshire Artist&quot; by the artist Ashley Jackson in October 2011, and 180108 was named &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; during April 2018.

From July 2016, the train operator Arriva Rail North operated a peak morning working between Halifax and Leeds via Bradford, which was worked using a single Class 180 set that was subleased from Grand Central. This arrangement released other DMUs to cover the reduction in the number of units available to hire from TransPennine Express.

During 2017, Grand Central received the remaining five Class 180s that had been previously operated by First Great Western. Their arrival permitted not only the replacement of the company&#x27;s HST fleet but also the expansion of its services. In 2018, a refurbishment programme for all 10 of Grand Central&#x27;s sets commenced at Arriva TrainCare, Eastleigh.

In August 2023 Grand Central leased two of the sets which had been withdrawn by East Midlands Railway in May that same year.

=== Former operators ===
==== First Great Western ====

The Class 180 fleet was first operated by First Great Western which gave the type the brand name &quot;Adelante&quot;. They were originally deployed on services from to via and via . On occasion, units were also operated to Paignton.

While operated by FGW, the Class 180 suffered from numerous technical problems, including instances of the doors closing and locking quickly. These difficulties were persistent enough that the train operator decided to begin the early replacement of the Class 180 on the majority of its services, instead opting for considerably older HSTs that had been formerly operated by Midland Mainline before their replacement by Class 222s. FGW later re-leased five Class 180s for operating express commuter services from London Paddington to , Worcester, and .

A combination of factors, not only the reliability problems experienced but also increasing passenger numbers, reportedly led to FGW deciding to acquire additional refurbished HST sets towards the end of 2007, which became the replacement for Class 180s on the express commuter services. Between 2007 and 2009, the majority of the fleet was returned to the leasing company Angel Trains.

Although FGW had planned to return the entire fleet in December 2007, it decided to retain three units until the operator took delivery of a cascaded HST from National Express East Coast. A pair of the units operated in multiple on an early-morning Oxford to London commuter service, before being divided to work independently the rest of the day (after returning as empty stock to Oxford) on the Cotswold Line from Paddington to Worcester and Hereford. On 30 March 2009, FGW&#x27;s final Class 180 service was operated. The remainder were placed in store from December 2007 at Oxley TRSMD.

During 2009, five Class 180 units (102-104, 106 and 108) were leased by East Coast; they were intended to be operated on new services, however these were abandoned. Thus, all five were returned to FGW, where they were used to increase capacity on Thames Valley services, while three units were operated by Northern Rail in the interim. The Class 180s were subsequently re-introduced on the Cotswold Line, which released and &quot;Turbo&quot; DMUs for use on Thames Valley services.

On 28 May 2012, the first refurbished Class 180 commenced passenger service. GWR&#x27;s Class 180s were maintained at Old Oak Common TMD. During the late 2010s, the type was replaced by new-build Class 800; accordingly, all five units were transferred to Grand Central in 2017.

==== Northern Rail ====

During the mid-2000s, Northern Rail leased three Class 180 units (103, 106 and 108); these sets entered service in December 2008. They were operated from and to and , prior to the end of 2012. These Class 180s were sub-leased from East Coast until the operator could obtain additional long-term rolling stock. The three units were to have transferred to East Coast after the 18-month contract finished in November 2010. However, East Coast changed its plans and no longer required them, so they remained with Northern Rail until December 2011, at which point Northern Rail took delivery of Class 150s formerly used by London Midland. The last of Northern Rail&#x27;s Class 180s was withdrawn on 2 December 2011. Following their refurbishment, all three units returned to service with First Great Western.

==== Hull Trains ====

During 2008, Hull Trains arranged for the lease of two Class 180 units to replace a damaged Class 222; these were initially operated alongside the remaining Class 222s between and Hull. Later that year, Hull Trains opted to release its Class 222s to East Midlands Trains and replace them with additional Class 180s. The acquired units underwent an internal refit, which included the installation of laptop sockets and new coffee machines; this refurbishment programme was completed in early 2012.

In January 2009, the first of Hull Trains&#x27; Class 180 units entered service. The type provided more capacity than the operator&#x27;s prior rolling stock, having an additional carriage. However, around their introduction, the Class 180 units were plagued by technical difficulties, and a period of poor reliability for the company followed. However, their reliability since their introduction has improved considerably. Hull Trains opted to refresh their Class 180s, performing a deep clean internally along with the addition of new seat covers and fresh catering facilities for first class passengers, while external work included their repainting into FirstGroup&#x27;s neon blue livery. Due to the Class 180&#x27;s reliability problems, a HST set was hired from Great Western Railway in February 2019. In April 2019, Hull Trains introduced another HST for the same purpose.

Prior to 2018, the fleet operated by Hull Trains were maintained alongside the FGW fleet at Old Oak Common TMD in London. After FGW ceased operating Class 180s, the majority of maintenance tasks were transferred to Bombardier Transportation at Crofton TMD. During early 2020, Hull Trains opted to replace its fleet with new-build Class 802s. The former Hull Trains Class 180s were subsequently transferred to East Midlands Railway. The first of East Midlands&#x27; Class 180 units entered service during December 2020.

==== Arriva Rail North ====
On 11 July 2016, Arriva Rail North commenced the lease of a single Class 180 from sister Arriva company Grand Central; it ran once per day from Monday to Friday to provide additional peak time capacity on the Calder Valley Line. By the May 2018 timetable, the unit was diagrammed to operate a morning peak service from Hebden Bridge to Leeds, and an evening peak return; both services called at all stations en-route, except for .

==== East Midlands Railway====

As part of its contract to operate the East Midlands franchise, East Midlands Railway announced that it would lease the four units once released by Hull Trains as part of its commitment to replace all its HSTs with more accessible stock. These were operated alongside the Class 222s on EMR&#x27;s Intercity services between London St Pancras and Nottingham.

In January 2020, the first pair arrived at Derby Etches Park. By August 2020, EMR had received all four of the Class 180s, despite the transfer of the last two units being delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and driver training commenced during the following month.

In September 2020, the first unit, 180111, emerged from Derby Etches Park in EMR livery. On 13 December 2020, all entered service.

In 2021, 180110 was converted to a four-carriage set with carriage 56910 removed due to excessive corrosion. From July until September 2022, Class 180s operated Summer Saturday services from Derby to Skegness.

All were scheduled to be directly replaced by new Class 810 units, but in March 2023 it was confirmed that EMR&#x27;s Class 180 fleet would be withdrawn at the May 2023 timetable change even though the first Class 810 are not expected to enter service until 2024.

East Midlands Railway withdrew its Class 180 fleet in May 2023.

=== Aborted proposals ===
==== East Coast ====
In March 2008, National Express East Coast (NXEC) requested additional services to a number of destinations in its application for access rights on the East Coast Main Line, stating that, in addition to its existing InterCity 125 and InterCity 225 sets, it would require as many as nine Class 180 units. The routes proposed were London to Lincoln (with one train per day extended to Cleethorpes) and London to Harrogate via York. Following NXEC&#x27;s demise, successor East Coast decided to press ahead with the plans with three Class 180s temporarily sub-leased to Northern Rail. However, the planned services were never introduced,

==== First Harrogate Trains ====
During the late 2000s, First Harrogate Trains proposed to operate services from London King&#x27;s Cross to Harrogate with Class 180s. The company&#x27;s track access application was rejected by the Office of Rail Regulation as the proposed route was deemed to largely duplicate those already provisioned by NXEC, leading to economic concerns.

==== Platinum Trains ====
In the late 2000s, Platinum Trains had planned to use Class 180 units on an Aberdeen to London King&#x27;s Cross service. The company&#x27;s track access application was rejected by the Office of Rail Regulation, primarily due to concerns over the ratio of revenue abstraction (from existing operators) to revenue generation (from new travellers), and secondarily that the journey times sought would be difficult to regularly achieve.

==== Virgin Trains ====
During 2008, the train operating company Virgin Trains West Coast leased a pair of Class 180 units from Angel Trains, intending to use them as standby units on the West Coast Main Line following the loss of a Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot; in the Grayrigg derailment. Described as &#x27;strategic standby&#x27; units by the company, they were ultimately returned to Angel Trains without ever being used following the decision to use a Class 90 locomotive and Mark 3 coaching stock instead.

<text>Vochysiaceae is a plant family belonging to the order Myrtales.

==Description==
Trees or shrubs with opposite leaves; flowers are zygomorph 1-(3)-5 merous; ovary inferior or superior; one fertile stamen; fruits samara or capsules.

==Biogeography==
Six of the eight genera are native to the Neotropics. The genera &quot;Erismadelphus&quot; and &quot;Korupodendron&quot; are native to West and Central Africa.

==Evolutionary history==
The family likely originated in South America. &quot;Erismadelphus&quot; is thought to have diverged from &quot;Erisma&quot; approximately 30 million years ago, and traveled to Africa as the result of long-distance dispersal.

==Systematics==
Vochysiaceae are closest to Myrtaceae. Vochysiaceae consist of 7 genera with 217 species. The family is classified into two tribes:

Tribe Erismeae : one inferior ovary and winged fruits 
* &quot;Erisma&quot; Rudge (20 species)
* &quot;Erismadelphus&quot; Mildbr. (2 species)
* &quot;Korupodendron&quot; Litt &amp; Cheek (1 species)

Tribe Vochysieae: three fused superior ovaries and capsule fruits 
* &quot;Callisthene&quot; Mart. (10 species)
* &quot;Qualea&quot; Aubl. (60 species)
* &quot;Salvertia&quot; A.St.-Hil. (1 species)
* &quot;Ruizterania&quot; Marc.-Bert. (19 species)
* &quot;Vochysia&quot; Aubl. (105 species)

The genus &quot;Euphronia&quot;, previously included in Vochysiaceae, is unrelated and now stands alone in the family Euphroniaceae, more closely related to the family Chrysobalanaceae.

<text>This page shows the results of leadership elections in the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party (known as the Farmer-Labour Party from 1932 to 1934, and the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation from 1934 to 1967). Prior to 2001, the leader was elected via a delegated convention. Following the resignation of Roy Romanow, the leader was chosen through a One Member One Vote election.

==1932 Farmer-Labour Party leadership convention==

(Held on July 27, 1932.)

*M.J. Coldwell acclaimed

Note: The Farmer-Labour Party was launched as a merger of Coldwell&#x27;s Independent Labour Party of Saskatchewan and George Williams&#x27;s United Farmers of Canada (Saskatchewan Section). Williams was nominated as a candidate, but withdrew in favour of Coldwell.

==Developments, 1932-1936==

In 1933, the Saskatchewan Farmer-Labour Party became the Saskatchewan branch of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. Coldwell was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1935, and Williams was chosen as the Saskatchewan CCF&#x27;s acting leader on December 16, 1935. Coldwell&#x27;s resignation from the party leadership was not made official until July 17, 1936.

==1936 Cooperative Commonwealth Federation leadership convention==

(Held on July 17, 1936.)

*George Williams acclaimed

==Developments, 1936-1942==

In 1940, Carlyle King challenged George Williams for the presidency of the party (Williams was both party president and leader) but received only about one-third of the vote.

Williams joined the Canadian Forces in early 1941, and subsequently saw overseas action in World War II. On February 12, 1941, John Brockelbank was chosen to lead the party in the legislature. Williams still retained the position of party president until 1941, when Tommy Douglas successfully challenged Williams for the party presidency. The next year, Douglas also unseated Williams as party leader.

==1942 Cooperative Commonwealth Federation leadership convention==

(Held on July 17, 1942.)

<text>ITV Digital Channels Limited (formerly known as Granada Sky Broadcasting) is a wholly owned subsidiary of British broadcaster ITV plc. It manages all of the company&#x27;s television channels with the exception of ITV1, which is part of the entire network.

It was set up in 1996 and operated until 2004 as a joint venture between Granada plc and British Sky Broadcasting to launch a range of television channels broadcasting the Granada and LWT archives on the Sky satellite platform, as well as other digital platforms such as ITV Digital (closed on 1 May 2002), NTL and Telewest (both later merged to form Virgin Media). 

On 2 February 2004, Granada plc merged with Carlton Communications to form ITV plc, which fully purchased ITV Digital Channels in November of that year.

==History==

===1996–2002: Launch, digital expansion and rebrands===

In 1996, Granada plc and BSkyB agreed to create a joint venture to operate four services on Sky and other cable platforms. The services were:
* Granada Plus, an archive channel using the Granada and LWT archives (de-branded from Granada on 9 September 2002)
* Granada Men &amp; Motors, a channel aimed at men, focused on motoring and erotic content (de-branded from Granada on 12 August 2001)
* Granada Good Life, a women&#x27;s lifestyle channel (renamed to Breeze on 1 May 1998)
* Granada Talk TV, a talk shows channel (closed on 31 August 1997 due to low ratings)
The GSkyB portfolio greatly increased its reach with the launch of ONdigital, which Granada and Carlton, another dominant ITV rights holder, were funding, in October and November 1998. Granada Plus and Men &amp; Motors performed well in ratings, but Breeze struggled to attract viewers, leading to budget cuts that resulted in original programming being cut and 60 jobs being lost. In December 2001, the decision was made to close the channel with a gradual closure across digital platforms. It was finally closed on 30 April 2002 to honour contracts with Telewest and NTL. 

Throughout 2001 and 2002, the channels began to disassociate from Granada branding. Men &amp; Motors received a major rebrand in August 2001, and the Granada brand was dropped from Plus in September 2002.

===2003–2004: Uncertain future===
In late November 2003, the future of GSkyB was thrown into uncertainty as Granada and Carlton – soon to merge as ITV plc – looked to increase their multichannel presence. ITV Gold was conceived as a new archive channel similar to Plus, but over time this evolved to ITV3, with Plus&#x27; first run rights to archive drama being sought after for the new channel. ITV was also negotiating with Sky over carriage of ITV3, eventually reaching an impasse due to the lack of EPG space on some Sky Digiboxes. It was later announced with carriage on Freeview, NTL and Telewest, but with no Sky carriage. Many had expected GSkyB to either be sold or closed entirely, an option ITV considered as it began the sale of non-core assets. 

===2004–present: ITV plc control and multichannel expansion===
On 1 November 2004, ITV plc agreed to purchase BSkyB&#x27;s stake in GSkyB for £10 million. The deal included the slot that Granada Plus was broadcasting on, which ITV used to broadcast its new ITV3 channel which replaced Plus on the same day. The negotiations that led to ITV plc taking sole control of GSkyB, closing Plus and launching ITV3 on digital satellite were apparently completed just hours before the new channel started broadcasting. On 8 November, Granada Sky Broadcasting was renamed ITV Digital Channels Limited, shortly after the closure of Granada Plus left Men &amp; Motors as the sole survivor of the original four channels. As part of ITV&#x27;s buy-out of Sky&#x27;s shareholding, Sky would have received 49.5% of any proceeds (net of liabilities) from any future sale of Men &amp; Motors. The newly renamed company was given the brief of running all of ITV&#x27;s digital services, with the major difference from the former GSkyB operation being that its channels were now free-to-air and carried the ITV brand. 

On 2 May 2005, Men &amp; Motors launched as a free-to-air channel on the Freeview digital terrestrial television service. It was rumoured that ITV plc would replace it with ITV4, another men&#x27;s channel, when it launched later that year on 1 November, echoing the launch of ITV3 in 2004. However, after better than expected performance from Men &amp; Motors as a free-to-air channel, both channels continued and ITV plc cut the hours of the ITV News Channel to make way for ITV4 and CITV instead. The news channel closed on 23 December of that year with its remaining bandwidth used for CITV.

Although ITV4 started broadcasting from the Astra satellite on 1 November, it was not placed on the Sky EPG until 7 November. Because of this, some ITV4 sports programming was simulcast on Men &amp; Motors under the &quot;ITV4 on m&amp;m&quot; strand. On 23 February 2006, despite the previous decision not to close Men &amp; Motors, fresh rumours over the channel&#x27;s future began to circulate due to poorer than expected performance from ITV4. In April 2006, Men &amp; Motors left Freeview to make way for the launch of ITV Play, and much of its content was moved over to ITV4. ITV intended to dispose of the channel as a non-core asset, but it ultimately closed on Virgin Media on 25 March 2010, and finally closed on Sky and Freesat on 1 April, to make way for a permanent EPG position for ITV HD.

In 2014, ITV&#x27;s portfolio of channels was expanded with the launch of ITV Encore, a drama channel, and ITVBe, a reality and lifestyle channel. The launch of the latter lead to ITV2&#x27;s repositioning as a youth-focused entertainment channel. In 2018, ITV closed the Encore channel and repositioned its content to the ITV Hub online service. In 2021, commissions for ITV2, ITVBe and CITV were altered in that they would debut first on the ITV Hub, then on the linear channels, whilst ITV2 was given a wider brief for producing factual content.

The CITV channel closed on 1 September 2023, with programming moved to streaming service ITVX. A daily programming block was introduced on ITV2 from 2 September 2023, from 05:00 to 09:00, using the &quot;CITV&quot; brand.

<text>Jean Danysz (11 March 1884 – 4 November 1914) born Jan Kazimierz Danysz, was a French physicist of Polish extraction. He was an assistant of Maria Skłodowska-Curie and notable in the development of beta spectrometry.

Danysz made considerable advances on the magnetic deflection techniques of Baeyer, Hahn and Meitner, placing the source (he used radium) in a capillary tube under a slit, with a photographic plate in the same horizontal plane. By this means the known number of lines (later understood to be conversion lines) superimposed on the beta energy spectrum of RaB + RaC went from 9 to 27 (later work by Robinson and Rutherford found 64; 16 from RaB and 48 from RaC). He finished his doctoral thesis in 1913, and by 1914 he was considered by Rutherford as a leading researcher into beta decay, but he did no further work. He enlisted in the French army in 1914 and was killed in action near Cormicy.

<text>Stefan Printz-Påhlson is a writer/editor of Disney comics at Egmont Creative in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 1994 he created the Walt Disney character Princess Oona together with his wife Unn Printz-Påhlson, and Chilean artist Victor Arriagada Rios (better known as Vicar). To date about 30 stories have been made with Princess Oona, and they have been published in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Hungary, Brazil, and Russia.

The same year Stefan Printz-Påhlson also wrote the first story about Tachyon Farflung, a master criminal from outer space. Tachyon Farflung&#x27;s main interest is to steal Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s money bin, thereby making him the greatest criminal in the known Universe.

<doc id="1018073" wikidata="Q6244275" url="?curid=1018073" title="John Le Gay Brereton">
<text>John Le Gay Brereton (2 September 1871 – 2 February 1933) was an Australian poet, critic and professor of English at the University of Sydney. He was the first president of the Fellowship of Australian Writers when it was formed in Sydney in 1928.

==Early life==
Brereton was born in Sydney, the fifth son of John Le Gay Brereton (1827–1886), a well-known Sydney physician who published five volumes of verse between 1857 and 1887, and his wife Mary, née Tongue. His parents had travelled on the &quot;Dover Castle&quot; from England, arriving in Melbourne on 25 July 1859 and then moved to Sydney. The younger Brereton was educated at Sydney Grammar School from 1881 and the University of Sydney where he graduated BA (1894), reading English under Professor Sir Mungo MacCallum. He was editor of &quot;Hermes&quot;, the student literary annual, and became the university&#x27;s chief librarian in 1915.

Brereton became a vegetarian in his youth and never lapsed throughout his life.

==Career==
Brereton had several occupations and continued his writing, in 1896 he published &quot;Perdita, A Sonnet Record&quot;, and &quot;The Song of Brotherhood and Other Verses&quot;. These were followed in 1897 by &quot;Sweetheart Mine: Lyrics of Love and Friendship&quot; and by &quot;Landlopers&quot; in (1899), mostly prose, based on a walking tour with Dowell Philip O&#x27;Reilly. The verse in Brereton&#x27;s earlier volumes was pleasant but not very distinguished; however, &quot;Sea and Sky&quot; (1908) contained stronger work. In 1909 his volume &quot;Elizabethan Drama Notes and Studies&quot; proclaimed him a scholar of unusual ability and knowledge, and his studies in this period stimulated him to write his one-act play in blank verse &quot;To-Morrow: A Dramatic Sketch of the Character and Environment of Robert Greene&quot;. This is possibly the best Australian poetical play of its period, and has the merit belonging to comparatively few Australian plays that it is actable.

World War I led to Brereton producing a slender volume of verse published in 1919, &quot;The Burning Marl&quot;, dedicated to &quot;All who have fought nobly&quot;. In 1921 he was appointed professor of English literature at the University of Sydney.

Brereton produced a volume of poems, &quot;Swags Up&quot; (1928), and a collection of his prose articles and stories was published under the title of &quot;Knocking Round&quot; (1930). The sketches of Henry Lawson and Dowell O&#x27;Reilly are of particular interest. His edition of &quot;Lust&#x27;s Dominion&quot; was sent to the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium in 1914 but was thought lost in the German invasion; it was finally published there in 1931. &quot;So Long, Mick!&quot; a short one-act play in prose, was also published in 1931. Brereton contributed many letters and poems on diverse subjects to the Sydney Morning Herald, often under the pseudonym &#x27;Basil Garstang&#x27;.

==Legacy==
Brereton died suddenly on 2 February 1933 near Tamworth, New South Wales while on a caravan tour. He had married in 1900 Winifred Odd, who survived him with a daughter and four sons. 
As an Elizabethan scholar, his only rival in Australia in his day was Ernest Henry Clark Oliphant. His prose work was interesting and sensitive, and the best of his verse gives him an assured place among Australian poets. He was entirely unselfish and did much for Lawson when he was most in need of friends.

He was a close friend of and collaborator with Henry Lawson (whom he met in late 1894 through Mary Cameron, later Dame Mary Gilmore), and Christopher Brennan. For at least part of his life, he was a disciple of Annie Besant.

Brereton Park in East Ryde is named in his honour.

Brereton admitted to being profoundly affected by Christopher Marlowe and Walt Whitman, and several of his emotionally intense poems addressed to men, such as &#x27;Cling To Me&#x27; (&quot;Cling to me, love, and dare not let me go; Kiss me as though it were our time to die, And all our comradeship had drifted by...Over our love what shelter can I throw?&quot;), have been anthologised in collections of homosexual verse, including &quot;Australian Gay and Lesbian Writing: An Anthology&quot; (1993), &quot;Sexual Heretics: Male homosexuality in English literature from 1850 to 1900&quot; (1970), and &quot;The Penguin Book of Homosexual Verse&quot; (1983).

<text>:&quot;Leonessa is also the name of a &quot;frazione&quot; of Bassano Romano.&quot;
Leonessa is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the far northeastern part of the Province of Rieti in the Lazio region of central Italy. Its population in 2008 was around 2,700.

Situated in a small plain at the foot of Mt. Terminillo, one of the highest mountains of the Apennine range, in the winter Leonessa is known mostly as a low-key staging center for the ski slopes of the Terminillo, and in the summer as a weekend vacation town frequented for the most part by Romans with local roots.

Historically, the town is known mostly as the birthplace of St. Giuseppe di Leonessa. Until 1927 it was part of the province of L&#x27;Aquila. The town suffered one of the worst German reprisals during World War II when the Wehrmacht and the SS killed 51 inhabitants in early April 1944. A monument dedicated to the dead was erected in 1959.
Typical food production include the local variety of potato, known as &quot;patata di Leonessa&quot;.

Leonessa is twinned with the French town of Gonesse.

<doc id="1018084" wikidata="Q672565" url="?curid=1018084" title="British Rail Class 185">
<text>The British Rail Class 185 [[Siemens Desiro|&quot;Desiro&quot;]] is a class of diesel-hydraulic multiple-unit (DHMU) passenger trains built by Siemens Transportation Systems in Germany for the train operating company First TransPennine Express. They are currently operated by TransPennine Express.

A £260 million order for 51 three-car trains and associated maintenance depots was placed in 2003, and deliveries took place between 2006 and 2007.

== Background and history ==

In 2003, First TransPennine Express (FTPE), a consortium of FirstGroup and Keolis, was awarded the TransPennine Express (TPE) franchise. One obligation under the franchise agreement was to introduce a new fleet of diesel multiple units, capable of operating at speeds up to . Also specified was air conditioning, two toilets per vehicle with one suitable for reduced-mobility passengers, gangways between individual carriages, luggage and bicycle storage space, passenger compartment CCTV, provision for wheelchair passengers, and first-class seating. Additionally, the train&#x27;s acceleration was to be an improvement on the , and comparable to the . The agreement specified 168 carriages, with an initial option to reduce the carriage order by 18.

The franchise agreement also required the construction of two depots for the new rolling stock; the main depot was to be at Manchester, with a depot for stabling and maintenance at York. In addition, a depot at Cleethorpes was to be upgraded with refuelling and controlled emission toilet servicing facilities, and a train electric auxiliary supply. The franchise agreement specified a performance aim of per casualty, with entry into service between March 2006 (first unit) and November 2006 (entire fleet).

By August 2003, Siemens had been named as the preferred bidder for the trains. A contract for supply and maintenance of 56 trains was signed in September 2003. The new train requirement was reduced from 56 to 51 units by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) by 2004.

The trains were built at Siemens&#x27; plant in Uerdingen in Krefeld; the first unit began test trials at the Wildenrath test circuit in July 2005. An official launch took place at Wildenrath on 24 November 2005.

Construction of the Ardwick train depot began March 2005 and was completed in 2006. Work started on the new Leeman Road depot in York in December 2005; opening followed in May 2007. In 2006, FTPE acquired two static simulators for driver training from Corys TESS.

All 51 trains were in service by January 2007. The trains replaced two and three-car and 175 units.

==Design==

Each vehicle carries its own powertrain, driving both axles on one of the vehicle&#x27;s bogies via cardan shafts. Each powertrain consists of a Cummins QSK19 turbo-diesel engine driving a Voith T312bre three-speed hydrokinetic transmission, which in turn drives the axles via Voith SK-485 and KE-485 final drives. The other bogie on each vehicle is unpowered. The engine and torque converter were frame-mounted underfloor and suspended from the car body by flexible mounts. A third underfloor module contains cooling systems and an electrical generator. The transmission includes an integrated hydraulic retarder. Cooling fans and the electrical generator are powered via a hydrostatic drive. The electrical generator provides a 400 V 50 Hz three phase electrical supply for the train, which is transformed or rectified to a 230 V 50 Hz single phase supply, a 110 V DC auxiliary supply, and a 24 V DC battery supply. Connections bridge the main 400 V AC and 110 V DC supplies across the cars of each train set. Component suppliers included Dellner (couplings), ZF (dampers), SKF (bearings), and Westinghouse Brakes (now Knorr-Bremse, braking systems).

The bogies are derivatives of Siemens&#x27; SF5000 type, and were manufactured in Graz, Austria. The design has a distance between each axle of , with radial-arm primary suspension utilising steel coil springs with rubber elements; the secondary suspension is an air spring design supporting a bolster. Motor bogies have traction forces transmitted from bogie to frame via rods from a centre pivot. Mechanical brakes are wheel mounted discs. The Class 185 is heavier and has a stiffer suspension than the Class 158 it replaced on some routes; On some routesincluding the Hope Valley Line, York to Scarborough Line, Hull to Selby Line, and between and the Class 185 units were not permitted to operate at the same speeds as Sprinter-type DMUs; however the higher acceleration of the Class 185 units could be used to partially offset the lower speed restriction. Between Northallerton and Middlesbrough, Class 185s and Sprinters now use the same speed limits.

As delivered each train consisted of three cars; one end car (DMOSB) had 64 standard class seats in [2+2] arrangement with a mixture of facing seats with tables and airline style arrangements, as well as luggage and bicycle facilities; the middle car (MOSL) had 72 standard class seats also in a mixture of arrangements in [2+2] formation, and incorporated a standard toilet; the other end car (DMOCLW) had a further 18 standard class seats, and 15 [2+1] arrangement first class seats, plus a wheelchair space, and a reduced mobility access toilet. Toilets were supplied by Driessen, seats by Grammer and Fainsa, and air conditioning by Air International Transit.

===Eco-Mode===
The trains were designed for the steep hills encountered on the TransPennine routes; as a result the units had a high installed power, unnecessary for most of the train&#x27;s route sections, leading to low fuel efficiency relative to other DMUs. In mid-2007, Siemens and First TransPennine Express began a programme, named &#x27;Eco-Mode&#x27;, to improve the efficiency of the fleet. The project involved generating driver information giving route advice allowing more efficient driving, including information on when it was feasible to shut down a diesel engine, leaving the train &#x27;cruising&#x27; on two of the three engines. Additionally fuel consumption was reduced by performing shunting using only one engine, and automating complete engine shutdown at depots. Initial changes in working practice resulted in a 7% fuel saving. Furthermore, as the engines are idling less and thus operating less (engine hours reduced by two hours a day per train), their service life may be extended by 15%.

==Operations==

=== TransPennine Express ===
The 51 three-car Class 185 units, together with nine two-car Class 170 units, replaced the Class 158 (North and South TransPennine Express routes), Class 175 (routes between Manchester Airport and Blackpool / Cumbria). To free up stock for services between Manchester Airport and destinations in Scotland when First TransPennine Express first took over these routes, the frequency of the Manchester Airport to Windermere route was reduced from December 2007.

In 2014, the introduction of ten electric Class 350 units on services between Manchester and Scotland allowed the displacement of Class 170 and some Class 185 units to provide additional capacity on FTPE&#x27;s network. Two (originally four) Class 185 units were loaned to Arriva Rail North from April 2016 until May 2019.

Following the introduction of the new &quot;Nova&quot; fleet in 2019 and 2020, it was originally planned and expected that 22 Class 185 units would return to Eversholt Rail Group. However, in September 2019, TransPennine Express announced that it would only be returning 15, with the remaining units being required to operate diversionary services during upgrades to the TransPennine route. In June 2020, TransPennine Express confirmed that the return of 15 sets would be postponed until further notice.

====Overcrowding and passenger feedback====

In 2007, Passenger Focus published a user survey on the Class 185. Satisfaction ratings of around 80% were given for many standard aspects of a train journey, such as availability of seats, seat comfort, ease of egression, cleanliness. Passengers gave satisfaction ratings of around only 70% on standing space availability. Lower averaged satisfaction ratings (~50%) were given for wheelchair space, bicycle space and for the inability to shield the sun, as well as overall design, and position and number of bins. Frequent travellers had a low level of satisfaction with toilet cleanliness. The report concluded that overall users liked the new trains, but identified issues relating to peak crowding, particularly on evening peaks.

By 2007, increased use of some of the First TransPennine Express services (Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds) caused the operator to start lobbying the SRA for a fourth car to the three-car sets to increase capacity; however, the service overall was subsidised, presenting a cost barrier to further rolling stock leasing. By 2008, many of the peak-time trains operated by Class 185s on First TransPennine Express services were suffering chronic overcrowding.

==== Refurbishment ====
In June 2017, TransPennine Express began refurbishing Class 185s as part of its franchise commitments. The first unit was completed in July 2017, entering service within the same week. The refurbished trains include new seats throughout the train (including leather in First Class), standard plug and USB sockets at every pair of seats, new decor, refitted toilets, and LED lighting throughout. The refurbishment was completed in 2018.

==Fleet details==
===Andy&#x27;s Man Club Livery===
As part of a collaboration between TransPennine Express and Andy&#x27;s Man Club - a mental health charity for men&#x27;s mental health, unit 185111 received a new livery at the cab ends of the train. The design features a black background, the &quot;ok&quot; hand gesture, as well as a white bolt of lightning, followed by quotes surrounding the charity.

===Named units===
Unit 185113 is named &quot;Hull Paragon 175&quot;

<text>State Route 52 (SR 52) is a state highway in San Diego County, California, that extends from La Jolla Parkway at Interstate 5 (I-5) in La Jolla, San Diego, to SR 67 in Santee. It is a freeway for its entire length and serves as a major east–west route through the northern part of the city of San Diego. The road connects the major north–south freeways of the county, including I-5, I-805, SR 163, I-15, SR 125, and SR 67. SR 52 passes north of the Rose Canyon Fault before traversing Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (MCAS Miramar). East of Santo Road and west of SR 125, the highway goes through Mission Trails Regional Park, a large open preserve. SR 52 is also known as the Soledad Freeway and the San Clemente Canyon Freeway.

Plans for a route between La Jolla and Santee date from 1959, and SR 52 was officially designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Construction began in 1966 at the I-5 interchange with Ardath Road leading to La Jolla. It continued with the construction of San Clemente Canyon Road, which was later widened to become SR 52. The freeway was completed east to I-805 in 1970, and was built in two stages from there to Santo Road east of I-15; the last phase was completed in 1988.

The freeway east of Santo Road encountered delays from environmentalists over the endangered least Bell&#x27;s vireo, a songbird which faced habitat destruction, as well as those concerned with the destruction of homes and businesses for the freeway right-of-way. The extension to Mission Gorge Road opened in 1993, and SR 52 was completed to SR 125 in 1998. Funding issues delayed the completion of the entire route until 2011, more than fifty years after construction began; until then, the city of Santee faced traffic snarls. A widening project was completed in 2007 between Santo Road and Mast Boulevard; further expansion has been put on hold due to state budget concerns.

==Route description==

SR 52 begins just west of I-5 at the eastern end of La Jolla Parkway. Before entering San Clemente Canyon, part of Marian Bear Natural Park, the road becomes a freeway as it intersects I-5. The freeway runs north of the Rose Canyon Fault, composed of Late Cretaceous rock estimated to be 90 million years old, and Mount Soledad. Following exits with Clairemont Mesa Boulevard / Regents Road and Genesee Avenue, SR 52 intersects I-805 before exiting the canyon and traveling along the southern edge of the MCAS Miramar military base.

From I-805 to SR 163, the highway goes through an area with visible Pliocene sedimentary rocks estimated to be 10 million years old. After passing the Miramar Recycling Center and an interchange with Convoy Street, SR 52 intersects SR 163, a freeway heading towards downtown San Diego. SR 52 intersects Kearny Villa Road before an interchange with I-15. A collector/distributor road serves these three interchanges.

After this interchange, the freeway leaves the edge of the military base and enters the San Diego neighborhood of Tierrasanta, where there is a junction with Santo Road, before traversing Mission Trails Regional Park, an open space preserve, for a few miles. The freeway ascends to Mission Trails Pass, north of the summit of Fortuna Mountain. The mountain is part of the Peninsular Range; the highway cuts through Eocene rocks estimated to be 50 million years old and marine fossils. The road on the eastern side of the mountain is carved out of &quot;igneous granitic rocks&quot; that are thought to be 150 million years old, an unusual formation compared to the Eocene layer.

A dedicated two-way bicycle path exists on the northern side of the roadway between Santo Road and Mast Boulevard, with access possible from both termini. East of the Mast Boulevard interchange, SR 52 crosses and begins to parallel the San Diego River. The freeway enters the city of Santee, where SR 52 was built alongside Mission Gorge Road. SR 52 intersects the northern end of SR 125, where SR 52 traffic can exit south onto SR 125. The freeway continues east through Santee, with interchanges at Fanita Drive, Cuyamaca Street, and Magnolia Avenue, before it comes to an end at SR 67.

SR 52 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System. In 2016, Caltrans officially designated the segment adjacent to Mission Trails Regional Park between Santo Road and Mast Boulevard as a scenic highway. SR 52 is also part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The entire route is known as both the Soledad Freeway and the San Clemente Canyon Freeway. In 2013, SR 52 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 69,000 at the eastern terminus with SR 67, and 103,000 between Convoy Street and SR 163, the lowest and the highest AADT for the highway, respectively.

==History==

In 1959, Legislative Route 279 was designated as a highway from La Jolla to Santee and incorporated into the California Freeway and Expressway System. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, this became SR 52. However, SR 52 took more than fifty years to be constructed, due to delays in the planning and construction phases.

===I-5 to I-805===
A public hearing on Legislative Route 279 and on the Ardath Road connection to La Jolla was held on November 15, 1961. At the hearing, there were concerns expressed regarding destruction of vegetation. City and state officials indicated that the Soledad Freeway would be constructed in the northern part of the canyon to minimize environmental damage. On November 9, 1966, the I-5 interchange with Ardath Road opened at the western end of what would become SR 52. The original goal was to connect the interchange with San Clemente Canyon Road, which served as a predecessor to SR 52; plans were to widen the road to four lanes and designate it as SR 52. The connecting ramps were not opened that day because the aluminum guard rails had not been delivered on time. Estimates indicated that each resident of La Jolla would save 80 hours per year by using Ardath Road. A ramp from southbound I-5 to westbound Ardath Road was never completed because of a hairpin turn that would be necessary due to the towering cliff on the west side of I-5 that Ardath Road ascends as it continues to La Jolla. On November 18, San Clemente Canyon Road was connected to I-5 when the aluminum guard rails arrived and were subsequently installed. San Clemente Canyon Road was not fully opened until 1967. That year, citizens expressed opposition to the construction of the Soledad Freeway because some wanted the land to be used for a park, and did not view the freeway as &quot;necessary.&quot;

Formal bids began in February 1969 for the first section of SR 52 between I-5 and I-805. The state ordered the construction of this section on April 28, 1969. On Thursday, May 28, 1970, the Soledad Freeway opened, connecting Regents Road and Genesee Avenue with I-5; however, it did not connect to the unopened I-805. The road was built by Kasler, Ball and Yeager for $3.9 million (about $ in dollars). The construction firm deposited dirt into &quot;an unnamed finger canyon&quot; against the conditions of the city permit, and the city ordered the firm to remove it. The section of I-805 from SR 52 to El Cajon Boulevard was scheduled to be dedicated on March 20, 1972.

Ardath Road was renamed La Jolla Parkway on October 15, 2002, for two reasons: a nearby residential street was also named Ardath Road, and there was a desire to draw attention to this primary route to downtown La Jolla. This required the city of San Diego to pay $20,000 (about $ in dollars) to replace the signs on SR 52.

===I-805 to Santo Road===
The second phase of SR 52 from I-805 to past U.S. Route 395 (which became I-15 in 1974) was projected to cost $29.4 million (about $ in dollars). The new freeway was to provide access to Tierrasanta and reduce the traffic on I-8. The U.S. Navy was consulted in the planning process due to the road&#x27;s proposed routing through what was then NAS Miramar that would provide a delineation against further urban development. There were no concerns expressed at the public hearing on November 17, 1970; however, construction did not begin for more than ten years, as California governor Jerry Brown stalled the construction of SR 52 from Santo Road to SR 67. In 1977, the county supervisor, a San Diego City councilman, and the mayors of La Mesa and National City wrote a letter to Brown to ask for the construction of this portion of SR 125 and other freeways, due to concerns about the types of congestion seen in Los Angeles coming to San Diego due to the incomplete freeway system. San Diego City Councilman Tom Gade wrote a telegram to Caltrans Director Adriana Gianturco about the possible deletions; in response, Gianturco clarified that the plans were only being reconsidered and had not been removed, and a CHC member criticized the tone of the original telegram, calling it &quot;intemperate&quot;. In 1984, Leo Trombatore, the Caltrans Director under California governor George Deukmejian, requested to the California Transportation Commission (CTC) that &quot;formal studies toward this end be initiated immediately. Route 52 has a high statewide priority.&quot; The CTC followed the director&#x27;s wishes, approving the studies.

The first part of this phase, from I-805 to Convoy Street, began construction in December 1986. It was dedicated at a community celebration on July 11, 1987, and was scheduled to open to traffic a few weeks later. The first callboxes in San Diego County were installed on SR 52 near Convoy Street on June 20, 1988. On June 30, 1988, SR 52 from Convoy Street to Santo Road opened to traffic. The I-15 interchange was built with state funds from the CTC.

In 2000, Hazard Construction Company added a single westbound lane on SR 52 from SR 163 to I-805, a distance of , at a cost of $1.7 million (about $ in dollars). In 2006, the Metropolitan Transit System, in cooperation with the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), Caltrans, and the California Highway Patrol, began a pilot program to run transit buses along the shoulders of SR 52 between Kearny Villa Road and I-805. During rush hour, buses were able to use these shoulders to bypass slow traffic in the main lanes. The trial was considered successful as more than 99 percent of trips arrived on time, customer feedback was favorable and no safety concerns were encountered. On May 9, 2007, &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; published a story which raised reader concerns about a dangerous dip in the freeway. The dip had developed in a section of the highway constructed on top of the Miramar Landfill, and had been caused by trash settling; it was repaired by the next day.

===Planning for eastern portion===
The planning process for the remainder of SR 52 began as early as 1970, when the initial plan was to route the freeway through the city of Santee along Mission Gorge Road and the San Diego River. Planning was delayed until 1984, along with the construction of the I-805 to Santo Road segment. The City of Santee opposed the original plans, hoping to route the freeway on Prospect Avenue or north of the San Diego River. By April 1985, a second route along Prospect Avenue, proposed by Caltrans, earned the support of the City Council; however, the required demolition of many small businesses led many of those affected to start a petition against this route. On the other hand, there were objections about the &quot;river route&quot; costing approximately $15 million more (about $ in dollars) and cutting through a future &quot;Town Center development&quot;. The Lakeside Chamber of Commerce preferred the route along the San Diego River, citing the proximity to that city. The environmental impact report was found to be deficient by the Federal Highway Administration in late 1986.

In January 1987, the Santee City Council voted to commence a study of a more northern route, even though local residents and workers objected that this would postpone construction. In March, the study, done by BSI Inc., supported the Caltrans decision to abandon plans for the northern path due to the increased cost from the &quot;mountainous, undeveloped&quot; terrain. The council voted to support a southern alignment through the town, with both the Prospect Avenue and San Diego River alternatives still viable. In the same month, the mayor of La Mesa, Fred Nagel, started a petition drive supporting the extension of the freeway due to the recurring traffic on I-8. The Caltrans environmental impact report indicated that the Prospect Avenue route would cost $89 million (about $ in dollars), compared to the river route&#x27;s $121 million (about $ in dollars). The city council of El Cajon publicly supported the Prospect Avenue routing; however, some employees of the City of Santee, including some city planners and engineers, were concerned that portions of the report were &quot;outdated.&quot; The petitions were given to the CTC in May, when San Diego officials made several arguments in support of the construction.

In June 1987, the CTC staff initially recommended against allocating money for the SR 52 segment; however, SANDAG agreed to fund the project with $1 million (about $ in dollars). Residents of Santee opposed the possible routes through the city at a public forum on June 10 because of the necessary destruction of homes to build on those routes. In late June, Caltrans considered making small modifications to the Prospect Avenue alignment to destroy fewer homes, including those in mobile home parks. On June 25, 1987, the CTC voted to support the SR 52 extension, with the requirement that $4.8 million (about $ in dollars) come from local funding sources. Finally, on September 23, the City of Santee recommended the Prospect Avenue Route to the CTC.
In July 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service expressed concerns that construction near the San Diego River crossing might result in the destruction of the endangered least Bell&#x27;s vireo habitat. Two of the four alternative routes considered by Caltrans passed through the Carlton Hills golf course, which the public opposed. In April 1988, the Sierra Club denounced the Prospect Avenue route; federal negotiators recommended shifting the route from Hollins Lake towards the golf course. Environmental concerns raised in June 1988 related to the least Bell&#x27;s vireo included decrease of insects, a darker environment after overpasses are constructed, and the fragmenting of habitat. Nevertheless, Caltrans still desired the Prospect Avenue route over concerns of a more expensive and less traveled northern route. Upset because of the delays, the Santee City Council wrote to U.S. senators Pete Wilson and Alan Cranston, asking for their assistance. Councilman Jim Bartell alleged that the issue would affect the city council elections.

In March 1989, the Fish and Wildlife Service agreed to the project, on the conditions of altering the route to cross the San Diego River and pass east of the center of the town, and constructing 44 acres of additional habitat as mitigation. SANDAG voted against building a full bicycle lane along the route in July 1989, citing the high costs. Finally, on July 27, the final routing of SR 52 was determined, running along Prospect Avenue. In May 1990, Santee councilman Roy Woodward was censured for having a conflict of interest in voting to support the proposals for the freeway because he &quot;held interests&quot; in three properties that would benefit from the freeway, thus violating the Political Reform Act as these interests exceeded $10,000. One of the holdings was near Cuyamaca Street, the location of an offramp on a path that he voted to support. He was fined $2,000 (about $ in dollars) for each property, for a total of $6,000 (about $ in dollars).

===Santo Road to Mission Gorge Road===
In April 1990, the Santee City Council agreed to begin purchasing land, over the environmental concerns of Councilman Jim Bartell. Construction finally began on the four-lane section of SR 52 between Santo Road and Mission Gorge Road on July 19, 1991. The work was projected to cost $52 million (about $ in dollars). For environmental mitigation, a new songbird habitat was constructed that cost $8.3 million (about $ in dollars). Fossils of &quot;small foraging mammals&quot; were discovered during construction in late 1991. The construction company, HDB Construction, was required to keep noise below 61 decibels to protect the birds. The project was funded primarily with revenue from a voter-approved sales tax in 1987. The opening of this portion was scheduled for December 16, 1993. This new segment ended just southeast of the Mast Boulevard interchange, after the San Diego River overpass.

The opening of this stretch of SR 52 had many effects on the transportation of the East County region. Traffic decreased significantly on I-8 in early 1994, with an estimated 30,000 commuters switching from I-8 to SR 52. Fewer cars traveled on the western part of Mission Gorge Road, leading to a decrease in revenue for businesses located along that road. On Mast Boulevard and Mission Gorge Road in Santee, much more traffic was present, leading to residents complaining to the city. In 1998, the city began to widen Mission Gorge Road between Carlton Hills Drive and Fanita Road to handle the extra traffic from the incomplete SR 52.

The year after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the military erected a fence to block a deer tunnel underneath the freeway that connected the base and Mission Trails Regional Park, since the tunnel could be used to gain unauthorized access to the base. In 2006, construction began to add a third lane on westbound SR 52 between Mast Boulevard and Santo Road. The expansion cost $3.4 million (about $ in dollars) and was funded by the state and the county TransNet sales tax. The new lane opened on May 8, 2007; however, the widening generated complaints from angry commuters facing a &quot;bottleneck&quot; at Santo Road. Because the additional lane was constructed in portions, the opening of the third lane between Santo Road and the existing third lane closer to I-15 was delayed; however, construction for the missing was approved in April 2007. The extension opened on July 20, 2007.

===Mission Gorge Road to SR 67===

Construction on the next portion of SR 52, from Mission Gorge Road to SR 125, was scheduled to begin in late 1995, at a total cost of $60 million (about $ in dollars) for the entire project. Property acquisition began in 1994, with many property owners along the south side of Mission Gorge Road being forced to move out of the way of the freeway and subsequent road construction, as Mission Gorge Road was moved south to accommodate the new freeway. About $40 million ($ in dollars) was spent on the property acquisition. After weather-related construction delays due to the El Niño season of the winter of 1997–1998, the extension of SR 52 between Mission Gorge Road and SR 125 was dedicated on May 9, 1998. The eastbound lanes were scheduled to be opened a few days later, and the westbound lanes were to be opened in mid-July of that year. L.R. Hubbard Construction Company built the portion for $17 million (about $ in dollars).

The City of Santee faced problems in the construction of the freeway from SR 125 to SR 67. As early as 1995, it was clear that the environmental impact report was delayed and that there would be funding difficulties. SANDAG allocated $23 million dollars (about $ in dollars) in 1999 to purchase properties needed for the right-of-way. In 2001, SANDAG gave $138 million (about $ in dollars) to the expansion of SR 52 to SR 67, which was necessary for extending the freeway past Cuyamaca Street. But by 2003, the transportation committee of SANDAG voted to delay the project due to decreased state funding. The City of Santee was required to make improvements to Forester Creek to accommodate potential flooding, which cost $30 million (about $ in dollars); the work began in May 2006. Funding issues were finally resolved in 2006 with voter-approved statewide transportation bonds. In 2007, highway construction costs increased; that year, the SANDAG transportation committee voted to fund the construction, taking money from a planned reversible lanes project on SR 52.

&quot;Heavy construction&quot; of SR 52 from SR 125 eastward to SR 67 began in February 2008. More than 360 properties were acquired to build the freeway; at least 60 were mobile homes. This portion was divided into three construction projects: from SR 125 to Cuyamaca Street, from there to Magnolia Avenue, and the interchange with SR 67, which began construction in mid-June 2008. The middle project had to be shut down briefly in February 2009 due to funding issues. Completion was scheduled for 2010, but was postponed to early 2011 due to weather-related delays. This new portion was opened to traffic on March 29, 2011. The cost of this project was $525 million, funded with state and federal funds as well as TransNet revenue. The opening was predicted to reduce traffic on I-8 as well as Mission Gorge Road and other Santee thoroughfares. The official &quot;ribbon cutting&quot; ceremony took place on March 19, 2011 on the freeway at the Cuyamaca Street interchange.

Reactions to the extension between SR 125 and SR 67 were mixed. There were reports of faster transportation through the East County area, yet commuters noted a rush hour backup at SR 125 headed westbound because there were only two lanes traveling west through the interchange. Traffic along Mission Gorge Road was reported to have decreased by 20 percent.

==Future==
There are plans to add one lane in each direction, as well as two reversible lanes, from I-15 to SR 125. These plans were put on hold in 2008 due to a budget shortfall. Completion is scheduled to take place by 2040. Caltrans recommends adding two more lanes between I-5 and I-805, and two HOV lanes between I-805 and I-15.

<text>Isaac Beeckman (10 December 1588 – 19 May 1637) was a Dutch philosopher and scientist, who, through his studies and contact with leading natural philosophers, may have &quot;virtually given birth to modern atomism&quot;.

==Biography==
Beeckman was born in Middelburg, Zeeland, to a strongly Calvinistic family, which had fled from the Spanish-controlled Southern Netherlands a few years before. He had a strong early education in his home town and went on to study theology, literature and mathematics in Leiden. Upon his return to Middelburg he could not find a position as a minister, due to clashing ideas of his father and the local church, and decided to follow his father in the candle-making business, setting up his own company in Zierikzee. While trying to improve on the candle-making process, he also involved himself in other projects, like creating water conduits and doing meteorological observations. In 1616 he sold the business to his apprentice and went to study medicine in Caen, where he graduated in 1618. On his return, he became an assistant rector in Utrecht. On April 1620 he married Cateline de Cerf, whom he knew from Middelburg, and with whom he would have seven children. From 1620 to 1627 he taught at the Latin school in Rotterdam, where he founded a &quot;Collegium Mechanicum&quot;, or Technical College. From 1627 until his death at the age of 48 he was rector of the Latin school in Dordrecht.

==Teachers, pupils, and Descartes==
Beeckman&#x27;s most influential teachers in Leiden probably were Rudolph Snellius and Simon Stevin. He himself was a teacher to Johan de Witt and a teacher and friend of René Descartes. Beeckman had met the young Descartes in November 1618 in Breda, where Beeckman then lived and Descartes was then garrisoned as a soldier. It is said that they met when both were looking at a placard that was set up in the Breda marketplace, detailing a mathematical problem to be solved. Descartes asked Beeckman to translate the problem from Dutch to French. In their following meetings Beeckman interested Descartes in his corpuscularian approach to mechanical theory, and convinced him to devote his studies to a mathematical approach to nature. In 1619, Descartes dedicated one of his first &quot;tractati&quot; to him, the &quot;Compendium Musicae&quot;. When Descartes returned to the Dutch Republic in the autumn of 1628, Beeckman also introduced him to many of Galileo&#x27;s ideas. In 1629 they fell out over a dispute concerning whether Beeckman had helped Descartes with some of his mathematical discoveries. In October 1630, Descartes wrote a long and harshly abusive letter, apparently meant to crush Beeckman psychologically, in which he declared himself never to have been influenced by Beeckman. However, and despite a few other such fallings-out, they remained in contact until Beeckman&#x27;s death in 1637.

==Work and legacy==
Beeckman did not publish his ideas, but he had influenced many scientists of his time. Since the beginning of his studies he did keep an extensive journal (&quot;Journaal&quot; in Dutch), from which his brother published posthumous some of his observations in 1644 the treatise &quot;Mathematico-physicarum meditationum, quaestionum, solutionum centuria&quot;. However, this went basically unnoticed.

The scope of Beeckman&#x27;s ideas did not come to light until the science historian Cornelis de Waard rediscovered the &quot;Journaal&quot; in 1905, and published it in volumes between 1939 and 1953.

* Rejecting Aristotle, Beeckman developed, independent of Sebastian Basso, the concept that matter is composed of &quot;atoms&quot;.
* Beeckman is mentioned to be one of the first persons describing inertia correctly, however he also assumes that a constant circular velocity is conserved.

* Beeckman had shown that the fundamental frequency of a vibrating string is proportional to the reciprocal of the length of the string.
* In the analysis of the functioning of a pump he theorized correctly that air pressure is the cause and not the then popular theory of horror vacui.

In his time, he was considered to be one of the most educated men in Europe. For example, he had deeply impressed Mersenne, despite their opposing religious views, as well as Pierre Gassendi, who apparently had been turned by Beeckman to the philosophy of Epicurus (atomism). Gassendi even proclaimed, in a 1629 letter to Peiresc, that Beeckman was the greatest philosopher he had ever met.

<text>Mount Royal University (MRU) is a public university in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

==History==
Mount Royal University was founded on December 16, 1910, by Alberta provincial charter under the Arthur Sifton government and officially opened on September 8, 1911. Originally &quot;Mount Royal College&quot;, the institution was the brainchild of Calgary Reverend George W. Kerby (1860-1944) who sought an opportunity for higher education to benefit young people from rural homes in the area. The provincial charter as presented in the legislature by R. B. Bennett was titled &quot;Bill 48, &quot;An Act respecting the Calgary College&quot;&quot;. However, Premier Sifton, Kerby, and others agreed not to use Calgary for the name of the new college.

In 1931, Mount Royal became a post-secondary institution as Mount Royal Junior College (MRC), offering transfer courses to the University of Alberta and later to the University of Calgary. In 1972, Mount Royal moved from several buildings in downtown Calgary to a new campus in Lincoln Park on land previously used as an air force base. A war memorial honour roll is dedicated to Mount Royal alumni who have volunteered for active service in the Canadian Forces.

In 2009, Mount Royal College became Mount Royal University when the provincial government granted it university status. The university currently offers 12 degrees and 32 majors with an average class size of 29 students.

In 2017, Mount Royal University was awarded the Ashoka Changemaker Campus designation joining 44 universities which are leading higher education in the area of social innovation and changemaking.

===Performing Arts Centre===

In July 2015, the $69.69 million Taylor Centre for the Performing Arts (TCPA) officially opened, accommodating the growing Mount Royal Conservatory, which is a musical conservatoire in operation since 1910 that serves up to 10,000 Calgarians annually. The TCPA houses 43 soundproof rehearsal studios, six ensemble suites, and the 787-seat Bella Concert Hall (opened August 26, 2015) designed by Pfeiffer Partners Architects in cooperation with Sahuri + Partners, who used a &quot;contemporary interpretation of the rural barn on the expansive prairie of Alberta&quot; in their design. The Taylor Centre for the Performing Arts is named after the family name of businessman, philanthropist, and Calgarian Don Taylor who donated $21-million to the project. Additionally, the namesake of the Bella Concert Hall is Mary Belle Taylor, Don Taylor&#x27;s mother, who was affectionately known as &#x27;Bella.&#x27; In addition to its design, the Taylor Centre for the Performing Arts is notable for being a LEED Gold certified building and for being highly accessible for users with diverse physical abilities. While built with the needs of the Mount Royal Conservatory in mind, the TCPA and its various spaces are considered a community resource.

===Library===

Mount Royal University officially opened the Riddell Library and Learning Centre on September 7, 2017, replacing the previous library, which opened in 1972. The Riddell Library is named after Calgary businessman Clay Riddell who contributed a sizeable donation to the project. The $100 million facility features more than 16,000-square-metres of space, 34 study rooms, 1,700 seats, access to 3D printing, and even a cafe.

==Athletics==
The Mount Royal University athletic nickname is the Cougars. The Cougars transitioned to Canada&#x27;s top level of amateur athletics for the 2012–13 season, moving to the Canadian Interuniversity Sport Canada West conference (since re-named U Sports). The university supports eight teams competing in men’s and women’s basketball, hockey, soccer and volleyball.

<text>Epiphany ( ), also known as &quot;Theophany&quot; in Eastern Christian tradition, is a Christian feast day commemorating the visit of the Magi, the baptism of Jesus, and the wedding at Cana.

In Western Christianity, the feast commemorates principally (but not solely) the visit of the Magi to the Christ Child, and thus Jesus Christ&#x27;s physical manifestation to the Gentiles. It is sometimes called Three Kings&#x27; Day, and in some traditions celebrated as Little Christmas. Moreover, the feast of the Epiphany, in some denominations, also initiates the liturgical season of Epiphanytide.

Eastern Christians, on the other hand, commemorate the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan, seen as his manifestation to the world as the Son of God, and celebrate it as the Feast of the Epiphany or of the Theophany. The traditional site of the ministry of John the Baptist is in Al-Maghtas in Jordan, with the baptism of Jesus once marked in Byzantine times by a cross in the middle of the Jordan River, between the Jordanian site and Qasr al-Yahud in the West Bank.

The traditional date for the feast is January 6. However, since 1970 the celebration has been held in some countries on the Sunday after January 1. Those Eastern Churches that are still following the Julian calendar observe the feast on what, according to the internationally used Gregorian calendar, is 19 January, because of the current 13-day difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars. The Alawites and the Middle Eastern Christians also observe the feast on January 19.

In many Western Churches, the eve of the feast is celebrated as Twelfth Night (Epiphany Eve) on January 5. The Monday after Epiphany is known as Plough Monday.

Popular Epiphany customs include Epiphany singing, chalking the door, having one&#x27;s house blessed, consuming Three Kings Cake, winter swimming, as well as attending church services. It is customary for Christians in many localities to remove their Christmas decorations on Epiphany Eve (Twelfth Night), although those in other Christian countries historically remove them on Candlemas, the conclusion of Epiphanytide. According to one seventeenth-century tradition, it is inauspicious to remove Christmas decorations before Epiphany Eve and those who do not remove them on that date have the opportunity to take them down on Candlemas.

==Etymology==
The word Epiphany is from Koine Greek ἐπιφάνεια, &quot;epipháneia&quot;, meaning manifestation or appearance. It is derived from the verb φαίνειν, &quot;phainein&quot;, meaning ‘to appear’. In classical Greek it was used for the appearance of dawn, of an enemy in war, but especially of a manifestation of a deity to a worshipper (a theophany). In the Septuagint the word is used of a manifestation of the God of Israel (). In the New Testament the word is used in to refer either to the birth of Christ or to his appearance after his resurrection, and five times to refer to his Second Coming.

Alternative names for the feast in Greek include τα Θεοφάνια, &quot;ta Theophánia&quot;, ‘Theophany’ (a neuter plural rather than feminine singular), η Ημέρα των Φώτων, &quot;i Iméra ton Fóton&quot; (modern Greek pronunciation), ‘The Day of the Lights’, and τα Φώτα, &quot;ta Fóta&quot;, ‘The Lights’.

In Egypt, it is called &quot;Eid al-Ghitas&quot; (Arabic: عيد الغِطاس).

==History==
=== Early history ===

Epiphany may have originated in the Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman Empire as a feast to honor the baptism of Jesus. Around 200, Clement of Alexandria wrote: The Egyptian dates given correspond to January 6 and 10. The Basilides were a Gnostic sect.

The reference to &quot;readings&quot; suggests that the Basilides were reading the Gospels. In ancient gospel manuscripts, the text is arranged to indicate passages for liturgical readings. If a congregation began reading Mark at the beginning of the year, it might arrive at the story of the Baptism on January 6, thus explaining the date of the feast. If Christians read Mark in the same format the Basilides did, the two groups could have arrived at the January 6 date independently.

The earliest reference to Epiphany as a Christian feast was in AD 361, by Ammianus Marcellinus. The holiday is listed twice, which suggests a double feast of baptism and birth. The baptism of Jesus was originally assigned to the same date as the birth because was read to mean that Jesus was exactly 30 when he was baptized; it is said by many Church Fathers that Jesus was the age of 30, although not necessarily exactly that age.

Epiphanius of Salamis says that January 6 is Christ&#x27;s &quot;Birthday; that is, His Epiphany&quot; (&quot;hemera genethlion toutestin epiphanion&quot;). He also asserts that the Miracle at Cana occurred on the same calendar day. Epiphanius assigns the Baptism to November 6.

The scope to Epiphany expanded to include the commemoration of his birth; the visit of the magi, all of Jesus&#x27; childhood events, up to and including the Baptism by John the Baptist; and even the miracle at the wedding at Cana in Galilee.

In the Latin-speaking West, the holiday emphasized the visit of the magi. The magi represented the non-Jewish peoples of the world, so this was considered a &quot;revelation to the gentiles&quot;. In this event, Christian writers also inferred a revelation to the Children of Israel. John Chrysostom identified the significance of the meeting between the magi and Herod&#x27;s court: 

Even before 354, the Western Church had separated the celebration of the Nativity of Christ as the feast of Christmas and set its date as December 25; it reserved January 6 as a commemoration of the manifestation of Christ, especially to the Magi, but also at his baptism and at the wedding feast of Cana.

In 385, the pilgrim Egeria (also known as Silvia) described a celebration in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, which she called &quot;Epiphany&quot; that commemorated the Nativity. Even at this early date, there was an octave associated with the feast. The Georgian Chantbook of Jerusalem compiled in the mid 6th century contains hymns for this feast that were likely written between the time of Egeria and the turn of the 6th century.

In a sermon delivered on December 25, 380, St. Gregory of Nazianzus referred to the day as &quot;the Theophany&quot; (&quot;ta theophania&quot;, formerly the name of a pagan festival at Delphi), saying expressly that it is a day commemorating &quot;the holy nativity of Christ&quot; and told his listeners that they would soon be celebrating the baptism of Christ. Then, on January 6 and 7, he preached two more sermons, in which he declared that the celebration of the birth of Christ and the visitation of the Magi had already taken place, and that they would now commemorate his Baptism. At this time, celebration of the two events was beginning to be observed on separate occasions, at least in Cappadocia.

Saint John Cassian says that even in his time (beginning of the 5th century), Egyptian monasteries celebrated the Nativity and the Baptism together on January 6. The Armenian Apostolic Church continues to celebrate January 6 as the only commemoration of the Nativity.

=== Modern period ===
In the Latin Church, from 1893 until 1955, Epiphany was celebrated as an eight-day feast, known as the Octave of Epiphany, beginning on January 6 and ending on January 13. The Sunday within that octave had been the feast of the Holy Family, and Christmastide was reckoned as the twelve days ending on January 5, followed by the January 6–13 octave. Before the 1969 revision of its liturgy, the Sundays following the Octave of Epiphany or, when this was abolished, following the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, which was instituted to take the place of the Octave Day of Epiphany were named as the &quot;Second (etc., up to Sixth) Sunday after Epiphany&quot;, as the at least 24 Sundays following Pentecost Sunday and Trinity Sunday were known as the &quot;Second (etc.) Sunday after Pentecost&quot;. (If a year had more than 24 Sundays after Pentecost, up to four unused post-Epiphany Sundays were inserted between the 23rd and the 24th Sunday after Pentecost.) The &quot;Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices&quot;, which has received the imprimatur of John Michael D&#x27;Arcy, with reference to Epiphanytide, thus states that &quot;The Epiphany season extends from January 6 to Septuagesima Sunday, and has from one to six Sundays, according to the date of Easter. White is the color for the octave; green is the liturgical color for the season.&quot;

In 1955, Pope Pius XII abolished all but three liturgical octaves, and the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar instituted the modern system, which made the date variable to some extent. It also made the Feast of the Epiphany part of Christmas Time, which it defined as extending from the First Vespers of Christmas (the evening of December 24) up to and including the Sunday after Epiphany (the Sunday after January 6). In 1955 a separate feast of the Baptism of the Lord was also instituted, thus weakening further the connection in the West between the feast of the Epiphany and the commemoration of the baptism of Christ. (However, Hungarians, in an apparent reference to baptism, refer to the January 6 celebration as &quot;Vízkereszt&quot;, a term that recalls the words &quot;víz&quot; (water) and &quot;kereszt, kereszt-ség&quot; (baptism).)

Prior to 1976, Anglican churches observed an eight-day octave, beginning on January 6.

==Epiphany by Christian tradition==

Epiphany is celebrated by both the Eastern and Western Churches, but a major difference between them is precisely which events the feast commemorates. For Western Christians, the feast primarily commemorates the coming of the Magi, with only a minor reference to the baptism of Jesus and the miracle at the Wedding at Cana. Eastern churches celebrate the Baptism of Christ in the Jordan. In both traditions, the essence of the feast is the same: the manifestation of Christ to the world (whether as an infant or in the Jordan), and the Mystery of the Incarnation. The miracle at the Wedding at Cana is also celebrated during Epiphany as a first manifestation of Christ&#x27;s public life.

In some Churches, the feast of the Epiphany initiates the Epiphany season, also known as Epiphanytide.

===Catholic Church===

In the Catholic Church, Epiphany is either observed on the traditional fixed date of January 6, or it is transferred to the Sunday between January 2 and January 8. Most dioceses in the United States observe the latter. In each system, the date of Epiphany affects the dates of other feasts:

* Where Epiphany is always celebrated on January 6, the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord is celebrated the following Sunday. During years where there are two Sundays between Christmas and Epiphany, the second is known as the &quot;Second Sunday after Christmas&quot;.
* Where Epiphany is on a moveable date and does not occur on January 6, it is moved earlier to replace the Second Sunday after Christmas in years where it would have occurred; otherwise it is moved later to the following Sunday, and displaces the Feast of the Baptism to the following Monday.

Currently, Epiphany is considered part of Christmas Time, which runs from First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of Christmas up to and including the Sunday after Epiphany, with Ordinary Time beginning on the following Monday. Some regions and especially some communities celebrating the Tridentine Mass extend the season to as many as forty days, ending Christmastide traditionally on Candlemas (February 2).

On the Feast of the Epiphany in some parts of central Europe the priest, wearing white vestments, blesses Epiphany water, frankincense, gold, and chalk. The chalk is used to write the initials of the three magi (traditionally, Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar), over the doors of churches and homes. The initials may also be interpreted as the Latin phrase, (may Christ bless the house).

According to ancient custom, the priest announced the date of Easter on the feast of Epiphany. This tradition dated from a time when calendars were not readily available, and the church needed to publicize the date of Easter, since many celebrations of the liturgical year depend on it. The proclamation may be sung or proclaimed at the &quot;ambo&quot; by a deacon, cantor, or reader either after the reading of the Gospel or after the postcommunion prayer.

The Roman Missal thus provides a formula with appropriate chant (in the tone of the &quot;Exsultet&quot;) for proclaiming on Epiphany, wherever it is customary to do so, the dates in the calendar for the celebration of Ash Wednesday, Easter Sunday, Ascension of Jesus Christ, Pentecost, the Body and Blood of Christ, and the First Sunday of Advent that will mark the following liturgical year.

=== Protestant churches ===
Lutheran, Anglican, Moravian, Methodist and United Protestant congregations, along with those of other denominations, may celebrate Epiphany on January 6, on the following Sunday within the Epiphany week (octave), or at another time (Epiphany Eve January 5, the nearest Sunday, etc.) as local custom dictates. Many in the West, such as adherents of the Anglican Communion, Lutheran Churches and Methodist Churches, observe a twelve-day festival, starting on December 25, and ending on January 5, known as Christmastide or The Twelve Days of Christmas, which the Epiphany season follows.

Today, &quot;The Epiphany of our Lord&quot;, classified as a Principal Feast, is observed in some Anglican provinces on January 6 exclusively (e.g., the Anglican Church of Canada) but in the Church of England the celebration is &quot;on 6 January or transferred to the Sunday falling between 2 and 8 January&quot;. In Advent 2000, the Church of England, Mother Church of the Anglican Communion, introduced into its liturgy an optional Epiphany season by approving the &quot;Common Worship&quot; series of services as an alternative to those in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, which remains the Church&#x27;s normative liturgy and in which no such liturgical season appears. An official publication of the Church of England states: &quot;The Christmas season is often celebrated for twelve days, ending with the Epiphany. Contemporary use has sought to express an alternative tradition, in which Christmas lasts for a full forty days, ending with the Feast of the Presentation on 2 February.&quot; It presents the latter part of this period as the Epiphany season, comprising the Sundays of Epiphany and ending &quot;only with the Feast of the Presentation (Candlemas)&quot;.

Another interpretation of &quot;Epiphany season&quot; applies the term to the period from Epiphany to the day before Ash Wednesday. Some Methodists in the United States and Singapore follow these liturgies. Lutherans celebrate the last Sunday before Ash Wednesday as the Transfiguration of our Lord, and it has been said that they call the whole period from Epiphany to then as Epiphany season. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America used the terms &quot;Time after Epiphany&quot; to refer to this period. The expression with &quot;after&quot; has been interpreted as making the period in question correspond to that of Ordinary Time.

The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) does not celebrate Epiphany or Pentecost as seasons; for this Church, expressions such as &quot;Fifth Sunday after Epiphany&quot; indicate the passing of time, rather than a liturgical season. It instead uses the term &quot;Ordinary Time&quot;.

Some Western Rite churches in the Protestant tradition, such as the Luthearn and Anglican churches, will follow practices similar to the Catholic Church. Church cantatas for the Feast of Epiphany were written by Protestant composers such as Georg Philipp Telemann, Christoph Graupner, Johann Sebastian Bach and Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel.

=== Eastern Orthodox churches ===


Eastern churches celebrate Epiphany (Theophany) on January 6. Some, as in Greece, employ the modern Revised Julian calendar, which until 2800 coincides with the Gregorian calendar, the one in use for civil purposes in most countries. Other Eastern churches, as in Russia, hold to the older Julian calendar for reckoning church dates. In these old-calendar churches Epiphany falls at present on Gregorian January 19 – which is January 6 in the Julian calendar.

The name of the feast as celebrated in the Orthodox churches may be rendered in English as the Theophany, as closer in form to the Greek (&quot;God shining forth&quot; or &quot;divine manifestation&quot;). Here it is one of the Great Feasts of the liturgical year, being third in rank, behind only Paskha (Easter) and Pentecost in importance. It is celebrated on January 6 of the calendar that a particular Church uses. On the Julian calendar, which some of the Orthodox churches follow, that date corresponds, during the present century, to January 19 on the Gregorian or Revised Julian calendar. The earliest reference to the feast in the Eastern Church is a remark by St. Clement of Alexandria in &quot;Stromateis&quot;, I, xxi, 45:

And there are those who have determined not only the year of our Lord&#x27;s birth, but also the day… And the followers of Basilides hold the day of his baptism as a festival, spending the night before in readings. And they say that it was the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar, the fifteenth day of the month of Tubi; and some that it was the eleventh of the same month.

(11 and 15 of Tubi are January 6 and 10, respectively.)

If this is a reference to a celebration of Christ&#x27;s birth, as well as of his baptism, on January 6, it corresponds to what continues to be the custom of the Armenian Apostolic Church, which celebrates the birth of Jesus on January 6 of the calendar used, calling the feast that of the Nativity and Theophany of Our Lord.

Origen&#x27;s list of festivals (in &quot;Contra Celsum&quot;, VIII, xxii) omits any reference to Epiphany. The first reference to an ecclesiastical feast of the Epiphany, in Ammianus Marcellinus (XXI:ii), is in 361.

In parts of the Eastern Church, January 6 continued for some time as a composite feast that included the Nativity of Jesus: though Constantinople adopted December 25 to commemorate Jesus&#x27; birth in the fourth century, in other parts the Nativity of Jesus continued to be celebrated on January 6, a date later devoted exclusively to commemorating his Baptism.

Today in Eastern Orthodox churches, the emphasis at this feast is on the shining forth and revelation of Jesus Christ as the Messiah and Second Person of the Trinity at the time of his baptism. It is also celebrated because, according to tradition, the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River by St. John the Baptist marked one of only two occasions when all three Persons of the Trinity manifested themselves simultaneously to humanity: God the Father by speaking through the clouds, God the Son being baptized in the river, and God the Holy Spirit in the shape of a dove descending from heaven (the other occasion was the Transfiguration on Mount Tabor). Thus the holy day is considered to be a Trinitarian feast.

The Orthodox consider Jesus&#x27; Baptism to be the first step towards the Crucifixion, and there are some parallels in the hymnography used on this day and the hymns chanted on Good Friday.

====Liturgical practice in Eastern churches====
Forefeast: The liturgical Forefeast of Theophany begins on January 2 and concludes with the Paramony on January 5.

Paramony: The Eve of the Feast is called &quot;Paramony&quot; (Greek: , Slavonic: &quot;navechérie&quot;). Paramony is observed as a strict fast day, on which those faithful who are physically able, refrain from food until the first star is observed in the evening, when a meal with wine and oil may be taken. On this day the Royal Hours are celebrated, thus tying together this feast with Nativity and Good Friday. The Royal Hours are followed by the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil which combines Vespers with the Divine Liturgy. During the Vespers, fifteen Old Testament lections which foreshadow the Baptism of Christ are read, and special antiphons are chanted. If the Feast of the Theophany falls on a Sunday or Monday, the Royal Hours are chanted on the previous Friday, and on the Paramony the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom is celebrated in the morning. The fasting is lessened to some degree in this case.

Blessing of Waters: The Orthodox Churches perform the Great Blessing of Waters on Theophany. The blessing is normally done twice: once on the Eve of the Feast – usually at a Baptismal font inside the church – and then again on the day of the feast, outdoors at a body of water. Following the Divine Liturgy, the clergy and people go in a Crucession (procession with the cross) to the nearest body of water, be it a beach, harbor, quay, river, lake, swimming pool, water depot, etc. (ideally, it should be a body of &quot;living water&quot;). At the end of the ceremony the priest will bless the waters. In the Greek practice, he does this by casting a cross into the water. If swimming is feasible on the spot, any number of volunteers may try to recover the cross. The person who gets the cross first swims back and returns it to the priest, who then delivers a special blessing to the swimmer and their household. Certain such ceremonies have achieved particular prominence, such as the one held annually at Tarpon Springs, Florida. In Russia, where the winters are severe, a hole will be cut into the ice so that the waters may be blessed. In such conditions, the cross is not cast into the water, but is held securely by the priest and dipped three times into the water.

The water that is blessed on this day is sometimes known as &quot;Theophany Water&quot;, though usually just &quot;holy water&quot;, and is taken home by the faithful, and used with prayer as a blessing. People will not only bless themselves and their homes by sprinkling with holy water, but will also drink it. The Orthodox Church teaches that holy water differs from ordinary water by virtue of the incorruptibility bestowed upon it by a blessing that transforms its very nature. a miracle attested to as early as St. John Chrysostom.

Theophany is a traditional day for performing Baptisms, and this is reflected in the Divine Liturgy by singing the baptismal hymn, &quot;As many as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. Alleluia,&quot; in place of the Trisagion.

House Blessings: On Theophany the priest will begin making the round of the parishioner&#x27;s homes to bless them. He will perform a short prayer service in each home, and then go through the entire house, gardens and outside-buildings, blessing them with the newly blessed Theophany Water, while all sing the Troparion and Kontakion of the feast. This is normally done on Theophany, or at least during the Afterfeast, but if the parishioners are numerous, and especially if many live far away from the church, it may take some time to bless each house. Traditionally, these blessings should all be finished before the beginning of Great Lent.

Afterfeast: The Feast of Theophany is followed by an eight-day Afterfeast on which the normal fasting laws are suspended. The Saturday and Sunday after Theophany have special readings assigned to them, which relate to the Temptation of Christ and to penance and perseverance in the Christian struggle. There is thus a liturgical continuum between the Feast of Theophany and the beginning of Great Lent.

===Oriental Orthodox===
In the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the feast is known as &quot;Timkat&quot; and is celebrated on the day that the Gregorian calendar calls January 19, but on January 20 in years when Enkutatash in the Ethiopian calendar falls on Gregorian September 12 (i.e. when the following February in the Gregorian calendar will have 29 days). The celebration of this feast features blessing of water and solemn processions with the sacred tabot. A priest carries this to a body of water where it stays overnight, with the Metsehafe Qeddassie celebrated in the early morning. Later in the morning, the water is blessed to the accompaniment of the reading of the four Gospel accounts of the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan and the people are sprinkled with or go into the water. The tabot returns in procession to the church.

Among the Syriac Christians the feast is called &quot;denho&quot; (up-going), a name to be connected with the notion of rising light expressed in . In the East Syriac rite, the season of Epiphany (Epiphanytide) is known as &quot;Denha&quot;.

In the Armenian Apostolic Church, January 6 is celebrated as the Nativity (&quot;&quot;) and Theophany of Christ. The feast is preceded by a seven-day fast. On the eve of the feast, the Divine Liturgy is celebrated. This liturgy is referred to as the &quot; &quot; (the Eucharist of the lighting of the lamps) in honor of the manifestation of Jesus as the Son of God. Both the Armenian Apostolic Church&#x27;s and Assyrian Church of the East&#x27;s liturgy is followed by a blessing of water, during which the cross is immersed in the water, symbolizing Jesus&#x27; descent into the Jordan, and holy &quot;myron&quot; (chrism) is poured in, symbolic of the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus. The next morning, after the Liturgy, the cross is removed from the vessel of holy water and all come forward to kiss the cross and partake of the blessed water.

The Indian Orthodox Church celebrates the feast of Epiphany, &quot;Denaha&quot; [Syriac term which means rising] on January 6, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church celebrates on January 19 as the Timkath festival, which was included in the UNESCO heritage list of festivals.

==Music ==
===Classical===
Johann Sebastian Bach composed in Leipzig two cantatas for the feast which concluded Christmastide:

* &quot;Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen&quot;, BWV 65, (1724)
* &quot;Liebster Immanuel, Herzog der Frommen&quot;, BWV 123, (1725)

Part VI of his Christmas Oratorio, &quot;Herr, wenn die stolzen Feinde schnauben&quot;, was also designated to be performed during the service for Epiphany.

The first three movements of Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Christus&quot; are sometimes sung at Epiphany as they make reference to the Magi and the Star of Bethlehem.

In Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s symphonic tone poem &quot;Roman Festivals&quot;, the final movement is subtitled &quot;Bofana&quot; and takes place during Epiphany.

===Carols and hymns===
&quot;Nun liebe Seel, nun ist es Zeit&quot; is a German Epiphany hymn by Georg Weissel, first printed in 1642.

Two very familiar Christmas carols are associated with the Epiphany holiday: &quot;As with gladness, men of old&quot;, written by William Chatterton Dix in 1860 as a response to the many legends which had grown up surrounding the Magi; and &quot;We Three Kings of Orient Are&quot;, written by the Reverend John Henry Hopkins Jr. – then an ordained deacon in the Episcopal Church – who was instrumental in organizing an elaborate holiday pageant (which featured this hymn) for the students of the General Theological Seminary in New York City in 1857 while serving as the seminary&#x27;s music director.

Another popular hymn, less known culturally as a carol, is &quot;Songs of thankfulness and praise&quot;, with words written by Christopher Wordsworth and commonly sung to the tune &quot;St. Edmund&quot; by Charles Steggall.

A carol used as an anthem for the Epiphany holiday is &quot;The Three Kings&quot;.

==National and local customs==
Epiphany is celebrated with a wide array of customs around the world. In some cultures, the greenery and nativity scenes put up at Christmas are taken down at Epiphany. In other cultures these remain up until Candlemas on February 2. In countries historically shaped by Western Christianity (Roman Catholicism, Protestantism) these customs often involve gift giving, &quot;king cakes&quot; and a celebratory close to the Christmas season. In traditionally Orthodox nations, water, baptismal rites and house blessings are typically central to these celebrations.

===Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay===
In Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, as in other Latin American countries, the day is called &quot;Día de Reyes&quot; (The Day of Kings, a reference to the Biblical Magi), commemorating the arrival of the Magi to revere Jesus as son of God. The night of January 5 into the morning of January 6 is known as &quot;Noche de Reyes&quot; (The Night of Kings) and children leave their shoes by the door, along with grass and water for the camels. On the morning of January 6, they get up early and rush to see their shoes, where they are expecting to find gifts left by the &quot;Reyes&quot; who, according to tradition, bypass the houses of children who are awake. On January 6, a &quot;Rosca de Reyes&quot; (a ring-shaped Epiphany cake) is eaten and all Christmas decorations are traditionally put away.

===Assyrians in Iraq and Syria===

Assyrian Christians in Iraq celebrate &quot;the feast of Epiphany&quot;, &quot;Etha de Denha&quot; (&quot;rising in Neo-Aramaic) on January 6, this holiday is celebrated by people of all ages splashing water at each other with buckets or hoses as a symbol of Jesus’s baptism.

===Bulgaria===
In Bulgaria, Epiphany is celebrated on January 6 and is known as &quot;Bogoyavlenie&quot; (&quot;Manifestation of God&quot;), &quot;Кръщение Господне&quot; (&quot;Krashtenie Gospodne&quot; or &quot;Baptism of the Lord&quot;) or &quot;Yordanovden&quot; (&quot;Day of Jordan&quot;, referring to the river). On this day, a wooden cross is thrown by a priest into the sea, river or lake and young men race to retrieve it. As the date is in early January and the waters are close to freezing, this is considered an honorable act and it is said that good health will be bestowed upon the home of the swimmer who is the first to reach the cross.

In the town of Kalofer, a traditional horo with drums and bagpipes is played in the icy waters of the Tundzha river before the throwing of the cross.

===Benelux===
Speakers of Dutch and Flemish call this day &quot;Driekoningen&quot; (Three kings), while German speakers call it &quot;&quot; (Three Kings&#x27; Day). In Belgium, Luxembourg, the southern parts of the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany, children in groups of three (symbolizing the Biblical Magi) proceed in costume from house to house while singing songs typical for the occasion, and receiving a coin or some sweets at each door. They may each carry a paper lantern symbolizing the star. In the Netherlands (provinces of Brabant and Limburg only), these troupes gather for competitions and present their skits/songs for an audience. As in Belgium, &quot;Koningentaart&quot; (Kings&#x27; tart), puff pastry with almond filling, is prepared with a black bean hidden inside. Whoever finds the bean in his or her piece is king or queen for the day. A more typically Dutch version is &quot;Koningenbrood&quot;, or Kings&#x27; bread. In the north of the Netherlands, the traditions have died out, except for a very few places. Another Low Countries tradition on Epiphany is to open up doors and windows to let good luck in for the coming year.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the day is called &quot;Dia dos Reis&quot; (The Day of Kings) and in the rest of Latin America &quot;Día de Reyes&quot; commemorating the arrival of the Magi to confirm Jesus as son of God. The night of January 5 into the morning of January 6 is known as &quot;Night of Kings&quot; (also called the Twelfth Night) and is feasted with music, sweets and regional dishes as the last night of Nativity, when Christmas decorations are traditionally put away.

===Chile===
This day is sometimes known as the &quot;Día de los Tres Reyes Magos&quot; (The day of the Three Royal Magi) or &quot;La Pascua de los Negros&quot; (Holy Day of the Black men) in Chile, although the latter is rarely heard, because it was the day when slaves were allowed not to work.

===Dominican Republic===
In the Dominican Republic, the &quot;Día de los Tres Reyes Magos&quot; (The day of the Three Royal Magi) and in this day children receive gifts on the christmas tree in a similar fashion to Christmas day. On this day public areas are very active with children accompanied by their parents trying out their new toys.

A common practice is to leave toys under the children&#x27;s beds on January 5, so when they wake up on January 6, they are made to believe the gifts and toys were left from Santa Claus or the Three Kings. However, and particularly in the larger cities and in the North, local traditions are now being observed and intertwined with the greater North American Santa Claus tradition, as well as with other holidays such as Halloween, due to Americanization via film and television, creating an economy of gifting tradition that spans from Christmas Day until January 6.

===Egypt===
The feast of the Epiphany, locally called Eid al-Ghitas (), is celebrated by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which falls on 11 Tobe of the Coptic calendar, as the moment when in the baptism of Jesus the skies opened and God himself revealed to all as father of Jesus and all mankind. It is then a moment of revelation of epiphany. This celebration started to include all the processes of incarnation of Jesus, from his birth on Christmas until his baptism in the river Jordan. For the Coptic Orthodox Church it is also a moment in which the path of Jesus to the Cross begins. Therefore, in many celebrations there are certain similarities with the celebrations of Holy Friday during the time of Easter. Since the Epiphany is one of the seven great feasts of the Coptic Orthodox Church, it is a day of strict fasting, and several religious celebrations are held on this day. The day is related to the blessing of waters that are used all throughout the year in the church celebrations, and it is a privileged day to celebrate baptisms. It is also a day in which many houses are blessed with water. It may take several days for the local priest to bless all the houses of the parishioners that ask for it, and so the blessing of the houses may go into the after-feasts of the Epiphany celebrations. However, it must be done before the beginning of Lent.

===England===
In England, the celebration of the night before Epiphany, Epiphany Eve, is known as Twelfth Night (the first night of Christmas is December 25–26, and Twelfth Night is January 5–6), and was a traditional time for mumming and the wassail. The Yule log was left burning until this day, and the charcoal left was kept until the next Christmas to kindle next year&#x27;s Yule log, as well as to protect the house from fire and lightning. In the past, Epiphany was also a day for playing practical jokes, similar to April Fool&#x27;s Day. Today in England, Twelfth Night is still as popular a day for plays as when Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; was first performed in 1601, and annual celebrations involving the Holly Man are held in London. A traditional dish for Epiphany was Twelfth Cake, a rich, dense, typically English fruitcake. As in Europe, whoever found the baked-in bean was king for a day, but uniquely to English tradition other items were sometimes included in the cake. Whoever found the clove was the villain; the twig, the fool; and the rag, the tart. Anything spicy or hot, like ginger snaps and spiced ale, was considered proper Twelfth Night fare, recalling the costly spices brought by the Wise Men. Another English Epiphany sweetmeat was the traditional jam tart, made appropriate to the occasion by being fashioned in the form of a six-pointed star symbolising the Star of Bethlehem, and thus called Epiphany tart. The discerning English cook sometimes tried to use thirteen different colored jams on the tart on this day for luck, creating a pastry resembling stained glass.

===Ethiopia and Eritrea===

In the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Church, the feast is known as &quot;Timkat&quot; and is celebrated on the day that the Gregorian calendar calls January 19, but on January 20 in years when New Year in the Ethiopian calendar falls on Gregorian September 12 (i.e. when the following February in the Gregorian calendar will have 29 days). The celebration of this feast features blessing of water and solemn processions with the sacred Tabot.

===Finland===
In Finland, Epiphany is called &quot;&quot;, a name which goes back to the 1600s. In the 1500s the Swedish-Finnish Lutheran church called Epiphany &quot;Day of the Holy Three Kings&quot;, while before this, the older term &quot;Epiphania&quot; was used. In the Karelian language Epiphany is called &quot;vieristä&quot;, meaning cross, from the Orthodox custom of submerging a cross three times to bless water on this day. Today, in the Lutheran church, Epiphany is a day dedicated to a focus on missionary work in addition to the Wise Men narrative. Between 1973 and 1991 Epiphany was observed in Finland on a Saturday each year no earlier than January 6, and no later than January 12. After that time however, the traditional date of January 6 was restored and has since been observed once again as a national public holiday.

The Christmas tree is traditionally taken out of the house on Epiphany. While the term &quot;&quot; means &quot;ending [of Christmas time],&quot; in reality, Christmas celebrations in Finland are extended to &quot;Nuutti&#x27;s&quot; or St. Canute&#x27;s Day on January 13, completing the Scandinavian Twenty Days of Christmas.

===Francophone Europe===
In France people share one of two types of king cake. In the northern half of France and Belgium the cake is called a &quot;galette des Rois,&quot; and is a round, flat, and golden cake made with flake pastry and often filled with frangipane, fruit, or chocolate. In the south, in Provence, and in the south-west, a crown-shaped cake or brioche filled with fruit called a &quot;gâteau des Rois&quot; is eaten. In Romandie, both types can be found though the latter is more common. Both types of cake contain a charm, usually a porcelain or plastic figurine, called a &quot;fève&quot; (&quot;broad bean&quot; in French).

The cake is cut by the youngest (and therefore most innocent) person at the table to assure that the recipient of the bean is random. The person who gets the piece of cake with the trinket becomes &quot;king&quot; or &quot;queen&quot; and wears a paper crown provided with the cake. In some regions this person has a choice between offering a beverage to everyone around the table (usually a sparkling wine or champagne), or volunteering to host the next king cake at their home. This can extend the festivities through all of January.

===German-speaking Europe===

January 6 is a public holiday in Austria, three federal states of Germany, and three cantons of Switzerland, as well as in parts of Graubünden.
In the German-speaking lands, groups of young people called &quot;Sternsinger&quot; (star singers) travel from door to door. They are dressed as the Biblical Magi, and their leader carries a star, usually of painted wood attached to a broom handle. Often these groups are four girls, or two boys and two girls in order to sing in four-part harmony. They sing traditional songs and newer ones such as &quot;Stern über Bethlehem&quot;. They are not necessarily three wise men. German Lutherans often note in a lighthearted fashion that the Bible never specifies that the &quot;Weisen&quot; (Magi) were men, or that there were three. The star singers solicit donations for worthy causes, such as efforts to end hunger in Africa, organized jointly by the Catholic and Protestant churches, and they will also be offered treats at the homes they visit. The young people then perform the traditional house blessing, by marking the year over the doorway with chalk. In Roman Catholic communities this may even today be a serious spiritual event with the priest present, but among Protestants it is more a tradition, and a part of the German notion of Gemütlichkeit. Usually on the Sunday following Epiphany, these donations are brought into churches. Here all of the children who have gone out as star singers, once again in their costumes, form a procession of sometimes dozens of wise men and stars. The German Chancellor and Parliament also receive a visit from the star singers at Epiphany.

The Three Kings cake is a golden pastry ring filled with orange and spice representing gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Most often found in Switzerland, these cakes take the form of Buchteln but for Epiphany, studded with citron, and baked as seven large buns in a round rather than square pan, forming a crown. Or they may be made of typical rich Christmas bread dough with cardamom and pearl sugar in the same seven bun crown shape. These varieties are most typically purchased in supermarkets, with the trinket and gold paper crown included. As in other countries, the person who receives the piece or bun containing the trinket or whole almond becomes the king or queen for a day. Epiphany is also an especially joyful occasion for the young and young at heart, as this is the day dedicated to &quot;plündern&quot; – that is, when Christmas trees are &quot;plundered&quot; of their cookies and sweets by eager children (and adults) and when gingerbread houses, and any other good things left in the house from Christmas, are devoured. Lastly, there is a German rhyme saying, or &quot;Bauernregel&quot;, that goes , meaning &quot;If there hasn&#x27;t been any winter (weather) until Epiphany, none is coming afterward.&quot; Another of these &quot;Bauernregel&quot; (German farmer&#x27;s rules) for Epiphany states: , or &quot;If the eve of Epiphany is bright and clear, it foretells a good wine year.&quot;

===Greece, Cyprus===
In Greece, Cyprus and the Greek diaspora throughout the world, the feast is called the Theophany, or colloquially &quot;Phōta&quot; (, &quot;Lights&quot;). It is the &quot;Great Celebration&quot; or &quot;Theotromi&quot;. In some regions of Macedonia (West) it is the biggest festival of the year. The Baptism of Christ symbolizes the rebirth of man, its importance is such that until the fourth century Christians celebrated New Year on this day. Customs revolve around the Great Blessing of the Waters. It marks the end of the traditional ban on sailing, as the tumultuous winter seas are cleansed of the mischief-prone &quot;kalikántzaroi&quot;, the goblins that try to torment God-fearing Christians through the festive season. During this ceremony, a cross is thrown into the water, and the men compete to retrieve it for good luck. The &quot;Phota&quot; form the middle of another festive triduum, together with Epiphany Eve, when children sing the Epiphany carols, and the great feast of St. John the Baptist (January 7 and eve), when the numerous Johns and Joans celebrate their name-day.

It is a time for sanctification, which in Greece means expiation, purification of the people and protection against the influence of demons. This concept is certainly not strictly Christian, but has roots in ancient worship. In most parts of Greece a ritual called &quot;small sanctification&quot;, &quot;Protagiasi&quot; or &quot;Enlightment&quot; is practiced on the eve of Epiphany. The priest goes door to door with the cross and a branch of basil to &quot;sanctify&quot; or &quot;brighten&quot; the rooms by sprinkling them with holy water. The &quot;protagiasi&quot; casts away the goblins ; bonfires are also lit in some places for that purpose. The &quot;Great Blessing&quot; happens in church on the day of the Epiphany. . Then the &quot;Dive of the Cross&quot; is performed: a cross is throwned by the priest in the sea, a nearby river, a lake or an ancient Roman cistern (as in Athens). According to popular belief, this ritual gives the water the power to cleanse and sanitize. In many places, after the dive of the cross, the locals run to the beaches or the shores of rivers or lakes to wash their agricultural tools and even icons. Indeed, according common folk belief, icons lose their original strength and power with the passage of time, but they can be restored by dipping the icons in the water cleansed by the cross. This may be a survival of ancient beliefs. Athenians held a ceremony called &quot;washing&quot;: the statue of Athena was carried in procession to the coast of Faliro where it was washed with salt water to cleanse it and renew its sacred powers. 
===Guadeloupe Islands===
Celebrations in Guadeloupe have a different feel from elsewhere in the world. Epiphany here does not mean the last day of Christmas celebrations, but rather the first day of &quot;Kannaval&quot; (Carnival), which lasts until the evening before Ash Wednesday. Carnival, in turn, ends with the &quot;grand brilé Vaval&quot;, the burning of Vaval, the king of the &quot;Kannaval&quot;, amidst the cries and wails of the crowd.

=== Hungary ===

On this day, the Christmas trees are taken down. Nowadays, the traditions associated with the holiday are being followed in fewer and fewer villages. Many traditions and superstition are associated with this day. During house blessings (called &quot;koleda&quot;), it was common to write with chalk e.g. 20CMB25 over the door = „Christus Mansionem Benedicat!” in the year 2025, or with meaning by people&#x27;s ethimology: C = Caspar, M = Melchior, B = Balthasar (a monogram made out of the names of the 3 Kings) next to the year to protect them against witches hex or lightnings. The preachers were given a bowl of corn, a bowl of peas, a pig&#x27;s foot to eat and gifted them a bag of plums, nuts, flour, salo and sausages. With the holywater they blessed their kids, house and animals and their dead (sprinkled on coffins). There were places where people attributed magical powers to simple brooks, like in Jászdózsa, where they cut a hole in the Tarna (today: Trnava) and people splashed each other with the icy water to be healthy. Csillagének (Star singing) and &quot;Csillagozás&quot; were both common. The children doing the Csillagének prepared costumes and mechanically-moved stars, and it wasn&#x27;t only performed by boys. This was accomponied by &quot;Háromkirályjárás&quot; where next to the singing they also performed the story of the Biblical Magi and the Story of Herod. As with most Hungarian holidays, there were also superstitions connected to Epiphany (&quot;Vízkereszt&quot;): for example, in Józseffalva, Bukovina, it was believed that if you braid that day the sausages will become longer next year.

===India===

In parts of southern India, Epiphany is called the Three Kings Festival and is celebrated in front of the local church like a fair. This day marks the close of the Advent and Christmas season and people remove the cribs and nativity sets at home. In Goa Epiphany may be locally known by its Portuguese name &quot;Festa dos Reis&quot;. In the village of Reis Magos, in Goa, there is a fort called Reis Magos (Wise Men) or Três Reis Magos for Biblical Magi. Celebrations include a widely attended procession, with boys arrayed as the Magi, leading to the Franciscan Chapel of the Magi near the Goan capital of Panjim. Other popular Epiphany processions are held in Chandor. Here three young boys in regal robes and splendid crowns descend the nearby hill of Our Lady of Mercy on horseback towards the main church where a three-hour festival Mass is celebrated. The route before them is decorated with streamers, palm leaves and balloons with the smallest children present lining the way, shouting greetings to the Kings. The Kings are traditionally chosen, one each, from Chandor&#x27;s three hamlets of Kott, Cavorim and Gurdolim, whose residents helped build the Chandor church in 1645.

In the past the kings were chosen only from among high-caste families, but since 1946 the celebration has been open to all. Participation is still expensive as it involves getting a horse, costumes, and providing a lavish buffet to the community afterwards, in all totaling some 100,000 rupees (about US$2,250) per king. This is undertaken gladly since having son serve as a king is considered a great honor and a blessing on the family.

Cansaulim in South Goa is similarly famous for its Three Kings festival, which draws tourists from around the state and India. Three boys are selected from the three neighboring villages of Quelim, Cansaulim and Arrosim to present the gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh in a procession. Only a native of these villages may serve as king; outsiders are barred from the role. Throughout the year, excitement runs high in the villages to see who will be chosen. The boys selected are meticulously groomed, and must grow their hair long in time for the festival. The procession involves the three kings wearing jeweled red velvet robes and crowns, riding white horses decked with flowers and fine cloth, and they are shaded by colorful parasols, with a retinue of hundreds.

The procession ends at the local church built in 1581, and in its central window a large white star hangs, and colored banners stream out across the square from those around it. Inside, the church will have been decorated with garlands. After presenting their gifts and reverencing the altar and Nativity scene, the kings take special seats of honor and assist at the High Mass.

The Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala State, Epiphany is known by its Syriac name &quot;Denha&quot;. Saint Thomas Christians, like other Eastern Christians, celebrate &quot;Denha&quot; as a great feast to commemorate the Baptism of Jesus in the river Jordan. The liturgical season &quot;Denhakalam&quot; (&quot;Weeks of Epiphany&quot;) commemorates the second revelation at the Baptism and the subsequent public life of Jesus. &quot;Denha&quot; is celebrated on January 6 by the Syro-Malabar Church in two ways – &quot;Pindiperunnal&quot; (&quot;Plantain trunk feast&quot;) and &quot;Rakkuliperunal&quot; (&quot;Feast with a night bath&quot;).

===Ireland===
The Irish call the day the Feast of the Epiphany or traditionally Little Christmas or &quot;Women&#x27;s Christmas&quot; (Irish: &quot;&quot;). On Nollaig na mBan, women traditionally rested and celebrated for themselves after the cooking and work of the Christmas holidays. The custom was for women to gather on this day for a special meal, but on the occasion of Epiphany accompanied by wine, to honor the Miracle at the Wedding at Cana.

Today, women may dine at a restaurant or gather in a pub in the evening. They may also receive gifts from children, grandchildren or other family members on this day. Other Epiphany customs, which symbolize the end of the Christmas season, are popular in Ireland, such as the burning the sprigs of Christmas holly in the fireplace which have been used as decorations during the past twelve days. In Ireland, certain traditions celebrate Epiphany to conclude the Twelfth Night of Christmas, and Christmas decorations should not be removed before this day.

The Epiphany celebration serves as the initial setting for – and anchors the action, theme, and climax of – James Joyce&#x27;s short story &quot;The Dead&quot; in his 1914 collection &quot;Dubliners&quot;.

===Italy===

Christmas in Italy is one of the country&#x27;s major holidays and begins on 8 December, with the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the day on which traditionally the Christmas tree is mounted and ends on 6 January, of the following year with the Epiphany.

In Italian folklore and folk customs, the Befana (the name being a corruption of the word &quot;Epifania&quot;) is a witch-like old woman who delivers gifts to children throughout Italy on Epiphany Eve (the night of January 5) in a similar way to Santa Claus or the Three Magi. The Befana is a widespread tradition among Italians and thus has many names. She is a part of both popular national culture and traditional folk culture and is akin to other figures who roam about sometime during the Twelve Days and reward the good, punish the bad, and receive offerings. The Befana is a mysterious, contradictory figure of unclear origins. The legend told of her is that, having missed her opportunity to bring a gift to the child Jesus together with the Biblical Magi, she now brings gifts to other children on that night.

This character is enhanced by the fact that she is overall neglected by scholars but is the subject of much speculation by the ones who do mention her. Pre-Christian, Christian, and syncretism of the two have all been postulated as explanations of her origins. In some parts of Italy, especially the central regions, mumming takes place on Epiphany eve. Dolls are made of her and effigies are burnt and bonfires are often lit. She brings gifts to good children, typically sweets, candies or toys, but coal to bad children. She is usually portrayed as a hag riding a broomstick through the air wearing a black shawl and is covered in soot because she enters the children&#x27;s houses through the chimney. She is often smiling and carries a bag or hamper filled with candy, gifts, or both. She is not only loved but also feared and mocked, particularly by children.

Written records of the Befana and Befanata date to the Middle Ages. Her origins are the subject of speculation by scholars who have variously proposed they lie in paganism, Christianity, or a mix of the two. John B. Smith said she, like her High German counterpart Perchta, is nothing more than the personification of Epiphany invented by medieval Christians who had a tendency to personify feast and fast days while Jacob Grimm found it not credible that two separate cultures would personify a feast day as a supernatural figure (&quot;a name in the calendar had caused the invention of a supernatural being&quot;) and concluded it was far more likely that the Befana and Perchta were pre-Christian in origin and that they blended with the Christian holiday name. It has been pointed out that there was &quot;a clear attempt to Christianize the disturbing female character by transforming her into the female personification of the feast.&quot; Generally the pre-Christian origin is the one most proposed and the Befana is often said to be a goddess or the remnant of one, though what culture and time period she comes from has been less uniform. Cultures that have been proposed include Roman, Celtic, Neolithic farmers, and Paleolithic hunter-gatherers.

However, in some parts of today&#x27;s Italian state, different traditions exist, and instead of the &quot;Befana&quot; it is the three Magi who bring gifts. in Sardinia, for example, where local traditions and customs of the Hispanic period coexist, the tradition of the Biblical Magi (in Sardinian language, &quot;&quot;) bringing gifts to children is very present.

===Jordan===

Thousands of Jordanian Christians, tourists and pilgrims flock to Al-Maghtas site on the east bank of the Jordan River in January every year to mark Epiphany, where large masses and celebrations are held. &quot;Al-Maghtas&quot;, meaning &quot;baptism&quot; or &quot;immersion&quot; in Arabic, is an archaeological World Heritage site in Jordan, officially known as &quot;Baptism Site &quot;Bethany Beyond the Jordan&quot; (Al-Maghtas)&quot;. It is considered to be the original location of the Baptism of Jesus and the ministry of John the Baptist and has been venerated as such since at least the Byzantine period.

: : &quot;These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptising&quot;.

The site has then seen several archaeological digs, four papal visits and state visits and attracts tourists and pilgrimage activity. Approximately 81,000 people visited the site in 2016, mostly European, American and Arab tourists.

===Latvia===
Epiphany is known in Latvia as &#x27; (Three Kings Day) by Catholics or &#x27; (Star Day) by Lutherans after the custom of star singing, and the Star of Bethlehem which led the Magi to the Christ Child. In the past bright stars of fabric were sewn onto the background of dark colored quilts, representing the night sky. Epiphany was a day of enjoyment, spent in horse-drawn open sleighs, and these quilts would then be taken along to cover the laps of the merry riders. If Epiphany Day was bright and mild and the sun &quot;warmed the horses&#x27; backs&quot; it was said that the coming year would bring only peace. If the night before Epiphany saw clear starry skies, it meant Latvia could expect a fine harvest in the coming Summer. Weaving and wood-cutting were &quot;bad luck&quot;, giving both men and women a proper holiday, and if a dog was heard barking on Epiphany one ought to look for his or her future spouse in that same direction. Special three-corner apple cakes are eaten on this day, and as in other countries, star singing, visiting and house blessings have long been popular.

===Lebanon===
Epiphany, celebrated on January 6, is the feast for the Roman Church that commemorates the visit of the Wise Men, the magi. However, in the Maronite Church, in accordance with the ancient tradition, it represents the public announcement of Jesus&#x27; mission when he was baptized in the Jordan by John the Forerunner, also known as &quot;John the Baptist&quot;. On the occasion, Lebanese Christians pray for their deceased.

It is celebrated by attending church most often to the midnight mass by the maronites. The reason why it is at midnight is because the Christ will be passing to bless homes, also Lebanese Christians who gathered for the mass congratulate each other on that day by saying: &quot;El Deyim Deyim&quot; () which translates as &quot;The permanent is permanent&quot;. They also mix dough made out of water and flour only and it rises outdoors with no yeast by being blessed.

===North Macedonia===
Epiphany in North Macedonia is known as Vodici (Водици). On this day the priest throws a wooden cross into the water, to symbolize the baptism of Christ. Men jump into the cold water to retrieve the cross, and whoever retrieves it is believed to be blessed during the whole year. These are very festive gatherings with many spectacles attending the sites. Special food jelly from pork and beef meat and bones called &quot;pacha&quot; (пача) or &quot;pivtii&quot; (пивтии) is prepared the day before, but served on the day after Epiphany, together with warm local brandy, rakija (ракија). Epiphany is a non-working day for the Orthodox believers in North Macedonia.

===Malta===
In Malta, Epiphany is commonly known as &quot;It-Tre Re&quot; (The Three Kings). Until the 1980s, January 6 was a public holiday, but today the Maltese celebrate Epiphany on the first Sunday of the year. Children and students still take January 6 as a school holiday and Christmas decorations are lit up through this day on most public streets. The Maltese also have a long-standing custom of presenting concerts in honor of Epiphany, including the prestigious annual Epiphany Concert organized by the Malta Council for Culture and Arts, performed by the National Orchestra. In 2010, the Epiphany Concert which used to be held before a select audience, was opened to the general public following a decision by the President. The Ministry of Education and Culture therefore moved from the venue from the Palace to the historic Sacra Infermeria, also known as the Mediterranean Conference Centre. &quot;Qagħaq tal-Għasel&quot; or &quot;tal-Qastanija&quot; (Maltese honey rings) are typically served at Epiphany in Malta.

===Mexico===
The evening of January 5 marks the Twelfth Night of Christmas and is when the figurines of the three Biblical Magi are added to the nativity scene. Traditionally in Mexico, as with many other Latin American countries, Santa Claus does not hold the cachet that he does in the United States. Rather, it is the Magi who are the bearers of gifts, who leave presents in or near the shoes of small children. Mexican families also commemorate the date by eating &quot;Rosca de reyes&quot;. In modern Mexico however, and particularly in the larger cities and in the North, local traditions are now being observed and intertwined with the greater North American Santa Claus tradition, as well as with other holidays such as Halloween, due to Americanization via film and television, creating an economy of gifting tradition that spans from Christmas Day until January 6.

===Peru===
Peru shares Epiphany customs with Spain and the rest of Latin America. Peruvian national lore holds that Francisco Pizarro was the first to call Lima &quot;Ciudad de los Reyes&quot; (City of the Kings) because the date of the Epiphany coincided with the day he and his two companions searched for, and found, an ideal location for a new capital. Even more popular in Peru than gift giving is the custom of the &quot;Bajada de Reyes&quot; when parties are held in honor of the taking down of family and public nativity scenes, and carefully putting them away until the next Christmas.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, Epiphany is known as &quot;Three Kings&#x27; Day&quot; and &quot;Pasko ng Matatanda&quot; (&quot;Feast of the Elderly&quot;), and marks the official close of the country&#x27;s Christmas season. As a day of feasting, some Filipinos celebrate with gift-giving and greet each other &quot;Happy Three Kings!&quot;.

===Poland===
In Poland, Epiphany, or &quot;&quot; (Three Kings) is celebrated in grand fashion, with huge parades held welcoming the Wise Men, often riding on camels or other animals from the zoo, in Warsaw, Poznań and over 2,000 other cities. The Wise Men pass out sweets, children process in renaissance wear, carols are sung, and living nativity scenes are enacted, all similar to celebrations in Italy or Spain, pointing to the country&#x27;s Catholic heritage. Children may also dress in colors signifying Europe, Asia, and Africa (the supposed homes of the Wise Men) and at the end of the parade route, church leaders often preach on the spiritual significance of the Epiphany. In 2011, by an act of Parliament, Epiphany was restored as an official non-working national public holiday in Poland for the first time since it was canceled under communism fifty years earlier.

Poles though take small boxes containing chalk, a gold ring, incense and a piece of amber, in memory of the gifts of the Magi, to church to be blessed. Once at home, they inscribe &quot;K+M+B+&quot; and the year with the blessed chalk above every door in the house, according to tradition, to provide protection against illness and misfortune for those within. The letters, with a cross after each one, are said to stand either for the traditionally applied names of the Three Kings in Polish – Kacper, Melchior and Baltazar – or for a Latin inscription meaning &quot;Christ bless this house.&quot; They remain above the doors all year until they are inadvertently dusted off or replaced by new markings the next year. On January 6, as in much of Europe, a Polish style Three Kings cake is served with a coin or almond baked inside. The one who gets it is king or queen for the day, signified by wearing the paper crown that decorates the cake. According to Polish tradition this person will be lucky in the coming year. Recipes vary by region. Some serve a French-type puff pastry cake with almond paste filling, others favor a sponge cake with almond cream filling, and yet others enjoy a light fruitcake.

Epiphany in Poland also signals the beginning of &quot;zapusty&quot; or carnival time, when &quot;pączki&quot; (doughnuts) and &quot;chrust&quot; (Angel wings) are served.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, Epiphany, January 6, is called &#x27; (Day of the Kings), during which the traditional &quot;Bolo Rei&quot; (King cake) is baked and eaten. Plays and pageants are popular on this day, and parents often hold parties for their children. Epiphany is also a time when the traditional Portuguese dances known as &quot;Mouriscadas&quot; and &quot;Paulitos&quot; are performed. The latter is an elaborate stick dance. The dancers, who are usually men but may be dressed as women, manipulate sticks or staves (in imitation swords) in two opposing lines. It is a tradition too in Portugal for people to gather in small groups and to go from house to house to sing the &#x27; (meaning &quot;Kings&quot;) which are traditional songs about the life of Jesus. The singers also bring greetings to the owners of the house. After singing for a while outside, they are invited in, and the owners of the house offer them sweets, liqueurs, and other Epiphany delicacies. These &quot;&quot; usually begin on Epiphany eve and last until January 20.

Portuguese village of Vale de Salgueiro encourages children, some as young as five, to smoke in a tradition that does not have clear roots.

===Romania and Moldova===
In Romania and Moldova, Epiphany is called &quot;Boboteaza&quot;. In south-eastern Romania, following religious services, men participate in winter horse races. Before the race, the men line up with their horses before the priest, who will bless them by sprinkling them with green branches that have been dipped into Epiphany holy water. Sometimes people desire to have this blessing for themselves as well. Winning the Epiphany race is a great honor for both horse and rider, while the post-race celebrations, win or not, are highly festive. As in other Eastern Orthodox heritage countries, water rites play a special role on this day. A unique piece of Romanian folk wisdom holds that if a girl slips on ice – or, better yet, falls into water – on Epiphany, she will surely marry before the year is out.

In Transylvania (Erdély/Siebenbürgen), Lutheran and Reformed Christians of Hungarian and Saxon descent celebrate Epiphany with star singing and house blessing, as in Central Europe. The star singing custom had long ago spread throughout Romania and the Republic of Moldova. Here the star, called &quot;Steaua&quot;, today resembles a stained-glass lantern and features an Orthodox icon at its center, a tradition pointing to the blending of both East and West which characterizes the two nations on the river Prut.

===Russia===
The Epiphany, celebrated in Russia on January 19, marks the baptism of Jesus in the Eastern Orthodox Church. As elsewhere in the Orthodox world, the Russian Church conducts the rite of the Great Blessing of the Waters, also known as &quot;the Great Sanctification of the Water&quot; on that day (or the eve before). The priest-led procession could simply proceed to the font, but traditionally the worshipers would go to a nearby lake or river.

Historical records indicate that the blessing of the waters events took place at the courts of Moscow Czars since no later than 1525. According to historians, the blessing of the waters procession was the most magnificent of the annual Czar&#x27;s court&#x27;s ceremonies, comparable only to such special events as royal coronations and weddings. After a divine liturgy in the Kremlin&#x27;s Dormition Cathedral, the procession, led by the Czar and the Patriarch of Moscow would proceed to the frozen Moskva River. An ice-hole would have been made in the ice, called &quot;Iordan&#x27;&quot; (in memory of the Jordan River), over which a small gazebo would have been erected and decorated with holy icons, one of which would depict the Baptism of Christ. The Patriarch would immerse his cross into the river&#x27;s water; and sprinkle the Czar, his boyars, and the banners of Czar&#x27;s army&#x27;s regiments with the holy water. A load of holy water would then be brought back to the Kremlin, to be used in blessing the Czar&#x27;s palace. On a smaller scale, similar events would take place in the parishes throughout the nation.

Believing that on this day water becomes holy and is imbued with special powers, Russians cut holes called &quot;Iordan&#x27;&quot; in the ice of lakes and rivers, often in the shape of the cross, to bathe in the freezing water. This practice is said to be popularized comparatively recently; it was fairly uncommon in the czarist days, but has flourished since the 1990s.

Participants in the ritual may dip themselves under the water three times, honoring the Holy Trinity, to symbolically wash away their sins from the past year, and to experience a sense of spiritual rebirth. Orthodox priests are on hand to bless the water, and rescuers are on hand to monitor the safety of the swimmers in the ice-cold water. Others limit their participation in the Epiphany rites to those conducted inside churches, where priests perform the Great Blessing of Waters, both on Epiphany Eve and Epiphany (Theophany) proper. The water is then distributed to attendees who may store it to use in times of illness, to bless themselves, family members, and their homes, or to drink. Some Russians think any water – even from the taps on the kitchen sink – poured or bottled on Epiphany becomes holy water, since all the water in the world is blessed this day. In the more mild climate of the southern city of Sochi meanwhile, where air and water temperatures both hover in the low to mid 10-degree Celsius range (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in January, thousands of people jump into the Black Sea at midnight each year on Epiphany and begin to swim in celebration of the feast.

===Slovenia===
In Slovenia, especially in the Western part of the country, during the first day of the year and on Epiphany, children go from house to house because villagers will give them almonds, dried figs, nuts, cookies or other good things that they have at home.

===Spain===
In Spain and some Latin American countries, Epiphany day is called &quot;&quot; i.e., the day when a group of Kings or Magi, as related in the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, arrived to worship and bring three gifts to the baby Jesus after following a star in the heavens. In Spanish tradition on January 6, three of the Kings: Melchior, Gaspar, and Balthazar, representing Arabia, the Orient, and Africa, arrived on horse, camel and elephant, bringing respectively gold, frankincense and myrrh to the baby Jesus. Before going to bed on the eve of January 6, children polish their shoes and leave them ready for the Kings&#x27; presents to be put in them. The next morning presents will &quot;appear&quot; under their shoes, or if the children are deemed to have misbehaved during the year, coal (usually a lump of hard sugar candy dyed black, called Carbón Dulce). Most towns in Spain arrange colorful parades representing the arrival of the &quot;Reyes Magos&quot; to town so children can see them on their camels or carriages and receive sweets and toys thrown to the crowds from the paraders, before they go to bed. The oldest of these parades is held in Alcoy, Alicante (Valencian Community) which has hosted an annual parade since 1885. Sweet wine, nibbles, fruit and milk are left for the Kings and their camels. In Spain, children typically receive presents on this day, rather than on Christmas, though this tradition has changed lately, and children now receive presents on both days. The Epiphany bread/cake is known as &quot;Roscón&quot;, &quot;Tortell de Reis&quot; in Catalan, and in Mexico as &quot;Rosca de reyes&quot;.

===Sweden===
Epiphany is a public holiday in Sweden, where it is known as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Thirteenth Day Yule&quot;), as January 6 is the thirteenth day after Christmas Eve, the main day on which Christmas is celebrated in Sweden. However, the end of the Christmas celebration is on January 13, St. Knut&#x27;s Day, more commonly known as &quot;Twentieth Day Yule&quot; (or &quot;Twentieth Day Knut&quot;).

===United States===
In Louisiana, Epiphany is the beginning of the Carnival season, during which it is customary to bake King Cakes, similar to the Rosca mentioned above. It is round in shape, filled with cinnamon, glazed white, and coated in traditional carnival color sanding sugar. The person who finds the doll (or bean) must provide the next king cake. The interval between Epiphany and Mardi Gras is sometimes known as &quot;king cake season&quot;, and many may be consumed during this period. The Carnival season begins on King&#x27;s Day (Epiphany), and there are many traditions associated with that day in Louisiana and along the Catholic coasts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. King cakes are first sold then, Carnival krewes begin having their balls on that date, and the first New Orleans krewe parades in street cars that night.

In Puerto Rico, Epiphany is an important festive holiday, and is commonly referred as &quot;&quot; or &quot;Three Kings&#x27; Day&quot;. It is traditional for children to fill a box with fresh grass or hay and put it underneath their bed, for the Wise Men&#x27;s horses or camels, depending on the household. Sometimes, the grass is cut fresh by the children on January 5. Many artisans make commemorative traditional figures of the Magi on horseback. The Three Wise Men of Puerto Rico, according to local tradition, arrive on horseback instead of camels, as in other countries where the custom is also ingrained. The Three Wise Men will then take the grass to feed the horses and will leave gifts under the bed as a reward. In other households, the grass is &quot;eaten&quot; by the Magi&#x27;s transport bedside to &quot;strengthen them for the long night&#x27;s journey&quot;, while the presents are delivered by the Magi as they did for child Jesus. These traditions are analogous to the customs of children leaving mince pies and sherry out for Father Christmas in Western Europe or leaving milk and cookies for Santa Claus like the rest of the United States. On the day before the feast (January 5), the &quot;Rosario de Reyes&quot; or &quot;Promesa de Reyes&quot; is celebrated with songs (locally called &quot;aguinaldos&quot;) thanking or asking the Kings for their blessing, usually before a little table with figures of the Nativity and the Kings or with the Kings alone and their camels or horses. However, recently public concerts have also become popular. This celebration is often accompanied with a chicken soup (&quot;asopa&#x27;o&quot;), snacks, and drinks.

In Colonial Virginia, Epiphany, or 12th Night, was an occasion of great merriment, and was considered especially appropriate as a date for balls and dancing, as well as for weddings. On 12th Night, Great Cake was prepared, consisting in two giant layers of fruitcake, coated and filled with royal icing. Custom dictated that the youngest child present cut and serve the cake and whoever found the bean or prize in the Twelfth Night cake was crowned &quot;King of the Bean&quot; similar to the European king cake custom.

In Erie, Pennsylvania, as part of an Epiphany party a king is hidden in a cake, and whichever child finds the king in the cake is crowned king for the day.

Tarpon Springs, Florida, is known for elaborate religious ceremonies related to the Greek Orthodox Church, the most notable being the Epiphany celebration. The Metropolitan of Atlanta usually presides over the blessings, sometimes joined by the Archbishop of America. The blessings conclude with the ceremonial throwing of a wooden cross into the city&#x27;s Spring Bayou, and boys ages 16 to 18 diving in to retrieve it. Whoever recovers the cross is said to be blessed for a full year. Following the blessings, the celebration moves to the Sponge Docks where food and music are made part of the festivities. Tarpon Springs has given itself the nickname Epiphany City. The celebration attracts Greek Americans from across the country, and the city&#x27;s population is known to triple in size for that day.

In Manitou Springs, Colorado, Epiphany is marked by the Great Fruitcake Toss. Fruitcakes are thrown, participants dress as kings, fools, etc., and competitions are held for the farthest throw, the most creative projectile device, etc. As with customs in other countries, the fruitcake toss is a sort of festive symbolic leave-taking of the Christmas holidays until next year, but with humorous twist, since fruitcake is considered with a certain degree of derision in most of the United States, and is the source of many jokes.

===Wales===
On January 6, the Feast of the Epiphany has long been an important celebration in Wales, known there as &quot;&quot;. In Glamorganshire, a huge loaf or cake was prepared, which was then divided up into three parts to represent Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Biblical Magi. A large company of neighbours was invited to be present at the dividing of the cake in which rings were concealed. Whoever discovered a ring in his piece of cake (or bread) was elected as King or Queen and presided over the day&#x27;s festivities. January 6 was the old-calendar Christmas Day and many of the festivities connected with it lasted well over a century after the new calendar was introduced in 1752.

Wales shares other Twelfth Night customs with its neighbor, England, including the Yule log, and the wassail to wish farmers a good harvest in the coming year, but here the Yule log&#x27;s ashes were saved then buried along with the seeds planted in the ensuing spring to ensure a good harvest, while the wassail bowl was taken to the house of newlyweds or to a family which had recently come to live in the district and songs sung outside the house door. Those inside the house would recite or sing special verses, to be answered by the revelers outside.

Another Welsh custom associated with Epiphany was the Hunting of the Wren. A group of young men would go out into the countryside to capture a wren (the smallest bird in the British Isles after the goldcrest/firecrest). The bird would then be placed in a small, decorated cage and carried around from house to house and shown in exchange for money or gifts of food and drink. (If a wren could not be found then a sparrow would have to undergo the ritual.)

<doc id="1018094" wikidata="Q324246" url="?curid=1018094" title="Briton Hadden">
<text>Briton Hadden (February 18, 1898 – February 27, 1929) was the co-founder of &quot;Time&quot; magazine with his Yale classmate Henry Luce. He was &quot;Time&quot;″s first editor and the inventor of its revolutionary writing style, known as Timestyle. Though he died at 31, he was considered one of the most influential journalists of the twenties, a master innovator and stylist, and an iconic figure of the Jazz Age.

== Early life ==
Born in Brooklyn, Hadden got his start in newspaper writing at Brooklyn&#x27;s Poly Prep Country Day School, where he wrote for the school magazine, the &quot;Poly Prep&quot;, and distributed a hand-written, underground sheet to his classmates that was called &quot;The Daily Glonk&quot;. Moving to the Hotchkiss School, he wrote for the &quot;Hotchkiss Record&quot;, a weekly newspaper. After an intense competition, he was elected the chairman of the newspaper and Luce the assistant managing editor. Hadden then turned the &quot;Record&quot; from a weekly into a bi-weekly.

At Yale, Hadden was elected to the staff of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; and later served as the paper&#x27;s chairman twice (1917-1918 and 1919–1920). Luce was the News&#x27; managing editor the second time. While at Yale, he was a brother of Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter) and a member of Skull and Bones. It was during a break from school, when Hadden and Luce traveled south to Camp Jackson, South Carolina, as ROTC officer candidates, that they began seriously discussing the idea of creating a magazine that would condense all the news of the week into a brief and easily readable &quot;digest.&quot;

==Career ==
After receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Yale University in 1920, Hadden wrote for the &quot;New York World&quot;, where he was mentored by one of New York&#x27;s most famous and accomplished newspaper editors, Herbert Bayard Swope. In late 1921, Hadden wrote to Luce, who had recently been let go by the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, and suggested that they both go to work for the &quot;Baltimore News&quot;. In Baltimore, they spent their nights working on the idea of a news magazine, which, at first, they planned to call &quot;Facts&quot;.

===Founding &quot;Time&quot; magazine===
In 1923, Hadden and Luce co-founded &quot;Time&quot; magazine along with Robert Livingston Johnson and another Yale classmate. Hadden and Luce served alternating years as the company&#x27;s president, but Hadden was the editor for four and a half of the magazine&#x27;s first six years, and was considered the &quot;presiding genius&quot;. Johnson served as the magazine&#x27;s vice president and advertising director. In its earliest years the magazine was edited in an abandoned beer brewery, subsequently moving to Cleveland in 1925, and returning to New York in 1927. For the next year and several months, both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; were edited at 25 W. 45th Street in Manhattan. Thus two of the major magazine editors of the 1920s—Briton Hadden and Harold Ross—worked in the same building.

== Illness and death ==
In December 1928, Hadden became ill. He died two months later, most likely of streptococcus viridans, which had entered his bloodstream, causing sepsis and ultimately the failure of his heart. Before he died, Hadden signed a will, which left all of his stock in Time Inc. to his mother and forbade his family from selling those shares for 49 years. Within a year of Hadden&#x27;s death, Luce formed a syndicate, which succeeded in gaining hold of Hadden&#x27;s stock.

== Legacy ==
Luce took Hadden&#x27;s name off the masthead of &quot;Time&quot; within two weeks of his death. In the next 38 years, he delivered more than 300 speeches around the world, mentioning Hadden four times. Luce acquired control of Hadden&#x27;s papers, and he kept them at Time Inc., where no one outside the company was allowed to view the papers as long as Luce lived. Throughout his life, Luce repeatedly claimed credit for Hadden&#x27;s ideas in public speeches and in &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Luce presided over the growth of the &quot;Time&quot;-&quot;Life&quot; empire, and donated funds towards the construction of a building at 202 York Street in New Haven, Connecticut, that would eventually become the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;&#x27; new home. The office is today called the Briton Hadden Memorial Building.

<doc id="1018096" wikidata="Q99572267" url="?curid=1018096" title="Title case">
<text>Title case or headline case is a style of capitalization used for rendering the titles of published works or works of art in English. When using title case, all words are capitalized, except for minor words (typically articles, short prepositions, and some conjunctions) that are not the first or last word of the title. There are different rules for which words are major, hence capitalized.
As an example, a headline might be written like this: &quot;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps over the Lazy Dog&quot;.

==Rules==
The rules of title case are not universally standardized. The standardization is only at the level of house styles and individual style guides. Most English style guides agree that the first and last words should always be capitalized, whereas articles, short prepositions, and some conjunctions should not be. Other rules about the capitalization vary.

In text processing, title case usually involves the capitalization of all words irrespective of their part of speech. This simplified variant of title case is also known as &quot;start case&quot; or &quot;initial caps&quot;.

=== &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; ===
According to the &quot;Associated Press Stylebook&quot; (2020 edition, 55th edition), the following rules should be applied:
* Capitalize the principal words.
* Capitalize prepositions and conjunctions of four letters or more.
* Lowercase the articles &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;an&quot;.
* Capitalize the first and last words (overrides the rules above).
* Capitalize the &quot;to&quot; in infinitives (e.g., I Want To Play Guitar).

=== &quot;Chicago Manual of Style&quot; ===
According to &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; (15th edition), the following rules should be applied:
* Always capitalize &quot;major&quot; words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and some conjunctions).
* Lowercase the conjunctions &quot;and&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, and &quot;nor&quot;.
* Lowercase the articles &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;an&quot;.
* Lowercase prepositions, regardless of length, except when they are stressed, are used adverbially or adjectivally, or are used as conjunctions.
* Lowercase the words &quot;to&quot; and &quot;as&quot;.
* Lowercase the second part of Latin species names.
* Lowercase the second word after a hyphenated prefix (e.g., Mid-, Anti-, Super-, etc.) in compound modifiers (e.g., Mid-year, Anti-hero, etc.).
* Always capitalize the first and last words of titles and subtitles (overrides the rules above).

Since the 18th edition (2024), prepositions of more than four letters are capitalized.

=== &quot;Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook&quot; ===
According to the 9th edition of the Modern Language Association Handbook, the following title capitalization rules should be applied:

* Capitalize the first word of the title/heading and of any subtitle/subheading.
* Capitalize all major words (nouns, verbs including phrasal verbs such as &quot;play with&quot;, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns) in the title/heading, including the second part of hyphenated major words (e.g., Self-Report not Self-report).
* Lowercase the second word after a hyphenated prefix (e.g., Mid-, Anti-, Super-, etc.) in compound modifiers (e.g., Mid-year, Anti-hero, etc.).
* Do not capitalize articles, prepositions (regardless of length), and coordinating conjunctions.
* Do not capitalize &quot;to&quot; in infinitives (e.g., I Want to Play Guitar).

=== &quot;APA Style&quot; ===
According to the 7th edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, the following title capitalization rules should be applied:

* Capitalize the first word of the title/heading and of any subtitle/subheading
* Capitalize all major words (nouns, verbs including phrasal verbs such as &quot;play with&quot;, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns) in the title/heading, including the second part of hyphenated major words (e.g., Self-Report not Self-report)
* Capitalize all words of four letters or more.
* Lowercase the second word after a hyphenated prefix (e.g., Mid-, Anti-, Super-, etc.) in compound modifiers (e.g., Mid-year, Anti-hero, etc.).

=== &quot;American Medical Association (AMA) Manual of Style Capitalization Rules&quot; ===
According to the 11th edition of the American Medical Association (AMA) Manual of Style, the following title capitalization rules should be applied:

* Capitalize the first and the last word of titles and subtitles.
* Capitalize nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs (including phrasal verbs such as &quot;play with&quot;), adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions (major words).
* Lowercase articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions of three letters or fewer.
* Lowercase &quot;to&quot; in infinitives.
* Lowercase the second word in a hyphenated compound when it is a prefix or suffix (e.g., &quot;Anti-itch&quot;, &quot;World-wide&quot;) or part of a single word.
* Capitalize the second word in a hyphenated compound if both words are equal and not suffixes or prefixes (e.g., &quot;Cost-Benefit&quot;)
* Capitalize the first non-Greek letter after a lowercase Greek letter (e.g., &quot;ω-Bromohexanoic&quot;)
* Lowercase the first non-Greek letter after a capital Greek letter (e.g., &quot;Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol&quot;)
* Capitalize the genus but not the species epithet.

=== &quot;The Bluebook&quot; ===
According to the 21st edition of &quot;The Bluebook&quot;, used for legal citations, the following title capitalization rules should be applied:

* Capitalize the first and the last word.
* Capitalize nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs (including phrasal verbs such as &quot;play with&quot;), adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions.
* Lowercase articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions of four letters or fewer.
* Lowercase &quot;to&quot; in infinitives (though not defined in the stylebook).

== Title case in references ==
The use of title case or sentence case in the references of scholarly publications is determined by the used citation style and can differ from the usage in title or headings. For example, APA Style uses sentence case for the title of the cited work in the list of references, but it uses title case for the title of the current publication (or for the title of a publication if it is mentioned in the text instead). Moreover, it uses title case for the title of periodicals even in the references. Other citation styles like &quot;Chicago Manual of Style&quot; are using title case also for the title of cited works in the list of references.

<text>Leopold Infeld (20 August 1898 – 15 January 1968) was a Polish physicist who worked mainly in Poland and Canada (1938–1950). He was a Rockefeller fellow at Cambridge University (1933–1934) and a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

==Early life==
Leopold Infeld was born into a family of Polish Jews in Kraków, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (it rejoined an independent Poland in 1918). He studied physics at Kraków&#x27;s Jagiellonian University and from 1920 in Berlin, where he had engaged Albert Einstein&#x27;s help to gain admission to the University of Berlin. He obtained a doctorate in 1921. In 1933 he left for England, then for the United States and Canada after the death of his second wife, Halina.

==Work==
Infeld was interested in the theory of relativity. He was awarded a doctorate at the Jagiellonian University (1921), worked as an assistant and a docent at the University of Lwów (1930–1933) and then as a professor at the University of Toronto between 1939 and 1950. He collaborated with Albert Einstein at Princeton University (1936–1938). The two scientists jointly formulated the equation describing star movements as well as concurrently writing the book &quot;The Evolution of Physics&quot;.

After the first use of nuclear weapons in 1945, Infeld, like Einstein, became a peace activist. Because of his activities, he was unjustly accused of having communist sympathies. In 1950, he and his family left Canada and returned to communist Poland. He also could not return to the US at that time. In the US, despite having worked previously directly with Einstein, who formally invented nuclear weapons with his famous formula, Infeld risked receiving the death penalty like the Rosenbergs if accused of spying for the Soviet Union.

He felt he had an obligation to help science in Poland recover from the ravages of the Second World War. He served as president of the Polish Physical Society between 1955 and 1957. In the staunchly anti-communist climate of the time, many in the Canadian government and media feared that working in a communist country he would betray nuclear weapons secrets. He was stripped of his Canadian citizenship and was widely denounced as a traitor. In actuality, Infeld&#x27;s field was the theory of relativity—not directly linked to nuclear weapons research. After Infeld&#x27;s return to Poland, he requested a leave of absence from the University of Toronto. His request was denied, and Infeld resigned his post. In 1995 the University of Toronto made amends and granted Infeld the posthumous title of professor emeritus. Upon his return to Poland, Infeld became a professor at the University of Warsaw, a post he held until his death.

The Born–Infeld model was named after Max Born and Leopold Infeld, who first proposed it. The Infeld-Hull Factorization Method describing general sets of solutions to the Schrödinger equation.

Infeld was one of the 11 signatories to the Russell–Einstein Manifesto in 1955 and is the only signatory never to receive a Nobel Prize.

In 1964 he was one of the signatories of the so-called Letter of 34 to Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz regarding freedom of culture.

Infeld is the author of &quot;Quest: An Autobiography&quot; and the biography &quot;Whom the Gods Love: The Story of Évariste Galois&quot;.

=== Personal life ===
In New Jersey, on April 12, 1939, he married a mathematician who took the name Helen Infeld and they had two children, both born in Toronto, Joan M. and Eric (sometimes spelled Eryk).

<text>Summer Elizabeth Sanders (born October 13, 1972) is an American sports commentator, reporter, television personality, actress, former competition swimmer and Olympic champion from 1992.

== Early life ==
Sanders was born in Roseville, California, and attended Cavitt Junior High School and Oakmont High School.

==Swimming career==
By age three, Sanders could swim a lap of the pool. She wanted to be just like her older brother Trevor, so in 1976 she joined the Sugar Bears—an age-group swimming program in Roseville, California, coached by Mike Barsotti, Scott Winter and Scott O&#x27;Conner. From there she jumped to the Sierra Aquatic Club with coach Ralph Thomas, and finally to California Capital Aquatics under coach Mike Hastings.

At age 15, Sanders drew real attention from the swimming world when she barely missed earning a spot on the 1988 Olympic Team, finishing third in the 200-meter individual medley. In her first international meet, she won a silver medal in the 200 individual medley behind Lin Li of China at the 1989 Pan Pacific Championships. At the 1991 Pan Pacific Championships, she won the 400-meter individual medley (beating Lin Li) and the 200-meter butterfly.

In 1991, Sanders enrolled at Stanford University to swim under Hall of Fame coach Richard Quick. In her two-year collegiate swimming career, Sanders won eight NCAA National Championship titles, including the 200-yard butterfly, 200-yard individual medley and 400-yard individual medley and the 4x100-yard medley relay. She won back-to-back NCAA Swimmer of the Year titles and helped her Cardinal team win the 1992 NCAA National Championships. She was the recipient of the Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year in 1991–92.

Sanders won three medals at the 1991 World Championships in Perth, Australia, taking gold in the 200-meter butterfly, silver in the 200-meter individual medley, and bronze in the 400-meter individual medley. She then became the first American woman since Hall of Famer Shirley Babashoff (1976) to qualify for four individual events at one Olympiad at the 1992 Olympic Trials.

At the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain, Sanders won four Olympic medals—gold in the 200-meter butterfly with a time of 2:08.67, gold in the 400-meter medley relay, silver in the 200-meter individual medley, and a bronze medal in the 400-meter individual medley.

==Achievements==
*1992 Olympic Games: gold (200m butterfly), gold (4 × 100 m medley relay – preliminary heat), silver (200m IM), bronze (400m IM), 6th (100m butterfly)
*1991 World Championships: gold (200m butterfly), silver (200m IM), bronze (400m IM)
*8 United States National Championships: 2-100y butterfly, 2-200y butterfly, 1-200y IM, 2-400y IM, 1-200m IM
*9 NCAA National Championships: 2-200y butterfly, 2-200y IM, 2-400y IM, 1-4x50y medley relay, 1-4x100y medley relay, 1-4x100y freestyle relay
*1991 Pan-Pacific Championships: gold (200m IM, 400m IM, 200m butterfly)
*1989 Pan-Pacific Championships: silver (200m IM)

== Television work ==
Sanders began working on television while still competing. In 1992 and 1994 she was a commentator for CBS Sports for the NCAA Swimming Championships. In 1996, she was a commentator for NBC&#x27;s coverage of swimming at the Atlanta Olympics. She acted as an Olympic analyst and host for NBC during the 1996, 2000, 2002 and 2010 Olympic Games, being a Today Show special contributor from 2000 to 2004 and contributed to the network&#x27;s coverage of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City as an on-site reporter. She was also the host of &quot;Scholastic at the Olympic Games&quot; on MSNBC in 2000.

Sanders spent eight years co-hosting &quot;NBA Inside Stuff&quot; with Ahmad Rashad, being a sideline reporter for the WNBA (Lifetime, 1997–1999; NBC, 1999–2002) and a feature correspondent for &quot;NBA on NBC&quot; from 2000 to 2002. She covered tennis as a reporter for United States&#x27;s coverage of the U.S. Open in 2000 and 2001, and was co-host of CBS&#x27; coverage of &quot;Arthur Ashe Kid&#x27;s Day&quot; at the Open from 2000 to 2006.

Sanders has appeared in many programs as correspondent, co-host, and host. Highlights include Nickelodeon, who named her their &quot;commissioner&quot; for the Nick GAS channel in 1998, after being the first female host of a Nickelodeon game show, &quot;Figure It Out&quot; (1997–1999), co-hosting for MTV&#x27;s &quot;Sandblast&quot; in 1994, and hosting the syndicated series &quot;US Olympic Gold&quot; (2002–2005), &quot;Beg, Borrow &amp; Deal&quot; (ESPN, 2003), NBA TV&#x27;s &quot;Mind, Body &amp; Spirit&quot; (2003–2004) and &quot;The Sports List&quot; (Fox Sports Net, 2004–2005). Sanders also co-hosted the Fox celebrity reality series &quot;Skating With Celebrities&quot; in 2006.

In 2009, Sanders began hosting &quot;Inside Out with Summer Sanders.&quot; The show, which is the first original production of Universal Sports, debuted on December 23, 2009, and focuses on in-depth interviews and intimate profiles of notable Olympic athletes. She also worked as a general correspondent for &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;Rachael Ray&quot;.

She appeared on the third season of &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, and competed for charity. In January 2012, she was one of eight celebrities participating in the Food Network reality series &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off&quot;.

Sanders hosted the award-winning &quot;Elite Athlete Workouts&quot; on Yahoo!Sports and covered the 2012 Olympic Games in London for the news outlet. She currently works as a commentator on the new Pac-12 Network.

Her most recent work in TV is hosting the game show &quot;Keywords&quot; for HLN.

== Other media ==
Sanders has appeared as an actress in two films: &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996), in which she played herself, and &quot;Broken Record&quot; (1997).

In June 1999, she published the book &quot;Champions Are Raised, Not Born: How My Parents Made Me A Success&quot;.

==Personal life==
On July 4, 1997, Sanders married Olympic swimmer Mark Henderson. The couple divorced in 2001. In July 2005, she married Erik Schlopy, a World Cup skier who competed at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Sanders and Schlopy have two children. She is a noted fan of the NFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills; her husband is a native Western New Yorker whose cousin Todd Schlopy briefly played for the Bills in 1987.

On June 9, 2007, Sanders&#x27; childhood home was destroyed by a fire.

<doc id="1018112" wikidata="Q409492" url="?curid=1018112" title="Cimetidine">
<text>Cimetidine, sold under the brand name Tagamet among others, is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production. It is mainly used in the treatment of heartburn and peptic ulcers.
With the development of proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, approved for the same indications, cimetidine is available as an over-the-counter formulation to prevent heartburn or acid indigestion, along with the other H2-receptor antagonists.
Cimetidine was developed in 1971 and came into commercial use in 1977. Cimetidine was approved in the United Kingdom in 1976, and was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration in 1979.

==Medical uses==
Cimetidine is indicated for the treatment of duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and pathological hypersecretory conditions. Cimetidine is also used to relieve or prevent heartburn.

==Side effects==
Reported side effects of cimetidine include diarrhea, rashes, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, and muscle pain, all of which are usually mild and transient. It has been reported that mental confusion may occur in the elderly. Because of its hormonal effects, cimetidine rarely may cause sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction and gynecomastia (0.1–0.2%) in males during long-term treatment. Rarely, interstitial nephritis, urticaria, and angioedema have been reported with cimetidine treatment. Cimetidine is also commonly associated with transient raised aminotransferase activity; hepatotoxicity is rare.

==Overdose==
Cimetidine appears to be very safe in overdose, producing no symptoms even with massive overdoses (e.g., 20 g).

== Interactions ==

Due to its non-selective inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes, cimetidine has numerous drug interactions. Examples of specific interactions include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Cimetidine affects the metabolism of methadone, sometimes resulting in higher blood levels and a higher incidence of side effects, and may interact with the antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine.
* Cimetidine can also interact with a number of psychoactive medications, including tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, causing increased blood levels of these drugs and the potential of subsequent toxicity.
* Following administration of cimetidine, the elimination half-life and area-under-curve of zolmitriptan and its active metabolites were roughly doubled.
* Cimetidine is a potent inhibitor of tubular creatinine secretion. Creatinine is a metabolic byproduct of creatine breakdown. Accumulation of creatinine is associated with uremia, but the symptoms of creatinine accumulation are unknown, as they are hard to separate from other nitrogenous waste buildups.
* Like several other medications (e.g., erythromycin), cimetidine interferes with the body&#x27;s metabolization of sildenafil, causing its strength and duration to increase and making its side effects more likely and prominent.
* Clinically significant drug interactions with the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline, the CYP2C9 substrate tolbutamide, the CYP2D6 substrate desipramine, and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam have all been demonstrated with cimetidine, and interactions with other substrates of these enzymes are likely as well.
* Cimetidine has been shown clinically to reduce the clearance of mirtazapine, imipramine, timolol, nebivolol, sparteine, loratadine, nortriptyline, gabapentin, and desipramine in humans.
* Cimetidine inhibits the renal excretion of metformin and procainamide, resulting in increased circulating levels of these drugs.
* Interactions of potential clinical importance with cimetidine include warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, carbamazepine, pethidine and other opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, terfenadine, amiodarone, flecainide, quinidine, fluorouracil, and benzodiazepines.
* Cimetidine may decrease the effects of CYP2D6 substrates that are prodrugs, such as codeine, tramadol, and tamoxifen.
* Cimetidine reduces the absorption of ketoconazole and itraconazole (which require a low pH).
* Cimetidine has a theoretical but unproven benefit in paracetamol toxicity. This is because N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a metabolite of paracetamol (acetaminophen) that is responsible for its hepatotoxicity, is formed from it by the cytochrome P450 system (specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4).
* Cimetidine is used in cancer metastasis research as a blocker of E-selectin.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

====Histamine H2 receptor antagonism====
The mechanism of action of cimetidine as an antacid is as a histamine H2 receptor antagonist. It has been found to bind to the H2 receptor with a Kd of 42 nM.

====Cytochrome P450 inhibition====
Cimetidine is a potent inhibitor of certain cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. The drug appears to primarily inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, of which it is described as a moderate inhibitor. This is notable since these three CYP isoenzymes are involved in CYP-mediated drug biotransformations; however, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 are also involved in the oxidative metabolism of many commonly used drugs. As a result, cimetidine has the potential for a large number of pharmacokinetic interactions.

Cimetidine is reported to be a competitive and reversible inhibitor of several CYP enzymes, although mechanism-based (suicide) irreversible inhibition has also been identified for cimetidine&#x27;s inhibition of CYP2D6. It reversibly inhibits CYP enzymes by binding directly with the complexed heme-iron of the active site via one of its imidazole ring nitrogen atoms, thereby blocking the oxidation of other drugs.

====Antiandrogenic and estrogenic effects====
Cimetidine has been found to possess weak antiandrogenic activity at high doses. It directly and competitively antagonizes the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). However, the affinity of cimetidine for the AR is very weak; in one study, it showed only 0.00084% of the affinity of the anabolic steroid metribolone (100%) for the human AR (Ki = 140 μM and 1.18 nM, respectively). In any case, at sufficiently high doses, cimetidine has demonstrated weak but significant antiandrogenic effects in animals, including antiandrogenic effects in the rat ventral prostate and mouse kidney, reductions in the weights of the male accessory glands like the prostate gland and seminal vesicles in rats, and elevated gonadotropin levels in male rats (due to reduced negative feedback on the axis by androgens). In addition to AR antagonism, cimetidine has been found to inhibit the 2-hydroxylation of estradiol (via inhibition of CYP450 enzymes, which are involved in the metabolic inactivation of estradiol), resulting in increased estrogen levels. The medication has also been reported to reduce testosterone biosynthesis and increase prolactin levels in individual case reports, effects which might be secondary to increased estrogen levels.

At typical therapeutic levels, cimetidine has either no effect on or causes small increases in circulating testosterone concentrations in men. Any increases in testosterone levels with cimetidine have been attributed to the loss of negative feedback on the HPG axis that results due to AR antagonism. At typical clinical dosages, such as those used to treat peptic ulcer disease, the incidence of gynecomastia (breast development) with cimetidine is very low at less than 1%. In one survey of over 9,000 patients taking cimetidine, gynecomastia was the most frequent endocrine-related complaint but was reported in only 0.2% of patients. At high doses however, such as those used to treat Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, there may be a higher incidence of gynecomastia with cimetidine. In one small study, a 20% incidence of gynecomastia was observed in 25 male patients with duodenal ulcers who were treated with 1,600 mg/day cimetidine. The symptoms appeared after 4 months of treatment and regressed within a month following discontinuation of cimetidine. In another small study, cimetidine was reported to have induced breast changes and erectile dysfunction in 60% of 22 men treated with it. These adverse effects completely resolved in all cases when the men were switched from cimetidine to ranitidine. A study of the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database, which contains over 80,000 men, found that the relative risk of gynecomastia in cimetidine users was 7.2 relative to non-users. People taking a dosage of cimetidine of greater than or equal to 1,000 mg showed more than 40 times the risk of gynecomastia than non-users. The risk was highest during the period of time of 7 to 12 months after starting cimetidine. The gynecomastia associated with cimetidine is thought to be due to blockade of ARs in the breasts, which results in estrogen action unopposed by androgens in this tissue, although increased levels of estrogens due to inhibition of estrogen metabolism is another possible mechanism. Cimetidine has also been associated with oligospermia (decreased sperm count) and sexual dysfunction (e.g., decreased libido, erectile dysfunction) in men in some research, which are hormonally related similarly.

In accordance with the very weak nature of its AR antagonistic activity, cimetidine has shown minimal effectiveness in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions such as acne, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), and hyperandrogenism (high androgen levels) in women. As such, its use for such indications is not recommended.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Cimetidine is rapidly absorbed regardless of route of administration. The oral bioavailability of cimetidine is 60 to 70%. The onset of action of cimetidine when taken orally is 30 minutes, and peak levels occur within 1 to 3 hours. Cimetidine is widely distributed throughout all tissues. It is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and can produce effects in the central nervous system (e.g., headaches, dizziness, somnolence). The volume of distribution of cimetidine is 0.8 L/kg in adults and 1.2 to 2.1 L/kg in children. Its plasma protein binding is 13 to 25% and is said to be without pharmacological significance. Cimetidine undergoes relatively little metabolism, with 56 to 85% excreted unchanged. It is metabolized in the liver into cimetidine sulfoxide, hydroxycimetidine, and guanyl urea cimetidine. The major metabolite of cimetidine is the sulfoxide, which accounts for about 30% of excreted material. Cimetidine is rapidly eliminated, with an elimination half-life of 123 minutes, or about 2 hours. It has been said to have a duration of action of 4 to 8 hours. The medication is mainly eliminated in urine.

==History==
Cimetidine, approved by the FDA for inhibition of gastric acid secretion, has been advocated for a number of dermatological diseases. Cimetidine was the prototypical histamine H2 receptor antagonist from which the later members of the class were developed. Cimetidine was the culmination of a project at Smith, Kline and French (SK&amp;F) Laboratories in Welwyn Garden City (now part of GlaxoSmithKline) by James W. Black, C. Robin Ganellin, and others to develop a histamine receptor antagonist to suppress stomach acid secretion. This was one of the first drugs discovered using a rational drug design approach. Sir James W. Black shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of propranolol and also is credited for the discovery of cimetidine.

At the time (1964), histamine was known to stimulate the secretion of stomach acid, but also that traditional antihistamines had no effect on acid production. In the process, the SK&amp;F scientists also proved the existence of histamine H2 receptors.

The SK&amp;F team used a rational drug-design structure starting from the structure of histamine — the only design lead, since nothing was known of the then hypothetical H2 receptor. Hundreds of modified compounds were synthesized in an effort to develop a model of the receptor. The first breakthrough was &quot;Nα&quot;-guanylhistamine, a partial H2 receptor antagonist. From this lead, the receptor model was further refined and eventually led to the development of burimamide, the first H2 receptor antagonist. Burimamide, a specific competitive antagonist at the H2 receptor, 100 times more potent than &quot;Nα&quot;-guanylhistamine, proved the existence of the H2 receptor.

Burimamide was still insufficiently potent for oral administration, and further modification of the structure, based on modifying the pKa of the compound, led to the development of metiamide. Metiamide was an effective agent; it was associated, however, with unacceptable nephrotoxicity and agranulocytosis. The toxicity was proposed to arise from the thiourea group, and similar guanidine analogues were investigated until the ultimate discovery of cimetidine. The compound was synthesized in 1972 and evaluated for toxicology by 1973. It passed all trials.

Cimetidine was first marketed in the United Kingdom in 1976, and in the U.S. in August 1977; therefore, it took 12 years from initiation of the H2 receptor antagonist program to commercialization. By 1979, Tagamet was being sold in more than 100 countries and became the top-selling prescription product in the U.S., Canada, and several other countries. In November 1997, the American Chemical Society and the Royal Society of Chemistry in the U.K. jointly recognized the work as a milestone in drug discovery by designating it an International Historic Chemical Landmark during a ceremony at SmithKline Beecham&#x27;s New Frontiers Science Park research facilities in Harlow, England.

The commercial name &quot;Tagamet&quot; was decided upon by fusing the two words &quot;antagonist&quot; and &quot;cimetidine&quot;. Subsequent to the introduction onto the U.S. drug market, two other H2 receptor antagonists were approved, ranitidine (Zantac, Glaxo Labs) and famotidine (Pepcid, Yamanouchi, Ltd.) Cimetidine became the first drug ever to reach more than $1 billion a year in sales, thus making it the first blockbuster drug.

Tagamet has been largely replaced by proton pump inhibitors for treating peptic ulcers, but is available as an over-the-counter medicine for heartburn in many countries.

== Research ==
Some evidence suggests cimetidine could be effective in the treatment of common warts, but more rigorous double-blind clinical trials found it to be no more effective than a placebo.

Tentative evidence supports a beneficial role as add-on therapy in colorectal cancer.

Cimetidine inhibits ALA synthase activity and hence may have some therapeutic value in preventing and treating acute porphyria attacks.

There is some evidence supporting the use of Cimetidine in the treatment of PFAPA.

== Veterinary use ==
In dogs, cimetidine is used as an antiemetic when treating chronic gastritis.

<text>Jerzy Konorski (1 December 1903 in Łódź, Congress Poland – 14 November 1973 in Warsaw, Poland) was a Polish neurophysiologist who further developed the work of Ivan Pavlov by discovering secondary conditioned reflexes and operant conditioning. He also proposed the idea of gnostic neurons, a concept similar to the grandmother cell. He coined the term neural plasticity, and he developed theoretical ideas regarding it that are similar to those proposed soon after by Donald Hebb.

==Secondary conditioned reflexes==
When he and Stefan Miller were medical students in Warsaw they proposed another type of conditioned reflex in addition to that discovered by Pavlov which was under the control of reward. This has come to be known as &quot;type II conditioned reflexes,&quot; or secondary conditioned reflexes Type II conditioned reflexes are now known as operant or instrumental conditioning.

He spent two years at Pavlov&#x27;s laboratory as the result of a letter that he sent to Pavlov describing this work. Pavlov however was never convinced that instrumental conditioning (which Konorski called &quot;Type II&quot; to distinguish it from Pavlov&#x27;s &quot;Type I&quot; learning) differed in any important way from his own Type I conditioning.

An exchange between B. F. Skinner and Konorski also occurred over the two types of learning. Skinner had originally referred to operant conditioning as Type I and Pavlovian conditioning as Type II. Konorski agreed to revise his nomenclature to avoid confusion.

==Neural plasticity==
Konorski married the neurophysiologist Liliana Lubinska, who obtained her doctorate with Louis Lapicque. Konorski, Lubinska, and Miller established a laboratory at the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology. With Konorski&#x27;s knowledge of neurophysiology greatly expanded through his collaboration with Lubinska, he turned his attention to the neural mechanisms that underlie conditioning.

Konorski asked how pre-existing connections between neurons in the brain could be changed by conditioning. He suggested an idea similar to Hebb in which coincidental activation in time causes the potential connections to be transformed into actual excitatory connections. Inhibitory connections arise when the excitation of one input coincides in time with a decease in its associated connection. He described the process: &quot;The plastic changes would be related to the formation and multiplication of new synaptic junctions between the axon terminals of one nerve cell and the soma (i.e. the body and the dendrites) of the other&quot; This idea that synapses strengthen with use was also proposed in the West in the theory of Hebbian synapses by Donald Hebb.

==Grandmother cells==
Konorski first proposed two key concepts in neuroscience (independently of Western scientists who also suggested them). The grandmother cell of the West which Konorski called &quot;gnostic unit.&quot; This was developed in great detail in his 1967 book.

==Publications==
He was the author of two important books on learning, &quot;Conditioned Reflexes and Neuron Organization&quot; (1948), and &quot;Integrative Activity of the Brain&quot; (1967). The first book, presented one of the first theories of associative learning as a result of long-term neuronal plasticity. In the second, he substantially revised his early theories and synthesised work on associative learning and neurobiology of perception and motivation.

==World War II and Stalin==

The Department of Neurophysiology at the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology in Warsaw, Poland was created for him but this was destroyed in the first days of the invasion of Poland in 1939. He failed to get to England to join his brother who lived there. Konorski managed to escape to the Soviet Union where he was appointed the head of the primate laboratory at Sukhumi on the Black Sea in Georgia. Due to German invasion of the Soviet Union, the laboratory was relocated to Tbilisi. He spent much of World War II at Sukhumi treating traumatic injuries of the central nervous system. After the war he returned to Nencki Institute as head of the Department of Neurophysiology. In 1948 Cambridge University Press published his &quot;Conditioned reflexes and neuron organization&quot;. Then in 1949, during the peak of Stalinism, at a conference in Leningrad commemorating the 100th anniversary of Pavlov&#x27;s birth, his book was condemned and rejected. In 1951, at a conference organized in Krynica in support of him, this was shown in a 40-minute period of continuous clapping and applause. With Stalin&#x27;s death his prosecution ended.

==Legacy==
Later Konorski became a foreign member of the National Academy of Sciences. Since his death his influence has grown considerably and now recognized as the first to systematically investigate the mechanisms underlying instrumental conditioning. Many consider him among the most important of theoretical neurobiologists.

<text>Project PACER, carried out at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in the mid-1970s, explored the possibility of a fusion power system that would involve exploding small hydrogen bombs (fusion bombs)—or, as stated in a later proposal, fission bombs—inside an underground cavity. Its proponents claimed that the system is the only fusion power system that could be demonstrated to work using existing technology. It would also require a continuous supply of nuclear explosives and contemporary economics studies demonstrated that these could not be produced at a competitive price compared to conventional energy sources.

== Development ==
The earliest references to the use of nuclear explosions for power generation date to a meeting called by Edward Teller in 1957. Among the many topics covered, the group considered power generation by exploding 1-megaton bombs in a diameter steam-filled cavity dug in granite. This led to the realization that the fissile material from the fission sections of the bombs, the &quot;primaries&quot;, would accumulate in the chamber. Even at this early stage, physicist John Nuckolls became interested in designs of very small bombs, and ones with no fission primary at all. This work would later lead to his development of the inertial fusion energy concept.

The initial PACER proposals were studied under the larger Project Plowshares efforts in the United States, which examined the use of nuclear explosions in place of chemical ones for construction. Examples included the possibility of using large nuclear devices to create an artificial harbour for mooring ships in the north, or as a sort of nuclear fracking to improve natural gas yields. Another proposal would create an alternative to the Panama Canal in a single sequence of detonations, crossing a Central American nation. One of these tests, 1961&#x27;s Project Gnome, also considered the generation of steam for possible extraction as a power source. LANL proposed PACER as an adjunct to these studies.

Early examples considered diameter water-filled caverns created in salt domes at as much as deep. A series of 50-kiloton bombs would be dropped into the cavern and exploded to heat the water and create steam. The steam would then power a secondary cooling loop for power extraction using a steam turbine. Dropping about two bombs a day would cause the system to reach thermal equilibrium, allowing the continual extraction of about 2 GW of electrical power. There was also some consideration given to adding thorium or other material to the bombs to breed fuel for conventional fission reactors.

In a 1975 review of the various Plowshares efforts, the Gulf University Research Consortium (GURC) considered the economics of the PACER concept. They demonstrated that assuming a cost of $42 000 for the 50kT nuclear explosives would be the equivalent of fuelling a conventional light-water reactor with uranium fuel at a price of $27 per pound for yellowcake. If the cost of the explosives would be $400 000 it would be equivalent to a pressurized water reactor with an equivalent price of $328 per ton of uranium. The price for 1 ton of yellowcake was around $45 in 2012. The report also noted the problems with any program that generated large numbers of nuclear bombs, saying it was &quot;bound to be controversial&quot; and that it would &quot;arouse considerable negative responses&quot;. GURC concluded that the likelihood of PACER being developed was very low, even if the formidable technical issues could be solved. In 1975 further funding for PACER research was cancelled.

Despite the cancellation of this early work, basic studies of the concept have continued. A more developed version considered the use of engineered vessels in place of the large open cavities. A typical design called for a thick steel alloy blast-chamber, in diameter and tall, to be embedded in a cavity dug into bedrock in Nevada. Hundreds of long bolts were to be driven into the surrounding rock to support the cavity. The space between the blast-chamber and the rock cavity walls was to be filled with concrete; then the bolts were to be put under enormous tension to pre-stress the rock, concrete, and blast-chamber. The blast-chamber was then to be partially filled with molten fluoride salts to a depth of , a &quot;waterfall&quot; would be initiated by pumping the salt to the top of the chamber and letting it fall to the bottom. While surrounded by this falling coolant, a 1-kiloton fission bomb would be detonated; this would be repeated every 45 minutes. The fluid would also absorb neutrons to avoid damage to the walls of the cavity.

<text>The Ader Éole, also called Avion (French for &quot;aeroplane&quot;), was an early steam-powered aircraft developed by Clément Ader in the 1890s and named after the Greco-Roman wind god Aeolus.

==Design and development==
Unlike many early flying machines, the Éole did not attempt to fly by flapping its wings, but relied on the lift generated by its wings in forward motion. With wings resembling mechanical copies of bat wings, its steam engine was an unusually light-weight design driving a propeller at the front of the aircraft, but lacking any means for the pilot to control the direction of flight.

According to late 1907 claims made by Clément Ader, on October 9th, 1890, the machine achieved a short flight of around 50 m (164 ft) at the Chateau d&#x27;Armainvilliers in Brie. It reached a height of around 20 cm (8 in). The poor power-to-weight ratio of the steam engine and bad weather were felt to limit the flying height achieved. Ader later claimed to have flown the Éole again in September 1891, this time to a distance of 100 m (328 ft), but this claim is less substantiated.

Some consider the &quot;Éole&quot; to have been the first true aeroplane, given that it left the ground under its own power and carried a person through the air for a short distance, and that the event of 8 October 1890 was the first successful flight. However, the lack of directional control, and the fact that steam-powered aircraft proved to be a dead end, both weigh against these claims. Ader&#x27;s proponents have claimed that the Wrights&#x27; early airplanes required a catapult to take off; however, the Wrights did not use a catapult for their first flights in 1903, though they did for many flights in 1904 and later.

Modern attempts to recreate and evaluate the craft have met with mixed results. A full-size replica built in 1990 at the &quot;École Centrale Paris&quot; crashed on its first flight, injuring its pilot and leading to the termination of the experiment. Scale models, however, have been successfully flown.

<text>MX Prime previously Maximus Dan (born as Edghill Thomas on 1979 in Carenage, Trinidad and Tobago) is a Trinidadian soca / dancehall musician. He is also known by his former stage name &quot;Maga Dan&quot;.

After working with Jamaican producer Danny Browne between 1997 and 2000, and releasing dancehall and reggae influenced music, Maximus Dan moved in the direction of soca and has developed his own style. His biggest hit single to date was &quot;Fighter&quot;, which was made for the Soca Warriors (the Trinidad and Tobago national football team) in 2006. &quot;Fighter&quot; became the rallying song for the first ever appearance by Trinidad and Tobago in the FIFA World Cup finals in Germany.

His song &quot;Love Generation&quot; is featured on the &quot;Cricket 07&quot; game by EA Sports for the PC and PlayStation.

==History==
Born and raised in the fishing village of Carenage on Trinidad&#x27;s west coast, Edghill Thomas, was at first Magadan. He made a name for himself with a few local hits and was eager to collaborate with more established artistes. Although he was more than capable of standing on his own, he was prepared to learn how to survive in the music industry by walking with those who travelled the road before him.

He says of the time: “It wasn’t just a name change but a realisation of what I wanted to be, a leader not a follower. I wanted to bring a different element to the soca industry. It was so normal to sing a party song, festival tune, or road march contender, simply seeking a limited goal of touring after carnival (and settling for that). I wanted to stand out. I wanted to teach. I wanted people to listen – not just follow instructions, like put yuh hand in the air.”

He signed with Main Street Records in 1997, becoming one of the first artists out of Trinidad to work with a major Jamaican label. Under the supervision of producer Danny Browne, he was a featured artiste on the single Do you see what I see on the filthy rhythm with label mates Red Rat, Hawkeye, Goofy, General Degree and others. The rhythm sold well globally.

In 2000, when Magadan became Maximus Dan, he had a string of hits with his own style of soca music. Using his unmistakable voice to deliver conscious messages over driving blends of soca and dancehall music.

Obeah Man, Lash Satan, War, Kick It Way, Soca Train, Hosanna Fire, Earthquake, Order … are just a few of the offerings he has stamped on the national consciousness.

“I was always a man who liked to share knowledge. I grew up around people like that, so I felt being in that environment I wanted to bring that into my music and into the soca arena. It was hard in the beginning ‘cause everybody felt like I was preachin’ in the party,” says Maximus.

“I was always my own worst critic so I would sit down before I format a song and study what are the things to appeal to people … beats, pulse, the instruments and the cords … if you catch them with the music that’s how you draw them in. I make sure the beats are so infectious the words follow automatically.”

“I am still trying to find the perfect formula, there is always room for improvement and growth. When people listen they actually learn, and a good listener is a good learner. It’s all well and good to have a good time but you will have in the back of your mind at least one entertainer gave a message… empowerment, positivity.”

“Stevie Wonder, Sam Cooke, Ras Shorty, Bob Marley; they focused on the betterment and education of mankind that was the prime purpose of the music, for you to get the music and for you to live it out at the same time. We artistes are human beings too and we have so much power with the microphone in our hands, but when we come off that stage we go back to normal life and it’s about practicing what you are preaching as well … you need to live what you teach … I try to be the best I can be every single day.”

When the news came that Trinidad and Tobago’s national football team had qualified for the FIFA 2006 World Cup the streets erupted in spontaneous euphoria. The song on everyone’s lips, some with tears streaming down their faces was Soca Warrior by Maximus Dan.

It was a gift to the nation from a true patriot, an artist who has always used his pen to awaken our social consciousness.

The song was written in 2005 at a time when the team needed to feel lifted.

Maximus says: “I wanted to have a song to sing to infinity … til God come. I didn’t want it to just be a football song.”

This is his approach to all things, and what characterizes him as a messenger of the people.

<doc id="1018123" wikidata="Q1906053" url="?curid=1018123" title="Marvin Davis">
<text>Marvin H. Davis (August 31, 1925 – September 25, 2004) was an American industrialist. He made his fortunes as the chair of Davis Petroleum and at one time owned 20th Century Fox, the Pebble Beach Corporation, the Beverly Hills Hotel, and the Aspen Skiing Company.

==Early life and education==
Marvin Davis was raised in a Jewish family, the son of Jack Davis and Jean Spitzer. He had one younger sister, Joan (born 1929).

His father came to the United States from London as a teenager in 1917 and later joined the British Navy after reportedly applying for a college scholarship but being denied it because he was Jewish. Jack Davis became a successful fashion buyer for New York department stores. He went on to found Jay Day Dress Co., a well-priced line of women&#x27;s dresses that achieved great success, selling 200,000 dresses per-month to stores across the nation. In 1939 he partnered with Ray Ryan, who owned the Ryan Oil Company, and they started the Davis Oil Company.

Marvin graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from New York University in 1947.

==Petroleum business==

He joined his father in the oil exploration business and was later nicknamed &quot;Mr. Wildcatter.&quot; The Davis Oil Company drilled for oil and gas in the West beginning in the 1940s and was incorporated in 1986 as Davis Petroleum, headquartered in Denver, Colorado. In 1960s–1980s, it became a leading independent oil and gas producer in the United States, focusing on drilling in Wyoming, where the company owned a 150-mile pipeline.

Marvin Davis&#x27;s son Gregg Davis took over as president of Davis Petroleum and Davis Offshore in 1997.

Davis senior&#x27;s partner Ray Ryan was a pioneer of the oil deal known as the &quot;third for a quarter,&quot; where investors in a wildcat oil well would each buy one-quarter of the well&#x27;s production for a third of the cost of drilling the well, leaving all costs paid and Davis and Ryan owners of one-quarter of the well.

Marvin Davis developed the oil business, and also became a major real estate developer in Denver, acquiring a shopping center and office complex.

Davis offered to purchase the Oakland Athletics from Charlie Finley for $12 million on December 12, 1977, with the intention of moving the franchise to Denver. The Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Authority filed a lawsuit to block the sale because Finley had ten years remaining on a lease that began with the transfer of the ballclub&#x27;s operations from Kansas City for the 1968 season. Davis ended negotiations on January 23, 1978, and the Athletics remained in Oakland under Finley&#x27;s continued ownership.

In 1981, Davis sold most of his oil holdings for $600 million to the Canadian company Hiram Walker-Consumers Home, Ltd. The United States Justice Department accused one of his Davis&#x27; companies of violating federal oil-pricing policies. The case was settled in 1981, with Davis paying a $20,000 fine. Business partners accused him in civil lawsuits of inflating the results of his oil wells.

==20th Century Fox and later career==
In 1981, Davis acquired 20th Century Fox for $722 million with financier Marc Rich. Fox&#x27;s assets included Pebble Beach Golf Links, the Aspen Skiing Company, and a Century City property upon which he built and twice sold Fox Plaza, which was made famous as &quot;Nakatomi Plaza&quot; in the 1988 action film &quot;Die Hard&quot;. While Davis was head of 20th Century Fox, President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, complained to him about excessive sexuality in films. Reagan suggested to Davis that he produce films that implied, rather than showed, sex, in the style of director Ernst Lubitsch. In 1984 Davis appointed Barry Diller, formerly chairman and chief executive officer of Paramount Pictures, to the chairman and CEO role at 20th Century Fox. Diller asked Davis for complete control, with Davis promising to provide financing for the studio. Fox&#x27;s financial situation was precarious, with the company owing $600 million. Banks would not provide any extension to the loan, and Diller pressed Davis for the new equity he had promised to put into Fox. Diller claims that Davis stalled and suggested that Diller call Michael Milken for a $250 million junk-bond loan, which would have been Diller&#x27;s, not Davis&#x27;, responsibility.

By 1985, Rich was in Switzerland during an indictment that was filed against him by the United States due to his violation of sanctions against his commodity trades with Iran. Marc Rich had arranged with Davis for Davis to buy out his interest in 20th Century Fox for $116 million. Davis sold this interest to Rupert Murdoch for $250 million in March 1984. Davis later backed out of a deal with Murdoch to purchase John Kluge&#x27;s Metromedia television stations, which would form what is now the Fox network. Murdoch went alone and bought the studios, and later bought out Davis remaining stake in 20th Century Fox for $325 million. Davis sold Pebble Beach to Japanese businessman Minoru Isutani for $841 million in 1990. Winning a bidding war against the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, Davis bought the Beverly Hills Hotel for $135 million in 1986. Davis later sold the hotel to the sultan for a $65 million profit.

In 1999, Davis attempted to build a stadium in Los Angeles to lure the National Football League to award the city an expansion franchise during a 20-year span (1995-2015) when the NFL was absent from Los Angeles. The expansion team ultimately went to Houston and became the Houston Texans, who began play in 2002.

In later years, Davis was linked to takeover targets including Northwest Airlines, US Airways, CBS, NBC and T. Boone Pickens&#x27; Mesa. A proponent of greenmail, the threatening of takeover bids that never come to pass, Davis said &quot;All you have to do is look at the pretty girl and everyone thinks you&#x27;re sleeping with her. You don&#x27;t have to put up any money&quot;. In 2002 a deal that was structured by Ramy El-Batrawi, Davis made an unsolicited $15 billion bid for the entertainment assets of Vivendi.

The Denver Broncos National Football League team was targeted by failed takeover bids from Davis.

==Philanthropy and political donations==
Davis was a long-time philanthropist, especially for medical research. A research building at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles is named for him. The Davis&#x27;s daughter Dana is a diabetic, and they founded the Children&#x27;s Diabetes Foundation which hosts the biannual Carousel of Hope ball to raise money for juvenile diabetes. 
Davis and his wife were for many years major donors and fundraisers for the Democratic Party. When President Bill Clinton failed to appear personally at the Carousel of Hope ball and instead sent a videotaped message, Barbara Davis told a reporter: &quot;There are 25 people in our family...I told the White House person, &quot;You are now talking to 25 new Republicans&quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==
Marvin Davis was married for 53 years to Barbara Levine. They had five children and as of November 2005, fourteen grandchildren: 
*Dana Davis, a Type 1 diabetic, is an active philanthropist with a focus on diabetes. She began her career as an elementary school teacher but was forced to retire due to diabetes-related foot problems which required eight separate surgeries. Unhappy with the stylishly poor selection of shoes available for people with foot problems, she developed her own line of footwear, Dana Davis Shoes, which meshed the required comfort levels with high fashion. She is now the executive director of the Children&#x27;s Diabetes Foundation. 
*Gregg Davis was the President of Davis Petroleum Corp., Davis Petroleum Pipeline, and Davis Offshore, the family&#x27;s former oil and gas companies. He is the former husband of American actress Kim Richards. Davis and Richards had two children together: daughter Whitney and son Chad. 
*Patricia Ann Davis Raynes married New York real estate developer Martin Raynes in a Jewish ceremony in 1983. In 2005, Patricia sued her mother and four siblings alleging that they &quot;looted&quot; a trust fund set up by her paternal grandfather, Jack, who created the original Davis Oil Co. that was the foundation of the family&#x27;s wealth. 
*John Davis (born 1954) is an American film producer and the founder of Davis Entertainment. 
*Nancy Davis Rickel, diagnosed with Multiple sclerosis, is an active supporter of charities dedicated to its cure. She has been married twice. Her first husband was Turkish American wine grower, Nebil Zarif. They had three children: Brandon Davis, Alexander Davis and actor Jason Davis. Her second husband is entrepreneur Ken Rickel. They have twin daughters: Isabella and Mariella. She is also the godmother of Nicole Richie.

Friend Aaron Spelling loosely based the Carrington family of his TV series &quot;Dynasty&quot; on the Davises, even filming an episode at their Colorado home.

In 1984, the Davises purchased &quot;The Knoll&quot;, a 45,000-square-foot house in Beverly Hills from Kenny Rogers, where they hosted lavish Christmas parties.

In 1993, Davis and his wife were robbed of $10 million of jewels and $50,000 cash by masked gunmen while on holiday in the south of France.

Davis was identified with his towering stature, measuring tall. He was known for his large appetite, with Fox executive Alan Hirschfield saying that Davis &quot;was the poster boy for everything you shouldn&#x27;t eat&quot;; he weighed over for much of his adult life, though he lost about as his health failed in his final years.

==Death and aftermath==
In Davis&#x27;s last decade, he experienced a series of ailments, including diabetes, heart disease, a spinal tumor, pneumonia, and sepsis, and he died at The Knoll on September 25, 2004, at the age of 79. He was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

===Family disputes over estate===
Davis&#x27; eldest daughter, Patricia Davis Raynes, sued her four siblings, her mother, and several of the family&#x27;s advisers, alleging that they had all helped her father to systematically steal her trust fund before his death. Her lawsuit alleged that Marvin had entrapped and beaten Patricia in an attempt to get her to sign documents giving him control over her finances. Patricia Davis later settled with all 14 parties named in her complaint, and the case was closed in January 2008. By the conclusion of Patricia Davis&#x27; case, sister Nancy Davis had taken her brother Gregg to court over the sale of Davis Petroleum, in March 2006.

Nancy Davis alleged that her brother and his partners vastly undervalued the company and thereby denied her (and her mother and siblings) of as much as $50 million in proceeds. Lawyers for Gregg Davis deny the allegations. The Texas bankruptcy court that had originally approved the deal to sell Davis Petroleum ruled in favor of Gregg and his partners, then a district-court judge dismissed Nancy&#x27;s appeal. As of 2009 the case had bounced back to the bankruptcy court.

<text>Stanisław Kostanecki (born 16 April 1860 in Myszaków, now in Poland then Kingdom of Prussia – 15 November 1910 in Würzburg) was a Polish organic chemist, professor who pioneered in vegetable dye chemistry e.g. curcumin. He is best known for discovering Kostanecki acylation, which was named after him.

In 1896, he developed the theory of dyes and studied the natural vegetable dyes. Among his many students were scientists Kazimierz Funk and Wiktor Lampe.

<text>Sneaker was a West Coast American rock band, active from 1973 to 1983. The band is best known for its &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Top 40 hit single, &quot;More Than Just the Two of Us&quot;, from its first album, &quot;Sneaker&quot; (1981). They also had a minor hit with &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me In&quot;, a song written by Donald Fagen and Walter Becker from Steely Dan.

Sneaker was composed of Tim Torrance on guitars, Mitch Crane on vocals and guitars, Michael Carey Schneider on vocals and keyboards, Mike Hughes on drums, Michael Cottage on bass guitar, and Jim King on keyboards, synthesizers, and vibes. The band cited as its primary musical influences Steely Dan, Eagles and The Doobie Brothers. They released two studio albums on Handshake Records and Tapes: &quot;Sneaker&quot; in 1981 (which included their Top 40 hit, &quot;More Than Just the Two of Us&quot;) and &quot;Loose in the World&quot; in 1982. Both albums were produced by Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter. In 2001, Cool Sound Records, a Japanese record label, released &quot;Early On&quot;, a collection of their early recordings and, in 2003, released &quot;Footprints In Japan&quot;, a 1982 live recording from Osaka &amp; Tokyo, Japan.

The group&#x27;s name &quot;Sneaker&quot; was taken from the Steely Dan song &quot;Bad Sneakers&quot; from their album &quot;Katy Lied&quot;, a fact confirmed by Michael Carey Schneider.

<doc id="1018143" wikidata="Q986397" url="?curid=1018143" title="Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens">
<text>Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens, PC (1 March 1753 – 19 February 1839) was a British diplomat. He was Minister Plenipotentiary to Russia from 1783 to 1788, appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland and a member of the Privy Council (Great Britain &amp; Ireland) in 1787, serving in the former position until 1789. He was Minister plenipotentiary to Spain from 1790 to 1794.

He was a friend of explorer George Vancouver, who named Mount St. Helens in what is now the U.S. state of Washington after him.

==Life==
Alleyne was fifth and youngest son of William Fitzherbert of Tissington in Derbyshire, who married Mary, eldest daughter of Littleton Poyntz Meynell of Bradley, near Ashbourne. His father, who was Member for the Borough of Derby and a Commissioner of the Board of Trade, committed suicide on 2 January 1772 due to pecuniary trouble. He was numbered among the friends of Dr. Johnson, who bore witness to his felicity of manner
and his general popularity, but depreciated the extent of his learning. Of his mother the same authority is reported to have said that she had &#x27;the best understanding he ever met with in any human being.&#x27; Alleyne, who inherited his baptismal name from his maternal grandmother, Judith, daughter of Thomas Alleyne of Barbados, was born in 1753. FitzHerbert was educated at Derby School (1763–1766), Eton College (1766–70) and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (1770–1774). His elder brother, also William inherited the family seat and became a baronet.

==Cambridge==
In July 1770 he matriculated as pensioner at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, his private tutor being the Rev. William Arnald, and in the following October Thomas Gray wrote to Mason that &quot;the little Fitzherbert is come as pensioner to St. John&#x27;s, and seems to have all his wits about him.&quot;

Gray, attended by several of his friends, paid a visit to the young undergraduate in his college rooms, and as the poet rarely went outside his own college, his presence attracted great attention, and the details of the interview were afterwards communicated to Samuel Rogers, and printed by Mitford. Fitzherbert took his degree of B. A. in 1774, being second of the senior optimes in the mathematical tripos, and was also the senior chancellor&#x27;s medallist. Soon afterwards he went on a tour through France and Italy.

==Diplomat==
In February 1777 he began a long course of foreign life with the appointment of minister at Brussels, and this necessitated his taking the degree of M.A. in that year by proxy. He remained at Brussels until August 1782, when he was despatched to Paris by Lord Shelburne as plenipotentiary to negotiate a peace with the crowns of France and Spain, and with the States General of the United Provinces; and on 20 January 1783 the preliminaries of peace with the first two powers were duly signed. The peace with the American colonies, which was agreed to at about the same date, was not brought to a conclusion under Fitzherbert&#x27;s charge, but he claimed to have taken a leading share in the previous negotiations which rendered it possible. This successful diplomacy led to his promotion in the summer of 1783 to the post of envoy extraordinary to the Empress Catherine of Russia, and he accompanied her in her tour round the Crimea in 1787.

==Spain==
When differences broke out between Great Britain and Spain respecting the right of British subjects to trade at Nootka Sound and to carry on the southern whale fishery, he was despatched to Madrid (May 1791) as ambassador extraordinary, and under his care all disputes were settled in the succeeding October, for which services he was raised to the Irish peerage with the title of Baron St. Helens.
In the following year, Commander George Vancouver and the officers of HMS &quot;Discovery&quot; made the Europeans&#x27; first recorded sighting of Mount St. Helens on 19 May 1792, while surveying the northern Pacific Ocean coast. Vancouver named the mountain after the newly created Baron on 20 October 1792,
as it came into view when the &quot;Discovery&quot; passed into the mouth of the Columbia River.

A treaty of alliance between Great Britain and Spain was concluded by him in 1793, but as the climate of that country did not agree with his health he returned home early in 1794. Very shortly after his landing in England, St. Helens was appointed to the ambassadorship at the Hague (25 March 1794), where he remained until the French conquered the country, when the danger of his situation caused much anxiety to his friends.

A year or two later a great misfortune happened to him. On 16 July 1797 his house, containing everything he possessed, was burnt to the ground, and he himself narrowly escaped a premature death. He has lost, &#x27;wrote Lord Minto, &quot;every scrap of paper he ever had. Conceive how inconsolable that loss must be to one who has lived his life. All his books, many fine pictures, prints and drawings in great abundance, are all gone.&quot;

==Russia==
His last foreign mission was to St. Petersburg in April 1801 to congratulate the Emperor Alexander I of Russia on his accession to the throne, and to arrange a treaty between England and Russia. The terms of the agreement were quickly settled, and on its completion he was promoted to the peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron St. Helen&#x27;s, in the Isle of Wight and County of Southampton. In the next September he attended the coronation of Alexander in Moscow, and arranged a convention with the Danish plenipotentiary, which was followed in March 1802 by a similar settlement with Sweden.

==Retirement==
This completed his services abroad, and on 5 April 1803 he retired from diplomatic life with a pension of £2,300 a year. When Addington was forced to resign the premiership, St. Helens, who was much attached to George III, and was admitted to more intimate friendship with that king and his wife than any other of the courtiers, was created a lord of the bedchamber (May 1804), and the appointment is said to have been made against Pitt&#x27;s wishes. He declared that he could not live out of London, and he therefore dwelt in Grafton Street all the year round. Although he repurchased Somersal Herbert Hall, an old family property, in 1806, he lent it for life to a cousin, the novelist Frances Jacson and her sister. His consummate prudence and his quiet, polished manners are the theme of Nathaniel Wraxall&#x27;s praise. Rogers and Jeremy Bentham were included in the list of his friends.

To Rogers he presented in his last illness Pope&#x27;s own copy of &quot;Garth&#x27;s Dispensary&quot;, with Pope&#x27;s manuscript annotations. Bentham had been presented to St. Helens by his elder brother, sometime member for Derbyshire, and many letters to and from him on subjects of political interest are in Bentham&#x27;s works. Two letters from him to Croker on Wraxall&#x27;s anecdotes are in the &quot;&#x27;Croker Papers&quot; (ii. 294–7), and a letter to him from the first Lord Malmesbury is printed in the latter&#x27;s diaries. St. Helens died in Grafton Street, London, on 19 February 1839, and was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery on 26 February. As he was never married, the title became extinct, and his property passed to his nephew, Sir Henry Fitzherbert. From 1805 to 1837 he had been a trustee of the British Museum, and at the time of his death he was the senior member of the privy council.

==Personal life==
St. Helens never married nor had children. However, he was known to have a very close relationship with Princess Elizabeth, third daughter of George III. Seventeen years older than Elizabeth, St. Helens was a frank, practical, and sharp-witted character known to dislike court life, qualities which Elizabeth shared. She referred to him as, &quot;a dear and valuable saint,&quot; and said of him in a letter to her companion Lady Harcourt, &quot;There is no man I love so well, and his tenderness to me has never varied, and that is a thing I never forget.&quot; Elizabeth later wrote that she pined for St. Helens, eager to see him, &quot;at all times, hours, minutes, days, nights, etc.&quot; Elizabeth later commissioned a portrait of St. Helens from noted enamelist Henry Pierce Bone, evidence of her great attachment to him. St. Helens in turn kept an enamel miniature of Elizabeth, also painted by Bone.

<text>WMAX-FM (96.1 MHz) is the callsign of a radio station owned by iHeartMedia located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The studios and offices are located at 77 Monroe Center in Downtown Grand Rapids while its transmitter is located near Felch St and 32nd Ave south of the town of Hudsonville outside of Grand Rapids.

The station is identified as &quot;96.1 The Game&quot; and carries both locally produced play by play sportscasts and sports talk programs, as well as programming from the Fox Sports Radio network.

WMAX-FM is licensed for HD Radio operations and features a simulcast of talk sister station WTKG on its HD2 side channel.

==History==
The frequency originally belonged to WHTC-FM, which went on the air in 1961, with an antenna on the WHTC tower in downtown Holland, Michigan. During this time (from the station&#x27;s inception until the early 1980s), the station was generally being used as a simulcast to WHTC.

In 1981, Michael Walton, of Milwaukee Wisconsin, purchased WHTC and WHTC-FM. By 1983, 96.1 became known as WYXX, with a new tower. After Walton assumed full control of the station, it became a fully automated CHR station, with programming provided by syndicator Century 21. The all-hit format was softened to adult contemporary by 1985, to better compete with existing stations in the Grand Rapids market.

When WOOD-FM dropped its easy listening format in 1992, WYXX adopted the format along with the call letters WKEZ.

By 1994, the station was sold to Federated Media and once Federated had control of the station, a &quot;Young Country&quot; format was adopted. The call letters became WAKX. This format was also unsuccessful; it was not able to effectively compete with WCUZ-FM 101.3/WCUZ 1230, the incumbent country juggernaut at the time. The format changed in 1995 to Hot Adult Contemporary and became known as &quot;Mix 96&quot; and later &quot;Variety 96.1.&quot;

In 1997, the station was purchased by Clear Channel Communications and the station became known as &quot;I-96&quot; (taking its name from the highway Interstate 96 passing through Grand Rapids; the station&#x27;s logo also resembled an interstate highway sign). The call letters were also changed to WVTI. The format shifted from Hot AC to CHR as &quot;Continuous Hit Music, I-96.&quot; Clear Channel took control of rival station WSNX in the late summer of 1999; much of the &quot;I-96&quot; air lineup moved over to WSNX 104.5, which shifted from CHR/Rhythmic to CHR/Pop as a result, and &quot;I-96&quot; itself shifted back to Hot AC, which it would remain for the next six years. Initially, the station had moderate success as I-96, but as other local radio stations (including sister station WOOD-FM) began putting more Hot AC-oriented acts on their Mainstream AC stations, the ratings began to slide by 2005.

On October 18, 2005, the station flipped to a Jack FM clone called &quot;MAX-FM&quot;. It gained the call sign of WMAX from another Clear Channel operation in Chattanooga, Tennessee on November 16, 2005. The station initially was programmed with over 1500 unique songs drawing from various pop music genres. As time went by, the list was honed down to less than 600 songs and the music was more focused on the 1980-early 2000s time period. After a rather respectable ratings showing, the ratings heavily slid by early 2007.

On March 19, 2007, the station retooled itself into a Modern AC-leaning Hot AC presentation, known as &quot;The NEW MAX-FM&quot;, which lasted until January 31, 2008.

On January 31, 2008, at 3 PM, after the song &quot;Closing Time&quot; by Semisonic, the station dropped the Hot AC format and began stunting with the sounds of a ticking clock interspersed with liners that were played every two or three minutes. Some of these liners were in Spanish and made reference to Regent Communications-owned WNWZ AM 1410 and cold, snow-covered cornfields in Hudsonville, Michigan, while others mentioned the time and date of 02/04/08 at 10:01 AM. Songs which served as clues to what the new format would be were played. The songs included Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;Clocks&quot;; Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Burning Love&quot;; David Allan Coe&#x27;s &quot;You Never Even Called Me By My Name&quot;, and Hall &amp; Oates&#x27; &quot;Private Eyes&quot;, among dozens of others. During the stunt, the station&#x27;s website showed a 12-second viral video clip influenced by the Cloverfield movie, with a message that pointed to the date of February 4, 2008 at 10:01 AM. A year later, WLHT-FM (owned by Regent, now Townsquare Media) would acquire the Adult Top 40 format that had been absent in Grand Rapids for more than a year.

At exactly the promised time, the ticking clock stopped, and the new format, which is known as Radio X 96.1, began. The first song on Radio X was Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. The Radio X presentation heavily centered on modern rock music from the 1990s, as well as featured selected songs from the mid-1970s through the end of the 1980s as well as current product. This type of format was also in use in several other Clear Channel operations across the country, but has been discontinued at some of the radio stations during the past several years.

On August 4, 2008, Clear Channel placed the station&#x27;s assets into an entity called the Aloha Station Trust in order to sell off the station. This was due to Clear Channel being above the ownership limits allowed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). These limits were imposed when Clear Channel was officially taken private by Bain Capital Partners on July 30, 2008. In December 2008, Clear Channel took back WMAX after Arbitron reassigned WMAX to the Muskegon market (though its signal favors Grand Rapids more than Muskegon) and its sister station, WLDI in Fort Pierce, Florida, to its new market.

Legally, 96.1 is WMAX-FM, as the WMAX calls are used at a Catholic Christian radio station (not co-owned) at 1440 AM in Bay City, Michigan. In 1922, the WMAX call sign was used by a station in Ann Arbor, Michigan. From circa 1956–1986, the WMAX calls were used by AM 1480 in Grand Rapids. WMAX was an adult contemporary music station &quot;Good MAX Music,&quot; until flipping to an all-news format in 1976. WMAX had a local news staff of 11 reporters, known as &quot;NEWSRADIO 1480,&quot; before becoming a Christian talk/Gospel Music station in 1984. WMAX was reassigned from Grand Rapids to Kentwood when a new night-time directional array was added in 1984. WMAX later became a Contemporary Christian station, before becoming silent. AM 1480 became WGVU-AM in 1992, operated by Grand Valley State University. From 1992 to 1998, the WMAX call letters were used by an alternative rock 106.7 FM station in Rochester, New York.

Starting in June 2009, Clear Channel&#x27;s Grand Rapids operations began making plans to change the format of the radio station into one carrying ESPN-provided sports programming and local/statewide play-by-play game commentary. The plan went into effect August 7, 2009, when WMAX-FM began &quot;stunting&quot; by simulcasting mainstream rock-oriented sister station WBFX. On August 17, 2009, at midnight, the stunting ended and the station switched to its current format of sports-oriented programming, with a large share of the programs originating from ESPN Radio.

The station is also a secondary affiliate of Fox Sports Radio and airs Colin Cowherd&#x27;s syndicated sports program on middays. It is also the West Michigan affiliate of the Detroit Pistons. Clear Channel Communications became iHeartMedia in 2013.

On August 30, 2021, WMAX-FM rebranded as &quot;96.1 The Game&quot;.

On October 9, 2023, WMAX-FM switched affiliation from ESPN Radio to Fox Sports Radio.

==Bronco Radio Network==
Beginning September 5, 2009 the station started broadcasting Western Michigan University Broncos football and men&#x27;s basketball games via the school&#x27;s &quot;Bronco Radio Network&quot;.
