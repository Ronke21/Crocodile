<text>A Yorkshire Tragedy is an early Jacobean era stage play, a domestic tragedy printed in 1608. The play was originally assigned to William Shakespeare, though the modern critical consensus rejects this attribution, favouring Thomas Middleton.

==Date and text==
&quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy&quot; was almost certainly written in 1605, before Walter Calverley was pressed to death: Jacobean audiences liked moral endings, especially grisly ones, but the play ends with the Husband&#x27;s fate unresolved. It was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 2 May 1608; the entry assigns the play to &quot;Wylliam Shakespere.&quot; The play was published soon after, in a quarto issued by bookseller Thomas Pavier, who had published &quot;Sir John Oldcastle,&quot; another play of the Shakespeare Apocrypha, in 1600.

The play was reprinted in 1619, as part of William Jaggard&#x27;s False Folio. It was next reprinted in 1664, when Philip Chetwinde included it among the seven plays he added to the second impression of the Shakespeare Third Folio.

==Form and genre==
The play is unusual in consisting of only ten scenes. The original printed text of the play identifies it as &quot;ALL&#x27;S ONE. OR, One of the foure Plaies in one, called a York-Shire Tragedy...&quot; This plainly implies that the existing play was one of a quartet of related works that were performed on stage together. In that respect it must have resembled &quot;Four Plays, or Moral Representations, in One,&quot; from c. 1608–13, a play in the John Fletcher canon in which Fletcher wrote the last two parts of the quartet, while another playwright, most likely Nathan Field, wrote the others. Other examples of such anthologies of short plays from the English Renaissance can also be given; see, for instance, &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins.&quot; The nature and authorship of the three lost pieces that accompanied &quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy&quot; is unknown.

Scene 1 is very different from the other scenes, being a prologue, with different characters. The rest of the play has the same content as the first half of the pamphlet &quot;&quot;, which was entered in the Stationers&#x27; Register on 12 June 1605. Whether the pamphlet plagiarized the play as performed in 1605 or the play was based on the pamphlet is unresolved.

The play&#x27;s genre is that of the domestic tragedy, a subgenre of the English Renaissance theatre focusing on the downfalls of ordinary middle-class people. One of the earliest examples is &quot;Arden of Faversham&quot;, which also belongs in the Shakespeare Apocrypha.

==Sources==
The plot of the play is based on the life of Walter Calverley of Calverley Hall, Yorkshire, who was executed on 5 August 1605 for murdering two of his children and stabbing his wife. It confounds the Walter Calverley of the murders with another Walter Calverley (probably his uncle) who matriculated at Cambridge in 1579 with his brother but who dropped out, leaving his brother to complete his degree. The crimes were a well-known scandal of the day; a pamphlet on the case was issued in June 1605, with a ballad following in July. The chronicler Edmund Howes reported the case in his continuation of Stow&#x27;s &quot;.&quot; The case was also dramatised in a play titled &quot;The Miseries of Enforced Marriage&quot; (1607), by George Wilkins. Scholars have disagreed on the relationship between Wilkins&#x27;s play and &quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy;&quot; some have seen one play as a source for the other, or even the work of the same author, while others regard the two dramas as essentially separate works.

==Authorship==
In the Stationers&#x27; Register of 2 May 1608, the entry for &quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy&quot; ascribes authorship to &quot;William Shakespere.&quot; The title page of the published quarto repeats the attribution to &quot;W. Shakspeare,&quot; and states that the play was acted by the King&#x27;s Men (Shakespeare&#x27;s company) at the Globe Theatre. While some early critics allowed the possibility of Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship, most, over the past two centuries, have doubted the attribution. The modern critical consensus favours the view that the play was written by Thomas Middleton, citing internal evidence from the text of the play. Cases for the authorship of Thomas Heywood or George Wilkins have been made, but have convinced few commentators.

==Performance history==
The title page of the quarto claims that the play was first acted by the King&#x27;s Men at the Globe Theatre (though these sources are not always reliable). No other record of historical performance exists. In the modern age, edited adaptations of the play have been performed by the Birmingham Repertory Company (1958, directed by Bernard Hepton), The Globe Theatre, Los Angeles, 1987, directed by R. Thad Taylor, Starring Guy Masterson (formerly Guy Mastroianni), the National Theatre (1987, directed by Stephen Unwin), by Tough Theatre at the White Bear Theatre Club (2010, directed by Andy Brunskill) and Titchfield Festival Theatre at The Great Barn (2024, directed by Johnny O&#x27;Hanlon).

==Synopsis==
Note: This synopsis follows the scene divisions from Stanley Wells&#x27; edition of the play in &quot;Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works&quot; (eds John Lavagnino and Gary Taylor, Oxford, 2007). Other editions divide the play into ten scenes, rather than eight, by splitting Scene Five into three separate scenes.

===Scene 1: A house in Yorkshire===
The play opens with a conversation among three servants of an anonymous Yorkshire gentleman, who is returning to his country house after a long sojourn in London. Sam, who has returned with his master, explains to Ralph and Oliver that their master has abandoned his local fiancée to marry another young woman: &quot;he&#x27;s married, beats his wife, and has two or three children by her.&quot; Sam also details his master&#x27;s fondness for drunkenness, and sets the mood for what follows.

===Scene 2: Outside the Husband&#x27;s house, near Yorkshire===
The Wife has an opening soliloquy, &quot;What will become of us?,&quot; which fills out the picture of the Husband&#x27;s devotion to drink and gambling and riotous behaviour. The Husband enters. He provides quick justification for the Wife&#x27;s worry with his cruel words and general bad behaviour. The Wife begs him to modify his behaviour for the sake of his children. He replies by saying his sons are bastards, begot from his wife&#x27;s adulterous affairs. The Wife continues to beg him to reform. He kicks her and demands that she go to London to see her uncle so that the lands from her dowry can be sold for cash. The Wife agrees to leave right away. She exits. Three local Gentlemen (otherwise unnamed) enter. They reprove the Husband and urge his reform. One of the Gentlemen is so persistent that the Husband loses his temper and draws his sword. The two fight, and the Husband is left wounded on the floor—but he retains his unrepentant attitude.

===Scene 3: The Husband&#x27;s house, a room above===
The wife has just returned from her uncle in London. She tells a servant that, rather than selling the lands from her dowry, she has convinced her uncle to get her husband a place at court. She hopes that this measure will save her husband&#x27;s reputation and keep him out of bankruptcy. The Husband enters. He demands to see the money from the sale of the dowry lands. The Wife tells him that she has gotten him a place at court instead. The Husband flies into a vicious rage. He calls his wife &quot;whore&quot; and &quot;slut&quot; and threatens her with a dagger. Further violence is interrupted when a servant enters and tells the Husband that he has a visitor: the Master of his college from university. The husband exits to greet his visitor. The Wife is relieved to have escaped her husband&#x27;s wrath. She worries about her family&#x27;s future.

===Scene 4: The Husband&#x27;s house===
The Master has bad news for the Husband: the Husband&#x27;s brother—a student whom the university had great hopes for—has been thrown in prison as a result of the Husband&#x27;s unpaid debts. The Husband is shocked to hear this news. The Master goes on to scold the Husband for his scandalous misbehavior. The Husband seems genuinely repentant. He promises to do whatever he can to secure his brother&#x27;s release. The Master exits. Left alone, the Husband plunges into a deep despondency over his moral decline. He laments his wretched state in a soliloquy that begins with the line &quot;Oh thou confused man, thy pleasant sins have undone thee, thy damnation has beggared thee!&quot; (Commentators who allow a possibility of a Shakespearean contribution to the play tend to centre their attention on this fourth scene and this soliloquy). The Husband&#x27;s eldest son enters and tells his father to move so he can play with his toys. In a fit of passion, the Husband decides to kill his children to save them from the poverty that he sees in his future. He picks his eldest son up with one hand and draws his dagger with the other. Frightened, the boy begs him to stop. The Husband strikes his son and stabs him with the dagger.

===Scene 5: The Husband&#x27;s house, the bedroom above===
A maid holds the Husband&#x27;s second-youngest son while the Wife sleeps. The Husband enters carrying his elder son, who is bleeding, but still alive. He tells the maid to hand the baby over. The maid struggles with him. The Husband throws the maid down the stairs. The baby falls on the floor and is hurt. The Wife awakens and scoops the baby up. The Husband stabs at the baby in his wife&#x27;s arms. Injured, the Wife falls to the floor. A strong (&quot;lusty&quot;) servant enters and tries to restrain the Husband. They wrestle. The Husband overpowers the servant and kicks him with his spurs. The servant is seriously injured. The Husband flees, planning to murder the third and youngest of his children, who is living with its wet nurse nearby. (Some editors insert a scene break at this point). The action is transferred outside. The Master meets the Husband as he leaves the house. He asks the cause of the Husband&#x27;s excited demeanor. The Husband waves off the Master&#x27;s concerns. He repeats his promise to secure his brother&#x27;s release from prison and exits hastily. (Some editors insert a scene break at this point as well). The action now returns to the bedroom above, where the servant, the Wife, and the children are lying on the floor, all seriously injured. The Master enters with his two servants. They are shocked by the bloody spectacle. The Master calls for a doctor. The injured servant tells the Master that the Husband is on his way to kill his third child. The Master and his two servants exit in hot pursuit. The Wife regains consciousness and laments the fate of her two children, who have apparently died. Two servants enter and tell the Wife that a doctor is waiting for her downstairs.

===Scene 6: A road just outside Yorkshire===
The Husband is thrown off his horse. The Master and his servants enter. They apprehend the Husband and make plans to take him to the Knight, who serves as the local justice of the peace.

===Scene 7: The Knight&#x27;s house===
The Husband is brought as a prisoner to the Knight&#x27;s house. The Knight asks the cause of the Husband&#x27;s &quot;monstrous cruelty.&quot; The Husband tells him that he killed his children so they would not become beggars. His only regret is that he was unable to kill his third child. The Knight is shocked by the Husband&#x27;s stoicism. He sends him off to jail to await his trial, which will take place on the following day.

===Scene 8: Outside the Husband&#x27;s house===
In the final scene, the Husband is brought in custody past his ancestral home. His Wife is recovering from her wounds, and the bodies of the murdered children are laid out for burial. The Husband is finally repentant and contrite over his actions... too late for any restoration. Escorted by officers, he departs for his trial. The Wife makes plans to beg for her Husband&#x27;s pardon. The Master expresses his grief at the family tragedy.

<doc id="1022571" wikidata="Q1224796" url="?curid=1022571" title="Digital Negative">
<text>Digital Negative (DNG) is an open, lossless raw image format developed by Adobe and used for digital photography. It was launched on September 27, 2004. The launch was accompanied by the first version of the DNG specification, plus various products, including a free-of-charge DNG converter utility. All Adobe photo manipulation software (such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom) released since the launch supports DNG.

DNG is based on the TIFF/EP standard format, and mandates significant use of metadata. The specification of the file format is open and not subject to any intellectual property restrictions or patents.

==Rationale for DNG==

Adobe states that, given the existence of a wide variety of camera-brand-specific raw image formats, it introduced DNG as a standardized and backward-compatible universal file format. It is based on the TIFF 6.0 standard. Various professional archivists and conservationists, working in institutional settings have adopted DNG for archival purposes.

===Objectives===
The objectives of the DNG file format are:
;Digital image preservation (sometimes known as &quot;archiving&quot;)
: The US Library of Congress states that DNG is a recommended alternative to other raw image formats. The Digital Photography Best Practices and Workflow (dpBestflow) project, funded by the United States Library of Congress and run by the American Society of Media Photographers (ASMP), singles out DNG, and states &quot;DNG files have proven to be significantly more useful than the proprietary raw files in our workflow&quot;.
;Easy and/or comprehensive exploitation by software developers
: Software could support raw formats without DNG, by using reverse engineering and/or dcraw; but DNG makes it easier, and many software products can handle, via DNG, images from cameras that they have no specific knowledge of, however, any settings stored in the DNG file by software from one company are unlikely to be recognized by a product from a different company.
;In-camera use by camera manufacturers
: About 12 camera manufacturers have used DNG in-camera. About 38 camera models have used DNG. Raw image formats for more than 230 camera models can be converted to DNG.
; Multi-vendor interoperability
: Unlike the proprietary RAW formats used by most cameras, DNG is supported by multiple vendors, and is readable by a multitude of software applications.

==Technical summary==
A DNG file always contains data for one main image, plus metadata, and optionally contains at least one JPEG preview. It normally has the extension &quot;dng&quot; or &quot;DNG&quot;.

DNG conforms to TIFF/EP and is structured according to TIFF. DNG supports various formats of metadata (including Exif metadata, XMP metadata, IPTC metadata) and specifies a set of mandated metadata.

DNG is both a raw image format and a format that supports &quot;non-raw&quot;, or partly processed, images. The latter (non-raw) format is known as &quot;Linear DNG&quot;. Linear DNG is still scene-referred and can still benefit from many of the operations typically performed by a raw converter, such as white balance, the application of a camera color profile, HDR compositing, etc. All images that can be supported as raw images can &quot;also&quot; be supported as Linear DNG. Images from the Foveon X3 sensor or similar, hence especially Sigma cameras, can &quot;only&quot; be supported as Linear DNG.

DNG can contain raw image data from sensors with various configurations of color filter array (CFA). These include: conventional Bayer filters, using three colors and rectangular pixels; four-color CFAs, for example the RGBE filter used in the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-F828; rectangular (non-square) pixels, for example as used in the Nikon D1X; and offset sensors (for example with octagonal pixels) such as Super CCD sensors of various types, as used in various Fujifilm cameras. (Or combinations of these if necessary). DNG specifies metadata describing these individual parameters; this is one significant extension to TIFF/EP.

When used in a CinemaDNG movie clip, each frame is encoded using the above DNG image format. The clip&#x27;s image stream can then be stored in one of two formats: either as video essence using frame-based wrapping in an MXF file, or as a sequence of DNG files in a specified file directory.

Contrary to its name (Digital Negative) the DNG format doesn&#x27;t distinguish negative and positive data - all data is considered to be describing a positive image. While this is not an issue when working with images from digital cameras (which are always positive), working with scanned (by a film scanner or DSLR copy stand) film negatives saved as raw DNG files is complicated, because the resultant image is not automatically inverted and thus impossible to be used directly. A way to get around this is using an inverted curve in the photo editing application, however this reverses the effect of the image controls (Exposure, Shadow and Highlight details, etc.) which complicates the photo editing.

==Timeline==
This provides a mixture of the dates of significant events (such as &quot;the first X&quot;) and various counts of usage at the anniversaries of the launch (each 27 September).

Counts of products and companies that use DNG in some way are provided primarily for illustration. They are approximate, and include products that are no longer sold. The purpose is mainly to demonstrate that such products and companies exist, and to show trends. Convertible raw image formats (camera models whose raw images can be converted to DNG) only include official support by Adobe DNG converters; not unofficial support by Adobe products (sometimes reaching about 30), nor support by other DNG converters.

During the first 5 years when about 38 camera models were launched that wrote DNG, Adobe software added support for about 21 Canon models, about 20 Nikon models, and about 22 Olympus models.

==Reception==
The reaction to DNG has been mixed. A few camera manufacturers stated their intention to use DNG at launch. They first supported DNG about 9 months after launch. Several more niche and minority camera manufacturers added support after this (e.g. Leica). The largest camera manufacturers have apparently never indicated an intention to use DNG (e.g. Nikon and Canon).

Some software products supported DNG within 5 months of launch, with many more following. Some only support DNG from cameras writing DNG, or from cameras supported via native raw image formats.

OpenRAW was an advocacy and lobby group with the motto &quot;Digital Image Preservation Through Open Documentation&quot;. They became opposed to DNG.

Some photographic competitions do not accept converted files, and some do not accept DNG.

&quot;DNG conversion&quot; refers to the process of generating a DNG file from a non-DNG image. (This is in contrast to &quot;raw conversion&quot;, which typically refers to reading and processing a raw file, which might be a DNG file, and generating some other type of output from it). DNG conversion is one of the sources of DNG files, the other being direct output from cameras and digital backs.

Several software products are able to do DNG conversion. The original such product is &quot;Adobe DNG Converter&quot; or &quot;DNG Converter&quot;, a freely-available stand-alone utility from Adobe. Other Adobe products such as the ACR plugin to Photoshop or Lightroom can also generate DNG files from other image files.

Most DNG converters are supplied by companies other than Adobe. For example:
* The software that Pentax supplies with all their dSLR cameras can convert PEF raw image files from Pentax cameras into DNG files.
* Flexcolor and Phocus from Hasselblad can convert 3FR raw image files from Hasselblad cameras and digital backs into DNG files.
* Capture One from Phase One is a raw converter that can process not only raw image files from Phase One digital backs, but also raw image files from many other cameras too. Capture One can save images from many of those cameras to DNG.
* KDE Image Plugin Interface is an API that can save the images it is processing to DNG. It can be used standalone or with any image processing applications of the KDE desktop environment under Linux and Windows.
* A number of DNG converters have been developed by &quot;amateurs&quot; to enable raw images from their favored camera or digital back to be processed in a large range of raw converters. These include cases where cameras have been hacked to output raw images that have then been converted to DNG.

The process of DNG conversion involves extracting raw image data from the source file and assembling it according to the DNG specification into the required TIFF format. This optionally involves compressing it. Metadata as defined in the DNG specification is also put into that TIFF assembly. Some of this metadata is based on the characteristics of the camera, and especially of its sensor. Other metadata may be image-dependent or camera-setting dependent. A DNG converter must therefore have knowledge of the camera model concerned, and be able to process the source raw image file including key metadata. Optionally a JPEG preview is obtained and added. Finally, all of this is written as a DNG file.

DNG conversion typically leaves the original raw image file intact. For safety, many photographers retain the original raw image file on one medium while using the DNG file on another, enabling them to recover from a range of hardware, software and human failures and errors. For example, it has been reported in user forums that some versions of the Adobe DNG Converter don&#x27;t preserve all the raw data from raw images from some camera models.

==Summary of products that support DNG in some way==
This section summarizes other more comprehensive lists.

===Adobe products===
All raw image file handling products from Adobe now support DNG. &quot;Adobe DNG Converter&quot; was utility software published by Adobe Systems on September 27, 2004. It converts different camera raw format files into the Digital Negative (DNG) standard. It also supports lossless data compression when converting. The program is free of charge. It can be downloaded at Adobe&#x27;s site (for Windows and macOS).

===Digital cameras and related software===
Use by camera manufacturers varies; there are about 15 camera manufacturers that use DNG, including a few that specialize in movie cameras:
*Modern smartphone cameras using iOS 10, Android 5 or Windows 10 Mobile that are capable of shooting RAW images typically use DNG (e.g. Samsung and Nokia).
** High-end Nokia (now Microsoft) Lumia smartphones like Nokia Lumia Icon, 930, 950, 1020 and 1520, were the first smartphone cameras to support DNG files.
**Samsung&#x27;s high-end smartphones (Galaxy S6 or later) also uses DNG.
**Huawei Android phones using Leica-designed cameras (such as the Mate 9 and Mate 10 Pro) can save raw files to DNG format when shooting in &quot;Pro&quot; mode.
*Niche camera manufacturers typically use DNG in new cameras (including a digiscope, panorama cameras, and at least one movie camera). The article on raw image formats illustrates the complicated relationship between new raw image formats and third-party software developers. Using DNG provides immediate support for these cameras by a large range of software products.
* Some low market share but conventional camera manufacturers use DNG in new cameras. Camera manufacturers that do not supply their own software for processing raw images typically, but not always, use DNG.
* Pentax typically offers users the option of whether to use Pentax&#x27;s own raw image format (PEF) or DNG, but some, for example Pentax Q, Q10 and Q7, do not support PEF. For example, the digital SLR Camera Pentax K-x does offer the ability to save PEF or DNG or even DNG+ which saves two files, a DNG and a separate JPEG file at the same time.
* If a camera uses DNG, and that camera manufacturer supplies software, it will support DNG. It may support DNG only from their own cameras, or support it more generically.
* Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Olympus and Fuji do not use DNG in their cameras. If a camera manufacturer&#x27;s cameras do not use DNG, its software is unlikely to support DNG unless that software is also sold independently of the cameras.

Some digital cameras that support DNG:
* Casio supports DNG in their Exilim PRO EX-F1 and Exilim EX-FH25.
* DxO supports DNG in their DxO ONE camera (introduced 2015).
* Leica has moved to the DNG format across its entire digital range including the M, Q, and SL lines.
* MegaVision E Series Monochrome back.
* Panoscan MK-3 digital panoramic camera.
* Pentax supports DNG in their 645D, 645Z, K10D, K20D, K200D, K2000, K-7, K-x, K-r, K-5, K-30, K-5II(s), K-50, K-500, K-3, K-3II, K-S1, K-S2, K-70 and K-1 DSLR cameras; alongside the K-01, Q, Q10, Q7 and Q-S1 mirrorless cameras.
* Ricoh supports DNG in the Ricoh Digital GR, considered a professional compact, and the Ricoh Caplio GX.
* Ricoh GXR mirrorless interchangeable lens camera unit use also DNG.
* Samsung supports DNG in their Pro815 &quot;&quot; camera and GX-10 and GX-20 DSLR cameras.
* Sea&amp;Sea DX‐1G underwater camera.
* Seitz Roundshot D3 digital back, used in cameras such as the 6×17.
*Sigma FP Native support, SD Quattro cameras support DNG but may require a firmware update.
* Silicon Imaging Silicon Imaging Digital Cinema SI-1920HDVR.
* Sinar now uses DNG as the raw file standard for their eMotion series of digital backs.
* Kron Technologies supports DNG in their Chronos 1.4 and Chronos 2.1-HD high speed cameras.

Apple&#x27;s iPhones and other iOS devices expose an API for third-party apps such as Halide or Lightroom CC to capture DNG images. The native Camera app processes to JPEG or HEIF by default. The iPhone 12 Pro/Pro Max and subsequent Pro and Pro Max models running iOS 14.3 or later have the option to shoot pictures in DNG natively through ProRaw.

Some of the Canon cameras can shoot as DNG using additional free software CHDK.

The built-in camera function in the Adobe Lightroom Mobile app saves to DNG format.

DJI supports DNG in its middle to high-end drones.

===Third-party software===
Support by software suppliers varies; there are of the order of 200 software products that use DNG.

The majority of raw handling software products support DNG. Most provide generic support, while a few support it only if it is output directly from a camera. The type of support varies considerably. There appear to be very few third-party software products that process raw images but don&#x27;t support DNG. This may reflect the difficulty of discovering all of those that do not.

==Versions of the specification==
All versions of the specification remain valid, in the sense that DNG files conforming to old versions should still be read and processed by DNG readers capable of processing later versions. DNG has a version scheme built into it that allows the DNG specification, DNG writers, and DNG readers, to evolve at their own paces. Each version of the specification describes its compatibility with previous versions.

;1.0.0.0, published September 2004: This version accompanied the launch of DNG and related products. It was a rare, possibly unique, example of a raw image format specification published by its owner. It was adequate for representing typical images, but it had a few errors and deficiencies (specifically the lack of support of &quot;masked pixels&quot; and an inadvertent deviation from the JPEG specification) that required it soon to be replaced by the next version.
;1.1.0.0, published February 2005: This version corrected the flaws in the first version. It has proved capable of representing raw images for a large variety of cameras (both when written in-camera or via conversion from other raw image formats) for a few years, and it is the version still typically written in-camera.
;1.2.0.0, published May 2008: This version was based on experience and feedback from other companies about DNG since its launch. It introduced many new features, especially several new options for color specification under the general heading of &quot;Camera Profiles&quot;. These are mainly of value to software products wanting their own flavor of color handling. This version permits administrative control of Camera Profiles, including calibration signatures and copyright information.
;1.3.0.0, published June 2009: This version added various improvements, but the major change was to introduce &quot;Opcodes&quot;. An Opcode is an algorithm to be applied to some or all of the image data, described in the specification, and (optionally) implemented in the product that reads and processes the DNG file. The DNG file itself holds lists of Opcodes to be executed, together with the parameters to be applied on execution. In effect, the DNG file can contain lists of &quot;function calls&quot; to be executed at various stages in the raw conversion process. For example, the &quot;WarpRectilinear&quot; Opcode &quot;applies a warp to an image and can be used to correct geometric distortion and lateral (transverse) chromatic aberration for rectilinear lenses&quot;. This is an example of an algorithm that cannot be applied to the raw image data itself before it is placed into the DNG file, because it should be executed &quot;after&quot; demosaicing. There are 13 Opcodes described in this version, and each Opcode is accompanied by a specification version so that more can be added in future.
;1.4.0.0, published September 2012: This version added Floating Point Image Data, Transparent Pixels, Proxy DNG Files, and additional tags. It also added SampleFormat and Predictor.
;1.5.0.0, published May 2019: This version added Depth Maps and processed Enhanced Image Data that can be stored alongside the raw image, with some details of the processing performed.
;1.6.0.0, published December 2021: This version added large file support (64-bit BigTIFF extension), Semantic Masks, triple-illuminant calibration profiles, and more. 
;1.7.0.0, published June 2023: This version adds support for JPEG XL as a compression method. In September, 1.7.1.0 was published as a minor refresh with additional compression parameters.
;CinemaDNG, published September 2009: CinemaDNG is a derivative of DNG with additional tags specifically for frames of movie clips (&quot;TimeCodes&quot; and &quot;FrameRate&quot;. It is not clear whether these tags will be added to a later version of the DNG specification, or will remain separately described only in the CinemaDNG specification.

==Standardization==
DNG is not a standard format, but is based on several open formats or standards and is being used by ISO in its revision of TIFF/EP. A timeline:
* &quot;2001&quot;: The ISO standard raw image format, ISO 12234-2, better known as TIFF/EP, was ratified and published. It also supports &quot;non-raw&quot;, or &quot;processed&quot;, images. TIFF/EP provided a basis for the raw image formats of a number of cameras, but they typically added their own proprietary data. Some cameras have sensors that cannot be described by that version of TIFF/EP.
* &quot;2004, September&quot;: Adobe launched DNG. Its specification states it &quot;is compatible with the TIFF-EP standard&quot;. It is a TIFF/EP extension with considerably more specified metadata, brought up-to-date and made fit for purpose. DNG also exploits various other open formats and standards, including Exif metadata, XMP metadata, IPTC metadata, CIE XYZ coordinates, ICC profiles, and JPEG. Although DNG supports more sensor configurations than TIFF/EP (for example, cameras from Fujifilm using Super CCD sensors), it still doesn&#x27;t support all sensor types as raw images, especially those using the Foveon X3 sensor or similar, hence especially Sigma cameras.
* &quot;2006&quot;: TIFF/EP began its 5-year revision cycle.
* &quot;2006 to 2007&quot;: Adobe offered the DNG specification to ISO to be part of ISO&#x27;s revised TIFF/EP standard.
* &quot;2008, September &amp; October&quot;: Minutes of ISO/TC 130/WG2 — Prepress Data Exchange, 37th Meeting: &quot;WG 18 is revising the two-part standard (ISO 12234), which addresses digital camera removable memory. The revision of... Part 2 will add DNG into TIFF/EP.&quot; A progress report from ISO about the revision of TIFF/EP stated that the revision &quot;...currently includes two &quot;interoperability-profiles,&quot; &quot;IP 1&quot; for processed image data, using &quot;.TIF&quot; extension, and &quot;IP 2&quot; for &quot;raw&quot; image data, &quot;.DNG&quot; extension&quot;.
* &quot;2009, September&quot;: Minutes of ISO/TC 130/WG2 — Prepress Data Exchange, 39th Meeting: the revision of TIFF/EP &quot;is comprehensive to support many different use cases, including backward compatibility with current TIFF readers and support of Adobe DNG... Profile 2 (proposed extension .dng, if Adobe is in agreement) is intended for camera raw images, including un-demosaiced images... This format will be similar to DNG 1.3, which serves as the starting point for development.&quot;

== Patent status ==
In 2004, Adobe published a &quot;patent license&quot; for DNG that allows everyone to exploit DNG, on the condition that the licensee prominently displays text saying it is licensed from Adobe in source and documentation, and that the license may be revoked if the licensee brings any patent action against Adobe or its affiliates related to the reading or writing of files that comply with the DNG Specification. The license does not name any patent linked to DNG, however.

In 2009, Adobe states that there are no known intellectual property encumbrances or license requirements for CinemaDNG, a superset of DNG. Adobe also stated that if there were a consensus that DNG should be controlled by a standards body, they were open to the idea. Even though the &quot;patent license&quot; now grants rights for no known patents, Adobe has not removed the patent license: as of August 2023, it remains on the Adobe website.

<text>Land and Liberty (; also sometimes translated Land and Freedom) was a Russian clandestine revolutionary organization in the period 1861–1864, and was re-established as a political party in the period 1876–1879. It was a central organ of the &quot;Narodnik&quot; movement.

==The first composition (1861–1864)==
The inspirers of the society were Alexander Herzen and Nikolay Chernyshevsky. The participants set as their goal the preparation of a peasant revolution, their policy documents created under the influence of the ideas of Herzen and Ogarev, the latter of which had coined the term &quot;Land and Liberty&quot; in one of his articles.

The first Executive Committee of the organization included 6 of its organizers (Nikolai Obruchev, Sergey Rymarenko, the brothers Nikolai and Alexander Serno-Solovyevich, Alexander Sleptsov, Vasily Kurochkin). Land and Liberty was a union of circles located in 13-14 cities. The largest circles were Moscow (Yuri Mosolov, Nikolai Shatilov) and St. Petersburg (Nikolai Utin and Natalia Corsini). The militant organization Land and Liberty also formed links with the &quot;Committee of Russian Officers in Poland&quot; under the leadership of Second Lieutenant Andrei Potebnya. According to the data available to Alexander Sleptsov, Land and Liberty counted 3,000 people as members (the Moscow branch alone consisted of 400 members).

In the summer of 1862, the tsarist authorities dealt a serious blow to the organization, arresting its leaders - Chernyshevsky and Serno-Solovyovich, as well as the radical journalist Dmitry Pisarev, who was associated with the revolutionaries. In 1863, due to the expiration of the Charter of the landlord and peasants, the members of the organization expected a powerful peasant uprising, which they wanted to organize in cooperation with the Polish revolutionaries. However, the Polish underground members were forced to organize an uprising ahead of the promised date, and hopes for a peasant revolt in Russia did not materialize. In addition, the liberals for the most part refused to support the revolutionary camp, believing in the progressiveness of the reforms that had begun in the country. Under the influence of all these factors, Land and Liberty was forced to dissolve itself in early 1864.

==The second composition (1876–1879)==
The second composition of Land and Liberty, which was restored in 1876 as a populist organization, included such figures as Alexander Mikhailov, Georgi Plekhanov, Mark Natanson, Dmitry Lizogub, later Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky, Nikolai Morozov, Sophia Perovskaya, Lev Tikhomirov and Nikolai Tyutchev. In total, the organization consisted of about 200 people. In its activities, Land and Liberty relied on a wide range of sympathizers. The name Land and Liberty was given to the Populist Society at the end of 1878, with the appearance of the organ of the same name.

The organization consisted of the main circle (subdivided into seven special groups according to the type of activity) and local groups located in many large cities of the empire. Land and Liberty had its own organ with the same name. An agent of Land and Liberty, Nikolai Kletochnikov, was introduced into the Third Section.

The revolutionaries chose to &quot;settle&quot; in the provinces of Saratov, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Astrakhan, Tambov, Pskov, Voronezh, the Don region and others. They also attempted to spread their revolutionary activities in the Northern Caucasus and the Urals. Land and Liberty organized clandestine publishing and distribution of the revolutionary literature, conducted propaganda among workers and took part in several strikes in Saint Petersburg in 1878-1879. It also influenced the development of the student movement by organizing or supporting demonstrations in Petersburg and other cities, including the so-called Kazan demonstration of 1876, where they would openly admit the organization’s existence for the first time.

The Kazan demonstration was the first political demonstration in Russia with the participation of advanced workers. The demonstration was organized and conducted by the Zemstvoi Narodniks and associated members of workers&#x27; circles on Kazanskaya Square in St. Petersburg. About 400 people gathered in the square, where Georgi Plekhanov delivered a passionate revolutionary speech to the audience.

Land and Liberty’s disappointment with the revolutionary activity in the countryside, intensification of the governmental repressions and political discontent during the Russo-Turkish War and ripening of the revolutionary situation favored the conception and development of new sentiments in the organization itself.
The Lipetsk Congress was held in June 1879 in Lipetsk. Members of Land and Liberty that gathered at the congress included Alexander Mikhailov, Aleksandr Kvyatkovsky, Lev Tikhomirov, Nikolai Morozov and Andrei Zhelyabov, among others. The congress decided to include in the organization&#x27;s program the recognition of the need for a political struggle against the Tsarist autocracy as a primary and independent task. The participants in the Lipetsk Congress declared themselves the Executive Committee of the Social Revolutionary Party and adopted a charter based on centralism, discipline and conspiracy. The Executive Committee, if the general congress of &quot;land volunteers&quot; in Voronezh agreed with the new program, was to take upon itself the implementation of the terror.

Disagreements between the supporters of the former strategy of inciting the countryside called &quot;derevenschiki&quot;, or &quot;villagers&quot; (Georgi Plekhanov, Mikhail Popov, Osip Aptekman etc.) and defenders of transition towards political struggle by means of systematic terrorist methods called &quot;politicians&quot; (Aleksandr Mikhailov, Aleksandr Kvyatkovsky, Nikolai Morozov, Lev Tikhomirov etc.) led to the convocation of the Voronezh Congress of Land and Liberty in June 1879, where the two rival groups would reach a short-term compromise. About 20 people took part, including Georgi Plekhanov, Alexander Mikhailov, Andrei Zhelyabov, Vera Figner, Sophia Perovskaya, Nikolai Morozov, Mikhail Frolenko and Osip Aptekman. Supporters of political struggle and terror (Zhelyabov, Mikhailov, Morozov, and others) attended the congress as a close-knit group, which was organized at the Lipetsk Congress. The resolutions of the Congress were of a compromise: along with activities among the people, the need for political terror was also recognized. Plekhanov, who argued the danger of being carried away by terror for the prospects of working among the people, formally split from Land and Liberty and left the congress.

By 15 August 1879, Land and Liberty had dissolved, breaking up into two independent organizations: the terrorist wing forming People&#x27;s Will and the political wing forming the Black Repartition.

==Program==
The formation of Land and Liberty, in Saint Petersburg in 1876, was preceded by the analysis of the &quot;Going to the People&quot; campaign (&quot;Хождение в народ&quot;, or Khozhdeniye v narod) of 1873-1875. As a result, the members of Land and Liberty defined the basics of the political platform, which would be called &quot;narodnicheskaya&quot; (народническая, or &quot;close to the people&quot;, populist). They admitted a possibility of a special, non-capitalist way of development of Russia with the peasantry as its basis. The members of Land and Liberty considered it necessary to adapt the purposes and slogans of the movement to independent revolutionary aspirations that had already existed among the peasants, as they believed. The program proclaimed the ideal of &quot;anarchy and collectivism&quot; and its requirements, generalized in the slogan &quot;Land and Liberty!&quot;, were designed to allow for the even distribution of all the lands &quot;into the hands of the rural working &quot;, &quot;full communal self-management&quot; and division of the Russian Empire into parts &quot;in accordance with the desires of the locals&quot;.

The Program of Land and Liberty also envisioned a course of actions, aimed at &quot;disorganization of the state&quot;, in its members&#x27; opinion. In particular, it allowed for physical elimination of &quot;the most harmful or prominent members of the government&quot;. The most famous terrorist act of Land and Liberty was the assassination of the Chief of the Gendarmes Nikolai Mezentsov in 1878.

The members of Land and Liberty saw the peasantry as the principal revolutionary force, as opposed to the working class, which would have to play a part of the &quot;second fiddle&quot;. Proceeding from the inevitability of a &quot;forced coup d&#x27;état&quot;, the revolutionaries considered agitation and organization of revolts, demonstrations and strikes to be very important. Land and Liberty represented a &quot;rebellious&quot; current of the revolutionary movement of the 1870s. Vladimir Lenin said that Land and Liberty’s &quot;striving to enlist all the discontented in the organisation and to direct this organisation to resolute struggle against the autocracy … that was its great historical merit.&quot;

<text>Helen Terry (born 25 May 1956) is a British singer and television producer, known for her backing vocal work with Culture Club. As a solo performer, she scored a Top 40 hit single in 1984 with &quot;Love Lies Lost&quot;, and released one album in 1986, &quot;Blue Notes&quot;.

Terry changed careers, with a focus in film and television production, and moved behind the scenes in the music industry. She has been a producer and executive producer for the TV broadcast of the BRIT Awards since 2001.

==Recording career==
Terry was asked to perform on Culture Club&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Kissing to Be Clever&quot;, after lead singer Boy George met her at a London club. Her soulful vocals became a key element of the Culture Club sound on the group&#x27;s debut album and its follow-up, &quot;Colour by Numbers&quot;. She is featured in several of the band&#x27;s videos, including &quot;Time (Clock of the Heart)&quot;, &quot;Church of the Poison Mind&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Miracle&quot;, &quot;Black Money&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way&quot;, &quot;Victims&quot;, and often appeared on television with them.

Her solo career began in 1984 on Culture Club&#x27;s label Virgin with the single &quot;Love Lies Lost&quot; (which she wrote in collaboration with group members Boy George and Roy Hay). The single went to No. 34 in the UK, reached the same position in Australia, and was a No. 28 hit in Ireland. That year, she also co-wrote and recorded &quot;Now You&#x27;re Mine&quot; with producer Giorgio Moroder for the soundtrack to the film, &quot;Electric Dreams&quot;, and released the single &quot;Stuttering&quot;.

In 1985, she recorded &quot;Take That Look Off Your Face&quot; for the multi-artist tribute album &quot;Performance - The Very Best Of Tim Rice &amp; Andrew Lloyd Webber&quot;. She also guested on backing vocals on the track &quot;Take Me Home&quot; on Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;.

Terry&#x27;s album &quot;Blue Notes&quot; was released in 1986, and was produced by Don Was with contributions from Stewart Levine and Christopher Neil. It spawned three singles, &quot;Stuttering&quot;, &quot;Act Of Mercy&quot; and &quot;Come On And Find Me&quot;.

Also in 1986, she recorded &quot;One Summer Day/Duelling Bikes&quot; with Ray Parker Jr. for the 1986 Kevin Bacon movie &quot;Quicksilver&quot;; it reached #96 on the US Billboard Hot 100.

Her involvement with Culture Club was minimal after 1985, although she made a guest appearance during Boy George&#x27;s 1987 UK solo tour and would appear on background vocals on various Boy George projects up until 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Martyr Mantras&quot;. Terry and Boy George had a falling out after he wrote about their relationship in his memoir, but have reconciled.

In 1989, after signing to Parlophone, she released an EP, &quot;Fortunate Fool&quot;, featuring three new songs. Two of these, &quot;Fortunate Fool&quot; and &quot;Lessons in Loneliness&quot;, were also released as singles, but differences with her record company led to a deadlock over plans for an album and she abandoned the contract.

&quot;Blue Notes&quot; has been re-released as a remastered limited edition CD with bonus tracks in 2009.

Terry contributed all the backing vocals to the track &quot;Whole New Way&quot; on the 2010 Scissor Sisters album &quot;Night Work&quot;.

==Media production career==
Terry moved into film and television production, beginning as a children&#x27;s TV researcher in 1990, and as a producer for the BRIT Awards TV broadcast since 2001, becoming the executive producer in 2005. The 2008 broadcast attracted 6.1 million viewers.

<doc id="1022636" wikidata="Q2165252" url="?curid=1022636" title="Sir Duke">
<text>&quot;Sir Duke&quot; is a song composed and performed by Stevie Wonder from his 1976 album &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;. Released as a single in 1977, the track topped the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Black Singles charts, and reached number two in the UK Singles Chart, his joint biggest hit there at the time. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the No. 18 song of 1977.

The song was written in tribute to Duke Ellington, the influential jazz legend who had died in 1974. The lyrics also refer to Count Basie, Glenn Miller, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald.

Wonder re-recorded the song for the 1995 live album &quot;Natural Wonder&quot;.

== Background ==
Wonder wrote the song as a tribute to Duke Ellington, the jazz composer, bandleader, and pianist who had influenced him as a musician. Wonder had already experienced the death of two of his idols (Dinah Washington and Wes Montgomery) after attempting to collaborate with them.

After Ellington died in 1974, Wonder wanted to write a song acknowledging musicians he felt were important. He later said, &quot;I knew the title from the beginning but wanted it to be about the musicians who did something for me. So soon they are forgotten. I wanted to show my appreciation.&quot;

Wonder pays tribute to &quot;some of music&#x27;s pioneers&quot; in the song: &quot;There&#x27;s Basie, Miller, Satchmo, and the king of all, Sir Duke / And with a voice like Ella&#x27;s ringing out / There&#x27;s no way the band can lose&quot;.

Wonder recorded other tributes to people he admired, including the 1980 songs &quot;Master Blaster&quot;, dedicated to Bob Marley, and &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, which pleaded for what would eventually become the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday in the United States.

==Reception==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;it&#x27;s a tribute to jazz and roots, with a beat that lies somewhere between jazz and funk, and a horn section that dances on winged feet.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said upon its single release: &quot;Already familiar from its radio play and already on The Singles Chart, it is shaping up as a major hit.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; critic John Rockwell said that it&#x27;s &quot;not Wonder&#x27;s most compelling song, but nice that it should be so popular.&quot;

<doc id="1022639" wikidata="Q6852114" url="?curid=1022639" title="Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal">
<text>The Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal (MOVSM) is a military award which was created under Executive Order 12830 by George H. W. Bush on January 9, 1993. The medal was designed by the Institute of Heraldry and was first issued in December 1993.

==General information==
The MOVSM recognizes those members of the military (active duty, reserve and National Guard) who perform substantial volunteer service to the local community above and beyond the duties required as a member of the United States Armed Forces. Such volunteer service must be made in a sustained and direct nature towards the civilian community, must be significant in nature to produce tangible results, and must reflect favorably on the military service and the United States Department of Defense. The definition of volunteer service is left intentionally vague, allowing for a wide variety of activities and volunteer duties which would qualify a service member for the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal. Typical volunteer work includes Volunteer Emergency Services (like the Civil Air Patrol, Coast Guard Auxiliary, or volunteer firefighting / EMS / Rescue Squad). Other volunteer opportunities that would qualify include Boy Scouts of America, Habitat for Humanity, soup kitchen work, or local, state, or federal parks and forests.

&#x27;SECDEF authorized the Military Departments to establish standards for the time period required to qualify for the MOVSM. All the Military Departments have established that a sustained period of volunteer service is normally 36 months. While this does not absolutely preclude the award for exceptional volunteer service of less time, it should guide commanders in upholding the intent of the award. The overall level of volunteer participation and impact of an individual’s community service is the key to determining whether award of the MOVSM is justified.&#x27;

The MOVSM is intended to recognize exceptional community support over time and not a single act or achievement. Further, it is intended to honor direct support of community activities. For the purpose of this award, attending membership meetings or social events of a community service group is not considered qualifying service, while manning a community crisis action telephone line is considered qualifying service.

Approval authority for award of the MOVSM is held by commanders serving in the rank of lieutenant colonel (or commander) or above. Before the recommendation is forwarded to the award approval authority, the recommender must certify that the service member meets the eligibility criteria for award of the MOVSM. Substantiating documentation, such as record of hours contributed, letters or certificates from activity supervisors, or other proof of the service member&#x27;s volunteer services may be attached as enclosures to the recommendation.

The MOVSM cannot be awarded more than once during a given duty assignment or tour of duty. It may be awarded posthumously, but is not authorized for presentation to foreign personnel.

The authority governing this award is DoD Manual 1348.33-V2 December 21, 2016.

==Appearance==
The MOVSM is a bronze medal, 1 1/8 inches in diameter. The obverse bears five interlaced annulets behind a five-pointed star, surrounded by a laurel wreath. On the reverse is an oak sprig with three leaves and two acorns between the inscription &quot;OUTSTANDING VOLUNTEER SERVICE&quot; above and &quot;UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES&quot; below.

The suspension and service ribbon is 1 3/8 inches wide and consists of the following stripes: 1/8 inch bluebird; 1/8 inch goldenlight; 3/16 inch bluebird; 1/16 inch green; 5/32 inch goldenlight; center 1/16 inch green; 5/32 inch goldenlight; 1/16 inch green; 3/16 inch bluebird; 1/8 inch goldenlight; and 1/8 inch bluebird.

Multiple awards are indicated using five-pointed bronze service stars (one additional award each), and five-pointed silver service stars (five awards each).

<text>Kevin Ford (born 1968), better known as DJ Hype, is a British jungle and drum and bass producer and DJ.

==Biography==
Hype first became involved in music as a teenager in 1982, assisting PJ and Smiley with their sound system Heatwave in East London, which evolved into Shut Up and Dance.

Hype began producing in 1989, engineering and co-producing tracks (including &quot;Exorcist&quot; and &quot;The Bee&quot;) for Kickin&#x27;Records, Strictly Underground and Suburban Base. UK garage producer Wookie remembers that Hype worked with The Scientist on &quot;The Bee&quot; to create one of the first jungle tunes to hit big, following &quot;£10 to Get In&quot; by Shut Up and Dance in 1989. Around this time, Hype hosted a show on the London pirate radio station Fantasy FM, and he was famed for his mixing and scratching skills.

Suburban Base released Hype&#x27;s track &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot; that made the UK Singles Chart in 1993. By 1994, he had become a big name in the breakbeat hardcore and jungle raves - landing awards for Best Male DJ and Best Radio DJ (in 1994 and 1995 respectively) at the UK&#x27;s Hardcore Awards, and hosting a show on the legal station Kiss 100.

Hype&#x27;s Ganja Records label gained popularity primarily through dance floor fillers such as &quot;You Must Think First&quot;, &quot;Tiger Style&quot; and DJ Zinc&#x27;s &quot;Super Sharp Shooter&quot;. Their popularity peaked in 1996 with the release of their first album, &quot;Still Smokin&#x27; &quot;, a label compilation released jointly by Ganja and Pascal&#x27;s Frontline imprint. Re-released in 1997, its success also led to a major label deal with BMG&#x27;s Parousia sub-label and the establishment of True Playaz, an MC-led deejay and production unit also including DJ Zinc, Pascal and Rude Bwoy Monty. Hype&#x27;s 1997 Parousia EP, &quot;New Frontiers&quot;, with Ganja Kru, reached No. 56 in the UK Albums Chart.

Hype is known for his jump-up deejay sets, including appearances at the Playaz night at Fabric.

On 30 March 2009, Hype released a new double album mix compilation on Rhino Records, entitled &quot;DJ Hype presents Drum and Bass Essentials&quot;.

<doc id="1022657" wikidata="Q1455715" url="?curid=1022657" title="Fresno Falcons">
<text>The Fresno Falcons are an adult travel inline hockey team and were a minor league hockey team. The ice hockey Falcons were charter members of several long standing leagues in the western United States including the Pacific Southwest Hockey League and the West Coast Hockey League. In their final years, they were members of the ECHL (formerly East Coast Hockey League). In 2024, a new iteration of the Falcons would be formed as an adult travel inline hockey team, They are located in Fresno, California.

==Early history==
The Fresno Hockey Club, originally known as the Flyers, was founded in 1946 as a charter member of the Pacific Coast Hockey League, where they played until the league folded in 1950. The all time goal leader is Adrian Marin with 40 goals in a season

The team picked up in 1952 for a season in the Pacific Coast Senior League. Following just one season, hockey was dormant in Fresno until 1968, when the Fresno Aces were introduced for a season in the short-lived Cal-Neva Hockey League.

Cal-Neva was a loosely linked group of professional and semi-pro teams from around the West Coast. The league lacked structure, and played games for a selection of regional championships rather than a league championship. In the 1970–71 season, the Las Vegas Gamblers club was expelled from the league, following numerous rules violations. The Gamblers were in first place at the time, and all records of games involving them were voided. The league was dissolved following the 1971-72 season, as league commissioners cited the need for more structure, and without a Nevada team, a need for a new name.

During the 1968–69 season, Fresno&#x27;s team was officially known as the Fresno Aces. For 1969–70, the name was changed back to the Fresno Falcons.

==Playing in the PSHL==
The Pacific Southwest Hockey League was founded in 1972 following the dissolution of the Cal-Neva Hockey League. and the Falcons were one of the league&#x27;s staples, as the only franchise in the league that was present from its beginning, throughout to the 1995–96 merger that formed the West Coast Hockey League.

The Falcons were the PSHL&#x27;s signature franchise largely due to convenience and the availability of a then-relatively new showcase arena, Selland Arena in Fresno&#x27;s Convention Center. At times throughout the league&#x27;s history, some games even if not involving the Falcons were held at Selland Arena, including several Championship Finals series throughout the 1970s.

A PSHL season ranged from 15 to 30 games each between anywhere from 4 to 8 teams. Franchises shifted frequently, often with new teams appearing the next season from the same cities. The mainstays of the league were the Falcons, the Los Angeles Bruins and later in the league&#x27;s history, the Burbank or Los Angeles Jets and the West Covina or California Blackhawks (later just Hawks).

Falcons games were often paired with side attractions when it came to teams&#x27; marketing, including broomball and roller derby.

==Joining the WCHL/merging with the ECHL==
Following an experimental partnership with the Sunshine Hockey League in 1994–95, The Falcons became a charter member of the professional West Coast Hockey League to begin the 1995–96 season. The team was a member throughout the league&#x27;s eight-year existence. During the 1997–98 season they were known as Fresno&#x27;s Fighting Falcons. Fresno won the league&#x27;s Taylor Cup championship for the 2001–02 season, defeating the Idaho Steelheads in the finals.

Along with other active WCHL teams, the Falcons joined the ECHL after the West Coast Hockey League was absorbed by the larger league in 2003.

==Affiliates==
==Arenas==
For most of its history, the ice hockey team played at Fresno&#x27;s Selland Arena, and their green and gold colors and hard-knocks play made them a staple of sports and entertainment in Fresno. The Falcons were the centerpieces of the league, as the Falcons dominated, winning sixteen league championships in 24 seasons.

The ice hockey Falcons moved to the Save Mart Center on the campus of California State University, Fresno to coincide with their transfer to the ECHL in 2003. They played there until returning to Selland Arena in 2008.

The inline hockey Falcons play out of the inline rink at Fresno&#x27;s Cary Park.

==Financial troubles and ice hockey franchise&#x27;s end==
On December 22, 2008, Fresno Hockey Club, LLC announced that the Fresno Falcons team would cease operations immediately citing operating cost due to dwindling attendance, lack of corporate sponsorships and the faltering economy.

President Dave Dakers of the Victoria Salmon Kings ECHL team expressed some negative commentary on the Falcons team management abilities, but praised the team itself as being &quot;competitive&quot;. The owners did not do all they could to salvage the situation, according to Dakers and gave up too easily as there were still other options available to minimize the economic damage. He was rather disappointed and not too pleased as quoted in the &quot;Victoria Times Colonist&quot; newspaper article.

The ice hockey Falcons were the second team that season to fold, following the Augusta Lynx. Arguments were made that the ECHL had expanded into markets that were unable to sustain their market, though the perception in Fresno&#x27;s case was that the franchise had issues beyond that which prevented the team from being profitable. Fresno was without hockey at any level until the Fresno Monsters began play in the 2009–10 season in the Tier III Junior A Western States Hockey League. The city briefly hosted two junior teams called the Monsters from 2010 to 2013 when the Tier II North American Hockey League expanded into Fresno. In 2013, the NAHL Monsters relocated to Wenatchee, Washington; however, the Monsters continued to field a team in the WSHL and later the USPHL.

==Roller hockey revival==

In January 2024, Fresno State grad Matt Braun, along with Visalia native and NARCh president, Daryn Goodwin, would form a new travel inline hockey team. This team would revive the Fresno Falcons name as a tribute, as Goodwin, along with the fathers of four of the team&#x27;s players, were alumni of the former ice hockey Falcons. The team would wear iconic green and yellow throwback style jerseys from 1970 to 1995 as their primary uniforms.

<text>Green Village is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) within Harding and Chatham townships in Morris County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 1,103. It is located just north of the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge and is named after Ashbel Green, former president of Princeton University.

In the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine 2006 ranking of the &quot;Most Expensive ZIP Codes in the United States&quot;, Green Village was ranked as the 282nd most expensive in the country, with its median home sale price in 2005 of $777,465. As of 2021, the median home value within Green Village was $1,069,200. 

==History==
The village was founded in the 18th century and named for founding father Ashbel Green. One of the earliest houses in the village is that of Elias Boudinot, constructed in 1760 by one of George Washington&#x27;s generals, William Alexander. The village center was largely created in 1800 by local farmer John Cockrem and his family, which ran a wagon-building company in town, and his son Philip built the local Methodist church and original post office. A new post office would be built during the Eisenhower presidency.

==Geography==
Green Village is in southern Morris County, mostly in the western part of Chatham Township, but extending into the eastern part of Harding Township. It is bordered to the northeast by the borough of Madison and to the west by unincorporated New Vernon. Morristown, the county seat, is to the north. The village is drained by Great Brook and its tributary Loantaka Brook, which flow southwest into the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge and thence to the Passaic River. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Green Village CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 4.13%, are water.

Green Village has its own post office and fire department, as well as a plant nursery known as The Farm at Green Village, a deli, a Methodist church, and a gas station. Additionally, a number of residents maintain farms and sell produce (including pumpkins, tomatoes, watermelons), eggs, and firewood. Green Village principally consists of three streets, namely Green Village Road, which runs east to Madison and west to New Vernon; and Meyersville Road and Britten Road, which each run south to the Great Swamp. The eastern end of Woodland Road is within the Green Village CDP and ZIP Code area, while the remainder is within the New Vernon CDP and ZIP Code area.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, the area had a population of 1,103.
==Education==
Students attend schools in either Harding Township or Chatham, depending on which side of Green Village they live in.

<text>John Fletcher Steele (June 7, 1885 – July 16, 1971) was an American landscape architect credited with designing and creating over 700 gardens from 1915 to the time of his death.

== Early life ==

Steele was born in Rochester, New York, United States to a lawyer father and pianist mother. He graduated with a B.A. from Williams College in 1907. While there, he was a member of the fraternity of Delta Psi (St. Anthony Hall). He then enrolled in the young landscape architecture program at Harvard University where Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. was one of his professors. In 1908 Steele left Harvard to accept an apprenticeship with Warren H. Manning.

== Career ==

In 1913 Steele embarked on a four-month tour of Europe to study European designs. Upon his return to America, he opened his own practice. His early garden plans are generally in the English Arts and crafts style of Gertrude Jekyll, Reginald Blomfield, and T. H. Mawson, but ornamented with Italianate detailing such as balustrades, hedges, urns, statuary, stone pineapples, and flights of water steps. During World War I, Steele served in the American Red Cross in Europe. After war&#x27;s end he regularly returned in summers.

His conversion to an Art Deco style began in 1925 when he visited the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes (the &#x27;Art Deco Exposition&#x27;) and saw its examples of cubist gardens with mirrors, concrete and coloured gravel. By 1930 Steele was writing with enthusiasm of André Vera, Tony Garnier (architect), and Gabriel Guevrekian.

Steele&#x27;s designs and writings of this period were influential during the stylistic transition from Art Deco to Modernism. He helped shape Modernism through younger design students at Harvard, notably Dan Kiley, Garrett Eckbo, and James C. Rose, to who Steele showed the possibilities of modern art and the creativity inherent within the design process. Kiley later wrote that &quot;Steele was the only good designer working during the twenties and thirties, also the only one who was really interested in new things.&quot; Eckbo noted that &quot;Fletcher Steele was the transitional figure between the old guard and the moderns. He interests me because he was an experimenter.&quot; Steele&#x27;s own designs, however, were sufficiently removed from the Modern style so that his works were generally out of fashion until the modern era had passed.

Steele was based in Boston for more than 50 years. In pursuit of his career he traveled by train extensively in the United States. Toward the end of his life, he lived in Pittsford, New York. The local library there has a Fletcher Steele Room and books on display from his private collection.

Steele is interred in the Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, New York. His papers are archived in the Library of Congress, the Rochester Historical Society and in the Franklin Moon Library, State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, New York. Images from the Steele manuscript collection can be found in the SUNY D-Space digital repository.

== Projects ==
Steele is noted for a number of major works including Naumkeag, Peters Reservation, Ancrum House, Whitney Allen House, Standish Backus House, Turner House, Lisburne Grange. His most famous work by far is Naumkeag.

These projects were not all viewed with high regard at the time, and only relatively recently have historians begun to appreciate Steele&#x27;s impact on garden design and landscape architecture.

According to Robin Karson&#x27;s 1991 book about Steele&#x27;s life and his landscape architecture, the only two of his gardens that remain in existence (as originally created) are at Naumkeag and at the Whitney Allen House. However, Melissa McGrain, with the support of her husband Andrew Stern, bought the estate containing Nancy and Richard Turner&#x27;s house in Pittsford, New York and did excellent work in restoring the garden that Steele designed and developed for the Turners.

<text>In the mathematical subfield of numerical analysis the symbolic Cholesky decomposition is an algorithm used to determine the non-zero pattern for the formula_1 factors of a symmetric sparse matrix when applying the Cholesky decomposition or variants.

==Algorithm==
Let
formula_2
be a sparse symmetric positive definite matrix with elements from a field formula_3, which we wish to factorize as formula_4.

In order to implement an efficient sparse factorization it has been found to be necessary to determine the non zero structure of the factors before doing any numerical work. To write the algorithm down we use the following notation:

* Let formula_5 and formula_6 be sets representing the non-zero patterns of columns and (below the diagonal only, and including diagonal elements) of matrices and respectively.
* Take formula_7 to mean the smallest element of formula_6.
* Use a parent function formula_9 to define the elimination tree within the matrix.

The following algorithm gives an efficient 
symbolic factorization of :

<doc id="1022665" wikidata="Q3927118" url="?curid=1022665" title="String Quartets, Op. 59 (Beethoven)">
<text>The three Razumovsky (or Rasumovsky) string quartets, opus 59, are a set of string quartets by Ludwig van Beethoven. He wrote them in 1806, as a result of a commission by the Russian ambassador in Vienna, Count Andreas Razumovsky:
:*String Quartet No. 7 in F major, Op. 59, No. 1
:*String Quartet No. 8 in E minor, Op. 59, No. 2
:*String Quartet No. 9 in C major, Op. 59, No. 3

They are the first three of what are usually known as the &quot;Middle Period&quot; string quartets, or simply the &quot;Middle Quartets.&quot; The other two are opus 74 and opus 95. Many quartets record all five as a set.

Beethoven uses a characteristically Russian theme in the first two quartets in honour of the prince who gave him the commission:
* In Op. 59 No. 1, the &quot;Thème russe&quot; (as the score is marked) is the principal theme of the last movement.
* In Op. 59 No. 2, the Thème russe is in the B section of the third movement. This theme is based on a Russian folk song which was also utilised by Modest Mussorgsky in the coronation scene of his opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, by Pyotr Tchaikovsky in the introduction to act III of his opera Mazeppa, by Sergei Rachmaninoff in the sixth movement of his 6 Morceaux for Piano Duet, Op.11 &quot;Glory&quot; (&quot;Slava&quot;), and by Igor Stravinsky in his ballet &quot;The Firebird&quot;.
* In the quartet Op. 59 No. 3, there is no Thème russe explicitly named in the score, but a secondary theme in the second movement has a passing resemblance to a traditional Russian song, which may well account for the Russian flavour noted by a number of writers, including Lewis Lockwood. 
All three quartets were published as a set in 1808 in Vienna.

==Reception==
Although the quartets are now mainstream repertoire, they were generally received with uncertainty, as they deviated from the established genre of string quartets in their content and emotional range. However, one review published in 1807 stated that &quot;Three new, very long and difficult Beethoven string quartets … are attracting the attention of all connoisseurs. The conception is profound and the construction excellent, but they are not easily comprehended.&quot;

<text>The Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) is a government agency that was founded in 1991 to manage Southern Nevada&#x27;s water needs on a regional basis in Clark County.

SNWA provides wholesale water treatment and delivery for the greater Las Vegas Valley and is responsible for acquiring and managing long-term water resources for Southern Nevada.

From its inception, the SNWA has worked to acquire additional water resources, manage existing and future water resources, construct and operate regional water facilities and promote water conservation.

The SNWA is governed by a seven-member board of directors, which comprises one elected official from each governing board of the SNWA&#x27;s seven member agencies. While the Board of Directors sets policy direction for the SNWA, the Las Vegas Valley Water District is responsible for the day-to-day management of the organization through an agreement between the SNWA member agencies.

==Member agencies==
* Big Bend Water District (Laughlin): Steve Sisolak (Democratic)
* Boulder City: Peggy Leavitt (Republican)
* Clark County Water Reclamation District: James B. Gibson (Democratic)
* Henderson: John Marz (Republican)
* Las Vegas: Bob Coffin (Democratic)
* Las Vegas Valley Water District: Marilyn Kirkpatrick (Democratic)
* North Las Vegas: John Jay Lee (Democratic)

==Water supply and distribution==
Southern Nevada gets nearly 90 percent of its water from the Colorado River. The other 10 percent of the water comes from groundwater that is pumped out through existing wells within Clark County. Perchlorates in ground water in Henderson and associated runoff into the Las Vegas Wash has been a concern since 1997.

===Treatment facilities ===
* Alfred Merritt Smith Water Treatment Facility
* River Mountains Water Treatment Facility

These facilities first treat the water with ozone to kill any potentially harmful microscopic organisms. As the water leaves the water treatment facilities, chlorine is added to protect it on the way to customers&#x27; taps. Since 2000, SNWA has also added fluoride to the municipal water supply.

===Major distribution systems===
* East Valley Lateral
* North Valley Lateral
* South Valley Lateral
* West Valley Lateral

===Reservoirs===
* Brock Reservoir which is partly funded by SNWA - 
* Burkholder Reservoir -

<doc id="1022671" wikidata="Q42763" url="?curid=1022671" title="Santiago de los Caballeros">
<text>Santiago de los Caballeros (&#x27;), often shortened toSantiago, is the second-largest city in the Dominican Republic and the fourth-largest city in the Caribbean by population. It is the capital of Santiago Province and the largest major metropolis in the Cibao region of the country. Santiago is the largest Caribbean city that is not a capital city, and it is also the largest non-coastal metropolis in the Caribbean islands. Santiago is located approximately northwest of the capital Santo Domingo with an average altitude of . The city has a total population of 771,748 inhabitants (2022). Santiago&#x27;s metropolitan area population composed by the municipalities of Santiago-Licey Al Medio-Baitoa-Tamboril-Puñal-Villa González is 959,498 as of 2022, making it the second largest of the Dominican Republic.

Founded in 1495 during the first wave of European settlement in the New World, the city is the &quot;first Santiago of the Americas&quot;. Today it is one of the Dominican Republic&#x27;s cultural, political, industrial and financial centers. Due to its location in the fertile Cibao Valley, it has a robust agricultural sector and is a leading exporter of rum, textiles, and cigars. Santiago is known as &quot;La Ciudad Corazón&quot; (the &quot;Heartland City&quot;). 

Santiago de los Caballeros has historically been an important strategic city in the Dominican War of Independence. The city&#x27;s name, Saint James of the Knights, refers to the Hidalgos de la Isabela, a group of knights who had come from La Isabela city to stay in Santiago. Sometimes, the city is called Santiago de los 30 Caballeros (&quot;English: Saint James of the 30 Knights&quot;).

==History==
The name of the city (Saint James of the Knights) refers to the Hidalgos de la Isabela, a group of knights who had come from La Isabela to settle in Santiago. The colony was originally located in San Francisco de Jacagua (now a suburb of the city), founded in 1495. Still, when an earthquake destroyed it, it was moved to its current location in 1506. In granting in 1508 the Royal Privilege of Concession de Armas to the Villa de Santiago of Hispaniola, the heraldic emblem that was included in his shield was venerated. The royal decree was signed by King Ferdinand as administrator of the kingdoms of his daughter Joanna I of Castile.

The city was devastated by another earthquake on December 2, 1562. The survivors settled on land belonging to Petronila Jáquez of Minaya, adjacent to the Yaque del Norte, which is the current location of the city&#x27;s river. The brief French during the Peace of Basel (which yielded the Spanish part of the island to France in 1795) left its mark on Santiago. Santiago was returned to Spain under the Peace of Paris of 1814. During the 19th Century, Santiago began its modern urban planning. European neoclassicism is represented at the Palace Hall, built between 1892 and 1895, by a Belgian architect named Louis Bogaert. The late 1800s saw a peak of architecture in the city. Numerous residences were built in European styles, and make up the central core of Santiago.

==Geography==

Santiago de los Caballeros is located on a hilly terrain in the middle of the Cibao Valley in the Central Region of the Dominican Republic, one of the most fertile lands found in the island. The Yaque del Norte River passes by Santiago which is in between the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera Septentrional, two of the three major mountain ranges on the island of Hispaniola, forming the Cibao Valley.

===Climate===
Santiago features a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification. The average temperature varies little in the city, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. December and January are the coolest months and July and August are the warmest. Santiago and the rest of the country are in the Caribbean and have a tropical climate, which, when coupled with the city&#x27;s altitude, 183 meters above sea level, causes cloudy conditions to persist through much of the year. While the entire country is susceptible to Atlantic hurricanes, Santiago and its environs are more sheltered than other parts of the country from their effects because of its location in the Cibao Valley.



==Economy==

Santiago de los Caballeros is considered the capital of the Cibao region, which produces 33% of the GDP, for a total of US$36,025 million in 2022, exceeding the total of El Salvador. Likewise, it had a Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of US$978 million, equivalent to the 16th economy in receiving foreign investment in Latin America and the Caribbean, surpassing Ecuador.

Santiago&#x27;s economy is mainly based by the commercialization and industrialization of its products and finished goods, production of goods in the free zones, and by commerce. The city has headquarters and branches of all the main stores, supermarkets, restaurants and financial entities of the country. The city also has several shopping centers and multinational companies.

Since it is the second-largest city in the Dominican Republic, it currently produces the second highest percentage of the nation&#x27;s GDP, while also having one of the highest incomes per capita, and a large middle-class population. Telecommunications, such as; wireless phones, cable service, internet service and other services are important for the local economy. Tourism, to a lesser extent, also accounts for a portion of the city&#x27;s economy.

Santiago, like most cities and towns in the Cibao valley, has historically benefited from the fertile lands of this region. This makes Santiago de los Caballeros an important area for farming and livestock. Santiago&#x27;s industrial sector is also one of the most dynamic in the country. It has the concentration of 15% of domestic industries. This means 308 manufacturing companies, which in 2004 employed more than 14,000 people or 12% of the labor of Dominican manufacturing work. The products range from cigars, coffee, and alcoholic beverages, to concrete, plywood and sheet products.

The Mercado Modelo on Calle del Sol is a shopping center where there are various stores of handicrafts and native articles made by hand.

===Growth and development===
Santiago has recently experienced an era of rapid growth and development. It has become a city of great importance for the nation and the region&#x27;s development. The population of Santiago was about 771,748 inhabitants as of 2022, making it the second most populous city in the Dominican Republic and one of the largest in the Caribbean (behind Santo Domingo, Havana, and Port-au-Prince), as well as the largest city that isn&#x27;t a capital (although it once was). 

The role of Santiago as a regional development hub and that of La Vega, Moca, San Francisco de Macorís and Puerto Plata as “hinge” cities for interregional articulation, give it a unique character in the national territory. While the first articulates regional, national and international processes that generate agro-productive wealth and services, the other three do so with their immediate regions: La Vega with the center of the national territory, San Francisco de Macorís with its immediate surroundings in the east and south, and Moca and Puerto Plata with their northern surroundings. This dynamic of territorial cohesion is completed with an articulated network of three tertiary centers (Tamboril, Navarrete and Salcedo) and 8 local centers that articulate with the immediate rural environment.

Economically, Santiago de los Caballeros is the axis of advancement of the northern and central region of the country and has a particular influence on the national economy. The economy of the Santiago municipality is supported mainly by the production, industrialization and commercialization of agricultural products, commerce, banking services, call centers, health services, education, among others. The industrial free zone of the Santiago municipality houses 23% of the country&#x27;s companies and generates 24% of exports36, and a total of 155 companies operate in these 15 parks, that is, 30% of the national total of companies under this regime. The first generator of direct employment is the commerce and hotel sector, followed by the industrial sector, which represents 29.2% and 18.3% of the employed population, respectively; However, the percentage of the employed population was estimated for 2010 at 41.4% of the total for the Santiago municipality, while informal employment for 2015 was around 54.4% of the employed population according to data collected in the ICES study (2015). As of 2025, the city has 771,748 inhabitants with a visitor population of more than 250,000 per day. 

== Demographics ==
=== Population Growth and Development ===
Santiago de Los Caballeros had experienced important demographic grown since the 1960s decade. During the period of 1960-70 the population growth from 85,640 to 155,240 inhabitans with an annual groth rate of 6.51%. During the intercensal period 1970-1981 the popluation annual groth rate was of 4.43%, increasing from 155,240 to 260,361. During the inter-census period of 1981-1993 the population of the city increased on an annual rate of 2.86% and registered a total increase of 102,745 inhabitants. The population jumped from 260,361 to 363,106 inhabitans. 

Despite the population continued to growth, in the decades after the 1960s, the growth rate gradually decreased. This slowdown may have been related to the decrease in the attraction force of Santiago as a regional nucleus and the loss of local dynamism, generating changes in population distribution. In the decade from 1993 to 2002 the annual growth rate was 3.61%, which constituted an increase of 141,955 more people, and reached a population of 507,418 inhabitants in 2002 while the urban area was 602,701 inhabitans. This growth was related to the attraction generated by the job offer in the free zone sector and the university academic offer. According to the Dominican Republic&#x27;s 2003-2007 National Statistics Office (ONE) report, the estimated population of the city was 622,101 as of 2007.

In the period 1960-1969 the city grew by 6 km², that is, it covered an area of approximately 9 km². In 1979 the city of Santiago de los Caballeros already had an urbanized area of 25 km², the result of rural-urban migration that extended the city with the creation of new peripheral neighborhoods. Later, with the use of immigrant labor from rural areas and neighboring towns that attracted the opening of the industrial free zone in the 80s, there was significant urban growth in the northwest area of the city, as well as real estate investment towards the north-northeast and east, extending to 28 km², three times more than in 1970. 

The 90s defined a new profile of the city, registering a greater growth of high-rise buildings for residential use. By 1998, it was estimated that the city had reached an urbanized area of 40 km². And by 2009, an urban area of approximately 90 km² (55% of the municipality), extending its north-south axis approximately 10 kilometers and its east-west axis 11 kilometers. From 1960 to 2009, Santiago has multiplied its urban population by eight and has expanded its urbanized territory 30 times, leaving only 72 km² available for expansion of the 162 km² of the municipality. 

Analyzing the growth trend and the role that Santiago has played in the regional configuration of the Cibao, it is understood that beyond the political-administrative borders, Santiago has a functional relationship with settlements that directly influence it, located within a radius of 50 kilometers, which includes all the municipalities and municipal districts of its province, in addition to Puerto Plata, Mao, La Vega and Moca. Its indirect influence reaches distant localities such as Dajabón, in the Northwest Line (150 kilometers), even to Cap Haitien, the main urban center of the northern part of the Republic of Haiti. As of 2002, The area of influence of the municipality, at an economic level, is exercised not only with the municipalities that make up the province but with the municipalities of Moca, Mao, Esperanza, La Vega, Puerta Plata, Imbert and Sosua. The basic production of the surrounding municipalities is tobacco planting and production, poultry activities and free trade zones.

In the last 20 years, its urban area has expanded by 35% (14.74 km2) and has been consolidated by 65% (27.98 km2), totaling 42.72 km2, which corresponds to 47% of the total area of the study of the city of Santiago. To have a reference of the size to which this expansion-consolidation refers, this area would be 47 times larger than the Colonial City of Santo Domingo or approximately half the size of the National District. tThe expansion has been carried out predominantly in the periphery, especially in western Santiago, where 31% (4.52 km2) of the expansion is located. On the other hand, the predominant consolidation has been combined in the central, eastern and southeastern areas of the city, especially in the urban area, with 46% (12.89 km2). Although urban expansion has been proportionally lower than consolidation in the study area, it does not include the expansion observed in the municipalities of Tamboril, Licey al Medio and Puñal, which are part of the metropolitan area of Santiago de los Caballeros. These three municipalities have totaled an additional expansion of 12 km2.

<text>Gai-Jin (Japanese for &quot;foreigner&quot;) is a 1993 novel by James Clavell, chronologically the third book in his &quot;Asian Saga&quot;, although it was the last to be published. Taking place about 20 years after the events of &quot;Tai-Pan&quot;, it chronicles the adventures of Malcolm Struan, the son of Culum and Tess Struan, in Japan. The story delves deeply into the political situation in Japan and the hostility Westerners faced there, and is loosely based on the Namamugi Incident and the subsequent Anglo-Satsuma War.

==Plot summary==
The story opens with a fictional rendition of the Namamugi Incident. On September 14, 1862, Phillip Tyrer, John Canterbury, Angelique Richaud, and Malcolm Struan are riding on the Tōkaidō, when they are attacked by Shorin Anato and Ori Ryoma, both Satsuma samurai and &quot;rōnin&quot; shishi in the &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; movement, cells of revolutionary xenophobic idealists. Canterbury is killed, Malcolm seriously wounded, and Tyrer receives a minor arm injury; only Angelique escapes back to Yokohama unharmed to get help. Tyrer and Malcolm make their way to Kanagawa (Kanagawa-ku) later that day, where Dr. Babcott operates on Malcolm. Meanwhile, at a village inn in Hodogaya the daimyō Sanjiro of Satsuma, meets with Katsumata, one of his advisors, and receives Ori and Shorin, with whom he plots an overthrow of the current Shogunate. Two days later Malcolm is moved to the merchants&#x27; settlement in Yokohama. He is not expected to last long and while he is in bed sick, he shows his emotions for Angelique, a voluptuous but penniless French girl.

The novel spins two story lines which intertwine with ever increasing complexity: one follows the &quot;gaijin&quot; (foreign) community in Yokohama, the other, the Japanese, both the government (Bakufu) run by a Council of Elders who advise the young Shōgun, and the anti-government, xenophobic, pro-Emperor forces, focusing on the &quot;shishi&quot;. The Japanese distrust the foreigners only slightly more than they distrust each other. The various nationalities that make up the foreign community likewise plot against and socialise with each other warily. Both Japanese and foreigners are convinced of their own superiority.

While Malcolm slowly recovers from his wounds and falls in love with Angelique, she is raped by one of the Japanese samurai assassins, Ori Ryoma, as she lies sedated to treat her shock. Horrified, she keeps this a secret but later discovers she is pregnant. Desperate, she obtains Chinese medicine that precipitates an abortion, with the help of a French spy who later blackmails her with this knowledge. At the same time, she learns her father is a degenerate gambler in jail for debt, and her uncle loses her capital in a failed investment. Marriage to the infatuated Malcolm seems increasingly attractive but she must keep her rape an absolute secret. Obsessed with her, Ori rapes her again. This time, Angelique is not drugged, but she yields and tricks Ori into leaving afterwards instead of killing her, as she knew he intended. He is shot outside her window but no-one suspects he was leaving; it is rumored that he was trying to break in.

Yoshi Toranaga, a descendant of Lord Toranaga in &quot;Shogun&quot; and one of the Council of Elders, narrowly escapes various assassination attempts while he tries to out manoeuvre his fellow councilors, all of whom mistrust each other, as well as hunt down the rogue shishi. He hates the foreigners as passionately as the shishi do, but recognizes that their superior military technology makes &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; impossible for the present. This position puts him at odds with almost everyone around him. A meeting is arranged between the council and the representatives of the foreign community to deal with their demands for reparations and justice for the murderous attack, only one of several such incidents. Despite much Japanese prevarication, and the three-way interpreting necessary (English–Dutch–Japanese), a deal is struck.

Malcolm Struan is heir to the Noble House of Struan&#x27;s, but he is not yet of age and therefore technically not tai-pan. Meanwhile, his mother, Tess Struan, runs the business and urges him to return to Hong Kong and give up his infatuation with this unsuitable penniless French &quot;gold-digger&quot;. Her imperious attitude angers him and he resists, determined to marry Angelique and be taipan.

The brothels of Yokohama are where Japanese and foreigners meet. The French spy is besotted with a Japanese prostitute, whose Madame is associated with the &quot;shishi&quot; and who exchanges favours for information. The French spy introduces Tyrer to the delights and protocols of Japanese brothels. Later, Tyrer befriends a young Japanese and they begin to teach each other, although, unbeknownst to Tyrer, the Japanese is a fanatical &quot;shishi&quot;. He gradually adopts the same position as Lord Yoshi, his implacable enemy: the only way to purge Japan of these revolting barbarians is to learn their military and technological secrets.

Malcolm marries Angelique irregularly on board ship, but dies on their wedding night when his wound hemorrhages. His mother is now officially tai-pan. Angelique is at first hysterical and nearly goes mad. When she recovers, she find she has gained wisdom and an icy calm and lost all fear. She plans to outwit Tess Struan, with the help of Edward Gornt, who hopes to marry her and also obtain revenge on Tess&#x27; family.

Tyrer discovers his &quot;friend&quot; is a dangerous assassin wanted by Lord Yoshi and must be handed over as part of a deal, but the shishi disappears. He hides out with his &quot;sensei&quot; and others in the brothel district. As the government samurai close their net, the sensei decides on a suicide mission: to set fire to the Yokohama settlement and sink the largest foreign ship in the harbour. Tyrer&#x27;s friend is horrified but cannot disobey. The firebombs go off, the shishi saves Tyrer&#x27;s life while the French spy dies in the flames. Though the brothel district and native village are destroyed, the foreign settlement and military camp are relatively undamaged, so the foreigners do not leave, thus subverting the purpose of the arson. To escape certain death and also to further his study of the source of foreign power, the shishi gets himself shipped off to England with Tyrer&#x27;s help.

The story closes with a brief narration of the bombardment of Kagoshima and its aftermath.

==Background==
James Clavell announced in 1981 he wanted to write a novel called &quot;Nippon&quot; which dealt with descendants of the characters from &quot;Shogun&quot; in the era of Perry. However he got distracted writing &quot;Whirlwind&quot; instead and did not get around to his Japanese story until years later.

Clavell later reflected on this period in history:
Because of the opening, the Japanese saw very quickly that they needed to be on equal terms with the Westerners. The Westerners forced their way ashore with their ships and their cannons and their rifles. Very logically, the Japanese said, &#x27;How does a little island nation like Britain, which is smaller than Japan, rule the world?&#x27; A stupid Englishman explained to them, &#x27;Well, you do it with big navies and cannons.&#x27; So the Japanese said, &#x27;Domo.&#x27; And they got together and asked, &#x27;How the hell are we going to get big ships, bigger than them, and cannons?&#x27; What are the Japanese doing now? It&#x27;s all in &#x27;Gai-Jin.&#x27; They&#x27;re doing economically what they could not do militarily. . . . And there&#x27;s the Japanese tradition that the student has the duty to surpass his teacher. But nobody explains that to anybody. So I think if I were Japanese, I would be very teed off to have this Japan-bashing when they&#x27;re only doing what they were told to do. On the American side, I say, &#x27;Hey, let&#x27;s talk about rice, reciprocity, trade imbalance.&#x27; Nobody understands nobody. I&#x27;m hoping that &#x27;Gai-Jin&#x27; and &#x27;Shogun&#x27; and the other books explain.
Clavell says he was &quot;surprised&quot; that the protagonist of the novel turned out to be Malcolm Struan&#x27;s wife Angelique instead of Malcolm. &quot;But you never know how these things are going to turn out. For example, I was expecting Mrs Struan... to arrive from Hong Kong on every damned boat, but she never appeared. That&#x27;s the way it happened.&quot;

Clavell says the death of Malcolm in the book was not planned. &quot;That death frightened me to death&quot;, he said. &quot;The number of people who ring me up saying &#x27;You killed him!&#x27;. I say I didn&#x27;t kill him, so-and-so killed him.&quot;

Clavell said that he did not plot his books. &quot;I write it pretty much as you read it. Of course I may have to go back and change something because of what I have written later, but usually it just runs through. I always have trouble deciding when to stop. I didn&#x27;t know how this was going to end until I got there.&quot;

&quot;Obviously, with 1,700 pages of manuscript, I can&#x27;t keep in all in my head&quot;, he added. &quot;So from time to time I will say to my wife, &#x27;Give me a number from one to 500.&#x27; I then look at the page corresponding to the number she&#x27;s just given me, and see if anything on that page makes me want to know what happens next, or what happened just previously. The magic of storytelling is to want to make people listen breathlessly, if you&#x27;re telling the story orally, or turn the page, if you&#x27;re writing it. That&#x27;s why, at the end of every one of my chapters, there&#x27;s a big fat hook.&quot;

&quot;The only thing that makes a best book – I don&#x27;t like &#x27;bestseller&#x27; – is that somebody tells them&quot;, he said. People who read my books expect to be entertained, to be forced to turn the page, to learn something on route. &quot;Gai-jin&quot; is a very easy way of learning about Japanese characters, characteristics, attitudes toward sex, food and politics, which apply today... If people are going to give me two or three weeks of their time, you have to repay them. I have to entertain them, I have to instruct them, and I have to allow them to learn something.&quot;

==Reception==
The book was a best seller.

==Proposed adaptation==
In 1993 NBC, who had huge success with a TV version of &quot;Shogun&quot;, announced they would broadcast an eight-hour mini series based on the book for the 1994–95 season. The series would have been a co-production between NBC Productions and RCS Video, the Italian-based international producer and distributor. &quot;Gai-Jin will establish a landmark in international television co-productions and a new relation in the industry between the United States and Europe&quot;, said Paolo Gilsenti, managing director of RCS. Clavell and Susan Baerwald were to be executive producers.

Filming was to start February 25, 1995 outside Hiroshima, with a budget of $30 million and a cast including Edward Woodward, Diana Rigg, Ben Cross, Tim Curry and Roddy McDowall and Richard Chamberlain doing the narration. However a week into filming, production was halted. The reason given was an earthquake and rising production costs.

Clavell died in September 1994 and &quot;Gai-Jin&quot; was his last completed novel (he said he was working on a new one after &quot;Gai-Jin&quot; was published).

<text>Javier Otxoa Palacios (30 August 1974 – 24 August 2018) was a Spanish cyclist who was a member of the Kelme cycling team. His name was sometimes spelled Javier Ochoa in media reports.

==Road cycling career==

In 2000 Otxoa won a mountain stage in the Tour de France on top of the Hautacam on a cold and rainy day. He broke away with Nico Mattan with to race and dropped him on the &quot;col de Marie Blanque&quot;. Mattan rejoined him on the descent. Otxoa then dropped him again on the climb to the &quot;col de l&#x27;Aubisque&quot; and rode alone through the &quot;col du Soulor&quot; with nine minutes&#x27; lead as he reached the foot of the Hautacam. He paid for his earlier efforts on the &quot;hors categorie&quot; but held on to finish with 42 seconds advantage Lance Armstrong.

==Accident==

In February 2001 a driver of a car hit him and his twin brother Ricardo during training. Ricardo died. Javier survived but was in a coma for a month and became seriously disabled. He continued cycling, however.

==Paralympics cycling career==

In the 2004 Summer Paralympics he won a gold in the road race/time trial event and a silver in the individual pursuit. Otxoa was disqualified during the preliminary round of the individual pursuit (CP 3) at the 2008 Summer Paralympics, for riding too close behind his opponent, Darren Kenny, who had overtaken him. Kenny stated that he was disappointed by this as he would have liked to compete against Otxoa in the final.

At the time of his death in 2018, Otxoa resided in Alhaurín de la Torre, Málaga.

<doc id="1022685" wikidata="Q2468682" url="?curid=1022685" title="Chitinozoan">
<text>Chitinozoa (singular: chitinozoan, plural: chitinozoans) are a group of flask-shaped, organic walled marine microfossils produced by an as yet unknown organism. Common from the Ordovician to Devonian periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale organisms are abundant in almost all types of marine sediment across the globe. This wide distribution, and their rapid pace of evolution, makes them valuable biostratigraphic markers.

Their bizarre form has made classification and ecological reconstruction difficult. Since their discovery in 1931, suggestions of protist, plant, and fungal affinities have all been entertained. The organisms have been better understood as improvements in microscopy facilitated the study of their fine structure, and it has been suggested that they represent either the eggs or juvenile stage of a marine animal. However, recent research has alternatively suggested that they represent the test of a group of protists with uncertain affinities.

Chitinozoan ecology is also open to speculation; some may have floated in the water column, where others may have attached themselves to other organisms. Most species were particular about their living conditions, and tend to be most common in specific paleoenvironments. Their abundance also varied with the seasons.

==Anatomy==
Chitinozoa range in length from around 50 to 2000 micrometres. They appear dark to almost opaque when viewed under an optical microscope. Their anatomy is based around the broad &quot;chamber&quot;, a radially symmetrical region involving a &quot;central cavity&quot; encased by two layers of a chitin-like substance. The chamber narrows towards the main opening (the &quot;aperture&quot;), though a circular plug prevents direct contact between the central cavity and its surroundings. This plug may be called an &quot;operculum&quot; (if it lies at the tip of the aperture) or a &quot;prosome&quot; (if it lies deep within the narrowed region or &quot;neck&quot;). The rim of the aperture, known as the &quot;collarette&quot;, often has a distinctive form or texture.

The &quot;base&quot; of the chitinozoan lies at the opposite end from the aperture. The base may involve various ornamentation derived from the internal layer. The edge of the base (&quot;basal margin&quot;) may extend into a sharp radial plate, the &quot;carina&quot;. Alternatively, it could send out large spines or branches, known as &quot;processes&quot;. In chitinozoans which attach to substrates or each other in large chains, the center of the base is augmented with &quot;apical structures&quot; which project down to assist attachment.

External ornamentation is often preserved on the surface of the fossils, in the form of hairs, loops or protrusions, which are sometimes as large as the chamber itself. The range and complexity of ornament increased with time, against a backdrop of decreasing organism size. The earliest Ordovician species were large and smooth-walled; by the mid-Ordovician a large and expanding variety of ornament, and of hollow appendages, was evident. While shorter appendages are generally solid, larger protrusions tend to be hollow, with some of the largest displaying a spongy internal structure. However, even hollow appendages leave no mark on the inner wall of the organisms: this may suggest that they were secreted or attached from the outside. There is some debate about the number of layers present in the organisms&#x27; walls: up to three layers have been reported, with the internal wall often ornamented; some specimens only appear to display one such wall layer. The multitude of walls may indeed reflect the construction of the organism, but could be a result of the preservational process.
&quot;Immature&quot; or juvenile examples of chitinozoans have not been found; this may suggest that either they did not &quot;grow&quot;, that they were moults (unlikely), or that the fossilisable parts of the organism only formed after the developmental process was complete. However in 2019 a study found that morphological variation of specimens of &quot;Desmochitina&quot; likely represented a growth series.

Many chitinozoans are found as isolated fossils, but chains of multiple tests, joined from aperture to base, have been reported for all genera. Very long chains twist into helical (spring-shaped) forms. Occasionally, clusters or condensed chains are found, packed in an organic &quot;cocoon&quot;.

==Classification==

Alfred Eisenack&#x27;s original description of the chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack&#x27;s original classification has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification—as can be appreciated by a comparison of the images on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.

The original three families proposed by Eisenack represented the best classification possible with available data, based largely on the presence or absence of chains of organisms and the chamber&#x27;s shape. The orders were subsequently revised to conform better to Linnean taxonomy, placing related organisms more closely together. This was made possible as scientific advances permitted the identification of distinctive traits in organisms across Eisenack&#x27;s groups. Features of the base and neck, the presence of spines, and perforations or connections are now considered the most useful diagnostic features.

Chitinozoans are placed into two orders. The order Operculatifera includes those with an operculum over the aperture and no distinct neck. The order Prosomatifera includes those with a clearly discernable neck and an internal prosome.

==Affinities==

===Young graptolites===

The graptolites are colonial organic walled fossils which also occurred from the Ordovician to the Devonian; only part of their life cycle is known and it is not clear how they reproduced. It has been suggested that the Chitinozoa may represent the pre-sicula stages of graptolites—the period between the colony&#x27;s sexual reproduction, and the formation of a new colony. This hypothesis appears to be supported by the co-occurrence of graptolite and chitinozoan fossils, whose abundances appear to mirror one another. The similar chemical composition of the fossils has been seized by both sides of the argument. Proponents suggest that the use of the same chemical framework is an indicator that the two may be related. However, this factor means that situations favouring the preservation of one will also tend to preserve the other—and the preparation techniques used to extract the fossils will also favour or disfavour the two groups equally. Therefore, the apparent co-occurrence of the two fossils may merely be an artifact of their similar composition. The hypothesis struggles to explain the continuing abundance of chitinozoans after the middle Devonian, when graptolites became increasingly rare.

===Eggs===

The test of the Chitinozoa was fixed—there was no scope for any parts of it to move or rotate. This makes it seem likely that the tests were containers, to protect whatever was inside—whether that was a &quot;hibernating&quot; or encysted organism, or a clutch of hatching eggs.
There are several arguments behind an association of the chitinozoans with annelids or gastropods, and it is not impossible that the chitinozoans are a convergent phenomenon laid by both groups. In fact, the spirally coiled nature of chitinozoan chains has been used to suggest that they were laid by a spirally coiled organism, such as the gastropods; were this inference true, uncoiled chains could be attributed to the (straight) annelid worms or other organisms.

Recent excavations of the Soom Shale, an Ordovician konservat-lagerstätten in South Africa, have yielded chitinozoans alongside a wide range of other organisms. It has been suggested that if whatever organism created the Chitinozoa was fossilisable, it would be present in the Soom —from which gastropods and graptolites are notable in their absence. Most organisms present in the shale can be ruled out for a variety of reasons, but polychaete worms, &quot;Promissum&quot; conodonts and orthocone cephalopods remain as likely candidates. However, further evidence connecting chitinozoans to any of these groups is circumstantial at best.

=== Protists ===
Alfred Eisenack&#x27;s original guess was that the Chitinozoa were amoebae, specifically the rhizopod order Testacea, since similar chitin-based tests were produced by the members of this group. However, the chemistry of these tests differs from that of the fossils, and modern Testacea are almost exclusively fresh-water—an extremely different environment. Within a year, he had abandoned this initial idea.

Arguments put forwards by Obut (1973) proposed that the organisms were one-celled &quot;plants&quot; similar to the dinoflagellates, which would now be grouped into the Alveolata. However, as mentioned previously, spines and appendages are attached from the exterior of the vessel: only animals have the cellular machinery necessary to perform such a feat. Further, no analogy for the cocoon envelope can be found in this kingdom.

The cyst forms of a particular group of ciliates, the tintinnids have been suggested to be affiliated to chitinozoans.

In 2020, exceptionally preserved remains of chitinozoans were described, showing the remains of smaller tests within larger ones, suggesting asexual reproduction.

==Ecology==
It is not immediately clear what mode of life was occupied by these improbably shaped fossils, and an answer only becomes apparent after following several lines of reasoning.

The fossils&#x27; restriction to marine sediments can be taken as sound evidence that the organisms dwelt in the Palæozoic seas—which presents three main modes of life:
* – living within the sediment—the &quot;burrowers&quot;
* – dwelling upon the sea floor, perhaps anchored in place—the &quot;sitters&quot;
* – free-floating in the water column—the &quot;drifters&quot;

An infaunal mode of life can be quickly ruled out, as the fossils are sometimes found in alignment with the depositing current; as nothing attached them to the bottom, they must have fallen from the water column.

The ornament of the chitinozoans may cast light on the question. Whilst in some cases a defensive role—by making the vessel larger, and thus less digestible by would-be predators—seems probable, it is not impossible that the protrusions may have anchored the organisms to the sea floor. However, their low-density construction makes this unlikely: perhaps more plausible is that they acted to attach to other organisms. Longer spines also make the organisms more buoyant, by decreasing their Rayleigh number (i.e. increasing the relative importance of water&#x27;s viscosity)—it is therefore possible that at least the long-spined chitinozoans were planktonic &quot;floaters&quot;. On the other hand, the walls of some chitinozoans were probably too thick and dense to allow them to float.
Whilst little is known about their interactions with other organisms, small holes in the tests of some chitinozoans are evidence that they were hosts to some parasites. Although some forms have been reinterpreted as &quot;pock-marks&quot; caused by the disintegration of the diagenetic mineral pyrite, the clustering of cylindrical holes around the chamber—where the flesh of the organism was likely to be concentrated—is evidence for a biological cause.
Corals in Gotland with daily growth markings have been found in association with abundant chitinozoans, which allow the detection of seasonal variation in chitinozoan abundance. A peak in abundance during the late autumn months is observed, with the maxima for different species occurring on different dates. Such a pattern is also observed in modern-day tropical zooplankton. The diversity of living habits is also reflected by the depth of water and distance from the shore. Different species are found in highest abundance at different depths. While deeper waters around 40 km from the shoreline are generally the optimal environment, some species appear to prefer very shallow water. On the whole, chitinozoans are less abundant in turbulent waters or reef environments, implying an aversion to such regimes when alive, if it is not an effect of sedimentary focusing. Chitinozoans also become rarer in shallower water—although the reverse is not necessarily true. They cannot survive freshwater input.

==Stratigraphic application==
Since Alfred Eisenack first recognised and named the group in 1930, the Chitinozoa have proven incredibly useful as a stratigraphic markers in biostratigraphy during the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian periods. Their utility is due to the rapidity of their morphological evolution, their abundance—the most productive samples bearing almost a thousand tests per gram—and the easy identification (due largely to the large variation in shapes) and short lifetimes (&lt;10 million years) of most species. They are also widely distributed and appear in a variety of marine depositional settings, making correlation easier; better still, they can often be recognised in even quite strongly metamorphosed rocks. However, convergence of morphological form to similar environments sometimes leads to the mistaken identification of a species in several areas separated by vast differences in space and time, but sharing a similar depositional environment; clearly, this can cause major problems if the organisms are interpreted as being the same species. Aside from the acritarchs, chitinozoans were the only reliable means of correlating palæozoic units until the late 1960s, when the detailed study of conodonts and graptolites fully unleashed their stratigraphic potential.

The oldest known chitinozoans appear to be phosphatized remains tentatively referred to the genus &quot;Eisenackitina&quot;. They were recovered from the Middle Cambrian (Stage 5)–age Gaotai Formation, more than 20 million years before the group is found elsewhere in the Ordovician. Chitinozoans appear to have become extinct at the end of the Devonian; rare Carboniferous and Permian remains may represent reworked fossils or fungal spores.

<text>Irbid (), known in ancient times as Arabella or Arbela (Άρβηλα in Ancient Greek), is the capital and largest city of Irbid Governorate. It has the second-largest metropolitan population in Jordan after Amman, with a population of around 2,003,800. As a city, Irbid is Jordan&#x27;s third-largest, after Amman and Zarqa.

Irbid is located about north of Amman on the northern ridge of the Gilead, equidistant from Pella, Beit Ras (Capitolias), and Um Qais, and approximately south of the Syrian border.

Irbid was built on successive Early Bronze Age settlements and was possibly the biblical Beth Arbel and the Arbila of the Decapolis, a Hellenistic league of the 1st-2nd century BCE. The population of Irbid swelled in the late 19th century, and prior to 1948 it served as a significant centre of transit trade.

The city is a major ground transportation hub between Amman, Syria to the north, and Mafraq to the east. The Irbid region is also home to several colleges and universities. The two most prominent universities are Jordan University of Science and Technology and Yarmouk University.

== Name ==
The original spelling was probably ארבאל, a name that also appears in Hosea 10:14. This name persisted among Jews and was later transmitted to the Arabs. Greek sources from the same periods also confirm this, often featuring a final &#x27;a&#x27;, which might indicate an official version of the name.

==History==
Artifacts and graves in the area show that Irbid was inhabited in the Bronze Age. Pieces of pottery and wall stones found at Tell Irbid were estimated to be made in the year 3200 B.C. A city wall dated to around 1300-1200 BC.

* Phase III (c. 3200 BC)
* Phase II (c. 1300-1150 BC)
* Phase I (c. 1150-800 BC)

In the Hellenistic period, Irbid, then known as Arabella was a major trade center. Before the advent of Islam, Arabella was famous for producing some of the best wines in the ancient world. The area in the region had extremely fertile soil and moderate climate, allowing the growing of high quality grapes.

After the Muslim conquests, the city came under the rule of the Rashidun Caliphate and became known as Irbid, at which time it shifted from wine to olive oil production. Wheat was also an important product in the area.

In 1596 it appeared in the Ottoman tax registers named as &quot;Irbid&quot;, situated in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Bani Juhma, part of the Hauran Sanjak. It had 72 households and 35 bachelors; all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products; including wheat (22,500 akçe), barley, summer crops, fruit trees, goats and bee-hives; in addition to a market toll. The total tax was 38,116 akçe.

In 1838, Eli Smith noted Irbid (Arbela) as being a place with Sunni Muslim.

The Jordanian census of 1961 found 44,585 inhabitants in Irbid.

Irbid today combines the bustle of a provincial Middle Eastern town and the youthful nightlife of a typical college town. The city is home to four major universities: Yarmouk University, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid National University and Jadara University. In addition, it is home for two campuses of Balqa Applied University and several private colleges. University Street, which defines the western border of the Yarmouk University campus, is popular with locals as well as with the occasional foreign visitors who stop by to relax in any of its numerous restaurants and cafés that open late into the night.

Though not usually a major tourist destination itself, Irbid is home to two notable museums: the Museum of Jordanian Heritage and the Jordan Natural History Museum, both on the campus of Yarmouk University. Furthermore, Irbid&#x27;s strategic location in northern Jordan makes it a convenient starting point for tourists interested in seeing the northern Jordan Valley; visiting Umm Qais, Beit Ras (Capitolias), Pella, Ajloun, Umm el-Jimal and other historical sites; or traveling on to Syria.

==Geography==

Irbid is situated in northern Jordan, on a fertile plateau. As of 2010, the city of Irbid encompassed an area of 30 km2, with residential areas making up 74.3% of the total area, followed by the Services areas occupying 9.5%, then Empty or unoccupied areas of 7.7%, then 4.2% is classified as Commercial areas, and 3.3% as Industrial areas, and finally gardens occupied 1% of the total city area.

<text>Karel Miloslav Kuttelwascher DFC and Bar (23 September 1916 – 17 August 1959) was a Czech fighter pilot, and a flying ace of the UK&#x27;s Royal Air Force (RAF) in the Second World War. He was in combat service from May 1940 to October 1942, first with the French Air Force and then with the RAF.

Kuttelwascher, nicknamed &quot;Kut&quot;, was the RAF&#x27;s most successful Czechoslovak pilot, and one of the RAF&#x27;s highest-scoring flying aces overall. In RAF service he shot down 18 enemy aircraft. He may also have scored numerous victories in French Air Force service, but these are unconfirmed as many French records were lost.

In 1945 Kuttelwascher returned to Czechoslovakia but in 1946 he returned to Britain, where he made a civilian flying career with British European Airways. He died of a heart attack in 1959, aged 42.

==Early life==
Kuttelwascher was born in 1916 in the village of Svatý Kříž in Bohemia, now part of Havlíčkův Brod in the Czech Republic. He was the third of six children. Their parents Josef and Kristina Kuttelwascher were ethnic Germans from Bavaria. The family name means tripe washer.

Aged 17, Kuttelwascher started work as a clerk at a flour mill in Kladno northwest of Prague. On 1 October 1934, aged 18, he joined the Czechoslovak Air Force. In March 1937, he qualified as a pilot and was posted to 4 Flying Regiment at Kbely airfield near Prague. There he trained as a fighter pilot, completing his training in May 1938. He was posted to 1 Air Regiment, which assigned him to the 32nd Fighter Unit. The unit was posted to defend Czechoslovak airspace over Moravia and Slovakia, but after the Munich Agreement in September 1938, it returned to base at Hradec Králové in northern Bohemia.

Germany occupied Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939 and dissolved the Czechoslovak Air Force the next day. On the night of 13/14 June, Kuttelwascher and six other Czechoslovaks escaped in a coal train from Ostrava in Czech Silesia to Bohumín, a former Czechoslovak town which Poland had annexed in October 1938. The group reported to the Czechoslovak Consulate in Kraków and was accommodated in a Czechoslovak transit camp at Bronowice Małe that had been converted from a disused Austro-Hungarian Army camp.

On 29 July 1939, Kuttelwascher and his group went to the Port of Gdynia, where they embarked on a Swedish cargo steamship, the &quot;Kastelholm&quot;, to travel to France. In Gdynia, a group of Polish officials belatedly tried to persuade the Czechoslovaks to stay and join the Polish Air Force. A few, including another future RAF ace, Josef František, agreed to do so after tossing a coin. The remainder, including Kuttelwascher, stuck to their decision to leave Poland. On 30 July, they disembarked in the Port of Calais in France.

==French service==
Peacetime regulations did not allow the French Air Force to enlist people who were not French citizens. But the Czechoslovak Ambassador in Paris reached agreement with the French Government that Czechoslovak volunteers could join the French Foreign Legion for a five-year term, on the understanding that if war broke out they would be released to form a Czechoslovak army in exile. Kuttelwascher and his group joined the Foreign Legion and were posted to Sidi Bel Abbès in French Algeria for army training and to learn French.
On 3 September 1939, France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. On 17 November, the French Government and Czechoslovak National Liberation Committee agreed that Czechoslovak airmen would be transferred from the Foreign Legion to the French Air Force pending the formation of a Czechoslovak air force. Kuttelwascher was one of about 100 who were sent to the fighter training base at Chartres Aerodrome, where he quickly learnt to fly the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406C.1 fighter. However, he was not transferred to a combat squadron until 17 May 1940, when he was assigned to Groupe de Chasse III/3 at Beauvais–Tillé.

Four days later, GC III/3 moved to Cormeilles-en-Vexin, where it was re-equipped with the more modern Dewoitine D.520C.1 fighter. As German forces advanced in the Battle of France, GC III/3 retreated, first to Illiers-l&#x27;Évêque and then successively to Germinon, Chapelle-Vallon, Montargis, Grand Mallerey, Avord Air Base, and Perpignan-La Salanque.
On 17 June, the UK Foreign Office sent a signal to its Ambassador to France, Sir Ronald Campbell, who had evacuated from Paris to Bordeaux, asking him to give the Czechoslovak General Sergej Ingr an order from President Beneš to evacuate all Czechoslovak personnel and as many aircraft as possible to England. However, in the chaos engulfing France, the order reached few if any Czechoslovak personnel, and Kuttelwascher and his comrades continued to serve with their French units.

Kuttelwascher claimed that, while with the French Air Force, he destroyed or damaged several enemy aircraft. French records for that period are incomplete, but those which survive include two confirmed kills and one probable by Kuttelwascher.

On 22 June 1940, remnants of GC III/3 withdrew to Realizane in Algeria, but that same day France surrendered. The defeated French Air Force discharged its Czechoslovak personnel on 1 July. A group including Kuttelwascher travelled by train to Casablanca in Morocco, where Czechoslovak personnel were assembling to escape to the UK. On 9 July, they left the Port of Casablanca aboard a Scottish ferry, the , which took them to Gibraltar. On 19 July, they sailed from Gibraltar aboard the Elder Dempster Lines ship &quot;David Livingstone&quot;, reaching Cardiff Docks in Wales on 5 August.

==RAF service==

After a short stay in a transit camp, Kuttelwascher joined the RAF on 14 August 1940 with a rank of flight sergeant. He was posted to a Czechoslovak depot at RAF Cosford in Shropshire and then to No. 5 Operational Training Unit at RAF Aston Down in Gloucestershire, where he learnt to fly the Hawker Hurricane.

===Hurricane pilot with No. 1 Squadron===
On 3 October 1940, Kuttelwascher was posted to No. 1 Squadron RAF, which was equipped with the Hurricane Ia. He fought in the latter part of the Battle of Britain. In December, the squadron was moved to RAF Northolt and flew combat missions over northern France. On 2 February 1941, Kuttelwascher may have shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter near Boulogne. On 8 April 1941, he achieved his first confirmed kill in RAF service by shooting down a Bf 109 near Cap Gris Nez. He shot down a second Bf 109 between Calais and Dunkirk on 21 May and a third near Le Touquet on 27 June. By the summer he was promoted to flight lieutenant.
In 1941 at a dance in Ruislip, Middlesex, Kuttelwascher met Beryl Ruby Thomas. They were married in 1942.

On 12 February 1942, No. 1 Squadron attacked German destroyers in the English Channel that were escorting the s and in the Channel Dash. The squadron lost two aircraft, but Kuttelwascher managed to damage one of the destroyers with his Hispano-Suiza HS.404 20mm cannon.

No. 1 Squadron was relocated to RAF Tangmere in West Sussex and assigned a new role: night intruder sorties over France. These were missions by single aircraft to shoot down German bombers over their own airfields. Their Hurricanes lacked radar so the sorties were made only with a full moon. They were dangerous missions, demanding both navigation and flying skills, excellent vision and great courage.
The squadron was then operating the Hawker Hurricane Mk IIc, painted black for night flying. Each aircraft was equipped with two 45-gallon under-wing auxiliary tanks that extended its airborne time to three to 3½ flying hours and gave a range of about . Armament was two Hispano-Suiza 20mm cannon on each wing, but with only 91 rounds of ammunition. This was enough for only about nine seconds of firing time.

Kuttelwascher&#x27;s Hawker Hurricane IIc was serial number BE581 and carried the code letters &quot;JX-E&quot;. It also carried a personal emblem of a yellow scythe with a red banner emblazoned &quot;Night Reaper&quot;. Kuttelwascher had the greatest number of successful strikes of any night intruder.

On the night of 1/2 April 1942, Kuttelwascher scored his first victories as a night intruder, shooting down one Junkers Ju 88 fighter-bomber and damaging a second, both near Melun. On the night of 16/17 April, he shot down a Dornier Do 217 bomber near Saint-André-de-l&#x27;Eure. His next victories were a Do 217 and a Ju 88, both near Rouen-Boos. On the night of 30 April/1 May, he shot down a Do 217 near Rennes and a Heinkel He 111 bomber off the coast near Dinard. On the night of 4/5 May near St-André, Kuttelwascher shot down three He 111s within four minutes.
On the night of 2/3 June, Kuttelwascher shot down a Do 217 off Dunkirk. The next night near St-André, he shot down two He 111s and a Do 217 and damaged a second Do 217. On the night of 21/22 June, again near St-André, he shot down an Ju 88 and damaged a second. On the night of 28/29 June 1942 Kuttelwascher shot down a Do 217E-4 of VII/Kampfgeschwader 2 at Trévières in Normandy, killing all the crew. On the night of 1/2 July near Dinard he shot down two Do 217s and damaged a third.

No. 1 Squadron destroyed 21 enemy aircraft in three months. Of these, Kuttelwascher had shot down 15 and damaged another five. For this he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and news media nicknamed him the Czech Night Hawk.

Kuttelwascher&#x27;s exploits were a great morale booster for his countrymen back home. Josef Josten, who was looking after the BBC&#x27;s military services in Czech, arranged for them to be broadcast, including a personal interview.

===Subsequent RAF service===

On 8 July 1942, Kuttelwascher was assigned to No. 23 Squadron RAF at RAF Ford, not far from Tangmere, to continue night intruder missions. This squadron flew the de Havilland Mosquito Mk II, which was equipped with H2S radar. Kuttelwascher&#x27;s navigator was P/O GE Palmer. In August and September the pair flew six intruder missions over France and the Netherlands, but did not manage to shoot down any enemy aircraft.

In October 1942, Kuttelwascher was withdrawn from combat flying and transferred to the Czechoslovak Air Inspectorate in London. From June to December 1943, he spent six months in the US and Canada, primarily to try to recruit Czech and Slovak Americans and Canadians to join Czechoslovak units of the UK armed forces. He also gave lectures about the air war in Europe to the United States Army Air Forces and Royal Canadian Air Force.

On his return, Kuttelwascher was posted to No. 32 Maintenance Unit at RAF St Athan in Wales. There he served as a test pilot on various types of bomber until the end of the war.

==Later life==

By the end of the war, Karel and Ruby had a son and twin daughters. Kuttelwascher returned to Czechoslovakia in August 1945, followed shortly after by his wife and children. He transferred back to the Czechoslovak Air Force, was promoted to Staff Captain and was posted to Ruzyně near Prague. A month later, he returned to his former base of Hradec Králové as an instructor at the Air Force Academy there.

Ruby did not adapt to life in Czechoslovakia and Kuttelwascher&#x27;s air force service there, and in January 1946 she returned to England. Kuttelwascher became concerned about the growing power of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia under Soviet patronage in the Third Czechoslovak Republic. He applied for a visa to return to the UK, which was eventually granted. On 21 May 1946, he resigned from the air force and five days later, on the day of the Czechoslovak general election, returned to Britain.

Back in the UK, Kuttelwascher initially flew light aircraft to maintain his skills. He then joined British European Airways as a first officer. Karel and Ruby divorced in 1951. In 1955, Kuttelwascher started a greengrocery business, but continued to fly. He became a naturalised UK subject in January 1956. In the same year, he was promoted to captain.

On 13 August 1959, Kuttelwascher was on holiday in St Austell, Cornwall, when he suffered a heart attack. He was admitted to the local hospital, but on the night of 17 August he suffered a fatal second heart attack. He is buried at Uxbridge, Middlesex.

==Achievements and honours==
Kuttelwascher had 18 confirmed air victories during the war. In 1942 Air Vice-Marshal Karel Janoušek rated him as one of &quot;The greatest figures among our fighter pilots&quot;.

Kuttelwascher&#x27;s true total may have been higher. A number of 20 is often quoted, including aircraft he shot down when in the French Air Force in 1940. Kuttelwascher was the RAF&#x27;s highest-scoring Czechoslovak pilot, most effective night intruder and sixth-most-successful night fighter. Other RAF night intruder pilots flew mostly radar-equipped aircraft.

===Awards===
Kuttelwascher was awarded Czechoslovak, UK and French decorations:
: Czechoslovak War Cross 1939–1945 five times
: &quot;Československá medaile Za chrabrost před nepřítelem&quot; (&quot;Bravery in Face of the Enemy&quot;)
: &quot;Československá medaile za zásluhy, 1. stupně&quot; (&quot;Medal of Merit, First Class&quot;)
: &quot;Pamětní medaile československé armády v zahraničí&quot; (&quot;Commemorative Medal of the Czechoslovak Army Abroad&quot;) with France and Great Britain Bars&quot;
: Distinguished Flying Cross and bar
: 1939–1945 Star with Battle of Britain clasp
: Air Crew Europe Star
: Defence Medal
: War Medal 1939–1945
: French Croix de Guerre with one palm and one silver star

Posthumously the Czech Republic promoted Kuttelwascher to Brigadier General in 2000 and awarded him the Order of the White Lion in 2016. There are now monuments to him in his home village of Svatý Kříž, and a street named &quot;Kuttelwascherova&quot; after him in the Černý Most suburb of Prague. In 2017, the Czech Mint issued silver and gold commemorative coins (under the authority of Niue) paying tribute to Karel Kuttelwascher.

===Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Hurricane===
In 2005 the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire painted its Hawker Hurricane PZ865 with the &quot;JX-E&quot; code letters in honour of Kuttelwascher and his &quot;Night Reaper&quot; Hurricane BE581.

<text>Captain Horatio Hornblower is a 1951 British naval swashbuckling war film in Technicolor from Warner Bros., produced by Gerry Mitchell, directed by Raoul Walsh, that stars Gregory Peck, Virginia Mayo, Robert Beatty and Terence Morgan.

The film is based on three of C. S. Forester&#x27;s Horatio Hornblower novels: &quot;The Happy Return&quot; (1937), &quot;A Ship of the Line&quot; (1938), and &quot;Flying Colours&quot; (1938). Forester is credited with the screen adaptation.

==Plot==
In 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars, Royal Navy Captain Horatio Hornblower is given command of the 38-gun frigate HMS &quot;Lydia&quot; and tasked with a secret mission to Central America: he is to provide arms and support to a local warlord, Don Julian Alvarado, who has organized a rebellion against the colonial authorities of Spain, an ally of Britain&#x27;s enemy France. Alvarado turns out to be a bloodthirsty megalomaniac who calls himself &quot;El Supremo&quot; (&quot;The Almighty&quot;). Hornblower also learns that a much more powerful warship, the 60-gun &quot;Natividad&quot;, is en route to suppress the rebellion. When it anchors nearby, Hornblower and his crew board and capture it in a surprise night attack. He then reluctantly surrenders the ship to Alvarado over his own personal feelings of disgust towards the man, and they go their separate ways.

A Spanish lugger then delivers news to &quot;Lydia&quot; that Spain has switched sides, and Hornblower must deal with Alvarado personally. Two passengers board the &quot;Lydia&quot; (over Hornblower&#x27;s strenuous objections): Lady Barbara Wellesley and her maid, fleeing a yellow fever epidemic. As Lady Barbara is the (fictitious) sister of the Duke of Wellington (Historically, Wellesley, in 1807, was not yet the 1st Duke of Wellington as this title was only bestowed upon him in 1814), Hornblower cannot refuse her request for passage to England.

Using superior seamanship and masterful tactics, Hornblower sinks the more powerful &quot;Natividad&quot;, killing Alvarado and ending the rebellion. When the &quot;Lydia&#x27;s&quot; surgeon is killed during the battle, Lady Barbara insists on tending the wounded. She falls gravely ill as a result and Hornblower nurses her back to health. On the voyage back to England, they fall in love. However, when she speaks of her feelings (although she is engaged), Hornblower gently tells her he is married. Later, they meet in a passageway and embrace passionately. She promises her maid&#x27;s discretion, but he says that they are not free.

After arriving home, Hornblower learns that his wife has died in childbirth, leaving him an infant son. Later, he is given command of the &quot;Sutherland&quot;, a 74-gun ship of the line captured from the French and is assigned to a squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Leighton. Leighton has just returned from his honeymoon with Lady Barbara. Outside the Admiralty, Lady Barbara tells Hornblower that she did not learn of his wife’s death until she returned from Ireland. Leighton&#x27;s squadron is ordered to help enforce the British blockade of France.

Hornblower learns that four French ships of the line have broken through the blockade. Leighton assumes they will make for the Mediterranean, but Hornblower suggests that they mean to support Napoleon&#x27;s campaign on the Iberian Peninsula. Leighton decides to cover both possibilities by detaching one ship to patrol the French coast. When he learns that Hornblower&#x27;s &quot;Sutherland&quot; is best suited for this task, having the shallowest draught, he accuses Hornblower of pursuing glory and prize money and gives him strict orders not to engage the French without first summoning the rest of the fleet.

Hornblower&#x27;s French-built ship is subsequently mistaken for a friendly vessel by a small French brig, which flies the enemy&#x27;s recognition signal for the day. After capturing the vessel, Hornblower learns from its captain that he is correct: the four ships plan to sail to Spain. In violation of his orders, Hornblower enters the enemy harbor where the French ships are anchored and guarded by a well-armed fort. By flying a French flag, using the recognition signal, and taking advantage of his ship&#x27;s French design, Hornblower fools the garrison into believing that the &quot;Sutherland&quot; is friendly. His gun crews dismast all four enemy ships before cannon fire from the fort forces the British to abandon ship. Hornblower scuttles his ship in the channel, bottling up the French ships before he and his surviving crew are taken captive.

As the rest of the British squadron arrives to complete the job, Hornblower, his first officer Bush, and &quot;Sutherland&quot; coxswain Quist are sentenced to hang for piracy in the center of Paris. They manage to escape and make their way to the port of Nantes, where they crash a party and commandeer the uniforms of three Dutch customs officers so they can board the &quot;Witch of Endor&quot;, a captured British ship. They overpower the skeleton crew, free a working party of British prisoners of war to man her and sail to England.

Hornblower is hailed as a national hero but learns that Leighton lost his life in the attack on the French fleet. The commander returns home to visit his young son and finds Lady Barbara there. The two embrace.

===Casting===
Warner Bros. acquired the film rights to the first three Hornblower novels – &quot;The Happy Return&quot;, &quot;A Ship of the Line&quot;, and &quot;Flying Colours&quot; – as a star vehicle for Errol Flynn when they were first published. For reasons that may have included the financial failure of the 1948 &quot;Adventures of Don Juan&quot;, the growing difficulties of working with the actor, and/or his advancing age, Flynn was not cast. Warner&#x27;s was already building up Burt Lancaster as their new swashbuckling screen star, but the role of a British sea captain seemed to be outside his range, so Peck was ultimately cast on a loan-out from David O. Selznick, who received screen credit in the opening titles. Virginia Mayo was only cast after a number of high-profile British actresses were either not free or not interested. Peck&#x27;s personal choice was Margaret Leighton. Studio head Jack Warner found Virginia Mayo more attractive.

==Production==
The film was shot at studios inside the United Kingdom, on Mermaid Street in Rye, East Sussex, at and also on location in France. El Supremo&#x27;s Fortress is Fort de Brégançon in France. To save costs, the &quot;Hispaniola&quot; set from the 1950 Disney film adaptation of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; was reused as the frigate HMS &quot;Lydia&quot;. Instead of moving the horizon background in order to simulate movement on the water, the ship itself was rocked. This caused many problems because of the combined weight of ship, crew, and equipment. The Italian brigantine &quot;Marcel B. Surdo&quot; represented the &quot;Witch of Endor&quot; for all at-sea exterior footage. The &quot;Marcel B. Surdo&quot; would also appear in such seafaring films as &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot;, &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot;, and &quot;John Paul Jones&quot;. The explosive and fire effects were supervised by Cliff Richardson.

==Premiere and reception==
The film had its worldwide premiere in the presence of Princess Margaret at the Warner Theatre, Leicester Square, London on 12 April 1951. The premiere was in aid of King George&#x27;s Fund for Sailors and the &quot;Foudroyant&quot; appeal (the presently restored frigate renamed afloat in the Historic Quay, Hartlepool, UK).

Bosley Crowther, critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said it has &quot;plenty of action ... It may be conventional action, routine in pattern and obviously contrived, with less flavor [of the books] in it than of the workshops of Hollywood. However, it should please those mateys who like the boom of the cannon and the swish of the swords.&quot; The movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall. Bob Thomas said it &quot;is excellent adventure stuff ... the dialogue and action can be stilted at times. But there is enough eye-catching excitement and color to offset that.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote that &quot;Walsh&#x27;s direction has no time to linger. Guy Green&#x27;s camerawork and Robert Farnon&#x27;s jolly score are helpful.&quot;

According to Warner Bros&#x27; accounts, the film earned $2,598,000 domestically and $2,735,000 foreign. It was the studio&#x27;s most expensive film of the year but also their most popular. It was the 9th most popular film at the British box office that year.

The film has been well-received by modern critics. The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives it 7.3 out of 10 and a 100% &quot;fresh&quot; rating.

==Other versions==
Peck and Mayo recreated their roles on a one-hour &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; program broadcast on 21 January 1952, which is included as an audio-only feature in the film&#x27;s DVD release.

==Home media==
On March 6, 2007, Warner Home Video released the film on DVD in its original aspect ratio of 1:37:1.

<text>Frederick Chapman Robbins (August 25, 1916 – August 4, 2003) was an American pediatrician and virologist. He was born in Auburn, Alabama, and grew up in Columbia, Missouri, attending David H. Hickman High School.

He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1954 along with John Franklin Enders and Thomas Huckle Weller, making Robbins the only Nobel laureate born in Alabama. The award was for breakthrough work in isolating and growing the poliovirus in tissue culture, paving the way for vaccines developed by Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin. He attended the University of Missouri and Harvard University.

In 1952, he was appointed professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University. Robbins was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1962. From 1966 to 1980, Robbins was dean of the School of Medicine at Case Western. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1972. In 1980, he assumed the presidency of the National Academy of Sciences&#x27; Institute of Medicine. He had been a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1972. Five years later, in 1985, Robbins returned to Case Western Reserve as dean emeritus and distinguished university professor emeritus. He continued to be a fixture at the medical school until his death in 2003. The medical school&#x27;s Frederick C. Robbins Society is named in his honor. His wife, Alice N. Robbins, died in 2016. She was the daughter of Nobel laureate John Howard Northrop.

Robbins received the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences of the American Philosophical Society in 1999.

<text>Cassop (formerly New Cassop) is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Cassop-cum-Quarrington, in the County Durham district, in the ceremonial county of Durham, England. It has a population of about 500 and is located near the city of Durham. A former mining village, mining is no longer the main occupation of Cassop&#x27;s inhabitants due to extensive mine closure over the last 30 years.

Cassop Primary School is believed to have been the first in the UK to generate some of its own electricity with its own wind turbine which was erected in February 1999.
== History ==
Cassop was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Kelloe, from 1866 Cassop was a civil parish in its own right, on 24 March 1887 the parish was abolished and merged with Quarrington to form &quot;Cassop cum Quarrington&quot;. In 1881 the parish had a population of 596.



== Religious sites ==
The church of St. Paul, Cassop cum Quarrington was built in 1868. The stones that were used in its construction were allegedly transported by William Smith, innkeeper of the Half Moon Inn, Quarrington Hill, as he was the only villager to own such a cart to make this possible. It was closed during the 1980s and is now demolished. Services for the parish are held at Bowburn. The churchyard is still used for burials.

<doc id="1022715" wikidata="Q16259282" url="?curid=1022715" title="Starhawk (1979 video game)">
<text>Starhawk is a 1979 vector arcade game designed and programmed by Tim Skelly and manufactured by Cinematronics. &quot;Starhawk&quot; is a shoot &#x27;em up unofficially based on the &quot;Star Wars: Episode IV&quot; trench run, one of the first arcade games to blatantly use concepts from &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The game was unique at the time for its pseudo-3D graphics. It was distributed in Japan by Sega, and was later ported for the Vectrex home system in 1982.

The arcade cabinet had a cinder block placed inside of it, to prevent it from tipping onto the player.

==Plot==
According to the Vectrex manual, the story involves &quot;protecting your comrades from alien ships trying to infiltrate your culture&quot; and &quot;defending the sovereignty of your planet&quot;.

==Gameplay==
Various ships, reminiscent of TIE fighters, appear on the horizon of the trench and the player has to shoot them before they destroy the player&#x27;s ship. The player is given initially sixty seconds, but additional twenty seconds is awarded for every 10,000 points scored. The player continues flying down the trench towards a target similar to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Death Star target. The game gets progressively more difficult as the player advances. Similar to the flying saucer from &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, a command ship periodically appears and shoots at the player. If the command ship is not destroyed quickly, the player loses 800 points.

Besides the firing button, there are three buttons that control the speed of the crosshairs.

===Scoring===
* Command ship: 800
* Starship: 500
* Rocket: 300
* Missile: 100
* Bomber: 100

==Reception==
&quot;Starhawk&quot; was the fifth highest-earning arcade video game of 1979 in the United States, below &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, &quot;Football&quot;, &quot;Sprint 2&quot; and &quot;Head On&quot;.

<text>Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth (March 4, 1932 – April 4, 2001) was an American artist, cartoonist, illustrator, pinstriper and custom car designer and builder who created the hot rod icon Rat Fink and other characters. Roth was a key figure in Southern California&#x27;s Kustom Kulture and hot rod movement of the late 1950s and 1960s.
However a book was published (Monté. King of Atom-Age Monster Decals” by Bill Selby) some of the designs Ed Roth claimed to be his own art were proven in fact not to be. Rat Fink is an example of the many designs. The true creator of Rat Fink along with a few other decal designs was Don Monteverde.

==Early life==
Roth was born in Beverly Hills, California. He was the son of Marie (Bauer) and Henry Roth. He grew up in Bell, California, attending Bell High School, where his classes included auto shop and art.

At age 14, Roth acquired his first car, a 1933 Ford coupe. He studied engineering at a Los Angeles college, then served in the United States Air Force, and by the early &#x27;50s, was experimenting with fibreglass modelling.

== Career ==


Roth is best known for his grotesque caricatures—typified by Rat Fink—depicting imaginary, out-sized monsters driving representations of the hot rods that he and his contemporaries built. Roth began airbrushing and selling &quot;Weirdo&quot; T-shirts at car shows and in the pages of &quot;Car Craft&quot; magazine as early as July 1958. By the August 1959 issue of &quot;Car Craft&quot; &quot;Weirdo shirts&quot; had become a full-blown craze with Roth at the forefront of the movement. The article featured Roth along with fellow Kustom Kulture pioneers Dean Jeffries and Pete Millar. Inspired by Roth and Barris Kustoms (whose shirts were airbrushed by Dean Jeffries), Detroit native Stanley Miller, a.k.a. &quot;Stanley Mouse&quot;, began advertising his own shirts in the pages of &quot;Car Craft&quot; in January 1961. The lesser-known Rendina Studios of Detroit and Mad Mac of Cleveland also joined in on the monster &quot;Weirdo&quot; shirt craze, but Roth was certainly the person who widely popularized the &quot;monsters in hot rods&quot; art form.

In 1959 Roth created the Outlaw. This fiberglass Kustom hot rod was featured in the January 1960 issue of &quot;Car Craft&quot;. The car was covered in &quot;Car Craft&quot; and &quot;Rod and Custom&quot;, and appeared at custom car and hot rod shows. Other hot rods include the Beatnik Bandit (1961), the twin Ford engined Mysterion (1963), the Orbitron (1964), and the Road Agent (1965), among others. In 1965, Roth&#x27;s surf buggy, the Surfite, was featured in the film &quot;Beach Blanket Bingo&quot; starring Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, and also in &quot;Village of the Giants&quot;, featuring Beau Bridges and Tommy Kirk. One of Roth&#x27;s personal drivers was a tangerine orange 1955 Chevy 2-door post with a Ford 406 cu. in. engine under the hood; he drove this car to his shop every day for years.

In 1962 the Revell model company began selling plastic models of Roth&#x27;s cars and from 1963 to 1965 Revell also manufactured plastic models of many of Roth&#x27;s monsters, including Rat Fink, Brother Rat Fink, Drag Nut, Mother&#x27;s Worry, Mr. Gasser and other weird creatures created by Roth. Revell continues to re-issue Roth&#x27;s Monsters and Kustom Car kits.

In 1963 The Hawk Model Company issued its line of &quot;Weird-Oh&#x27;s&quot; plastic models and Marx Toys issued Nutty Mads, both clearly inspired by Roth&#x27;s work. Both items were quite popular in the mid-60s and remain sought after collector&#x27;s items to this day. Hawk Models continues to re-issue its &quot;Weird-Oh&#x27;s&quot; periodically.

A “corporate publicist” gave the tall Roth the nickname &quot;Big Daddy&quot;.

Numerous artists were associated with Roth including artist David Mann, &quot;Rat Fink Comix&quot; artist R.K. Sloane, Steve Fiorilla who illustrated some of Roth&#x27;s catalogs, and most notably, Ed Newton, who worked for Roth and designed several of his cars and T-shirt designs beginning in 1964, and Kustom Kulture icon Robert Williams who began working for Roth in late 1965.

In the mid 1960s Roth began customizing motorcycles. Mainstream motorcycle magazines refused to run his articles and ads, so he started his own publication called &quot;Choppers&quot;, which featured articles on extending forks, custom sissy bars, etc. It was a small, black and white publication that ran from 1967 to 1970, and was the first magazine ever to exclusively feature custom motorcycles, or choppers. Roth also built the first known VW powered trike. Roth built many trikes for himself and others, including Candy Wagon, California Cruiser, Secret Weapon, Rubber Ducky and The Great Speckled Bird.

In 1967 Roth built the Mega Cycle, Originally named by Robert Williams, &quot;Captain Pepi&#x27;s Motorcycle &amp; Zeppelin Repair&quot; was later changed to the &quot;Mega Cycle&quot; after a strong suggestion from car show promoters. Powered by a Buick V6 engine, Mega Cycle was designed to carry Ed&#x27;s Harley XLCH. Later Ed felt that the XLCH just did not work and, through a series of trades, ended up with Bob Aquistapase&#x27;s award-winning Triumph. The Mega Cycle is currently on display at Motorcyclepedia Museum in Newburgh, NY.

In 1968 Mattel introduced Hot Wheels and Roth’s Beatnik Bandit was one of the first 16 die-cast toy cars produced by the company.

From 1970 to 1975, Roth worked for Brucker&#x27;s Movie World and their &quot;Cars of the Stars&quot; display. Brucker said that Roth was very loyal and a very hard worker, even though he was not making much money. Brucker said that when building something, Roth had a natural knack for seeing how things fit together — he would build something in a few days which would take others a couple of weeks. Although Roth was laid-back and amiable, Brucker also remembers that Roth was a fighter and if anyone came through the museum causing trouble, Roth would put them in line. He was fearless. Roth&#x27;s Druid Princess was one of the many cars displayed there. Also during the 1970s, Roth worked for Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm as a sign painter and artist. He worked there for 10 years until about 1980, and among other things, did the lettering on many of the descriptive labels for objects in the Western Trails Museum at Knott&#x27;s.

In December 1977, Robert and Suzanne Williams, along with Skip Barrett, organized the first Rat Fink Reunion to celebrate the legacy of Roth. Rat Fink Reunions are still held to this day at the site of Roth&#x27;s final residence in Manti, Utah and near Los Angeles.

In 1993, a major exhibition was held at the Julie Rico Gallery in Santa Monica shortly after the Laguna Museum show &quot;Kustom Kulture&quot;. It was at this time that the lowbrow art movement began to take on steam. Featured in the exhibition titled, &quot;Rat Fink Meets Fred Flypogger Meets Cootchy Cooty&quot; were Roth, Willams, and Mouse and their creations. The L.A. Times placed Roth&#x27;s Rat Fink on the cover of the Culture section December 20, 1993, with a full article about the entire exhibition. Artist Jean Jacques Bastarache collaborated with Ed Big Daddy Roth for this exhibition creating paintings called Master Finks. Images were used from historical watershed paintings by well-known artists like Duchamp, Whistler and Miro among others. Roth drew an image of his Rat Fink character acting out in a funny way on each painting while Jean Jacques Bastarache created the Master Fink underlying painting. The paintings in all can be seen in the book titled Rat Fink: The Art of Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth published by Last Gasp in 1993.

The Orbitron, a Roth custom car that was the subject of a number of articles in automotive enthusiast magazines (most notably, in &quot;Car Craft&quot; magazine in 1965) which was feared lost in subsequent decades, was discovered in Mexico in the summer of 2008. The Orbitron was built in 1964. The car, in dilapidated, inoperative condition, had been parked for some time in front of an adult bookstore in Ciudad Juárez. The owners of the shop were also the owners of the car. It was purchased and taken back to the United States by Michael Lightbourn, an American auto restorer who did business in Mexico. The Orbitron has been restored to its original condition by Beau Boeckmann.

Roth was active in counterculture art and hot-rodding his entire adult life. At the time of his death in 2001, he was working on a hot-rod project involving a compact car planned as a departure from the dominant tuner performance modification style.

The year after his death, he was named as one of the &quot;50 Who Made a Difference&quot; at the 50th annual Meguiar&#x27;s Autorama in Detroit. He was also inducted into the show&#x27;s &quot;Circle of Champions&quot; in 2000, and was showcased as its &quot;Builder of the Year&quot; in 2006.

==Mr. Gasser &amp; the Weirdos==
Mr. Gasser &amp; the Weirdos was a 1960s novelty music group led by Roth, who was known as Mr. Gasser. Formed in the early 1960s, they released a few bizarre surf rock albums, most notably 1963&#x27;s &quot;Hot Rod Hootenanny&quot;. One Way Records released a two-CD set (S22-18319) containing the three LPs and the original artwork.

==Roth and bikers==
Roth had his shop, that he started in early 1959, at 4616 Slauson Avenue in Maywood, California (about 8 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles). He ran an ad in &quot;Car Craft&quot; magazine that year announcing the new address of his shop.

During the mid 1960s, Roth associated with various outlaw motorcycle clubs who congregated at his shop as a lot of bikers were then living in Lynwood and Maywood. Musicians, police officers, FBI agents and various people involved in Hollywood would visit as well, providing an environment for one of Ed Roth&#x27;s most creative periods, and an important time in Kustom Kulture.

Roth incorporated the Iron Cross into his artwork (surfers had previously been using the iron cross as a symbol of youthful, carefree rebellion). Roth did not own a bike at the time, so he bought a brand-new Harley-Davidson Sportster and then proceeded to paint its gas tank a flat black color. Roth painted white lettering on one side of the tank that said: &quot;Love is Hate&quot;; and on the reverse side: &quot;Hate is Love&quot;.

Roth had taken black and white photos of different bikers. He made posters, with titles like &quot;Beautiful Buzzard&quot;, or &quot;Gray Cat&quot; out of these photos, and sold them at car shows. Roth would periodically give these bikers small amounts of money, but soon some of the bikers started to feel that Roth was &quot;getting rich&quot; off of them and they wanted a larger cut. Despite Roth&#x27;s agreement, rumors began to circulate that a certain club intended to attack Roth&#x27;s shop. The gang arrived at the shop with guns drawn, but Roth&#x27;s crew defended themselves. Roth challenged the head biker to a one-on-one fist fight to settle matters in the middle of the shop. Eventually Roth gained the upper hand and &quot;just started to beat the living crap out of the guy&quot;.

After this incident, Roth burned his biker posters, leaving the lifestyle behind. Things started winding down at the shop in the late 1960s, and in 1970 the shop closed.

==Personal life==
Roth was married four times. His fourth wife, Ilene, lives in Manti, Utah, where Roth spent the final years of his life. Roth joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1974. He shaved off his goatee and was heavily involved in social work through the church. His brother Gordon also became a Latter-day Saint.

At a 1999 lecture given at Brigham Young University&#x27;s Museum of Art, Roth shared some lessons he had learned in life: &quot;accept criticism; if you can&#x27;t do it get help; you don&#x27;t need fancy tools or a fancy garage; and if you fulfill your duty Heavenly Father will bless you in what you do.&quot;

Roth died of a heart attack on April 4, 2001, at the age of 69.

Since his death, the official Rat Fink Reunion has been held in Manti the first weekend in June. The museum that Ilene Roth created to honor her late husband includes displays of Roth&#x27;s art work and other memorabilia. Roth&#x27;s son Darryl has been working on collecting and displaying his father&#x27;s work.

<doc id="1022719" wikidata="Q7676143" url="?curid=1022719" title="Tailypo">
<text>Tailypo is a creature of North American folklore, particularly in Appalachia. Alternate names include Taileybone, Taileybones, Tailbones, Tallie Tale, Taily Po, Taileypo and Tailipoe.

== Creature ==
The Tailypo is usually said to be the size of a dog. Depending on the storyteller, it has yellow or red eyes, a long tail, and pointed and/or tufted ears like a bobcat. It is nocturnal, covered in dark fur to blend into its environment. It only attacks with its claws, suggesting it is not a &quot;versatile&quot; demon or spirit, but it can and does speak in some form of English, meaning it can&#x27;t simply be an animal.

It speaks some English, demanding the return of its tail (the actual phrase varies from version to version, but always repeats).

== Setting ==
The story is almost always set at night in a heavily wooded rural area. Geographically the setting is accepted to be somewhere in the American South. The events could feasibly occur at any time period, given the isolation and atmosphere of the tale.

The main events occur in a log cabin deep in the woods where a hermit and his three dogs live.

== Story ==
During a season of considerable hunger and a lack of suitable game, the tale begins with a hermit and his three hounds. The man is out at night, looking for the evening meal, and manages to shoot a small hare, which he shares with his dogs. Understandably still hungry, the man presses on and discovers a bizarre shape with bright eyes and a long tail. The hermit quickly shoots at the creature, severing its tail. Screaming, the creature runs off into the darkness and the man eats the tail, either raw or in stew.

On the brink of sleep, a rustling and clawing wakes the man. Sitting up, the hermit is able to see the gleaming eyes of the Tailypo leering at him from the foot of his bed. In an otherworldly voice, the creature demands the return of its &quot;tailypo&quot;. Terrified, the man calls for his hounds, which immediately come to his aid, chasing the beast off into the night.

With the creature chased back into the woods, two of the hermit&#x27;s dogs return, but one remains missing. The man tries to sleep, but the Tailypo soon returns, beckoning even more forcefully for the return of its tail. Again, the man sics his hounds on the Tailypo, and again, one is missing upon the return of the survivor. Unable to sleep, the man clutches his weapon (usually a gun of some kind) and waits for dawn, his remaining dog nearby. When the Tailypo appears for the third time, the man once again orders the hound to attack the Tailypo. Predictably, the dog chases the creature away and does not return.

The man, now left with no real protection, having exhausted his three hounds, cowers under his bedsheets, praying for dawn. Hours before daybreak, the man hears the familiar rustling sound, hoping that it is one of his dogs. Unfortunately, the man is leapt upon by the Tailypo and is either disarmed or has dropped his weapon in terror. The beast is now eye-to-eye with the man, and it demands once more the return of his &quot;tailypo&quot;.

Most commonly, the man is described as being flayed beyond recognition by the Tailypo. In less explicit versions, all that remains of the cabin is the chimney. Either way, it is understood that the Tailypo has exacted revenge for the loss of its tail. During the darkest of nights, the creature can be heard whispering for its &quot;tailypo&quot; (or claiming, whisperingly, that it has gotten its &quot;tailypo&quot; back).

== Variations ==
The Tailypo legend has countless variations, many of which are passed down orally. The theme of a hungry man and his dogs hunting for food by their old cabin is constant. However, the methods used by the man to defend himself vary from axes to rifles. Also, the man&#x27;s dogs sometimes simply get &quot;lost&quot; or just flee in fright, instead of being eaten or killed by the Tailypo. Sometimes, the dogs chase the creature into a swamp and then disappear, with the suggestion that they were lured into the swamp to be killed. In some variants, the Tailypo does actually enter the cabin through a hole in the floor, as opposed to being found in the woods. The season is accepted to be late Autumn but this too varies. Usually, these variations depend most heavily on the target audiences, with grisly embellishments removed for younger listeners. In some versions, the man&#x27;s dogs are named (in order of disappearance) Uno, Ino, and Cumptico-Calico.

== Analysis ==
The legend has been described as revolving around common anxieties for rural families in Appalachia, such as the fear of isolation or famine. It can also be seen as a cautionary tale, teaching children not to abuse animals.

<text>John Alexander McCone (January 4, 1902 – February 14, 1991) was an American businessman and government official who served as Director of Central Intelligence from 1961 to 1965, during the height of the Cold War.

== Background ==
John A. McCone was born in San Francisco, California, on January 4, 1902. His father ran iron foundries across California, a business founded in Nevada in 1860 by McCone&#x27;s grandfather. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1922 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, beginning his career in Los Angeles&#x27; Llewellyn Iron Works. He rose swiftly and in 1929, when several works merged to become the Consolidated Steel Corporation, he became executive vice president. He also founded Bechtel-McCone.

He also worked for ITT. In 1946, the General Accounting Office implied that McCone was a war profiteer, stating that McCone and his associates of the California Shipbuilding Corporation had made $44 million on an investment of $100,000. McCone&#x27;s political affiliation was with the Republican Party.

McCone served for more than twenty years as a governmental adviser and official, including positions on the Atomic Energy Commission in the Eisenhower Administration in 1958–1961 and with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the Kennedy Administration and the Johnson Administration in 1961–1965.

However, it would be his service in 1950–1951, as the second United States Under Secretary of the Air Force, that McCone got his first taste of duty in the senior levels of the U.S. Government during the Truman Administration.

== Atomic Energy Commission ==
In 1958, he became chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. According to journalist Seymour Hersh, in December 1960, while still Atomic Energy Commission chairman, McCone revealed CIA information about Israel&#x27;s Dimona nuclear weapons plant to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Hersh writes that President John F. Kennedy was &quot;fixated&quot; on the Israeli nuclear weapons program and one of the reasons that contributed to McCone&#x27;s appointment as CIA director was his willingness to deal with this and other nuclear weapons issues – and despite the fact that McCone was a conservative Republican.

==Director of Central Intelligence==

After the disaster of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, President John F. Kennedy forced the resignation of CIA director Allen Dulles and some of his staff. McCone replaced Dulles as DCI on November 29, 1961.

He married Theiline McGee Pigott on August 29, 1962, at St. Anne&#x27;s Chapel of the Sacred Heart Villa in Seattle, Washington.

McCone was not Kennedy&#x27;s first choice; the President had tentatively offered the job to Clark Clifford, his personal lawyer, who politely refused (Clifford would later serve as Secretary of Defense for Lyndon Johnson); and then to Fowler Hamilton, a Wall Street lawyer with experience in government service during the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. Hamilton accepted, but when a problem developed at the Agency for International Development, he was shifted there. Thus Kennedy, urged on by his brother Robert, turned to McCone.

McCone was a key figure in the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM) during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. In the Honeymoon telegram of September 20, 1962, he insisted that the CIA remain imaginative when it came to Soviet weapons policy towards Cuba, as a September 19 National Intelligence Estimate had concluded it unlikely that nuclear missiles would be placed on the island. The telegram was so named because McCone sent it while on his honeymoon in Paris, France, accompanied not only by his bride, Theiline McGee Pigott but by a CIA cipher team.

McCone&#x27;s suspicions of the inaccuracy of this assessment proved to be correct, as it was later found out the Soviet Union had followed up its conventional military buildup with the installation of MRBMs (Medium Range Ballistic Missiles) and IRBMs (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles), sparking off the crisis in October when they were later spotted by CIA&#x27;s Lockheed U-2 surveillance flights.

While McCone was DCI, the CIA was involved in many covert plots; according to Admiral Stansfield Turner (who himself later served as DCI from 1977 to 1981, under President Jimmy Carter), these included:

McCone was also involved in the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état; he was friends with ITT president Harold Geneen whose company stood to lose its Brazilian subsidiary if president João Goulart nationalized it. McCone would later work for ITT.

McCone represented the CIA&#x27;s opposition to U.S. support of a coup in South Vietnam against President Ngo Dinh Diem, but such objections were overruled by November 1963, when the State Department managed to convince Kennedy to allow the coup to proceed.

In 1964, he was awarded the Hoover Medal.

McCone resigned from his position of DCI in April 1965, believing himself to be unappreciated by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who, he complained, would not read his reports, including on the need for full-fledged inspections of Israeli nuclear facilities. Before his resignation, McCone submitted a final memorandum regarding the war in Vietnam to President Johnson, arguing that Johnson&#x27;s plan of attack was too limited in scope to successfully defeat the Hanoi regime; he further asserted that public support (in the United States and abroad) for any effort in North Vietnam would erode if the plan went unchanged:

== Other ==
Throughout his career, McCone served on numerous commissions that made recommendations on issues as diverse as civilian applications of military technology and the Watts Riots.

In 1987, McCone was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan.

== Death ==
John A. McCone died on February 14, 1991, of cardiac arrest at his home in Pebble Beach, California. He was 89 years old.

== Honors and awards ==
*McCone Hall at the University of California, Berkeley campus is named in McCone&#x27;s honor.

== In popular culture ==
McCone was portrayed in several different docudramas about the Cuban Missile Crisis, by Keene Curtis in the television production &quot;The Missiles of October&quot; (1974) and Peter White in the theatrical film &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; (2000). In the biographical television film &quot;Path to War&quot; (2002), he is played by Madison Mason. In the 2020 film &quot;The Courier&quot;, he is played by Željko Ivanek. In the film &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011) he was played by Matt Craven. &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops&quot; feature an unnamed DCI modeled physically after McCone.

<doc id="1022738" wikidata="Q1093194" url="?curid=1022738" title="Cisco Discovery Protocol">
<text>Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a proprietary data link layer protocol developed by Cisco Systems in 1994 by Keith McCloghrie and Dino Farinacci. It is used to share information about other directly connected Cisco equipment, such as the operating system version and IP address. CDP can also be used for On-Demand Routing, which is a method of including routing information in CDP announcements so that dynamic routing protocols do not need to be used in simple networks.

==Operation==
Cisco devices send CDP announcements to the destination MAC address , out each connected network interface. These multicast frames may be received by Cisco switches and other networking devices that support CDP into their connected network interface. This multicast destination is also used in other Cisco protocols such as Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) Trunking Protocol (VTP). By default, CDP announcements are sent every 60 seconds on interfaces that support Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) headers, including Ethernet, Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). Each Cisco device that supports CDP stores the information received from other devices in a table that can be viewed using the &quot;show cdp neighbors&quot; command. This table is also accessible via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The CDP table information is refreshed each time an announcement is received, and the hold time for that entry is reinitialized. The hold time specifies the lifetime of an entry in the table - if no announcements are received from a device for a period in excess of the hold time, the device information is discarded (default 180 seconds).

The information contained in CDP announcements varies by the type of device and the version of the operating system running on it. This information may include the operating system version, hostname, every address (i.e. IP address) from all protocol(s) configured on the port where CDP frame is sent, the port identifier from which the announcement was sent, device type and model, duplex setting, VTP domain, native VLAN, power draw (for Power over Ethernet devices), and other device specific information. The details contained in these announcements is easily extended due to the use of the type–length–value (TLV) frame format. See external links for a technical definition.

==Support==
Hewlett-Packard removed support for transmitting CDP from HP Procurve products shipped after February 2006 and all future software upgrades. Receiving and processing CDP information is still supported. CDP support was replaced with IEEE 802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), an IEEE standard that is implemented by multiple vendors and is functionally similar to CDP.

Several other manufacturers, including Dell and Netgear have used the brand-neutral name (ISDP) to refer to their implementations of a CDP-compatible protocol.

CDP was the abbreviation used by Cabletron who wrote the for the discovery protocol.

<text>James Brendan Patterson (born March 22, 1947) is an American author. Among his works are the &quot;Alex Cross&quot;, &quot;Michael Bennett&quot;, &quot;Women&#x27;s Murder Club&quot;, &quot;Maximum Ride&quot;, &quot;Daniel X&quot;, &quot;NYPD Red&quot;, &quot;Witch &amp; Wizard&quot;, &quot;Private&quot; and &quot;Middle School&quot; series, as well as many stand-alone thrillers, non-fiction, and romance novels. Patterson&#x27;s books have sold more than 425 million copies, and he was the first person to sell one million e-books. In 2016, Patterson topped &quot;Forbes&quot; list of highest-paid authors for the third consecutive year, with an income of $95 million. His total income over a decade is estimated at $700 million.

In November 2015, Patterson received the Literarian Award from the National Book Foundation. He has donated millions of dollars in grants and scholarship to various universities, teachers&#x27; colleges, independent bookstores, school libraries, and college students to promote literacy.

==Early life==
James Patterson was born on March 22, 1947, in Newburgh, New York, the son of Isabelle (), a homemaker and teacher, and Charles Patterson, an insurance broker. The family was working-class and of Irish descent. Patterson graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a B.A. in English from Manhattan University and with an M.A. in English from Vanderbilt University.

==Career==
Patterson was a PhD candidate at Vanderbilt when he took a job as an advertising executive at J. Walter Thompson. After Patterson retired from advertising in 1996, he devoted his time to writing. Patterson later said that his greatest influence was probably Evan S. Connell&#x27;s 1959 debut novel &quot;Mrs. Bridge&quot;. In 1976, Patterson published his first novel, &quot;The Thomas Berryman Number.&quot; The novels featuring his character Alex Cross, a forensic psychologist formerly of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation who now works as a private psychologist and government consultant, are his most popular and the top-selling U.S. detective series of the 2010s. Patterson has written more than 200 novels since 1976. Patterson has had more than 114 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling novels, and holds &quot;The New York Times&quot; record for most #1 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers by a single author – 67 – which is also a Guinness World Record. His novels account for one in 17, roughly 6%, of all hardcover novels sold in the United States; as of 2010, Patterson&#x27;s novels had in recent years sold more copies than those of Stephen King, John Grisham, and Dan Brown combined. His books have sold approximately 305 million copies worldwide. In 2008, Patterson replaced Jacqueline Wilson as the most borrowed author in Britain&#x27;s libraries. He retained this position at least until 2013. In 2018, Patterson worked with Stephen David Entertainment on the true crime television series &quot;James Patterson&#x27;s Murder Is Forever&quot;.

Patterson&#x27;s awards include the Edgar Award, the BCA Mystery Guild&#x27;s Thriller of the Year, the International Thriller of the Year award, and the Children&#x27;s Choice Book Award for Author of the Year. He is the first author to have No. 1 new titles simultaneously on &quot;The New York Times&quot; adult and children&#x27;s bestsellers lists, and to have two books on NovelTrackr&#x27;s top-ten list at the same time. In 2019, Patterson was awarded a National Humanities Medal. He appeared on the Fox TV show &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (in the episode &quot;Yokel Chords&quot;) and in various episodes of &quot;Castle&quot; as himself.

Patterson works with a variety of co-authors, such as J.D. Barker, Candice Fox, Maxine Paetro, Andrew Gross, Mark Sullivan, Ashwin Sanghi, Michael Ledwidge, and Peter de Jonge. In May 2017, it was announced that Patterson would also co-author a crime fiction book with former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Patterson said the novel, &quot;The President Is Missing&quot;, would provide a level of detail that only a former U.S. president can offer. Patterson has often said that collaborating with others brings new and interesting ideas to his stories. Of his process, Patterson has said that he is simply more proficient at dreaming up plots than crafting sentence after sentence.

In September 2009, Patterson signed a deal to write or co-write 11 books for adults and six for young adults by the end of 2012. &quot;Forbes&quot; reported the deal was worth at least $150 million, but according to Patterson, the estimate was inaccurate.

Patterson founded the James Patterson PageTurner Awards in 2005 to donate over $100,000 that year to people, companies, schools, and other institutions that find original and effective ways to spread the excitement of books and reading. The PageTurner Awards were put on hold in 2008 to focus on Patterson&#x27;s new initiative, ReadKiddoRead.com, which assists parents, teachers, and librarians in finding books for their children. The social networking site for ReadKiddoRead is hosted by Ning. The website is inspired by methods Patterson used with his own son, Jack, who had been a reluctant reader. Patterson has also set up the James Patterson Teacher Education Scholarship in the schools of education at Appalachian State University, Michigan State University, Florida Atlantic University, and the University of Florida. Patterson also ran the College Book Bucks scholarship program. In 2020, his JP Entertainment company signed a first-look deal with Entertainment One.

In June 2022, Patterson apologized on Facebook for his accusations of racism after saying in an interview that older white males find it difficult to find work in film, theater, television and publishing, and that the problem is &quot;just another form of racism.&quot; Patterson&#x27;s publishing house, Hachette, has a workforce that is 65% white and 78% of senior positions are filled by white people. Following publication of data confirming that white males are overrepresented in the publishing field, Patterson said: &quot;I apologize for saying white male writers having trouble finding work is a form of racism. I absolutely do not believe that racism is practiced against white writers. Please know that I strongly support a diversity of voices being heard—in literature, in Hollywood, everywhere.&quot; 

In March 2023, Patterson signed an exclusive first-look deal with Skydance Television.

==Reception==
Patterson has been criticized for co-authoring many of his books and for being more of a brand that focuses on making money than an artist who focuses on his craft.

In an interview for&quot; USA Weekend&quot;, Stephen King said Patterson was &quot;a terrible writer but he&#x27;s very successful.&quot; King also implied, when asked on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; about how many hours it takes him to write a book, that Patterson needed only 12 hours for two books, noting he and Patterson had &quot;a mutual respect—sort of.&quot; Patterson said of King in a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; interview, &quot;He&#x27;s taken shots at me for years. It&#x27;s fine, but my approach is to do the opposite with him—to heap praise.&quot;

Legal thriller writer Lisa Scottoline said in a review of Patterson&#x27;s &quot;Kill Alex Cross&quot;, &quot;They used to say that 50 million Elvis Presley fans couldn&#x27;t be wrong, and James Patterson makes 50 million fans look like a good start. He has sold more than 230 million books, and his fans aren&#x27;t wrong, either.&quot;

In 2013, Patterson took out ads titled &quot;Who Will Save Our Books? Our Bookstores? Our Libraries?&quot; in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, which employed the text: &quot;If there are no bookstores, no libraries, no serious publishers with passionate, dedicated, idealistic editors, what will happen to our literature? Who will discover and mentor new writers? Who will publish our important books? What will happen if there are no more books like these?&quot; Patterson called the ads an attempt to &quot;stir the pot a little bit.&quot; &quot;Digital Book World&quot; called the ads &quot;refreshing, really. And brave.&quot; Maureen Sullivan, president of the American Library Association, told the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; she was writing Patterson a thank-you letter.

In 2017, digital humanities scholars Simon Fuller and James O&#x27;Sullivan published research showing that Patterson does not do much actual writing when collaborating with other authors. O&#x27;Sullivan writes: &quot;Patterson is all about story... &#x27;author&#x27;, in its widely accepted sense, isn&#x27;t always the most appropriate term for his role within the writing process.&quot; O&#x27;Sullivan later conducted the same analysis on &quot;The President Is Missing&quot;, a collaboration between Patterson and Bill Clinton; here O&#x27;Sullivan concludes that Patterson did most of the writing, aside from the end of the novel.

=== Book banning ===
In March 2023, Patterson&#x27;s &quot;Maximum Ride&quot; series were banned from two elementary school libraries in Florida&#x27;s Martin County School District and placed in their middle school libraries. Patterson criticized the move, calling it a &quot;borderline absurd decision&quot;. He encouraged readers to &quot;send a polite note&quot; to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in response to legislation passed to seek community input on school library materials.

==Personal life==
Patterson and his wife, Susan, live in Palm Beach, Florida. They have a son, Jack, who was born on February 8, 1998.

In 2015, Patterson established the James Patterson Pledge with Scholastic Book Clubs to put books in the hands of young readers.

<text>Sir James Alexander Lougheed, ( or ; 1September 18542November 1925) was a businessman, lawyer and politician from Alberta, Canada. He served as a senator for 35 years, and held a number of Cabinet positions.

==Early life==
Lougheed was born in the village of Tullamore, in Chinguacousy Township, Canada West, which is now part of Brampton, Ontario. Tullamore was home to many first-generation, Protestant, Irish-Canadians from the south part of county Sligo. The son of Irish-Protestant parents Mary Ann (Alexander) and John Lougheed, the family moved to Weston (now a community within Toronto, Ontario) when Lougheed was a child, and he attended King Street Public School (now H. J. Alexander Public School) and Weston High School (now Weston Collegiate Institute). He attended the University of Toronto and he studied law at the Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto and was sworn in as a solicitor in 1881. In 1887 he formed a law practice with Peter McCarthy and two years later in 1889 he became a QC.

In 1882 Lougheed moved with his brother to Winnipeg, Manitoba, and then to Medicine Hat, North-West Territories, following the newly laid Canadian Pacific Railway main line. One year later he moved to Calgary, then at the end of the CPR line.

He started a legal practice in Calgary in the fields of real estate and transportation law, with the CPR as one of his main clients. He also invested heavily in real estate and opened a brokerage firm. His Lougheed Building in downtown Calgary still stands: it included the GRAND theatre which was saved from demolition in 2004 by the Company Theatre Junction The Grand.

In 1884 James Lougheed married Belle Hardisty (1859–1936), daughter of William Hardisty and Mary Anne Allen, of the Chinook people of the Pacific Northwest.

She was a niece of Richard Hardisty (whom James Lougheed replaced in the Senate in 1889) and Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal. In 1891 they built &quot;Beaulieu&quot; (now Lougheed House), a mansion in what is now the Beltline district of Calgary. Beaulieu became the centre of Calgary&#x27;s social scene, as the Lougheeds welcomed oil millionaires, politicians, royalty, and entertainment stars to their home. He and Belle had six children, four boys and two girls.

==Political career==
Lougheed had been a member of the federal Conservative Party since his days in Toronto, and had campaigned for Sir John A. Macdonald. Even so, his appointment to the Senate on 10 December 1889 (replacing Richard Hardisty, his wife&#x27;s uncle, who had died) came as a surprise to many, as Lougheed was only 35 years old at the time. However, he gained the respect of both his fellow senators and his fellow Westerners due to his staunch support of Western interests and his political abilities. Lougheed spent the next 30 years living both in Ottawa and in Calgary.

In order to protect his legal interests, he brought a young lawyer from New Brunswick named R. B. Bennett — later to become Prime Minister of Canada — to Calgary in 1897. Bennett and Lougheed worked together for over 20 years until an acrimonious dispute between the senator and the future prime minister caused each to go his own way.

In the 1890s Lougheed emerged as the West&#x27;s strongest voice in the Senate. He was constantly in the position of having to remind members of the Upper Chamber of the realities of life in the western provinces and territories (Alberta at the time being part of the Northwest Territories). He spoke out fiercely against certain provisions in the act creating the province of Alberta, and declared that it would be better to remain a territory than to have what he called archaic education statutes forced on the province.

In 1906, he became Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. The Conservatives were in opposition for many of Lougheed&#x27;s early years as a senator.

When the Conservatives took power following the 1911 election, he became Leader of the Government in the Senate and minister without portfolio in the government of Sir Robert Borden. He was made Chairman of the Military Hospitals Commission in 1915, and, as a reward for this service, was knighted by George V in 1916 (Order of St Michael and St George), becoming the only Albertan to ever earn the honour.

After Borden formed his wartime Union government, he appointed Lougheed as Minister of Soldiers&#x27; Civil Re-establishment in 1918. From 1920 until the Conservative Party&#x27;s defeat in the 1921 election, Lougheed also served as Minister of Mines, Minister of the Interior and Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs in the government of Prime Minister Arthur Meighen.

With the Liberals in power, Lougheed resumed his position as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate until his death in 1925, aged 71.

Lougheed was a strict conservative in many ways. His relationship to the First Nations people could be both patriarchal and supportive. Generally, he held the virtually ubiquitous Western view that First Nations people were essentially unintelligent children who needed white control in order to survive; this even though his own mother-in-law was from a First Nation. However, when Indian Affairs officials refused to allow the six Nations to participate in the first Calgary Stampede in 1912, Lougheed with R.B. Bennett fought that decision. He adhered to a strict interpretation of the British North America Act, was against women voting, disliked social innovations, and believed Canada&#x27;s future was as a subordinate nation in the British Empire.

Lougheed was also a successful businessman through his real estate, newspapers, and other ventures in Calgary. He was a staunch advocate of provincial status for what became Alberta and argued that the province rather than the federal government should have control of natural resources. This argument was carried on by his grandson, Peter Lougheed, when he was premier of Alberta in the 1970s and 1980s.

==Death==
Sir James Lougheed died of pneumonia on 2 November 1925 at the age of 71 in the Ottawa Civic Hospital, and was buried in Union Cemetery in Calgary at the Lougheed family plot on 8 November 1925. Lougheed&#x27;s funeral at Calgary&#x27;s Anglican Church was unable to accommodate the number of people who came to pay tributes. James Lougheed and other members of the Lougheed family are buried at Union Cemetery in Calgary.

James Lougheed died only four days after the 1925 Canadian federal election, in which his Conservative Party under Arthur Meighen returned to power with a minority government.

<text>Paris–Nice is a professional cycling stage race in France, held annually since 1933. Raced over eight days, the race usually starts with a prologue in the Paris region and ends with a final stage either in Nice or on the Col d&#x27;Èze overlooking the city. The event is nicknamed &quot;The Race to the Sun&quot;, as it runs in the first half of March, typically starting in cold and wintry conditions in the French capital before reaching the spring sunshine on the Côte d&#x27;Azur. The hilly course in the last days of the race favours stage racers who often battle for victory. Its most recent winner is American Matteo Jorgenson.

One of the iconic races of cycling, Paris–Nice is part of the UCI World Tour and is the competition&#x27;s first stage race in Europe each season, starting one day before its italian counterpart, the Tirreno-Adriatico/Race of the Two Seas. It is organized by ASO, which also manages most other French World Tour races, most notably cycling&#x27;s flagships the Tour de France and Paris–Roubaix. The roll of honour features some of cycling&#x27;s greatest riders, including French riders Louison Bobet, Jacques Anquetil and Laurent Jalabert, Low Country riders Eddy Merckx and Joop Zoetemelk who each won the race three times, and Spaniards Miguel Induráin and Alberto Contador. The most successful rider is Ireland&#x27;s Sean Kelly, who claimed seven consecutive victories in the 1980s.

During the 2003 edition, Kazakh rider Andrey Kivilev died as a result of a head injury sustained in a crash. His death prompted UCI to mandate the use of helmets in all competitions of cycling, except for the last part of a race with an uphill finish. The rule was later changed to require helmets at all times.

The 2020 Paris–Nice was the last international cycling event, as well as the last sporting event in France, before mass gatherings were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==

===Creation===

Paris–Nice was created in 1933 by Parisian media mogul Albert Lejeune, in order to promote his Paris-based newspaper &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; and Nice-based paper &quot;Le Petit Niçois&quot;. The race linked the French capital with the fashionable seaside city of Nice on France&#x27;s Mediterranean coast. It was held in March, at the end of winter, as one of the earliest French bike races on the calendar, immediately following the Six-day racing season on the track.

The first Paris–Nice comprised six stages and was promoted as &quot;Les Six Jours de la Route&quot; (). The first stage ran from Paris to Dijon and, with a distance of 312 km, remained the longest stage in the history of Paris–Nice. As most mountain roads were still impassable because of its early calendar date, the route avoided the Alps and primarily followed the lower Rhône Valley, with the only significant climbs on the last day on the outskirts of Nice. The inaugural edition was won by Belgian Alphonse Schepers, who wore the leader&#x27;s jersey from the first until the last day.

The race was a success and was continued annually until 1939. Other newspapers from Southern France, &quot;Lyon Républicain&quot; and &quot;Marseille-Matin&quot;, partnered with Lejeune&#x27;s titles to sponsor the race. In 1939, &quot;Ce Soir&quot; and &quot;Le Petit Nice&quot; were joined by &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;. Maurice Archambaud became the first two-fold winner. In 1940, the race was cancelled for the duration of World War II. Race founder Lejeune was sentenced to death and executed after the liberation of France in 1945.

In 1946 &quot;Ce Soir&quot; again organized the first post-war race, but although the event was a commercial success, the newspaper dropped its sponsorship and the race was discontinued between 1947 and 1950.

===The Race to the Sun===
In 1951 the race was revived as &quot;Paris-Côte d&#x27;Azur&quot; by Jean Medecin, the mayor of Nice, who wanted to promote tourism to his fast-growing city and the entire Côte d&#x27;Azur. It was organized by weekly magazine &quot;Route et Piste&quot;. The name &quot;Paris–Nice&quot; was restored in 1954. The event&#x27;s status grew in the 1950s from an early-season preparation and training race to an event in its own right, spawning illustrious winners as Louison Bobet and Jacques Anquetil. In 1957 journalist Jean Leulliot, race director since 1951, bought the event with his company &quot;Monde Six&quot; and became Paris–Nice&#x27;s new organizer.
In 1959 the race was run as &quot;Paris–Nice–Rome&quot;, with a separate classification from Paris to Nice, a second from Nice to Rome in Italy and a third overall. The excessive length of the race — in 11 days — was criticized, and the formula was not repeated. In 1966 Paris–Nice was the scene of a rivalry between French cycling icons Jacques Anquetil and Raymond Poulidor, whose legendary emulation divided French cycling fans for a decade. Anquetil won his fifth and final Paris–Nice, surpassing Poulidor on the final stage to Nice.

In 1969, the final stage was moved from the seaside promenade in Nice to the top of the Col d&#x27;Èze hill overlooking the city. Young Eddy Merckx won the final time trial and won his first of three consecutive Paris–Nices. Raymond Poulidor was once again runner-up; Jacques Anquetil completed the stellar podium in his last showdown. In 1972 &quot;eternal second&quot; Poulidor ended the &quot;Cannibal&#x27;s&quot; streak by winning the final time trial and narrowly finishing ahead of Merckx. The next year, he repeated this feat at the age of 37.

In the 1980s Ireland&#x27;s all-round specialist Sean Kelly won the race seven consecutive times from 1981 the winning record to date. The &quot;Race to the Sun&quot; produced several other foremost winners in the 1990s, notably Spanish Grand Tour specialist Miguel Induráin and Swiss Tony Rominger. French allrounder Laurent Jalabert won the race three consecutive times, the last time in 1997, and is still the last French winner to date. In 2000, former cyclist Laurent Fignon took over the organisation of the race from the Leulliot family. In 2002, he sold Paris–Nice to ASO.

===World Tour Race===

The 2003 race was marred by the death of Kazakh rider Andrei Kivilev after a crash on the second stage. Kivilev did not wear a helmet and died that night as a result of brain trauma. The following day the peloton, led by Kivilev&#x27;s Cofidis team, neutralized the third stage. Racing resumed the next day, and in the fifth stage to the Mont Faron, Kivilev&#x27;s friend and compatriot Alexander Vinokourov produced a solo victory and crossed the line holding a picture of his late friend.

In 2005 Paris–Nice was included in the inaugural UCI Pro Tour, but was at the center of a dispute between UCI and ASO just before the 2008 edition. On 7 March 2008, two days before the start, UCI president Pat McQuaid announced that all teams starting the race would be suspended by the UCI. That day, the teams&#x27; association (AIGCP) decided by a majority-against-minority vote to participate in the race. The issue was eventually resolved and since 2011 Paris–Nice serves as the European opening race of the UCI World Tour.

In 2012 England&#x27;s Bradley Wiggins won the race, as part of his build-up to the Tour de France. Wiggins was the ninth rider who won the &quot;Race to the Sun&quot; prior to winning the Tour de France. In the last ten years, Spaniard Alberto Contador and Australian Richie Porte have won the race twice.

The 2020 Paris–Nice was the last international cycling event, as well as the last sporting event in France, before mass gatherings came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race was held with buffer zones to restrict public access and was reduced to seven stages as a response to the worsened situation in the early weeks of March. German Max Schachmann won the overall classification after leading the race since the first stage.

==Route==

For many decades, the route of Paris–Nice has developed a traditional and recognizable format. The race starts on Sunday, most often with a prologue time trial near Paris, followed by a series of road stages southwards across France. Due to France&#x27;s geography, the early stages are usually flat and suited for sprinters, before moving further south towards the Provence region. The latter, southern part of Paris–Nice normally contains several hilly to mountainous stages, which are the decisive portions of the race. The final stage on Sunday is either a road stage finishing on Nice&#x27;s Promenade des Anglais or an uphill time trial on the Col d&#x27;Èze just outside Nice. Known as &quot;The Race to the Sun&quot;, Paris–Nice is often considered a mini-Tour de France, where riders need to be both competent time-trialists and capable of climbing mountains.

Despite this format, some editions occasionally had more unorthodox courses. The 2014 edition was an unusual race with no time trials or summit finishes. In 2015 organizers returned to the traditional format, starting in Yvelines, west of Paris, before moving south. The key stages were the summit finish to the Col de la Croix de Chaubouret in France&#x27;s Massif Central on stage 4 and the concluding time trial on Col d&#x27;Eze. The 2016 edition included dirt road sectors in the first stage of the race and a passage on the lower slopes of Mont Ventoux in the fifth stage.

===Starts===
Until 1962, the race began in the city of Paris. Since 1963, organizers have usually preferred to start in smaller towns and suburbs on the outskirts of Paris or even well outside the French capital. Most editions started in the Paris region of Île-de-France, including nine from Issy-les-Moulineaux and six from Fontenay-sous-Bois. In 1982, the race started with a prologue in Luingne, Belgium; the event&#x27;s only foreign start. Four other municipalities outside the Île-de-France have hosted the start: Villefranche-sur-Saône in 1988, Châteauroux in 1996, Nevers in 2001 and Amilly in 2008. The last time Paris–Nice started in Paris was in 2000, with a prologue in the Bois de Vincennes.

===Finishes===
Paris–Nice has always finished in Nice and has only had three different finish locations on its territory. The seven pre-war editions finished on the &quot;Quai des États-Unis&quot; (Quay of the United States), before moving to the illustrious Promenade des Anglais (Promenade of the English) in 1946. From 1969 to 1995 the race finished with a time trial up the Col d&#x27;Èze, except in 1977 when landslides had blocked the road. The Col d&#x27;Èze is a 9 km climb, starting from Nice and climbing to 507 m altitude. It is named after the village of Èze, part of the municipality of Nice. Sean Kelly won the Col d&#x27;Èze time trial five times in his seven-year dominance.

In 1996, the finish was moved back to the Promenade des Anglais because of the low number of spectators on Col d&#x27;Èze and to take advantage of funding from the city of Nice. In 1996 and 1997 the final stage was a flat time trial in the streets of Nice, won by Chris Boardman and Viatcheslav Ekimov respectively. From 1998 to 2011, the final stage was a road race – usually on a hilly terrain with the climbs of the Col d&#x27;Èze and La Turbie – starting and ending in Nice. In recent years the race often returns to a final Col d&#x27;Èze time trial stage. Bradley Wiggins set a new climbing record in 2012 of 19&#x27; 12&quot; on his way to overall victory.

==Jersey colours==
Since 2008, the overall leader has worn a yellow jersey. At the creation of the race in 1933, the leader&#x27;s jersey was blue and gold, evoking the Mediterranean sunny sky. In 1946, the leader&#x27;s jersey was green. In 1951, the organization opted for a yellow jersey with orange piping; before changing to all-white from 1955 to 2001. In 2002, after the race was obtained by ASO, the leader&#x27;s jersey was yellow and white, before changing it to yellow in 2008, reflecting the Tour de France leader&#x27;s jersey. In 2018, the yellow jersey features a white bar (same style as the Critérium du Dauphiné yellow jersey).

The points classification leader&#x27;s jersey has been green since 2008. It was green from 1954 to 1984, and there was no points classification from 1985 to 1996. The points jersey was pink and purple in 2000 and 2001, and green and white from 2002 to 2007.

The King of the Mountains jersey has white with red polka dots, as in the Tour de France, since the race&#x27;s takeover by ASO. The classification was introduced in 1952 and the jersey colour changed several times. In the 1970s it was yellow and red; later, it was white and purple. In 1984 the jersey became yellow and blue (the colors of sponsor Crédit Lyonnais); the following year, it was blue. Agrigel became its sponsor in 1990, and changed the colors to yellow and blue.

The best young rider&#x27;s jersey was introduced in 2002, when it was blue and white. It has been white since 2007.

* France holds the record of most wins per nation, but no Frenchman has been victorious since Laurent Jalabert in 1997.
* Twelve winners on the roll of honour have also won the Tour de France in their careers: Louison Bobet, Jacques Anquetil, Jan Janssen, Eddy Merckx, Joop Zoetemelk, Stephen Roche, Miguel Induráin, Alberto Contador, Bradley Wiggins, Geraint Thomas, Egan Bernal and Tadej Pogačar. All bar Pogacar won their first or only Paris–Nice before they had won the Tour de France.

<text>Simtek (Simulation Technology) was an engineering consultancy firm and Formula One racing team. The Formula One (F1) engineering consultancy arm, Simtek Research, was founded in 1989 by Max Mosley and Nick Wirth. It originally was involved in many areas of Formula One, including wind tunnel construction and chassis building for third parties. Simtek Grand Prix, the racing team, was launched in 1993 and competed in the 1994 and 1995 seasons, achieving a best result of ninth place. With large debts and a lack of sponsorship money, Simtek went into voluntary liquidation in June 1995.

==Simtek Research==
Simtek Research was founded in August 1989 by Nick Wirth, Max Mosley and Donald Hughes, aiming to provide a cost-effective design, research and development service to the highest possible standards. The company was initially based out of an office in Wirth&#x27;s home with one employee, engineer Darren Davis. The company grew quickly and moved to its own facility, including a windtunnel, on the Acres Industrial Estate in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Simtek&#x27;s clients included the FIA, F1 constructors Ligier and numerous Formula 3000 and Indycar teams.

In 1990 Simtek designed a Formula One car for BMW who were making plans to found a works team. The project was aborted, and BMW instead entered the German Touring Car Championship (Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft) in 1991, the BMW 3 Series cars being run by Simtek engineers. The BMW F1 car design was revived, updated and sold to Andrea Moda Formula to compete in the 1992 season. In 1992, after becoming president of the FIA, Mosley sold his share in Simtek to Wirth.

In 1993, Simtek were commissioned to design a car for the new Bravo F1 team, but the plans were scrapped after the sudden death of Bravo&#x27;s project backer, Jean-François Mosnier.

==Formula One==

===1994===
In August 1993, Nick Wirth took the decision to enter Formula One with his own team for the 1994 season. Triple world champion Jack Brabham became a shareholder in Simtek Grand Prix, and his son David Brabham was signed as a driver before the end of 1993. Andrea de Cesaris and Gil de Ferran, both carrying sponsorship money, were initially considered for the second seat but negotiations broke down. Frenchman Jean-Marc Gounon was also considered, but already had commitments for the start of the season so eventually 33-year-old F1 rookie Roland Ratzenberger took the place. Charlie Moody, a former Leyton House manager, was appointed Simtek&#x27;s team manager.

The company secured customer Ford HB V8 engines from Cosworth, and prior to the season starting, MTV Europe stepped in as title sponsors. Wirth&#x27;s initial design for the 1994 race car included active suspension, a technology used by Williams to win both the drivers and constructors championships in 1992 and 1993. However, active suspension was banned prior to the start of the 1994 season, and so Simtek were forced to revert to a more conservative design, named the S941. This design was heavy, initially included a fully manual gearbox compared to the semi-automatics being used by the frontrunning teams and the Ford HB engine was less powerful than the engines being used by the front-runners. The company employed 35 people, the fewest of any team competing in Formula One during 1994, and only 10% of the number employed by Scuderia Ferrari.

These deficits showed at the first race of the 1994 season. Brabham qualified in 26th and last place while Ratzenberger failed to qualify. Brabham finished the race 12th, but all cars behind him retired. The next race saw both Simteks qualifying but again occupying the back of the grid. Brabham retired early with an electrical failure, and Ratzenberger finished 11th, last of the cars still running.
The next round was the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. During the Saturday qualifying session, Ratzenberger left the track during an out-lap dislodging his front wing. After rejoining the track, Ratzenberger decided the car wasn&#x27;t damaged, and eager to ensure qualification for the race the next day began a flying lap. At the &quot;Villeneuve curva&quot; while traveling at the front wing failed, causing Ratzenberger to lose control and the car crashed into a concrete wall. Ratzenberger suffered a basal skull fracture, and was killed instantly. A time posted earlier in the qualifying session by Ratzenberger would have given him the 26th position on the grid. His death was the first at a Grand Prix weekend in 12 years. Traditionally, the team would have withdrawn from the event, but David Brabham decided to race on, in tribute to Ratzenberger and in order to raise the morale of a devastated Simtek team. During the ESPN broadcast of the race, it was stated that Brabham was reluctant to race but was encouraged to race by officials who wanted to keep the field full. Only a day after Ratzenberger&#x27;s death would another driver - three-time world champion Ayrton Senna - be killed in an accident during the race itself. Senna&#x27;s death marked the second driver fatality of the weekend.

Brabham&#x27;s decision to continue racing, in part resulted in Simtek making a collective decision to continue racing and &quot;For Roland&quot; was painted on the airbox of the car, to show their reason for continuing. The team only had one chassis to enter at the Monaco Grand Prix, and before the start, a minute&#x27;s silence was held in memory of Senna and Ratzenberger with the second grid slot painted with the Austrian flag. In Spain, Andrea Montermini drove for the team, but during the practice session crashed heavily. He escaped with only a broken toe and cracked left heel but was unable to race and his Simtek chassis was badly damaged. After another one car entry in Canada, Jean-Marc Gounon became available to the team for the French Grand Prix. He finished the race ninth, the team&#x27;s best finish of the season, in part down to high attrition but finishing ahead of Mark Blundell&#x27;s Tyrrell which was still running. Both cars qualified for all the remaining Grands Prix, ahead of the Pacifics, and occasionally also Lotus and Larrousse. Brabham qualified in 21st for the Belgian Grand Prix, ahead of a Lotus, Larrousse, Footwork and Tyrrell car.

Three races before the end of the season, Domenico Schiattarella took over Gounon&#x27;s race seat finishing 19th. He was replaced for the penultimate round in Japan by another pay driver Taki Inoue, but his race ended after three laps when he crashed into the pit wall. Schiattarella was reinstated for the final round at Adelaide, but both Simteks retired from the race with technical problems.

After a challenging debut season the team finished with no world championship points but, convinced that Simtek could do better, Wirth decided to continue the Grand Prix programme.

===1995===
MTV Europe&#x27;s sponsorship commitment was reduced for the 1995 season, but they remained title sponsors to the team. Rather than money, MTV paid Simtek with airtime on their television channel. This airtime was then sold by Simtek to its other sponsors for them to show commercials. Cosworth again supplied engines to the team, with the more up-to-date Ford ED. These were combined with former Benetton gearboxes and Wirth designed a new chassis, the S951.

David Brabham was made an offer by BMW to race in the British Touring Car Championship, and accepted. He was replaced by Jos Verstappen, who was seeking more experience after an incident-filled season at Benetton in 1994. The second seat was kept by Domenico Schiattarella for the first half of the season, while Hideki Noda paid a deposit to secure the place for the latter races.

Both cars retired from the opening round, but the second round in Argentina brought much promise. Verstappen qualified 14th for the race and moved up to sixth by the first pitstop. A slow pitstop dropped him down the order and then his gearbox failed the following lap. Schiattarella finished ninth, equaling the team&#x27;s best finish the previous season. Verstappen&#x27;s gearbox also failed at the next race in San Marino. Schiattarella retired with suspension failure. Spain brought 12th and 15th-placed finishes for the team, but there were bigger problems behind the scenes. In the 18 months the team had been in existence, they had amassed £6 million worth of debt.

At Monaco, neither driver completed a lap of the race due to another gearbox failure on Verstappen&#x27;s car, and the marshals failing to recover Schiattarella&#x27;s car after the first aborted race start. Following the race Wirth wrote, in one of his regular Usenet newsgroup postings, that &quot;a major new backer of the team, with whom I had signed a contract before the season, has finally pulled out and left a large hole in our finances&quot;. Wirth frantically tried to convince potential sponsors to come forward, threatening to shut down the team if none did so. In the event a sponsor could be found, existing sponsors MTV, Russell Athletic and Korean Air pledged to increase their own sponsorship commitments. The team did not appear at the Canadian Grand Prix, but were not fined by the sports commercial rights holders, FOM, for their absence. The CEO of FOM, Bernie Ecclestone agreed that the team entered the championship intending to compete in 16 races and as the championship was extended to 17, they were permitted to miss one race.

Negotiations with the potential backers and sponsors failed, and the companies that would pay for Hideki Noda to drive the Simtek were severely affected by the Kobe earthquake. Prior to the next race, Simtek Grand Prix went into voluntary liquidation and the receivers, Touche Ross, were called in. The collapse of the Formula One team also forced Simtek Research to declare itself bankrupt. In total, 48 jobs were lost and with the team unable to be sold as a going concern, Simtek&#x27;s assets were auctioned off.

<doc id="1022769" wikidata="Q7363538" url="?curid=1022769" title="Ron Blomberg">
<text>Ronald Mark Blomberg (born August 23, 1948), nicknamed &quot;Boomer&quot;, is an American former professional baseball player and minor league manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a designated hitter, first baseman, and right fielder. He played for the New York Yankees (1969, 1971–1976) and Chicago White Sox (1978), and was the manager of the Bet Shemesh Blue Sox in the Israel Baseball League (2007). He was the first designated hitter in Major League Baseball history. He batted left-handed, and threw right-handed.

Over eight seasons, Blomberg compiled a .293 batting average (391-for-1,333) with 52 home runs, 224 RBIs, 184 runs, 67 doubles, and 8 triples in 461 games. He added a .360 on-base percentage and a .473 slugging average. For his career, he hit .304 against right-handers, and .304 with two out and runners in scoring position, as well as .325 when the score was tied.

==Early and personal life==
Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Blomberg is Jewish with roots in Romania.

Blomberg enjoyed the attention he received in New York because he was Jewish: &quot;To be able to play in front of 8 million Jews! Can’t beat it. I lit everyone’s candles for every bar mitzvah in the city. It was like I was related to everyone. They named a sandwich after me at the Stage Deli!&quot;

Through 2010, he was seventh all-time in career batting average (behind Hank Greenberg, Ryan Braun, Buddy Myer, Lou Boudreau, Phil Weintraub, and Kevin Youkilis) among Jewish major league baseball players.

==High school==

Blomberg attended Druid Hills High School, earning four letters each in baseball, basketball, football, and track, and graduated in 1967. He was chosen for the Parade All-American teams in football, basketball, and baseball, the only person ever chosen for all three teams.

He received 125 basketball scholarship offers, and John Wooden of the University of California at Los Angeles came out to meet him in person. Roger Couch, Blomberg&#x27;s basketball coach, said: &quot;Blomberg is the finest basketball player I ever saw — high school or college.&quot; He also received 100 football scholarship offers.

Blomberg was selected by the Yankees with the first overall pick of the 1967 amateur draft, and signed for $75,000 ($ today). He attended DeKalb Junior College part-time, and later majored in psychology at Farleigh Dickinson University.

==Minor league career==
Blomberg played in the minor leagues from 1967 to 1971. In 1971 he was hitting .326 with a .565 slugging percentage for the Yankees AAA team, the Syracuse Chiefs, when the Yankees called him up to the major leagues.

==Major league career==

===New York Yankees (1969–1976)===
Blomberg made his major league debut on September 10, 1969, two weeks after his 21st birthday. After going 3-for-6 in his first season, Blomberg was out in 1970 with injuries. In 1971, he hit .322 for the parent club in 199 at bats. In 1972, he hit a career-high 14 home runs and 22 doubles in 299 at bats.

Blomberg was a natural hitter who had a remarkably quick bat with tremendous power. Many felt that he should play every day but manager Ralph Houk platooned him, hampering his ability to develop into a star player. Blomberg was the first major leaguer to bat as a designated hitter in a regular season game. On April 6, 1973, at Fenway Park, he was walked by Red Sox pitcher Luis Tiant on five pitches with the bases loaded in the first inning, and the bat he used is in Cooperstown&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Blomberg finished 1973 with a healthy .329 average, .395 OBP, and .498 SLG in 301 at-bats; he hit .351 with runners in scoring position.

In 1974, Blomberg hit .311, and .338 with runners in scoring position. He was injured in 1975, and missed all but one game of the pennant-winning 1976 season. He tore his knee in the 1977 exhibition season when he hit the outfield wall, and missed that season too. &quot;I had four knee and two shoulder injuries,&quot; he said. &quot;Still, I gave 120 percent. I lived in Riverdale, and when I was injured, people came up to me and waved to me and hugged me.&quot; He became a free agent at the end of the 1977 season.

===Chicago White Sox (1978)===
The White Sox signed Blomberg as a free agent for $300,000 in 1978. He played his final game for the White Sox on October 1, , at 30 years of age.

===Honors===
Blomberg was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.

In 2007 Blomberg received the city of Atlanta’s Phoenix Award from Mayor Shirley Franklin for his outstanding service and achievements, both as a professional athlete and citizen through his charitable works in Atlanta and throughout the country.

Blomberg twice was voted the most popular person in New York.

==Managing career==
Blomberg managed the Bet Shemesh Blue Sox in the 2007 inaugural season of the Israel Baseball League. He skippered his team to a league-leading 29–12 (.707) regular season won-lost record, as well as to the IBL Championship. Blomberg had previously declined an offer from the Yankees to manage a team in their minor system.

Being in Israel, Blomberg said, “was the greatest thing — just one notch below playing for the Yankees.” In the league they were obliged to have at least two Jewish players on each team, and Blomberg had two Orthodox Israelis on his. When they asked for time out to say &quot;Mincha&quot;, he was taken aback. Then he saw the crowd joining them to &quot;daven&quot; behind the food concession. “It was the greatest rush of my life,” he said. “I was in the Holy Land, near King Solomon’s tomb. I knew I was protected.” But when the team still lost the game, he demanded: “You said your prayers — so what happened?”

==Scouting==
Blomberg is a scout for the New York Yankees in the Atlanta area.

==Writing==
In April 2006, Blomberg&#x27;s biography, &quot;Designated Hebrew: the Ron Blomberg Story&quot; was released by Sports Publishing. It was co-written by Dan Schlossberg, the author of over 30 baseball books, including &quot;The Baseball Catalog,&quot; and host of the syndicated radio show, &quot;BallTalk.&quot; The book discusses Blomberg&#x27;s life leading up to his major league career, his playing days as a Yankee, and his Jewish heritage.

In 2021, Triumph Books published &quot;The Captain &amp; Me,&quot; Blomberg&#x27;s second book. It is subtitled &quot;On and Off The Field with Thurman Munson.&quot; Dan Epstein, a well-known baseball writer, assisted Blomberg, and Munson&#x27;s widow wrote an introduction. Blomberg is using the book to advocate for Munson&#x27;s induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Summer camp==
Blomberg has been running a summer baseball camp for kids at the New Jersey Y Camps since 2006. He also ran a baseball day camp in Paramus, New Jersey in the 1970s.

==Philanthropy==

After his retirement from baseball in 1978, Blomberg worked with numerous charitable organizations, most recently the Israel Cancer Research Fund, where he serves as honorary chairman and spokesperson.

<doc id="1022771" wikidata="Q128086" url="?curid=1022771" title="Formia">
<text>Formia (ancient Formiae) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Latina, on the Mediterranean , Italy. It is located halfway between Rome and Naples, and lies on the Roman-era Appian Way.

==Mythology==
According to the mythology the city was founded by Lamus, son of Poseidon, who was the king of the Laestrygones.

==History==



Formiae was founded by the Italic population of the Aurunci. It was called &quot;Formiae&quot; (derived from &quot;Hormia&quot; or &quot;Ormiai&quot;, after its excellent landing) by ancient authors.

It appeared for the first time in history in 338 BC when, after the Latin Wars, it received the Roman status of Civitas sine suffragio as it remained neutral, together with the city of Fondi. Throughout antiquity the city of Caieta was also part of the Formian territory.

It became a renowned resort during the Republican era for rich Romans to build elaborate villas and Horace called it &quot;the city of the Mamurrae&quot; as the rich and noble equestrian family of Mamurra had strong interests there, including the villa-estate nearby at Gianola, which can still be seen. The impressive remains of Roman villas still stretch along the coast from the fishponds in the Nuovo Porto to Gaeta.

Cicero had a villa there. He was assassinated on the Appian Way just outside the town in 43 BC and his monumental tomb can also still be seen. The villa attributed to Cicero, now in the Villa Rubino, includes an elaborate &quot;nymphaeum&quot; and rooms decorated with frescoes and stucco. The hotel Villa Irlanda contains a cryptoporticus with stucco of the monumental villa of Lucius Marcius Philippus (consul 56 BC), stepfather of Augustus. Villa Caracciolo has a large court surrounded by rooms. Many marble sculptures have been removed from these villas, the majority of which are in the Museo Nazionale in Naples, notably a fine pair of Nereids riding on sea monsters.

Remains of an amphitheatre and theatre can be seen. The enormous underground cistern dug 15 metres below ground was probably the biggest Roman urban cistern in the world until the Piscina Mirabilis was built at the end of the 1st c. BC.

Sextus Julius Frontinus (40 – 104 AD), “Curator Aquarum” of all the aqueducts of Rome, had a villa in Formiae in which Aelianus met the emperor Nerva.

The city was the site of St Erasmus&#x27;s martyrdom around 303 AD, during the persecutions of Diocletian. St Erasmus later also became known as Saint Elmo, the patron saint of sailors. Paulinus of Nola and Therasia stopped at Formiae on their journey back to Nola after visiting Rome at Easter 408. There they read Augustine&#x27;s letter 95 addressed to them.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire the city was sacked by &quot;barbarians&quot; and the population moved to two distinct burghs on the nearby hill, which were under the rule of Gaeta. Charles II of Anjou built a fortress in the maritime burgh, Mola di Gaeta. The other burgh was known as Castellone, from the castle erected there in the mid-14th century by Onorato I Caetani, count of Fondi.

The two villages were united again in 1863 under the name of Formia. The reunited city was badly damaged in 1943–44 in bombing operations and the Battle of Anzio.

==Geography==
Formia lies on the Tyrrhenian Sea, in southern Lazio, close to the town of Gaeta and next to the borders of Campania region.

The municipality borders with Esperia (FR), Gaeta, Itri, Minturno and Spigno Saturnia. It includes the hamlets (&quot;frazioni&quot;) of Castellonorato, Gianola-Santo Janni, Marànola, Penitro and Trivio.

==Main sights==

The most famous monument of Formia is the mausoleum traditionally identified with the Tomb of Cicero: it is a tower on the old Appian Way, enclosed in a large funerary precinct.

Other sights include:
*Tower of Mola 
*Tower of Castellone
*Roman cistern, one of the world&#x27;s largest. Similar to the structures in Constantinople and in the Domitian&#x27;s villa of Albano, it dates from the 1st century BC.
*Remains of the so-called Roman Villa of Mamurra at Gianola, partly destroyed in 1943, including the cisterns of ‘Maggiore’ and of ‘36 columns’, aqueducts, &quot;cryptoporticus&quot; and thermal baths. At the centre of the villa at the highest point of the promontory was a grandiose octagonal building also known as the Temple of Janus, which was flanked by two wings and two porticos sloping down towards the sea. Nearby at Porticciolo Romano are the remains of its fishponds. Five busts of male heads dating from the 2nd/3rd century AD have recently been excavated
*Many remains of Roman villas along the coast

<text>Honorius Augustodunensis (c. 1080 – c. 1140), commonly known as Honorius of Autun, was a very popular 12th-century Christian theologian who wrote prolifically on many subjects. He wrote in a non-scholastic manner, with a lively style, and his works were approachable for the lay community in general. He was, therefore, something of a popularizer of clerical learning.

==Life==
Very little is known of his life. He says that he is &quot;Honorius Augustodunensis ecclesiae presbyter et scholasticus&quot;, but nothing else is known. &quot;Augustodunensis&quot; was taken to mean Autun (&quot;Augustodunum&quot;), but that identification is now generally rejected. However, there is no solid reasoning for any other identification (such as Augst/&quot;Augustodunensem praesulem&quot; near Basle, Augsburg/&quot;Augusta Vindelicorum&quot; in Swabia, or &quot;Augustinensis&quot;, from St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey at Canterbury), so his by-name has stuck. It is certain that he was a monk and that he traveled to England and was a student of Anselm&#x27;s for some time. Toward the end of his life, he was in the Scots Monastery, Regensburg, Bavaria, probably living as a recluse.

==Works==
Among Honorius&#x27;s works are:
*&quot;Elucidarium&quot;: a survey of Christian beliefs (written in England). It was translated frequently into vernacular.
*&quot;Sigillum sanctae Mariae&quot;: a set of lessons for how to celebrate the Assumption, together with a commentary on &quot;The Song of Songs&quot;, which he sees as being principally about Mary.
*&quot;Gemma animae&quot;: An allegorical view of the liturgy and its practices.
* A commentary on &quot;The Song of Songs,&quot; (preserved in a manuscript from c. 1170).
*A long commentary on the Psalms.
*&quot;Speculum Ecclesiae&quot;, a collection of sermons.
*&quot;Clavis physicae&quot;, the first part (1-315) is a summary of the first four books of Johannes Scotus Erigena &quot;Periphyseon&quot; (De divisione naturae), the second part (316-529) is a reproduction of the fifth book.
*&quot;De luminaribus ecclesiae&quot;: a bibliography of Christian authors, which ends with a list of twenty-one of his own works.

His most important work was the &quot;Imago mundi&quot;, an encyclopedia of popular cosmology and geography combined with a chronicle of world history. It was translated into many different vernacular languages and was popular throughout the medieval period. It contained, among other things, a scheme for the operation of guardian angels.

A major scholar of Honorius is Valerie Flint, whose essays on him are collected in &quot;Ideas in the Medieval West: Texts and their Contexts&quot; (London, 1988). See also her study of Honorius in Constant J. Mews and Valerie I. J. Flint, &quot;Peter Abelard; Honorius of Regensburg&quot; (Aldershot, 1995).

<doc id="1022773" wikidata="Q2296647" url="?curid=1022773" title="Social Credit Party of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">
<text>The Social Credit Party of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was a political party in the United Kingdom. It grew out of the Kibbo Kift, which was established in 1920 as a more craft-based alternative for youth to the Boy Scouts.

==Development==
The organisation was led by John Hargrave, who gradually turned the movement into a paramilitary movement for social credit. With its supporters wearing a political uniform of green shirts, in 1932 it became known as the Green Shirt Movement for Social Credit and in 1935 it took its final name, the Social Credit Party. At this point C. H. Douglas, the originator of Social Credit and the ideological leader of the group, disavowed the Greenshirts as he did not support the establishment of a political party based on his ideas. The party published the newspaper &quot;Attack&quot; and was linked to a small number of incidents in which green-painted bricks were thrown through windows, including at 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The leadership stated that they had formed the party after a series of independent candidates, espousing various forms of Social Credit, had sought election and they feared that this proliferation of interpretations could lead to the ideological message being confused and weakened.

The party stood a single candidate in the 1935 general election, Wilfred Townend, who polled 11% of the vote in Leeds South. Despite this lack of success, Hargrave was invited by William Aberhart to take an advisory post in the Government of the Province of Alberta, Canada, that had been formed by the Social Credit Party of Alberta. There were an additional two Independent candidates who stood advocating a National Dividend; Reginald Kenney in Bradford North and H.C. Bell in Birmingham Erdington.

The party began to decline when political uniforms were banned by the Public Order Act 1936. Its activities were curtailed during World War II, and attempts to rebuild afterwards around a campaign against bread rationing had little success. Hargrave stood again in the 1950 general election, but after he gained only 551 votes, the party disbanded itself in 1951.

In 1976, C. J. Hunt, treasurer of the Social Credit Political League, formed a new party under the old name. This short-lived group was based in Bradford, West Yorkshire, where it was active in local politics.

==Monetary reform supporters==
Notable supporters of Social Credit or &quot;monetary reform&quot; in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s included aircraft manufacturer A. V. Roe, scientist Frederick Soddy, author Henry Williamson, military historian J. F. C. Fuller and Sir Oswald Mosley, in 1928-30 a member of the Labour Government but later the leader of the British Union of Fascists. Rolf Gardiner had published articles by both Hargrave and Douglas in his journal &quot;Youth&quot; although this was during the 1920s and he had no formal links to the Social Credit Party.

In the early part of its existence Lord Tavistock had been loosely associated with the party although he would later lend his support to the British People&#x27;s Party, as a result of which that group espoused elements of Social Credit.

<text>Mahafzah, Mahafzeh or Mahaftha is a Jordanian tribe who reside in such places as Kufr Jayiz, Waqqas and Ghor al-Safi (al-Karak). It originated in the Karak area, where it participated in the battles of Hittin and `Ayn Jalut and were among those who aided in resisting the Tatar encroachments on Muslim lands, and in particular Jordan and Palestine. The Mahafzah were relied upon to help aid a wing of the Muslim armies. Several members of the Mahaftha tribe left the small town of Kufr Jayiz in search of education and a better life. Today some Mahaftha tribe members reside in Irbid, Amman, Karak, England, Saudi Arabia, UAE and the United States of America, the census of mahfzah members around 3000, Mahafzah tribe has common council in Kufr Jayiz called Mazafah, they meet there in social occasions.

<doc id="1022792" wikidata="Q34022" url="?curid=1022792" title="Tobian language">
<text>Tobian (, literally &quot;the language of Tobi&quot;) is the language of Tobi, one of the Southwest Islands of Palau, and the main island of Hatohobei state. Tobian is a Micronesian language spoken by approximately 150 people, about 22 are native speakers. The speakers are located in either the island of Tobi or in Echang, a hamlet of Koror, the former capital of Palau. Tobian and Sonsorolese are very close, and appear to be gradually merging towards a new dialect called &quot;Echangese&quot;. Earlier in the 20th century, about 1000 people lived on the island. Shortly before and during the First World War, those numbers dropped severely due to an abundance of disease.

== Classification ==
Tobian and the dialects of Sonsorol, Merir, and Pulo Ana, the other inhabited Southwest Islands, are closely related to the languages spoken in the Federated States of Micronesia outer islands of Yap and Chuuk Lagoon. These include Ulithi and the Central Carolines. Altogether, these languages form a sub-group within the Micronesian languages. The names of these dialects are the terms that are commonly used in European terms. Below are the native names as compared to the common names:

Tobi is the basis of a local pidgin.

==Examples==
* animal = &quot;mar&quot;
* coconut palm = &quot;ruh&quot;
* goodbye = &quot;sabuho&quot;
* language = &quot;ramarih&quot;
* soldierfish = &quot;red&quot;

===Counting===
* one = &quot;sewo&quot;
* two = &quot;huwou&quot;
* three = &quot;soruo&quot;
* four = &quot;fauwo&quot;

This is only base counting. There are different numerals for a lot of different objects.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
&quot;œ&quot; is used rarely and sounds similar to the French &quot;eu&quot; but the lips do not round out at the end of the sound and has critical meaning in words. There is a central low vowel that sounds like the &quot;u&quot; in &quot;but&quot;, but it does not have semantic value and it has very rare occurrence.

=== Diphthongs ===
There are a lot of diphthongs in Tobian and according to Capell, &quot;several of them are difficult for Europeans&quot;.

=== Homonyms and near homonyms ===
Like most other languages, Tobian has examples of homonyms but they are not as abundant. Meanings can vary solely on vowel length. Also small differences in sounds can produce major differences in meanings. For example, the difference between voiceless (f) and voiced (v) consonants are important but there are many exceptions where it does not affect the meaning.

==== Some minimal pairs ====
====Stress and prosody====
Tobian utilizes both stress and pitch accents or tones. Compared to the other dialects, it uses less musical tone. It is not a tonal language because the tone does not change the meaning of the word. Although it is not tonal, the speech has a wide variety of tone variations that appear to be emotional rather than linguistic and either show emphasis or other semantic components. Stress accents are used but not as much as English or Russian. In the past, the stress marks would normally be placed on the last syllable of the words. In the present, the stress marks can be placed either on the last syllable or the second to last syllable.

# Stress on the penultimate (second to last)
# Stress on the final syllable
# Stress on the antepenultimate (third to last)
# Sentence stress
# Vowel harmony
# Vowel length
# Furtive vowels (Slightly heard or silent vowels)

=== Consonants ===

<doc id="1022793" wikidata="Q5561047" url="?curid=1022793" title="Gilbert Lani Kauhi">
<text>Gilbert Francis Lani Damian Kauhi (October 17, 1937 – May 3, 2004), also known by the stage names monumously as Zulu and Zoulou, was an American actor and comedian. He is remembered largely for his portrayal of Kono Kalakaua on the long-running television program &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

==Career==
Kauhi was born in Hilo on the &quot;Big Island&quot; of Hawaii. He served in the United States Coast Guard. He began his career in Honolulu as a stand-up comedian, mimic, and singer, described by one journalist as &quot;part Godfrey Cambridge, part Zero Mostel&quot;. His nightly live show was a popular attraction at C&#x27;est Si Bon Supper Club in the Waikiki section of Honolulu before, during, and after his brief television career. Kauhi was an accomplished surfer; he was known in Hawaii by the honorific &quot;Waikiki Beach Boy&quot;. In the late 1960s, Kauhi was a member of the band Sons of Hawaii and referred to it as his &quot;schooling in Hawaiian music&quot;.

In 1968, Kauhi landed the role of the burly state police detective Kono on &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. He was fired from the show after four seasons after disagreements with the show&#x27;s publicist. Zulu would go on to eight more television roles including a reprise role of Kono in the 1997 pilot for the revival series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. 

After ending his business relationship with his manager, Kauhi discovered that she had registered the name &quot;Zulu&quot; and he could not perform as Zulu without her permission. For the rest of his career he performed as &quot;Zoulou&quot;, saying it was the French Tahitian spelling.

==Death==
Kauhi died in Hilo at the age of 66 from complications due to diabetes. Per his wishes, his ashes were scattered off Waikiki.

<doc id="1022803" wikidata="Q6304756" url="?curid=1022803" title="Drive shaft">
<text>A drive shaft, driveshaft, driving shaft, tailshaft (Australian English), propeller shaft (prop shaft), or Cardan shaft (after Girolamo Cardano) is a component for transmitting mechanical power, torque, and rotation, usually used to connect other components of a drivetrain that cannot be connected directly because of distance or the need to allow for relative movement between them.

As torque carriers, drive shafts are subject to torsion and shear stress, equivalent to the difference between the input torque and the load. They must therefore be strong enough to bear the stress, while avoiding too much additional weight as that would in turn increase their inertia.

To allow for variations in the alignment and distance between the driving and driven components, drive shafts frequently incorporate one or more universal joints, jaw couplings, or rag joints, and sometimes a splined joint or prismatic joint.

==History==
The term &quot;driveshaft&quot; first appeared during the mid-19th century. In Stover&#x27;s 1861 patent reissue for a planing and matching machine, the term is used to refer to the belt-driven shaft by which the machine is driven. The term is not used in his original patent. Another early use of the term occurs in the 1861 patent reissue for the Watkins and Bryson horse-drawn mowing machine.
Here, the term refers to the shaft transmitting power from the machine&#x27;s wheels to the gear train that works the cutting mechanism.

In the 1890s, the term began to be used in a manner closer to the modern sense. In 1891, for example, Battles referred to the shaft between the transmission and driving trucks of his Climax locomotive as the drive shaft, and Stillman referred to the shaft linking the crankshaft to the rear axle of his shaft-driven bicycle as a drive shaft. In 1899, Bukey used the term to describe the shaft transmitting power from the wheel to the driven machinery by a universal joint in his Horse-Power. In the same year, Clark described his Marine Velocipede using the term to refer to the gear-driven shaft transmitting power through a universal joint to the propeller shaft. Crompton used the term to refer to the shaft between the transmission of his steam-powered Motor Vehicle of 1903 and the driven axle.

The pioneering automobile industry company, Autocar, was the first to use a drive shaft in a gasoline-powered car. Built in 1901, today this vehicle is in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.

==Automotive drive shaft==
===Vehicles===
An automobile may use a longitudinal shaft to deliver power from an engine/transmission to the other end of the vehicle before it goes to the wheels. A pair of short drive shafts is commonly used to send power from a central differential, transmission, or transaxle to the wheels.
==== Front-engine, rear-wheel drive ====

In front-engined, rear-wheel drive vehicles, a longer drive shaft is also required to send power the length of the vehicle. Two forms dominate: The torque tube with a single universal joint and the more common Hotchkiss drive with two or more joints. This system became known as &quot;Système Panhard&quot; after the automobile company Panhard et Levassor which patented it.

Most of these vehicles have a clutch and gearbox (or transmission) mounted directly on the engine, with a drive shaft leading to a final drive in the rear axle. When the vehicle is stationary, the drive shaft does not rotate. Some vehicles (generally sports cars, such as the Chevrolet Corvette C5/C6/C7, Alfa Romeo Alfetta and Porsche 924/944/928), seeking improved weight balance between front and rear, use a rear-mounted transaxle. In some non-Porsche models, this places the clutch and transmission at the &quot;rear&quot; of the car and the drive shaft between them and the engine. In this case the drive shaft rotates continuously with the engine, even when the car is stationary and out of gear. However, the Porsche 924/944/928 models have the clutch mounted to the back of the engine in a bell housing and the drive shaft from the clutch output, located inside of a hollow protective torque tube, transfers power to the rear mounted transaxle (transmission + differential). Thus the Porsche driveshaft only rotates when the rear wheels are turning as the engine-mounted clutch can decouple engine crankshaft rotation from the driveshaft. So for Porsche, when the driver is using the clutch while briskly shifting up or down (manual transmission), the engine can rev freely with the driver&#x27;s accelerator pedal input, since with the clutch disengaged, the engine and flywheel inertia is relatively low and is not burdened with the added rotational inertia of the driveshaft. The Porsche torque tube is solidly fastened to both the engine&#x27;s bell housing and to the transaxle case, fixing the length and alignment between the bell housing and the transaxle and greatly minimizing rear wheel drive reaction torque from twisting the transaxle in any plane.

A drive shaft connecting a rear differential to a rear wheel may be called a half-shaft. The name derives from the fact that two such shafts are required to form one rear axle.

Early automobiles often used chain drive or belt drive mechanisms rather than a drive shaft. Some used electrical generators and motors to transmit power to the wheels.

==== Front-wheel drive ====
In British English, the term &quot;drive shaft&quot; is restricted to a transverse shaft that transmits power to the wheels, especially the front wheels. The shaft connecting the gearbox to a rear differential is called a &quot;propeller shaft&quot;, or &quot;prop-shaft&quot;. A prop-shaft assembly consists of a propeller shaft, a slip joint and one or more universal joints. Where the engine and axles are separated from each other, as on four-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive vehicles, it is the propeller shaft that serves to transmit the drive force generated by the engine to the axles.

Several different types of drive shaft are used in the automotive industry:
* One-piece drive shaft
* Two-piece drive shaft
* Slip-in-tube drive shaft

The slip-in-tube drive shaft is a new type that improves crash safety. It can be compressed to absorb energy in the event of a crash, so is also known as a &quot;collapsible drive shaft&quot;.

==== Four wheel and all-wheel drive ====
These evolved from the front-engine rear-wheel drive layout. A new form of transmission called the transfer case was placed between transmission and final drives in both axles. This split the drive to the two axles and may also have included reduction gears, a dog clutch or differential. At least two drive shafts were used, one from the transfer case to each axle. In some larger vehicles, the transfer box was centrally mounted and was itself driven by a short drive shaft. In vehicles the size of a Land Rover, the drive shaft to the front axle is noticeably shorter and more steeply articulated than the rear shaft, making it a more difficult engineering problem to build a reliable drive shaft, and which may involve a more sophisticated form of universal joint.

Modern light cars with all-wheel drive (notably Audi or the Fiat Panda) may use a system that more closely resembles a front-wheel drive layout. The transmission and final drive for the front axle are combined into one housing alongside the engine, and a single drive shaft runs the length of the car to the rear axle. This is a favoured design where the torque is biased to the front wheels to give car-like handling, or where the maker wishes to produce both four-wheel drive and front-wheel drive cars with many shared components.

===Research and development===
The automotive industry also uses drive shafts at testing plants.

At an engine test stand, a drive shaft is used to transfer a certain speed or torque from the internal combustion engine to a dynamometer.

A &quot;shaft guard&quot; is used at a shaft connection to protect against contact with the drive shaft and
for detection of a shaft failure.

At a transmission test stand a drive shaft connects the prime mover with the transmission.

=== Symptoms of a bad drive shaft ===
An automotive drive shaft can typically last about 120,000 kilometres. However, if the vehicle experiencing any of the signs below, drivers should get it checked as soon as possible.

* Clicking or squeaking noise: Driver can either hear a clicking, squeaking, or grinding noises coming from underneath the vehicle when driving.
* Clunking sounds: Driver can hear the noises especially when turning the vehicle, accelerating or even putting it into reverse.
* Vibration: An early and common symptom of a failing drive shaft is an intense vibration coming from underneath the vehicle. Worn out couplings, u-joints, or bearings cause excessive drive shaft vibration.
* Turning problems: Problems with turning the vehicle, both during slow and high-speed drives, is another significant sign of a bad drive shaft.

==Cardan shaft park brakes==
A cardan shaft park brake works on the drive shaft rather than the wheels. These brakes are commonly used on small trucks. This type of brake is prone to failure and has led to incidents where the truck has run away on a slope, leading to safety alerts being issued. Heavy vehicles that have this type of park brake usually have a ratchet handle similar to a car&#x27;s hand brake or parking brake, as opposed to an air brake button or lever.

Risk factors for drivers include parking on a steep slope when heavily loaded, not applying the brake with enough force, changing the load or load balance while parked on a slope, or parking where one side of the vehicle is able to slip. Using chocks on the wheels is one way of preventing the vehicle from moving on a slope.

== Motorcycle drive shafts ==

Drive shafts have been used on motorcycles since before WW1, such as the Belgian FN motorcycle from 1903 and the Stuart Turner Stellar motorcycle of 1912. As an alternative to chain and belt drives, drive shafts offer long-lived, clean, and relatively maintenance-free operation. A disadvantage of shaft drive on a motorcycle is that helical gearing, spiral bevel gearing or similar is needed to turn the power 90° from the shaft to the rear wheel, losing some power in the process.

BMW has produced shaft drive motorcycles since 1923; and Moto Guzzi have built shaft-drive V-twins since the 1960s. The British company, Triumph and the major Japanese brands, Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Yamaha, have produced shaft drive motorcycles.

Lambretta motorscooters type A up to type LD are shaft-driven the NSU Prima scooter is also shaft-driven

Motorcycle engines positioned such that the crankshaft is longitudinal and parallel to the frame are often used for shaft-driven motorcycles. This requires only one 90° turn in power transmission, rather than two. Bikes from Moto Guzzi and BMW, plus the Triumph Rocket III and Honda ST series all use this engine layout.

Motorcycles with shaft drive are subject to shaft effect, where the chassis climbs when power is applied. This effect, which is the opposite of that exhibited by chain-drive motorcycles, is counteracted with systems such as BMW&#x27;s Paralever, Moto Guzzi&#x27;s CARC and Kawasaki&#x27;s Tetra Lever.
==Marine drive shafts==

On a power-driven ship, the drive shaft, or propeller shaft, usually connects the propeller outside the vessel to the driving machinery inside, passing through at least one shaft seal or stuffing box where it intersects the hull. The thrust, the axial force generated by the propeller, is transmitted to the vessel by the thrust block or thrust bearing, which, in all but the smallest of boats, is incorporated in the main engine or gearbox. Shafts can be made of stainless steel or composite materials depending on what type of ship will install them.

The portion of the drive train which connects directly to the propeller is known as the &quot;tail shaft.&quot;

==Locomotive drive shafts==

The Shay, Climax and Heisler locomotives, all introduced in the late 19th century, used quill drives to couple power from a centrally mounted multi-cylinder engine to each of the trucks supporting the engine. On each of these geared steam locomotives, one end of each drive shaft was coupled to the driven truck through a universal joint while the other end was powered by the crankshaft, transmission or another truck through a second universal joint. A quill drive also has the ability to slide lengthways, effectively varying its length. This is required to allow the bogies to rotate when passing a curve.

Cardan shafts are used in some diesel locomotives (mainly diesel-hydraulics, such as British Rail Class 52) and some electric locomotives (e.g. British Rail Class 91). They are also widely used in diesel multiple units.

==Drive shafts in bicycles==

The drive shaft has served as an alternative to a chain-drive in bicycles for the past century, never becoming very popular. A shaft-driven bicycle (or &quot;Acatène&quot;, from an early maker) has several advantages and disadvantages:

===Advantages===
*Drive system is less likely to become jammed.
*The rider cannot become dirtied from chain grease or injured by &quot;chain bite&quot; when clothing or a body part catches between an unguarded chain and a sprocket.
*Lower maintenance than a chain system when the drive shaft is enclosed in a tube.
*More consistent performance. Dynamic Bicycles claims that a drive shaft bicycle can deliver 94% efficiency, whereas a chain-driven bike can deliver anywhere from 75 to 97% efficiency based on condition.

===Disadvantages===
*A drive shaft system weighs more than a chain system, usually heavier.
*Many of the advantages claimed by drive shaft&#x27;s proponents can be achieved on a chain-driven bicycle, such as covering the chain and sprockets.
*Use of lightweight derailleur gears with a high number of ratios is impossible, although hub gears can be used.
*Wheel removal can be complicated in some designs (as it is for some chain-driven bicycles with hub gears).

== PTO drive shafts ==

Drive shafts are one method of transferring power from an engine and PTO to vehicle-mounted accessory equipment, such as an air compressor. Drive shafts are used when there is not enough space beside the engine for the additional accessory; the shaft bridges the gap between the engine PTO and the accessory, allowing the accessory to be mounted elsewhere on the vehicle.

==Drive shaft production==
Nowadays new possibilities exist for the production process of drive shafts. The filament winding production process is gaining popularity for the creation of composite drive shafts. Several companies in the automotive industry are looking to adopt this knowledge for their high volume production process.

<text>Borthwood Copse, near Sandown, Isle of Wight, England is a piece of woodland owned by the National Trust and is one of the numerous copses which make up part of the medieval forest which covered most of the eastern end of the Island. Borthwood Copse sits on the outskirts of Newchurch, and is close to the neighbouring hamlet of Apse Heath and the villages of Queen&#x27;s Bower and Alverstone. Borthwood Copse was originally a royal hunting ground. It was bequeathed to the National Trust in 1926 by Frank Morey. He had purchased it a few years earlier to preserve it for wildlife. Subsequent additions have been added to the land and it now covers a total of .

There are some ancient oaks, and a distinctive grove of beech trees which stand amongst glades of coppiced sweet chestnut and hazel. The woodland is one of the very few examples of working coppice with standards which can be seen on the Isle of Wight. A bridleway and many smaller paths lead through the woodland, which is open to the public. It is particularly popular with visitors in the autumn with its vivid colours and, in the springtime, when carpeted with bluebells. Borthwood Copse is one of the countless locations in the Eastern Isle of Wight that are home to large numbers of Red Squirrels.

Owing to its position on the downs, much of Borthwood Copse is hilly, and in wet weather the soil often becomes waterlogged and marshy, making travel through the copse on foot difficult.

Within the wood is a viewpoint looking east from where you can catch a glimpse of Culver Down and the sea. As the copse climbs a small hill, Bembridge Windmill can be seen in the distance through the downs on clear days.

Wildlife includes dormice, red squirrels, a wide range of bats, and many invertebrates.

The view point is called Kite Hill.

<text>Dactylitis or sausage digit is inflammation of an entire digit (a finger or toe), and can be painful.

The word &quot;dactyl&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;daktylos&quot; &#x27;finger&#x27;. As a medical term, it refers to both the fingers and the toes.
==Associated conditions==
Dactylitis can occur in seronegative arthropathies, such as psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, and in sickle-cell disease as result of a vasoocclusive crisis with bone infarcts, and in infectious conditions including tuberculosis, syphilis, and leprosy. In reactive arthritis, sausage fingers occur due to synovitis. Dactylitis may also be seen with sarcoidosis.

In sickle-cell disease it typically occurs after 6 months of age (as in infants protective fetal hemoglobin, HbF, is replaced with adult hemoglobin and the disease manifests) and is often the first clinical presentation of the disorder.

<text>Charles Herbert Carneal (May 10, 1923 – April 1, 2007) was an American Major League Baseball sportscaster. From 1962 through 2006, he was a play-by-play voice of Minnesota Twins radio broadcasts, becoming the lead announcer in 1967 after Ray Scott left to work exclusively with CBS. Prior to 1962, he broadcast for the Baltimore Orioles, partnering with Ernie Harwell from 1957 to 1959 and with Bob Murphy in 1960–1961. His mellow baritone voice and laid-back demeanor were well loved by Twins fans and formed a well balanced team with the more excitable and emotional style of his longtime broadcast partner John Gordon. Carneal was for many years known (and introduced as such by Gordon at the beginning of each game) as &quot;The Voice of the Twins&quot;. Carneal&#x27;s trademark greeting, &quot;Hi everybody&quot;, was reminiscent of his down-home style.

A Richmond, Virginia, native, Carneal first broadcast major league games for the Philadelphia Athletics and Philadelphia Phillies in 1954. From 1957 to 1961 he was employed by the Baltimore Orioles. He also called games on CBS television for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League in the team&#x27;s first four years of existence (1961–64), and AFL games on NBC in 1965.

Carneal&#x27;s announcing career received a significant boost when he took over the Twins broadcasts, as it united him with broadcaster Halsey Hall, after whom many major league broadcasters have modeled their work. Hall&#x27;s influence on Carneal&#x27;s career development is legendary.

Carneal received the Ford C. Frick Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996, and was inducted into the Pavek Museum of Broadcasting&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2004. He was named Minnesota Sportscaster of the Year 20 times by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association.

Beginning in 2002, Carneal scaled back his workload to providing play-by-play for half of Minnesota&#x27;s home games. By 2007, he was scheduled to work only 36 games. Until 2007, Carneal worked in partnership with fellow radio commentators John Gordon and Dan Gladden.

In 2002, Carneal was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.

Herb Carneal died on April 1, 2007, of congestive heart failure. The Twins dedicated their 2007 season to Carneal, wearing patches on their sleeves in his honor.

<text>The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) is a membership organisation that represents and advises UK food and drink manufacturers.

==Membership==
The Food and Drink Federation members are companies of all sizes as well as trade associations and groups dealing with specific sectors of the industry.

The UK food and drink industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the country. It accounts for 19% of the total manufacturing sector by turnover and employ over 400,000 people in the UK across 7,000 businesses.

==Functions==
The Food and Drink Federation is responsible for communicating to and from a range of audiences including the UK government (particularly the Department of Health; the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills), regulators, consumers and the media.

The FDF tackles a range of issues on behalf of its members under the three core areas of health and wellbeing; food safety and science; and sustainability and competitiveness; readiness and calorific contribution; it also aims to highlight the work industry conducts under these areas. For example, its Five-fold Environmental Ambition sets out where manufacturers are looking to make a difference to the environment through reducing emissions; sending zero food and packaging waste to landfill from 2015; reducing the level of packaging reaching households; improving water efficiency to reduce water use; and embedding environmental standards in their transport practices to achieve fewer and friendlier food miles.

Product reformulation has also been another major focus for the Federation, highlighting the industry&#x27;s ongoing work to reduce salt, trans fats, fat and sugar in food products. The industry&#x27;s efforts have been supported by the UK&#x27;s Food Standards Agency, the UK Government and others.

<doc id="1022830" wikidata="Q1379341" url="?curid=1022830" title="Richard Denning">
<text>Richard Denning (born Louis Albert Heindrich Denninger Jr.; March 27, 1914 – October 11, 1998) was an American actor who starred in science fiction films of the 1950s, including &quot;Unknown Island&quot; (1948), &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; (1954), &quot;Target Earth&quot; (1954), &quot;Day the World Ended&quot; (1955), &quot;Creature with the Atom Brain&quot; (1955), and &quot;The Black Scorpion&quot; (1957). Denning also appeared in the film &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; (1957) with Cary Grant and on radio with Lucille Ball in &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot; (1948–1951), the forerunner of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. He&#x27;s more well-known as Governor Paul Jameson in late 1960s-early 1980s police procedural TV series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

==Early years==
Denning was born in Poughkeepsie, New York. When he was 18 months old, his family moved to Los Angeles. After attending Manual Arts High School, he earned a Master of Business Administration degree from Woodbury Business College in Los Angeles. Plans called for him to take over his father&#x27;s garment manufacturing business, but he developed an interest in acting. Denning enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II and served on submarines.

==Career==

Denning was perhaps best known for his recurring starring roles in science fiction and horror films of the 1950s, and playing husband opposite Lucille Ball on the radio series that led to &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in which he was replaced by Desi Arnaz as Lucy&#x27;s husband. 

Denning began acting in minor supporting and background roles through the 1930s and early 1940s until the start of World War II. According to Denning, his military service disrupted his acting career, and after his discharge it would be a year and a half before Paramount Pictures offered him more acting work. During that time, he and his family lived in a mobile home that he alternately parked at Malibu and Palm Springs.

Denning&#x27;s unemployment ended when he was hired to star on the radio opposite Lucille Ball in &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;. The CBS Radio sitcom ran for 124 episodes from July 23, 1948 through March 31, 1951 and would evolve into the groundbreaking television sitcom &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. CBS wanted Denning to continue as the husband in the new sitcom but Lucille Ball insisted that her real life husband, Desi Arnaz, play the part. The radio stint, however, led to a role on CBS television&#x27;s series adaptation of &quot;Mr. and Mrs. North&quot;.

On television, he starred as the title character in the 1950 syndicated adventure series &quot;Ding Howe and the Flying Tigers&quot;. He was cast as Dr. Greg Graham in the 1959 series, &quot;The Flying Doctor&quot;. He also starred as the title character in the detective series &quot;Michael Shayne&quot; (1960–1961) and shared title billing with Barbara Britton in the detective series &quot;Mr. and Mrs. North&quot; (1952–1954).

In 1964-1965, Denning played Steve Scott in the comedy series &quot;Karen&quot;. In later life, he had a recurring role as the fictitious governor of Hawaii, Paul Jameson, in the CBS television crime drama series, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; (1968–1980), starring Jack Lord.

He appeared three times on the ABC religion anthology series &quot;Crossroads&quot;, as Dr. Ira Langston in &quot;Chinese Checkers&quot; (1955) and as the Reverend George Bolton in &quot;The Bowery Bishop&quot; and as the Reverend Lloyd E. Williams in &quot;The Pure White Orchid&quot; (both 1956).

In other activity on radio, Denning played Uncle Jack in &quot;It&#x27;s a Crime, Mr. Collins&quot; (1956-1957) on the Mutual Broadcasting System. He also was the second actor to play Jerry North in the radio version of &quot;Mr. and Mrs. North&quot;.

Denning later appeared in several &#x27;B&#x27; crime drama films before starring in science fiction and horror films. In 1957, he began the first of a series of television appearances, usually as a supporting character, though he did star briefly in two television dramas, &quot;The Flying Doctor&quot; (1959), and &quot;Michael Shayne&quot; (1960–61).

In 1968, Denning completed his last film, a comedy titled &quot;I Sailed to Tahiti with an All Girl Crew&quot;. Semi-retired and living on the island of Maui with his wife, Denning was contacted by producer Leonard Freeman, who offered him the supporting role as the governor of Hawaii in the TV detective series, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. In order to persuade Denning to sign on in the recurring role, Freeman guaranteed Denning five-hour days and a four-day work week.

==Recognition==
Denning has a star at 6932 Hollywood Boulevard in the Television section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was dedicated on February 8, 1960.

==Personal life==

In 1942, Denning married 1940s horror film queen Evelyn Ankers (co-star of &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;, &quot;Ghost of Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Son of Dracula&quot;), who retired from films at the age of 32 after they were married. He and Ankers had a daughter, Diana Denning (later Dwyer). After Ankers&#x27;s death from cancer in 1985, he married Patricia Leffingwell. Denning died of a heart attack at the age of 84 on October 11, 1998, while visiting relatives in Southern California. He outlived his &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; co-star Jack Lord (who died in January 1998) by nine months. Denning and Ankers are buried at Makawao Veterans&#x27; Cemetery in Makawao, Hawaii.

<text>Dinosaur Isle is a purpose-built dinosaur museum located in Sandown on the Isle of Wight in southern England.

The museum was designed by Isle of Wight architect Rainey Petrie Johns in the shape of a giant pterosaur. It claims to be the first custom-built dinosaur museum in Europe.

== History ==
Throughout the 19th century, many collectors such as the Reverend William Fox (1813-1881) excavated the types of new dinosaur genera, including &quot;Aristosuchus&quot;, &quot;Hypsilophodon foxii&quot;, and &quot;Polacanthus&quot;. Most of the discoveries were then transferred to the mainland for study and exhibition, which after some time prompted the Isle of Wight Council to begin its own collection.

In 1923, the Isle of Wight&#x27;s first geological museum opened in Sandown, under the name of the &quot;Museum of Isle of Wight Geology&quot;.

The £2.7 million cost of Dinosaur Isle, the new museum, was provided by Isle of Wight Council and the National Lottery Millennium Commission. Dinosaur Isle opened to visitors on 10 August 2001. It currently houses 40,000 specimens, including nearly 200 types.
The museum offers many field trips to discover the island&#x27;s main palaeontological sites.

== Exhibits ==
The visit to the museum begins with a presentation of the different past ecosystems that can be found in different parts of the island. This area begins with Pleistocene fossils, including those of &quot;Bison antiquus&quot;. The repaired animatronic of an &quot;Ophthalmosaurus&quot; from the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; is also in this section. The first Mesozoic animals are displayed outside of the main room, with a sauropod being displayed at the very end, and several exhibits dedicated to Mesozoic marine life.

The large central room is dedicated to dinosaurs. Many life-size replicas and models are found there, including ornithischians such as &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;Polacanthus&quot; and &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;, in addition to saurischians like &quot;Eotyrannus&quot;. Additionally, a large allosauroid theropod, &quot;Neovenator salerii&quot; (discovered in 1978 and described by Steve Hutt one of the curators of the museum) is also exhibited, as is a replica skeleton of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. The skeleton of the &quot;Iguanodon&quot; MIWG.5126 (or Pink Iggy) is particularly noteworthy among the museum&#x27;s collection. It was discovered in 1976 by Steve Hutt, and is mostly articulated. It is named after the minerals in the matrix it was discovered in, which gave the rocks a pink colouration. The holotype of the small crocodyliform &quot;Koumpiodontosuchus&quot; is also displayed.

On one of the walls of the room, reconstructions of heads of different pterosaurs are displayed. Indeed, the museum houses the holotype of the ornithocheirid &quot;Caulkicephalus&quot;.

Visitors to the museum are given the opportunity to speak to resident palaeontologists and watch them at work.

<text>Ammonite is British-American author Nicola Griffith&#x27;s debut novel, which was published in 1992. It takes place on Grenchstom&#x27;s Planet (&quot;Jeep&quot;) which is inhabited entirely by women. American author Ursula Le Guin cited &quot;Ammonite&quot; as “a knock-out first novel, with strong, likeable characters, a compelling story, and a very interesting take on gender”.

Critically acclaimed and academically praised, the novel won several literary awards, including the Lambda Literary Award for LGBT themed science fiction/fantasy, and the Otherwise Award, formerly known as the James Tiptree Jr. Award, for science fiction or fantasy that explores or expands our understanding of gender. In 2008, the Italian translation of &quot;Ammonite&quot; was awarded the Premio Italia award, an Italian literary prize for astounding works in science fiction and fantasy. The novel was also shortlisted for the Arthur C. Clarke Award, the British Science Fiction Award, and the Locus Award for a debut novel.

In September 2012 &quot;Ammonite&quot; was included in the SF Masterworks relaunch series of softcover editions (2010 - present). The series is composed of classic science fiction literature that is deemed important and considered deserving of being in continuous print.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Ammonite&quot; is the story of Marghe Taishan, an anthropologist and employee of a government agency, the Settlement and Education Councils (SEC). She is sent as an SEC representative to the planet Jeep (Grenchstom&#x27;s Planet – &quot;Jeep&quot; being the pronunciation of the abbreviation &quot;GP&quot;). Centuries in the past, Jeep was colonized by people from Earth, but contact was lost with the colony, and now the planet is a target for recolonization by the sinister Durallium Company (mostly referred to as &quot;Company&quot;). Some years prior to the beginning of the story, Company sent an expedition of technical and security personnel (the latter called &quot;Mirrors&quot; for the mirrored helmets on their combat armor) to the planet; a short time later, all of the men and many of the women in the expedition died from a virus, also known as Jeep, which was endemic to the planet. As a result, the planet was placed under quarantine, and none of the surviving members of the expedition have been allowed to leave. One of the mysteries of the planet is that there is a &quot;native&quot; population, entirely female and apparently descended from the original colony.

Marghe is sent to Jeep not only to study the native cultures, but also to test a potential vaccine for the Jeep virus. She makes a journey across Jeep, living with several of its indigenous cultures. Shortly after the start of her journey, she is captured and enslaved by the nomadic Echraidhe, one of whose members, Uaithne, believes herself to be the Death Spirit, the chosen representative of the goddess of death destined to bring about an apocalypse. Escaping the Echraidhe and almost dying in the extreme winter, she reaches the quieter village of Ollfoss, where she joins a family and stops taking the vaccine, accepting the virus into her body and truly learning what it is like to be a native (including how the natives are able to conceive children). She learns the mystic discipline of &quot;deepsearch&quot;, and eventually becomes a &quot;viajera&quot;, or traveling wise woman. Afterward, she is forced to the center of a conflict between the Mirrors and the Echraidhe under the leadership of Uaithne. Marghe stops the conflict, but shortly thereafter Company, believing the vaccine to have been a failure, destroys the space station orbiting Jeep, apparently isolating the people there. However, Marghe and the Mirrors believe that the Company will probably return one day, a return they must prepare for.

<text>Jacques Flynn (August 22, 1915 – September 21, 2000) was a Canadian lawyer and federal politician, serving in both the House of Commons and Senate.

Flynn was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, the grandson of the Premier of Quebec Edmund James Flynn. He both graduated in law from Université Laval and was called to the Quebec Bar in 1939.

A Progressive Conservative, Flynn ran unsuccessfully to represent the riding of Quebec South in the House of Commons in the 1957 election; he came second to the Liberal incumbent, Frank Power. He narrowly defeated Power in a rematch in Quebec South in the 1958 election when John Diefenbaker led the PC Party to a landslide victory.

Flynn became Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada in 1960. In December 1961, Prime Minister Diefenbaker brought Flynn into the Cabinet of Canada as Minister of Mines and Technical Surveys, a position he held until losing his seat to Liberal challenger Jean-Charles Cantin in the 1962 election that reduced the Conservatives to a minority government. Later that year, he was appointed to the Senate.

Flynn served as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1967 until the 1979 election that brought the Tories back to power. Prime Minister Joe Clark brought Flynn into Cabinet as Minister of Justice. It was unusual for a senator to hold such a senior cabinet portfolio, but as the Conservatives were elected with virtually no representation from Quebec, it was necessary to attempt to achieve regional balance in Cabinet by appointing senators to the body.

With the defeat of the Clark government to Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s Liberals in the 1980 election, Flynn returned to the position of Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. He continued in that role until the PCs, now led by Brian Mulroney, returned to government in 1984. He remained in the Upper House until his retirement in 1990.

In 1993, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

<doc id="1022841" wikidata="Q358585" url="?curid=1022841" title="Common warehouse metamodel">
<text>The common warehouse metamodel (CWM) defines a specification for modeling metadata for relational, non-relational, multi-dimensional, and most other objects found in a data warehousing environment. The specification is released and owned by the Object Management Group, which also claims a trademark in the use of &quot;CWM&quot;.

== Overview ==
The CWM specifies interfaces that can be used to enable interchange of warehouse and business intelligence metadata between warehouse tools, warehouse platforms and warehouse metadata repositories in distributed heterogeneous environments. CWM is based on three standards:
* UML – Unified Modeling Language, an OMG modeling standard
* MOF – Meta Object Facility, an OMG metamodeling and metadata repository standard
* XMI – XML Metadata Interchange, an OMG metadata interchange standard

CWM models enable users to trace the lineage of data – CWM provides objects that describe where the data came from and when and how the data was created. Instances of the metamodel are exchanged via XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) documents.

Initially, CWM contained a local definition for a data translation facility. It is not clear how the QVT final adopted specification will affect CWM.

== Support for the CWM ==

=== Submitters of CWM specification ===
While the Object Management Group owns the standard for CWM, some companies are considered co-submitters of the CWM specification. The following companies were listed as co-submitters to the v1.1 specification:
* International Business Machines Corporation
* Unisys Corporation
* NCR Corporation
* Hyperion Solutions Corporation
* Oracle Corporation
* UBS AG
* Genesis Development Corporation
* Dimension EDI

=== Compliance with the CWM specification ===
Software vendors claiming CWM support differ in the degree to which they comply with CWM. Some were co-submitters of the specification, and are actively using the OMG trademark in marketing literature. Other vendors have expressed support for CWM or claim they have products that are &quot;CWM-compliant.&quot;

Questions about compliance are addressed within the specification itself. Chapter 18 in both the 1.0 and 1.1 specification list required and optional compliance points.

The Object Management Group has a list of CWM implementations, but it is unclear how this list is maintained.

===Interoperability of CWM tools===
Compliance with the CWM specification does not guarantee tools from different vendors will integrate well, even when they are &quot;CWM-compliant&quot;. The OMG addressed some of these issues by releasing patterns and best practices to correct these problems in a supplementary specification, CWM Metadata Interchange Patterns

==Vendors supporting CWM==

===CWM implementations identified by OMG===
These vendors have been identified as having a CWM implementation or have active projects to support CWM.
*IBM
*Informatica produces Intelligence Data Platform with PowerCenter, a data integration tool with a metadata extension Enterprise Data Catalog (EDC) (metadata manager formerly known as SuperGlue is replacing by EDC). Informatica is one of the members of the OMG
*Oracle Corporation Oracle Warehouse Builder and Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler (formerly known as IKAN CWM4ALL)
*Pentaho
*prudsys AG – XELOPES library for embedded data mining
*SAS SAS adheres to the Object Management Group&#x27;s CWM as the interoperability and interchange standard. An alliance between SAS and Meta Integration Technology Inc. (MITI) enables SAS to provide bridges for sharing and exchanging metadata with more than 40 design tool and repository vendors

===Other vendors supporting CWM===
The following products or companies have claimed CWM support, but are not listed by OMG as having a CWM implementation. In some cases, the vendor may have implemented the v1.0 specification, which was replaced by the v1.1 specification. Refer to the software vendor to determine if the product is compliant with CWM or merely supports a subset of the required portions of the specification.
*Cognos, now a division of IBM, is listed as a supporter of CWM in the v1.1 specification. Cognos product literature claims support for &quot;Common Warehouse Model (CWM)&quot; but never mentions an actual OMG specification.
*Hyperion Solutions, now a division of Oracle Corporation
* InQuisient fully supports version 1.1 in its data repository.
* Pentaho Pentaho Open Source Business Intelligence Project has recently added &quot;Pentaho Metadata&quot; which supports CWM

<text>Strong Key is a naming convention used in computer programming. There can be more than one component (e.g.: DLL) with the same naming, but with different versions. This can lead to many conflicts.

A Strong Key (also called SN Key or Strong Name) is used in the Microsoft .NET Framework to uniquely identify a component. This is done partly with Public-key cryptography.

Strong keys or names provide security of reference from one component to another or from a root key to a component. This is not the same as tamper resistance of the file containing any given component. Strong names also are a countermeasure against dll hell.

This key is produced by another computer program as a pair.

<text>Christendom College is a private Catholic college in Front Royal, Virginia, United States. It was established in 1977.
==History==

=== 1977—2000 ===
Christendom College was founded by Warren H. Carroll, a contributor at &quot;Triumph&quot; magazine. Carroll decided not to accept federal funding at the college, choosing instead to rely on benefactors. Carroll served as president until 1985 and remained chairman of the history department until his retirement in 2002. 

Damian Fedoryka became the second president in 1985. During his seven-year tenure as president, Blessed Margaret and St. Joseph&#x27;s Halls were built, and the college received full accreditation in 1987.

In 1992, Timothy T. O&#x27;Donnell, a professor at Christendom since 1985, became the college&#x27;s third president. During his tenure, the college expanded to over 20 buildings and also acquired the Notre Dame Institute. In 1997, the Institute merged with Christendom College and became the Notre Dame Graduate School of Christendom College, now the Graduate School of Theology.

=== 2000—present ===
On May 1, 2023, Timothy O&#x27;Donnell announced his intention to retire from the college as President at the end of the 2023-24 academic year.

On July 1, 2024, George Harne became the college&#x27;s fourth President.

=== Christ the King Chapel ===
=== Student sexual assault and harassment allegations ===
On January 16, 2018, Catholic blogger Simcha Fisher broke the story of three rape and sexual harassment allegations that were brought to the college administration&#x27;s attention and mishandled. Timothy O&#x27;Donnell acknowledged victims in an official statement, saying, &quot;We have failed some of our students. I am grateful to each woman who has come forward with her story. We need to hear you and your experience. Disclosing abuse and its aftermath is painful and difficult, and it takes a tremendous amount of courage. To those students who have been harmed, I am deeply sorry. We will do better.&quot; This statement has since been removed from the college website. The college has since updated the apology with a Sexual Misconduct FAQs page that outlines the steps the college takes when cases of sexual misconduct are brought to its attention.

Since the story broke, at least 18 additional allegations of sexual violence and harassment over the past 45 years have been made. In response, a group of alumni called for the school to adopt Title IX policies to better protect students in the future and also called for the resignation of O&#x27;Donnell.

By refusing to accept most forms of federal funding, Christendom College is exempt from guidelines like Title IX, is not required to comply with federal regulations on sex-based discrimination, investigations into sexual abuse, or transparency regarding on-campus crimes.

The college has not released the results of this audit to the public.

=== Additional allegations against staff ===
Professor Emeritus William Raymond Luckey was arrested on June 25, 2021 on charges of solicitation of a minor younger than 16 years old and two counts of taking indecent liberties with a child.&quot; He was released on $50,000 bail on July 12, 2021. In regards to the 2018 sexual assault and harassment allegations, Luckey was one of several staff members that a college administrator mentioned as having been &quot;transitioned out.&quot; Luckey was a professor at Christendom College from 1984 until he retired in 2015, according to a statement on the college&#x27;s website. He has had no interaction with the school since 2015, the college said in an interview with The Northern Virginia Daily, adding that Luckey’s relationship with the school would not continue.

In 2022, Luckey appeared in court and pled guilty in order to receive a reduced sentence of time served, 24 months supervised probation, and must register as a sex offender.

== Accreditation and Admissions ==

Christendom College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

Christendom College does not use the FAFSA. Instead it uses the College Board&#x27;s CSS Profile to determine aid. According to their website, the typical student pays $25,000 per year to attend.

Christendom&#x27;s acceptance rate is 83% with a 47% yield rate. It has a freshman retention rate of 78% and a four-year graduation rate of 70%.

== Student life ==
In 2024, Christendom enrolled 554 students from 39 states and four countries. 

=== Student protests ===
Christendom College promotes its student-run pro-life group, Shield of Roses, on its web site, and students regularly protest at regional abortion clinics and other events, sometimes with the Bishop in attendance. Shield of Roses has been active since at least 2009 at major rallies, according to the school&#x27;s web site. The college publicized the closure of an abortion clinic in Silver Spring, Maryland, after Christendom College students protested there. Students protested at the Falls Church Health Care Center, where abortions are performed, in Falls Church, Virginia, in April 2017.

=== Athletics ===
Christendom&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Crusaders. The college is a member of the Eastern States Athletic Association, which is part of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA). Christendom competes at the USCAA Division II level in basketball, soccer and women&#x27;s volleyball. For sports such as baseball, cross country, and softball, the USCAA does not have separate divisions. Since the USCAA does not sponsor rugby, the men&#x27;s rugby team competes in National Collegiate Rugby&#x27;s Small College Division as a member of the Cardinals Collegiate Rugby Conference.

In 2017, Christendom&#x27;s rugby team won the National Small College Rugby Organization (NSCRO) 7s national championship. The team defeated St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland in overtime to capture the title, earning the school its first national championship. In 2021, the rugby team won its second rugby national championship defeating New Mexico Tech.

Christendom College women’s basketball team won its first national title in women’s basketball defeating Johnson &amp; Wales Charlotte 76-65 in the USCAA DII National Championship game in Petersburg, Virginia, on March 13, 2024.

<doc id="1022846" wikidata="Q7057912" url="?curid=1022846" title="North-east Indian railways during World War II">
<text>The efficient running of the North-east Indian railways during [[World War II]] became critical to the success of the Allied war effort in the South-East Asian Theatre.

At the start of the War the railways and water communications of north-east Indian Railways was not a major concern for the British Empire forces stationed in Burma as they could be supplied by sea through port in Rangoon (as could Chinese forces in south western China thought supplies passing up the Burma Road). However, when the Japanese attacked and forced the British back to the Indian Burmese border, the supply of material over the extended lines of communication from Calcutta to the front lines and over the Hump into China, became a critical issue for the Western Allies and the Chinese National Revolutionary Army (NRA) under the command of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. War time expediency, investment and ingenuity increased rail tonnage from around 600 tonnes a day to over 7,300 by January 1946.

==History==
In the initial phase of the war the Japanese advanced north from Rangoon through Burma forcing Allied forces to retreat into the mountains on the Indian Burma frontier. In doing so, not only did the Japanese threaten India, but they denied use of the Burma Road to the Western Allies, who had been sending supplies to Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army (NRA) by that route.

Behind this frontier, there was a series of railways in India which were essential to supply the Allied armies with logistics. They ran from the port of Calcutta to the hill station of Ledo in Assam. These logistics were not only needed by the British Fourteenth Army, and the American and Chinese troops at the end of the line under the command of General Joseph Stilwell&#x27;s Northern Combat Area Command, but also Allied forces in China.

Allied forces in China consisted of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s NRA, and American units based in China such as those involved in Operation Matterhorn. Allied forces in China were supplied by an airlift, over the Hump of the Himalayas, from the airfields (Ledo Airfield and perhaps few other) built close to the north east end of the railway, towards the end of the war this was supplemented by the use of the newly built Ledo Road which started close to the railhead in Ledo.

From port of Calcutta a broad gauge railway ran for to Parbatipur. Here goods had to be tran-shipped on to a metre-gauge train. This wandered up the Brahmaputra Valley to a ferry at Pandu which is from Calcutta. Once ferried across the river the train continued to Dimapur over from Calcutta. This was the main supply depot for the Fourteenth Army. If the supplies were destined for the Northern Combat Area or trans-shipment on to China, they had to be sent an additional to Ledo which is over from Calcutta.

The line had been built to serve the tea plantations of Assam and had a peacetime capacity of 600 tonnes a day. By the time the Fourteenth Army was formed in late 1943 this had risen to 2,800 tonnes. Up to Dimapur there were two other options, roads and river which could be used to supplement the rail tonnage. But there was no road to Ledo.

In early 1944, the American Army provided six battalions of dedicated railway troops, about 4,700 men. By October 1944 they had raised the capacity to 4,400 tonnes and by January 1946 to 7,300 tonnes a day. This was possible by the increase in staff from two British, or Indian, officers to twenty seven experienced American railroad men on the same length of line and the introduction of more powerful American and Canadian locomotives. Without the trebling of capacity, the supply of Chinese troops in China would not have been possible once the Japanese attacked India and the Fourteenth Army counterattacked.

It was possible to reach the Northern Front by river from Calcutta through the Sunderbans and then up the main stream of the Brahmaputra to Dibrugarh a distance of . For the Central (Assam) Front the river port at Gauhati could be used, but from there supplies had to travel over the already congested metre-gauge railway to Dimapur. The Southern Front could be reached by a combination of broad-gauge railway, river-steamers and then a metre-gauge railway which ended at Dohazari railhead.

To move supplies from the railheads to the Army fronts three all weather roads were constructed in record time during the autumn (fall) of 1943:
* The Ledo road in the north which went on to connect to the Burma road and supply China.
* The campaign winning Central Front road from Dimapur to Imphal.
* The southern road from Dohazari south of Chittagong for the advance to Arakan.

Much of the labour for the two British roads and for constructing the many airfields was done by the 40,000 labourers contributed by the Indian Tea Association who organised and managed them.

<text>Charles Morris Anderson (born 1957) is a landscape architect and fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects, He is a Principal of the Phoenix-based landscape architecture firm, Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture, which is the continuation of his practice of the Seattle-based firm Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture.

Anderson is recognized by the American Society of Landscape Architects for combining nature, community needs, and art into his designs, emphasizing sustainability, indigenous plants and urban ecology.

==Influences==
Anderson&#x27;s influences and contemporaries include Peter Walker, affiliated with the team involved in the World Trade Center Memorial project; Richard Haag, famous for his Gas Works Park project in Seattle; and Cornelia Oberlander, a Canadian landscape architect renown for the creative use of native plants on landmark projects like the Museum of Anthropology, Vancouver, BC.

Anderson also had a special interest in the work of Robert Smithson, an influential artist of the 1960s and 1970s, James Turrell, a contemporary artist who focuses on light and space, and Julie Bargmann, who focuses on regenerative landscapes.

==Charles Anderson==
Charles Anderson, FASLA is a Principal and Director of Urban Design/Landscape Architecture at Cuningham. A feature project in his portfolio is The Ellinikon Project in Athens Greece. This is one of the largest projects in Europe and Includes a Metropolitan Park of 500 acres, 200 acres of additional open space and a mile of coastline. Projects are national and international projects as well, including, Haiti and Vietnam.

Other notable projects by Charles Anderson include providing landscape design for the Anchorage Museum expansion, as well as Seattle&#x27;s Olympic Sculpture Park, Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, and Manhattan&#x27;s Arthur Ross Terrace.

Some neighborhood park projects include the Roxhill Wetland and Bog Park in West Seattle and the restoration of the 500 Area of Discovery Park, both of which received Merit Awards from the Washington Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects.

==Recognition==
The American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) awarded Anderson for his designs in the Tables of Water in Lake Washington (Washington State), the Mount Saint Helens National Volcanic Monument project, the Trillium Projects in Seattle, and the Arthur Ross Terrace design in Manhattan, New York and the Olympic Sculpture Park (4), Seattle, WA.

The Washington State Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects inducted Anderson into the Council of Fellows in 2006.

==Emo Urbanism (Big Nature)==
Anderson has defined his emerging design theory as “Emo Urbanism.” It is differentiated from other conceptual processes with a focus on art, culture, ecology, and the fourth dimension. He emphasizes authentic landscape—habitat and complete ecosystems—within an ordered human environment. His work on the Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle, WA is an example of this with its paradigm shift in nature/human interaction. Anderson&#x27;s stroke introduced entropic organization along Seattle&#x27;s Elliott Bay. His intervention created a native ecosystem responsive to flora, fauna, and the hard lines of existing infrastructure. Anderson made vital the natural processes that sustain a dynamic, human centered world.

The quality produced through Emo Urbanism is paramount to the tangible connection of person to place. Anderson has described this connection as the “thinness.” It is the simultaneous perception and implicit understanding of the past, present, and future. Excellent design will achieve this in a manner that is simple, immediate, and direct. Anderson believes that its traditional counterpart, “context,” is often just a justification to make a designer&#x27;s brand fit the site. Within Emo Urbanism, the brand is created from thinness. The result can embrace or contrast the physical manifestation of place, but it must always produce a unique fingerprint.

Current urbanism is pushing park space and outdoor amenity space to the rooftops in the most densely developed cities. Big Nature is the principal approach to a project that carries sustainable, indigenous focused landscapes to the rooftops in cities. Not as a purist notion but instead as a counterpoint to the contemporary view of the urban landscape. With this landscape will come the creatures that identify these landscapes as home.

The critical theory of Emo Urbanism was the basis for a seminar of the same name at the Arizona State University in 2012 and 2013.

==Urbanature==
Anderson defines the practice of Emo Urbanism as “urbanature.” In practice, he differentiates between the wilderness and wildness. Henry David Thoreau held that “in wildness is the preservation of the world.” Urbanature implements wildness—the authentic landscape—within the urban environment. Urbanature demonstrates that nature does not exist solely in an untouched wilderness. Ashton Nichols, a professor of English Language and Literature at Dickinson College, first developed the term in relation to ecocriticism and how people perceive the world around them. He states that “the interconnectedness demanded by urbanature insists that human beings are not out of nature when they stand in the streets of Manhattan any more than they are in nature when they stand in the mountain above tree-line in Montana.&quot; Urbanature provides the tangible benefits of nature in an environment not traditionally thought of as appropriate. A clear example can be seen in Project Phoenix, an in progress soccer stadium in Haiti. Here Charles has composed a landscape entirely of edibles and a lake containing tilapia for consumption. Composting and recycling facilities are also integrated. Anderson contends that the landscape cannot just be an aesthetic tool, it must also provide for the mental, physical, and social health of people regardless of where they live.

Anderson&#x27;s award-winning urbanature includes the Alaska Museum of History and Art, the Olympic Sculpture Park, and Trillium Projects and can be seen throughout his monograph, “Wandering Ecologies.”

<doc id="1022874" wikidata="Q529978" url="?curid=1022874" title="Thomas Church (landscape architect)">
<text>Thomas Dolliver Church (April 27, 1902 – August 30, 1978) was a 20th century landscape architect based in California. He is a nationally recognized as one of the pioneer landscape designers of Modernism in garden landscape design known as the &#x27;California Style&#x27;. His design studio was in San Francisco from 1933 to 1977.

==History==
Thomas Church was born in Boston, and raised in California, in Ojai and Oakland.

He received his B.A. degree in Landscape Architecture from the College of Agriculture at the University of California, Berkeley in 1922.
 He then attended the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he received his master&#x27;s degree in City Planning and Landscape Architecture in 1926.

After graduating, Church spent six months at the American Academy in Rome on a Harvard awarded Sheldon Traveling Scholarship. He also traveled throughout Europe, and while in France became friends with Catherine Bauer, with whom he would later teach at Berkeley. He studied Italian Renaissance gardens, and Moorish and Iberian Renaissance Spanish gardens, observing their responses to a climate so similar the Mediterranean climate in California. On returning from Europe he worked in a city planning office on the East Coast (1927–1928), then he taught at Ohio State University (1928–1930).

He returned to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1930, and was a Special Lecturer in the UC Berkeley Department of Landscape Architecture for the remainder of that year. He also went into private practice in 1930 to design the Pasatiempo Estates in the Santa Cruz area, with architect William Wurster. A 1937 trip was made to Finland, where seeing new modernist works and site planning by Alvar Aalto was influential to his design evolution.

He moved to San Francisco in 1932 and established his practice in The city. Church opened his own design studio in 1933, at 402 Jackson Street in San Francisco. He continued to practice there until his retirement in 1977. His own distinctive garden and residence were on Hyde Street, in the Russian Hill, San Francisco district.

Church was a longtime contributor to Architectural Forum, House Beautiful, and Sunset magazines, bringing his design ideas with examples to his design peers and the public.

In 1951 Church was awarded the Fine Arts Medal, for Landscape Architecture, by the American Institute of Architects. In 1973, Church was elected to the National Academy of Design, as an Associate Academician. He was also awarded the Rome Prize for his work in landscape architecture by the American Academy in Rome.

===Design innovation===
When Church started practicing, the Neoclassical style was still the predominant landscape design style. Thomas&#x27; design education at UC Berkeley and Harvard, along with his travels to gardens in Europe, gave him ample training in Classical and Renaissance garden traditions. However, Church is renowned as a pioneer in American landscape architect for introducing the Modernist architecture and art movements into landscape design. After WW II, other designers added to what later became known as the &quot;California Style&quot; of gardens. Some of them apprenticed in his design studio, including Robert Royston and Lawrence Halprin.

Church outlined four principles for his design process in his 1955 book &quot;Gardens Are For People.&quot; They are: 
*Unity — the consideration of the design as a whole, integrating the house and its gardens with a free flow between them. 
*Function — the relation of the outdoor recreational and social areas to their interior counterparts, and of the outdoor service areas to the household&#x27;s needs, to please and serve the people who live in them.
*Simplicity — upon which rests the aesthetic and economic success of the design.
*Scale — relating the different design parts, features, and areas to one another, to create a whole an integrated landscape design.

Church used the Modernist design principles for freedom of elements, such as the forms of spaces and features, and a sense of movement. When possible, he favored creating multiple viewpoints, instead of a traditional single axis. &quot;A garden should have no beginning and no end,&quot; he wrote in &quot;Gardens Are for People&quot;, &quot;and should be pleasing when seen from any angle, not only from the house.&quot; He could also use historicist design principles when the site called for it, such as the formal lines of the Memorial Courtyard (1965) beside the San Francisco Opera House.

Another design element Church is renowned for is the &quot;outdoor room,&quot; creating sub-areas for outdoor living as distinct places within the whole landscape. They were different than those of Italian Renaissance gardens with a separation of house and garden, his outdoor rooms interacted with the house, with a free flow between the two 

&quot;Tommy represented freedom from &#x27;decorating&#x27; a house,&quot; said former Sunset editor Walter Doty, shortly before Church&#x27;s death. &quot;Landscaping had meant gussying up structures that weren&#x27;t worth it. Tommy was a &#x27;behavioral&#x27; landscaper . . . gardens to live in were more important.&quot;

===Works===
The majority of Church&#x27;s work was residential, and he reportedly designed over 2,000 private gardens in California and 24 other states. Notable residential works include the now iconic landscape design of &quot;El Novillero&quot; (Donnell Gardens) for the Donnell Residence (1947–1948), overlooking the winding salt marshes of the North Bay in Sonoma County, California. Others include the Mrs. Clinton Walker House in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, and the Bloedel Reserve and Lakewold Gardens in Washington state.

He also worked on a number of larger non-residential landscape commissions. He worked on campus master plans for UC Berkeley, Stanford University, UC Santa Cruz, Harvey Mudd College, Woodside Priory School, and the Wascana Centre in Saskatchewan. He designed the grounds of the Embassy of the United States, Havana, the General Motors Research Laboratory in Detroit (1949–1953), the Des Moines Art Center, the Hotel El Panama in Panama City, the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and Parkmerced (1941–1951) in southwestern San Francisco.

He was the landscape design consultant to Stanford University for 30 years, beginning in the late 1940s. He served on the Stanford Architectural Advisory Council from 1960 to 1978, that President J.E. Wallace Sterling created. &quot;Church was trying to put a layer of continuity around the original buildings and the new (ones), he was working on a (campus) landscape that was meant to tie all this together.&quot;

==Death==
Thomas Church died on August 30, 1978, at the age of 76, in Russian Hill, San Francisco.

===Legacy===
Thomas Church had a long, distinguished, and productive career with over 4,000 projects, as a Landscape Architect. He also wrote several influential and popular landscape design books, including &quot;Gardens Are for People&quot; (1955) and &quot;Your Private World: A Study of Intimate Gardens&quot; (1969).

The Post-war Modernist garden design style, first in California and soon influential across the United States, was created and developed by a small group of landscape designers, of which Thomas Church was the &quot;first founder.&quot; The subsequent founders and practitioners of the Modern California Landscape include Garrett Eckbo, Robert Royston, James C. Rose, and Dan Kiley.

<doc id="1022877" wikidata="Q266395" url="?curid=1022877" title="A Death in the Family (comics)">
<text>&quot;A Death in the Family&quot; is a 1988 storyline in the American comic book &quot;Batman&quot;, published by DC Comics. It was written by Jim Starlin and penciled by Jim Aparo, with cover art by Mike Mignola. Serialized in &quot;Batman&quot; #426–429 from August to November 1988, &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; is considered one of the most important Batman stories for featuring the death of his sidekick Robin at the hands of his archenemy, the Joker.

Jason Todd, the second character to assume the Robin persona, was introduced in 1983 to replace Dick Grayson, who was unavailable for use at the time. Jason became unpopular among readers after 1986, as writers began to characterize him as rebellious and impulsive, and Starlin advocated killing him off. Editor Dennis O&#x27;Neil was considering having Jason revamped or written out of &quot;Batman&quot; when he recalled a 1982 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch in which Eddie Murphy encouraged viewers to call the show if they wanted him to boil a lobster on air. Inspired to orchestrate a similar stunt, DC set up a 900 number voting system to allow fans to decide Jason&#x27;s fate.

&quot;A Death in the Family&quot; begins when Batman relieves Jason of his crime-fighting duties. Jason travels to the Middle East to find his biological mother, but is kidnapped and tortured by the Joker. &quot;Batman&quot; #427 ends with the Joker blowing Jason up in a warehouse. Starlin and Aparo prepared two versions of the following issue: one that would be published if readers voted to have Jason survive, and another if he was to be killed. A narrow majority voted in favor of the latter, and &quot;Batman&quot; #428 features Batman discovering Jason&#x27;s lifeless body in the warehouse ruins. The storyline ends when Batman and Superman stop the Joker from killing the United Nations General Assembly. The story was controversial and widely publicized; despite Jason&#x27;s unpopularity, DC faced backlash for the decision to kill one of its most iconic characters.

Retrospective reviewers agreed with the decision to kill Jason and have ranked &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; among the best Batman stories, though its plot has been criticized as nonsensical and its depiction of the Middle East as Islamophobic. Jason&#x27;s death had a lasting effect on Batman stories, with Batman&#x27;s failure to save him pushing the comic book mythos in a darker direction. Tim Drake succeeded Jason as Robin in 1989, and Jason was resurrected as the Red Hood in the &quot;&quot; (2004–2006) storyline. &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; remains a popular story among readers and has been reprinted in trade paperback form since its initial publication. Plot elements have been incorporated into Batman films, television series, and video games. An animated interactive film adaptation, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2020.

==Publication history==
===Background===

Robin, the adolescent sidekick of the DC Comics superhero Batman, first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #38 in April 1940. He was introduced by Bob Kane, Bill Finger, and Jerry Robinson to give Batman a companion and increase his appeal to children. The original Robin, Dick Grayson, made regular appearances in Batman publications from 1940 until the early 1980s, when Marv Wolfman and George Pérez began including him in the &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; comics. So Robin could continue appearing in Batman comics, &quot;Batman&quot; writer Gerry Conway and artist Don Newton introduced Jason Todd in &quot;Batman&quot; #357 (March 1983). Wolfman and Pérez had Dick set aside the Robin identity and become the independent superhero Nightwing in &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, while Jason became Robin in the Batman comics.

Originally, Jason&#x27;s origin story was virtually identical to Dick&#x27;s; like Dick, Jason was depicted as the son of circus acrobats, who became Batman&#x27;s sidekick after his parents were murdered. Dennis O&#x27;Neil, who wrote &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; throughout the 1970s and became the Batman group editor in 1986, said that Conway and Newton worried about creating a new character. I think they thought, &#x27;We&#x27;ve got to have a Robin in the series so let&#x27;s go with the tried and true. This Robin has worked for so many years, so let&#x27;s do him again. Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (1985–1986) crossover event, which rebooted the DC Universe, &quot;Batman&quot; writer Max Allan Collins was asked to reintroduce Jason. &quot;Batman&quot; #408 (June 1987) began a four-issue story by Collins and artist Chris Warner that reimagined Jason as a street delinquent whom Batman attempts to reform.

The revamped Jason was unpopular among readers, who disliked his rebellious, impulsive nature. A scene in &quot;Batman&quot; #424 (June 1988) in which Jason seemingly breaks Batman&#x27;s no-killing rule and lies about it was particularly controversial. After Collins quit over creative differences, writer Jim Starlin and penciler Jim Aparo took over &quot;Batman&quot;. Starlin disliked Robin, as he found the concept of a crimefighter using a child as a sidekick ridiculous. He initially avoided featuring Jason, but began to use him at the request of O&#x27;Neil. Starlin &quot;decided to play on that dislike&quot; in his stories. By 1988, the &quot;Batman&quot; creative team knew Jason presented a problem that needed to be resolved.

===Development===
O&#x27;Neil decided that Jason either needed another personality revamp or to be written out of &quot;Batman&quot;. Around that time, DC was planning to publish a comic promoting HIV/AIDS education, and requested that writers submit suggestions for characters to kill off from AIDS. Starlin, who had advocated killing Robin when he began writing &quot;Batman&quot;, filled the suggestion box with proposals to kill off Jason, but DC staff rejected the idea after realizing all the papers had Starlin&#x27;s handwriting. However, DC president Jenette Kahn wanted to address Jason&#x27;s unpopularity. O&#x27;Neil and Kahn attended an editorial retreat, where O&#x27;Neil recalled a 1982 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch in which Eddie Murphy encouraged viewers to call one of two 900 numbers if they wanted him to boil a lobster on air. The sketch garnered widespread publicity and nearly 500,000 viewers called in. O&#x27;Neil proposed a similar stunt involving one of the DC characters, which Kahn found intriguing.

O&#x27;Neil decided that Jason was &quot;the logical candidate to be in peril&quot;, as he was unpopular and placing him in such a situation would have massive ramifications. He said: &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to waste it on anything minor. Whether Firestorm&#x27;s boots should be red or yellow ... This had to be important. Life or death stuff&quot;. Kahn added that they wanted to allow fans to have input in what to do with Jason, rather than &quot;autocratically&quot; writing him out and replacing him. The idea of having fans call to influence the creative process was a novel concept at the time, and DC&#x27;s sales and marketing vice president Bruce Bristow described setting up the numbers as the most difficult part of the project. Sales manager John Pope began calling AT&amp;T to secure the two 900 numbers on October 1, 1987; it took him until March 1988 to reserve them.

Six months after Starlin proposed killing Jason, O&#x27;Neil asked him to start working on a potential story. Starlin decided to have the Joker murder Jason, inspired by &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; (1986), a limited series by Frank Miller that featured Batman retiring after the Joker kills Robin. Starlin wrote scripts for a six-issue story, and the decision was made to combine the first four across two issues to speed up the story because fans were participating. Aparo, inker Mike DeCarlo, and colorist Adrienne Roy provided the art, and assistant editor Dan Raspler suggested Mike Mignola as the storyline&#x27;s cover artist. &quot;Batman&quot; #427 features Batman arriving at a warehouse where Jason is imprisoned just as it explodes. On the back cover, an advertisement featured Batman carrying a severely wounded Jason. Readers were warned that Jason could die of his injuries, but that they could &quot;prevent it with a telephone call&quot;. Two 900 numbers were given: one (1-(900) 720–2660) which would let Robin live, and another (1-(900) 720–2666) which would cause him to die. The numbers were activated for 35 hours in the United States and Canada from 9:00a.m. Eastern Standard Time on September 15, 1988.

Starlin and the artists prepared two versions of &quot;Batman&quot; #428, depending on the outcome. As O&#x27;Neil stated: &quot;It really could have gone either way. We prepared two choices of balloons. We had alternate panels. We had everything set up so that the two outcomes could be accomplished with a minimum of changes. We prepared for either situation&quot;. Raspler explained that Aparo prepared three alternate pages and several panels with static images that could be easily rearranged. O&#x27;Neil voted to let Jason live, as he felt killing the character would complicate his job as an editor, and Starlin was unable to vote because he was in Mexico at the time. O&#x27;Neil and Raspler checked the results every 90 minutes. DC executive editor and vice president Dick Giordano expected readers to vote in favor of Jason&#x27;s survival; O&#x27;Neil believed they would vote for his death to see if DC would follow through.

The poll received 10,614 votes and 5,343 voted for Jason&#x27;s death over 5,271 for his survival—a margin of just 72 votes. Although Kahn dispelled rumors that the process was rigged in favor of Jason&#x27;s demise, O&#x27;Neil said it was possible many votes favoring Jason&#x27;s death came from a single person. He recalled hearing that &quot;a lawyer programmed his Macintosh to dial the killing number every few minutes&quot;, but had no evidence. O&#x27;Neil canceled a party he planned to throw once the verdict was in and decided to keep the result secret until &quot;Batman&quot; #428 was shipped. O&#x27;Neil did not tell his wife, Starlin, or Aparo. Starlin had expected Jason to die but was surprised by how close the vote was. Production director Bob Rozakis supervised Roy as she finished coloring, and then had Steve Bove take the &quot;real&quot; &quot;Batman&quot; #428 to finish it in the secrecy of his basement.

===Publication===
&quot;A Death in the Family&quot; was published when Batman was surging in popularity. Following the success of &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and the &quot;&quot; (1987) storyline, monthly sales for &quot;Batman&quot; were at their highest level since the early 1970s, and Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) feature film was in production. DC announced &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; shortly after the release of the critically acclaimed graphic novel &quot;&quot; in 1988; according to author Chris Sims, the &quot;Batman&quot; letter column immediately &quot;broke out into debate&quot; over whether Jason should live or die.

&quot;Batman&quot; #426, the first issue of &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;, was released on August 23, 1988, and &quot;Batman&quot; #427, the second, was released two weeks later, on September 6. Fans voted to determine Jason&#x27;s fate between September 15 and 16, and &quot;Batman&quot; #428, which featured Jason&#x27;s death, was released on October 18. The storyline concluded with &quot;Batman&quot; #429, on November 29. The last two issues contained a guest appearance from Superman.

After the first three issues of &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; sold out, DC compiled the storyline into a trade paperback in time for the 1988 Christmas shopping season. The collection, &quot;Batman: A Death in the Family&quot;, shipped on December 5, less than a week after &quot;Batman&quot; #429. A 2009 hardcover reprint included Wolfman, Pérez, and Aparo&#x27;s 1989 sequel storyline, &quot;&quot;, which introduced Jason&#x27;s successor Tim Drake. A hardcover deluxe edition was published in April 2021.

For many years, the version of &quot;Batman&quot; #428 in which Jason lives remained unpublished, though the pages remained housed in DC&#x27;s archives in Burbank, California. &quot;Batman Annual&quot; #25, published in March 2006, used one of the alternate pages Aparo had prepared; some panels were released by Les Daniels in his book &quot;Batman: The Complete History&quot; (1999) and by &quot;Polygon&quot; journalist Susana Polo in 2020. In March 2020, the &quot;DC Daily&quot; web show unveiled all of the pages to the public for the first time, and the artwork was published in the 2021 deluxe edition. A physical facsimile issue of the alternate pages, including the original advertisements and letters column, was published on December 12, 2023.

==Synopsis==
While eavesdropping on a child pornography ring and awaiting police backup in Gotham City, Jason Todd (Robin) ignores Batman&#x27;s orders and attacks the criminals. Batman chastises Jason and asks if he considers crimefighting a game; Jason replies that life is a game. At Wayne Manor, Batman decides Jason is emotionally unstable and relieves him of his duties as Robin; an enraged Jason storms off. Meanwhile, the Joker escapes from Arkham Asylum. Batman discovers that he has obtained a nuclear weapon and plans to sell it to terrorists, and tracks him to war-torn Lebanon.

Walking through his old neighborhood, Jason meets a friend of his late parents, who gives him his father&#x27;s old documents. Jason discovers that his mother&#x27;s name on his birth certificate is blotted out. Her first initial is &quot;S&quot;, not &quot;C&quot; as in Catherine Todd, the woman he knew as his mother. Jason concludes that Catherine was his stepmother and decides to search for his biological mother. He uses the Batcomputer to track three possible individuals to the Middle East and Africa. Jason travels to Lebanon, where he and Batman reunite. The two foil an attempt by terrorists to destroy Tel Aviv using the nuclear missile purchased from the Joker. Batman agrees to help Jason find his mother, and Jason interrogates his first suspect, Mossad agent Sharmin Rosen. His next suspect, Batman&#x27;s old acquaintance Lady Shiva, says she is not Jason&#x27;s mother after she is administered a truth serum by the duo.

Batman and Jason travel to Ethiopia and confirm that Jason&#x27;s mother is Sheila Haywood, an aid worker; Jason has an emotional reunion with her. However, the Joker discovers that Sheila had performed illegal surgeries on teenagers in Gotham and has been blacklisted as a medical practitioner. He blackmails her into giving him the medical supplies her agency has stockpiled in a warehouse. He sells them on the black market and stocks the warehouse with Joker venom, which will kill thousands of people. Jason witnesses the Joker blackmail Sheila, so he reveals his identity as Robin to her and offers to help. Shelia rebuffs him, as she has been embezzling from the aid agency; in an attempt to cover this up, she hands Jason over to the Joker. The Joker beats Jason with a crowbar and restrains him and Sheila in the warehouse with a time bomb. Jason throws himself on the bomb to protect Sheila as the warehouse explodes. Batman arrives too late to save them, and Jason and Sheila die from their injuries.

Traumatized, Batman takes Jason and Sheila&#x27;s remains to Gotham and holds a burial with Alfred Pennyworth, Commissioner James Gordon, and Barbara Gordon. Batman blames himself for Jason&#x27;s death and resolves to carry on alone, rejecting Alfred&#x27;s suggestion to involve Dick Grayson, the first Robin. Ayatollah Khomeini approaches the Joker and offers him a role in the Iranian government. The Joker leaves a warehouse containing the corpses of his henchmen and the address of the UN Headquarters for Batman. As Batman waits outside the UN building, Superman appears and tries to convince Batman to leave. The Joker is Iran&#x27;s representative to the UN and will be giving a speech on the floor of the General Assembly, and any confrontation between Batman and him could start a diplomatic incident.

During his speech, the Joker attempts to poison the chamber with Joker venom, but Superman intercepts it. Batman pursues the Joker onto a helicopter sent by his sponsors. During the resulting struggle, one of the Joker&#x27;s henchmen opens fire with a machine gun and shoots the pilot, crashing the helicopter into the sea. Superman saves Batman, but the Joker disappears. Batman laments that everything between him and the Joker ends unresolved.

==Reception==
===Initial===

The first three chapters of &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; sold out quickly, and according to Starlin, the storyline was DC&#x27;s bestselling comic of 1988. The storyline drew coverage in news outlets including &quot;USA Today&quot;, Reuters, and the &quot;Deseret News&quot;. Many reports did not mention that Jason was not the original Robin. As an editor at Marvel Comics, O&#x27;Neil had received angry mail from fans when characters such as Phoenix and Elektra were killed, so he was prepared for reader backlash to Jason&#x27;s death. However, &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; created much more controversy, as Robin was one of DC&#x27;s most iconic characters and the Marvel deaths had occurred during a period of recession in comics.

O&#x27;Neil spent the days following &quot;Batman&quot; #428&#x27;s publication &quot;doing nothing but talking on the radio. I thought it would get us some ink here and there and maybe a couple of radio interviews. I had no idea—nor did anyone else—it would have the effect it did&quot;. After three days, Peggy May, DC&#x27;s publicity manager, ordered O&#x27;Neil to stop talking to the media. She also barred anyone from discussing the story on television. Though initially confused, O&#x27;Neil came to appreciate May&#x27;s order because he did not want the public to see him as &quot;the guy who killed Robin&quot;. Assistant editor Dan Raspler was chastised by DC&#x27;s then-executive vice president Paul Levitz for referring to &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; as a &quot;stunt&quot; in an interview.

Jason&#x27;s death divided fans at the time. Many readers celebrated, some hoping it meant that Dick could become Robin again. Others lamented how bloodthirsty comic book readers were. O&#x27;Neil and the &quot;Batman&quot; team received hate mail and angry phone calls; according to O&#x27;Neil, the calls ranged from You bastard&#x27;, to tearful grandmothers saying, &#x27;My grandchild loved Robin and I don&#x27;t know what to tell him. Frank Miller was critical, calling the story &quot;the most cynical thing [DC] has ever done ... fans can call in to put the axe to a little boy&#x27;s head. To me the whole killing of Robin thing was probably the ugliest thing I&#x27;ve seen in comics&quot;. NPR cultural critic Glen Weldon found the criticism ironic, as it was Miller who came up with the idea of the Joker killing Jason in &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;.

===Retrospective===
Critics have agreed with the decision to kill Jason in retrospect. Sims wrote that killing Jason was &quot;unquestionably the right decision&quot; and made for a far better story. He opined that allowing the Joker to defeat Batman enhanced both characters: the Joker became &quot;a deadly threat... whose actions have lasting consequences&quot;, while Batman had &quot;a motivating loss at a time when new readers were coming in&quot;. Hilary Goldstein of &quot;IGN&quot; and Jamie Hailstone of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; praised the story&#x27;s handling of Jason&#x27;s death for its emotion and portraying the dangers of superheroics.

Retrospective reviewers have faulted &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; for its plot. Hailstone described &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; as &quot;the ultimate 80s epic&quot;: &quot;brasher than &quot;Top Gun&quot;, louder than Hulk Hogan and more implausible than &quot;The A-Team&quot;&quot;. Both Hailstone and Goldstein found the plot hard to believe, and Hailstone said that it veers into nonsense when the Joker is appointed as an ambassador. Charles Prefore, writing for &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, said the story &quot;can&#x27;t decide if it wants to be fun or dark&quot;; while Jason&#x27;s torture and death at the hands of the Joker is quite somber, elements like the &quot;globetrotting nature of the story&quot; and the Joker becoming an ambassador for Iran are evocative of the goofy Silver Age of Comic Books. Prefore said the story&#x27;s grim moments, which caused &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; to gain a reputation as one of the darkest Batman stories, overshadow the rest of its outlandishness.

&quot;A Death in the Family&quot; remains a popular story among readers, and despite their reservations over the plot, critics still deemed it worth reading. Hailstone called the story a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; that, while not as groundbreaking as &quot;Year One&quot; or &quot;&quot; (1987), was entertaining nonetheless, and Prefore summarized it as &quot;a good read if you don&#x27;t mind all the strangeness&quot;. Publications ranking it among the best Batman stories include &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Complex&quot; in 2014, and &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; and &quot;Screen Rant&quot; in 2021. Sean T. Collins of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it among the 15 Batman stories he considered &quot;essential&quot; to understanding the character, praising Aparo&#x27;s art and how Starlin characterizes the Joker.

==Analysis==
Despite Robin&#x27;s status as one of the most famous sidekicks in comic book history, there has been little literary analysis of &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;. According to literary critic Kwasu Tembo, it is generally only discussed &quot;as either a case study within a broader discussion of Batman&#x27;s ethics, or as a case study of DC&#x27;s editorial decisions and socio-historical engagement with its readership&quot;. The story&#x27;s message is that Batman cannot save everyone, and it portrays Jason as a tragic figure whose sympathetic journey ends in death. Tembo contended that the death leaves the reader to ponder Jason&#x27;s nature as &quot;Batman&#x27;s greatest failure, as an orphan betrayed, and/or as a careless and overzealous lost boy who reaped what he had so impulsively and thoughtlessly sown&quot;.

Tembo theorized that Jason&#x27;s death, as voted for by readers, &quot;can be more thoroughly understood as a complex form of scapegoating&quot;, comparable to a public execution. Jason was unpopular because he struggled to live up to the standard of his predecessor Dick, which made him a &quot;bad&quot; Robin. This created jealousy among readers, who concluded that Jason was unfit to be Robin. Citing René Girard&#x27;s theory of mimetic desire, Tembo wrote that O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s decision to let fans determine Jason&#x27;s fate created a &quot;mimetic crisis&quot; because readers &quot;could now not only influence [Jason&#x27;s] existence in the story world, but in being given this power, compete against him&quot;. Readers instead saw themselves as more fit to be Batman&#x27;s partner; by voting to kill Jason, they thought they were helping Batman. Tembo noted the closeness of the vote indicated fans may not have despised Jason as much as commonly believed. Fans who voted to save Jason may have voted to preserve the classic status quo, or because they found the Joker murdering a child during an emotional period in his life unsettling.

=== Depiction of the Middle East and Islam ===
Written in the aftermath of the Iran–Contra affair, &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; reflects American attitudes towards the Middle East in the 1980s, and has been criticized as inaccurate and relying on racist caricatures. Starlin writes Batman as speaking Farsi, the Persian language, in Beirut (where Arabic is actually the commonly spoken language), and the Joker dons a traditional Arab headdress and robes as the Iranian ambassador, although Iran is not an Arab country. Chrishaun Baker of &quot;Inverse&quot; described the Joker&#x27;s alliance with Khomeini as &quot;the culmination of an embarrassing series of storytelling gaffs that flattens the complexities of Middle Eastern turmoil into a homogenous caricature of racial stereotypes&quot;.

Several writers have described the portrayal of Arab terrorists as Islamophobic. They are depicted as anti-American, anti-Israel fanatics who seek to violently take over the Western world. They are referred to as &quot;bandits-in-bedsheets&quot; and depicted as unshaved and always holding weapons, while Jamal, the terrorist leader, is overweight and perpetually sneering. In a 1991 study of Arab terrorist depictions in comic books, Jack Shaheen wrote that &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; conflates Arabs, Muslims and terrorists, and equates them to the Joker, an insane supervillain. Jehanzeb Dar and Shaheen cited the Joker&#x27;s speech to the General Assembly as a particularly egregious example of Islamophobia. Before he attempts to poison the chamber, the Joker gloats:

Dar described the Joker&#x27;s speech as blatant Islamophobia disguised as humor. Shaheen and Dar argued &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; promotes the idea of &quot;Them vs. Us&quot;, pitting the Arab and Western worlds against each other as diametrically opposed in values. Dar said that and [DC]&#x27;s disregard for cultural, religious, and political accuracy simply points to a crude and racist generalization: Arabs, Iranians, and Muslims are all the &#x27;same&#x27; and &#x27;hate&#x27; the West&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;A Death in the Family&quot; was part of the American comic book industry&#x27;s trend towards &quot;grim and gritty&quot; comics in the late 1980s, and is remembered as one of DC&#x27;s most controversial storylines. Chris Snellgrove of &quot;Looper&quot; described the scenes depicting Jason&#x27;s torture and death—with the Joker covered in his blood— as &quot;one of the most disturbing moments in the publisher&#x27;s long history&quot;. DC editors took the lessons they learned from the controversy and used media coverage for publicity when killing off major characters in the future, such as Superman in &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; (1992–1993).

Although &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; sold well, it harmed Starlin&#x27;s standing at DC. DC&#x27;s licensing department was infuriated over the death because of the amount of merchandise—such as lunchboxes and pajamas—that bore Robin&#x27;s likeness. According to Starlin, &quot;everybody got mad, and they needed somebody to blame—so I got blamed&quot;. Work quickly declined for him, and within six months he departed DC and returned to Marvel Comics, where he wrote &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; (1991).

===Effect on future stories===
&quot;A Death in the Family&quot; is regarded as one of the most important Batman comics for its effect on future Batman stories. The story altered the DC Universe: instead of killing anonymous bystanders, the Joker murdered a core character in the Batman fiction. Alongside &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; (which featured Barbara Gordon, Batgirl, being shot in the stomach and paralyzed) and the success of the 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; film, &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; pushed the Batman mythos in a darker direction. It portrayed Batman as more violent and emotional following Jason&#x27;s death, and for the next decade of comic book canon, he was haunted by his failure to save him. Conway felt that the storyline allowed for &quot;the entrance of the real &#x27;Dark Knight&#x27;, the idea of Batman as the pitiless enforcer of Gotham&quot;. When the DC Universe continuity was rebooted during DC&#x27;s 2011 New 52 initiative, the events of &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; were left intact because DC editors deemed it too important.

Jason was likely to be replaced as Robin regardless of his survival. O&#x27;Neil wanted to wait a year for a successor, but DC management demanded a new Robin immediately. O&#x27;Neil and Wolfman began developing the character of Tim Drake, who debuted in the 1989 storyline &quot;A Lonely Place of Dying&quot; by Wolfman, Pérez, and Aparo. O&#x27;Neil arranged for a nuanced introduction that explained why Batman would need a new sidekick after Jason&#x27;s death, and Tim was designed to appeal to both Jason&#x27;s fans and detractors. Tim proved popular and starred in several limited series and a 1993–2009 ongoing series, until he was replaced by Damian Wayne in 2009. Damian shared Jason&#x27;s willingness to go against Batman&#x27;s wishes and use lethal force; Grant Morrison and Frazer Irving&#x27;s &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; #13 (2010) featured a scene in which Damian beat the Joker with a crowbar, paralleling Jason&#x27;s murder.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Jason&#x27;s death was one of the few comic book deaths that remained unreversed. Unlike traditional comic book deaths, Jason&#x27;s was intended to stay permanent; at the time of &quot;A Death in the Familys publication, O&#x27;Neil said that &quot;it would be a really sleazy stunt to bring him back&quot;. A popular aphorism among comic book fans was that in comics, no characters stayed dead except Bucky Barnes, Uncle Ben, and Jason. Jason&#x27;s revival was first teased in the &quot;&quot; (2002–2003) storyline by Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee, which features Clayface impersonating an undead Jason to taunt Batman. After writer Judd Winick read &quot;Hush&quot;, he wondered why DC never revived Jason. Winick and artist Doug Mahnke&#x27;s 2004–2006 storyline &quot;&quot; revived him as the murderous vigilante Red Hood; the in-universe explanation for Jason&#x27;s revival was that he was restored to life after Superboy-Prime punched the wall of a pocket dimension. Jason eventually re-joined Batman&#x27;s supporting cast as an &quot;on-again, off-again ally&quot;, and starred in the series &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot; (2011–2021). Despite his resurrection, in 2020 journalist Susana Polo noted Jason was still most famous for dying in &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;.

===In other media===
Bruce Timm and Paul Dini considered adapting &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; for &quot;&quot; (1992–1995), but decided it was too violent. Instead, they omitted the Jason character and incorporated some of his characteristics in Tim when the series was rebranded as &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; (1997–1999). The story was eventually adapted in the comic book sequel &quot;&quot; (2020), written by Dini and Alan Burnett and penciled by Ty Templeton. In the &quot;Adventures Continue&quot; adaptation, the Joker and Harley Quinn kidnap Jason, and the Joker beats him with a crowbar with intent to kill him. Harley objects to killing a child and finds Batman, who arrives as the warehouse is engulfed in flames due to hydrogen tanks. A wounded Jason begs for Batman to kill the Joker, but Batman instead tries to save him; Jason attempts to stop Batman but knocks over more hydrogen tanks, causing the explosion and his apparent death.

Elements from &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; were incorporated in the 2010 DC Universe Animated Original Movies film &quot;&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Under the Hood&quot; directed by Brandon Vietti. In the film, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul (Jason Isaacs) hires the Joker (John DiMaggio) to distract Batman (Bruce Greenwood) and Jason (Jensen Ackles) while he destroys Europe&#x27;s financial districts. They follow the Joker to Bosnia, where he kills Jason in similar fashion to &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;. An interactive film adaptation, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2020. The film is a sequel to &quot;Under the Red Hood&quot;, Vietti again directing. The cast of &quot;Red Hood&quot; returned to reprise their roles, with the exception of Vincent Martella, who replaced Ackles. Similar to the voting system from the comic, the film allows viewers to determine if Jason lives or dies, leading to different scenarios that see him become Red Hood, Hush, or Red Robin.

&quot;A Death in the Family&quot; is referenced in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), a shared universe of superhero films based on DC characters. &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016) features a damaged Robin suit on display in the Batcave, while &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (2016) reveals that Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) helped the Joker (Jared Leto) murder him. &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; (the 2021 director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017)) features a scene in which the Joker mocks Batman (Ben Affleck) for Robin&#x27;s death. Though Warner Bros. and &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; director David Ayer stated that the dead Robin was Jason, &quot;Batman v Superman&quot; director Zack Snyder later said he had intended it to be Dick, unlike &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;. Snyder had planned to explore Robin&#x27;s death in detail in his &quot;Justice League&quot; sequels before their cancellation. Before the release of &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot;, Snyder proposed a comic book prequel to &quot;Batman v Superman&quot; that depicted Robin&#x27;s death, but DC turned it down.

In &quot;Emperor Joker&quot;, a 2010 episode of &quot;&quot; (2008–2011), a fourth wall-breaking Bat-Mite (Paul Reubens) references &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; and the 900 number, and Batman is briefly seen cradling a dead Robin. Jason&#x27;s portrayal in the video game &quot;&quot; (2015) was inspired by &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;. The DC Universe and HBO Max streaming television series &quot;Titans&quot; (2018–2023) features Jason as a central character portrayed by Curran Walters. After the second season episode &quot;Deathstroke&quot; (2019) ended on a cliffhanger with Deathstroke (Esai Morales) attempting to kill Jason, DC Universe held a poll in which fans could vote to determine Jason&#x27;s fate. The poll was only intended as a reference to &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; and had no effect on the series, but elements from &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; were incorporated in the third season of &quot;Titans&quot;, which premiered in 2021.

<text>Rural delivery service refers to services for the delivery of mail to rural areas. 

In many countries, rural mail delivery follows different rules and practices from that in urban areas. For example, in some areas rural delivery may require homeowners to travel to a centralized mail delivery depot or a community mailbox rather than being directly served by a door-to-door mail carrier; and even if direct door-to-door delivery is offered, houses still may even not have their own unique mailing addresses at all, but an entire road instead may be assigned a single common address, such as a rural route number.

Examples include Rural Free Delivery in the United States, the rural route system in Canada, and the Rural Mail Box addressing system in Australia.

Because of the differences in the handling and delivery of mail in rural areas, rural letter carriers often follow different regulatory standards from urban postal workers; for example, rural postal delivery workers may not be required to wear a uniform and may be allowed to use their own vehicles rather than driving a postal truck. In Canada, rural letter carriers were for many years not considered employees of Canada Post but private contractors.

<doc id="1022888" wikidata="Q6705761" url="?curid=1022888" title="Lutheran school">
<text>A Lutheran school is a school associated with Lutheranism. They were common amongst Lutherans who migrated to the United States and Australia from Germany and Scandinavia.

==Australia==
The first Lutheran school in Australia opened in 1839. At 2013, there were twenty-seven Lutheran-run primary and secondary schools in Queensland, thirty-three in South Australia and sixteen in Victoria, with a much smaller number in each of the other states and territories. The body overseeing these is Lutheran Education Australia, which has a branch in each State.

There has been a very significant growth in Australian Lutheran school enrolments over the twenty-five years and particularly in the decade up tp 2011. As of August 2011, 37 313 Australian children attended Lutheran schools, with another 3 600 in early childhood centres. At this time, there were 3 249 teachers employed at Lutheran schools around Australia.

==United States==

When the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) was founded in 1847, this tradition of Lutheran education was continued. The synod was started by twelve churches that operated a total of nineteen schools. Several of the churches operated a number of schools in the rural countryside so that students would not have to walk too far to school each day.

For the most part, Lutheran schools are operated by individual congregations. Some schools are operated by groups of congregations, or &quot;associations&quot;. The schools are autonomous in that they hire their own teachers, select their own curriculum, and set their own fees. In the past most of the costs were paid by the operating congregations. With the economic situation that exists today more and more of the operating funds come from tuition and fees.

The LCMS operates the largest Protestant school system in the United States. As of the 2017-18 school year, the LCMS operates 1,127 Early Childhood Centers, 778 elementary schools, and 87 high schools. The LCMS also operates ten universities and two seminaries. These schools educate more than 180,000 students and are taught by almost 22,000 teachers. Lutheran schools operated by the LCMS also exist in Hong Kong, mainland China, and Vietnam.

The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) currently operates 393 early childhood education centers (largely preschools), 304 elementary schools, and 29 high schools. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) operates 1,573 early childhood programs, 296 elementary schools, and 14 high schools as of December 31, 2018.

In 2011, Valparaiso University recorded 140 Lutheran high schools in operation of various denominations.

<text>Onsala Space Observatory (OSO), the Swedish National Facility for Radio Astronomy, provides scientists with equipment to study the Earth and the rest of the Universe. The observatory operates two radio telescopes in Onsala, 45 km south of Gothenburg, and takes part in several international projects. Examples of activities:
* The 20 and 25 m telescopes in Onsala: Studies of the birth and death of stars, and of molecules in the Milky Way and other galaxies.
* LOFAR station: The Swedish station in the international radio telescope LOFAR is located at the observatory.
* VLBI: Telescopes in different countries are linked together for better resolution (&quot;sharper images&quot;).
* ALMA, e-VLBI, Herschel Space Observatory, SKA: Developing and using new radio astronomical facilities.
* APEX: Radio telescope in Chile for sub-millimetre waves. Research about everything from planets to the structure of the Universe.
* Odin: Satellite for studies of, e.g., the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and molecular clouds in the Milky Way.
* Space geodesy: Radio telescopes (VLBI) and satellites (GPS) are used to measure movements in Earth&#x27;s crust and water vapour in the atmosphere.
* Receiver development: Laboratories for development of sensitive radio receivers.
* Event Horizon Telescope: A project to create a large telescope array for observing the immediate environment of the Milky Way&#x27;s supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, et.c.

Onsala Space Observatory was founded in 1949 by professor Olof Rydbeck. The observatory is hosted by Department of Earth and Space Science at Chalmers University of Technology, and is operated on behalf of the Swedish Research Council.

== 25-metre telescope ==
The 25.6 m diameter, polar mount decimeter-wave telescope in Onsala is equipped with receivers for frequencies up to 7 GHz. It is used for astronomical VLBI observations. It is also operated as a single dish for studies of molecular clouds in the Galaxy. The telescope was built in 1963.

== 20-metre telescope ==

The 20 m diameter millimetre wave telescope in Onsala is equipped with receivers for frequencies up to 116 GHz. It is used for observations of millimetre wave emission from molecules in comets, circumstellar envelopes, and the interstellar medium in the Galaxy and in extragalactic objects. The telescope is enclosed in a radome of diameter 30 m.

It is also used for astronomical VLBI observations of star forming regions, radio stars, and active galactic nuclei, and for geodetic VLBI observations to study e.g. crustal dynamics and polar motion. The telescope was built in 1975-76 and upgraded in 1992.

It is also used, as part of the European and worldwide networks, for astronomical Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of star forming regions, radio stars, and active galactic nuclei, and for geodetic VLBI observations to study e.g. crustal dynamics and polar motion.

===Receivers===
The telescope is equipped with the following receivers:

==LOFAR station==
The Swedish station in the international radio telescope LOFAR is located at Onsala Space Observatory. It was completed in 2011.

==Nordic ALMA node==
The Onsala Space Observatory currently hosts the Nordic ALMA node, which is part of the European ALMA regional centre (ARC). The Nordic ALMA node provides face-to-face support for any astronomer that wants to use the ALMA telescope and primarily supports the Nordic scientific community.

<text>The Centre for Talented Youth Ireland (CTYI) is a programme for students of high academic ability between the ages of six and seventeen in Ireland.

There are sibling projects around the world, most notably the CTY programme at Johns Hopkins University, the original model for CTY Ireland. CTY students are eligible to participate in CTY&#x27;s summer sessions for older students. CTY was founded in 1992, with its first summer programme running in 1993, and is based at Dublin City University in Glasnevin, Dublin 9. The centre offers various courses for gifted students as well as conducting research and promoting the needs of the talented in Ireland.

Currently, it caters for 5,000 students a year. Its current director is Colm O&#x27;Reilly.

== Eligibility ==
Eligibility for CTYI&#x27;s programmes is based on scores in the School and College Ability Test. Students who score within the top 5th percentile are eligible for the top tier of CTY programmes, and those who score within the top 10th percentile are eligible for a second tier, CAT, while students who score within the top 15th percentile are eligible for a third tier, the Summer Scholars programme.

CTYI also allows for bright and motivated students to partake in courses such as correspondence courses, and scholarships can be attained for EUE or the secondary school summer programme. Students can also attend on a psychologist&#x27;s recommendation.

== Programmes ==
=== Primary school programmes ===
Saturday courses are offered for primary school students at various colleges and institutes of technology around Ireland throughout the year. There are courses for both the 6–7 age group and the 8–13 group. DCU also run classes on Wednesday afternoons.

===Secondary school programmes ===
A summer programme for 12–17 year-olds (1st – 5th year) as part of CAT or CTY runs only at DCU premises. These courses give students the opportunity to study college-style and college-level courses intensively for three weeks in the summer in one of two sessions, each of which lasts three weeks.

Because of the Irish financial situation in the mid-2000s, fewer people were able to afford the cost of the programme, especially after the Government cut CTYI&#x27;s funding in 2009. Since, students can now attend both sessions of the course, and the age bracket has been increased to include children up to age seventeen.

Some of the students at the summer programme come from overseas, mostly from continental countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy. Owing to the intensive nature of the programme, a substantial proportion of the 190–250 students who attend each session are residential, living in student accommodation for the duration of the course. However, students can also commute, attending the course as the residential students do but going home at the end of the day and returning in the morning.

In 2018, the following courses were offered:

* Biomedical Engineering
* Clinical Psychology
* Child Psychology 
* Computer Gaming
* Game Theory
* International Relations
* Japanese Language and Culture
* Law
* Medicine
* Neuroscience
* Novel Writing
* Robotics
* Theoretical Physics
* Maths Experience
* Computer Animation
* Criminology
* Film Studies
* Genetics &amp; Cell Biology
* Marine Biology
* Philosophy
* Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy Writing
* Sports Science
* Radio, TV, &amp; Digital Communications
* Moot Court

The CAT (for children in the 85th to 95th percentile) version of the programme ends after two weeks and so has a slightly different course matter.

Weekdays in the summer programme are highly structured, with lectures from 9am to 3pm, with a lunch break. Activities take place from 3.15pm to 5pm, supervised by the residential assistants (RAs), while from 5pm and 6:30pm students have dinner and are required to attend a meeting with their RA group. 6:30pm to 8:30pm is taken up by the study period, which is supervised by the teaching assistant, and social time takes place between 8:30pm and 10pm, with lights-out at 10.30pm.

On weekends, social activities such as discos, shopping trips, visits to the cinema, excursions to various interesting sights in Ireland and talent shows are organised.

=== Early University Entrance ===
EUE is a programme for Transition Year students in secondary school. Like the summer programme, it runs on a DCU campus, with students covering two modules (equivalent to what a first year college student in DCU would study) over a semester, one day a week each week (usually Fridays). In 2018, subjects included Law &amp; Politics, Business, Engineering, and Psychology. EUE is open to CAT- and CTY-qualifying students.

=== Other courses === 
The centre runs correspondence courses throughout the year for 12- to 16-year-olds and also for Transition Year students who do not have to fulfil any aptitude test requirements. Courses include or have included Writing By Mail, Journalism, Psychology, Philosophy, Legal Studies, and Science of Tomorrow. There are also correspondence courses for younger students (8–13) in computing-related subjects and Writing By Mail.

==Staff==
===Permanent===
Dr. Colm O&#x27;Reilly – Director

Dr. Catriona Ledwith – Assistant Director

Dr. Leeanne Hinch – Academic Coordinator

Dr. Orla Dunne – Residential Coordinator

Ms. Lynne Mooney – Young Student Manager

Ms. Linda Murphy – Post-Primary Manager 

Ms. Ruth Lally- Post-Primary Administrator 

Ms. Cathy Woods – Early University Entrance Administrator 

Ms. Hazel Skinner - Early University Entrance Administrator

===Contract staff===

As the on-site programmes available for students are part-time and/or short-term, most of the staff associated with these programmes are contracted for a set period of time. Residential staff are hired for either 3 or 6 weeks (summer programme only) while academic staff are hired for 3 weeks, 6 weeks, or on a part-time basis during the year (e.g. an eight-week Saturday course).

====Assistant Residential Coordinators (ARCs)====
These staff (usually 2, 1 male and 1 female) are responsible for the care of the students at CTYI during the 12–17 summer courses. They live in the residences with the students and are the highest-ranking staff members when the Residential Coordinator is absent (e.g., at night). They are in charge of the RAs also. ARCs are often ex-RAs, who return to hold a higher point of authority. An ARC may hold the position for a number of years running, e.g. former ARC Mary Heslin held the position for 4 years running.

====Residential Assistants (RAs)====
RAs are responsible for the care their RA group (normally a group of 18–22 students) and they report to the ARCs. Any residential students will bring up issues with their RAs. They may also act as mentors to the students if they are having problems settling in. Typically there is a mix between former CTYI students and those who have not attended the programme.

====Instructors====
Instructors are generally professionals or postgraduate students who are willing to give up 3 weeks of a year to work with CTYI&#x27;s students. They are hired on the basis of specialist knowledge in a particular field and a rapport with young people. Some are former CTYI students and/or have worked on the programme as RAs or TAs. In the past they have included lecturers at DCU, but stricter regulations within the university now prohibit DCU staff from taking on &#x27;a second contract&#x27;.

====Teaching Assistant (TA)====
A TA&#x27;s primary function is to assist the instructor during class time and supervision and assisting students during study period.

====Coordinator====
On the part-time programmes during the year, additional administrative staff are hired to co-ordinate Saturday programmes.

==Funding cut, 2009==
It was announced in the post-crash 2009 Irish budget that the government would not continue directly contributing to CTYI funding. Up to 2008, the Department of Education had been providing the course with a grant of €97,000. The move to withdraw funding was criticised by CTYI staff but a spokesperson for the Department of Education said that &quot;the resources available for next year meant that difficult choices had to be made and the abolition of the grant to the Centre for Talented Youth was one of those tough decisions.&quot; The government had previously planned to allow CTYI to become a national mandate.

<text>Charles Bridgeman (1690–1738) was an English garden designer who helped pioneer the naturalistic landscape style. Although he was a key figure in the transition of English garden design from the Anglo-Dutch formality of patterned parterres and avenues to a freer style that incorporated formal, structural and wilderness elements, Bridgeman&#x27;s innovations in English landscape architecture have been somewhat eclipsed by the work of his more famous successors, William Kent and Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown.

==Career==
Little is recorded of the early life of Charles Bridgeman. He was born in 1690 and raised in modest circumstances. His father was a gardener who is reported to have worked at Wimpole Hall in Cambridgeshire for the Earl of Oxford. The younger Bridgeman entered the landscaping profession by working for the Brompton Park Nursery. By 1714 he had begun working with Henry Wise, with whom he later shared the title of Chief Gardener for the royal gardens (Strong, 1992, 39). Bridgeman married Sarah Mist in 1717.

An early proponent of a less-structured garden design, Bridgeman was a pioneer in the landscape style that spread throughout much of Europe in the 18th century and came to be known as the &quot;jardin anglais&quot;. A contemporary of Bridgeman&#x27;s, Horace Walpole, describing his colleague&#x27;s design style in his essay &quot;On Modern Gardening&quot;, wrote: &quot;though he still adhered much to strait walks with high clipt hedges, they were only his great lines; the rest he diversified by wilderness, and with loose groves of oak, though still within surrounding hedges&quot; (Amherst, 1896, p. 249). Bridgeman’s approach to landscaping can be summarised in three terms: formal, transitional and progressive. His landscapes displayed formal elements such as parterres, avenues, geometrically shaped lakes and pools, and kitchen gardens. Transitional elements in his designs included lawns, amphitheatres, garden buildings and statues, winding paths through wooded areas to viewing points and the use of ha-has; these features are some of the progressive ideas he helped bring into favour.

Bridgeman made a name for himself among the artisans of the day with his often dramatic redesigns of the estate gardens belonging to wealthy English nobles. He laid out the extravagant garden of Lord Cobham at Stowe, which compiled temples, pillars, finely carved stone statues, summer houses, and a miniature replica of an Egyptian pyramid (Amherst, 1896, p. 251). This was perhaps most his most renowned work. English essayist and poet Alexander Pope wrote of Bridgeman&#x27;s creations at Stowe as being the &quot;work to wonder at&quot; (Batey, et al., 1990, p. 168).

Bridgeman participated in the design of a garden at Rousham House in Oxfordshire that included cascades, fountains, square pools, an outdoor theatre, and a wilderness area that could be viewed from a vantage point within the main garden. Batey and Lambert (1990, p. 156) wrote of this garden: &quot;at Rousham the views out into the countryside are as important as those in the garden&quot;. Other estate gardens Bridgeman had a hand in planning include Claremont, Cassiobury Park, Cliveden, Chiswick House, Kew Gardens, Wimpole Hall, Briggens House in Essex, and Amesbury Abbey in Wiltshire.

However, Bridgeman perhaps remains best known for his tenure as Royal Gardener for Queen Anne and Prince George of Denmark. He was promoted to this position, which he held for ten years, upon the retirement of his mentor, Henry Wise. As Royal Gardener, Bridgeman tended – and in many cases, redesigned – the royal gardens at Windsor, Kensington Palace, Hampton Court, St. James&#x27;s Park and Hyde Park.

<doc id="1022909" wikidata="Q714839" url="?curid=1022909" title="Tadeusz Kotarbiński">
<text>Tadeusz Marian Kotarbiński (; 31 March 1886 – 3 October 1981) was a Polish philosopher, logician and ethicist.

A pupil of Kazimierz Twardowski, he was one of the most representative figures of the Lwów–Warsaw School, and a member of the Polish Academy of Learning (PAU) as well as the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN). He developed philosophical theory called &quot;reism&quot; () and an ethical system called independent ethics. Kotarbiński also contributed significantly to the development of praxeology.

Henryk Greniewski and Kazimierz Pasenkiewicz were doctoral students under Kotarbiński.

==Life==
Tadeusz Kotarbiński was born on 31 March 1886 in Warsaw, then Congress Poland, Russian Empire, into an artist&#x27;s family. His father, Miłosz Kotarbiński, was a painter his mother, Ewa Koskowska, was a pianist and composer. His uncles were Józef Kotarbiński, an important figure in Polish theater circles, and Wilhelm Kotarbiński, a talented painter. Expelled from secondary school in 1905 for participating in a strike, Kotarbiński managed to graduate two years later. He studied first as an unenrolled student at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, attending mostly lectures on mathematics and physics; then architecture in Lviv and Darmstadt, to finally settle for studies in philosophy and classical philology at the University of Lviv. His professors were some of the most esteemed philosophers, logicians and mathematicians of his time: Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Władysław Witwicki and philologist Stanisław Witkowski. He received his PhD with the thesis &quot;Utilitarianism in the Ethics of Mill and Spencer&quot; in 1912.

After graduation, he taught classical languages at Warsaw&#x27;s Mikołaj Rey Gymnasium (secondary school). In 1918 he began a lecturing career in philosophy at Warsaw University; from 1929 to 1930 he was dean of humanities. In the interwar period, Kotarbiński was involved in social affairs. He actively fought against anti-semitism, ultranationalism and clericalism. He wrote mainly for the monthly &quot;Racjonalista&quot;, an organ of the Polish Association of Freethinkers. During the persecution of students of Jewish origin at Polish universities, when right-wing organizations tried to designate separate sectors in lecture halls for non-Polish students, he jointly joined their protest, during which he conducted his lectures while standing. He was an opponent of the ghetto benches introduced at the University of Warsaw in 1937. In his activities, close to the left-wing and socialist groups, he was a member of the Polish Teachers&#x27; Union, being in the years 1937–1939 president of the Higher School Section.

After World War II, along with other eminent men of learning, he helped create a state university in Łódź. In 1945 Kotarbiński became the first rector of the University of Łódź, holding this post until 1949 while simultaneously working at the University of Warsaw. His model of work became a benchmark for future generations of scholars at the University of Łódź.

==Philosophy==

===Reism===
Reism is a pansomatism (from Greek: πᾶν &#x27;all&#x27; + σῶμα &#x27;body&#x27;) ontology as well as semantic theory developed by Kotarbiński and most extensively exposed in his major work: &quot;Elements of the Theory of Knowledge, Formal Logic and Methodology of the Sciences&quot;, first published in 1929. Kotarbiński was the creator of the term reism, a word derived from Latin &quot;res&quot; &#x27;thing&#x27;.

===Ontological reism===

Kotarbiński&#x27;s ontological reism approach assumes that the only things that exist, and thus the only ontological category to be used, are individual, concrete objects (or bodies) in opposition to doctrines allowing for the existence of such categories as universals, states of affairs, properties, relations, sets, classes, mental constructs, etc.

===Semantic reism===
In its semantic formulation, Kotarbiński postulated that meaningful sentences have to contain so-called genuine names (referring to concrete objects) as opposed to abstract objects&#x27; names or non-genuine names (onomatoids). He also distinguished onomatoids from empty names, which he considered to be reistic. Sentences with onomatoids only were in his view meaningless, whereas those with empty names meaningful.

Reism has been anticipated by philosophers preceding Kotarbiński (Leibniz, Brentano and his pupils and earlier nominalists and materialists), but it was Kotarbiński who developed it to the complete, systematic exposition and gave it its name.

In 1958 in &quot;Philosophical Studies&quot; 4(7) Kotarbiński published &quot;Developmental Stages of Concretism&quot;, an essay in which he discussed the construction and evolution of his theory starting from the early concretism or nominalism, passing through seven stages of re-elaboration and finally culminating in pansomatism. Kotarbiński used terms: reism, pansomatism and concretism as equivalents to some extent throughout his works.

===Praxeology===
Kotarbiński was the most prominent representative and promoter of the science of efficient action, called praxeology. Scholars consider Kotarbiński&#x27;s works in praxeology as the most systematic exposition of the foundations of this young science, particularly in his &quot;Traktat o dobrej robocie&quot; (A Treatise on Good Work) and, to some extent, his earlier publication called &quot;Szkice praktyczne&quot; (&quot;Essays on Practice&quot;).

Kotarbiński posited that praxeology is a science that is broader than the science of work as it contains philosophical elaboration of the concept of action, especially in the context of human work process, including the recommendations and general solutions for human activities in different fields. His position is considered partially descriptive in the sense that its aim is to understand relevant features of actions, but that the classifications it produces have normative objectives. Kotarbiński&#x27;s contribution to the understanding of the nature of action is considered foundational for action theory (philosophy)

Three years after publishing &quot;A Treatise on Good Work&quot;, Kotarbiński persuaded the Polish Academy of Sciences to establish a Laboratory for General Questions of Work Organization (&quot;Pracownia Ogólnych Problemów Organizacji Pracy&quot;), later upgraded into a Department of Praxeology. Starting in 1962, it published a periodical, &quot;Materiały Prakseologiczne&quot; (Praxeological Papers), later renamed &quot;Prakseologia&quot; (Praxeology).

<text>Jean-Bernard Gauthier de Murnan (1748 in Bourg-en-Bresse – 27 September 1796) was a French officer for the Continental Army and a French general during the French Revolution.

Jean-Bernard Gauthier was born in a family of jurists in Bourg-en-Bresse (now Ain ) of France. He was baptized on 28 November 1748. He became an officer in the French Royal Army. When he was young, he had to leave France after a duel. He served as a cavalry officer and then military engineer in the Imperial Russian Army. He was hired as a lieutenant in a regiment of dragoons in Smolensk. He was under the command of Prince Golitsyn until 1776, when he became Captain-Engineer, after studying at the Moscow University.

When he returned to France, he was sent to support the newly born United States as a Lt. Colonel of the Engineers in the Continental Army. In the French Revolutionary Army, he was appointed Colonel of the Infantry, then Colonel of the Cavalry, and then promoted to a Brigade General in command of the cavalry.

==American Revolutionary War service==
He was later sent to the United States with a group of military engineers, including Captain Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant and Colonel Louis Lebègue Duportail to support the Americans, who lacked military engineers, during the Revolutionary War. It is pointed out that the massive French military participation took place in 1781. Starting in January 1777, he was under the direction of General John Sullivan. In March 1778, he was promoted to major in the US Army Corps of Engineers by the Continental Congress. He participated in the Massachusetts Campaign in 1778.

Then, with General George Washington, he served in the Sullivan Expedition against the &#x27;six Indians Nations&#x27;, up to the current Wyoming. Under French Brigadier General Marquis de Choisy, he took part to the besieging of York and Gloucester in 1781. Following a special decision of the US Congress, he was commissioned in September 1783 lieutenant colonel by brevet by the Continental Army.

==French Army service==
In 1784, he returned to France. He married Andrée Claudine Sain on 30 September 1784, in Lyon. He was back in the French Army when the First Coalition against the revolutionaries in France took place (see also French Revolutionary Wars).

In 1791, he was promoted lieutenant-colonel, serving in the infantry, then serving as from May 1791, namely in Sedan retrenched camp. He was then promoted colonel, serving as Chief-of-Staff of the Army on the Sambre. In 1792, he became Colonel of the 35th Infantry Regiment. Therefore, he was at the Battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792 and the Battle of Jemmapes on 6 November 1792. In January 1793 he became colonel of the 13th Dragoon Regiment. Promoted as Brigade-General, he commanded the right flank of the Northern Army with General Adam Philippe Custine. Tired, he left the army and retired around Bourg-en-Bresse. He was twice arrested during the La Terreur in spring 1794. He died on 27 September 1796, in Villereversure, Ain.

For his duties, he received Croix de Saint-Louis in 1791, and for his services during the American Revolutionary War he became member of the Society of the Cincinnati in 1783.

He was the uncle of First French Empire General Aubry, killed at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, and cousin of the member of the revolutionary French National Convention Gauthier des Orcières, also called Gauthier de l&#x27;Ain.

<text>Military education and training is a process which intends to establish and improve the capabilities of military personnel in their respective roles. Military training may be voluntary or compulsory duty. It begins with recruit training, proceeds to education and training specific to military roles, and sometimes includes additional training during a military career. Directing staff are the military personnel who comprise the instructional staff at a military training institution.

In some countries, military education and training are parts of the compulsory education. The organizers believe that military education can bring some benefits and experiences that cannot be obtained from normal class like setback education. Moreover, participants are able to learn survival skills during the military education, like co-operations and resilience, which help participants improve the capabilities of military personnel in their respective roles.

== Recruit training ==

The primary and initial form of military training, recruit training, makes use of various conditioning techniques to resocialize trainees into a military system, to ensure that they will obey all orders without hesitation, and to teach basic military skills.
Resocialization as a sociological concept involves the process of mentally and emotionally &quot;retraining&quot; individuals so that they can operate in a new environment; it promotes changes to an individual&#x27;s attitudes and behaviours. The drill instructor has the task of making the service members fit for military use.

== Role-specific training ==
After their recruit training, personnel may undergo further training specific to their military role, including the use of any specialist equipment. They are then normally deemed fit for military service.
== Further training ==
Military personnel may continue to receive training during their career.

<text>Corel Photo-Paint is a raster graphics editor developed and marketed by Corel since 1992. Corel markets the software for Windows and Mac OS operating systems, previously having marketed versions for Linux (Version 9, requiring Wine). Its primary market competitor is Adobe Photoshop.

In 2006, Corel released version 13 as &quot;Photo-Paint X3&quot;, employing this naming convention for subsequent releases as well as for CorelDraw, included with Photo-Paint in CorelDraw Graphics Suite. The current version is Photo-Paint 2020. Corel has marketed a limited edition of Photo-Paint called &quot;Corel Photo-Paint SELECT&quot; with HP scanning hardware, e.g., the HP ScanJet 5p scanners.

== Features ==
Photo-Paint&#x27;s native format is .CPT (Corel Photo-Paint Image), which stores image data as well as information within an image, including objects (layers in some raster editors), colour profiles, text, transparency, effect filters.

The program can open and convert vector formats from CorelDraw and Adobe Illustrator and can open other formats, including PNG, JPG and GIF files — as well as competing photo editor formats from Photoshop, GIMP and Paint Shop Pro (the latter also a Corel product). The program also supports plug-in functionality including those developed for Adobe Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro. Other extensions such as brushes are also compatible with Photo-Paint.

Corel Photo-Paint X6–X7 supports OpenType font features. With X7 Update 4 the Font List new additional features in X7 Update 4 allows for filtering type fonts by weight, width, supported scripts, font Technology, Character Range, Style.

As other raster graphics editors, Corel Photo-Paint allows an image to be edited in multiple layers, called objects here. A gradient line going from opaque to transparent, for instance, can be used to have a darker foreground color fade into a lighter background color. The UI is highly customizable, and the user can freely move dialogs or adjust button sizes and such. Effects can be applied to a picture including Smart Blur—a type of Gaussian blur effect which however retains sharpness around sharper edges—Mesh Warp, Camera Lens Flare, Trace Contour and others. There is limited support for vector paths to be integrated. Depending on personal preferences and work style, users may prefer Corel Photo-Paint over Adobe Photoshop or the other way round, though in terms of market share, Photoshop is clearly more represented.

As a component of the CorelDraw Graphics Suite, Photo-Paint can exchange data with other programs in the suite, including Corel Connect (Version X5 - X7), which enables users to share files between different computer software and drives on the user&#x27;s computer. CorelDraw and Photo-Paint are also copy-paste compatible, with format and effects retention — and without file conversion.

Just like in CorelDraw, Photo Paint tasks can be automatized by scripts and macros, using both COREL Script and Microsoft&#x27;s VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) and VSTA (Visual Studio Tools for Applications). Corel calls the smaller macros created with COREL Script &quot;Scripts&quot;, and the scripts created with the Microsoft tools &quot;macros&quot;.

<text>The Detroit–Windsor tunnel (), also known as the Detroit–Canada tunnel, is an international highway tunnel connecting the cities of Detroit, Michigan, United States and Windsor, Ontario, Canada. It is the second-busiest crossing between the United States and Canada, the first being the Ambassador Bridge, which also connects the two cities, which are situated on the Detroit River.

==Overview==
The tunnel is long (nearly a mile). At its lowest point, the two-lane roadway is below the river surface. There is a wide no-anchor zone enforced on river traffic around the tunnel.

The tunnel has three main levels. The bottom level brings in fresh air under pressure, which is forced into the mid level, where the traffic lanes are located. The ventilation system forces vehicle exhaust into the third level, which is then vented at each end of the tunnel.

==History==
=== Construction ===
Construction began on the tunnel in the summer of 1928.

The Detroit–Windsor tunnel was built by the firm Parsons, Klapp, Brinckerhoff and Douglas (the same firm that built the Holland Tunnel). The executive engineer was Burnside A. Value, the engineer of design was Norwegian-American engineer Søren Anton Thoresen, while fellow Norwegian-American Ole Singstad consulted, and designed the ventilation.

Three different methods were used to construct the tunnel. The approaches were constructed using the cut-and-cover method. Beyond the approaches, a tunneling shield method was used to construct hand-bored tunnels. Most of the river section used the immersed tube method in which steam-powered dredgers dug a trench in the river bottom and then covered over with of mud. The nine -long tubes measured in diameter.

The Detroit–Windsor tunnel was completed in 1930 at a total cost of approximately $25 million (around $ in dollars). It was the third underwater vehicular tunnel constructed in the United States, following the Holland Tunnel, between Jersey City, New Jersey, and downtown Manhattan, New York, and the Posey Tube, between Oakland and Alameda, California.

Its creation followed the opening of cross-border rail freight tunnels including the St. Clair Tunnel between Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario, in 1891 and the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel between Detroit and Windsor in 1910.

The cities of Detroit and Windsor hold the distinction of jointly creating both the second and third tunnels between two nations in the world. The Detroit–Windsor tunnel is the world&#x27;s third tunnel between two nations, and the first international vehicle tunnel. The Michigan Central Railway Tunnel, also under the Detroit River, was the second tunnel between two nations. The St. Clair Tunnel, between Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario, under the St. Clair River, was the first.

===Operations since 2007===
In 2007, billionaire Manuel Moroun, owner of the nearby Ambassador Bridge, attempted to purchase the American side of the tunnel. In 2008, the City of Windsor controversially attempted to purchase the American side for $75 million, but the deal fell through after a scandal involving then-Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.

Soon afterward, the city&#x27;s finances were badly hit in a recession and the tunnel&#x27;s future was in question. Following Detroit&#x27;s July 2013 bankruptcy filing, Windsor Mayor Eddie Francis said that his city would consider purchasing Detroit&#x27;s half of the tunnel if it was offered for sale.

On July 25, 2013, the lessor, manager and operator of the tunnel, Detroit Windsor Tunnel LLC, and its parent company, American Roads, LLC, voluntarily filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The American lease was eventually purchased by Syncora Guarantee, a Bermuda-based insurance company. Soon afterward, the lease with Detroit was extended to 2040. Both Syncora and Windsor retained the Windsor-Detroit Tunnel Corporation to manage the daily operations and upkeep of the tunnel. In May 2018, Syncora sold its interest in American Roads, LLC for $220 million to DIF Capital Partners, a Dutch-based investment fund management company specializing in infrastructure assets.

A $21.6 million renovation of the tunnel began in October 2017 to replace the aging concrete ceiling, along with other improvements to the infrastructure. Completion of the project was initially scheduled for June 2018, but is ongoing as of 2021.

== Usage ==
The Detroit–Windsor tunnel crosses the Canada–United States border; an International Boundary Commission plaque marking the boundary in the tunnel is between flags of the two countries. The tunnel is the second-busiest crossing between the United States and Canada after the nearby Ambassador Bridge. A 2004 Border Transportation Partnership study showed that 150,000 jobs in the region and $13 billion (U.S.) in annual production depend on the Windsor-Detroit international border crossing. Between 2001 and 2005, profits from the tunnel peaked, with the cities receiving over $6 million annually. A steep decline in traffic eliminated profits from the tunnel from 2008 until 2012, with a modest recovery in the years since.

=== Traffic ===
About 13,000 vehicles a day use the tunnel despite having one lane in each direction and not allowing large trucks. Historically, the tunnel carried a smaller amount of commercial traffic than other nearby crossings because of physical and cargo restraints, as well as limits on accessing roadways. Passenger automobile traffic on the tunnel increased from 1972, until it peaked in 1999 at just under 10 million vehicle crossings annually. After 1999, automobile crossings through the tunnel declined, dropping under 5 million for the first time in over three decades in 2007. Traffic on the tunnel later recovered slightly in the following years when the economy began to improve after 2008.
===Tolls===
Tolls were last increased on the Canadian side in July 2021, 37% for those using Canadian currency and 11% using American currency. Standard tolls for non-commercial Canada-bound vehicles are US$7.50 and C$7.50; United States-bound tolls are also US$6.75 but C$6.75. For frequent crossers, the Nexpress Toll Card for cheaper rates. Commercial vehicles and buses are charged higher rates. Motorcycles, scooters and bicycles are prohibited.

== Features ==

===Tunnel truck for disabled vehicles===
When the tunnel first opened in the 1930s the operators had a unique rescue vehicle to tow out disabled vehicles without having to back in or turn around to perform this role. The vehicle had two drivers, one facing in the opposite direction of the other. The vehicle was driven in, the disabled vehicle was hooked up, then the driver facing the other way drove it out. This emergency vehicle also had of water hose with power drive and chemical fire extinguishers.

===CKLW, WJR and the tunnel===
In the late 1960s, Windsor radio station CKLW AM 800 engineered a wiring setup which has allowed the station&#x27;s signal to be heard clearly by automobiles traveling through the tunnel. Currently Detroit radio station WJR AM 760 can be heard clearly in the tunnel.

===Ventilation===
The upper and lower levels of the tunnel are used as exhaust and intake air ducts. One hundred-foot ventilation towers on both ends of the tunnel enable air exchange once every 90 seconds.

<doc id="1022950" wikidata="Q5588896" url="?curid=1022950" title="Government House (British Columbia)">
<text>Government House of British Columbia is the official residence of the lieutenant governor of British Columbia in Victoria and is vice-regal residence. It has casually been described as &quot;the Ceremonial Home of all British Columbians.&quot; It stands in the provincial capital on a estate at 1401 Rockland Avenue; while the equivalent building in many countries has a prominent, central place in the capital, the site of British Columbia&#x27;s Government House is relatively unobtrusive within Victoria, giving it more the character of a private home.

==History==
The first building in the area used specifically as a governor&#x27;s residence was Cary Castle, built in 1860 by George Hunter Cary and purchased five years later by the British Crown for use as an official residence for the Governor of Vancouver Island, with Arthur Kennedy, CB, being the first occupant. Following the 1866 merger of the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island, the mainland colony&#x27;s Government House in New Westminster was abandoned to other uses and Cary Castle became the official residence of the new united colony&#x27;s Governor and, from 1871 onwards, that of the provincial Lieutenant Governor.
The mansion and its contents were destroyed by fire in May 1899, with a replacement immediately built to designs by Francis Rattenbury and Samuel Maclure. Completed in 1903, this house was used for the first time by the reigning monarch of Canada when King George VI, accompanied by his wife, Queen Elizabeth, arrived in 1939 as part of his cross-Canada tour that year. However, that incarnation of Government House also burnt down when it caught fire on 15 April 1957; the current Government House was begun soon after and completed on 19 May, two years later by John Laing &amp; Sons. The new home was furnished with pieces bought in the United Kingdom by Lieutenant Governor Frank Mackenzie Ross and then donated to the Crown following his departure from office, as well as other items donated by various British Columbians.

By 2002, through the efforts of Lieutenant Governor Iona Campagnolo, Government House and its surrounding gardens were designated as a National Historic Site of Canada and the acknowledging plaque was unveiled by Campagnolo on 2 October of that year.

==Ownership and use==
Government House is where visiting foreign dignitaries are greeted and often stay while in Victoria. It is also where numerous vice-regal events take place, such as the bestowing of provincial awards or inductions into the Order of British Columbia, as well as luncheons, dinners, receptions, and speaking engagements. Among many public receptions and garden parties held annually, the lieutenant governor&#x27;s New Years Day levée remains a popular and well-attended highlight of the holiday season in Victoria. It is also at the vice-regal residence that the lieutenant governor drops the writs of election, swears-in new members of the Executive Council, and hold audience with the premier.

The property is owned by the King in Right of British Columbia; as with other Crown property, Government House is held in trust for future rulers and cannot be sold by the monarch except by his lieutenant governor with the proper advice and consent from the Executive Council of British Columbia. The management of the residence is, however, overseen by the British Columbia Government House Foundation, a charitable, non-profit organisation that was in 1987 established by Lieutenant Governor Robert Gordon Rogers, along with his Council at the time. The foundation is mandated to oversee the maintenance of Government House&#x27;s property and all the structures on it; the acquisition, either on loan or permanently, of British Columbia artworks for display in the royal residence; the management of official gifts to the lieutenant governor or monarch in right of British Columbia; and public awareness of Government House, its history, and value. Besides the four honorary trustees—the lieutenant governor, the viceregal consort, the Chief Justice of British Columbia, and the Private Secretary to the Lieutenant Governor—the foundation also has trustees elected for three-year terms from artistic, horticultural, historical, and legal segments of provincial society.

==Architecture and interiors==

The present Government House is a T-shaped, four level (including the basement) building of steel frame construction clad in a Modern Tudor revival envelope. The walls are of rusticated blue, grey, and pink British Columbia granite with Haddington Island stone trim, and the roof, which is two storeys high in itself, has steeply pitched, chalet-style gables and numerous dormer windows. A rendition of the Royal Arms of British Columbia is visible in the gable above the Ballroom&#x27;s south facing bow window, which commands a view over Ross Bay and the lower part of the Fairfield neighbourhood, across the Strait of Juan de Fuca, to the Olympic Mountains in Washington state.

The main entrance is in the centre of the north facade, beneath the original Tudor Revival porte cochère of the previous Government House, which had been inspired by Rattenbury&#x27;s own Hatley Castle. Behind this is the main entrance hall, the walls lined with oak panelling hung with painted portraits of former Lieutenant Governors of British Columbia, some of the chatelaines of Government House (the viceroy&#x27;s wife), and large portraits of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Rising to the second floor is a large staircase along which are renderings of the escutcheons of various members of the Royal Family and Governors General of Canada who have resided at Government House. The room is capped by a cathedral ceiling and the three storey high north wall is dominated by the Rogers Window, a stained glass creation commissioned by viceregal consort Jane Rogers to commemorate British Columbia&#x27;s heritage as a parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy, the contribution of viceroys and their spouses since the foundation of the Colony of Vancouver Island, and the place of Government House in provincial life. The window, unveiled on 2 May 1990, shows various heraldic devices of the monarch in right of the province and the monarch in right of Canada, natural emblems of British Columbia, and historical artefacts alluding to provincial industry and native heritage.

On axis with the front entrance is the largest room in Government House, the ballroom, which occupies the entire south wing of the building. It rises past an encircling balcony to a cathedral ceiling, from which hangs three Swiss cut crystal chandeliers that match the multiple wall sconces. Artwork includes the series of Millennium Windows, completed in 2006, that run along each side of the ballroom, and, reflecting the view from the room&#x27;s south window, is a textile piece entitled &quot;Reflections at Government House&quot;, by Carol Sabiston. Also for entertaining purposes are the main dining room, modelled after the original Rattenbury and Maclure design with its fir panelling and containing a dining suite purchased in Scotland, and the drawing room, which also evokes the previous incarnation of the room. Available for smaller events are the little drawing room, sometimes called the French Drawing Room because of its furnishings of French origin, including a Sèvres clock and vases, and two rooms named for the architects of the second Government House: the Maclure room, done in an Arts and Crafts style with handcrafted furniture and a copper foil ceiling, and the Rattenbury room, used as a smaller dining room on the mansion&#x27;s second floor and containing a table and chairs from the eponymous architect&#x27;s personal collection, on loan from the Royal British Columbia Museum. The mansion also holds numerous art pieces in the Crown collection, including works by British Columbia First Nations artists especially commissioned by the lieutenant governor.

==Grounds==
Government House&#x27;s property is a publicly accessible area tended by volunteers in the Friends of Government House Gardens Society, and are used frequently by the surrounding community, save for when security otherwise necessitates. The site is divided into numerous different zones according to plant life and/or garden style; for instance, the British Columbia native plant garden contains species unique to the province, and the Cottage Garden is arranged in an informal style with a mixture of ornamental and edible plants. There are also gardens to supply cut flowers, herbs, and an orchard with apple, plum, and quince trees; a rock garden tended by the Heather Society of Victoria; iris, lily, rhododendron, and rose gardens (including a formal Victorian rose garden based on the plan of that at Warwick Castle in England); and water features such as the fountain pond and the duck pond. There is also a unique Garry Oak ecosystem.

<doc id="1022952" wikidata="Q3381002" url="?curid=1022952" title="Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil">
<text>Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil (; c. 1643 – 10 October 1725) was a French military officer who served as Governor General of New France (now Canada and U.S. states of the Mississippi Valley) from 1703 to 1725, throughout Queen Anne&#x27;s War and Father Rale&#x27;s War.

==Life and career==
He was born at the Castle of Vaudreuil near Castelnaudary in France. He was the second son of Jean-Louis de Rigaud (d. 1659), Baron de Vaudreuil, Seigneur d&#x27;Auriac and de Cabanial, by his wife Marie de Château-Verdun. She was the daughter of François, Seigneur de la Razairie. As Chevalier de Vaudreuil, he was sent to command French forces in New France before being appointed Governor of Montreal in 1699, and then Governor General of New France in 1703. He died at Quebec City.

He married Louise Élisabeth de Joybert, a daughter of Pierre de Joybert de Soulanges et de Marson, by his wife Marie-Françoise, daughter of Louis-Théandre Chartier de Lotbinière. They lived at Château Vaudreuil, which was built in 1723 by Chaussegros de Léry, but was eventually destroyed by a fire in 1803. In 1723, he was recorded as owning an enslaved Meskwaki woman, Marguerite-Genevieve. Their son, Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, served as the last Governor General of New France before the British Conquest of New France from 1755 to 1760 during the French and Indian War. Several of his other sons went on to distinguished careers in the French army and navy. His grandson Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil defeated a British naval force at the Battle of the Chesapeake 1781 on the &quot;Sceptre&quot;, and was protecting George Washington&#x27;s army in 1782 in Boston aboard the &quot;Triomphant&quot;. His grandson also brought back the victorious French army of Rochambeau, back to France after the Siege of Yorktown.

Rigaud de Vaudreuil was one of three governors-general of Canada known to have owned enslaved people. During his tenure, he owned 11 people, seven of whom were from First Nations and four from Africa.

==Legacy==

Château Vaudreuil was constructed in 1723 as his private residence in Montreal. A Squadron of cadets at the Royal Military College Saint-Jean was named in his honour.
Vaudreuil is mentioned in a Fort Saint-Jean plaque erected in 1926 by Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada at the Royal Military College Saint-Jean. &quot;Constructed in 1743 by M. de Léry under orders from Governor la Galissonnière. This post was for all the military expeditions towards Lake Champlain. In 31 August 1760, Commandant de Roquemaure had it blown up in accordance with orders from the Governor de Vaudreuil in order to prevent its falling into the hands of the English. Rebuilt by Governor Carleton, in 1773. During the same year, under the command of Major Charles Preston of the 26th Regiment, it withstood a 45-day siege by the American troops commanded by General Montgomery.&quot;

<text>The Egypt national football team (), nicknamed &quot;Pharaohs&quot; (), represents Egypt in men&#x27;s international football, and is governed by the Egyptian Football Association (EFA), the governing body of football in Egypt.

Egypt is Africa&#x27;s oldest national football team and has won the African Cup a record seven times. Egypt has made three appearances in the World Cup and was the first-ever African and Middle Eastern team to make such an appearance. Their former goalkeeper Essam El Hadary also holds the record for the oldest player to have played at a World Cup. 

Internationally, Egypt became a bronze medalist at the 2001 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Argentina.

== History ==
The first Egyptian national football team was constituted in 1920, the first African football team created to compete in the Summer Olympics in Belgium.

The opening match of their campaign was a loss against the Italians. Between 1958 and 1961, the country had a political union with Syria and went under the name of United Arab Republic, though the Egyptian team&#x27;s records are attributed to Egypt only by FIFA as it was represented by Egyptian footballers and the team played in the Africa Cup of Nations. The Pharaohs have appeared in three FIFA World Cups and they are the most successful team in the Africa Cup of Nations, winning the competition seven times, with the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations being the most recent one.

=== Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations ===

Egypt first participated in the first Africa Cup of Nations tournament in 1957. In their first game, a semi-final, they faced Sudan, winning 2–1; Egypt won 4–0 in the final.

In their second participation in the Africa Cup of Nations in 1959, Egypt became champions again. There were only three teams in that tournament, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt, who were undefeated. They lost their first final in the Africa Cup of Nations in 1962.

Their fourth appearance came in 1963 in Ghana. Egypt was placed in Group B with Sudan and Nigeria, defeating Nigeria 6–3, but drawing 2–2 against Sudan. Despite being undefeated in the group stage, they were ranked second, behind Sudan by goal difference. Egypt, as runners-up in Group B, participated in the 3rd place match, playing against Ethiopia, winning 3–0. For the 1965 Africa Cup of Nations, Egypt qualified for the tournament, but withdrew because of their diplomatic relationship with hosts Tunisia. They also withdrew in 1968.

In the 1970 Africa Cup of Nations, hosted again in Sudan, Egypt were in Group B along with Ghana, Guinea, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, known as Congo-Kinshasa back then. In their opening match, Egypt defeated Guinea by a score of 4–1 and drew Ghana 1–1, defeating Congo-Kinshasa 1–0. Egypt ended being in first place, thus advancing to the next round, where they faced Sudan. Egypt eventually lost their first game in the Africa Cup of Nations by a scored of 2–1, then in the third place match, won against Ivory Coast 3–1.

Egypt failed to qualify for the first time in 1972 after being eliminated by Morocco by an aggregate score of 5–3. However, Egypt returned for 1974, hosting the event. They finished third place. Two years later, in Ethiopia, they were in Group A with the hosts, Guinea, and Uganda. Egypt defeated Uganda 2–1, but drew against Uganda and Ethiopia. Egypt advanced to the final round, and lost all matches. This is the first Africa Cup of Nations tournament that Egypt lost 3 consecutive games. Egypt then failed to qualify for 1978.

Egypt reappeared for the 1980 African Cup of Nations, defeating Ivory Coast and defeated Tanzania, but lost to hosts Nigeria 1–0. Egypt progressed to the semi-finals to face Algeria, who defeated the Egyptians on penalties. For the Four years later, Egypt defeated Cameroon and Ivory Coast, and drew Togo, eventually finishing fourth behind Algeria.

For 1986, Egypt hosted; they lost to Senegal 1–0. However, Egypt went on to win their two remaining games in the group stage, 2–0 against the Ivory Coast and Mozambique. Egypt advanced to the final for the first time since 1962, eventually winning. Egypt qualified for 1990, losing all group stage matches, thus making Egypt fail to obtain at least one point for the first time in the Africa Cup of Nations. They repeated this in 1992.

In the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations in Tunisia, Egypt defeated Gabon 4–0 and tied Nigeria 0–0. They lost to Mali 1–0 in the quarterfinals. Egypt won their fourth title in 1998, defeating South Africa in the final.

Egypt qualified for the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations, in Tunisia. Egypt were placed in Group C with Algeria, Zimbabwe, and Cameroon. Egypt won 2–1 against Zimbabwe, lost 2–1 to Algeria, and drew 0–0 against Cameroon, failing to qualify for the quarter-finals due to Algeria scoring more goals than Egypt in the group stage, after being equal on points and goal difference.
The 2006 Africa Cup of Nations was hosted in Egypt; the hosts were in Group A with Libya, Morocco, and the Ivory Coast. Egypt defeated Libya 3–0, tied 0–0 against Morocco, and won 3–1 against the Ivory Coast. Egypt would eventually win the tournament on penalties, and would also win the 2008 and 2010 tournaments.
They would then fail to qualify for the next three AFCON tournaments.

Egypt qualified for the 2017 tournament, drawing against Mali in their first match in Group D. Successive 1–0 wins against Uganda and Ghana saw the Pharaohs qualify to the quarter-finals as group winners. Egypt faced Morocco at the quarter-final stage, and defeated them for the first time in 31 years to set up a semi-final clash with Burkina Faso. Mohamed Salah&#x27;s goal against the Stallions was canceled out by an Aristide Bancé strike; however, veteran goalkeeper Essam El Hadary saved two spot-kicks in the penalty shootout to earn a spot in the final for Egypt. Egypt then faced Cameroon, and lost the final for the second time.

In the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, hosts Egypt were knocked out by South Africa in the round of 16, despite three wins in the group stage. In the 2021 Africa Cup, Egypt went to the final despite dire performances in the group stage and beating Ivory Coast on penalties after a 0–0 draw. Egypt then beat Cameroon 3–1 in penalties after a 0–0 draw, to reach their 10th final, beating Ghana&#x27;s record of final appearances. Egypt suffered their first of two losses to Senegal in 2022, both on penalties (in the AFCON final and in World Cup qualifying), both winning penalties scored by Sadio Mané.

=== Egypt at the FIFA World Cup ===


Egypt has qualified for the FIFA World Cup three times: in 1934, in 1990 and for the 2018 editions. Egypt was the first African country to qualify for the World Cup, beating Mandatory Palestine. They lost to Hungary 4–2 in their first and only match in 1934, the two goals scored by Egypt&#x27;s forward Abdulrahman Fawzi.

In the next qualifications for the 1938 World Cup, Egypt withdrew. They didn’t enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup qualification. In the 1954 FIFA World Cup qualification, they faced Italy but didn’t qualify. They withdrew the 1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970 World Cup Qualifiers. Since 1974 World Cup Qualification, Egypt entered the qualifiers on regular basis but did not qualify.

In 1990, Egypt qualified after beating Algeria 1–0 in the playoffs. They were drawn in Group F, with Ireland, England and the Netherlands. Since the Egyptians favored defensive tactics, they scored only one goal in the 1990 World Cup. A 1–1 draw with UEFA Euro 1988 champions Netherlands gave the Egyptians their first point in the World Cup. This was followed by a draw against Ireland and a 0–1 loss to England.
On 8 October 2017, Egypt qualified for the 2018 World Cup after topping Group E over Uganda, Ghana and Congo.

In the 2018 World Cup, Egypt was drawn with Saudi Arabia, Uruguay and the hosts, Russia. They started their first game against Uruguay, without Salah, who was injured in the UEFA Champions League final. Egypt lost 1–0, and goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy was voted man of the match. He refused the reward due to sponsorship by Budweiser.

Salah returned to the starting lineup when Egypt faced Russia. Russia led 3–0, and then Salah scored Egypt&#x27;s first World Cup goal in 28 years. Egypt&#x27;s third and final match was a Red Sea Derby against Saudi Arabia, also out of contention after two losses. Essam El Hadary became the oldest player in the World Cup at 45 years and 161 days.

Héctor Cúper, who was criticised due to his defensive strategies against Saudi Arabia, was sacked. The Egyptian Football Association was also criticised due to having its base in Chechnya, far from where Egypt&#x27;s matches were played. The Egyptian media and the public heavily criticized EFA&#x27;s management of the team.
== Home stadium ==
Egypt&#x27;s home games in the early years were played at Cairo International Stadium since 1960. During renovations they play at Borg El Arab Stadium.

<text>Ty (styled ty) is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. It was founded by Ty Warner in 1986. It designs, develops and sells products, most notably Beanie Babies, exclusively to specialty markets worldwide.

==Internet==
===First &quot;business-to-consumer&quot; website===
Lina Trivedi was a college student when she worked at Ty Inc. She approached Warner to talk about a new development that existed on college campuses called the Internet. She indicated that, while the Internet was primarily a research tool, college students were starting to make personal websites. She thought that creating a website for Beanie Babies could present an unprecedented opportunity to engage the market. She brought to Ty&#x27;s office a 14.4k modem and demonstrated how the Internet works. Warner was intrigued and gave Trivedi a free license to create a website using her judgment and skills. By the time the first iteration of the Ty website&lt;ref name=&quot;archive/1996-12-18/ty.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was published in late 1995, only 1.4% of Americans were using the Internet. The population of people using the Internet grew exponentially in the following years, along with the popularity of Beanie Babies.

Ty was the first business to produce a direct-to-consumer website. This was a major contributing factor to the early and rapidly growing popularity of Beanie Babies. All Beanie Baby hangtags had the website URL and a call to action printed underneath the poems and birthdays that commanded audiences to visit the company website with text that read &quot;Visit our web page!!!&quot; This effort evolved into the world&#x27;s first Internet sensation.

==Fundraising==
Ty has been involved in a large amount of fundraising, with the proceeds donated to various causes. Some of this has been raised from the sale of certain Beanie Babies. It has also been raised through other means, such as voting for a fee.

One such fundraising Beanie Baby was Ariel, made to raise funds for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Its sales raised a total of $3.4 million for the foundation. Others include Aware and Awareness, sold to raise funds for breast cancer research and awareness; and Barbaro, created in memory of Barbaro the Horse, to raise funds for the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, which tried to save the horse.

Ty has also raised money for the 2004 PGA Tour with a beanie called ChariTee; one, signed by Jack Nicklaus, was auctioned for $455.

Ty was the shirt sponsor of Portsmouth FC from 2002 to 2005, in which the club was promoted to the Premier League.

A Beanie Baby named &quot;Cito&quot; was given out to school children in Montecito, California, to welcome them back to school after the area was affected by the 2018 Southern California mudflows.

==In popular culture==
During the wake of Beanie Babies&#x27; success, Beanie Baby-centric publications were issued. One of the largest was &quot;Mary Beth&#x27;s Bean Bag World&quot;, a monthly magazine dedicated to Beanie Babies and competing plush toys. It ran from 1997 to 2001.

In August 2021, Beanie Babies was the season 1, episode 4 feature on Vice Media&#x27;s &quot;Dark Side of the 90s&quot; entitled &quot;Beanie Babies Go Bust&quot;.

A documentary film about Beanie Babies, titled &quot;Beanie Mania&quot;, was released on December 23, 2021, on HBO Max.

The story of Ty has also been covered by two films, both named &quot;The Beanie Bubble&quot;, one a 2022 documentary directed by Ben Kitnick and a 2023 comedy-drama directed by Kristin Gore and Damian Kulash and written by Gore, based on the 2015 book &quot;The Great Beanie Baby Bubble: Mass Delusion and the Dark Side of Cute&quot; by Zac Bissonnette about the Beanie Babies bubble. It stars Zach Galifianakis, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Snook and Geraldine Viswanathan.

<doc id="1022968" wikidata="Q7407016" url="?curid=1022968" title="Sam's Point Preserve">
<text>Sam&#x27;s Point Preserve, or Sam&#x27;s Point Dwarf Pine Ridge Preserve, is a preserve in Ulster County on the highest point () of the Shawangunk Ridge in New York, on the Wawarsing, New York-Shawangunk town line. It is owned and managed by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation after having previously been managed by The Nature Conservancy. Its unique environment features dwarf pitch pine trees along the ridgetop. Located within the park is Lake Maratanza, the highest lake on the ridge, and the Ellenville Fault Ice Caves.

==History==
The name derives from a folktale in which a noted Spanish settler named Samuel Gonzales, pursued by Indians, jumped off the cliff to avoid capture and miraculously survived the drop with the trees breaking his fall, around the time of the French and Indian War. Roads throughout the preserve were built as fire roads in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps.

The land was once owned by the nearby village of Ellenville to protect its watershed and partly by a company which offered tours of the ice caves. The Open Space Institute, working with The Nature Conservancy bought it with assistance from the Lila Acheson and Dewitt Wallace Fund for the Hudson Highlands, after the village considered selling the land to developers.

In 2005, the Preserve opened the Sam’s Point Conservation Center with education facilities, exhibits and a gift shop. A parking fee of $10 per vehicle is charged.

Management of the preserve was transferred to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and the Palisades Interstate Park Commission in April 2015, after having been managed by The Nature Conservancy since 1996. The preserve is currently managed as part of Minnewaska State Park Preserve.

===April 2016 fire===

In late April 2016, a fire of unknown origin burned of the park and nearby woodlands. Emanating from the Verkeederkill Falls trail the fire quickly spread northwest across the plateau as well as adjacent terrains. Containing the fire required nearly a week of effort from over 300 responders from local and state agencies; no structural damage and only minor injuries were reported. Although much of Minnewaska State Park reopened soon after the blaze, the Sam&#x27;s Point section remained completely closed until Memorial Day weekend; at that time, only selected trails at Sam&#x27;s Point were re-opened to the public to prevent the introduction of invasive species to the recovering landscape.

As a historically fire-adapted ecosystem, much of the vegetation at Sam&#x27;s Point responded positively in the wake of the fire. However, an abundance of fuel due to reduced fire frequency in recent years led to an intense, fast-moving blaze that did not completely burn through accumulated debris, which may inhibit the regeneration of the park&#x27;s pitch pine.

==Ellenville Fault Ice Caves==
The Ellenville Fault Ice Caves is the largest known open fault in the United States with corresponding ice caves. As a result of the cool microclimate, ice is present throughout the year and more northern plants such as black spruce, hemlock, mountain ash, and creeping snowberry, and bryophytes such as &quot;Isopterygium distichaceum&quot; are able to survive. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in November 1967.

There are hiking trails to the ice caves which are open in the summer, but a permit is required to visit the area.

==Trails==
The Long Path long-distance hiking trail crosses it, eventually reaching VerKeerderkill Falls. A branch leads to Sam&#x27;s Point (with a view of land for many miles, sometimes as far as High Point in New Jersey), and another to the ice caves, with solar powered lights. Visitors who want to get to Sam&#x27;s Point have to go through Cragsmoor.

<text>The Communist Party of Spain (8th and 9th Congresses) (in Spanish: &quot;Partido Comunista de España (VIII y IX Congresos)&quot;) was a pro-Soviet splinter group of Communist Party of Spain (PCE). 

PCE (VIII-IX) was one of many groups that broke away from PCE during the period when Santiago Carrillo held the post of PCE general secretary and directed the party towards Eurocommunism; it was founded in 1971. A prominent leader of the new party was Agustín Gómez. It published a magazine called &quot;Mundo Obrero&quot; (same name as the publication of PCE).

In 1980 PCE (VIII-IX) fused with Workers&#x27; Communist Party to form the Unified Communist Party of Spain. PCEU was later instrumental in creating the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain in 1982.

<text>Kazimierz Jerzy Skrzypna-Twardowski (; 20 October 1866 – 11 February 1938) was a Polish philosopher, psychologist, logician, and rector of the Lwów University. He was initially affiliated with Alexius Meinong&#x27;s Graz School of object theory.

==Academic career==
Twardowski&#x27;s family belonged to the Ogończyk coat of arms.

Twardowski studied philosophy at the University of Vienna with Franz Brentano and Robert von Zimmermann. In 1891 he received his doctorate with his dissertation, &quot;Idee und Perzeption&quot; (&quot;Idea and Perception&quot;).

In 1894 Twardowski published a book, entitled &quot;Zur Lehre vom Inhalt und Gegenstand der Vorstellungen, Eine psychologische Untersuchung&quot; (&quot;On the Doctrine of the Content and Object of Presentations&quot;). The book was written between 1891 and 1893, although excerpts of the book were republished under the title &quot;On the Content and Object of Representations&quot;, which is an early text on semiotics.

Twardowski originated many novel ideas related to metaphilosophy.

He lectured at the University of Vienna in the years 1894 and 1895.

In 1895 was appointed professor at Lwów (Lemberg in Austrian Galicia, now Lviv in Ukraine). An outstanding lecturer, he was also a rector of the Lwów University during World War I. There Twardowski soon established the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic and became the &quot;father of Polish logic&quot;. Among his students were the logicians Stanisław Leśniewski, Jan Łukasiewicz and Tadeusz Czeżowski, the psychologist Władysław Witwicki, the historian of philosophy Władysław Tatarkiewicz, the phenomenologist and aesthetician Roman Ingarden, as well as philosophers close to the Vienna Circle such as Tadeusz Kotarbiński and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.

Twardowski also established the Polish Philosophical Society in 1904, the first laboratory of experimental psychology in Poland in 1907, and the journal &quot;Ruch Filozoficzny&quot; in 1911.

He officially retired in 1930.

==Work==
In his 1894 book &quot;On the Content and Object of Presentations&quot; (also known as &quot;On the Doctrine of the Content and Object of Presentations&quot;), Twardowski argues for a distinction between content and object in the frame of the theory of intentionality of his teacher Franz Brentano. According to him the mind is divided in two main areas: &quot;acts&quot; or &quot;mental phenomena&quot;, and a &quot;physical phenomenon&quot;. For example, an act of mental representation is aimed at a presentation. This is what he called ‘intentionality’, aboutness. Every act is about something, but also every presentation goes together with an act of presentation.

This theory suffers from the problem that it is not clear what the presentation exactly is. Is the presentation something only in the mind, or is it also in the world as object? Twardowski says that sometimes presentation is used for the object in the world and sometimes for the immanent content of a mental phenomenon.

Twardowski offers a solution for this problem and proposes to make a distinction between the content of a presentation and the object of a presentation.

In his book Twardowski offers an analogy to clarify this distinction. He uses the example of a painting. People say of a landscape that it is painted, but also of a painting that it is painted. In the first case the word ‘painting’ is used in a modifying way (a painted landscape is not a landscape at all), while in the latter case the word painting is used in a qualitative or attributive way. Twardowski argues that presentations are similar. The content is the painted painting and the object is the painted landscape. The content resembles the present ‘picture’ in one&#x27;s mind, and the object the landscape.

<text>Government House of Manitoba () is the official residence of the lieutenant governor of Manitoba, and is located in the provincial capital of Winnipeg. It stands in the provincial capital, on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building, at 10 Kennedy Street; unlike other provincial Government Houses in Canada, this gives Manitoba&#x27;s vice-regal residence a prominent urban setting, though it is surrounded by gardens.

==History==
Prior to the foundation of Manitoba, the Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories occupied a designated residence within the walls of Upper Fort Garry; a house that was, at one point, used by Louis Riel as president of the provisional government of Red River. After the new province joined Confederation on 15 July 1870, a structure five kilometres outside of Winnipeg was leased for use as the lieutenant governor&#x27;s residence, known as Silver Heights, but it was found unsuitable, given its size and distance from the capital. Instead, the lieutenant governor remained at Upper Fort Garry until the present Government House was completed.
The house there, however, was in constant need of repair; after $10,000 was spent on the structure in 1873, Alexander Morris wrote to the federal Minister of Public Works: &quot;You can fancy the state of the house when I tell you there was five feet of water in the cellar till middle of July. Year before till middle of August...&quot; Further, as the population of the province was increasing, the need for public buildings became more pressing, and a delegation travelled to Ottawa to discuss with the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada the matter of parliament allocating funds for a new legislative assembly and Government House for Manitoba. This was approved, and Thomas Seaton Scott, the Dominion architect, immediately set about drawing up plans for the structures.

The current provincial vice-regal residence was constructed in 1883, at a cost to the federal Crown of $23,995. However, the building was two years later, on 10 June, purchased by the provincial Crown for $1, with the provision that the house be used as a residence for the viceroy &quot;and for no other purpose,&quot; as written by John A. Macdonald at the bottom of the Order in Council transferring the house. In 1901, the vicd-regal home played host to the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George V and Queen Mary), as well as the Duchess&#x27; brother, Prince Alexander of Teck (who would later become Governor General of Canada); Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), and Prince George, Duke of Kent, in 1919 and 1941; and King George VI was the first reigning monarch to reside at Government House when he and his wife, Queen Elizabeth, stopped in Winnipeg during their cross-country tour of Canada in 1939; from Government House, the King broadcast over the radio a speech to the British Commonwealth, the table at which he sat still in the residence. Their daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and each of their children have also stayed at Government House over the years.

The architect Frank Worthington Simon included in his plans for the Manitoba Legislative Building a new Government House, to be constructed on the bank of the Assiniboine River, opposite the parliament. This plan never came to fruition, however, and the Victorian Government House was adapted over time to suit the lieutenant governor&#x27;s changing needs. In 1978, the mansion was designated as a historical structure by the Manitoba Heritage Council and in 1999, at the initiative of Shirley Liba, wife of Lieutenant Governor Peter Liba, the house underwent a major renovation, in which many of the original features of the mansion were uncovered and restored.

==Use==
Government House is where visiting dignitaries are greeted and often stay while in Winnipeg. It is also where numerous vice-regal events take place, such as the bestowing of provincial awards or inductions into the Order of Manitoba, as well as luncheons, dinners, receptions, and speaking engagements. It is also at the vice-regal residence that the lieutenant governor drops the writs of election and swears-in new members of the Executive Council. The viceroy&#x27;s office is located at the Legislative Building, behind Government House; it is there that legislation is given Royal Assent and the lieutenant governor meets with the premier.

==Architecture and interiors==
Manitoba&#x27;s Government house is a structure of solid masonry walls and timber floor framing, the original block being square and four storeys in height, counting the basement level, covering a total of approximately , including the tower. The volume and its facade composition was at first symmetrical along an east-west axis through the centre of the building, though this arrangement was later altered by the addition of new wings; this is clad in brick, trimmed with cut stone and ornate wood cornices at the roof line, and iron cresting tops the tower. The overall design was described in 1883 as &quot;Italian, modified to suit the requirements of the climate,&quot; though the same year an early visitor noted in the guest book: &quot;It is an unpretending looking structure, of nondescript architecture and with no outside ornamentation.&quot; Similarly, in 1953, the provincial architect said that Government House was the one &quot;jarring note&quot; on the grounds of the Legislative Building. By later in the 20th century, however, provincial architects stated the house is &quot;Victorian architecture with French influence from the Second Napoleonic Empire with the flat steep-sided Mansard roof&quot;.

When first built, the ground floor of Government House held a suite of interconnected rooms that, opened to one another, formed a suite long and wide. Altogether, these included, in a counter-clockwise array around the central stair hall, the library, immediately to the right of the foyer, the breakfast room, the drawing room, the dining room, a serving room, and the viceroy&#x27;s office at the left of the foyer. Later, in 1901, a veranda was built around the north-east corner of the house, and a ballroom was added to the rear, both at the personal expense of Lieutenant Governor Daniel Hunter McMillan. Then, in 1908, the front porch was enclosed in a robust structure and a palm room and adjoining conservatory were added off the dining room. Until 1946, the kitchens were in the basement and serving took place via a dumbwaiter; that year a new kitchen was built into another extension off the rear of the mansion. Eventually what had been the palm room was made into an extension of the dining room and, in 1953, the original serving room was sacrificed in favour of a cloak room and powder room, as well as an elevator in place of the dumbwaiter. The ballroom was demolished in 1960 to make way for the current assembly room, which was, for catering purposes, linked to the kitchen by a new serving room, and three years following, the conservatory was pulled down and replaced with a new sun room, potting room, and greenhouse, as well as a three car garage. Today, the lieutenant governor&#x27;s office has been moved to the Legislative Building and the room it once occupied made into a sitting room for the viceroy&#x27;s aides-de-camp. The former library, breakfast room, and drawing room have all been turned into a series of connected salons for official entertaining.

Reached by a staircase of oak treads, newels, balusters, and handrail with pine risers, the second floor consisted in 1880 of six bedrooms, two dressing rooms, a bath room, a toilet, and a storage closet. Two of the bedrooms were connected by large sliding doors, as with the library and breakfast room beneath; during large parties, these doors would be pulled back and the combined bedrooms would be used for expanded entertainment space. Over time, the spaces on this level were altered and some of the bedrooms were divided into private en suite bathrooms. The royal bedroom is reserved for use by the sovereign and other Royal Family members when they are in Winnipeg, and the gold room accommodates royal support staff or other royals if the monarch is occupying the royal bedroom. Also on this floor is the viceregal suite, consisting of a master bedroom, the lieutenant governor&#x27;s private office, and a library and living room.

The basement of Government House is divided into several sections; originally it held living quarters for the domestic staff—a kitchen and bedrooms—as well as the main kitchen for the state dining room on the ground floor. Currently, it contains storage and laundry facilities. The attic floor was divided into nine bedrooms, which has been reduced to four bedrooms with the addition of two bathrooms, a sitting room, and a three and one-half room suite for the resident housekeeper. From this floor one can also access the tower, from which the lieutenant governor&#x27;s standard is flown when he or she is in residence.

==Grounds==
Manitoba&#x27;s Government House is surrounded on three sides by manicured gardens; the fourth side—the rear of the building—faces directly onto the parking lot of the Legislative Building. In 2010, part of the grounds were set aside and dedicated as the &quot;Queen Elizabeth II Gardens&quot; by the Queen herself on 3 July that year, the event marked by the planting of an Amber Jubilee Ninebark shrub, the species having been created specifically for Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 2012. At the same time, a statue of the Queen that had been created in 1970 by Leo Mol and installed outside the Manitoba Centennial Centre was moved to the eponymous gardens and unveiled by her. The statue was toppled over on 1 July 2021 in a protest against Canada Day.

<doc id="1022997" wikidata="Q2307928" url="?curid=1022997" title="Good Mourning (album)">
<text>Good Mourning is the fourth studio album by American punk rock band Alkaline Trio, released May 13, 2003 on Vagrant Records.

==Background and production==
Towards the end of May 2002, the band recorded their next album; they &quot;decided that waiting until after Warped Tour would be too long.&quot; Recording sessions were held at Cello Studios with producers Joe McGrath and Jerry Finn. The album marks the first appearance of drummer Derek Grant, described by vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba as &quot;a whole new influence.&quot; During recording, both Skiba and vocalist/bassist Dan Andriano were ill. Alkaline Trio had planned a tour with One Man Army in early 2003, but the tour was cancelled due to Skiba having strained vocal chords; the album&#x27;s recording was subsequently delayed. Brian Gardner mastered the recordings at Bern Grundman Mastering. Skiba describes the album as sounding &quot;bigger, deeper and rawer&quot; than its predecessor, &quot;From Here to Infirmary&quot;.

In a 2003 interview, Matt Skiba gave his thoughts on the album:

[&quot;Good Mourning&quot;] is pretty good. I mean it took us a long time to do and I think most of the people that I talk to that make records and stuff, there&#x27;s always stuff that you wish you did better or maybe a little differently. I&#x27;ve never been able to avoid that, even with this. There&#x27;s things that I wish I had done maybe a little differently. But that also comes with just listening to it and living with it for so long that until it&#x27;s done you won&#x27;t really hear things in that way until it&#x27;s like too late I guess. But I would say for the most part that I&#x27;m really happy with it.

==Composition==
&quot;Good Mourning&quot; has been described as a punk rock, pop-punk, and hardcore punk record, with a focus on aggression.
Discussing the title, Skiba said he was having breakfast near the studio, and his waiter said good morning&#x27; to me and it&#x27;s just kinda like the double meaning/spelling kinda registered and I just called everyone and I was like, &#x27;How about &quot;Good Mourning&quot; with a &quot;U&quot;?&#x27; and everybody liked it equally as much so we used it.&quot; He said the Ramones and the Damned served as big influences on the album. &quot;We&#x27;ve Had Enough&quot; features backing vocals from Keith Morris of Circle Jerks.

==Release==
On January 23, 2003, the album&#x27;s title was revealed as &quot;Good Mourning&quot;. On February 11, &quot;Good Mourning&quot; was announced for release in three months&#x27; time; alongside this, the album&#x27;s track listing was posted online. On March 18, the album&#x27;s artwork was revealed. Between April and June 2003, the band toured across the US and Canada, with One Man Army, Pretty Girls Make Graves, and Avoid One Thing. &quot;Good Mourning&quot; was made available for streaming on May 1, 2003, before being released through Vagrant Records on May 13. The UK version of the album included two bonus tracks: &quot;Dead End Road&quot; and &quot;Old School Reasons&quot;. Also on May 13, the band appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;ve Had Enough&quot; was released to radio on May 20; the song&#x27;s music video was posted on MTV&#x27;s website nine days later. In August and September, the band toured Europe as part of the Reconstruction Festival, and appeared at the Terremoto Festival. Following this, the band went on a tour of the UK with Hot Water Music. Between October and December, the band went on the Vagrant Tour 2003, which featured several acts on the label. The stint included appearances on &quot;IMX&quot; and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. In February 2004, the band went on an Australian tour with Thrice and Hot Water Music. In March and April, the band toured the West Coast as part of the Punkvoter.

==Reception==

The album debuted at number 20 on the Billboard 200, selling 40,000 copies on its first week of release. By August 2008, the album had sold 258,000 copies. Reception from critics was mixed to positive. Within the band, the retrospective reception of &quot;Good Mourning&quot; varies. When asked to rank Alkaline Trio&#x27;s first eight studio albums, Dan Andriano put &quot;Good Mourning&quot; in the top spot whereas Matt Skiba ranked it second to last in place 7. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;We&#x27;ve Had Enough&quot; at number 100 on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s.

<text>View-Master is the trademark name of a line of special-format stereoscopes and corresponding View-Master &quot;reels&quot;, which are thin cardboard disks containing seven Stereoscopic 3-D pairs of small transparent color photographs on film. It was originally manufactured and sold by Sawyer&#x27;s.

The View-Master system was introduced in 1939, four years after the advent of Kodachrome color film made the use of small, high-quality photographic color images practical. Tourist attraction and travel views predominated in View-Master&#x27;s early lists of reels, most of which were meant to be of interest to users of all ages. Most current View-Master reels are intended for children.

==History==

===1919–1956: early photo services===

Edwin Eugene Mayer worked as a pharmacist at Owl Drug store in downtown Portland, Oregon, after serving in the U.S. Army in World War I. He built up a photo-finishing business there, and bought into Sawyer&#x27;s Photo Finishing Service in 1919 with the help of his father August Mayer, his fiancée Eva McAnulty, and her sister Vi McAnulty.

Edwin described how he started the business in a letter dated April 1, 1954: &quot;Suffice to say that in 1919, what little it was, was purchased with borrowed ($3,500) money from Dad, aided by about $1,600 in insurance money Eva got when her father died and which was left in permanently, and $1,600 borrowed from Vi and repaid, along with Dad&#x27;s notes, within a few years.&quot;

As the business grew, Ed Mayer incorporated in about 1926, taking on partners Harold and Beulth F. Graves, Thomas and Pauline Meyer, and Augusta and Raymond F. Kelly, renaming the business Sawyer Service, Inc. The company relocated to a large two-story building at 181 Ella St., near Morrison Street in Portland, Oregon.

The company was producing photographic postcards and album sets as souvenirs by 1926, when Harold Graves joined Sawyer&#x27;s. Graves handled marketing for the products while Mayer ran the business. Later, photographic greeting cards were added to the Sawyer&#x27;s product line, marketed to major department stores. Sawyer&#x27;s was the nation&#x27;s largest producer of scenic postcards in the 1920s and the future View-Master viewer eventually became an extension of the two-dimensional cards.
The company took the first steps towards developing the View-Master after Edwin Mayer and Graves met with William Gruber, an organ maker of German origin trained by Welte &amp; Sons and an avid photographer living in Portland. Mayer and Gruber had both developed devices for viewing stereo images, but Gruber had made up a stereo imaging rig out of two Kodak Bantam Specials mounted together on a tripod. He designed a machine that mounted the tiny pieces of Kodachrome color transparency film into reels made from heavy paper stock. A special viewer was also designed and produced. He had the idea of updating the old-fashioned stereoscope by using the new Kodachrome 16-mm color film, which had recently become available.

===New business venture===

A View-Master reel holds 14 film transparencies in seven pairs that create the seven stereoscopic images. The components of each pair are viewed simultaneously, one by each eye, thus simulating binocular depth perception.

According to a 1960 court document, the Gruber-Sawyer partner venture began from that first meeting in 1938. Thereafter, Ed Mayer negotiated with Gruber while production methods and some marketing were developed. A formal agreement was signed in February 1942 between Gruber and Sawyer partners, doing business as Sawyer&#x27;s.

Mayer and people within the Sawyer&#x27;s organization were uncertain about what to call the new product, but they eventually settled on the name of View-Master. The View-Master brand name eventually came to be recognized by 65% of the world&#x27;s population, but Gruber disliked the name, believing that it sounded too much like Toast-Master, Mix-Master or some other kitchen appliance.

The View-Master was introduced at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, marked &quot;Patent Applied For&quot;. It was intended as an alternative to the scenic postcard, and was originally sold at photography shops, stationery stores and scenic-attraction gift shops. The main subjects of View-Master reels were Carlsbad Caverns and the Grand Canyon.

The View-Master was marketed through Mayer&#x27;s photo-finishing, postcard and greeting card company Sawyer&#x27;s Service, Inc., known eventually as Sawyer&#x27;s, Inc. The partnership led to the retail sales of View-Master viewers and reels. The patent for the viewing device was issued in 1940, and this original model came to be called the Model A viewer. Within a very short time, the View-Master supplanted the postcard business at Sawyer&#x27;s.

===Expansion===
Mayer gave details of the company&#x27;s expansion in a letter dated April 1, 1954:

In 1939, 20 years after starting the business, we had, by dint of hard work and long hours and frugal living, accumulated a business (Sawyer&#x27;s) worth about $58,000.00 and Western Photo Supply Co. owning the buildings, worth about $30,000.00. The above figures were for the total business and buildings owned by the Kellys, Graves, Mayers and Meyers. In 1946, we had already grown a lot from 1939, and Sawyer&#x27;s made a lease with Western Photo Supply Co., they to build and lease two new buildings to Sawyer&#x27;s, in addition to the two we already had. At this point, Sawyer&#x27;s also decided to change its structure from a partnership to a corporation, for various good reasons, one of which was to permit our children to participate in the stock ownership.

In the 1940s, the United States military recognized the potential for View-Master products for personnel training, purchasing 100,000 viewers and nearly six million reels from 1942 to the end of World War II in 1945.

After the development of the View-Master, Sawyer&#x27;s, Inc. moved into a new building at 735 S.W. 20th Place in downtown Portland. The company also occupied a building next door at 740 S.W. 21st Avenue. In 1951, Mayer and his Sawyer&#x27;s partners built a large plant in Washington County, Oregon. After moving to the new plant, Mayer leased the building on 20th Place to Oregon Television, Inc.

===1950s===
In 1951, Sawyer&#x27;s purchased Tru-Vue, the main competitor of View-Master. The takeover included Tru-Vue&#x27;s licensing rights to Walt Disney Studios properties. Sawyer&#x27;s capitalized on the opportunity and produced numerous reels featuring Disney characters. In 1955, reels of the newly opened Disneyland were produced. 
 Joe Liptak was the artist responsible for most of the Disney and the early Hanna-Barbera reels.

In 1952, Sawyer&#x27;s began its View-Master Personal line, which included the View-Master Personal Stereo Camera for users to make their own View-Master reels. It was successful at first, but the line was discontinued in ten years. This line spawned the Model D viewer, View-Master&#x27;s highest-quality viewer, which was available until the early 1970s, and the Stereomatic 500, View-Master&#x27;s only 3D projector. The other projectors were 2D and used only one of the images.

The Model E was introduced in 1955 with a more modern design, large ivory buttons on the picture-changer levers and a large &quot;V&quot; slot on top for easier reel insertion. It was released in brown and black in the United States, and some other colors elsewhere. It was about four inches high, five inches wide and four inches deep.

The Model F was introduced in 1958. It used C-cell batteries to power an internal lighting source. Industrial designer Chuck Harrison led the team designing the Model F View-Master.


===1962–present: stereoscopic toy===
The View-Master had been originally constructed from Kodak Tenite plastic and then Bakelite, a hard, sturdy, somewhat heavy plastic. In 1962, lighter thermoplasticversions were introduced, beginning with the Model G, a change driven by Sawyer&#x27;s president Bob Brost.

In 1966, Sawyer&#x27;s was acquired by the General Aniline &amp; Film (GAF) Corporation and became a wholly owned subsidiary. Under GAF&#x27;s ownership, View-Master reels began to feature fewer scenic and more child-friendly subjects, such as toys and cartoons. Television series were featured on View-Master reels, such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (sold only in the U.K.), &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;Family Affair&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. Actor Henry Fonda appeared in a series of TV commercials for the GAF View-Master.

From 1970 to around 1997, GAF produced the Talking View-Master, which included audio technology along with the reels. Three major designs were produced, with increasing sophistication. In the early 1970s, GAF introduced the View-Master Rear Screen Projector, a tabletop projector that displayed images from picture wheels.

In 1980, View-Master released the Show Beam Projector, a toy that combined the company&#x27;s stereoscopic images and flashlight technology to produce a portable handheld projector. The Show Beam used small film cartridges that were plugged into the side of the toy. Each cartridge contained 30 full-color 2D images.

In 1981, GAF sold View-Master to a group of investors headed by Arnold Thaler, and the company was reconstituted as the View-Master International Group.

In 1985, View-Master Video was introduced. Through a partnership with Warner Bros. Records, a live-action educational video series was produced by Together Again Productions and titled &quot;Kidsongs&quot;, designed for the educational market.

View-Master International acquired the Ideal Toy Company in 1984 and became known as the View-Master Ideal Group, and the combined company was purchased by Tyco Toys in 1989. Tyco, including the View-Master Ideal Group, merged with Mattel in 1997. View-Master was assigned to Mattel&#x27;s preschool division and is now marketed under the Fisher-Price imprint, with a continued emphasis on children&#x27;s content.

In 1998, during the purchase of the Tyco-owned plant by Mattel, the EPA investigated the View-Master factory supply well for the toxic chemical trichloroethylene (TCE). The plant was closed in 2001.

In December 2008, Mattel ceased production of the scenic reels depicting tourist attractions that were descendants of the first View-Master reels sold in 1939. However, Mattel continued to produce reels featuring animated characters.

===2015–2019: Virtual reality===
In February 2015, Mattel announced a collaboration with Google to produce a new version of the View-Master called the View-Master Virtual Reality Viewer, based on virtual reality using smartphones. The new View-Master is an implementation of the Google Cardboard VR platform and is accompanied by a mobile app built using its SDK. Content is displayed on a smartphone screen; the phone itself is inserted into the back of the unit. Instead of being inserted directly into the View-Master, reels are scanned using an augmented reality interface that enables access to content from the reel, such as 360-degree panoramas, 3D models and minigames.

&quot;Greenbot&quot; considered the View-Master to be the best low-cost Cardboard viewer, citing its build quality and comfort over models actually constructed from cardboard, but noting that the latch mechanism for securing the phone inside was not tight enough, and that there was no headphone-jack access. It was felt that the View-Master VR was &quot;the kind of thing you might grab as a gift for the kids, but if you&#x27;re curious about VR on your phone, chances are you&#x27;ll use it as much as they do.&quot;

In 2016, an updated iteration known as the DLX was released; it features improvements to its compatibility with smaller phones, a more secure latch for the phone compartment, and also adds focal adjustment and a headphone port.

Both editions of the View-Master VR were discontinued in November 2019, and the Experience packs can no longer be installed by new users.

In 2019, Mattel partnered with MGM to announce an upcoming feature film based on the View-Master. The project will be co-piloted by Robbie Brenner of Mattel&#x27;s Films division and MGM&#x27;s Cassidy Lange.

===Cumulative production===
There have been some 25 viewer models, thousands of titles, and 1.5 billion reels produced. The basic design remained intact for reels and internal mechanisms, despite its long history and many changes in models and materials, ensuring that every reel will work in every model.

===Recognition===
In 1999, View-Master was part of the second year of inductees added to the National Toy Hall of Fame.

==Notable uses==
Reels have been produced for Disneyland, many TV shows (such as &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;, &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, and &quot;The Munsters&quot;), blockbuster movies (such as &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;), and the U.S. military (for airplane and ship identification as well as range estimation).

David L. Bassett, an expert on anatomy and dissection, collaborated with Gruber to create a 25-volume atlas of human anatomy using the View-Master system.

View-Master produced custom reels for commercial customers to show 3-D images of products and services to potential clients. For example, in the early 1990s, Canadian restaurant chain East Side Mario&#x27;s used a View-Master reel as their dessert menu.

Among the newest View-Master products are a Discovery Channel View-Master, the new Virtual Viewer, the Discovery Channel View-Master Projector and Telescope, and the View-Master 3-D Pocket Viewer, which feature images of popular performers in concert and backstage.

<text>Simon Herman Van der Ryn (né Van der Rijn; March 12, 1935 – October 19, 2024) was a Dutch-born American architect, researcher and educator. Van der Ryn&#x27;s professional interest was applying principles of physical and social ecology to architecture and environmental design. He promoted sustainable design at the community scale and the building-specific scale. He designed single-family and multi-family housing, community facilities, retreat centers and resorts, learning facilities, as well as office and commercial buildings.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Simon Herman Van der Rijn was born to a Jewish family in Groningen, Netherlands, on March 12, 1935. His family soon fled to the United States, leaving the Netherlands on September 1, 1939, as the Nazi invasion of Poland began. The family first arrived in Queens, New York City, then moved to Great Neck, New York on Long Island, where they changed the spelling of their surname to Van der Ryn.

Van der Ryn pursued education in architecture at the University of Michigan, graduating at the age of 24 with a B.Arch degree, in 1958. During that year he moved to California and joined the UC Berkeley faculty where he taught for 35 years. Later in his career, he was listed as a state architect in California and New Mexico. Sim also, became a licensed architect where he received a certification by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB).

===Professional efforts===

Van der Ryn’s vision and philosophy have been based on the inclusion of ecological values to the built environment. He introduced new academic programs through elementary schools in Berkeley, California. One of the program&#x27;s mottos was “trash can do it.” The idea was that recycling of materials would encourage students to utilize resources; the approach was new at the time. Hands-on methods of gaining understanding allowed students to grasp a real-life perspective concerning different materials by utilizing them in environmentally functional projects. The program created opportunities to enhance and develop manual, intellectual and social skills. It put forward a do-it-yourself guideline to enhance educational systems. 

Van der Ryn had an innovative and unconventional approach to teaching. In his classes he insisted on creating a more balanced basis among male and female students. He persisted with this principle and was able to create a more equal environment for all with professional aspirations. His vision in relation to architecture was to provide women with similar opportunities as men, accepting equal applicants of men and women in the early 70s.

“Outlaw Builder Studio,” a significant platform for Van der Ryn to demonstrate his new ecological and solar architecture, in which his students could develop building and social skills. Students created, designed and built according to their need while living in the outdoors for at least three days of the week. Later on, some of the projects were dismantled because they didn&#x27;t meet building-code requirements. This was met with some scrutiny in his teaching career from his peers and other professionals. 

Energy Pavilion was a project of interest in the early 70s. This project provided the first mainstream booklet on solar architecture. Students were able to construct an early solar-panel design. This energy-efficient design offered a futuristic glimpse into ecological and environmental architecture. At the time of this project, the world was witnessing the dilemmas of the oil crisis. Van der Ryn encouraged his studio to connect with the surrounding environment and maintain a cohesive approach in design.

===California State Government===
Van der Ryn was appointed California State Architect in the administration of Governor Jerry Brown in the late 1970s. Van der Ryn was in the architecture faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, College of Environmental Design. He lived in California.

===Personal life and death===
Van der Ryn was married to Mimi Wolfe, with whom he had three children: Julia, Micah, and Ethan. Their marriage ended in divorce, as did other marriages to Ruth Friend and Gale Parker. Beyond architecture, he had a passion for watercolor painting. 

Van der Ryn died from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at a care facility in Petaluma, California, on October 19, 2024, at the age of 89.

<doc id="1023011" wikidata="Q1059666" url="?curid=1023011" title="Allen's rule">
<text>Allen&#x27;s rule is an ecogeographical rule formulated by Joel Asaph Allen in 1877, broadly stating that animals adapted to cold climates have shorter and thicker limbs and bodily appendages than animals adapted to warm climates. More specifically, it states that the body surface-area-to-volume ratio for homeothermic animals varies with the average temperature of the habitat to which they are adapted (i.e. the ratio is low in cold climates and high in hot climates).

==Explanation==

Allen&#x27;s rule predicts that endothermic animals with the same body volume should have different surface areas that will either aid or impede their heat dissipation.

Because animals living in cold climates need to conserve as much heat as possible, Allen&#x27;s rule predicts that they should have evolved comparatively low surface area-to-volume ratios to minimize the surface area by which they dissipate heat, allowing them to retain more heat. For animals living in warm climates, Allen&#x27;s rule predicts the opposite: that they should have comparatively high ratios of surface area to volume. Because animals with low surface area-to-volume ratios would overheat quickly, animals in warm climates should, according to the rule, have high surface area-to-volume ratios to maximize the surface area through which they dissipate heat.

==In animals==

Though there are numerous exceptions, many animal populations appear to conform to the predictions of Allen&#x27;s rule. The polar bear has stocky limbs and very short ears that are in accordance with the predictions of Allen&#x27;s rule, so does the snow leopard. In 2007, R.L. Nudds and S.A. Oswald studied the exposed lengths of seabirds&#x27; legs and found that the exposed leg lengths were negatively correlated with &quot;Tm&quot;axdiff (body temperature minus minimum ambient temperature), supporting the predictions of Allen&#x27;s rule. J.S. Alho and colleagues argued that tibia and femur lengths are highest in populations of the common frog that are indigenous to the middle latitudes, consistent with the predictions of Allen&#x27;s rule for ectothermic organisms. Populations of the same species from different latitudes may also follow Allen&#x27;s rule.

R.L. Nudds and S.A. Oswald argued in 2007 that there is poor empirical support for Allen&#x27;s rule, even if it is an &quot;established ecological tenet&quot;. They said that the support for Allen&#x27;s rule mainly draws from studies of single species, since studies of multiple species are &quot;confounded&quot; by the scaling effects of Bergmann&#x27;s rule and alternative adaptations that counter the predictions of Allen&#x27;s rule.

J.S. Alho and colleagues argued in 2011 that, although Allen&#x27;s rule was originally formulated for endotherms, it can also be applied to ectotherms, which derive body temperature from the environment. In their view, ectotherms with lower surface area-to-volume ratios would heat up and cool down more slowly, and this resistance to temperature change might be adaptive in &quot;thermally heterogeneous environments&quot;. Alho said that there has been a renewed interest in Allen&#x27;s rule due to global warming and the &quot;microevolutionary changes&quot; that are predicted by the rule.

==In humans==
Marked differences in limb lengths have been observed when different portions of a given human population reside at different altitudes. Environments at higher altitudes generally experience lower ambient temperatures. In Peru, individuals who lived at higher elevations tended to have shorter limbs, whereas those from the same population who inhabited the more low-lying coastal areas generally had longer limbs and larger trunks.

Katzmarzyk and Leonard similarly noted that human populations appear to follow the predictions of Allen&#x27;s rule.:494 There is a negative association between body mass index and mean annual temperature for indigenous human populations,:490 meaning that people who originate from colder regions have a heavier build for their height and people who originate from warmer regions have a lighter build for their height. Relative sitting height is also negatively correlated with temperature for indigenous human populations,:487–88 meaning that people who originate from colder regions have proportionally shorter legs for their height and people who originate from warmer regions have proportionally longer legs for their height.

In 1968, A.T. Steegman investigated the assumption that Allen&#x27;s rule caused the structural configuration of the face of human populations adapted to polar climate. Steegman did an experiment that involved the survival of rats in the cold. Steegman said that the rats with narrow nasal passages, broader faces, shorter tails and shorter legs survived the best in the cold. Steegman said that the experimental results had similarities with the Arctic Mongoloids, particularly the Eskimo and Aleut, because these have similar morphological features in accordance with Allen&#x27;s rule: a narrow nasal passage, relatively large heads, long to round heads, large jaws, relatively large bodies, and short limbs.

Allen&#x27;s rule may have also resulted in wide noses and alveolar and/or maxillary prognathism being more common in human populations in warmer regions, and the opposite in colder regions.

==Mechanism==

A contributing factor to Allen&#x27;s rule in vertebrates may be that the growth of cartilage is at least partly dependent on temperature. Temperature can directly affect the growth of cartilage, providing a proximate biological explanation for this rule. Experimenters raised mice either at 7 degrees, 21 degrees or 27 degrees Celsius and then measured their tails and ears. They found that the tails and ears were significantly shorter in the mice raised in the cold in comparison to the mice raised at warmer temperatures, even though their overall body weights were the same. They also found that the mice raised in the cold had less blood flow in their extremities. When they tried growing bone samples at different temperatures, the researchers found that the samples grown in warmer temperatures had significantly more growth of cartilage than those grown in colder temperatures.

<text>The Soviet of the Union (, &quot;Sovet Soyuza&quot;) was the lower chamber of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, elected on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage in accordance with the principles of Soviet democracy, and with the rule that each deputy would represent the same number of voters. Under the 1936 Soviet Constitution, there was one deputy for every 300,000 people; this was changed by the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which provided that both chambers would have an equal number of members. Although the party gave general guidelines on nominations, such as the ratio of the social composition of the nominees, much of the work was left to local bodies and people&#x27;s representatives. As opposed to the upper chamber, the Soviet of Nationalities, the Soviet of the Union represented the interests of all of the people of the Soviet Union no matter what their nationality was.

The Soviet of the Union had the same rights and competence as the Soviet of Nationalities, including the right for legislative initiative. In practice, until 1989, it did little more than approve decisions already made by the top leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After the 1989 elections–the first, and as it turned out, only, free elections ever held in the Soviet Union–the Soviet of the Union acquired a much greater role, and was the scene of many lively debates.

The Soviet of the Union elected a chairman (who would lead the sessions of the chamber), his four deputies and permanent commissions: Mandates, Legislative Proposals, Budget Planning, Foreign Affairs, Youth Affairs, Industry, Transportation and Communications, Construction and Industry of Building Materials, Agriculture, Consumer goods, Public Education, Healthcare and Social Security, Science and Culture, Trade, Consumer Service and Municipal Economy, Environment.

In 1989, it was reduced to 271 deputies, elected by the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies. Its deputies were elected representing territorial electoral districts and public organizations, taking into account the size of the electorate in a Union Republic or region. In 1991, after the August Coup, it was renamed the Soviet (Council) of the Union, with its deputies apportioned by the existing quotas and in coordination with the bodies of power in the Union Republics. It would consider only issues concerning civil rights and other issues that didn&#x27;t fall under the Soviet of Nationalities. Its decisions would have to be reviewed by the Soviet of Nationalities.

The Soviet of the Union was effectively dissolved on 12 December 1991, two weeks before the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union, when the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic recalled its deputies, leaving it without a quorum. The legality of this action was questionable, since the Soviet Constitution did not allow a republic to unilaterally recall its deputies. However, by this time what remained of the Soviet government had been rendered more or less impotent and was thus in no position to object. Following the resignation of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet of the Republics dissolved the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, thus dissolving the Soviet of the Union as well.

<doc id="1023019" wikidata="Q1641147" url="?curid=1023019" title="Hypertrophic scar">
<text>A hypertrophic scar is a cutaneous condition characterized by deposits of excessive amounts of collagen which gives rise to a raised scar, but not to the degree observed with keloids. Like keloids, they form most often at the sites of pimples, body piercings, cuts and burns. They often contain nerves and blood vessels. They generally develop after thermal or traumatic injury that involves the deep layers of the dermis and express high levels of TGF-β.

==Cause==
Mechanical tension on a wound has been identified as a leading cause for hypertrophic scar formation.

When a normal wound heals, the body produces new collagen fibers at a rate which balances the breakdown of old collagen. Hypertrophic scars are red to brown and thick and may be itchy or painful. They do not extend beyond the boundary of the original wound, but may continue to thicken for up to six months. Hypertrophic scars usually improve over one or two years, but may cause distress due to their appearance or the intensity of the itching; they can also restrict movement if they are located close to a joint.

Some people have an inherited tendency to hypertrophic scarring, for example, those with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.

==Prevention ==
It is not possible to completely prevent hypertrophic scars, so those with a history of them should inform their doctor or surgeon if they need surgery. For example, pressure garment therapy is a commonly used approach used to try and prevent hypertrophic scarring after a burn, but the effectiveness of this approach is unclear.

==Management==
Early hypertrophic scars should be treated with applied pressure and massage in the first 1.5–3 months. If necessary, silicone therapy should be applied later. Ongoing hypertrophy may be treated with corticosteroids injections. Surgical revision may be considered after 1 year.

=== Silicone gel sheeting ===
Silicone gel sheeting is sometimes used to treat hypertrophic scars. Silicone gel sheets may improve the appearance of scars slightly compared with applying onion extract, and may reduce pain compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets or pressure garments. It is uncertain whether silicone gel sheets are more effective than other treatment approaches. 

=== Laser therapy ===
Laser therapy is an approach that has been studied for treating hypertrophic scars. There is not enough evidence to determine if laser therapy is more effective than other treatments or if laser therapy leads to more harm than benefits as compared with no treatment or different kinds of treatment.

=== Cryosurgery ===
Cryosurgery, using extreme cold to remove dead tissue, may speed up the healing process from a hypertrophic scar to a flatter, paler one.

<doc id="1023023" wikidata="Q5986826" url="?curid=1023023" title="Liniment">
<text>Liniment (from , meaning &quot;to anoint&quot;), also called embrocation and heat rub, is a medicated topical preparation for application to the skin. Some liniments have a viscosity similar to that of water; others are lotion or balm; still, others are in transdermal patches, soft solid sticks, and sprays. Liniment usually is rubbed into the skin, which the active ingredients penetrate.

Liniments are typically sold to relieve pain and stiffness, such as from muscular aches and strains, and arthritis. These are typically formulated from alcohol, acetone, or similar quickly evaporating solvents and contain counterirritant aromatic chemical compounds, such as methyl salicylate, benzoin resin, menthol, and capsaicin. They produce a feeling of warmth within the muscle of the area they are applied to, typically acting as rubefacients via a counterirritant effect.

Methyl salicylate, which is the analgesic ingredient in some heat rubs, can be toxic if used in excess. Heating pads are also not recommended for use with heat rubs, because the added warmth may cause overabsorption of the active ingredients.

== Notable liniments ==
* A.B.C. Liniment was used from approximately 1880 to 1935. It was named for its three primary ingredients: aconite, belladonna, and chloroform. There were numerous examples of poisoning from the mixture, resulting in at least one death.
* Amrutanjan is an analgesic balm manufactured by Amrutanjan Healthcare. It was founded in 1893 by journalist and freedom fighter, Kasinathuni Nageswara Rao.
* Bengay, spelled Ben-Gay before 1995, was developed in France by Dr. Jules Bengué, and brought to America in 1898. It was originally produced by Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, which was acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson.
* Dr. Cox&#x27;s Barbed Wire Liniment and Antiseptic, made by Myers Laboratory. Marketed as treatment for minor wounds (contains iodine) for livestock and humans, such as barbed wire scratches. 
* IcyHot is a line of liniments produced and marketed by Chattem, now a subsidiary of Sanofi.
* Mentholatum Ointment, branded Deep Heat outside of the US, was introduced in December 1894 and is still produced today with numerous variations.
* Minard&#x27;s Liniment: Dr. Levi Minard of Nova Scotia, branded as &quot;The King of Pain,&quot; created his well-known liniment from camphor, ammonia water, and medical turpentine.
* Nine oils: a 19th-century preparation used on both horses and humans. Although druggists&#x27; books sometimes specified recipes, street doctors often promoted any kind of oil as the &quot;nine oils&quot;.
* Opodeldoc: invented by the Renaissance physician Paracelsus.
* RUB A535: introduced in 1919 and manufactured by Church &amp; Dwight in Canada.
* Thermacare: Acquired in 2020 by Italy&#x27;s Angelini when it was spun off following the merger of Pfizer with GlaxoSmithKline&#x27;s consumer healthcare division.
* Tiger Balm was developed during the 1870s in Rangoon, Burma by herbalist Aw Chu Kin, and brought to market by his sons. It is composed of 16% menthol and 28% oil of wintergreen.
* Watkins Liniment: One of Watkins Incorporated&#x27;s original products.

== Use on horses ==
Liniments are commonly used on horses following exercise, applied either by rubbing on full-strength, especially on the legs; or applied in a diluted form, usually added to a bucket of water and sponged on the body. They are used in hot weather to help cool down a horse after working, the alcohol cooling through rapid evaporation, and counterirritant oils dilating capillaries in the skin, increasing the amount of blood releasing heat from the body.

Many horse liniment formulas in diluted form have been used on humans, though products for horses which contain DMSO are not suitable for human use, as DMSO carries the topical product into the bloodstream. Horse liniment ingredients such as menthol, chloroxylenol, or iodine are also used in different formulas in products used by humans.

Absorbine, a horse liniment product manufactured by W.F. Young, Inc., was reformulated for humans and marketed as Absorbine Jr. The company also acquired other liniment brands including Bigeloil and RefreshMint. The equine version of Absorbine is sometimes used by humans, though, anecdotally, its benefits in humans may be because the smell of menthol releases serotonin, or due to a placebo effect.

Earl Sloan was a US entrepreneur who made his initial fortune selling his father&#x27;s horse liniment formula beginning in the period following the Civil War. Sloan&#x27;s liniment with capsicum as a key ingredient was also marketed for human use. He later sold his company to the predecessor of Warner–Lambert, which was purchased in 2000 by Pfizer.

<text>Guinea is a traditional name for the region of the coast of West Africa which lies along the Gulf of Guinea. It is a naturally moist tropical forest or savanna that stretches along the coast and borders the Sahel belt in the north.

== Etymology ==

The etymology of &quot;Guinea&quot; is uncertain. The English term &quot;Guinea&quot; comes directly from the Spanish word &quot;Guinea&quot;, which in turn derives from the Portuguese word &quot;Guiné&quot;. The Portuguese term emerged in the mid-15th century to refer to the lands inhabited by the &quot;Guineus&quot;, a generic term used by the Portuguese to refer to the &quot;black&quot; African peoples living south of the Senegal River (in contrast to the &quot;tawny&quot; Sanhaja Berbers, north of it, whom they called &quot;Azenegues&quot;). The term &quot;Guinea&quot; is extensively used in the 1453 chronicle of Gomes Eanes de Zurara. King John II of Portugal took up the title of &quot;Senhor da Guiné&quot; (Lord of Guinea) from 1481. 

It is believed the Portuguese borrowed &quot;Guineus&quot; from the Berber term &quot;Ghinawen&quot; (sometimes Arabized as غِنَاوَة &quot;Guinauha&quot; or &quot;Genewah&quot;) meaning &quot;the burnt people&quot; (analogous to the Classical Greek &quot;Aithiops&quot;, &quot;of the burned face&quot;). The Berber terms &quot;aginaw&quot; and &quot;Akal n-Iguinawen&quot; mean &quot;black&quot; and &quot;land of the blacks&quot;, respectively.

A competing theory, first forwarded by Leo Africanus in 1526, claims that &quot;Guinea&quot; is derived from Djenné (which he refers to as &quot;Gheneo, Genni&quot; and &quot;Ghinea&quot;), the great interior commercial city on the Upper Niger River. Djenné dominated the gold and salt trade across West Africa, from the 11th century (fall of Ghana) until the 13th century (when the Mali invasion disrupted its routes and redirected trade to Timbuktu, hitherto just a small Djenné outpost). It is during the period of Djenné dominance that the term &quot;Genewah&quot; really comes forward into usage in Arab sources (&quot;al-Sudan&quot; – Arabic for &quot;blacks&quot; – is used more commonly before).

Other theories try to connect &quot;Guinea&quot; to &quot;Ghana&quot;, but this is less certain. The Ghana Empire is named after the Medieval trading city of &quot;Ghanah&quot; mentioned already by 11th-century Arab geographers (e.g. al-Bakri), but it is used distinctly from &quot;Genewah&quot; by Arab sources (e.g. they would say &quot;Ghanah in the country of Genewah&quot;). Conversely, it remains possible that both Ghana and Djenné themselves owe their original city names to the Berber appellation for the blacks that lived there. A possible reconciliation of the theories is that the Berber &quot;Ghinawen&quot; (blacks) was the source of the &quot;Djenné&quot; (city), which in turn gave rise to the Arabic &quot;Genewah&quot; (land dominated by that city), which finally made it into the Portuguese &quot;Guiné&quot;.

==History==

In 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), a Castilian armada of thirty-five caravels and a Portuguese fleet fought the Battle of Guinea in the waters off Elmina, for the hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, ivory and black pepper). The war ended both with a Portuguese naval victory and the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of the Portuguese sovereignty over most of the African territories in dispute (Treaty of Alcáçovas, 1479). This was the first of many colonial wars among European powers. After the Portuguese and Castilians came the Dutch, Danes, French, and British.

The extensive trade in ivory, gold, and slaves made the region wealthy, with a number of centralized kingdoms developing in the 18th and 19th centuries. These were much smaller than the large states of the wide-open Sahel, but they had far higher population densities and were more centralized politically. The cohesion of these kingdoms caused the region to show more resistance to European incursions than other areas of Africa. Such resistance, combined with a disease environment hostile to Europeans, meant that much of Guinea was not colonised by Europeans until the very end of the 19th century.

== Subdivisions ==
Guinea is often subdivided into &quot;Lower Guinea&quot; and &quot;Upper Guinea&quot;. Lower Guinea is one of the most densely populated regions of Africa, covering southern Nigeria, Benin, Togo and stretching into Ghana. It includes the coastal regions as well as the interior. Upper Guinea is far less densely populated and stretches from Côte d&#x27;Ivoire to Senegal.
Within the Republic of Guinea, Lower Guinea refers to the country&#x27;s coastal plain, while Upper Guinea refers to the country&#x27;s interior.

European traders in the region subdivided the region based on its main exports. The eastern portion around Benin and Nigeria was named the Slave Coast. What is now Ghana was called the (British) Gold Coast, a name later given to a British colony in the area which ultimately absorbed earlier European colonies. West of this was the Ivory Coast, still the name of the nation in that region. Farthest west, the area around modern Liberia and Sierra Leone was referred to as either the Pepper Coast or the Grain Coast.

== Countries in the Guinea region ==

From north to south:
* Senegal (formerly French)
* The Gambia (formerly British)
* Guinea-Bissau (formerly Portuguese Guinea)
* Guinea (formerly French Guinea)
* Sierra Leone (British part of the Pepper Coast, originally Province of Freedom)
* Liberia (from U.S. settlements for ex-slaves on the Pepper Coast)
* Ivory Coast or Côte d&#x27;Ivoire
* Ghana (formerly the Gold Coast; Danish Guinea, Dutch Guinea, Portuguese Gold Coast (the first), Prussian Gold Coast and Swedish Guinea all ended up absorbed by the British Gold Coast)
* Togo (formerly Togoland)
* Benin (Dahomey)
* Southern Nigeria

<text>Praia da Vitória (; translating as &quot;Beach of Victory&quot;) is a municipality in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. With a population of 21,035 (in 2011), the second largest administrative authority on the island of Terceira, it covers an area of , that extends from the northern coast halfway into the interior.

==History==


The area of Praia, was one of the first points colonized on the island of Terceira. Praia constituted the seat of the Donatary-Captaincy of Terceira between 1456 and 1474; the island&#x27;s first Captain, Jácome de Bruges along with his first lieutenant, Diogo de Teive, established their residency at this site. By 1474, the island was divided into two captaincies (Praia and Angra): the Captaincy of Praia reverted to Álvaro Martins Homem, Bruges&#x27; successor. The growth of the woad industry and export wheat market concentrated along the fertile &quot;Ramo Grande&quot; area, allowed Praia to grow rapidly. Consequently, Praia was elevated to the status of &quot;vila&quot; (comparable to town) in 1480 (then still within the administration of Álvaro Martins Homem).

By the last quarter of the 16th century, Gaspar Frutuoso (the celebrated Azorean historian), wrote of Praia in these terms:
During the Iberian Union, King Philip II of Spain ordered an armada to Terceira to impose the governorship of Ambrósia de Aguiar Coutinho on his unruly subjects in the Azores and facilitate shipping to the Indies. Under the command of Pedro de Valdez, the fleet arrived in Santa Maria with seven large carracks and 1000 troops, took on provisions and sailed for São Miguel in the spring (where Governor Ambrósio de Aguiar Coutinho and his cousin supplied the group). After an initial assault on Angra, Valdez rushed to assault the island, disembarking troops at the Casa da Salga, in the valley of Porto Judeu (a mile from Vila de São Sebastião), incensed that King Phillip was sending a larger contingent to capture Terceira. The Battle of Salga became an important event in the village of São Sebastião (then a parish of Praia) broke out along the coast in 1582.

During the Restoration of Portuguese Independence, the citizenry of Praia acclaimed King John IV, when Francisco Ornelas da Câmara arrived in Terceira.

The settlement was destroyed during the 1614 &quot;Caída da Praia&quot; earthquake, with many of the residents along the coast lost to the sea. Along the 17th century, even as the community was being re-constructed, there were several seismic aftershocks.

During the Liberal Wars, the harbour was the scene of a naval battle (in 1829) between the Liberals and the Absolutists, competing factions in support of King Pedro IV and King Miguel, respectively, during the Liberal Wars. The Battle of Praia ensued when a squadron of Miguelist troops attempted to disembark at Praia (11 August 1829). As a result of this victory, Queen Maria II after being restored to the throne, acted to recognize its residents for their heroism by appending &quot;Mui Notável&quot; (&quot;Very notable&quot;) and &quot;da Vitória&quot; (&quot;of the Victoria&quot;) to its name (12 January 1837): it was at this time that Praia became known as &quot;Praia da Vitória&quot;.

Its importance in the economy of the north continued, even after the second &quot;Caída da Praia&quot; earthquake (on 15 June 1841), that partially destroyed the settlement. Its reconstruction, at the end of the 19th century was motivated by councillor José Silvestre Ribeiro. As priest Jerónimo Emiliano de Andrade (who lived in the town at the time), referred to Praia da Vitória:
The town was elevated to city on 20 June 1981, although it continued to be referred to as the &quot;Vila da Praia da Vitória&quot; (until 1983). In the second half of the 20th century, a large aerodrome was constructed along the southwestern side of the Portuguese Air Base No.4. In addition, the port of Praia was expanded to include a 1400-metre extension. These two projects have supported the municipality&#x27;s growth, along with its large industrial centre.

==Geography==

Praia da Vitória occupies the northern and eastern coasts of Terceira, bisecting it from northwest to southeast, through a varied geomorphology.

Administratively, the municipality of Praia da Vitória is divided into the following civil parishes, which handle local distribution of services and support the local residents:

* Agualva
* Biscoitos
* Cabo da Praia
* Fonte do Bastardo
* Fontinhas
* Lajes
* Porto Martins
* Santa Cruz
* Quatro Ribeiras
* São Brás
* Vila Nova

The urban centre, that includes the parishes of Lajes and Santa Cruz, fronts a ridge known as &quot;Facho&quot; that overlooks the airport of Lajes. It was used as a lookout for pirates and invaders, and later as marine military semaphore station and primitive lighthouse (lasting for 400 years). Apart from pasture-lands, the ridge was occupied by marine/naval housing and support buildings for Portuguese Air Base 4. At the far end is a monument dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Mary and lookout.

==Economy==
Praia da Vitória is a services, fishing and agricultural municipality and boasts a large marina, popular with the yachting community, with the only sizeable sand beach on Terceira.

Lajes Air Base, a joint United States and Portuguese air force base, lies three kilometers to the north of the town. American servicemen frequent the restaurants and clubs in the town and add considerably to the local economy.

==Architecture==
The town boasts two notable churches, several public squares, and a number of hotels and restaurants.

<text>Christopher Curry (born 28 January 1946) is a British businessman and the co-founder of Acorn Computers, with Hermann Hauser and Andy Hopper. He became a millionaire as a result of Acorn&#x27;s success.

In his early career days, Curry worked at Pye, Royal Radar Establishment and W.R. Grace Laboratories. Then, in April 1966 he joined Sinclair Radionics where he worked for 13 years. He was involved with their hifi products and their Sinclair C5 electric vehicle. In 1972, he helped Sinclair Radionics to launch its first electronic calculator, the Sinclair Executive. He set up Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd. (CPU) in December 1978. Their first product was the Acorn Microcomputer (later called the System 1).

In 1983, Curry co-founded Redwood Publishing with Michael Potter and Christopher Ward, and they bought the &quot;Acorn User&quot; title. In 1985, he founded General Information Systems Ltd (GIS) and remains the director. In 2012, he announced his latest project for GIS, Care with Canary.

== Early life ==

Curry went to school initially in St Neots in Cambridgeshire, then later went to the independent Kimbolton School, also in Cambridgeshire. He gained two A levels, in Maths and Physics. He thought about going to university at the University of Southampton, but was keener to be earning some money whilst learning.

== Early career ==

Curry joined Pye in Cambridge in 1964. He stayed for a few months, then left for the Royal Radar Establishment in Worcestershire. He worked on the radar for the proposed BAC TSR-2. The RRE had been the site of many technological advances such as the integrated circuit in 1952. He stayed for nine months. He moved to the W.R. Grace Laboratories, run by ITT, and stayed for six months.

== Sinclair Radionics ==

In April 1966, Curry joined Sinclair Radionics, a company founded by Clive Sinclair in 1961. Curry was to play an important role in getting Sinclair interested in both calculators and computers in his thirteen years with the company.

Curry was at first involved with Sinclair&#x27;s hifi products, which included amplifiers and speakers, and he also worked on Sinclair&#x27;s electric vehicle, a project that would turn into the C5 some years later.

In 1972, Sinclair Radionics launched its first electronic calculator, the Executive, which was considerably smaller than its competitors since it used hearing-aid-sized batteries. Curry and Jim Westwood had discovered that it was possible to exploit persistence in the diode displays and memory and introduced a timer that removed the power from these components for most of the time. This discovery dramatically improved the lasting-power of the batteries.

Until 1976 Sinclair Radionics had enjoyed 15 years of strong turnover and profit growth. However, the company sustained losses related to difficulties with chip supplies for the Black Watch. As a result, there were insufficient internal funds available for the final stages of the pocket TV project Sinclair had been working on for some 10 years. In August 1976 the National Enterprise Board (NEB) provided £650,000 in return for 43 per cent stake in Sinclair Radionics. Sinclair did not like sharing control of his company. Thus, he converted a company he had purchased in 1973, Ablesdeal Ltd, into Westminster Mail Order Ltd, which was itself renamed to Sinclair Instrument Ltd. In this way, he maintained control of his most important projects.

== Science of Cambridge ==

Shortly after the NEB took control Sinclair encouraged Curry to leave Sinclair Radionics to get Sinclair Instruments off the ground. Curry borrowed some money and rented offices at 6 King&#x27;s Parade, Cambridge. To raise cash, Sinclair Instruments released the Wrist Calculator, designed by John Pemberton, in February 1977. The product was successful, selling 15,000 units.

In July 1977, the company was renamed to &quot;Science of Cambridge Ltd&quot;. Around the same time Ian Williamson showed Curry a prototype computer based around a National Semiconductor SC/MP and some parts scavenged from a Sinclair &quot;Cambridge&quot; calculator. Curry was impressed and encouraged Sinclair to adopt this as a product; an agreement was reached with Williamson but no contract was ever signed: Nat Semi had offered to redesign the project so that it used only their components and they also offered to manufacture the boards.

Curry took Nat Semi up on its offer and in June 1978 Science of Cambridge launched a microcomputer kit (marketed as the MK14) based around the National SC/MP chip. Curry wanted to further develop the MK14 but Sinclair was working on the NewBrain. Sinclair&#x27;s reluctance to develop the MK14 led Curry to consider his options. Throughout the MK14 project he had been discussing it with his friend, physics researcher Hermann Hauser, who had also helped by seeking out advice from the many computer experts on hand in Cambridge University.

== Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd ==

Curry and Hauser had become increasingly interested in the idea of selling their own computers and so, on 5 December 1978, they set up Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd (CPU). Their first customer was Ace Coin Equipment Ltd, who needed controllers for their fruit machines. Hauser and Curry recruited Steve Furber - at the time a Cambridge PhD student who was closely involved with local amateur computer groups - to design the device. Furber would go on to become a key figure at Acorn - leading the design of the BBC Micro (along with Sophie Wilson), and later on the ARM microprocessor.

== Acorn Computer ==

The Acorn Microcomputer (later to be called the System 1) was launched as the first product of a new company, Acorn Computers Ltd, founded in March 1979. 

After becoming a millionaire as a result of Acorn&#x27;s success with the BBC Micro project, in 1983 Curry co-founded Redwood Publishing with Michael Potter (former publisher of advertising trade weekly Campaign) and Christopher Ward (former editor of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper). The company bought the Acorn User title.

== GIS ==

At the time of the Olivetti takeover of Acorn in 1985 Curry founded General Information Systems Ltd (GIS), based on Acorn&#x27;s Communications Group, and he remains a director.

GIS specialises in Smart Card technologies for access control and electronic money. In 2012 he announced his latest project with GIS, Care with Canary, a wireless sensor system that allows family members to remotely monitor relatives living alone and triggers alerts.
