<text>Sir Roger Vernon Scruton, (; 27 February 194412 January 2020) was an English philosopher, writer, and social critic who specialised in aesthetics and political philosophy, particularly in the furtherance of conservative views.

Editor from 1982 to 2001 of &quot;The Salisbury Review&quot;, a conservative political journal, Scruton wrote over 50 books on philosophy, art, music, politics, literature, culture, sexuality, and religion; he also wrote novels and two operas. His publications include &quot;The Meaning of Conservatism&quot; (1980), &quot;Sexual Desire&quot; (1986), &quot;The Aesthetics of Music&quot; (1997), and &quot;How to Be a Conservative&quot; (2014). He was a regular contributor to the popular media, including &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;.

Scruton explained that he embraced conservatism after witnessing the May 1968 student protests in France. From 1971 to 1992 he was lecturer, reader, and then Professor of Aesthetics at Birkbeck College, London, after which he was Professor of Philosophy at Boston University, from 1992 to 1995. From then on, he worked as a freelance writer and scholar, though he later held several part-time or temporary academic positions, including in the United States. In the 1980s he helped to establish underground academic networks in Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe, for which he was awarded the Czech Republic&#x27;s Medal of Merit (First Class) by President Václav Havel in 1998. Scruton was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for &quot;services to philosophy, teaching and public education&quot;.

==Early life==
===Family background===
Roger Scruton was born in Buslingthorpe, Lincolnshire, to John &quot;Jack&quot; Scruton, a teacher from Manchester, and his wife, Beryl Claris Scruton (née Haynes), and was raised with his two sisters in High Wycombe and Marlow. The Scruton surname had been acquired relatively recently. Jack&#x27;s father&#x27;s birth certificate showed him as Matthew Lowe, after Matthew&#x27;s mother, Margaret Lowe (Scruton&#x27;s great-grandmother); the document made no mention of a father. However, Margaret Lowe had decided, for reasons unknown, to raise her son as Matthew Scruton instead. Scruton wondered whether she had been employed at the former Scruton Hall in Scruton, Yorkshire, and whether that was where her child had been conceived.

Jack was raised in a back-to-back on Upper Cyrus Street, Ancoats, an inner-city area of Manchester, and won a scholarship to Manchester High School, a grammar school. Scruton told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Jack hated the upper classes and loved the countryside, while Beryl entertained &quot;blue-rinsed friends&quot; and was fond of romantic fiction. He described his mother as &quot;cherishing an ideal of gentlemanly conduct and social distinction that ... [his] father set out with considerable relish to destroy&quot;.

===Education===

The Scrutons lived in a pebbledashed semi-detached house in Hammersley Lane, High Wycombe. Although his parents had been brought up as Christians, they regarded themselves as humanists, so home was a &quot;religion-free zone&quot;. Scruton&#x27;s, indeed the whole family&#x27;s, relationship with his father was difficult. He wrote in &quot;Gentle Regrets&quot; (2005): &quot;Friends come and go, hobbies and holidays dapple the soulscape like fleeting sunlight in a summer wind, and the hunger for affection is cut off at every point by the fear of judgement.&quot;

After passing his 11-plus, he attended the Royal Grammar School High Wycombe from 1954 to 1962, leaving with three A-levels, in pure and applied Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, which he passed with distinction. The results won him an open scholarship in Natural Sciences to Jesus College, Cambridge, as well as a state scholarship. When he told his family he had won a place at Cambridge, his father stopped speaking to him. Scruton writes that he was expelled from the school shortly afterwards when, during one of Scruton&#x27;s plays, the headmaster found the school stage on fire and a half-naked girl putting out the flames.

Having intended to study Natural Sciences at Cambridge, where he felt &quot;although socially estranged (like virtually every grammar-school boy), spiritually at home&quot;, Scruton switched on the first day to Moral Sciences (Philosophy); his supervisor was A. C. Ewing. He graduated with a double first in 1965, then spent time overseas, some of it teaching at the University of Pau and Pays de l&#x27;Adour in Pau, France, where he met his first wife, Danielle Laffitte. He also lived in Rome. His mother died around this time; she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had undergone a mastectomy just before he went to Cambridge.

In 1967, he began studying for his doctorate at Jesus College and then became a research fellow at Peterhouse, Cambridge (1969–1971), where he lived with Laffitte when she was not in France. It was while visiting her during the May 1968 student protests in France that Scruton first embraced conservatism. He was in the Latin Quarter in Paris, watching students overturn cars, smash windows and tear up cobblestones, and for the first time in his life &quot;felt a surge of political anger&quot;:

 I suddenly realised I was on the other side. What I saw was an unruly mob of self-indulgent middle-class hooligans. When I asked my friends what they wanted, what were they trying to achieve, all I got back was this ludicrous Marxist gobbledegook. I was disgusted by it, and thought there must be a way back to the defence of western civilization against these things. That&#x27;s when I became a conservative. I knew I wanted to conserve things rather than pull them down.

==1970s–1980s==
===Birkbeck, first marriage===

Cambridge awarded Scruton his PhD degree in January 1973 for a thesis titled &quot;Art and imagination, a study in the philosophy of mind&quot;, supervised by Elizabeth Anscombe. The thesis was the basis of his first book, &quot;Art and Imagination&quot; (1974). From 1971 he taught philosophy at Birkbeck College, London, which specializes in adult education and holds its classes in the evening. Meanwhile, Laffitte taught French at Putney High School, and the couple lived together in a Harley Street apartment previously occupied by Delia Smith. They married in September 1973 at the Brompton Oratory, a Catholic church in Knightsbridge, and divorced in 1979. Scruton&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Aesthetics of Architecture&quot;, was published that year.

Scruton said he was the only conservative at Birkbeck, except for the woman who served meals in the Senior Common Room. Working there left Scruton&#x27;s days free, so he used the time to study law at the Inns of Court School of Law (1974–1976) and was called to the Bar in 1978; he never practised because he was unable to take a year off work to complete a pupillage.

In 1974, along with Hugh Fraser, Jonathan Aitken and John Casey, he became a founding member of the Conservative Philosophy Group dining club, which aimed to develop an intellectual basis for conservatism. The historian Hugh Thomas and the philosopher Anthony Quinton attended meetings, as did Margaret Thatcher before she became prime minister. She reportedly said during one meeting in 1975: &quot;The other side have got an ideology they can test their policies against. We must have one as well.&quot;

According to Scruton, his academic career at Birkbeck was blighted by his conservatism, particularly by his third book, &quot;The Meaning of Conservatism&quot; (1980), and later by his editorship of the conservative &quot;Salisbury Review&quot;. He told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that his colleagues at Birkbeck vilified him over the book. The Marxist philosopher G. A. Cohen of University College London reportedly refused to teach a seminar with Scruton, although they later became friends. He continued teaching at Birkbeck until 1992, first as a lecturer, by 1980 as reader, then, having been awarded a chair in 1985, as Professor of Aesthetics.

===&quot;The Salisbury Review&quot;===

In 1982 Scruton became founding editor of &quot;The Salisbury Review&quot;, a journal championing conservatism in opposition to Thatcherism, which he edited until 2001. The &quot;Review&quot; was set up by a group of Tories known as the Salisbury Groupfounded in 1978 by Diana Spearman and Robert Gascoyne-Cecilwith the involvement of the Peterhouse Right. The latter were conservatives associated with the Cambridge college, including Maurice Cowling, David Watkin and the mathematician Adrian Mathias. As of 1983 it had a circulation of under 1,000; according to Martin Walker, the circulation understated the journal&#x27;s influence.

Scruton wrote that editing &quot;The Salisbury Review&quot; effectively ended his academic career in the United Kingdom. The magazine sought to provide an intellectual basis for conservatism, and was highly critical of key issues of the period, including the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, egalitarianism, feminism, foreign aid, multiculturalism and modernism. In the first edition, he wrote: &quot;It is necessary to establish a conservative dominance in intellectual life, not because this is the quickest or most certain way to political influence, but because in the long run, it is the only way to create a climate of opinion favourable to the conservative cause.&quot; To begin with, Scruton had to write most of the articles himself, using pseudonyms: &quot;I had to make it look as though there was something there in order that &quot;there should be something there!&quot;&quot; He believes that the &quot;Review&quot; &quot;helped a new generation of conservative intellectuals to emerge. At last it was possible to be a conservative and also to the &quot;left&quot; of something, to say &#x27;Of course, the &quot;Salisbury Review&quot; is beyond the pale; but ...

In 1984 the &quot;Review&quot; published a controversial article by Ray Honeyford, a headmaster in Bradford, questioning the benefits of multicultural education. Honeyford was forced to retire because of the article and had to live for a time under police protection. The British Association for the Advancement of Science accused the &quot;Review&quot; of scientific racism, and the University of Glasgow philosophy department boycotted a talk Scruton had been invited to deliver to its philosophy society. Scruton believed that the incidents made his position as a university professor untenable, although he also maintained that &quot;it was worth sacrificing your chances of becoming a Fellow of the British Academy, a vice-chancellor or an emeritus professor for the sheer relief of uttering the truth.&quot; (Scruton was in fact elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 2008.) In 2002 he described the effect of the editorship on his life:

 It cost me many thousand hours of unpaid labour, a hideous character assassination in &quot;Private Eye&quot;, three lawsuits, two interrogations, one expulsion, the loss of a university career in Britain, unendingly contemptuous reviews, Tory suspicion, and the hatred of decent liberals everywhere. And it was worth it.

===Writing===
The 1980s established Scruton as a prolific writer. Thirteen of his non-fiction works appeared between 1980 and 1989, as did his first novel, &quot;Fortnight&#x27;s Anger&quot; (1981). The most contentious publication was &quot;Thinkers of the New Left&quot; (1985), a collection of his essays from &quot;The Salisbury Review&quot;, which criticized 14 prominent intellectuals, including E. P. Thompson, Michel Foucault and Jean-Paul Sartre. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the book was remaindered after being greeted with &quot;derision and outrage&quot;. Scruton said he became very depressed by the criticism. In 1987 he founded his own publisher, The Claridge Press, which he sold to the Continuum International Publishing Group in 2002.

From 1983 to 1986 he wrote a weekly column for &quot;The Times&quot;. Topics included music, wine and motorbike repair, but others were contentious. The features editor, Peter Stothard, said that there was no one he had ever commissioned &quot;whose articles had provoked more rage&quot;. Scruton made fun of anti-racism and the peace movement, and his support for Margaret Thatcher while she was prime minister was regarded, he wrote, as an &quot;act of betrayal for a university teacher&quot;. His first column, &quot;Why politicians are all against real education&quot;, argued that universities were destroying education &quot;by making it relevant&quot;: &quot;Replace pure by applied mathematics, logic by computer programming, architecture by engineering, history by sociology. The result will be a new generation of well-informed philistines, whose charmlessness will undo every advantage which their learning might otherwise have conferred.&quot;

===Activism in Central Europe===

From 1979 to 1989, Scruton was an active supporter of dissidents in Czechoslovakia under Communist Party rule, forging links between the country&#x27;s dissident academics and their counterparts in Western universities. As part of the Jan Hus Educational Foundation, he and other academics visited Prague and Brno, now in the Czech Republic, in support of an underground education network started by the Czech dissident Julius Tomin, smuggling in books, organizing lectures, and eventually arranging for students to study for a Cambridge external degree in theology (the only faculty that responded to the request for help). There were structured courses and &quot;samizdat&quot; translations, books were printed, and people sat exams in a cellar with papers smuggled out through the diplomatic bag.

Scruton was detained in 1985 in Brno before being expelled from the country. The Czech dissident Bronislava Müllerová watched him walk across the border with Austria: &quot;There was this broad empty space between the two border posts, absolutely empty, not a single human being in sight except for one soldier, and across that broad empty space trudged an English philosopher, Roger Scruton, with his little bag into Austria.&quot; On 17 June that year, he was placed on the Index of Undesirable Persons. He wrote that he had also been followed during visits to Poland and Hungary.

For his work in supporting dissidents, Scruton was awarded the First of June Prize in 1993 by the Czech city of Plzeň, and in 1998 he was awarded the Czech Republic&#x27;s Medal of Merit (First Class) by President Václav Havel. In 2019 the Polish government awarded him the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland. Scruton was strongly critical of figures in the Westin particular Eric Hobsbawmwho &quot;chose to exonerate&quot; the crimes and atrocities of former communist regimes. His experience of dissident intellectual life in 1980s Communist Prague is recorded in fictional form in his novel &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; (2014). He wrote in 2019 that &quot;despite the appeal of the Poles, Hungarians, Romanians and many more, it is the shy, cynical Czechs to whom I lost my heart and from whom I have never retrieved it&quot;.

==1990s–2000s==
===Farm purchase, second marriage===

Scruton took a year&#x27;s sabbatical from Birkbeck in 1990 and spent it working in Brno in the Czech Republic. That year he registered Central European Consulting, established to offer business advice in post-communist Central Europe. He sold his apartment in Notting Hill Gate, and when he returned to England, he rented a cottage in Stanton Fitzwarren, Swindon, from the Moonies, and an apartment in Albany on Piccadilly, London, from the Conservative MP Alan Clark (it had been Clark&#x27;s servants&#x27; quarters).

From 1992 to 1995, he lived in Boston, Massachusetts, teaching an elementary philosophy course and a graduate course on the philosophy of music for one semester a year, as professor of philosophy at Boston University. Two of his books grew out of these courses: &quot;Modern Philosophy: A Survey&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Aesthetics of Music&quot; (1997). In 1993 he bought Sundey Hill Farm in Brinkworth, Wiltshire—35 acres later increased to 100, and a 250-year-old farmhousewhere he lived after returning from the United States. He called it &quot;Scrutopia&quot;.

While in Boston, Scruton had flown back to England every weekend to indulge his passion for fox hunting, and it was during a meet of the Beaufort Hunt that he met Sophie Jeffreys, an architectural historian. They announced their engagement in &quot;The Times&quot; in September 1996 (Jeffreys was described as &quot;the youngest daughter of the late Lord Jeffreys and of Annie-Lou Lady Jeffreys&quot;), married later that year and set up home on Sunday Hill Farm. Their two children were born in 1998 and 2000. In 1999 they created Horsell&#x27;s Farm Enterprises, a PR firm that included Japan Tobacco International and Somerfield as clients. Scruton and his publisher were sued for libel that year by the Pet Shop Boys for suggesting, in his book &quot;An Intelligent Person&#x27;s Guide to Modern Culture&quot; (1998), that their songs were in large part the work of sound engineers; the group settled for undisclosed damages.

===Tobacco company funding===
Scruton was criticized in 2002 for having written articles about smoking without disclosing that he was receiving a regular fee from Japan Tobacco International (JTI, formerly R. J. Reynolds). In 1999 he and his wifeas part of their consultancy work for Horsell&#x27;s Farm Enterprisesbegan producing a quarterly briefing paper, &quot;The Risk of Freedom Briefing&quot; (1999–2007), about the state&#x27;s control of risk. Distributed to journalists, the paper included discussions about drugs, alcohol and tobacco, and was sponsored by JTI. Scruton wrote several articles in defence of smoking around this time, including one in 1998 for &quot;The Times&quot;, three for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; (two in 1998 and one in 2000), one for &quot;City Journal&quot; in 2001, and a 65-page pamphlet for the Institute of Economic Affairs, &quot;WHO, What, and Why: Trans-national Government, Legitimacy and the World Health Organisation&quot; (2000). The latter criticized the World Health Organization&#x27;s campaign against smoking, arguing that transnational bodies should not seek to influence domestic legislation because they are not answerable to the electorate.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2002 that Scruton had been writing about these issues while failing to disclose that he was receiving £54,000 a year from JTI. The payments came to light when a September 2001 email from the Scrutons to JTI was leaked to &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Signed by Scruton&#x27;s wife, the email asked the company to increase their £4,500 monthly fee to £5,500, in exchange for which Scruton would &quot;aim to place an article every two months&quot; in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Spectator&quot;, &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;Economist&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, or &quot;New Statesman&quot;. Scruton, who said the email had been stolen, replied that he had never concealed his connection with JTI. In response to &quot;The Guardian&quot; article, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; ended his contract as a columnist, The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; suspended his contributions, and the Institute for Economic Affairs said it would introduce an author-declaration policy. Chatto &amp; Windus withdrew from negotiations for a book, and Birkbeck removed his visiting-professor privileges.

===Move to the United States===

The tobacco controversy damaged Scruton&#x27;s consultancy business in England. In part because of that, and because the Hunting Act 2004 had banned fox hunting in England and Wales, the Scrutons considered moving to the United States permanently, and in 2004 they purchased Montpelier, an 18th-century plantation house near Sperryville, Virginia. Scruton set up a company, Montpelier Strategy LLC, to promote the house as a venue for weddings and similar events. The couple lived there while retaining Sunday Hill Farm in England, but decided in 2009 against a permanent move to the United States and sold the house. Scruton held two part-time academic positions during this period. From 2005 to 2009 he was research professor at the Institute for the Psychological Sciences in Arlington, Virginia, a graduate school of Divine Mercy University; and in 2009 he worked at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., where he wrote his book &quot;Green Philosophy&quot; (2011).

===Wine, opera===
From 2001 to 2009 Scruton wrote a wine column for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and contributed to &quot;The World of Fine Wine&quot; and &quot;Questions of Taste: The Philosophy of Wine&quot; (2007), with his essay &quot;The Philosophy of Wine&quot;. His book &quot;I Drink Therefore I Am: A Philosopher&#x27;s Guide to Wine&quot; (2009) in part comprises material from his &quot;New Statesman&quot; column.

Scruton, who was largely self-taught as a composer, apart from some early guidance from his friend David Matthews, composed two operas setting his own libretti. The first is a one-act chamber piece, &quot;The Minister&quot; (1994), and the second a two-act opera, &quot;Violet&quot; (2005). The latter, based on the life of the British harpsichordist Violet Gordon-Woodhouse, was performed twice at the Guildhall School of Music in London in 2005. Scruton also composed &quot;Three Lorca Songs&quot;, which were performed in the Netherlands by soprano Kristina Bitenc and pianist Jeroen Sarphati in 2009, and he wrote the libretto to &quot;Anna&quot;, a two-act opera by David Matthews which premiered at The Grange Festival on 14 July 2023.

==2010s==
===Academic posts, knighthood===
The Scrutons returned from the United States to live at Sunday Hill Farm in Wiltshire, and Scruton took an unpaid research professorship at the University of Buckingham. In January 2010 he began an unpaid three-year visiting professorship at the University of Oxford to teach graduate classes on aesthetics, and was made a senior research fellow of Blackfriars Hall, Oxford. In 2010 he delivered the Scottish Gifford Lectures at the University of St Andrews on &quot;The Face of God&quot;, and from 2011 until 2014 he held a quarter-time professorial fellowship at St Andrews in moral philosophy.

Two novels appeared during this period: &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; (2014) is based on his experiences in Czechoslovakia, and &quot;The Disappeared&quot; (2015) deals with child trafficking in a Yorkshire town. Scruton was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for &quot;services to philosophy, teaching and public education&quot;. He sat on the editorial board of the &quot;British Journal of Aesthetics&quot; and on the board of visitors of Ralston College, a new college proposed in Savannah, Georgia, and was a senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C.

===Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission===
In November 2018, Communities Secretary James Brokenshire appointed Scruton as unpaid chair of the British government&#x27;s Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission, established to promote better home design. Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs objected because of remarks Scruton had made years earlier: he had described &quot;Islamophobia&quot; as a &quot;propaganda word&quot;, homosexuality as &quot;not normal&quot;, lesbianism as an attempt to find &quot;committed love that [a woman] can&#x27;t get from men any more&quot;, and date rape as not a distinct crime. He had also made allegedly conspiratorial remarks about the Jewish businessman George Soros.

In April 2019, an interview of Scruton by George Eaton appeared in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. To publicise it, Eaton posted edited extracts from the interview on Twitter, of Scruton talking about Soros, Chinese people and Islam, among other topics, and referred to them as &quot;a series of outrageous remarks&quot;. Immediately after the interview and Eaton&#x27;s posts went online, Scruton began to be criticised by various politicians and journalists; hours later, Brokenshire dismissed Scruton from the Commission. When Scruton&#x27;s dismissal was announced, Eaton posted a photograph of himself on Instagram drinking from a bottle of champagne, captioned, &quot;The feeling when you get right-wing racist and homophobe Roger Scruton sacked as a Tory government adviser&quot;. The next day, Scruton wrote in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;We in Britain are entering a dangerous social condition in which the direct expression of opinions that conflictor merely seem to conflictwith a narrow set of orthodoxies is instantly punished by a band of self-appointed vigilantes.&quot; On 12 April, Eaton apologised for his tweets and the Instagram post but otherwise stood by the interview, but would not release a full recording.

On 25 April, Scruton&#x27;s colleague Douglas Murray, who had obtained a full recording of the interview, published details of it in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and wrote that Eaton had conducted a &quot;hit job&quot;. The audio suggested that both the tweets and Eaton&#x27;s article had omitted relevant context. For example, Scruton had said: &quot;Anybody who doesn&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s a Soros empire in Hungary has not observed the facts&quot;, but the article omitted: &quot;it&#x27;s not necessarily an empire of Jews; that&#x27;s such nonsense.&quot; Of the Chinese, Eaton tweeted that Scruton had said: &quot;Each Chinese person is a kind of replica of the next one and that is a very frightening thing.&quot; Eaton&#x27;s article included more words: &quot;They&#x27;re creating robots out of their own people ... each Chinese person is a kind of replica ...&quot; The transcript showed the full sentence: &quot;In a sense they&#x27;re creating robots out of their own people by so constraining what can be done,&quot; which suggested the topic was the Chinese Communist Party. In response, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; published the full transcript.

On 2 May, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; readers&#x27; editor, Peter Wilby, wrote that Eaton&#x27;s online comments suggested that he had &quot;approached the interview as a political activist, not as a journalist&quot;. Two months later, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; officially apologised. Several days later, Brokenshire also apologised to Scruton. Scruton was re-appointed a week later as co-chair of the commission.

==Cultural views==

===Aesthetics===
According to Paul Guyer, in &quot;A History of Modern Aesthetics: The Twentieth Century&quot;, &quot;After Wollheim, the most significant British aesthetician has been Roger Scruton.&quot; Scruton was trained in analytic philosophy, although he was drawn to other traditions. &quot;I remain struck by the thin and withered countenance that philosophy quickly assumes,&quot; he wrote in 2012, &quot;when it wanders away from art and literature, and I cannot open a journal like &quot;Mind&quot; or &quot;The Philosophical Review&quot; without experiencing an immediate sinking of the heart, like opening a door into a morgue.&quot;

He specialised in aesthetics throughout his career. From 1971 to 1992 he taught aesthetics at Birkbeck College. His PhD thesis formed the basis of his first book, &quot;Art and Imagination&quot; (1974), in which he argued that &quot;what demarcates aesthetic interest from other sorts is that it involves the appreciation of something for its own sake&quot;. He subsequently published &quot;The Aesthetics of Architecture&quot; (1979), &quot;The Aesthetic Understanding&quot; (1983), &quot;The Aesthetics of Music&quot; (1997), and &quot;Beauty&quot; (2010). In 2008 a two-day conference was held at Durham University to assess his impact in the field, and in 2012 a collection of essays, &quot;Scruton&#x27;s Aesthetics&quot;, edited by Andy Hamilton and Nick Zangwill, was published by Palgrave Macmillan.

In an Intelligence Squared debate in March 2009, Scruton (seconding historian David Starkey) proposed the motion: &quot;Britain has become indifferent to beauty&quot;, and held an image of Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; next to one of the supermodel Kate Moss. Later that year he wrote and presented a BBC Two documentary, &quot;Why Beauty Matters&quot;, in which he argued that beauty should be restored to its traditional position in art, architecture and music. He wrote that he had received &quot;more than 500 e-mails from viewers, all but one saying, &#x27;Thank Heavens someone is saying what needs to be said. In 2018 he argued that a belief in God makes for more beautiful architecture:
===Philosophy of sex===
The philosopher of religion Christopher Hamilton described Scruton&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Desire&quot; (1986) as &quot;the most interesting and insightful philosophical account of sexual desire&quot; produced within analytic philosophy. The book influenced subsequent discussions of sexual ethics. Martha Nussbaum (who had reviewed the work in 1986) credited Scruton in 1995 with having provided &quot;the most interesting philosophical attempt as yet to work through the moral issues involved in our treatment of persons as sex partners&quot;.

According to Jonathan Dollimore, Scruton based a conservative sexual ethic on the Hegelian proposition that &quot;the final end of every rational being is the building of the self&quot;, which involves recognizing the other as an end in itself. Scruton argues that the major feature of perversion is &quot;sexual release that avoids or abolishes the &quot;other&quot;&quot;, which he sees as narcissistic and solipsistic. Nussbaum countered that Scruton did not apply his principle of otherness equallyfor example, to sexual relationships between adults and children or between Protestants and Catholics.

In an essay, &quot;Sexual morality and the liberal consensus&quot; (1990), Scruton wrote that homosexuality leads to the &quot;de-sanctifying of the human body&quot; because the body of the homosexual&#x27;s lover belongs to the same category as his own. He further argued that gay people have no children and consequently no interest in creating a socially stable future. He therefore considered it justified to &quot;instil in our children feelings of revulsion&quot; towards homosexuality, and in 2007 he challenged the idea that gay people should have the right to adopt. Scruton told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2010 that he would no longer defend the view that revulsion against homosexuality can be justified.

===Religion===
Scruton was an Anglican. His book &quot;Our Church: A Personal History of the Church of England&quot; (2013) defended the relevance of the Church of England. He contends, following Immanuel Kant, that human beings have a transcendental dimension, a sacred core exhibited in their capacity for self-reflection. He argues that we are in an era of secularization without precedent in the history of the world; writers and artists such as Rainer Maria Rilke, T. S. Eliot, Edward Hopper and Arnold Schoenberg &quot;devoted much energy to recuperating the experience of the sacredbut as a private rather than a public form of consciousness.&quot; Because these thinkers directed their art at the few, he writes, it has never appealed to the many.

On the matter of evidence of God&#x27;s existence, Scruton said: &quot;Rational argument can get us just so far... It can help us to understand the real difference between a faith that commands us to forgive our enemies, and one that commands us to slaughter them. But the leap of faith itselfthis placing of your life at God&#x27;s serviceis a leap over reason&#x27;s edge. This does not make it irrational, any more than falling in love is irrational.&quot; But despite claiming that belief alone is sufficiently rational, he advocated a form of the argument from beauty: he said that when we take the beauty in the natural world around us as a gift, we are able to openly understand God. The beauty speaks to us, he claims, and from it we can understand God&#x27;s presence around us.

===Education===
Scruton considered that moral education should be &quot;endarkening&quot; as well as &quot;enlightening&quot;, with &quot;endarkening&quot; being used as the inverse of &quot;enlightening&quot;. &quot;Endarkenment&quot; is Scruton&#x27;s way of describing the process of socialization through which certain behaviours and choices are closed off and forbidden to the subject, which he considers necessary to curb socially damaging impulses and behaviour:moral education cannot be ... purely enlightened and enlightening ... it cannot be simply a matter of teaching [people] to calculate the long term profit and the loss, while leaving .. desires to develop independently. It must involve an endarkened and endarkening component, by which [people] are taught precisely to cease [their] calculations, to regard certain paths as forbidden, as places where neither profit nor loss has authority.

==Political views==
===Conservatism===

Scruton was best known for his writing in support of conservatism, and his intellectual heroes were Edmund Burke, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, John Ruskin, and T. S. Eliot. His third book, &quot;The Meaning of Conservatism&quot; (1980)which he called &quot;a somewhat Hegelian defence of Tory values in the face of their betrayal by the free marketeers&quot;was responsible, he said, for blighting his academic career. He supported Margaret Thatcher, while remaining sceptical of her view of the market as a solution to everything, but after the Falklands War, he thought that she &quot;recognised that the self-identity of the country was at stake, and that its revival was a political task&quot;.

Scruton wrote in &quot;Gentle Regrets&quot; (2005) that he found several of Burke&#x27;s arguments in &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790) persuasive. Although Burke was writing about revolution, not socialism, Scruton was persuaded that, as he put it, the utopian promises of socialism are accompanied by an abstract vision of the mind that bears little relation to the way most people think. Burke also convinced him that there is no direction to history, no moral or spiritual progress; that people think collectively toward a common goal only during crises such as war, and that trying to organize society this way requires a real or imagined enemy; hence, Scruton wrote, the strident tone of socialist literature.

Scruton further argued, following Burke, that society is held together by authority and the rule of law, in the sense of the right to obedience, not by the imagined rights of citizens. Obedience, he wrote, is &quot;the prime virtue of political beings, the disposition that makes it possible to govern them, and without which societies crumble into &#x27;the dust and powder of individuality. Real freedom does not stand in conflict with obedience, but is its other side. He was also persuaded by Burke&#x27;s arguments about the social contract, including that most parties to the contract are either dead or not yet born. To forget this, he wroteto throw away customs and institutionsis to &quot;place the present members of society in a dictatorial dominance over those who went before, and those who came after them&quot;.

Beliefs that appear to be examples of prejudice may be useful and important, he wrote: &quot;our most necessary beliefs may be both unjustified and unjustifiable, from our own perspective, and the attempt to justify them will merely lead to their loss.&quot; A prejudice in favour of modesty in women and chivalry in men, for example, may aid the stability of sexual relationships and the raising of children, although these are not offered as reasons in support of the prejudice. It may therefore be easy to show the prejudice as irrational, but there will be a loss nonetheless if it is discarded.

In &quot;Arguments for Conservatism&quot; (2006), Scruton marked out the areas in which philosophical thinking is required if conservatism is to be intellectually persuasive. He argued that human beings are creatures of limited and local affections. Territorial loyalty is at the root of all forms of government where law and liberty reign supreme; every expansion of jurisdiction beyond the frontiers of the nation state leads to a decline in accountability.

He opposed elevating the &quot;nation&quot; above its people, which would threaten rather than facilitate citizenship and peace. &quot;Conservatism and conservation&quot; are two aspects of a single policy, that of husbanding resources, including the social capital embodied in laws, customs and institutions, and the material capital contained in the environment. He argued further that the law should not be used as a weapon to advance special interests. People impatient for reformfor example in the areas of euthanasia or abortionare reluctant to accept what may be &quot;glaringly obvious to othersthat the law exists precisely to impede their ambitions&quot;.

===Postmodernism===
Scruton defines post-modernism as the claim that there are no grounds for truth, objectivity, and meaning, and that conflicts between views are therefore nothing more than contests of power. Scruton argued that, while the West is required to judge other cultures in their own terms, Western culture is adversely judged as ethnocentric and racist. He wrote: &quot;The very reasoning which sets out to destroy the ideas of objective truth and absolute value imposes political correctness as absolutely binding, and cultural relativism as objectively true.&quot;

===Feminism===
Scruton was critical of the contemporary feminist movement, while reserving praise for suffragists such as Mary Wollstonecraft. However, he praised Germaine Greer in 2016, saying that she had &quot;cast an awful lot of light on our literary tradition&quot; by showing the male as the dominant figure, and defended her against criticism for having used the word &quot;sex&quot; to describe the difference between men and women, rather than &quot;gender&quot;, which Scruton called &quot;politically correct&quot;.

===Monarchy===
Scruton was a supporter of constitutional monarchy, arguing it is &quot;the light above politics, which shines down on the human bustle from a calmer and more exalted sphere.&quot; In a 1991 column for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, he argued that monarchy helped create peace in Central Europe and it was &quot;the loss of it that precipitated 70 years of conflict on the Continent.&quot;

===Totalitarianism===
Scruton defined totalitarianism as the absence of any constraint on central authority, with every aspect of life the concern of government. Advocates of totalitarianism feed on resentment, Scruton argues, and having seized power they proceed to abolish institutionssuch as the law, property, and religionthat create authorities: &quot;To the resentful it is these institutions that are the cause of inequality, and therefore the cause of their humiliations and failures.&quot; He argues that revolutions are not conducted from below by the people, but from above, in the name of the people, by an aspiring elite. 

The importance of Newspeak in totalitarian societies, he writes, is that the power of language to describe reality is replaced by language whose purpose is to avoid encounters with realities. He agrees with Alain Besançon that the totalitarian society envisaged by George Orwell in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949) can be only understood in theological terms, as a society founded on a transcendental negation. In accordance with T. S. Eliot, Scruton believes that true originality is only possible within a tradition, and that it is precisely in modern conditionsconditions of fragmentation, heresy, and unbeliefthat the conservative project acquires its sense.

===English independence===
In 2014, Scruton said he supported English independence because he believed it would uphold friendship between England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and because the English would have a say in all matters. In 2019, when asked if he believed in English independence, he told the &quot;New Statesman&quot;:

No, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever really favoured English independence. My view is that if the Scots want to be independent then we should aim for the same thing ... I don&#x27;t think the Welsh want independence, the Northern Irish certainly don&#x27;t. The Scottish desire for independence is, to some extent, a fabrication. They want to identify themselves as Scots but still ... enjoy the subsidy they get from being part of the kingdom. I can see there are Scottish nationalists who envision something more than that, but if that becomes a real political force then yeah, we should try for independence too. As it is, as you know, the Scots have two votes: they can vote for their own parliament and vote to put their people into our parliament, who come to our parliament with no interest in Scotland but an interest in bullying us.

===British sovereignty===
Scruton strongly supported Brexit, because he believed that the European Union is a threat to the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and that Brexit will help retain national identity, which he saw as under threat as a result of mass immigration, and because he opposed the Common Agricultural Policy. He also opposed the metrification of weights and measures and believed it was an &#x27;affront to the British people, its history and its long established patterns of trade&#x27;.

==Awards==

For his work with the Jan Hus Educational Foundation in communist Czechoslovakia, Scruton was awarded the First of June Prize in 1993 by the Czech city of Plzeň. In 1998 Václav Havel, president of the Czech Republic, presented him with the Medal of Merit (First Class). In the UK, he was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for &quot;services to philosophy, teaching and public education&quot;. His family accompanied him to the ceremony, which was performed by Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace. In 2016 the European University of Tirana awarded him with Doctor Honoris Causa.

Polish President Andrzej Duda presented Scruton with the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland in June 2019 &quot;for supporting the democratic transformation in Poland&quot;. In November that year, the Senate of the Czech Parliament awarded him a Silver Medal for his work in support of Czech dissidents. The next month, during a ceremony in London, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán presented him with the Hungarian Order of Merit, Commander&#x27;s Cross with Star.

==Death==
After learning in July 2019 that he had lung cancer, Scruton underwent treatment, including chemotherapy. He died at Cromwell Hospital in London on 12 January 2020, at the age of 75. The next day, Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: &quot;We have lost the greatest modern conservative thinkerwho not only had the guts to say what he thought but said it beautifully.&quot; The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid, referred to Scruton&#x27;s work behind the Iron Curtain: &quot;From his support for freedom fighters in Eastern Europe to his immense intellectual contribution to conservatism in the West, he made a unique contribution to public life.&quot;

Mario Vargas Llosa, a winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, wrote: &quot;[Scruton] was one of the most educated people I have ever met. He could speak of music, literature, archaeology, wine, philosophy, Greece, Rome, the Bible and a thousand subjects more than an expert, although he was not an expert on anything, because, in fact, he was a humanist in the classical style ... Scruton&#x27;s departure leaves a dreadful void around us.&quot;

Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan called Scruton &quot;the greatest conservative of our age&quot;, adding: &quot;The country has lost a towering intellect. I have lost a wonderful friend.&quot; Robert Jenrick, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, said that Scruton&#x27;s work on &quot;building more beautifully, submitted recently to my department, will proceed and stand part of his unusually rich legacy&quot;. The scholar and former politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali described him as a &quot;dear and generous friend, who gave freely to those who sought advice and wisdom, and he expected little in return&quot;. Another friend and colleague, Douglas Murray, paid tribute to Scruton&#x27;s personal kindness, calling him &quot;one of the kindest, most encouraging, thoughtful, and generous people you could ever have known&quot;. Others who paid tribute to Scruton included education reformer Katharine Birbalsingh and cabinet minister Michael Gove, who called Scruton &quot;an intellectual giant, a brilliantly clear and compelling writer&quot;.

In an essay critical of Scruton&#x27;s philosophy of aesthetics, &quot;The Art of Madness and Mystery&quot;, published in &quot;Church Life&quot; (a journal of the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s McGrath Institute) shortly after Scruton&#x27;s death, Michael Shindler wrote that &quot;like the Roman guard who would not abandon his post during the cataclysm of Pompeii, the late Roger Scruton stands in lonesome majesty as the artistic tradition&#x27;s greatest defender athwart modernity&#x27;s aesthetic upheaval.&quot;

Scruton&#x27;s funeral was held on 24 January 2020 at Malmesbury Abbey with the attendance of several peers, Conservative politicians, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. After the ceremony, which was presided by the Reverend Oliver Ross, Scruton&#x27;s remains were buried in Garsdon churchyard.

<text>Minimally invasive education (MIE) is a form of learning in which children operate in unsupervised environments. The methodology arose from an experiment done by Sugata Mitra while at NIIT in 1999, often called &quot;The Hole in the Wall&quot;, which has since gone on to become a significant project with the formation of Hole in the Wall Education Limited (HiWEL), a cooperative effort between NIIT and the International Finance Corporation, employed in some 300 &#x27;learning stations&#x27;, covering some 300,000 children in India and several African countries.

The programme has been feted with the digital opportunity award by WITSA, and been extensively covered in the media.

==History==

===Background===
Professor Mitra, Chief Scientist at NIIT, is credited with proposing and initiating the Hole-in-the-Wall programme. As early as 1982, he had been toying with the idea of unsupervised learning and computers. Finally, in 1999, he decided to test his ideas in the field.

===The experiment===
On 26 January 1999, Mitra&#x27;s team carved a &quot;hole in the wall&quot; that separated the NIIT premises from the adjoining slum in Kalkaji, New Delhi. Through this hole, a freely accessible computer was put up for use. This computer proved to be popular among the slum children. With no prior experience, the children learned to use the computer on their own. This prompted Mitra to propose the following hypothesis: The acquisition of basic computing skills by any set of children can be achieved through incidental learning provided the learners are given access to a suitable computing facility, with entertaining and motivating content and some minimal (human) guidance.

In the following comment on the TED website Mitra explains how they saw to it that the computer in this experiment was accessible to children only:
:: &quot;... We placed the computers 3 feet off the ground and put a shade on top, so if you are tall, you hit your head on it. Then we put a protective plastic cowl over the keyboard which had an opening such that small hands would go in. Then we put a seating rod in front that was close to the wall so that, if you are of adult height, your legs would splay when you sit. Then we painted the whole thing in bright colours and put a sign saying &#x27;for children under 15&#x27;. Those design factors prevented adult access to a very large extent.&quot;

===Results===
Mitra has summarised the results of his experiment as follows. Given free and public access to computers and the Internet, a group of children can
*Become computer literate on their own, that is, they can learn to use computers and the Internet for most of the tasks done by lay users.
*Teach themselves enough English to use email, chat and search engines.
*Learn to search the Internet for answers to questions in a few months time.
*Improve their English pronunciation on their own.
*Improve their mathematics and science scores in school.
*Answer examination questions several years ahead of time.
*Change their social interaction skills and value systems.
*Form independent opinions and detect indoctrination.

==Current status and expansion outside India==
The first adopter of the idea was the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. In 2000, the Government of Delhi set up 30 Learning Stations in a resettlement colony. This project is ongoing and said to be achieving significant results.

Encouraged by the initial success of the Kalkaji experiment, freely accessible computers were set up in Shivpuri (a town in Madhya Pradesh) and in Madantusi (a village in Uttar Pradesh). These experiments came to be known as Hole-in-the-Wall experiments. The findings from Shivpuri and Madantusi confirmed the results of Kalkaji experiments. It appeared that the children in these two places picked up computer skills on their own. Dr. Mitra defined this as a new way of learning &quot;Minimally Invasive Education&quot;.

At this point in time, International Finance Corporation joined hands with NIIT to set up Hole-in-the-Wall Education Ltd (HiWEL). The idea was to broaden the scope of the experiments and conduct research to prove and streamline Hole-in-the-Wall. The results, show that children learn to operate as well as play with the computer with minimum intervention. They picked up skills and tasks by constructing their own learning environment.

Today, more than 300,000 children have benefited from 300 Hole-in-the-Wall stations over last 8 years. In India Suhotra Banerjee (Head-Government Relations) has increased the reach of HiWEL learning stations in Nagaland, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh... and is slowly expanding their numbers.

Besides India, HiWEL also has projects abroad. The first such project was established in Cambodia in 2004. The project currently operates in Botswana, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Swaziland, Uganda, and Zambia, besides Cambodia. The idea, also called Open learning, is even being applied in Britain, albeit inside the classroom.

==HiWEL==
Hole-in-the-Wall Education Ltd. (HiWEL) is a joint venture between NIIT and the International Finance Corporation. Established in 2001, HiWEL was set up to research and propagate the idea of Hole-in-the-Wall, a path-breaking learning methodology created by Mitra, Chief Scientist of NIIT.

==Awards and recognition==
* Digital Opportunity Award by the World Information Technology and Services Alliance (WITSA) in 2008. Reason: &quot;groundbreaking work in developing computer literacy and improving the quality of education at a grass root level.&quot;

==Coverage in the media==
The project has received extensive coverage from sources as diverse as UNESCO, &quot;Business Week&quot;, CNN, Reuters, and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, besides being featured at the annual TED conference in 2007.

The project received international publicity, when it was found that it was the inspiration behind the book &quot;Q &amp; A&quot;, itself the inspiration for the Academy Award winning film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;.

HiWEL has been covered by the Indian &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;6175/1960&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==In school==

Minimally Invasive Education in school adduces there are many reasons why children may have difficulty learning, especially when the learning is imposed and the subject is something the student is not interested in, a frequent occurrence in modern schools. Schools also label children as &quot;learning disabled&quot; and place them in special education even if the child does not have a learning disability, because the schools have failed to teach the children basic skills.

Minimally Invasive Education in school asserts there are many ways to study and learn. It argues that learning is a process you do, not a process that is done to you. The experience of schools holding this approach shows that there are many ways to learn without the intervention of teaching, to say, without the intervention of a teacher being imperative. In the case of reading for instance in these schools some children learn from being read to, memorizing the stories and then ultimately reading them. Others learn from cereal boxes, others from games instructions, others from street signs. Some teach themselves letter sounds, others syllables, others whole words. They adduce that in their schools no one child has ever been forced, pushed, urged, cajoled, or bribed into learning how to read or write, and they have had no dyslexia. None of their graduates are real or functional illiterates, and no one who meets their older students could ever guess the age at which they first learned to read or write.

In a similar form students learn all the subjects, techniques and skills in these schools. Every person, children and youth included, has a different learning style and pace and each person, is unique, not only capable of learning but also capable of succeeding. These schools assert that applying the medical model of problem-solving to individual children who are pupils in the school system, and labeling these children as disabled—referring to a whole generation of non-standard children that have been labeled as dysfunctional, even though they suffer from nothing more than the disease of responding differently in the classroom than the average manageable student—systematically prevents the students&#x27; success and the improvement of the current educational system, thus requiring the prevention of academic failure through intervention. This, they clarify, does not refer to people who have a specific disability that affects their drives; nor is anything they say and write about education meant to apply to people who have specific mental impairments, which may need to be dealt with in special, clinical ways.

Describing current instructional methods as homogenization and lockstep standardization, alternative approaches are proposed, such as the Sudbury model schools, an alternative approach in which children, by enjoying personal freedom thus encouraged to exercise personal responsibility for their actions, learn at their own pace rather than following a chronologically-based curriculum. These schools are organized to allow freedom from adult interference in the daily lives of students. As long as children do no harm to others, they can do whatever they want with their time in school. The adults in other schools plan a curriculum of study, teach the students the material and then test and grade their learning. The adults at Sudbury schools are &quot;the guardians of the children&#x27;s freedom to pursue their own interests and to learn what they wish,&quot; creating and maintaining a nurturing environment, in which children feel that they are cared for, and that does not rob children of their time to explore and discover their inner selves. They also are there to answer questions and to impart specific skills or knowledge when asked to by students. As Sudbury schools, proponents of unschooling have also claimed that children raised in this method do not suffer from learning disabilities, thus not requiring the prevention of academic failure through intervention.

:&quot;If learning is an emergent phenomenon, then the teacher needs to provide stimulus — lots of it – in the form of “big” questions. These must include questions to which the teacher, or perhaps anyone, does not have the answer. These should be the sorts of questions that will occupy children’s minds perpetually. The teacher needs to help each child cultivate a vision of the future. Thus, a new primary curriculum needs to teach only three skills: 1. Reading comprehension: This is perhaps the most crucial skill a child needs to acquire while growing up. 2. Information search and analysis: First articulated at the National Institute of Technology in India by professor J.R. Isaac in the early 1990s — decades ahead of its time — this skill set is vital for children searching for answers in an infinite cyberspace. 3. A rational system of belief: If children know how to search, and if they know how to read, then they must learn how to believe. Each one of us has a belief system. How soon can a child acquire one? A rational belief system will be our children’s protection against doctrine. Children who have these skills scarcely need schools as we define them today. They need a learning environment and a source of rich, big questions. Computers can give out answers, but they cannot, as of yet, make questions. Hence, the teacher’s role becomes bigger and stranger than ever before: She must ask her “learners” about things she does not know herself. Then she can stand back and watch as learning emerges.&quot;

<doc id="1010815" wikidata="Q298909" url="?curid=1010815" title="Radeon R400 series">
<text>The R420 GPU, developed by ATI Technologies, was the company&#x27;s basis for its 3rd-generation DirectX 9.0/OpenGL 2.0-capable graphics cards. Used first on the Radeon X800, the R420 was produced on a 0.13 micrometer (130 nm) low-&quot;K&quot; photolithography process and used GDDR-3 memory. The chip was designed for AGP graphics cards.

Driver support of this core was discontinued as of Catalyst 9.4, and as a result there is no official Windows 7 support for any of the X700 - X850 products.

==Development==

In terms of supported DirectX features, R420 (codenamed Loki) was very similar to the R300. R420 basically takes a &quot;wider is better&quot; approach to the previous architecture, with some small tweaks thrown in to enhance it in various ways. The chip came equipped with over double the pixel and vertex pushing resources compared to the Radeon 9800 XT&#x27;s R360 (a minor evolution of the R350), with 16 DirectX 9.0b pixel pipelines and 16 ROPs. One would not be far off seeing the X800 XT basically as a pair of Radeon 9800 cores connected together and also running with a ~30% higher clock speed. 

The R420 design was a 4 &quot;quad&quot; arrangement (4 pipelines per quad.) This organization internally allowed ATI to disable defective &quot;quads&quot; and sell chips with 12, 8 or even 4 pixel pipelines, an evolution of the technique used with Radeon 9500/9700 and 9800SE/9800. The separation into &quot;quads&quot; also allowed ATI to design a system to optimize the efficiency of the overall chip. Coined the &quot;quad dispatch system&quot;, the screen is tiled and work is spread out evenly among the separate &quot;quads&quot; to optimize their throughput. This is how the R300-series chips performed their tasks as well, but R420 refined this by allowing programmable tile sizes in order to control work flow on a finer level of granularity. Apparently by reducing tile sizes, ATI was able to optimize for different triangle sizes.

When ATI doubled the number of pixel pipelines, they also raised the number of vertex shader engines from 4 to 6. This changed the ratio of pixel/vertex shaders from 2:1 (on R300) to 8:3, showing that ATI believed the workload in games as of 2004 and onward to be more pixel shader and texturing oriented than geometry based. Normal and parallax mapping were replacing sheer geometric complexity for model detail, so undoubtedly that was part of the reasoning. Strangely, the X700 mainstream card (RV410) had 6 vertex shaders while only being equipped with 2 quads. As such, this chip was obviously designed for a heavier geometry load than texturing, perhaps being tailored for a role as a FireGL chip. RV410 also significantly outgunned NVIDIA&#x27;s GeForce 6600GT (3 vertex shaders) on geometry throughput. With R420&#x27;s and RV410&#x27;s 6 vertex shaders combined with higher clock speeds than the previous generation, ATI was able to more than double the geometry processing capability of 9800XT.

Although the R420-based chips are fundamentally similar to R300-based cores, ATI did tweak and enhance the pixel shader units for more flexibility. A new pixel shader version (PS2.b) allowed slightly greater shader program flexibility than plain PS2.0, but was still shy of full PS3.0 capabilities. This new revision to PS2.0 increased the maximum number of instructions and registers available to pixel shader programs.

ATI revealed &quot;Temporal Anti-Aliasing&quot;, a new anti-aliasing technology their chips were capable of. By taking advantage of the frame-to-eye effects of a framerate higher than 60 frame/s, the GPU is able to better smooth aliased edges by rotating the anti-aliasing sampling pattern between frames. A 2X software setting became perceptively equivalent to 4X. Unfortunately, it required the system to be able to maintain at least 60 frame/s or temporal anti-aliasing would cause a noticeable flickering, because the user would be able to see the alternating AA patterns. If the framerate could not be maintained, the driver will disable Temporal AA. However, in games which this performance level could be maintained, Temporal AA was a nice addition to ATI&#x27;s excellent anti-aliasing options. Note, ATI&#x27;s &quot;Temporal AA&quot; was actually a temporal dithering filter for spatial AA, not de facto temporal anti-aliasing (which must involve a controlled blending of the temporal subsamples from consecutive screens).
Another notable addition to the core was a new kind of normal map compression, dubbed &quot;3Dc&quot;. Similar to how texture compression had been part of the Direct3D specification for years and was used for compressing regular textures, normal map compression compacted this new type of surface detail layer. Because DirectX Texture Compression (DXTC) was block-based and not designed for a normal map&#x27;s different data properties, a new compression method was needed to prevent loss of detail and other artifacting. 3Dc was based on a modified DXT5 mode, which in fact was a fallback option for hardware not supporting 3Dc. Software making heavy use of normal mapping could gain a significant speed boost from the savings in fillrate and bandwidth by using 3Dc. ATI showcased many of their chip&#x27;s new features in the promotional real-time demo called, &quot;Ruby: The Doublecross&quot;.

Most of the rest of the GPU was extremely similar to R300. The memory controller and memory bandwidth optimization techniques (HyperZ) were identical.

R420 was actually a secondary 4th generation project for ATI, with the original R400 plan, internally codenamed &quot;Crayola&quot;, being scrapped. R400 would have been more feature-complete, with unified Shader Model 3 shader support among other enhancements, but it is believed that ATI deemed R400 unnecessarily complex for the applications that would be available, and potentially risky to develop on the available semiconductor manufacturing processes of the time. The R400 architecture was thus implemented only in the Xenos chip used in the Xbox 360 video game console, and became the base for the Qualcomm Adreno 200 mobile GPU, initially called the AMD Z430. In the Radeon line, the support for Direct3D 9.0c features moved to the subsequent generation based on the R500 architecture, while the 4th generation was served with the R300-derived R420.

==Releases of the R420 and the next ATI GPU without major architecture modification==

The earliest Radeon X800 series cards were based on the R420 core. The line included the Radeon X800 XT Platinum Edition and the Radeon X800 Pro. The X800 XT PE came clocked at 520 MHz core and 560 MHz RAM, with 16 pipelines enabled. The X800 Pro came clocked at 475/450 MHz with one quad disabled, leaving 12 pixel pipelines functional. Essentially, the X800 Pro is built on semi-defective R420 cores. An X800 Pro VIVO (Video-in-Video-out) was also released and was popular with overclockers because the disabled quad could usually be enabled, resulting in a fully functional X800 XT PE at a lower cost.

The Radeon X700 (RV410) series replaced the X600 in September 2004. X700 Pro is clocked at 425 MHz core, and produced on a 0.11 micrometre process. RV410 used a layout consisting of 8 pixel pipelines connected to 4 ROPs (similar to GeForce 6600) while maintaining the 6 vertex shaders of X800. The 110 nm process was a cost-cutting process, designed not for high clock speeds but for reducing die size while maintaining high yields. An X700 XT was planned for production, and reviewed by various hardware web sites, but was never released. It was believed that X700 XT set too high of a clock ceiling for ATI to profitably produce. X700 XT was also not adequately competitive with nVidia&#x27;s impressive GeForce 6600GT. ATI would go on produce a card in the X800 series to compete instead.
The Radeon X800 &quot;R430&quot;-based 110 nanometer series was introduced at the end of 2004 along with ATI&#x27;s new X850 cards. The X800 was designed to replace the position X700 XT failed to secure, with 12 pipelines and a 256-bit RAM bus. The card more than surpassed the 6600GT with performance similar to that of the GeForce 6800. A close relative, the new X800 XL, was positioned to dethrone NVIDIA&#x27;s GeForce 6800 GT with higher memory speeds and a full 16 pipelines to boost performance. R430 was unable to reach high clock speeds, being mainly designed to reduce the cost per GPU, and so a new top-of-the-line core was still needed. The new high-end R4x0-generation arrived with the X850 series, equipped with various core tweaks for slightly higher performance than the &quot;R420&quot;-based X800 series. The &quot;R480&quot;-based X850 line was available in 3 forms: the X850 Pro, the X850 XT, and the X850 XT Platinum Edition, and was built on the reliable high-performance 130 nm Low-K process.

In 2005, ATI had a large number of dies that &quot;worked&quot; but not well enough to be used on the X800 or X850 series cards. So a new SKU was created, the X800 GT. It used any &quot;R480&quot; X850 die or &quot;R430&quot; X800 XL die that had 2 functional quads and could run at 475 MHz. They were meant to compete with the GeForce 6600GT beside the previous &quot;R430&quot;-based X800. ATI also released the X800 GTO, which was a 12 pipeline card (3 quads) using either &quot;R480&quot; or &quot;R430&quot; dies clocked at 400 MHz. This card performed between the X800 GT and the X800 XL. It was faster than the plain GeForce 6800, but slower than GeForce 6800 GT. High sales for this card were due to its relatively high performance coupled with a cost only slightly higher than the X800 GT. The overclocking community discovered that the R480-based GTO could frequently reach clock speeds near the X850 XT. 

Finally, another SKU was the X800 GTO², again based on R480. It was again manufactured by Sapphire Technology, like the X800 GTO. This card usually came with a 3 quad configuration, like X800 GTO. The GTO² was unique in the GTx series because, with a BIOS change, they could almost always be turned into a full 4 quad card. Some X800 GTO² cards shipped with the full 4 quads already enabled, but of these some were R430 instead of R480 and weren&#x27;t able to reach X850-like clock speeds. The final variations of the GTO series were the special GTO boards with 16 pipelines officially enabled, such as Powercolor&#x27;s &quot;R430&quot;-based X800 GTO-16.

<doc id="1010819" wikidata="Q6144178" url="?curid=1010819" title="Super Chief">
<text>The Super Chief was one of the named passenger trains and the flagship of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The then-modern streamliner was touted in its heyday as &quot;The Train of the Stars&quot; because it often carried celebrities between Chicago, Illinois, and Los Angeles, California.

The &quot;Super Chief&quot; (Nos. 17 and 18) was the first diesel-electric powered cross-country passenger train in America. The train eclipsed the &quot;Chief&quot; as Santa Fe&#x27;s standard bearer. The extra-fare ($10) &quot;Super Chief&quot; left Dearborn Station in Chicago for its first trip on May 12, 1936. Before starting scheduled service in May 1937, the lightweight version of the &quot;Super Chief&quot; ran from Los Angeles over recently upgraded tracks in 36 hours and 49 minutes, averaging overall and reaching .

With one set of equipment, the train initially operated once a week from both Chicago and Los Angeles. After more passenger cars were delivered in 1938, the &quot;Super Chief&quot; ran twice weekly that year, and later (from 1948) trips were again increased, to offer daily service. Adding to the train&#x27;s mystique were its gourmet meals and Hollywood clientele.

Competitors to the &quot;Super Chief&quot; were the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; trains on the Chicago and North Western Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad, and (to a lesser extent) the &quot;Golden State&quot; on the Rock Island and Southern Pacific lines. The Santa Fe &quot;Super Chief&quot; was one of the last passenger trains in the United States to carry an all-Pullman consist; only the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; and the Illinois Central&#x27;s &quot;Panama Limited&quot; outlasted it. The &quot;Super Chief&quot; maintained its high level of service until Santa Fe ceased all passenger operations on May 1, 1971.

When Amtrak took over operation of the nation&#x27;s passenger rail service on May 1, 1971, it retained the &quot;Super Chief.&quot; In 1974, due to a publicly perceived decline in quality of passenger service, the Santa Fe Railway withdrew permission to use the &quot;Chief&quot; trade name, so Amtrak renamed the train the &quot;Southwest Limited&quot;. In 1984, after new Superliner equipment had replaced the aging original rolling stock, Santa Fe allowed Amtrak to rename its train to the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;.

==Route==

Santa Fe&#x27;s marketing advantage for the &quot;Super Chief&quot; lay in the geography of the route as well as its ownership. The Santa Fe began as a rail line along the old Santa Fe and Spanish Trails, from the confluence of the Missouri and Kansas rivers (at Atchison and Topeka, Kansas) to the Pecos River and Rio Grande in New Mexico. This initial route was eventually extended to Los Angeles.

The convenience of traveling &quot;Santa Fe All the Way&quot; was superior to anything that the competing jointly operated railroads could provide on their routes to the west coast. A single traffic and operating department managed all the divisions and districts of the Santa Fe route from Chicago to Los Angeles. Dining cars, the commissary supply chains, the on-board service crews and their management; all worked together from Chicago to Los Angeles.

The &quot;Super Chief&quot; ran through Kansas City, Missouri; Newton, Kansas; Dodge City, Kansas; La Junta, Colorado; Raton, New Mexico; Las Vegas, New Mexico; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Gallup, New Mexico; Winslow, Arizona; Seligman, Arizona; Needles, California; Barstow, California; San Bernardino, California; and Pasadena, California. During the pre-war years the &quot;Super Chief&quot; did not allow passengers to board or disembark at any point between Kansas City and Barstow; intermediate stops were operating stops only, to change crews or to service the train. During the war the rules were relaxed to carry passengers to and from Albuquerque and La Junta, but only when unsold space was available at train time. Not until the postwar era could passengers travel to intermediate stations on the &quot;Super Chief&quot;.

==History==
The Santa Fe intended the &quot;Super Chief&quot; to be the latest in a long line of luxury Chicago–Los Angeles trains wedded to the latest in railroad technology. In the 1930s, these included air conditioning, lightweight all-metal construction, and diesel locomotion. In August 1935, the General Motors Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC) delivered two blunt-nosed diesel-electric units Nos. 1 and 1A, intended to pull the &quot;Super Chief&quot;. Aside from an ALCO HH600 switcher at Dearborn Station in Chicago, they were the Santa Fe&#x27;s first diesel-electrics and the first such trains intended for passenger service. The locomotives made their first test run with a set of Pullman cars and a dynamometer car in September 1935. The first &quot;Super Chief&quot; operated on May 12, 1936, with the diesels pulling air-conditioned heavyweight Pullman cars. 
They were put into regular service on May 18, 1937.

In 1937, Santa Fe purchased several of Electro-Motive’s new &quot;Streamliner Series&quot; diesel-electric locomotives and placed them in service on the &quot;Super Chief&quot; line. These locomotives were the first to wear Santa Fe’s red, yellow, and silver &quot;War bonnet&quot; color scheme. EMC’s sleek and efficient streamlined locomotives became the standard on North American railroads. Hollywood celebrities frequently rode the fashionable &quot;Super Chief&quot;, making it known as &quot;The Train of The Stars&quot;.

===Transcontinental sleeping cars===
By January 1954, the &quot;Super Chief&quot; had inherited from the Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;Chief&quot; the service of running continuous Los Angeles-New York sleepers continuing from Chicago on the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; and on the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Limited.&quot; The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad offered a similar service with Los Angeles-Washington, D.C., sleepers on that company&#x27;s &quot;Shenandoah&quot; westbound and &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; eastbound. However, in October 1957 the PRR dropped its &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; sleeper connection. Upon the April 1958 timetables, the cooperating railroads terminated their transcontinental sleeper operations. Declining ridership and delay from switching sleeping cars between Chicago terminals were factors in the through-car termination.

=== Timeline ===

* May 10, 1937: The last of four &quot;preview&quot; runs of the &quot;Super Chief-2&quot;, with an improved 3,600 hp (2.7 MW), two-unit, streamlined diesel locomotive set built by Electro Motive Corporation (EMC), concludes as the train pulls into Los Angeles. All heavyweight cars used on the &quot;Super Chief&quot; are replaced with lightweight stainless-steel cars. The public is invited to tour the new train at Santa Fe&#x27;s La Grande Station on May 11 and 12.
* May 15, 1937: The &quot;Super Chief&quot; departs Los Angeles at 7:30 p.m. PST. The train reaches Chicago in 36 hours and 49 minutes, setting a record. Both new E1 units suffered mechanical damage during the trip and were taken out of service for repairs.
* May 18, 1937: The lightweight &quot;Super Chief&quot; starts its first regular run, led by Unit 1A and EMC demonstrator Unit 512 (a.k.a. AT&amp;SF Unit 1C) from Chicago&#x27;s Dearborn Station. The passenger list includes ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his &quot;sidekick&quot; Charlie McCarthy. (The first pair of E1s were delivered in June.)
* June 15, 1937: The &quot;Super Chief&quot; makes its first regular run with EMC E1s 2A and 2B, the first locomotives to wear the famous red, yellow and silver &quot;Warbonnet&quot; scheme.
* January 1938: E1 Units 3 and 3A are placed in service on the &quot;Super Chief&quot;.
* February 26, 1938: Due to production delays, a &quot;borrowed&quot; six-car &quot;Chief&quot; consist begins running as the &quot;Super Chief&quot; to allow twice-weekly trips.
* July 2, 1938: Lightweight cars built by Pullman-Standard replace the Chief cars. Until 1946 each trainset makes a weekly round trip between Chicago and Los Angeles, averaging per day.
* 1941: The Santa Fe takes delivery of its only 2,000 hp (1.5 MW) ALCO DL-107/108 model locomotives, units 50 and 50A.
* July 7, 1942: The &quot;Super Chief&quot; goes on a wartime schedule of 41 hours, 45 minutes. Consist expands to 12 cars.
* June 2, 1946: The train reverts to its prewar schedule of 39 hours and 45 minutes.
* September 29, 1946: &quot;Super Chief&quot; begins running every other day, departing Los Angeles and Chicago on even-numbered days. With the &quot;El Capitan&quot; departing on odd-numbered days (except the 31st), the two trains form what the Santa Fe bills as &quot;the first and only daily hour service between Chicago and California.&quot;
* February 29, 1948: AT&amp;SF receives its first post-War order from Pullman-Standard and places these into service on the &quot;Super Chief&quot;. The railroad now has five &quot;Super Chief&quot; trainsets, enough to operate daily.
* December 29, 1949: Train No. 17, led by locomotive set #37L/A/B/C, collides with a tanker truck in Azusa, California. All four locomotives, baggage car #3409, and railway post office #88 are damaged by fire.
* 1950–1951: The &quot;Super Chief&quot; is reequipped with new streamlined sleeping cars built by the Budd Company and the American Car and Foundry Company (ACF), and dining cars from Pullman-Standard. Santa Fe also adds the Pullman-built &quot;Pleasure Dome&quot;-Lounge car (one of the most luxurious ever made for any train) to its &quot;Super Chief&quot; consists, billing it as the &quot;...only dome car between Chicago and Los Angeles.&quot; A speedometer in the front of the car showed the train&#x27;s velocity.
* June 1952: The &quot;Super Chief&quot; is featured in the Warner Bros. film &quot;Three for Bedroom &quot;C&quot;&quot; starring Gloria Swanson.
* 1954: The General Tire and Rubber Company uses the &quot;Super Chief&quot; as the centerpiece of a print advertisement for its new &quot;Nygen Cord&quot; tire, in which the train is towed by an AT&amp;SF switcher using one of the tires as a connecting link.
* January 10, 1954: The $15.00 extra-fare is reduced to $7.50; the barbershop and shower-bath are discontinued. The &quot;Super Chief&quot; begins rolling the coast-to-coast Pullmans (which go through to New York City on the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; or the New York Central&#x27;s &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; route; east from Washington, it runs on the &quot;Shenandoah&quot; line westbound to Washington it runs on the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot;) route; transcontinental sleepers had formerly been carried by the &quot;Chief&quot;.
* 1956: Round-back observation cars are removed from the &quot;Super Chief&quot;, converted to blunt-back cars at Pullman&#x27;s Calumet, Illinois shops and are returned to train Nos. 17 and 18. In early 1958 they are permanently removed from service.
* October 1957: The Pennsylvania Railroad discontinues its sleeping car connection.
* January 12, 1958: The &quot;Super Chief&quot; and &quot;El Capitan&quot; are combined during the off-peak season on a 39-hour schedule.
* April 1958: The continuous Los Angeles-east coast sleeper carriages in cooperation with the New York Central and Baltimore and Ohio are terminated.
* 1958: The five &quot;Super Chief&quot; trainsets are refurbished and redecorated.

On May 1, 1971, Amtrak took over operation of intercity passenger rail service in the United States. Amtrak retained the &quot;Super Chief&quot;/&quot;El Capitan&quot; names with Santa Fe&#x27;s permission. From June 11 to September 10, 1972, Amtrak operated the &quot;Chief&quot;, a second Chicago–Los Angeles train along the same route. This was the only occasion on which Amtrak ran a second train to duplicate a long-distance service along its entire route outside the New York–Florida corridor. Amtrak dropped the &quot;El Capitan&quot; designation on April 19, 1973. On March 7, 1974, the Santa Fe directed Amtrak to stop using the &quot;Super Chief&quot; and &quot;Texas Chief&quot; names due to a perceived reduction in the quality of service. The trains were renamed &quot;Southwest Limited&quot; and &quot;Lone Star&quot; on May 19. On November 30, 1980, Amtrak replaced the ex-&quot;Super Chief&quot; &quot;Pleasure Dome&quot; and &quot;Hi-Level&quot; cars on the &quot;Southwest Limited&quot; with new Superliners.

==Equipment used==
The first motive power set on &quot;Super Chief-1&quot; consisted of a pair of blunt-nosed, Diesel-electric units (EMC 1800 hp B-B) designated as Nos. 1 and 1A. Santa Fe employees hung the nicknames &quot;One-Spot Twins&quot; and &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; (from the popular radio show of the day) on the units, which were always paired and ran back-to-back. In a little over a year the EMC E1, a new 3,600 hp (2.7 MW) streamlined Diesel-electric set (one 1800 hp hood unit and the other a cab-less booster unit, also 1800 hp) would be pulling the &quot;Super Chief&quot;.

A variety of locomotives (including ALCO PAs, EMD E6s, FTs, F3s, F7s, and FP45s, along with Santa Fe&#x27;s only ALCO DL-107/108s and FM Erie-built units) would make their appearances over the years. All wore the &quot;Warbonnet&quot; paint scheme devised by Leland Knickerbocker of the GM &quot;Art and Color Section&quot; that debuted on the &quot;Super Chief-2&quot;. Steam locomotives including No. 3751 and 2926 were not uncommon for relief power in the event of the diesels experiencing problems or being unavailable.

==&quot;Hollywood mystique&quot;==
The &quot;Super Chief&quot; was a near-instant success among travelers who appreciated its modern, air-conditioned cars, private bedrooms, high amenity levels, and smooth ride. The train was staffed with top-of-the-line crews ingrained with the best traditions of the railroad and drew passengers not only from other railroads but from other Santa Fe trains such as the &quot;Chief&quot;.

The &quot;Super Chief&quot; quickly became &quot;the&quot; train to ride between Chicago and Los Angeles, much as New York Central&#x27;s &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; was the favored travel option of the time for the East Coast-bound. To acquaint passengers with the various points of interest located along the route, Santa Fe built seven signs marking such notable features as the Continental Divide and Raton Pass.

In the mid-1940s, company president Fred G. Gurley went to great lengths to solicit business from California&#x27;s motion picture industry. A passenger agent was located in Hollywood specifically for the purpose of maintaining close contact with the movie studios. The train stopped at Pasadena to allow celebrities to board away from the &quot;hustle and bustle&quot; of Los Angeles&#x27; Union Passenger Terminal (LAUPT). When the Santa Fe was notified that a particular celebrity was going to be traveling on the &quot;Super Chief&quot;, a press release was issued to allow the media to interview and photograph the star.

Legendary jazz pianist Fats Waller died of pneumonia at the age of 39 on board the &quot;Super Chief&quot; on December 15, 1943.

In time, the passenger list would include many Hollywood stars, such as Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, James Cagney, Judy Garland and Bing Crosby. The train&#x27;s appeal was not limited to those in the entertainment industry, as it also played host to former presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, and their wives.

Several radio and TV episodes of the &quot;Jack Benny Show&quot; had plotlines involving the cast travelling on the &quot;Super Chief&quot;. In one, a tout at Los Angeles Union Station tried to convince Jack to take the &quot;El Capitan&quot; instead.

===&quot;Three for Bedroom &quot;C&quot;&quot;===
In June 1952, Warner Bros. Pictures released &quot;Three for Bedroom &quot;C&quot;&quot;, a romantic comedy starring Gloria Swanson, James Warren, Fred Clark, Hans Conried, and Steve Brodie. In the film, an aging movie star (Swanson) hides out in a compartment during a cross-country journey from New York to Los Angeles aboard the &quot;Super Chief&quot;.

Swanson&#x27;s first color film was one of very few to be shot entirely aboard actual railroad equipment. Santa Fe transported cars from the &quot;Super Chief&quot; to the production company&#x27;s studio lot for filming. The film met with lukewarm reviews and was not a financial success, but did showcase the features of the &quot;Super Chief&quot;.

==Dining==
Most railroads began offering some form of meal service on their trains as an alternate to the poor fare typically found at trackside establishments even before the completion of the first transcontinental railroad. , save for those of the Santa Fe, who relied on America&#x27;s first interstate network of restaurants to feed its passengers en route. The &quot;Harvey Houses&quot;, located strategically along the line, served top-quality meals to railroad patrons during water stops and other planned layovers and were favored over in-transit facilities for all trains operating west of Kansas City.

The &quot;Super Chief&quot; included dining cars, staffed by Fred Harvey Company personnel, as part of its standard consist of the outset. In general, the &quot;Super Chief&quot; operated 36-seat dining cars, although most of them were convertible to 48-seat dining cars with a flip-top (or change of) table and addition of chairs. Dining cars almost always operated with a lounge car coupled to them for bar-lounge service and a waiting area when the dining car was full. Unlike the Union Pacific &quot;City&quot; trains, the &quot;Super Chief&quot; and other Santa Fe trains did not use the &quot;twin-unit&quot; dining cars. Santa Fe, in general, ran somewhat shorter trains that could be serviced with a single dining car (although the heavyweight trains frequently operated in several sections, the streamlined trains generally did not). The height of &quot;Super Chief&quot; lounge and dining facilities came in 1951 with the new 600-series Dining Cars bracketed by the 500 series Pleasure Domes in front and a bar-lounge-dormitory unit in back (moved from the front of the trains). The train still operated with the Vista-series 4 Drawing Room, 1 double bedroom observation cars on the rear, albeit without any bar or buffet service.

The bar-lounge cars next to the diner always included dormitory space for the train crew (a staff of 3–4 cooks and 6–7 waiters) required for the two-night-and-one-day trip. The eight Pullmans on the train had a capacity of 150–200 passengers when full but often ran with single-occupancy rooms, making the passenger load less.
When Santa Fe rolled out its new &quot;Pleasure Dome&quot;-Lounge cars in 1951, the railroad introduced the Turquoise Room, promoted as &quot;The only private dining room in the world on rails&quot;. The room accommodated 12 guests and could be reserved anytime for private dinner or cocktail parties. The room was often used by celebrities and dignitaries. As was the case on other railroads, dining car service was a losing proposition financially. Santa Fe, more than any of its competitors, took the concept of using on-board meal service as a loss leader to the highest level to attract and retain customers. The name &quot;Super Chief&quot; became synonymous with the finest fare available on wheels.

===Menu===
The Continental cuisine offered aboard the &quot;Super Chief&quot; went beyond the American fare on other trains and often rivaled that served in many five-star restaurants. A &quot;Wake-Up Cup&quot; of coffee was brought to one&#x27;s private bedroom each morning, on request, a service exclusive to the &quot;Super Chief&quot;. Breakfast and lunch were served &quot;à la carte&quot;, while dinner could be ordered either &quot;à la carte&quot; or &quot;table d&#x27;hôte&quot;.

The elaborate dinner offerings generally included caviar and other delicacies, cold salads, grilled and sautéed fish, sirloin steaks and filet mignon, lamb chops, and the like. For discerning palates, elegant champagne dinners were an option. One of the &quot;Super Chief&quot;&#x27;s most popular signature dishes was the AT&amp;SF version of &quot;pain perdu&quot;, simply and appropriately named &quot;Santa Fe French Toast&quot;.

===Mimbreño china===
The decor, linens, and other dining car accoutrements reflected the same Southwestern flair prevalent throughout the train. Mary Colter, architect, Indian art expert, and 35-year veteran of the Fred Harvey Company, designed the china and silverware used on the &quot;Super Chief&quot;. Colter, who also designed the interiors of Fred Harvey&#x27;s opulent &quot;La Fonda&quot;, &quot;La Posada&quot;, and &quot;El Tovar&quot; hotels, based her dinnerware motif on the Native American pictographs of animals and geometric patterns left behind on clay pots by the ancient inhabitants of the Rio Mimbres Valley in southwestern New Mexico around 1100 AD. Colter drew specific inspiration from the 700 pen-and-ink drawings of Mimbres pottery recorded by archeologist Harriet Cosgrove from 1924 to 1927 while excavating the Swarts Ruin in New Mexico with her husband Cornelius Cosgrove. Publication of the Swarts Ruin record created a sensation in 1932.

The &quot;Mimbreño&quot; pattern was produced between 1936 and 1970 by the Onondaga Pottery Co. of Syracuse, New York, under its better-known trade name, Syracuse China. The bottoms carried the inscription &quot;Made expressly for Santa Fe Dining Car Service.&quot; These distinctive pieces made their debut on the dining car &quot;Cochiti&quot; in 1937. Used on the &quot;Super Chief&quot; and other named trains until the end of Santa Fe passenger service in 1971, some original Mimbreño dinnerware can still be found today in service on BNSF Railway business cars.

Mimbreño has been dubbed &quot;the oldest of all railroad china&quot; as its design concept dates back nearly ten centuries. Demand for surviving original pieces has created a collector&#x27;s market and led to the issuance of authorized reproductions in recent years.

<doc id="1010827" wikidata="Q2302857" url="?curid=1010827" title="9/11 Commission Report">
<text>The 9/11 Commission Report, officially the Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, is the official report into the events leading up to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It was prepared by the 9/11 Commission, chaired by former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean, at the request of U.S. president George W. Bush and Congress.

The commission was established on November 27, 2002, 442 days after the September 11 attacks. The report, which is 585 pages in length, was originally scheduled for release on May 27, 2004, but Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert approved the commission&#x27;s request for a sixty-day extension through July 26. The report was released on July 22, 2004, immediately to the public, and remains available for sale or free download.

==Findings==
The 9/11 Commission interviewed over 1,200 people in 10 countries and reviewed over two and a half million pages of documents, including some closely guarded classified national security documents. The commission also relied heavily on the FBI&#x27;s PENTTBOM investigation. Before it was released by the commission, the final public report was screened for any potentially classified information and edited as needed.

After releasing the report, commission chair Thomas Kean declared that both presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were &quot;not well served&quot; by the FBI and CIA.

In addition to identifying intelligence failures occurring before the attacks, the report provided evidence of the following:

* Airport security footage of the hijackers as they passed through airport security;
* Excerpts from the United Airlines Flight 93 cockpit voice recording, which recorded the sounds of the hijackers in the cockpit and the passengers&#x27; attempts to regain control; and 
* Eyewitness testimony of passengers as they described their own final moments to family members and authorities on airphones and cellphones from the cabins of doomed airliners.

The commission also concluded 15 of the 19 hijackers who carried out the attacks were from Saudi Arabia, but the commission &quot;found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization&quot; to conspire in the attacks, or that it funded the attackers even though the report identifies that &quot;Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of al-Qaeda funding&quot;. Mohamed Atta, the leader of the attacks, was from Egypt. Two hijackers were from the United Arab Emirates, and one was from Lebanon. According to the commission, all 19 hijackers were members of the al-Qaeda terrorist organization, led by Osama bin Laden. In addition, while meetings between al-Qaeda representatives and Iraqi government officials had taken place, the panel had no credible evidence that Saddam Hussein had assisted al-Qaeda in preparing or executing the 9/11 attacks.

The commission&#x27;s final report also offered new evidence of increased contact between Iran and al-Qaeda. The report contains information about how &quot;at least eight&quot; of the 9/11 hijackers passed through Iran, and indicates that officials in Iran did not place entry stamps in their passports. However, according to the report (Chapter 7), there is no evidence that Iran was aware of the actual 9/11 plot.

The commission report chose to place blame for failure to notify the military squarely upon the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Ben Sliney, FAA operations manager at Herndon, Virginia, and Monte Belger, FAA acting deputy administrator on 9/11, both stated to the commission that military liaisons were present and participating in Herndon&#x27;s response as the events of 9/11 unfolded. Sliney stated that everyone who needed to be notified, including the military, was.

In addition to its findings, the report made extensive recommendations for changes that can be made to help prevent a similar attack. These include the creation of a National Intelligence Director over both the CIA and the FBI, and many changes in border security and immigration policy.

===Public diplomacy and War on Terror===

The &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot; stated that &quot;long-term success demands the use of all the elements of national power: diplomacy, intelligence, covert action, law enforcement, economic policy, foreign aid, public diplomacy, and homeland defense.&quot; Quantitative numbers alone would not defeat the terrorists and insurgents, the report stated. The objectives of defeating the enemy needed to be specific enough so that the public could determine whether the goals were being met. The 9/11 Commission Report emphasized that in order to defeat an insurgency, one needed to promote a stronger ideology, value system, and security environment, than the opposition. The 9/11 Commission also emphasized the use of public diplomacy. Furthermore, the report stated that defeating insurgents and terrorists &quot;is not based on traditional war tactics, but encompasses a national strategic effort that employs all elements of national power.&quot;

In 2003, the U.S. government began to prioritize political and cultural support for the counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan. An Afghan regional official claimed that Afghanistan was on the right track for a stable government and begged the United States not to leave the theater, claiming that Afghanistan would lose progress if the U.S. withdrew their political support and local outreach to the public.

According to the 9/11 Commission, conducting public diplomacy with the local population of Afghanistan was necessary for long-term success within the country. The report stated that, &quot;A former under secretary of the state for public diplomacy and both chairmen of the 9/11 Commission expressed the view that public diplomacy tools are at least as important in the war on terrorism as military tools and should be given equal state and increased funding.&quot;

The 9/11 Commission stated that the United States envisioned an eventual Afghan government that was able to build a national army, coordinate infrastructure, and coordinate public services in major provinces throughout the country. The 9/11 Commission also suggested an increased effort in the U.S. State Department and the international community to &quot;become involved with the rule of law and to contain the rampant crime and narcotics trafficking in the area.&quot; However, in order to carry out these long-term goals the U.S. should rely on civilian-military teams to reach out to the local population and listen to their concerns and implement them with the Afghan government effectively, the report stated.

At the time of the release of &quot;The 9/11 Commission Report&quot;, there was a strong realization that negative public opinion about the U.S. could directly relate to how friendly countries in the Middle East would be in the war on terror, mainly in Afghanistan. At the time, American involvement in the Middle East had not been accepted well; support for the United States had plummeted. The 9/11 Commission showed that favorable ratings for the United States had fallen from 61 to 15 percent in Indonesia and from 71 to 38 percent among Muslims in Nigeria. It also stated that many disgruntled views about the U.S. developed from uninformed minds about America and that they were distorted by cartoon ideologies. Local newspapers in Middle Eastern countries that reinforced the Jihadist theme, portraying the U.S. as anti-Muslim, &quot;influenced these fragile views&quot;, the reports stressed. These ideas needed to be effectively countered in order to win the U.S. counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan and the ideological war against Muslim extremism.

The commission claimed that it was possible, through the use of public diplomacy, to drive a wedge between moderate Muslims and the violent terrorists or insurgents. It also stressed the need for the United States to stand for a better future and act as a role model to the local population in Afghanistan and to the Muslim community. The U.S. needed to take the moral leadership role in Afghanistan and throughout the world. For parents, insurgents in Afghanistan could only offer their children violence and death, the commission claimed. The U.S. should utilize public diplomacy to counter the insurgent ideology.

The 9/11 Commission also claimed that American values and ideals were something that the Muslim population could connect to, agree with, and feel secure with. The commission advised that the U.S. stands up for its values and ideals to prevent the insurgents from distorting the ideology of liberty to persuade the Muslim world into the insurgent or terrorist ideology. Only through use of public diplomacy could the U.S. counter these political and ideological distortions, the commission claimed. And thus explaining and making clear the U.S. stance on morality, freedom, and liberty to the local populations in the Middle East would allow the U.S. to promote the American counterinsurgency effort in Afghanistan.

The 9/11 Commission also elaborated on the example of humane treatment of prisoners of war, stating that the U.S. and its allies needed to project a higher image of morality by the civil and humane treatment of terrorists that were captured to the local populations of countries like Afghanistan, . Accusations that the U.S. abused its prisoners made it more difficult to win political, social, and diplomatic relations in its civilian-military operations in Afghanistan. Without careful prevention of derogatory use of information by the enemy, the United States would become a victim of the enemy&#x27;s use of public diplomacy in war, the report stated.

The 9/11 Commission believed that public diplomacy should be viewed as a dialogue with Arab populations, to enable a greater understanding between cultures and societies and to build those long-term relationships and trust that was needed to be successful at counterinsurgency warfare. &quot;If we don&#x27;t have long-term relationships with Muslim populations, we cannot have trust. Without trust, public diplomacy is ineffective.&quot;

==Criticism==

In a 2004 article titled, &quot;Whitewash as Public Service: How The 9/11 Commission Report defrauds the nation&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; writer Benjamin DeMott wrote:

Other sources have criticized the commission for not digging deep enough to get to the core of the issues. In a 2004 interview with Bernard Gwertzman of the Council on Foreign Relations, Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said:

FAA counterterrorism expert Bogdan Dzakovic believes that the security failures at airports that allowed the hijackers to board the planes were not due to the failures in the system that the report identified. Furthermore, he stated that &quot;Many of the FAA bureaucrats that actively thwarted improvements in security prior to 9/11 have been promoted by FAA or the Transportation Security Administration.&quot; The report did not mention his name, despite Dzakovic giving the following testimony to the commission regarding his undercover checks on airport security prior to 9/11:

The report has been accused of not giving the whole story about the warnings the U.S. received prior to the attacks. While the report did describe that &quot;the system was blinking red&quot; and that an al-Qaeda attack was imminent, it did not include the testimony of former CIA director George Tenet to the commission in January 2004, in which he claimed to have given a specific warning to the Administration in a July 2001 meeting with Condoleezza Rice. Commission members Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton stated that they had not been told about the meeting. But the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported that &quot;it turns out that the panel was, in fact, told about the meeting, according to the interview transcript and Democratic commission member Richard Ben-Veniste, who sat in on the interview with Tenet.&quot;

In July 2024, over 200 exhibits were unsealed in federal court, including a video filmed by Saudi intelligence service operative Omar al-Bayoumi in 1999. Bayoumi, whom the FBI linked to two 9/11 hijackers, was pointing out the locations of several Washington D.C. landmarks like the U.S. Capitol. Brett Eagleson, president of 9/11 Justice, said on CNN that the 9/11 Commission had not seen this video when it concluded that the Saudi government had not been involved in planning the attacks. Eagleson said his organization therefore considered the 9/11 Commission report &quot;null and void.&quot;

==Literary praise==
The &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot; garnered praise in some quarters for its literary qualities. In 2004, Richard Posner, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised it as &quot;uncommonly lucid, even riveting&quot; and called it &quot;an improbable literary triumph.&quot; The report rose to the top of several bestseller lists, and became one of the best-selling government reports of all time. Also in 2004, the National Book Foundation named the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot; a finalist in its National Book Awards&#x27; non-fiction category.

==Translations==
, father of September 11 victim , translated the report into Japanese, with the title &quot;9/11レポート: 2001年米国同時多発テロ調査委員会報告書&quot;. Sumiyama took about ten years to create his translation. It was published by Korocolor Publishers (出版社ころから), which then used a crowdfunding program to recoup the costs of the translation.

==Adaptations==
In 2006, &quot;The 9/11 Commission Report&quot;, a straight to DVD movie, was released by The Asylum. It is based on the findings of the original 9/11 Commission Reports, although it does fictionalize some elements. The report inspired a controversial television miniseries, &quot;The Path to 9/11&quot;. Dramatizing many specific scenes in the report, it is a synthesis of multiple (and in some cases partisan) sources in addition to the report itself. &quot;The 9/11 Report: A Graphic Adaptation&quot; (), by Sid Jacobson and Ernie Colón, and published by Hill &amp; Wang, is an abridged graphic novel adaptation of the report. &quot;On Native Soil&quot; is a documentary of the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot; narrated by Kevin Costner and Hilary Swank. In 2006, director Paul Greengrass adapted portions of the 9/11 Commission Report chronicling the events of United Airlines Flight 93 into the two-time Academy Award-nominated film &quot;United 93&quot;. Select testimonies of the report were adapted as a flash-forward storytelling device in Hulu&#x27;s 2018 mini-series &quot;The Looming Tower&quot;.

<doc id="1010829" wikidata="Q637568" url="?curid=1010829" title="Harada Sanosuke">
<text>was a Japanese warrior (&quot;samurai&quot;) who lived in the late Edo period. He was the 10th unit captain of the Shinsengumi, and died during the Boshin War.

==Background==
Harada was born to a family of &quot;chūgen&quot;, or low-ranking quasi-samurai, who served the retainers of the Iyo-Matsuyama Domain (now the city of Matsuyama). He trained in the spear technique of the &quot;Hōzōin-ryū&quot; style, and usually used that weapon in battle instead of a sword. During his time in Matsuyama, he was once ridiculed by a Matsuyama retainer as being a peon who was unfamiliar with how to properly commit seppuku. Harada, wishing to prove the man wrong, immediately drew his sword and attempted to commit seppuku; however, the wound was shallow, and he survived. Harada later boasted of his scar to his fellow Shinsengumi men, and the incident of his near-disembowelment is said to be the origin of the family crest he chose, which depicted a horizontal line, the &quot;kanji&quot; for one, within a circle (). Later leaving the Matsuyama domain&#x27;s service, he went to Edo, and trained at Kondō Isami&#x27;s Shieikan &quot;dōjō&quot;.

==Shinsengumi period==
In 1863, Harada, together with Kondō and others associated with the Shieikan, joined Kiyokawa Hachirō&#x27;s Rōshigumi and departed for Kyoto. Shortly after reaching Kyoto, the Rōshigumi was disbanded and most of its members returned to Edo. Harada, Kondō, Serizawa Kamo and several others remained behind and formed the core of the group known as Mibu Rōshigumi, which later became the Shinsengumi.

Later, Harada became the Captain of the Shinsengumi tenth Unit. He was trained briefly under a dojo run by Tani Sanjūrō, whom he introduced into the Shinsengumi. In 1865, Tani became the seventh Unit Captain. In Kyoto, Harada married a local woman named , and briefly had a private family residence near the Shinsengumi headquarters at Nishi-Honganji. The couple had a son, whom Harada named , taking the second character from the shōgun &#x27;s name. Harada was very trusted by vice-commander Hijikata. He was involved in many of the crucial missions the group faced and was very likely involved in the Serizawa Kamo (original commander of the Shinsengumi) assassination. He was involved in the Uchiyama Hikojirō&#x27;s assassination, the Ikedaya incident, and the Sanjo Seisatsu incident.

Harada became a hatamoto, together with the rest of Shinsengumi, in June 1867. At one time he was accused (by former Shinsengumi member Itō Kashitarō) as one of the assassins of the Sakamoto Ryōma and Nakaoka Shintarō who were murdered on December 10, 1867. The truth behind the incident remains unclear, but according to the confession of the Tokugawa retainer Imai Nobuo later in 1870, the assassins were men of the Mimawarigumi (another Tokugawa-affiliated unit) under the hatamoto Sasaki Tadasaburō.

Later on December 13, 1867, he, Nagakura Shinpachi and several Shinsengumi members were involved in the ambush of Itō Kashitarō&#x27;s Goryō Eji Kōdai-ji faction during the Aburanokōji incident.

In January 1868, Harada, together with the rest of the Shinsengumi, fought at the Battle of Toba–Fushimi against the Imperial forces. He and his family subsequently left the Kyoto region for Edo. In March, the Shinsengumi was renamed to and advanced on Kai Province, and fought at the Battle of Kōshū-Katsunuma, however, the unit was defeated and forced to retreat back to Edo. In the wake of this defeat, Harada and Nagakura Shinpachi left the Kōyō Chinbutai after disagreements with Kondō and Hijikata. According to Nagakura&#x27;s version of events, Kondō wanted the surviving men to become his retainers; Nagakura, Harada, and a few others staunchly refused. Nagakura and Harada, taking with them some other Shinsengumi members, joined with a group of former Tokugawa retainers to form a new unit, the Seiheitai. Seiheitai left Edo shortly after Edo Castle&#x27;s surrender, and headed north, hoping to take part in the fighting that was moving northward, toward Aizu.

==Death==
After Seiheitai&#x27;s departure from Edo, Harada, wishing to be with his wife and child, returned to the city. However, he was unable to leave the city, and so he joined the Shōgitai, which also sided with the Tokugawa regime. Harada fought at the Battle of Ueno, where he was severely wounded by enemy gunfire. Two days later on July 6, 1868, he died of his wounds, while at the residence of the hatamoto, Jinbo &quot;Yamashiro-no-kami&quot;.

There is a rumor that Harada did not die in 1868, but he survived and travelled to China and became a leader for a group of horse-riding bandits. There were reports that an old Japanese man came to the aid of the Imperial Japanese Army in the First Sino-Japanese War, and claimed to be Harada Sanosuke. This was reported in a newspaper in 1965, but remains unsubstantiated.

==In popular culture==

Harada Sanosuke appears in Shiba Ryōtarō&#x27;s novels &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; and &quot;Shinsengumi Keppuroku&quot;.

He is depicted in NHK&#x27;s Taiga drama series &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; (played by Yamamoto Taro.)

In addition, Harada appears in the anime series &quot;Peacemaker Kurogane&quot;, as well as in the manga it was originally based on, &quot;Shinsengumi Imon PEACE MAKER&quot; and &quot;Peacemaker Kurogane&quot;. He is also featured in &quot;Kaze Hikaru&quot; (manga), &quot;Hakodate Youjin Buraichou Himegami&quot; (manga), &quot;Getsumei Seiki&quot; (manga) and &quot;Bakumatsu Renka Shinsengumi&quot; (video game series.)

Harada appeared in flashback sequences in &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; and also served as an inspiration for the character Sagara Sanosuke.

Harada Sanosuke appears as a major character in the otome game and anime series &quot;Hakuouki Shinsengumi Kitan&quot;.

Harada Sanosuke appears as a minor antagonist in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio&#x27;s 2014 action-adventure game game Like a Dragon: Ishin! and its 2023 remake. He shares his appearance and voice with series antagonist Masato Aizawa.

<text>The Best Bakery case was a legal case involving the burning down of the Best Bakery, a small outlet in the Hanuman Tekri area in Vadodara, Gujarat, India, on 1 March 2002. During the incident, mob targeted the Sheikh family who ran the bakery and had taken refuge inside, resulting in the deaths of fourteen people (11 Muslims including family members and 3 Hindu employees of the bakery). This case has come to symbolize the carnage in 2002 Gujarat riots that followed the Godhra train burning. All the 21 accused were acquitted by the court due to shoddy police work and issues with evidence.

==Background==
On 1 March 2002, communal frenzy enveloped Vadodara. The Best Bakery, a small outlet in the Hanuman Tekri area of Vadodara, was attacked by a mob, which burned down the bakery, killing 14 people. This attack was part of the 2002 Gujarat riots. As per a televised interview by Zaheera Shaikh, one of the survivors who had witnessed the entire saga, a large mob surrounded the bakery in the evening, around 8 pm. They first stole all the goods that were kept in the bakery including sacks of flour. Thereafter they set fire to the bakery and the people inside, most of them Zaheera&#x27;s relatives, shouting that &quot;no one should escape alive from it&quot;.

Amnesty International reports that in many cases of the Gujarat violence, police recorded complaints in a &quot;defective&quot; manner, failed to collect witnesses&#x27; statements as well as corroborative evidence and did not investigate the responsibility of eminent suspects. The Best Bakery case was seen by human rights organizations in India as a test case given that what Amnesty calls &quot;strong evidence&quot; against the accused existed, but the victims gained little justice.

==Case in 2003 and acquittal==
The case was tried at a fast court by the Vadodara sessions court judge Hemantsinh U Mahida. It lasted less than two months (9 May - 27 June 2003).

The case hinged on the first hand evidence presented in two FIR (First information reports) that had been presented - that of Raizkhan Amin Mohammed Pathan and of Zaheera Sheikh. In addition, evidence was provided by a large number of witnesses whose evidence was secondary (indirect or hearsay).

The day after the attack, Zaheera Sheikh filed the first informant complaint. Sheikh, a 19-year-old during the incident, was a key and notable witness. She stated that she saw a large mob set fire to their bakery and saw them burn her family members to death. When the mob gathered, shouting communal slogans, her family fled to the terrace and some locked themselves in a first-floor room. The Sheikh family lived in a house directly above the bakery. The mob set the bakery on fire and killings continued from 6 pm to 10 am the next day, a period of sixteen hours. Her statements were recounted for many publications. However, as per documents presented to the court, Zaheera&#x27;s FIR was registered by the Gujarat Police|police on 4 March 2002, leading the defence to oppose its use and the judge to suspect its validity and the possibility of it having been doctored by the police to implicate innocent people at the expense of the guilty perpetrators. The defence purported that only the FIR that was registered on FIR of 1 March 2002 (by Raizkhan Amin Mohammed Pathan) should be admissible under Section 60 of the Indian Evidence Act.

Further, in court on 23 March 2003, as many as 37 of the 73 witnesses, including Sheikh, turned hostile. It was later alleged by their former mentors that they had received threats to their lives, including from Madhu Shrivastav. Other witnesses gave garbled and self-contradictory witness account, strikingly at variance with the lucid, grammatical and logical written affidavits which had previously been filed in their name. The prosecution claimed that these witnesses had suffered head injuries and were not in a mental state to give an accurate account of their experiences, but could not explain the lucidity of the affidavits. The state government pointed to the lapses by the Gujarat Police in &quot;registering and recording of FIR&quot; (First Information Report) and on the part of the prosecution in &quot;recording of evidence&quot; of witnesses in the Best Bakery case.

As a result of all these, the prosecution&#x27;s case collapsed in court and all of the 21 accused were acquitted. The judgment was delivered on 27 June 2003 by additional sessions judge Hemantsinh U Mahida of the Vadodara fast track court. The judgment said, &quot;It was proved beyond doubt that a violent mob had attacked the bakery and killed 12 persons. However, there was no legally acceptable evidence to prove that any of the accused presented before the court had committed the crime.&quot; The judgment was critical of the police for delay in registering FIR and for not investigating the incident properly and harassing innocent people, including the accused.

==Reactions==
A large section of the press expressed outrage for a prolonged period at the acquittals. It was reported that key witnesses in the case had lied in court out of fear for their lives as they had been given death threats. Key witnesses in the case include the wife and daughter of the bakery owner. They accused party politicians of threatening and harassing them into withdrawing their testimony. According to their testimony to the police and the National Human Rights Commission, 500 people had attacked the bakery. Amnesty International criticized the judgment as &quot;the lack of government commitment to ensuring justice to victims of the communal violence in Gujarat.&quot; India&#x27;s National Human Rights Commission described it as a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot; and, along with other petitioners, argued that the case should be investigated by an independent agency. The Supreme court expressed displeasure at the acquittal.

The Gujarat government responded by pointing out many other cases where the guilty were left unpunished. Solicitor General Mukul Rohatgi cited the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 and said many of the accused are still free.

==Re-trial and hostile witnesses==
Soon after the sessions court judgement, Zaheera and her mother gave interviews to the media stating that they had lied in court. On 5 July 2003, Zaheera and her mother told &quot;The Sunday Express&quot; that Zaheera had lied in court because she had received death threats. On 7 July 2003, Zaheera told the media that Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) MLA Madhu Srivastava and his cousin, Congress councilor Chandrakant Srivastava were behind the threats, hence she sought a re-trial &quot;outside&quot; Gujarat. Due to this, media coverage and protests by several citizens groups, the 
National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) visited Vadodara on 8 July to examine documents related to the case. The NHRC moved a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court on 31 July 2003 asking for a retrial outside Gujarat.

Aware of media outrage, three Supreme Court judges ordered the head of Gujarat police and the chief secretary of Gujarat to appear before the court in order to explain their actions in the incident. Chief Justice VN Khare said he had &quot;no confidence&quot; in the Gujarat government, while the Indian Supreme Court criticized the government and ordered a retrial. The Supreme Court ordered that the retrial be moved out of Gujarat after accusing the state government of judicial failures on 12 April 2004 in Maharashtra. The orders were passed by Justice Doraiswamy Raju and Justice Arijit Pasayat.

On 24 September 2004, charges were framed by Judge Abhay Thipsay in Mumbai and the retrial began on 4 October 2004. During the first few weeks, the formal prosecution witnesses were examined and witnesses to the Best Bakery massacre began to testifying on 27 October 2004 as part of the proceedings of Case 315 of 2004 at the Greater sessions court at Mazgaon, Mumbai. These witnesses included Tufel Ahmed, Raees Khan Pathan and Shehzad Khan, who worked at the bakery and witnessed the events.

However, on 3 November 2004, Zaheera filed an affidavit at the High Court stating, &quot;If we don&#x27;t lie as instructed by Teesta, then these people will get me and my family members killed,&quot; Zaheera said with regard to Teesta Setalvad, a journalist and activist who was assisting to obtain justice for the riot victims.
Further, she said that &quot;after the fast track court had acquitted the 21 accused, two Muslims had barged into her house and told her that to change her statement in the interest of the community. Thereafter she along with brother were taken to Mumbai to Teesta Setalvad.&quot; Her statements were vague, often self-contradictory, but she insisted that she had been kept captive by Setalvad who had made her sign some legal papers. She further said that the matter was taken to Supreme Court against her wishes.

In June 2005, the investigating officer P.P. Kanani was cross examined. Kanani had taken over as investigating officer from Himmatsinh Baria of Panigate Police Station on 10 March 2002. On 29 August 2005, a committee appointed by the Supreme Court of India|Supreme court indicted Zaheera Sheikh as a &quot;liar&quot; and criticized her series of &quot;flip-flop statements&quot;. The Government of Gujarat filed an amended appeal in the Gujarat High Court seeking a retrial of the case and the appeal was admitted by the Gujarat High Court. After being indicted by the Supreme Court of India, the police registered a case against Shrivastav Madhubhai Babubhai for intimidating witnesses to the incident.

The government of Gujarat admitted that there were lapses on the part of the Gujarat Police|police in registering and recording FIR in the case and on the part of the prosecution in recording the evidence of witnesses. It said that the police had attempted to help the accused by not submitting names of the accused. Meanwhile, Zahira Sheikh, admitted lying in court and not testifying against the accused. She said she had been threatened by senior figures in the local organisation of Gujarat&#x27;s ruling party, the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party. Thus 17 of the accused charged with murdering 14 people were retried in the case beginning in 2004.

==Perjury==
A serious dent to Best Bakery case key witness Zahira Sheikh&#x27;s credibility, a Supreme Court-appointed committee has indicted her as a &quot;self-condemned liar&quot; falling to &quot;inducements&quot; by &quot;certain persons&quot; to give &quot;inconsistent&quot; statements during the trial of the case. A bench comprising Justice Arijit Pasayat and Justice H K Sema opened the sealed report and read out the three main conclusions of the committee headed by Supreme Court Registrar General B M Gupta. At the same time, the committee gave a clean chit to social activist Teesta Setalavad of the charges of inducement levelled against her by Zahira.

On 10 January 2005, the court referred the matter for inquiry on being faced with the flip-flops of Zahira much to the embarrassment of her one time protector and social activist Setalavad. The bench, after glancing through the over 150-page report, said that the committee has come to the conclusion that there was inducement given to Zahira by certain persons and that there were inconsistencies in her statements. The court made it clear that it has not accepted the report and sought the opinion of the counsel for both Zahira and Setalavad in regard to &#x27;acceptability&#x27; of the report.

===Allegation of false depositions===
Mother of prime witness in the Best Bakery case Zahira Sheikh, was on Thursday held guilty of contempt of court by the special court conducting the re-trial here. The court imposed a fine of Rs 100 on Sehrunnisa after reading her reply to a show-cause notice issued to her earlier in the day. Sehrunnisa was taken into custody after the trial court initiated contempt proceedings against her for her defiant attitude during her deposition as a witness. While tendering evidence, she frequently looked at Raes Khan, an NGO activist, who was sitting in the court.
Even after the judge told her to address the court and not to look at others she continued to look at Raes. The judge warned her that she could be held for contempt, to which Sehrunnisa replied: &quot;Please take action against me.&quot; Sehrunnisa said Raes was gesturing at her and hence, she was looking at him.

==Life sentences==
In February 2006, a court in India convicted nine of the 21 people of murder, sentencing them to life imprisonment. It acquitted 8 others, while issuing warrants for the arrest of four missing persons. Of the nine convicted for life by the trial court, Bombay High Court acquitted five for want of evidence, but upheld the sentence in respect of the remaining four.

The judgment, called &quot;landmark&quot; by BBC journalist Sanjoy Majumder, brought the case to an end. The case has the legacy of being &quot;one of the country&#x27;s most controversial and high profile trials.&quot;

==2012 Bombay High Court==
On 9 July 2012, the Bombay High Court, upheld the life sentences of four accused, Sanjay Thakkar, Bahadursingh Chauhan, Sanabhai Baria and Dinesh Rajbhar on the basis of four eyewitness accounts, who were injured bakery employees and identified the accused. It acquitted five accused, Rajubhai Baria, Pankaj Gosavi, Jagdish Rajput, Suresh alias Lalo Devjibhai Vasava and Shailesh Tadvi, for lack of evidence.

<text>Juan Ramón González de Balcarce (16 March 1773 – 12 November 1836) was an Argentine military leader and politician.

==Biography==

Juan was the older brother of Antonio González de Balcarce and of Marcos González de Balcarce. He fought against the British in 1807, and in the 1812–1813 military campaign in Upper Peru under General Manuel Belgrano. He was governor of Buenos Aires from 1818 to 1820. Under the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas, he served as the defense minister. In 1832, he was again elected governor of Buenos Aires. On 11 October 1833, the city was filled with announcements of a trial against Rosas. A large number of gauchos and poor people made a demonstration at the gates of the legislature, praising Rosas and demanding the resignation of Balcarce. The troops organized to fight the demonstration mutinied and joined it. The legislature finally gave up the trial, ousted Balcarce and replaced him with Juan José Viamonte. Balcarce was imprisoned and died in exile in Concepción del Uruguay.

<text>Trésor Lomana LuaLua (; born 28 December 1980) is a Congolese former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is currently the attacking coach for Spalding United.

LuaLua was born in Kinshasa, but moved to England at a young age. After impressing in a college football match, he signed for Colchester United. There he scored a total of 21 goals in 68 appearances, which prompted Newcastle United to sign him. However, the competition for places meant he was less of a regular in the first team, and after four seasons and 88 appearances he transferred to Portsmouth, where he had previously been on loan for three months from Newcastle. He remained there for three seasons, but his spell was marred by disciplinary problems and malaria. After leaving Portsmouth, he moved teams frequently, representing sides in Greece, Qatar, Cyprus and Turkey, in addition to a brief return to English football at Blackpool. LuaLua received his first of 31 international caps in 2002, and scored seven goals in an eleven-year international career. He represented his national team at four Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.

LuaLua is also known for setting up the &quot;LuaLua Foundation&quot;, which provides care for orphans in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and for being a patron for the Haslar Visitors Group. His brother Kazenga, and cousins Trésor Kandol and Yannick Bolasie, all became footballers as well.

==Early life==
LuaLua was born Trésor Lua Lua Lomana – Lua Lua, his grandfather&#x27;s given name, was passed to him and his brother Kazenga – in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo), in 1980, but moved to England as a young boy in 1989. His family settled in Forest Gate in London; there, he attended Forest Gate Community School and started to play football at the age of 16, while also being involved in gymnastics. His activity in gymnastics was the base of his trademark goal celebration, seven back flips and a backward somersault. LuaLua represented his school at football after he was spotted kicking a tennis ball around in the playground. He was playing for Leyton Sixth Form College, where he studied performing arts, when he was spotted at the age of 17 by second division side, Colchester United. Geoff Harrop, a scout for Colchester College&#x27;s football team, was impressed by LuaLua&#x27;s performance, &quot;He was taking on the whole team by the end of the game and it wasn&#x27;t hard to pick him out among 22 young 17-year-olds.&quot; Harrop invited the striker for a trial at Colchester United and he was signed by the club.

His brother, Kazenga LuaLua, is also a professional footballer, and two of his cousins also play professionally, Yannick Bolasie and Trésor Kandol.

==Club career==

===Colchester United===
LuaLua joined Colchester United in September 1998. Initially, he struggled to adapt and he preferred going to nightclubs over playing for Colchester, Harrop says, &quot;It took a lot of hard work by the staff at Colchester. Micky Cook, the director of youth, had to spend endless hours with him and [manager] Steve Wignall and then [the next manager] Steve Whitton had to spend a lot of time with him talking him through the tactical side of the game and what his role was within the team&quot;. LuaLua scored within four minutes of his debut where he appeared as a substitute in a 3–1 defeat to Chesterfield. In two seasons, he made 68 league and cup appearances for Colchester, 44 starts and 24 substitute appearances, scoring a total of 21 goals.

His performances attracted the attention of several Premiership clubs, and despite manager Steve Whitton&#x27;s denial that LuaLua was for sale LuaLua joined Newcastle United in September 2000 for a fee of £2.25 million. An earlier offer by Newcastle of £300,000 for LuaLua made by former manager, Ruud Gullit, had been rejected, but the much increased bid offered financial security and assistance towards a new ground and was one that Colchester felt they could not turn down.

===Newcastle United===
LuaLua had been brought to the attention of Newcastle manager, Bobby Robson, by Mick Wadsworth, assistant-manager at Newcastle United, who was a former manager of Colchester. Robson watched LuaLua before deciding to negotiate the transfer, and said, &quot;I see [LuaLua] as a special talent. He has to learn how to play with the other players but he&#x27;s a special new talent. He has to be nursed and cherished and taught. But we are buying long-term a very promising talent, a very promising player.&quot; LuaLua signed a five-year contract with the club. He made his first-team debut in a 1–0 home defeat to Charlton Athletic in September 2000 and made 23 league and cup appearances for Newcastle in the 2000–01 season without scoring. He scored twice in Newcastle&#x27;s Intertoto Cup campaign at the beginning of the 2001–02 season but his first Premiership goal did not come until April 2002, when he scored a last-minute winner in a 3–2 away win against Derby County. He scored a further two goals in the remaining four games of the season. LuaLua&#x27;s goalscoring form continued into the beginning of the 2002–03 season when he scored three goals in his first four games, but tougher competition for a first-team place meant that LuaLua made only 22 appearances throughout that season. In January 2003, LuaLua had urged Robson to rotate the squad, saying, &quot;I think I deserve a chance now, as do many of the lads on the fringes of the team. Although some people might have the idea that those of us not in the team like sitting on the bench and getting paid good money, nothing could be further from the truth. I&#x27;m not in this for the money, I want to play for the first team and show what I can do on a regular basis.&quot; LuaLua also spent much of the beginning of the 2003–04 season on the bench and in November 2003, complained about his lack of first-team football and indicated that he would consider leaving Newcastle. In the &quot;Newcastle Chronicle&quot;, Robson responded, saying he would not take advice from a player about how to manage the side: &quot;How dare he say this? I run this football club... LuaLua has been a pretty poor professional about all this. What he should do is keep his mouth shut and get out there and do what he is paid for.&quot; In the end, he made 88 league and cup appearances for Newcastle, scoring nine goals, having started 21 games and made 67 appearances as a substitute.

===Portsmouth===
In February 2004, after returning from the 2004 African Cup of Nations, he joined Portsmouth on a three-month loan deal with a view to a permanent deal at the end of the season. LuaLua scored on his debut for Portsmouth in a 4–3 away defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in February 2004. During this loan spell he scored in the 89th minute in a 1–1 draw for Portsmouth against parent club Newcastle. The result lifted Portsmouth out of the bottom three of the Premiership. This also led to a change in legislation with the FA introducing standard rules meaning a player on loan could not play against their parent club. He scored four goals in 15 appearances for Portsmouth as they finished in mid-table in their debut season in the Premiership. Manager Harry Redknapp was sufficiently impressed with LuaLua&#x27;s performances that when his loan spell ended at the end of the 2003–04 season, he signed LuaLua permanently at a cost of £1.75 million.

LuaLua made 26 league and cup appearances, scoring six goals, including two against local rivals Southampton, in the 2004–05 season. The season was marred by a groin injury at the beginning and a hamstring injury in May 2005. Disciplinary problems led to charges by the Football Association of abusive behaviour in December 2004 and improper conduct after he was sent off against Blackburn Rovers in January 2005, for which he received an extra one-match ban and a fine of £5,000 in addition to a three-match ban for the dismissal.

He made 26 appearances in the 2005–06 season, scoring seven goals, but missed several games in the autumn after contracting malaria on a visit to Africa to play for DR Congo. He also missed several games due to international duty at the 2006 African Cup of Nations and missed games in April 2006 after damaging his foot while doing his acrobatic goal celebration during a game against Arsenal. His disciplinary problems continued when he was warned by the Football Association over his future conduct; this came after he admitted a charge of improper conduct in relation to comments made about referee Uriah Rennie after a 3–1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur in December.
LuaLua signed a new three-year contract in July 2006; it was set to keep him at Portsmouth until 2009.

An ankle injury suffered in a pre-season friendly led to LuaLua missing the beginning of the 2006–07 season. He struggled to break back into the first-team, making only eight starts out of 24 appearances, and scored only two goals in that season. Redknapp warned him that he needed to &quot;...start performing&quot; and that he had to &quot;...start producing next season&quot;. He joined Greek club Olympiacos in August 2007 and Redknapp admitted that, &quot;Lua wants to move on... I&#x27;ve no doubt he&#x27;ll go away and be a great player for Olympiacos. He wants a change, he wants to play in a role behind the strikers and he wants to move abroad. He will get to play in the Champions League by moving to Greece. He has been a top Premier League player and he&#x27;ll be a top player for them.&quot;

===Olympiacos===

On 12 August 2007, LuaLua signed a three-year contract with Olympiacos for an estimated fee of £2.8 million (€4.1 million). He made his league debut on 2 September, in a 0–0 draw against Panathinaikos. His Champions League debut came on 18 September in a 1–1 draw against Lazio. LuaLua scored his first two goals on 23 September in a 6–2 win over OFI.

On 16 January 2008, LuaLua opened the scoring with a 30-yard volley in the Greek Cup fifth round, which saw Olympiacos progress to the quarter-finals in a 4–0 win against Panathinaikos. LuaLua missed both the knockout stages against Chelsea, having suffered from ankle injuries and a dislocated shoulder, the latter of which he received in a 1–1 draw against Asteras Tripolis. As a result, he missed most of the season, but returned on 20 April 2008 to help Olympiacos win their fourth Super League Greece title, beating Iraklis 3–1. Before the 2008 Greek Cup Final on 17 May, LuaLua fell out of favour and was deemed surplus to requirements. In total, he made 30 appearances for Olympiacos, scoring six goals.

===Al-Arabi===
Following his injury spell at Olympiacos, LuaLua joined Qatari based club Al-Arabi on a one-year contract in July 2008. On 30 October, Al-Arabi won the Sheikh Jassim Cup, beating Al-Rayyan Club 3–0 in the final with LuaLua scoring one goal in the seventh minute. In the 21st week of the 2008–09 season, on 20 February 2009, LuaLua scored his first league goal for the club in a 4–2 defeat to Al-Khor. His only other goal for that season came in a 1–0 win over Al-Kharitiyath on 16 April.

===Return to Olympiacos===
During December 2009, LuaLua left Al-Arabi by mutual consent and rejoined Olympiakos on a six-month contract with an option for the club to extend the contract for two years. LuaLua scored the first goals of his second spell with a brace against Asteras Tripolis.

===Omonia===
LuaLua signed a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee with Omonia in July 2010, reuniting with Takis Lemonis for the second time since Olympiakos in 2008. He scored his first goal on his league debut on 18 September 2010 in a 4–0 win against Alki Larnaca, coming on as a substitute for Georgios Efrem. On 18 May 2011, LuaLua won the Cypriot Cup with Omonia after winning 4–3 on penalties against Apollon Limassol.

===Return to England===
In September 2011, after his release by Omonia, LuaLua trained with League One club Hartlepool United, where he linked up with former Newcastle United assistant-manager Mick Wadsworth. He was then offered a contract by Blackpool, a level above in the Championship.

===Turkey===
On 24 May 2012, it was confirmed that LuaLua had turned down a new contract at Blackpool and had signed a two-year deal with Turkish side Kardemir Karabükspor. He was considered one of the best players in the first half of the Turkish league.

On 2 February 2015, LuaLua signed a contract with Akhisar Belediyespor. He left the club in January 2016, and signed a contract with Şanlıurfaspor the following month, leaving in May 2016.

===Northern Cyprus===
On 12 May 2017, LuaLua signed a contract with Northern Cypriot club Merit Alsancak Yeşilova. He played his first friendly game against Bostancı Bağcıl on 11 August. LuaLua ended the 2017–18 KTFF Süper Lig season with nine goals in 23 appearances. After leaving the club in 2018, LuaLua played for English non-league side Tilbury in July; featuring for the second half of a 1–0 friendly win versus Hashtag United. For the 2018–19 campaign, LuaLua returned to Northern Cyprus to play with Süper Lig teams Doğan Türk Birliği and Gìrne Halk Evì.

===Peterborough Sports===
On 13 November 2019, Southern League Premier Division Central side Peterborough Sports announced the signing of LuaLua. He made his debut for the club in January 2020, coming off the bench in a league match against Hitchin Town.

==International career==
===2002 and 2004 Africa Cup of Nations===
LuaLua was first named by the DR Congo national team in the preliminary squad for the African Nations Cup finals in Mali in January 2002. He played in the 0–0 draw with Togo, the 1–0 loss to Cameroon, the 3–1 win over Ivory Coast and the quarter-final match against Senegal, which DR Congo lost 2–0 amid some controversy. LuaLua blamed the referee Domenico Messina for the defeat: &quot;We had a lot of fouls which the referee didn&#x27;t give and there was a penalty right in front of him but he just let the match go on. Sometimes they [the Senegalese] fell over without being touched, screamed, and the referee just gave the foul to them.&quot;

DR Congo&#x27;s qualifying campaign for the 2004 African Nations Cup in Tunisia began six months after the 2002 tournament ended, with a match against Libya on 8 September. Libya won the match 3–2. LuaLua initially indicated that he might not play in the match, but did so reluctantly after threats were made to his family, which caused him to reconsider his international career. Robson commented, &quot;He didn&#x27;t want to go and play in that match. But he said he had to go because his grandmother had been threatened.&quot; He played in the 2–0 win over Botswana in October 2002, when he scored inside five minutes but was later sent off for dissent. He was suspended for two matches and his next appearance was in the 0–0 draw with Botswana in July 2003, which secured qualification for the finals of the competition. LuaLua initially expressed doubts that he would take part in the finals due to club commitments. He was, however, included in the squad and named as captain in the absence of regular captain Shabani Nonda, who missed the tournament due to a knee injury. LuaLua said on being named as captain, &quot;When Shabani plays, it takes the pressure off me but now everyone&#x27;s now looking to me for leadership and I feel honoured.&quot; He appeared in the first match of the tournament, a 2–1 defeat to Guinea, but in the next match against the hosts Tunisia, he was sent off, reacting angrily and taking several minutes to leave the pitch. DR Congo went on to lose the match and were eliminated from the tournament. Following his sending off, LuaLua considered giving up international football and criticised the behaviour of the Tunisia players during the match and the organisation of the tournament. He later criticised the national football federation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Congolese Association Football Federation, blaming them for the poor state of the national side, but said that he would continue to be available for international selection: &quot;I can never turn my back on my country. I play for Congo because I am proud to do it.&quot; He apologised to his country for his sending off against Tunisia.

===2006 Africa Cup of Nations===
LuaLua received a four-match suspension for the sending-off and missed several 2006 World Cup qualifying round matches during the summer of June 2004. He was selected for the World Cup qualifier against South Africa in September, but missed the match due to injury, and was then dropped for the next qualifier against Ghana in October. He missed the 1–1 draw with Ghana in March 2005 after a dispute with the DR Congo football association but committed himself to the match against Uganda in June. He scored in a friendly against Guinea played in Paris in August, a match used as preparation for the World Cup qualifying matches the following month. LuaLua played for DR Congo in the 2–1 win over Cape Verde in September but contracted malaria and missed the final World Cup qualifier against South Africa in October.

LuaLua was recalled to the DR Congo squad for a friendly against Tunisia played near Paris in November 2005, as part of the countries&#x27; preparation for the 2006 African Nations Cup held in Egypt in January and February 2006. He was unable to play, however, after he was one of several players refused a visa by French immigration authorities. He was named as the captain of DR Congo for the tournament in place of Shabani Nonda who was injured for a second successive Nations Cup. He then delayed his departure to be available to his club Portsmouth for a crucial league match, missing a friendly with Senegal. Despite a pay dispute leading to the DR Congo players threatening to boycott the match, which was only resolved shortly before the kickoff, he returned to the side for DR Congo&#x27;s opening match of the tournament against Togo, assisting in one goal and scoring the other in a 2–0 win. He appeared against Angola and Cameroon as DR Congo qualified for the quarter-finals stage of the tournament, only to be beaten by the hosts Egypt. LuaLua&#x27;s 18-month-old son died while he was playing in the tournament.

===Later international career===
In the 2008 African Nations Cup qualifier against Ethiopia in April 2007, LuaLua scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory; the result extended their lead at the top of their group. He did not travel to Ethiopia for the away fixture in June, which DR Congo lost, as the authorities failed to send LuaLua his travel documents in time. Following the failure of DR Congo to qualify for the tournament in October, the DR Congo sports minister, Pardonne Kaliba, suspended the manager, Henri Depireux, and removed the captaincy from LuaLua.

LuaLua returned to the DR Congo squad in the 2010 World Cup qualifier against Egypt in June 2008. After returning to Greece, he complained of severe stomach pain and was rushed to hospital to have his appendix removed, ruling him out of subsequent matches for several weeks, as DR Congo moved to the top of Group 12 in the second round. Despite topping the group at that point, DR Congo were later eliminated at this stage and therefore failed to progress to the third round of qualifying.

In February 2012, national manager Claude Le Roy confirmed that he was with LuaLua in the aim of him returning to the national team for their Cup of Nations qualifier against Seychelles. He did not play that game, but in December LuaLua was named for his fourth Africa Cup of Nations, in South Africa in 2013. He started all three matches—all draws—as the team exited from Group C.

==Personal life==
In September 2003, LuaLua was fined £175 by Newcastle Magistrates Court for watching British television without a licence.

In 2005, LuaLua became patron of the Haslar Visitors Group, a charity that works with detainees in an immigration removal centre. In the following year, he set up the LuaLua Foundation, building a hostel, sport and education complex in Kinshasa to provide care and education for orphaned children in DR Congo. He is also actively involved in the Show Racism the Red Card campaign and was involved in the launch of a new video entitled &quot;A Safe Place&quot;, which features Premiership footballers talking about their experiences with racism. LuaLua is a born-again Christian and his former teammate at Portsmouth, Linvoy Primus, was quoted saying &quot;We are not scared to say we pray together before games. About 45 minutes before a game we link our arms and just pray that we can glorify God.&quot;

LuaLua wrote the foreword to &quot;You Can Have Chips&quot;, the autobiography of his former manager Steve Wignall.

<doc id="1010867" wikidata="Q6133918" url="?curid=1010867" title="James FitzGerald (New Zealand politician)">
<text>James Edward FitzGerald (4 March 1818 – 2 August 1896) was a New Zealand politician. According to some historians, he should be considered the country&#x27;s first premier, although a more conventional view is that neither he nor his successor should properly be given that title. He was a notable campaigner for New Zealand self-governance. He was the first Superintendent of the Canterbury Province.

== Early life ==
FitzGerald was born on 4 March 1818 in Bath, England. His parents, Gerald FitzGerald and Katherine O&#x27;Brien, were Irish, and FitzGerald is known to have cherished his connection with Ireland, despite being educated in England. He was educated first in Bath, and then at Christ&#x27;s College of the University of Cambridge. He initially sought a commission in the Royal Engineers, but poor eyesight made this impossible. Instead, he began working for the British Museum&#x27;s Antiquities department, and became the museum&#x27;s Assistant Secretary.

FitzGerald gradually became concerned with the alleviation of poverty, an interest spurred by the problems of the Great Famine of Ireland. His suggested solution to poverty was emigration to the colonies, where more opportunities might exist for prosperity. As such, he became heavily involved in the promotion and planning of new colonies. In 1849, he became secretary of the Canterbury Association, responsible for the Anglican settlement at Christchurch, New Zealand. The settlement was well organised by the Canterbury Association; the printing press for the colony&#x27;s newspaper was sent with the First Four Ships (FitzGerald becoming the first editor of the &quot;Lyttelton Times&quot;) and the main building for the settlement&#x27;s school, known these days as Christ&#x27;s College Big School, was designed by FitzGerald in 1850 in England. The building was constructed in 1863 and is the only building known to have been designed by FitzGerald.

FitzGerald married Frances Erskine Draper on 22 August 1850, and soon afterwards quarrelled with her father. As a result, FitzGerald and his wife themselves left for Christchurch. They arrived in Lyttelton, the port of Christchurch, on 16 December 1850 on board of the &quot;Charlotte Jane&quot;.

In Christchurch, FitzGerald had a number of roles. He continued to act as an agent for the Canterbury Association, but also became a sub-inspector of police. He later established a cattle and dairy farm, and became the founding editor of the &quot;Lyttelton Times&quot;. Gradually, FitzGerald became one of the prominent public figures of the area.

== Political career ==

=== Provincial superintendent ===
In November 1852, a deputation put a requisition to John Robert Godley, asking him to allow himself to be nominated for the first election for Superintendent of the Canterbury Province; Fitzgerald was part of that deputation. Godley declined, and in July 1853, FitzGerald, Colonel James Campbell and Henry Tancred contested the election. They received 136, 94 and 89 votes, respectively. Campbell protested about the election, as the returning officer had indicated to the voters that he could not be elected, as he had been struck off the electoral list. But the protest came to nothing, and Fitzgerald was declared the first Superintendent of the Canterbury Province.

A major part of his work as Superintendent was an attempt to increase Canterbury&#x27;s self-government, drawing the province&#x27;s &quot;cabinet&quot; from the elected Council rather than appointing it himself. His goal was to make the province&#x27;s executive responsible to its legislature. He remained Superintendent until he retired on 28 September 1857.

=== Member of Parliament ===
 

 

When the 1st New Zealand Parliament was called, FitzGerald was elected MP for the Lyttelton electorate, and represented it from 1853 to 1857, when he resigned during the term of the 2nd New Zealand Parliament. Despite his election to Parliament, he chose to retain the Superintendency of Canterbury, a decision criticised by some. In Parliament, FitzGerald argued strongly in favour of &quot;responsible government&quot; once again, attempting to make New Zealand&#x27;s executive responsible to Parliament rather than the Governor. The acting Governor, Robert Wynyard, eventually agreed to appoint FitzGerald, Henry Sewell, Frederick Weld, and Thomas Bartley to the Executive Council. They were later joined briefly by Dillon Bell, a member of the Legislative Council.

FitzGerald was chosen to lead this delegation, which lasted from 14 June 1854 to 2 August 1854, and is therefore sometimes said to have headed New Zealand&#x27;s first &quot;cabinet&quot;. He had no formal title, however, and did not have sufficient powers to actually govern. As such, most historians do not consider him to have been prime minister as the term is used today. FitzGerald accepted the position in the belief that full authority would later be transferred from Wynyard&#x27;s appointees to the new cabinet, and was consequently angry when Wynyard claimed that royal assent (which had not been given) was necessary for this change to occur. Seven weeks after their appointment, FitzGerald&#x27;s cabinet resigned, and was replaced by another cabinet of four persons headed by Thomas Forsaith.

Later, when the 2nd New Zealand Parliament managed to obtain the power that had eluded the 1st, FitzGerald was too ill to attend. Instead, Henry Sewell (one of FitzGerald&#x27;s colleagues in the first attempted cabinet) was asked to form a government. In 1857, FitzGerald resigned from Parliament on the advice of his doctors, and also decided not to seek re-election as provincial superintendent. Instead, he left Lyttelton on 30 September on the &quot;James Gibson&quot; for Sydney and returned to England, where he resumed his work for the Canterbury Association. During his time in England, he was offered governorships of both British Columbia and Queensland, but his ill health prevented him from accepting.
By 1860, he had returned to New Zealand on the &quot;Matoaka&quot;, and shortly afterwards won election to the Canterbury Provincial Council; first for the Akaroa electorate in May 1861, and then in the Town of Akaroa electorate from September 1861 to December 1862. He also founded &quot;The Press&quot;, which remains Christchurch&#x27;s largest newspaper today. In 1862, he returned to national politics. The resignation of Thomas Rowley in the Ellesmere electorate caused the 12 July 1862 Ellesmere by-election, which FitzGerald won. He represented the electorate until the end of the parliamentary term in 1866, and then successfully stood in the City of Christchurch electorate in 1866 (elected unopposed), from which he resigned the following year.

In Parliament, he strongly advocated peaceful negotiations in the New Zealand Wars, supporting Māori rights and condemning land confiscation as an &quot;enormous crime&quot;. He also campaigned to have primary responsibility for relations with the Māori transferred from the Governor to Parliament. Other suggestions he made included reserving a third of Parliament for Māori politicians, recognition of the Māori King movement, and the withdrawal of British troops from New Zealand. FitzGerald strongly believed that if Māori and colonists did not make a deliberate attempt at reconciliation, one or both would eventually be destroyed.

On 5 November 1863, he attempted to convince Parliament that the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 was contrary to the Treaty of Waitangi &quot;which distinctly guaranteed and pledged the faith of the Crown that the lands of the natives shall not be taken from them except by the ordinary process of law—that is, taken within the meaning of the Treaty.&quot; He also stated that in his opinion, the purpose of the Act was to acquire Maori land.

In 1865, he had a two-month term as Minister of Native Affairs in the government of Frederick Weld (another colleague from the first provisional cabinet), but did not succeed in implementing many of his policies.

His brother Gerard represented the Hokitika electorate for one term in Parliament.

== Later life ==

In 1867, FitzGerald retired from politics completely. He was subsequently moved to Wellington and was appointed comptroller of the public account, supervising all government expenditures. Later, he also acted as Auditor-General. He retained these positions until his death. He was also seriously involved in the establishment of the Public Service Association, a union for all government employees.

FitzGerald was also active in the cultural life of the capital. He was known as a painter (mostly watercolours), public speaker, and debater, and also wrote poetry and drama.

FitzGerald died in Wellington on 2 August 1896, aged 78. He was buried in the Bolton Street Cemetery. Two of his children who both died in 1880 share the grave, as well as a female relative who died in 1886. His wife died on 8 July 1900 and is also buried in this plot. The grave is stop number 26 of the lower Bolton Memorial Trail.

<text>Ebenezer Elliott (17 March 1781 – 1 December 1849) was an English poet, known as the &quot;Corn Law rhymer&quot; for his leading the fight to repeal the Corn Laws, which were causing hardship and starvation among the poor. Though a factory owner himself, his single-minded devotion to the welfare of the labouring classes won him a sympathetic reputation long after his poetry ceased to be read.

==Early life==
Elliott was born at the New Foundry, Masbrough, in the parish of Rotherham, Yorkshire. His father, known as &quot;Devil Elliott&quot; for his fiery sermons, was an extreme Calvinist and a strong Radical. He was engaged in the iron trade. His mother suffered from poor health, and young Ebenezer, although one of eleven children, of whom eight reached maturity, had a solitary and rather morbid childhood. At the age of six he contracted smallpox, which left him &quot;fearfully disfigured and six weeks blind&quot;. His health was permanently affected, and he suffered from illness and depression in later life.

He was first educated at a dame school, then at the Hollis School in Rotherham, where he was &quot;taught to write and little more&quot;, but was generally regarded as a dunce. Moving to Thurlstone in 1790, he attended Penistone Grammar School. He hated school and preferred to play truant, spending his time exploring the countryside, observing the plants and local wildlife. At the age of 14 he began to read extensively on his own account, and in his leisure hours he studied botany, collected plants and flowers, and was delighted by the appearance of &quot;a beautiful green snake about a yard long, which on the fine Sabbath mornings about ten o&#x27;clock seemed to expect me at the top of Primrose Lane.&quot; When he was 16 he was sent to work at his father&#x27;s foundry, where he received only a little pocket money in lieu of wages for the next seven years.

==Early works==
In a fragment of autobiography printed in &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; (12 January 1850) he says that he was entirely self-taught, and attributes his poetic development to long country walks undertaken in search of wild flowers, and to a collection of books, including the works of Edward Young, Isaac Barrow, William Shenstone and John Milton, bequeathed to his father. His son-in-law, John Watkins, gave a more detailed account in &quot;The Life, Poetry and Letters of Ebenezer Elliott&quot;, published in 1850. One Sunday morning, after a heavy night&#x27;s drinking, Elliott missed chapel and visited his Aunt Robinson, where he was enthralled by some colour plates of flowers from James Sowerby&#x27;s &quot;English Botany&quot;. When his aunt encouraged him to make his own flower drawings, he was pleased to find he had a flair for it. His younger brother, Giles, whom he had always admired, read him a poem from James Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot;, which described polyanthus and auricular flowers, and this was a turning point in Elliott&#x27;s life. He realised he could successfully combine his love of nature, and his talent for drawing, by writing poems and decorating them with flower illustrations.

In 1798, aged 17, he wrote his first poem, &quot;Vernal Walk&quot;, in imitation of James Thompson. He was also influenced by George Crabbe, Lord Byron and the Romantic poets and Robert Southey, who later became Poet Laureate. In 1808 Elliott wrote to Southey asking for advice on getting published. Southey&#x27;s welcome reply began a correspondence over the years that reinforced his determination to make a name for himself as a poet. They only met once, but exchanged letters until 1824, and Elliott declared it was Southey who had taught him the art of poetry.

Other early poems were &quot;Second Nuptials and Night, or the Legend of Wharncliffe&quot;, which was described by the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; as the &quot;&quot;Ne plus ultra&quot; of German horror and bombast&quot;. His &quot;Tales of the Night&quot;, including &quot;The Exile&quot; and &quot;Bothwell&quot;, were considered to be of more merit and brought him commendations. His earlier volumes of poems, dealing with romantic themes, received much unfriendly comment, and the faults of &quot;Night&quot;, the earliest of these, were pointed out in a long and friendly letter (30 January 1819) from Southey to the author.

Elliott had married Frances (Fanny) Gartside in 1806, and they eventually had 13 children. He invested his wife&#x27;s fortune in his father&#x27;s share of the iron foundry, but the affairs of the family firm were then in a desperate condition, and money difficulties hastened his father&#x27;s death. Elliott lost everything and went bankrupt in 1816. In 1819 he obtained funds from his wife&#x27;s sisters, and began another business as an iron dealer in Sheffield. This prospered, and by 1829 he had become a successful iron merchant and steel manufacturer.

==Political activity==
When made bankrupt, Elliott had been homeless and out of work, facing starvation and contemplating suicide. He always identified with the poor. He remained bitter about his earlier failure, attributing his father&#x27;s pecuniary losses and his own to the operation of the Corn Laws, whose repeal became the greatest issue in his life.

Elliott became well known in Sheffield for his strident views on changes that would improve conditions for both manufacturers and workers, but was often disliked on this account by his fellow entrepreneurs. He formed the first society in England to call for reform of the Corn Laws: the Sheffield Mechanics&#x27; Anti-Bread Tax Society founded in 1830. Four years later, he was behind the establishment of the Sheffield Anti-Corn Law Society and the Sheffield Mechanics&#x27; Institute. He was also very active in the Sheffield Political Union and campaigned vigorously for the Reform Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 45). He was later active in Chartist agitation, acting as the Sheffield delegate to the Great Public Meeting in Westminster in 1838, and chairing the meeting in Sheffield where the Charter was introduced to local people. However, Elliott withdrew from the Sheffield organisation after the Chartist Movement advocated the use of violence.

The strength of his political convictions was reflected in the style and tenor of his verse, earning him the nickname of &quot;the Corn Law Rhymer&quot;, and making him internationally famous. After a single long poem, &quot;The Ranter&quot;, in 1830, came the &quot;Corn Law Rhymes&quot; in 1831. Inspired by a hatred of injustice, the poems were vigorous, simple and full of vivid description and campaigned politically against the landowners in the government who stifled competition and kept the price of bread high. They also heeded the dreadful conditions endured by working people and contrasted their lot with that of the complacent gentry. He went on to publish a three-volume set of the growing number of his works in &quot;The Splendid Village; Corn-Law Rhymes, and other Poems&quot; (1833–1835), which included &quot;The Village Patriarch&quot; (1829), &quot;The Ranter&quot;, &quot;Keronah&quot; and other pieces.

The &quot;Corn Law Rhymes&quot; marked a shift away from the long narratives that had preceded them, towards verses for singing that would carry a wider message to the labouring class. Several of the poems indicate the tune for them (including the Marseillaise) and one late poem at least, &quot;They say I&#x27;m old because I&#x27;m grey&quot;, was set to music by a local composer. He followed up the &quot;Rhymes&quot; of 1831 with the &quot;Corn Law Hymns&quot; of 1835, which are even more belligerent and political in spirit:
:::The locustry of Britain
:::Are gods beneath the skies;
:::They stamp the brave into the grave;
:::They feed on Famine&#x27;s sighs.

His poems by then were being published in the United States and in Europe. The French magazine &quot;Le Revue des deux Mondes&quot; sent a journalist to Sheffield to interview him. The &quot;Corn Law Rhymes&quot; were initially thought to be written by an uneducated Sheffield mechanic, who had rejected conventional Romantic ideals for a new style of working-class poetry aimed at changing the system. Elliott was described as &quot;a red son of the furnace&quot;, and called &quot;the Yorkshire Burns&quot; or &quot;the Burns of the manufacturing city&quot;. The French journalist was surprised to find Elliott a mild man with a nervous temperament.

One of Elliott&#x27;s last poems, &quot;The People&#x27;s Anthem&quot;, first appeared in Tait&#x27;s &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; in 1848. It was written for music and usually sung to the tune &quot;Commonwealth&quot;. 
:::When wilt thou save the people?
:::Oh, God of mercy! when?
:::Not kings and lords, but nations!
:::Not thrones and crowns, but men!
:::Flowers of thy heart, oh, God, are they!
:::Let them not pass, like weeds, away!
:::Their heritage a sunless day!
:::God! save the people!
The final refrain parodies the British national anthem, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, and demands support for ordinary people instead. Despite its huge popularity, some churches refused to use hymn books which contained it, as it could also be seen as a criticism of God. In his notes on the poem, Elliott demanded that votes be given to all responsible householders. The poem remained a favourite for many years, and in the 1920s it was suggested it had qualified Elliott to be Poet Laureate of the League of Nations.

The words of &quot;The People&#x27;s Anthem&quot; eventually entered the American Episcopal hymn-book. From that source it was included, along with others, in the rock musical &quot;Godspell&quot; (1971), in which it was retitled &quot;Save the People&quot;, with a new musical score.

==Literary friendships==
Elliott&#x27;s relations with like-minded writers remained close, particularly with James Montgomery and John Holland, both of whom espoused other humanitarian causes. He was also sympathetic to labouring-class poets and is recorded as being over-generous in his praise of the fledgling writing that they brought to show him. For reasons of propriety, Mary Hutton addressed herself to Mrs Elliott, although she also addresses the poet himself in one stanza of the poem of condolence she wrote on the death of two of their children. The Elliott family were subscribers to her next collection, which is dedicated to Mrs Elliott, in thanks for her sympathy and help.

Another writer with whom he became friendly when he moved to Sheffield in 1833 was the former shoemaker Paul Rodgers, who for a time became secretary of the Sheffield Mechanics&#x27; Institution. He was later to head the campaign to raise subscriptions for a statue in Elliott&#x27;s memory and wrote a memoir of him after his death. He also relates there how Elliott befriended the lecturer and writer Charles Reece Pemberton and helped to raise a subscription to support him when his health broke down. The two went on a walk together in 1838, after which Elliott recorded his impressions of &quot;Roch Abbey&quot;, praising and characterising his companion. Elliott paid Peterson a further tribute in his poem &quot;Poor Charles&quot; after Pemberton&#x27;s death two years later.

Elliot&#x27;s &quot;Song&quot; beginning &quot;Here&#x27;s a health to our friends of reform&quot;, mentions several poets among the political agitators for the Reform Act 1832, the passing of which it celebrates. Among the surnames enumerated is that of Thomas Asline Ward (1781–1871), leader of the Sheffield Political Union and editor of the &quot;Sheffield Independent&quot;. Also present is Reverend Jacob Brettel, a Unitarian minister in Rotherham who had published the poem &quot;A Country Minister&quot; (1825), and &quot;Sketches in verse, from the historical books of the Old Testament&quot; (1828). A further reference is to &quot;Holland the fearless and pure&quot;. This was not John Holland but George Calvert Holland (1801–1865), to whom Elliott&#x27;s long early poem &quot;Love&quot; was dedicated. Of labouring-class origin, he had educated himself to become a Sheffield surgeon. Elliott&#x27;s first attempt at a sonnet was also inscribed &quot;To G. C. Holland, M.D.&quot;; it was followed by a light-hearted &quot;Epistle to G. C. Holland, Esq., M.D.&quot; on women&#x27;s emancipation.

In the case of Thomas Lister (1810–1888) from nearby Barnsley, we are granted insight into an example of poetic dialogue. Elliott wrote two poems entitled &quot;To Thomas Lister&quot;. One is a stirring exhortation to take a high theme in his poetry, the other a humorous exercise in hexameters marking the measure as &quot;in English undignified, loose, and worse than the worst prose&quot;, in response to verses sent him by Lister. In 1837 Lister addressed a sonnet to Elliott &quot;From the summit of Ben Ledi&quot; while on a walking tour in Scotland.

==Final years and death==
In 1837 Elliott&#x27;s business suffered from the trade recession of that year, but he still had enough money to retire in 1841 and settle on land he had bought at Great Houghton, near Barnsley. There he lived quietly, seeing the Corn Laws repealed in 1846, and dying in 1849, aged 68. He was buried in the churchyard of All Saints Church, Darfield.

Earlier in his life, Elliott had written &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Epitaph&quot;, setting out the poetic programme for which he wished to be remembered:
::Stop, Mortal! Here thy brother lies,
::The Poet of the Poor
::His books were rivers, woods and skies,
::The meadow and the moor,
::His teachers were the torn hearts’ wail,
::The tyrant, and the slave,
::The street, the factory, the jail,
::The palace – and the grave!

News of his death brought poetic tributes: the Chartist George Tweddell (1823–1903) devoted three sonnets to him. Another Chartist who had recently become his son-in-law, John Watkins (1809–1858), described the poet&#x27;s last moments in &quot;On The Death of Ebenezer Elliott&quot;. Still another tribute with the same title came from the labouring-class poet, John Critchley Prince, in his &quot;Poetic Rosary&quot; (1850) Though honouring him as &quot;No trifling, tinkling, moon-struck Bard&quot; and &quot;The proud, unpensioned Laureate of the Poor&quot;, it also acknowledged the elemental violence of his writing. The American poet John Greenleaf Whittier&#x27;s poem &quot;Elliott&quot;, on the other hand, is as forceful as the Englishman had been, forbidding the capitalist &quot;locust swarm that cursed the harvest-fields of God&quot; to have a hand in his burial:

::Then let the poor man&#x27;s horny hands
::Bear up the mighty dead,
::And labor&#x27;s swart and stalwart bands
::Behind as mourners tread.
::Leave cant and craft their baptized bounds,
::Leave rank its minster floor;
::Give England&#x27;s green and daisied grounds
::The poet of the poor!

News of a monument to the poet to be erected in 1854 was greeted by a tribute from Walter Savage Landor to &quot;The Statue of Ebenezer Elliott by Neville Burnard, (ordered by the working men of Sheffield)&quot;, celebrating the poet and praising the city for its enterprise, in a muscular poem of radical force. Once the bronze statue was in place in Sheffield market place, the blade-maker Joseph Senior (1819–1892) made it the subject of an unrhymed sonnet, &quot;Lines on Ebenezer Elliott&#x27;s Monument&quot;. Hailing the &quot;sullen pile of hard-won toilers&#x27; pence&quot;, and equally sceptical of the work of &quot;moon-struck bards&quot;, he addressed the poet as one who &quot;by song more hungry Britons fed/ Than all the lyric sons that ever sang&quot;.

A long prose account of Elliott had appeared two years before his death in &quot;Homes and Haunts of the Most Eminent British Poets&quot; by William Howitt (1792–1879). Howitt had visited Elliott in 1846 to interview him for the article, where he praised the depictions of nature in Elliott&#x27;s earlier poems rather than the rant of his political work. After his death, Elliott&#x27;s obituary appeared in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in February 1850. Two biographies also appeared that year, one by John Watkins and another, &quot;The Life, Character and Genius of Ebenezer Elliott&quot;, by January Searle (George Searle Phillips). Two years later, Searle followed his book up with &quot;Memoirs of Ebenezer Elliott, the Corn Law Rhymer&quot;. A new edition of Elliott&#x27;s works by his son Edwin appeared in 1876.

==Legacy==
Paul Rodgers gave the opinion that Elliott &quot;has been sorely handled by the painters and engravers... The published portraits convey scarcely any idea at all of the man.&quot; Of those that remain, two have been attributed to John Birch, who also painted other Sheffield worthies. One shows him seated with a scroll in his left hand and spectacles dangling from the right. The other has him seated on a boulder, clasping an open book in his lap, with the narrow valley of Black Brook in the background. This spot above the River Rivelin was a favourite of Elliott&#x27;s, and he is said to have carved his name on a boulder there. A drawing of Elliott by the Scottish artist Margaret Gillies is now in the National Portrait Gallery, London. She had accompanied William Howitt in 1847 when he visited the poet for another interview, and her work was reproduced to illustrate it in &quot;Howitt&#x27;s Journal&quot;. Another seated portrait, book in lap, &quot;may be a better picture&quot;, thought Rodgers, &quot;but is still less like him.&quot;

Elliott is seated on a rock in Neville Burnard&#x27;s statue of him, which was also thought a poor likeness. In its issue on 22 July 1854, &quot;The Sheffield Independent&quot; reported that &quot;Many of the persons in Sheffield who have a vivid remembrance of the features of Ebenezer Elliott will feel disappointed that, in this case, the sculptor had not given a more exact similitude of the man as he lived&quot;, but goes on to surmise that this is meant to be a &quot;somewhat idealised representation of the Corn Law Rhymer&quot;. In 1875, the work was removed from the city centre to Weston Park, where it remains.

The statue figures no more clearly in John Betjeman&#x27;s poem &quot;An Edwardian Sunday, Broomhill, Sheffield&quot;. &quot;Your own Ebenezer&quot;, he apostrophizes, &quot;Looks down from his height/ On back street and alley/ And chemical valley&quot;, which he certainly does not. The poet&#x27;s final city dwelling in 1834–1841 was in Upperthorpe, not Broomhill, and bears a blue plaque today. Furthermore, the inscription on the pedestal reads simply &quot;Elliott&quot;, with no mention of his given name. This is noted, among others, by the Sheffield poet Stanley Cook (1922–1991) in his tribute to the relocated statue. &quot;It was not this dog&#x27;s convenience wrote the poems&quot;, he comments, &quot;But a man could be put together from passers-by&quot; still angry at remaining injustices.

Rotherham, Elliott&#x27;s birthplace, was slower to honour him. In 2009 a work by Martin Heron was erected on what is now known as Rhymer&#x27;s Roundabout, near Rotherham. Entitled &quot;Harvest&quot;, it depicts stylised ears of corn blowing in the wind, as an allusion to the &quot;Corn Law Rhymes&quot;. That same year the new Wetherspoons pub in Rotherham was named &#x27;The Corn Law Rhymer&#x27;, and in March 2013 a blue plaque commemorating the poet was placed on the town&#x27;s medical walk-in centre, marking the site of the iron foundry where he was born.

<text>David Gerald Unsworth (born 16 October 1973) is an English football coach and former professional footballer who was most recently the manager of Oldham Athletic. Prior to this, he was academy director and under-23s head coach at Premier League side Everton.

As a player, Unsworth played as a centre-back or left-back from 1991 until 2009. Unsworth is best remembered for his time at Everton during the 1990s, where he was part of their FA Cup-winning team of 1995 and acquired the nickname &quot;Rhino&quot;. He earned one full England cap in 1995. He also played in the Premier League for West Ham United, Portsmouth, Sheffield United and Wigan Athletic, and in the Football League for Ipswich Town, Burnley and Huddersfield Town.

After retiring, he moved into coaching with Preston North End where he was twice appointed caretaker manager. He returned to Everton in September 2013 as assistant to Everton U21s head coach Alan Stubbs, and succeeded him in 2014. He was twice named caretaker manager of the club in 2016 and 2017.

==Club career==
Born in Chorley, Lancashire, Unsworth began his career in the youth system at Everton. He made his first team debut in an away game at Tottenham Hotspur in April 1992. He made few appearances for the senior side until the appointment of Joe Royle as manager. Royle made Unsworth a regular member of the starting XI, and he was part of the 1995 FA Cup winning team. After 133 league and cup games over several impressive seasons at Everton, Unsworth transferred to West Ham United for the 1997–98 season. He made his West Ham debut on 23 August 1997 against his old club, Everton. After receiving an ovation from Everton fans, Unsworth was on the losing side as West Ham lost 2–1. After his family failed to settle in London and only one season and 41 games he asked for a move closer to his Merseyside home. Rather than moving back to Merseyside, he was signed by Birmingham-based club Aston Villa for £3 million but his family did not settle in Birmingham. After only a month, before the season had even begun, citing problems with the lengthy commute from his home, he returned to Everton who paid Villa the same £3 million West Ham had accepted only a few weeks before.

Unsworth was a consistent performer in his second spell with Everton, being first choice left-back, but also scoring some vital goals in his role as dead-ball specialist, mostly penalties. At the end of the 2003–04 season, after a further 216 games and his contract expired, a disagreement with the club over the length of a new contract led to Unsworth leaving on a free transfer.

On 12 July 2004, he was signed by Portsmouth for the 2004–05 season on a free transfer. He made his debut in a 1–1 home draw with Birmingham City, scoring the equaliser from a penalty. He also scored another spot-kick in Portsmouth&#x27;s famous 2–0 victory over Manchester United in October 2004. However, following the resignation of manager Harry Redknapp, Unsworth lost his place having played just 18 games, and spent the second half of the season on loan at Ipswich Town, making 16 appearances, scoring on his debut against Sheffield United.

On 22 August 2005, Unsworth was signed by Sheffield United on a three-year contract, on a free transfer after it became clear that Ipswich Town could not afford his wages. He was part of the team which were promoted to the Premier League as Championship runners-up at the end of the season. He missed a penalty for United in a 0–0 draw against Blackburn Rovers on 9 September 2006. Unsworth fell out of favour at Sheffield United under the management of Neil Warnock, and was placed on the transfer list in the January window.

On 5 January 2007, Unsworth signed for Wigan Athletic from Sheffield United on a free transfer. He played his first match on 13 January against Chelsea. On the last day of the 2006–07 Premier League season, in a twist of fate, Unsworth would score the penalty that sent down his former club Sheffield United, whilst simultaneously saving his new employers Wigan Athletic from relegation. Unsworth was released by Wigan at the end of the 2006–07 season on 17 May 2007.

On 11 August, he signed for Burnley on a one-year contract, scoring his first goal against Leicester City. At the end of the season, he was offered a new deal as a player-coach by manager Owen Coyle, but he rejected the offer and left the club on 30 June 2008.

On 8 August 2008, Unsworth joined Huddersfield Town on a one-year deal after impressing on trial in their pre-season. He along with five other players made his debut in a 1–1 draw against Stockport County at the Galpharm Stadium on 9 August 2008. Unsworth missed a penalty in a 2–1 defeat away at Millwall on 30 August 2008 and did not feature again. He was released from his contract on 30 March 2009 after making four appearances, and announced his retirement from football shortly afterwards.

==International career==
Unsworth was part of England&#x27;s U20 squad that finished third at the 1993 FIFA World Youth Championship in Australia, scoring the first goal in their 2–1 third-place play-off win over Australia at the Sydney Football Stadium. He played for the England under-21 team on 7 occasions between 1994 and 1995. He made a single appearance for England&#x27;s senior team, in a 2–1 victory against Japan at Wembley on 3 June 1995.

==Coaching career==
Unsworth announced his retirement on 3 April 2009. After retiring, he joined Preston North End as development coach. He was promoted to first team coach following the departure of Alan Irvine, and appointed caretaker manager on 30 December 2010 following the departure of Darren Ferguson, until the arrival of Phil Brown on 6 January 2011. On the dismissal of Brown and his assistant Brian Horton, Unsworth was appointed caretaker manager in December 2011 with Graham Alexander. On the appointment of new manager Graham Westley, Unsworth was dismissed.

He turned down the chance to manage Irish club Sligo Rovers in 2012. On 6 December 2012, Unsworth returned to former club Sheffield United as Head of Academy Coaching. Following the departure of Blades manager Danny Wilson in April 2013, Unsworth was named as assistant to caretaker-manager Chris Morgan at United. The following summer, and having reverted to his previous role following the arrival of David Weir as club manager, Unsworth was given permission to speak with Kilmarnock about their vacant managerial position. However, Unsworth rejected the approach, only to subsequently leave the Blades on 1 August 2013.

Since departing Sheffield United, he had been working alongside the Scottish FA as a course tutor and within the Everton academy system. In September 2013, he was appointed as assistant manager of the Everton U21 team, working with Alan Stubbs. In 2014, Stubbs moved to Hibernian, leaving Unsworth in charge. In May 2016, following the departure of Roberto Martínez as Everton manager, Unsworth took charge of the final game of the 2015–16 Premier League, a 3–0 win over Norwich City, alongside Joe Royle in a caretaker capacity. He returned to coaching Everton&#x27;s Under-23 team following the appointment of Ronald Koeman as first team manager. After Koeman was sacked on 23 October 2017, Unsworth again became caretaker manager of the senior side. On 12 April 2022, Unsworth left Everton in order to pursue his ambition of becoming a first-team manager.

On 20 September 2022, Unsworth was appointed manager of National League club Oldham Athletic. He lost his first game in charge, a 3–0 defeat at Bromley. After a seven game winless run, Unsworth was sacked by Oldham on 17 September 2023. His final game in charge was another 3-0 defeat at Bromley.

<text>The Chinese Football Association (), abbreviated as CFA (), is the governing body for association football, beach soccer and futsal in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (Mainland China). The CFA organizes the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams and administers the country&#x27;s professional leagues as well as organizing the national knockout cup competition Chinese FA Cup. As members of East Asian Football Federation its national teams are eligible for the East Asian Football Championship and the country&#x27;s membership in AFC allows teams to participate in that organizations club and national team competitions. China is also a member of FIFA and is therefore eligible to play in the World Cup.

==History==
Founded in 1924, the Chinese Football Association became members of FIFA in 1931 and competed internationally at the 1936 and 1948 Olympic games. Following the end of Chinese Civil War in 1949, both the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) contended to be the sole legitimate government of &quot;China&quot;, and claimed sovereignty over both mainland China and Taiwan. On 14 June 1952, FIFA acknowledged that the CFA on Mainland China, not the Republic of China Football Association (ROCFA) located on Taiwan, was the recognized authority over Chinese Football with their membership dating to 1931. Taiwan was admitted as a member of FIFA in June 1954 over the objections of the CFA and the PRC government at the 29th FIFA Congress in Bern.

The Chinese Football Association&#x27;s objection to Taiwan&#x27;s membership in FIFA continued with the organization offering proposals for the island&#x27;s expulsion at the next two FIFA Congresses in 1956 and 1958. Then on 8 July 1958 the CFA notified FIFA of its withdraw as a member of the federation. FIFA stipulations at the time required that once a withdraw be announced it must be confirmed three months later by registered mail. With no such confirmation received, FIFA&#x27;s Executive Committee still considered ACAF a member but all inquiries to the CFA or PRC were returned stating China no longer recognized FIFA&#x27;s authority. At a meeting of FIFA&#x27;s Executive Committee in late October 1959, Victor Granatkin, the USSR Vice President of FIFA, reported that from his discussions with Chinese authorities, the CFA would only rescind its withdraw after the expulsion of Taiwan from the organization. The situation was resolved at FIFA&#x27;s 42nd Congress when the Executive Committee&#x27;s compromise proposal to allow Taiwan to remain a member of FIFA under the name Chinese Taipei Football Association and to readmit the Chinese Football Association was passed on 7 July 1980.

In 1992 the CFA under the auspices of the General Administration of Sport of China released plan to improve the quality of football in the nation. The plan included hiring Klaus Schlappner to coach the national team and as a technical adviser for the football federation and had the stated goals of attempting to enter the 1994 World Cup, to be among the top five teams in the 1995 Women&#x27;s World Cup, qualify for the 1996 Olympic Games, represent Asia in the 1998 World Cup, to reach the quarter-finals of the 2000 Olympic Games, and to be among the top four teams in the 2002 World Cup. Then in 1998, the then-Minister of Sports announced a ten-year plan for Chinese football with goals to reach the World Cup finals and become one of the top sixteen teams in the world by 2002.

In 2015, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping set an aggressive plan to make the Chinese men&#x27;s national team the number one footballing nation in Asia by 2030 and the world&#x27;s number one by 2050. 

Corruption within Chinese football has factored into the program missing government targets and, in 2022, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials launched an anti-corruption probe resulting in eight footballing officials being investigated for &quot;suspected of violations of discipline and law&quot;. In August 2024, former CCP Committee Secretary of the CFA, Du Zhaocai, pleaded guilty to accepting more than US$6.1 million in bribes. On 10 September 2024, CFA banned 38 players, including former nationals, Jin Jingdao, Guo Tianyu, and five officials for life over allegations of match-fixing and other forms of corruption. Other players and officials were also given shorter five years bans.

<text>.kkrieger (from &quot;Krieger&quot;, German for warrior) is a first-person shooter video game created by German demogroup .theprodukkt (a former subdivision of Farbrausch), which won first place in the 96k game competition at Breakpoint in April 2004. The game has never been fully released, remaining instead in the beta stage of development , which renders it a perpetual beta.

==Development history==
.theprodukkt have developed &quot;.kkrieger&quot; since mid-2002, using their tool .werkkzeug (from &quot;Werkzeug&quot;, German for tool). They used an unreleased version of .werkkzeug called .werkkzeug3. The source code of both the &quot;.werkkzeug3&quot; engine and the game itself was released by the group in 2012, either under the 2-clause BSD license or as public domain.

==Procedural content==

&quot;.kkrieger&quot; makes extensive use of procedural generation methods. Textures are stored via their creation history instead of a per-pixel basis, thus only requiring the history data and the generator code to be compiled into the executable, producing a relatively small file size. Meshes are created from basic solids such as boxes and cylinders, which are then deformed to achieve the desired shape—essentially a special way of box modeling. These two-generation processes account for the extensive loading time of the game; all assets of the gameplay are reproduced during the loading phase.

The entire game uses only 97,280 bytes of disk space. In contrast, most contemporaneous first-person shooters filled one or more CDs or DVDs. According to the developers, &quot;.kkrieger&quot; itself would take up around 200–300 MB of space if it had been stored the conventional way.

The game music and sounds are produced by a multifunctional synthesizer called V2, which is fed a continuous stream of MIDI data. The synthesizer then produces the music in real time.

==Reception==
The game won two German game developer prizes at the Deutscher Entwicklerpreis in 2006, in Innovation and Advancement.

Gaming website Acid-Play gave the game 2/5 stars and a mixed review, mainly praising the game&#x27;s file size, calling it &quot;not a featureless game, but one whose limitations break barriers in terms of what can be done&quot; and ultimately stating that &quot;you’ll never find a game which has this much and comes in such a small package.&quot;

<doc id="1010897" wikidata="Q429157" url="?curid=1010897" title="Jakarta Connectors">
<text>Jakarta Connectors (JCA; formerly known as Java EE Connector Architecture and J2EE Connector Architecture) are a set of Java programming language tools designed for connecting application servers and enterprise information systems (EIS) as a part of enterprise application integration (EAI). While JDBC is specifically used to establish connections between Java applications and databases, JCA provides a more versatile architecture for connecting to legacy systems.

==JCA and Java EE==
JCA was developed through the Java Community Process, with versions including JSR 16 (JCA 1.0), JSR 112 (JCA 1.5), and JSR 322 (JCA 1.6).

J2EE Version 1.3 requires application servers to support JCA Version 1.0.

J2EE Version 1.4 requires application servers to support JCA Version 1.5.

Java EE Version 6 requires application servers to support JCA version 1.6.

==Contracts==
The Jakarta Connector Architecture defines a standard for connecting a compliant application server to an EIS. It defines a standard set of system-level contracts between the Jakarta EE application server and a resource adapter. The system contracts defined by Version 1.0 of the J2EE Connector Architecture are described by the specification as follows:
;Connection management: Connection management enables an application server to pool connections to the underlying EIS and enables application components to connect. This leads to a scalable application environment that can support a large number of clients.
;Transaction management: 

Transaction management enables an application server to use a transaction manager to manage transactions across multiple resource managers. This contract also supports transactions that are managed internal to an EIS resource manager without the necessity of involving an external transaction manager.
;Security management: Security management reduces security threats to the EIS and protects valuable information resources managed by the EIS.

JCA Version 1.5 adds system contracts to the specification as follows:
;Life cycle management: Life cycle management enables an application server to manage the life cycle of a resource adapter from initiation through upgrades to obsolescence. This contract provides a mechanism for the application server to bootstrap a resource adapter instance during its deployment or application server startup, and to notify the resource adapter instance during its withdrawal or during an orderly shutdown.
;Work management: Work management enables a resource adapter to do work (monitor network endpoints, invoke application components, and so on) by submitting work instances to an application server for execution. The application server dispatches threads to execute submitted work instances. This allows a resource adapter to avoid creating or managing threads directly, and allows an application server to efficiently pool threads and have more control over its runtime environment. The resource adapter can control the transaction context with which work instances are executed.
;Transaction inflow management: Transaction inflow management enables a resource adapter to propagate an imported transaction to an application server. This contract also allows a resource adapter to transmit transaction completion and crash recovery calls initiated by an EIS, and ensures that the Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability (ACID) properties of the imported transaction are preserved.
;Message inflow management: Message inflow management enables a resource adapter to asynchronously deliver messages to message endpoints residing in the application server, independent of the specific messaging style, messaging semantics and messaging infrastructure used to deliver messages. This contract also serves as the standard message provider pluggability contract that allows a wide range of message providers (Java Message Service (JMS), Java API for XML Messaging (JAXM), and so on) to be plugged into any Java EE compatible application server with a resource adapter.

==EIS Integration==
JCA adapters can be built to integrate with various Enterprise Information System such as Siebel Systems, SAP AG, Great Plains Systems, Oracle Applications, etc. Siebel provides API to integrate with various platforms like Java, C++, .NET, Visual Basic, etc. For Java it provides an interface called &#x27;Java Data Bean&#x27; (JDB). The Siebel adapter provides data access via the JDB API. Great Plains Systems provides an interface called eConnect to integrate with other platforms. SAP provides an interface for Java called SAP Java Connector (SAP JCo).

<doc id="1010901" wikidata="Q6784023" url="?curid=1010901" title="Mass decontamination">
<text>Mass decontamination (abbreviated mass decon) is the decontamination of large numbers of people, in the event of industrial, accidental, or intentional contamination by toxic, infective, caustic, polluted, or otherwise unhealthful or damaging substances.

==Mass hysteria and security aspects==
Scenes of &quot;mass contamination&quot; are often scenes of collective hysteria, with hundreds or thousands of victims in a state of panic. Therefore, mass decontamination may require police, security, or rescue supervision to help control panic and keep order. Under these circumstances, mass decon can take on some features of mass arrests, with victims forcibly rounded up, then treated inside impromptu detention areas. Successful municipal decontaminations are greatly aided by a close collaboration between police and fire departments. An organised, informed and aware populace can be better prepared for possible emergencies, and is less likely to panic. In some situations volunteers may be needed to augment or replace rescue/security personnel to help maintain calm and/or assist with decontamination procedures.

For example, the Australian &quot;Workplace Relations Act 1996&quot; calls for detention of victims of a hazardous materials (hazmat) incident:
* The ACTFB has also gained additional powers under the Emergencies Act 2004 to detain people at a HazMat/CBR incident.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also suggests that:
* victims... might be detained for... decontamination.

Even some of the clear-thinking subjects may resist efforts to decontaminate them. Those who know or think they have not been contaminated may resist being herded into close quarters with sick or toxin-ridden victims who still have the potential to harm those nearby. Those carrying weapons or some form of contraband may require force to part them from their contaminated clothes and effects. Others may simply fear contact with the authorities, as well as separation from family and loss of job resulting from quarantines, more than they fear the contaminant.

Military groups, church groups, Boy Scouts groups, Girl Guides, businesses, etc. can prepare for possible contaminations by performing drills of decontamination procedures. This can have the effect of decreasing the likelihood of panic, and allowing for faster, more successful decontamination.

==Mass decontamination equipment==
Mass decontamination is performed by way of decontamination tents, trailers, or fixed facilities. Most hospitals and airports have at least one mass decontamination facility. Some newer airports have a mobile facility that can generate decontamination foam in large quantities.

LAX - Los Angeles International Airport has a decontamination system with four soap cannons to spray down hysterical crowds. The facility features pop up tents so that once soaped, the victims can file on either side of the rig (one gender on each side) to rinse in specially designed showers where they can remove all clothing, dry off, and receive replacement clothing or other suitable modesty garb (i.e., makeshift clothing such as bedsheets, tablecloths, or garbage bags with head and arm cutouts).

==US Federal Guidance==
Revised procedures have been published as part of the PRISM (Primary Response Incident Scene Management) Guidance, which incorporates new evidence-based approaches to mass casualty decontamination.

<doc id="1010902" wikidata="Q19327" url="?curid=1010902" title="Kamose">
<text>Kamose was the last king of the Theban Seventeenth Dynasty at the end of the Second Intermediate Period. Kamose is usually ascribed a reign of three years (his highest attested regnal year), although some scholars now favor giving him a longer reign of approximately five years. 

He was possibly the son of Seqenenre Tao and Ahhotep I and the brother of Ahmose I, founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty. His reign is important for the decisive military initiatives he took against the Hyksos, who had come to rule much of Ancient Egypt. His father had begun the initiatives and lost his life in battle with the Hyksos. It is thought that his mother, as regent, continued the campaigns after the death of Kamose, and that his full brother made the final conquest of them and united all of Egypt.

==Campaigns==

===&quot;Casus Belli&quot;===

Kamose was the final king in a succession of native Egyptian kings at Thebes. Originally, the Theban Seventeenth dynasty rulers were at peace with the Hyksos kingdom to their north prior to the reign of Seqenenre Tao. They controlled Upper Egypt up to Elephantine and ruled Middle Egypt as far north as Cusae. Kamose sought to extend his rule northward over all of Lower Egypt. This apparently was met with much opposition by his courtiers. It appears that at some point, these princes in Thebes had achieved a practical &quot;modus vivendi&quot; with the later Hyksos rulers, which included transit rights through Hyksos-controlled Middle and Lower Egypt and pasturage rights in the fertile Delta. Kamose&#x27;s records on the &quot;Carnarvon Tablet&quot; (in the text also parallelled in the Thebes stelae of Kamose) relate the misgivings of this king&#x27;s council to the prospect of a war against the Hyksos: 

However, Kamose&#x27;s presentation here may be propaganda designed to embellish his reputation since his predecessor, Seqenenre Tao, had already been engaged in conflict with the Hyksos (for unknown reasons), only to fall in battle. Kamose sought to regain by force what he thought was his by right, namely the kingship of Lower and Upper Egypt. The king thus responds to his council: 

There is no evidence to support Pierre Montet&#x27;s assertion that Kamose&#x27;s move against the Hyksos was sponsored by the priesthood of Amun as an attack against the Seth-worshippers in the north (i.e., a religious motive for the war of liberation). The &quot;Carnarvon Tablet&quot; does state that Kamose went north to attack the Hyksos by the command of Amun, but this is common to virtually all royal inscriptions of Egyptian history, and should not be understood as the specific command from this deity. Kamose states his reasons for an attack on the Hyksos was nationalistic pride.

===Northern Campaign===
In Kamose&#x27;s third year, he embarked on his military campaign against the Hyksos by sailing north out of Thebes on the Nile. He first reached Nefrusy, which was just north of Cusae and was manned by an Egyptian garrison loyal to the Hyksos. A detachment of Medjay troops attacked the garrison and overran it. The Carnarvon Tablet recounted this much of the campaign, but breaks off there. Nonetheless, Kamose&#x27;s military strategy probably can be inferred. As Kamose moved north, he could easily take small villages and wipe out small Hyksos garrisons, but if a city resisted, he could cut it off from the rest of the Hyksos kingdom simply by taking over the city directly to the north. This kind of tactic probably allowed him to travel very quickly up the Nile. The second stele of Kamose (found in Thebes) continues Kamose&#x27;s narrative with an attack on Avaris. Because it does not mention Memphis or other major cities to the north, it has long been suspected that Kamose never did attack Avaris, but instead recorded what he intended to do. Kim Ryholt recently has argued that Kamose probably never advanced farther than the Anpu or Cynopolis Nome in Middle Egypt (around the Faiyum and the city of Saka) and did not enter either the Nile Delta, nor Lower Egypt proper. 
According to the second stele, after moving north of Nefrusy, Kamose&#x27;s soldiers captured a courier bearing a message from the Hyksos king Awoserre Apopi at Avaris to his ally, the ruler of Kush, requesting the latter&#x27;s urgent support against Kamose. Kamose promptly ordered a detachment of his troops to occupy and destroy the Bahariya Oasis in the western desert, which controlled the north–south desert route. Kamose, called &quot;the Strong&quot; in this text, ordered this action to protect his rearguard. Kamose then sailed southward, back up the Nile to Thebes, for a joyous victory celebration after his military success against the Hyksos in pushing the boundaries of his kingdom northward from Cusae past Hermopolis through to Sako, which now formed the new frontier between the seventeenth dynasty of Thebes and the fifteenth dynasty Hyksos state.

Ryholt notes that Kamose never claims in his second stela to attack anything &quot;in&quot; Avaris itself, only &quot;anything belonging to Avaris (&quot;nkt hwt-w&#x27;rt&quot;, direct genitive) i.e., the spoil [of war] which his army has carried off&quot; as lines 7–8 and 15 of Kamose&#x27;s stela—the only references to Avaris here—demonstrate:

Line 7–8: &quot;I placed the brave guard-flotilla to patrol as far as the desert-edge with the remainder (of the fleet) behind it, as if a kite were preying upon the territory of Avaris.&quot;

Line 15: &quot;I have not overlooked anything belonging to Avaris, because it (the area which Kamose was plundering) is empty.&quot;

The Second Stela of Kamose is well known for recounting that a Hyksos messenger was captured with a letter from Apophis—appealing for aid from the king of Kush against Kamose—while travelling through the western desert roads to Nubia. The final evidence that this king&#x27;s military activities affected only the Cynopolite nome, and not the city of Avaris itself, is the fact that when Kamose returned the letter to Apophis, he dispatched it to Atfih which is about a hundred miles south of Avaris. Atfih, hence, formed either the new border or a &quot;no-man&#x27;s land&quot; between the now shrunken Hyksos kingdom and Kamose&#x27;s expanding seventeenth dynasty state. Furthermore, Kamose states in his second stele that his intention in returning the letter was for the Hyksos messenger to inform Apophis of the Theban king&#x27;s victories &quot;in the area of Cynopolis which used to be in his possession.&quot; This information confirms that Kamose confined his activities to this Egyptian nome and never approached the city of Avaris itself in his Year 3.

===First Nubian Campaign===

Kamose is known to have campaigned against the Kushites prior to his third year since the Hyksos king directly appeals to his Kushite counterpart to attack his Theban rival and avenge the damage which Kamose had inflicted upon both their states. It is unlikely that Kamose had the resources to simultaneously defeat the Kushites to the south and then inflict a serious setback on the Hyksos to the north in just one year over a front-line that extended over several hundred kilometres.

==Length of reign==

His Year 3 is the only attested date for Kamose and was once thought to signal the end of his reign. However, it now appears certain that Kamose reigned for one or two more years beyond this date because he initiated a second campaign against the Nubians. Evidence that Kamose had started a first campaign against the Kushites is affirmed by the contents of Apophis&#x27; captured letter where the Hyksos king&#x27;s plea for aid from the king of Kush is recounted in Kamose&#x27;s Year 3 Second stela:

Two separate rock-inscriptions found at Arminna and Toshka, deep in Nubia, give the prenomen and nomen of Kamose and Ahmose side by side and were inscribed at the same time—likely by the same draughtsman—according to the epigraphic data. In both inscriptions &quot;the names of Ahmose follow directly below those of Kamose and each king is given the epithet di-ˁnḫ, &quot;Given Life&quot;, which was normally used only of ruling kings. This indicates that both Kamose and Ahmose were ruling when the inscriptions were cut and consequently that they were coregents. Since Kamose&#x27;s name was recorded first, he would have been the senior coregent. However, no mention or reference to Ahmose as king appears in Kamose&#x27;s Year 3 stela which indirectly records Kamose&#x27;s first campaign against the Nubians; this can only mean that Kamose appointed the young Ahmose as his junior coregent sometime after his third year prior to launching a second military campaign against the Nubians. As a result, Kamose&#x27;s second Nubian campaign must have occurred in his Year 4 or 5. The target of Kamose&#x27;s second Nubian campaign may have been the fortress at Buhen which the Nubians had recaptured from Kamose&#x27;s forces since a stela bearing his cartouche was deliberately erased and there is fire damage in the fort itself. 

A slightly longer reign of five years for Kamose has now been estimated by Ryholt and this ruler&#x27;s timeline has been dated from 1554 BC to 1549 BC to take into account a one year period of coregency between Ahmose and Kamose. Donald Redford notes that Kamose was buried very modestly, in an ungilded stock coffin which lacked even a royal uraeus. This may imply that the king died before he had enough time to complete his burial equipment presumably because he was engaged in warfare with his Kushite and Hyksos neighbours.

==Mummy==
The mummy of Kamose is mentioned in the Abbott Papyrus, which records an investigation into tomb robberies during the reign of Ramesses IX, about 400 years after Ahmose&#x27;s interment. While his tomb was mentioned as being &quot;in a good state&quot;, it is clear that his mummy was moved at some point afterward, as it was discovered in 1857 at Dra&#x27; Abu el-Naga&#x27;, seemingly deliberately hidden in a pile of debris. The painted and stuccoed coffin was uncovered by early Egyptologists Auguste Mariette and Heinrich Brugsch, who noted that the mummy was in very poor shape. Buried with the mummy was a gold and silver dagger, amulets, a scarab, a bronze mirror, and a pectoral in the shape of a cartouche bearing the name of his successor and brother, Ahmose. 

The coffin remains in Egypt, while the dagger is in Brussels and the pectoral and mirror are in the Louvre, Paris. The name of the pharaoh inscribed on the coffin was only recognized fifty years after the original discovery, by which time the mummy, which had been left with the pile of debris on which it was found, was almost certainly long lost.

== Stelae ==
Kamose erected two stelae in Thebes that seem to tell a consecutive narrative of his defeat of the Hyksos. The first stele is missing its last part.

The Carnarvon Tablet also preserves some of the text of the stelae.

===Identification===
As early as 1916, Sir Alan Gardiner assumed that the First Carnarvon Tablet must be a copy of some commemorative stela of pharaoh Kamose. This was later confirmed when French Egyptologists Lacau and Chévrier were working in Karnak, and made an important discovery of two stela fragments. The smallest of them was found in 1932. And in 1935, the larger fragment appeared. Thus, it emerged that the Carnarvon Tablet text was copied from Kamose&#x27;s stelas. These newer texts were published in 1939.

===Other discoveries===
More recently, some other inscriptions of Kamose were found.

:&quot;Only two stelae of Kamose were known until recently [2016], one of them was also copied to a Dynasty 18 writing table [Carnarvon Tablet] (Redford 1997: nos. 68-69). In 2004 a fragmented inscription with the Two Ladies name of Kamose was found in Karnak and labeled the third stela of Kamose (Van Siclen 2010), and in 2008 a further inscription of Kamose was found in Armant (Thiers 2009).&quot;

<doc id="1010906" wikidata="Q2233534" url="?curid=1010906" title="Hinxworth">
<text>Hinxworth is a village and civil parish in North Hertfordshire, England. It sits just off the Great North Road between Baldock and Biggleswade. It has a village hall, a park, a pub, a small church, a bus stop and a post box. The population at the 2011 Census was 313.

==History and Geography==
The name of the village has variously been recorded as Haingesteworde, Hainsteworde, Hamsteworde (in the 11th century); Hingslewurd (12th century); Hengsteworth, Hyngstrigge, Heynceworth (13th century); Hangteworth, Hynxworth (14th century); Hyggextworth, Hyngxtworth (15th century); and Henxworth (16th century).

The parish of Hinxworth is in the extreme north of the county on the border with Bedfordshire. It lies low, the ground nowhere rising more than above mean sea level. The ancient track called The Ridgeway crosses the low land to the east of the parish, running parallel with the River Rhee, which forms the north-east boundary. The area of the parish is , most of which is arable land, the remainder woodland and pasture. The soil is loam and blue clay, the subsoil varies. The chief crops are wheat, barley, field beans and oilseed rape. Coprolites have been dug in the parish and are still to be found. An Act authorizing enclosure of the common fields was passed in 1802 and the award was made in 1806.

The nearest railway stations are Baldock, to the south and Ashwell to the southeast, both on the Hitchin and Cambridge branch of the Great Northern Railway.

The Great North Road skirts the parish on the west and forms its southwest boundary. Not far from this road, on the borders of Hinxworth and Caldecote, Roman remains were discovered in about 1720 by workmen who were digging there for gravel with which to repair the road. These included several human bodies, urns, paterae and other objects, with a Danish or Dutch coin. In 1810 a further find of great interest was made in the parish of two rare Greek coins or medals, one of Mithridates King of Pontus, and the other of Perseus King of Macedonia, both very well preserved.

Near the River Rhee in the north of the parish and not far from the camp at Arbury Banks or Harboro, and near the Ridgeway, a hoard of more than 500 Roman coins was discovered. Near them were found other Roman remains.

The village of Hinxworth lies a mile and a half to the east of the Roman road, with which it is connected by roads leading northwest and southwest, the former continuing to Ashwell. The 14th century St Nicholas&#x27; church and former rectory stand on the southeast of the angle formed by the road to Ashwell and that leading southwest to the Roman road, and the village lies a little to the northwest of the church.

At the beginning of the 18th century, it had only thirty-five houses, of which three were almshouses.

Hinxworth is home to &#x27;Hinxworth Archers&#x27;, one of the few Archery clubs in the area.

The medieval manor house Hinxworth Place is about half a mile southwest of the village.

==Governance==
Hinxworth has three tiers of local government at parish, district and county level: Hinxworth Parish Council, North Hertfordshire District Council, and Hertfordshire County Council.

Hinxworth is an ancient parish, and it was part of the hundred of Odsey. Hinxworth was included in the Royston Poor Law Union from 1835. The Local Government Act 1894 created parish and district councils. Hinxworth was included in Ashwell Rural District from 28 December 1894. Despite the name, Ashwell Rural District Council was based in the town of Royston. Hinxworth&#x27;s population at the time was below threshold to be given a parish council, and so it had a parish meeting to take over the secular functions of the parish vestry. A parish council was established by 1939. Ashwell Rural District was abolished in 1935, becoming part of Hitchin Rural District, which in turn was abolished in 1974, becoming part of North Hertfordshire.

==Notable residents==
The author Monica Dickens lived in a cottage in the village for four years from 1947 to 1951. Here she wrote her novels &quot;Flowers on the Grass&quot; (1949) and &quot;My Turn to Make the Tea&quot; (1951), the latter based on her experiences as a reporter working on the &quot;Hertfordshire Express&quot; in Hitchin. While in Hinxworth she was the Treasurer of the annual Ashwell Horse Show and President of the Hinxworth Cricket Club, having bought maroon blazers for all the team, the umpire and the Club Secretary.

The notable 16/17th century land owner Sir Thomas Golding of Poslingford, Suffolk also owned lands at Hinxworth.

The sculptor John W Mills currently lives in Hinxworth.

<text>C&#x27;mon, C&#x27;mon is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow, released on April 8, 2002, in the United Kingdom and April 16, 2002 in the United States. Lead single &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart and No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming one of her biggest hits since &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;. The album was arguably her most pop-influenced to date, a big departure from the folk and rock sound on her previous release, &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot;.

&quot;C&#x27;mon, C&#x27;mon&quot; debuted at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 185,000 copies in the United States. The album has been certified Platinum in the US and Japan, selling 2.1 million units in the US as of January 2008. The song &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; is dedicated to Crow&#x27;s former boyfriend Owen Wilson and is an account of their relationship.

<text>(abbreviated as NBCUEJ) is a Japanese music, anime, and home entertainment production and distribution enterprise that is a subsidiary of NBCUniversal, owned by American telecommunications/media company Comcast headquartered in Akasaka, Minato, Tokyo. It is primarily involved in the production and distribution of anime within Japan.

The company was founded in March 1981 by Pioneer Corporation as LaserDisc Corporation, a LaserDisc player production company. In 1989, the company was renamed Pioneer LDC, Inc. as it branched into the anime, music, and film industries, and later Geneon Entertainment Inc. (after being acquired by Dentsu in 2003). In 2008, Geneon merged with Universal Pictures Japan to form Geneon Universal Entertainment Japan, LLC; in 2013, the company changed its name to the current NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan. Some of the well-known anime series the company has produced are &quot;A Certain Magical Index&quot;, &quot;The Heroic Legend of Arslan&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Golden Kamuy&quot;, &quot;Seraph of the End&quot;, and &quot;Is the Order a Rabbit?&quot; among many others.

Despite the name, NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan does not distribute Universal Pictures films theatrically in Japan; Toho (through Toho-Towa) exclusively distributes them for Japanese theaters.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
Pioneer Corporation founded the in March 1981 to produce LaserDisc players in Japan. The LaserDisc Corporation changed its name to in 1989 as part of an attempt to branch off into the anime, film, and music industries. As Pioneer LDC, they developed and published several video games for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation, such as games based on &quot;Magical Girl Pretty Sammy&quot;, &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot;, and &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;.

In December 1985, Pioneer LDC made an effort to expand into the North American business, by establishing a subsidiary in the region named LaserDisc Corporation of America in an effort to consolidate the Pioneer Video and Pioneer Audio units, who maintained the Pioneer Artists label, which was initially based near New Jersey, following the introduction of a combined CD/laserdisc player.

In late 1991, Pioneer LDC established a European division, Pioneer LDCE (short for LaserDisc Corporation of Europe), hoping to revive interest of Laserdiscs in the European market after Philips&#x27; Laserdisc players flopped in Europe. Around the same time, the company begin licensing titles from Guild Film Distribution to release 140 films to Laserdisc for the United Kingdom market, and additionally licensed titles from VCL Communications/Carolco Pictures to release 20 titles to the German market.

In 1992, LaserDisc released their first anime title &quot;Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki&quot;.
On July 21, 2003, the company was acquired by Japanese advertising and marketing company firm Dentsu and renamed to , while its North American division, Pioneer Entertainment, was renamed Geneon USA.

=== Sale to NBC Universal ===

On November 12, 2008, Dentsu announced that it was selling 80.1% of its ownership in the company to NBC Universal&#x27;s Universal Pictures International Entertainment (UPIE), who planned to merge the company with its Universal Pictures Japan division—which had no longer theatrically distributed Universal Pictures films in Japan, having delegated its theatrical distribution tasks to Toho subsidiary Toho-Towa since the dissolution of United International Pictures Japan in 2007—to form a new company. The merger later closed, with the new company known as . On December 9, 2013, the company once again changed its name to NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan LLC.

On February 17, 2013, they made a partnership with Universal Sony Pictures Home Entertainment to distribute their anime titles directly in Australia and New Zealand.

=== Purchase of Paramount Japan ===
On January 1, 2016, Paramount Japan was purchased by NBCUniversal and dissolved shortly afterwards. This was due to Paramount Pictures establishing a joint-venture with Toho-Towa named Towa Pictures Company Limited, which would distribute Paramount&#x27;s films in Japan.

On July 12, 2017, they announced a partnership with Crunchyroll to co-produce anime with &quot;international appeal&quot;.

<text>The tittle or superscript dot is the dot on top of lowercase &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;. The tittle is an integral part of these glyphs, but diacritic dots can appear over other letters in various languages. In most languages, the tittle of &quot;i&quot; or &quot;j&quot; is omitted when a diacritic is placed in the tittle&#x27;s usual position (as í or ĵ), but not when the diacritic appears elsewhere (as į, ɉ).

==Use==
The word &quot;tittle&quot; is rarely used. One notable occurrence is in the King James Bible at Matthew 5:18: &quot;For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled&quot; (KJV). The quotation uses &quot;jot and tittle&quot; as examples of extremely small graphic details in &quot;the Law&quot;, presumably referring to the Hebrew text of the Torah. In English the phrase &quot;jot and tittle&quot; indicates that every small detail has received attention.

The Greek terms translated in English as &quot;jot&quot; and &quot;tittle&quot; in Matthew 5:18 are &quot;iota&quot; and &quot;keraia&quot; (). Iota is the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet (ι); the even smaller iota subscript was a medieval innovation. Alternatively, &quot;iota&quot; may represent yodh (י), the smallest letter of the Hebrew and Aramaic alphabets (to which &quot;iota&quot; is related). &quot;Keraia&quot; is a hook or serif, and in Matthew 5:18 may refer to Greek diacritics, or, if the reference is to the Hebrew text of the Torah, possibly refers to the pen strokes that distinguish between similar Hebrew letters, e.g., ב (Bet) versus כ (Kaph), or to ornamental pen strokes attached to certain Hebrew letters, or to the Hebrew letter Vav, since in Hebrew &quot;vav&quot; also means &quot;hook&quot;. &quot;Keraia&quot; in Matt. 5:18 cannot refer to vowel marks known as Niqqud, which developed later than the date of Matthew&#x27;s composition. Others have suggested that &quot;Keraia&quot; refers to markings in cursive scripts of languages derived from Aramaic, such as Syriac, written in Serṭā (, &#x27;short line&#x27;). In printing modern Greek numerals a keraia is used.

Tittles also exist in Cyrillic.

==Dotless and dotted i==



A number of alphabets use dotted and dotless I, both upper and lower case.

In the modern Turkish alphabet, the absence or presence of a tittle distinguishes two different letters representing two different phonemes: the letter &quot;I&quot; / &quot;ı&quot;, with the absence of a tittle also on the lower case letter, represents the close back unrounded vowel , while &quot;İ&quot; / &quot;i&quot;, with the inclusion of a tittle even on the capital letter, represents the close front unrounded vowel . This practice has carried over to several other Turkic languages, like the Azerbaijani alphabet, Crimean Tatar alphabet, and Tatar alphabet.

In some of the Dene languages of the Northwest Territories in Canada, specifically North Slavey, South Slavey, Tłı̨chǫ and Dëne Sųłıné, all instances of &quot;i&quot; are undotted to avoid confusion with tone-marked vowels &quot;í&quot; or &quot;ì&quot;. The other Dene language of the Northwest Territories, Gwich’in, always includes the tittle on lowercase &quot;i&quot;.

There is only one letter I in Irish, but &quot;i&quot; is undotted in the traditional uncial Gaelic script to avoid confusion of the tittle with the &quot;buailte&quot; overdot found over consonants. Modern texts replace the &quot;buailte&quot; with the letter &quot;h&quot;, and use the same antiqua-descendant fonts, which have a tittle, as other Latin-alphabet languages. Bilingual road signs formerly used dotless i in lowercase Irish text to better distinguish &quot;i&quot; from &quot;í&quot;. The letter &quot;j&quot; is not used in Irish other than in foreign words.

In most Latin-based orthographies, the lowercase letter &quot;i&quot; conventionally has its dot replaced when a diacritical mark atop the letter, such as a tilde or caron, is placed. The tittle is sometimes retained in some languages. In some Baltic languages sources, the lowercase letter &quot;i&quot; sometimes retains a tittle even when accented. In Vietnamese in the 17th century, the tittle is preserved atop &quot;ỉ&quot; and &quot;ị&quot; but not &quot;ì&quot; and &quot;í&quot;, as seen in the seminal &quot;quốc ngữ&quot; reference &quot;Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum&quot;. In modern Vietnamese, a tittle can be seen in &quot;ì&quot;, &quot;ỉ&quot;, &quot;ĩ&quot;, and &quot;í&quot; in cursive handwriting and some signage. This detail rarely occurs in computers and on the Internet, due to the obscurity of language-specific fonts. In any case, the tittle is always retained in &quot;ị&quot;.

A particular and unique variant is in the Johnston typeface, long employed by and proprietary to the Transport for London organisation and its associates, in print and notices, where above a certain point size the dot (and full stop) are diamond shaped, this being among the most distinguishing features of the font.

==Phrases==
* It is thought that the phrase &quot;to a T&quot; is derived from the word tittle because long before &quot;to a T&quot; became popular, the phrase &quot;to a tittle&quot; was used.
* The phrase &quot;&quot; is used figuratively to mean &quot;to put the finishing touches to&quot; or &quot;to be thorough&quot;.

<text>Mark Williams is an English comic actor, presenter and screenwriter. He first achieved widespread recognition as one of the central performers in the BBC sketch show &quot;The Fast Show&quot;. His film roles include Horace in &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1996) and Arthur Weasley in seven of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. He appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. Since 2013, Williams has portrayed the title character in the long-running BBC series loosely based on the &quot;Father Brown&quot; short stories by G. K. Chesterton.

==Early life==
Williams was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, and grew up in Sidemoor. He was educated at North Bromsgrove High School and then Brasenose College, Oxford, where he graduated in English in 1978.

==Career==
Williams&#x27; acting work began in small-scale touring theatre, and he worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company and National Theatre.

Williams came to wider public attention in the 1990s through the BBC sketch comedy programme &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, in which he was one of the central performers. He has said that for a while &quot;people seemed to assume I was a comedian, which I&#x27;ve never been&quot;.

He played Arthur Weasley in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, making his first appearance in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; in 2002. Other high-profile appearances include the film adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Stardust&quot; alongside Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert De Niro and Claire Danes in 2007 and a 2012 role in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as Brian Williams, father of the Doctor&#x27;s companion, Rory.

Since 2013, he has appeared in the lead role in the BBC costume drama &quot;Father Brown&quot;. Williams also featured in the first series of &quot;Blandings&quot;, the BBC TV adaptation of the P. G. Wodehouse Blandings Castle stories, broadcast in 2013, in which he played Beach, the Emsworths&#x27; tipsy butler. Interviewed in 2014 by the &quot;Lancashire Evening Post&quot;, when asked if some people still saw him as a comedy actor, Williams replied, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s only a few people in the BBC. In America, they see me as a major British character actor, but unfortunately, the BBC is pretty parochial and people are institutionalised here.&quot;

In 2014 and 2015, he presented the BBC daytime game show &quot;The Link&quot;. The show ran for two series. His other film roles include &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; and &quot;The Borrowers&quot;, both with Hugh Laurie.

Williams has also presented several documentary programmes exploring industrial history which is his passion; &quot;Mark Williams&#x27; Big Bangs&quot; on the history of explosives, a follow-up to the previous series &quot;Mark Williams on the Rails&quot;, &quot;Industrial Revelations&quot; and &quot;More Industrial Revelations&quot;.

<doc id="1010930" wikidata="Q4355169" url="?curid=1010930" title="Kenneth McKellar (politician)">
<text>Kenneth Douglas McKellar (January 29, 1869 – October 25, 1957) was an American politician from Tennessee who served as a United States Representative from 1911 until 1917 and as a United States Senator from 1917 until 1953. A Democrat, he served longer in both houses of Congress than anyone else in Tennessee history.

Only a few other congressmen in American history have served longer in both houses.

==Early life and career==
McKellar was a native of Dallas County, Alabama. He graduated from the University of Alabama in 1891 and its law school in 1892.

He moved to Memphis, Tennessee and is related to Henry Nickey, an MUS Basketball star, and was admitted to the state bar the same year. McKellar joined the Democratic Party, which dominated the politics of West Tennessee, where plantations were historically and economically important. He was first elected to the House in a special election in November 1911 to succeed George W. Gordon in Tennessee&#x27;s 10th congressional district, which included Memphis. He won the seat in his own right in 1912 and was reelected in 1914, serving until his election to the United States Senate.

He was a presidential elector in 1904.

==United States Senate==
McKellar ran for the Senate in 1916, defeating incumbent Senator Luke Lea in the Democratic primary and winning the general election against former Republican Governor Ben W. Hooper. He was reelected to the Senate in 1922 (defeating former Senator Newell Sanders), 1928 (defeating former U.S. Assistant Attorney General James Alexander Fowler), 1934 (again defeating Ben Hooper), 1940 (against Howard Baker, Sr., father of future Senator Howard Baker), and 1946 when he defeated William B. Ladd.

McKellar was considered a moderate progressive in his early days in the Senate, and he supported many of President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s reform initiatives as well as ratification of the Treaty of Versailles. During President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration, McKellar staunchly supported the New Deal, especially the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), to provide flood control and generate hydropower for rural electrification in the Tennessee Valley. McKellar was close ally of Memphis Democratic political boss E. H. Crump.

Kenneth McKellar was a crusader for free trade; he supported the repeal of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff after 1930. Despite his early support for the policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR), McKellar became more conservative in his political stances. He opposed several of the administration&#x27;s appointments. He had a prolonged feud with FDR&#x27;s appointee to head the TVA, David E. Lilienthal.

As ranking member of the Appropriations Committee McKellar, who was an avid supporter of property rights, successfully forced the TVA to properly reimburse landowners whose property was taken over by the TVA for such purposes as dam building and creation of lakes or reservoirs. Prior to McKellar&#x27;s threats to withhold Federal appropriations for the purchase of uranium early in World War II, the TVA was commonly offering to give landholders &quot;pennies on the dollar&quot; for their properties. As head of the Appropriations Committee, McKellar knew about the appropriations needed for the Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb. He was often called upon to &quot;keep the secret&quot; of the Manhattan Project by mingling funds for the bomb project with other projects, or through carefully planned (secret) War Projects Funding. As the Tennessee Valley Authority was centered in Tennessee, his home state, McKellar reacted to what he thought was harsh TVA treatment of his constituents as a personal affront by Lilienthal.

McKellar&#x27;s threat to withhold funding for purchases of uranium had a much deeper meaning, though. Lilienthal was also closely associated with the Manhattan Project&#x27;s work to electromagnetically enrich uranium, coincidentally at the facility later known as Y-12. Ernest Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;electromagnetic&quot; enrichment of uranium at Oak Ridge would eventually use the electricity created by the TVA to enrich the uranium used in the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. By threatening to withhold funding for the purchase of uranium, McKellar was demonstrating to Lilienthal that the politician, as ranking member and Acting Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, held the power. He forced Lilienthal to have the TVA pay fair market value for land it appropriated.

McKellar twice served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate. Beginning in 1945, he was the first to hold the position under the seniority system that has prevailed since of reserving it for the majority party. When Harry Truman became president in April 1945, upon FDR&#x27;s death, the vice presidency became vacant. (The mechanism for filling intra-term vacancies had not yet been created by the 25th Amendment.) McKellar became the permanent Presiding Officer of the United States Senate.

Also, as the President pro tempore of the Senate had, prior to 1886, been second in the presidential line of succession, behind only the vice president, Truman viewed McKellar as the logical wartime replacement for himself, and asked McKellar to attend all Cabinet meetings. In 1947 Truman successfully lobbied Congress to pass a new Presidential Succession Act, restoring both the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate to the succession ahead of Cabinet secretaries. By the time the law came into effect, McKellar was no longer in the position of President pro tempore, as the Republicans had gained the majority in the 80th Congress. Truman vetoed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 to restrict labor unions, which McKellar had favored. Truman selected Alben Barkley of Kentucky as his running mate in the 1948 presidential election. When Democrats regained control of the Senate following the 1948 elections, McKellar again became President pro tempore. He was second in line for the presidency (behind the Speaker of the House) from January 3, 1949 until January 20, 1949, when Alben Barkley took office as Vice President of the United States.

McKellar also served as chairman of the Civil Service Committee, Post Office and Road Committee, and, most notably, the powerful Appropriations Committee from 1945–1947, and again from 1949–1953.

===Longevity===
McKellar is the only Tennessee senator to have completed more than three full terms. Except for McKellar, Tennessee has generally not joined in the Southern tradition of reelecting senators for protracted periods of service.

Before the era of popular election of U.S. Senators, Senator William B. Bate was elected to a fourth term by the Tennessee General Assembly, but he died five days into this term, while Senator Isham G. Harris also died early in his fourth term. Senator Joseph Anderson was elected by the General Assembly to three full terms plus the balance of the term of William Blount, who had been expelled from the Senate.

==1952 election==

In 1952 McKellar stood for a seventh term (the first Senator to do so), despite being 83. He was opposed for renomination by Middle Tennessee Congressman Albert Gore. McKellar&#x27;s reelection slogan was &quot;Thinking Feller? Vote McKellar&quot;, which Gore countered with &quot;Think Some More – Vote for Gore.&quot; Gore defeated McKellar for the Democratic nomination in August in what was widely regarded as something of an upset. At this point in Tennessee history, the Democratic nomination for statewide office was still &quot;tantamount to election.&quot; Most African Americans had been disenfranchised by discriminatory laws and practices, resulting in the Republican Party being active chiefly in East Tennessee. This had been the case since the Civil War. Gore served three full terms in the Senate.

McKellar&#x27;s defeat was part of a statewide trend of change in 1952. That year incumbent governor of Tennessee Gordon Browning was defeated by Frank G. Clement. Browning, who had served a total of three terms as governor, the last two successive, had also at one point been a close ally of Crump&#x27;s but had since broken ranks with him. As Clement and Gore were both considerably younger and regarded as more progressive than their predecessors, some historians cite the 1952 elections as an indication that Tennessee entered into the &quot;New South&quot; era of Southern politics earlier than most of the other Southern states.

==Legacy==
McKellar wrote a book about his Tennessee predecessors in the Senate called &quot;Tennessee Senators as Seen by One of Their Successors&quot; (1942). In recent years it has been updated by one of his successors, former Senate Majority Leader Dr. Bill Frist.

Lake McKellar, bordering the Memphis President&#x27;s Island industrial area along the Mississippi River and McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport (originally &quot;McKellar Field&quot;) in Jackson, Tennessee (&quot;MKL&quot;) are both named in his honor.

McKellar died on October 25, 1957. He is interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

==Representation in other media==
Some have speculated that Senator McKellar was the inspiration for the character South Carolina Senator Seabright Cooley in Allen Drury&#x27;s novel &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;.

McKellar was portrayed by actor/country singer Ed Bruce in the film &quot;Public Enemies&quot; (2009) and Michael O&#x27;Neill in the film &quot;J. Edgar&quot; (2011).

<text>The League Championship Series (LCS) is the semifinal round of postseason play in Major League Baseball which has been conducted since 1969. In 1981, and since 1995, the two annual series have matched up the winners of the Division Series, and the winners advance to meet in the World Series. The LCS comprises the American League Championship Series (ALCS) and National League Championship Series (NLCS).
==History==
The League Championship Series was created in , when both the National League and the American League increased in size from ten teams to twelve with the addition, via expansion, of the Montreal Expos and San Diego Padres to the former and the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Pilots (now the Milwaukee Brewers of the NL) to the latter. Both leagues then formed Eastern and Western Divisions, the first-place teams from which faced off in the LCS.

For its first sixteen seasons, the League Championship Series were best-of-five, using the format in which the team without home field advantage hosted the first two games, and the team with it hosted the rest of the LCS, making it impossible for the disadvantaged team to win the series at home. It also allowed those teams the unusual luxury of starting a series at home, possibly having home-field advantage in a three-game series, and a guarantee that they play two games at home.

In , the LCS was lengthened to best-of-seven games in the format with the team holding home-field advantage opening the series at home and playing the next three games on the road, before returning home for two more possible games. The disadvantaged team would have had more games played at home than on the road if the series ends in five games.

Since , the LCS has matched up the winners of the Division Series, which were added when both leagues realigned into three divisions.

Until , the home-field advantage in the LCS was allocated on a rotating basis between the two (three from 1995 through ) division champions; since 1998, that advantage is given to the team with the better regular season record, except that if a division champion faces a wild card team, the division champion always gets home-field advantage regardless of record.

As of , all thirty MLB teams have reached the LCS at least once. The Houston Astros and Milwaukee Brewers are the only teams to have played in both the ALCS and NLCS. Four teams have never lost an LCS: the Colorado Rockies (won in 2007), the Miami Marlins (won as the Florida Marlins in 1997 and 2003), the Tampa Bay Rays (won in 2008 and 2020), and the Texas Rangers (won in 2010, 2011, and 2023).

<text>Donald Yetter Gardner (August 20, 1913 – September 15, 2004) was an American songwriter who is best known for writing the classic Christmas novelty song &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Gardner was born in Portland, Pennsylvania. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music from West Chester University.

== Career ==
Gardner wrote &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth&quot; in 1944 while teaching music at public schools in Smithtown, New York. He asked the class what they wanted for Christmas and noticed that almost all of them had at least one front tooth missing and answered with a lisp. Gardner wrote the song in 30 minutes. In a 1995 interview, Gardner said, &quot;I was amazed at the way that silly little song was picked up by the whole country.&quot; The song was published in 1948 after an employee of Witmark music company heard Gardner sing it at a music teachers&#x27; conference.

The song was introduced in 1948 by singing group The Satisfiers on Perry Como&#x27;s radio show, and originally recorded for RCA Victor by Spike Jones and His City Slickers on December 6, 1947, with lead vocal by George Rock. The record reached the top of the pop charts in 1948, and again in 1949. The song was also recorded by numerous other singers and performers, including George Strait, The Platters, The Andrews Sisters, Nat King Cole, and the cast of &quot;Sesame Street.&quot;

Gardner later became a music consultant for a major music publisher in Boston, Ginn &amp; Company, wrote songs for music textbooks, and composed numerous hymns. His published hymns include &quot;Man Shall Not Live by Bread Alone but by Every Word of God&quot; and &quot;Oh, Give Thanks Unto the Lord.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Gardner died at age 91 from complications after falling at his home in Needham, Massachusetts, outside of Boston.

<text>The Division Series is the quarterfinal round of the Major League Baseball postseason. Four series are played in this round, two each for both the American League and the National League.

==1981 season==
The first use of the term &quot;Division Series&quot; dates from 1981, when due to a mid-season players&#x27; strike, that season was divided into two halves, with the winners of each half from each division (West and East at the time) playing one another in a best-of-five series to decide which team would represent that division in the League Championship Series (this format being common in minor-league baseball). But because the two halves of the season were independent of one another, the winner of the first half had no real incentive to try to win the second half as well (since, unlike in the minor leagues, if the same team did win both halves it was not given a bye into the next round), and a team that won neither half could have actually had the best overall record in the division; indeed, the latter actually occurred, as the Cincinnati Reds and the St. Louis Cardinals had the two best won-lost records (in both halves of the season combined) in the National League West and East respectively, with the Reds having the best overall winning percentage in all of Major League Baseball, yet neither advanced to the playoffs because they finished second in their divisions in each half. Until the 2012 format revision, this was the only Division Series which actually consisted of teams from the same division playing each other. This particular Division Series was meant as a one-off series due to the strike.

==1993–1994: Proposal, realignment, and cancellation of 1994 postseason==
In 1993, the owners approved the reintroduction of the Division Series, this time on a permanent basis, given the fact that three of the four series in the one-off 1981 Division Series went to a game 5. Originally, the format called for the top team in the AL East to play the 2nd place team in the AL West and vice versa. In 1994, both the National League and the American League realigned, with the number of divisions in both increasing from two to three (adding a Central Division, with fewer teams in each division). At the same time, the number of teams qualifying for baseball&#x27;s postseason was doubled, from four to eight; henceforth the three first-place teams from each league&#x27;s divisions would reach the postseason, along with one wild card team from each league (the latter being the second-place finisher with the best regular-season record). However, this expanded playoff format did not return until the following year, because a players&#x27; strike, which began on August 12, 1994, led to the cancellation of that season&#x27;s playoffs and World Series (and caused the 1995 regular season to have 18 fewer games for each team than the standard 162 [for a total of 144 games]).

==1995–1997: Pre-arranged seeding==
Since its inception, the Division Series has been best-of-five; however, both the method of awarding home-field advantage in the series and which games the team getting the advantage would host were changed in 1998.

Originally, the East, Central, and West Division champions rotated home-site priority, with two division winners getting the extra home game, and third one not having the extra game along with the wild-card team, who never had it. The 2–3 format was used in which the disadvantaged team hosted the first two games, and the team with the advantage hosted the remaining game(s). This made it impossible for the disadvantaged team to clinch the series at home. A similar format had been used for the League Championship Series from 1969 to 1984. It also allowed the disadvantaged teams the unusual luxury of starting a series at home, and a guarantee that they play two games at home, whereas the advantaged team may play only one game at home if the series ends in a three-game sweep.

==1998–2011==
The two division champions with the best regular-season records have been accorded with the home-field advantage, forcing the worst division winner to play an extra road game. Also, the format changed to a 2–2–1 layout with the team having home-field advantage hosting Games 1, 2, and (if necessary) 5. In both the AL and the NL, the three division champions were automatically given the top three seeds, seeded #1–3 based on record, and the wild-card was given the 4th seed regardless of record. In both the AL and the NL, the #1 seed played the #4 seed and the #2 seed played the #3 seed, unless the #1 and #4 seed were in the same division. Because teams from the same division couldn&#x27;t play each other in the first round, if the normal matchups would cause this, then the #1 seed played the #3 seed, and the #2 seed played the #4 seed. In all cases, the top two seeds had home-field advantage.

From 2007–2011, the #1 seed of the league that won the All-Star Game was given another advantage. In addition to earning home-field advantage throughout the entire playoffs, they were allowed to choose their schedule for the series. They could either choose to have an extra day off (usually between games 1 and 2) during the series and start a day early, or start a day late, with one less off day (only having travel days off, between games 2 and 3, and if necessary 4 and 5). The American League&#x27;s best record received this option from 2007–2009 and the National League&#x27;s best record received it in 2010.

==2012–2019, 2021==
A revised playoff system was utilized beginning with the 2012 season, which added a second wild-card team for each league. The two wild card teams in each league played a one game playoff to advance. The winner of this game advanced to play the #1 seed in the league in the Division Series, regardless of whether the two teams were in the same division. Because the format was added well after the regular season schedule was announced, the 2012 Division Series used a 2–3 format. From 2013 to 2021, the Division Series used the 2–2–1 format previously used.

==2020==
The postseason was modified from its usual format due to the temporary expansion of the playoffs for the 60-game regular season. After a best-of-three Wild Card Series, the winners of the 1/8 matchup faced the winners of the 4/5 matchup while the 2/7 faced the 3/6. Each of the four matchups were played in consecutive days at neutral sites, with the usual 2–2–1 structure used to determine the designated home teams. When every team from the Central divisions lost, it meant that all four Division Series matchups would feature teams from the same division playing each other (i.e. East playing East and West playing West), the first occasion of this happening since 1981.

==Since 2022==
With the expansion of the postseason to six teams per league since the season, only the two best division winners earn byes to the Division Series. The wild card round was expanded to a best-of-three series and the winners of that round advance to the Division Series. In this round, the #1 seed faces the 4/5 winner, and the #2 seed plays the 3/6 winner; the bracket does not re-seed.

==Criticism of scheduling==
There has been some criticism on how Major League Baseball schedules Division Series games. Teams with large national fan followings like the New York Yankees are almost always scheduled to play in prime time at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT to generate the highest TV ratings. As a result, West Coast teams generally have to play on the road in the afternoon, when many of their fans are unable to watch the game because they are at work or school. Conversely, when games on the West Coast are played at 10 p.m. ET/7 p.m. PT, many fans on the East Coast are unable to watch a game in its entirety, due to work or school the next day and games ending around 1 a.m. ET/10 p.m. PT, while most West Coast fans are able to watch the entire game as it will not end as late on the West Coast.

However, in 1995, (as aforementioned, the 1994 series was not played due to the strike), the Division and League Championship Series was aired by the league&#x27;s television operation, The Baseball Network, a joint syndication package between ABC and NBC. In order to increase viewership, all games were played in primetime at consistent times, and each affiliate of the network carrying the series could only air one of the games each night, determined by the station&#x27;s area. While this prevented the issue of afternoon games (and did, as planned, increase viewership), the plan drew ire from critics for not allowing viewers to choose the games they want to watch during the post-season.

<text>Ohain (; ) is a Belgian village and district of the municipality of Lasne, Wallonia in the province of Walloon Brabant.

== History ==
In the Middle Ages, the village of Ohain was part of a seigneury of the Duchy of Brabant. Duke Jean II transferred the seigneury to a vassal around 1300, and in the 15th century, it became the property of Jean Hinckaert, bastard of Brabant, whose heirs resided here until the castle burned down in the 16th century. The château underwent several alterations in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the village boasts a former communal house dating from 1827. During the World War II, this house hosted secret meetings of politicians and trade unionists.

<doc id="1010962" wikidata="Q2461104" url="?curid=1010962" title="Turret ship">
<text>Turret ships were a 19th-century type of warship, the earliest to have their guns mounted in a revolving gun turret, instead of a broadside arrangement.

==Background==

Before the development of large-calibre, long-range guns in the mid-19th century, the classic ship of the line design used rows of port-mounted guns on each side of the ship, often mounted in casemates. Firepower was provided by a large number of guns which could only be aimed in a limited arc from one side of the ship. Due to instability, fewer larger and heavier guns can be carried on a ship. Also, the casemates often sat near the waterline, which made them vulnerable to flooding and restricted their use to calm seas.

Turrets were weapon mounts designed to protect the crew and mechanism of the artillery piece and with the capability of being aimed and fired in many directions as a rotating weapon platform. This platform can be mounted on a fortified building or structure such as an anti-naval land battery, or on a combat vehicle, a naval ship, or a military aircraft.

==Origins==
Designs for a rotating gun turret date back to the late 18th century. Practical rotating turret warships were independently developed in Great Britain and the United States with the availability of steam power in the mid-19th Century.

===British developments===
During the Crimean War, Captain Cowper Phipps Coles of the British Royal Navy constructed a raft with guns protected by a &#x27;cupola&#x27; and used the raft, named &quot;Lady Nancy&quot;, to shell the Russian town of Taganrog in the Black Sea. &quot;Lady Nancy&quot; &quot;proved a great success&quot;, and Coles patented his rotating turret after the war. Following Coles&#x27; patenting, the British Admiralty ordered a prototype of Coles&#x27; design in 1859, which was installed in the floating battery vessel, , for trials in 1861, becoming the first vessel to be fitted with a revolving gun turret. Coles&#x27; design aim was to create a ship with the greatest possible all round arc of fire, as low in the water as possible to minimise the target.

The British Admiralty accepted the principle of the gun turret as a useful innovation, and incorporated it into other new designs. Coles submitted a design for a ship having ten domed turrets each housing two large guns. The design was rejected as impractical, although the Admiralty remained interested in turret ships and instructed its own designers to create better designs.

Coles enlisted the support of Prince Albert, who wrote to the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Duke of Somerset, supporting the construction of a turret ship. In January 1862, the Admiralty agreed to construct a ship, , which had four turrets and a low freeboard, intended only for coastal defence. Coles was allowed to design the turrets, but the ship was the responsibility of the chief Constructor Isaac Watts.

Another of Coles&#x27;s designs, , was completed in August 1864. Its existing broadside guns were replaced with four turrets on a flat deck and the ship was fitted with of armour in a belt around the waterline. Early ships like and &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; had little sea-keeping qualities being limited to coastal waters. Coles, in collaboration with Sir Edward James Reed, went on to design and build , the first seagoing warship to carry her guns in turrets. Laid down in 1866 and completed in June 1869, it carried two turrets, although the inclusion of a forecastle and poop deck prevented the guns firing fore and aft.

===American developments===

The gun turret was independently invented by the Swedish inventor John Ericsson in the United States. Ericsson designed USS &quot;Monitor&quot; in 1861. Erickson&#x27;s most prominent design feature was a large cylindrical gun turret mounted amidships above the low-freeboard upper hull, also called the &quot;raft&quot;. The raft extended well past the sides of the lower, more traditionally shaped lower hull. A small armoured pilot house was fitted on the upper deck towards the bow, however, its position prevented &quot;Monitor&quot; from firing her guns straight forward. One of Ericsson&#x27;s prime goals in designing the ship was to present the smallest possible target to enemy gunfire.

The turret&#x27;s rounded shape helped to deflect cannon shot. A pair of donkey engines rotated the turret through a set of gears; a full rotation was made in 22.5 seconds during testing on 9 February 1862. This design was technologically inferior to Coles&#x27;, and made fine control of the turret difficult. If turret rotation overshot its mark it was difficult to make a correction. Either the engine would have to be placed in reverse or another full rotation was necessary.

Including the guns, the turret weighed approximately ; the entire weight rested on an iron spindle that had to be jacked up using a wedge before the turret could rotate. The spindle was in diameter, which gave it ten times the strength needed in preventing the turret from sliding sideways. When not in use, the turret rested on a brass ring on the deck that was intended to form a watertight seal. In service, however, this proved to leak heavily, despite caulking by the crew. The gap between the turret and the deck proved to be a problem as debris and shell fragments entered the gap and jammed the turrets of several s, which used the same turret design, during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863. Direct hits at the turret with heavy shot also had the potential to bend the spindle, which could also jam the turret.

The turret was intended to mount a pair of smoothbore Dahlgren guns, but they were not ready in time and guns were substituted. Each gun weighed approximately . &quot;Monitor&quot;″s guns used the standard propellant charge of specified by the 1860 ordnance for targets &quot;distant&quot;, &quot;near&quot;, and &quot;ordinary&quot;, established by the gun&#x27;s designer Dahlgren himself. They could fire a round shot or shell up to a range of at an elevation of +15°.

==Culmination==

 of 1871 and of 1872 represented the culmination of this pioneering work. These ironclad turret ships were designed by Edward James Reed. They were also the world&#x27;s first mastless battleships, built with a central superstructure layout, and became the prototype for all subsequent warships, leading directly to the modern battleship.

== Surviving examples ==
*The only preserved steam and sail turret ship in Europe is the mid 19th century Dutch ironclad HNLMS &quot;Schorpioen&quot;.
*The Chilean and Peruvian flagship &quot;Huascar&quot; is a memorial at Talcahuano.
*A replica of the Chinese battleship &quot;Dingyuan&quot; was built as a museum ship in 2003.

<text>Pungent Stench is a death metal band from Vienna, Austria, formed in 1988. Their current lineup consists of Martin Schirenc (vocals/guitar), Jacek Perkowski (bass), and Mike G. Mayhem (drums). Pungent Stench achieved prominence in the death metal scene due to their unique style of extreme metal and controversial lyrics, a blend of gore, paraphilia, and black comedy. They dissolved in 1995, re-formed in 1999, then split up again 2007 after recording a final studio album, eventually released in 2018, and re-formed again in 2013 as “The Church Of Pungent Stench” and renamed themselves again as “Schirenc Plays Pungent Stench” in 2014”

==History==
===Early years (1987-1989)===
Pungent Stench began in late 1987 when Martin Schirenc and Alex Wank, drummer from Carnage, got together to form a new band. They recruited Jacek Perkowski for the bass player position after months of searching, and by February 1988 the trio started rehearsing together. Barely a month in existence the band had already composed 10 songs, and by April 1988 the band recorded their first demo tape, &quot;Mucous Secretion&quot;. Recorded live in their rehearsal room, &quot;Mucous Secretion&quot; featured 5 tracks plus an intro taken out of the first &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; movie. The tape got very positive reactions from the tapetrading community.

In July 1988, the band travelled to England to record their second demo. Wank was present as a guest during the mixing of Napalm Death&#x27;s sophomore album, &quot;From Enslavement to Obliteration&quot;, at the Birdsong Studios in Worcester. After that he booked 2 days for Pungent Stench in the same studio. The band had plans to release this demo in a professional manner, with a printed cover and manufactured tapes, but before the manufacturing process began Pungent Stench got an offer by Nuclear Blast.

===Nuclear Blast (1989-1994)===

Pungent Stench happened to play close by Nuclear Blast&#x27;s hometown, Donzdorf. The label&#x27;s staff had already heard about the band and sent someone to watch their show and express the record company&#x27;s interest in the group. Pungent Stench signed the contract in April 1989 and their first release for Nuclear Blast, a split album with fellow Austrian death metallers Disharmonic Orchestra, came out in June. The record was reasonably successful, moving more than 4,000 units in less than a year. The &quot;Extreme Deformity&quot; 7-inch vinyl EP, featuring three tracks from their unreleased demo, came out in September to rave reviews.

====&quot;For God Your Soul... For Me Your Flesh&quot;====

Pungent Stench&#x27;s debut &quot;For God Your Soul... For Me Your Flesh&quot; was released in April 1990. Described as raw and primitive, it shows the band favoring simple song structures and visceral, demented aggression over technical proficiency and over-complicated soloing. The album&#x27;s title track made it to the &quot;100 Best Death Metal Songs&quot; list compiled by the German version of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;.

Around the time their first record came out, Pungent Stench were already an experienced live band, having played with Carcass, Entombed, Napalm Death, Extreme Noise Terror, Atrocity and Prong, among others. By the end of the year they organized their first, six-week European tour (named the &quot;Fleisch Tour&quot;), with Master headlining and Paul Speckmann&#x27;s thrash metal side project Abomination as the opening act.

==Musical style and influences==
Pungent Stench were initially inspired by early grindcore (Repulsion, Napalm Death, Terrorizer), death metal (Master, Autopsy, Slaughter, Deceased) and doom metal bands such as Saint Vitus and Witchfinder General. By the time of &quot;For God Your Soul... For Me Your Flesh&quot;&#x27;s release their listening habits widened considerably. In an interview to Michigan-based fanzine &quot;Rot&quot;, drummer Alex Wank declared that he was currently into hardcore punk (Sheer Terror, Agnostic Front), industrial music (Swans, Laibach, Coil, Foetus), black metal (Mayhem, Darkthrone, Beherit), alternative metal pioneers Faith No More and &quot;rape rock&quot; group The Mentors.

Though Pungent Stench is a death metal band, its musical style has also been influenced by rock and blues. Such non-metal influences can be heard on songs such as &quot;Viva la muerte&quot;, &quot;Madcatmachopsychoromantik&quot;, &quot;Family Man&quot; and &quot;Got MILF?&quot;. Schirenc&#x27;s choice of guitar (he often plays a Fender Telecaster, a rarity among metal guitarists) probably signals these influences.

==Lyrical content==
The lyrical content of the songs is more sexually and paraphilia orientated and tends to contrast the more horror and gore influenced themes of other death metal bands; themes covered include acrotomophilia, sadomasochism, coprophagia, rape,and deviance, which at times can be seen as off-putting to fans of death metal. The album covers reflect this as well: many of their album covers are transgressive and sometimes shocking photos by Joel-Peter Witkin. This, combining the musical styles of death metal and grindcore, may have influenced the sexually-oriented themes of pornogrind, a subgenre of grindcore.

<doc id="1010965" wikidata="Q3595608" url="?curid=1010965" title="R. Umanath">
<text>R. Umanath (21 December 1921 – 21 May 2014) was a communist politician from Tamil Nadu, India, and a Politburo member of Communist Party of India (Marxist) from 1998. He was born in 1921 in Kasaragod, Kerala and moved to Madras during his student days.

==Early days==
Born in a poor Brahmin family in Kasaragod, Umanath learnt to play harmonium to accompany his mother who eked out a livelihood as a Bhajan singer. While his family had hoped that Umanath, a student of Annamalai University, would land in a good job, he disappointed them by quitting his studies to become a full-time member of the Communist party.

He joined the Communist Party of India in 1939 while studying at the Annamalai University in Tamil Nadu. He left his studies to become a whole-timer of the Party.

Umanath was arrested along with P. Ramamurthi in 1940 in connection with the Madras Conspiracy Case, and jailed for three years. He spent nine and a half years in jail, and another seven years underground.

==Role in Parliamentary politics==
He was elected to the 3rd and 4th Lok Sabhas from the Pudukkottai in 1962 and 1967. He was elected to the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly as a Communist Party of India (Marxist) candidate from Nagapattinam in 1977 and 1980 elections.

==Stalwart in Communist Party==
A trade union leader for many years, Umanath is a former vice-president of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions. He was one of the founders of the CITU and the first general secretary of the organisation in the State. He remained the President of the state CITU for years. He served as one of the Vice Presidents of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions till 2010.

Umanath was also a Tamil Nadu State Committee secretary of CPI(M). He was firmly opposed to LTTE and Tamil separatism in Sri Lanka. In 1991, he was elected to the Polit Bureau and served in that capacity till 2008. He was a member of the Central Committee of the Party from 1978 to 2012.

He died on 21 May 2014 in Tiruchirappalli.

His wife was the reputed communist leader Pappa Umanath. U. Vasuki, who is also the CPI(M) state secretariat member is his daughter.

<doc id="1010966" wikidata="Q7011590" url="?curid=1010966" title="New South">
<text>New South, New South Democracy or New South Creed is a slogan in the history of the American South first used after the American Civil War. Reformers used it to call for a modernization of society and attitudes, to integrate more fully with the United States as a whole, reject the economy and traditions of the Old South, and the slavery-based plantation system of the prewar period. The term was coined by its leading spokesman, Atlanta editor Henry W. Grady in 1874.

==Etymology and philosophy==
The original use of the term &quot;New South&quot; was an attempt to prescribe an attractive future based on a growing economy. The industrial revolution of the Northern U.S. was the model. The prewar South was heavily agrarian. Following the American Civil War, the South was impoverished and heavily rural; it was mainly reliant on cotton and a few other crops with low market prices. Economically, it was in great need of industrialization. With slavery abolished, African Americans were playing a different role in the New South. Henry W. Grady made this term popular in his articles and speeches as editor of the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;. Richard Hathaway Edmonds of the Baltimore &quot;Manufacturers&#x27; Record&quot; was another staunch advocate of New South industrialization. &quot;The Manufacturers&#x27; Record&quot; was one of the most widely read and powerful publications among turn of the 20th-century industrialists. Historian Paul Gaston coined the specific term &quot;New South Creed&quot; to describe the promises of visionaries like Grady, who said industrialization would bring prosperity to the region.

The classic history was written by C. Vann Woodward: &quot;The Origins of the New South: 1877–1913&quot;, published in 1951 by Louisiana State University Press. Sheldon Hackney, a Woodward student, hails the book but explains:
The New South campaign was championed by Southern elites often outside of the old planter class. Their hopes were to make a fresh &quot;new&quot; start, forming partnerships with Northern capitalists in order to modernize and speed up economic development of the South. From Henry Grady to Black leader Booker T. Washington, New South advocates wanted southern economic regeneration, sectional reconciliation, racial harmony, and believed in the gospel of work.

The rise of the New South, however, involved the continued supremacy of whites over blacks, who had little or no political power once Reconstruction was over, Federal troops were withdrawn from the South as a result of the Compromise of 1877, and Jim Crow laws were put in place to suppress black rights . For example, Grady stated in an 1888 speech about the New South, &quot;The supremacy of the white race of the South must be maintained forever, and the domination of the negro race resisted at all points and at all hazards because the white race is the superior race ... [This declaration] shall run forever with the blood that feeds Anglo-Saxon hearts.&quot;

==History==
===Great Depression and World War II===
The economic woes of the Great Depression dampened much New South enthusiasm, as investment capital dried up and the rest of the nation began to view the South as an economic failure. World War II would usher in a degree of economic prosperity as efforts to industrialize in support of the War effort were employed. In the southern mountains, the Tennessee Valley Authority built dams, which generated employment and electricity that affected numerous residents and manufacturers alike. Other Southern industries, such as mining, steel and ship building, flourished during World War II, and set the stage for increased industrialization, urban development, and economic prosperity in Southern ports and cities in the second half of the 20th century.

In the post-World War II era, American textiles makers and other light industries moved en masse to the South to capitalize on low wages, social conservatism, and anti-union sentiments. With the industrialization of the South came economic change, migration, immigration and population growth. Light industries would move offshore, but has been replaced to a degree by auto manufacturing, tourism, and energy production, among others.

=== Civil Rights era ===
The beginnings of the Civil Rights era in the 1950s and 1960s, led to a revival of the term to describe a South that would no longer be held back by Jim Crow Laws and other aspects of compulsory legal segregation. Racist conflicts during the Civil Rights Movement gave the American South a backward image in popular culture. Again, the initial slow pace of civil rights reforms, notably in the areas of school desegregation and voting rights, at first made the &quot;New South&quot; more of a slogan than a description of the South as it actually was. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 would bring an era of far more rapid change. During the 1960s, the black population finally began being enfranchised and represented in political offices.

=== Political uses ===
For over 100 years, from before the Civil War until the mid-1960s, the Democratic Party exercised a virtual monopoly on Southern politics, which came to be known as the Solid South. Thus elections were actually decided between Democratic factions in primary elections, often all white. The Democratic nomination was considered to be tantamount to election.

The &quot;New South&quot; period is double-edged. After the passage of civil rights legislation, African Americans began to vote in number for the Democratic Party. Many had supported Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs, along with Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson who had supported their causes. At the same time, in 1964, several white Southern politicians and state voters supported Republican Barry Goldwater for President over Democratic incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson. In what later became a trend, some switched party affiliations, notably Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. Richard Nixon&#x27;s Southern strategy in the 1968 campaign is thought by many to have vastly accelerated this process. From Nixon&#x27;s time to the present, the South has often voted Republican at the presidential level.

The term &quot;New South&quot; has also been used to refer to political leaders in the American South who embraced progressive ideas on education and economic growth and minimized racist rhetoric, even if not promoting integration. This term was most commonly associated with the wave of Southern governors elected in the late 1960s and 1970s, including Terry Sanford in North Carolina, Carl Sanders and Jimmy Carter in Georgia, and Albert Brewer in Alabama.

Similarly, the term &quot;New South&quot; has also been used to refer to areas of the South that have become more diverse and cosmopolitan over the last several decades.

=== Modern economy ===
The &quot;New South&quot; also meant to describe economic growth in the American South. Since the late 20th century, this can be seen in many ways. The largest company in the world by revenue is Walmart, which is located in Bentonville, Arkansas. Two of the largest U.S. banks, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, have a major presence in Charlotte, North Carolina. Bank of America is headquartered there, and Wells Fargo has maintained much of the operation of Wachovia after acquiring it in 2008. Charlotte is also home to many other major corporations including Lowe&#x27;s, Duke Energy, Family Dollar, Lendingtree and Honeywell.

Automotive manufacturing plants in U.S. have declined in cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, and St. Louis, while lower wage, non-unionized work forces in the American South have attracted foreign manufacturers. Automobile manufacturers BMW, Toyota, Mercedes, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan, and Volkswagen have opened plants in states such as Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Mississippi, and West Virginia. Meanwhile, General Motors factories continue to operate in Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas, and two Ford factories operate in Kentucky&#x27;s largest city of Louisville.

High-profile companies such as IBM, Intel, Verizon and Microsoft have major corporate presence in the Research Triangle of North Carolina. Additionally, several Fortune 500 companies, including Tesla, Inc. and a number of technology companies, are now headquartered in Austin, Texas, giving it the nickname of &quot;Silicon Hills&quot;.

American Airlines Group, the largest airline in the world as of 2019, is headquartered in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex in Fort Worth. Dallas is also home to many global corporations, including the largest energy company in the world ExxonMobil, the largest Telecommunication company in the world AT&amp;T, and the company where the microchip was first invented Texas Instruments. The Dallas-Fort Worth metro area is also the largest metro area in the South.

Delta Air Lines, one of the world&#x27;s largest airlines, is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Atlanta is also home to many global corporations, including The Coca-Cola Company, UPS, CNN, Norfolk Southern, NCR, Mercedes-Benz, and Porsche.

<doc id="1010971" wikidata="Q138979" url="?curid=1010971" title="Nephrite">
<text>Nephrite is a variety of the calcium, magnesium, and iron-rich amphibole minerals tremolite or actinolite (aggregates of which also make up one form of asbestos). The chemical formula for nephrite is Ca2(Mg, Fe)5Si8O22(OH)2. It is one of two different mineral species called jade. The other mineral species known as jade is jadeite, which is a variety of pyroxene. While nephrite jade possesses mainly grays and greens (and occasionally yellows, browns, black or whites), jadeite jade, which is rarer, can also contain blacks, reds, pinks and violets. Nephrite jade is an ornamental stone used in carvings, beads, or cabochon cut gemstones. Nephrite is also the official state mineral of Wyoming.

Nephrite can be found in a translucent white to very light yellow form which is known in China as &quot;mutton fat&quot; jade, in an opaque white to very light brown or gray which is known as &quot;chicken bone&quot; jade, as well as in a variety of green colors. Western Canada is the principal source of modern lapidary nephrite. Nephrite jade was used mostly in pre-1800 China as well as in New Zealand, the Pacific Coast and Atlantic Coasts of North America, Neolithic Europe, and southeast Asia.

==Name==
The name &quot;nephrite&quot; is derived from the Latin , which in turn is derived from the Ancient Greek () or λίθος (), which means &quot;kidney stone&quot; and is the Latin and Greek version of the Spanish (the origin of &quot;jade&quot; and &quot;jadeite&quot;). Accordingly, nephrite jade was once believed to be a cure for kidney stones.

===Other names===
Besides the terms already mentioned, nephrite has the following synonyms and varieties: &quot;axe-stone&quot;, &quot;B.C. jade&quot;, &quot;Beilstein&quot;, &quot;kidney stone&quot;, , &quot;nephrite&quot;, &quot;nephrite&quot;, , &quot;New Zealand greenstone&quot;, &quot;New Zealand jade&quot;, &quot;spinach jade&quot; (dark grayish green), and . &quot;Tomb jade&quot; or &quot;grave jade&quot; are names given to ancient burial nephrite pieces with a brown or chalky white texture as a surface treatment.

==History==
===Neolithic and Chalcolithic Europe===

A lot of nephrite tools and amulets are known since the Early Neolithic (7th millennium BC) to the Late Chalcolithic (5th millennium BC) on the Balkans (mainly Bulgaria; also in Greece, Serbia, Croatia) from two or more unknown sources — Balkan &quot;nephrite culture.&quot; Such tools are found in the Later Neolithic of Poland (from the most probable local source Jordanów), Sardinia (Italy) (unknown source) and Switzerland. Single or just a few finds of nephrite artifacts are also reported from some other European countries.

===Prehistoric and historic China===
During Neolithic times, the key known sources of nephrite jade in China for utilitarian and ceremonial jade items were the now depleted deposits in the Ningshao area in the Yangtze River Delta (Liangzhu culture 3400–2250 BC) and in an area of the Liaoning province in Inner Mongolia (Hongshan culture 4700–2200 BC). Jade was used to create many utilitarian and ceremonial objects, ranging from indoor decorative items to jade burial suits. Jade was considered the &quot;imperial gem.&quot; From about the earliest Chinese dynasties until present, the jade deposits in most use were from the region of Khotan in the Western Chinese province of Xinjiang (jade deposits from other areas of China, such as Lantian, Shaanxi, were also in great demand). There, white and greenish nephrite jade is found in small quarries and as pebbles and boulders in the rivers flowing from the Kuen-Lun mountain range northward into the Takla-Makan desert area. River jade collection was concentrated in the Yarkand, and the White Jade (Yurungkash) and Black Jade (Karakash) Rivers in Khotan. From the Kingdom of Khotan, on the southern leg of the Silk Road, yearly tribute payments consisting of the most precious white jade were made to the Chinese imperial court and there transformed into by skilled artisans, as jade was considered more valuable than gold or silver.

===Prehistoric Taiwan and Southeast Asia===

Carved nephrite jade was the main commodity trade during the historical Maritime Jade Road, an extensive trading network connecting multiple areas in Southeast and East Asia. The nephrite jade was mined in east Taiwan by animist Taiwanese indigenous peoples and processed mostly in the Philippines by animist indigenous Filipinos. Some were also processed in Vietnam, while the peoples of Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Cambodia also participated in the massive animist-led nephrite jade trading network, where other commodities were also traded. Participants in the network at the time had a majority animist population. The maritime road is one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world. It was in existence for at least 3,000 years, where its peak production was from 2000 BCE to 500 CE, older than the Silk Road in mainland Eurasia. It began to wane during its final centuries from 500 CE until 1000 CE. The entire period of the network was a golden age for the diverse animist societies of the region.

===Māori===

Nephrite jade in New Zealand is known as in the Māori language and is highly valued, playing an important role in Māori culture. It is considered a , or treasure, and therefore protected under the Treaty of Waitangi. The exploitation of it is restricted to the &quot;iwi&quot; (tribe) and it is closely monitored. The South Island of New Zealand is in Māori — &#x27;The [land of] Greenstone Water&#x27; — because that is where it occurs.

Weapons and ornaments are made of it; in particular the (short club) and the (neck pendant). These are believed to have their own (prestige), are handed down as valuable heirlooms, and often given as gifts to seal important agreements. It has also been used for a range of tools such as adzes and was used to make nails used in construction, as Māori culture had no metalworking before European contact.

Commonly called &quot;greenstone,&quot; jade jewellery in Māori designs is widely popular with tourists. Stone is often imported from Canada, China and Siberia, and runs a pounamu certification scheme to verify the authenticity of New Zealand stone.

<text>West Hampstead is an area in the London Borough of Camden in north-west London. Mainly defined by the railway stations of the same name, it is situated between Childs Hill to the north, Frognal and Hampstead to the north-east, Swiss Cottage to the east, South Hampstead to the south-east and Kilburn to the west and south-west. The neighbourhood is mainly residential, with several local amenities, including a range of independent shops, supermarkets, restaurants, bars, cafes and bakeries; most of these are concentrated in the northern section of West End Lane and around West End Green. Located in travel zone 2, West Hampstead has excellent transport links, and is served by three stations: West Hampstead on the Jubilee line, West Hampstead Overground station and West Hampstead Thameslink station.

==History==
===West End hamlet===
An area, known as &quot;le Rudyng&quot; (indicating a woodland clearing) in the mid-13th century, had by 1534 come to be called West End. It was then a freehold estate belonging to Kilburn Priory, and was so called because it was at the west end of another, larger estate. Although it is possible that there was a dwelling on the estate prior to 1244, an estate house was certainly extant by 1646. West End Lane (named as such by 1644), the main road through the area, is still bent at a right-angle at the north and south ends where it connects to Finchley Road and Edgware Road respectively. This is because the lane used to form the boundary between a number of different estates.

By the early 17th century several houses were present, and by the middle of that century London merchants were building larger houses in the area. By 1800 West End was a hamlet of two to three dozen houses and cottages located in parkland, mostly on the west side of West End Lane and Fortune Green Lane, and north of the present-day railway lines. West End Lane had been rerouted, making it straighter and lying further to the west than previously. In 1851 residents were mainly agricultural labourers, gardeners, craftsmen and tradespeople, with an innkeeper, two beershop keepers, a schoolmistress and a few gentry. There were three main large houses: West End House, West End Hall and Lauriston Lodge.

===West Hampstead===
Transformation of the area started with the construction of three railway lines across West End Lane: Hampstead Junction Railway, built by 1857; Midland line, opened in 1868; and Metropolitan &amp; St. John&#x27;s Wood line, opened in 1879. &quot;West Hampstead&quot; was the name adopted by Metropolitan &amp; St. John&#x27;s Wood for its station on West End Lane. The period of greatest development in the area was the 15 years from the opening of that station, with estates on the west side of West End Lane being turned from farmland and parkland into housing estates. In 1897 large-scale development started on the east side of West End Lane, where three large houses, West End Hall, Canterbury House and Treherne House, had stood until then.

==Notable buildings and sites==
* Emmanuel Church, an Anglican church on the corner of Lyncroft Gardens, opened in 1903.
* Hampstead Cemetery on Fortune Green Road, opened in 1876
* Hampstead Cricket Club moved to Lymington Road in 1877.
* Hampstead Synagogue on Dennington Park Road, built on the site of Lauriston Lodge, opened in 1892.
* Lilian Baylis House at 165 Broadhurst Gardens, opened in the 1880s. It was originally the Falcon Works, a place for tradespeople to work from. A few years later it was turned into a venue for concerts, meetings and other gatherings and named West Hampstead Town Hall. In 1928, Crystalate Gramophone Record Manufacturing took it over and moved its recording studio there. In 1937, Decca took it over and the building became Decca Studios until 1980. Artists including David Bowie and the Rolling Stones recorded there, but the Beatles failed their audition there on 1 January 1962, before they signed with Parlophone. It is now used as rehearsal space by the English National Opera.

<text>WSBN (630 kHz) is a commercial AM sports radio station licensed to Washington, D.C., and serving the Washington metro area. It operates with 10,000 watts in the daytime and 2,700 watts at night using a directional antenna around the clock. WSBN&#x27;s studios are on Jenifer Street in Northwest Washington. The transmitter is located off Black Rock Road in Germantown, Maryland.

WSBN is owned and operated by Cumulus Media and is affiliated with ESPN Radio. It is one of the oldest radio stations in the Washington media market, continuously on the air from 1925. For most of its history, the station operated as WMAL; on July 1, 2019, its talk programming was moved exclusively to co-owned WMAL-FM at 105.9 MHz, which had simulcast with 630 am since 2011.

==Programming==
WSBN has two local hosts on weekdays, Andy Pollin in late mornings and Bram Weinstein in afternoon drive time. The rest of the schedule is largely made up of programs from ESPN Radio.

As of 2022, WSBN broadcasts the games of the Baltimore Ravens and Virginia Cavaliers football and men&#x27;s basketball. It announced on March 24, 2021, that it joined the Baltimore Orioles Radio Network as an affiliate station beginning with the upcoming season.

==History==
===Early years===
The station first went on the air, as WMAL, on October 12, 1925, using call letters incorporating the initials of Martin A. Leese, a local optician who began selling radio sets at 720 11th Street NW in Washington, D.C. He started WMAL as a low-power station. The shutdown of station WCAP left Washington with WRC (now WTEM) as its only high-power station, so local business leaders affiliated with the City Club of Washington banded together to create a second high-powered station. Their original plan was to buy WCAP and convert it to a municipal station, but instead they worked with Leese to boost WMAL&#x27;s signal and make it the city&#x27;s second large station. The new high-power WMAL went on the air from studios at 710-712 11th Street NW on October 2, 1926, with former WCAP announcer William T. Pierson as director and with a policy of encouraging young broadcasting talent in hopes of creating &quot;a people&#x27;s forum&quot;.

In 1927, Leese left his optical business to focus full-time on running the station, and the following year the Federal Radio Commission&#x27;s national frequency allocation plan assigned WMAL the AM 630 frequency. WMAL was a CBS Radio Network affiliate from 1928 until October 19, 1932, and then was briefly unaffiliated until joining the NBC Blue Network in January 1933. The Blue Network later became ABC, with which WMAL was affiliated for many years, and which owned WMAL for several decades.

By mid-1932, M. R. Baker had been appointed manager of the station, and Kenneth H. Berkeley was appointed station director of WMAL in 1933. While still owned by the Leese family, WMAL was eventually leased to the National Broadcasting Company in 1934, joining it with owned-and-operated station WRC.

NBC&#x27;s Washington vice president Frank M. Russell supervised the operation of both WMAL and WRC by 1935 when studios were moved from the National Press Building to the Trans-Lux Theatre Building, 724 14th Street NW. Transmitting facilities continued to be located at 712 Eleventh Street NW.

In the late months of 1937, the lease to NBC was terminated, with station operation reverting to the Leese Family interests. NBC, however, continued to operate it under a managerial agreement executed in fall 1937. Norman Leese was president of WMAL&#x27;s licensee at that time. On May 1, 1938, the M.A. Leese Radio Corporation was acquired by publishers of the now-defunct &quot;Washington Evening Star&quot; newspaper, a family-owned concern headed by board chairman and president Samuel H. Kauffman. Norman Leese remained president and K. H. Berkeley continued as general manager of WMAL.

The operating arrangement between NBC and the M.A. Leese Radio Corporation ended in February 1942. The station then reverted to the direct control of the Evening Star Broadcasting Company, of which K. H. Berkeley was executive vice president. Berkeley was also WMAL&#x27;s general manager. In October 1947, WMAL-TV signed on as the first high-band VHF television station in the United States. It became an ABC Network affiliate a year later.

By 1946, S. H. Kauffman, president and part owner of the &quot;Evening Star&quot;, was given additional duties as president of its broadcasting subsidiary, the Evening Star Broadcasting Company, until his resignation in August 1954. His replacement as general manager was Frederick S. Houwink.

Also in 1954, John W. Thompson Jr. replaced S. H. Kauffman as president of Evening Star Broadcasting Co.

Andrew Martin Ockershausen was appointed station manager of WMAL in 1960. One of Ockershausen&#x27;s first moves was to team Frank Harden with Jackson Weaver for WMAL&#x27;s morning drive show after the duo had a successful tryout hosting an evening comedy show patterned after Bob and Ray; &quot;Harden and Weaver&quot; took off in popularity and quickly became the top-rated morning show in the Washington market, featuring a blend of news, interviews, light music and comedy.

In 1962, Fred Houwink became a company vice president while continuing as WMAL&#x27;s general manager. In 1965 Houwink was named vice president of Evening Star Broadcasting and Ockershausen was elevated to general manager of WMAL.

In 1970 Houwink retired and Ockershausen was named vice president, operations. Also in 1970 Richard S. Stakes was named general manager and Harold L. Green was named station manager. In 1974 Charles A. Macatee became WMAL&#x27;s general manager.

===ABC years===
In early January 1976, the Evening Star Broadcasting Company&#x27;s WMAL, WMAL-FM and WMAL-TV and majority control of the ailing newspaper were acquired from the Kauffman, Noyes and Adams families by publisher Joseph L. Albritton’s Perpetual Corporation and Albritton became board chairman and chief owner of WMAL&#x27;s license. On January 21, 1976, WMAL&#x27;s licensee name was changed to &quot;Washington Star Communications of Delaware, Inc.&quot; Richard S. Stakes became station president, but resigned in December 1976. Mr. Albritton then assumed the presidency, with Robert Nelson becoming president of the broadcasting division. General Manager Charles Macatee resigned in January 1977.

A requirement of the purchase of the Evening Star properties included the sale of the radio or television properties. In March 1977, WMAL and WMAL-FM were spun off to ABC Radio, while the TV station was retained and became WJLA-TV, named after Albritton&#x27;s initials. ABC paid $16 million for WMAL and WMAL-FM, a record price for radio properties at that time. Andrew Ockershausen was appointed executive vice president.

On January 3, 1986, Capital Cities and ABC, Inc. merged in a $3.52 billion deal. Thomas S. Murphy was chairman and CEO of the new firm. Frederick Weinhaus became president and general manager following the resignation of Andrew Ockershausen in March 1986. Weinhaus was transferred to ABC Radio New York in January 1988. His replacement in May 1988 was Thomas Bresnahan, who continued in that role until his retirement in 2002.

WMAL morning co-host Jackson Weaver died on October 20, 1992, with &quot;Harden and Weaver&quot; still at or near the top of the local ratings; Weaver also garnered fame nationally as the first voice of Smokey Bear. Frank Harden continued the morning show with co-hosts Tim Brant and Andy Parks until his retirement in 1998. Brant and Parks continued until Brant&#x27;s departure in May 2002, his replacement would be former congressman Fred Grandy.

In 1996, WMAL won a Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award for its reporting on Disney&#x27;s America. By the late 1990s, WMAL transitioned its talk lineup into one similar to sister station WABC in New York City, with an emphasis on conservative talk.

 Chris Berry was named president and general manager November 19, 2002. Prior to joining WMAL, Berry was vice president, radio for ABC News, based in New York. In August 2005, host Michael Graham was fired after refusing to apologize for calling the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) a &quot;terrorist organization.&quot;

===Citadel and Cumulus years===
ABC sold its non-Radio Disney and ESPN Radio stations, including WMAL, to Citadel Broadcasting in 2007; Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.

Longtime Washington broadcaster Chris Core was dismissed from WMAL in 2008 as part of a broad cost-cutting move; his replacement, Austin Hill was dropped in February 2009 due to Levin&#x27;s show expanding and Sliwa&#x27;s show moving up an hour. Plante, a popular talk host who hosted evenings and later middays, was yanked in favor of Joe Scarborough&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot; in April 2009, only to return to middays six months later after Scarborough&#x27;s show was cancelled.

By late 2009, WMAL&#x27;s morning-drive through midnight weekday format was uninterrupted conservative talk, with a lineup of Fred Grandy and Andy Parks, Chris Plante, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Joe Scarborough, and Curtis Sliwa. Weekends include gardening host Jos Roozen, investing adviser Ric Edelman and lawyer Michael Collins. John Batchelor replaced Sliwa in November 2009. In April 2010, Parks was laid off from the station, resulting in Plante&#x27;s and Grandy&#x27;s shows being merged. At the same time, Scarborough&#x27;s show was put on extended hiatus. Austin Hill began filling in the middays for the time being, while Mark Simone handled Scarborough&#x27;s shift. Grandy left WMAL in March 2011.

On September 19, 2011, WMAL began simulcasting its AM signal on 105.9 FM, now WMAL-FM. The former WMAL-FM, renamed WRQX in 1977, has since become WLVW; it remained co-owned with WMAL until 2019.

In 2017, WMAL started broadcasting games from the Washington Commanders, then named the Washington Redskins, as an affiliate station for the first time since the team&#x27;s Super Bowl XXVI win in 1992. WMAL previously carried the team&#x27;s games from 1942 to 1956, and again from 1963 to 1991. WTEM (570 AM), a new sports station at the time, acquired the radio broadcast rights from WMAL for the 1992 NFL season.

As of January 3, 2017, WMAL&#x27;s weekday lineup consisted of local talent Brian Wilson and Mary Walter in the morning, then Chris Plante, followed by the syndicated Rush Limbaugh, then Larry O&#x27;Connor hosts a local afternoon drive show, followed by the syndicated shows of Mark Levin, John Batchelor, and overnight the syndicated show &quot;Red Eye Radio&quot;, hosted by Eric Harley and Gary McNamara. Brian Wilson was released in May 2017.
In 2015, Cumulus announced that it was planning to sell the station&#x27;s 75 acre (30 hectare) Bethesda, Maryland transmitter site, in use since 1941, so it could be redeveloped for high-end housing. On May 12, 2016, WMAL was granted a Federal Communications Commission construction permit for a transmitter site relocation. Transmissions from Bethesda ceased on the afternoon of May 1, 2018, with operations switched to the replacement facility at Germantown, Maryland, northwest of the original site and now diplexed with an existing station, WSPZ (later WWRC). Although daytime power remained at 10,000 watts, this relocation resulted in a nighttime power reduction from 5,000 to 2,700 watts. In 2020, the decommissioned Bethesda site was sold to Toll Brothers for $74.1 million, and the Bethesda towers were demolished on November 4, 2020.

===Flip to sports talk===
On June 13, 2019, it was announced that WMAL would break away from the simulcast with WMAL-FM and flip to ESPN Radio on July 1, 2019, as &quot;ESPN 630&quot;. WMAL replaced WTEM as ESPN Radio&#x27;s Washington, D.C., affiliate, though both stations continue to share Redskins games, with WTEM as flagship. Concurrent with the format change, WMAL changed its call letters to WSBN; prior to the change, it had been Washington&#x27;s oldest station to be operating under its original call letters. WSBN signed a four-year radio broadcast rights agreement on June 15, 2022, to broadcast Baltimore Ravens games.

==Studios==
WMAL broadcast from various facilities in Washington, D.C., and suburban Maryland until July 25, 1973, when it settled in at its current studio facility at 4400 Jenifer Street NW in Washington, two blocks from the city&#x27;s border with Maryland.

WMAL&#x27;s former transmitting facility, located in the Bradley Hills section of suburban Bethesda, Maryland, once housed studios for WMAL and WMAL-FM.

===Personalities===

Among the WMAL broadcasters over the years have been Frank Harden and Jackson Weaver, who co-hosted WMAL&#x27;s morning show for more than four decades until Weaver&#x27;s death in the early 1990s; Tom Gauger, who also spent several decades at WMAL on the mid-day shift from 10am-3pm; Bill Trumbull was the afternoon drivetime host and paired with several others through two decades, Felix Grant&#x27;s evening show featured traditional jazz. Grant is credited with introducing Brazil&#x27;s &quot;bossa nova&quot; music to the US. Arthur Godfrey, a national radio and early-TV personality who briefly broadcast on WMAL in 1933 as &quot;Red&quot; Godfrey; Bill Mayhugh, a mellow-voiced overnight broadcaster; and Ken Beatrice, a sports talk radio pioneer who hosted a call-in show from 1977 to 1995.

The station also kept a local following for a time by broadcasting sports games featuring the Washington Redskins and University of Maryland, College Park Terrapins. Legendary jazz authority Felix Grant broadcast on WMAL for decades.

Support of the local community has been a tradition for WMAL, which founded such innovative fund-raisers as the Leukemia Radiothon and the Gross National Parade, which supported the D.C. Police Boys &amp; Girls Club.

===News===
In addition to providing talk programming, WMAL provided local news coverage. With morning anchor Bill Thompson, afternoon anchor Mark Weaver and the team covers news stories affecting the Washington, D.C., area.

===Jerry Klein&#x27;s 2006 radio experiment===

The station aired a radio talk show on November 26, 2006, to gauge his audience&#x27;s reaction to saying that &quot;force should be applied to ensure that all Muslims in America wear identifying markers...&quot; The hoax was revealed at the end of the program.

But when Patrick is killed in an accident, his family uses traditional Shona custom to deprive Neria of her property and children.The film starts showing Neria and Patrick enjoying a modern life in the city with their two children. The couple goes to visit their family in the rural where they are persuaded by Patrick&#x27;s mother to stay home rather than in the suburbs away from the rest of the family. Patrick objects stating that he and Neria have built a home in the suburb and their life belongs there. Back in the city, Patrick&#x27;s car refuses to start as he wants to go to work, he then uses the bicycle instead. On his way from work his bicycle is hit by a truck and he dies on the spot.

<text>Granny&#x27;s Garden is an educational adventure game for the British BBC Micro computer, released in 1983. It served as a first introduction to computers for many schoolchildren in the United Kingdom during the 1980s and 1990s. According to the 4Mation webpage about the original version, it was the reason many teachers decided that computers had a real place in education. The software is still available in its original and updated formats.

Created by Mike Matson for 4Mation, the game takes place in the Kingdom of the Mountains. The aim is to find the six missing children of the King and Queen, while avoiding the evil witch, by solving puzzles.

<text>Royal Air Force Wyton or more simply RAF Wyton is a Royal Air Force station near St Ives, Cambridgeshire, England. The airfield is decommissioned and the station is now under the command of UK Strategic Command.

RAF Wyton is home to the National Centre for Geospatial Intelligence (NCGI), which provides Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) support to HM Armed Forces. It also contains the Ministry of Defence Police Headquarters, the Defence Infrastructure Organisation Regional Headquarters, 42 Engineer Regiment (Geographic), and several other UK and Allied capabilities, authorities, and departments.

Located within the station, the Pathfinder Building is described as the &quot;operations centre of Defence Intelligence&quot; and the “largest Top Secret, Five-Eyes by design, military intelligence fusion and assessment facility in the world.&quot;

==History==
===Flying station===
Wyton has been a military airfield since 1916, when it was used for training by the Royal Flying Corps and then its successor the Royal Air Force (RAF).

The following squadrons were posted to Wyton between 1916 and 1935:
;Second World War

During the Second World War it was used primarily as a bomber base, flying Bristol Blenheim, de Havilland Mosquito and Avro Lancaster aircraft.

Bristol Blenheim IV (N6215) of 139 Squadron became the first RAF aircraft to enter Germany in the Second World War on 3 September 1939, piloted by Flying Officer A. McPherson. He was awarded the DFC.

In 1942 it became the home of the Pathfinder Force under the command of Group Captain Don Bennett.

The following squadrons were posted to Wyton between 1935 and 1939:
* No. 44 Squadron between 1937 and 1937.
* No. 114 Squadron between 1936 and 1939.
* No. 139 Squadron between 1936 and 1939.

The following squadrons were posted to Wyton between 1939 and 1945:

;Cold War

After the war Wyton became home to the English Electric Canberras of the Strategic Reconnaissance Force. Vickers Valiants arrived for No. 543 Squadron in 1955 and a Handley Page Victor arrived for the Radar Reconnaissance Flight in 1959.

In 1974, three Nimrod R1s belonging to No. 51 Squadron arrived for use in the Elint and Sigint role, and in 1975, the T17 and T17A Canberras of No. 360 Squadron arrived: this was a joint RAF and RN Squadron specialising in Electronic countermeasures training.

The following squadrons were posted to Wyton between 1946 and 2011:

;Post-Cold War

In the early 1990s one of its pilots was rugby union player Flight Lieutenant Rory Underwood.

During a four-month period in 1989, two squadrons of U.S. Air Force Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II jets were operated out of RAF Wyton while the runway at their base, nearby RAF Alconbury, was resurfaced.

In May 1995 both RAF Wyton and RAF Alconbury airfields were decommissioned and Wyton was formally amalgamated with RAF Brampton, and later with RAF Henlow to make all three locations a single RAF Station under a single station commander for administrative purposes. The airfield continued to host light aircraft for the Cambridge and London University Air Squadrons until they both moved to RAF Wittering in 2015.

On 25 March 2013 it was decided to relocate all flying units from Wyton due to the high maintenance costs of the airfield.

Following the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review the RAF Brampton Wyton Henlow formation was disbanded: RAF Henlow subsequently became a separate station again and RAF Brampton was demolished.

=== Intelligence station ===
The Joint Forces Intelligence Group (JFIG), a unit which was responsible for the collection of signals, geospatial, imagery and measurement and signature intelligence, moved from Feltham in Middlesex to RAF Wyton in 2013. 42 Engineer Regiment relocated from Denison Barracks in Hermitage to RAF Wyton to co-locate with the Joint Forces Intelligence Group in July 2014 and No. 1 Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance Squadron moved from RAF Marham to Wyton in April 2017.

In 2016, JFIG disbanded, and the bulk of its former units and capabilities were re-rolled to establish the National Centre for Geospatial Intelligence. The NCGI is a 1-star commanded organisation which in recent years has monitored military and terrorist activities taking place in real time, such as:

* HMS Diamond in operations against the Houthis in the Red Sea
* Unidentified radio signals coming from the Yemeni coast 
* Different types of drones being used by Russia in Ukraine, including the physical analysis of Russian Orlan-10 and Iranian Shaheed 131 UAVs
* Development of Chinese DF-17 hypersonic missiles
* Pyongyang sending artillery rounds and missiles to Russian forces in Ukraine

It is also involved in homeland security and played a vital part in the Salisbury poisoning investigation by tracing the Novichok trail.

==Former units==

The following other units were posted to Wyton at some point:

<text>The Sviyaga(; ; , &quot;Sĕve&quot;) is a river in the Ulyanovsk Oblast and Tatarstan, a right tributary of the Volga. It is long, and its drainage basin covers . The Sviyaga flows into the Sviyaga Cove of the Kuybyshev Reservoir, west of Kazan. It freezes up in November or December and stays icebound until April or May. Major tributaries are the Arya, Birlya, Bula, Karla, Kubnya, Sulitsa and Tosha rivers.

The city of Ulyanovsk is along the Sviyaga. In Ulyanovsk, the Sviyaga flows only a few kilometres away from the Volga, but their eventual confluence happens much further downstream, about north of Ulyanovsk.

The castle of Sviyazhsk, which dates to 1551, is on the island in Sviyaga Cove of the Kuybyshev Reservoir.

<doc id="1010992" wikidata="Q2907366" url="?curid=1010992" title="Bluewater Shopping Centre">
<text>Bluewater Shopping Centre (commonly referred to as Bluewater) is an out-of-town shopping centre in Stone (postally Greenhithe), Kent, England, just outside the M25 motorway ring, east south east of London&#x27;s centre. Opened on 16 March 1999 in a former chalk quarry after ten years of building works, the site (including car parks) occupies and has a sales floor area of 154,000 m2 (1,600,000 ft2) over three levels, making it the fifth-largest shopping centre in the UK (after Westfield London, MetroCentre, Trafford Centre and Westfield Stratford City). Elsewhere in Europe only Istanbul&#x27;s Cevahir Mall and Vienna&#x27;s (Vösendorf) Shopping City Süd are bigger. The floor plan is a triangular shape with 210 stores, including three anchors, 50 cafés and restaurants, and a 17-screen cinema. The centre employs 7,000 people and serves over visitors a year. A main rival is the Lakeside Shopping Centre and its two retail parks in West Thurrock, Essex, just across the River Thames, away by road or as the crow flies.

It is owned by three major UK institutions: Landsec (55%), Prudential and PRUPIM (35%) and Hermes (10%).

==History==
In May 1990, Environment Secretary Michael Heseltine granted planning permission for the centre, encompassing 1.5 million sq ft (139,354.6 m2) of retail and 125,000 sq ft (11,312.9 m2) of leisure facilities. In 1994, quarry operator Blue Circle approached Australian mall developer Lendlease to form a partnership. Instead, Lend Lease bought the land and the project from Blue Circle, and under the leadership of its CEO Peter Walichnowski gathered a group of major investors, which included: Prudential, Barclays Mercantile, Hermes (acting for Britel), Lloyds Leasing, and Royal Bank Leasing. Lendlease also formed a pool of minor investors, called the Lend Lease Retail Partnership, with 18 institutions and corporations.

John Lewis was the first major tenant to sign up in February 1995, albeit with major concessions, such as the offer of , one fifth of the entire floor space, on three levels. That gave Bluewater credibility to sign more names, including the two other anchor stores: House of Fraser followed in June 1996 by Marks &amp; Spencer. 90% of the retail space was committed by March 1998.

Construction, undertaken by Bovis, started on 1 May 1996. At its peak, the site employed 2,500 workers simultaneously. In all, 20,000 people worked hours on the construction of Bluewater. At the planned opening date, 16 March 1999, Bluewater was inaugurated with 99% of the shops open for business. The total cost of construction was around GBP £400 million.
In December 2021 Lendlease sold its 25% shareholding to Landsec.

===Redevelopments and expansions===
With further expansion and development in the shopping centre industry since Bluewater&#x27;s opening in 1999, perhaps most prominently the entry of Westfield London and Westfield Stratford City into the market, Bluewater has looked to make changes to its offering to keep the centre up to date and provide new and additional customer experiences. Numerous stores have been refurbished, expanded or relocated in recent years as the centre looks to expand and upgrade its mix of retailers, and there have been some major construction projects, mostly centred on the three leisure/dining &#x27;villages&#x27;, undertaken or proposed.

In late 2006, Dartford Borough Council granted planning permission for Bluewater to build a two-storey events venue of 5200 m2, and further extend the south side of the centre. Construction on the extension began in early 2010, and when completed in 2011 the expansion added more restaurants to the Plaza (formerly Water Circus) section, including a Jamie&#x27;s Italian, Wagamama and Browns. The new Glow events centre opened as part of the extension spans two floors, and has held events such as the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Good Food Show: Spring&quot;. However, due to low visitors, Glow was closed in 2016, with the space being converted to extra cinema screens, a second Pizza Express restaurant, Creams Dessert Parlour, Rosa&#x27;s Thai Cafe and Dinotropolis adventure play area on the Upper Level, and a GraVity Trampoline Park on the Lower Level. The events venue was developed alongside the existing entertainment provision in this area, the Showcase cinema which has been present in this area (initially as a Hoyts multiplex) since the opening of Bluewater.

During 2012, the Wintergarden food court area off Rose Gallery was extensively refurbished. Much of the food court was closed for part of the year to enable the work, with McDonald&#x27;s notably unavailable at Bluewater throughout the period, though the Pizza Hut, Nando&#x27;s restaurants to the far side of the area (by the centre entrance), and the Ponti&#x27;s restaurant on the upper mall, remained open during the works. KFC relocated to Thames Walk to continue to trade during the development. When the Wintergarden works completed in October 2012, McDonald&#x27;s, KFC and Harry Ramsden&#x27;s returned to their post, along with several new food outlets, most significantly a new Giraffe restaurant (later occupied by Wingstop) which had been constructed adjacent McDonald&#x27;s. The previous large &#x27;castle&#x27;-style McDonald&#x27;s was replaced with a simple serving counter.

A proposal was put forward in early 2013 to expand the West Village dining and specialist retail area currently sited off the Guildhall. This currently comprises a Waterstones bookshop, a training and recruitment facility, and Costa Coffee shop on the upper mall, and on the lower mall a row of boutique retailers including The Daily Grind, Mr Simms Olde Sweet Shop, Gusto &amp; Daisy&#x27;s Dog Emporium leading out to a suite of restaurants including Carluccio&#x27;s, PizzaExpress and others. The proposal would see much of the existing infrastructure demolished and replaced with a new larger two-level &#x27;specialist retail&#x27; area, similar to &#x27;The Village&#x27; at Westfield London, with upmarket retail and restaurant facilities and mall access to both levels. Existing businesses would have to be relocated or removed from the centre to allow the works to go ahead. The proposed redevelopment ultimately did not go ahead, with The Village retaining its extant configuration. 

In 2024 it was confirmed that one of the mall&#x27;s original anchors, House of Fraser, was to close after 25 years in operation. In November 2024 it was announced that Next would be relocated into the vacated space, moving from their existing premises on Thames Walk.

The centre is visited by over 27 million people a year and employs around 7,000 people.


==Architecture==

The principal architect was Eric Kuhne. Other firms involved in the design and branding were Benoy, BDG McColl, RTKO, Henrion Ludlow &amp; Schmidt and Minale Tattersfield.

The main building is a triangle of three malls: Thames Walk, Guildhall and Rose Gallery, with one anchor store at each corner. Curved and tapered glass sections form the roofing over each mall, providing significant natural lighting. The roof vents are inspired by Kentish oast houses.

There are statues of historic trades along the walls above the upper level.

==Transport==
===Parking===
There are over 13,000 free parking spaces including disabled parking, across six car parks. As of 27 May 2022, Bluewater offers 39 Pod Point spaces and 17 Tesla spaces for EV Charging across the site.

===Rail===
The nearest railway station to Bluewater is Greenhithe for Bluewater, 1.5 miles away. It is served by Southeastern and Thameslink trains to Luton, London Cannon Street, London Charing Cross, London Victoria, Gravesend and Rainham.

===Buses===
Arriva Southern Counties, Go-Ahead London (Fastrack routes), Go Coach, Ensignbus, National Express and London Buses routes serve Bluewater bus station.

The down has a typical chalk downland wildlife on the uncultivated areas (generally the southern and eastern slopes). This includes plants such as Small Scabious, Harebell, Cowslip and Lady&#x27;s Bedstraw. The chalk cliffs to the north and east are important nesting places for seabirds.
Historically, Culver has been the source of commercial bird&#x27;s egg collecting from ropes over the cliff. It was also known for breeding peregrine falcons, as well as breeding Common Woodpigeons (Culvers), the source of the cliff&#x27;s name.

The northern side is intensively grazed by cattle, so fertilization and poaching of the soil, not to mention a spell as an artillery training ground, have all but eliminated the natural chalk ecosystem.

On Culver Down a number of unusual ant species live, including the semi-myrmecophilous &quot;Solenopsis fugax&quot; (Latr.), a thief ant which was recorded there several times by Horace Donisthorpe. The ant &quot;Ponera coarctata&quot; has also been taken from this location.

The public parts of this prominent headland are owned and managed by the National Trust, and afford views of the English Channel.

For many years the whole site was a military zone and not open to the public. There are several historic military features on the down, a number of private dwellings, the Culver Haven pub, and the very visible Monument. The military barracks which once adjoined the monument has been almost completely erased, but there is a substantial fort, now under the ownership of the National Trust and occasionally opened to the public. Part of the fort is leased to Micronair, manufacturing crop-spraying and military equipment. It is a Palmerston Fort, constructed in the 1860s. At the end of the cliff is a coastal and anti-aircraft battery from the Second World War.

In 1545 a French force was intercepted crossing from its beachhead at Whitecliff Bay to attack Sandown by local levies under Sir John Oglander and a skirmish fought on the Down. The French were finally repulsed at Sandown.

The poet Algernon Charles Swinburne said in a letter that he had climbed the cliffs at 17, in order to prove his manhood to his family after they refused to let him join the army.

There is a legend that a 14th-century hermit lived at the end of the cliffs in a cave, in a structure then known as Culver Ness. He is said to have predicted that the well at Wolverton would be poisoned. When a pilgrim from Jerusalem came to bless the well, the vigilant and pious villagers are said to have murdered him. Shortly after, the French sacked the village and since then it has been lost beneath the trees of Centurion&#x27;s Copse. They were repulsed from further mischief by Sir Theobald Russell. There was subsequently a great storm which destroyed the Ness and drowned the hermit. This was held to be divine retribution.

==Suicides from Culver Down==
There have been a number of reported suicides from Culver Down generally involving a vehicle being driven over the cliff. Measures to make the cliff edge less accessible to vehicles have been put in place but such incidents continue to occur.

On 11 October 2012, Robert Hayball of Newport also drove his van over the cliff, resulting in his death.

==The Yarborough Monument==

The monument is a memorial to Charles Anderson-Pelham, the 2nd Baron Yarborough (later first Earl of Yarborough and also Baron Worsley), founder of the Royal Yacht Squadron at Cowes. It was originally erected in 1849 on the highest point of Bembridge Down, 3/4 mile to the west, and was moved to its present position in the 1860s when its former site was used for the construction of one of the Palmerston forts.

<text>The Serbia men&#x27;s national football team () represents Serbia in men&#x27;s international football competition. It is controlled by the Football Association of Serbia, the governing body for football in Serbia.

After the breakup of SFR Yugoslavia and its football team in 1992 Serbia was represented (alongside Montenegro) within the new FR Yugoslavia national football team. Despite qualifying for Euro 1992 the team was banned from participating in the tournament due to international sanctions, with the ruling also enforced for 1994 World Cup and Euro 1996 qualifiers. The national team played its first friendly in December 1994, and with the easing of sanctions the generation of the 1990s eventually participated at the 1998 World Cup, reaching the round of 16, and the quarter-finals at Euro 2000. The team played in the 2006, 2010, 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups, but failed to progress past the group stage on each occasion.

Between February 2003 and June 2006, Serbia participated as Serbia and Montenegro due to the countries&#x27; name change. Following a 2006 referendum Montenegro declared its independence, leading to separate football federations which resulted in the team&#x27;s final renaming and establishment as the Serbia national football team. Serbia is considered by FIFA and UEFA to be the official successor team of FR Yugoslavia/Serbia and Montenegro national football teams, as well as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia/SFR Yugoslavia team.

==History==
===Serbia within Yugoslavia (1920–1992)===


The Football Federation of what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) was founded in Zagreb in 1919 under the name &quot;Jugoslavenski nogometni savez&quot; (&quot;Yugoslavian Football Association&quot;). Jovan Ružić was the first Serb to represent the national team in its international debut match, a 7–0 drubbing by Czechoslovakia at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium.

In 1921, the Belgrade Football Subassociation organized a friendly match between the France national football team and a Belgrade XI, dubbed the &quot;Serbian representatives&quot;. The team featured footballers from SK Jugoslavija and BSK, two of the Serbian clubs of the interwar period. The French delegation was on a four-game tour of Yugoslavia with the last exhibition game being played in Belgrade&#x27;s SK Jugoslavija Stadium on 3 July. Prince Regent Aleksandar I and FIFA President Jules Rimet were in attendance as the visitors triumphed 3–0.

In the lead-up to the 1930 World Cup, a dispute regarding the relocation of the FAs headquarters from Zagreb to the capital Belgrade erupted, culminating in a boycott by the Zagreb Subassociation which disallowed its members to participate in the upcoming tournament. The &quot;de facto&quot; Serbian team led by coach Boško Simonović, composed largely of players from Belgrade&#x27;s BSK, SK Jugoslavija and BASK, reached the semi-final, losing to hosts and eventual winners Uruguay 6–1. The royal interbellum era featured footballers such as Blagoje Marjanović, Aleksandar Tirnanić, Milorad Arsenijević, Đorđe Vujadinović, Branislav Sekulić and Milutin Ivković. Due to the dismemberment of Yugoslavia during World War II the football federation and national team ceased activities but reformed following the end of hostilities.

In 1945 Svetislav Glišović led the first unofficial national team representing the Federal State of Serbia in a tournament held to mark the end of World War II. The Serbian team encompassing the newly established Red Star squad won its first game by beating FS Montenegro 2–1, FS Croatia 3–1 in the semi-final, then proceeding to win the tournament against the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army team 1–0 in Belgrade.

The reconstituted Yugoslavia reached the UEFA European Championship finals in 1960 and 1968, and finished fourth place at the 1962 FIFA World Cup. During its existence Serbian footballers would continually play a role in the Yugoslavia national team throughout the socialist era, with the likes of Rajko Mitić, Branko Stanković, Vladimir Beara, Vujadin Boškov, Todor Veselinović, Miloš Milutinović, Borivoje Kostić, Milan Galić, Vladimir Durković, Velibor Vasović, Dragan Džajić, Jovan Aćimović, Dušan Bajević, Vladimir Petrović and others until the states disintegrated in the 1990s. The national team of SFR Yugoslavia played its last game on 25 March 1992, losing 2–0 to the Netherlands.

===FR Yugoslavia/Serbia &amp; Montenegro era (1992–2006)===

While the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, was formed on 27 April 1992, its teams were banned from all international sporting events, including the national football team as a result of U.N. sanctions stemming from the conflict in Yugoslavia. Consequently, the national team did not play its first game as a new country before 23 December 1994, a friendly match played in Porto Alegre and in which Brazil won 2–0. This was the first ever team composed of Serbian and Montenegrin players exclusively, while Slobodan Santrač, a former Yugoslavia national team player, was named the team&#x27;s first ever manager. The next game was played three days later, this time in Buenos Aires, resulting in a 1–0 loss to Argentina.

Due to international sanctions, the team could not participate in 1994 World Cup qualifying nor the Euro 1996 qualifying process.

====1998 World Cup====
As FR Yugoslavia joined FIFA and UEFA in 1994, the team was available to participate in the 1998 World Cup qualifiers. Slobodan Santrač was appointed manager for the team. In the qualifiers, Yugoslavia was drawn in Group 6 with Euro 1996 runners-up Czech Republic, Slovakia, Spain, Faroe Islands and Malta. With 23 points, Yugoslavia ended up in second place behind Spain. Yugoslavia qualified for the play-off in which they were drawn to play against Hungary. Winning 12–1 on aggregate, Yugoslavia qualified for the World Cup.

The draw put the team in Group F alongside Germany, the United States, and Iran. Yugoslavia won its first game 1–0 against Iran thanks to a goal from defender Siniša Mihajlović. The next game was a draw for Yugoslavia; after leading Germany 2–0, a free kick from Michael Tarnat deflected off Mihajlović and into the goal, then Oliver Bierhoff equalised it at 2–2 at the 80th minute. Yugoslavia responded in the next game against the United States and won 1–0 due to a goal in the fourth minute by Slobodan Komljenović. Yugoslavia finished second in the group behind Germany on goal difference.

Due to their second position, Yugoslavia saw itself face the Netherlands in the Round of 16. Yugoslavia entered in the match with a sole attacker, but its defensive tactics proved unsuccessful as Dennis Bergkamp put the Netherlands in front in the 38th minute. Following the start of the second half, Yugoslavia pressured the Dutch, who conceded a header from Komljenović. The turning point of this match was a penalty awarded to Yugoslavia after Vladimir Jugović was fouled. Predrag Mijatović missed, and the scoreline remained the same at 1–1. Such an event demoralized the Yugoslavs, as the Dutch took the initiative. In the late seconds of the game Edgar Davids&#x27; shot towards the Yugoslav net from a distance of 20 meters and beat goalkeeper Ivica Kralj.

====Euro 2000====
The draw for the Euro 2000 qualifiers saw first-seeded Yugoslavia drawn in a group with Croatia, thus marking the first games between the two teams after the breakup of Yugoslavia. The other teams in the group were the Republic of Ireland, Macedonia, and Malta. Milan Živadinović was dismissed and was replaced by Vujadin Boškov.

The team started with a 1–0 win over the Republic of Ireland in Belgrade, before beating Malta 3–0 in Ta&#x27; Qali. The home fixture against the Maltese followed, but was moved to Thessaloniki, Greece due to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The team won 4–1. The first match against Croatia took place in Belgrade after the bombing ended, and was interrupted due to a power outage at the beginning of the second half, resuming after 43 minutes and eventually finishing 0–0. A 2–1 defeat against Ireland in Dublin was followed by victories home and away against Macedonia (3–1 and 4–2 respectively), meaning that Yugoslavia needed to win its final qualifier against Croatia in Zagreb, or to draw with the Republic of Ireland failing to beat Macedonia in Skopje, in order to qualify automatically for Euro 2000. In the event, the Republic of Ireland conceded an injury-time equaliser, meaning that Yugoslavia&#x27;s 2–2 draw with the Croatians put them through.

The draw for the finals placed Yugoslavia in Group C along with Spain, Norway and another former Yugoslav republic, Slovenia. The Slovenians took a 3–0 lead in the first game at the Stade du Pays de Charleroi, but three goals in six second-half minutes enabled Yugoslavia to secure a 3–3 draw. Thanks to an early Savo Milošević backheel strike, the Serbs beat Norway 1–0 in Liège. The final group game, against Spain in Bruges, saw the Yugoslavs take the lead three times, before a Gaizka Mendieta penalty and an Alfonso strike in injury-time secured a 4–3 win for the Spaniards and top spot in the group. Yugoslavia nonetheless finished second, level on points with Norway but ranked ahead due to its victory in Liège. In each of the three games, the team had one player sent off (Siniša Mihajlović, Mateja Kežman, and Slaviša Jokanović, respectively). In the quarter-finals, Yugoslavia was paired with the Netherlands. The co-hosts won 6–1 in Rotterdam with Patrick Kluivert scoring a hat-trick. Despite Yugoslavia&#x27;s elimination, Savo Milošević was crowned the joint top scorer of the tournament alongside Patrick Kluivert. Both players scored five goals, although Milošević played one game fewer.

====2002 World Cup campaign====
Ilija Petković replaced Boškov as head coach in July 2000. For the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, Yugoslavia was drawn in Group 1 with Russia, Slovenia, Switzerland, the Faroe Islands and Luxembourg. After winning against Luxembourg, Petković was sacked and replaced with a three-pieced team which consisted of Boškov, Dejan Savićević and Ivan Ćurković. Despite winning both games against Luxembourg and Faroe Islands as well and away game against Switzerland, Yugoslavia managed to suffer a home loss and away draw against Russia, a home draw against Switzerland and both draw games against Slovenia. Yugoslavia ended the qualifying campaign in the third place of the group just one point behind second-placed Slovenia.

====Euro 2004 campaign====
Savićević was appointed as coach in July 2002. For the Euro 2004 qualifiers Yugoslavia was drawn in Group 9 with Italy, Wales, Finland and Azerbaijan. During qualifying, the country went under a political transformation, and the newly named Serbia and Montenegro appeared for the first time in a game against Azerbaijan in February 2003. In June, after a 2–1 loss to Azerbaijan, Savićević resigned and was replaced by Ilija Petković. Despite drawing both games against eventual group winners Italy and winning both games against runners-up Wales, Serbia and Montenegro failed to qualify, mostly due to a 2–2 home draw, the 2–1 loss to Azerbaijan, as well as a 3–0 away loss to Finland.

====2006 World Cup====

Petković remained as manager for the team. Qualifying for the 2006 World Cup resulted in six wins and four draws, with Serbia and Montenegro ending up first in the group with an undefeated record in their qualification group ahead of Spain, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania and San Marino. The Serbia and Montenegro team also allowed only one goal in the ten matches, the best defensive record of all 51 teams participating in qualification.

On 3 June 2006, following a referendum, Montenegro declared its independence from Serbia. As the World Cup was about to start, it was decided that the Serbia and Montenegro team that had qualified for the tournament would compete, with the split into separate teams representing the new countries of Montenegro and Serbia to take place once the team was no longer in the tournament.

In the group stage, Serbia and Montenegro lost their opening game to the Netherlands. The final score was 1–0 after Arjen Robben scored the only goal of the game. They also lost their second game to Argentina 6–0, Serbia and Montenegro&#x27;s worst ever international result. With the team&#x27;s two losses and with Netherlands and Argentina winning both their games, Serbia and Montenegro could no longer qualify for the knockout matches and was playing for pride alone in their final group game against Ivory Coast. After a 2–0 lead for much of the first half, &quot;the Elephants&quot; managed to come back and win 3–2, leaving Serbia and Montenegro with no points.

===Independent Serbia (2006–present)===

====Euro 2008 campaign====
Javier Clemente, Serbia&#x27;s first-ever foreign coach, was appointed to lead the team for the 2008 Euro campaign. After Montenegro declared independence, Serbia marked their split from Montenegro with a 3–1 win over the Czech Republic. For the Euro 2008 qualifiers, Serbia was drawn in Group A along with Poland, Portugal, Belgium, Finland, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan. A strong start in qualification was overshadowed by the final hurdle of matches where inconsistency took over, the side dropping points against the likes of Finland, Belgium, Armenia and Kazakhstan. They eventually finished third, three points behind runners-up Portugal and Group A winners Poland. Clemente was sacked after the team&#x27;s failure to qualify.

Serbia replaced Clemente with Miroslav Đukić, who then left the position on 19 August of the following year without having played any official games, due to disagreements with the Football Association of Serbia.

====2010 World Cup====
Subsequent to Ðukić&#x27;s departure, Radomir Antić was appointed coach. Serbia&#x27;s World Cup qualification campaign began in 2008. Their qualification group featured 1998 World Cup winners and 2006 World Cup runners-up France, Romania, as well as Austria, Lithuania and the Faroe Islands. Serbia played consistently during the qualifiers and this led to the team automatically qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. They confirmed qualification with a 5–0 home victory against Romania.

The 2010 World Cup team featured captain Dejan Stanković, who became the only player to feature in a World Cup having played under three different national names (although he never changed nationality; this was a result of geopolitical events involving the identity of Yugoslavia). They faced Ghana, Germany, Australia.

Their opening group game was against Ghana and chances came to both sides but a red card to Aleksandar Luković and a handball by substitute Zdravko Kuzmanović in the second half gave Ghana a penalty to take all three points at the death. Asamoah Gyan converted eight minutes from full-time and Serbia were defeated 1–0. In Serbia&#x27;s second group match, they defeated Germany by a score of 1–0 with a goal by Milan Jovanović in the first half. FIFA&#x27;s official YouTube channel called the win &quot;the most famous day in Serbia&#x27;s footballing history&quot;.

Serbia only needed a single point to reach the knockout stages, but was defeated by Australia 2–1. Australia scored two goals in the second half through Tim Cahill and Brett Holman. A late Marko Pantelić goal served only as a consolation. They finished last in the group.

====Euro 2012 campaign====
Radomir Antić was sacked two games into the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying process, a 1–1 home draw against Slovenia ending his two-year stint. The dismissal meant the bringing in of Vladimir Petrović to the job.

For the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying, Serbia was drawn in Group C featuring Italy, Slovenia, Estonia, Northern Ireland and the Faroe Islands. The qualifying stage began with Antić as coach and finished with Vladimir Petrović. Serbia started the first two games with a 3–0 win away to Faroe Islands and a 1–1 draw at home to Slovenia but this result ended Antić&#x27;s stint as the country&#x27;s coach. New coach Petrović faced setbacks with a 3–1 home loss against Estonia and an abandoned match resulting in a 3–0 loss to Italy due to crowd trouble from the Serbian away supporters in Genoa.

Serbia returned to form with a 2–1 home victory over Northern Ireland but could only manage a 1–1 away draw against Estonia. Afterwards, Serbia won back to back games with a 1–0 win away to Northern Ireland and a crucial 3–1 home victory against Faroe Islands. These results put Serbia in pole position to confirm a play-off spot behind Italy.

Serbia needed a home victory against Italy to confirm a play-off spot but their efforts only resulted in a 1–1 draw. However, the team still had one more chance to confirm a play-off place when they faced Slovenia away. Serbia also must win the match despite having superior goal difference over Estonia; a draw was not good enough for progression. Neither side played better in the first half, but a long-range goal put Slovenia up 1–0 at half time. In the second half, Nemanja Vidić missed penalty. Serbia left empty-handed after a 1–0 loss and exited the tournament for the third time in a row during the qualifying group stages, missing out by one point behind Estonia. Serbia once again failed to qualify for the European Championships. Vladimir Petrović was sacked after the team&#x27;s failure to qualify.

====2014 World Cup campaign====
Ahead of the qualifying campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Dejan Stanković and Nemanja Vidić announced that they were retiring from international football. Branislav Ivanović became the new captain. Siniša Mihajlović, a former member of the national team, was appointed as the coach on 24 April 2012. Serbia was drawn in Group A in qualification for the 2014 World Cup, together with Croatia, Belgium, Scotland, Macedonia, and Wales. The team began the qualification campaign with a goalless draw with Scotland and a 6–1 win over Wales. In the next two games, Serbia suffered two defeats from Macedonia and Belgium.

On 22 March 2013, Serbia played in Zagreb against Croatia. The game was highly anticipated in both countries due to their rivalry both on and off the pitch. Croatia won 2–0. Serbia defeated Scotland 2–0 at home in a crucial qualifier, but their World Cup hopes were taken away after a 2–1 defeat to Belgium. Serbia drew with Croatia 1–1 in the corresponding fixture at home, where 18-year-old Aleksandar Mitrović scored an equalizer in the second-half after Mario Mandžukić opened the scoring. They defeated Wales 3–0 in Cardiff. Dejan Stanković&#x27;s farewell game was completed in a friendly against Japan, which Serbia won 2–0. He finished his career with 103 appearances for the national team, a record previously held by Savo Milošević, with 102 appearances. Serbia finished qualifying with a 5–1 home win against Macedonia, putting them in third in the group, three points from a playoff spot behind Croatia and group winners Belgium.

====Euro 2016 campaign====
After failing to qualify for the 2014 World Cup, Dick Advocaat was appointed as the coach in 2014. Serbia was drawn in Group I in qualification for UEFA Euro 2016, together with Portugal, Denmark, Albania and Armenia. Advocaat started with a 1–1 friendly draw against France and began qualification with the same result against Armenia. The following game was a game against Albania in Belgrade, abandoned as a result of crowd trouble after a drone carrying an Albanian flag and a map of Greater Albania was flown over the pitch. Serbia was originally awarded with a 3–0 victory by UEFA, and deducted three points, but on 10 July 2015, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) reversed the earlier decision and awarded Albania a 3–0 victory. On 14 November 2014, Serbia played against Denmark in Belgrade and lost, 1–3. After this game, Advocaat left, whereupon Radovan Ćurčić was announced as a new coach on 25 November.

Serbia&#x27;s first match in 2015 was a qualifying match against Portugal in Lisbon, during which Serbia lost 2–1, cutting their chances for qualification to Euro 2016. On 13 June 2015, Serbia played a qualifying match against Denmark in Copenhagen, losing 2–0. With the 10 July ruling by CAS on the abandoned game against Albania, Serbia would become mathematically eliminated from Euro 2016 qualification. On 4 September 2015, Serbia had their first victory, winning 2–0, against Armenia. On 8 October 2015, Serbia defeated Albania with a goal each from Aleksandar Kolarov and Adem Ljajić. In the table of Group I, Serbia finished second to last place with four points in a five-team group.

====2018 World Cup====

After failing to qualify for Euro 2016, Slavoljub Muslin was appointed as a coach. Serbia was drawn in Group D in qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup with Euro 2016 semi-finalists Wales, Austria, Ireland, Georgia and Moldova. They started off their campaign with a 2–2 draw against Ireland at the Red Star Stadium and eventually won against Austria, Georgia and Moldova.

Serbia beat Moldova in Belgrade with goals from Aleksandar Kolarov, Aleksandar Mitrović and Mijat Gaćinović. This consolidated their first position going into their top-of-the group clash with Ireland. They won this match with a 55th-minute goal from Kolarov. Serbia finished the qualifying campaign with a 1–0 home win against Georgia, and ended at the top of Group D and therefore qualified for the 2018 tournament. Despite Serbia&#x27;s qualification, Muslin was sacked by the Football Association of Serbia as a result on differences regarding team selection. Muslin was criticized for not inviting Sergej Milinković-Savić to play in the campaign which sparked controversy in Serbia. Mladen Krstajić took the place as a temporary coach after Muslin&#x27;s dismissal and led the team in the World Cup.

In the World Cup, Serbia opened their match against Costa Rica. Kolarov&#x27;s free kick at the second half meant Serbia won their first World Cup game in eight years. Serbia lost their later encounters, losing 1–2 to Switzerland with a 90th-minute goal scored by Xherdan Shaqiri and 0–2 to Brazil, thus being eliminated in the group stage.

====2018–19 UEFA Nations League====
Due to the performance of Serbia in previous years, the country found itself started the campaign of the inaugural Nations League, where they were drawn into Group 4 with Montenegro, Lithuania and Romania. With both wins against Lithuania and Montenegro and both draw games against Romania, Serbia finished on top of the group, securing the Euro 2020 play-off spot and being promoted into League B for 2020–21 season. With six goals, Aleksandar Mitrović finished the tournament as the top scorer.

====Euro 2020 campaign====
In December 2017, Mladen Krstajić became the permanent coach for Serbia. Serbia started the campaign of 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, which served as a part of UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying campaign.

For Euro 2020 qualifiers, Serbia was drawn into Group B with Euro 2016 champions Portugal, Ukraine, Lithuania and Luxembourg. Serbia kicked off the qualifiers with 1–1 away draw against Portugal. However, in the next away game against Ukraine, Serbia lost 5–0. Krstajić was sacked after the loss and replaced with Ljubiša Tumbaković. Tumbaković started with a 2–4 home loss against Portugal. The next two games were away wins against Luxembourg and Lithuania, before beating Luxembourg at home. Serbia then drew 2–2 to Ukraine at home, meaning they could not finish in the top two and a play-off would ensue.

After the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs were resumed, Serbia placed itself against Norway in Oslo. Two goals, one in extra time helped Serbia to overcome Norway 2–1, thus marching to the final playoff game against Scotland at home. The game was won by Scotland in a penalty shootout (5–4) after the game was tied 1–1 after full time. Serbia once again failed to qualify for the Euros, making 20 years since the country last took part in the tournament. Tumbaković was sacked after the team&#x27;s failure to qualify for the tournament.

====2022–23 UEFA Nations League====
Serbia was drawn in 2022–23 UEFA Nations League B Group 4 alongside Norway, Sweden and Slovenia, finishing first and being promoted after wins against Sweden at home and Norway in Oslo.

====2022 World Cup====
Serbia was drawn in Group A in qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup with Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Luxembourg and Azerbaijan.

After a penalty shootout loss against Scotland in the Euro 2020 qualifying playoffs, Ljubiša Tumbaković was sacked and replaced with Dragan Stojković.

Serbia started qualification with a 3–2 win against the Republic of Ireland in Belgrade in March 2021. After a 2–2 draw against Portugal, Serbia won against Azerbaijan in Baku 2–1. Mixed results meant Serbia needed a victory against Portugal to qualify directly from the group. On 14 November 2021, Serbia faced Portugal at the Estádio da Luz, and trailed by a goal. However, an equaliser by Dušan Tadić and a decisive goal from Aleksandar Mitrović in the final minutes of the second half meant Serbia automatically booked a ticket for Qatar.

Serbia was drawn in Group G with 2018 opponents Brazil and Switzerland, as well as African representatives Cameroon. Serbia was defeated in the first match against Brazil 2–0, drew against Cameroon 3–3, and lost against Switzerland 3–2 after a fight between multiple Serbs and Granit Xhaka, ending up with only one point.

====Euro 2024====
Following the elimination in the group stage at the 2022 World Cup, Stojković stayed as a coach with a goal to bring Serbia to UEFA Euro 2024.

Serbia was drawn in Group G in qualification for Euro 2024 with Hungary, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Lithuania. Serbia started the qualifying campaign with 2–0 wins against Lithuania in Belgrade and Montenegro in Podgorica in March 2023. After a friendly match against Jordan in which Serbia won 3–2, Serbia ended up in a 1–1 draw against Bulgaria in Razgrad. For the next game against Hungary in Belgrade, Serbia was forced to play behind closed doors due to UEFA sanctioning the Serbian association chants against Montenegrins; Serbia eventually lost the game 1–2. The next game was another win against Lithuania in Kaunas, 3–1, with Aleksandar Mitrović scoring a hat-trick. On 14 October 2023, Serbia once again lost against Hungary in Budapest 1–2, but won against Montenegro in Belgrade 3–1 three days later. After the crucial final game against Bulgaria at home which ended in a 2–2 draw, Serbia ended the campaign in second place in group G with 14 points, qualifying for their first European Championship as an independent nation and in 24 years.

In the tournament, Serbia was drawn into group C with England, Slovenia and Denmark. They lost 1-0 to England in the first game. They followed that up with a 1-1 draw with Slovenia, after Luka Jović scored a last minute equalizer in extra time. They needed to beat Denmark in their last group stage match in order to advance, but came up with a 0-0 draw, resulting in their elimination.

==Rivalries==
* Serbia v. Croatia: The rivalry stems from political roots, and is listed as one of the ten greatest international rivalries by Goal.com. and as the most politically charged football rivalry by the Bleacher Report. The two sides started the football rivalry in the 1990 when they were part of Yugoslavia, which dissolved after a series of wars. The two nations have played four times, with Croatia winning one and drawing the other three games.
* Serbia v. Albania: The rivalry stems from historical tensions and the Kosovo question.
* Serbia v. Switzerland: The rivalry is connected to the Albanian diaspora players in the Swiss football team and is linked to the tensions between the Albanians and the Serbs. The teams have faced each other 4 times, with Switzerland winning twice and Serbia once.

==Team image==
The badge of the Football Association of Serbia is modelled on the Serbian cross inescutcheon featured on the Serbian coat of arms. It consists of a modified version of the four firesteels and cross, with the addition of a football. The team is nicknamed &quot;the Eagles&quot; (Serbian Cyrillic: &quot;Орлови&quot;) in reference to the white double-headed eagle, a national symbol of Serbia. In 2022 the Football Association of Serbia launched a new, national team specific emblem for brand and marketing purposes. The previous FA crest was replaced by a stylised logo inspired by the lesser coat of arms of the Republic of Serbia.

For years following the breakup of SFR Yugoslavia the national team experienced an identity crisis, which despite its name, was seen as &quot;de facto&quot; representative of Serbia. From 1994 to 2006 the obsolete and unpopular Communist era national anthem &quot;&quot;Hej, Sloveni&quot; was often jeered, booed and whistled by home supporters as players refrained from singing the lyrics. During this period the team continued to officially carry the old nickname &quot;Plavi&quot;&quot; (&quot;the&quot; &quot;Blues&quot;), badge and kit design indicative of the Yugoslav tricolour.

Following the secession of Montenegro in 2006 the national team adopted red shirts, blue shorts and white socks in honor of the Serbian tricolour. Between 2010 and 2016 a cross motif inspired by the country&#x27;s coat of arms was incorporated in the jersey. In years Serbia has utilised all-red uniforms due to FIFA&#x27;s kit clash regulations. Away kits are traditionally white with blue or white shorts.

Serbia does not have an official national stadium and the team has played at grounds throughout the country. The Rajko Mitić Stadium is the most popular venue following by Partizan Stadium, both ground are located in the capital city Belgrade.

===Kit sponsorship===

In July 2014, a partnership was announced between the Football Association of Serbia and English manufacturer Umbro, which is Serbia&#x27;s official supplier, before Puma took over with their home and away kits, debuting 7 September 2014 in the friendly match against France. That same day, Serbia unveiled their latest kits also worn at the Euro 2016 qualifiers campaign.

==Competition records==
Serbia was part of Yugoslavia and its national football team which existed between 1920 and 1992. With the collapse of Yugoslavia, the remaining constituent republics, Serbia and Montenegro, formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992. The country underwent a name change in 2003, and Montenegro left the state union in 2006. FIFA and UEFA consider the Football Association of Serbia a direct successor to both the Football Association of Yugoslavia and the Football Association of Serbia and Montenegro, thereby attributing all records to Serbia.

<doc id="1011002" wikidata="Q332255" url="?curid=1011002" title="Chuck Howley">
<text>Charles Louis Howley (born June 28, 1936) is an American former professional football linebacker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 15 seasons, primarily with the Dallas Cowboys. He spent his first two seasons with the Chicago Bears, who selected him seventh overall in the 1958 NFL draft, and played the remainder of his career for the Cowboys. Recognized as an original member of the Doomsday Defense, Howley received six Pro Bowl and five first-team All-Pro selections, while appearing in two consecutive Super Bowls and winning Super Bowl VI. Howley was also named the MVP of Super Bowl V and is the only player on a losing team to receive the award. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2023.

==Early life==
Howley was born and raised in Wheeling, West Virginia. He initially enrolled at Wheeling Central Catholic High School, before transferring to Warwood High School. He lettered in football, basketball, and baseball. In football, he was first-team all-state and all-OVAC as a senior. As a teenager he also competed in gymnastics. He graduated in 1954.

==College career==
Howley accepted a football scholarship from West Virginia University in Morgantown, where he was a three-time All-Southern Conference selection and the conference player of the year in 1957. At WVU, Howley joined the Mu Mu chapter of the Sigma Chi Fraternity.

Howley played guard and center during his three years at varsity, in which the Mountaineers compiled a 21–8–1 record, including a 21–7 victory over Penn State, West Virginia&#x27;s last until 1984. He played in the East-West Shrine Game and the Senior Bowl, which helped him get noticed by the Chicago Bears. He also was in the College All-Star Game in August 1958, a 35–19 win over the defending champion Detroit Lions.

He is the only athlete in school history to letter in five sports: football, track, wrestling, gymnastics, and swimming. He won the Southern Conference one-meter diving championship.

Howley was inducted into the West Virginia Sports Hall of Fame, the Texas Sports Hall of Fame, the West Virginia University Athletics Hall of Fame, the Ohio Valley Athletic Conference Hall of Fame and the West Virginia University Academy of Distinguished Alumni. On November 4, 2023, West Virginia retired his number 66.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Bears===
Howley was selected seventh overall in the 1958 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, playing for two seasons before retiring after what appeared to be a career-ending knee injury he sustained in August 1959, at training camp in Rensselaer, Indiana. He played just three games late in that season and was inactive in 1960. He returned to West Virginia that year to take a job running a filling station, planning to permanently retire from professional football.

Howley decided to make a comeback in 1961 following a West Virginia alumni game. The Bears traded his rights to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for second (#20-Steve Barnett) and ninth (#118-Monte Day) round draft choices in the 1963 NFL draft.

===Dallas Cowboys===
Dallas had gone 0–11–1 in their inaugural season prior to acquiring Howley, but he was still eager to play for the new team. &quot;I went back because I decided there were better things to do than run a gas station,&quot; he said. &quot;Also, I thought it would be a unique opportunity to play for Dallas, a team that was just getting started.”

Although Howley started in 1961 and 1962 as a strongside linebacker, in 1963 he switched to weakside linebacker. At the conclusion of the 1963 season, Howley was named to &quot;The Sporting News&quot; All-East NFL team for the first time. Howley holds the record for the second-most interceptions by a linebacker in a season with six, which he accomplished in .

Howley played with the Cowboys for 165 games over thirteen seasons, in two NFL championship games and two Super Bowls. He was also named most valuable player of Super Bowl V, after intercepting two passes and forcing a fumble in the Cowboys&#x27; 16–13 loss to the Colts, making him the first defensive player and non-quarterback to receive the honor. To date, he is also the only player from the losing team to win the award. Howley stated that he did not care about the award, which meant nothing to him since Dallas had lost, and only accepted the honor because it included the awarding of a brand-new station wagon that he could give to his wife as a gift.

The following season, Dallas made it back to Super Bowl VI, and Howley recorded a fumble recovery and a 41-yard interception in the Cowboys 24–3 win over the Miami Dolphins.

During his career, Howley intercepted 25 passes, returning them for 399 yards and two touchdowns. He finished with more than 100 yards in interception returns for both the 1968 and 1971 seasons. He also recovered 18 fumbles, returning them for 191 yards and one touchdown. He is second in Cowboys&#x27; history with his 17 fumbles recovered. His 97-yard return of a fumble during a game against the Atlanta Falcons on October 2, 1966, is still the second longest in Cowboys history. He also had a large number of tackles and quarterback sacks, but these statistics were not compiled until after Howley&#x27;s career ended so his unofficial sack total is 26.5 according to the Dallas Cowboys with a career-high of 5.5 sacks in 1965. Howley was named first-team All-Pro five times in his career, was a six-time Pro Bowler and was named to the All-Eastern Conference team in 1963.

Howley suffered a left knee injury from a crackback block by Charley Taylor in the win over rival Redskins late in the 1972 regular season. He missed the playoffs and retired in June. In 1973, he made a brief return to the team and appeared in one game, before retiring for good. His thirteen seasons for the Cowboys ties him for the second longest tenure in franchise history. In 1977, Howley was inducted into the Ring of Honor at Texas Stadium, the fourth player to receive that honor. He also was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame.

==Post-career==
In 2007, he was among the 17 finalists to be seniors candidates for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. On August 17, 2022, he was announced as one of the three finalists nominated by the senior committee for induction in the 2023 Hall of Fame class. On February 9, 2023, Howley was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame and was formally enshrined on August 5, with his son Scott delivering a speech on his behalf.

==Personal life==
Howley married Nancy on June 28, 1958.

Following retirement, he ran a uniform rental business in Dallas. In 1977, Howley founded Happy Hollow Ranch, a cattle and quarter horse operation near Wills Point, Texas.

Howley currently suffers from late-stage dementia.

<text>Joseph Gordon Dobson (January 20, 1917 – June 23, 1994) was an American professional baseball player, a right-handed pitcher who appeared in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Indians (1939–40), Boston Red Sox (1941–43; 1946–50; 1954) and Chicago White Sox (1951–53). After his playing career, Dobson was the pitching coach for the Red Sox for a season and a general manager in the Red Sox minor league system.

==Early life==
Dobson was born in Durant, Oklahoma. At the age of nine, he lost his left thumb and forefinger playing with a dynamite cap. Dobson entered professional baseball in 1937, pitching for the Troy Trojans of the Alabama–Florida League, winning 19 games and striking out 200 batters in 270 innings. The next season, he pitched for the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association, finishing with an 11–7 win–loss record and making the case that he was ready for the major leagues.

==MLB career==
After playing his first two MLB seasons for Cleveland in 1939 and 1940, Dobson was sent to Boston in a six-player trade that included Jim Bagby, Jr. Dobson enjoyed his best years with the Red Sox. Between 1941 and 1950 (excepting 1944–45, when he served in the United States Army during World War II), he won 106 games for the Red Sox. Dobson won a game as a starting pitcher in the 1946 World Series, and he also appeared as a relief pitcher twice during that series. His best MLB season came in 1947, when he finished with an 18–8 win–loss record. In September of that season, Dobson threw a one-hitter. He was an All-Star in 1948.

Dobson pitched for the Chicago White Sox between 1951 and 1953. The White Sox released Dobson in August 1953, and he did not pitch for the rest of the season. He was signed as a free agent by the Red Sox before the 1954 season; the team released him in May of that season after he made two relief appearances.

In a 14-season career, Dobson compiled a 137–103 record with 992 strikeouts, a 3.62 ERA, 112 complete games, 22 shutouts, 18 saves, and 2,170 innings in 414 games pitched (273 as a starter).

==Later life==
Dobson became the pitching coach for the Red Sox. He later served as general manager of the Winter Haven Red Sox of the Florida State League. He died in 1994 in Jacksonville, Florida, at the age of 77. He is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Jacksonville. In 2012, he was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame.

<text>Red Rover (also known as the king&#x27;s run and forcing the city gates) is a team game played primarily by children on playgrounds, requiring 10+ players.

The game has changed over several decades, evolving from a regular &quot;running across&quot; game, with one single catcher in the center of the playground, to a &quot;combat game&quot; with two opposing teams. The change basically consisted of merging pre-existing rules from other games with those of the original &quot;Red Rover&quot;.

== The original &quot;Red Rover&quot; ==
=== Origin of the game ===
Originally, &quot;Red Rover&quot; was a regular tag and running game with several players on one side and one person (the &quot;Red Rover&quot;) placed in the center of the playing field. The person in the center calls &quot;Red Rover, Red Rover, let&quot; [player&#x27;s name] &quot;come over!&quot; to challenge and catch one of the players who tries to reach the other side of the playing area. If the Red Rover succeeds they both return to the center. Each player tagged joins the center and helps tag the others.

According to Katherine Barber, the name of the game could be based on the novel of &quot;The Red Rover&quot; by New York author James Fenimore Cooper. It should be of no surprise that – for a chasing game – children prefer the name of a pirate who ravages the British seas.

The game was first recorded in New York in 1891 in Stewart Culin&#x27;s publication &quot;Street Games of Boys in Brooklyn, N. Y.&quot;. Until the 1940s, various descriptions of this version of &quot;Red Rover&quot; have been published, e. g. in 1907 in Dorothea Frances Canfield&#x27;s book &quot;What Shall We Do Now? Five Hundred Games and Pastimes&quot;. In the book Canfield compared &quot;Red Rover&quot; with the German game of Black Man.

In 1903, &quot;Red Rover&quot; was mentioned in &quot;Some London Street Amusements&quot; by Edwin Pugh, published in George Robert Sims&#x27; book &quot;Living London – Vol. III&quot;. It also appeared in 1916 in &quot;London Street Games&quot;, a book by Norman Douglas, although British folklorists Iona and Peter Opie stated that no record of &quot;Red Rover&quot; has been found in the United Kingdom before 1922.

The game of &quot;Red Rover&quot; was sometimes confused with the British game of &quot;Warning!&quot;, and in the U.S. with a game called &quot;Red Lion&quot;, which are both tag games but with different playing instructions. The confusion was mainly due to the similarity of names (in Moray, Scotland, the game of &quot;Warning!&quot; was primarily known by the name of &quot;Johnny Rover&quot;). Parallels, on the other hand, exist with &quot;Bar the Door&quot;, a game that was described in 1901 by Robert Craig Maclagan in &quot;The Games &amp; Diversions of Argyleshire&quot;.

=== The missing link ===

In the second half of the 1930s, the game rules started to change. A variation, representing the missing link between the original &quot;Red Rover&quot; and the team game, was published in 1945 in the United States by Neva Leona Boyd in the &quot;Handbook of Games&quot;.

The game combines the rules of the traditional pastime, such as calling and tagging players individually by a catcher placed in the center of the playground, with those of the team game, which comes into being when the increasing number of players caught in the middle forms a chain by grasping each other&#x27;s hand. The chain must be broken by the remaining players. These rules were very similar to those in the German game of Chinese Wall. Years before, in 1938, rules for &quot;Red Rover&quot; had already been adopted from Chinese Wall, e. g. the marking of a narrow field in the center of the playground, which the catcher is not allowed to leave.

By the end of the decade, the transformation process of the game was fully completed. In March 1949, Warren E. Roberts of the Indiana University Folklore Institute explained that two versions of &quot;Red Rover&quot; exist. In his article &quot;Children&#x27;s Games and Game Rhymes&quot; Roberts tried to delineate the particularities between the traditional &quot;Red Rover&quot; and the combat game of the same name and phrase. Since the beginning of the 1950s, &quot;Red Rover&quot; has been described primarily as a team game. It remained unclear why the playing rules had been modified over time.

== &quot;Red Rover&quot; as a team game ==
=== Early descriptions ===
==== Germany ====
The later combat version of &quot;Red Rover&quot; is of German or Chinese origin. An early description of the game appeared in 1862 in the German education handbook &quot;Merkbüchlein für Turner&quot; (memorandum book for sportsmen) by Eduard Angerstein under the name &quot;Kettenreißen&quot; (literally &quot;chain breaking&quot; or &quot;chain bursting&quot;). Alternative names are &quot;Kettensprengen&quot; and &quot;Kettenbrechen&quot;.

The same team game was described in 1884 – entitled &quot;Der König schickt Soldaten aus&quot; (the king sends out soldiers) – in the sixth edition of &quot;Spiele zur Übung und Erholung des Körpers und Geistes&quot; by J. C. F. GutsMuths, published in Germany by Otto Schettler in co-operation with Friedrich Wilhelm Klumpp and Justus Carl Lion.

In 1896, an English translation of the game named &quot;The King&#x27;s Run&quot; was published in the United States by William Albin Stecher in the scholastic manual &quot;A Textbook of the German-American System of Gymnastics&quot;. Further descriptions of &quot;King&#x27;s Run&quot; followed until the late 1920s in several American books on physical education.

==== China ====
A similar variant has been recorded in China in 1901 by professor Isaac Taylor Headland of the Peking University under the name &quot;Forcing the City Gates&quot;. In this game one of the children&#x27;s groups sings a rhyme before sending a boy to the enemy&#x27;s line.

In his article &quot;Child Life in China&quot; published in the &quot;Delineator&quot; magazine from January 1901, Headland annotated that this game was well-known to the majority of American children. He also mentioned numerous other games played by Chinese boys, among them Blind Man&#x27;s Buff, Hide and Seek, Prisoner&#x27;s Base, Black Man, Hockey and Shinny.

&quot;Forcing the City Gates&quot; was also described in 1909 in the recess guide &quot;Games for the Playground, Home, School and Gymnasium&quot; by Jessie H. Bancroft, using the game instructions of &quot;King&#x27;s Run&quot; as a basis.

=== Game instructions ===
The game is played between two lines of players (usually called the &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot; team, although this does not relate to the actual relative locations of the teams), positioned approximately thirty feet apart with hands or arms linked together. The game starts when the first team, in this example the North team, calls a player out, by saying the line &quot;Red Rover, Red Rover, let&quot; [player on opposite team] &quot;come over!&quot; (alternatively &quot;..., send&quot; [player&#x27;s name] &quot;right over!&quot; or &quot;..., I call&quot; [player&#x27;s name] &quot;over!&quot;).

The immediate goal for the chosen one is to run to the North team&#x27;s line and break the chain (formed by the players&#x27; hands). If the chosen one successfully breaks the chain, they may select either of the two &quot;links&quot; broken by the successful run, and take the link to join the South team. If the selected person fails, they join the North team. The South team then calls out for a person on the North team, and the play continues.

When only one player is left on a team, they must try to break through a link. If the player does not succeed, then the opposing team wins. Otherwise, the player gets a player back for their team.

== In other languages ==
In Russia and other former USSR countries, this game has been known as &quot;Ali Baba&quot;.

In Hungary the game is named &quot;Adj, király, katonát!&quot; (King, give us a soldier!) and in Serbia as &quot;Јелечкиње, барјачкиње&quot; (&quot;jelečkinje, barjačkinje&quot;, i.e., city crier and flag bearer). 

In Romania, the game is called &quot;Țara, țara vrem ostași&quot; (Country, country we want soldiers). In Republic of Moldova the line is &quot;Împărate, împărate, dați-ne un soldat!&quot; (King, king, give us a soldier). In Slovakia, it is known as &quot;Kráľu, kráľu, daj vojačka!&quot; (King, king, give a soldier!).

In the Czech Republic, the game is known as &quot;Král vysílá své vojsko&quot; (The king sends out his army), with the difference that each team chooses which of its members will attempt to break the opposite team&#x27;s line, rather than sending the member called by the other team.

== Prohibition ==
Like British Bulldog the game of &quot;Red Rover&quot; has been banned by many schools because of the risk of potential physical harm. This negative reputation has a long history.

In a description from the book &quot;Illustriertes Spielbuch für Knaben&quot;, published in Germany in 1864, game collector Hermann Wagner stated that the game of &quot;Kettenreißen&quot; (chain breaking) is perceived as violent. Its practical execution often causes peevishness among the boys. Therefore, any kind of beating and punching and the use of brute force with the help of arms and legs should be strictly prohibited.

<text>Arthur St John Adcock (17 January 1864 in London – 9 June 1930 in Richmond) was an English novelist and poet, known as A. St John Adcock or St John Adcock. He is remembered for his discovery of the then-unknown poet W. H. Davies. His daughters, Marion St John Webb and Almey St John Adcock, were also writers.

== Biography ==
Arthur St John Adcock was born on 17 January 1864 in London. He was a Fleet Street journalist for half a century, as an assiduous freelance writer. He worked initially as a law office clerk, becoming a full-time writer in 1893. Adcock built up a literary career by unrelenting efforts in circulating his manuscripts, initially also working part-time as an assistant editor on a trade journal.

He was a founder member in 1901 of Paul Henry&#x27;s literary and performing club, with Robert Lynd, Frank Rutter and others. The acting editor of &quot;The Bookman&quot; from 1908, Adcock, according to A. E. Waite who knew him, did all the work of the &quot;Bookman&quot;, nominally under its founder William Robertson Nicoll. In 1923, he became its official editor.

As an influential critic, Adcock has been classed with conservatives such as Hilaire Belloc, Edmund Gosse, Henry Newbolt, E. B. Osborn and Arthur Waugh.

Adcock married Marion Taylor in 1887, and they settled in Hampstead. Their daughters Marion St John Webb (1888-1930) and Almey St John Adcock (1894–1986), became writers.

He died on 9 June 1930 in Richmond. Adcock&#x27;s papers are held by the Bodleian Library.

==Works==
Adcock is considered one of the &quot;Cockney school novelists&quot; (not the earlier Cockney School poets), a group influenced by Charles Dickens and including also Henry Nevinson, Edwin Pugh, and William Pett Ridge. &quot;East End Idylls&quot; (1897), about the London slums, began an early trilogy, and had an introduction by the Christian Socialist James Granville Adderley, a friend. It drew on Arthur Morrison.

<doc id="1011021" wikidata="Q195210" url="?curid=1011021" title="Goethe-Gymnasium, Frankfurt">
<text>Goethe-Gymnasium is a gymnasium (secondary school) named after notable Frankfurt native Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832). It is situated in the Westend of the city of Frankfurt am Main in Germany, near the Hauptbahnhof.

It is currently the only state funded school in Germany that offers students the option of taking International Baccalaureate examinations.

The Goethe-Gymnasium offers Japanese as a third foreign language, which is rare in Germany.

==History==
The Städtisches Gymnasium was founded in 1520, and split into the Goethe-Gymnasium and the Lessing-Gymnasium in 1897. Thus, both schools descend directly from the city&#x27;s oldest school.

The school building was severely damaged by bombing in 1944. The new building designed by the architects Zitter and Kempf was dedicated in 1959.

In 1969, the Goethe-Gymnasium became the first school in Hesse to offer bilingual lessons in German and English.

==Curriculum==
Students can study numerous languages, including English, French, Latin, Russian and Japanese. The bilingual stream offers additional subjects taught in English, such as history, geography, philosophy, biology and social sciences. Further, students can choose to study Latin or French at the same time as English, beginning in grade 5, which is exceptional among state-funded secondary schools in Germany.

The Goethe-Gymnasium has been an International Baccalaureate World School since January 1972. Students can choose to take IB exams in addition to the traditional Abitur.

Students can join the school&#x27;s choir, chamber choir, flute orchestra, and two symphony orchestras.

The school owns a cottage in Oberreifenberg, the Taunus mountain range, and it is a tradition for students to spend a week there twice a year. The school&#x27;s orchestras spend their intense rehearsal periods there and final year students go there to study for their exams.

== School exchange visits ==
The Goethe-Gymnasium operates a program of exchange visits with partner schools in the following countries:

* United Kingdom (Anglo European School, Ingatestone)
* France
* United States
* Russia
* Japan
* India
* Kosovo
* Morocco

==Notable alumni==
* Hans Bethe, physicist
* Michel Friedman, politician
* Richard Goldschmidt, geneticist
* Erich Klibansky, headmaster
* Thor Kunkel, author
* Kurt Lipstein, legal scholar
* Leo Löwenthal, sociologist
* Richard Plant, professor of German and author
* Christine Schäfer, soprano
* Britta Böhler, lawyer and member of the Dutch Senate

<text>An Air Experience Flight (AEF) is a training unit of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch) whose main purpose is to give introductory flying experience to cadets from the Air Training Corps and the Combined Cadet Force. As of 2019, thirteen AEFs are active.

==History==
The AEFs, numbered from 1 to 13, were formed across the United Kingdom in 1958, all but two forming on the same day, 8 September. All were equipped with the de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk T.10 trainer. An exception was No. 5 AEF, which also operated a single Beagle Husky (&quot;XW635&quot;) from 1969 to 1989.

In the mid-1990s they were merged with co-located University Air Squadrons (UASs), the Chipmunks being replaced by the existing UAS Scottish Aviation Bulldog T.1s. No. 13 AEF at RAF Aldergrove was disbanded in 1996. In 1999, the Grob Tutor T.1 began to replace the Bulldog.

On 10 March 2016, Julian Brazier, Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Ministry of Defence), announced the return of 13 AEF and a new 14 AEF.

== Role and operations ==
The Royal Air Force (RAF) Air Experience Flights (AEF) are co-located with University Air Squadron (UAS) units; the co-located AEF and UAS units pool resources and share aircraft. Air Experience Flights provide basic flying experience, and aerobatics to eligible members of Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC), otherwise known as the Air Training Corps (ATC), along with the RAF section of the Combined Cadet Force (CCF-RAF), and other air-minded youth groups such as Air Scouts and the Girls Venture Corps Air Cadets (GVC-AC).

When two separate AEFs are co-located at the same airfield, such as No. 9 Air Experience Flight ( 9AEF) and No. 11 Air Experience Flight (11 AEF) at RAF Leeming, the two individual AEFs share the same fleet of aircraft. Just like the University Air Squadrons, all Air Experience Flights are currently commanded by No. 6 Flying Training School RAF (6 FTS).

<text>Arackaparambil Kurien Antony (born 28 December 1940) is an Indian politician and lawyer who served as the Minister of Defence of India from 2006 to 2014, making him the longest serving Defence Minister in India. He previously served as the 6th Chief Minister of Kerala from 1977 to 1978, 1995 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2004. He currently serves as the Chairman of the Disciplinary Action Committee of the All India Congress Committee, Congress Working Committee, and member of the Congress Core Group and Central Election Committee.

He has thrice served as Chief Minister of Kerala and remains as the youngest leader to assume the office at the age of 36. He was the Leader of the Opposition in the Kerala Legislative Assembly from 1996 to 2001. He also held the portfolio of Civil Supplies from 1993 to 1995. Additionally, he also served as Treasurer of All India Congress Committee from 1994 to 1995.

He served as a Member of the Rajya Sabha from 1985 to 1995 and again from 2005 to 2022. He was also elected to the Kerala Legislative Assembly on five occasions from the constituencies of Cherthala (1970, 1996 and 2001), Kazhakootam (1977) and Tirurangadi (1995).

==Early life and education==
A. K. Antony was born to a Syrian Catholic family at Cherthala, near Alleppey in Travancore as the son of Arackaparambil Kurien Pillai and Aleykutty Kurian. His father died in 1959 and Antony self-financed part of his education through odd jobs.

Antony completed his primary education at Holy Family Boys High school (Lower primary) and Government Boys High school (Upper primary), Cherthala and completed his Bachelor of Arts from Maharaja&#x27;s College, Ernakulam and Bachelor of Law from Government Law College, Ernakulam.

==Political career==
Antony entered politics as a student leader in Cherthala Taluk (Alleppey District) as an activist of the Kerala Students Union under the guidance of M. A. John. He has been an active leader of many strikes like &quot;Oru Ana Samaram&quot; (Single Penny Strike). He became the youngest president of Kerala Students Union in 1966 and also served in the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) before becoming an All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary in 1984. When he became KPCC president in 1972, he was the youngest person to hold that post. He was elected again as KPCC president in 1987, and was defeated by Vayalar Ravi in the KPCC presidential elections in 1991.

===Congress politics and party faction===
Antony founded the Congress (A) political party when he split from the Indian National Congress (Urs), a splinter group of the Indian National Congress The party was primarily active in Kerala and joined the LDF ministry headed by E. K. Nayanar during 1980–1982. After the fall of the Nayanar ministry, the party merged with the Congress in 1982, but Antony was not given any office until the death of Indira Gandhi. The members of the party have continued as a faction in the local congress afterwards.

==Chief Minister of Kerala==

Following accusations in the Rajan case, K. Karunakaran resigned and Antony, the state Congress president was appointed as the sixth Chief Minister of Kerala, on 27 April 1977 becoming the youngest Chief Minister of the state at the age of 36. Antony subsequently contested a by-election from Kazhakuttam constituency in Trivandrum as he was not a member of the assembly and won by healthy margin of over 8 thousand votes. However, differences of opinion with Indira Gandhi and Karunakaran, especially over the emergency soon cropped up, leading to a fracture in the state Congress legislature party, with the two factions being led by Antony and Karunakaran respectively. Eventually, exactly one and half years after he had been sworn in as Chief Minister, he resigned from the post as well as the Congress party following its decision to field Indira Gandhi as the candidate in the by-election in Chikmagalur, Karnataka.

Antony had to wait for over 15 years before becoming Chief Minister for a second term; again, on the back of Karunakaran&#x27;s resignation this time over the controversial ISRO spy case. On 22 March 1995, after a week-long deadlock, Antony was sworn in as Chief Minister, despite stiff opposition from Karunakaran. This term also lasted only one year before the United Democratic Front led by Antony narrowly lost the assembly elections in May 1996. Thereafter, Antony served as Leader of Opposition in the Kerala Legislative Assembly from 1996 to 2001.

In 2001, Antony led the United Democratic Front to a historic victory of 100 seats, with the Congress party winning its largest share of seats in the state assembly. On 17 May 2001, a triumphant Antony was sworn in as Chief Minister; for the first time, he was already serving as an MLA before taking the mantle of Chief Ministership.

However, his third term was extremely rocky and unstable, with Karunakaran refusing to cooperate with him and trying every tactic to overthrow him from office. This led to an erosion of public support as well as credibility. By the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress was a badly divided house and Antony had the disgrace of leading the party to its worst electoral performance since 1967. The final nail on the coffin was the defeat of K. Muraleedharan, the Electricity Minister in Antony&#x27;s cabinet (incidentally Karunakaran&#x27;s son) in the Wadakkanchery by-election, a seat widely perceived to be a Congress bastion. with his back on the wall, Antony had no option but to resign as Chief Minister. He was succeeded by his close confidante, Oommen Chandy.

It was at Antony&#x27;s behest that the decision to construct the new Legislature Complex was taken in 1977. During his tenure, he introduced the Unemployment Allowance, Festival Allowance for the State Employees, Prohibition of Arrack and the steps initiated to revive the economy of Kerala. Several initiatives were taken in the fields of Higher education, science &amp; technology, Biotechnology (including the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology at Thiruvananthapuram), and Information technology, under his ministries.
It was also under his rule that the Kannur University was inaugurated by bifurcating the University of Calicut. The University of Sanskrit was founded in 1994. The Indian Institute of Management and the National Institute of Technology at Kozhikode were established in the years 1996 and 2002 respectively. The Akshaya project was implemented in 2002 by providing E-literacy to the people those who haven&#x27;t it and opening &quot;Akshaya&quot; centres in the remote rural areas of the state, thus ensuring Internet availability all over the state, aiming to make Kerala the first complete E-literate state of India. Several initiatives were taken in the fields of Higher education, science &amp; technology, Biotechnology, and Information technology, under his ministries. The Infopark at Kochi was established in the year 2004. The IT@school project and introduction of Information Technology in school level were initiated in 2001 by Third Antony ministry, making Kerala the first Indian state to do so.

Antony carried out Asian Development Bank aided &quot;Modernisation of Government Plan&quot;. He also liberalised education by allowing several private engineering and medical colleges to open in Kerala and championed the state as an investment destination. He also ordered the closure of the Kerala Coca-Cola plant in 2004 citing drought and the non-availability of drinking water.

==Government offices==

===Union Minister for Civil Supplies===

Antony was a Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha between 1993 and 1995 and was the Minister for Civil Supplies, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution for a year in 1994 during the tenure of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. He resigned on moral grounds as food minister in 1994 when his ministry was involved in a sugar import scandal, despite there being no allegations against him.

===Union Minister for Defence===

In 2005, Antony entered the Rajya Sabha and was inducted into the Union Council of Ministers as Defence Minister following Natwar Singh&#x27;s expulsion from the Congress and Pranab Mukherjee&#x27;s transfer to the Ministry of External Affairs. After the Congress again won the elections in 2009 and formed the government once again under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Antony retained the portfolio of Defence for the second term becoming the longest-serving Defence Minister of India in a continuous stint for 8 years. His &quot;Buy and Make Indian&quot; campaign saw the cancellation of billion of dollars in purchases of foreign arms, while at the same time stunting domestic production by restricting investments.

===Other positions===
He held the post of Chairman of the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata (2012 to 2014), President of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses and Chancellor of Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (2006 to 2014).

===Political party role===
In the Manmohan Singh Cabinet, Antony was the senior member of the Cabinet Committees on Accommodation, Economic Affairs, Parliamentary Affairs, Political Affairs, and Security.

He is considered as political guru of Rahul Gandhi.

Antony&#x27;s political skills and long experience in government have also led him to heading a large number of committees of Ministers in the government, a device that has been employed to obtain consensus within the members of the governing coalition on contentious issues.
==Issues==
===Civil Services reform===
In order to professionalise the Civil Services, Antony led the decision on creation of a Central Civil Services Authority (CCSA) to oversee the higher bureaucracy.

===Impeachment of Chief Justice of India===

In 2018, Antony is one of the signatories to impeachment notice against Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra.

==Public image==
Antony is known for his incorruptible record and simple personal life and his intolerance towards corruption in public life. He was ranked among the top 10 Most Powerful Indians for the year 2012 by &quot;The Indian Express&quot;.

10th Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee admired Antony for his simplicity, gentleness and his zeal for reforms and change as a way to ensure acceleration of Kerala&#x27;s all-round development.

After Pranab Mukherjee was nominated for the 2012 President of India election, Antony was placed as the second-in-command after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the Cabinet of India.

Leaked diplomatic cables said Antony was one of the only two leaders, the other being P. R. Dasmunsi, who criticised Sanjay Gandhi during the 1976 AICC session in Guwahati during Emergency when the latter&#x27;s political standing was on the rise, asking &quot;what sacrifices he has made for the party or the country&quot;.

==Personal life==

Antony is married to Elizabeth who is a Kerala High Court lawyer and is the founder of the Navoothan Charitable Foundation. They have two sons. In April 2023, his son Anil Antony joined the Bharatiya Janata Party. Antony identifies himself as an atheist.

<text>Leslie Parrish (born Marjorie Hellen; March 13, 1935) is an American actress, activist, environmentalist, writer, and producer. She worked under her birth name for six years before changing it in 1959.

==Early life==
As a child, Parrish lived in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey. At the age of 10, her family finally settled in Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania. At the age of 14, Parrish was a talented and promising piano and composition student at the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music. At the age of 16, Parrish earned money for her tuition by working as a maid and a waitress, and by teaching piano. At the age of 18, to earn enough money to continue her education at the Conservatory, her mother persuaded her to become a model for one year.

==Modeling and acting==
In April 1954, as a 19-year-old model with the Conover Agency in New York City, Parrish was under contract to NBC-TV as &quot;Miss Color TV&quot; (she was used during broadcasts as a human test pattern to check accuracy of skin tones). She was quickly discovered and signed with Twentieth Century Fox in Hollywood. In 1956, she was put under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Because acting allowed her to help her family financially, she remained in Hollywood and gave up her career in music.

==Films and television==

Parrish co-starred/guest-starred in numerous films and television shows throughout the 1960s and 1970s. She gained wide attention in her first starring role as Daisy Mae in the movie version of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1959), where she changed her name from Marjorie Hellen to Leslie Parrish at the director&#x27;s request. She appeared in the film &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962), playing Laurence Harvey&#x27;s on-screen fiancée, Jocelyn Jordan. Other film credits include starring opposite Kirk Douglas in &quot;For Love or Money&quot; (1963) and Jerry Lewis in &quot;Three on a Couch&quot; (1966), among others.

Parrish amassed an extensive résumé of television credits. Among many other credits, Parrish appeared in guest starring roles on episodes of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;Family Affair&quot;, &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;Good Morning World&quot;, &quot;Police Story&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;McCloud&quot;. In 1967, she guest-starred on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Who Mourns for Adonais?&quot;, portraying Lt. Carolyn Palamas, the love interest of the character Apollo. In February 1968, she played opposite Peter Breck in the episode &quot;A Bounty on a Barkley&quot; of &quot;The Big Valley&quot;. The following month, Parrish made her first guest appearance on &quot;Mannix&quot; in the episode &quot;The Girl in the Frame&quot;.

Parrish served as associate producer on the film version of &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; (1973). Among other things, she hired the director of photography Jack Coufferwho later received an Academy Award nomination for his effortsand she was responsible for the care of the film&#x27;s real-life seagulls, which she kept inside a room at a Holiday Inn in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California for the duration of the shoot. When the relationship between author Richard Bach and director Hall Bartlett disintegrated and a lawsuit followed, Parrish was appointed as the mediator between the two men, but the mediation failed. Ultimately, the film was released in theaters with Bach&#x27;s name taken off the screenwriting credits, while Bartlett demoted Parrish&#x27;s credit in the finished film from associate producer to researcher.

In 1975, Parrish appeared in the low budget B-Movie &quot;The Giant Spider Invasion&quot; 

While acting provided financial stability, her main interest was in social causes including the anti-war and civil rights movements and, as far back as the mid 1950s, the environment.

==Political activism==
Parrish&#x27;s interests and activities in social movements and politics grew to become her main work. She was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War, a member of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, a group of notable women who fought against the war and for civil rights. In June 1967, the then-32-year-old Parrish participated in a peace march in the Century City district of Los Angeles, where she and thousands of other protestors were attacked and beaten by the LAPD and the National Guard. President Lyndon Johnson was present at the Century Plaza Hotel and helicopters were flying overhead with machine guns pointed at the marchers.

Parrish started to make speeches in the Los Angeles area, telling residents what the media did not report and speaking out against the war. Impressed with her speaking abilities, several professors from UCLA aligned with the anti-war movement asked her to organize more like-minded actors and actresses who would be willing to speak out. Two weeks later, Parrish had created &quot;STOP!&quot; (Speakers and Talent Organized for Peace), an organization of two dozen members ready to engage the public. Shortly thereafter, the organization grew to 125 speakers, and many more subsequently.

On August 6, 1967, Parrish helped organize a protest march of 17,000 people on the &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; of Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, which received extensive media coverage and national attention. She also created a popular bumper sticker: &#x27;Suppose they gave a war and no one came&#x27;. Parrish and her friends distributed hundreds of them from their vehicles. Walter Cronkite reported that Robert F. Kennedy had one in his plane. Someone later published the bumper sticker, changing the original wording to &#x27;WHAT IF they gave a war and no one came&#x27; but to Parrish, the important thing was spreading that message.

In October 1967, a private meeting was arranged between Parrish and Kennedy by mutual friend and well-known Kennedy photographer, Stanley Tretick. She begged Kennedy to run for president, telling him that huge, influential organizations opposed to the war in Vietnam were ready to support him were he to run. Kennedy refused again and again, saying he could not oppose Lyndon Johnson, a sitting president. On November 30, Eugene McCarthy, a little-known senator, declared he would run against the war and challenge Johnson. Parrish was elected chair of his speaker&#x27;s bureau and utilized STOP! to develop support for McCarthy. On March 16, 1968, when Kennedy announced that he would run for president, Parrish remained loyal to McCarthy and was elected a delegate to represent him in August at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

On April 4, 1968, Parrish and Leonard Nimoy (who was a STOP! member and supporter of Eugene McCarthy) flew to San Francisco to open McCarthy&#x27;s new headquarters there. After they left, they learned of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Nimoy and Parrish cried during the speeches they gave that evening.

On June 6, Kennedy was assassinated on the night he won the California and South Dakota primaries. In August, during the Chicago Democratic Convention, McCarthy delegates, including Parrish, spent little time on the convention floor, as Hubert Humphrey had already collected the most delegates through the closed caucus and convention systems in place (in those days) in 40 of the 50 states. On the night of the nomination, August 28, Parrish joined the McCarthy delegates outside the Hilton Hotel, where violent actions by police against anti-war demonstrators and spectators were being covered by live television.

While still in Chicago, the peace movement began working toward the 1972 election, hoping to elect George McGovern. Parrish served as a McGovern delegate at the 1972 Democratic Convention in Miami, Florida. McGovern lost to Richard Nixon.

During this era of political activism, Parrish worked in numerous political campaigns (presidential, gubernatorial, senatorial, congressional, mayoral) and with many different organizations, producing public events and fundraisers for them. Her last major production was the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (MOBE), held November 16, 1969 at San Francisco&#x27;s Polo Grounds.

==Los Angeles municipal government==
In 1969, Parrish joined many in an effort to remove Los Angeles mayor Sam Yorty from office. She supported and campaigned for a former police lieutenant named Tom Bradley, who was then the city&#x27;s first black city councilman. Despite high polling numbers prior to the election, Bradley lost to Yorty, giving rise to what was later known as &quot;The Bradley Effect.&quot; Next day, he decided to run again, and over the next four years Parrish worked with him closely to help secure his victory in the next mayoral election. In 1973, Bradley became Los Angeles&#x27;s first black mayor. Parrish was one of forty activist citizens who served on Bradley&#x27;s Blue Ribbon Commission to choose new Los Angeles Commissioners. Parrish and Tom Bradley remained friends for many years.

==Creator of innovative television==
The lack of media coverage during the Century City riots in 1967 prompted Parrish to think of a new way to cover such events live to prevent suppression and/or manipulation of the news. In 1969, she began to create a television station that would devote itself to covering public events and provide in-depth analysis and discussions of important developments in the world. In 1974, KVST-TV (Viewer Sponsored Television, Channel 68, Los Angeles) went on the air as part of the PBS system of stations. Film notables, business people and local activists formed the board of directors and provided support for the unique station. After a difficult start, KVST was receiving positive reviews in Los Angeles and nationwide attention. However, by 1976, internal dissension on the board of directors led to the demise of the station; the signal was turned off and the licence turned in.

==Environmental activism==
While living in Oregon, Parrish saw devastated forests managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and decided to protest a local timber sale. With two neighbors, she and Bach established an organization called &quot;Threatened and Endangered: Little Applegate Valley&quot; (TELAV). They worked for two years researching and writing a 600-page legal and scientific protest of BLM&#x27;s logging of forests which would not regenerate, which was illegal. The BLM assistant state director eventually agreed, telling the Medford &quot;Mail Tribune&quot; that ...&quot;The sale involves enough improprieties in BLM rules and procedures that it can’t be legally awarded. In order to comply with our own procedures we had no choice but to withdraw the sale and reject all bids.&quot; The TELAV protest document served as the basis for many future timber sale protests in the U.S. and Canada. TELAV continues to fight for the environment to this day and the Little Applegate Valley has never been logged.

In 1999, Parrish created a 240-acre (97 ha) wildlife sanctuary on Orcas Island (in the San Juan Islands, Washington State) to save it from normal development techniques which include logging. She named it the &quot;Spring Hill Wildlife Sanctuary&quot;. 

==Marriages==
Parrish married songwriter Ric Marlow in 1955; the couple divorced in 1961. In 1981, she married Richard Bach, the author of the 1970 book &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot;, whom she met during the making of the 1973 movie of the same name. She was a major element in two of his subsequent books—&quot;The Bridge Across Forever&quot; (1984) and &quot;One&quot; (1988)—which primarily focused on their relationship and Bach&#x27;s concept of soulmates. They divorced in 1999.

<doc id="1011052" wikidata="Q5409577" url="?curid=1011052" title="Eumetcast">
<text>EUMETCast is a method of disseminating various (mainly satellite based) meteorological data operated by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). The main purpose is the dissemination of EUMETSAT&#x27;s own data, but various data from other providers are broadcast as well.
EUMETCast is a contribution to GEONETCast and IGDDS (WMO&#x27;s Integrated Global Data Dissemination Service) and provides data for GEOSS and GMES.

== Services ==
EUMETCast satellite includes data and derived products from the geostationary Meteosat satellites, Meteosat-7 (over the Indian Ocean), 8, 9 and 10 and the Metop-A, B &amp; C and NOAA polar orbiting satellites, plus data from other meteorological programmes, such as Jason-2 (the Ocean Surface Topography Mission).

Examples of data and products on EUMETCast satellite:

* Space-based observations from the Meteosat, Metop, Jason-2 satellites. At their most frequent, these data are delivered to users within five minutes of processing.
* Land application products covering Europe, Africa and South America.
* Global and regional marine meteorological and ocean surface products.
* Atmospheric chemistry products

A range of third-party meteorological and environmental products are also available. The range includes:

* Level 1 satellite data and derived products from a range of atmospheric, marine and land monitoring satellites (e.g. GOES-E &amp; GOES-W, S-NPP, Himawari, FY2, Saral, Mega-Tropiques Aqua/Terra MODIS, Sentinel)
* European Commission Copernicus and FP7 funded data and products
* In-situ observational data
* Numerical weather forecasts

In 2016 EUMETSAT started a demonstration EUMETCast Terrestrial service, which sends multicast satellite data in Europe via the National Research and Education Network (NRENs) and the GÉANT infrastructure. Only organisations eligible for access to a NRENs can access the service, if the NREN supports multicasting.

The terrestrial service will re-use components familiar to users of the EUMETCast satellite service and then, as for EUMETCast satellite, subscribes to the related multicast channels to receive the data.

== Transmission technology ==
EUMETCast uses the DVB-S MPEG2 stream for encapsulating IP frames (IP over DVB). At this IP layer, IP Multicast techniques are used for distributing the file based content. For this purpose, TelliCast (an IP multicast software from Newtec (formerly Tellitec)) is used. In 2014 EUMETCast was migrated to a DVB-S2 transponder, which allows for higher bandwidth rates, and in 2017 a second DVB-S2 transponder was added for the European service providing Sentinel satellite data.

Transmission is via Eutelsat&#x27;s 10A satellite (in Ku band), Eutelsat&#x27;s 5 WEST A satellite (C band) and SES-6 (C band). 

Eutelsat 10A supplies coverage across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Eutelsat 5 supplies European African and western Asia coverage. SES-6 is located at 319.5º East, its tailored, high-powered hemispheric beam provides simultaneous coverage of both Europe and the Americas. 

The technology used makes it possible for end users to receive the data with regular off-the-shelf satellite TV equipment and a PC.

== Licensing ==
The data policy distinguishes between essential and licensed data. Generally data may be used free of charge for scientific, educational or personal purposes, however for receiving licensed data registration is necessary and a hardware key (€ 40) has to be bought in order to decrypt the content. A License for the TelliCast client software must be obtained for € 60. From February 2019, for all country, these items are available from EUMETSAT at no charge .

<doc id="1011066" wikidata="Q8024489" url="?curid=1011066" title="Winds Code">
<text>The &quot;Winds Code&quot; is a confused military intelligence episode relating to the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, especially the advance-knowledge debate claiming that the attack was expected.

The Winds Code was an instruction from Tokyo to Japanese legations worldwide that diplomatic relations were in danger of being ruptured. While the code was set up, the problem is whether the code was ever transmitted or not. Amid all the other indicators of approaching conflict, it seems likely that the message was never sent, or at least never recorded at a high level in the US command structure.

In any case a code message in a news or weather programs was not needed, as ordinary commercial communication facilities were available to Japan right up to the December 7 attack. Pearl Harbor historians Gordon Prange and Roberta Wholstetter sidestep the issue by saying that the intercepted codes-destruct messages of 2 December were a more accurate indication of war breaking out. Both Henry Clausen and John Costello see the &quot;Winds Code&quot; controversy as a red herring and coming close to disinformation (Clausen) or only as an alert to legations (Costello).

The code was set up, so that in case of an emergency leading to the interruption of regular communication channels, a coded message would be inserted into the daily Japanese international news broadcast. Concealed within the meteorological reports, and repeated twice, would be &quot;East wind rain&quot; (&quot;Higashi no kaze ame&quot;), &quot;West wind clear&quot; (&quot;Nishi no kaze hare&quot;) or &quot;North wind cloudy&quot; (&quot;Kitano kaze kumori&quot;), the first indicating an imminent major breach with the United States, the second a break with the British (including the invasion of Thailand); the third indicating a break with the Soviet Union. Presumably if sent both the first and second messages would have been sent, the third referring to the Soviet Union would not have been applicable in 1941. 

The signal setting up the code was intercepted and broken by USN cryptographer Commander Laurance Safford at OP-20-G in Washington. Consequently, a close monitoring of the Japanese daily shortwave broadcasts was instituted for the codes, dubbed the &quot;Winds Code&quot; by the Americans.

USN Chief Warrant Officer Ralph T. Briggs, an operator at Station M, the Navy&#x27;s East Coast intercept installation at Cheltenham in Maryland, stated he logged &quot;Higashi no kaze ame&quot; (&quot;East wind rain&quot;) on the morning of December 4; this was transmitted to the Fleet Intelligence Office at Pearl through the secure TWX line. Briggs was subsequently given a four-day pass as a reward (and was away in Cleveland on the 7th). At the FIO, Commander Laurance Safford states he reported this message to his superiors in Washington. At this point there is no further record of the message. Some eight other Army and Navy officers testified that they, too, had seen a winds execute message. But two of the men completely reversed their original testimony and the others turned out to have only vague recollections.

None of the official inquiries took Safford&#x27;s statement as fact; the most generous reporting that he was &quot;misled&quot; and that his memory was faulty. His case was not helped by his uncertainty over the date, although Lt Alwin Kramer also agreed in 1944 that he had seen Safford&#x27;s yellow teletype sheet.

It has been claimed that in the week after the attack there was significant document &#x27;loss&#x27; at the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington. In 2008 historians from the National Security Agency went back and analyzed all American and foreign intelligence sources and decrypted cables. They came to the conclusion that &quot;winds execute&quot; message never reached Washington. If there was a message then the blame would fall on the military for not passing it on.

Following the end of the war, Japanese officials advised General MacArthur that no Winds signal was ever sent relating to the United States. This is supported by the testimony of Commander Joseph Rochefort (based in Naval HQ in Pearl Harbor). However an American intelligence team in Japan led by Colonel Abraham Sinkov of Central Bureau in September and October 1945 found they were told &quot;half-truths or outright lies&quot; by Japanese intelligence specialists, partly as there were rumours that the Americans would execute those involved in intelligence. The team was not allowed to reveal American intelligence successes. However some Japanese (Arisue and Nishimura) were more forthcoming when they saw that the Americans were interested in Japanese help against the Soviets.

The coded &quot;Winds message&quot; was reported from Hong Kong, late on Sunday, December 7, local time. The signal was &quot;higashi no kaze, ame; nishi no kaze, hare&quot; (&quot;Easterly wind, rain; Westerly wind, fine&quot;); meaning that Japan was about to declare war on Britain and America (and attacked British Malaya before Hawaii). A skeleton staff had been left behind in Hong Kong when the British Far East Combined Bureau (FECB) moved to Singapore in August 1939.

<doc id="1011075" wikidata="Q983475" url="?curid=1011075" title="M. K. Stalin">
<text>Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin (, , born 1 March 1953) is an Indian politician and former actor serving as the 8th and current Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu since 2021. The son of the former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, Stalin has been the president of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party since 28 August 2018. He served as the 45th Mayor of Chennai from 1996 to 2002 and the 1st Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from 2009 to 2011. Stalin was placed 24th on the list of India&#x27;s Most Powerful Personalities in 2022 by &quot;The Indian Express&quot;.

== Early life and family ==
Stalin is the third son of 2nd Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and DMK Chief M. Karunanidhi, and was born to his wife, Dayalu Ammal. Stalin was born in Madras, now Chennai, on 1 March 1953. Karunanidhi was addressing a condolence meeting for Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who died only four days after his child was born, and thus decided to name his son after Stalin.

Stalin studied at the Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School. He completed a pre-university course at Vivekananda College, and obtained a history degree from Presidency College, Chennai of University of Madras in 1973. Stalin was conferred an Honorary Doctorate by Anna University on 1 August 2009.

Stalin married Durga (alias Shantha) on 20 August 1975, and has two children.

His son is Udhayanidhi Stalin, an actor and politician. Udhayanidhi is married to Kiruthiga Udhayanidhi, an Indian Tamil film director.

His daughter is Senthamarai Sabareesan, an entrepreneur and educationist. She is the director of Sunshine Schools, Chennai. Senthamarai is married to Sabareesan Vedamurthy, an entrepreneur and political strategist.

Like his father and namesake, Stalin has publicly disclosed that he is an atheist. But he also said that he is not against any religious beliefs.

== Politics ==
His political career began in his early teens when he started the DMK Gopalapuram Youth Wing with several friends. As a 14 year old, he campaigned for his uncle, Murasoli Maran, in the 1967 elections. In 1973, Stalin was elected to the General committee of the DMK.

He came to the limelight when he was jailed in Central Prison, Madras under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) for protesting against the Emergency in 1976. He was beaten up in custody and a fellow DMK prisoner C. Chittibabu died of injuries and police torture while protecting him. He wrote his final year BA exams while in prison. Stalin formed the DMK youth wing. In 1982 Stalin became the youth wing secretary of DMK, a post he held for more than four decades.

== DMK Youth Wing ==
In 1968, Stalin started the DMK Youth Wing in Gopalapuram in a barber shop with his friends. In 1983, he transformed the Gopalapuram Youth Wing into a Statewide phenomenon and led the frontal as a Secretary, a position he held for more than four decades. During the early stages of the Youth Wing, he travelled across Tamil Nadu with other members to mentor fellow youth of the state in key areas of active politics at the grassroots level.

==Electoral performance==

Stalin contested the Assembly polls unsuccessfully from Thousand Lights constituency in Chennai. In 1989 Stalin contested Assembly polls from Thousand Lights constituency again, and won. The DMK government got dismissed in 1991 before completing its full five-year term. In 1991, he contested for the third time from the same Assembly constituency, but lost to K. A. Krishnaswamy of the AIADMK. Again in 1996, Stalin won the election as an MLA from the Thousand Lights constituency.

In 2003, Stalin became Deputy General Secretary of the DMK.
In 2011 Stalin changed his constituency for the first time in his political career, moving from Thousand Lights to Kolathur constituency on the outskirts of Chennai city.

=== Mayor of Chennai ===
Stalin became the city&#x27;s first directly elected mayor in 1996. He coined a pet project called &quot;Singara Chennai&quot; (Beautiful Chennai), lauded for improving Chennai&#x27;s infrastructure. His efforts in improving city infrastructure earned him the title of &quot;Managara Thanthai&quot; (father of the city).

During his tenure as mayor, Stalin modernised the garbage disposal system of the city of Chennai by giving priority to cleaning works. He implemented integrated development projects such as health, public construction and schools. He solved the congestion of the city of Chennai by building huge flyovers. During his first tenure, 9 major flyovers and 49 short bridges were built. He also improved the standard of Corporation Schools to be on par with private schools. In addition, parks and fountains were set up at 18 major junctions. 81 parks were cleaned and properly maintained. Saplings were planted at the Chennai Marina, the second largest beach in the world. The slaughterhouse at Perambur have been modernised to avoid polluting the environment. During his tenure, it was decided to build flyovers on 10 congested roads before the end of his term. ₹95 crores have been allocated for the construction of flyovers. However, 30% of the funds were left over when the flyovers were opened according to him. He was re-elected Mayor for the 2nd time in 2001.

However, the then Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa enacted the Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment) Act, in 2002, which prevents a person from holding two elected posts in the government. This law was applied retroactively to Stalin&#x27;s case (he was an elected Thousand Lights MLA) in a move widely seen as aimed at removing him as Chennai&#x27;s mayor. However, the Madras High Court struck down the law stating that legislative bodies were not &quot;prevented&quot; from making laws affecting the &quot;substantive rights&quot; of persons retrospectively. However, the court held that under Madras (now Chennai) City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919, a person cannot be mayor for two consecutive terms, though unlike Stalin, earlier mayors were not directly elected. MK Stalin did not appeal in the Supreme Court.

=== Minister ===
In the 2006 Assembly Elections, the DMK regained control of the state assembly. Stalin became the Minister for Rural Development and Local Administration in the Government of Tamil Nadu and retained this office throughout his term. During his tenure, he was instrumental in the extensive spread of Women Self-Help Groups across the State by establishing 1,75,493 Women SHGs. He also established various comprehensive drinking water projects such as Hogenakkal and Ramanathapuram water schemes. In 2008, he became treasurer of DMK.

=== Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu ===
On 29 May 2009, Stalin was nominated as Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu by Governor Surjit Singh Barnala. He was first Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.

=== Opposition leader ===
During the 2016 Assembly election, Stalin went on a statewide tour titled &quot;Namakku Naame&quot; to appeal to the youth. Stalin won the Kolathur constituency and was appointed as the opposition leader. In 2017, Stalin went on another &quot;Namakku Naame&quot; tour. In 2018, his father Karunanidhi died, leaving Stalin the president of the DMK.

=== Secular Progressive Alliance (2019 general election – present) ===
Stalin formed the Secular Progressive Alliance in Tamil Nadu and led the alliance in 2019 general election in the state. The Secular Progressive Alliance won 39 out of 40 Parliament seats, and 12 out of 21 in the Assembly by-election, with 52% of the vote. It was his first victory since taking charge as DMK President.

== Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu ==

In the 2021 Assembly elections, Stalin led the campaign for the Secular Progressive Alliance. They won 159 seats out of 234, with the DMK itself winning an absolute majority with 132 seats. Stalin took his oath as chief minister on 7 May 2021 along with the rest of his cabinet.

Having taken oath amid the second wave of the pandemic, Stalin started a war room to monitor the status of beds, ambulances, and oxygen supply. He attended an SOS call of a lady, spoke with her for 30 minutes, and arranged for her a bed at a hospital. He wore a PPE suit and visited the COVID-19 patients at their wards &quot;against advice&quot; in Government ESI Medical College Hospital. A new economic advisory council was set up with leading economists, including Esther Duflo, Raghuram Rajan, Jean Drèze, Arvind Subramanian, and former Finance Secretary S Narayan. Tamil Nadu was branded as a state with highest novel coronavirus vaccine wastage in the previous government but the Stalin government made the state to top in the list of states with lowest COVID-19 wastage policy.

Stalin handed over appointment orders of the HR &amp; CE Department to trained aspirants of all castes as temple priests in August 2021. Stalin quoted the reformist leader Periyar in an official release which said Periyar fought for equal rights in worship for all those who believe in God. In August 2021, Stalin ranked first among all Chief ministers of India with 42% in favour, in the &quot;Mood of the Nation&quot; survey done by the India Today magazine. Stalin changed the name of Sri Lankan Tamil refugee camps to called ‘rehabilitation camps&#x27; and said &quot;They are not orphans, we are there for them&quot;. In September 2021, he announced that Periyar&#x27;s birth anniversary will be celebrated as Social Justice Day every year.

In June 2021, Stalin announced that the state law ministry will review the legal cases filed by the previous government. In September 2021, Stalin&#x27;s government withdrew over 5570 legal cases filed by the previous AIADMK government from the past 10 years against the journalists and the protestors seeking the repeal of the three farm laws promulgated by the Union government, Citizenship Amendment Act, methane extraction, neutrino project, Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant and the Chennai-Salem Expressway project.

In May 2022, Stalin hailed the release of Perarivalan, convicted in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, and hugged him on his visit of gratitude at the Chennai Airport.

*Member (2021–23) Committee on Rules

=== Ungal Thoguthiyil Mudhalamaichar ===
One of the key achievements of Stalin as the Chief Minister is the &#x27;Ungal Thoguthiyil Mudhalamaichar&#x27; (Chief Minister in your Constituency), which is a robust grievance redressal service set up to resolve petitions and problems raised by the constituents. The timely redressal system took the state by storm as over 2.30 lakh out of 4.57 lakh grievances had been addressed by Stalin in his first 100 days of taking office.

The department originated from a programme &#x27;Ungal Thoguthiyil Stalin&#x27;, which was initiated by DMK President Stalin during his election campaign. Stalin had collected grievances from the citizens and assured them that their issues would be addressed in 100 days once he took office. Experts and journalist Govi Lenin called the scheme a direct reflection of the DMK&#x27;s core principle, &#x27;Makkalidam Sel&#x27; (Go to the People) coined by the party&#x27;s founding member, C. N. Annadurai.

=== Tamil Nadu&#x27;s first agriculture budget ===
Stalin released Tamil Nadu&#x27;s first ever agricultural budget on 14 August 2021, which was dedicated to farmers protesting against the farm laws passed by the Union Government. The one of a kind budget was prepared after consulting farmers from 18 districts of the state and it predominantly aimed at increasing the cultivable land from the existing 60 per cent to 75 per cent. At present, about 10 lakh hectares of land is under cultivation and the agriculture budget promises to increase it to 11.75 lakh hectares.

Under the budget, the newly launched ‘Kalaignarin Anaithu Grama Orunginaindha Velan Valarchi Thittam’, has been introduced to convert wasteland into cultivable land.

=== Illam Thedi Kalvi ===
Stalin launched the ‘Illam Thedi Kalvi’ scheme on 19 October 2021, notably India&#x27;s largest volunteer-based education program”, where over 3.3 million students across 92,000 habitations are being taught by 200,000 women volunteers for 90 minutes every day.

Domain experts and Data scientists have praised the ingenuity of the scheme stating that over 24% of the total recovery from learning loss can be attributed to the ‘Illam Thedi Kalvi’ sessions and that the recovery has been a lot more progressive among the disadvantaged group.

=== Innuyir Kappom - Nammai Kakkum 48 ===
Stalin launched ‘Innuyir Kappom-Nammai Kakkum 48’ on 18 November 2021 through which the State government will bear the expenses of emergency care for accident victims for the first 48 hours. Rolling out the scheme at Stalin said that the government was paying special attention to reducing road accidents, preventing fatalities and improving road safety. The scheme is aimed at reducing deaths due to road accidents. A total of 609 hospitals including 201 government hospitals and 408 private hospitals are linked to the scheme. All persons injured in road accidents whether they are covered or not under the Chief Minister&#x27;s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS), or even those who belong to other States or countries that occur in Tamil Nadu limits would receive treatment for the first 48 hours free of charge. As many as 81 treatment packages have been identified for accident victims in the hospitals where they shall be were admitted for the first 48 hours with a ceiling of ₹1 lakh per individual. One of the key highlights of the scheme is that the government would bear the emergency treatment expenses for the first 48 hours in private hospitals, as majority of the lives could be saved if treated appropriately within 48 hours.

== Chief Minister&#x27;s Dashboard ==
Stalin launched the ‘CM Dashboard Monitoring System’ at his office. On 23 December 2021 which will enable him to track all welfare schemes, including the status of their implementation, fund allocation and the number of beneficiaries. The dashboard is set to help in proper monitoring, more efficiency, elimination of delays and prompt decision making. It will also update the Chief Minister on the water storage level in key dams, rainfall patterns, daily report on crimes, progress of housing schemes, employment trends, civil supplies in the State. The dashboard will display the status of pleas and representations made on the Chief Minister Helpline and under the ‘CM In Your Constituency’ scheme.

=== Naan Mudhalvan ===
Stalin launched the ‘Naan Mudhalvan’ scheme, on 1 March 2022, which aims to equip about 10 lakh youth across the State annually with skills that will help them realise their talents for the benefit of the country. He also launched a new portal for this scheme. The scheme aims to identify, train and offer career and academic guidance to talented students in government-run and State-aided educational institutions. It also aims to offer spoken English lessons to enable students to face interview panels successfully. The scheme will offer training capsules in coding and robotics to keep pace with technological advancements. Psychological counsellors and medical doctors will offer guidance on nutrition, physical fitness and overall development of the student&#x27;s personality.

=== Green Tamil Nadu Mission ===
Stalin launched the Green Tamil Nadu Mission on 24 September 2022, that aims at increasing the green cover in the state from 23.7% to 33% in the next ten years. The mission will facilitate tree planting initiatives, online seedlings purchase via the Green Tamil Nadu Mission portal.

=== Pudhumai Penn ===
Stalin launched the Moovalur Ramamirtham Ammaiyar Higher Education Assurance scheme titled &#x27;Pudhumai Penn&#x27; at a function in Chennai on 5 September 2022, in the presence of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The scheme was transformed from Moovalur Ramamirtham Ammaiyar Memorial Marriage Assistance Scheme to the Moovalur Ramamirtham Ammaiyar Higher Education Assurance Scheme after recognising that in higher education, the enrolment ratio of girls from government schools was quite low. During the event Kejriwal unveiled 26 schools of excellence and 15 model schools set up by the Tamil Nadu government. Under Pudhumai Penn scheme, girl students, who studied from Class V to Class XII in state government schools would be paid a monthly assistance of ₹1,000 till they complete their graduation or diploma. Through the scheme, about six lakh girls would be benefited every year. The State government allocated ₹698 crore in the 2022-23 Budget for the scheme.

Stalin also announced that 25 schools run by Municipal Corporations would be elevated as Schools of Excellence in the first phase at a cost of ₹171 crore. The classrooms in these Schools of Excellence would be modernised and art, literature, music, dance, sports among others would be promoted among students.

=== Chief Minister&#x27;s Breakfast Scheme ===
Stalin launched the ‘Chief Minister’s Breakfast Scheme’ on 15 September 2022 to prevent hunger and nutritional deficiency in children. The scheme is set to improve the nutritional status of students, eliminate deficiencies such as malnutrition and anaemia, and encourage children in poor households to attend schools.

The cause of concern for Anemia among children as a major health problem in Tamil Nadu was highlighted in the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS) (2019–21) report. Stalin&#x27;s Breakfast Scheme is set to minimise, if not eliminate, this inadequacy. The breakfast scheme will be implemented at a cost of ₹33.56 crore in more than 1,500 government-run schools across the state where over 1.14 lakh primary government school children will benefit from it. It is Stalin&#x27;s hope that the education-nutrition matrix will be an inspiring model for other states.

=== Governing Council on Climate Change ===
Stalin set up a 22-member Tamil Nadu Governing Council on Climate Change (GCCC) on 23 October 2022. Montek Singh Ahluwalia, economist; Nandan M Nilekani, co-founder and chairman of Infosys Board; Erik Solheim, Sixth Executive Director of United Nations Environment Programme; Dr Ramesh Ramachandran, founder-director of National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management; G Sundarrajan, co-ordinator of Poovulagin Nanbargal) and Nirmala Raja, Chairperson, Ramco Community Services are among the members.

The GCCC council has been formed to provide a policy directive to the Tamil Nadu Climate Change Mission, advise on climate adaptation and mitigation activities, provide guidance to the Tamil Nadu State Action Plan on climate change and guide the implementation strategy on climate action.

The terms of reference of the GCCC includes providing guidance to the Climate Change Mission and long-term climate-resilient development pathways, strategies and action plan which will help improve livelihoods, social and economic well-being and responsible environmental management.

The council will periodically monitor outcomes and deliverables based on the strategies being followed. Besides, it will give a continued and sustained push for research, collaboration, and interdisciplinary work, in close coordination with researchers and policymakers.

The council will evaluate the efficacy of existing policies on climate change and learn from sustainable practices across the country and the world for suitable adaptation. The State Environment, Climate Change and Forest Department Secretary Supriya Sahu will be the convenor of the council.

It is imperative to note that, Tamil Nadu has been spearheading several path-breaking initiatives in the field of climate change and has set up three key missions viz., Tamil Nadu Green Mission, Tamil Nadu Climate Change Mission and the Tamil Nadu Wetlands Mission.

=== Egalitarianism and social justice in Tamil Nadu ===
Stalin initiated the process to appoint persons of all castes (contrary to the hereditary Brahmin priests) as archakas (priests) for the temples in the State on 15 August 2021, and assured steps will be taken to appoint those trained by the government during the previous DMK government.

Stalin maintained that the move will fulfill the dream of former Chief Minister M Karunanidhi, and Periyar who wanted people of all castes to become temple priests. As a move seen as controversial by many, this policy however garnered him acclaim for it being the right step at a social revolution and combating discrimination at all levels.

== Public image and reception ==
Stalin&#x27;s career in the political arena has seen its ups and downs. From a challenger to an emerging pragmatic leader, the people of Tamil Nadu have credited his administrative skills and firm rejection of sycophancy. An example of this was when M.K Stalin asked the Education Minister, Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhil not to print his photographs on 65 lakh bags meant for distribution among schoolchildren in the state, opting to retain pictures of his political adversaries from the previous government that had sanctioned the project.

Stalin was commended by domain experts and other ministers across the country for not using public money to enhance his popularity among the “masses”.

On 2 September 2021 the actor turned former Union Minister Chiranjeevi met with Stalin to commend him on governance efficacy and said he proved his mettle in handling the grave situation of COVID-19 pandemic. The media houses in Kerala lauded Stalin on his policies and efforts in controlling the spread of COVID-19 during the second wave, provision of free bus pass for women and ₹4,000 as a pandemic relief for ration card holders.

The Shiv Sena Parliamentarian Sanjay Raut, in his weekly column Rokthok in party mouthpiece Saamana praised Stalin&#x27;s governance style and criticised the centre&#x27;s move to omit Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad’s picture from ICHR’s Independence day poster ‘Azadi Ke Amrit Mahotsav.’ Raut said the central government is practising the politics of revenge and should learn a lesson from Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Stalin, who allowed the distribution of 6.5 million school bags carrying photos of political rivals former chief ministers J Jayalalitha and E Palaniswami of the AIADMK, to ensure public money is not being spent on political vendetta.

Karnataka Chief Minister, Basavaraj Bommai commended Stalin&#x27;s nuanced policies and continual effort in controlling the spread of COVID-19 at the peak of the second wave.

== Awards and accolades ==
#Anna University conferred an honorary doctorate for Stalin for his contributions to governance and community development.
# The Kentucky Colonel Award, the highest award given by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in the United States, was given to Stalin for his public service.
# Stalin was also honoured as Kentucky&#x27;s Goodwill Ambassador. It is imperative to note that the honour was formerly bestowed to notable personalities such as, Former US Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, Nobel laureate Winston Churchill and world-famous boxer Mohammed Ali.
# The Government of Tamil Nadu on 23 February 2011 received the Special Award for Best State among the Largest States in India and the Diamond State Award for Best State in 3 categories namely Civil Safety, Drinking Water and Sanitation and Women&#x27;s Development.
# Tamil Nadu won the most number of Nirmal Gram Awards for its exceptional role in maintaining sanitation in the villages in the state. This prestigious award was received during Stalin&#x27;s tenure as Minister of Rural and Local Administrator.

<doc id="1011077" wikidata="Q6625649" url="?curid=1011077" title="Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick">
<text>Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick was the first multi-page newspaper published in British colonial America. After its first issue, which carried an account that offended the colonial governor, the newspaper was promptly closed down by British colonial authorities, only days later. No other newspaper would appear in the colonies until fourteen years later.

==History==
&quot;Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick&quot; was the first multi-page newspaper published in the British colonies in America. Before then, single-page newspapers, called broadsides, were published in the English colonies and printed in Cambridge in 1689. The first edition of &quot;Publick Occurrences&quot; was published September 25, 1690, in Boston, then a city in the Dominion of New England, and was intended to be published monthly, &quot;or, if any Glut of Occurrences happen, oftener.&quot; It was printed by American Richard Pierce of Boston, and it was edited by Benjamin Harris, who was a refugee from England who had unsuccessfully tried to establish a free press there. The newspaper consisted of four pages , with two columns, with the last page left blank, allowing one to conveniently write a letter about its news that could be sent to another family member or friend. Without Parliamentary support or any prospective advertising, Harris quickly published what would prove to be the first and last issue of his newspaper. The only known copy in existence is housed in the London Public Record office, where it was discovered in 1845 by the Reverend Joseph B. Felt . Felt claimed that a man with the name George MacMasters published the article, though these claims have no basis.

The first and only issue, published on Thursday, , had an account of a battle waged by General Fitz-John Winthrop during the French and Indian Wars covering the brutal treatment of French prisoners of war. No second edition was ever printed because the account angered the colonial government, which ordered the immediate suspension of the paper, only four days later on September 29, 1690, and which referred to the paper as a &quot;pamphlet&quot;. All remaining issues of the newspaper were destroyed. The order stated:

The three-page newspaper did not contain any criticism on the new licensing law for printing newspapers, or make any issues about colonial government. Instead it appealed to and informed its readers about the various current issues, i.e. the smallpox outbreak, the successful harvest produced by the &quot;Christianized&quot; Indians, a murder, the execution of Native American prisoners of war. It also contained a story about the king of France, Louis XIV, who supposedly was sleeping with his son&#x27;s wife—though since the wife was dead at that point it may have been published as a bit of fake news meant by the staunchly Protestant Harris to undermine the Catholic king. These issues were considered sensitive and questionable by colonial authorities, which led them to close down Harris&#x27; newspaper.

After the prompt suppression of &quot;Publick Occurrences&quot; and the subsequent passage of the newspaper and printing licensing law, future prospective publishers were discouraged from establishing new newspapers until 1704, when John Campbell established &quot;The Boston News-Letter&quot;. Campbell diligently made efforts to begin publication of his newspaper under authority, and with the proper license. Remembering the fate of the first newsletter, Campbell was careful not to print anything that could be construed as libelous or that otherwise would offend the Governor and the council; he generally limited himself to the reprinting of material taken from the &quot;London Flying Post&quot; and &quot;The London Gazette&quot;.

<text>Edmond Nicolas Laguerre (9 April 1834, Bar-le-Duc – 14 August 1886, Bar-le-Duc) was a French mathematician and a member of the Académie des sciences (1885). His main works were in the areas of geometry and complex analysis. He also investigated orthogonal polynomials (see Laguerre polynomials). Laguerre&#x27;s method is a root-finding algorithm tailored to polynomials. He laid the foundations of a geometry of oriented spheres (Laguerre geometry and Laguerre plane), including the Laguerre transformation or transformation by reciprocal directions.

<text>Saint-Sever-Calvados () is a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. On 1 January 2017, it was merged into the new commune Noues de Sienne.

==Geography==
The former French commune covered 2,792 hectares, with a high proportion of it being the Saint-Sever forest. The Saint-Sever forest is the source of two rivers, the river Vire and the river Siena. Lorencières, at the south of the area is highest point at about 350 metres, and the lowest, in the north east area at about 144 metres. The south of the area is on the granite massif of Vire-Carolles, and the north on the schistous basement of the basin. The average rainfall is 1,150 mm.

The places within the area are la Bersairie, les Déserts, la Braiserie, Saint-Blaise, la Caverie, les Broderies, la Lande, le Bourg &quot;(au nord)&quot;, la Guertière, la Guibellière, la Bunoudière, la Basse Fosse, la Haute Fosse, le Mouton, les Houlettes, le Beauregard, la Maquellerie, le Souchet, la Jourdanière, les Closets, le Vieux Château, le Clos, la Clairière, la Davière, la Faverie, la Jardière, la Rigoussière, la Quetterie, la Nellerie, la Vermondière, la Clergerie &quot;(à l&#x27;est)&quot;, la Tournerie, le Mesnil, la Mennetière, la Jancellière, la Capucière, les Lorencières, la Noue de Sienne, l&#x27;Ermitage &quot;(au sud)&quot;, le Valet, Brundou, la Jouardière, la Reinière, la Guermonderie, la Pédevinière, les Rivages, Cotigny, Plate Bourse, le Clos du Pôt, la Fieffe, la Porte de Cotigny, la Gablerie, le Bois de Cotigny, le Courbillon &quot;(à l&#x27;ouest)&quot; and le Richelieu

The town of Saint-Sever-Calvados is 13 km west of Vire and 14 km east of Villedieu-les-Poêles and is on a major road between those locations.

<doc id="1011106" wikidata="Q1156329" url="?curid=1011106" title="Auto show">
<text>An auto show, also known as a motor show or car show, is a public exhibition of current automobile models, debuts, concept cars, or out-of-production classics. It is attended by automotive industry representatives, dealers, auto journalists and car enthusiasts. Most auto shows occur once or twice a year. They are important to car manufacturers and local dealers as a public relations exercise, as they advertise new products and promote auto brands. The five most prestigious auto shows, sometimes called the &quot;Big Five&quot;, are generally considered to be held in Detroit, Frankfurt, Geneva, Paris and Tokyo. Car enthusiast communities along the historic U.S. Route 66 are credited with general popularization of car meets, including ethnic groups such as the Hispanos of New Mexico, Chicanos, and Mexican-Americans of the Southwestern United States; lowrider, high technology, electric vehicle, and other enthusiast show, are popular in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, San Francisco, and Chicago for this reason.

Some auto shows have more than just cars including: all sorts of other vehicles. The types of vehicles can include buses, trucks and almost any other types of vehicles such as Auto Expo in Delhi brings a variety of vehicles ranging from private to commercial.

==Manufacturer and Dealer shows==

The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers organizes many auto shows, including the Big Five. These shows all have an advertising purpose. They are held as part of the sales strategy of the manufacturers.

==Enthusiast shows==

There are other car shows that are organized by car enthusiast associations, automobile dealers, retail businesses, charitable organizations, or municipalities. There is no generally accepted term for these more common events.

Manufacturer car shows typically showcase vehicles currently being manufactured and available for purchase. Enthusiast car shows showcase individually owned vehicles, that are not currently being manufactured, and that are not available for purchase.

Enthusiast car shows have rules of entry, limiting the types of vehicles that may be shown, e.g. classic cars, hot rods, single-models (Corvette, Packard, Mustang, etc.), type of vehicle (station wagons, pickup trucks, orphan brands, etc…) 

Enthusiast car shows usually draw their entries locally. There are many car shows in various localities across many nations. Some may even be free to go to.

<text>Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash () (born 29 October 1953) is an Iraqi scientist and academic. Ammash was often referred to as &quot;Mrs. Anthrax&quot; due to her alleged association with an Iraqi biological weapons program.

Ammash was number 53 on the Pentagon&#x27;s list of the 55 most wanted, the &quot;five of hearts&quot; , in the U.S. deck of most-wanted Iraqi playing cards, and the only woman to be featured. She surrendered to coalition forces in May 2003 but was released in December 2005 without being charged.

==Life==
She received her undergraduate degree from the University of Baghdad, followed by a master&#x27;s in microbiology from Texas Woman&#x27;s University in Denton, Texas. She spent four years at the University of Missouri pursuing a doctorate in microbiology, which she received in December 1983. Her thesis focused on the effects of radiation, paraquat and the chemotherapy drug Adriamycin, on bacteria and mammals.

She was appointed to the Revolutionary Command Council in May 2001. In one of several videos that Saddam released during the war, Ammash was the only woman among about a half-dozen men seated around a table. The videos were broadcast on Iraqi TV as invading forces drew closer to Baghdad: it is not known when the meeting took place or what the significance was of her appearance on camera. She served as president of Iraq&#x27;s microbiology society and as dean at the University of Baghdad. U.S. officials said she was trained by Nassir al-Hindawi, described by United Nations inspectors as the &quot;father of Iraq&#x27;s biological weapons program&quot;. She conducted research into illnesses that may have been caused by depleted uranium from shells used in the 1991 Gulf War, and had published several papers on the health effects of the war and the subsequent sanctions. 

===Capture===
Ammash surrendered to coalition forces on 9 May 2003 and was one of two Iraqi women known to be in U.S. custody as of April 2005. The other was the British-educated Rihab Taha, who led Iraq&#x27;s biological weapons program until 1995.

In August 2005, the American Association for the Advancement of Science called for Ammash to be either sent to trial or released:
According to &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;, &quot;The organisation [AAAS] has not issued the statement lightly. Senior figures including Alan Leshner, chief executive officer of the AAAS, were involved in drawing it up.&quot;

Both women were released in December 2005 after they were among those an American-Iraqi board process found were no longer a security threat and would have no charges filed against them. Ammash was also said to be suffering from breast cancer.

==Family==
Ammash&#x27;s father, Salih Mahdi Ammash, was a high-level Baath Party member in Iraq, who became defense minister in 1963, deputy prime minister in 1968, and an ambassador in 1977.

<doc id="1011116" wikidata="Q1573258" url="?curid=1011116" title="Jára Cimrman">
<text>Jára Cimrman or Jára da Cimrman (officially Jaroslav Cimrman) (), also known as &quot;the Master&quot;, is a fictional Czech polymath, created by Ladislav Smoljak, and Zdeněk Svěrák. The fictional personality is presented as a universal genius, and one of the greatest Czech playwrights, poets, composers, teachers, travellers, philosophers, inventors, detectives, mathematicians, and sportsmen of the 19th and early 20th century. Playing along with the pretence of his real existence is part of his characterization.

Cimrman made his first appearance on a regular radio programme &quot;Nealkoholická vinárna U Pavouka&quot; (&quot;The Non-Alcoholic Wine Bar chez Spider&quot;) on 23 December 1966. Although the character was originally meant to be a modest caricature of the Czech people, history, and culture, he became an immensely popular protagonist of modern Czech folklore, and an ersatz national hero. In 2005, Jára Cimrman won a public vote for the title of &quot;The Greatest Czech&quot; (he was subsequently disqualified due to being a fictional character).

Cimrman is both the major character and the putative author of a great number of books, plays, and films. in Žižkov is one of Prague&#x27;s most frequented theatre houses.

==History==
The character was invented in 1966 for a regular radio programme &quot;Nealkoholická vinárna U Pavouka&quot; (&quot;The Non-Alcoholic Wine Bar chez Spider&quot;), set in U Pavouka, a fictional wine bar in Prague that was presented to listeners as real, but perennially sold out well in advance of recordings. One show featured a guest interview with a musicologist who claimed to have discovered, during a renovation of his cottage, a tranche of documents relating to a forgotten Czech polymath who lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, named Jara Cimrman, the first mention of the character. On subsequent shows the joke was extended as more and more documents, detailing other aspects of Cimrman&#x27;s life and his theatrical work, were found in an increasing variety of places. Cimrman&#x27;s character and stories were located in the Austria-Hungary era as a pastiche of Czech nationalism, but also to allow the writers to criticise the contemporary communist regime without detection. As the authors later recalled, the mystification of presenting the new discovery of a forgotten Czech genius was successful. Some listeners recognised it as humorous, some called for punishment for those who tried to deceive people, and others (at least in the beginning) believed the stories.

In 1967 Jiří Šebánek, together with Miloň Čepelka, Ladislav Smoljak and Zdeněk Svěrák, founded the . The first play, written by Svěrák and attributed to Cimrman/Svěrák, was called &quot;Akt&quot; (&quot;The Nude&quot;), and premiered in October 1967. Jiří Šebánek later left the theatre and in 1980 founded Salon Cimrman. People from the Jára Cimrman Theatre and Salon Cimrman call themselves &quot;cimrmanologists&quot;, and pretend to be enthusiastic scholars who explore and analyse Cimrman&#x27;s life and work. The plays all follow a similar format; the first half is a seminar in the style of a communist-era public meeting, with the actors taking turns to come onstage and present their &quot;findings&quot;, then a comic dramatisation of the topics discussed in the seminar follows in the second half. Salon Cimrman focuses just on lectures supplemented by brief sketches or songs. In total 16 Cimrman plays have been produced.

In 1983 Ladislav Smoljak directed the film &quot;Jára Cimrman Lying, Sleeping&quot; (), a biopic of Cimrman with Zdeněk Svěrák in the title role, and in 1984 Smoljak and Svěrák made a detective film comedy &quot;Dissolved and Effused&quot; (), based on the theatre play &quot;Vražda v salónním coupé&quot; (&quot;Murder in a Chair Carriage&quot;), the putative author of which was Jára Cimrman. Additionally, in 1987 the authors made a film &quot;An Uncertain Season&quot; (), a mostly autobiographical bittersweet comedy about the theatre&#x27;s difficulties during the Communist normalization era. In this film Cimrman&#x27;s name is never mentioned and the putative author of the plays is referred to throughout as &quot;the Master&quot;.

Cimrmanologists have also written several books on Jára Cimrman:
* J. Šebánek, L. Smoljak, Z. Svěrák, K. Velebný: &quot;Jára da Cimrman&quot; (1970)
* J. Klusák, J. Šebánek, L. Smoljak, Z. Svěrák, K. Velebný: &quot;Cimrman v říši hudby&quot; (&quot;Cimrman in the World of Music&quot;, 1971)
* J. Šebánek: &quot;Já, Jára Cimrman&quot; (&quot;I, Jára Cimrman&quot;, 1991)

A museum about Jára Cimrman&#x27;s inventions was opened in the basement of the Petřín Lookout Tower in Prague in 2002.

==Greatest Czech contest==
In early 2005, the Czech Television (ČT) started a contest to choose The Greatest Czech (inspired by the British show 100 Greatest Britons). By 15 January it seemed that most of the votes (by SMS, the Internet or mail) had gone to Jára Cimrman. However, ČT decided to disqualify Cimrman, saying that only real people were eligible for the contest, a decision that was strongly criticized by the public. An online petition was launched to keep Cimrman eligible. The popular support for Cimrman caused ČT to create a special category for fictional characters to recognize Cimrman&#x27;s popularity, and Czech Television also made a documentary about him; however, they did not reinstate him to the main contest.

== Jára Cimrman as a character ==

===Early life===
The son of Leopold Cimrman, a Czech tailor working in Vienna, and Marlén Cimrmanová, born Jelinková, an Austrian actress, Cimrman was said to have been born in either 1853 or 1859 (though sometimes other years have been cited as required). Of possible Jewish heritage, Cimrman&#x27;s name was originally spelt &quot;Zimrman&quot;, like the German surname &quot;Zimmermann&quot;, and he changed it later on as a mark of his Czech patriotism. Cimrman attended Czech and German schools in Vienna, and continued his studies in Prague. Due to the family&#x27;s poverty, Cimrman&#x27;s parents dressed him in second-hand clothes from his sister Luisa, and sent him to a girls&#x27; school, hiding his identity from him. When he discovered the truth aged 15, it triggered an identity crisis but is also said to have been the moment when his genius emerged. No pictures of Cimrman are said to have been found and so his appearance is unknown.

===Contributions===
As mentioned in his plays, some of Jára Cimrman&#x27;s achievements and contributions include:

* He proposed the Panama Canal to the U.S. government, while composing a libretto for an opera of the same name. 
* He reformed the school system in Galicia. 
* With Count Zeppelin he constructed the first rigid airship using Swedish steel and Czech wicker (the wicker being for the cabin). 
* He was deported from Germany as an anarchist, his personal documents carrying a note that he was &quot;a source of unrest.&quot; This led the Swiss company Omega to offer him a job to improve the unrest—balance wheel—for their Piccolo line of ladies watches. (N.B. the Czech and German words for a watch&#x27;s balance wheel (&quot;nepokoj&quot;, &quot;Unruhe&quot;) mean &quot;unrest.&quot;) While in Switzerland, he introduced (and practised for some time) the field of obstetrics. 
* He conducted investigations into the life of cannibalistic tribes in the Arctic; and once, while running away from one furious tribe, he missed the North Pole by just seven meters, thus almost becoming the first human reaching the North Pole.
* In Paraguay, he created the first puppet-show.
* In Vienna he established the school of criminology, music and ballet. 
* He corresponded with George Bernard Shaw for many years, without response. 
* He invented yogurt. 
* He helped many great scientists: He carried on his own back the 45 tubs of pitchblende to the basement of Pierre and Marie Curie, he assisted Prof. Burian with his first plastic surgery, he reworked the electrical contact on Thomas Edison&#x27;s first light bulb, and he found a sublet for Gustave Eiffel. 
* He is the creator of the philosophy of Externism. 
* Because of his enthusiasm for natural sciences, he discovered the monopole (as opposed to the then well known dipole), but this discovery fell into obscurity until it was revived by 20th century economists. The joke hinges on the similarity between the Czech words &quot;monopol&quot; (monopoly) - and &quot;monopól&quot; (monopole).
* He advised Mendeleev, after seeing the first draft, that the Periodic Table should be rotated to its current orientation. 
* It is said that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he found 3 missed calls from Jára Cimrman upon making his first connection.

Another one of his great inventions was also the internet itself, although without the widespread use of computers. Due to the technologies available at the time he had to rely on telephones. His internet basically consisted of an old circus tent where the maestro arranged the telephone apparatus for various pensioned high school teachers to answer all kinds of questions people asked. The well known WWW prefix also originated here. One of the teachers&#x27; name was Weber and since he stuttered, he introduced himself as &quot;W-W-W.Weber.&quot; His achievements in this field went even further, thanks to Mr. Šustr, who was responsible for answering biologically themed questions. Šustr answered each one by operating with field mice (African elephant&#x27;s weight was equivalent to 30,000 mice, a weasel was 1.5 times faster than a mouse, etc.). This marks the first recorded use of mouse as a peripheral in computer technology.

==== Pedagogue ====
Most of the pedagogical work of Jára Cimrman is presented in the play &quot;Vyšetřování ztráty třídní knihy&quot; (&quot;Investigation of the Loss of a Class Book&quot;, 1967).

Cimrman became a teacher in the small Galician village of Struk (&quot;teat&quot;), as a punishment by court, when it was revealed he could both read &quot;and&quot; write.

A practitioner of his &quot;Futurism&quot; ideology, he also prepared his students for the future practical use of phones, which were being slowly installed throughout the empire at that time. He created in them such a euphoria, that when the first phones arrived, many of his current and former students began throwing whole fortunes into the phones, calling random numbers; many of them went home from the telephone booths completely penniless and became beggars.

He also revolutionized his small town schooling methods. Knowing that the cohort is bound to forget at least a part of the lecture, his system was based on dividing the lectured subjects into clearly marked &quot;Forget-me-not&quot; and &quot;Not-forget-me-not&quot; sections. The former was one-tenth of all the learning volume and was meant to be remembered, while the latter made up the nine-tenths of the given subject and was intended from the start to be forgotten.

As a teacher, he was putting his pupils under controlled exposure to stress in order to improve information retention of the germane parts of the curriculum —he either snapped his whip hard against the floor or removed his wig (&quot;úlek oslněním&quot; – &quot;fright by daze&quot;). This apparently successful method bears his name to this day as the famous &quot;Cimrman&#x27;s Fixation by Shock&quot;.

When students misbehaved, he did not punish them but punished himself instead—his theory was that pupils certainly must love their teacher and therefore would feel remorse if he should suffer. When his students put water into his ink-bottle instead of ink, he would not leave his house for a week. His students having had no school then had enough free time to feel sorry for him. Alternately he would refuse to have his cigarette after lunch and stating: &quot;Today, after lunch, I will not smoke my cigar (&quot;viržínko&quot;). Don&#x27;t cry, it&#x27;s your fault.&quot;

==== Playwright ====
Jára Cimrman is claimed to have authored numerous plays, many of which are said to have been lost. These plays include &quot;Posel světla&quot; (English &quot;Herald of Light&quot;), featuring his own comic vision of the future world where people are all good to each other and so a person may act as a complete heartless monster without any remorse.

Another play presented as a work of Cimrman is &quot;Záskok&quot; (&quot;The Stand-in&quot;), which portrays actors of a fictional amateur theatre, performing a play that is messed up by a famous and reportedly brilliant, yet in reality dumb person who cannot forget to say other people&#x27;s lines and lines from other plays and who cannot even remember the name of his own character.

Cimrman never received great fame as a playwright in his lifetime, often because of his innovatory practices, such as changing the length of the play in several successive performances or presenting new ideas. He is stated to have sent many of his plays to Ladislav Stroupežnický (a famous Czech playwright) under his name and two pseudonyms, forming such a bundle of rejected works that Stroupežnický recalls they &quot;cost him 60 working days&quot;. He also encouraged Cimrman not to write to him and if possible &quot;not to write at all&quot;. After Cimrman replied on a familiar note, because they both studied at the same school, Stroupežnický never recovered.

One of the plays, also said to be lost, which was a subject of their correspondence, was &quot;Čechové na Řípu&quot; (English: &quot;Czechs on Říp&quot;), a fictional account of an old Bohemian legend, which is here said to feature not only the legendary Forefather Czech, but also other characters as Forefather German, Forefather Jew and, in dialogue only, Forefather Gipsy, by which Cimrman wanted to honour all major nationalities living in Bohemia. The play was later re-done and its name changed to &quot;Čechové na řípu&quot; (&quot;Czechs for Beet&quot;, changing just uppercase &quot;Ř&quot; into lower case &quot;ř&quot;), in order to motivate people to work at a sugar refinery in Klánovice.

Another man, whom Cimrman is said to have surprised with his works was Jacob Durman, director of the Royal Chamber Theatre in Haag, who, after reading his play &quot;Prázdniny s kanibalem Dufkem&quot; (&quot;Vacation with cannibal Dufek&quot;) is said not to &quot;come out of astonishment.&quot; Cimrman replied: &quot;Dear Mr. Durman, the theatre is here mainly so that the spectator shall be astonished. I am sending you five more plays.&quot;

Many of Cimrman&#x27;s unsuccessful plays are reported to be performed by his infamous theatrical group Lipany. Cimrman&#x27;s theatre still possesses the original properties from the play &quot;Akt&quot; (English: &quot;The Nude&quot;), through which the author himself left the stage.
Cimrmanologists admit that Cimrman has failed to obtain any recognition in this field (as well as in any other) because his methods were far too ahead of his time. This is also in strong contrast with the fact how brilliantly he helped Anton Chekhov with his play (advising him that two sisters are not enough).

====Cimrman&#x27;s special acting methods====

=====&quot;Vichr z hor&quot;=====
&quot;Vichr z hor&quot; (&quot;The Gale from the Mountains&quot;) was a sketch used on stage when the audience displayed a certain degree of unrest with the performance. It was a way of leaving the stage quickly and inconspicuously, with minimal to no damage to actors or scene. When the actors, or Cimrman himself sensed the danger, two members of the ensemble started making seemingly irrelevant comments that there&#x27;s a wind picking up on stage. Calling it &quot;Gale from the mountains&quot;, they kept making remarks on the fierce strength of the wind, which was by that point ripping and carrying objects away (the remaining personnel carried the scene pieces on a carriage standing by). When all that remained on scene were the two actors, the lights went off. This was a signal for the duo to announce, that a storm has arrived and whoever in the audience moves will be struck down by lightning. This impression was further supported by the noise of the carriage leaving the theatre area, further simulating thunder. After making sure no-one will move, the duo ran off the stage, leaped onto their prepared bicycles and began chasing the carriage.

=====Hamlet without Hamlet=====
Cimrman often had to cope with insufficient ensemble or with sudden getaways of his actors. Therefore, he sometimes had to make substantial adjustments to the plays he wanted to perform, for example he reduced the number of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; to just one, or he presented &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot; as &quot;Ali Baba the Loner&quot;. As his masterpiece in this field is considered his &quot;Hamlet without Hamlet&quot;, where some other characters onstage (King Claudius, Queen Gertrude) constantly complain that &quot;Hamlet hid himself once again&quot; and they merely use Hamlet&#x27;s quotations as they presume what would he say if he had been there. However, this version of Hamlet usually did not meet with favour from the audience, and the ensemble had to employ the abovementioned &quot;Vichr z hor&quot; to safely leave the scene.

=====Cimrman&#x27;s Ten Commandments for Novice Actors=====
Cimrman&#x27;s theatrical company (called Lipany) had a significant share of untalented and inexperienced actors. In the lecture preceding the play &quot;The Stand-In&quot; (), a list of Cimrman&#x27;s &quot;Ten Commandments for Novice Actors&quot; is presented, after which the commandments are broken one by one throughout the rest of the play.

* 1. Do not drink for courage. Even the part of a drunkard is better played sober.
* 2. Remember that on the stage you generally have a different name than in real life. It is good to know the names of the other characters also.
* 3. It is best to express strong emotions with your back to the audience. You can best portray both laughter and tears by shrugging your shoulders.
* 4. Do not thank the audience for objects thrown on the stage.
* 5. After a cue do not repeat everything. Some lines are for other actors.
* 6. Go to the bathroom before the performance so that you do not slouch during the play.
* 7. If you play a devil, remember before sitting down that you have a tail.
* 8. During applause on an open stage do not bow. It is most likely for someone else.
* 9. Remember that some doors are just painted.
* 10. Do not eat during meals on the stage. Everything is rubber.

In another version, the 7th command is omitted and another command is listed as the last one:

* 10. During the final applause make bows deep enough for the audience not to notice it is you who shouts &quot;Bravo!&quot;

<doc id="1011117" wikidata="Q1347106" url="?curid=1011117" title="Larry Linville">
<text>Lawrence Lavon Linville (September 29, 1939 – April 10, 2000) was an American actor known for his portrayal of the surgeon Major Frank Burns on the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Linville was born in Ojai, California, the son of Fay Pauline (née Kennedy) and Harry Lavon Linville. Raised in Sacramento, he attended El Camino High School (class of 1957) and later studied aeronautical engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder before applying for a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London.

==Career==
After returning to the United States, Linville began his acting career at the Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, a year-round repertory theater under director Robert Porterfield.

===Early career===
Before his five-year co-starring role on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Linville had guest-starring roles on many of the well-known television series of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Included in his credits in that period are one appearance each on &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Room 222&quot; and &quot;Adam-12&quot;. He had three appearances, as three different characters, on &quot;&quot; over three seasons of that television series. On the early seasons of &quot;Mannix&quot;, Linville had a recurring role as Lieutenant George Kramer, an ally of Mannix in the L.A. Police Department.

Linville played the coroner on the television movie &quot;The Night Stalker&quot; (1972), a predecessor of the &quot;Kolchak&quot; television series, and in the episode titled &quot;Chopper&quot; of &quot;&quot;, he played the youngest police captain on the force investigating murders committed by a headless motorbike rider. He also had a small role in the film &quot;Kotch&quot; (1971). Linville also appeared as U.S. Treasury Agent Hugh Emery in the 1972 television series &quot;Search&quot; episode &quot;One of Our Probes is Missing&quot;.

===&quot;M*A*S*H&quot;===

When the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; was picked up for production in early 1972, Linville signed a five-year contract for the role of Major Frank Burns, an ill-tempered, inept surgeon who embraced military discipline with a cartoonish overzealousness. This contrasted with the more competent yet rebellious doctors played by Alan Alda and Wayne Rogers (and later, Mike Farrell). During the second season, the sitcom&#x27;s tone started to change from pure comedy to more drama-focused story lines, as it reflected issues related to the Vietnam War (though &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; was set during the Korean War, it aired during the Vietnam and post-Vietnam era and tended to reflect this period in a roundabout fashion). At the start of the series fifth season in late 1976, Linville was offered a renewal for two more seasons, but declined. As the tone of the series had evolved to more serious storylines, Linville felt that he had taken the Frank Burns character, which had become increasingly one-dimensional, as far as he could, and chose to leave the series to pursue other roles.

===Later career===
After &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Linville starred or appeared in many films and television series. He was a guest-star on many television series, most frequently &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;The FBI Story&quot;, and &quot;CHiPs&quot;. He also appeared on episodes of &quot;Airwolf&quot; (he played Maxwell in &quot;And a Child Shall Lead&quot;) and &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, and appeared in the television movie &quot;The Girl, the Gold Watch &amp; Dynamite&quot; (1981). He also played a stock character—the &quot;Crazy General&quot;—along with Edward Winter in the pilot episode of &quot;Misfits of Science&quot;. He also co-starred in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Grandpa Goes to Washington&quot; with Jack Albertson.

Linville appeared as jealous ex-boyfriend Randy Bigelow in the short-lived 1982 Disney series &quot;Herbie, the Love Bug&quot;. He also starred in the short-lived &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; spinoff &quot;Checking In&quot;, where he played Florence Johnston&#x27;s (Marla Gibbs) nemesis, Lyle Block; however, this series only lasted four episodes. In 1984, Linville co-starred on &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;, a nighttime drama on ABC offering a glimpse behind-the-scenes of the fashion industry. In 1991, Linville appeared on an episode of the television series &quot;Night Court&quot; as a doctor. Linville also appeared in an episode of &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; season 1 episode 3 as a crackpot claiming to have been abducted by Superman and taken aboard his spaceship.

His film appearances included &quot;School Spirit&quot; (1985), &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot; (1988), &quot;C.H.U.D. II: Bud the C.H.U.D.&quot; (1989), &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School Forever&quot; (1991), &quot;A Million to Juan&quot; (1994), &quot;No Dessert, Dad, till You Mow the Lawn&quot; (1994), and &quot;Fatal Pursuit&quot; (1995).

Linville appeared as an interview subject for &quot;Memories of M*A*S*H&quot;, a 1991 special commemorating the 20th anniversary of the series. In 1997, he joined Larry Gelbart (the producer and creator of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;) and David Ogden Stiers (who played Frank Burns&#x27; replacement on the sitcom, Major Charles Winchester) to attend a deactivation ceremony for the last remaining U.S. MASH unit in Korea.

==Marriages and family==
He was married five times, including once to Kate Geer (daughter of actor Will Geer and sister of actress Ellen Geer), with whom he had a daughter, Kelly Linville (born 1970), before they divorced. Kelly was his only child. He also married (and divorced) Vana Tribbey, Melissa Gallant, and Susan Hagan. His last marriage was to Deborah Guydon, who was by his side when he died.

==Surgery, illness, and death==
After doctors found a malignant tumor under his sternum, Linville underwent surgery in February 1998 to remove part of his lung. He received further treatment, but had continuing health problems over the next two years. Linville died of pneumonia at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City on April 10, 2000, after complications from cancer surgery. His ashes were scattered at sea off the coast of Bodega Bay, California.

<text>The Eagle Times is a daily newspaper based in Claremont, New Hampshire. The paper circulates in Claremont, Charlestown, Cornish, Newport, Plainfield and Unity, New Hampshire, and Ascutney, Springfield, Weathersfield and Windsor, Vermont.

== History ==
The &quot;Eagle Times&quot; was formed when the Claremont &quot;Daily Eagle&quot; merged with the Bellows Falls-Springfield &quot;Times Reporter&quot; in the 1970s. The &quot;Eagle Times&quot; website went online September 1, 2005. The paper was independently owned by publisher Harvey Hill at this time.

Eagle Publications also owned several weekly and specialty publications, including the &quot;Connecticut Valley Spectator&quot; of Lebanon, New Hampshire, the &quot;Message for the Week&quot; of Chester, Vermont, the &quot;Weekly Flea&quot;, and the &quot;Argus Champion&quot;. The &quot;Argus Champion&quot;, which was based in New London, New Hampshire, was discontinued on July 30, 2008, a year prior to the other publications.

The combined papers had 197,445 readers, according to the company&#x27;s last published rate card before the closure.

On July 9, 2009, the parent company of &quot;Eagle Times&quot;, Eagle Publications, Inc., filed for Chapter 7 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and printed its final edition on July 10, 2009. All of its employees were laid off and all of their remaining newspapers, the &quot;Connecticut Valley Spectator&quot;, the &quot;Weekly Flea&quot;, and the &quot;Message for the Week&quot;, were also discontinued at that time. The website was still accessible until the afternoon of July 14, 2009.

The publisher cited monthly losses, and the shift of readers and advertisers to the internet as reasons for the bankruptcy. It is also believed that the increasing cost of newsprint was partially to blame.

After emerging from bankruptcy in October 2009, the newspaper opened for business again, printing its first new issue Monday, October 12.

On February 23, 2012, the paper restarted its web site, at www.eagletimes.com.

In July 2020, Sunshine Communications, a division of the Sunshine Initiative Public Benefit Corp., acquired the newspaper from Sample News Group.

== Controversy ==

In November 2009, the state of New Hampshire guaranteed 75 percent of a $250,000 loan to the &quot;Eagle Times&quot;, leading to questions about conflicts of interest and journalistic integrity. The paper&#x27;s publisher, Harry Hartman, denied any conflict of interest, saying that &quot;No one gets deferential treatment in our newsroom.&quot;

<doc id="1011144" wikidata="Q1621735" url="?curid=1011144" title="The Farmer's Wife">
<text>The Farmer&#x27;s Wife is a 1928 British silent romantic comedy film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Jameson Thomas, Lillian Hall-Davis and Gordon Harker.

It is adapted from a 1916 play of the same name by British novelist, poet and playwright Eden Phillpotts, best known for a series of novels based on Dartmoor, in Devon. &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Wife&quot; is produced by British International Pictures at Elstree studios. The film&#x27;s sets were designed by the art director Wilfred Arnold. The film was remade as a 1941 film &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Wife&quot; directed by Leslie Arliss.

==Plot==

Tibby, the wife of Samuel Sweetland (Jameson Thomas) dies, and shortly afterwards his daughter marries and leaves home, leaving him on his own with his two servants. His wife had told him that he should remarry after her death, so he pursues some local spinsters who were at his daughter&#x27;s wedding after he and his housekeeper Minta (Lillian Hall-Davis) make out a list of possibilities.

First is Widow Louisa Windeatt, but Sweetland is shocked and angry when she rejects his advances and says she is too independent for him. Next, he attempts to court Thirza Tapper, a nervous wreck who almost collapses when Sweetland proposes to her. She, too, rejects him because she says she has no need for a man, and he is furious yet again. He wanders outside as other guests arrive for her party. His grumpy servant Ash is helping at the party, wearing an ill-fitting coat and trying to keep his trousers up while doing his work at the party.

While the others are outside listening to some singers, Sweetland proposes to Mary Hearn, but she rejects him as too old, and then becomes hysterical when he angrily tells her that she too is &quot;full blown and a bit over.&quot;

Later Sweetland tells Minta that he is not going to finish the list of women because he is so dejected. He leaves the room and Ash returns and tells Minta what an embarrassment to men that Sweetland is by going around and practically begging any woman to be his wife. Sweetland overhears this and orders Ash to saddle his horse because he is going to try number four on the list, Mercy Bassett, a barmaid at a local inn. After he leaves, it is revealed that Minta is in love with him. Bassett rejects him too and he comes home dejectedly. Meanwhile, postmistress Hearn and Tapper compare notes and Hearn decides she should marry him after all and she goes to his house with Tapper.

Having run through the women who have turned him down, Samuel sees Minta for the first time as more than a housekeeper and decides that she is the woman for him, if she&#x27;ll have him. He tells her he has got used to being rejected and will not be angry if she rejects him, too. She accepts him and he tells her to put on the dress Tibby gave her. As she goes to the room, Hearn and Tapper arrive. Hearn says she is now willing to be his wife. Samuel says all should drink a toast to his wife to be and Hearn is sure it is her, until Minta comes down the stairs in an attractive dress. Hearn lapses into hysterics again as Sweetland reveals that Minta will be his bride.

==Preservation status and home media==
A restoration of &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Wife&quot; was completed in 2012 as part of the BFI&#x27;s £2 million &quot;Save the Hitchcock 9&quot; project to restore all of the director&#x27;s surviving silent films.

&quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Wife&quot; has been heavily bootlegged on home video. Despite this, various licensed, restored releases have appeared on DVD, Blu-ray and video on demand from Optimum in the UK, Lionsgate and Kino Lorber in the US, and many others.

<doc id="1011150" wikidata="Q22338455" url="?curid=1011150" title="Lagoona">
<text>Lagoona was a dance and techno band, consisting of the two music producers Andreas Viklund (born 1980) and Björn Karlsson (born 1976). The band was based in a small town called Porjus in northern Sweden. Lagoona was one of the first groups to call themselves &quot;online artists&quot; (October 1996) and they released their first free MP3 single on the Internet in October 1997, long before the format became widely popular.

== The early years ==
Lagoona first started making music in the tracker scene under the name TSEC (The Solid Energy Crew), and the band released its first two modules in October 1996. Their first releases got very popular on the internet, and being one of few artists to release legal MP3 songs in 1997 created a lot of attention for the band. In early 1998, their first album was released. It was named &quot;Dreams&quot; after their first online hit from 1996, and it was completely home-brew and released by the band&#x27;s own label. The money from the album sales helped the band build a real studio, and in October 1998 when the band started using hardware synthesizers and MIDI equipment instead of tracker software, the band changed its name from TSEC to Lagoona.

Since then, Lagoona have peaked most major MP3 music charts on the net at some point. The band got two songs at the #1 spot of the MP3.com Music chart, &quot;The Journey&quot; in August 2000 and &quot;Emotions in Trance&quot; a couple of months later the same year. The band also had several other songs in high positions on the MP3.com Music chart, including &quot;The Promised Land&quot; at #2. In the MP3.com genre charts, all songs Lagoona released (over 40 tracks in total) reached a top-20 place at some point. Lagoona got more than 2.4 million song plays from MP3.com, and in total more than 8 million recorded downloads as of 2007 – a number which only a few bands in Sweden could match at the time. Lagoona also released their music on other sites, like Beatmaka.com, Weedshare.com and Javamusic.com, where they also reached the #1 spots, and they were ranked in the mp3charts.com &quot;Global Top 100&quot; for more than two years in a row.

== The later years ==

In 2001, Lagoona started working with vocals. The band recorded two songs with American-Dutch female singer Lizanne Hennessey (&quot;Always in my heart&quot; and &quot;Be my friend&quot;), and in 2003 the band co-operated with Swedish singer Åsa Holmberg who recorded one of Lagoonas most well-known songs, &quot;Into my dream&quot;. Åsa also performed live with the band on stage during 2003 and 2004. Lagoona did over 30 live performances all over northern Sweden, playing as opening acts for Swedish artists like Markoolio and Da Buzz. They were assisted on stage by DJ Magho (2000–2002) and DJ Isecore (2002–2004). The band have also had a number of record contracts, but never released any commercial album or single of their own. Their first commercial release was a remix on the Eskimo single &quot;Dreaming of me&quot; (In.Disc/NorskeGram). Lagoona has also produced music for British/Australian popstar Gina G and released single tracks on several international compilation albums, with the last major release being &quot;Cream of the clubs 2004&quot; (ZYX/DanceStreet) and &quot;A trip in Trance 3&quot; (Blue Dot). In 2006, two years after the band was put to rest, British label RFU Recordingz released a vinyl single with a Happy Hardcore remix of &quot;Into my dream&quot;.

Among their merits in the later years, their &quot;Final destination&quot; became the most downloaded song of 2003 at Beatmaka.com after staying several months on top of the charts. &quot;Final destination&quot; is also the only Lagoona song where both members are singing the vocals. At the same ranking for year 2004, Lagoona had three songs on the top-20 (&quot;Into my dream&quot; being the highest at #12). Lagoona also got #1 at the Weedshare top chart with &quot;Into my dream&quot;.

== Today ==

Lagoona broke up with in 2004, and neither of the two members are currently active artists. The official website of Lagoona used to be found at lagoonamusic.com, but the site has been closed. Most songs can be found on various file-sharing networks and on sites like YouTube and Last.fm. Nearly all the songs can also be downloaded for free (under a Creative Commons Attribution license) from Andreas Viklund&#x27;s artist page on soundcloud.com, and streamed on Grooveshark.com.

In 2018 the domain of the original website was relaunched to commemorate the 20th anniversary since the band was born. This relaunch included a blog entry about the history of the band, the publication of the first four albums in digital streaming stores and the public release of a remix pack of acapellas and samples of various songs, via torrent. The website went offline again two years later.

In June 2021, after being announced in 2020, Lagoona publishes its fourth and last album (fifth including &quot;Dreams&quot; by The Solid Energy Crew as the first) called &quot;Completion&quot;, which includes all those songs made by Lagoona from 2002 to 2004 that were not included in any album. This release did not mark the return of the band, but rather intended to bring all the songs together in a compilation so that they are easily found through digital platforms.

<doc id="1011152" wikidata="Q2837471" url="?curid=1011152" title="All Four Cups">
<text>Winning All Four Cups referred to winning all four competitions available to a British rugby league side in the top division between 1907 and 1970. The cups available to win were the First Division Championship, Challenge Cup, county league (Lancashire League or Yorkshire League) and county cup (Lancashire Cup or Yorkshire Cup). The feat was achieved on three occasions.

==All Four Cups winners==
Between 1907 and 1970 there were four trophies available to any British rugby league side:

* Challenge Cup
* RFL First Division
* County league (Lancashire League or Yorkshire League)
* County cup (Lancashire Cup or Yorkshire Cup)

Following the abolition of the county league in 1970, &quot;all four cups&quot; could no longer be won. The county cups were abolished in 1993.

===Hunslet===
The first club to win All Four Cups was Hunslet, which they did in the 1907–08 season. They were captained by Albert Goldthorpe, who operated in the back line. Hunslet&#x27;s forward pack of that season was equally famous, going by the name of &quot;&quot;The Terrible Six&quot;.

Hunslet did not top the championship table at the end of the season, coming behind Oldham, whom they defeated, 10–12, in a championship replay after the first match was drawn 7 apiece. They ran out 14–0 winners in the Challenge Cup Final in front of 18,000 spectators at Fartown, Huddersfield. They took the Yorkshire Cup by virtue of a 17–0 victory over Halifax.

===Huddersfield===

The feat was next repeated by Huddersfield in the 1914–15 season by the Fartowners famous &quot;Team of all Talents&quot;. This was the culmination of a staggering period of dominance in the game, as they had already picked up two championships, the challenge cup, three Yorkshire Cups and three Yorkshire league titles in the preceding five seasons.

They were captained by Harold Wagstaff, immortalised as the &quot;Prince of Centres&quot;&quot;, and included several foreign internationals. They easily defeated Leeds, 35–2, in the Championship final, and managed an even greater margin of victory in the Challenge Cup, crushing St. Helens, 37–3, at Oldham.

The season saw Huddersfield&#x27;s wing-three-quarter Albert Rosenfeld score an impressive 56 tries. However this figure paled into insignificance when it is remembered that Rosenfeld, a Jewish Australian who had come over to Britain with the 1908 Kangaroos, had scored 80 tries the previous season. This record has never yet been beaten.

The First World War intervened, and the team broke up. The Huddersfield club was unable to field a team, reforming only after the war ended.

===Swinton===
The final team to win All Four Cups was Swinton, who thus became the only side ever to achieve a Lancashire version of the feat. The 1927–28 Northern Rugby Football League season saw the Lions sweep aside all before them, under the captaincy of centre Hector Halsall. They topped both the League and the Lancashire League, having already defeated Wigan in the Lancashire Cup. In a tense Challenge Cup final they squeezed past Warrington 5-3, and three weeks later the Holy Grail was achieved when they comfortably eased past Featherstone Rovers 11-0 to take the Championship.

<doc id="1011156" wikidata="Q3812744" url="?curid=1011156" title="Kane (fantasy)">
<text>Kane is a fictional character created by American author Karl Edward Wagner in a series of three novels and about 20 short stories published between 1970 and 1985. Most Kane tales are sword and sorcery with strong elements of gothic horror and set in a grim, pre-medieval world which is nonetheless ancient and rich in history. In some of Wagner&#x27;s later stories, Kane appears in the present day—for example, as a drug dealer in &quot;Lacunae&quot; and as a somewhat suspect publishing magnate in &quot;At First Just Ghostly&quot;.

==Character background==
Little is known about Kane&#x27;s origins. In the story &quot;Misericorde&quot;, he declares to one of his foes that his father&#x27;s name was Adam, and his stepmother&#x27;s name was Eve, possibly making him the biological son of the Biblical Adam&#x27;s first wife Lilith. Like traditional depictions of Cain, he is a powerful, left-handed man with red hair, said to have killed (strangled) his brother Abel and been cursed by a mad god with an eternal life of wandering. Nevertheless, he is vulnerable to wounds, although they heal at a rapid pace, and it is said that he can be killed &quot;by the violence that he himself created&quot;. Kane is portrayed as both an excellent warrior and an accomplished sorcerer who spends millennia wandering from one adventure to the next. Also, like the Biblical Cain, Kane is marked as a killer (&quot;I kill things,&quot; he tells Elric in &quot;The Gothic Touch&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s what I was made to do. I&#x27;m rather good at it&quot;); those who meet the gaze of his icy blue eyes cannot maintain contact for long, for they give away Kane&#x27;s true nature as a butcher of men.

Kane is unconcerned with common morality, since no human relationship can ever last more than a small fraction of his lifetime (although the daughter he fathers in &quot;Raven&#x27;s Eyrie&quot; appears as an adult in the modern-day &quot;At First Just Ghostly&quot;), and he frequently ends up on the wrong side in the conflicts, often to his own detriment. A common theme is the hero&#x27;s weariness with his own immortality and his attempts to give meaning to his existence.

Kane is often compared to Conan the Barbarian, the warrior character created in the 1930s by American author Robert E. Howard. Kane and Conan are both wandering warriors in quasi-feudal worlds. But Kane is a more devious character with a more somber and reflective outlook on life than Conan. Kane also has none of Conan&#x27;s dislike of sorcery. His creator described Kane as &quot;not a sword and sorcery hero; he is a gothic hero-villain from the tradition of the Gothic novels of the 18th and early 19th centuries&quot; and as a character &quot;who could master any situation intellectually, or rip heads off if push came to shove&quot;.

Some commentators argue that the fantasy protagonist that Kane has most in common with is Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Elric of Melniboné, but Wagner was also inspired by novels such as &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot; (1820) and &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; (1922).

<text>Edward Harold Physick (20 July 1878 – 30 August 1972) was an English writer, known chiefly as a critic and authority on John Milton; also, a poet and fantasy writer. He was credited as E. H. Visiak by 1909.

==Life==

He was born in Ealing, London, the son of Edward Joseph Physick, who married in 1877 Maude Searcy, daughter of John Searcy. His grandfather Edward James Physick (1829–1906) was a sculptor, and secretary of the Congregationalist Paddington Chapel; the sculpture business was taken over on his death by Edward Joseph and another of the sons. William Henry Helm, writer and critic, who married in 1881 Ada Emmeline Physick, the youngest daughter, was his maternal uncle.

Physick went to Hitchin Grammar School (now Hitchin Boys School), and also had some private tutoring. He became a clerk with the Indo-European Telegraph Company, working in London&#x27;s Mincing Lane and also for a period in Manchester. 

During World War I the poetry he wrote, as Visiak, in opposition to it, cost him his job. When conscription was introduced, he became a conscientious objector. He spent some time as an agricultural labourer, and then taught in a preparatory school. He published a poem in 1917 in &quot;The Ploughshare&quot;, the journal of the Socialist Quaker Society, edited by William Loftus Hare, and Hubert W. Peet, another conscientious objector. 

Visiak&#x27;s father died in 1921, and he then lived with and cared for his mother. In 1923 he was running a boys&#x27; preparatory school, Ascham House, in Brondesbury, with A. J. Welch. They moved to Hove in World War II; she died in 1952 at age 98.

Around 1967, when Colin Wilson wrote to him about &quot;Voyage to Arcturus&quot;, Visiak was in a nursing home. The summer 1967 issue of the &quot;Aylesford Review&quot; was a &quot;Homage to E. H. Visiak&quot;. Contributors included the poet Kenneth Hopkins (1914–1988) and Wilson. At the end of his life, in 1971, Visiak published a poem in the &quot;ADAM International Review&quot; edited by Miron Grindea.

==Works==
Taking on the pseudonym Visiak, he contributed poetry to &quot;The New Age&quot;. He was among the broad-based group of writers in the &quot;New Age&quot; who followed Mary Gawthorpe&#x27;s lead and contributed to Dora Marsden&#x27;s &quot;Freewoman&quot; in 1911–2. His poetry appeared &quot;all over&quot; the magazine, according to Bruce Clarke, who considers it &quot;undistinguished&quot;. It was noted by Rebecca West, as from the only other literary contributor.

During the 1930s Visiak&#x27;s poetry was published in &quot;Edwardian Poetry&quot; and &quot;Neo-Georgian Poetry&quot; edited by John Gawsworth. He collaborated on short stories, with Gawsworth in particular. A friend of and enthusiast for the Scottish novelist David Lindsay, he provided an introductory note for Lindsay&#x27;s novel &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot;. He wrote three short macabre novels of his own, &quot;The Haunted Island&quot;, &quot;Medusa&quot; and &quot;The Shadow&quot;, and the autobiography &quot;Life&#x27;s Morning Hour&quot;. &quot;The Shadow&quot; was incorporated in Gawsworth&#x27;s anthology &quot;Crimes, Creeps and Thrills&quot; (1936), which also included Visiak&#x27;s story &quot;Medusan Madness&quot;.

They there fall into the hands of pirates, meet a ghost, and a wizard who rules over a colony of slaves. Ultimately they find a treasure.

===Autobiography===

==Critical reception==

His novel &quot;Medusa: A Story of Mystery&quot; (1929) became popular in the 1960s. Mike Ashley describes &quot;Medusa&quot; as Visiak&#x27;s &quot;premier achievement&quot;. &quot;Medusa&quot; was also included by horror historian Robert S. Hadji in his list of &quot;unjustly neglected&quot; horror novels. An essay on the novel by Karl Edward Wagner appears in the anthology &quot;Horror: 100 Best Books&quot; (1988; revised edition 1992). China Miéville has also expressed admiration for Visiak&#x27;s work.
