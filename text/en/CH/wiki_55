<text>The Oklahoma–Texas football rivalry is a college football rivalry game between border rivals Texas and Oklahoma. The two teams first played each other in 1900, and the rivalry has been renewed annually since 1929 for a total of 120 games as of 2024. The rivalry is commonly referred to as the Red River Shootout, the Red River Rivalry, or the Red River Showdown. The name refers to the Red River, which forms part of the border between Oklahoma and Texas.

Since 1934, the game has been played on the second Saturday of October, though it has occasionally been played on the first Saturday. Since 1932, the game&#x27;s site has been the Cotton Bowl inside Fair Park in Dallas. The winner of the regular-season matchup receives the Golden Hat trophy, a gold ten-gallon hat once made of bronze. The trophy is kept by the winning school&#x27;s athletic department until the next game.

==Overview==
The first game in the series was played in 1900, when Oklahoma was still a territory. The game was called the Red River Shootout until the 100th game in 2005, when, sponsored by SBC Communications, the game was officially renamed the SBC Red River Rivalry. &quot;Shootout&quot; was replaced so as not to convey an attitude of condoning gun violence. The following year, with SBC&#x27;s purchase of AT&amp;T Corporation, the game was renamed the AT&amp;T Red River Rivalry. It was renamed again in 2014 to the AT&amp;T Red River Showdown, before Allstate secured naming rights in 2023, and changed the name to the Allstate Red River Rivalry. The terms Red River Shootout and Red River Showdown are also applied to meetings between the two schools in all other sports.

Since 1936, the first year of the AP Poll, at least one of the teams has come into the game ranked on 70 occasions, including every one of the last 19 meetings, a streak which ended in 2022 when both teams came into the game unranked and 3–2. Texas leads the overall series .

In 2005, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; asked the 119 Division 1A football coaches to identify the top rivalry game in college football. The Red River Rivalry ranked third, behind only Michigan–Ohio State and Army–Navy.

==History==
===1900–1960===

The first meeting between the Oklahoma and Texas football teams occurred in 1900, before either team had acquired their current nicknames. At the time, the Texas team was typically called &quot;Varsity&quot;. The write-up in the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; article referred to the game as a &quot;practice game&quot;. The paper reported:
The game of football yesterday afternoon at the Varsity athletic field was an interesting contrast, notwithstanding the rather one-sided score of 28–2 in favor of the Varsity.

In the 1950 rivalry game, Billy Vessels scored on an 11-yard run late in the contest, and Texas native Jim Weatherall kicked the extra point to give Oklahoma a narrow 14–13 win.

In 1958, Texas defeated Oklahoma by one point, breaking the University of Oklahoma&#x27;s series dominance of the 1950s. Texas Longhorns head coach Darrell Royal had 10 years earlier been the quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners, and defeated his former coach and mentor Bud Wilkinson in the game. Wilkinson would lose to Texas the next five years before retiring in 1963.

===1960–1995===
The 1963 game featured No. 1 Oklahoma versus No. 2 Texas, the seventh regular season No. 1 versus No. 2 game (eighth, overall) in the history of the AP Poll. Texas won the game, took the No. 1 ranking, and kept it for the rest of the season, winning its first national championship.

Prior to the 1970 meeting, Oklahoma changed its offense to the Wishbone formation following a home loss to Oregon State (the Sooners had an open week between the games vs.. the Beavers and Longhorns). The offense was invented by Texas offensive coordinator Emory Bellard two years earlier and used by the Longhorns to win 23 consecutive games and the 1969 national championship to that point.

Texas routed Oklahoma 41–9 in 1970 and extended their winning streak to 30 before losing to Notre Dame 24–11 in the Cotton Bowl. Meanwhile, as the Sooners mastered the Wishbone, they went 6–1–1 to close 1970 and opened 1971 with three consecutive victories before facing the Longhorns.

Oklahoma showed just how far they had come in one season, shredding Texas for 435 yards rushing in a 48–27 victory. The Sooners finished 1971 averaging 472 yards rushing per game, an 11–1 record and a No. 2 final ranking, with only a 35–31 loss to Nebraska in the &quot;Game of the Century&quot; keeping Chuck Fairbanks&#x27; squad from the national championship.

In 1972, Oklahoma spied on Texas&#x27; practices, allowing them to block a quick kick the Longhorns had secretly been working on en route to a victory.

The 1976 rivalry game was overshadowed by allegations by Texas coach Darrell Royal that Oklahoma had been spying on his practices. The claim was later confirmed in OU Coach Barry Switzer&#x27;s book, &quot;Bootlegger&#x27;s Boy&quot;. U.S. President Gerald Ford attended the game and made an appearance with Royal and Switzer, but the two coaches did not speak to each other as they were in a serious feud. The game ended in a 6–6 tie. It was Royal&#x27;s final Red River Shootout.

In the 1977 game, Texas lost both their starting and backup quarterbacks in the first half. Yet, behind the power running of eventual Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell, a strong defense, and the unheralded composure of third-string-quarterback Randy McEachern, the Horns prevailed 13–6.

In a rain-soaked 1984 game, Texas entered the game ranked No. 1, Oklahoma No. 3 (No. 2 in some polls). Switzer wore a ballcap during the game that read &quot;Beat Texas.&quot; This game also marked the only time that future University of Texas at Austin head coach Mack Brown participated in the Red River Shootout not as a Texas Longhorn, but as Oklahoma&#x27;s offensive coordinator. Texas jumped to a 10–0 halftime lead but Oklahoma rallied to lead 15–12 in the game&#x27;s closing seconds. With 10 seconds remaining, trailing by 3, Texas was driving and was within field goal range but decided to take one more shot at the end zone. Texas quarterback (and future North Texas head coach) Todd Dodge appeared to be intercepted in the end zone by Oklahoma&#x27;s Keith Stanberry, but the officials ruled it incomplete. Texas&#x27; Jeff Ward subsequently kicked a field goal and the game ended in a 15–15 tie.

===1996–2001===
The first Big 12 Conference overtime game, the 1996 meeting featured a John Blake squad under the direction of freshman quarterback Justin Fuente. The game ended Oklahoma 30–Texas 27 after a come from behind victory in the final seven minutes. Down 24–13, Jarrail Jackson returned a punt 51 yards for a touchdown, then Fuente completed a 2-point conversion pass to Stephen Alexander to cut the lead to just 3. The Sooners forced the Longhorns to punt, and drove to the Texas 28. Jeremy Alexander kicked a 44-yard field goal to tie the game at 24 each.
In overtime, Texas was forced to settle for a 43-yard Phil Dawson field goal, after losing 1 yard on three plays. Lining up at the Texas 25, James Allen broke a ten-yard run, carried for two and three yards, then caught an 8-yard screen pass from Fuente on 3rd and 5 from the 10. On the next play, Allen took a pitch from Fuente two yards into the endzone, doing what he was unable to do two years before.

The 2000 game was marked by rain and 49-degree weather, but it ended up being noted for the most lopsided margin of victory in the history of the match-up at that time, though Oklahoma would top its feat just three years later. Oklahoma came into the game ranked 10th, with Texas ranked 11th. This was the highest combined rankings of the teams since 1984. The Sooners got up to a 42-point lead before Texas scored, finally winning the game 63–14. OU also held Texas to minus-7 yards rushing, an all-time regular-season low for the Longhorns.

Longhorn coach Mack Brown said &quot;It wasn&#x27;t even a game because we did not play in the first half.&quot; Sooner coach Bob Stoops said, &quot;This was a total team victory, everybody made plays. ...We had a little bit of everything.&quot; OU President David Boren cancelled classes the following Monday on account of inclement weather: &quot;It was snowing touchdowns in Dallas.&quot; Sooner running back Quentin Griffin scored six touchdowns, tying the all-time NCAA record for most rushing touchdowns in a game. Oklahoma went on to an undefeated season, and won the 2000 National Championship.

The 2001 game, which ended Oklahoma 14–Texas 3, was a classic defensive struggle that was notable for a play made late in the 4th quarter.

Both the Sooners&#x27; and the Longhorns&#x27; defenses were outstanding, holding their counterparts to less than 100 yards rushing for the entire game. When either offense could muster any momentum, they were often let down by their kicker: OU&#x27;s Tim Duncan missed two field goals, and UT&#x27;s Dusty Mangum had one blocked. OU led 7–3 at the half on the back of a Quentin Griffin 2-yard touchdown in the second quarter. That score held until late in the fourth quarter.

The Sooners got the ball with just over eight minutes to play on their own 20-yard line, and put together a 12-play, 53-yard drive that took them all the way to the Texas 27-yard line. Facing a 4th &amp; 16, OU sent out Tim Duncan for what appeared to be a 44-yard FG attempt. Instead, Duncan sent a pooch punt deep into the Texas zone, which caught UT&#x27;s Nathan Vasher off guard. Confused, Vasher caught the ball at his own 3-yard line and was immediately downed.

Down 7–3, Texas had 2:06 to drive 97 yards on the stiff Sooner defense. On first down, Texas quarterback Chris Simms&#x27; pass was deflected by OU safety Roy Williams, who had blitzed and literally leapt over the blocker, Brett Robin, to collide with Simms at the moment he released the ball. The ball landed right in Oklahoma linebacker Teddy Lehman&#x27;s hands, who walked into the endzone for a touchdown. The play happened so fast, many fans did not know exactly what had happened. The play by Roy Williams is often called &quot;The Superman Play&quot; because of the way that Williams resembled Superman flying through the air with his arms stretched out at Chris Simms when he hit him. Duncan&#x27;s extra point sealed the 14–3 OU victory.

===2004–2009===
The 2005 game, which ended Texas 45–Oklahoma 12, was the 100th meeting in the series and a special logo was created to commemorate the event. The game logo included both team logos, the logo of sponsor SBC Communications, the number 100, a football, and a star. Prior to the game, the Longhorns were ranked 2nd by the Associated Press, and the Sooners were unranked for the first time since 1999, which was also Texas&#x27;s last victory over OU.

By breaking the string of five consecutive losses to Oklahoma, Longhorn coach Mack Brown preserved the Longhorns&#x27;s National Championship hopes. With the win, Texas tied its largest margin of victory in the series. Freshman running back Jamaal Charles set a record for rushing yards by a Texas freshman in the series. With his 80-yard scamper, Charles also had the longest touchdown from scrimmage by a Texas running back in the series.

The game also featured one of the most violent hits in the series history, when Texas DE, Brian Robison, blindsided Oklahoma quarterback, Rhett Bomar, in the 4th quarter, causing a fumble and ensuing touchdown by Longhorn tackle, Rodrique Wright.

As had occurred the two seasons prior, the road to the National Championship game went through Dallas. Oklahoma left the game with a 1–1 conference record and a 2–3 record overall, finishing with a 6–2 conference and 8–4 overall record, including a victory in the Holiday Bowl. The Longhorns improved to 5–0 overall, 2–0 in the Big 12 on their way to an 8–0 conference, 13–0 overall record, including a victory in the Rose Bowl and the 2005 football National Championship.
The 2007 match-up between Oklahoma and Texas was predicted to be the No. 3 game to watch in 2007 by SI.com&#x27;s &quot;Top 20 Games To Watch In 2007&quot; list, and it did not disappoint. The game was close from start to finish as the Sooners struck first with a quick touchdown pass to TE Jermaine Gresham. QB Colt McCoy&#x27;s passing attack responded quickly to tie the game for the &#x27;Horns, then again to take a lead, particularly off the efforts of TE Jermichael Finley. The Sooners were able to tie the score going into the half off of another Sam Bradford-to-Jermaine Gresham connection. The Longhorns were able to get into the red zone at the beginning of the second half, but a costly fumble by RB Jamaal Charles at the 5-yard line cut short the momentum. A few series later, RB DeMarco Murray ripped off a 65-yard TD run to give the Sooners a 21–14 lead. The &#x27;Horns did not take this lying down, as they were able to score soon thereafter. The Oklahoma passing attack scored the final touchdown of the game with about ten minutes left to play, on a 35-yard touchdown pass to WR Malcolm Kelly from Bradford. The &#x27;Horns threatened twice in the final waning minutes, and it took a CB Reggie Smith interception and defensive play against star WR Limas Sweed to secure the win for Oklahoma.

The 2008 Meeting of the Red River Rivalry ended Texas 45-Oklahoma 35. At the time, it was the highest scoring event in the history of rivalry (the 2021 game now holds that record, with Oklahoma beating Texas, 55–48), and it was seen by the most fans, a record 92,182.&lt;ref name=&quot;TX/ou recap&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Oklahoma ranked No. 1 in the nation and Texas was ranked No. 5. Both were 5–0 coming into the game. In the first quarter, Bradford completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to Manuel Johnson. The Sooners led 7–0. With 6:41 left in the first quarter, Texas answered with a Hunter Lawrence 26-yard field goal. OU scored 2 touchdowns in the second quarter and Texas scored two touchdowns and a field goal including a 96-yard kickoff return by Jordan Shipley. The score at the half was 21–20 OU.

===2009–2014===
In 2009, Texas won a low-scoring game, 16–13. Texas scored one touchdown and three field goals, while OU scored one touchdown and two field goals. Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford had injured his shoulder earlier in the year when playing the BYU Cougars. Despite this injury, Bradford started, confident that his shoulder was healed. However, early in the first quarter a sack by Aaron Williams re-aggravated his injury and forced him out of the game, ending his season and his college career. Texas quarterback Colt McCoy threw for 127 yards, while the team combined for 142 rushing yards. OU&#x27;s replacement quarterback, Landry Jones, replaced Bradford and threw for 250 yards of passing with 2 interceptions. The most notable statistic of the game was that the Sooners were held to minus 16 yards of rushing by the Longhorn defense.

In 2012, the 107th meeting of the Longhorns and Sooners, Oklahoma routed Texas 63–21. It appeared that the game would have a very different feel than the 2011 meeting after OU scored its first touchdown and Quandre Diggs of Texas recovered a blocked PAT, running the distance of the field to score a 2-point conversion. This game had moments that will add to the history of this rivalry: Oklahoma&#x27;s Damien Williams broke free for a 95-yard touchdown run for the longest rush in Red River Rivalry history. Trey Millard had a 73-yard reception, the longest pass play by an OU player in Red River Rivalry history, surpassing Buddy Leake&#x27;s 65-yarder in 1953. The Sooners lead the Longhorns most of this game, and Oklahoma ended up with a 677–289 advantage in total yardage. The game was the third 60+ point Red River scoring effort in Bob Stoops&#x27; tenure.

In 2013, Texas came onto the field in Dallas with head coach Mack Brown on the hot seat. Former Longhorn great Earl Campbell had publicly stated two weeks earlier that Mack Brown was &quot;too old&quot; to continue coaching. Brown&#x27;s players rallied behind their beleaguered coach, however, and Texas won the Red River Rivalry game for the first time since 2009. Texas walked in as major underdogs, in part due to a 1–2 start with an upset loss at BYU and a loss to No. 25 Ole Miss. The game was notable in part because a defensive lineman from each team scored a touchdown on an interception return. In addition, Colt McCoy&#x27;s brother Case led the Longhorns to victory, becoming the first quarterback to lead the team to victory since his brother in 2009.

In 2014, the game was played following both teams&#x27; losses the prior weekend. Oklahoma had fallen to No. 11 in the rankings following its loss to No. 25 TCU, with a 4–1 record (1–1 Big 12), whereas Texas had fallen to a 2–3 record after losing to No. 7 Baylor (also 1–1 Big 12). Texas&#x27; defense was able to prevent an Oklahoma offensive touchdown for the entire first half, and held the Sooners to under 30 total first-half yards, while the Texas Offense gained over 240 yards. In each game of the 2014 season, every team that had led the opposition by more than 200 yards gained was 57–0. However, another perfect record was on the line, as Oklahoma&#x27;s first kick return was returned for a touchdown, and on Texas&#x27; first second-quarter possession, Oklahoma&#x27;s defense forced an interception that was returned for a touchdown - in every Oklahoma game where that occurred, Oklahoma won (8–0). Oklahoma was able to widen the halftime score of 17–13 to 31–13 after a pair of offensive touchdowns, but Texas scored two late touchdowns of their own, failing on the second two-point conversion. Oklahoma was then able to take several minutes off the clock, and Texas was unable to score on its final possession, ending the game losing 26–31 to Oklahoma.

===2015–2019===
In 2015, Oklahoma walked into Dallas No. 10 in the country with a high-octane Air Raid offense, while Texas was unranked after a string of painful losses due to special teams (Cal 45–44, missed PAT; Oklahoma State 30–27, mishandled snap on punt setting up FG) and blowout losses (Notre Dame 38–3; TCU 50–7) and Charlie Strong&#x27;s job already being in question in his second year. The Longhorns&#x27; running game pumped out 313 yards, which featured D&#x27;Onta Foreman breaking free for an 81-yard rush to set up a TD to put Texas up 24–10 while the young Texas defense held OU to 67 yards rushing. OU quarterback Baker Mayfield was sacked multiple times as Texas outgunned Oklahoma 24–17, giving Strong his first signature win.

In 2018, Texas came into Dallas ranked No. 19 facing the undefeated No. 7 Oklahoma Sooners, the first time both teams were ranked since 2012. Heisman hopeful Kyler Murray got Oklahoma out to a fast start scoring on a 6-play, 65-yard drive that took only 2:40. On the ensuing possession, Texas, led by sophomore quarterback Sam Ehlinger, answered back with a 5-play 75-yard drive, in what was to be a common theme in the highest scoring game in series history. Texas appeared destined to regain the Golden Hat after taking a commanding 45–24 lead with just under a minute left in the third quarter, but three unanswered touchdowns, including a 67-yard run by Kyler Murray that took only 11 seconds, tied the game at 45–45 with just 2:38 left to play. After driving the ball to the Oklahoma 23-yard line, Texas&#x27;s Freshman kicker, Cameron Dicker, coolly kicked in a 40-yard game-winning field goal with 14 seconds left on the clock. Sam Ehlinger set the Texas Red River Showdown record for total offense with 394 yards.

On December 1 the same year, the two faced off again in AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington to determine the Big 12 Conference Championship. It was the third time in history when they played each other again in the same season (1901 and 1903). No. 5 Oklahoma overcame a strong start by No. 14 Texas to win their fourth straight Big 12 title.

On October 12, 2019, the sixth-ranked Sooners defeated the 11th-ranked Longhorns 34–27, getting 366 yards and four touchdowns from quarterback Jalen Hurts, a graduate transfer from Alabama. Though Oklahoma&#x27;s lead was never larger than 14, Texas was playing from behind for almost the entire game, catching up midway through the third quarter before a 51-yard Hurts touchdown pass to CeeDee Lamb that put the Sooners in front for good.

===2020–present===
The October 10, 2020, meeting saw unranked Oklahoma outlasting No. 22 Texas 53–45 in four overtimes, in the third highest-scoring game in the history of the Red River Showdown.

The meetings on October 9, 2021, the first one since the two schools announced their move to the SEC, and October 8, 2022, featured two very distinct games, both setting records. The 2021 matchup saw sixth-ranked Sooners rallying from a 21-point first-quarter deficit to edge the 21st-ranked Longhorns 55–48 in the highest-scoring game in the rivalry. In 2022, 3–2 Texas won in a 49–0 shutout over the 3–2 Sooners, marking the first shutout result since 2004 and Texas&#x27; biggest win in the rivalry by scoring margin .

The October 7, 2023 game, the last meeting for both schools as Big 12 members, featured the first undefeated matchup in the rivalry since 2011. In the game, 12th-ranked Oklahoma defeated 3rd-ranked Texas 34–30 on a last-second touchdown pass to Nic Anderson. The game recorded 7.8 million viewers, the most since 2009, and was attended by SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey as both schools are set to join the SEC starting in 2024.

The October 12, 2024 installment of the Rivalry, the first one for both schools as members of the SEC, ended with a Texas win and a score of Texas 34, Oklahoma 3. Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers made his return from nearly a month lost to injury, and led the Longhorns to victory after a difficult first quarter after which Texas trailed 0-3 and had given the ball away on a turnover deep in their own territory. Oklahoma was challenged to move the ball against the Texas defense throughout the contest, racking up only three points and 237 total yards against Texas&#x27; 406, despite winning the time of possession battle 32:07 to 27:53.

==Venue==

The Oklahoma–Texas game has been played in six locations. They have played in Norman and Oklahoma City in Oklahoma, and Arlington, Austin, Dallas and Houston in Texas. The series began in 1900 and has been played in Dallas since 1912, except for 1913 (Houston), 1922 (Norman), and 1923 (Austin). Dallas was chosen as a &quot;neutral&quot; site since it is situated approximately halfway between Austin, Texas and Norman, Oklahoma – the sites of the main campuses of the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Oklahoma, respectively.

Since 1932, the game has been held at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, during the State Fair of Texas. The designated &quot;home&quot; team alternates from year to year: Oklahoma in even-numbered years and Texas in odd-numbered years. Ticket sales for the game are split 50–50 between the two schools, with the stadium divided along the 50-yard line. Historically, the Oklahoma fans have occupied the south end zone, which contains the tunnel where both teams enter and exit the field. Beginning in 2007, the teams have had the option to alternate North and South ends of the field, thereby giving the home team fans the seats adjacent to the tunnel leading to both teams&#x27; locker rooms. However, Texas has declined to exercise its option to move to the south end each year in which they have been the designated home team. Former Texas coach Charlie Strong said he would favor Texas fans being in the south end zone during their home games.

On June 10, 2014, Dallas officials announced that the football game between Oklahoma and Texas would be held at Fair Park through 2025.

On December 6, 2023, it was announced that the football game would continue to be held at Fair Park through 2036.

==Game results==
Rankings from AP Poll (and CFP Rankings, for 2018 Big 12 Championship Game) - Released prior to game.

=== Top-5 games ===
Since 1936, when the AP Poll began being released continuously, the Longhorns and Sooners have met 11 times when both have been ranked in the top 5. The first instance came in 1950, with the most recent in 2008. Unlike most college rivalry games, the results of these games did not usually affect each team&#x27;s final standings because it&#x27;s held in early October. The 1963 and 1984 games were the only time the teams were the top two in the rankings.

Oklahoma holds a 6–4–1 record in these top-5 meetings.

==Miscellaneous==
===Highest attendance===
The highest attendance in series history is 96,009, achieved in 2009, 2010, and 2011.
===Results by Location===


=== Results by decade ===
&quot;As of October 12, 2024&quot;
==Game trophies==
There are three Red River Rivalry trophies given to the winner of the annual Red River Rivalry: the Golden Hat, the Red River Rivalry trophy, and the Governors&#x27; trophy.

===Golden Hat===
The Golden Hat is by far the best known of the three, and the only one to be awarded on the field at the end of the game. The trophy is a gold cowboy hat mounted on a large block of wood. According to &quot;The Daily Texan&quot;,[B]oth teams signed a contract to play in Dallas during the Texas State Fair, beginning with the 1929 season. The deal was for 10 years, but the tradition has carried on for three-quarters of a century. To show its gratitude, the fair donated the Golden Hat trophy, a golden replica of a ten-gallon cowboy hat, which the two teams play for every year. The Longhorns won the first Shootout, but since then the Golden Hat has crossed the Red River many times. The trophy was created in 1941. When it was created it was known as the &quot;Bronze Hat&quot; or &quot;Brass Hat&quot;, as it was bronze in color. However, when the hat was reworked in the 1970s it came out gold, and is now known as the Golden Hat. The Golden Hat trophy is kept each year by the winning team&#x27;s athletic department. With the teams meeting twice in 2018 (once in the regular season and once in the Big 12 Conference Championship Game) it was determined that the Golden Hat would not be on the line in the 2nd game as it was for the regular season game. Therefore, the trophy remained in Austin, Texas, after Texas&#x27; 48–45 regular season win over Oklahoma in 2018. Oklahoma won the rematch, 39–27 in the Big 12 Title Game.

===Red River Rivalry trophy===
Since 2003, the Red River Rivalry trophy has been exchanged between the student bodies of the two schools. This trophy was developed by Alex Yaffe, former OU Student Body President, and Katie King, UT&#x27;s former student body president. The trophy bears the image of the two states as well as miniature football helmets to represent both teams.

===Governors&#x27; trophy===
There is also a governors&#x27; trophy exchanged between the governors of the two states. The governors of Texas and Oklahoma often place a bet on the game, such as the losing governor having to present a side of beef to the winning state governor, who then donates the beef to charity.

===NROTC trophy===
Another annual tradition is the running of game balls by the schools&#x27; Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps programs. Each school&#x27;s NROTC program uses a relay running system to run one game ball all the way from their respective campus to Dallas. Once there, they participate against each other in a football scrimmage, with the winner taking home the Red River Shootout Flag Football Trophy. This trophy is awarded without regard to who wins the main football game.

<doc id="1026842" wikidata="Q490811" url="?curid=1026842" title="Daegu subway fire">
<text>On February 18, 2003, an arsonist set fire to a Daegu Metro subway train as it arrived at Jungangno station in central Daegu, South Korea. The resulting blaze, which spread when a second train stopped at the same station, killed 192 people and injured another 151. It remains the deadliest loss of life in a single deliberate incident in South Korean peacetime history, surpassing the 1982 shooting rampage committed by Woo Bum-kon.

==Arsonist==
The arsonist, Kim Dae-han (), was a 56-year-old unemployed former taxi driver who had suffered a stroke in November 2001 that left him partly paralyzed. Kim was dissatisfied with his medical treatment and had expressed sentiments of violence and depression; he later told police he wanted to kill himself, but to do so in a crowded place rather than alone. By most accounts, on the morning of February 18, he boarded train 1079 on Line 1 in the direction of Daegok Station, carrying a duffel bag that contained two green milk cartons filled with a flammable liquid, possibly paint thinner or gasoline.

==Arson==
As the train left Banwoldang station around 9:53 a.m., Kim began fumbling with the cartons and a cigarette lighter, alarming other passengers who tried to stop him. In the struggle, one of the cartons spilled and its liquid contents caught fire as the train pulled into Jungangno station in downtown Daegu. Kim, his back and legs on fire, managed to escape along with many passengers on train 1079, but within two minutes the fire had spread to all six cars. The fire spread quickly in the insulation between the layers of aluminum that form the shell of the cars, the vinyl and plastic materials in seat cushions and strap handles, and heavy plastic matting on the floors, producing thick smoke as it burned.

=== Errors compounding the disaster ===

The operator of the train, Choi Jeong-hwan (; aged 31), failed to notify subway officials immediately of the fire.

Smoke being visible on their closed-circuit television monitors, subway officials radioed the operator of train 1080, Choi Sang-yeol (), advising him to proceed with caution because there was a fire in the station. Train 1080 entered Jungangno station and stopped alongside blazing train 1079 approximately four minutes later. The doors opened only briefly, then shut, apparently in an effort to keep out the toxic smoke that had filled the station. Shortly after train 1080&#x27;s arrival, an automatic fire detector shut down the power supply to both trains, preventing train 1080 from leaving the station.

Transcripts show Choi Sang-yeol made three announcements advising passengers in train 1080 to remain seated while he attempted to reach superiors. Finally, he was advised &quot;Quickly, run somewhere else. Go up... kill the engine and go.&quot; Choi then opened the doors and fled, but in doing so he removed the master key, which led to a shutdown of the onboard batteries that powered the train doors and effectively sealed passengers inside. Later investigation showed that all 79 passengers remained trapped inside train 1080 and died there.

Inadequate emergency equipment also worsened the disaster. Daegu subway trains were not equipped with fire extinguishers, and the stations lacked sprinklers and emergency lighting. Many victims became disoriented in the dark, smoke-filled underground station and died of asphyxiation looking for exits. Emergency ventilation systems also proved inadequate. Over 1,300 fire and emergency personnel responded and the fire itself was extinguished around 1:38 p.m.; however, the toxicity of the smoke prevented them from entering the station for another three and a half hours.

== Victims ==
The intensity of the fire made it difficult to accurately assess the number of victims. Most were burned beyond recognition, many to the bone, and required DNA analysis to identify. A total of 192 people were confirmed to have died. Of the bodies found, 185 were identifiable; six could not initially be identified, of which three were discovered using DNA; and one person&#x27;s possessions were identified but their remains could not be located.

As the incident occurred late in the morning rush hour, most of the victims were students or young women who worked in the downtown district&#x27;s department stores, which opened at 10:30 a.m. Many were able to contact loved ones on their mobile phones, and mobile phone operators released call connection and attempt records to help authorities determine who was in the station.

== Aftermath ==

The incident prompted outpourings of sympathy and anger from throughout South Korea and internationally.

Officials promised to install better safety equipment in subway stations, and added spray-on fire resistant chemicals to the interiors of the cars of the Daegu Metropolitan Subway. Six stations were taken out of service for refurbishment and restored in April 2003. The tragedy was considered by many a national embarrassment, provoking debate about whether South Korea had cut too many corners in safety during its rapid industrialization. Several metro trains throughout the country were subsequently refurbished to improve fire-resistant standards within a few years of the accident.

On August 7, the Daegu District Court convicted Choi Sang-yeol, operator of train 1080, and Choi Jeong-hwan, operator of train 1079, sentencing them to prison for five and four years respectively for criminal negligence. Kim Dae-han was convicted of arson and homicide. Although prosecutors, with the support of victims&#x27; families, had sought the death penalty, the court instead sentenced him to life imprisonment on account of his remorse and mental instability. Kim died of a chronic illness in prison on August 31, 2004, in the city of Jinju, where he had been receiving medical treatment.

In December 2008, the Daegu Safety Theme Park opened. The goal was to educate the inhabitants of Daegu about safety.

<text>The ADI Condor was a motor glider of unusual configuration built in the United States in 1981. While most motor gliders follow traditional sailplane layout, the Condor was of twin-boom configuration, with twin, inwardly canted tail fins joined at their tips by a common horizontal stabilizer. A pusher propeller driven by a converted Volkswagen engine was mounted at the rear of the central nacelle that seated the pilot and passenger in tandem. Construction throughout was of composite materials.

The single example of the aircraft was destroyed in a crash in late 1982 after an engine failure.

<doc id="1026848" wikidata="Q869108" url="?curid=1026848" title="Weyl tensor">
<text>In differential geometry, the Weyl curvature tensor, named after Hermann Weyl, is a measure of the curvature of spacetime or, more generally, a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Like the Riemann curvature tensor, the Weyl tensor expresses the tidal force that a body feels when moving along a geodesic. The Weyl tensor differs from the Riemann curvature tensor in that it does not convey information on how the volume of the body changes, but rather only how the shape of the body is distorted by the tidal force. The Ricci curvature, or trace component of the Riemann tensor contains precisely the information about how volumes change in the presence of tidal forces, so the Weyl tensor is the traceless component of the Riemann tensor. This tensor has the same symmetries as the Riemann tensor, but satisfies the extra condition that it is trace-free: metric contraction on any pair of indices yields zero. It is obtained from the Riemann tensor by subtracting a tensor that is a linear expression in the Ricci tensor. 

In general relativity, the Weyl curvature is the only part of the curvature that exists in free space—a solution of the vacuum Einstein equation—and it governs the propagation of gravitational waves through regions of space devoid of matter. More generally, the Weyl curvature is the only component of curvature for Ricci-flat manifolds and always governs the characteristics of the field equations of an Einstein manifold.

In dimensions 2 and 3 the Weyl curvature tensor vanishes identically. In dimensions ≥ 4, the Weyl curvature is generally nonzero. If the Weyl tensor vanishes in dimension ≥ 4, then the metric is locally conformally flat: there exists a local coordinate system in which the metric tensor is proportional to a constant tensor. This fact was a key component of Nordström&#x27;s theory of gravitation, which was a precursor of general relativity.

==Definition==
The Weyl tensor can be obtained from the full curvature tensor by subtracting out various traces. This is most easily done by writing the Riemann tensor as a (0,4) valence tensor (by contracting with the metric). The (0,4) valence Weyl tensor is then 

:formula_1

where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of the manifold, &quot;g&quot; is the metric, &quot;R&quot; is the Riemann tensor, &quot;Ric&quot; is the Ricci tensor, &quot;s&quot; is the scalar curvature, and formula_2 denotes the Kulkarni–Nomizu product of two symmetric (0,2) tensors:

:formula_3

In tensor component notation, this can be written as 
:formula_4

The ordinary (1,3) valent Weyl tensor is then given by contracting the above with the inverse of the metric.

The decomposition () expresses the Riemann tensor as an orthogonal direct sum, in the sense that
:formula_5

This decomposition, known as the Ricci decomposition, expresses the Riemann curvature tensor into its irreducible components under the action of the orthogonal group. In dimension 4, the Weyl tensor further decomposes into invariant factors for the action of the special orthogonal group, the self-dual and antiself-dual parts &quot;C&quot;+ and &quot;C&quot;−.

The Weyl tensor can also be expressed using the Schouten tensor, which is a trace-adjusted multiple of the Ricci tensor,
:formula_6

Then
:formula_7

In indices,
:formula_8

where formula_9 is the Riemann tensor, formula_10 is the Ricci tensor, formula_11 is the Ricci scalar (the scalar curvature) and brackets around indices refers to the antisymmetric part. Equivalently,
:formula_12

where &quot;S&quot; denotes the Schouten tensor.

==Properties==

===Conformal rescaling===
The Weyl tensor has the special property that it is invariant under conformal changes to the metric. That is, if formula_13 for some positive scalar function formula_14 then the (1,3) valent Weyl tensor satisfies formula_15. For this reason the Weyl tensor is also called the conformal tensor. It follows that a necessary condition for a Riemannian manifold to be conformally flat is that the Weyl tensor vanish. In dimensions ≥ 4 this condition is sufficient as well. In dimension 3 the vanishing of the Cotton tensor is a necessary and sufficient condition for the Riemannian manifold being conformally flat. Any 2-dimensional (smooth) Riemannian manifold is conformally flat, a consequence of the existence of isothermal coordinates.

Indeed, the existence of a conformally flat scale amounts to solving the overdetermined partial differential equation
:formula_16

In dimension ≥ 4, the vanishing of the Weyl tensor is the only integrability condition for this equation; in dimension 3, it is the Cotton tensor instead.

===Symmetries===
The Weyl tensor has the same symmetries as the Riemann tensor. This includes:
:formula_17

In addition, of course, the Weyl tensor is trace free:
:formula_18

for all &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;. In indices these four conditions are
:formula_19

===Bianchi identity===
Taking traces of the usual second Bianchi identity of the Riemann tensor eventually shows that
:formula_20

where &quot;S&quot; is the Schouten tensor. The valence (0,3) tensor on the right-hand side is the Cotton tensor, apart from the initial factor.

<text>Aldworth is a village and mainly farmland civil parish in the English county of Berkshire, near the boundary with Oxfordshire.

==Orthography and slight change of name==

Aldworth was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 by scribes whose orthography was heavily geared towards French, lacking k and w, regulated forms for sounds ð and θ and ending many hard consonant words with e, as &quot;Elleorde&quot;, hinting at El(d)ward, the Old English for &quot;Old Ward&quot; i.e. &quot;Old farmed out (let) land&quot; Scribes in the 12th century rendered it at least once as &quot;Aldewurda&quot;.

==Geography==
Aldworth is in a rural area between Reading, Newbury and Streatley. It includes the hamlets of Westridge Green and Hungerford Green. It lies on the high ground of the Berkshire Downs, just off the B4009 road between Newbury and Streatley. The Ridgeway, an 87-mile (140 km) pre-Roman footpath crosses the north of the parish. 

==History==
King Alfred&#x27;s defeat of the Danes at the Battle of Ashdown in January 871, is said by some to have occurred near The Ridgeway and Lowbury Hill.

In medieval times there was a fortified manor house or castle; La Beche Castle once stood on the site of what is now Beche Farm in the parish. This was the main residence of the De La Beche family, after whom it was named. This well-known family of medieval knights had held high positions at court since at least 1260. The De La Beche family remained powerful landowners and knights in the 14th century. Many were retainers to the king, warders to the Tower of London, and sheriffs of Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The family was influential in the reigns of Edward II and Edward III, and embroiled in the royal intrigue of the time. Sir Phillip was imprisoned in Scarborough Castle from 1322 to 1327, but later pardoned by Edward III. His father, also Sir Phillip, had been imprisoned and later pardoned under Edward II.

==Amenities==

A small area in the south of the village bears woodland centuries old that is still coppiced and carpeted with bluebells. It is open to the public subject to informal permission. The Bell Inn is a 15th-century inn that has twice won a National Pub of the Year award. Another pub, The Four Points, stands at a crossroads south of the village centre.

==Governance==
Aldworth is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It belongs to the West Berkshire unitary authority and the parliamentary constituency of Newbury.

==Parish church==

The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary is a Grade I listed building, parts of which date back to the 12th century.

The church contains numerous effigies to the De La Beche family. The collection holds the largest number of medieval memorials to a single family in any parish church. The figures are supposed to be life-size representations, but some of the knights are over seven feet tall, which has led to them being known as the Aldworth Giants. They were long thought to have been erected in the 1340s by the influential Sir Nicholas De La Beche (sometimes erroneously called Lord De La Beche), but historians now prefer to date them variously in the Middle Ages. A large number of the effigies were damaged by Parliamentarian iconoclasts during the English Civil War of the 17th century. Many of the knights are missing the lower part of their legs, noses and arms, presumably because these were easy parts to break off. Parliamentarians may have seen the giants as a symbol of royalty, although many churches were ransacked in the same period.

In the churchyard to the east of the church is the Aldworth Yew, an ancient yew tree. The yew was a popular subject for postcards in the 19th century. The trunk diameter was measured at 9 yards (8.23m) in 1644, but in 1787 it was reported to be in decline. In 1909, its girth was described as requiring &quot;seven men to span it&quot;, and little remained other than the broken trunk and a few branches, most broken and dead. By the late 20th century, the trunk was mostly hollow, and it broke during the Gale of January 1976, though some roots survived, enabling the tree to regrow with fresh growth. In 2016, the yew was certified to be over 1,000 years old.

The poet, Laurence Binyon, moved to Westridge Green on his retirement in 1933. After his death in 1943, his ashes were scattered in the churchyard, where there is a slate memorial plaque to him. The parents of Emily Tennyson, Lady Tennyson née Sellwood, the wife of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, are also buried there.

<text>Schwaben Quellen (in English, &quot;Swabian Springs&quot;) is a large spa/waterpark complex located in Stuttgart, Germany. The Schwaben Quellen is associated with the SI-Centrum (Stuttgart International Centrum), an entertainment complex in Stuttgart.

It is a member of the European Waterparks Association (EWA), and provides saunas, steamrooms, and various kinds of baths. There are also what are referred to as &quot;adventure showers&quot;. A small room full of snow, kept at , is also available, so that participants can roll in the snow naked (this often follows use of a sauna or other type of steam room). Like many German bathing areas, people are expected to be nude throughout the sauna part of the resort. 

Some of the baths are indoors, and others are outdoors, providing a good mix of different bathing environments. There is an indoor restaurant overlooking some of the baths, where a meal can be purchased using the wristband that also functions as a key and a locator. The wristband is coded for the locker into which the participants place their clothing and personal effects, and the wristband serves as point of contact, with an embedded microchip which tracks the bathers throughout the facility.

<text>Chaoyangmen Outer Street () is a major through route in Beijing, China, and runs through the Chaowai area near Chaoyangmen. Geographically, it is in the eastern urban area, and is still considered very close to the city centre even though it lies outside the 2nd Ring Road. It is north of a similarly significant area, the future Beijing CBD.

Chaoyangmen Outer Street runs from Chaoyangmen Bridge through to the massive Dongdaqiao crossing. In its path lie office blocks, shopping areas, and technology stores (including the Bainaohui area), making it one of the busiest streets in Beijing. Traffic is often congested, especially near the nodal points Chaoyangmen and Dongdaqiao.

==History== 
=== 13th–19th century ===
Chaoyangmen was originally called &quot;Qihuamen&quot;. Chaoyangmenwai Street is the road to the Qiyangmen Gate during the Yuan dynasty, the Chaoyangmen Guanxiang area during the Ming and Qing dynasties and the Republic of China. During the Qing dynasty the road was paved. 

Over the years, many temples were built along Chaoyangmenwai Street, among them the Tianxian Temple (built during the Ming dynasty, destroyed), Jiutian Puhua Palace (built 1647 during the Qing dynasty), Dongyue Temple (built in the Yuan dynasty), and Ci Zun Temple (destroyed). Dongyue Temple is located in the central section of Chaoyangmenwai Street.

=== 20th–21st century ===
In 1942 the road was repaved. After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the asphalt pavement was widened and refurbished in 1953. In 1988, a large-scale expansion and reconstruction was carried out. In 1990 the street was extended eastward to the East Third Ring Road and was connected to Chaoyang Road.

In the 1950s, the east and west arches on Chaoyangmenwai Street were demolished. Since the 1950s, Dongyue Temple was occupied by a unit of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. In 1988, the gates facing Chaoyangmenwai Street were dismantled, thus making the bell tower, the drum tower and the two doors directly face each other. After renovation in 1998, it was opened as a Beijing Folk Museum. In 2008, Dongyue Temple was restored as a place of religious activity. Since then, it has the dual functions of museum and Taoist temple.

Office buildings and retail along Chaoyangmen Outer Street received a major boost in 1996 when China opened its Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this arterial. Other high rises that were built along Chaoyangmen Outer Street include: China Life Tower, Chaoyangmenwai Soho, Guangyao Apartment Tower, Guoan Mansion, Jingguang Centre, and the World Financial Center. Beijing&#x27;s new CBD is developing to the south of Chaoyangmenwai Street.

==Attractions==
* The famous Beijing Dongyue Temple (built and developed 1319 and onwards) is located along Chaoyangmen Outer Street. It is a national cultural spot of China and hosts the Beijing Folk Customs Museum.
* Pfidang or Memorial archway, a glazed tile archway opposite Dongyue Temple&#x27;s Sun Gate, on the south side of Chaoyangmen Outer Street and at the entrance of Shenlu Street.

<doc id="1026889" wikidata="Q275470" url="?curid=1026889" title="William of York">
<text>William of York (late 11th century – 8 June 1154) was an English priest and twice Archbishop of York, before and after a rival, Henry Murdac. He was thought to be related to King Stephen of England, who helped to secure his election to the province after several candidates had failed to gain papal confirmation. William faced opposition from the Cistercians, who after the election of the Cistercian Pope Eugene III, had William deposed in favour of a Cistercian, Murdac. From 1147 until 1153, William worked to be restored to York, which he achieved after the deaths of Murdac and Eugene III. He did not hold the province long, dying shortly after his return, allegedly from poison in the chalice he used to celebrate Mass. Miracles were reported at his tomb from 1177. He was canonised in 1226.

==Early life==
Born William fitzHerbert in York, William was the son of Herbert of Winchester, or Herbert fitzAlberic, chancellor and treasurer of King Henry I. Most sources say his mother was Emma, half-sister of King Stephen and Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and that she was an illegitimate daughter of Stephen II, Count of Blois, Stephen&#x27;s father. New research, however, suggests that Emma may have been a daughter of Hunger fitzOdin, who held lands in Dorset in the Domesday survey. William was born sometime before the 1090s, but the date is unknown.

William held the prebendary of Weighton in the diocese of Yorkshire between 27 June 1109 and 24 February 1114. Sometime between 1109 and 1114 he was appointed Treasurer of York. He was also appointed archdeacon of the East Riding of Yorkshire at an unknown date between 1125 and 1133. The influence of his rich and powerful father, who had many landholdings in Yorkshire, may have been of benefit in gaining him these offices at a relatively early age. William apparently held both of these offices until his election as Archbishop. Serving under Archbishop Thurstan of York, William became involved in Thurstan&#x27;s dispute with King Henry I after Henry demanded that the Archbishops of York accept subordination to the Archbishops of Canterbury. William accompanied Thurstan into exile in Europe and on embassies to the papal court. Reconciliation with Henry allowed a return to York in 1121. A papal ruling in favour of the independence of the Archbishops of York was finally delivered in 1127.

==Election problems==
In January 1141 William was elected Archbishop of York. Originally, the cathedral chapter of York had elected Waltheof in 1140, but that election was set aside, as one of Waltheof&#x27;s supporters had made an uncanonical gift (bribe) to secure Waltheof&#x27;s election. Then Henry of Blois tried to secure the see for Henry de Sully, another nephew of Stephen and Henry&#x27;s. Sully&#x27;s election was opposed by Pope Innocent II, who refused to confirm him as Archbishop while he remained Abbot of Fécamp. Only at a third election in January 1141 was William chosen. Whether he had been a candidate in the previous two elections is unknown.

The election was opposed by the Cistercian monasteries of Yorkshire and by the archdeacons of York. The Cistercians opposed on the grounds that the Second Lateran Council in 1139 had given the religious houses of a diocese the right to participate in electing the bishop. Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, refused to recognise William&#x27;s election due to allegations of simony (acquisition of church positions by bribery), and of interference by King Stephen. In 1143, Pope Innocent II ruled that William could be confirmed in office if he swore under oath that the allegations were false. After he swore the oath, Henry of Blois, who was also papal legate, found William innocent, and he was consecrated as archbishop on 26 September 1143.

==First archiepiscopate and deposition==

As Archbishop, William undertook several ecclesiastical reforms and became popular with the people of York. However, he still needed a pallium, the sign of an archbishop&#x27;s authority from the Pope, which he had not yet received. The Cistercians, who were still adamantly opposed to his being Archbishop, were determined to prevent his receiving it. William travelled to Rome in an attempt to obtain the pallium. The election of Pope Eugene III, a Cistercian, in 1145, was a setback for his cause. Bernard of Clairvaux, the famous Cistercian abbot and religious leader, exerted all his influence to ensure William&#x27;s suspension, sending a series of complaints to the new Pope that William had been intruded by secular powers into the see, that he was oppressing the Cistercian monasteries and that he had irregularly appointed William of St. Barbara as Dean of York. In the winter of 1145–1146 Eugene re-examined the case, declared that William had not been validly consecrated and suspended him from office. William was required to obtain an in-person refutation of the old charges by William of St Barbara, by then the Bishop of Durham.

While awaiting the final decision in his case, William took up residence with one of his friends, Roger II, King of Sicily. Hearing of his suspension, some of William&#x27;s supporters in York launched a damaging attack on Fountains Abbey, which destroyed many of the buildings. William was formally deposed by Eugene in early 1147 and the deposition was confirmed at the Council of Reims on 21 March 1148. Another election to York was held, and the candidates included Hilary of Chichester, who was the king&#x27;s candidate, and Henry Murdac, the Cistercian abbot of Fountains Abbey. Murdac&#x27;s supporters included the Cistercians and most of the clergy of the diocese, including William&#x27;s former ally, William of St Barbara. Both sides appealed to the Pope, and the Pope confirmed Murdac as the successful candidate. William then returned to Winchester, the city he had left 40 years earlier to begin his career in York.

==Second archiepiscopate==
King Stephen refused to accept William&#x27;s deposition and the appointment of Murdac, and prevented Murdac from taking up residence in York. Stephen probably wished to trade recognition of Murdac for support for his son Eustace, whose coronation as his successor he was trying to secure during his own lifetime, to defeat rival claims to the throne by Henry of Anjou. Within a few years both Murdac and the Pope had died and William travelled to Rome to plead with the new Anastasius IV for restoration to office. The Pope concurred and William&#x27;s reappointment was confirmed on 20 December 1153. On his return to York, while crossing the Ouse Bridge in York in triumphal procession, the bridge collapsed, but no one was killed.

==Death and sainthood==

After less than a month back in York, William died on 8 June 1154, allegedly due to poison administered in the chalice at Mass. One of William&#x27;s clerks accused Osbert de Bayeux, an archdeacon of York, of the murder, and Osbert was summoned before the king to be tried at the royal court. Stephen died before the trial could take place. William was buried in York Minster and within a few months of his death, miracles were attributed to his intervention and a sweet smell came from his tomb when it was damaged during a fire. Nor was the body decayed or burnt. Pope Honorius III then ordered an investigation into the miracles and canonized him in Rome in 1226.

William&#x27;s feast day is marked on 8 June, the day of his death. Although his veneration was largely localised in York, among his devotees was Margery Kempe (1373–1438) of King&#x27;s Lynn in Norfolk, who &quot;cried copiously&quot; before his tomb. Traditional iconography and windows often depict William&#x27;s crossing of the Tweed; some iconography shows him crossing in a boat. William&#x27;s coat of arms is blazoned: &quot;Or, seven mascles Gules, 3, 3 and 1&quot;. This actual shield at one time hung on the west wall of St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church, Bognor Regis.

An extant church in Sheffield (in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hallam) was dedicated to St William in 1932.

===St William&#x27;s College===

St William&#x27;s College, which was named for him is next to York Minster. It was established between 1465 and 1467 with the permission of King Edward IV as the home for chantry priests of the Cathedral.

===St William&#x27;s Chapel===
A chapel to St William was built in York in the later 12th century. It was placed on the northern edge of the Ouse Bridge to mark a miracle associated with the collapse of the bridge when William returned to York in 1154. It remained as a functional chapel until 1550. The chapel was removed during the renovation of the bridge between 1810 and 1818.

===Shrines===
The earliest shine to St William in York Minster dates to the c. 1220s in which William&#x27;s sarcophagus was buried into the floor and a shrine structure erected above it - this left the lid of the sarcophagus proud of the structure to be accessible to pilgrims. In 1284 Bishop Bek paid for the translation of William&#x27;s body to a new shrine in the choir behind the high altar; no trace of the shrine has been recorded. There is evidence of two larger shrines in York Minster – one at his tomb site and the other a separate, principal, shrine.

The tomb shrine was built on the site of William&#x27;s original burial place in the eastern-most bay of the nave; it comprised a large stone or marble slab five or six feet in height supported by a series of decorative arches (four on the longer sides, two on the shorter) with an upper stage of decoration rising above it. The whole structure stood at least in height. It was decorated with small statues in niches throughout and each of the four corner spandrels depicts imagery associated with the Four Evangelists.

The latest, principal shrine, located near the Minster&#x27;s High Altar was built in 1471-1472 and probably designed by Robert Spillesby, the master mason of the Minster from 1466-1473. This later shrine was in the Perpendicular Gothic style made from a darker marble than the rest of the Minster and comprised a large marble pedestal on which a reliquary of William was placed and covered by a wooden canopy.
It was , wide and long.

There is no evidence of large scale pilgrimage to William&#x27;s shrines. However, numerous panels from the stained glass window in the Minster depict petitioners and worshippers at the shrines. A lead ampulla found in York and depicting an archbishop on one side has been argued to represent Saint William. The upper face of William&#x27;s sarcophagus has been worn smooth, probably from the hands of pilgrims touching it. In the 1890s Catholic pilgrims who were part of the Guild of Our Lady of Ransom pilgrimage through York were given permission to kiss the shrine.

On 22 September 1541 the Privy Council met in York and ordered the Archbishop to demolish all of the shrines in his province. William&#x27;s shrines were taken apart and buried at Precentor&#x27;s Court. In 1715 Ralph Thoresby reported that he had acquired some architectural fragments in marble which had been &#x27;enclosed betwixt two walls and in a private House&#x27; from Precentor&#x27;s Court. These were probably the first rediscoveries of fragments of St. William&#x27;s shrines. Several fragments from 18th century interventions at or near this house were later discovered spread around York including in the gardens near Clifford&#x27;s Tower and used as domestic furniture. Further discoveries of shrine fragments from Precentor&#x27;s Court were made in 1882-1883 and 1927-1928. Fragments of both later and earlier shrines were discovered during each excavation.

The sarcophagus containing William&#x27;s remains was rediscovered in 1732 and again in 1968, at which point they were removed. His remains are now held in a shrine in the crypt at York Minster. Parts of the shrines are now in the Yorkshire Museum. This is the only example of a saint&#x27;s shrine in a museum collection in England.

<doc id="1026898" wikidata="Q215831" url="?curid=1026898" title="Fabricio Coloccini">
<text>Fabricio Tomás Coloccini (; ; born 22 January 1982) is an Argentine former professional footballer who played as a centre-back.

Coloccini began his club career at Boca Juniors in his native Argentina attracting the attention of A.C. Milan. He failed to establish himself there and was loaned to four clubs. After making his reputation at Deportivo La Coruña he joined Newcastle United in August 2008 and, in July 2011, was promoted to club captain. In April 2012 he was named in the PFA Team of the Year. On 5 July 2016, Coloccini returned to Argentina to join San Lorenzo, with whom he had previously played fifteen years ago. After four more seasons with the club, he transferred to Aldosivi, where he spent his last season as a player before retiring at the age of 40.

At international level, Coloccini represented Argentina on 39 occasions between 2003 and 2014, scoring one goal, and was a member of the teams that reached the finals of the 2004 Copa América and the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup; he also took part at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. At youth level, he was a member of the sides that won 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship, and the gold medal at the 2004 Olympics.

On April 1, 2022, Coloccini was announced as the new Venezuela U-20 manager.

==Club career==
===Boca Juniors===
Born in Córdoba, Córdoba Province, Coloccini started his career in the youth team of Argentinos Juniors, but made his professional debut in 1998 with Boca Juniors. He made one league appearance, as a starting line-up, in his one and only season with Boca. He played in Walter Samuel&#x27;s position, who received a call-up from the Argentina national team. Coloccini scored in his only match, leveling the scores in a 2–2 draw with Unión de Santa Fé.

=== AC Milan===
In December 1999, at the end of the &quot;Apertura&quot; championship, Coloccini moved to AC Milan. He was at the centre of a controversy between Boca and Milan, because the transfer from Argentina to Italy was not agreed between the clubs. Instead, Milan arranged terms with Coloccini&#x27;s father (also a former football player), who exercised his parental rights to remove the minor from Argentina. After that, FIFA ordered Milan to pay Boca compensation.

On 22 January 2000, less than a month since moving to Italy, Coloccini turned 18 and joined AC Milan&#x27;s senior team that at the time also featured a number of his fellow countrymen and national team players, namely Roberto Ayala, Andrés Guglielminpietro, and José Chamot, the latter of whom joined the club in the same transfer window. Despite manager Alberto Zaccheroni&#x27;s preference for formations with three center backs and a lack of undisputed starters other than the team&#x27;s captain Paolo Maldini, Coloccini did not make his debut for Milan during that season. He also stayed with the first team for first half of the 2000–01 season before going back to Argentina on loan.

====Loan moves====
In January 2001, Coloccini was loaned to San Lorenzo where he helped the team to win the 2001 &quot;Clausura&quot; tournament. From 2001 to 2004, Coloccini served three consecutive loans in &quot;La Liga&quot;: Alavés (netting six league goals), Atlético Madrid, and Villarreal, where he was always first-choice.

===Return to Milan and Deportivo La Coruña===
Ahead of the 2004–05 season, Coloccini returned to AC Milan. Despite facing fierce competition in central defense from Paolo Maldini, Alessandro Nesta, Jaap Stam, Kakha Kaladze, Alessandro Costacurta, and Dario Šimić, Coloccini still managed to make 5 appearances across all competitions before submitting a winter transfer request.

Coloccini joined Deportivo La Coruña in January 2005, on a six-year deal. During his three-and-a-half-season stint, he was an undisputed starter, and appeared in all the matches during 2007–08 netting four goals, good enough for a UEFA Intertoto Cup berth for the club.

===Newcastle United===

Coloccini joined Newcastle United on a five-year contract in August 2008 for a fee of up to £10.3 million. Two days later, he made his debut against the reigning league champions, Manchester United, playing 90 minutes in a 1–1 away draw.

Since his debut, Coloccini was one of the most consistent inclusions in Newcastle&#x27;s squad, and formed a partnership with fellow newcomer Sébastien Bassong in his first season. He was not immune to the pressures of representing Newcastle&#x27;s infamous defence, coming under his most intense criticism for his performance in Newcastle&#x27;s 5–1 defeat to Liverpool. Despite his mistakes in the game, manager Joe Kinnear voiced his support for Coloccini, stating that he believed his &quot;Mr. Reliable&quot; would bounce back. On 1 February, Coloccini was substituted against Sunderland in the 93rd minute. Up until this point, he had played every minute of every game for Newcastle all season. He was dropped for the 1–1 draw with Stoke City, but played in Newcastle&#x27;s 1–0 defeat to Aston Villa, which saw them relegated.

Despite Newcastle&#x27;s relegation, Coloccini stayed on and was the mainstay of the club&#x27;s defence all season, partnering the likes of Steven Taylor, Mike Williamson, Fitz Hall and Tamás Kádár in the sturdiest rearguard of the championship. He scored two goals for Newcastle since relegation, a header at Cardiff City, and another header at Watford. The club was eventually promoted back to the Premier League as champions, and Coloccini&#x27;s great contributions awarded him a place in the Championship&#x27;s Team of the Year. Coloccini scored his third Newcastle goal against Wigan Athletic in the fourth minute of injury time as they came from two goals down to draw 2–2 at St James&#x27; Park, with that being his first goal in the Premier League on the same day that he captained Newcastle for the first time. Coloccini scored a striker&#x27;s finish in a 1–1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur on 22 January 2011, the day of his 29th birthday and his 100th Newcastle appearance.

He continued his fine form for Newcastle into April, reforming his partnership with Mike Williamson after a brief time with Steven Taylor in January. On 2 April, Coloccini made numerous forward runs and forward roaming to help supply Peter Løvenkrands&#x27; goal in the 4–1 win over Wolves. Manager Alan Pardew, along with pundit Jamie Redknapp complimented the defender for his contributions to the team&#x27;s attack, calling him a &quot;top, top player&quot;.
On 8 July 2011, Coloccini was named Newcastle captain for the 2011–12 season. He and Taylor rekindled their partnership and were central to one of the Premier League&#x27;s meanest defences, conceding a mere eight goals in the first 11 games. He scored his first goal of the season in the 122nd minute to win the game against Championship club Nottingham Forest in a 4–3 thriller in the third round of the League Cup that saw Forest equalise on three occasions. In October, he was selected for the North East Football Writers&#x27; Association Player of the Year for 2011. On 22 April 2012, Coloccini was named in the PFA Team of the Year. After an impressive display in the Tyne–Wear derby against Sunderland in October, Pardew was so impressed with the way Coloccini played that he said the performance was just like watching England legend Bobby Moore.

In January 2013, Coloccini stunned Newcastle by asking for a transfer back to Argentina citing personal reasons. His preference was to move to the team he helped win the 2001 &quot;Clausura&quot;, San Lorenzo. However, San Lorenzo could not afford his wages or the transfer fee Newcastle would want, as he still had four years left on his contract. After lengthy talks with club officials and manager Alan Pardew, Coloccini decided to stay at St James&#x27; Park until the end of the 2012–13 season and then decide on where his future lies. On 16 June 2013, Coloccini confirmed that he was staying at Newcastle until the end of the 2013–14 season at least, after lengthy talks with Pardew. Coloccini also praised Newcastle as a club, saying that they had done everything possible to make him stay. On 1 November 2014, Coloccini made his 200th league appearance for Newcastle, in the 1–0 win over Liverpool at St James&#x27; Park. Eight days later, he scored his first goal in three years, with a header in Newcastle&#x27;s 2–0 away win over West Bromwich Albion.

In July 2015, Coloccini was linked with a move to Crystal Palace to link up with former manager Alan Pardew on a permanent deal. This was later publicly dismissed by Pardew, in a statement released on 5 August 2015. On 6 August, Coloccini ended speculation about his future by penning a one-year contract extension until the end of the 2016–17 season, with the option of a further year beyond that.

===San Lorenzo===
On 5 July 2016, Coloccini mutually agreed with Newcastle that his contract would be terminated, with him signing for Primera División side San Lorenzo that same day.

==International career==
Coloccini was part of the Argentina Under-20 that won the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship, as well as the gold medal winning Argentina team at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

With the Argentine senior squad, he made his international debut on 30 April 2003, in a 3–1 friendly win over Libya, in Tripoli. The following year, he was a member of the team that reached the final of the 2004 Copa América, only to lose to Brazil 4–2 on penalties, following a 2–2 draw. He scored his only international goal on 4 September 2004, in a 3–1 away win over Peru, in Lima, in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier. He later participated in the 2005 Confederations Cup, where Argentina once again finished as runners-up to Brazil following a 4–1 defeat in the final.

At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Coloccini played in two games, as a substitute against the Netherlands, and starting against hosts Germany in the quarter-finals, which ended in a 5–3 penalty shootout loss following a 1–1 draw. Coloccini was an unused substitute in Argentina&#x27;s World Cup qualifier against Brazil on 6 September 2009. He was absent from the national team in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Due to his great form throughout 2012, Coloccini was recalled to the Argentina squad under new manager Alejandro Sabella for the FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Paraguay and Peru in September 2012. Coloccini played the full 90 minutes in a 5–2 win over Paraguay on 10 September, a game which sealed Argentina&#x27;s place in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

==Style of play==
As a defender, Coloccini was known for his physical strength, consistency, experience, fearless challenges, stamina, and in particular, his ability in the air, which made him a goal-threat from set-pieces in the opposing penalty area. Although he normally played as a centre-back, he was also deployed as a right-back on occasion. Regarded as a promising defender in his youth, he was named one of the 100 best young footballers in the world by &quot;Don Balón&quot; in 2001.

<text>The Darden School of Business is the graduate business school of the University of Virginia, a public research university in Charlottesville, Virginia. The school offers MBA, PhD, and Executive Education programs. 

The school was founded in 1955 and named after Colgate Whitehead Darden Jr., a former Democratic congressman, governor of Virginia, and president of the University of Virginia. It is located on the grounds of the University of Virginia. Its faculty use the case method as their method of teaching courses. 

==History==

The Darden School is a graduate school of business of the Southern United States, it was founded in 1955. The original business school was nestled in the central grounds of the University of Virginia, before being moved its current location at the North Grounds. Designed by the Driehaus Prize winner Robert A. M. Stern, the Darden school&#x27;s buildings feature sand-struck Virginia brick, Chippendale balustrades and red-metal standing seam roofs. In 2018, the Sands Family Grounds was inaugurated by the Darden School, in Arlington County, Virginia, in proximity to Washington D.C.&#x27;s central business district. The Sands Family Grounds occupy the top two floors of a 31-story skyscraper..

== Locations ==
The full-time MBA program is located in Charlottesville, Virginia at the UVA Darden Goodwin Family Grounds, which is roughly two hours from Washington, D.C.

In 2017, it was announced that Darden would establish dedicated facilities in Rosslyn, formerly introduced as the UVA Darden Sands Family Grounds in February 2019, as the new home base for the Executive MBA formats and new M.S. in Business Analytics degree launched with the McIntire School of Commerce.

<text>The ADI Bumble Bee (sometimes Hollmann Bumble Bee) is an ultralight gyrocopter marketed by Aircraft Designs Inc (ADI). It was the first of its kind when it flew in 1983 and is still available in plans form for homebuilding.

It was designed by Martin Hollmann after a back injury (sustained in the crash of the ADI Condor) prevented him from flying his previous design (the ADI Sportster) on account of not being able to lift the rotor assembly.

==Design and development==
The Bumble Bee is a simple and lightweight design that can be built to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules, including the category&#x27;s maximum empty weight of . The aircraft has a standard empty weight of .

The aircraft consists of an open frame based on a keel tube, which supports the nose wheel at the front and the tail at the back. The pilot&#x27;s seat, the engine and rotor assembly are bolted to the same keel tube. A control stick cyclically controls rotor pitch angle. The powerplant specified is a , twin-cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled, single ignition Rotax 447 mounted in pusher configuration. The Kawasaki 440 engine has also been used. The landing gear is of tricycle configuration, uses plastic-spoked wheels to reduce weight and does not include suspension. A horizontal tailplane maintains the aircraft pitch angle in flight and a large fin and rudder is provided. The main rotor system is of low-inertia and requires pilot skill to manage energy on landing.

The aircraft plans cost US$160 in 2001. Construction time is estimated as 400 hours, much of which is consumed fabricating the composite rotor blades.

<doc id="1026914" wikidata="Q930309" url="?curid=1026914" title="Jamal Mashburn">
<text>Jamal Mashburn Sr. (born November 29, 1972) is an American entrepreneur and former professional basketball player. Nicknamed &quot;the Monster Mash&quot;, Mashburn was a prolific scorer as a small forward in his 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), with a career scoring average of 19.1 points per game.

==Early life and college career==
Mashburn was born to Bobby, a former heavyweight boxer and New York City police officer, and Helen Mashburn. His father retired in 1974 and then lived separately from Helen and his son Jamal, divorcing after about 10 years.

Mashburn learned the game at Rucker Park, just a block away from where he grew up.
After attending Cardinal Hayes High School in The Bronx, Mashburn had a very successful basketball career in college, playing for the University of Kentucky. He was the fourth-leading career scorer for the Wildcats and a consensus First Team All-American by his junior year, in which the Wildcats made it to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament. Following the tournament he declared for the 1993 NBA draft, with Mashburn being selected by the Dallas Mavericks with the fourth pick.

==Professional career==

===Dallas Mavericks (1993–1997)===
The Mavericks were a lottery team led by veteran point guard Derek Harper and second year guard Jim Jackson, and Mashburn quickly shared the reins of the offense, averaging 19.2 points a game in 73 starts and earning a selection to the first NBA All-Rookie Team. Despite this the Mavericks could only manage 13 wins for the 1993–94 season. In the off-season, the team drafted star point guard Jason Kidd, teaming up with Jackson and Mashburn to become known collectively as &quot;The Three J&#x27;s.&quot; The Mavericks would improve to 36 wins in the 1994–95 season, as Mashburn averaged 24.1 points a game (sixth in the league), while placing fifth in the league in free throw makes (447), seventh in made field goals (683), and fifth in total points (1,926). The season also featured a 50-point performance by Mashburn on November 12 against the Chicago Bulls in Chicago. This made him the fourth-youngest player to score 50 points in an NBA game (Brandon Jennings is the youngest). He also broke many franchise records and blossomed into one of the best scoring forwards in the league. Despite the team&#x27;s improvement they were unable to make the playoffs, and injuries would force Mashburn to only play 18 games in the 1995–96 season.

Mashburn started in just 21 games of the Mavericks&#x27; first 37 games of the 1996–97 season, and on February 14, 1997, he was traded to the Miami Heat in exchange for Kurt Thomas, Predrag Danilović and Martin Müürsepp.

===Miami Heat (1997–2000)===
Miami was a loaded team led by all-stars Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway and coached by Pat Riley. The addition of Mashburn boosted the team&#x27;s offense, and the team finished the season with a franchise best 61 wins with Mashburn averaging 13.4 points in 30 starts. In the playoffs the Heat defeated the Orlando Magic in a difficult 5 games in the first round, followed by a grueling seven-game series win against the New York Knicks. Miami made its first ever Conference Finals against the defending champion Bulls, and would lose the first three games of the series before managing a win in Miami in game four, with Mashburn scoring 17 points. The Bulls proved too much for the Heat and won the series in the fifth game in Chicago. Mashburn averaged 10.5 points in his first postseason.

Injuries limited Mashburn to 48 games in the 1997–98 season, but he started in each game he played and averaged 15.1 points a game as Miami won 55 games before losing in a five-game first round series to the Knicks. Mashburn started in 3 of the games and saw his production slip. The following season would be shortened to 50 games due to a league lockout, and injuries again limited Mashburn to just 23 starts with averages of 14.8 points a game with 6.1 rebounds a game. Miami captured the best record in the Eastern Conference, but once again lost in the first round to New York, as Mashburn averaged 10 points in the five-game series.

The 1999–2000 season featured an improvement statistically for Mashburn, as he shouldered more of the offensive load and averaged 17.5 points a game including a career high 112 three point field goals. The Heat won 52 games before sweeping the Detroit Pistons in the first round of the playoffs in three games. This set up another rematch with New York, as the Heat and Knicks battled in another grueling seven-game series. Despite scoring in bunches in the Heat&#x27;s victories, including a 21-point performance in game 5, Mashburn&#x27;s scoring dropped off in the final two games of the series, and the Knicks once again eliminated Miami at home. Following another disappointing playoff run for the team, Mashburn and teammate P. J. Brown were traded to the Charlotte Hornets for Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason.

===Charlotte Hornets (2000–2002)===
In his first season in Charlotte, Mashburn averaged 20.1 points, 7.6 rebounds and 5.4 assists in 76 games. Led by his play and the play of Baron Davis, the Hornets won 46 games and faced Miami in the first round of the playoffs. While his former team was favored to win the series, Mashburn averaged 23.7 points, as the younger Hornets shocked the Heat and swept them in three games. Next up were the Milwaukee Bucks, who took a two-game lead before the Hornets won game three in Charlotte led by Mashburn&#x27;s 36 points and game four, in which Mashburn scored 31. Despite managing to win three straight games, the Bucks responded to win the last two games and the series. Mashburn averaged a career high 24.9 points in the 2001 playoffs.

The 2001–02 season once again featured injury problems for Mashburn, and he only played in 40 games averaging 21.5 points per game. The Hornets made the playoffs and defeated Orlando before losing to the New Jersey Nets, but Mashburn&#x27;s injury woes kept him out of the postseason. The Hornets would go on to relocate to New Orleans after the season ended.

===New Orleans Hornets (2002–2005)===
Mashburn&#x27;s best overall NBA season took place in the 2002–03 season, and he played in all 82 games averaging 21.6 points per game. He played in his first and only All-Star game, scoring 10 points in the 2003 NBA All-Star Game in Atlanta, won the Eastern Conference Player of the Month award in March and made the All-NBA Third Team. The season also featured some high scoring games for Mashburn, including a 50-point performance against Memphis on February 21 and a 40-point game against Orlando on March 26. The Hornets won 47 games and faced the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the playoffs, but Mashburn played in only four games of the series due to a finger injury. In the deciding Game 6 loss on May 2, 2003, Mashburn led the Hornets in scoring with 36 points while adding five assists.

Mashburn continued his stellar play in the 2003–04 season, but injuries plagued him for most of the year and he managed to play in only 19 games. He was later unable to participate in the 2004 playoffs. Bothered by problems with his right knee (patella femoral irritation), he decided to sit out the 2004–05 season in hopes that his knee would recover. He had microfracture surgery performed on his knee, a risky surgery that not all players have been able to recover from.

===Retirement===
Despite his decision to sit out the year due to his knee, the Hornets still traded Mashburn, along with Rodney Rogers, to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for forward Glenn Robinson on February 24, 2005. Mashburn was never able to recover from his chronic knee problems and never saw court time for Philadelphia. He was on the injured list for all of the 2004–05 season and the inactive list for 2005–06. On March 24, 2006, the 76ers waived Mashburn, who subsequently announced his retirement from the NBA. He had career averages of 19.1 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.0 assists per game.

Mashburn, who averaged 20.8 points per game in 2003–04, is one of only six players since 1970 to have averaged at least 20 points per game in his final NBA season. The other five are Jerry West (20.3 in 1973–74), Larry Bird (20.2 in 1991–92), Dražen Petrović (22.3 in 1992–93), Reggie Lewis (20.8 in 1992–93), and Michael Jordan (20.0 in 2002–03).

==Post-basketball career==
Since retiring from basketball, Mashburn has worked for ESPN as an analyst and launched a number of successful business ventures. As of 2018, he owned over 90 businesses, including 34 Outback Steakhouse franchises, 37 Papa John&#x27;s franchises, and a number of car dealerships across the state of Kentucky. Mashburn is a partner in Ol Memorial Stable, along with former Kentucky coach Rick Pitino and Outback Steakhouse co-founder Chris T. Sullivan, which owns Kentucky Derby prospect Buffalo Man.

==Personal life==
Mashburn has lived in Miami since his retirement. In 2017, he and his wife divorced after a 17-year marriage. Their son, Jamal Jr., attended the Gulliver Prep before transferring to Brewster Academy. A 4-star recruit out of high school, Jamal Jr. played college basketball for Minnesota for a year, followed by 3 years at New Mexico. Jamal Jr. was coached by Richard Pitino at both Minnesota and New Mexico. Jamal Jr. was a graduate transfer to Temple University for his last year of eligibility in 2024-2025.

<text>The 2002 [[Major League Soccer]] [[MLS SuperDraft|SuperDraft]] was held on February 10, 2002 in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.

One month earlier, MLS had contracted two clubs: Tampa Bay Mutiny and Miami Fusion. In conjunction with the contraction, the league conducted both an allocation draft and a dispersal draft in which the top 2002 SuperDraft picks of Tampa Bay and Miami, as well as players from those clubs, were made available to remaining MLS clubs.

==Allocation draft==
MLS distributed the players of the Miami Fusion and the Tampa Bay Mutiny to the rest of the league via an allocation draft that took place on January 11, 2002, where teams with excess allocations were allowed to select from their players; the participants and the selection order for the draft were announced three days before the draft was conducted.
===Trades===
==Dispersal draft==
Players who were not selected in the allocation draft were automatically assigned to the dispersal draft, which was held hours after the allocation draft occurred.

<text>Neil Stanley &quot;Stan&quot; Alves, OAM (born 22 May 1946) is a former Australian rules football player and coach.

== Playing career ==
===Melbourne===
Alves played 226 games and kicked a total of 160 goals for the Melbourne Football Club from 1965 until 1976. captaining them from 1973–1976 and finishing runner-up for the Brownlow Medal in 1975. 

===North Melbourne===
Alves joined North Melbourne in 1977. Legend has it that he chose to play for North Melbourne rather than Collingwood based on a coin toss. It proved to be a wise decision as North Melbourne met Collingwood in the 1977 Grand Final and, after initially playing a 76-all draw, won the replay 151–124. 

Alves played 40 games for North Melbourne and kicked a total of 14 goals from 1977 until 1979 before retiring from his playing career.

== Coaching career ==

===St Kilda Football Club senior coach (1994-1998)===

Alves became senior coach of St Kilda in 1994, when he replaced Ken Sheldon. In the 1994 season, St Kilda under Alves finished 13th on the ladder out of 15 teams in a disappointing season. The following 1995 season, St Kilda once again under Alves had another disappointing season as they finished 14th out of 16 teams. St Kilda won the 1996 pre-season competition. In the 1996 season, St Kilda under Alves had another disappointing season, after a promising pre-season competition to find itself finished 10th after round 22. St Kilda won just 10 games for the season.

Alves however went on to coach St Kilda in the 1997 season to finish as runners up and first grand final in 26 years in 1997, where St Kilda under Alves lost to Adelaide by thirty-one points in the 1997 AFL Grand Final. This earned Alves the AFL Coach of the Year award. In the 1998 season, St Kilda under Alves had a great start winning 11 of its first 14 games, but unfortunately an end of season drop of form saw St Kilda drop down the ladder. St Kilda again qualified for the Finals Series finishing sixth. In the 1998 Finals Series, St Kilda were eliminated by Melbourne In the semi-final. At the end of the 1998 season, Alves was sacked as St Kilda Football Club senior coach. Alves was then replaced by Tim Watson as St Kilda Football Club senior coach.

== Awards ==
On 24 October 2000, Alves was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australian football. On 26 January 2008, Alves was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for &quot;service to Australian Rules football as a player, coach and commentator, and to the community as a supporter of charitable organisations&quot;.

<doc id="1026935" wikidata="Q671103" url="?curid=1026935" title="Shorewall">
<text>Shorewall is an open source firewall tool for Linux that builds upon the Netfilter (iptables/ipchains) system built into the Linux kernel, making it easier to manage more complex configuration schemes by providing a higher level of abstraction for describing rules using text files. Its documentation is hosted on shorewall.org, while the latest code is hosted at https://gitlab.com/shorewall/code.

== Configuration ==
It is not a daemon since it does not run continuously, but rather configures rules in the kernel allowing and disallowing traffic through the system. Shorewall is configured through a group of plain-text configuration files and does not have a graphical user interface, though a Webmin module is available separately. A monitoring utility packaged with Shorewall can be used to watch the status of the system as it operates and to assist in testing.

== Use==
Shorewall is mainly used in network installations (as opposed to a personal computer firewall), since most of its strength lies in its ability to work with &quot;zones&quot;, such as the DMZ or a &#x27;net&#x27; zone. Each zone would then have different rules, making it easy to have for example relaxed rules on the company intranet, yet clamp down on traffic coming in from the Internet.

The plain-text configuration files are usually well-commented and easy to use, though Shorewall may be more difficult for new users to handle than other firewall systems with graphical front-ends.

== History ==
Starting with version 4, Shorewall began using a Perl-based compiler frontend; previously it used a shell-based compiler frontend. Support for IPv6 firewalling is included since version 4.2.4.

On 18 February 2019, primary developer Tom Eastep announced that he is retiring from the project, and 5.2.3 would be his final release. Management of the Shorewall project was handed over to a Shorewall committee who would manage the future direction of the Shorewall project. Tom Eastep however continues to be a major contributor to the Shorewall project as of September 2020.

<text>The ADI Stallion is a US civil utility aircraft that first flew in July 1994. It is marketed in kit form for homebuilding by Aircraft Designs Inc.

==Design and development ==
The Stallion is a single-engined high-winged monoplane, with wings based on those of the Lancair ES and a retractable tricycle landing gear from the Lancair IV. It has a steel-tube fuselage center section, with the remainder of the airframe of composite construction, and is designed to be powered by engines of 230–350 hp (172–261 kW). The recommended engine is the Continental IO-550, but engines as powerful as the Walter M601 have been used. It is available in two versions, the four seat ADI Stallion and the six-seat Super Stallion.

==Operational history==
Seven examples had been completed and flown by December 2007.

<text>HP calculators are various calculators manufactured by the Hewlett-Packard company over the years.

Their desktop models included the HP 9800 series, while their handheld models started with the HP-35. Their focus has been on high-end scientific, engineering and complex financial uses.

== History ==
In the 1960s, Hewlett-Packard was becoming a diversified electronics company with product lines in electronic test equipment, scientific instrumentation, and medical electronics, and was just beginning its entry into computers. The corporation recognized two opportunities: it might be possible to automate the instrumentation that HP was producing, and HP&#x27;s customer base were likely to buy a product that could replace the slide rules and adding machines that were being used for computation.
With this in mind, HP built the HP 9100 desktop scientific calculator. This was a full-featured calculator that included not only standard &quot;adding machine&quot; functions but also powerful capabilities to handle floating-point numbers, trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentiation, and square roots.

This new calculator was well received by the customer base, but William Hewlett saw additional opportunities if the desktop calculator could be made small enough to fit into his shirt pocket. He charged his engineers with this exact goal using the size of his shirt pocket as a guide. The result was the HP-35 calculator. This calculator provided functionality that was revolutionary for a pocket calculator at that time.

Through the years, HP released several calculators that varied in their mathematical capabilities, programmability, and I/O capabilities. Some of them could be used (via HP-IL) to control the instruments other Hewlett Packard divisions produced.

On 1 November 2021, Moravia Consulting spol. s r.o. (for all markets but the Americas) and Royal Consumer Information Products, Inc. (for the Americas) became the licensees of HP Development Company, L.P. to continue the development, production, distribution, marketing and support of any HP-branded calculators.

== Characteristics ==
HP calculators are well known for their use of reverse Polish notation (RPN).

Programmable HP calculators allow users to create their own programs.

== Calculators ==
Below are some of HP&#x27;s handheld calculator models produced over the years:

<text>Wilbert Rideau (born February 13, 1942) is an American convicted killer and former death row inmate from Lake Charles, Louisiana, who became an author and award-winning journalist while held for 44 years at Angola Prison. Rideau was convicted in 1961 of first-degree murder of Julia Ferguson in the course of a bank robbery that year, and sentenced to death. He was held in solitary confinement on death row, pending execution. After the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that states had to rework their death penalty statutes because of constitutional concerns, the Louisiana Court judicially amended his sentence in 1972 to life in prison.

During his 12 years on death row, Rideau had begun to educate himself, by reading numerous books. After being returned to the general prison population, from 1975 Rideau served for more than 20 years as editor of &quot;The Angolite&quot;, the magazine written and published by prisoners at Louisiana State Prison (Angola); he was the first African-American editor of any prison newspaper in the United States. Under his leadership, the magazine won the George Polk Award and Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for its reporting, and it was nominated for others.

Rideau appealed his case four times. The Supreme Court of the United States and lower courts ordered a total of three new trials; SCOTUS overturned his conviction and ordered a new trial because of adverse pre-trial publicity. He was convicted again of murder two more times, in 1964 and 1970, each time by all-male, all-white juries. He served more than 40 years in the State Penitentiary; parole was never approved. In 2005 Rideau was tried a fourth time. He was unanimously convicted by the jury of the lesser charge of manslaughter; they did not believe he had planned the killing. Rideau was sentenced to the maximum of 21 years; as he had already served nearly 44 years, he was freed.

A &quot;Life&quot; magazine article in March 1993 referred to Rideau as &quot;the most rehabilitated prisoner in America.&quot; He has written several books and edited compilations of articles. He participated in making two documentaries, including &quot;The Farm: Angola, USA&quot; (1998), about the lives of six men at Angola, including himself. It was drawn from his memoir &quot;Life Sentences&quot; (1992) and much of the film was made at the prison.

==Childhood==

Wilbert Rideau was born in Louisiana in 1942. When he was six, his family moved to Lake Charles, Louisiana (a city in Calcasieu Parish in the west of the state. It is about 30 miles from the Texas border). He attended racially segregated public schools, according to state law: Second Ward Elementary School in the lower grades, and starting at W. O. Boston High School when he was in eighth grade. 
Rideau was 19 when he committed an armed bank robbery in Lake Charles in 1961. He forced three white workers: Julia Ferguson, Dora McCain, and Jay Hickman into a car and drove away with them as hostages. He lined them up and shot at them six times. Ferguson and McCain fell to the ground. When Ferguson tried to get up, he stabbed her with a hunting knife. In the course of their trying to escape, Rideau fatally shot and stabbed bank teller Julia Ferguson, shot Dora McCain in the neck, and kicked her in the ribs, breaking one. The survivors testified to Rideau&#x27;s guilt, noting that Rideau first shot Ferguson and then plunged a knife into the woman&#x27;s chest and neck, and also shot and kicked Dora McCain, while saying &quot;You&#x27;d better be dead.&quot; McCain and Hickman survived by pretending to be dead. 

==Trials and imprisonment==
Before Rideau was arraigned, a local television news station, KPLC-TV, filmed his being interviewed by the parish sheriff at the jail. Rideau responded to leading questions and admitted to killing teller Julia Ferguson in the course of a robbery. He did not appear to know he was being filmed, and he was without counsel. This material was broadcast three times in Calcasieu Parish, exposing a large part of the population to the interview and confession before Rideau was arraigned or taken to trial.

The defense requested a change of venue because of possible influence of the broadcast on potential jury members, which the court denied. Rideau was tried in 1961 before an all-male, all-white jury. At this time, blacks in Louisiana were still largely disenfranchised: excluded from voting, they were also excluded from juries and political office. He was convicted in less than an hour of first-degree murder in the death of teller Julia Ferguson. The jury included &quot;two deputy sheriffs, a cousin of the dead victim and a bank vice president who knew the wounded manager&quot;. Rideau was sentenced to death, which is the punishment for first-degree murder.

His 1961 conviction was ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court. In &quot;Rideau v. Louisiana&quot; (1963), the court ruled that the adverse pre-trial publicity and failure by the lower court to grant a change of venue had compromised his receiving due process. The majority decision said, &quot;Yet in this case the people of Calcasieu Parish saw and heard, not once but three times, a &quot;trial&quot; of Rideau in a jail, presided over by a sheriff, where there was no lawyer to advise Rideau of his right to stand mute.&quot; The court overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial.

The District Attorney of Calcasieu Parish, Frank Salter, Jr., reindicted Rideau for the killing of Ferguson. In 1964 another all-male, all-white jury quickly convicted Rideau again of first-degree murder. That conviction was overturned by appeal, and Rideau was tried a third time in 1970. Rideau was convicted a third time of first-degree murder by an all-white jury.

He was returned to death row at Angola, where he was held in solitary confinement pending his execution. During this time, he became determined to become educated. He started reading widely, and credits books with helping him survive and become a better person.

In 1972, following the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, finding the current state laws unconstitutional as they varied widely in how they administered the death penalty, the court ordered states to void the death sentences of persons on death row. They ordered their sentences to be amended to the next most severe level, generally life imprisonment. Some 587 men and 26 women were moved off death rows across the country. Rideau&#x27;s sentence was amended by Louisiana to life in prison.

Rideau was moved into the general prison population. After another appeal, based on the exclusion of blacks from the grand jury that had indicted him in 1970, despite passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s to end racial discrimination, Rideau&#x27;s last conviction was vacated. 

A new trial was ordered and he was tried a fourth time in 2005. The jury was made up of ten women and two men, seven whites and five blacks. They deliberated for nearly six hours before reaching a unanimous decision, convicting him of the lesser charge of manslaughter. The judge sentenced him to the maximum of 21 years. Since Rideau had already served more than twice that time, nearly 44 years, he was freed immediately.

==Legal history of the case==
Rideau&#x27;s criminal case reached the Supreme Court on appeal. In &quot;Rideau v. Louisiana&quot;, 373 U.S. 723 (1963), the court made a landmark ruling related to the effects of adverse pre-trial publicity and the refusal of the court to agree to a change of venue, which it ruled was a denial of due process of law for the defendant. The Court overturned Rideau&#x27;s 1961 conviction because of the repeated broadcasts by the local television station of the sheriff&#x27;s &quot;interview&quot; with Rideau in jail, and with no counsel. The Court said this resulted in &quot;Kangaroo Court proceedings&quot; and a kind of public trial in the media before his case ever reached court. In addition, the Parish Court had refused the defense attorney&#x27;s request for a change of venue. The Supreme Court ordered a new trial.

Rideau was retried by the Parish District Attorney for first-degree murder in 1964 and again convicted. After another appeal because of errors, he was retried in 1970; each of those convictions for first-degree murder were also by all-male, all-white juries. He remained on death row at Angola.

In 1972 the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; that state laws for the death penalty were unconstitutional as currently written. States were ordered to judicially amend death sentences to the next level of severity, generally life imprisonment. Rideau and hundreds of other persons (mostly men) on death row across the country had their death sentences changed to life imprisonment.

In 2000, a federal appeals court ruled that Rideau&#x27;s original indictment was flawed, because blacks had been excluded from the 1961 grand jury, which had indicted him on first-degree murder charges. (These charges were repeated by the prosecutor in subsequent trials.)

The Lake Charles, Louisiana, community divided largely along racial lines for four decades over the Rideau case. The parole board had repeatedly recommended he be given parole, but two Louisiana governors declined to approve it, largely due to strong local pressure from whites in Calcasieu Parish. In the fourth and final trial in January 2005, most white spectators sat behind the prosecutor&#x27;s table and most blacks sat behind the defense.

Rideau had always admitted robbing the bank, fleeing with hostage employees, and killing one of them. Attorneys in the final trial presented two versions of these events. The prosecution held that Rideau used premeditation to line up his victims before shooting them, and that Ferguson had begged for her life. The defense said that Rideau had panicked and reacted impulsively - first, when a phone call interrupted the robbery, and then when hostage Dora McCain jumped from the get-away car and ran, followed by the other two employees. He said that Rideau killed in panic rather than by premeditation. The defense urged a verdict of manslaughter. The jury unanimously convicted Rideau of manslaughter, and the judge sentenced him to the maximum of 21 years. As Rideau had already served more than twice that long, he was immediately freed.

==Prison journalism==
In the early 1970s, Rideau wrote a column, &quot;The Jungle&quot;, for a chain of black weeklies in Louisiana. He freelanced articles to mainstream media, including the &quot;Shreveport Journal&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot;. A headline referred to him as &quot;The Wordman of Angola&quot;, saying &quot;Rideau is Angola Penitentiary&#x27;s Birdman of Alcatraz. He is a prisoner who has transformed the dark, drab, terror-filled life of prison into a greenhouse for the flowering of his talent.&quot;

Rideau had not gone beyond the ninth grade in his formal education before his arrest and incarceration. He educated himself by extensive reading while in prison.

In 1975, a federal court ordered the Angola prison to be reformed, the result of a civil suit by the ACLU because of the high level of violence and abuse of prisoner rights. The consent decree required the prison to institute desegregation of programs and work assignments. The outgoing warden appointed Rideau as editor of &quot;The Angolite&quot;; he was the first African-American editor of any prison journal in the United States. The incoming warden ratified the choice and, with a handshake, gave Rideau freedom from censorship. This warden&#x27;s progressive administration supported the nation&#x27;s only uncensored prison publication. During his 25 years as editor, Rideau became well known nationally, gaining a reputation beyond the prison.

In 1979, Rideau and co-editor Billy Sinclair won the George Polk Award for the articles &quot;The Other Side of Murder&quot; and &quot;Prison: The Sexual Jungle&quot;. In addition, the magazine won the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award, the American Bar Association&#x27;s Silver Gavel Award, and a 1981 Sidney Hillman Award. &quot;The Angolite&quot; was the first prison publication ever to be nominated for a National Magazine Award, and it was nominated seven times.

Rideau was permitted to travel the state accompanied only by an unarmed guard to lecture about the prison newspaper. He was permitted to fly to Washington, D.C. twice to address the nation&#x27;s newspaper editors on the subject of prison journalism.

Rideau and co-editor Ron Wikberg were named &quot;Person of the Week&quot; for their journalism on Peter Jennings&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight&quot; in August 1992. Wikberg was the &quot;Angolite&quot; associate editor from 1988 to 1992 (he was paroled that year). He died in October 1994.

==Books and compilations==
After being released, Rideau wrote &quot;In the Place of Justice: A Story of Punishment and Deliverance&quot; (2010), recalling his experiences in Angola. It won the 2011 Dayton Literary Peace Prize and was shortlisted for the British CWA Gold Dagger prize for non-fiction.

With Ron Wikberg, associate editor, Rideau edited &quot;The Wall Is Strong: Corrections in Louisiana&quot; (1991), used as a textbook. This textbook was a compilation of magazine and newspaper articles, and papers from the Center for Criminal Justice Research of University of Southwestern Louisiana. About half of the book&#x27;s articles were first published in &quot;The Angolite&quot;. Rideau and Wikberg collaborated on the book with Professor Burk Foster of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

Rideau and Wikberg also collaborated on &quot;Life Sentences: Rage and Survival Behind Bars&quot;, a 1992 anthology of articles from &quot;The Angolite&quot;. It was published in 1992 by Times Books, a subsidiary of Random House, but went out of print.

This book came to the attention of Elizabeth Garbus and Jonathan Stack, a pair of New York documentary filmmakers. They drew from it for their film &quot;The Farm: Angola, USA&quot; (1998). Rideau was credited for his work with them on the film; he was also among the six men featured in the documentary, which has won numerous awards.

==Other media==
In the 1990s, Rideau branched out into radio, television, and documentary film making. He became a correspondent for National Public Radio, produced a segment for ABC-TV&#x27;s newsmagazine &quot;Day One&quot;; and collaborated with radio documentarian Dave Isay for a piece entitled &quot;Tossing Away the Keys.&quot;

He collaborated on creating and producing two documentary films, &quot;Final Judgment: The Execution of Antonio James&quot; (1996), directed and produced by filmmakers Jonathan Stack and Elizabeth Garbus, and &quot;The Farm: Angola, USA&quot; (1998), directed by the same pair, with credit also to Rideau. The latter drew from &quot;Life Sentences&quot;, the book which he and the late Ron Wikberg had edited together. &quot;The Farm&quot; won an Emmy Award and several others, as well as being as nominated for an Academy Award.

==Clemency efforts==
&quot;Mother Jones&quot; said in 2010 that &quot;a mix of racial politics and tough-on-crime posturing blocked [Rideau&#x27;s] release for more than three decades&quot;, even though several LSP wardens had said that Rideau was completely rehabilitated. The parole board recommended parole for him, but two governors declined to approve it. Many local people in Calcasieu Parish opposed any parole for him. Rideau remained incarcerated through the mid-1990s, while other inmates with similar sentences were paroled in this period.

An investigation by &quot;20/20&quot; revealed statements by Governor of Louisiana Edwin Edwards, who said that he believed that Rideau was rehabilitated, but that he would not release him &quot;under any circumstances&#x27;. Rideau said that governors did not advocate for his release because he had become &quot;a political football&quot; due to his appeals and retrials. He believed that it would be difficult for any prisoner in Louisiana to be released from prison.

==Fourth appeal, trial, and aftermath==
In 1998 the Legal Defense Fund of the NAACP joined his case and participated in mounting a fourth appeal. In December 2000, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans threw out Rideau&#x27;s 1970 murder conviction, based on grounds of racial discrimination in the grand jury process in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, which had indicted him. All the members of the grand jury were white.

To the surprise of many outside the area, the Calcasieu Parish prosecutor decided to try Rideau for a fourth time for first-degree murder. Rideau was indicted again in July 2001. The jury, composed of both men and women, and blacks and whites, unanimously found him guilty of manslaughter. They did not believe that he had planned the killing of the clerk. The judge sentenced Rideau to the maximum of 21 years, but he had already served nearly 44, more than twice that, so he was released. Whereas Rideau had been represented by local court-appointed defense attorneys in his first three trials, his defense team in 2005 included prominent civil rights attorneys: Johnnie Cochran, George Kendall, and famed New Orleans defense attorney Julian Murray, who all worked on the case for free, or &quot;pro bono&quot;.

The retrial was prosecuted under the laws in effect at the time of the crime in 1961. The jury was free to convict Rideau of murder – the state elected to prosecute under the &quot;specific intent&quot; rather than the &quot;felony murder&quot; doctrine of the 1961 statute – or manslaughter, which in Louisiana is any homicide that would otherwise be murder if it is either committed without specific intent to harm an individual, or if it is committed in the heat of passion. The defense said that Rideau had become panicked during the robbery and especially by the hostages attempting to escape.

Shortly after Rideau&#x27;s release, Judge David Ritchie, who had declared Rideau indigent at trial, ordered him to pay more than $127,000 to the court to cover the cost of the trial that ultimately freed him. This order was overturned in 2006 by the Louisiana Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

The Louisiana Court of Appeals stated:
::[ . . . ] we find the trial court lacked legal authority to act for the parish of Calcasieu and lacked standing &quot;in its own right&quot; to seek recoupment of funds expended from the Criminal Court Fund. The trial court, however, retains authority to enforce the January 15, 2005 sentence which ordered Rideau to pay costs and to assess reasonable costs upon presentment by the parties who actually &quot;incurred&quot; the Article 887(A) expenses, consistent with this opinion and the Constitutions of Louisiana and the United States. We also vacate that portion of the March 15, 2005 Order directing Rideau to reimburse the IDB [Indigent Defender&#x27;s Board] for all costs, expert witness fees and expenses associated with his defense.

==After release==
In 2008 Rideau married Linda LaBranche, a former college professor who had become one of his supporters years before.

In 2009, he co-directed and was included in the documentary &quot;The Farm: 10 Down&quot; (2009), Jonathan Stack&#x27;s follow-up to the survivors among the six men he had featured in his earlier film on Angola. Rideau was the only one among them to have left the prison alive.

Since his release, Rideau has continued to write. He published a memoir, &quot;In the Place of Justice: A Story of Punishment and Deliverance&quot; (2010), about his years at Angola. He has frequently been asked to speak about his experiences, and his work to rehabilitate himself while in prison.

In 2011 Rideau was one of the invited speakers at the Newark Peace Education Summit in Newark, New Jersey. In April of that year, he was invited to the Roosevelt Hotel to receive the George Polk Award for journalism and give a long overdue speech. He had won the journalism award in 1980 for a series of essays titled &quot;The Sexual Jungle&quot;, which he published in &quot;The Angolite&quot; when he was still in prison.

<text>The rufous-bellied seedsnipe (Attagis gayi) is a bird in suborder Scolopaci of order Charadriiformes, the shorebirds. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The rufous-bellied seedsnipe shares its genus with the white-bellied seedsnipe (&quot;A. malouinus&quot;). They and the other two seedsnipes are closely related to the sandpipers of family Scolopacidae. It has three subspecies, the nominate &quot;A. g. gayi&quot;, &quot;A. g. latrelillii&quot;, and &quot;A. g. simonsi&quot;. At least one publication has suggested that &quot;A. g. latrelillii&quot; might deserve to be recognized as a species.

The rufous-bellied seedsnipe&#x27;s specific epithet commemorates the French naturalist Claude Gay.

==Description==

The rufous-bellied seedsnipe is long and weighs about . The sexes are alike. The nominate subspecies&#x27; upperparts have an intricate scallop pattern of rufous-brown and blackish; its underparts are unmarked pale pinkish cinnamon. Subspecies &quot;A. g. latrelillii&quot; has a deeper rufous cinnamon than the nominate in its vent area and a scalloped breast. &quot;A. g. simonsi&quot;s breast is a darker pinkish cinnamon than the nominate&#x27;s; it is paler above with finer markings. Juveniles much resemble adults but with somewhat finer markings on their upperparts.

==Distribution and habitat==

Subspecies &quot;A. g. latrelillii&quot; of rufous-bellied seedsnipe is found far from the other subspecies, on seven high volcanoes in north-central Ecuador. &quot;A. g. simonsi&quot; is found from central Peru south through northern Chile and western Bolivia into northwestern Argentina. The nominate &quot;A. g. gayi&quot; is found from north central Chile and west central Argentina south almost to Tierra del Fuego.

The rufous-bellied seedsnipe inhabits alpine terrain in the Andes, often as high as the snow line. It frequents boggy and other moist areas but also occurs in drier and rockier landscapes. Subspecies &quot;A. g. latrelillii&quot; is typically found in &quot;páramo&quot;. In the northern half of its range it mostly is found between . Further south it occurs down to and in the extreme south as low as .

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The rufous-bellied seedsnipe is essentially non-migratory, though southern populations are thought to move to lower elevation in the austral winter. It is a strong flier and when flushed flies in a fast zigzag.

===Feeding===

The rufous-bellied seedsnipe feeds on plant matter, typically in moist areas, but details of its diet are lacking.

===Breeding===

Little is known about the rufous-bellied seedsnipe&#x27;s breeding biology. It lays eggs during September and October in Chile; further north the season extends to December. Its nest is a shallow scrape in the ground and the clutch size is typically four eggs.
===Vocalization===

The rufous-bellied seedsnipe frequently calls when flying and also while running; its call is &quot;a melodic-sounding &#x27;gly-gly-gly...&#x27; or &#x27;cul-cul-cul...&#x27;&quot; which several birds may make simultaneously.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the rufous-bellied seedsnipe as being of Least Concern. It has a very large range, and though its population size is not known it is believed to be stable. No immediate threats have been identified. It occurs in several protected areas and is considered generally fairly common except in Ecuador. However, it is persecuted in some mining areas.

<text>The Pays d&#x27;Auge (, literally &quot;Land of Auge&quot;) is an area in Normandy, straddling the &quot;départements&quot; of Calvados and Orne (plus a small part of the territory of Eure). The chief town is Lisieux.

==Geography==
Generally it consists of the basin of the Touques River.

The Pays d&#x27;Auge is divided into the following cantons: Canton of Cabourg, Canton of Dozulé, Canton of Trouville Deauville, Canton of Honfleur, Canton of Troarn, Canton of Cambremer, Canton of Pont-l&#x27;Évêque, Canton of Blangy-le-Château, Canton of Mézidon-Canon, Canton of Lisieux, Canton of Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives, Canton of Livarot, Canton of Orbec, Canton of Trun, Canton of Vimoutiers, Canton of Exmes and Canton of Gacé.

==Economy==
The landscape of this area is considered typical of Normandy—agricultural and producing dairy produce and apples. It is noted for its cheeses, especially Camembert (named for a place in Pays d&#x27;Auge), Livarot and Pont-l&#x27;Évêque, also names of villages.

The Pays d&#x27;Auge has been granted &quot;appellation contrôlée&quot; status for its cider and calvados.

==Culture==
The Norman dialect of the Pays d&#x27;Auge is known as Augeron. The Pays d&#x27;Auge is classed as a Land of Art and History by the national Ministry of Culture.

<text>Victoria has the highest density of roads of any state in Australia. Unlike Australia&#x27;s other mainland states, which have vast areas with virtually no residents, Victoria has population centres spread out over most of the state, with only the far north-west and the Victorian Alps without significant settlements. Population centres are linked by high quality highways and freeways. The state capital, Melbourne, has the most extensive freeway network of any city in Australia.

VicRoads is responsible for road planning, motor vehicle registration, and driver licensing in Victoria. The Victorian government has set up a framework for the integration of transport facilities in the State. Two private companies operate toll roads in the state.

Roads in Victoria are shared by a multitude of modes of transport, ranging from trucks to bicycles, public buses, trams, taxis as well as private cars of all types. Road safety is a primary concern of road authorities, including the police and government. Victoria was the first jurisdiction in the world to introduce compulsory seat belt legislation. Other measures introduced are drunk driving laws and speed cameras. Victorian road laws are constantly reviewed. The number of road fatalities has declined over the past decade in line with the rest of the country.

==History==
Melbourne was founded in 1835. In 1837, Robert Hoddle laid out a road plan for the new town, which is commonly referred to as the Hoddle Grid. His plan covers the area from Flinders Street to Queen Victoria Market, and from Spencer Street to Spring Street. Since then the grid has been extended, as the town stretched out along the tram and rail lines, often with stretches of open country in between.

===Highways===
Victoria has the highest density of highways of any state in Australia. Unlike Australia&#x27;s other mainland states, where vast areas are very sparsely inhabited, Victoria has population centres spread out over most of the state, with only the far north-west and the Victorian Alps without permanent settlement. Highways connect these population centres.

Highways generally radiate from Melbourne and other major cities and rural centres with secondary roads connecting the highways to each other. These highways provide links for state and interstate freight, personal travel and tourism, and most routes have higher traffic than most other states. Highways such as Hume Highway, Western Highway and Princes Highway have some of the heaviest traffic in Australia.

Many of the highways are built to freeway standard (&quot;M&quot; freeways), while most are generally sealed and of reasonable to high quality.

===Urban freeways===
In the 1950s and 1960s, private ownership of cars increased, and newer suburbs were created beyond the tram and rail networks. This eventually led to congestion on the road network between the suburbs and the CBD.

As Melbourne extended, planners and politicians decided that the roads could no longer cope. The 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan called for construction of an extensive network of freeways. The Victorian government were advised by American highway planners and it sent its road engineers to the United States. The resulting network is the most extensive in Australia.

Unlike many American cities, Melbourne had an extensive public transport network and opposition to the plan grew, arguing that money is better spent on public transport upgrades, particularly to areas of Melbourne poorly served by public transport such as the outer east. This led to clashes including the showdown in 1977, over the plan to build the F19 freeway through Collingwood and Fitzroy. In the fiercest battle, groups of protesters such as the Carlton Association barricaded Alexandra Parade. Although the resulting Eastern Freeway was finally built, many road projects were shelved and freeway construction was suspended until the mid-1990s. One notable exception was the Monash Freeway, which was constructed under the John Cain Labor government. The party had a policy of no new freeways, but the road was desperately needed to link the existing Mulgrave and South-Eastern freeways. The result was a multi-lane highway with traffic lights at several major intersection. This created traffic congestion, the road being dubbed Melbourne&#x27;s longest carpark. It was eventually upgraded to freeway standard, and incorporated into the Monash Freeway.

Freeway construction resumed in the 1990s, with the construction of the Western Ring Road, CityLink and others. Most of these freeways are expected eventually to join in a continuous and extensive network. Most recently, the M11 Peninsula Link was opened in 2013, to join the 2 halves of the unfinished Mornington Peninsula Freeway.

===Impact of road transport in Melbourne===
Where they were built, population growth followed, as Melburnians moved away from the crowded inner and middle suburbs to cheaper outer suburbs; for example, Monash Freeway and Mornington Peninsula Freeway led to explosive growth of population in the south east and the Mornington Peninsula. The completion of Western Ring Road spurred housing growth in the western suburbs.

==Safety==
===Notable multiple fatality incidents===
*23 March 2007 – Burnley Tunnel – 3 deaths, 3 injuries – 10 car pile-up, 400 evacuated
*17 January 2010 – Mill Park, Melbourne – 5 deaths, 1 injured – 1 car split a tree in half

2010 it was announced by the State Government that trucks would be banned from the right-hand lane along a 38-kilometre section of the Princes Freeway between Geelong and Melbourne. Suggestions of a ban began in 2005 but increased after the fatal 2007 Burnley Tunnel fire that killed three people. The ban was put into place from 1 July 2010 between Kororoit Creek Road, Altona, and Avalon Road, Lara and covers all heavy vehicles weighing more than 4.5 tonnes, except buses and caravans. A fine of $358 applies to those breaking the rules, the ban being a trial before a full roll-out on the other major roads in the state.

==Names and numbering==

Victorian highway naming is straightforward. Most highways are named after the geographical regions and features, cities, towns and settlements along the way. Some are even more straightforward e.g., Western and Northern Highways that radiate westwards and northwards from Melbourne. Notable exceptions include some interstate highways and some metropolitan highways, for example, Hume Highway.

The Victorian road numbering system for freeways and arterial roads consists of a letter and a number. The letter is determined by the quality and function of the route, the system contains four &#x27;levels&#x27; of roads: M roads, A roads, B roads and C roads:
*M Roads provide consistently high quality road conditions and are always divided dual or more carriageways. M roads are the primary transport links between Melbourne and other capital cities or provincial centres. For example, the Eastern Freeway and EastLink make up the route with the official designation of the M3.
&lt;br&gt;
Bicycles (cyclists) are prohibited from Urban Freeways in Melbourne, however are permitted on Rural Freeways including sections within Melbourne&#x27;s outer urban limits. Signs at the start of freeway entry ramps indicate whether pedestrians/bicycles are allowed (&quot;NO Pedestrians, Bicycles, etc Beyond This Point, On This Freeway, Except With Authority&quot;).
Bicycles must stay in the left-hand shoulder (Emergency Stopping Lane) and upon interchanges follow the signed &quot;Cyclists Cross Here With Care&quot; at right angles on exit ramps, giving way to vehicles exiting, cross to the adjacent bullnose, to continue their journey. Cyclists must also obey signs indicating &quot;Cyclists Must Exit&quot; / &quot;Cyclists Banned&quot; / &quot;No Bicycles Beyond This Point&quot; where bicycles must exit at that ramp, then dismount, due to the freeway prohibiting bicycles downstream of that location, such as the freeway turning from a Rural into an Urban Freeway. 
The following are classified as Urban Freeways where cyclists are not permitted:
*West Gate Fwy
*Monash Fwy
*South Gippsland Fwy
*Frankston Fwy
*Mornington Peninsula Fwy
*Eastern Fwy
*Princes Fwy (east of Werribee)
*Princes Fwy East (west of Pakenham)
*Tullamarine Fwy
*Calder Fwy (east of Kings Rd)
*Hume Fwy (south of Donnybrook Rd)
*Western Ring Rd
*Metropolitan Ring Rd
*Western Fwy (east of Ballarat Rd)
*CityLink
*EastLink
*Peninsula Link
*West Gate Tunnel/Western Distributor (under construction)
*North East Link (under construction)
&lt;br&gt;
The following are classified as Rural Freeways where cyclists are permitted:
*Princes Fwy (west of Duncans Rd, Werribee)
*Princes Fwy East (east of Koo Wee Rup Rd, Pakenham)
*Hume Fwy (north of Donnybrook Rd, Kalkallo)
*Calder Fwy (west of Kings Rd, Taylors Lakes)
*Goulburn Valley Fwy
*Western Fwy (west of Ballarat Rd, Ravenhall)
&lt;br&gt;
While the Frankston Fwy, Mornington Peninsula Fwy and Peninsula Link are not technically in &#x27;urban&#x27; areas, considered outer suburban or regional, these major arterials are classified as Urban Freeways, due to their closer proximity to Melbourne, larger populations, built up areas and higher traffic volumes. Where cyclists would pose a risk of danger from vehicles, including traffic movements such as weaving and merging at junctions and ramps. Therefore bicycles are not permitted on these freeways.

*A Roads serve the same purpose and provide the same high quality road conditions as M roads, the only difference being that A roads are single carriageways. A Roads also carry less traffic than M roads. For example, the Princes Highway west of Geelong is route number A1.
*B Roads are sealed roads wide enough to accommodate two lanes of traffic with good line markings, provide adequate shoulders and high quality and visibility signage. B roads are the primary transport links for regions not connected by either M or A roads, as well as major tourist routes, such as the Great Ocean Road (route number B100).
*C Roads are generally sealed two-lane roads with shoulders and serve as links between population centres and the major road network. For example, the Mount Dandenong Tourist Road is route number C415.

The Victorian road numbering system is based on a &#x27;ring and spoke&#x27; system. The &#x27;ring&#x27; highways (highways that circle Victoria) numbers are given in the multiple of hundreds e.g. Henty Highway (200), Murray Valley Highway (400) and Great Alpine Road (500) make the outermost ring. Midland Highway (300) and Maroondah Highway (300) is the inner ring.

The spokes generally incorporate National Route numbers. Otherwise, east-west aligned highways are given even numbers and north-south are given odd numbers. Highways and primary roads are given numbers in multiple of tens. Other roads are given other numbers that indicate general alignment.

Essentially, for freeways and arterial roads, of which VicRoads is the coordinating authority, the letter drawn from the quality and purpose of the route is added to the number as determined by the ring and spoke system to give a highway number that reflects the quality and alignment of the road.

== Legislation and governance ==
The prime transport statute in Victoria is the &quot;Transport Integration Act 2010&quot;. The Act establishes and sets the charters of the state agencies charged with integrating and coordinating the state&#x27;s transport system and, as part of that activity, providing roads, managing network access and providing registration and licensing services. The Act establishes the Department of Transport as the agency responsible for the overall integration and planning of Victoria&#x27;s transport system. In addition, the Act creates Victoria&#x27;s key road agency, the Roads Corporation or VicRoads.

An important road regulation statute is the Road Management Act 2004, which regulates the management of Victoria&#x27;s road network. The key statute that regulates Victoria&#x27;s road safety is the Road Safety Act 1986.

Responsibility for road maintenance in Victoria is distributed. VicRoads maintains main roads, including secondary roads, while local government councils maintain local roads. There are also private roads. The federal government takes its own interest in national highways, and other roads of national interest, such as those that impact foreign trade.

<text>A synthetic catalytic scavenger is an artificial anti-oxidant that has been demonstrated to extend cellular life. It was successful in &quot;C. elegans&quot; and was effective in rat trials. Studies have shown that synthetic catalytic scavengers have superoxide dismutase and catalase activities which prevented injuries from reactive oxygen species, helping promote the livelihood of tissues.

<text>The Whole Ten Yards is a 2004 American crime comedy film directed by Howard Deutch and starring Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Amanda Peet, Kevin Pollak and Natasha Henstridge. It is a sequel to the 2000 film &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot;. It was based on characters created by Mitchell Kapner, who was the writer of the first film.

The film was released on April 7, 2004, in the United States. Unlike the first film, which was rated R and was a commercial success despite receiving mixed reviews, &quot;The Whole Ten Yards&quot; received a PG-13 rating and was a critical and commercial failure.

== Plot ==
Thanks to falsified dental records supplied by his former neighbor Nicholas &quot;Oz&quot; Ozeransky, retired hitman Jimmy &quot;The Tulip&quot; Tudeski spends his days compulsively cleaning his house and perfecting his culinary skills with his wife, Jill, a purported assassin who has yet to pull off a &quot;clean&quot; hiteveryone she is hired to kill dies in bizarre accidents before she has a chance. Oz now owns a dental practice in California and has married Jimmy&#x27;s ex-wife Cynthia and are expecting their first child, but the relationship is strained by Oz&#x27;s excessive paranoia as well as Cynthia&#x27;s secret continued contact with Jimmy.

Their lives are further complicated by the return of Laszlo Gogolak, Jimmy&#x27;s former mob boss and father figure, whose son Janni was killed by Jimmy and Jill while Laszlo was in prison. Having deduced that Jimmy faked his death, Laszlo abducts Cynthia and threatens Oz to try to learn Jimmy&#x27;s location, but Oz escapes. A desperate Oz contacts Jimmy and Jill, but Jimmy refuses to help until Laszlo&#x27;s men attack, having followed Oz to Jimmy.

Capturing Laszlo&#x27;s remaining son Strabovitz, Jimmy offers to trade Strabo for Cynthia. Oz triggers further conflict between Jimmy and Jill when he reveals Jimmy still wears a crucifix from Cynthia. At a bar, Jimmy becomes increasingly depressed at his failure to father a child with Jill, and aggravates Oz by discussing his and Cynthia&#x27;s old sex life, culminating in Oz and Jimmy becoming so drunk that they wake up in the same bed.

Frustrated by her poor sex life with Jimmy, Jill attempts to seduce Oz but is interrupted by Jimmy, who knocks Oz out and regains his passion for Jill and his work as the two have sex in the bathroom. Re-arming themselves at Oz&#x27;s house, the three are attacked by an unknown marksman and Strabo is killed in the crossfire. Jimmy insults Jill’s capabilities and coldly dismisses Oz; Jill leaves. Oz retreats to his practice where he is met by Jimmy, who apologizes for recent events. The two are chloroformed by Oz&#x27;s new receptionist Julie, revealed to be the sister of Frankie Figgs, seeking revenge for Oz and Jimmy&#x27;s role in her brother&#x27;s death.

Waking up beside Cynthia and Jimmy in Laszlo&#x27;s apartment, Oz is shocked to learn that the entire situation has been planned by Jimmy and Cynthia to find Laszlo&#x27;s half of the first dollar he ever stole, which he had torn and divided between Jimmy and Janni as kids. As Laszlo prepares to kill them, Jill arrives, having tied up Strabo&#x27;s body in her car with explosives to appear alive, and threatens to detonate unless Laszlo releases Oz and Cynthia. Asking to join Laszlo&#x27;s organization, Jill is ordered to kill Jimmy, who tells her she&#x27;ll never be a successful hitter before she shoots him in the heart.

Jill&#x27;s car explodes as Laszlo&#x27;s men try to release Strabo, revealing Jill was in on the plan and shot Jimmy with blanks. Jules is exposed as the shooter who killed Strabo, and Laszlo shoots her. Jimmy, unable to kill the man who raised him, has Jill shoot Laszlo in the foot. Jimmy and Cynthia further reveal that Laszlo&#x27;s half of the dollar combines with Jimmy’s to reveal the number for a $280 million bank account. Jill reveals she is pregnant, and the four drive away as Laszlo is arrested.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
In December 2002, it was announced Franchise Pictures was in production with a sequel to &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; titled &quot;The Whole Ten Yards &quot; with both Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry returning.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
Unlike the first film, which was a commercial success, &quot;The Whole Ten Yards&quot; was a box office bomb, bringing in only $16.3 million in North America and $9.8 million internationally. With a worldwide total of $26.2 million, less than a quarter the gross of the original, the film did not recoup its $40 million budget.

===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In Matthew Perry&#x27;s memoir &quot;Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing&quot;, the actor stated that this film&#x27;s disappointing reception drastically curtailed his film career writing, &quot;That was the moment Hollywood decided to no longer invite Mr. Perry to be in movies”. He sought more dramatic roles afterward.

<text>Stanley Livingstone Baxter (born 24 May 1926) is a Scottish actor, comedian, impressionist and author. Baxter began his career as a child actor on BBC Scotland and later became known for his British television comedy shows &quot;The Stanley Baxter Show&quot;, &quot;The Stanley Baxter Picture Show&quot;, &quot;The Stanley Baxter Series&quot; and &quot;Mr Majeika&quot;.

Baxter has also written a number of books based on Glasgow.

==Early life==
The son of an insurance manager, Baxter was born in Glasgow, Scotland on 24 May 1926. He was educated at Hillhead High School, Glasgow, and schooled for the stage by his mother. He began his career as a child actor in the Scottish edition of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;. Following employment in mining as a Bevin Boy in World War II, he developed his performing skills further during his national service with the British Army&#x27;s Combined Services Entertainment unit, working alongside comedy actor Kenneth Williams, actor Peter Vaughan, film director John Schlesinger and dramatist Peter Nichols, who used the experience as the basis for his play &quot;Privates on Parade&quot;.

After the war, Baxter returned to Glasgow taking to the stage for three years at Glasgow&#x27;s Citizens&#x27; Theatre. Following success on the radio with Jimmy Logan, Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd invited him to star in pantomime at the Theatre Royal in Glasgow followed by the Half Past Eight Shows, and their successors the Five Past Eight Shows at Glasgow&#x27;s Alhambra Theatre. He moved to London to work in television in 1959.

In 1969, Baxter performed in the original production of Joe Orton&#x27;s then controversial farce &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in the West End with Sir Ralph Richardson, Coral Browne and Hayward Morse. Baxter nurtured the stage careers of Alyson McInnes and John Ramage. Baxter remained a great favourite on the Scottish pantomime circuit, especially at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Glasgow, up until his retirement in 1992. He starred, in pantomime, with popular Scottish stars, Jimmy Logan and Una McLean.

==Radio==
During the 1960s, Baxter had his own show on BBC Radio Scotland. In 1994, he returned to radio, taking the role of Noël Coward in the BBC World Service Play of the Week, &quot;Marvellous Party&quot; directed by Neil Cargill. Written by Jon Wynne-Tyson, it also starred Dorothy Tutin as Coward&#x27;s lifelong friend, Esme Wynne-Tyson (Jon&#x27;s mother). Also with Cargill, he read &quot;Whisky Galore&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Swan – The Joy Traveller&quot; for BBC Radio, providing the voices of all the characters.

After a lengthy spell in self-imposed retirement, Baxter appeared in 2004 in a series of four half-hour radio sitcoms for BBC Radio 4, entitled &quot;Stanley Baxter and Friends&quot;; the success of this has led to further series entitled &quot;The Stanley Baxter Playhouse&quot; in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2016, and &quot;Two Pipe Problems&quot; with Richard Briers in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Two further plays in this series were broadcast in 2013 with Geoffrey Palmer taking the Richard Briers role. In 2009 Eddie Izzard presented &quot;The Stanley Baxter Story&quot; on BBC Radio 2. A further series of &#x27;Playhouse&#x27; commenced airing on BBC Radio 4 in November 2018.

==Television==
Baxter was known for his impressions of famous people, particularly The Queen (referred to in the context of the shows as &#x27;the Duchess of Brendagh&#x27;). &quot;The Stanley Baxter Show&quot; ran between 1963 and 1971 on BBC One, and &quot;The Stanley Baxter Picture Show&quot; from 1972 to 1975 on ITV; the six-part &quot;Stanley Baxter Series&quot; was made by LWT in 1981. Eight one-hour TV specials were made by LWT and the BBC between 1973 and 1986.

Baxter guest-starred in an episode of &quot;The Goodies&quot; and later appeared in the lead role in &quot;Mr Majeika&quot;, developed from the books by Humphrey Carpenter, a children&#x27;s show about a magic teacher, expelled from Walpurgis (the wizard land) for failing his professional examinations. He later stated that he had wanted to retire after his spectacular hour-long shows had been cancelled and that the move to children&#x27;s television was a &quot;purely financial&quot; arrangement.

In Bing Crosby&#x27;s final Christmas special, taped for CBS in the UK just a few weeks before Crosby&#x27;s death in 1977, Baxter played multiple roles, including a butler, cook and – in one skit opposite a cracking-up Crosby – the ghost of Bob Hope&#x27;s court jester ancestor. Having retired in 1990, Baxter returned for a one-off Christmas 2008 special for ITV, containing a mix of archived and new material, with celebrity comedians commenting on Baxter&#x27;s influence on their lives and careers.

==Film==
Baxter appeared in a number of films, including &quot;Geordie&quot; (1955), &quot;Very Important Person&quot; (1961), &quot;The Fast Lady&quot; (1962), &quot;Crooks Anonymous&quot; (1962) and &quot;Father Came Too!&quot; (1963), the last four alongside James Robertson Justice, together with the animation &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot; (1995).

==Books==
Baxter has written a number of books based on the language of Glasgow, as developed in his &quot;Parliamo Glasgow&quot; sketch, and on the humour of the city;
* &quot;Bedside Book of Glasgow Humour&quot; , may be same as 
* &quot;Parliamo Glasgow Omnibus&quot; and 
* &quot;Let&#x27;s Parliamo Glasgow Again – Merrorapattur&quot; 
* &quot;Stanley Baxter&#x27;s Suburban Shocker : Featuring Rosemary Morningside and the Garrulous Glaswegian Mr. Ballhead&quot;

==Personal life==
Baxter was brought up in the West End of Glasgow, in a tenement. He lived there from the age of five until he married actress Moira Robertson at 26 years of age. He later lived in Highgate, North London. He was married for 46 years until his wife&#x27;s death of an overdose in 1997. He was overseas at the time.

In August 2014, Baxter was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In August 2020, Baxter came out as gay, following the release of his authorised biography. His biography described how Baxter had told Moira that he was gay before they married, with Baxter having sought to end their relationship as a result, but that she had threatened suicide, causing him to relent. Moira accepted that he was gay and allowed him to bring men home for sex, despite homosexual acts being illegal in England and Wales until the passing of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 16 years after their marriage. Five years before then, Baxter had been arrested for cottaging and contemplated suicide for fear of scandal causing an end to his career. The soliciting charges were subsequently dropped.

Baxter sought to maintain the secrecy around his sexual orientation, with his biography describing how he had taken legal action over the posthumous publication of Kenneth Williams&#x27; diaries after Williams, a long-time friend, died in 1988. In his biography, Baxter describes his discomfort with his homosexuality: &quot;Anybody would be insane to choose to live such a very difficult life. There are many gay people these days who are fairly comfortable with their sexuality, fairly happy with who they are. I&#x27;m not. I never wanted to be gay. I still don&#x27;t.&quot;

==Awards==
* BAFTA Award for Light Entertainment Artist (1960)
* BAFTA Award for Light Entertainment Performance (1975) for the &quot;Stanley Baxter Moving Picture Show&quot;
* BAFTA Scotland Award for Outstanding Contribution (2020)
* Lifetime Achievement Award (British Comedy Awards) (1997)
* &quot;Oldie&quot; Camper of the Year – For continuing to endear and delight his audiences with original comic material by &quot;The Oldie&quot; magazine (2008)

Baxter was offered an OBE, but declined.

==DVD releases==
All six of Baxter&#x27;s hour-long ITV specials were released on a two-disc DVD set in 2005 as &quot;The Stanley Baxter Collection&quot; with a further two-disc DVD set being released in 2006 under the title &quot;The Stanley Baxter Series &amp; Picture Show&quot; featuring both of his series of half-hour shows for ITV. In 2008 a five-disc DVD box set was released titled &quot;The Stanley Baxter Television Set&quot;. The set includes both half-hour ITV series that Baxter made for ITV and six of his ITV specials. It also includes two of the feature films he made with James Robertson Justice &quot;The Fast Lady&quot; and &quot;Father Came Too!&quot;.

<text>Jules Cavailles (20 June 1901, Carmaux – 29 January 1977, Épineuil) was a French painter.

== Biography ==
He started as a technical draughtsman during which time he met “le pere Artigue” - who was a friend of the famous pointillist artist Henri Martin – and who encouraged him to go to Paris to study fine art. In 1925 he enrolled at the Académie Julian and he began exhibiting at the various Parisian Salons from 1928 – the Société des Artistes Français, Société des Artistes Indépendants and Salon d&#x27;Automne. To fund his studies he opened a small chemist shop. He was soon invited to participate at the Salon des Tuileries and in 1936 he organised the 14th exhibition of the Artistes de ce temps in the Petit-Palais. In the same year he received the prestigious Grant Blumenthal and he was soon awarded the commission to decorate the Pavilion of Languedoc for the Exposition Universelle. He was part of a group of artists called “La Realite Poetique”. 
His artistic style is characterised by the juxtaposition of pure colour, derived from an interpretation of fauvist painting which was less interested in the early Fauve artists’ search for intensity and dynamism than a simple expression of ‘joie de vivre’.

He worked in oils, gouache, and pastel, and his subject matter featured figures, portraits, nudes,
still lifes, flowers, landscapes, and animals.
His work is represented in many leading collections and museums, including the Modern Art Museum in Paris,
and the museums in Toulouse, Albi, Marseilles, Chicago, and Helsinki.

<text>Avraham Danzig (ben Yehiel Michael, 1748—1820; אברהם דנציג) was a rabbi, &quot;posek&quot; (legal decisor) and codifier, best known as the author of the works of Jewish law called &quot;Chayei Adam&quot; and &quot;Chochmat Adam&quot;. He is sometimes referred to as &quot;the &quot;Chayei Adam&quot;&quot;.

==Biography==
Danzig was born in Danzig (Gdańsk), Poland (hence his name), in 1747 or 1748 into a prominent rabbinic family. When he was fourteen, his father sent him to study at the Prague &quot;yeshivah&quot;, after exacting a promise from him &quot;that he would not mingle with the Moderns&quot; who were then gradually coming into prominence through the influence of Moses Mendelssohn.

He studied in Prague for four years under Rabbi Yechezkel Landau and Rabbi Joseph Liebermann. He was then offered a position as rabbi in Vilna, but declined, earning his livelihood as a merchant (frequenting the fairs of Leipzig and Königsberg - which are referred to in his writings). Only in his later years, and after having lost almost his entire fortune through the explosion of a powder-magazine, could he be induced to accept the position of &quot;dayan&quot; in Vilna, where he served until 1812. He died there on September 12, 1820.

Danzig is one of three authorities on whom Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried based his rulings in the &quot;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch&quot;.

His descendants include Rabbi Neil Danzig and Rabbi Joseph Meyer Danzig, son of Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Danzig, who was born in Jerusalem and named after his prominent ancestor.

==Works==
Danzig wrote several important works, but he is especially known for &quot;Chayei Adam&quot; and &quot;Chochmat Adam&quot;, his works of &quot;halacha&quot; covering the laws of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; dealing with everyday life.

Chayei Adam (, &quot;The Life of Man&quot;) deals with the laws discussed in the &quot;Orach Chayim&quot; section of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;. It is divided into 224 sections - 69 dealing with daily conduct and prayer, and 155 with &quot;Shabbat&quot;, and holidays. In this work, Danzig collected and critically sifted the Acharonic material, in the field of &quot;halakha&quot; written in the more than two and a half centuries since the appearance of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;. &quot;Chayei Adam&quot; was intended primarily &quot;for the cultured layman&quot;, as opposed to rabbinic scholars, and the work is thus presented in a readily accessible form. The parallel work &quot;Nishmat Adam&quot;, published together with &quot;Chayei Adam&quot;, discusses the &quot;halachic&quot; issues in greater depth. The two are usually printed together. In many cities, societies were formed for the purpose of studying &quot;Chayei Adam&quot;.

Chochmat Adam (, &quot;The Wisdom of Man&quot;), similarly, discusses the laws in the &quot;Yoreh De&#x27;ah&quot; section of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, as well as laws from the &quot;Even Ha&#x27;ezer&quot; and &quot;Choshen Mishpat&quot; sections pertinent to everyday life. &quot;Binat Adam&quot; on this work corresponds to the &quot;Nishmat Adam&quot; on &quot;Chayei Adam&quot;. &quot;Chochmat Adam&quot; was written in consultation with two of the greatest Torah scholars of the time - Chaim Volozhin and Yaakov of Lisa.

The scholarship of these works is evidenced by the fact that Rabbi Chaim Volozhin, known for his opposition to &quot;digests of halacha&quot;, granted the work his approbation (on condition that each section be cross-referenced to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; to allow for further study). Reportedly, the &quot;Chatam Sofer&quot; instructed his son that when unable to refer to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, he could refer to the &quot;Chochmat Adam&quot; in making a halachic decision

Other works by Danzig include:
*&quot;Zichru Torat Moshe&quot; - an introduction to the laws of &quot;Shabbos&quot;.
*&quot;Kitzur Sefer Charedim&quot; - an abridgement of the classic &quot;Sefer Charedim&quot; by Rabbi Elazar Ezkari.
*&quot;Toldot Adam&quot; - a commentary on the Passover &quot;Haggadah&quot;.

Danzig also wrote Tefillah Zakah, a penitential prayer recited by many on the eve of Yom Kippur.

==Gunpowder Purim==
On November 18, 1804, a gunpowder magazine exploded accidentally in Vilna, killing 31 people and destroying a large amount of property. This explosion occurred at Vilna fort and spread to areas nearby.
Among those who lost his home and his business was Rabbi Avraham Danzig. Yet Rabbi Danzig and his family were spared from death, and so grateful was he for this that he declared the date of the conflagration to be a “Pulverpurim” (Gunpowder Purim) for the Danzig family. According to this custom, the 15th of Kislev is a fast day, with the giving of extra charity. On the following night, which is the 16th of Kislev, a Meal of Thanksgiving (&quot;Seudas Hodaah&quot;) is eaten.

<doc id="1027016" wikidata="Q2577801" url="?curid=1027016" title="Kingsdown, Dover">
<text>Kingsdown is a village on the English Channel coast of Kent. Parts of the village are built on or behind the shingle beach that runs north to Deal and beyond, while other parts are on the cliffs and hills inland. The village church of St John the Evangelist was built by local landowner William Curling in 1848. Curling&#x27;s former residence, Kingsdown House, was acquired by the Brightstone Holiday Centre in 1934 and a holiday camp, now known as Kingsdown Holiday Park, has operated in the grounds up to the present day. It is in the civil parish of Ringwould with Kingsdown. In 2019 it had an estimated population of 1764.

== History ==
A settlement or hamlet at Kingsdown is described in antiquity.

During the Middle Ages, the coastal confederation of Cinque Ports consisted of 42 towns and villages. These included Kingsdown, as a &quot;limb&quot; (subordinate affiliate) of Dover.

While the inland areas are devoted to farming, the modern village expanded in the 19th century as a fishing community. As at Deal and Walmer to the north, the steeply shelving shingle beach posed a challenge to the ingenuity of local fishermen, who installed fixed capstans along the shore in order to haul their boats out of the water. Many of the older sheds and houses on the beach date from this period.

Kingsdown was also at the southern end of the important anchorage known as The Downs, which is sheltered between the coast of Kent and the Goodwin Sands that lie offshore to the east. In the late 19th century, The Downs was widely used by hundreds of sailing ships that needed to ride out bad weather, although many ships came to grief on the Goodwins. A lifeboat station was built at Kingsdown in 1866 and was in operation until 1927. The nearest lifeboat is now based at Walmer to the north. From 1863, Oldstairs Bay at the south of Kingsdown Beach was also the location for an important Coastguard station and the substantial coastguard houses that remain (which are now privately occupied).

In 1926, the first woman to swim the English Channel, 19-year-old Gertrude Ederle, made landfall at Kingsdown, after a 35-mile crossing (the direct distance is 21 miles) in record time. Kingsdown&#x27;s proximity to France placed it on the front line of several wars. The defences at Walmer Castle, one mile north of the village, recall historic threats in Tudor and Napoleonic times, but there is also a reminder of more recent conflicts south of Oldstairs Bay where the former Royal Marines rifle range lies inland of concrete sea defences built by the Ministry of Defence. During World War I, a military airfield operated from Hawkshill Freedown between Kingsdown and Walmer. In World War II, Kingsdown was the location for a secret radio transmitting ground station for Oboe, that provided a navigation system designed to help aircraft locate themselves on operations over enemy occupied territory.

== Geography ==
Kingsdown is located at the northern end of the White Cliffs of Dover; the village itself sits below the chalk cliff and in the valleys leading down to the shore, with some outlying buildings and the holiday camp on top or midway up. The chalk, which dates from the Cretaceous period, is a natural aquifer that forms the source for Kingsdown Water, which is extracted to the north west of the village. The Kingsdown foreshore is the most southerly point of a shingle bank and flood plain that stretches north to the Isle of Thanet.

The beach and downs around the village are important for migrating birds and insects, and for rare plants. The beach and cliffs are part of the Site of Special Scientific Interest that stretches south to Folkestone. The beach is largely shingle but low tide exposes some sandy areas and a chalk shelf stretching out to sea, particularly in the area of Oldstairs Bay at the southern end.

==Transport==
There are no railway stations in the village itself, but a bus service run by Stagecoach connects the village to Walmer railway station, which has direct trains to London. Since 2009, this also provides a link to the high-speed domestic service High Speed 1 running to London St Pancras International, with connections at either Dover Priory, Ashford International or Ramsgate.

== Walking and cycling ==
Kingsdown has numerous local public footpaths and lies on both the Saxon Shore Way and the White Cliffs Country Trail. The section of National Cycle Route 1 known as the Cliffs and Castles route runs through Kingsdown on its way from Dover to Sandwich. A flat, purpose-built cycleway leads north from the outskirts of the village along the beach to Deal. In Kingsdown itself, part of the cycle route follows quiet public roads or footpaths.

<text>Myfanwy Warhurst (, born 29 May 1974) is an Australian radio announcer and television personality, best known for her work at Triple J radio station and on ABC Television&#x27;s long-running music-themed quiz show &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;. she has an ongoing role as Australia&#x27;s commentator for the Eurovision Song Contest alongside Joel Creasey, and as co-host of the weekly podcast &quot;Bang On&quot;. She also provides the voices of Aunt Trixie and Indy&#x27;s Mum in the Australian animated show &quot;Bluey&quot;.

==Early life==
Warhurst was born in Portland, Victoria, in 1974. She has three older brothers named, Shaun, Kit and Andre. Brother Shaun had a significant role in initially encouraging her interests ultimately leading her into the industry. Kit plays drums in the band Rocket Science. Warhurst&#x27;s family moved to Donald in central Victoria when she was a child, then to Red Cliffs in northwest Victoria when she was eight years old.

==Career==
Before her career as a radio announcer and TV personality, Warhurst was editor-in-chief of Melbourne street press &quot;Inpress&quot;.

===Radio and podcasting===
Working as a radio announcer at Triple J, Warhurst came to the attention of the station&#x27;s audience through short bi-weekly segments for &quot;Merrick and Rosso&#x27;s Drive&quot; program in 2000. In 2001, Warhurst began hosting the &quot;Net 50&quot; request program on Saturday nights, and in 2003, came to prominence as host of the weekday &quot;Lunch&quot; shift and her daily segment &quot;The Trashy Lunchtime Quiz&quot;. In January 2007 she joined Jay and the Doctor in hosting &quot;The Breakfast Show&quot; as &quot;Myf, Jay and the Doctor&quot;.

It was announced on 10 October 2007 that she would leave Triple J and co-host a new breakfast show with comedian Peter Helliar and take over the Triple M Melbourne breakfast spot from The Cage, who finished up in November 2007.

Warhurst is co-host, with Zan Rowe, of the weekly podcast &quot;Bang On&quot;, &quot;about music, art, life and stuff&quot;.

===Television===
Warhurst&#x27;s television work has included hosting &quot;jtv&quot;, the December 2006 special &quot;My Favourite Album&quot;, and captaining a team on &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; from its inception in 2005 until it finished in 2011, and again after its resumption with special episodes beginning in 2018 and as a full-time show in 2021. When finishing &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;, Warhurst said &quot;I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to experience many great things. I&#x27;ve seen Frank Woodley&#x27;s privates, been naked under a desk with Pete Murray, and met many of my childhood musical crushes. Life can&#x27;t get much better than that, so this seems like the perfect time to wind things up.&quot; Worst moments included her embarrassment at not being able to recall the name of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; upon hearing it.

She is a regular presenter on &quot;The Project&quot;.

Warhurst returned to ABC1 in June 2012 with a six-part series, &quot;Myf Warhurst&#x27;s Nice&quot;.

In 2017, Warhurst, along with Joel Creasey, was announced as one of Australia&#x27;s commentators for the Eurovision Song Contest. Warhurst also appeared as a guest quiz master on &quot;Have You Been Paying Attention?&quot;

Since 2018, she has voiced the animated characters of Aunt Trixie and Indy&#x27;s Mum, in the ABC Kids television program &quot;Bluey&quot;.

==Guest appearances==
Warhurst has occasionally appeared on &quot;Rove&quot;, and was a special presenter on RMITV&#x27;s &quot;The Loft Live&quot;.

In January 2020, Warhurst participated in the sixth season of the Australian version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;.

She was the focus of the second episode of season 13 of the Australian version of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, first aired on 28 June 2022.

In August 2022, Warhurst was interviewed by Virginia Trioli on radio, in which she talked about receiving training to become a foster parent.

In October 2022, she appeared on Fran Kelly&#x27;s TV show &quot;Frankly&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; twice won the Logies&#x27; &quot;Most Outstanding Light Entertainment Program&quot;.

The irreverent &quot;TV Fugly Awards&quot; (in its &quot;Good Categories&quot;) awarded Warhurst as their &quot;Most Spankable Female TV Personality&quot; in 2007 &amp; 2008.

<text>Costa Zouliou (born 1964 in Melbourne) is an Australian radio announcer best known for his work at Triple J. Although born in Melbourne, he was raised, and now lives in Brisbane. He is currently working behind-the-scenes and presenting fill-in shifts at radio station ABC Classic FM. He was recently behind a campaign to change the name of the Go Between Bridge in Brisbane to The Go-Betweens Bridge, to correctly refer to the iconic Brisbane band, The Go-Betweens.

He started as the host of a short &quot;What’s Happening&quot; program on Friday, later Saturday nights. He became host of the heavy metal show, &quot;Three Hours of Power&quot; after Francis Leach moved on. He held this role until 2000, after which he switched to do &quot;Drive&quot; for a year, followed by his most current role of Weekend Lunch from 2003 until 2005. He then became a sound engineer for ABC &quot;Classic FM&quot; and ABC &quot;Radio National&quot;.

Costa has been a member of the management committee of Q Music, the Queensland music industry organisation since April 2004, and is also involved with Straight Out of Brisbane, an annual arts and culture festival in Brisbane.

On 19 December 2018, he will be presenting the first episode of a summer fill-in show on Double J called Rock Up.

<doc id="1027027" wikidata="Q157573" url="?curid=1027027" title="Phalaris (plant)">
<text>Phalaris is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family. Species of &quot;Phalaris&quot; are distributed across all continents except Antarctica. They can be found in a broad range of habitats from below sea level to thousands of feet above sea level and from wet marshy areas to dry places. &quot;P. arundinacea&quot; and &quot;P. aquatica&quot; are sometimes invasive species in wetlands.

==Alkaloids==
Some &quot;Phalaris&quot; species contain gramine, which, in sheep and to a lesser extent in cattle, is toxic and can cause brain damage, other organ damage, central nervous system damage, and death.

&quot;Phalaris arundinacea&quot;, &quot;Phalaris aquatica&quot;, and &quot;Phalaris brachystachys&quot; are known to contain the alkaloids DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, and 5-OH-DMT (bufotenin). Some research has been done into the variability of alkaloids in the &quot;Phalaris&quot; grasses. Strains with high levels of alkaloids are best avoided in locations with grazing cattle and sheep, due to potential toxicity. Such high-alkaloid strains include &quot;Phalaris aquatica AQ-1&quot; and the species &quot;P. brachystachys&quot;. Seasonal and weather patterns also appear to affect alkaloid concentration, as most toxicity occurs in autumn and in times of drought. Regrowth after grazing or mowing also shows a considerable increase in alkaloids.

In June 2018, mobs of wild kangaroos were observed suffering from &quot;phalaris staggers&quot; which causes head tremors, a loss of co-ordination and collapse. When phalaris is used to feed livestock, farmers can administer cobalt to their animals or spray it on their pastures to protect animals against the effects of phalaris. However, this treatment is not available to wild kangaroos and they suffer from poisoning due to the alkaloids. The staggers syndrome is more common in livestock in areas with limestone soils, which contain less cobalt than basalt soils.

None of the above alkaloids is said to have been found in &quot;P. californica&quot;, &quot;P. canariensis&quot;, &quot;P. minor&quot; and hybrids of &quot;P. arundinacea&quot; together with &quot;P. aquatica&quot;.

==Uses==
Some species are used in dried flower arrangements. &quot;Phalaris canariensis&quot; is commonly used for birdseed.

&quot;Phalaris arundinacea&quot; is also being trialled as a potential bioenergy crop in Ireland.

==Species==
Species include:
*&quot;Phalaris amethystina&quot; Trin.
*&quot;Phalaris angusta&quot; - timothy canarygrass

<text>Chayei Adam (חיי אדם &quot;The Life of Man&quot;) is a work of Jewish law by Rabbi Avraham Danzig (1748–1820), dealing with the laws discussed in the Orach Chayim section of the Shulchan Aruch. It is divided into 224 sections - 69 dealing with daily conduct and prayer, and 155 with Shabbos (Sabbath) and Yom Tov (holidays).

Chayei Adam was intended primarily &quot;for the cultured layman&quot;, as opposed to rabbinic scholars, and the work is thus presented in a readily accessible form. In many cities, societies were formed for the purpose of studying Chayei Adam.

In this work, Rabbi Danzig collected and critically sifted the &quot;Acharonic&quot; material in the field of the Halakha written in the more than two and a half centuries since the appearance of the Shulchan Aruch. A parallel work &quot;Nishmas Adam&quot;, published together with Chayei Adam, discusses the halachic issues in greater depth. The two are usually printed together.

The scholarship of the work is evidenced by the fact that Rabbi Chaim Volozhin, known for his opposition to &quot;digests of halacha&quot;, granted the work his approbation (on condition that each section be cross-referenced to the Shulkhan Arukh to allow for further study). The rulings of the Chayei Adam are often cited in later works, especially the Mishnah Berurah.

<text>Po Chai Pills () is a traditional Chinese medicine product made from several herbs formed into tiny spherical pills about 4 mm in diameter. It is used as a remedy for the relief of indigestion, heartburn, vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating. It can also be used as a hangover prevention remedy.

==History==
Po Chai Pills were developed by Li Shiu Kei in Foshan, Guangdong, in 1896. Following the Chinese Civil War, the Li family fled to Hong Kong and reestablished their company, Li Chung Shing Tong. However, their mainland property was nationalized. As a result, there are now two manufacturers of Po Chai Pills:

*Li Chung Shing Tong (Holdings) Limited (李眾勝堂(集團)有限公司) in Hong Kong; and
*Guangzhou Wanglaoji Pharmaceutical Company Limited (廣州王老吉葯業股份有限公司) in Guangzhou, China.

A mutual agreement between both parties has limited Wanglaoji&#x27;s trademark rights to mainland China, while Li Chung Shing Tong has the rights to use the trademark in the rest of the world. The mainland manufacturer exports them from China as Curing Pills or Bao Ji Pills.

On 8 March 2010, sales of the pills and the capsule form of Po Chai from Li Chung Shing Tong were temporarily halted in Singapore as a precaution because traces of phenolphthalein and sibutramine were detected by the company in batches of the capsule form of Po Chai, and were recalled.
Phenolphthalein&#x27;s past use for its laxative properties has been discontinued because of concerns it may be carcinogenic. On 24 March 2010, Hong Kong&#x27;s Department of Health recalled both Po Chai Pills Capsule Form and Po Chai Pills Bottle Form from local retail outlets and consumers.

On 11 May 2010, a licensed manufacturer in proprietary Chinese medicine, Li Chung Shing Tong (Holdings) Ltd. HK was given the green light to resume production and marketing of Po Chai Pills Bottle Form. Laboratory tests identified 11 tainted samples, all in Capsule Form, while none of the Bottle Form samples was found to contain the above two western medicines. In connection, the manufacturer has withdrawn the application for registration of Po Chai Pills Capsule Form which ceased to be produced in late March 2010.

<text>A security thread is a security feature of many banknotes to protect against counterfeiting. Introduced in 1990, it consists of a thin ribbon that is woven through the note&#x27;s paper.

Usually, the ribbon runs vertically, and is &quot;woven&quot; into the paper, so that it at some places emerges on the front side and at the remaining places at the rear side of the paper. It is made of metal foil, but sometimes of plastic, and oftentimes it has some text or numbers (e.g., the denomination) engraved. 

Threads are embedded within the paper fiber and can be completely invisible or have a star burst effect, where the thread appears to weave in and out of the paper when viewed from one side, while the thread will always appear as a solid line when held up to the light. Features can be built into the thread material e.g., microprinting on a transparent plastic thread or adding materials so they fluoresce under ultraviolet light.
The thread is a difficult feature to counterfeit, 

Security threads can also be used as an anti-counterfeiting device in passports. Those are generally made of plastic and contain microprinting.

<text>Coptis (goldthread or canker root) is a genus of between 10 and 15 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native to Asia and North America.

==Species==


==Uses==
&quot;Coptis teeta&quot; is used as a medicinal herb in China and the Eastern Himalayan regions of India particularly in Mishmi Hills of Arunachal Pradesh where it is used as a bitter tonic for treating malarial fever and dyspepsia. It is also believed to help insomnia in Chinese herbology. The roots contain the bitter alkaloid berberine. Studies have shown that the species has become endangered both due to overexploitation as well as intrinsic genetic bottlenecks such as high cytoplasmic male sterility induced by genetic mutations. As a result of the synaptic mutation and ensuing male sterility the sexual reproduction in the species is significantly depressed. The dried roots (goldthread) were commercially marketed in Canada until the 1950s or early 60s, to be steeped into a &quot;tea&quot; and swabbed onto areas affected by thrush (candidiasis) infection.

==Ecology==
The species inhabits warm and cold temperate forests of oak-rhododendron association. It is occasionally seen growing under bamboo thickets around Mayodia region of Dibang Valley district in the Mishmi Hills of Arunachal Pradesh in India. It flowers during early spring March–April and sets fruit/seed in July–August. The seedlings are rare and are often found germinating on moss laden dead wood on the forest floor or even on moss laden branches of Rhododendron. A new subspecies was recognised in &quot;C. teeta&quot; by Pandit &amp; Babu and was named as subsp. &quot;lohitensis&quot;, which is morphologically very different from subsp. &quot;teeta&quot; and it is geographically distinct and inhabits broad leaf forests in Delai Valley of Lohit district in Arunachal Pradesh, India.

<text>Medicago truncatula, the barrelclover, strong-spined medick, barrel medic, or barrel medick, is a small annual legume native to the Mediterranean region that is used in genomic research. It is a low-growing, clover-like plant tall with trifoliate leaves. Each leaflet is rounded, long, often with a dark spot in the center. The flowers are yellow, produced singly or in a small inflorescence of two to five together; the fruit is a small, spiny pod.

This species is studied as a model organism for legume biology because it has a small diploid genome, is self-fertile, has a rapid generation time and prolific seed production, is amenable to genetic transformation, and its genome has been sequenced.

It forms symbioses with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia (&quot;Sinorhizobium meliloti&quot; and &quot;Sinorhizobium medicae&quot;) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi including &quot;Rhizophagus irregularis&quot; (previously known as &quot;Glomus intraradices&quot;). The model plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; does not form either symbiosis, making &quot;M. truncatula&quot; an important tool for studying these processes.

It is also an important forage crop species in Australia.

==Sequencing of the genome==
The draft sequence of the genome of &quot;M. truncatula&quot; cultivar A17 was published in the journal&quot; Nature&quot; in 2011.

The sequencing was carried out by an international partnership of research laboratories involving researchers from the University of Oklahoma (US), J. Craig Venter Institute (US), Genoscope (France), and Sanger Centre (UK). Partner institutions included the University of Minnesota (US), University of California-Davis (US), the National Center for Genomic Resources (US), John Innes Centre (UK), Institut National de Recherche Agronomique (France), Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (Germany), Wageningen University (the Netherlands), and Ghent University (Belgium). The &quot;Medicago truncatula&quot; Sequencing Consortium began in 2001 with a seed grant from the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation. In 2003, the National Science Foundation and the European Union 6th Framework Programme began providing most of the funding. By 2009, 84% of the genome assembly had been completed.

The assembly of the genome sequence in &quot;M. truncatula&quot; was based on bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). This is the same approach used to sequence the genomes of humans, the fruitfly, &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, and the model plant, &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;. In July 2013, version 4.0 of the genome was released. This version combined sequences gained from shotgun sequencing with the BAC-based sequence assemblies, which has helped to fill in the gaps in the previously mapped sequences.

A parallel group known as the International &quot;Medicago&quot; Gene Annotation Group (IMGAG) is responsible for identifying and describing putative gene sequences within the genome sequence.

==Symbioses with soil microorganisms==
Researcher Toby Kiers of VU University Amsterdam and associates used &quot;M. truncatula&quot; to study symbioses between plants and fungi – and to see whether the partners in the relationship could distinguish between good and bad traders/suppliers. By using labeled carbon to track the source of nutrient flowing through the arbuscular mycorrhizal system, the researchers have proven that the plants had indeed given more carbon to the more generous fungus species. By restricting the amount of carbon the plants gave to the fungus, the researchers also demonstrated that the fungi did pass along more of their phosphorus to the more generous plants.

==Proteome==
Proteomic investigation by mass spectrometry has been performed by Wienkoop et al 2004 and Larrainzar et al 2007.

<doc id="1027043" wikidata="Q22257011" url="?curid=1027043" title="The Book of Abramelin">
<text>The Book of Abramelin tells the story of an Egyptian mage named Abraham, or Abra-Melin, who taught a system of magic to Abraham of Worms, a Jew from Worms, Germany, presumed to have lived from to . The system of magic from this book regained popularity in the 19th and 20th centuries partly due to Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers&#x27; translation, The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.

The book presents an autobiography written in the form of an epistolary novel. The character of Abraham of Worms narrates his travel to the Egyptian desert and to a town bordering the Nile. An elderly Egyptian mage offers him two manuscripts containing knowledge of Kabbalistic magic, but extracts an oath that bounds Abraham in the service of God and the divine law.

The work was translated into English by Samuel L. MacGregor Mathers and more recently by Georg Dehn and Steven Guth. Dehn attributed authorship of &quot;The Book of Abramelin&quot; to Rabbi Yaakov Moelin (Maharil) (Hebrew ; ), a German Jewish rabbi. This identification has since been disputed.

==Structure==
The grimoire is framed as a sort of epistolary novel or autobiography in which Abraham of Worms describes his journey from Germany to Egypt and reveals Abramelin&#x27;s magical and Kabbalistic secrets to his son Lamech. Internally the text dates itself to the year 1458.

The story involves Abraham of Worms passing his magical and Kabbalistic secrets on to his son and tells how he acquired his knowledge. Abraham recounts how he found Abramelin the Mage living in the desert outside an Egyptian town, Arachi or Araki, which borders the Nile. Abramelin&#x27;s home sat atop a small hill surrounded by trees. He was an Egyptian mage and taught a powerful form of Kabbalistic magic to Abraham. He was a &quot;venerable aged man&quot;, and very courteous and kind. He discussed nothing but the &quot;Fear of God&quot;, the importance of leading a well-regulated life, and the evils of the &quot;acquisition of riches and goods&quot;.

Abramelin extracted a promise from Abraham that he would give up his &quot;false dogmas&quot; and live &quot;in the Way and Law of the Lord.&quot; He then gave Abraham two manuscript books to copy for himself, asking for ten gold florins, which he took with the intention of distributing to seventy-two poor persons in Arachi. Upon his return fifteen days later, after having disposed of the payment money, Abramelin extracted an oath from Abraham to &quot;serve and fear&quot; the Lord, and to &quot;live and die in His most Holy Law.&quot; After this, Abramelin gave Abraham the &quot;Divine Science&quot; and &quot;True Magic&quot; embedded within the two manuscripts, which he was to follow and give to only those whom he knew well.

==Origin and manuscript sources==

The book exists in the form of twelve manuscripts and an early printed edition. The provenance of the text has not been definitively identified. The earliest manuscripts are two versions that date from about 1608, are written in German and are now found in Wolfenbüttel. Another two manuscripts are in Dresden, and date from about 1700 and 1750 respectively.

The first printed version, also in German, dates to 1725 and was printed in Cologne by Peter Hammer. A partial copy in Hebrew is found in the Bodleian Library in Oxford, and dates from around 1740. An 18th century manuscript copy exists in French in the &quot;Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Arsenal&quot; in Paris, an institution founded in 1757. Another 17th-century manuscript in Italian exists in the &#x27;Legato Martinengo&#x27; of the Queriniana Library in Brescia, Italy. It was part of the collection of the Count and Qabbalist Leopardo Martinengo of Barco and Torre Pallavicina. The manuscript, unknown for centuries to international researchers until 2009, has been found by academic researcher Maria Elena Loda in the esoteric section. At the moment, it is the only known manuscript translation in the Italian language of the Abramelin grimoire.

All German copies of the text consist of four books: an autobiographical account of the travels of Abraham of Worms to Egypt, a book of assorted materials from the corpus of the practical Kabbalah (including some which is duplicated in the German-Jewish grimoire called the &quot;Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses&quot;) and the two books of magic given by Abramelin to Abraham. The well-known English translation by S. L. MacGregor Mathers from the French manuscript in Paris contains only three of the four books. The ritual as described in the Mathers manuscript lasts six months. Newer compilations and translations contain all four books, and describe a duration of 18 months for completing the ritual. The Hebrew version in Oxford is limited to Book One, without reference to the further books.

Of all the extant sources, the German manuscripts in Wolfenbüttel and Dresden are taken by scholars to be the authoritative texts. According to respected Kabbalah scholar Gershom Scholem, the Hebrew version in Oxford was translated into Hebrew from German. An analysis of the spelling and language usage in the French manuscript indicates that it dates to the 18th century and that it was also likely copied from a German original. Although the author quotes from the Jewish Book of Psalms, the version given is not from the Hebrew; rather, it is from the Latin Vulgate, a translation of the Bible employed by Roman Catholics at that time.

The German esoteric scholar Georg Dehn has argued that the author was Rabbi Yaakov Moelin (Hebrew: יעקב בן משה מולין; ca. 1365–1427), a German Jewish Talmudist and &quot;posek&quot; (authority on Jewish law).

==Practical magic and ritual==
The practical magic described in &quot;The Book of Abramelin&quot; involves a detailed ritual lasting six to eighteen months, depending on the version. This ritual is designed to achieve communion with one&#x27;s Holy Guardian Angel and involves strict purity practices, prayer, and the use of magic word squares.

===Magic word squares===

The practical magic of Abramelin (found in both Book III of the French text, and Book IV of the German original) centres around a set of talismans composed of magic word squares. These are similar to traditional magic squares, though the latter are usually composed of numbers, while Abramelin&#x27;s squares contain letters. Commonly word squares are used as puzzles or as teaching aids for students. In the context of Abramelin, the focus becomes mystical—so that each square &quot;should&quot; contain words or names that relate to the magical goal of the square. A parallel is found in the famous Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas word square, an altered version of which is also found among Abramelin&#x27;s squares.

For example, a square entitled &quot;To walk underwater for as long as you want&quot; contains the word MAIAM (מים), the Hebrew word for &quot;water&quot;. A square for recovering treasures of jewelry begins with the word TIPHARAH (תפארה, a variant of Tiferet), which can mean &quot;golden ring&quot; in Hebrew and is also the name of the sphere of &quot;Beauty&quot; (which has the planetary attribution of the Sun) on the Kabbalistic tree of life.

==Influence and legacy==
&quot;The Book of Abramelin&quot; has had a significant influence on Western esotericism, particularly on the practices of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley. Crowley’s engagement with the Abramelin operation is documented in his autobiographical works, where he describes his attempts to perform the ritual and its impact on his magical practices.

==Translations==
In 1897, &quot;The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage&quot; was translated into English by the British occultist Samuel L. MacGregor Mathers from a 15th-century French version of the manuscript. This translation contains three of the four books. The magic described in the grimoire significantly influenced the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, an organization Mathers co-founded.

In 2006, Georg Dehn edited and published &quot;The Book of Abramelin: A New Translation&quot;, which includes all four books and is based on the original German sources. This edition provides a more complete and accurate representation of the text.

Melton Highway commences at the diamond interchange with Western Freeway and heads north as a four-lane, dual-carriageway road, intersecting shortly afterwards with High Street through central Melton, and then Gisborne-Melton Road, before narrowing back to a dual-lane, single-carriageway road heading east, sign-posted at 70 km/h as the road bends and dips to cross Kororoit Creek, increases to 80 km/h afterwards and then eventually to 100 km/h through Plumpton. The speed limit drops back to 80 km/h approaching Hillside, where the road widens to a four-lane, dual-carriageway and continues east through Sydenham and Taylors Lakes, past Watergardens Town Centre, to eventually terminate at the intersection with Sunshine Avenue in Keilor. Increases in traffic has seen the road upgraded with many overtaking lanes, and increasing residential levels at the eastern (Sydenham) end has seen further duplication of carriageways and reconstruction of the railway crossing just north of Sydenham (Watergardens) station.

==History==
The alignment of Keilor–Melton Road was altered at both ends through the 1980s:
*its eastern end in Keilor, originally terminating with the Calder Highway (today Old Calder Highway) in northern Keilor, was truncated to terminate at Sunshine Avenue to provision new ramps to the Calder Freeway when the Keilor bypass opened in 1984; the former alignment is now known as Old Calder Highway
*its western end in Melton, originally terminating with the Western Highway (today High Street) in central Melton, was re-aligned to terminate at a new interchange with the Western Freeway when the Melton bypass opened in 1987; the former alignment is now known as Melton Valley Drive and Sherwin Court

Keilor–Melton Road was signed as Metropolitan Route 54 between Melton and Keilor in 1989; with Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, this was replaced with route C754.

The passing of the &quot;Transport Act of 1983&quot; (itself an evolution from the original &quot;Highways and Vehicles Act of 1924&quot;) provided for the declaration of State Highways, roads two-thirds financed by the State government through the Road Construction Authority (later VicRoads). The State Highway (Keilor-Melton Road) was declared a State Highway in November 1989, from Western Freeway in Melton to Sunshine Avenue in Taylors Lakes where it meets the ramps to the Calder Freeway, then re-declared as the Melton Highway just over a year later in December 1990, within the same alignment.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared Melton Highway (Arterial #6040) from Western Freeway in Melton to Sunshine Avenue in Taylors Lakes.

In September 2018, the former level crossing through the Sunbury/Bendigo railway line was replaced by a new 6-lane bridge overpass, with new bike lanes and footpaths on each side, and new paths underneath. The railway carries more than 200 trains each weekday and the road carries 38,000 vehicles per day.

<doc id="1027046" wikidata="Q3306791" url="?curid=1027046" title="Psychic vampire">
<text>A psychic vampire is a creature in folklore said to feed off the &quot;life force&quot; of other living creatures. The term can also be used to describe a person who gets increased energy around other people, but leaves those other people exhausted or &quot;drained&quot; of energy. Psychic vampires are represented in the occult beliefs of various cultures and in fiction.

==Psychic energy==
Terms used to describe the substance or essence that psychic vampires take or receive from others include: &quot;energy&quot;, &quot;qi&quot; (or &quot;ch&#x27;i&quot;), &quot;life force&quot;, &quot;prana&quot;, and &quot;vitality&quot;. There is no scientific or medical evidence supporting the existence of the bodily or psychic energy they allegedly drain.

==Emotional vampires==
American author Albert Bernstein uses the phrase &quot;emotional vampire&quot; for people with various personality disorders who are often considered to drain emotional energy from others.

==Energy vampires==

The term &quot;energy vampire&quot; is also used metaphorically to refer to people whose influence leaves a person feeling exhausted, unfocused, and depressed, without ascribing the phenomenon to psychic interference.

Dion Fortune wrote of psychic parasitism in relation to vampirism as early as 1930 in her book, &quot;Psychic Self-Defense&quot;. Fortune considered psychic vampirism a combination of psychic and psychological pathology, and distinguished between what she considered to be true psychic vampirism and mental conditions that produce similar symptoms. For the latter, she named folie à deux and similar phenomena.

The term &quot;psychic vampire&quot; was popularized in the 1960s by Anton LaVey and his Church of Satan. LaVey wrote on the topic in his book, &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, and claimed to have coined the term. LaVey used &quot;psychic vampire&quot; to mean a spiritually or emotionally weak person who drains vital energy from other people. Adam Parfrey likewise attributed the term to LaVey in an introduction to &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Notebook&quot;.

The English singer-songwriter Peter Hammill credits his erstwhile Van der Graaf Generator colleague, violinist Graham Smith, with coining the term &quot;energy vampires&quot; in the 1970s in order to describe intrusive, over-zealous fans. Hammill included a song of the same name on his 1978 album &quot;The Future Now&quot;.

In the 1982 horror movie &quot;One Dark Night&quot;, Karl “Raymar” Raymarseivich is the name of a Russian psychic vampire who gains power from the lifeforce of young victims by frightening them to death. This is done by demonstrations of telekinesis which emanates as visible electrical currents of bioenergy. How he dies is unclear, but his malevolence posthumously remains in his body. Effectively, Raymar is a poltergeist in the mausoleum he is interred in, opening crypts (including his own), sliding out the caskets to the floor and randomly exhuming his fellow corpses to terrify unfortunate teenagers who have chosen the wrong place to have an overnight initiation.

The terms &quot;energy vampire&quot; and &quot;psychic vampire&quot; have been used as synonyms in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union as part of an occult revival.

The 2019 American comedy horror television series &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot; includes the character Colin Robinson, a metaphorical and literal &quot;energy vampire&quot; who drains people&#x27;s life forces by being boring or frustrating.

===Vampire subculture===
Sociologists such as Mark Benecke and A. Asbjørn Jøn have identified a subculture of people who present themselves as vampires. Jon has noted that enthusiasts of the vampire subculture emulate traditional psychic vampires in that they describe &#x27;prey[ing] upon life-force or &#x27;pranic&#x27; energy&#x27;. Prominent figures in the subculture include Michelle Belanger, a self-described psychic vampire, who wrote a book titled &quot;The Psychic Vampire Codex: A Manual of Magick and Energy Work,&quot; published in 2004 by Weiser Books. Belanger details a vampiric approach to energy work which she believes psychic vampires can use to heal others, representing an attempt to disassociate the psychic vampire subculture from negative connotations of vampirism.

==Sexual vampires==
A related mythological creature is a sexual vampire, which is supposed to feed off sexual energy. Sexual vampires include succubi or incubi.

<doc id="1027053" wikidata="Q444609" url="?curid=1027053" title="Nora Barnacle">
<text>Nora Barnacle Joyce (born Norah Barnacle; 21 March 1884 – 10 April 1951) was the muse and wife of Irish author James Joyce. Barnacle and Joyce had their first romantic outing in 1904 on a date celebrated worldwide as &quot;Bloomsday&quot; after his modernist novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Barnacle did not, however, enjoy the novel. Their sexually explicit letters have aroused much curiosity, especially as Joyce normally disapproved of coarse language, and they fetch high prices at auction. In 2004, an erotic letter from Joyce to Barnacle sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for £240,800.

Barnacle and Joyce&#x27;s life together has been the subject of much popular interest. A 1980 play, &quot;Nora Barnacle&quot; by Maureen Charlton, was made about their relationship. Barnacle was the subject of a 1988 biography, &quot;Nora: A Biography of Nora Joyce&quot;, by Brenda Maddox, which was adapted into a 2000 Irish film, &quot;Nora&quot;, directed by Pat Murphy, and starring Susan Lynch and Ewan McGregor.

==Early life==
Barnacle was born in a Galway workhouse on 21 March 1884. Her entry in the birth register, which gives her first name as &quot;Norah&quot; (the spelling she used until she met Joyce), is dated 22 March. Her father, Thomas Barnacle, a baker in Connemara, was an illiterate man who was 38 years old when she was born. Her mother, Annie Honoria Healy, was 28 and worked as a dressmaker. The unusual surname Barnacle is derived from the Irish Ó Cadhain, usually anglicised as Coyne, Kyne, or Cohen or Coen. But in Irish, means &quot;wild goose&quot;, and some families made the translation to Barnacle, after the barnacle goose.

From 1886 to 1889, Barnacle&#x27;s parents sent her to live with her maternal grandmother Catherine Mortimer Healy. During these years, she began studies at a convent, eventually graduating from a national school in 1891. In 1896, 12-year-old Barnacle completed her schooling and began to work as a porteress and laundress. In the same year, her mother threw her father out for drinking and the couple separated. Barnacle went to live with her mother and her uncle, Tom Healy, at 4 Bowling Green, Galway. This house has since been converted into a small museum dedicated to Nora.

In 1896, at age 12, Barnacle fell in love with a teenager named Michael Feeney, who died soon after of typhoid and pneumonia. In a dramatic coincidence, another boy she loved, Michael Bodkin, died in 1900 – causing some of her friends to call her &quot;man-killer&quot;. Joyce later referenced these incidents in the final short story in &quot;Dubliners&quot;, &quot;The Dead&quot;. It was rumoured that she sought comfort from her friend, budding English theatre starlet Laura London, who introduced her to a Protestant named Willie Mulvagh. In 1903, she left Galway after her uncle learned of the affair and friendship, and went to Dublin where she worked as a chambermaid at Finn&#x27;s Hotel (later the name of the hotel was used as the title for a posthumously published collection of 10 short narrative pieces written by Joyce, &quot;Finn&#x27;s Hotel&quot;, in 2013).

==Relationship with Joyce==

Barnacle met Joyce on 10 June 1904 while in Dublin and they had their first romantic liaison on 16 June. Joyce later chose 16 June 1904 as the date for the setting for his novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; and the date has come to be known and celebrated around the world as Bloomsday. The 1904 rendezvous began a long relationship that eventually led to marriage in 1931 and continued until Joyce&#x27;s death.

Barnacle&#x27;s and Joyce&#x27;s relationship was complex. They had different personalities, tastes and cultural interests. Of their first meeting, she recalled: &quot;I mistook him for a Swedish sailor – His electric blue eyes, yachting cap and plimsolls. But when he spoke, well then, I knew him at once for just another Dublin jackeen chatting up a country girl.&quot; The numerous erotic letters they exchanged suggest they loved each other passionately. These are also of interest because of Joyce&#x27;s lifelong dislike of swearing and crude language. Joyce seems to have admired and trusted her, and Barnacle clearly loved Joyce and trusted him enough to agree to leave Ireland with him for the Continent. In anticipation of the move to Paris, she began studying French.

In 1904, Barnacle and Joyce left Ireland for continental Europe and the following year set up house in Trieste (at that time in Austria-Hungary). On 27 June 1905, Nora Barnacle gave birth to a son, Giorgio and later to a daughter, Lucia, on 26 July 1907. A miscarriage in 1908 coincided with the beginning of a difficult time for both. Though she remained by his side, and the couple were legally married in London in 1931, she complained to her sister both about his personal qualities and his writings.

In these letters to her sister, she said he drank too much and wasted too much money. As for his literary activity, she lamented that his writings were obscure and lacking in sense. She was always fiercely proud of him, although she occasionally expressed impatience at his meetings with other artists and admitted she would have preferred him to have been a musician—in his youth, he was a talented singer—rather than a writer.

Lucia&#x27;s mental illness, which became acute in the early 1930s, posed another challenge to the couple&#x27;s relationship. Nora believed the condition required hospitalisation, which Joyce opposed. They brought in many specialists, and Lucia was for a time the patient of Carl Jung. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a clinic in 1936. Her father visited her there often, but not her mother. As Nora&#x27;s biographer Brenda Maddox recorded, &quot;Lucia was rarely out of Nora&#x27;s mind. Because she had aroused Lucia&#x27;s most florid schizophrenic reactions, Nora was not allowed to accompany Joyce on his ritual Sunday afternoon visits to Ivry. Not only did this exclude her from any contact with her daughter, it also required her to spend much of each week arranging for someone to accompany Joyce, who could not easily go alone ... Joyce liked to portray himself as safe from Lucia&#x27;s violence as if he was the only other permitted inhabitant of her private world. Yet once when Giorgio went with his father, Lucia saw them and cried, &#x27;Che bello! Che bello!&#x27; then lunged and tried to strangle them.&quot; As Maddox also noted, &quot;There is no record that Nora ever saw her daughter again.&quot;

==Later life and death==
After Joyce&#x27;s death in Zurich in 1941, Nora decided to remain there for the rest of her days. She died in Zurich of acute kidney failure in 1951, at age 67. She was buried at Fluntern Cemetery, by her husband&#x27;s side. Their son Giorgio was buried with them in 1976.

==Legacy==
In 1980, the play &quot;Nora Barnacle&quot; by Maureen Charlton, depicting the life of Barnacle and Joyce, debuted at the Dublin Theatre Festival. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the play as &quot;the finest piece of theatre at this or at other theatre festival since &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; with Siobhán McKenna in 1968&quot;.

In 1988, Nora Barnacle was the subject of a biography by Brenda Maddox, &quot;Nora: A Biography of Nora Joyce&quot;. In 2000, this biography was adapted into a film directed by Pat Murphy, starring Susan Lynch and Ewan McGregor.

In 2004, an erotic letter from Joyce to Barnacle sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for £240,800, a record amount for a modern-day letter at auction.

A novel, &quot;Nora&quot;, by Nuala O&#x27;Connor, was published in 2021.

In 2023, Mary Morrissy published &quot;Penelope Unbound&quot;, a novel which imagined a different outcome to the life of Nora Barnacle and Joyce after they arrived in Trieste in 1904.

Nora Barnacle House Museum: Nora&#x27;s childhood home in Bowling Green, Galway has been converted into a small museum dedicated to her life.

<text>is a Japanese singer-songwriter. She began her career in 2001 with the release of the single &quot;Itoshigo yo&quot; when she was signed with Toshiba-EMI. She has released twelve albums and eleven singles. Rurutia is intensely private; most aspects of her life – including her real name, date of birth, and hometown, are kept private, and she has never appeared on a TV program or held a live concert since her debut. Her mass media appearances have been limited to broadcasts of the Internet radio program &quot;RURUTIA Planet,&quot; which began streaming on her official website after she became independent, interviews with photos posted on her official website, and interviews in music magazines. As for avoiding media exposure, she cites the glamorous world of the public spotlight and her own musical world as being at odds with each other. This, added to her whispered vocals, creates a unique and mysterious artistic persona.

Her pseudonym, Rurutia, is derived from the Tahitian word &#x27;rorotea&#x27; meaning &quot;blissful rain&quot;.

On May 12, 2024, she announced she would be retiring from the music industry on December 31, 2024, and closing her social media accounts at the same time.

<doc id="1027061" wikidata="Q2696072" url="?curid=1027061" title="Ensifer meliloti">
<text>Ensifer meliloti (formerly Rhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium meliloti) are an aerobic, Gram-negative, and diazotrophic species of bacteria. &quot;S. meliloti&quot; are motile and possess a cluster of peritrichous flagella. &quot;S. meliloti&quot; fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia for their legume hosts, such as alfalfa. &quot;S. meliloti&quot; forms a symbiotic relationship with legumes from the genera &quot;Medicago&quot;, &quot;Melilotus&quot; and &quot;Trigonella&quot;, including the model legume &quot;Medicago truncatula&quot;. This symbiosis promotes the development of a plant organ, termed a root nodule. Because soil often contains a limited amount of nitrogen for plant use, the symbiotic relationship between &quot;S. meliloti&quot; and their legume hosts has agricultural applications. These techniques reduce the need for inorganic nitrogenous fertilizers.

==Symbiosis==

Symbiosis between &quot;S. meliloti&quot; and its legume hosts begins when the plant secretes an array of betaines and flavonoids into the rhizosphere: 4,4′-dihydroxy-2′-methoxychalcone, chrysoeriol, cynaroside, 4′,7-dihydroxyflavone, 6′′-O-malonylononin, liquiritigenin, luteolin, 3′,5-dimethoxyluteolin, 5-methoxyluteolin, medicarpin, stachydrine, and trigonelline. These compounds attract &quot;S. meliloti&quot; to the surface of the root hairs of the plant where the bacteria begin secreting nod factors. This initiates root hair curling. The rhizobia then penetrate the root hairs and proliferate to form an infection thread. Through the infection thread, the bacteria move toward the main root. The bacteria develop into bacteroids within newly formed root nodules and perform nitrogen fixation for the plant. A &quot;S. meliloti&quot; bacterium does not perform nitrogen fixation until it differentiates into a endosymbiotic bacteroid. A bacteroid depends on the plant for survival.

Leghemoglobin, produced by leguminous plants after colonization of &quot;S. meliloti,&quot; interacts with the free oxygen in the root nodule where the rhizobia reside. Rhizobia are contained within symbiosomes in the root nodules of leguminous plants. The leghemoglobin reduces the amount of free oxygen present. Oxygen disrupts the function of the nitrogenase enzyme in the rhizobia, which is responsible for nitrogen fixation.

==Genome==
The &quot;S. meliloti&quot; genome contains four genes coding for flagellin. These include &quot;fliC1C2–fliC3C4&quot;. The genome contains three replicons: a chromosome (~3.7 megabases), a chromid (pSymB; ~1.7 megabases), and a plasmid (pSymA; ~1.4 megabases). Individual strains may possess additional, accessory plasmids. Five &quot;S. meliloti&quot; genomes have been sequenced to date: Rm1021, AK83, BL225C, Rm41, and SM11 with 1021 considered to be the wild type. Indeterminate nodule symbiosis by &quot;S. meliloti&quot; is conferred by genes residing on pSymA.

===DNA repair===

The proteins encoded by &quot;E. meliloti&quot; genes &quot;uvrA&quot;, &quot;uvrB&quot; and &quot;uvrC&quot; are employed in the repair of DNA damages by the process of nucleotide excision repair. &quot;E. meliloti&quot; is a desiccation tolerant bacterium. However, &quot;E. meliloti&quot; mutants defective in either genes &quot;uvrA&quot;, &quot;uvrB&quot; or &quot;uvrC&quot; are sensitive to desiccation, as well as to UV light. This finding indicates that the desiccation tolerance of wild-type &quot;E. meliloti&quot; depends on the repair of DNA damages that can be caused by desiccation.

==Bacteriophage==

Several bacteriophages that infect &quot;Sinorhizobium meliloti&quot; have been described: Φ1, Φ1A, Φ2A, Φ3A, Φ4 (=ΦNM8), Φ5t (=ΦNM3), Φ6 (=ΦNM4), Φ7 (=ΦNM9), Φ7a, Φ9 (=ΦCM2), Φ11 (=ΦCM9), Φ12 (=ΦCM6), Φ13, Φ16, Φ16-3, Φ16a, Φ16B, Φ27, Φ32, Φ36, Φ38, Φ43, Φ70, Φ72, Φ111, Φ143, Φ145, Φ147, Φ151, Φ152, Φ160, Φ161, Φ166, Φ2011, ΦA3, ΦA8, ΦA161, ΦAL1, ΦCM1, ΦCM3, ΦCM4, ΦCM5, ΦCM7, ΦCM8, ΦCM20, ΦCM21, ΦDF2, Φf2D, ΦF4, ΦFAR, ΦFM1, ΦK1, ΦL1, ΦL3, ΦL5, ΦL7, ΦL10, ΦL20, ΦL21, ΦL29, ΦL31, ΦL32, ΦL53, ΦL54, ΦL55, ΦL56, ΦL57, ΦL60, ΦL61, ΦL62, ΦLO0, ΦLS5B, ΦM1, ΦM1, ΦM1-5, ΦM2, ΦM3, ΦM4, ΦM5,

<doc id="1027064" wikidata="Q5875979" url="?curid=1027064" title="Hoddle Highway">
<text>Hoddle Highway is an urban highway in Melbourne linking CityLink and the Eastern Freeway, itself a sub-section of Hoddle Main Road. Both of these names are not widely known to most drivers, as the entire allocation is still best known as by the names of its constituent parts: Hoddle Street, Punt Road and Barkly Street. This article will deal with the entire length of the corridor for sake of completion.

The highway is named after the surveyor Robert Hoddle, who planned central Melbourne&#x27;s Hoddle Grid.

==Route==
Hoddle Main Road starts at the intersection with Queens Parade and High Street in Fitzroy North and heads south as Hoddle Street, crossing Eastern Freeway one kilometre later (and from where the Hoddle Highway declaration officially starts). It continues south until the intersection with Wellington Parade and Bridge Road, changing name to Punt Road. It continues south, passing near the Melbourne Cricket Ground, under Citylink in Richmond, across the Yarra River via the Hoddle Bridge through the South Yarra district to where St Kilda Road and Dandenong Road meet at St Kilda Junction (where the highway declaration ends). Hoddle Main Road continues south on the other side of St Kilda Junction as Barkly Street through the St Kilda city centre, to eventually terminate at Marine Parade in Elwood.

==History==
The elimination of the railway crossing at the Clifton Hill railway gates, where Heidelberg-Eltham Road (known today as Heidelberg Road) crossed the Hurstbridge and Whittlesea (now Mernda) railway lines and then Hoddle Street, was approved by the Victorian government on 19 May 1955, instructing the Country Roads Board (later VicRoads) to proceed with the construction of a road overpass. The Board contracted the project to Lewis Construction Co. Pty. Ltd., estimated to cost A£240,000. Work commenced in February 1956, with the southern portion open to traffic in April 1957, and the remaining sections, including the ramps leading to and from Hoddle Street, opening several weeks later in May 1957.

The passing of the &quot;Country Roads Act of 1958&quot; (itself an evolution from the original &quot;Highways and Vehicles Act of 1924&quot;) provided for the declaration of State Highways and Main Roads, roads partially financed by the State government through the Country Roads Board (later VicRoads). Hoddle Main Road was declared a Main Road on 7 September 1960, from Queens Parade in Fitzroy North, along Hoddle Street through Richmond, along Punt Road through South Yarra, and along Barkly Street to Elwood.

Hoddle Main Road (including all its constituent roads) was signed as Metropolitan Route 29 between Fitzroy North and Elwood in 1965.

The passing of the &quot;Transport Act of 1983&quot; updated the definition of State Highways. Hoddle Highway was declared a State Highway by VicRoads in September 1994 within Hoddle Main Road, from Victoria Street in Richmond to the St Kilda Junction in St Kilda, later extended north to the interchange with Eastern Freeway in January 1995; all roads were known (and signposted) as their constituent parts.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared the road as Hoddle Highway (Arterial #6080), beginning at the interchange of Hoddle Street with Eastern Freeway at Clifton Hill and ending at St Kilda Road (Nepean Highway) in St Kilda, while re-declaring the remnants between Clifton Hill and Elwood as Hoddle Main Road (Arterial #5880); as before, all roads are still known (and signposted) as their constituent parts.

===1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan===
The Hoddle Street – Punt Road – Barkly Street corridor was designated in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as the F2 Freeway. Part of the F2 Freeway would have connected St Kilda Junction to the Metropolitan Ring Road at the Hume Freeway (Craigieburn Bypass), via the Hoddle Highway and Merri Creek.

==Hoddle Street Massacre==
In 1987, Hoddle Street was the site of a deadly shooting spree known as the Hoddle Street massacre. The perpetrator, 19-year-old army recruit Julian Knight, killed seven people and injured 19 others during his rampage. He is currently serving seven consecutive terms of life imprisonment.

<doc id="1027065" wikidata="Q3064018" url="?curid=1027065" title="Fabrizio Quattrocchi">
<text>Fabrizio Quattrocchi (9 May 1968 – 14 April 2004) was an Italian mercenary taken hostage and subsequently murdered by insurgents in the Iraq War.

==Hostage taking==
Quattrocchi was taken hostage together with three fellow Italians, Umberto Cupertino, Maurizio Agliana and Salvatore Stefio. They had been working in Iraq as security contractors under contract with DTS Security LLC, a security company incorporated in the U.S. state of Nevada, run by Paolo Simeone (a former Italian Marine and French Legionnaire) and an Italian lawyer, Valeria Castellani. Quattrocchi&#x27;s kidnappers forced him to dig his own grave and kneel beside it wearing a hood as they prepared to film his death, but he defied them by trying to pull off the hood and shouting &quot;Vi faccio vedere come muore un italiano!&quot; - &quot;I&#x27;ll show you how an Italian dies!&quot; He was then shot in the back of the neck.

Cupertino, Agliana and Stefio would later be freed in a bloodless raid by U.S. troops, which Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi said he had approved beforehand.

==Honours==
On 20 March 2006, Quattrocchi was posthumously honored by the Italian president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi with the Gold Medal for Civil Valour, after a proposal by the Home Secretary Giuseppe Pisanu. For the Gold Medal for Civil Valour to be awarded, a specific act of valor is required, and Quattrocchi&#x27;s defiance towards his captors was judged deserving of the award.

==Political implications==
Quattrocchi&#x27;s death became a highly divisive issue among the Italian public, which, despite widespread loathing of both Saddam Hussein&#x27;s late regime and Islamist fundamentalism was mostly averse to participation in the Iraq war. The relatives of the victims of the 2003 Nasiriyah bombing (in which 17 Italian servicemen and two Italian civilians were killed by a truck bomb) complained that while Quattrocchi was awarded the Gold Medal, those Italian soldiers were awarded with the &quot;Croce d&#x27;Onore&quot; (&quot;Cross of Honour&quot;), as posthumous honour, even though they were in service as regular soldiers, unlike Quattrocchi. For this reason, according to them, the victims of the Nasiriyah attack deserved such an honour more than Quattrocchi.

Giuliana Sgrena, an Italian left-wing Extremists journalist who was also kidnapped in Iraq, complained that no similar honour had been awarded to Nicola Calipari, an Italian intelligence agent killed by American friendly fire during the rescue of Giuliana Sgrena. Similarly, Sgrena remarked, neither was Enzo Baldoni, another Italian journalist kidnapped and killed in Iraq, awarded any honour. As the leftist side was not enthusiastic about the award, the rightist parties Alleanza Nazionale and Forza Italia (Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s movement at that time), insisted in their PR campaigns that Quattrocchi was a hero.

<doc id="1027070" wikidata="Q8009120" url="?curid=1027070" title="William Fitzherbert (New Zealand politician)">
<text>Sir William Fitzherbert (15 August 1810 – 6 February 1891) was a New Zealand politician. He served as Minister of Finance, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Speaker of the Legislative Council.

==Early life==

Fitzherbert was born in Dorset, England, on 15 August 1810. He was educated at Sherborne and studied medicine in Paris and London. Late in 1840 or early 1841 he married Sarah Jane Leigh in London. They came to New Zealand in 1841, settling in Wellington.

They later moved to &quot;Willow Bank&quot; a house in Lower Hutt and entertained parliamentarians there (which may account for the street&#x27;s name of &quot;Parliament Street&quot;). The house now has a Historic Places Trust &quot;C&quot; classification.

==Political career==
He was elected an Alderman in the first council election ever held in Wellington in 1842.

===Member of Parliament===



He soon became active in politics, serving both on the Wellington Provincial Council and in the New Zealand Parliament. He was elected to the Wellington Provincial Council for the City of Wellington division at the 1853 New Zealand provincial elections. He was elected to the 2nd Parliament as a representative of the City of Wellington electorate, but resigned part way through the term to successfully seek election as representative for the Hutt electorate, which happened on 31 July 1858. He contested the general election on 29 December 1875 against William Hutchison and obtained 178 votes, with Hutchison receiving 38. He retained the Hutt electorate until his resignation in 1879, so that he could appointed to the Legislative Council. He also served as Colonial Treasurer (Minister of Finance) for the duration of Frederick Weld&#x27;s premiership.

His younger son Henry represented the Hutt electorate from 1884–90. His other son, William, later became Mayor of Lower Hutt.

===Wellington Province===

Fitzherbert was Superintendent of the Wellington Province from 1871 until the abolition of the provinces in 1876. The Palmerston North suburb of Aokautere was once named after Fitzherbert, as he had promoted settlement of the Manawatu. The Fitzherbert East Dairy Factory building still carries the name these days.

===Speaker of the House===
He served as Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1876 until his appointment to the Legislative Council, and then as Speaker of the Legislative Council until his death.

He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1877.

==Death==
Fitzherbert died on 6 February 1891 at his residence in Lower Hutt. He was buried at Lower Hutt cemetery on 10 February next to his late wife, who had died on 21 August 1886.

He was survived by his daughter and two sons; William Alfred Fitzherbert) (mayor) and Henry Samuel Fitzherbert (MP). His only daughter Alice Jane married Sir Patrick Buckley in 1869.

==Memorials==
There are several streets in Wainuiomata bearing his name. The peak of the Eastern Hills dividing Naenae and Wainuiomata and its television relay mast is named Mount Fitzherbert.

== Notable descendents ==

* Henry Samuel Fitzherbert, son, member of parliament
* Mihi Edwards, great-granddaughter, writer, social worker, teacher and kaumātua

<text>The North Western Railway (abbreviated NWR) is one of 19 railway zones in India. It is headquartered at Jaipur. It has a route length of more than across the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana. NWR operates international rail service Thar Express from Jodhpur to Karachi. This zone is the key enabler of the Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor Project by virtue of running railways 1,500 km long Western Dedicated Freight Corridor.

== History ==
In 1882, a -wide metre-gauge line from Marwar Junction to Pali was built by the Rajputana Railway. It was extended to Luni in 1884 and Jodhpur on 9 March 1886. New Jodhpur Railway was later combined with Bikaner Railway to form Jodhpur–Bikaner Railway in 1890, when the Bikaner Princely State and Jodhpur Princely State started constructing the &quot;Jodhpur–Bikaner Railway&quot; within the Rajputana Agency. In 1892, the -wide metre gauge Jodhpur–Bikaner line was commissioned under the Rajputana–Malwa Railway, Jodhpur–Merta Road section was commissioned on 7 April, the Merta Road-Nagaur section on 15 October, and the Nagaur-Bikaner section on 8 December. In 1901, Jodhpur–Bikaner line combined with Jodhpur–Hyderabad Railway, some part of this railway is in Pakistan, leading to connection with Hyderabad of Sindh Province. In 1902–03, the Jodhpur–Bikaner line was extended to Bathinda in 1902–03 to connect it with the metre-gauge section of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway and the metre gauge of North Western Railway Delhi–Fazilka line via Hanumangarh. In 1925, the combined entity Jodhpur and Bikaner Railways was split to function as two independent Railway companies. After Independence, a part of Jodhpur Railway went to West Pakistan. In 1926, the workshop at Bikaner (Lalgarh) was set up to carry out periodic overhauling of metre gauge coaches and wagons. In 1952, on 6 November the Jodhpur–Bikaner line was merged with the Western Railway. Sometime around or prior to 1992, the construction work for the conversion from metre gauge to -wide broad gauge of the Jodhpur–Bikaner line, along with the link to Phulera, were started, and it was already functioning as broad gauge Jodhpur–Merta City–Bikaner–Bathinda line by 2008. In 2002, on 1 October the North Western Railway zone came into existence. In 2012, the Bikaner Heritage Rail Museum was opened at Bikaner to displays items related to the Jodhpur and Bikaner Railway.

In 1884, The &quot;Rajputana–Malwa Railway&quot; extended the -wide metre-gauge Delhi–Rewari section of Delhi–Fazilka line to Bathinda, which was The Southern Punjab Railway Co. opened the Delhi–Bathinda–Samasatta line in 1897. The line passed through Muktasar and Fazilka tehsils and provided direct connection through Samma Satta (now in Pakistan) to Karachi.

On 18 February 2006, Thar Express, an Indian non-stop international passenger train operated weekly by Indian Railways using its own coaches and locomotives, between Jodhpur in India and Karachi in Pakistan.

Earlier, Sindh Mail train operated on this route from 1900 to 1965 when the track was bombed out by the Pakistan Air Force in Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Thar Link Express was run started after 41 years in 2006 based on the earlier rail communication agreement. The rail communication agreement was signed by India and Pakistan in 1976, to ease the soured relations after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 for the successful liberation of Bangladesh by Indian Army. The rail communication agreement is renewable every three years, and currently it is valid until January 2019.

In the 1990s, the Delhi–Jaipur line and Jaipur–Ahmedabad line were converted to broad gauge (BG). In 2007, the line going toward from Phulera to Chittaurgarh was converted to BG.

Between 2008 and 2011, the Bikaner–Rewari line was converted to broad gauge.

In 2009, the metre-gauge Hisar–Sadulpur section was converted to broad gauge.

By December 2017, railways for the first time installed 6,095 GPS-enabled &quot;Fog Pilot Assistance System&quot; railway signalling devices in four most affected zones, Northern Railway zone, North Central Railway zone, North Eastern Railway zone and North Western Railway zone, by doing away with the old practice of putting firecrackers on train tracks to alter train divers running trains on snail&#x27;s pace. With these devices, train pilots precisely know in advance, about the location of signals, level-crossing gates and other such approaching markers.

== Organisation ==
This zone was formed on 1 October 2002, comprising four divisions: Jodhpur and reorganized Bikaner division of the erstwhile Northern Railway zone, and reorganized Jaipur and Ajmer divisions of the erstwhile Western Railway zone.

=== Ajmer railway division ===
The Ajmer railway division, founded on 5 November 1951, has ~9,050 employees handling 48 passenger trains across 141 stations (15 main stations with Computerized Passenger Reservation System), covering the elongated elliptical shaped loop railway network in Marwar region central Rajasthan, from Pushkar to Palanpur via Marwar, and from Palanpur back to Pushkar via Chittorgarh. The main goods traffic are the export of cement from Ajmer district, and rock phosphate and soapstone powder from Udaipur district. The passenger segment handles traffic on the prominent religious and tourist circuit of Ajmer Sharif Dargah, Pushkar, Dilwara Jain Temples at Mount Abu and Ranakpur Jain temple.

=== Bikaner railway division ===

The quantum of traffic is equally split between goods and passenger segment, with food grains, china clay and gypsum being the main outbound goods traffic.

=== Jaipur railway division ===
The Jaipur railway division was formed after merging parts of Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway, Jaipur State Railway and Rajputana–Malwa Railway. It has ~10,250 employees handling 146 trains across 128 stations (14 with Computerized Passenger Reservation System), covering the states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. a very small corner of south west Punjab (Sirsa to Bathinda). 85% of the income is from the passenger traffic.

<text>Thomas Maxwell Henderson (1810 – 27 June 1886) was a New Zealand politician. He was one of the earliest settlers in Auckland. He was a significant entrepreneur, and is the namesake of the Auckland suburb Henderson.

==Early life==
Henderson was born in Dundee, Scotland, in 1810. He was a blacksmith by trade and served his time as an engineer and machine maker. He met the Macfarlane siblings in Perth, Scotland; John, Henry and Catherine (1811–1867). He married Catherine in 1834.

A family conference consisting all the above plus Ann Taylor (née Macfarlane) and her husband decided that they would answer to the advertisements for tradesmen and women to emigrate to New Zealand. They left Gravesend near London on 13 August 1840 on the barque &quot;London&quot;, arriving in Port Nicholson (Wellington) on 12 December. George Henderson, their 15 months old son, had died on the voyage. The Henderson and Macfarlane families went north, heading for Auckland.

==Professional career==

Henderson and his brother-in-law John Macfarlane entered into a professional partnership in 1842, beginning by selling general merchandise and goods for ships. The Henderson &amp; Macfarlane business later grew to include kauri timber milling and shipping, under the name Pacific Island Traders (later known as the Circular Saw Line). In 1844, Henderson &amp; Macfarlane purchased 18,000 acres of West Auckland from Ngāti Whātua in return for goods and a schooner, the &quot;Lucy Dunn&quot;, however the government voided the land sale shortly after, when it was decreed that all purchases of Māori land needed to be done through the central government. In response, Henderson &amp; Macfarlane sought permission from Governor George Grey in 1847 to mill kauri in the vicinity of the Te Wai-o-Pareira / Henderson Creek, Henderson Valley and Waitākere Ranges. Henderson built a sawmill near the conjunction of the Opanuku Stream and Oratia Stream in 1848, around which developed a community, the Henderson&#x27;s Mill Settlement, which became the modern-day suburb of Henderson. When the land became available to purchase from the government in 1853, Henderson &amp; Macfarlane were one of the largest purchasers.

He built the Commercial Hotel on the corner of High Street and Shortland Street in the Auckland CBD at a cost of £2000, and it was at the time considered the most pretentious building in Auckland. In 1858, the hotel was destroyed in a fire, and replaced with a brick building. During the Flagstaff War, he employed about 300 Māori in gumdigging and was credited by other colonists as keeping them from joining Hōne Heke.

John Macfarlane died of a heart attack in 1860, and his place in the company was taken by his elder brother Thomas Macfarlane. The Henderson &amp; Macfarlane company continued to develop; by the year 1865, the Circular Saw Line fleet had 39 vessels. Henderson&#x27;s Mill closed in the latter 1860s, however the community that developed around the area remained. The fleet traded to Australia, China and America. The company also engaged in coconut plantation operations and trading in copra. In 1897 the company merged its trading and plantation business with that of the trading and plantation firm of John T. Arundel, to form the Pacific Islands Company Ltd. The company was based in London with its trading activities in the Pacific.

Henderson assisted in establishing the Bank of New Zealand, the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company, the New Zealand Insurance Company and the Auckland Gas Company.

==Political career==



Henderson was first elected to the Auckland Provincial Council in the City of Auckland electorate on 26 October 1855. He served on the second Council until 18 August 1857. From 26 November 1855 to 10 November 1856, he was a member of the Executive Council. He served another period on the fifth Provincial Council, from 26 November 1865 to 5 June 1867, representing the Northern Division electorate.

He represented the Northern Division electorate in the 2nd Parliament from 27 October 1855 to his resignation on 30 March 1860. He won the resulting 23 May 1860 by-election and continued representing the electorate for the remaining five months of the parliament&#x27;s term.

He was elected again for the 3rd Parliament in January 1861, and the 4th Parliament in February 1866, but he resigned on 5 June 1867. He then represented the Waitemata electorate in the 5th Parliament from February 1871 to 24 April 1874, when he again resigned.

He was a minister without portfolio in the 1861–62 government of William Fox. At the instance of Sir George Grey, who at the time was Premier, he was appointed to the Legislative Council on 25 July 1878 and served until his death in 1886.

==Other activities==
Henderson imported Chinese pheasants (&quot;Phasianus colchicus torquatus&quot;) in 1851 and released them on his property. Around the same time, Walter Brodie imported English pheasants (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;) and released them near Mongonui. Henderson imported another lot of Chinese pheasants in 1856. Pheasants became common game birds in the North Island.

==Death and commemoration==
Henderson suffered a paralytic stroke on 19 June 1886, and died at the residence of George Graham in Wellington on Sunday, 27 June 1886. His body was transferred to Auckland on the SS &quot;Penguin&quot; and buried in Symonds Street Cemetery beside his wife. The Auckland suburb of Henderson is named after Thomas Henderson. Catherine Street in the centre of Henderson is named after his wife. All central Henderson streets were once named after members of the family (e.g. Thomas, Henry, John, Mary and George), but they have either been renamed or removed.

Henderson donated land for a turf club in 1876. The land is these days occupied by the Plumer Domain and Henderson High School.

<doc id="1027077" wikidata="Q5081491" url="?curid=1027077" title="Charles Parker (New Zealand politician)">
<text>Charles Parker (4 March 1809 – 29 June 1898) was a New Zealand politician and a carpenter.

==Early life==

Parker was born at Newent, Gloucestershire, England, on 4 March 1809. His parents were Sarah Potter (17 November 1783 – 16 July 1876), a weaver, and her husband, Edmund Parker (2 November 1767 – 7 November 1853), a builder. Charles was raised in his mother&#x27;s home town of Cheltenham, Gloucester. He trained as carpenter and builder. On 6 April 1837, he married his first cousin Hannah Phipps (22 June 1815 – 14 December 1889) in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

==Emigration to New Zealand==
In 1849 Charles, Hannah and six children sailed on the &quot;Kelso&quot; to Nelson, New Zealand. The family settled in Motueka, where Charles was soon successful in business, becoming a property developer as well as a builder. He paid for other members of the family to immigrate; Sarah Parker, his 73-year-old mother arrived in 1856, and by 1859 five of his brothers and sisters had emigrated with their families.

Parker had become involved in the political life of the colony. He was a member of the Volunteer Reserves and a justice of the peace. He was active in the Anglican Church until the mid-1860s, when his infant son Henry died before he was baptised, and the Anglican priest refused to bury him in consecrated ground. The local Methodist minister agreed to do so and the family switched churches.

==Political career==

 

In 1853 Parker was elected to the Nelson Provincial Council as member for Motueka and Massacre Bay, a seat which he held until 1857. He then represented Motueka (1857–69 and 1873–76). He was elected a member of the 2nd New Zealand Parliament as member for Motueka and Massacre Bay (1855–56), resigning in 1856, and later re-elected as member for the renamed Motueka for the 4th and 5th parliaments (1866–75). Parker was a populist opposed to the class system and supported John Perry Robinson&#x27;s programme of liberalising land purchase to prevent the establishment of large landholdings or latifundia.

Parker&#x27;s local political rival was David Monro, who championed the more conservative &#x27;Supper Party&#x27; and large run holders. In a controversial 1871 election, a recount found Parker and Munro had split the vote equally; the returning officer&#x27;s casting vote returned Monro as MP, but this was overturned following a petition, and Parker was declared elected.

==Family==

Parker retired to pursue business interests; by 1882 he owned of land in Waimea County, valued at £550. He died on 29 June 1898 in Motueka as a man who had become moderately wealthy. A newspaper obituary describes him as having &quot;retained his mental faculties till the last&quot;. Charles and Hannah had 13 children: Charles (1838–1903), Frederick (1839–1905, married Anne Jane Sutcliffe), Elizabeth (1840–1912, married Thomas Boyes), Henry (1842–1866), Ellen (1844–1845), Edward (1845–1845), Walter (1846–1911), Thirza Ann (1849–1929, married Robert William Skilton), Edmund (1851–1923, married Annie Morris), Emily (1853–1923), Jessie (1855–1904), Arthur William (1857–1946, married Eliza Jane Wilson), and Horace (1859–1867).

He was buried at Motueka cemetery on 2 July 1898. His wife Hannah died 14 December 1889, and is also buried at Motueka cemetery.

Their gravestone reads:

Our father and mother&lt;br&gt;
Charles PARKER died 29 June 1898 aged 90 years&lt;br&gt;
Hannah PARKER died 14 December 1889 aged 75 years&lt;br&gt;
also our sister Jessie PARKER died 6 December 1904 aged 49 years.

<text>John Valentine Smith (1824 – 10 February 1895) was a New Zealand landowner, militia leader, and politician.

==Biography==

Smith was born in 1824 at Malta, where his father was with the Admiralty. Smith received his education at public schools in England.

He was involved in Charles Enderby&#x27;s scheme in the late 1840s of turning the Auckland Islands into a Crown colony for Britain. Enderby held the Queen&#x27;s commission as Lieutenant-governor, and Smith as Enderby&#x27;s secretary thus filled the role of colonial secretary. They sailed for the Auckland Islands from Hobart in November 1849 on the &quot;Samuel Enderby&quot;. The scheme was unsuccessful and abandoned after just over two years.

Smith was a significant figure in the Wairarapa region, owning the prominent Lansdowne, Annedale, and Mataikona runs. He was elected on 26 November 1855 to represent the Wairarapa and Hawke&#x27;s Bay electorate in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament, but resigned on 10 March 1858 before the end of his term. He did not serve in any subsequent Parliaments.

Smith was also the leader of the local militia, holding the rank of major. In the 1860s, he gained attention for his push to construct a stockade at Masterton to defend against possible Māori attack. Many people, including Isaac Featherston, the Superintendent of Wellington Province, believed that the construction of stockade would make conflict more likely, but after much work, Smith was able to convince the government to fund the project. The construction, however, was plagued with difficulties, and the final result was unsatisfactory. The stockade never saw action, and has been termed &quot;Major Smith&#x27;s Folly.&quot;

In circa 1883, Smith relocated to Patea, where he died on 10 February 1895.

His son, Harold Smith, was a member of the 19th Parliament.

<doc id="1027081" wikidata="Q5312013" url="?curid=1027081" title="Dudley Ward (judge)">
<text>Charles Dudley Robert Ward (9 July 1827 – 30 August 1913), known as Dudley Ward, was a New Zealand judge and a Member of Parliament. His first wife, Anne Ward, was a prominent suffragist and served as the first president of the New Zealand Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. His second wife, Frances Ellen &quot;Thorpe&quot; Talbot Ward, was a journalist and travel writer who also supported women&#x27;s suffrage.

==Family and education==
Ward was born at sea on board HMS &quot;Primrose&quot; in the Atlantic Ocean on 9 July 1827. He was the eldest son of diplomat, politician, and later governor of Ceylon, Sir Sir Henry George Ward GCMG and Emily Swinburne, and a cousin of William Ward and William George Ward. He was educated at Rugby School and at Wadham College, Oxford (though not being awarded a degree) and completed his legal education at the Inner Temple being called to the Bar in 1853. His grandfathers were Robert Plumer Ward and Sir John Swinburne, 6th Baronet.

==A career in New Zealand==

Ward was married on 26 January 1850, at Rotherhithe, to Anne Titboald, who was born in Exeter. After his admission to the bar, the Wards set out for New Zealand, arriving on 29 September 1854 in Wellington on the &quot;Cordelia&quot;. The following year, he successfully stood for election to the lower house of the 2nd New Zealand Parliament representing the Wellington Country electorate from 15 November 1855. Ward resigned on 22 March 1858 before the end of the term. He did not serve in any subsequent Parliaments.

==Judiciary==
On 1 June 1857, 18 months after his election to Parliament, Ward was appointed chairman of the Courts of Sessions of the Peace for the Province of Wellington and presiding judge of the Magistrate&#x27;s Courts for Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Wairarapa and Wanganui. On 1 January 1864, he was given a two-year appointment as Resident Magistrate at Wellington, the capital. The remainder of his career was appointments as District Judge for a series of individual provinces until, after more than 49 years service, his retirement in March 1906, aged almost 79, on a pension of £800 per annum.

=== Supreme Court ===
Ward was appointed Acting Supreme Court Judge on four occasions: September 1867 Dunedin; September 1886 Auckland; September 1887 Christchurch; March 1894 Dunedin again.

He had been involved in the parliamentary &quot;Ward-Chapman&quot; enquiry of 1874–75 after he laid certain charges of gross partiality against Justice Chapman of the Supreme Court. Chapman retired in 1875.

Ward declined a permanent appointment on the Supreme Court bench in June 1896, the offer being received just after the death of his wife, and he declined an Acting Supreme Court judgeship in the following year.

==Private life and second wife==
Ward was a tall man of strong build. He stood tall and weighed . In the 1880s and 1890s, the Wards had a house in the Christchurch suburb of Burwood; it was said that they &quot;scarcely spoke to each other&quot;. Later, they had a house in Park Terrace in the Christchurch Central City. He is rumoured to have had several mistresses and Judge Chapman wrote about him:

Ward&#x27;s first wife Anne Ward died in Christchurch on 31 May 1896 and was buried at Burwood Cemetery.

Ward bought a house in the Dunedin suburb of Maori Hill for one of his mistresses, the writer Frances Ellen Talbot, better known under her pseudonym Thorpe Talbot (1851–1923). The house was held in the name of a farmer who Ward knew, and within a month of his wife&#x27;s death, Ward&#x27;s name was added to the title. On 6 January 1902, Ward and Talbot were married at that house, and Ward lived in it for the rest of his life.

==Death==
Dudley Ward died at his residence in Dunedin on 30 August 1913 aged 86. There were no children from either marriage. His widow sent his body to Christchurch to be buried next to his first wife. The gravestone reads:

His second wife was removed from her home after her husband&#x27;s death and became impoverished. She died in Dunedin 1923.

<doc id="1027082" wikidata="Q197124" url="?curid=1027082" title="Zhabei">
<text>Zhabei, formerly romanized as Chapei, is a neighborhood and a former district of Shanghai with a land area of and a resident population of 847,300 as of 2013. It is the location of the Shanghai railway station, one of the main railway stations of Shanghai. On November 4, 2015, Zhabei was merged into the smaller but more central Jing&#x27;an District.

Historically, the district has been highly populated with working class residents. However, due to the shift in the structure of industries and increasing number of immigrants from outside Shanghai, partly due to its reasonable real estate price (compared to its counterparts such as Putuo and Hongkou), the district has become increasingly appealing to city residents.

== Economy ==
Zhabei local authorities have developed business and commercial centres in the district. It has attracted various foreign companies to build offices, apartments and commercial retail outlets over there.

It is also where the Shanghai Multimedia Valley (SMV) is located to attract media and IT talent. Major companies located in Zhabei include TÜV Rheinland, Royal Philips Electronics and Shanghai Bell Alcatel Business Systems Co., LTD.

China Resources Beverage, the distributor of C&#x27;estbon water, has its east China regional office on the twentieth floor of the Huanzhi International Building () in the district.

The League of Legends Pro League, (LPL) the highest level of professional &quot;League of Legends&quot; in Mainland China, is played in the Shanghai Electric Industrial Park in Zhabei District.

==Facilities==
Zhabei District used to be the place of agglomeration of traditional industries such as flavor factory and tires factory. In the last decade, the municipality decided to move the old industry out in order to make space for more promising ones such as the hi-tech and creative industries.

Daning Lingshi Park, the biggest green area in the downtown area, is surrounded by a series of cultural facilities such as the Zhabei Stadium and Shanghai Circus World.

The Shanghai University, Yanchang Campus is also located near the Daning Lingshi Park.

<text>William Wells (1810 – 21 January 1893) was a New Zealand politician.

==Early life==
Wells came to Nelson in the early 1840s and purchased land in Wakapuaka, north of Nelson, from the New Zealand Company, which he kept all his life. He farmed a property there. He returned to live in England for some time. He was a part owner of the Dun Mountain Railway.

==Politics==


Wells was a member of the Nelson Provincial Council. From August 1855 to August 1857, he represented the Suburban District. From October 1857 until November 1861, he represented the Suburban North electorate.

The nomination for the in the Wairau electorate was set for 19 November, and this is the date recorded in the standard reference book, the &quot;New Zealand Parliamentary Record, 1840–1984&quot;, for the election of Wells, but that election did not happen. The mail did not reach the Wairau Valley in time, and the electors did not know about the election. The new date for the nomination meeting was set as 6 December. Wells was one of many members of the House of Representatives who resigned in early 1858; he placed a public notice to that effect in the 20 March edition of &quot;The Nelson Examiner&quot;. At the opening of the second session of the 2nd Parliament on 10 April 1858, the speaker read out 14 resignations, including that of Wells. The resulting by-election was won by Wells&#x27; predecessor, Frederick Weld. Wells later represented the Suburbs of Nelson in the 3rd Parliament and the 4th Parliament, from 1861 to 1870, when he retired.

==Death==
He died on 21 January 1893, aged 82 years, at his property Marybank in Wakapuaka and was buried two days later at Wakapuaka Cemetery.

<text>Xuhui District is a core urban district of Shanghai. It has a land area of and a population of 1,113,078 as of 2020. Xuhui District has 12 subdistricts and two townships.

The Xuhui District is named after its namesake, the historic area of Xujiahui. Xujiahui was historically land owned by Ming dynasty bureaucrat and scientist Xu Guangqi, and later donated to the Roman Catholic Church. It and Luwan District jointly formed the core of Catholic Shanghai, centered in the former French Concession of Shanghai. Vestiges of the French influence can still be seen in the St. Ignatius Cathedral of Shanghai, Xuhui College, the Xujiahui Observatory, and some remaining boulevards and French-style districts.

Xujiahui itself has been redeveloped as a financial center, with a proliferation of large-scale shopping centers and department stores, and is now a major shopping destination in the city with shopping malls such as Grand Gateway Shanghai and Pacific Sogo.

== History ==
Parts of today&#x27;s Xuhui District were once the premier residential districts of Shanghai. The former French neighborhoods in parts of Xuhui today constitute some of the city&#x27;s most popular café areas, including places such as pedestrian Tianzifang. After the revolution, however, the large estates near Xujiahui were turned into factories. In the 1990s, the Shanghai municipal government developed the district as a commercial zone. A once-prominent commercial area in the district was the Xiangyang Crafts and Gifts Market, a haven for souvenirs and intellectual property-infringing products; it was closed on June 30, 2006, by municipal authorities.

== Economy ==
Xujiahui itself has been redeveloped as a financial center, with a proliferation of large-scale shopping centers and department stores, and is now a major shopping destination in the city with shopping malls such as Grand Gateway Shanghai and Pacific Sogo.

Home Inn has its headquarters in Xuhui. Yum China has its headquarters in the Yum China Building () in Xuhui District. Toei Animation Shanghai has its head office in Unit 807 of Feidiao International Plaza in the district. miHoYo has its headquarters in Xuhui. Yoozoo Games is headquartered in Xuhui. Previously Web International English had its headquarters in Xuhui.

== Township-level subdivisions ==

<text>John Williamson (25 August 1815 – 16 February 1875) was a New Zealand politician, printer and newspaper proprietor. He was a leading opponent of the 1860s wars against Māori and lost his newspaper and fortune as a result.

==Early life==
Williamson was probably born on 25 August 1815, or possibly February 1815, in Newry, County Down, Ireland. 

==Career==
He served his apprenticeship as a printer. He married Sarah Barre in either 1833 or 1834, and they were to have five children. 

===New South Wales===
The family emigrated to Sydney, New South Wales, in 1840, where Williamson worked for the &quot;Australasian Chronicle&quot; and then the &quot;Sydney Monitor&quot;. He moved on to Auckland, New Zealand, in mid-1841.

===New Zealand===
He purchased his own printing press in 1845 and started the &quot;New-Zealander&quot;, which became Auckland&#x27;s leading newspaper. The editorial approach of the &quot;New-Zealander&quot;, was to support the ordinary settler and the Māori.

He was joined by partner W. C. Wilson in 1848, until Wilson left to found the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; in 1863. The &quot;New-Zealander&quot; ceased after a fire on 7 May 1866. A coroner&#x27;s hearing concluded there was insufficient information to determine the cause, though evidence was given of an unknown person running away. In 1867 the &quot;Evening Post&quot; wrote, &quot;It was a combination of leading men in Auckland—notably the business men—that killed the New Zealander, causing heavy loss to its actual proprietor and those conducting it. Why? It ventured to have an opinion, and to maintain it.&quot;



He was a member of the Auckland Provincial Council in the first council from 22 July 1853, representing the Pensioner Settlements electorate. He served until 15 November 1856 as a councillor. He was, over three periods, the fourth Superintendent of Auckland Province (1856–1862 resigned; 1867–1869 defeated; 1873–1875 died). On 28 December 1865, he became a member of the Auckland Executive Council as commissioner of waste lands under Frederick Whitaker as Superintendent, until he succeeded him in 1867 following his resignation.

Williamson represented the Pensioner Settlements (consisting of the Auckland suburbs of Howick, Onehunga, Ōtāhuhu, and Panmure) in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament from 1855 to 1860, and represented the City of Auckland West electorate in the 3rd Parliament, the 4th Parliament, and the 5th Parliament from 1861 to 1875 (in 1871 the election was declared void, but he was then re-elected).

He was briefly a minister without portfolio in the second Fox Ministry in July/August 1861. He died in 1875, while he was a Member of Parliament. He was buried in Symonds Street Cemetery.

<doc id="1027093" wikidata="Q727536" url="?curid=1027093" title="Sinai and Palestine campaign">
<text>The Sinai and Palestine campaign was part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I, taking place between January 1915 and October 1918. The British Empire, the French Third Republic, and the Kingdom of Italy fought alongside the Arab Revolt in opposition to the Ottoman Empire, the German Empire, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It started with an Ottoman attempt at raiding the Suez Canal in 1915 and ended with the Armistice of Mudros in 1918, leading to the cession of Ottoman Syria.

Fighting began in January 1915, when a German-led Ottoman force invaded the Sinai Peninsula, then occupied by the British as part of a Protectorate of Egypt, to unsuccessfully raid the Suez Canal. After the Gallipoli campaign, British Empire veterans formed the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) and Ottoman Empire veterans formed the Fourth Army, to fight for the Sinai Peninsula in 1916. In January 1917 the newly formed Desert Column completed the recapture of the Sinai at the Battle of Rafa. This recapture of substantial Egyptian territory was followed in March and April by two EEF defeats on Ottoman territory, at the First and Second Battles of Gaza in southern Palestine.

After a period of stalemate in Southern Palestine from April to October 1917, General Edmund Allenby captured Beersheba from the III Corps. The Ottoman defences were captured by 8 November, and the pursuit began. EEF victories followed, at the Battle of Mughar Ridge, 10 to 14 November, and the Battle of Jerusalem, 17 November to 30 December. Serious losses on the Western Front in March 1918, during Erich Ludendorff&#x27;s German spring offensive, forced the British Empire to send reinforcements from the EEF. The advance stalled until Allenby&#x27;s force resumed the offensive during the manoeuvre warfare of the Battle of Megiddo in September. The successful infantry battles at Tulkarm and Tabsor created gaps in the Ottoman front line, allowing the pursuing Desert Mounted Corps to encircle the infantry fighting in the Judean Hills and fight the Battle of Nazareth and Battle of Samakh, capturing Afulah, Beisan, Jenin and Tiberias. In the process the EEF destroyed three Ottoman armies during the Battle of Sharon, the Battle of Nablus and the Third Transjordan attack, capturing thousands of prisoners and large quantities of equipment. Damascus and Aleppo were captured during the subsequent pursuit, before the Ottoman Empire agreed to the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918, ending the Sinai and Palestine campaign. The British Mandate of Palestine (1920-1948) and the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon were created to administer the captured territories.

The campaign was generally not well known or understood during the war. In Britain, the public thought of it as a minor operation, a waste of precious resources which would be better spent on the Western Front, while the peoples of India were more interested in the Mesopotamian campaign and the occupation of Baghdad. Australia did not have a war correspondent in the area until Captain Frank Hurley, the first Australian Official Photographer, arrived in August 1917 after visiting the Western Front. Henry Gullett, the first Official War Correspondent, arrived in November 1917.

The long-lasting effect of this campaign was the Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, when France won the mandate for Syria and Lebanon, while the British Empire won the mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine. The Republic of Turkey came into existence in 1923 after the Turkish War of Independence ended the Ottoman Empire. The European mandates ended with the formation of the Kingdom of Iraq in 1932, the Lebanese Republic in 1943, the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan and Syrian Arab Republic in 1946, and the State of Israel in 1948.

== Background ==
Since 1805, Egypt had been a de facto independent state under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, though it remained de jure part of the Ottoman Empire. The United Kingdom&#x27;s occupation of Egypt from 1882 severely curtailed Egypt&#x27;s de facto independence, but did not alter its legal status, with the Egyptian Khedive technically remaining a vassal of the Ottoman Sultan. Seeking to end the British occupation of the country, Khedive Abbas II sided with the Ottoman Empire upon the latter&#x27;s entry into the First World War on the side of the Central Powers. This prompted the United Kingdom to depose Abbas, terminate the still persisting legal fiction of Ottoman sovereignty over Egypt, and declare the re-establishment of the Sultanate of Egypt, with Hussein Kamel, uncle of the deposed Khedive, as Sultan. The sultanate was to be administered as a British protectorate, with all matters pertinent to the war effort controlled exclusively by the United Kingdom. The Suez Canal was of vital strategic importance to the British, reducing the sailing time from India, New Zealand and Australia to Europe. As a result Egypt became a major base during the war, particularly during the Gallipoli campaign. To Germany and the Ottoman Empire the canal was the closest and weakest link in British communications. Defence of the canal posed a number of problems, with its sheer size alone making it hard to control. There was no road from Cairo, while only one railway track crossed the of desert from Cairo to Ismaïlia on the canal before branching north to Port Said and south to Suez. Control of the central area around Ismaïlia was of great strategic importance because these three canal towns relied on fresh water from the Nile via the Sweet Water Canal to the main gates and sluices near there.

At the beginning of hostilities between Britain and the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the 30,000-strong British defence force evacuated the part of the Sinai Peninsula that was east of the canal, concentrating their defences on the western side of the canal. The British force comprised the 10th, and 11th Indian Divisions, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade, the Bikaner Camel Corps, three batteries of Indian mountain artillery and one Egyptian artillery battery. These were supported by the guns of Allied ships in the canal. Opposing them were around 25,000 men, including the 25th Division. The Ottoman Empire demonstrated its interest in being reinstated in Egypt in 1915 when Ottoman forces attacked British forces in Egypt. The Germans also helped to foment unrest among the Senussi in what is now Libya, when they attacked western Egypt and threatened the Sudan during the Senussi campaign.

===Egypt&#x27;s contribution to the war effort===
Egypt was neither an independent ally nor a member of the British Empire and as such held a unique position amongst the belligerents. The recently appointed High Commissioner Sir Reginald Wingate and Murray agreed that Egypt&#x27;s contributions would be restricted to the use of the country&#x27;s railway and Egyptian personnel. However, Maxwell had proclaimed on 6 November 1914 that Egypt would not be required to aid Britain&#x27;s war effort. Martial law allowed the British administration to control foreign European residents, monitor foreign agents and intern dangerous persons who were the subjects of hostile nations. The powers were also used to police prostitution and the sale of alcohol. The Capitulations, however provided some protection to the Europeans who controlled both these industries. In the autumn of 1917 GHQ was transferred from Cairo to the front leaving garrison battalions. This move took the commander in chief of the EEF, who was responsible for martial law, out of touch with the civil authorities, and unrest in Egypt became serious during the winter of 1917/18.

By 1917, 15,000 Egyptian volunteers were serving in the Egyptian Army, deployed mainly in the Sudan with three battalions in the EEF, along with 98,000 labourers, 23,000 of whom were serving overseas. The number of Egyptian enlistments could not be increased as conscription could threaten the production of much needed food and cotton and the stability of Egypt. Also by this time, much of the railway lines in Egypt that were not crucial to the production of cotton, sugar, cereals and forages, had already been lifted and used on the military railway, except the Khedivial Railway from Alexandria to Dabaa which was available for emergencies. The Egyptian Labour Corps and the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps had performed invaluable service during the Sinai campaign and would perform even greater service and hardships during the coming Palestine campaign. As the war dragged on and the fighting moved beyond the Egyptian border, many Egyptians felt the war no longer concerned them. At the same time the increasing need for Egyptian personnel turned volunteers into forced labour, although &quot;highly paid,&quot; in a system controlled by the local &quot;mudirs.&quot;

==Defence of the Suez Canal (1915–16)==
From 26 January to 4 February 1915 the Suez Canal was attacked by a large force of the Ottoman Army. Beginning on 26 and 27 January, two smaller flanking columns of the Ottoman Army made secondary attacks near Kantara in the northern sector of the Canal and near Suez in the south. These were followed by the main attacks on 3 and 4 February, on the Suez Canal to east of the Suez to Kantara Railway. Kress von Kressenstein&#x27;s Ottoman Suez Expeditionary Force advanced from Southern Palestine to arrive on the Canal on 2 February when they succeeded in crossing the Canal near Ismailia on the morning of 3 February 1915.

Only two Ottoman companies successfully crossed the canal, the rest of the advance party abandoning attempts to cross as a result of the strong British defence by 30,000 men of the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade and the Bikaner Camel Corps supported by Egyptian Army and Indian mountain artillery. The British then amassed troops at the scene which made another crossing impossible. The Ottoman companies held their positions until the evening of 3 February 1915, when the commanding officer ordered them to withdraw. The retreat proceeded &quot;orderly, first into a camp ten km east of Ismailia&quot;.

Subsequently, Ottoman advance troops and outposts were maintained on the Sinai peninsula on a line between El Arish and Nekhl, with forces at Gaza and Beersheba. During the next few months Kress von Kressenstein commanded mobile units and launched a series of raids and attacks in an attempt to disrupt traffic on the Suez Canal.

Colonel Kress von Kressenstein did all he could to keep the British occupied, launching an attack on 8 April 1915 when a mine was placed in the Suez Canal, which was located and disabled by a patrol, and between 5 and 13 May 1915 he personally led a charge. During the Gallipoli campaign these tactics were abandoned. Von Kressenstein also demanded German special forces, which were promised to arrive in February 1916, to prepare another expedition against the Canal. He moved to the headquarters of the Fourth Army in Ain Sofar in August, then to the new headquarters in Jerusalem, and waited for the German specialists. However, the Ottoman line of communication was extended towards Egypt, with the completion of the section of the Ottoman railway to Beersheba, which was opened on 17 October 1915.

=== British defences extended ===
Von Kressenstein&#x27;s raids confirmed the impracticality, identified by Lord Kitchener, Secretary of State for War, in November 1914, of defending the Suez Canal from the western side. Near the end of 1915, with the Gallipoli campaign drawing to an end, Cabinet authorised new positions to be established in the desert about east of the Canal, strengthening defence of the canal against long range guns, and agreed to provide additional troops.

Port Said became headquarters of these new defences, with an advanced headquarters at Kantara. The defences were organised into three sectors:
* No. 1 (Southern): Suez to Kabrit HQ Suez – IX Corps
* No. 2 (Central): Kabrit to Ferdan HQ Ismailia – I ANZAC Corps (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps)
* No. 3 (Northern): Ferdan to Port Said – XV Corps

At the end of 1915 General Sir John Maxwell, with headquarters at Cairo, had responsibility for troops in the Egyptian Delta, the Western Desert and the Sudan and administered martial law over the whole region including the Suez Canal. The British War Office controlled the Levant Base which was responsible for administering British Empire forces in Salonika, Gallipoli, Mesopotamia and India, and had its headquarters at Alexandria. The retreating forces on Gallipoli and divisions from the United Kingdom formed the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force commanded by Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Murray with headquarters at Ismailia. After the evacuation from Gallipoli the total British force in Egypt was nearly 400,000 men in 13 infantry and mounted divisions, a force regarded as the strategic reserve for the whole Empire. In March 1916, Sir Archibald Murray took command of all these forces which were united into the new Egyptian Expeditionary Force.
Murray believed a British advance into the Sinai to occupy Qatiya/Katia would be more cost effective than the static defences recently established. The War Office agreed to this, but not to his more ambitious plan to advance to the Ottoman border. He believed that the area captured in an advance to El Arish or Rafa could be held with fewer troops than would be needed for a passive defence of the Suez Canal. Murray had estimated a force of 250,000 could cross the Sinai and that 80,000 troops could be maintained in the Katia area. If such a large Ottoman force were to reach Katia then the British would need a very large force to defend the Suez Canal. British occupation of the oasis area which stretched eastwards from Romani and Katia to Bir el Abd along the ancient silk road would deny drinking water to any Ottoman invasion force.

Murray planned a 50,000-strong garrison in the Katia area and obtained authority to build a pipeline to pump fresh Nile water and a railway to transport the infantry divisions and their supplies. He also decided to empty the water cisterns at Moya Harab so the central Sinai route could not again be used by Ottoman columns advancing from Palestine and to maintain some troops at Suez to defend the town. These operations began in February 1916 when construction started on the stretch of 4-foot 8 inch standard gauge Sinai railway and water pipeline from Qantara/Kantara to Qatiya/Katia. By the end of March or early in April of track, including sidings, had been laid.

=== Raid on Jifjafa ===
The intact water cistern and wells on the central road across Sinai still enabled Ottoman Army forces to threaten the Canal at any time. Between 11 and 15 April, 25 Bikaner Camel Corps, 10 Engineers with 12 men from 8th Light Horse Regiment and 117 men from 9th Light Horse Regiment (30 light horsemen armed as Lancers), with 127 Egyptian Camel Transport Corps travelled to destroy a well-boring plant, gyns erected on the wells, the water wells and pumping equipment at Jifjafa. They captured an Austrian engineer officer and 33 men, four of whom were wounded, and killed six Ottoman soldiers. On 9 June 1916 units from No. 2 Section of the Canal Defences formed the Mukhsheib column, consisting of part of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, 900 camels, non-fighting units and camel transport escorted by one squadron of 9th Light Horse Regiment and 10 Bikaner Camel Corps. The engineers drained pools and cisterns of five million gallons of water in the Wadi Mukhsheib, sealed the cisterns to prevent them refilling during next season&#x27;s rains and returned on 14 June. At the same time a detachment of Middlesex Yeomanry advanced to Moiya Harab. With the central Sinai route now denied to them, Ottoman forces could only advance towards the Suez Canal along the northern coast.

=== Occupation of Romani ===
Kress von Kressenstein launched a surprise attack on Easter Sunday, also Saint George&#x27;s Day, 23 April 1916, east of the Canal and north of El Ferdan Station. The yeomanry 5th Mounted Brigade were guarding the water pipeline and railway being built out into the desert towards Romani. While the three regiments were widely dispersed, squadrons were surprised and overwhelmed at Katia and Oghratina, east of Romani, suffering the loss of about two squadrons.

Fighting for the oases area during a raid on Katia and Oghratina demonstrated its importance to both sides. From a base in the oases a large number of Ottoman troops could threaten the Suez Canal, and control the Sinai Peninsula with the threat of a flank attack. The Australian 2nd Light Horse Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades of Major General Harry Chauvel&#x27;s Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division (Anzac Mounted Division) were ordered to occupy the Romani area the day after the fighting at Katia and Oghratina. Here, from Kantara, they aggressively patrolled and reconnoitred the area. The Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade arrived at Romani on 28 May 1916.

Until the railway and water pipeline to Pelusium Station and Romani were built, all water, food (mainly bully beef and biscuits, as packing and transport methods did not allow fresh meat and vegetables), shelters, other equipment and ammunition had to be carried to this position by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps. With flies attracted to horse litter, etc., provision of safe sanitation was a constant battle. Incinerators were constructed to burn refuse by stacking used bully beef tins filled with sand. During this period men had to patrol constantly despite poor diet, severe weather conditions, little shelter from the sun and very few rest periods.

During May 1916 Ottoman aircraft flew over the Suez Canal dropping bombs on Port Said which caused 23 casualties. On 18 May, the Ottoman occupied town and aerodrome at El Arish was bombed by order of Colonel W.G.H. Salmond, commander of the 5th Wing, in reprisal for the first Ottoman raids, and on 22 May the Royal Flying Corps bombed all camps on a front parallel to the canal. By the middle of May the railway had been completed to Romani, making it possible to bring up enough stores and equipment to deploy the 52nd (Lowland) Division there. As soon as they arrived they began to dig trenches in the sand, creating a defensive line with redoubts from Mahemdia near the Mediterranean coast, south to Katib Gannit a high point in front of Romani.

Ottoman Army units retaliated to the increased British Empire presence at the beginning of June, with the first of many air raids on Romani killing eight troopers from the 1st Light Horse Brigade and wounding 22. About 100 horses were also lost. At this time the forward Ottoman air base was at Bir el Mazar, east of Romani.

=== Sinai reconnaissances May and June 1916 ===
Early reconnaissances by the ANZAC Mounted Division covered considerable distances from Romani as far as Oghratina, to Bir el Abd and Bir Bayud. The longest raid was made on 31 May 1916 by the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade to Salmana, covering in 36 hours.

After the middle of May and in particular from mid June to the end of July the heat in the Sinai desert ranged from extreme to fierce. Even worse for the British were the Khamsin dust storms which blow once every 50 days for a few hours or several days, turning the atmosphere into a haze of floating sand particles flung about by a hot southerly wind. The ANZAC troops and their commanders, unused to the conditions, suffered considerably from heatstroke and thirst during these early patrols. One such patrol, returning during the hottest part of the day after a sleepless night far from base, and very little water, suffered casualties of 160 men who collapsed from heat exhaustion.

An important innovation in the getting of water, which enabled the mounted units to operate more effectively over wide areas of rocky desert areas and sand dunes on reconnaissance, was the Spear Point, developed by Australian Engineers designed to be attached to a pump:

A 2 ½ inch pipe was pointed, perforated and covered with a sheet of fine perforated brass. This was driven down into the water area by means of a small pulley bar and monkey, or by a sledge–hammer; and additional lengths of pipe were added if necessary. The ordinary General Service &quot;Lift and Force Pump&quot; was then attached. This arrangement proved so efficient that &quot;Spear Points&quot; were issued to every Squadron in the Division, and the RE Troops carried a number of them. Our men were thus enabled to get water at any of the hods in the desert in a very short space of time.

Once the brackish water was found, a medical officer assessed it as either drinking water, horse water or not fit for horses, and signs were erected.
In June, the 1st Light Horse Brigade carried out reconnaissances to Bir Bayud, Sagia and Oghratina, to Bir el Abd, Hod el Ge&#x27;eila, Hod um el Dhauanin and Hod el Mushalfat. Another routine reconnaissance by 2nd Light Horse Brigade took place on 9 July to El Salmana. Just ten days later, El Salmana was occupied by Ottoman Army units as they concentrated for the Battle of Romani.

In the middle of June the No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps began active service with &quot;B&quot; Flight at Suez doing reconnaissance work and on 9 July &quot;A&quot; Flight was stationed at Sherika in Upper Egypt with &quot;C&quot; Flight based at Kantara.

=== Battle of Romani ===

The battle of Romani took place near the Egyptian town of that name east of the Suez Canal, from shortly after midnight on 3/4 August until the invading force retired during the late morning and afternoon of 5 August. The Central Powers force of Austrians, Germans and Ottomans, led by Kress von Kressenstein, sought to stop the British Empire reclaiming the Egyptian territory of the Sinai Peninsula and cut the Suez Canal by bringing it within artillery range. It numbered 12,000, mainly from the 3rd Infantry Division, with Bedouin irregulars, German machine-gunners and Austrian artillery from Pasha 1. Romani was defended by the 52nd (Lowland) Division, and the 1st, and 2nd Light Horse Brigades. The canal was defended by the 5th Mounted, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades and the 5th Light Horse Regiment.

Sustained fighting began in the early hours and by about 11:00 on 4 August, the Austrian, German and Ottoman force had pushed the two Australian brigades back to a point where the 52nd (Lowland) Division in their trenches were able to attack the attackers&#x27; right flank, and the New Zealand Mounted Rifle and 5th Mounted Brigades arrived in time to extend the Australian Light Horse&#x27;s line. The Ottoman advance was stopped by the combined Allied fire from the infantry and mounted troops, deep sand, the mid summer mid day heat and thirst. In mid summer desert conditions, the British infantry were unable to move effectively to pursue the retreating columns the next day and alone, the Anzac Mounted Division was unable to attack and capture Von Kressenstein&#x27;s large force which made an orderly retreat to Katia and eventually back to their base at Bir el Abd. Bir el Abd was abandoned on 12 August 1916 after fierce fighting, during an attack by the Anzac Mounted Division on 9 August, at the extremity of British Empire lines of communication. This was the first substantial Allied victory against the Ottoman Empire in World War I, ending the Defence of the Suez Canal campaign. The Canal was never again threatened by land forces during the remainder of the war. The Allies then went on the offensive for seven months, pushing the Ottoman Army back across the Sinai Peninsula, fighting the Battles of Magdhaba and Rafa before being stopped on Ottoman soil in southern Palestine at the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917.

== Arab Revolt ==

In early June 1916, the Sharifian Army of Sherif Hussein, Amir of Mecca, launched attacks on the Ottoman garrisons in Mecca and Jeddah in the south western Arabian Peninsula. Jeddah fell quickly allowing the Royal Navy to use the port. Fighting in Mecca lasted three weeks. A large Ottoman garrison held out at Taif until late September when they capitulated, while Sherif Hussein&#x27;s third son Feisal attacked the Ottoman garrison at Medina. The British were keen to extend the Arab Revolt by destabilizing sections of the Ottoman Empire through which the Hejaz Railway ran north – south, from Istanbul to Damascus and on to Amman, Maan, Medina and to Mecca. The railway, built with German assistance to carry pilgrims, was not only important for Ottoman communications but contained solidly-built stone station buildings which could form defensive positions. With the balance of power in northern Sinai moving in favour of the British, the Sherif was encouraged to seek support for his revolt from as far north as Baalbek, north of Damascus. In London, the War Office, hoping to foment unrest throughout the Ottoman Arab territories, encouraged Murray&#x27;s plan to advance to El Arish.

== Sinai campaign of manoeuvre warfare ==
At the conclusion of the Battle of Romani on 12 August 1916, the Ottoman Army had been pushed back to its forward position at Bir el Abd, the last oasis in the series stretching from the Romani area. The Ottomans&#x27; main forward base was pushed back to El Arish, with a fortified advanced post at Bir el Mazar, where a small group of wells which reliably provided water. El Arish was the target of an air raid on 18 June 1916 by 11 aircraft of the 5th Wing under Colonel W. G. H. Salmond. The planes flew out to sea until east of El Arish, then turned inland to approach from the southeast. Two Ottoman aircraft on the ground and two of the ten aircraft hangars were set on fire; bombs hit four others and troops were also attacked. Three British aircraft were forced to land, one in the sea.

The Egyptian Expeditionary Force required huge amounts of ammunition and supplies and a reliable source of water for an advance to El Arish. To provide this, the British Royal Engineers built a railway and pipeline across the Sinai Peninsula to El Arish under the leadership of Brigadier-General Everard Blair. From the middle of August to the Battle for Magdhaba on 23 December 1916, British forces waited for this necessary infrastructure to be put in place. These four months have often been described as a period of rest for the Anzac Mounted Division as there were no major battles. However, the mounted troops were busy providing screens for the construction, patrolling newly occupied areas and carrying out reconnaissances to augment aerial photographs to improve maps of the newly occupied areas.
During one of the patrols, on 19 August, a group of 68 Ottoman soldiers was found half dead from thirst by the 5th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) who, rather than attacking them, gave them water and their rides. The commanding officer and his men led the Ottoman Army soldiers on their horses for through deep sand until met by transport. &quot;This was a very queer sight and worthy of a moving picture [of these] poor sacrifices of the Huns.&quot;

British infantry was brought forward to fortify and provide garrisons along the length of the railway. They formed a firm base for mobile operations and defence in depth for the huge administrative organisation advancing with the railway, in support of the Anzac Mounted Division and the 52nd (Lowland) Division. The movement of the infantry across Sinai was eased by construction of wire netting roads also used by Egyptian Labour Corps, light vehicles, cars, and ambulances. This reasonably stable surface, which did not sink, was constructed from two or four rolls of rabbit wire; one inch mesh wire rolled out side by side, wired together with the edges fixed into the sand with long steel or wooden pegs to produce a reasonable track.

Although the front had moved eastwards across the Sinai, it was still necessary to maintain defence units on the Canal. While serving as part of Canal Defence at Gebel Heliata, Serapeum, the 12th Light Horse Regiment commemorated 28 August: &quot;Today being the Anniversary of the Regiment landing on Gallipoli, a little latitude was given to all hands, and an enjoyable evening was spent in the men&#x27;s canteen.&quot; By September 1916, the German and Ottoman Empires had renegotiated their agreements to recognise the increasing Ottoman forces being deployed in Europe, while German and Austrian aid and equipment was increased to strengthen the Ottoman army in Palestine.

German aircrews of the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; bombed Port Said on 1 September 1916 and Australian and British airmen answered with a bombing raid on Bir el Mazar three days later, when twelve bombs silenced the anti-aircraft guns and blew several tents to pieces. Bir el Mazar was again bombed on 7 September. As part of the advance across the Sinai, the Australian Flying Squadron&#x27;s &quot;B&quot; Flight moved their hangars from Suez forward to Mahemdia (4 miles from Romani) on 18 September; &quot;C&quot; Flight moved to Kantara on 27 September 1916.

=== Medical support ===
Advances in military medical techniques included the surgical cleaning (or debridement) of wounds, with delayed primary surgical closure, the Thomas Splint which stabilized compound leg fractures, the use of intravenous saline which had begun in 1916 and blood transfusions to prevent or even reverse the effects of shock. Casualties were transported from the regimental aid post close to the firing line to an advanced dressing station in the rear by the stretcher bearers of the field ambulances attached to the light horse and mounted brigades. Evacuations back to the railway line which stretched across the Sinai, were undertaken in horse-drawn ambulances, in sand sledges or in cacolets on camels, which was described as &quot;a form of travel exquisite in its agony for wounded men because of the nature of the animal&#x27;s movement&quot;.

=== Condition of the horses ===
There was a progressive improvement in horsemanship during the summer and autumn of 1916 indicated by the small number of animals evacuated from the Anzac Mounted Division after the strenuous marching and fighting from August after the Battle of Romani, during the capture of El Arish and the Battle of Magdaba. This improvement was augmented by regular inspections by administrative veterinary officers when the advice offered was followed by regimental commanders. During the year the average loss of sick horses and mules from the Sinai front was approximately 640 per week. They were transported in train loads of thirty trucks, each holding eight horses. Animals which died or were destroyed while on active service were buried from the nearest camp unless this was not practicable. In this case the carcasses were transported to suitable sites away from troops, where they were disembowelled and left to disintegrate in the dry desert air and high temperatures. Animals which died or were destroyed in veterinary units at Kantara, Ismalia, Bilbeis and Quesna were dealt with in this way and after four days&#x27; drying in the sun, the carcases were stuffed with straw and burnt, after the skins were salvaged and sold to local contractors.

=== Creation of Eastern Frontier Force ===
In September 1916, General Murray moved his headquarters from Ismailia on the Suez Canal back to Cairo in order to deal more efficiently with the threat from the Senussi in the Western Desert. General Lawrence was transferred to France where he served as Chief of Staff to Field Marshal Haig in 1918. Field Marshal William Robertson, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, set out his global military policy at this time in a letter to Murray of 16 October 1916, in which he stated &quot;I am not intent on winning in any particular quarter of the globe. My sole object is to win the war and we shall not do that in the Hedjaz nor in the Sudan. Our military policy is perfectly clear and simple ... [It] is offensive on the Western Front and therefore defensive everywhere else&quot;.

In this climate of defensive military policy, Major-General Sir Charles Dobell, who had acquired a reputation for sound work in minor operations, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general, given the title of GOC Eastern Frontier Force and put in charge of all the troops on the canal and in the desert. His headquarters was established at Ismailia and he began to organise his command into two parts, the Canal Defences and Desert Column. In October, Eastern Force began operations into the Sinai desert and on to the border of Palestine. Initial efforts were limited to building a railway and a waterline across the Sinai. The railway was constructed by the Egyptian Labour Corps at the rate of about a month and the British front moved eastward at the same speed. By 19 October the Anzac Mounted Division Headquarters was at Bir el Abd where the 52nd (Lowland) Division joined them on 24 October.

===Raid on Bir el Mazar===

A reconnaissance in force to Bir el Mazar was carried out by the 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades, the 1st Battalion, of the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade (ICCB), the New Zealand Machine Gun Squadron and the ICCB&#x27;s Hong Kong and Singapore Battery, on 16–17 September 1916. At the limit of their line of communication the light horse, infantry, machine guns and artillery were not able to capture the 2,000 strong, well entrenched garrison which made a determined stand. After demonstrating the strength of the advancing army, they successfully withdrew back to Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s Headquarters at Bir Sulmana to the west. The Ottoman force abandoned Bir el Mazar shortly after. The report of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade described their 5th Light Horse Regiment being fired on by anti-aircraft guns during the operations and reported one man killed and nine wounded. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade recorded that the troops of the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade and the artillery battery were unable to move quickly enough to take part in the attack, and their brigade lost three killed, three wounded and two injured. Airmen of No. 1 and No. 14 Squadrons confirmed anti-aircraft guns fired on the light horse, describing the ground engagement as so tough the Ottoman Army soldiers resorted to this extreme measure, turning their anti-aircraft guns away from the attacking planes. The Ottoman soldiers withdrew to the Wadi al-Arish, with garrisons at Lahfan and Magdhaba.

=== Raid on Maghara Hills ===
As the Allies advanced, an Ottoman-occupied position on the right flank at Bir El Maghara south east of Romani, began to be a threat to their advance. Major-General A.G. Dallas was put in command of a column of 800 Australian Light Horse, 400 City of London Yeomanry, 600 Mounted Camelry and 4,500 camels from the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, with another 200 camels for the Army Medical Corps. The column formed at Bayoud and moved off on 13 October on a two-night march via Zagadan and Rakwa to the Maghara Hills.

On arrival, A and C Squadrons of the 12th Light Horse Regiment deployed in the centre, with the 11th Light Horse Regiment on the right and the Yeomanry on the left flanks, dismounted at the foot of the hills. Handing over their lead horses in excellent cover these dismounted men then scaled the heights and surprised the defenders but failed to capture the main defensive position. The 11th Light Horse Regiment captured seven Ottoman prisoners and three Bedouins, retiring the way they came to base on 17 October and back to railhead Ferdan on the Suez Canal, on 21 October 1916.

=== Aerial bombing of Beersheba ===

Subjected to further bombing air raids, by 2 October aerial reconnaissance photographs revealed the German aircraft hangars formerly at El Arish had disappeared. By 25 October there was no anti-aircraft fire reported over El Arish and reductions in the Ottoman–German force based there were apparent. By this time the railway construction was well past Salmana where a British forward aerodrome was under construction and No. 1 Squadron were involved in photographing the area around El Arish and Magdhaba, and No. 14 Squadron were reconnoitering Rafah.

On 11 November a Martinsyde and nine B.E.2c&#x27;s, loaded with bombs and petrol, left the Kantara and Mahemdia aerodromes at dawn and assembled at Mustabig, just west of Bir el Mazar. There a raiding force of five B.E.2c&#x27;s and the Martinsyde formed the largest force yet organised by Australians or any other air squadron in the East, filled up with petrol and bombs and set off in formation towards Beersheba. Over Beersheba the anti-aircraft guns engaged them with high explosive and shrapnel; the raiders flew through a flurry of white, black and green bursts. The Martinsyde dropped a bomb fair in the centre of the aerodrome; two bombs hit tents; others made direct hits on the railway to Beersheba and the station. A Fokker and an Aviatik took to the air but were driven off. After photographing Beersheba and the damage caused by the bombs, the airmen returned, reconnoitring Khan Yunis and Rafah on the way. All machines arrived safely, after having spent seven hours in flight. Two days later a German aeroplane retaliated by bombing Cairo.

=== Railway building: Sinai ===
On 17 November EEF railhead reached east of Salmana from Kantara, the water pipeline with its complex associated pumping stations built by Army Engineers and the Egyptian Labour Corps had reached Romani. Bir el Mazar, formerly the forward base of the Ottoman Army was taken over by the Anzac Mounted Division on 25 November 1916 the day before railhead. By 1 December the end of the most recently laid railway line was east of Mazar from Kantara. The Ottomans constructed a branch railway line running south from Ramleh, on the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway, to Beersheba, by relaying rails taken from the Jaffa–Ramleh line. German engineers directed the construction of stone ashlar bridges and culverts when the line was extended from Beersheba. It had almost reached the Wadi el Arish in December 1916 when Magdhaba was captured.

=== Battle of Magdhaba, December 1916 ===
On 21 December, after a night march of , part of the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade and the Anzac Mounted Division commanded by Chauvel entered El Arish, which had been abandoned by the Ottoman forces, who retreated to Magdhaba.

The Turkish outpost of Magdhaba was some to the southeast into the Sinai desert, from El Arish on the Mediterranean coast. It was the last obstacle to the Allied advance into Palestine.

The Desert Column under Chetwode also arrived that day. Chauvel, with the agreement of Chetwode, set out to attack the Turkish forces at Magdhaba with the Anzac Mounted Division. Leaving at about midnight on 22 December, the Anzac Mounted Division was in a position by 0350 on 23 December, to see Ottoman campfires still some miles away at Magdhaba.

With the 1st Light Horse Brigade in reserve, Chauvel sent the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade to move on Magdhaba by the north and north–east to cut off of retreat, while the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade followed the telegraph line straight on Magdhaba. The 1st Light Horse Brigade reinforced the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade in an attack on the redoubts, but fierce shrapnel fire forced them to advance up the wadi bed. By midday all three brigades and a section of the Camel Brigade, with Vickers and Lewis Gun sections and HAC artillery were engaged in fierce fighting. Aerial reconnaissance to scout out the Ottoman positions greatly assisted the attack, although the six redoubts were well camouflaged.

After tough fighting in the morning of 23 December, at about 13:00, Chauvel heard that the Turks still controlled most of the water in the area. It is claimed at this time that he decided to call off the attack. But at about the same time, after a telephone conversation between Chauvel and Chetwode, all British units attacked, and there was no doubt that the Turks were losing. Both the 1st Light Horse Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade made progress, capturing about 100 prisoners, and by 15:30 the Turks were beginning to surrender. By 16:30 the whole garrison had surrendered, having suffered heavy casualties, and the town was captured. The victory had cost the EEF 22 dead and 121 wounded.

=== Battle of Rafa, January 1917 ===

On the evening of 8 January 1917, mounted units of Desert Column including the Anzac Mounted Division, the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, the 5th Mounted Yeomanry Brigade, No. 7 Light Car Patrol and artillery, rode out of El Arish to attack the next day 9 January, a 2,000 to 3,000-strong Ottoman Army garrison at El Magruntein also known as Rafa or Rafah.

Also on 9 January four British aircraft bombed the German aerodrome at Beersheba during the afternoon and in the evening, on the way back, saw a considerable Ottoman force near Weli Sheikh Nuran.

The British had reclaimed the northern section of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula virtually to the frontier with the Ottoman Empire, but the new British government of David Lloyd George wanted more. The British Army in Egypt was ordered to go on the offensive against the Ottoman Army in part to support the Arab revolt which had started early in 1916, and to build on the momentum created by the victories won at Romani in August and Magdhaba in December 1916.

This next strategic objective was on the border of the British Protectorate of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire some distant, too far for infantry and so the newly formed Desert Column commanded by Chetwode was to attack the Ottoman position along the coast.

The Allied troops captured the town and the fortified position by nightfall with the loss of 71 killed and 415 wounded. The Ottoman garrison suffered heavily, with 200 killed and another 1,600 taken prisoner.

=== End of Sinai campaign ===
The first signs of a major reorganisation of the Ottoman Army&#x27;s defences were observed after the capture of El Arish and Battle of Magdhaba, on 28 December 1916 when reconnaissance planes found Ottoman forces moving their headquarters back. Days before the victory at Rafa, on 7 January air reconnaissance reported Ottoman forces still at El Auja and El Kossaima with the garrison at Hafir El Auja being slightly increased. But between 14 and 19 January Beersheba was bombed several times by No. 1 Squadron Australian Flying Corps in day and night raids; during one of these raids dropping twelve 20–lb. bombs directly on the biggest German hangar. After these raids the German airmen evacuated Beersheba and moved their aerodrome to Ramleh. And on 19 January air reconnaissance reported the Ottoman Army had evacuated El Kossaima and were in decreased strength at the major desert base at El Auja.
One of many retaliatory air raids carried out by German/Ottoman airmen, occurred over El Arish on the same day, 19 January when the horse lines were targeted. Horse lines were easy and obvious targets from the air; they continued to suffer heavily from air raids throughout the war.

Also on 19 January, the first air reconnaissance of the Ottoman army rear over the towns of Beit Jibrin, Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and Jericho was carried out by Roberts and Ross Smith, escorted by Murray Jones and Ellis in Martinsydes. Junction Station was also reconnoitred on 27 January.
By the end of January both sides were carrying out heavy air attacks; the German and Ottoman pilots dropping bombs on the stores depot at the main base at El Arish, and Nos. 1 and 14 Squadrons regularly retaliating on Beersheba, Weli Sheikh Nuran, and Ramleh. The Germans were also bombing the Egyptian Labour Corps and delaying the building of the railway now near El Burj halfway between El Arish and Rafa with the wire road nearly at Sheikh Zowaiid. As a consequence on 3 February, Major General Chauvel was forced to order the cessation of Allied bombing in the hope that retaliations would also cease, so that the work on the rail line and pipeline could continue. The pipeline reached El Arish on 5 February.

In February 1917, the Ottoman Army was observed also building a light railway line from Tel el Sheria to Shellal, near Weli Sheikh Nuran, Sheria becoming the main Ottoman base midway along the Gaza–Beersheba defensive line.

The two final actions of the Sinai campaign took place in February 1917 when General Murray ordered attacks on the Ottoman garrisons at Nekhl and Bir el Hassana. The 11th Light Horse Regiment conducted the raid on Nekhl on 17 February. Meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion (British) of the Imperial Camel Corps, together with the Hong Kong and Singapore (Mountain) Battery, conducted the raid on Bir el Hassana, which surrendered with minimal resistance on 18 February.

==Palestine campaign begins==

The Palestine campaign began early in 1917 with active operations resulting in the capture of Ottoman Empire territory stretching to the north, being fought continuously from the end of October to the end of December 1917. Operations in the Jordan Valley and into the Transjordan, fought between February and May 1918 were followed by the British occupation of the Jordan Valley while stalemated trench warfare continued across the Judean Hills to the Mediterranean Sea. The final Palestine offensive began in mid-September and the Armistice with the Ottoman Empire signed on 30 October 1918.

With the victory at Rafa, Murray had successfully accomplished all his and the War Office&#x27;s objectives; he had secured the Suez Canal and Egypt from any possibility of a serious land attack and his forces controlled the Sinai Peninsula with a series of strongly fortified positions in depth, along a substantial line of communication based around the railway and pipeline, from Kantara on the Suez Canal to Rafa.

However, within two days of the victory at Rafa on 11 January 1917, General Murray was informed by the War Office that, rather than building on the momentum created over the last two and a half weeks by the victories at Magdhaba and Rafa by encouraging him to further advances with promises of more troops, he was required to send the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division on 17 January, to reinforce the Western Front, the decisive theatre where the strategic priority was focused on planning for a spring offensive.

But just a week after the 42nd Division departed, an Anglo-French conference at Calais on 26 February 1917, decided to encourage all fronts in a series of offensives to begin more or less simultaneously with the beginning of the spring offensive on the Western Front. And so the British War Cabinet and the War Office agreed to Murray&#x27;s proposal to attack Gaza but without replacing the departed infantry division or offering any other reinforcements and the attack could not take place until 26 March.

While these political machinations were running their course, the Anzac Mounted Division returned to El Arish not far from the Mediterranean Sea, where there was easy access to plentiful fresh water and supplies. During this period of much needed rest and recuperation after the demanding desert campaign of the preceding ten months, sea bathing, football and boxing together with interest in the advance of the railway and pipeline were the main occupations of the troops from early January to the last weeks of February 1917.
As the British war machine pushed on across the Sinai Peninsula the infrastructure and supporting British garrisons strongly held all the territory they occupied. By the end of February 1917, 388 miles of railway (at a rate of 1 kilometre a day), 203 miles of metalled road, 86 miles of wire and brushwood roads and 300 miles of water pipeline had been constructed. The pipeline required three huge pumping plants working 24 hours a day at Kantara, near a reservoir of 6,000,000 gallons. For local use, the pumps forced the water through 5 inch pipe to Dueidar, through a 6 inch pipe to Pelusium, Romani and Mahemdia and through a 12 inch pipe the main supply was pushed across the desert from pumping station to pumping station. At Romani a concrete reservoir contained a further 6,000,000 gallons, at Bir el Abd 5,000,000 and at Mazar 500,000 and another of 500,000 at El Arish. And with railhead at Rafa, Gaza was by then just twenty miles away, five to six hours for infantry and mounted units at a walk and 2 hours distant for horses at a trot.

=== Sykes–Picot and Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne ===

When the possibility of a British invasion of Palestine was first raised, it became necessary to reach an understanding with France, which also had an interest in Palestine and Syria. As early as 16 May 1916 Sir Mark Sykes, who had studied the political problems of Mesopotamia and Syria, had agreed with M. Picot, formerly a French Consul at Beirut, that Britain would occupy Palestine and France would occupy Syria. They also agreed that an all-arms French contingent would be attached to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force.

Italy&#x27;s initial efforts to participate on the ground in Palestine were rebuffed, but in a secret accord at Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne her allies promised to include her in negotiations concerning the government of Palestine after the war. On 9 April 1917 Italy&#x27;s ambassador in London, Guglielmo Imperiali, finally received approval to send no more than &quot;some three hundred men ... for representative purposes only&quot; to Palestine. In the end, 500 infantry were sent. This included some Bersaglieri, whose famous capercaillie feathers are visible in photographs from the fall of Jerusalem. Their &quot;mainly political&quot; role was to assert &quot;hereditary ecclesiastical prerogatives in connection with the Christian churches at Jerusalem and Bethlehem&quot;. In the fall of 1918, Allenby was willing to accept more Italian help, but although the Italian foreign minister, Sidney Sonnino, made promises, nothing came of them.

=== Eastern Force reorganisation ===
With the departure of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division for the Western Front, its place at El Arish was taken by 53rd (Welsh) Division which transferred from garrison duties in Upper Egypt following the defeat of the Senussi. And the 54th (East Anglian) Division, which had been in the Southern Section of the Suez Canal Defences also moved eastwards to El Arish, while the new 74th (Yeomanry) Division was being formed from dismounted yeomanry brigades in Egypt.
The arrival of 6th and 22nd Mounted Brigades from the Salonika front prompted a reorganisation of Desert Column. Instead of grouping the two new brigades with the 4th Light Horse Brigade (in the process of formation) and the 5th Mounted Brigade to form the new Imperial Mounted division, (established 12 February 1917 at Ferry Post on the Suez Canal under the command of British Army Major General H.W. Hodgson) the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s 3rd Light Horse Brigade was transferred and the newly arrived 22nd Mounted Brigade was attached to the Anzac Mounted Division.

Thus by March 1917 General Charles Dobell commander of Eastern Force had 52nd (Lowland) and 54th (East Anglian) Divisions and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade directly in his command and Desert Column commanded by Chetwode consisting of the 53rd (Welsh) Division commanded by Major General Dallas, Anzac Mounted Division commanded by Chauvel now made up of 1st and 2nd Light Horse, New Zealand Mounted Rifles and 22nd Mounted Yeomanry Brigades and the Imperial Mounted Division commanded by Hodgson now made up of the 3rd and 4th Light Horse with the 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades and two Light Car Patrols. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade rather resented the change, as they lost the connection with their service on Gallipoli via the old name of Anzac.

The Imperial Mounted Division moved up from Ferry Post to join Desert Column at el Burj just past El Arish on the road to Gaza between 28 February and 9 March; the 3rd Light Horse Brigade coming under their orders on 2 March and the Imperial Mounted Division coming under orders of Desert Column on 10 March 1917. The 4th Light Horse Brigade, in the process of formation at Ferry Post, planned to leave on 18 March.

Transport was also reorganised; the horse drawn supply columns were combined with the camel trains so that Eastern Force could operate for about twenty four hours beyond railhead. This was a vast undertaking; one brigade (and there were six) of Light Horse at war establishment consisted of approximately 2,000 soldiers as well as a division of infantry; all requiring sustenance.

=== Ottoman Army units ===

During February British intelligence reported the arrival in the region, of two divisions of the Ottoman Army; the 3rd Cavalry Division (from the Caucasus) and the 16th Infantry Division (from Thrace). They joined three infantry divisions in the area; along the long Gaza–Beersheba line, the Fourth Army had about eighteen thousand soldiers. Kress von Kressenstein allocated some troops to both Gaza and Beersheba, but held the majority in reserve at Tell esh Sheria and Jemmameh and by mid March the Ottoman Army&#x27;s 53rd Infantry Division was on its way south from Jaffa to augment these troops. The garrison at Gaza consisting of seven battalions could muster 3,500 rifles, machine gun companies and five batteries of 20 guns, supported by a squadron of newly arrived German Halberstadt fighter aircraft, which outclassed Allied aircraft and gave the Ottoman Army local air mastery.

It was believed the Ottoman Army had 7,000 rifles supported by heavy field and machine guns with reserves close by at Gaza and Tel el Sheria.

Between the victory at Rafa and the end of February 70 deserters entered the British lines and it was believed that this represented a small proportion as the majority of Arabs and Syrians disappeared into the towns and villages of Palestine and the Transjordan.

== Gaza campaign ==

=== First Battle of Gaza, 26 March ===

The Ottoman Army gave up a small area of the southern Ottoman Empire to retire to Gaza on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea, holding large garrisons spread across the area to Beersheba; to the north east, east, and south east at Hareira, Tel el Sheria, Jemmameh, Tel el Negile, Huj and Beersheba.

While Desert Column&#x27;s Anzac and partly formed Imperial Mounted Divisions stopped Ottoman reinforcements from pushing through to join the Ottoman garrison at Gaza, on 26 March, the 53rd (Welsh) Division supported by a brigade from the 54th (East Anglian) Division attacked the strong entrenchments to the south of the town. In the afternoon, after being reinforced by the Anzac Mounted Division, the all arms&#x27; attack quickly began to succeed. With most objectives captured, night stopped the attack and the withdrawal was ordered before the commanders were fully aware of the gains captured.

The government in London believed reports by Dobell and Murray indicating a substantial victory had been won and ordered Murray to move on and capture Jerusalem. The British were in no position to attack Jerusalem as they had yet to break through the Ottoman defences at Gaza.

=== Hiatus ===
Surrounded by palms and olive groves, Deir el Belah is north east of Khan Yunis and south west of Gaza. From Deir el Belah active patrolling towards Sharia and Beersheba continued. Here the 1st Light Horse Brigade rejoined the Anzac Mounted Division, three Hotchkiss light machine guns were issued to every squadron, substantially increasing the firepower of the mounted infantry and training in their use and gas helmets was carried out. Deir el Belah became the headquarters of Eastern Force after railhead reached there on 5 April and the arrival of the 74th (Yeomanry) Division increased the force to four infantry divisions.

General Murray had created the impression that the First Battle of Gaza had ended better than it had and the defenders had suffered more, with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff William Robertson in London. Continuing inconclusive fighting in France resulted in Murray being encouraged on 2 April to begin a major offensive; to aim for Jerusalem, in the hope of raising morale. By 18 April it was clear Nivelle&#x27;s offensive had not succeeded, the newly democratic Russia could no longer be relied on to attack the German or Ottoman empires freeing them to reinforce Palestine and Mesopotamia, and the resumption of unrestricted German U-boat warfare was sinking 13 British ships a day when the average during 1916 had been only three. This misunderstanding of the actual position in southern Palestine &quot;rest squarely on General Murray for, whether he intended it or not, the wording of the reports fully justifies the interpretation placed upon them.&quot;

=== Second Battle of Gaza, 17–19 April ===

The First Battle of Gaza had been fought by the mounted divisions during an &quot;encounter battle&quot; when speed and surprise were emphasised. Then Gaza had been an outpost garrisoned by a strong detachment on the flank of a line stretching eastwards from the Mediterranean Sea. During the three weeks between the First and Second Battles of Gaza, the town was quickly developed into the strongest point in a series of strongly entrenched positions extending to Hareira 12 miles (19 km) east of Gaza and south east towards Beersheba. The Ottoman defenders not only increased the width and depth of their front lines, they developed mutually supporting strong redoubts on ideal defensive ground.

The construction of these defences changed the nature of the Second Battle of Gaza, fought from 17 to 19 April 1917, to an infantry frontal attack across open ground against well prepared entrenchments, with mounted troops in a supporting role. The infantry were strengthened by a detachment of eight Mark I tanks along with 4,000 rounds of 4.5-inch gas shells. The tanks were deployed along the front to give shelter to the infantry advancing behind them, but as the tanks became targets the infantry also suffered. Two tanks succeeded in reaching their objectives. Although the gas shells were fired during the first 40 minutes of the bombardment on a woodland area it appears they were ineffective.

The strength of the Ottoman fortifications and the determination of their soldiers defeated the EEF. The EEF&#x27;s strength, which before the two battles for Gaza could have supported an advance into Palestine, was now decimated. Murray commanding the EEF and Dobell commanding Eastern Force were relieved of their commands and sent back to England.

=== Stalemate ===

From April to October 1917 the Ottoman and British Empire forces held their lines of defence from Gaza to Beersheba. Both sides constructed extensive entrenchments, which were particularly strong where the trenches almost converged, at Gaza and Beersheba. In the centre of the line, the defences at Atawineh, at Sausage Ridge, at Hareira, and at Teiaha supported each other. They overlooked an almost flat plain, devoid of cover, making a frontal attack virtually impossible. The trench lines resembled those on the Western Front, except they were not so extensive, and they had an open flank.
Both sides reorganised their armies in Palestine during the stalemate and appointed new commanders. The Yildirim Army Group (also known as Thunderbolt Army Group and Army Group F) was established in June, commanded by the German Empire General Erich von Falkenhayn. General Archibald Murray was sent back to England, replaced by Edmund Allenby in June to command the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. Allenby created two separate headquarters, one stayed in Cairo to administer Egypt, while his battle headquarters was established near Khan Yunis. He also reorganised the force into two infantry and one mounted corps. By 28 October 1917 the ration strength of the EEF fighting troops was 50,000. There were a further 70,000 unattested Egyptians.

==== Raid on Ottoman railway ====
The main line of communication south from Beersheba to Hafir el Aujah and Kossaima was attacked on 23 May 1917 when substantial sections of the railway line were demolished by Royal Engineers of the Anzac and Imperial Mounted Divisions. This raid was covered by the two mounted divisions including a demonstration towards Beersheba.

==== Battle of Buqqar Ridge ====

The occupation of Karm by the Allies on 22 October 1917 created a major point for supply and water for the troops in the immediate area. For the Ottoman forces, the establishment of a railway station at Karm placed the defensive positions known as the Hareira Redoubt and Rushdie System which formed a powerful bulwark against any Allied action under threat.

To forestall this threat, General Erich von Falkenhayn, the Commander of the Yildirim Group, proposed a two phase attack. The plan called for a reconnaissance in force from Beersheba on 27 October, to be followed by an all out attack launched by the 8th Army from Hareira. This second phase was ironically scheduled to occur on the morning of 31 October 1917, the day when the Battle of Beersheba began.

== Southern Palestine offensive ==
=== Battle of Beersheba, 31 October ===

The Southern Palestine Offensive began with the attack on the headquarters of the Ottoman III Corps at Beersheba. The town was defended by 4,400 rifles, 60 machine guns, and 28 field guns including cavalry lancer and infantry regiments. They were deployed in well constructed trenches protected by some wire, strengthened by fortified defences to the north west, west, and south west of Beersheba. This semicircle of defences, included well-sited redoubts on a series of heights, up to 4 miles (6.4 km) from the town. These included Tel el Saba east of Beersheba defended by a battalion of the Ottoman 48th Regiment and a machine gun company. They were attacked by 47,500 rifles, in the XX Corps&#x27; 53rd (Welsh) Division, the 60th (2/2nd London) Division and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, with the 10th (Irish) Division and the 1/2nd County of London Yeomanry attached, and about 15,000 troopers in the Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions (Desert Mounted Corps).

After extensive and complex arrangements to support the infantry advance, the 60th (2/2nd London) and the 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions were to attack Beersheba from the west, while the Anzac Mounted Division with the Australian Mounted Division in reserve attacked the town from the east, after riding between 25 and 35 miles (40 to 56 km) to circle around Beersheba. The infantry attacks began with a bombardment and the capture of Hill 1070 which enabled the guns to move forward to target the trenches defending Beersheba. Intense hand to hand fighting continued until 13:30 when the Ottoman trench line on the western side of Beersheba, was captured. Meanwhile, Anzac Mounted Division advanced circling Beersheba, to cut the road north to Hebron and Jerusalem to prevent reinforcement and retreat from Beersheba, and launched their attack on Tel el Saba. The strongly entrenched defenders on Tel el Saba were initially attacked by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, but by 10:00 they had been reinforced by the 1st Light Horse Brigade. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade (Australian Mounted Division) was later ordered to reinforce the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s attack on this Ottoman position, but before they could get into position a general attack began at 14:05, resulting in the capture of Tel el Saba at 15:00.

Orders were issued for a general attack on Beersheba by the dismounted 1st and 3rd Light Horse Brigades and the mounted 4th Light Horse Brigade. As the leading squadrons of the 4th Light Horse Regiment of Victorians, and the New South Wales&#x27; 12th Light Horse Regiment, preceded by their scouts between 70 and 80 yards (64–73 m) in front, came within range of the Ottoman riflemen in defences &quot;directly in their track,&quot; a number of horses were hit by sustained rapid fire. While the 4th Light Horse Regiment attacked these fortifications dismounted after jumping the trenches, most of the 12th Light Horse Regiment on the left rode through a gap in the defences to gallop into Beersheba to capture the garrison.

=== After the capture of Beersheba ===

From 1 to 6/7 November strong Ottoman rearguards at Tel el Khuweilfe in the Judean Hills, at Hareira and Sheria on the plain and at Sausage Ridge and Gaza on the Mediterranean coast held the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in heavy fighting. During this time the Ottoman Armies were able to withdraw in good order covered by strong rearguard garrisons, which themselves were able to retire under cover of darkness on the night of 6/7 November. The British Yeomanry cavalry Charge at Huj was launched against an Ottoman rearguard on 8 November. Allenby ordered the Egyptian Expeditionary Force to advance and capture the retreating Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies, but they were prevented from doing so by the strong rearguards.

The Tel el Khuweilfe battle was an &quot;important sideshow to the collapse of the entire Turkish front from Gaza to Beersheba,&quot; as it diverted Ottoman reserves to the Khuweilfe area, preventing them being used to strengthen the centre of the Ottoman line at Hareira and Sheria. It also threatened an attack on Jerusalem, and placed pressure on the Ottoman command, who moved considerable forces eastwards from Sheria, to reinforce the defence of the road to Jerusalem and Tel el Khuweilfe, too far away to come to the aid of Gaza. By weakening the force defending Sheria it became possible for two infantry divisions and Desert Mounted Corps, all that could be deployed so far from base, to attack the remaining Ottoman forces, &quot;to defeat and pursue it, and hustle it northward to Jaffa.&quot;

=== Advance to Jaffa and Judean Hills ===

An attempt on 12 November by four divisions of the Ottoman 8th Army to counterattack and stop the British advance in front of the vital Junction Station (Wadi Sara) on the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway, was held by the Australian Mounted Division reinforced with two additional brigades.

On 13 November the Egyptian Expeditionary Force attacked a 20,000-strong Ottoman force deployed on a hastily constructed but naturally strong defensive line. The main attack was carried out by the XXIst Corps&#x27;s 52nd (Lowland) and 75th Divisions in the centre with the Australian Mounted Division on the right flank and the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions on the left. The infantry in the centre prevailed supported by a cavalry charge by 6th Mounted Brigade (Yeomanry Mounted Division). And on 14 November the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade defeated a substantial rearguard; the 3rd Ottoman Infantry Division at Ayun Kara. The combined effects of this series of devastating failures by the Ottoman Army was to see their 8th Army give up Jaffa and retire across the Nahr el Auja while their 7th Army withdrew into the Judean Hills to defend Jerusalem. They had withdrawn approximately , losing 10,000 prisoners and 100 guns and suffering heavy casualties.

During the first EEF offensive from October to November 1917, Australian wounded were mainly treated in the 1,040 beds of No. 14 Australian General Hospital at the Abbassia Barracks, Cairo. Although No. 2 Australian Stationary Hospital at Moascar, was organised, equipped, and staffed for any type of medical or surgical work, it was retained as a Camp Clearing Hospital by the D.M.S., EEF. In November, 1917, the venereal section of No. 14 General Hospital was transferred to it.

=== Capture of Jerusalem ===
Jerusalem operations began with the Battle of Nebi Samwill fought between 17 and 24 November, were continued by the subsidiary Battle of Jaffa between 21 and 22 December and ended with the defence of Jerusalem from 26 to 30 December 1917. These battles were ultimately successfully fought by the XX, XXI and the Desert Mounted Corps against the Ottoman 7th Army in the Judean Hills and their 8th Army. Battle lines extended from north of Jaffa on the Mediterranean Sea across the Judean Hills to Bireh and east of the Mount of Olives.

The battlefield over which the Battle of Nebi Samwil was fought continued to be subject to attacks and counterattacks until early December when Jerusalem was occupied by the British. Fighting also continued in the vicinity Bireh and the main Ottoman supply line running along the Jerusalem to Nablus road north of the city.

After the Ottoman Army had evacuated Jerusalem, the city was occupied on 9 December 1917. This was a major political event for the British government of David Lloyd George, one of the few real successes the British could point to after a year of bitter disappointments on the Western Front.

On the Ottoman side, this defeat marked the exit of Djemal Pasha, who returned to Istanbul. Djemal had delegated the actual command of his army to German officers such as von Kressenstein and von Falkenhayn more than a year earlier, but now, defeated as Enver Pasha had been at the Battle of Sarikamish, he gave up even nominal command and returned to the capital. Less than a year remained before he was forced out of the government. Falkenhayn was also replaced, in March 1918.

== Winter 1917–18 ==
=== Administration of captured territory ===
When Allenby first assumed command of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force he quickly joined the army in the field leaving the political and administrative problems related to the Egyptian Mandate to a Government appointee with a suitable staff. The area of formerly Ottoman territory now under occupation also required management, and with the approval of the Government, Allenby appointed a Chief Administrator for Palestine. He divided the country into four districts: Jerusalem, Jaffa, Majdal and Beersheba, each under a military governor. Under this administration the immediate needs of the people were provided for, seed grain and live–stock were imported and distributed, finance on easy terms was made available through the Army bankers, a stable currency was set up and postal services restored.
On 15 January 1918 Allenby reported to DMI regarding attitudes to the occupation of Jerusalem. The report recounted that the Moslems were for the most part non-committal, while the partisans of Sherif were genuinely pleased but worried by Jewish influence. The attitude of Bedouin from East of Jerusalem to Bir El Saba (Beersheba) varied; some were unsatisfactory but the protection of the sacred Moslem places was generally accepted as satisfactory. The Jews were overjoyed by the support contained in the Balfour Declaration for Zionism and Christians were happy with the occupation.

Allenby was under pressure to set up foreign administrations in Palestine. Already the French representative in Palestine, Picot, was pressuring for a share in the administration of a French Protectorate in the Holy Land by pushing to assume the rights and dignities in church which the French representative enjoyed before the war. His presence and behaviour was resented by the Italians and the church representatives became angry. Allenby was aware that in Jerusalem angry priests came to blows in the Holy Places from time to time. He insisted that while military administration was required it must be under the British Commander in Chief alone.

===Consolidation of EEF territorial gains===
The weather was beginning to improve and railways and roads were being repaired and developed. A lateral line of communication north of the Jaffa to Jerusalem road required the complete reconstruction of the track from Amwas through Beit Sira by the Egyptian Labour Corps. The standard gauge line reached Ludd and was within of Allenby&#x27;s headquarters west of Ramleh. He wrote on 25 January: &quot;I want to extend my right, to include Jericho and the N. of the Dead Sea.&quot; On 3 January two Australian aircraft discovered boats carrying corn and hay produced on the plains to the east and south-east of the Dead Sea for the forces at Amman. The boats moving from Ghor el Hadit (behind Point Costigan) and Rujm el Bahr at the northern end of the Sea were bombed and sprayed with bullets by the Australian aircraft which returned again and again until the boat service stopped.

Allenby&#x27;s next strategic moves were to extend his right to include Jericho, then to cross the Jordan River and advance to Amman and destroy of the Hedjaz railway to isolate Ottoman forces near Medina and encourage further Arab uprisings.

The whole British advanced base of operations had moved north from Deir el Belah to the new railhead and at Ramleh the Director of Medical Services&#x27; headquarters were also the headquarters of the Motor Ambulance Convoy. Thirteen casualty clearing stations and stationary hospitals had been established along the lines of communication from Jaffa and Jerusalem to Kantara and by March 1918 ambulance trains ran to Kantara from Ludd.

=== Westerners versus Easterners ===
By the end of 1917 all the objectives of the campaign to capture Jerusalem had been achieved; Ottoman-German operations against Baghdad had been frustrated, the last reserves of Ottoman soldiers were engaged and the British nation&#x27;s morale had been boosted.

The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George, wished to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war in 1918. Already the 7th (Meerut) Division from Mesopotamia was ordered to Palestine and there were many who were worried that if significant forces were diverted from the Western Front to Palestine, England might protect her colonies but lose the war.

The Westerners argued that the real heart of the Ottoman Empire, Istanbul, still lay hundreds of miles from an advance to Damascus or even Aleppo and if the Ottoman Empire saw at the same time Germany overrunning France, it would not be enough to force the Ottoman Empire from the war. With Russia out of the war the Dardanelles were no longer an objective for the British Empire as access to the Russian fleet was no longer of any importance.

The Easterners accepted that it was essential to maintain the forces in France and Belgium on the Western Front, but that they were already sufficient to keep the front intact. They argued that &#x27;to surrender the initiative everywhere and to concentrate on a policy of purely passive defence along the whole battle line was a counsel of despair.&#x27; Germany would have a brief window of opportunity thanks to the armistice between Russia and Germany, to attack the Allied forces on the Western Front before the United States, which had already entered the war could bring sufficient numbers to end Germany&#x27;s war. But the Easterners asserted that during two years of war the Allies had superiority in numbers and material greater than the numbers the Germans could bring from the Russian front and they had failed to break the German lines. They argued that the Palestine theatre might be wasteful of shipping but the Western Front was wasteful of lives; that it would be folly to take seasoned troops from Palestine where a decisive victory could be won to die in the stalemate.

On 13 December 1917 the War Cabinet instructed the General Staff to consider two policies; the conquest of Palestine involving an advance of about or an advance to Aleppo to cut the Ottoman communications with Mesopotamia. On 14 December Allenby reported that the rainy season would prevent any further attacks for at least two months.

Qualified approval from the Supreme War Council for a decisive offensive to annihilate Ottoman armies and crush resistance was contained in Joint Note No. 12. It was claimed that the destruction of the Ottoman Empire &#x27;would have far-reaching results upon the general military situation.&#x27; Early in February 1918 General Jan Christiaan Smuts (a member of the Imperial War Cabinet) was sent to confer with Allenby regarding the implementation of the Joint Note. The French imposed an important qualification on the Joint Note; that no British troops in France could be deployed to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. Smuts informed Allenby the intention was to reinforce the Egyptian Expeditionary Force with one and possibly a second Indian cavalry division from France, three divisions from Mesopotamia and more artillery and aeroplanes. Smuts also suggested crossing the Jordan, capturing the Hejaz Railway and using it to outflank Damascus.

== Judean Hills operations ==
=== Action of Tell &#x27;Asur, 8–12 March ===

Also known as the Battle of Turmus &#x27;Aya, this action fought between 8 and 12 March pushed the Egyptian Expeditionary Force&#x27; front line all the way from the Mediterranean Sea to Abu Tellul and Mussallabeh on the edge of the Jordan Valley northwards. Allenby&#x27;s right flank was secure but was not sufficiently broad to support the planned operations across the Jordan to the Hedjaz railway; further territory was required to give more depth. During this operation a general advance on a front of and up to a maximum of in depth by both the XX and XXI Corps pushed the 7th and 8th Ottoman Armies north from the River Auja on the Mediterranean coast, from Abu Tellul and Mussallabeh on the edge of the Jordan Valley and up the Jerusalem to Nablus road capturing Ras el Ain.

=== Action of Berukin, 9–11 April ===

General Allenby intended to follow the cutting of the Hedjaz Railway at Amman with an advance to Tulkarm and Nablus and despite the failure of the Amman attack proceeded with plans to capture Tulkarm.

Known by the Ottoman Army as the action of Berukin, the attack between 9 and 11 April, was planned to begin with the 75th Division capturing the villages of Berukin, Sheikh Subi and Ra-fat together with the high ground at Arara. The 7th (Meerut) Division would then advance on a front and prepare gun positions from which to shell Jaljulia and Tabsor. The 54th and 75th Divisions would then advance to the Wadi Qarna with their left flank towards Qalqilye and Jaljulye with the 54th (East Anglian) Division sweeping westward along the Ottoman defences as far as Tabsor. As soon as Jaljulye and Qalqilye were cleared the Australian Mounted Division would ride hard for Et Tire and vigorously pursue the withdrawing Ottoman units as far as Tulkarm.

The 75th Division&#x27;s preliminary attack, launched at 05:10 on 9 April ran into fierce Ottoman resistance supported by three German field batteries and German battalions were active in counterattacks using mortars and machine guns.

All three infantry brigades carried out the initial assault in line against Berukin, El Kufr, Ra-fat and Three Bushes Hill which were successfully captured, while Berukin was finally captured at 16:00. The delay in capturing Berukin slowed the attack of the other infantry brigades and gave the German and Ottoman defenders time to strengthen their defences, and as a result the attacks on Mogg Ridge, Sheikh Subi and Arara were postponed till the next day. During the night there were almost constant counterattacks, but the attack was continued at 06:00 on 10 April when the 2/3rd Gurkhas (232nd Brigade) reached the western edge of Mogg Ridge. Fighting here continued all day and at Sheikh Subi the attack broke down, while further west the attack on Arara had by 09:30 been partly successful. Almost the whole of Mogg Ridge was eventually captured but was successfully counterattacked, the German and Ottoman infantry being caught by determined British defence and a heavy British artillery barrage which prevented them following up their success. Again during the night determined Ottoman and German counterattacks continued and were partly successful. On 11 April it was clear determined defence would strenuously contest all attacks and it decided that the cost of continuing would be too high, but for the next seven days a long-range artillery duel between British and Ottoman/German guns continued. Finally on 21 April Three Bushes Hill was evacuated while Berukin, El Kufr and Ra-fat were retained and consolidated, including the Ra-fat salient.

At the end of two days&#x27; bitter hand-to-hand fighting the 75th Division was still to gain its objectives and was having difficulty holding on to the little it had gained because of fatigue and depleted numbers. Three days&#x27; fighting from 9 to 11 April proved once again that in the Judean Hills German and Ottoman machine guns could make any advance slow and expensive.

This action of Berukin occurred in a section of the line which would become part of the final offensive five months later, when the infantry attack would pivot on Ra-fat salient which would at that time be held by the Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie. In this case, the losses were heavy: 1,500 British casualties with about 200 Ottoman dead on the battlefield and 27 Ottoman and German prisoners.

=== Summer in the Judean hills ===
During the summer of 1918 the main focus of the war was naturally on the Western Front; the Chief of the General Staff (CIGS) at the War Office in London could only offer Allenby railway construction men, and a possible increase in shipping to increase Allenby&#x27;s supplies. Sir Henry Wilson had a plan for extend the railways after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. &quot;I want to see Aleppo joined to Mosul joined to Baku joined to the Urals joined to the Japanese army; and from that base an advance against the Boches.&quot;
At this time the front line stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea. From the middle of May to about the middle of October, the country through which the line passed was virtually dry, but temperatures could vary greatly. On the maritime plain the climate is almost sub-tropical, with sea breezes and an average temperature of . In the Judean Hills temperatures can vary by as much as during a single day, and in the Jordan Valley shade temperatures of between are common, with high humidity. This heat is accompanied in all sections of the line, by dust and insect pests including sand-flies and malarial mosquitoes, which are common along the whole of the front line.

The Palestine front was relatively quiet during the late spring and summer of 1918 with the exception of some brief fighting in midsummer. During the hot summer months of 1918 several British mainly small scale raids were made to improve Allied positions on the coastal plain and in the Judean Hills. These was one small British attack designed to improve the front on the coast, several British raids including one very large scale raid and one minor Ottoman attack.
On 8 June 1918 the 7th (Meerut) Division attacked two hills from the sea. Their objectives were quickly taken after the 03:45 assault on 9 June by 21st (Bareilly) Brigade but the Ottoman defenders counterattacked at 06:40 after heavily shelling the Indian brigade; these counterattacks being repulsed. British casualties were 63 killed and 204 wounded; 110 prisoners were captured along with two heavy and five light machine guns. The two hills which had been useful observation posts to the Ottoman Army units were consolidated and remained in British control.

On 13 July an Ottoman attack on the Ra-fat salient held by the 3/3rd Gurkha Rifles (232nd Brigade) was preceded by one of the heaviest bombardments experienced in Palestine. The bombardment, lasting for just over an hour, began at 17:15 and resulted in the village burning but the Gurkhas met the attackers by immediately rushing their defences. The fighting continued until after dark during which 52 soldiers were killed.

During the night of 27 July a successful raid was carried out by five platoons 53rd Sikhs (Frontier Force) (28th Indian Brigade) against Ottoman trenches on &quot;Piffer Ridge&quot; east of the Mediterranean shore at El Haram. The Ottoman garrison was taken by surprise and 33 captured at the cost of four casualties.

After exhaustive training, on the night of 12/13 August 10th (Irish) Division carried out a raid which consisted of a series of attacks on Ottoman defences on the long Burj–Ghurabeh Ridge just west of the Jerusalem to Nablus road and about from the front line by regiments, brigades, companies and platoons of Indian troops. They were supported by 147 guns and howitzers of the 53rd Divisional Artillery (less two howitzer batteries and the IX British Mountain Artillery Brigade).

One of these attacks on 12 August, was on a long, steep-faced ridge west of the Nablus road, which included Khan Gharabe, and formed a part of the XX Corps&#x27; front where Ottoman defences were virtually continuous. The opposing line was held by 600 rifles of the Ottoman 33rd Regiment (11th Division). The British and Indian infantry force made a descent of several hundred feet before climbing up steep rocky ground. Despite the Ottoman defences being strongly held and well wired, fierce fighting at close quarters ensued, during which the attacks from both flanks were completely successful. Heavy losses estimated to have been 450 were inflicted on the Ottoman units and 250 prisoners captured.

A wire-cutting bombardment began at 21:55 on 12 August and shortly after the 54th Sikhs (Frontier Force)s and two companies of 6th Prince of Wales&#x27;s Leinster Regiment were deployed south east of the ridge on the right flank, while the 1/101st Grenadiers and two companies of 6th Prince of Wales&#x27;s Leinster Regiment at the western end, were over away. The two Indian regiments advanced simultaneously, capturing the flanking Ottoman entrenchments then the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Leinster Regiment companies turned inwards accompanied by a barrage, which also turned inwards from either flank in front of them. Although the two left-hand companies did not reach their objectives the attack was completely successful and the forces withdrawn about 12:15 on 13 August. Captures included 239 prisoners, 14 machine guns and Ottoman casualties were estimated at 450 while the 29th Brigade suffered 107 casualties.

At the same time as the attack was being made to the west of the Nablus road, the 179th and 181st Brigades of the 60th (2/2nd London) Division carried out an attack on a front of east of the Nablus Road mainly without artillery support when a front from Keen&#x27;s Knoll to Kh. &#x27;Amuriye was attacked. Table Hill, Bidston Hill, Forfar Hill Fife Knoll, Kh. &#x27;Amuriye and the village of Turmus &#x27;Aya were all successfully attacked although only eight prisoners were captured at a cost of 57 casualties.

== Jordan Valley operations ==
=== Capture of Jericho, February 1918 ===

Allenby wished to extend his right to include Jericho and the northern part of the Dead Sea. In mid February the 53rd (Welsh) and 60th (2/2nd London) Divisions with the 1st Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades attacked German and Ottoman defences to the east of Jerusalem held by their XX Corps&#x27; 53rd (Welsh) Division. As the infantry attack on Talat ed Dumm and Jebel Ekteif progressed the mounted brigades moved towards the Jordan Valley from Bethlehem; the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade successfully attacking positions at el Muntar and a strong position protecting Neby Musa while the 1st Light Horse reached the Jordan Valley and entered Jericho.

=== Occupation of the Jordan Valley ===

In February the occupation of the valley began, with the Auckland Mounted Rifles Brigade (New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade) remaining to patrol the area, after the Capture of Jericho. During the two Transjordan attacks the Jordan Valley was garrisoned by the Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions, the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions, and the 20th Indian Brigade until September when Chaytor&#x27;s Force began the Third Transjordan attack by advancing to capture Jisr ed Damieh, Es Salt and Amman.

=== First Transjordan advance ===

Before Jericho had been captured Allenby was already planning to push across the Jordan River and &#x27;throw a big raid past Salt against the Hedjaz Railway.&#x27; The First Attack on Amman, as it is known to the British, was referred to by the Ottoman Army as the First Battle of the Jordan. It took place between 21 and 30 March.
Shea&#x27;s Force consisting of the 60th (2/2nd London) and the Anzac Mounted Divisions successfully forced a crossing of the Jordan River, occupied Es Salt, attacked Amman and partly destroyed sections of the Hedjaz Railway some east of Jericho.

The Ottoman 48th Infantry Division together with the 3rd and 46th Assault Companies and the German 703rd Infantry Battalion successfully defended Amman and stopped the advance of Shea&#x27;s Force. With his lines of communication threatened by 2,000 reinforcements moving towards Es Salt from the north the successful retirement was eventually ordered, even though the principal objective; the destruction of a large viaduct at Amman had not succeeded.

The retirement was complete by the evening of 2 April leaving the only territorial gains two bridgeheads at Ghoraniye and Makhadet Hajla. This was the first defeat of units of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force since the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917. Along with the Second Transjordan attack on Es Salt the following month, these two attacks focused attention away from the Mediterranean coastal sector of the line where the British Empire attack in September 1918 would be comprehensively successful.

=== Second Transjordan advance ===
Following the unsuccessful first Transjordan attack on Amman by Shea&#x27;s force, Allenby ordered a reluctant Chauvel to attack Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt with a force one third larger than that which attacked Amman. But in the five weeks between these two operations British GHQ estimated the German and Ottoman forces in the area had doubled.

The second Transjordan attack was equally unsuccessful; risked the capture of one of Allenby&#x27;s mounted divisions but is widely accepted as fulfilling his strategic aim of focusing his opponent&#x27;s attention on the Transjordan area and away from the Mediterranean coast where he would make a successful breakthrough in September.

=== German and Ottoman attack ===

On 14 July two attacks were made by German and Ottoman forces; one in the hills on a salient held by Australian Light Horse which protected front line positions in the valley, where the mainly German force was routed. A second operation was to the east of the Jordan River on the plain, where an Ottoman cavalry brigade had deployed six regiments to attack the El Hinu and Makhadet Hijla bridgeheads. They were attacked by Indian lancers and routed.

== Focus moves to the Western Front ==
The German spring offensive was launched by Ludendorff on the Western Front the same day the First Transjordan attack on Amman began and completely eclipsed its failure. The powerful assault launched on both sides of the Somme by a force of 750,000 collapsed the British front in Picardy held by just 300,000 men. Gough&#x27;s Fifth Army was forced back almost to Amiens. On one day; 23 March German forces advanced and captured 600 guns; in total the British losing 1,000 guns and 160,000 men, suffering the worst defeat of the war. The British War Cabinet recognised at once that the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire must be at least postponed.

The effect of this offensive on the Palestine campaign was described by Allenby on 1 April 1918: &quot;Here, I have raided the Hedjaz railway 40 miles East of Jordan &amp; have done much damage but my little show dwindles now into a very insufficient [insignificant] affair in comparison with events in Europe.&quot; Overnight Palestine went from being the British government&#x27;s first priority to a &quot;side show.&quot;

===Reorganisation of EEF infantry===
The 52nd (Lowland) Division was sent to France in early April. The 74th (Yeomanry) Division along with nine British infantry battalions from each of the 10th, 53rd, 60th and 75th Divisions were sent to France, between May and August 1918. What remained of the divisions were reinforced by British Indian Army battalions to reform the divisions. Infantry brigades were reformed with one British battalion and three British Indian Army battalions, except one brigade in the 53rd Division which consisted of one South African and three British Indian Army battalions.

By April 1918, 35 Indian infantry and two Indian pioneer battalions were preparing to move to Palestine. Those battalions with numbers from 150 upwards, were formed by removing complete companies from experienced regiments then serving in Mesopotamia to form new battalions. The parent battalions also supplied first line transport and experienced officers with war-time service. The 198 men transferred from the 38th Dogras to the 3/151st Indian Infantry, included the commanding officer, two other British and four Indian officers. The sepoys transferred were also very experienced. In September 1918 when the 2/151st Indian Infantry provided an honour guard for Allenby, among the men on parade were some who had served on five different fronts since 1914, and in eight pre-war campaigns. Not all of these Indian battalions served in the infantry divisions, some were employed in defence of the lines of communication.

The complexity of the reorganisation and reformation of these battalions was not without consequences. Of the 54 British Indian Army battalions deployed to Palestine, 22 had recent experience of combat, but had each lost an experienced company, which had been replaced by recruits. Ten battalions were formed from experienced troops who had never fought or trained together. The other 22 had not seen any prior service in the war, in total almost a third of the troops were recruits. Within 44 British Indian Army battalions, the &quot;junior British officers were green, and most could not speak Hindustani. In one battalion, only one Indian officer spoke English and only two British officers could communicate with their men.&quot;

Two British Indian Army divisions arrived in January and April 1918 from the Mesopotamia campaign. They were the 7th (Meerut) Division followed by the 3rd (Lahore) Division. Only the 54th (East Anglian) Division remained, as previously, an all British division.

=== Reorganisation of EEF cavalry ===
The British Indian Army&#x27;s 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions, which had fought on the Western Front since 1914, were disbanded. They were reformed in the Middle East, with yeomanry regiments replacing British regular cavalry regiments, which remained on the Western Front. Nine British yeomanry regiments from the Yeomanry Mounted Division (Desert Mounted Corps) were sent to France to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force fighting the Spring Offensive.

Three of the remaining yeomanry regiments, the 1/1st Dorset Yeomanry, the 1/1st County of London Yeomanry, and the 1/1st Staffordshire Yeomanry, which had previously formed part of the 6th, 8th and 22nd Mounted Brigades, along with newly arrived British Indian Army units transferred from France, formed the 4th Cavalry Division. Another two of the remaining yeomanry regiments, the 1/1st Royal Gloucestershire Hussars and 1/1st Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry which had belonged to the 5th and 7th Mounted Brigades, with newly arrived British Indian Army units transferred from France, and the renamed 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade, formed the 5th Cavalry Division. The 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade had served during the Ottoman Raid on Suez Canal and in the Sinai and Palestine since December 1914, as the &quot;Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade.&quot; Both the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions were assigned to the Desert Mounted Corps which had lost the Yeomanry Cavalry Division during the reorganisation.

Five of the six brigades in the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions were composed of one British yeomanry and two Indian cavalry regiments. The sixth brigade (in the 5th Cavalry Division), the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade, consisted of three regiments of Imperial Service Troops, which represented and were wholly maintained by the Indian Princely states of Jodhpur, Mysore and Hyderabad. Eight of the 18 regiments in the six brigades were armed with and called lancers. The Australian Mounted Division&#x27;s 5th Mounted Brigade was also dismounted and sent to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force in France. It was replaced by the newly formed 5th Light Horse Brigade which consisted of the 14th and 15th Light Horse Regiments, formed from Australians transferred from the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade and the French &quot;Régiment Mixte de Marche de Cavalerie.&quot; Completing this division, the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades consisted of three light horse regiments made up of a headquarters and three squadrons. To conform with the 5th Light Horse Brigade, the 522 troopers in each of these regiments were armed with swords instead of bayonets, and Lee–Enfield rifles.

=== Yildirim Army Group ===
The Ottoman armies in the Yildirim Army Group had been weakened by considerable losses suffered between 31 October and 31 December 1917. The Seventh Army lost 110 officers and 1,886 men killed, 213 officers and 5,488 men wounded, 79 officers and 393 men captured and 183 officers and 4,233 men were missing. This army had also lost 7,305 rifles, 22 light and 73 heavy machine guns and 29 guns. The Eighth Army reported 2,384 wounded but no rifles, machine guns or artillery guns missing. Total Ottoman casualties for the period were 25,337 killed, wounded, captured or missing while British losses for the same period amounted to 18,000 men. During the same period the British reported 70 officers and 1,474 men killed, 118 officers and 3,163 men wounded, 95 officers and 5,868 men captured and 97 officers and 4,877 men missing. This was in spite of odds in favour of the British of well over two to one in infantry and eight to one in cavalry as well as a massive artillery, logistical and naval superiority. It is therefore remarkable that any Ottoman units survived the onslaught and made the Ottoman fighting withdrawal under pressure a great accomplishment.

However, the Yildirim Army Group was still a competent fighting force at the beginning of 1918. Every infantry division which had fought at Beersheba on 31 October was intact and still fighting, although some were considerably reduced in strength. To make up for these losses reinforcements had arrived in December 1917. The 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division and the 1st Infantry Division had been transferred to Palestine from the Caucasus. Indeed, at the end of the Jerusalem campaign the Ottoman soldiers appeared the toughest, most obdurate and most professional of fighters. Training continued and in early February, the 20th Infantry Regiment at regimental level received intensive training in day and night fortification and battle drill.

While Enver Pasa and the Ottoman General Staff remained focused on the offensive, the Ottoman armies remained aggressive and confident. Their front line was held by the Eighth Army with headquarters at Tul Keram defending the Mediterranean coastal sector, the Seventh Army with headquarters at Nablus defending the Judean Hills sector while the Fourth Army with headquarters at Amman (until after the first Transjordan attack on Amman when its headquarters was moved forward to Es Salt) defended the Transjordan sector. But German air superiority ended with the arrival of the S.E.5.a and Bristol fighters, one of which destroyed three German Albatros scouts on 12 December. From January 1918 these British planes increasingly dominated the skies.

The Ottoman high command was dissatisfied with von Falkenhayn, the commander of the Yildirim Army Group in Palestine. He was seen to have been responsible for the defeat at Beersheba and his refusal to allow Ottoman staff officers to participate in planning combat operations rankled. Enver Pasa replaced him on 19 February with General Otto Liman von Sanders and under this new leader, the established &#x27;active, flexible defence&#x27; style was changed to a more unyielding defence.

==== Arrival of a new German commander ====
Liman von Sanders took over command of the Ottoman Army in Palestine from von Falkenhayn on 1 March 1918. On arrival it was apparent to him that the Ottoman front line was particularly weak west of the Jordan and he took immediate action to strengthen both flanks by a redistribution of his forces.

In May 1918, during the lull in fighting after the two Transjordan attacks, from his headquarters at Nazareth, Liman took the opportunity to reorganise the Ottoman army forces in Palestine. The Eighth Army, which was headquartered at Tul Keram under the command of Djevad Pasha (Kress von Kressenstein&#x27;s successor), consisted of the XXII Corps (7th, 20th and 46th Divisions) and the Asiatic Corps (16th and 19th Divisions, 701st, 702nd and 703rd German Battalions). This army held a line running eastwards from the Mediterranean shore for about into the hills at Furkhah. Mustafa Kemal Pasha&#x27;s (Fevzi&#x27;s successor) Seventh Army, whose headquarters were at Nablus, consisted of the III Corps (1st and 11th Divisions) and XXIII Corps (26th and 53rd Divisions), and held the rest of the Ottoman line eastwards from Furkhah to the River Jordan; this represented a front of about , with its main strength on both sides of the Jerusalem to Nablus road.

While holding the front line on the Jordan River the 48th Infantry Division continued training, conducting courses on battle tactics, machine guns, hand grenades, and flame throwers. When the 37th Infantry Division arrived from the Caucasus, the division&#x27;s troops undertook a two-week course on the use of stick grenades near Nablus.

== Arab attacks ==
Arab attacks were made on Maan between 15 and 17 April. During these actions, they captured 70 prisoners and two machine guns, and temporarily occupied the railway station, but failed to capture the main position.

==Megiddo offensive==


As the dry season approached Allenby intended to advance to secure Tiberias, Haifa and the Yarmuk Valley towards Hauran, the Sea of Galilee and Damascus. The peoples inhabiting the region of the Sharon battlefield varied greatly in their background, religious beliefs and political outlook. Living from Jericho northwards, were indigenous Jews in Samaria, Moravians in Galilee &quot;[probably a confusion between two German Protestant groups, the Moravian Brethren who ran a leppers asylum in Jerusalem, and the much more numerous Templers, who had settled mainly in Galilee]&quot;, some Druse, Shi&#x27;a Metawals and a few Nussiri (pagans). In the east were the Bedouin. In Haifa town, about half the population was Muslim and in Acre almost all were Muslim. On the Esdraelon Plain as far as Beisan were Sunni Arabs and one new Jewish colony near Afulah. Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in the foothill country of Northern Galilee. Christians of at least five denominations formed a large majority in and around Nazareth town. The inhabitants of the eastern part of this Northern Galilee area were predominantly indigenous Jews, who had always inhabited Tiberias and Safed. In the region of the Nablus battlefield, the inhabitants from Beersheba to Jericho were also quite diverse. The population was mainly Arab of the Sunni branch of Islam, with some Jews and Christians. At Nablus, they were almost exclusively Moslems excepting the less than 200 members of the Samaritan sect of original Jews. To the east of the Jordan Valley in the Es Salt district were Syrian and Greek Orthodox Christians, and near Amman, Circassians and Turkmans.

Allenby finally launched his long-delayed attack on 19 September 1918. The campaign has been called the Battle of Megiddo (which is a transliteration of the Hebrew name of an ancient town known in the west as Armageddon). The British made major efforts to deceive the Ottoman Army as to their actual intended target of operations. This effort was successful and the Ottoman Army was taken by surprise when the British suddenly attacked Megiddo. As the Ottoman troops started a full-scale retreat, the Royal Air Force bombed the fleeing columns of men from the air and within a week, the Ottoman army in Palestine ceased to exist as a military force.

Despite its name, the actual battlefield of the Battle of Megiddo (1918) was relatively far from the site of the Biblical city. The emphasis on using the name &quot;Megiddo&quot; was, in part, related to the overall propaganda effort to link victory in the Middle-East to the domestically well-known locations from the Bible, and thus boost British morale at home. The battle for &quot;Armageddon&quot; did not receive nearly the attention which might have been expected, however, with Eiten Bar-Yosef stating that, &quot;[e]ven Cyril Falls’s &quot;Armageddon&quot; &quot;1918&quot; (1964), a detailed study of Allenby’s advance, does not elaborate on the metaphor, and it is not difficult to see why: Allenby’s swift progress up to Damascus was certainly not the bloody, colossal, definitive clash envisioned in John’s Revelation; that was taking place in the trenches of the Western Front.&quot;

A number of historians have claimed the offensive which resulted in the capture of the Gaza to Beersheba line and Jerusalem, and the Megiddo operation were similar. In this regard, it is argued that they were both &quot;a cavalry envelopment of the Ottoman flank&quot;, and that the breakthroughs both came at unexpected locations. At Gaza–Beersheba, the breakthrough occurred at the eastern end of the front line at Beersheba instead of Gaza as the Ottomans had expected, while at Megiddo the breakthrough occurred on the Mediterranean coast at the western end of the front line when it was expected across the Jordan.

== Syrian campaign ==
=== Pursuit to Damascus ===
The war in Palestine was over but in Syria lasted for a further month. The ultimate goal of Allenby&#x27;s and Feisal&#x27;s armies was Damascus. Two separate Allied columns marched towards Damascus. The first, composed mainly of Australian and Indian cavalry, approached from Galilee, while the other column, consisting of Indian cavalry and the &quot;ad hoc&quot; militia following T. E. Lawrence, travelled northwards along the Hejaz Railway. Australian Light Horse troops marched unopposed into Damascus on 1 October 1918, despite the presence of some 12,000 Ottoman soldiers at Baramke Barracks. Major Olden of the Australian 10th Light Horse Regiment received the official surrender of the city at 7 am at the Serai. Later that day, Lawrence&#x27;s irregulars entered Damascus.

The inhabitants of the region varied greatly in their background, religious beliefs and political outlook. In the Eastern Hauran, the bulk of the population were Druses, while in the Jaulan, more Circassians, Metawala and some Algerian colonists were living. The southern Jaulan district was poor and rocky, supporting a very small population and groups of nomads from the Wuld Ali in the eastern desert, while the north is more fertile with a large Circassian colony in and around Kuneitra. The north–west Jaulan district contains some Metawala villages and some Algerian colonies in the east, introduced by the Emir Abdul Qadir after he had taken refuge in Damascus in the 1850s. In between these are settled Arabs similar to those in the Nukra plain; while in the east are Bedouin Arabs.

The advances to Amman, during the Third Transjordan attack of the Battle of Megiddo, and to Damascus towards the end of the war, resulted in the highest incidence of malaria &quot;that has ever been suffered by Australian forces.&quot;

=== Capture of Aleppo ===

Aleppo, the third largest city in the Ottoman Empire, was captured on 25 October. The Ottoman government was quite prepared to sacrifice these non-Turkish provinces without surrendering. Indeed, while this battle was raging, the Ottoman Empire sent an expeditionary force into Russia to enlarge the ethnic Turkish elements of the empire. It was only after the surrender of Bulgaria, which put Ottoman Empire into a vulnerable position for invasion, that the Ottoman government was compelled to sign an armistice at Mudros on 30 October 1918, and surrendered outright two days later.

== Summary ==
The British and their Dominions suffered a total of 51,451 battle casualties: 12,873 killed/missing, 37,193 wounded, and 1,385 captured. An additional 503,377 were hospitalized as non-battle casualties, mostly from disease; 5,981 of these died, and most of the rest were returned to duty. It is unknown how many of the non-battle casualties were in serious enough condition to require evacuation out of theater, though comparison to the Mesopotamia campaign (where 19% were evacuated) would suggest the number is around 100,000. Indian non-battle casualties are unknown, while Indian battle casualties were 10,526: 3,842 dead, 6,519 wounded, and 165 missing/captured.

Total Ottoman losses are harder to estimate but almost certainly much larger: an entire army was lost in the fighting and the Ottoman Empire poured a vast number of troops into the front over the three years of combat. American historian Edward J. Erickson, with access to the Ottoman Archives, attempted to estimate Ottoman battle casualties from this campaign in 2001. He did not attempt to estimate losses due to disease for this campaign, but noted that the Ottomans had some 2.66 times the number of disease deaths as KIA throughout the war (466,759 v 175,220), with the highest ratio of non-battle casualties to battle casualties being found in the Caucasus and Mesopotamia. His estimates for Ottoman battle casualties by battle were as follows:
* Sinai 1915: 1,700 (192 KIA, 381 WIA, 727 MIA, 400 POW)
* Sinai 1916: 1,000 (250 KIA, 750 WIA)
* 1st Gaza 1917: 1,650 (300 KIA, 750 WIA, 600 POW)
* 2nd Gaza 1917: 1,660 (82 KIA, 1,336 WIA, 242 MIA)
* 3rd Gaza/Jerusalem 1917: 28,057 (3,540 KIA, 8,982 WIA, 9,100 MIA, 6,435 POW)
* 2nd Jordan 1918: 3,000 (1,000 KIA, 2,000 WIA)
* Megiddo/Syria 1918: 101,300 (10,000 KIA, 20,000 WIA, 71,300 POW)

A total of 138,367 battle casualties (15,364 KIA, 34,199 WIA, 10,069 MIA, 78,735 POW). The WIA figures only include irrecoverable losses (crippled or later died of wounds). Going by the Erickson&#x27;s estimates, total wounded outnumbered seriously wounded by 2.5:1 for the war. Applying that same ratio to the Sinai and Palestine campaign produces a total battle casualty count of about 189,600 (15,364 KIA, 10,069 MIA, 85,497 WIA, 78,735 POW). Furthermore, his listed ratio of disease deaths to KIA implies about 40,900 disease deaths in Sinai-Palestine. This would add up to total casualties of roughly 230,500 (15,364 KIA, 10,069 MIA, 40,900 died of disease, 85,497 WIA/DOW, 78,735 POW).

Despite the uncertainty of casualty counts, the historical consequences of this campaign are easy to discern. The British conquest of Palestine led directly to the British mandate over Palestine and the Trans-Jordan which, in turn, paved the way for the creation of the states of Israel and Jordan.

<text>Fernando Angel (born 16 September 1963) is a Mexican musician who was a member of the ranchera group, Los Temerarios.

Fernando Angel is the cousin of Adolfo and Gustavo Angel, original band members. He joined the group in 1982, when the group was still known as Grupo Brisas. In 1983, the group changed its name to Los Temerarios. Fernando plays bass guitar.

Fernando Angel is perhaps the least known member of the Angel family in the group. This may be because usually Adolfo&#x27;s and Gustavo&#x27;s photographs headline the group&#x27;s CDs and concert posters. Nevertheless, he has also become popular in Mexico and the rest of Latin America as a member of the famous group. He has also impressed many music critics with his ability to play the bass.

Fernando left the group in 2005, with his last performance in their hometown of Fresnillo, Zacatecas.

<text>Spottsville is a census-designated place (CDP) and former coal town in Henderson County, Kentucky, United States. As of the 2010 census the population was 325.

U.S. Route 60 forms the northern edge of Spottsville, and the Green River forms the eastern edge. The first Spottsville Bridge over the Green River opened on December 17, 1931. In September 2013, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet determined that the structure was functionally obsolete because of its narrow deck width and was structurally deficient. The new Spottsville Bridge was completed in 2022, with the ribbon being cut by Irma Stanley Day who had cut the ribbon on the original Spottsville Bridge in 1931. 

The Green River Lock &amp; Dam is located in the community. Traveling east through Spottsville, one can see the lock to one&#x27;s right when one crosses the US-60 bridge (the Green River Bridge). One can still see some of the remains of the old locks that were replaced in the mid-1960s; to one&#x27;s left, one can see a turning bridge for trains (it turns when a barge comes through).

US-60 leads east to Owensboro and west to Henderson, the Henderson County seat.

There is one elementary school in Spottsville, serving all of the eastern part of Henderson County (including Beals, Baskett, and Reed). The original Spottsville school, which served all grades, provided Henderson County&#x27;s first school bus service in 1920. This original Spottsville school burned down in March 1932.

Spottsville was named for Major Samuel Spotts, who shot the first gun at the Battle of New Orleans. The area was visited by the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1541. His army was attacked near the Ohio River by Indians of a tribe or tribes called variously the Kashinampo, the Quizqui, and the Chiska Cherokee.

From 1904 to 1911 as many as 116 men of the Green River Coal Company mined coal in Spottsville. The Pittsburgh Coal Company operated a 75-man coal camp in Spottsville from 1911 to 1924.

<doc id="1027112" wikidata="Q271655" url="?curid=1027112" title="Laura La Plante">
<text>Laura La Plante (born Laura Laplante; November 1, 1904 – October 14, 1996) was an American film actress, whose more notable performances were in the silent era.

==Early life==
La Plante was born in St. Louis, Missouri on November 1, 1904, the daughter of William A. Laplante and Elizabeth E. Turk. Her father taught dancing. After her parents were divorced her mother took her and her sister Violet to live in San Diego. In her teens, La Plante stayed with Mary MacMahon, her cousin, in Hollywood during a summer vacation and replied to a newspaper ad asking for children for moving pictures, and she was hired. After this, La Plante&#x27;s mother started to lose her hearing, and her cousin Mary convinced her to try more work in motion pictures to earn money for the family. La Plante then became an extra with The Christie Film Company on Gower Street. 

==Silent film career==
La Plante made her acting debut at age 15, and in 1923, she was named as one of that year&#x27;s WAMPAS Baby Stars. During the 1920s, she appeared in more than 60 films. Her early films include &quot;Big Town Round-Up&quot; (1921), with cowboy star Tom Mix, the serials &quot;Perils of the Yukon&quot; (1922), &quot;Around the World in Eighteen Days&quot; (1923), and several movies with Hoot Gibson.

The majority of the films starring La Plante (from 1920 to 1930) were made for Universal Pictures. During this period, she was the studio&#x27;s most popular star, &quot;an accomplishment duplicated only by Deanna Durbin years later&quot;, and almost always enjoyed top billing.

One of La Plante&#x27;s early surviving films is the 1925 film &quot;Smouldering Fires&quot;, directed by Clarence Brown and costarring Pauline Frederick. Her best-remembered film is arguably the silent classic &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; (1927), but she achieved acclaim for &quot;Skinner&#x27;s Dress Suit&quot; (1926), with Reginald Denny, the part-sound &quot;The Love Trap&quot; (1929), directed by William Wyler, and the 1929 part-sound &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1929), adapted from the novel of the same name by Edna Ferber.

Although this last film was an adaptation of the novel, and not of the famous musical play adapted from the 1926 novel, some songs from the play were included in the film as box-office insurance. She did not sing in the movie; her singing was dubbed by Eva Olivetti, one of the early examples in which this was done in a movie. A scene of La Plante in &quot;Show Boat&quot; was broadcast in the early days of British television.

==Transition to sound films==
The advent of sound films effectively shortened her career. In her mid-20s, La Plante was a natural and appealing presence in early sound films, but the huge wave of new stars in these years overshadowed her. She made her last appearances for Universal in the Technicolor musical &quot;King of Jazz&quot; (1930). She appeared in &quot;God&#x27;s Gift to Women&quot; (Warner Bros., 1931), directed by Michael Curtiz and co-starring Frank Fay and Joan Blondell, and &quot;Arizona&quot; (Columbia, 1931), co-starring alongside a young John Wayne.

==Later career==
La Plante went to Britain to work at Warner Brothers&#x27; Teddington Studios. The company had faced criticism for the low quality of its &quot;quota quickies&quot;, and her arrival coincided with an attempt to make expensive productions. She starred in &quot;Man of the Moment&quot; (1935), with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. She appeared in the West End playing the lead in Ian Hay&#x27;s &quot;Admirals All&quot;. La Plante briefly was considered to replace Myrna Loy in the &quot;Thin Man&quot; when Loy thought about leaving the series, but Loy stayed as Nora Charles, and La Plante&#x27;s career never rebounded. She retired from the screen in 1935, making only two later films, and 1957&#x27;s &quot;Spring Reunion&quot; was her last. Her younger sister, actress Violet, never achieved La Plante&#x27;s level of fame; both sisters were WAMPAS Baby Stars. 

On June 3, 1954 (Season 4 Episode 38), La Plante made a guest appearance (as herself, Mrs. Laura Asher) on Groucho Marx&#x27;s quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. In this episode, La Plante discussed numerous topics, including her husband Irving Asher, who had just lost 25 lbs. and completed the film &quot;Elephant Walk&quot; with Elizabeth Taylor. Mrs. Asher asked that her winnings, if any, go to the Motion Picture Relief Fund. They got three out of four questions correct to win $215. In the mid-1980s, La Plante was brought on stage in a wheelchair to wave to the crowd at the event Night of a Hundred Stars.

==Death==
La Plante died on October 14, 1996, at the age of 91 in Woodland Hills, California. Her death was due to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. La Plante was cremated by Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood, California, and her ashes scattered at sea.

<doc id="1027113" wikidata="Q1238549" url="?curid=1027113" title="Dommel">
<text>The Dommel is a small river in Belgium and the Netherlands, left tributary of the Dieze. It is 120 km long, of which 85 km are in the Netherlands. The Dommel takes in water from the Keersop, Tongelreep, Run, Gender and Kleine Dommel streams and merges at &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch with the Aa stream to form the river Dieze, which subsequently flows towards the Meuse. The main cities and towns along the Dommel&#x27;s course are Peer, Neerpelt, Valkenswaard, Dommelen, Eindhoven, Son en Breugel, Sint-Oedenrode, Boxtel, Sint-Michielsgestel and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

== Drainage basin ==
The drainage basin of the Dommel belongs to that of the Meuse. To the west of is the basin of the Donge, which also belongs to that of the Meuse. To the south the basin of the Dommel borders that of the Schelde. To the east is that of the Aa. Further to the south a number of rivers flow into the Meuse much further upstream.

== History ==

=== Former glory ===
The Dommel often looks like a brook nowadays, but it has many geographical features that only larger rivers have. These are the width of the rivers&#x27; valley, and large meanders from the Last Glacial Period. In the past, there was talk about the Romans navigating the Dommel. Later, the near forests were cut down, and so the river became more shallow and started to meander.

=== Water board ===
In 1863 a Water board (Waterschap) was founded for the Dommel. It had authority in all the municipalities where the Dommel flowed. One of its first priorities was to prevent flooding, especially between &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Boxtel. If possible, it wanted to canalize the same stretch, and to improve its navigability, but for the latter a lock would be required. C. 1865, the water board diverted the Dommel through the western city moat of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and made a sluice in the left dyke of the Dieze.

== Course ==

=== North of the Bocholt-Herentals canal ===

The source of the Dommel is in the Kempens Plateau, part of which forms the Hoge Kempen National Park. The exact source is south of Wauberg, near Peer, Belgium. Other brooks on this plateau flow directly to the Meuse, or flow to the Schelde via the Zwarte Beek and the Demer. The source of the Dommel is 77 metres above sea level. On its course it drops 75 m.

Just west of Peer, the Dommel flows through the small nature reserve Mullemer Bemden, where it is joined by the Kleinbeek. To the east there was a small diversion of the water towards the Watermill of Peer. Part of this mill is still standing on the Molhem road. The Mullemer Bemden is part of the preserve &#x27;Valley of the Dommel and Bollisserbeek&#x27; which stretches till west of Kleine Brogel. At the end of the preserve is the building of the Kleine Molen (small mill).

From Kleine Brogel the Dommel first passes the Wedelse Mill, which is a monument. It then passes east of Overpelt, where the Bemvoortse molen is. The Dommel passed very close to the west of Neerpelt, and then reaches the Bocholt–Herentals Canal. It passes this canal by culverts and sluices.

=== From the Bocholt-Herentals canal to Valkenswaard ===
The stretch of the Dommel from the canal near Neerpelt till Valkenswaard is especially valuable. The Dommel first flows through the nature reserve Hageven, and then passes the Dutch border, south of Schaft. From the Dutch-Belgian border the Dommel then drops only 25 meters more. The Dommel then flows along the nature reserve Malpie, which is a Heath with many meres.

This stretch of the Dommel ends at the Venberg Watermill (Venbergse Molen) south of Valkenswaard. This also the end of the popular canoe trips, that start just north of the Bocholt-Herentals canal in Belgium.

=== To Eindhoven ===

After the Venberg Watermill, the Dommel flows north between Dommelen and Valkenswaard. It then flows between Waalre and Veldhoven before it reaches the south west tip of the Eindhoven municipality. After flowing below a handful of bridges of the motorways A67 and A2, most of the water of the Dommel is taken by the Afwateringskanaal. This canal was dug to prevent flooding in Eindhoven and ends in the Wilhelmina Canal. In the south of Eindhoven, the Dommel flows mainly through parks. First the Genneper Parken, and then the Dommelplantsoen, where the Tongelreep joins the Dommel. Next comes the Anne Frank plantsoen, and then the Dommel reaches the city center.

In the center of Eindhoven, the shores and bridges of the Dommel are rather utilitarian. An exception is the new pedestrian bridge near the Van Abbemuseum, and the new extension of this museum which juts out into the Dommel. The river then continues on the east side of Eindhoven city center. Here it almost touches the Eindhovensch Kanaal. The Dommel next flows along the terrain of the Eindhoven University of Technology.

Just west of Nuenen the Dommel is joined by the Kleine Dommel. Just south of Son the Dommel meets the Wilhelmina Canal. Here is it led through culverts that dive below the Canal. The Dommel then appears again on the other side.

=== From Son to Boxtel ===
The stretch from Son en Breugel to Vught is primarily rural. The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel. Here, the Dommel still has many of its original winds and meanders, though many have also been lost. The stretch forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area that is part of the Het Groene Woud. This is a National Landscape situated between Eindhoven, Tilburg and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

The Moerkuilen is a heath area with a mere few kilometres east of Sint-Oedenrode. It is actually a very old meander of the Dommel. Since the Last Glacial Period, it has grown closed with peat, and is now known as the Moerkuilen. The many ponds in the area have been formed by excavating peat. Just west of the Moerkuilen is the Dommelbeemden area, which is a natural monument. It (used to) consist of regularly flooded low-lying meadows used to grow hay, and higher situated &quot;bolakkers&quot; (high fields), where cereals were cultivated. The aim of the natural monument is to restore part of this situation.

=== Boxtel to &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch ===
About two kilometers before reaching the center of Boxtel town, the Afwateringskanaal Boxtel diverts from the Dommel. It was dug by hand in 1933–1936 in order to prevent flooding in Boxtel. It cut off a bend of the Dommel of about 4 km that flowed through Boxtel. The Boxtel &#x27;arm&#x27; then received only little water till the waterschap reverted the situation in 2013. Now the Dommel bed is again the primary course of the Dommel in Boxtel, and the Afwateringskanaal Boxtel is only used at high water. An unexpected effect of the Afwateringskanaal is that it allows canoes to make a round trip in Boxtel, the so-called &#x27;Rondje Boxtel&#x27;.

Boxtel is traditionally said to be the point till which the Dommel is navigable. However, navigability is a highly contextual subject. In the context of current commercial navigation the size of the ships that the Dommel can handle is much too small to make shipping economically viable. Before the introduction of the steam engine however, river ships were much smaller, and navigation was economically viable between Boxtel and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. The Dommel was even wide enough to allow shipping till Sint-Oedenrode, but apart from the fact that a mill in Boxtel blocked its course, there were too many bends in the river too make navigation till Sint-Oedenrode economically feasible.

Up till about 1870, there was still some navigation on the Dommel. In 1859, a ship loaded with stone and Gravel sank on the Aa near Sint-Michielsgestel while en route to Boxtel. The skipper was from Sint-Michielsgestel, and was killed together with his son.

West of Sint-Michielsgestel the Esschestroom joins the Dommel near the hamlet Halder. In Roman times Halder was probably the most important settlement on the Dommel. A small museum is dedicated to the Roman history of the area.

=== In &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch ===

While residents of Eindhoven generally know that their city is on the Dommel, the citizens of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch are convinced that their city is situated on the Dieze. Up till the 1860s, this was a matter of using a different name for the same river. However, in 1864 a sluice was made in the left Dieze dyke just north of the ravelin which was north of the Oliemolen bastion in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. It connected the western city moat to the Dieze. In turn this city moat was connected to the Dommel at about the same time. The result was that henceforward the Dommel not only flowed to the Dieze under the name &#x27;Binnendieze&#x27;, but also flowed to the Dieze in a new bed as &#x27;Dommel&#x27;. With more water flowing through the new bed, than through the older Binnendieze bed, confusion became inevitable.

The Dommel reaches the southern tip of the city center on its eastern side. The connection from the Dommel to the city moat was made by digging about 100 m to the west from that point. The 1864 Dommel then turns north to run along the west side of the city center. At the point where the Dommel turns northward, the Drongelens Canal starts. This was constructed from 1906 to 1910. If the water level on Dommel and Aa is high, this canal is actually the main discharge of both.

Here the Dommel in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch is understood as the new bed that is currently called &#x27;Dommel&#x27;. Its appearance has been influenced by two major events. The first was that the city lost its status as a fortification in the 1880s. It prompted works that canalized the city moat, obliterating many of the fortification works. The second are the post millennial works to restore the fortifications, and to make the Dommel an ecological connection zone. This meant that on the Dommel the fortifications, and in particular the city wall were made visible again. In the Dommel itself a more natural river-side was created to aid wild-life.

There are some highlights of the Dommel in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. The St-Jan&#x27;s Bolwerk is a reconstructed part of the city wall which functions as a tiny city park. The clever aspect is that on the inside it functions as a sewer overflow. The late medieval city walls have been excavated. At St-Jan&#x27;s Bolwerk a rediscovered older part, which had fallen over in the moat, has been resurrected. The Wilhelminabrug connects to the station and is heavily decorated with often neglected post war sculptures. The swing bridge near the confluence with the Dieze is a fine piece of industrial engineering.

<doc id="1027116" wikidata="Q724704" url="?curid=1027116" title="Oceanic Airlines">
<text>Oceanic Airlines, and less frequently, Oceanic Airways, is the name of a fictional airline used in several films, television programs, and comic books—typically works that feature plane crashes and other aviation disasters, with which a real airline would prefer not to be associated.

The brand is used prominently in the TV series &quot;Lost,&quot; where Oceanic Airlines is featured with a highly stylized logo depicting an Australian Aboriginal dot painting that resembles a nazar, a bullseye, an island, or an &quot;O&quot;. The show&#x27;s fictional storyline begins with the crash of an airline flight called Oceanic Flight 815.

Airlines with this name have also been featured in other media, starting as early as the mid-1960s. Before &quot;Lost,&quot; the most prominent use of Oceanic Airlines was in the 1996 film &quot;Executive Decision.&quot; The film&#x27;s producers shot extensive footage of two actual Boeing 747s with Oceanic Airlines logo and livery, though not the same logo used later on &quot;Lost.&quot; This stock footage has been reused in several films and television programs, spreading the Oceanic Airlines brand across various otherwise unrelated fictional universes.

== Appearances ==

The following sources feature an airline called Oceanic Airlines.

=== &quot;Lost&quot; ===

Oceanic Airlines is a central plot element in the TV series &quot;Lost&quot;. The show explores the aftermath of the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 (a Lockheed L-1011 was used to create the crash, but the plane in-universe is stated as a Boeing 777) traveling from Sydney to Los Angeles. The producers of &quot;Lost&quot; also created a now-defunct website for the fictional airline, including clues and references to the show&#x27;s plot. In flashforwards, a group of characters who survive the crash (Hurley, Kate, Jack, Sayid, Sun, and Aaron) are nicknamed the &quot;Oceanic Six.&quot; In January 2008, viral marketing billboards for Oceanic Airlines were placed by ABC in various large cities around the world as part of the &quot;Find 815&quot; alternate reality game. Fictitious TV advertisements for the company also aired on ABC and the internet, including one advertisement that apparently airs in an alternate universe where Flight 815 did not crash and Oceanic has a &quot;perfect safety record&quot;. The flight number 815 is a nod to Disney&#x27;s Peter Pan animation: while flying into the Big Ben clock dial, Peter Pan sets the time to 8:15. This reference later shows up in &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;.

<doc id="1027127" wikidata="Q949376" url="?curid=1027127" title="Muky">
<text>Muky was an Argentine brand of die-cast toy model cars. The brand was popular in Argentina between the 1970s and the 1980s. Most were diecast seconds or knockoffs of early Mattel Hot Wheels.

At its peak, the factory produced 50,000 to 60,000 models by month until 1991, when the factory closed due to competition from imported products.

== History ==
=== Beginning ===
&quot;Muky&quot; was a brand created by ESDECO, a company founded by Mr. Escobar and Libio DeConti and his brother The company&#x27;s name is an acronym from both families surnames. in the city of Gualeguay, in Entre Ríos Province, 145 miles north-west of Buenos Aires.

Virtually all of the models made by Muky were copies of early Mattel&#x27;s Hot Wheels like the Custom Corvette, the Lola T70, the Custom Eldorado, or the Dodge Deora. Thus the company is often called the &quot;Hot Wheels of Argentina&quot;. Muky were not as popular, or as collectible today, as the country&#x27;s Buby toys, which made Argentine Torinos, Falcons, and other vehicles that may have been more familiar to children there.

=== Change of management ===
In the late 1970s, because of the worsening economic environment in Argentina, the DeConti brothers moved to Brazil and began manufacturing toys there called &quot;Superveloz&quot;. In 1984 or 1985, a certain Dell Arciprete (whose family ran a fumigation business) bought the factory and rights to the Muky brand, changing its name to &quot;Induguay S.A.&quot;. Using most of the same dies, the company again began making toy cars. Arciprete&#x27;s Muky line added a few new vehicles. The Archiprete family ran the factory and the fumigation business at the same time.

The later Mukys were numbered from eight to forty, numbers one through six having been lost along the line somewhere. Also, these later models&#x27; chassis were cast in plastic, and Mukys were distributed also to Uruguay and Spain.

== Questions on tooling ==
How Induguay came to possess the Mattel dies is uncertain; one story is that the DeConti brothers stole the dies from Mattel, but two other prevalent theories exist, both logical. One is that the models were carefully copied from blueprints. Another is that third party agents, with the approval of Mattel, sold some dies to the De Contis. In any event, perusal of catalogs of old and new models shows that few of the 37 models originally manufactured by Induguay were ever reissued by Mattel. Apparently, the Arciprete family has kept the tooling and doesn&#x27;t deny that they might again someday make more Mukys.

== Notes ==
The copies of Hot Wheels vehicles often have the wrong bases with a different vehicle stamped on them, such as the Custom AMX says Chevelle SS as does the box it came in. This list of models below does not reflect the actual models.

<doc id="1027133" wikidata="Q2110122" url="?curid=1027133" title="Alice White">
<text>Alice White (born Alva White; August 25, 1904 – February 19, 1983) was an American film actress. She first came to the public’s attention during the late silent era as a rival to Clara Bow, before starring in First National/Warner Brothers films &quot;Broadway Babies&quot;, &quot;Naughty Baby&quot;, &quot;Hot Stuff&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Mama&quot;. 

==Early years==
Alice White was born in Paterson, New Jersey. Her mother was a chorus girl and Alice was raised by her maternal grandparents. She moved to California with her grandparents when a teenager and attended Hollywood High School for secretarial classes.

==Film==

After leaving school, White became a secretary and &quot;script girl&quot; for director Josef von Sternberg. She also worked as a switchboard operator at the Hollywood Writers&#x27; Club. After clashing with von Sternberg, White left to work as a script girl for Charlie Chaplin, who said, when he saw some photos a cameraman had taken of her &quot;...you ought to go into the movies.&quot;

Her bubbly and vivacious persona led to comparisons with Clara Bow, but White&#x27;s career was slow to progress. In his book &quot;Silent Films, 1877-1996: A Critical Guide to 646 Movies&quot;, Robert K. Klepper wrote: &quot;Some critics have said that Ms. White was a second-string Clara Bow. In actuality, Ms. White had her own type of charm, and was a delightful actress in her own, unique way. Whereas Clara Bow played the quintessential, flaming redheaded flapper, Alice White was more of a bubbly, vivacious blonde.&quot;

After playing a succession of flappers and gold diggers, she attracted the attention of director and producer Mervyn LeRoy, who saw potential in her. Her screen debut was in &quot;The Sea Tiger&quot; (1927). Her early films included &quot;Show Girl&quot; (1928), which had Vitaphone musical accompaniment but no dialog, and its musical sequel &quot;Show Girl in Hollywood&quot; (1930), both released by Warner Brothers and both based on novels by J.P. McEvoy. In these two films, White appeared as Dixie Dugan. In October 1929, McAvoy started the comic strip &quot;Dixie Dugan&quot; with the character Dixie having a &quot;helmet&quot; hairstyle and appearance similar to actress Louise Brooks. White also used the services of Hollywood &#x27;beauty sculptor&#x27; Sylvia of Hollywood to stay in shape.

White was featured in &quot;The Girl from Woolworth&#x27;s&quot; (1929), having the role of a singing clerk in the music department of a Woolworth&#x27;s store. Karen Plunkett-Powell wrote in her book &quot;Remembering Woolworth&#x27;s: A Nostalgic History of the World&#x27;s Most Famous Five-and-Dime&quot;: &quot;First National Pictures produced this 60-minute musical as a showcase for up-and-coming actress Alice White.&quot;

==Later career==
White left films in 1931 to improve her acting abilities, returning in 1933 only to have her career hurt by a scandal that erupted over her involvement with boyfriend actor Jack Warburton and future husband Sy Bartlett. Although she later married Bartlett, her reputation was tarnished and she appeared only in supporting roles after this, including &quot;Jimmy the Gent&quot; (1934) with James Cagney and Bette Davis. By 1937 and 1938, her name was at the bottom of the cast lists. She made her final film appearance in &quot;Flamingo Road&quot; (1949) and eventually resumed working as a secretary.

==Personal life==

In 1933, White and her fiancé, American screenwriter Sidney &quot;Sy&quot; Bartlett, were accused of arranging the beating of British actor John Warburton. White and Warburton had reportedly had a love affair that ended when he beat her so badly she required cosmetic surgery. A grand jury in Los Angeles decided not to charge Bartlett or White; however, the bad publicity hurt White’s career. 

White married Bartlett on December 3, 1933, in Magdalena, Mexico. She filed for divorce in 1937, claiming he &quot;stayed away from home&quot; and was awarded $65 per week in alimony.

White remarried, to film writer John Roberts, on August 24, 1940. They divorced on April 18, 1949, in Los Angeles. The following year, she sued him over unpaid alimony.

==Death==
White died of complications from a stroke on February 19, 1983, at age 78. She was buried at Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood.

==Award==
White has a star at 1511 Vine Street in the Motion Pictures section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was dedicated on February 8, 1960.

<text>Katharine Tynan (23 January 1859 – 2 April 1931) was an Irish writer, known mainly for her novels and poetry. After her marriage in 1893 to the Trinity College scholar, writer and barrister Henry Albert Hinkson (1865–1919) she usually wrote under the name Katharine Tynan Hinkson, or variations thereof. Tynan&#x27;s younger sister Nora Tynan O&#x27;Mahony (née Tynan, 1866–1954) was also a poet and one of her three children, Pamela Hinkson (1900–1982), was also known as a writer. The Katharine Tynan Road in Belgard, Tallaght is named after her.

==Biography==
Tynan was born into a small farming family in County Dublin and educated at the Dominican St. Catherine&#x27;s, a convent school in Drogheda. Her poetry was first published in 1875. She met and became friendly with the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins in 1886. Tynan went on to play a major part in Dublin literary circles, until she married and moved to England; later she lived at Claremorris, County Mayo when her husband was a magistrate from 1914 until 1919.

From June 1885 when they first met until around the time of her marriage in 1893, Tynan was a close associate of and regular correspondent with William Butler Yeats (who may have proposed marriage and been rejected). Tynan was also later a correspondent of Francis Ledwidge. She is said to have written over 100 novels. Her &quot;Collected Poems&quot; appeared in 1930; she also wrote five autobiographical volumes.

Tynan contributed to many periodicals and magazines such as the Jesuit published Studies, the Dominican published Irish Rosary, Irish Monthly, Hibernia and Dublin University Review.

Tynan died in Wimbledon, London aged 72.

<text>Songjiang is a suburban district (formerly a county) of Shanghai. It has a land area of and a population of 1,909,713 (2020). Owing to a long history, Songjiang is known as the cultural root of Shanghai.

Songjiang Town, the urban center of the district, was formerly the major city in the area. It is now connected to downtown Shanghai by Line 9 of the Shanghai Metro.

==History==
The prehistoric coastline of the East China Sea was much farther inland, at Xinzhuang near Songjiang&#x27;s current eastern border with Minhang District. It was only gradually that silt from the Yangtze River filled in downtown Shanghai about 2000 years ago and then Pudong and Chongming Island over the last 1000 years.

Modern archaeology has established a chronology of the main cultural groups who lived in the present area of Songjiang District in Neolithic China: the Majiabang in the 5th millennium ), the Songze in the 4th millennium), and the Liangzhu in the 3rd millennium. The Majiabang were among the first harvesters of rice and kept domesticated pigs while still frequently hunting deer. The Liangzhu possessed a high stratified society that almost certainly represented one of the earliest states in East Asia. The Liangzhu site at Guangfulin in Songjiang has been developed into Guangfulin Relics Park, an expansive museum and tourist attraction.

Traditional Chinese historiography only recorded these people as among the Baiyuethe &quot;Numerous Southern Barbarians&quot;until the growth of the siniticized Wu Kingdom at Suzhou in the 1st millennium. During the Spring and Autumn period at the end of the Zhou and under the Warring States, the area of present-day Songjiang passed from Wu to Yue to Chu before the unification of China under Shi Huangdi of Qin in the 3rd century.

In the Three Kingdoms period that followed the end of the Han in the 3rd century, Sun Quan&#x27;s Wu Kingdom helped develop and further sinify the area. Another boost came from the completion of the Grand Canal under the Sui, linking Songjiang with Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo in the south and Suzhou, Luoyang, Xi&#x27;an, and Beijing in the north. By the mid-Tang, the region had developed enough that it was organized in 751 into Huating County, the first county-level administration within modern-day Shanghai.

In the 1250s at the end of the Southern Song, the 10-year-old Songjiangese girl Huang Daopo fled her hometown and an arranged marriage to live with the Hlai on Hainan. She returned around 1295 with new strains of cotton, an early cotton gin, and other advances to cotton cultivation and processing that made the sandy lands of eastern Huating County so much more prosperous that Huang was later deified out of gratitude. By the mid-Qing, as much as ¾ of Songjiang&#x27;s farmland was devoted to cotton. Under the Yuan, this new wealth saw Huating elevated to prefectural status and renamed Songjiangfu. This is sometimes considered the origin of China&#x27;s modern textile industry. It was also under the Yuan that the city first had enough Hui to establish Shanghai&#x27;s first mosque.

In 1404, headwaters previously emptying into the Wusong were rerouted by local officials, diminishing the size of Suzhou Creek and expanding the Huangpu River to its modern importance. Songjiang was better fortified under the Ming in response to attacks by the Japanese &quot;Wokou&quot; pirates, who sometimes raided and sometimes occupied to the town. The Ming also saw the Jesuitswho counted the influential Shanghainese official Xu Guangqi among their convertsestablish the town&#x27;s first known church. Owing to the importance of Portuguese and Latin at the time, the town&#x27;s name was romanized Sumkiam.

Following Dorgon&#x27;s 21 July 1645 edict mandating the queue, the people of Songjiang rose up against the Qing to protect their hair, viewed as a symbol of virility and filial piety. Li Chengdong (, d. 1649) retook the city and massacred its population on 22 September 1645. Nonetheless, Songjiang remained the primary metropolis of the area of present-day Shanghai as late as the mid-19th century, when its name was typically romanized as Sungkiang. It continued to serve as the prefectural capital under the &quot;Right&quot; Governor of Jiangnan based in Suzhou and then later under the governor of Jiangsu at Jiangning (now Nanjing). Unlike the foreign-held area of Shanghai, however, it fell to rebels during the Taiping Rebellion&#x27;s Eastern Expedition. About a hundred Europeans under Frederick Townsend Ward failed to retake the town in June 1860. After gathering more Westerners, over 80 Philippine &quot;Manilamen&quot;, and several pieces of artillery, a second assault in July 1860 retook the town with heavy losses. Out of about 250 men, 62 were killed and about 100 wounded, including Ward. Songjiang was then used by Ward, Henry Andres Burgevine, their Ever-Victorious Army, and Cheng Xueqi&#x27;s division of the Huai Army as a base for raids and attacks on other Taiping positions under Li Xiucheng throughout the &quot;Battle of Shanghai&quot;. 

Despite Shanghai&#x27;s greater importance by the beginning of the 20th century, its international settlement meant Songjiang was still used as the formal center of Chinese government for the region. Under the Republic of China, the Zhili clique leader Sun Chuanfang&#x27;s Songhu () or Songjiang Special Administrative District covered most of what is now Shanghai Municipality, extending as far north as Chongming Island.

During World War II, Japan occupied Songjiang from 9 November 1937 until 1945. Afterwards, both the Nationalist and Communist regional government was moved to Shanghai proper, leaving Songjiang a comparatively rural county. The city&#x27;s many ancient religious structures and examples of traditional architecture were seriously damaged during the 1960s and 1970s amid the Cultural Revolution. Following the PRC&#x27;s Opening Up Policy, Songjiang restored its more important religious buildings and developed into a college town hosting several large universities. In 1998, it was elevated to its current status as an urban district.

<text>Fengxian District, is a suburban district in the south of Shanghai with a land area of , a registered population (as of 2020) of 1,140,872, and 1.5 to 2 times more migrants. It is known for its relative rusticity, as well as its beaches and ocean resorts along the Hangzhou Bay. Bihai Jinsha () is a common place for Shanghainese to spend their weekend.

In 2019 some senior citizens in Fengxian District still used the pronunciation &quot;Hongxian&quot;.

==Overview==
Nanqiao is a major town in Fengxian district, which recent development has more than doubled in size. Of particular interest is Guhua Park which contains the &quot;Three Women Temple&quot; or &quot;Ancestral Hall&quot; (). During the Zhou dynasty, the King of Wu&#x27;s three daughters hanged themselves rather than be caught by the King of Yue&#x27;s soldiers. The town is also a short taxi ride from Xinghai Beach and its resorts, also slated for development. Nanqiao has a 1000-bed medical center, the Fengxian District Central Hospital, which is an all-discipline tertiary hospital.

Nanqiao is about 30 minutes from downtown Shanghai by car or about 1–2 hours by public transit. It can be reached by taking the Line 1 subway to Xinzhuang and transferring to the Line 5 subway to Dongchuan Road. Alternatively, one can transfer to the Xinnan Bus at Xinzhuang, the Nanmei Line () from Jinjiang Park to Nanqiao Bus Station (), or the Shangfeng Bus at the Shanghai South Railway Station Station&#x27;s South Square.

She has also featured as part of the American 4×100 meter relay team, winning gold medals at the 2005 and 2007 World Championships and at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Williams is one of six athletes to have won a medal in both the Summer and Winter Olympic games, as well as the first American woman to do so.

==Career==
Williams was born in Rochester, Pennsylvania and raised in suburban Pittsburgh and Detroit. She currently resides in suburban Pittsburgh. She holds her high school records for the 100, 200m, long jump and 4x100 meters relay. She ran for The Wings of Moon Track Club founded by Coach Rubin Carter based in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb near Pittsburgh. She was a star with the new club and qualified for the National Junior Olympics.

==College==
She attended the University of Miami, where she competed on the track team and graduated in 2004. She was inducted into the Iron Arrow Honor Society, the university&#x27;s highest honor.

==Track career==
Williams was a part of the 4x100 meter relay team at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics, where she anchored the American team with Angela Williams, Chryste Gaines and Inger Miller in their heat. She did not run in the final.

Later that season, she participated in the 2003 Pan American Games in the 100 metre event. She went on to claim gold in a time of 11.12, followed closely by Angela Williams and Liliana Allen.

Williams is a silver medalist in the 100 meters at the 2004 Summer Olympics and a 4-time medalist at the World Championships in Athletics, where she won (together with Angela Daigle, Muna Lee and Me&#x27;Lisa Barber) a gold medal in the 4x100 m relay in 2005 and 2007, as well as gold and silver in the 100m in 2005 and 2007 editions of the meet.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Williams ran the third leg for the women&#x27;s 4x100 relay team in the final. Marion Jones, who ran the second leg, and Williams failed to complete the baton exchange within the 20-meter passing zone, resulting in disqualification of the U.S. team.

In the Beijing Olympics of 2008, Williams ran the anchor leg in the relay, but a mix-up in the semi-final with team-mate Torri Edwards caused Edwards to drop the baton. Williams picked up the baton to finish in last place, but the USA was disqualified because she had had to run outside her lane in order to retrieve the baton. At the individual 100 metres sprint she placed 2nd in her first round heat behind Christine Arron in a time of 11.38 to advance to the second round. There she improved her time to 11.07 seconds and placed 2nd again, this time behind Kerron Stewart. With the third time in her semi final heat behind Shelly-Ann Fraser and Muna Lee she qualified for the final in 11.10 seconds. In the final she came to 11.03, finishing in fourth place, behind three runners from Jamaica.

Williams took third place in the 100 m at the 2009 US Championships and as a result she qualified for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, her third consecutive championships. A week before the World Championships began, she was part of a United States 4 x 100 m relay team that ran the fastest women&#x27;s sprint relay in twelve years. Williams, Allyson Felix, Muna Lee and Carmelita Jeter finished with a time of 41.58 seconds, bringing them to eighth on the all-time list.

She spent the entirety of 2010 away from competitive athletics and, among other things, she worked in the athletic department at the University of Miami. She returned to competition in 2011.

In the 2012 Olympics in London, Lauryn Williams ran the anchor leg of 4 x 100 meter relay for USA in the qualification round. The team went on to win gold and earn a new world record with a time of 40.82

==2014 Winter Olympics==
On January 19, 2014 Williams won her first bobsled gold medal in a World Cup event at Igls, Austria. She was later selected to be a part of the U.S. Olympic 2014 women&#x27;s bobsled team.

On February 19, 2014 Williams along with Elana Meyers won the silver medal at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. Their first run was a time of 57.26, a track record. Their second run was 57.63, the third was 57.69 and fourth was 58.13 for a total of 3:50.71, a difference of +0.10 from first place, just edged out by Canada 1.

Williams is one of six Olympians, three Americans to win medals at the Winter and Summer Olympic Games. Eddie Eagan won Gold as a boxer in 1920 and on the bobsled in 1932. Eddy Alvarez won a Silver Medal in 2014 as a speedskater and another Silver Medal in Tokyo for baseball.

==After the Olympics==
Williams later became a certified financial planner, passing the exam in 2017.

<text>Jinshan District, is a suburban district of southwestern Shanghai, neighboring Zhejiang province and Hangzhou Bay. It has a land area of and a population of 732,500 as of the 2010 Chinese census. Jinshan District, located in the southwest of Shanghai, is one of the biggest districts of the city. Local political administration is divided into nine towns and one subdistrict. About off the coast of Jinshan, there are three islands named Dajinshan (&quot;Big Gold Mountain&quot;), Xiaojinshan (&quot;Little Gold Mountain&quot;), and Fushan (&quot;Floating Mountain&quot;). At above sea level, the peak of Dajinshan Island is the highest point within the Shanghai municipality. There are several beaches along the shoreline, which are popular tourism destinations.

As the city of Shanghai has grown, Jinshan has experienced rapid changes, evolving from a relatively rural area to a more suburban environment. With completion of the high-speed highway in 2008, a new bus line was opened between Shanghai and Jinshan. This Shimei Line ( ,  ) travels between the bus station in Jinshan and another beside the Jinjiang Park station on Line 1 of the Shanghai Metro. Travel time is about an hour, depending on traffic and time of day, and costs each way.

<doc id="1027166" wikidata="Q618282" url="?curid=1027166" title="Roman ring">
<text>In general relativity, a Roman ring (proposed by Matt Visser in 1997 and named after the Roman arch, a concept proposed by Mike Morris and Kip Thorne in 1988 and named after physicist Tom Roman) is a configuration of wormholes where no subset of wormholes is near to chronology violation, though the combined system can be arbitrarily close to chronology violation.

==Examples==
For example, an Earth–Moon wormhole whose far end is 0.5 seconds in the &quot;past&quot; will not violate causality, since information sent to the far end via the wormhole and back through normal space will still arrive back on Earth (-0.5 + 1) = 0.5 seconds after it was transmitted; but an additional wormhole in the other direction will allow information to arrive back on Earth 1 second &quot;before&quot; it was transmitted (time travel). However, it is believed that relative time between the transmission of the information in one wormhole throat and out of the other end in a ring structure will remain the same, because light wouldn&#x27;t have violated local proper time, because the distance traveled by the information would take time, either by going the long way or through the wormhole.

==Chronology protection==
Semiclassical approaches to incorporating quantum effects into general relativity seem to show that the chronology protection conjecture postulated by physicist Stephen Hawking fails to prevent the formation of such rings, although Matt Visser feels that there are reasons to think the semiclassical approach is unreliable here, and that a full theory of quantum gravity will likely uphold chronology protection.

<text>Acrididae are the predominant family of [[grasshopper]]s, comprising some 10,000 of the 11,000 species of the entire suborder Caelifera. The Acrididae are best known because all locusts (swarming grasshoppers) are of the Acrididae. The subfamily Oedipodinae is sometimes classified as a distinct family Oedipodidae in the superfamily Acridoidea. Acrididae grasshoppers are characterized by relatively short and stout antennae (so they may be called &quot;short-horned grasshoppers&quot;), and tympana on the side of the first abdominal segment.

==Subfamilies==



The &quot;Orthoptera Species File&quot; (September 2021) lists the following subfamilies of Acrididae. The numbers of genera and species are approximate and may change over time.
* Acridinae (140 genera, 470 species), Worldwide: temperate and tropical
* Calliptaminae (12 genera, 90 species), Africa, Europe, Asia

<text>Allyson Michelle Felix (born November 18, 1985) is a retired American track and field athlete who competed in the 100 meters, 200 meters and 400 meters. She specialized in the 200 meters from 2003 to 2013, then gradually shifted to the 400 meters later in her career. At 200 meters, Felix is the 2012 Olympic champion, a three-time world champion (2005–2009), a two-time Olympic silver medalist (2004 and 2008), and the 2011 world bronze medalist. At 400 meters, she is the 2015 world champion, 2011 world silver medalist, 2016 Olympic silver medalist, 2017 world bronze medalist, and 2020 Olympic bronze medalist. Across the short distances, Felix is a ten-time U.S. national champion (2004, 2005, 2007–2012, 2015 and 2016).

Felix played a key role on the United States women&#x27;s relay teams, winning six additional Olympic gold medals: four consecutive medals at 4 × 400 meters (2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020) and two at 4 × 100 meters (2012 and 2016). The 2012 and 2016 U.S. Olympic 4 × 100 m teams set a world record of 40.82 s and the second fastest time of 41.01 s, respectively. With these six golds from relays and one from an individual event, Felix became the first female track and field athlete to ever win seven Olympic gold medals. She is also the most decorated woman in Olympic track and field history and the most decorated American track and field athlete in Olympic history, having earned 11 total medals from five consecutive Olympic Games. Felix is the most decorated athlete, male or female, in World Athletics Championships history with 20 career medals, 7 from individual events and 13 from team relays. With a combined Olympic and World Championship total of 31 medals, she is also the overall most decorated athlete in track and field history, with 12 medals from individual events and 19 from relays. Felix was the first athlete in track and field history to medal in 3 different relays, 4 × 100 m, 4 × 400 m and mixed 4 × 400 m.

Among Felix&#x27;s notable performances, her 200 meters personal best of 21.69 seconds, which was set at the 2012 U.S. Olympic trials, ranked at the time as the third-fastest time ever run by an American woman and sixth-fastest time by a female athlete in history. She also ran a 47.72-second leg on the U.S. women&#x27;s 4 × 400 m relay team at the 2015 Beijing World Championships, recording the fastest split ever by an American woman, and third-fastest split ever by a female athlete.

Felix, along with Alysia Montaño and Kara Goucher, is credited with stirring public outcry over Nike&#x27;s refusal to guarantee salary protections for its pregnant athletes, prompting the sportswear brand to expand its maternity policy in 2019. Two years after her departure from Nike, the athlete turned entrepreneur launched her own footwear company, Saysh, in June 2021.

She was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People of 2020 and 2021. In 2022, Felix received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from her alma mater USC and also served as the commencement speaker for that year&#x27;s graduation ceremony. In July 2024, Felix was placed at number 63 on ESPN&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest athletes of the 21st century.

==Early life==
Allyson Felix was born on November 18, 1985, in Los Angeles, California. She is the daughter of Paul, an ordained minister and professor of New Testament at The Master&#x27;s Seminary in Sun Valley, California, and Marlean, an elementary school teacher at Balboa Magnet Elementary. Her elder brother Wes Felix was also a sprinter, winning the 2002 USA Junior Championships in the 200 meters race and later, the Pac-10 championships in 2003 and 2004 as a collegiate athlete for USC. Wes now acts as the agent for his sister. Felix describes her running ability as a gift from God: &quot;For me, my faith is the reason I run. I definitely feel I have this amazing gift that God has blessed me with, and it&#x27;s all about using it to the best of my ability.&quot;

==Junior career==
Allyson Felix attended Los Angeles Baptist High School in North Hills, California, where she was nicknamed &quot;Chicken Legs&quot; by her teammates, because the five-foot-six, 125-pound sprinter&#x27;s body had skinny legs despite her strength. Her slightness belied her speed on the track and strength in the gym, as she could deadlift at least 270 pounds while still in high school. Felix credits much of her early success to her high school sprint coach, Jonathan Patton.

Felix began to discover her athletic talents after she tried out for track in the ninth grade. Just ten weeks after that first tryout, she finished seventh in the 200 meters at the CIF California State Meet. In the coming seasons, she became a five-time winner at the meet. In 2001, at the Debrecan World Youth Championships, Felix achieved her first international title in the 100 meters. In 2003, she was named the national girls&#x27; &quot;High School Athlete of the Year&quot; by &quot;Track and Field News&quot;. As a senior, Felix finished second in the 200 meters at the US Indoor Track &amp; Field Championships. A few months later, in front of 50,000 fans in Mexico City, she ran 22.11 seconds, the fastest in history for a high school girl, though it could not count as a world junior record because there was no drug testing at the meet.

Felix graduated high school in 2003, making headlines by forgoing college eligibility to sign a professional contract with Adidas via her agent Nik Visger. Adidas paid her an undisclosed sum and picked up her college tuition at the University of Southern California. She graduated in May 2008 with a degree in elementary education.

==Professional==
===Early career===

At the 2003 U.S. national championships, the seventeen-year-old phenomenon finished second in the 200 meters sprint with a time of 22.59 seconds, earning her spot to the 2003 Paris World Championships. In the quarter-finals of the 200 meters in Paris, Felix finished sixth in 23.33 seconds.

At the age of 18, Felix earned an Olympic silver medal in the 200 meters at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, behind Veronica Campbell of Jamaica; in doing so, she set a world junior record over 200 meters with her time of 22.18 seconds. After leaving Athens, Felix and her coach Pat Connolly, who also guided the 1984 Olympic 100 meters champion Evelyn Ashford, parted ways as Connolly moved back to Virginia and Felix cited difficulties training alone. The young sprinter then sought the tutelage of controversial sprint coach Bob Kersee, whom she would train under for the next 18 years.

Nineteen-year-old Felix became the youngest world champion ever in the 200 meters at the 2005 Helsinki World Championships and then successfully defended her world title in Osaka two years later. At the 2007 Osaka World Championships, Felix caught Jamaican rival, Veronica Campbell, on the bend and surged down the straightaway to finish in 21.81 seconds, dipping under the 22-second barrier for the first time in her career. After the final, Felix stated in the post-race interview: &quot;I feel so good. I am so excited. I have been waiting for so long to run such a time, to run under 22 seconds. It has not been an easy road, but finally, I managed.&quot; At that time, she addressed her future, saying, &quot;My next goal is not the world record, but gold in Beijing. I want to take it step-by-step. I might consider doing both – the 200 and the 400 meters – there.&quot; Days later, after partaking in the winning U.S. 4 × 100 meters relay and also the 4 × 400 meters relay, in which she unofficially split 48.01 seconds on the second leg, Felix became only the second female athlete, after Marita Koch in 1983, to win three gold medals at a single IAAF World Championships in Athletics.

===2008–09===
Felix qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics at the 2008 Olympic trials by winning the 200 meters sprint in 21.82 seconds, but narrowly missed qualifying for the 100 meters sprint. In the Olympic 200 meter final, despite running her season&#x27;s best time in the 200 meters at 21.93 seconds, she again finished second to Campbell, who ran 21.74 seconds, the best time of the decade, to win the gold medal. Felix avenged her disappointing loss by regaining the lead for the U.S. women&#x27;s 4 × 400 meters relay team during her 48.55-second leg, allowing Team USA to eventually win and earning her first Olympic gold medal.

In the build-up to the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, Felix was part of a U.S. 4 × 100 meters relay team that ran the fastest women&#x27;s sprint relay in twelve years. Lauryn Williams, Felix, Muna Lee and Carmelita Jeter finished with a time of 41.58 seconds, bringing them to eighth on the all-time list. In 2009, at merely 23 years old, Felix proceeded to claim her third 200-meter world championship gold medal, an unprecedented accomplishment in women&#x27;s sprinting. Felix clocked 22.02 sec to comfortably beat Jamaica&#x27;s Olympic 200-meter champion Veronica Campbell-Brown.

Afterwards she said, &quot;It&#x27;s really special to win a third world title. I wanted to do it in this stadium, represent my country and make Jesse Owens proud.&quot; But Felix admitted that she would rather have the one gold medal that she was missing. &quot;I would love to trade my three world championships for your gold,&quot; Felix jokingly said to Veronica Campbell-Brown of Jamaica at the medalists&#x27; news conference, referring to the 2008 Olympic gold medal in the 200 meters, a race Felix was heavily favored to win. Still distressed over finishing second to Campbell-Brown in Beijing, Felix stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I ever want to get over it. I never want to be satisfied with losing.&quot; At the same time, she also commented, &quot;I&#x27;m just grateful to have had success quickly, and sometimes I do have to pinch myself and realize all this has happened in not that much time.&quot; Felix later claimed another gold medal by running a 48.75-second leg on Team USA&#x27;s victorious 4 × 400 meters relay team.

===2010–11===
In 2010, Felix focused on running more 400-meter races. Running the 200 meters and the 400 meters, she became the first person to win two IAAF Diamond League trophies in the same year. She continued her dominance by winning 21 out of 22 races, only losing to Veronica Campbell-Brown in New York. Felix also became the U.S. 100 meters champion by winning the sprint in 11.27 seconds against a strong −2.5 m/s headwind.

At the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, Felix ran in the 200 and 400 meters, as well as the 4 × 100 and 4 × 400 meters relay races. In the 400-meter event, Felix&#x27;s best efforts yielded only a second-place finish despite straining down the homestretch to a personal best of 49.59 seconds, 0.03 behind winner Amantle Montsho of Botswana. Montsho later tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine in 2014. In the 200-meter final, Felix finished third in a subpar time of 22.42 seconds due to fatigue. Veronica Campbell-Brown won the gold and Carmelita Jeter won silver. In the relay events, Felix ran the second leg in both the 4 × 100 meters and 4 × 400 meters. Team USA won both events, attaining world-leading times in both finals as Felix added two world championship gold medals to her collection. The 25-year-old American sprinter was the only athlete to leave Daegu with four medals.

===2012–13===
In 2012, Felix returned to the Olympic trials, choosing to race the 100 meters in addition to her main event, the 200 meters. The top three finishers in each event qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics team. In the 100 meters final, she ran 11.07 seconds, placing third, but not without controversy. Officials ruled that Felix and her training partner Jeneba Tarmoh were in a dead heat for third place, the final qualification position, after initially declaring Tarmoh ahead. A run-off between Tarmoh and Felix was scheduled, but Tarmoh eventually withdrew due to emotional and physical fatigue, conceding the final 100-meter spot to Felix. In the 200 meters final at the 2012 Olympic trials, Felix recorded a personal best and a meet record of 21.69 seconds, the third-fastest time an American woman had ever run and the fourth-fastest ever clocked by a female athlete up until that point. Carmelita Jeter and Sanya Richards-Ross placed second and third, respectively. 

At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Felix competed in four events: 100 meters, 200 meters, 4 × 100 meters relay, and 4 × 400 meters relay, placing fifth in the 100 meters and winning gold in the other three, thus becoming the first American woman to win three golds in athletics at an Olympics since Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Summer Olympics. In her first final, the 100 meters final, she placed fifth with a personal best of 10.89 seconds. The 200 meters final, a race she lost twice at the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics to Jamaican rival Veronica Campbell-Brown, proved to be her successful third attempt as she won in 21.88 seconds, outracing a stacked field that included Campbell-Brown, 2012 Olympic 100 meters champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, 2012 Olympic 100 meters silver medalist Carmelita Jeter, and 2012 Olympic 400 meters champion Sanya Richards-Ross. Felix pushed out of the blocks with a strong start and was on par with the Jamaican athletes coming off of the curve before pulling away in the final 50 meters to clinch her long-awaited individual Olympic gold medal. Fraser-Pryce won silver and American compatriot Jeter took the bronze medal.

Felix took to the track again as part of the women&#x27;s 4 × 100 meters relay team alongside Tianna Madison, Bianca Knight, and Jeter. The foursome won with a time of 40.82 seconds, breaking the long-held world record of 41.37 seconds, set by East Germany in October 1985. On the final night of Olympic athletics, Felix ran a 48.2-second leg on the U.S. women&#x27;s 4 × 400 meters relay team that included DeeDee Trotter, Francena McCorory, and Richards-Ross, winning in a time of 3:16.87, the third-fastest time in Olympic history behind the Soviet Union and the United States at the 1988 Summer Olympics, and the fifth-fastest time overall, up until that point.

At the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, Felix entered in the 200 meters and was expected to also appear in the relays, but succumbed to a hamstring injury in the 200 meters final and was carried off the track by her brother. The race was won by Fraser-Pryce.

===2014–15===
After a nine-month layoff due to a hamstring injury, Felix resumed competition in the 400 meters at the Shanghai Diamond League meet in May 2014, in which she finished fifth with a time of 50.81 seconds. She later competed in the 200 meters at the Prefontaine Classic meet, finishing third with a season&#x27;s best of 22.44 seconds.

As the winner of the 2014 IAAF Diamond League 200-meter title, Felix received a bye into the 2015 World Championships in Athletics. Obligated to participate in the 2015 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships but not required to run the 200 meters, she opted for the 400 meters. Felix won the event in 50.19 seconds with a late surge from fourth place at the 300-meter mark, catching Natasha Hastings right before the finish line to earn her ninth U.S. championship title. World number one ranked Francena McCorory and number two Sanya Richards-Ross failed to qualify for the 2015 Beijing World Championships.

The 2015 Beijing World Championships schedule placed the 400-meter final just over an hour after the 200-meter semi-finals, making it virtually impossible to perform to world championship level in both events. As of July 1, Felix held the fastest seed time in both the 400 (0.11 over the fastest competitor) and 200 (0.22 over the fastest competitor), leaving her with a difficult choice as to which event to put her full effort into. Felix eventually chose the 400 meters and later triumphed in the event final with a personal best of 49.26 seconds. She dominated the race from beginning to end, making up the stagger from the start of the gun and never relinquishing her lead to claim the 400 meters title. In doing so, Felix became the first woman to win world titles in the 200 meters and the 400 meters. Additionally, she has now won the most world championship gold medals, and most overall world championship medals, out of any American track and field athlete. She continued to add to her medal collection by earning silver medals in both the 4 × 100 meters relay and 4 × 400 meters relay. In the latter race, Felix received the baton with a significant deficit to the leading Jamaican team, prompting her to sprint a historic split time of 47.72 seconds to regain the lead for the American women before the final handoff. This was the fastest 4 × 400 meters split ever recorded by an American woman and third-fastest 4 × 400 meters split ever by any female athlete, after Jarmila Kratochvílová and Marita Koch. Running the final leg, Francena McCorory failed to hold onto the lead and was overtaken by Novlene Williams-Mills in the final meters.

===2016–17===
Felix began her 2016 season with an uncharacteristically slow start after a gym accident in April, when she dropped from a pull-up bar and landed awkwardly, twisting her right ankle and tearing multiple ligaments. Felix was slated to run in a Diamond League meet in Doha as well as the Prefontaine Classic, but pulled out of both meets. In early June, she ran the 400 meters in 51.23 seconds at a low-key San Diego meet.

Still dealing with the physical repercussions from the accident, Felix raced the 200 meters and 400 meters anyway at the 2016 Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon, attempting to fulfill her goal of completing a 200–400 meters double victory at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. In the 400 meters trials final, she surged from the middle of the pack down the homestretch and overtook the field in the final meters, recording a world-leading time of 49.68 seconds. Then, in the 200 meters final, the lack of speed work due to injury eventually caught up with her as she was narrowly edged out by Jenna Prandini, who dove across the finish line to secure the third and final spot on the team, beating Felix by 0.01 seconds (22.53 to 22.54 seconds). Felix took the rest of July and early part of August off to give her ankle more time to heal while she continued preparations for the Olympics.

At the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Felix bumped her overall Olympic haul to nine overall medals: six golds and three silvers, tying Jamaican legend Merlene Ottey&#x27;s record for the most Olympic medals won by a female track and field athlete, although most of Ottey&#x27;s medal collection consists of individual medals. Felix&#x27;s hope of winning the 400 meters Olympic gold medal came up short after she lost by 0.07 to Shaunae Miller of the Bahamas, who made a legal but unusual dive across the finish line as Felix was quickly closing the distance. Felix recovered from the disappointing performance to win two golds with the U.S. 4 × 100 meters and 4 × 400 meters relay teams. The 4 × 100 meters relay win drew much controversy, as Team USA was initially disqualified in their semi-final run after Felix had dropped the baton during the handoff attempt to English Gardner. However, replays showed that the Brazilian sprinter in the neighboring lane swung her arm and accidentally impeded Felix right before the handoff, causing her to lose her balance. After the appeal was accepted, Team USA was awarded a solo run the next day. With a successful time trial, Felix and her teammates advanced to the final, where they won in 41.01 seconds, the second-fastest 4 × 100 meters relay time in history.

The following year, during the 2017 World Championships in London, Felix added three more medals to her collection, cementing her position as the most decorated athlete in IAAF World Championships history. Felix equaled Merlene Ottey&#x27;s and Usain Bolt&#x27;s 14 medal tally by winning a bronze medal in the 400-meter final with a time of 50.08 seconds. She admitted that the result was disappointing, as she was hoping to defend her title in the discipline. Just a month prior to the championships, Felix had won the London&#x27;s Diamond League meet held at the same track with a world-leading time of 49.65 seconds. Felix earned two additional gold medals by partaking in the 4 × 100 relay and also the 4 × 400 meters relay, in which she ran a 48.7-second leg, bringing her tally up to 16 world championship medals.

===2018–19===
====Pregnancy emergency====

Felix reduced her racing schedule in 2018, stating: &quot;In the 19 years that I&#x27;ve been running track, I&#x27;ve never taken a break. Never had a year where I took it easy. Now that this is kind of a year without a championship, I&#x27;ve had to force myself to have a different approach because my goal is 2020. So, if you guys don&#x27;t see me at as many of the races as I usually run, don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;m fine. I&#x27;m just challenging myself to be smarter.&quot; Later in December 2018, Felix revealed her difficult pregnancy story to espnW. During her 32nd-week pregnancy checkup, doctors discovered that Felix had developed pre-eclampsia, a condition that is disproportionately prevalent in African-American women and is marked by high blood pressure along with potentially harmful childbirth effects. With the baby&#x27;s heart rate steadily decreasing, Felix had to deliver her premature daughter via emergency C-section within 48 hours. Motivated by her life-threatening experience, Felix testified before the United States House Committee on Ways and Means on the topic of the black maternal mortality crisis: &quot;Research shows that racial bias in our maternal health care system includes things like providers spending less time with Black mothers, underestimating the pain of their Black patients, ignoring symptoms and dismissing complaints.&quot;

====Nike controversy====
Felix furthered her maternal advocacy work in May 2019 by penning an op-ed for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, accusing her longtime sponsor Nike of refusing to guarantee salary protections for female athletes in the months following pregnancy. Her story underscored the earlier allegations made by her former Nike teammates Alysia Montaño and Kara Goucher regarding their pregnancy disputes with the sportswear company. In the article, Felix explained that after her contract ended in December 2017, she and Nike negotiated for a contract renewal. Planning to start a family in 2018, Felix asked Nike for written financial security, in case her performance yielded subpar results while recovering from childbirth; the negotiators declined after already offering a 70 percent pay cut in this contract proposal. Soon after, Felix left and signed a clothing sponsorship deal with the Gap Inc.–owned apparel company Athleta in July 2019, becoming their first sponsored athlete. Following the public controversy, Nike altered their maternal policy in August 2019, promising to not apply any performance-related salary reductions for 18 consecutive months, starting eight months before the due date. During this period, the sportswear company would also not float the possibility of termination if the athlete chooses to not race due to pregnancy.

====Return to competition====
In July 2019, Felix competed in her first race since giving birth in November 2018, finishing sixth in the 400-meter sprint at the U.S. national championships in Des Moines, Iowa. Although failing to qualify into the individual 400-meter event for the 2019 Doha World Championships, Felix&#x27;s sixth-place finish still placed her in the U.S. 4 × 400 meters relay pool. In the first-ever mixed-gender 4 × 400 meters relay at the world championships, Felix competed with Michael Cherry, Wil London III, and Courtney Okolo to set a world record time of 3:09.34. Felix ran a 50.4-second split for her leg. She earned another gold medal as a runner in the preliminary heats for the U.S. women&#x27;s 4 × 400 meters relay, although she was not selected to participate in the final. With her 12th and 13th world championship gold medals, Felix surpassed Usain Bolt for the most golds by any athlete in World Athletics Championships history.

===2020–2022===
Felix trained during the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of qualifying for her fifth Olympic Games – her first as a mother. She completed workouts on streets, empty soccer fields, and beaches after Gavin Newsom&#x27;s quarantine measures were first enacted throughout California in March 2020. A former participant in the US Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s &quot;Project Believe&quot; program in 2008, she volunteered again for &quot;Project Believe 2020&quot; to help test an unprecedented sample collection procedure for athletes during the coronavirus stay-at-home orders.

In June 2021, two years after she publicized her contract dispute with Nike, Felix launched her own footwear company, Saysh, and began wearing spikes created by the brand into competitions. Within the same month, at the U.S. Olympic trials, the 35-year-old American qualified for the 400 meters individual event by finishing second with a time of 50.02 seconds, a new masters athletics record (35–40 age group) and also her fastest time since July 2017.

Leading up to the 400 meters final of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, some doubted that Felix would stand on the podium again for her final individual Olympic event due to her age, U.S. Olympics trials performance, and semi-final time. Every finalist in the 400 meters final ran sub-50 seconds in their semi-final, with Felix running the second-slowest qualifying time of 49.89 seconds. Despite the odds, Felix ran 49.46 seconds in the final to claim the bronze medal, her 10th overall Olympic medal. This accomplishment lowered her 400-meter masters athletics record, tied her with Carl Lewis as the most decorated American track and field Olympian, and broke her tie with Merlene Ottey as the most decorated female track and field Olympian. Felix concluded her Olympic career after winning gold in the women&#x27;s 4 × 400 meters final, alongside a team that included Sydney McLaughlin, Dalilah Muhammad, and Athing Mu. This 11th Olympic medal broke Felix&#x27;s tie with Carl Lewis and officially established her as the most decorated American track and field athlete in Olympic history.

In April 2022, Felix announced that she would retire at the end of that year&#x27;s season. Her last competition was the World Athletics Championships in Eugene in July 2022, where she won gold in the women&#x27;s 4 × 400 meters relay and bronze in the mixed 4 × 400 meters relay.

<text>The Timiș or Tamiš (, , , ) is a river that flows through the Banat region of Romania and Serbia and joins the Danube near Pančevo, in northern Serbia. Due to its position in the region, it has been labeled as the &quot;spine of the Banat&quot;.

==Name==
In antiquity, the river was known as &quot;Tibiscus&quot; (in Latin) and &quot;Tibisis&quot; (Θίβισις in ancient Greek), and as &quot;Timisis&quot; in De Administrando Imperio; in addition, Edward Gibbon referred to it as the &quot;Teyss&quot;.

&quot;The Romans, who traversed the plains of Hungary, suppose that they passed several navigable rivers, either in canoes or portable boats; but there is reason to suspect that the winding stream of the Teyss, or Tibiscus, might present itself in different places under different names.&quot; 

==Geography==
The drainage area covers , of which in Romania. With the Danube, the Timis belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin. The river flows through Romania for , and through Serbia. Its average discharge at the mouth is .

The source of the river is near the mountain resort Semenic, in the Semenic Mountains, Caraș-Severin County, Romania. It flows towards the southeast, through the Trei Ape Reservoir, until it turns north near Teregova. Downstream from Caransebeș it turns northwest. It leaves the mountains and enters the Banat plain near Lugoj. After entering Banat, the river becomes slow and meandering. The most important port is the heavily industrialized Pančevo.

At the river&#x27;s mouth, on the right bank, there is a forested area, the Pančevo Forest. It covers of marshland, with several dozen of deciduous species and 176 species of birds and mammals. The colonies of magnificent bryozoans were found in the river.

In June 2023, Serbian government began process of declaring a landscape of outstanding features Potamišje (&quot;Tamiš valley&quot;). It will protect the river&#x27;s flood valley on the territory of Zrenjanin, Kovačica, and Opovo municipalities. A spatial plan for wider valley area (including Sečanj and Plandište) has been concurrently made.

==Characteristics==

Within the scopes of the Interreg IPA program, conducted jointly by Romania and Serbia, the area around the river has been arranged in the 2017-2019 period. Starting from Timiș&#x27; origin in Romania, up to its mouth in Serbia, the bird watch towers, benches, gazebos, small bridges, billboards, signposts and waste containers have been placed. The bicycle paths along the river have been built and locations for recreational fishing have been set. At Pančevo, near the confluence, there are catamarans, canoes and bicycles for renting.

The right bank, on river&#x27;s course through Pančevo close to its mouth, was arranged as a promenade in the 1980s. A plan of massive reconstruction of the quay and urbanization of the area was announced for years and confirmed in June 2020. Section between the bridge and old shipyard facilities will be completely reconstructed with addition of renovation of &quot;city pontoon&quot; (floating platform for various public activities), sports and recreation fields, skate park, ski slopes, bicycle paths, etc. The project is titles &quot;Pančevo Promenade&quot;. It also includes the footbridge across the Timiș which will connect the city with the City Forest which stretches along the opposite, un-urbanized bank. The forest degraded in time and will be rejuvenated as part of the same project. The anti-flood embankments will be re-fortified, too. The deadline is 2023.

Arranged beach on the Timiș, with paid tickets and some 200 visitors daily, was recorded in Pančevo in 1891. Later, two beaches developed in Donji Grad neighborhood, left of the bridge across the river: Waltman&#x27;s and municipal (also called students or military beach). The former was paid and had pontoons, while the latter, with two marked basins, was open for everyone. Sports club &quot;Banat&quot; held revues and competitions on the municipal beach in the 1920s, which survived until the 1970s. Upstream, there was another beach in Gornji Grad neighborhood called &quot;At three carrots&quot;, while the wild beach &quot;Bećar Lido&quot; developed on the very mouth into the Danube.

By the 2020s, several beaches developed along the river&#x27;s banks, outside if Pančevo. At Idvor, 250 poplars were planted, to restore the natural vegetation balance along the river. A small bridge was placed, and the crushed stone was poured before the beach, to purify and clear the water. In Glogonj, there is Skela beach. In Jabuka, there are two beaches. One, also called Skela, was arranged as part of the joint Serbian-Romanian project &quot;Eco-Timiș - new touristic product&quot;. The other one is Pesak. All got new access roads, some of them have barges-restaurants, some sports fields, etc.

==Navigation==
In its lower course, the river is regulated, and for the last it is navigable.

Pančevo had a busy port already in the 17th century, when it was occupied by the Ottoman Turks. Later, in Habsburg period, it became a hub of the river routes in the Banat region. The grain was transported to the capital Vienna, while later, with the industrialization of Pančevo, shipping of the beer, silk, salt, bricks and timber developed. In time, a row of halls, warehouses and storage object along the river bank were built. With the appearance of the steam power, the passenger transport developed too, connecting Pančevo and Serbian capital Belgrade. As Pančevo grew into the developed industrial center, by the early 20th century the traffic on Timiș became so intensive that the river had to be rerouted and straighten, with numerous canals being cut through around it.

===Lighthouses===

At the mouth of the Timiș into the Danube, there are two lighthouses, one on the each bank of the Timiș. They are one of the rare inland lighthouses in Europe, as the banks of the rivers are usually visible so there is no need for them. They are also among only few inland lighthouses in the world, and the only one in Europe, that were built in pair. Measured by the Danube, they are located at Danube&#x27;e , on its left bank, and from downtown Pančevo.

The lighthouses were built during the &quot;golden age&quot; of the steam-powered river traffic. They are designed in the military style. The cone-shaped bases have in diameter, and are plated with stone. The towers are sturdy and massive, built of yellow bricks. Doors and paned windows are framed with decorative garlands made of bricks. The top platform has an open terrace with the powerful lighthouse reflector. The terrace is covered with cone-shaped roof, resting on the metal rods.

After the works to improve the navigation were conducted in the early 20th century, river&#x27;s mouth area was left without any landmarks. The trees and overgrowth were cut during the digging of the canals so the area and the course of the river was new and unfamiliar to the ship crews. Situation became dangerous, especially at night, as there were no natural orienteering marks, so the wreckages became frequent. To prevent this, the lighthouses were built in 1909. The one on the right bank of the Timiș is built in the Ferland locality, while the left one is in the Pančevo&#x27;s section of Mali Rit. They became very popular. The honking of the ships passing next to them was considered &quot;obligatory&quot;, while the young boatmen and town youth used to visit and climb onto them, as a sort of the adolescent dare games. They were also writing and carving their names and short notes on the bricks, so by the time of the 2000s reconstruction, almost none of the bricks were carve-free.

Since then, the steamboats were replaced with modern ships and Pančevo got a new port on the Daunube, so the old one, on the Timiș, was closed. The lighthouses went out of use in the 1960s and were left to the elements. In time, the locals stripped from them all that could be taken and transported by the boat, including metal staircases, oil lamps, etc. The stone slabs were used for paving private backyards and the bases, without this stone cover, were being partially washed off by thy river which compromised the integrity of the objects as they began to tilt and the collapse became a serious threat.

The reconstruction of the lighthouses began in the 21st century, and was finished by 2019. Geodetic surveys were conducted and the old photographs were used in the reconstruction. The carved writings on the bricks were documented by the Pančevo&#x27;s Cultural Monuments Protection Institute. The lighthouses are protected by the law as the Cultural Heritage of Great Importance.

==Flooding==
After Banat, floods occur in rainy years. Especially devastating were the floods of 2005, when the villages Boka and Jaša Tomić were badly damaged. On April 20, 2005, a level of was recorded, the highest ever since the measurements began.

In the spring of 2007 works on the elevation of the embankments on both banks of the river began, on the right bank and on the left. The embankments will be higher than they are now and being higher than should prevent any future floodings.

In some parts of the low, marshy areas created by the floods, several fish-filled lakes have been created, most notably at Banatski Despotovac, Uzdin, Sakule and Slatina.

==Settlements==
===Romania===
Major cities in its Romanian course are Caransebeș and Lugoj, smaller places include (from source to mouth):
*Teregova, Armeniș, Slatina-Timiș, Bucoșnița, Buchin, Caransebeș, Constantin Daicoviciu, Sacu, Gavojdia, Lugoj, Coșteiu, Moșnița Nouă, Șag, Parța, Peciu Nou
Timișoara has its name derived from the river Timiș meaning the fortress of Timiș. However the town of Timiș City, even though its name may indicate it, is not a settlement on the river, but on another Romanian-Serbian river, Bega.

===Serbia===
From source to mouth: Jaša Tomić, Šurjan, Boka, Sečanj, Neuzina, Banatski Despotovac, Botoš, Tomaševac, Orlovat, Uzdin, Idvor, Farkaždin, Sakule, Čenta, Baranda, Opovo, Sefkerin, Glogonj, Jabuka, Pančevo

After the Austrians officially took over the lands north of the Sava and Danube in the early 18th century, at the Timiș&#x27; mouth into the Danube, there was a derelict Ottoman stockade, surrounded by the palisades. In 1716 the Austrians began construction of the new, larger proper fortress, and finished it in 1720. It was a pentagon shaped structure built for artillery warfare., with brick-layered bastions, triangular ramparts, and a pontoon bridge across the Timiș. It resembled the Belgrade Fortress, and bailey of the Petrovaradin Fortress.

Settlement which developed within the fortress was the core of modern Panćevo. One of the stipulations of the 1739 Austrian-Ottoman Treaty of Belgrade was that Austria had to demolish all fortifications built in the previous two decades. Pančevo Fortress was razed to the ground, with nothing surviving above the ground level, but the settlement remained as a border town. Old downtown of Pančevo, and its street grid, were shaped by the size, position and orientation of the fortress. During the reconstruction of the City Park in 2013, remains of the foundations and brick walls of the southern rampart were discovered.

==Pančevački Rit==

The river&#x27;s old mouth into the Danube was some to the north-west, between villages of Čenta and Surduk, thus it was shorter. Canal Karaš remained marking old river bed, and the area bounded by the old and new river beds and the Danube, is called Pančevački Rit (Pančevo Marsh). The large wetland was constantly flooded, but since World War II it has been drained part by part and almost half of it is turned into a very fertile patch of land, suitable especially for cultivating grains and vegetables. It is managed by Serbian largest agricultural company, &quot;PKB Beograd&quot;, which almost exclusively provides food for 2 million people in wider Belgrade area, thus Pančevački Rit is commonly nicknamed Granary of Belgrade. Stockbreeding is also very intensive, and so are fishery and hunting.

Many meandering canals and bogs remained in the marsh: slow streams of Vizelj, Dunavac, Sibnica, Butuš, Rogoznica, Buk, Belanoš and Sebeš, and large bogs of Reva, Veliko Blato (), Sebeš and Široka Bara. In the south, area ends with a river island (&quot;ada&quot;) Kožara ().

After being almost uninhabited before 1945, today its population density is above average for Serbia as a whole, since some of the fastest growing suburbs of Belgrade (Borča, Padinska Skela and Krnjača) are built there. The whole area of Pančevački Rit belongs administratively to Belgrade&#x27;s municipality of Palilula.

<text>&quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot; (also known as &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song (You Fill Up My Senses)&quot;) is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter John Denver. The song was released as the lead single from his eighth studio album &quot;Back Home Again&quot;. It was his second number-one song in the United States, occupying that spot for two weeks in July 1974. &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot; also went to number one on the Easy Listening chart. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the No. 25 song for 1974.

It went to number one in the United Kingdom, where it was Denver&#x27;s only major hit single. Four years later, an instrumental version also became flautist James Galway&#x27;s only major British hit.

==Background==
&quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot; was written as an ode to Denver&#x27;s wife at the time, Annie Martell Denver. Denver &quot;wrote this song in January 1973 in about ten-and-a-half minutes one day on a ski lift&quot; to the top of Aspen Mountain in Aspen, Colorado, as the physical exhilaration of having &quot;just skied down a very difficult run&quot; and the feeling of total immersion in the beauty of the colors and sounds that filled all senses inspired him to think about his wife. Annie Denver recalls the beginnings: &quot;It was written after John and I had gone through a pretty intense time together and things were pretty good for us. He left to go skiing and he got on the Ajax chair on Aspen mountain and the song just came to him. He skied down and came home and wrote it down... Initially it was a love song and it was given to me through him, and yet for him it became a bit like a prayer.&quot;

&quot;The first time I heard &#x27;Annie&#x27;s Song,&#x27; I told John it had the same melody as Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Fifth Symphony, Second Movement,&quot; says Milt Okun. &quot;He walked over to the piano, sat for an hour and came back, and the only thing remaining from Tchaikovsky was the first five notes. It was fantastic.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Shawn M. Haney of Allmusic noted the song&#x27;s expressive emotionality, calling it an &quot;ever so romantic tearjerker&quot;. Haney praised &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot; as &quot;one of Denver&#x27;s finest achievements&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;fine love song.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that this &quot;folk ballad, subtle and sweet, glows with a continental flair that should take it to all the right places.&quot;

==Ville Valo cover==

On July 4, 2016, Ville Valo released a cover version of &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot; in Finnish, titled &quot;Olet mun kaikuluotain&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;re My Sonar&quot;). The lyrics were by Hector, and the song had previously been recorded in 1976 by Freeman. Ville Valo&#x27;s version was released as a tribute to Finnish label Love Records, who celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2016. Valo&#x27;s version was also the first release from the label in over 30 years. Valo commented on the song, stating: &quot;&#x27;Kaikuluotain&#x27; is a childhood favorite of mine, to the beat of which many a sleepless night ended up in tears. To this day it gives me cold shivers and goosebumps.&quot; The song would go on to reach number one on the Finnish Download Chart.

Valo&#x27;s version also received a music video, directed by Ykä Järvinen. Released on July 11, 2016, the video features scenes of Valo walking around Helsinki, done in tribute to Aki Kaurismäki&#x27;s film &quot;Calamari Union&quot;. The video received the Emma Award for Video of the Year in 2017.

== Adaptations ==

Supporters of Sheffield United use the melody of &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot; as &quot;The Greasy Chip Butty Song&quot;, a football chant with recast lyrics humorously extolling the virtues of life in Sheffield and as supporters of the club.

The Egan band performed Bilintx&#x27;s song &quot;Louolan Jai Jai&quot; with this tune, which became the common tune for the song.

A parody version of the first few bars of the song is included on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot;, but was removed and replaced with an apology on later pressings of the album on legal advice.
