<text>Tom London (born Leonard T. Clapman; August 24, 1889 – December 5, 1963) was an American actor who played frequently in B-Westerns. According to &quot;The Guinness Book of Movie Records&quot;, London is credited with appearing in the most films in the history of Hollywood, according to the 2001 book &quot;Film Facts&quot;, which says that the performer who played in the most films was &quot;Tom London, who made his first of over 2,000 appearances in &quot;The Great Train Robbery, 1903&quot;. He used his birth name in films until 1924.

==Life and career==
Born in Louisville, Kentucky, London got his start in movies as a props man in Chicago, Illinois. His debut was in 1915 in the Western &quot;Lone Larry&quot;, performing under his own name. The first film in which he was billed under his new name was &quot;Winds of Chance&quot;, a World War I film, in which he played &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot;. London was a trick rider and roper, and used his trick skills in scores of Westerns. In the silent-film era, he often played villainous roles, while in later years, he often appeared as the sidekick to Western stars such as Sunset Carson in several films.

One of the busiest character actors, he appeared in over 600 films. London made many guest appearances in television shows through the 1950s, such as &quot;The Range Rider&quot;, with Jock Mahoney and Dick Jones. He also played Sam, the attendant of Helen Ramirez&#x27;s (Katy Jurado) in &quot;High Noon&quot;. His last movie was &quot;Underworld U.S.A.&quot; in 1961, and his final roles on TV were in &quot;Lawman&quot; and &quot;The Dakotas&quot;.

==Personal life==

London married actress Edith Stayart (1890 - August 7, 1970), born Edythe B. Stayart, who has several roles in films in the 1920s including &quot;Nan of the North&quot;. On July 5, 1952, he married Louvie Munal in Del Rio, Texas.

==Death==
London died at his home in North Hollywood at age 74.

<text>Vito Anthony Marcantonio (December 10, 1902 – August 9, 1954) was an American lawyer and politician who served East Harlem for seven terms in the United States House of Representatives.

For most of his political career, he was a member of the American Labor Party, believing that neither major American political party supported the interests of the working class. For two years prior to his party switching to Labor, he was a New Deal coalition member of the progressive branch of the Republican Party as a supporter of Fiorello LaGuardia (the progressive, pro-New Deal Republican mayor of New York at the time). Marcantonio was a socialist and supporter of political causes and positions which he deemed in the interests of the working class, poor, immigrants, labor unions, and African-American civil rights.

Marcantonio represented the neighborhood of East Harlem in New York City (containing the smaller neighborhoods of Italian Harlem and Spanish Harlem), which was home to many ethnic Italians, Jews, African-Americans, and Puerto Ricans. He spoke Spanish, Italian, and English. Marcantonio advocated fiercely for the rights of African-Americans, Italian-American immigrants, and Puerto Rican immigrants in Harlem, as well as for unions and workers in general.

==Early life and education==
Marcantonio was the son of an American-born father and Italian-born mother, both with origins in Picerno, in the Basilicata region of Southern Italy. He was born on December 10, 1902, in the impoverished Italian Harlem ghetto of East Harlem, New York City. He attended New York City public schools, becoming the only member of his class from East Harlem to graduate from De Witt Clinton High School in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, and eventually received his LL.B. from the New York University School of Law in 1925.

==Career==
In the 1920 United States presidential election, Marcantonio campaigned for Parley P. Christensen, the candidate of the Farmer-Labor Party. In 1924, he became campaign manager for the congressional campaign of Fiorello La Guardia, then a Progressive–Socialist. Together, LaGuardia and Marcantonio also campaigned for U.S. Senator Robert M. La Follette for President. Marcantonio also became secretary of the Tenants League, which fought high rents and evictions.

After passing the New York bar examination in 1925, Marcatonio began practicing law, first for Foster, La Guardia, and Cutler. He clerked at the law firm of Swinburne Hale, Walter Nelles, and Isaac Shorr, known for its representation of politically radical individuals and organizations. There, he worked with labor lawyer Joseph R. Brodsky, who &quot;significantly contributed to his left orientation&quot; toward Marxism.

From 1926 to 1932, Marcantonio ran La Guardia&#x27;s campaigns every two years. From 1930 to 1931, he worked as an assistant United States attorney.

==Political career==

===U.S. Congress===

Marcantonio was first elected to the United States House of Representatives from New York in 1934 as a Republican. He received a warm write-up in the &quot;New Masses&quot; in the November 1936 issue. He served in the House from 1935 until 1937 but was defeated in 1936 for re-election. Marcantonio&#x27;s district was centered in his native East Harlem, New York City, which had many residents and immigrants of Italian and Puerto Rican origin. Fluent in Spanish as well as Italian, he was considered an ally of the Puerto Rican and Italian-American communities, and an advocate for the rights of the workers, immigrants, and the poor.

In 1939, Marcantonio criticized the 1936 prosecution and conviction of Puerto Rican Nationalist Party president Pedro Albizu Campos on charges of sedition and other crimes against the United States. In addition to defending the Puerto Rican and Italian communities and common workers, Marcantonio was a strong advocate of Harlem&#x27;s African-American communities and fought vehemently for black civil rights decades before the civil rights movement of the 1950s–1960s. In either 1937 or 1938, Marcantonio became a member of the American Labor Party (ALP). He was elected to the House again from New York in 1938, and served this time for six terms, from 1939 to 1951, being reelected in the elections of 1940, 1942, 1944, 1946, and 1948. He was so popular in that district that he cross-filed in the cross-filing primaries between Democratic and Republican primaries, and won the nominations of both parties. He also gained the endorsement of the ALP, in an example of electoral fusion.

Aside from Marcantonio, the only other ALP congressman was Leo Isacson, who served in Congress from 1948 to 1949, after winning a special election; he was defeated in the next general election. On election day in 1946, a Republican election captain named Joseph Scottoriggio, who was supporting Marcantonio&#x27;s opponent, was severely beaten and died days later. New York City mobster Mike Coppola is believed to have been responsible.

On November 25, 1947, the day after the House voted for indictment of the Hollywood Ten for contempt of Congress, Representative Walter Judd attacked Marcantonio by likening the ALP to the China Democratic League in China at that time. He said: &quot;The history of the Democratic League is astonishingly like that of the American Labor Party to which the gentleman belongs. It was originally a coalition of labor groups, liberals and Communists. Then the genuine liberals discovered that it and they were being used as fronts or tools of the Communists, and, as the gentleman from New York is well aware, they broke off and established the Liberal Party.&quot;

In 1948, Marcantonio was an avid supporter of former Vice President Henry A. Wallace, who ran for President on the Progressive Party ticket. A campaign film by Carl Marzani shows Marcantonio&#x27;s district and his efforts on its behalf. Marcantonio became state chairman of the ALP in January, and was reelected in November. In 1949, Marcantonio ran for Mayor of New York City on the ALP ticket but was defeated.

Marcantonio was able to win reelection in 1948 due to the Democrats and Republicans splitting the vote. Republican Thomas J. Curran and Democratic Ferdinand Pecora worked together to find a compromise candidate. Jonathan Brewster Bingham, John Ellis, James J. Lanzetta, Thomas Francis Murphy, and Wendell Willkie&#x27;s wife Edith Willkie were considered. James G. Donovan was selected.

Marcantonio attacked Donovan as a &quot;Sutton Place Dixiecrat&quot;. He was defeated by Donovan in the 1950 election. The Liberals opposed Donovan in later elections. The passage of the Wilson Pakula Act in 1947 also played some part in Marcantonio&#x27;s defeat. The law prevented candidates from running in the primaries of parties with which they were not affiliated. It was widely perceived as being directed against Marcantonio. As the sole representative of his party for most of his years in Congress, Marcantonio never held a committee chairmanship. After his defeat in 1950 and the withdrawal of the Communist Party support for the ALP, the party soon fell apart.

==Political ideology==
Marcantonio was inspired politically by his Roman Catholic faith. He had always identified himself as a Catholic. In 1939, while speaking at the National Conference of the ILD, he described himself as &quot;a Roman Catholic who has not deserted the faith of his fathers.&quot;

Marcantonio, who was arguably one of the most left-wing members of Congress, said that party loyalty was less important than voting with his conscience. He was sympathetic to the Socialist and Communist parties, and to labor unions. He was investigated by the FBI in the 1940s and 1950s because of his extensive affiliation with members of the Communist Party and known Communist front groups.

===Civil rights===
In 2010, historian Thaddeus Russell described Marcantonio as &quot;one of the greatest champions of black civil rights during the 1930s and 1940s.&quot; He sponsored bills to prohibit the poll tax, used by the Southern United States to disenfranchise poor voters, and to make lynching a federal crime.

===Foreign policy===
In 1940, Marcantonio helped form the American Peace Mobilization (APM), a group whose aim was to keep the U.S. from participating in World War II. Before the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in Moscow August 23, 1939, the APM&#x27;s precursor organization, the Comintern-directed American League for Peace and Democracy, had been anti-Nazi. Marcantonio served as the APM&#x27;s vice-chair. He appeared in a newsreel in 1940 denouncing &quot;the imperialist war&quot;, a line taken by Joseph Stalin and his supporters in the Soviet Union (USSR) until Operation Barbarossa. The Pact lasted until the Germans broke it by invading the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. In 1942, Marcantonio worked to expand the U.S. military commitment to a second front in Europe against the Nazi German expansion, which became Operation Torch. The USSR ordered Communist parties throughout the world to promote the idea to help it defeat Nazism. Marcantonio was also a vice president of the International Workers Order, a fraternal benefit society unofficially affiliated with the Communist Party.

In 1947, when the U.S. Congress passed legislation to provide financial aid to fight communism in Turkey and Greece, such as during the Greek Civil War, Marcantonio was the only congressman to not applaud the action, symbolizing his disagreement with the Truman Doctrine. In 1950, Marcantonio opposed American involvement in the Korean War. He argued that North Korea had been the victim of an unprovoked attack by South Korea. He cited articles by I. F. Stone, a radical journalist.

===Freedom of expression===
In 1941, Marcantonio represented Dale Zysman, a high school coach and board member of the New York City Teachers Union also known as Jack Hardy, a communist writer for International Publishers, in a New York Board of Education hearing. Marcantonio asked for a ten-day stay because the Board had failed to present &quot;an itemized bill of particulars&quot;, which stay the Board denied. Zysman walked out.

===Spanish in Puerto Rico&#x27;s schools===
In 1946, Marcantonio introduced legislation to restore Spanish as the language of instruction in Puerto Rico&#x27;s schools asking President Harry S. Truman to sign the bill &quot;in the name of the children of Puerto Rico who are being tortured by the prevailing system…to fight cultural chauvinism and to correct past errors.&quot; President Truman signed the bill. In 1948, schools were able to return to teaching in the Spanish language, but English was required in schools as a second language.

==Later life and death==
After his defeat in mayoral and congressional elections, Marcantonio continued to practice law. It was his law practice, maintained while in Congress, that had generated the money by which he substantially self-financed his political campaigns. At first, he practiced in Washington, D.C., but he soon returned to New York City. He resigned as state chairman of the ALP soon after the 1953 election, citing an &quot;inherent division&quot; that prevented it from acting as an independent political force. At the time of his death in 1954, Marcantonio was running for Congress as the candidate of a newly formed third party, the Good Neighbor Party. He died on August 9, 1954, from a heart attack after coming up the subway stairs on Broadway by City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan. As a devout Catholic, he was given conditional absolution and extreme unction, the last sacrament of the Church.

==Legacy==
Marcantonio&#x27;s collection of speeches, &quot;I Vote My Conscience&quot; (1956), edited by Annette Rubinstein, influenced the next generation of young radicals. His defense of workers rights, his mastery of parliamentary procedure, his ability to relate to the workers in his district while also engaging in worldwide issues, made him a hero to a certain section of the left. Rubinstein&#x27;s book was reprinted in a new edition in 2002.

Tony Kushner&#x27;s play &quot;The Intelligent Homosexual&#x27;s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures&quot; has a main character who is a fictional &quot;cousin&quot; of Vito Marcantonio.

<doc id="1018753" wikidata="Q455782" url="?curid=1018753" title="Lise Thibault">
<text>Lise Thibault DStJ (; born 2 April 1939) is a Canadian politician who served as the 27th Lieutenant Governor of Quebec from 1997 to 2007. She later spent six months in jail for misuse of public funds, which she was ordered to repay the government. As of , she is the only Canadian vice-regal representative to have been incarcerated.

==Early life==
Born in Saint-Roch-de-l&#x27;Achigan, Quebec, she was the eldest daughter of Paul Trudel and Laurenza Wolfe. She was educated at the Académie Marie-Anne de Montréal, and then went on to teachers&#x27; college at Cégep de Saint-Jérôme. She married René Thibault in 1959. Thibault was permanently disabled in a tobogganing accident as a teenager, and uses a wheelchair.

==Career==
Thibault taught with the adult education department of the Milles-Îles and Des Écores school boards from 1973 to 1978. She worked for Télé-Métropole from 1977 to 1981. From 1982 to 1984 she was a host and researcher at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as for programs about family and community issues. She was the vice president for Quebec&#x27;s Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (CSST) from 1987 to 1993. She was president and CEO of the Office des personnes handicapées du Québec from 1993 to 1995.

She was closely associated with the federal Liberal Party for many years, and on the advice of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, the Governor General appointed her Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, following the resignation of Jean-Louis Roux in 1997. She became Quebec&#x27;s first female viceroy, and the first disabled lieutenant governor in Canada. In February 2005 Thibault had a stroke. She was one of the longest serving lieutenant governors in Canadian history, serving for over ten years.

==Trial and imprisonment for fraud==
Beginning in 2007, Thibault was accused of spending beyond the limits of her expense account. Questions on her spending continued after her departure, with federal and provincial auditors general pointing to $700,000 in unjustified expenses. Among the expenses were:
* $45,000 for &quot;gifts&quot; without the names of recipients.
* $24,000 to transport her official van to the United States while she was on vacation, rather than renting a car there.
* $12,000 to the provincial air service for a one-day fishing trip in the Gaspe region.
* $44,000 in &quot;tips&quot; paid by her bodyguards during hotel stays and sporting activities.

The files were turned over to the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for investigation. She was criminally charged for offences involving fraud, breach of trust, forgery and fabrication of false documents related to the misspending of public funds during her ten years in office. Thibault&#x27;s lawyer argued unsuccessfully in Quebec Superior Court that Thibault should receive sovereign immunity, because &quot;the Crown&#x27;s prosecution cannot prosecute the Crown&quot;—referring to her prior office as the Queen&#x27;s representative in Quebec.

In September 2015 she was sentenced 18 months in jail and was ordered to repay the government $300,000 ($200,000 to Ottawa and $100,000 to Québec) after pleading guilty to fraud and breach of trust in 2014. Judge Carol St-Cyr outlined her crimes, pointing out that she &quot;took advantage of holes in the system and abused her position of authority to pay for trips, golf lessons and birthday parties... [and] forgot that her role as lieutenant-governor was to be a good example for Quebecers.&quot;

On 24 February 2016, the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld Thibault&#x27;s 18-month sentence, and the next day Thibault surrendered at the Quebec City Detention Centre. She was transferred in late February 2016 to the Leclerc Detention Centre in Laval, Quebec. She was granted a conditional release on 2 June 2016, and was fully discharged on 17 August 2017. In the meantime, she filed for bankruptcy in June of that year, citing of debt of $1.5 million to Canada Revenue Agency and Revenu Québec (the initial $300,000 she was ordered to pay had already been reimbursed).

==Honours==
As a former viceregal representative of Elizabeth II, as Queen in Right of Quebec, Thibault is styled &quot;The Honourable&quot; for life.

Thibault has received 3 honorary degrees:

<text>Bess Flowers (November 23, 1898 – July 28, 1984) was an American actress best known for her work as an extra in hundreds of films. She was known as &quot;The Queen of the Hollywood Extras,&quot; appearing in more than 350 feature films and numerous comedy shorts in her 41-year career.

She holds the record for appearances in films nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture (23).

==Career==
Born in Sherman, Texas, Flowers&#x27; film debut came in 1923, when she appeared in &quot;Hollywood&quot;. She made three films that year, and then began working extensively. Many of her appearances are uncredited, as she generally played non-speaking roles.

By the 1930s, Flowers was in constant demand. Her appearances ranged from Alfred Hitchcock and John Ford thrillers to comedic roles alongside of Charley Chase, the Three Stooges, Leon Errol, Edgar Kennedy, and Laurel and Hardy.

She appeared in the following five films which won the Academy Award for Best Picture: &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take it with You&quot;, &quot;All About Eve&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, and &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;. In each of these movies, Flowers was uncredited. Including these five movies, she had appeared in twenty-three Best Picture nominees in total, making her the record holder for most appearances in films nominated for the award. Her last movie was &quot;Good Neighbor Sam&quot; in 1964.

Flowers&#x27;s acting career was not confined to feature films. She was also seen in many episodic American TV series, such as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, notably in episodes, &quot;Lucy Is Enceinte&quot; (1952), &quot;Ethel&#x27;s Birthday&quot; (1955), and &quot;Lucy&#x27;s Night in Town&quot; (1957), where she is usually seen as a theatre patron.

Outside her acting career, in 1945, Flowers helped to found the Screen Extras Guild (active: 1946–1992, then merged with the Screen Actors Guild), where she served as one of its first vice-presidents and recording secretaries.

==Personal life==
Flowers was first married on September 2, 1923, in Ventura County, California, to Cullen Tate, an assistant director for Cecil B. DeMille. They had a daughter, and they were divorced in 1928 in Los Angeles.

==Death==
Flowers died on July 28, 1984, at age 85 in the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.

<doc id="1018765" wikidata="Q1379898" url="?curid=1018765" title="Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania">
<text>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT; ) is the federation of Lutheran churches in Tanzania and one of the largest Lutheran denominations in the world, with more than 6 million members, or 13% of the Tanzanian population. It is the second largest Lutheran church in the world and the largest Lutheran church in East Africa.

The church is led by a presiding bishop and twenty-eight diocesan bishops, representing 28 dioceses. The head office of the church is in Mbeya, since 1967. The church is affiliated with the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), the Christian Council of Tanzania, the Global Confessional and Missional Lutheran Forum, and the Lutheran World Federation.

The ELCT is an organization which reaches out to the people of Tanzania offering worship opportunities, Christian education, and numerous social services, including disaster response, healthcare, and AIDS education and relief.

== History ==

The first Lutheran missionaries arrived in what was then German East Africa in 1887, when the Evangelical Missionary Society for East Africa (EMS), based in Berlin, Germany, established a missionary station at Kigamboni, Dar es Salaam. The second group of missionaries was also from Germany, entering via South Africa and settling in the Southern Highlands region of Tanzania. Similar missions from Germany continued to arrive in the region continuously throughout the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. This mission activity continued in spite of the interruption of the Hehe Wars in 1891, the Maji Maji Uprising of 1905–1907, World War I, and World War II.

In 1938, seven Lutheran churches were loosely gathered into the Federation of Lutheran Churches in Tanganyika. The member churches then merged to become the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania.

In 1964, Johannes Lilje, then presiding bishop of the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany, consecrated Stefano Moshi, who had been elected as the first president of the newly formed church body and who had been an advocate for the establishment of episcopacy, as the first presiding bishop of the ELCT.

== Organization ==
The seat of the church is in Arusha. It is financed mainly from collections and donations as well as through project grants from churches in the Global North.

The ELCT is led by a presiding bishop, or &quot;Mkuu&quot;, who is elected to serve four year terms, and 24 bishops who preside over their local dioceses. The presiding bishop is elected for a four-year term from amongst the bishops of the dioceses. The ELCT&#x27;s current presiding bishop is Alex Malasusa.

=== Presiding bishops ===
=== Clergy and church body ===
The ELCT employs 1360 ordained pastors (28 of them overseas), 3000 lay evangelists, and 300 community officers to aid the work of the church (2014 figures). Women are not ordained in all ELCT dioceses; however, as of 1990, the national church does ordain women. Ordination of women is a sensitive topic in the ELCT and the church is largely split. Currently, local dioceses make their own decision on whether to ordain women or not.

The ELCT is one of the fastest growing churches in the world, with an annual growth in baptized members of around 8%.

===Social services=== 
Social service programming is central to the mission of the ELCT. The social services offered by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania include the following departments:

*Education (Secondary and University)
*Finance and Administration
*Health and Medical Care (21 hospitals and numerous local pharmacies)
*Mission and Evangelism
*Planning and Development
*Social Services and Women&#x27;s Work
*HIV/AIDS Program
*Disaster Response

== Dioceses ==
The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tanzania consists of the following regional dioceses:
* Central Diocese
* Dodoma Diocese
* East of Lake Victoria Diocese
* Eastern &amp; Coastal Diocese
* Iringa Diocese
* Karagwe Diocese
* Konde Diocese

==Beliefs==
===Lutheranism===

Lutheranism is associated with the theology of Martin Luther, with its official confessional writings found in the Book of Concord. Lutheranism generally accepts the unaltered Augsburg Confession (not the variata) as a true witness to the Gospel. Lutheran clergy tend not to subscribe to a doctrine of Biblical inerrancy, but see validity in various scholarly methods of analysis to help in understanding the Bible. This is in concord with most moderate Protestant bodies and in contrast to the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod in the United States, which practices the historical-grammatical method of biblical interpretation.

Like other Lutheran church bodies, the ELCT confesses two sacraments: Communion (or the Eucharist) and Holy Baptism (including infant baptism). Confession and absolution is often included as a sacrament; however, as it is a return to the forgiveness given in baptism, strictly speaking, there are only two sacraments.

With respect to the eucharist or communion, the ELCT holds to the Lutheran doctrine of the sacramental union, that is, that Christ&#x27;s body and blood is truly present &quot;in, with and under&quot; the bread and wine. All communicants orally receive not only bread and wine, but also the same body and blood of Christ that was given for them on the cross. Members of other denominations sometimes refer to this as a belief in consubstantiation. Lutherans, however, reject the philosophical explanation of consubstantiation, preferring to consider the presence of the Lord&#x27;s body and blood as mysterious rather than explainable by human philosophy. The Lutheran belief in the holy mystery character of the consecrated bread and wine is more similar to that of Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox belief than to the views of most Protestants. In contrast, most Protestant church bodies doubt or openly deny that the actual body and blood of Christ is eaten in the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

== Relations with other churches ==
The ELCT decided to establish a relationship with the North American Lutheran Church, and both churches approved a &quot;Memorandum of Understanding&quot; at a convocation held in August 2013, paving the way for full communion between the two churches.

<doc id="1018774" wikidata="Q318934" url="?curid=1018774" title="Joseph M. Acaba">
<text>Joseph Michael Acabá (born May 17, 1967) is an American educator, hydrogeologist, and NASA astronaut. In May 2004, he became the first person of Puerto Rican ancestry to be named as a NASA astronaut candidate, when he was selected as a member of NASA Astronaut Training Group 19. He completed his training on February 10, 2006, and was assigned to STS-119, which flew from March 15 to 28, 2009, to deliver the final set of solar arrays to the International Space Station. He is the first person of Puerto Rican origin, and the twelfth of fifteen people of Ibero-american heritage to have flown to space.

Acabá served as a flight engineer aboard the International Space Station, having launched on May 15, 2012. He arrived at the space station on May 17 and returned to Earth on September 17, 2012. Acaba returned to the International Space Station in 2017 as a member of Expedition 53/54. In 2023, Acaba was appointed the Chief of the Astronaut Office.

==Early life and education==
Acaba&#x27;s parents, Ralph and Elsie Acabá, from Hatillo, Puerto Rico, moved in the mid-1960s to Inglewood, California, where he was born. They later moved to Anaheim, California. Since his childhood, Acaba enjoyed reading, especially science fiction. In school, he excelled in both science and math. As a child, his parents constantly exposed him to educational films, but it was the 8-mm film showing astronaut Neil Armstrong&#x27;s Moon landing that intrigued him about outer space. During his senior year in high school, Acaba became interested in scuba diving and became a certified scuba diver through a job training program at his school. This experience inspired him to further his academic education in geology. In 1985, he graduated with honors from Esperanza High School in Anaheim.

In 1990, Acaba received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in geology from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and in 1992, he earned his master&#x27;s degree in geology from the University of Arizona. Acaba was a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps Reserve where he served for six years. He also worked as a hydrogeologist in Los Angeles, California. Acaba spent two years in the United States Peace Corps and trained over 300 teachers in the Dominican Republic in modern teaching methodologies. He then served as island manager of the Caribbean Marine Research at Lee Stocking Island in the Exumas, Bahamas.

Upon his return to the United States, Acaba moved to Florida, where he became shoreline revegetation coordinator in Vero Beach. He taught one year of science and math in high school and four years at Dunnellon Middle School. He also briefly taught at Melbourne High School in Melbourne, Florida. Upon his return to Florida in fall 2012, Acaba began coursework in the College of Education at Texas Tech University. He earned his Master of Education, curriculum and instruction from Texas Tech University in 2015.

==NASA career==

On May 6, 2004, Acaba and ten other people were selected from 99 applicants by NASA as astronaut candidates. NASA&#x27;s administrator, Sean O&#x27;Keefe, in the presence of John Glenn, announced the members of the &quot;19th group of Astronaut Candidates&quot;, an event which has not been repeated since 1958 when the original group of astronauts was presented to the world. Acaba, who was selected as an Educator Mission Specialist, completed his astronaut training on February 10, 2006, along with the other ten astronaut candidates. Upon completion of his training, Acaba was assigned to the Hardware Integration Team in the International Space Station branch, working technical issues with European Space Agency (ESA) hardware.

===STS-119===
Acaba was assigned to the crew of STS-119 as mission specialist educator, which was launched on March 15, 2009, at 7:43 p.m., after NASA engineers repaired a leaky gas venting system the previous week, to deliver the final set of solar arrays to the International Space Station. Acaba, who carried on his person a Puerto Rican flag, requested that the crew be awakened on March 19 (Day 5) with the Puerto Rico folklore song &quot;Qué Bonita Bandera&quot; (What a Beautiful Flag) referring to the Puerto Rican flag, written in 1971 by Florencio Morales Ramos (Ramito) and sung by Jose Gonzalez and Banda Criolla.

On March 20, he provided support to the first mission spacewalk. On March 21, he performed a spacewalk with Steve Swanson in which he helped to successfully unfurl the final &quot;wings&quot; of the solar array that will augment power to the ISS. 2 days later, Acaba performed his second EVA of the mission, with crew member Ricky Arnold. The main task of the EVA was to help move the CETA carts outside of the station to a different location. On March 28 the and its seven-person crew safely touched down on runway 15 at NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 3:14 p.m. EDT. Acaba said he was amazed at the views from the space station.
===Expedition 31/32===
On May 15, 2012, Acaba was one of three crew members launching from Kazakhstan aboard the Soyuz TMA-04M spacecraft to the International Space Station. He and his fellow crew members, Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin, arrived and docked with the space station two days after launch, on May 17 at 4:36 UTC. Acaba, Padalka, and Revin returned to Earth on September 17, 2012, after nearly 125 days in space.

===Between space missions===
Acaba served as the Branch Chief of the International Space Station Operations branch. The office is responsible for mission preparation and on-orbit support of space station crews.
Until being selected as a flight engineer for Expedition 54\Expedition 55 Acaba served as Director of Operations Russia in Star City supporting crew training in Soyuz and Russian Segment systems.

In September 2019 Acaba served as cavenaut in ESA CAVES training (between Italy and Slovenia) spending six nights underground simulating a mission exploring another planet.

===Expedition 53/54===
In 2017 it was announced that Acaba would return to the ISS for his third mission, onboard Soyuz MS-06. The Soyuz vehicle was originally slated to launch with a crew of 2, due to the Russian crew cuts on the ISS for 2017, however, at short notice, it was decided that the 3rd seat would be filled by an experienced astronaut and would be funded by Roscosmos to cancel out owed debts. Acaba&#x27;s backup for the mission was Shannon Walker, who was scheduled to fly as prime crew on Soyuz MS-12 as part of Expedition 59/60, although as of December 2018, she is not assigned to that crew

Acaba launched on Soyuz MS-06 on September 12, 2017, performing a 6-hour rendezvous with the ISS. On October 20, 2017, Acaba and Randy Bresnik performed an EVA to continue with the lubrication of the new end effector on the robotic arm and to install new cameras. The duration was 6 hours and 49 minutes. During the mission Acaba&#x27;s home in Houston was flooded by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Maria struck his native Puerto Rico.

===Chief of the Astronaut Office===
In February 2023, Acaba became Chief of the Astronaut Office at NASA. Acaba replaced Drew Feustel who was acting chief after Reid Wiseman stepped down from the position.

==Recognition==

On March 18, 2008, Acaba was honored by the Senate of Puerto Rico, which sponsored his first trip to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico since being selected for space flight. During his visit, which was announced by then President of the Puerto Rican Senate, Kenneth McClintock, he met with schoolchildren at the Capitol, as well as at the Bayamón, Puerto Rico Science Park, which includes a planetarium and several surplus NASA rockets among its exhibits.

Acaba returned to Puerto Rico on June 1, 2009. During his visit, he was presented with a proclamation by Governor Luis Fortuño. He spent seven days on the island and came into contact with over 10,000 persons, most of them schoolchildren.

He received the Ana G. Mendez University System Presidential Medal and an Honorary Doctorate from the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico, where he inaugurated a flight simulator on February 7, 2013, during one of his visits to Puerto Rico to promote the study of math and science among students, as well as to visit his relatives. Caras Magazine named him one of the most influential and exciting Puerto Ricans of 2012.

<text>The Sopwith Strutter is a British single- or two-seat multi-role biplane aircraft of the First World War. It was the first British two-seat tractor fighter and the first British aircraft to enter service with a synchronised machine gun. It was given the name Strutter because of the long and short cabane struts that supported the top wing. The type was operated by both British air services and was in widespread but lacklustre service with the French .

==Design and development==

In December 1914, the Sopwith Aviation Company designed a small, two-seat biplane powered by an Gnome rotary engine, which became known as the &quot;Sigrist Bus&quot; after Fred Sigrist, the Sopwith works manager. The Sigrist Bus first flew on 5 June 1915 and although it set a new British altitude record on the day of its first flight, only one was built, serving as a company runabout.

The Sigrist Bus formed the basis for a new, larger, fighter aircraft, the Sopwith LCT (Land Clerget Tractor), designed by Herbert Smith and powered by a Clerget engine. Like the Sigrist Bus, each of the upper wings (there was no true centre section) was connected to the fuselage by a pair of short (half) struts and a pair of longer struts, forming a &quot;W&quot; when viewed from the front; this giving rise to the aircraft&#x27;s popular nickname of the Strutter. The first prototype was ready in mid-December 1915, undergoing official testing in January 1916.

The Strutter was of conventional wire-braced, wood and fabric construction. The pilot and gunner sat in widely separated tandem cockpits, with the pilot in front, giving the gunner a good field of fire for his Lewis gun. The aircraft had a variable-incidence tailplane that could be adjusted by the pilot in flight and airbrakes under the lower wings to reduce landing distance.
The Vickers-Challenger synchronisation gear was put into production for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in December 1915 and in a few weeks, a similar order for the Scarff-Dibovski gear was placed for the RNAS. Early production Strutters were fitted with one or the other of these gears for the fixed .303-in Vickers machine gun; due to a shortage of the new gears some early aircraft were built with only the observer&#x27;s gun. Later aircraft were either fitted with the Ross or the Sopwith-Kauper gears. No early mechanical synchronisation gear was reliable and it was not uncommon for propellers to be damaged or shot away.

The Scarff ring mounting was also new and production was at first slower than that of the aircraft requiring them. Various makeshift Lewis mountings as well as the older Nieuport ring mounting, were fitted to some early Strutters as a stopgap. The two-seaters could carry four bombs underwing, which could be replaced by two bombs for anti-submarine patrols. From the beginning, a light bomber version was planned, with the observer&#x27;s cockpit eliminated to allow more fuel and bombs to be carried in the manner of the Martinsyde Elephant and the B.E.12, with an internal bomb bay capable of carrying four bombs.

==Operational history==

===In British service===
The prototype two seater flew in December 1915 and production deliveries started to reach the RNAS in February 1916. By the end of April, No. 5 Wing RNAS had a flight equipped with the new aircraft. The Sopwiths were used to escort the wing&#x27;s Caudron G.4 and Breguet Bre.4 bombers and for bombing. The War Office had ordered the type for the RFC in March but because Sopwith&#x27;s production capacity was contracted to the navy, the RFC orders had to be placed with Ruston Proctor and Vickers. Sub-contract production from these manufacturers did not get into its stride until August. Since the Battle of the Somme was planned for the end of June and with the RFC having a shortage of modern aircraft, it was agreed that a number of Sopwiths would be transferred from one service to the other, allowing 70 Squadron to reach the front by early July 1916 with Sopwith-built Strutters, originally intended for the Navy.
At first, 70 Squadron did very well with their new aircraft. The period of German ascendency known as the Fokker scourge was over and the Strutter&#x27;s long range and excellent armament enabled offensive patrolling deep into German-held territory. By the time 45 Squadron reached the front in October, the new Albatros fighters were arriving at the . By January 1917, when 43 Squadron arrived in France, the Strutter was outclassed as a fighter; a more powerful Clerget 9B improved performance slightly but too late to reverse the situation. It was still a useful long-range reconnaissance aircraft when it could be provided with adequate fighter escort but was one of the types to suffer severely during &quot;Bloody April&quot;, 43 squadron alone suffering 35 casualties, from an officer establishment of 32.

Like other early Sopwith types, the Strutter was very lightly built and its structure did not stand up very well to arduous war service. It was far too stable to make a good dogfighter and the distance between the pilot and the observer&#x27;s cockpits impeded their communication. The last operational Strutters in the RFC were replaced by Sopwith Camels in late October 1917.

The type&#x27;s long range and stability were good qualities for a home defence fighter and it served with 37, 44 and 78 squadrons. Most of the Strutters supplied to home defence units had been built as two-seaters but many were converted locally to single-seaters to improve performance. Some of these single-seaters were similar to the bomber variant but others were of a different type, known (like similarly adapted Sopwith Camels) as the Sopwith Comic. The cockpit was moved back behind the wings and one or two Lewis guns, either mounted on Foster mountings or fixed to fire upwards, outside the arc of the propeller, replaced the synchronised Vickers.

The RNAS used most of their Strutters as bombers (in the Aegean and Macedonia as well as in France) and as shipboard aircraft, where it was known as the Ship&#x27;s Strutter and flew from aircraft carriers, other warships of the Royal Navy and . It had been planned to use them on the Tondern raid, but Sopwith Camels were used instead. The RNAS and the RFC (and after April 1918 the Royal Air Force [RAF]) used the type as a trainer after it had been withdrawn from operational service and like the Sopwith Pup, it proved a popular personal aircraft for senior officers.

===In French service===

The largest user of the Sopwith was actually the French . By May 1916 it was obvious that the pusher Farman and Breguet bombers and reconnaissance aircraft were obsolete and with the failure of their tractor aircraft replacements, particularly the Nieuport 14, the Sopwith was ordered in large numbers from French manufacturers in three versions, the SOP. 1A.2 (two-seat reconnaissance), SOP. 1B.2 (two-seat bomber) and SOP. 1B.1 (single-seat bomber). While in French service, they equipped a large portion of the French bomber and artillery-observation squadrons and carried out many bombing attacks against industrial and military targets, including the German front lines. It was not as successful against fighters, suffering substantial casualties and downing fewer enemy aircraft than either the aircraft used before it or after. With the belated introduction of the Breguet 14 A.2 and B.2, the last of the Sopwiths were withdrawn from operational service in early 1918 although they would continue in service with training units until after the end of the war.

===In other foreign service===

Three Belgian squadrons also flew French-built Sopwiths, and surplus French Sopwiths were used by several countries postwar. During the war, several Strutters that were interned after landing in the Netherlands were purchased for the Dutch . Over 100 Strutters were also built in Russia by Duks and Lebedev, supplemented by large numbers delivered directly from Britain and France. The Strutter remained in large scale use by both the Soviet forces and White Russians during the Russian Civil War and Polish-Soviet war. Three were captured during this war and used by the Poles in 1919–1920. Other captured ones were used by Baltic states.

The American Expeditionary Force purchased 384 two-seat Strutter observation aircraft and 130 single-seat bombers from France in 1917–18. While mainly used for training, they were used operationally by the 90th Aero Squadron as an interim measure, due to a shortage of later types. The U.S. Navy used a number of the two-seat Sopwiths, along with Nieuport 28s and Hanriot HD.1s and 2s as ships&#x27; aircraft in the early postwar years, testing the use of aircraft from platforms mounted on the turrets of battleships. The Strutter also served with the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force – some examples serving in the Japanese expeditionary force in Siberia during 1918. Around 1,500 Strutters were built for the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service and between 4,200 and 4,500 were built in France.

<doc id="1018783" wikidata="Q1902828" url="?curid=1018783" title="Marshallian demand function">
<text>In microeconomics, a consumer&#x27;s Marshallian demand function (named after Alfred Marshall) is the quantity they demand of a particular good as a function of its price, their income, and the prices of other goods, a more technical exposition of the standard demand function. It is a solution to the utility maximization problem of how the consumer can maximize their utility for given income and prices. A synonymous term is uncompensated demand function, because when the price rises the consumer is not compensated with higher nominal income for the fall in their real income, unlike in the Hicksian demand function. Thus the change in quantity demanded is a combination of a substitution effect and a wealth effect. Although Marshallian demand is in the context of partial equilibrium theory, it is sometimes called Walrasian demand as used in general equilibrium theory (named after Léon Walras).

According to the utility maximization problem, there are formula_1 commodities with price vector formula_2 and choosable quantity vector formula_3. The consumer has income formula_4, and hence a budget set of affordable packages

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the dot product of the price and quantity vectors. The consumer has a utility function

:formula_7

The consumer&#x27;s Marshallian demand correspondence is defined to be

:formula_8

== Revealed preference ==
Marshall&#x27;s theory suggests that pursuit of utility is a motivational factor to a consumer which can be attained through the consumption of goods or service. The amount of consumer&#x27;s utility is dependent on the level of consumption of a certain good, which is subject to the fundamental tendency of human nature and it is described as the law of diminishing marginal utility. 

As utility maximum always exists, Marshallian demand correspondence must be nonempty at every value that corresponds with the standard budget set.

== Uniqueness ==
formula_9 is called a &quot;correspondence&quot; because in general it may be set-valued - there may be several different bundles that attain the same maximum utility. In some cases, there is a &quot;unique&quot; utility-maximizing bundle for each price and income situation; then, formula_9 is a function and it is called the Marshallian demand function. 

If the consumer has strictly convex preferences and the prices of all goods are strictly positive, then there is a unique utility-maximizing bundle. To prove this, suppose, by contradiction, that there are two different bundles, formula_11 and formula_12, that maximize the utility. Then formula_11 and formula_12 are equally preferred. By definition of strict convexity, the mixed bundle formula_15 is strictly better than formula_16. But this contradicts the optimality of formula_16.

== Continuity ==
The maximum theorem implies that if:
* The utility function formula_18 is continuous with respect to formula_19,
* The correspondence formula_20 is non-empty, compact-valued, and continuous with respect to formula_21,
then formula_9 is an upper-semicontinuous correspondence. Moreover, if formula_9 is unique, then it is a continuous function of formula_24 and formula_25.

Combining with the previous subsection, if the consumer has strictly convex preferences, then the Marshallian demand is unique and continuous. In contrast, if the preferences are not convex, then the Marshallian demand may be non-unique and non-continuous.

== Homogeneity ==
The optimal Marshallian demand correspondence of a continuous utility function is a homogeneous function with degree zero. This means that for every constant formula_26
:formula_27
This is intuitively clear. Suppose formula_24 and formula_25 are measured in dollars. When formula_30, formula_31 and formula_32 are exactly the same quantities measured in cents. When prices and wealth go up by a factor a, the purchasing pattern of an economic agent remains constant. Obviously, expressing in different unit of measurement for prices and income should not affect the demand.

== Demand curve ==
Marshall&#x27;s theory exploits that demand curve represents individual&#x27;s diminishing marginal values of the good. The theory insists that the consumer&#x27;s purchasing decision is dependent on the gainable utility of a goods or services compared to the price since the additional utility that the consumer gain must be at least as great as the price. The following suggestion proposes that the price demanded is equal to the maximum price that the consumer would pay for an extra unit of good or service. Hence, the utility is held constant along the demand curve. When the marginal utility of income is constant, or its value is the same across individuals within a market demand curve, generating net benefits of purchased units, or consumer surplus is possible through adding up of demand prices.

==Examples==
In the following examples, there are two commodities, 1 and 2. 

1. The utility function has the Cobb–Douglas form:
:formula_33

The constrained optimization leads to the Marshallian demand function:
:formula_34

2. The utility function is a CES utility function:
:formula_35

Then
formula_36

In both cases, the preferences are strictly convex, the demand is unique and the demand function is continuous.

3. The utility function has the linear form:
:formula_37
The utility function is only weakly convex, and indeed the demand is not unique: when formula_38, the consumer may divide his income in arbitrary ratios between product types 1 and 2 and get the same utility.

4. The utility function exhibits a non-diminishing marginal rate of substitution:
:formula_39 
The utility function is not convex, and indeed the demand is not continuous: when formula_40, the consumer demands only product 1, and when formula_41, the consumer demands only product 2 (when formula_38 the demand correspondence contains two distinct bundles: either buy only product 1 or buy only product 2).

<doc id="1018787" wikidata="Q668341" url="?curid=1018787" title="Magdeburg Cathedral">
<text>Magdeburg Cathedral (), officially called the Cathedral of Saints Maurice and Catherine (), is a Lutheran cathedral in Germany and the oldest Gothic cathedral in the country. It is the proto-cathedral of the former Prince-Archbishopric of Magdeburg. Today it is the principal church of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany. The south steeple is 99.25 m (325 ft 7 in) tall, the north tower 100.98 m (331 ft 4 in), making it one of the tallest cathedrals in eastern Germany. The cathedral is likewise the landmark of Magdeburg, the capital city of the &quot;Bundesland&quot; of Saxony-Anhalt, and is also home to the grave of Emperor Otto I the Great and his first wife Edith.

The first church built in 937 at the location of the current cathedral was an abbey called St. Maurice, dedicated to Saint Maurice. The current cathedral was constructed over the period of 300 years starting from 1209, and the completion of the steeples took place only in 1520. Despite being repeatedly looted, Magdeburg Cathedral is rich in art, ranging from antiques to modern art.

==History==
===Previous building===
The first church was founded September 21, 937 at the location of the current cathedral and was an abbey called St. Maurice (&quot;St. Moritz&quot;), dedicated to Saint Maurice and financed by Emperor Otto I, the Great. Otto wanted to demonstrate his political power after the successful Battle of Lechfeld in 955, and ordered the construction even before his coronation as Emperor on February 2, 962. Furthermore, to support his claim as successor of the Emperor of the &quot;Weströmisches Reich&quot;, he obtained a large number of antiques – for example, pillars to be used for the construction of the church. Many of those antiques were subsequently used for the second church in 1209. The church had most likely one nave with four aisles, a width of 41 meters and a length of 80 meters. The height is estimated as up to 60 meters.

The wife of Otto, Queen Eadgyth (&quot;grand-daughter of Alfred the Great&quot;), was buried in the church after her death in 946; isotopic analysis of her bones confirms her early life in Wessex. The church was expanded in 955. Hence, the church became a cathedral. In 968, Emperor Otto I selected Magdeburg as the seat of an archdiocese with Adalbert von Trier as archbishop, even though the city was not centrally located but at the eastern border of his kingdom. He did this because he planned to expand his kingdom, and also Christianity, to the east into what is nowadays Poland. This plan, however, failed. Emperor Otto I died soon thereafter in 973 in Memleben and was also buried in the cathedral next to his wife.

The entire cathedral St. Maurice was destroyed on Good Friday in 1207 by a city fire. All but the southern wing of the cloister burned down. Archbishop Albrecht II von Kefernburg decided to pull down the remaining walls and construct a completely new cathedral, against some opposition of the people in Magdeburg. Only the south wall of the cloister is still standing. The exact location of the old church remained unknown for a long time, but the foundations were rediscovered in May 2003, revealing a building 80 m long and 41 m wide. The old crypt has been excavated and can be visited by the public.

The place in the north of the cathedral (sometimes called &quot;new marketplace&quot;, &quot;Neuer Markt&quot;, now: Cathedral square = in German language: &quot;Domplatz&quot;) was occupied by an imperial palace (&quot;Kaiserpfalz&quot;), which was destroyed in the fire of Good Friday 1207. In the southeast corner of the Domplatz stood a second large church, the &quot;North Church&quot;, which burned down 1207 and was not rebuilt after the fire. The stones of the ruin served for building the cathedral. The presumptive remains of the palace were excavated in the 1960s.

===Construction of the current building===

The highly educated Prince-Archbishop Albert I of Käfernburg, having traveled in Italy and France, decided to construct the new cathedral modelled upon the Gothic architecture that had intrigued him in France. The French style was completely unknown in Germany, and the hired craftsmen only gradually mastered it.

The construction of the choir started in 1209, only two years after the fire that destroyed the previous church, but this choir is still in a very Romanesque style, initially still using Romanesque groin vaults, combined with a gothic center stone, which however is not needed for Romanesque groin vaults.

The Gothic influence increased especially between 1235 and 1260 under Archbishop Wilbrand. As the construction was supervised by different people in the span of 300 years, many changes were made to the original plan, and the cathedral size expanded greatly. The people of Magdeburg were not always happy with this, since they had to pay for the construction. In some cases already constructed walls and pillars were torn down to suit the wishes of the current supervisor.

Construction stopped after 1274. In 1325, Archbishop Burchard III. von Schraplau was killed by the people of Magdeburg because of extreme taxes. Folklore says that especially the beer tax increase caused much anger. Afterwards Magdeburg was under a ban, and only after the donation of five atonement altars did the construction of the cathedral continue under Archbishop Otto von Hessen. Otto was also able to complete the interior construction, and formally opened the dome in 1363 in a week-long festival. At this time, the cathedral was dedicated not only to St Maurice as before, but also to Saint Catherine.

In 1360, the construction stopped again after the uncompleted parts have been covered provisionally. Only in 1477 did the construction start again under Archbishop Ernst von Sachsen, including the two towers. The towers were constructed by master builder Bastian Binder, the only master builder of the cathedral known by name. The construction of the cathedral was completed in 1520 with the placement of the ornamental cross on the north tower.

===Luther, the Swedes, and Napoleon===
On October 31, 1517 Martin Luther published the 95 Theses in Wittenberg, Germany, an event considered to mark the start of the Protestant Reformation. Luther preached in Magdeburg in 1524, and some smaller churches in the city to adopt Protestantism soon thereafter. The unpopularity of Archbishop Albrecht von Brandenburg also furthered the Reformation, and after his death in 1545 in Mainz there was no successor. Magdeburg became a leading site of the Reformation, and was outlawed by the emperor. The Catholic Church stored the cathedral treasure in Aschaffenburg for safekeeping, but it would later be lost to the Swedes in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The priests of the cathedral also converted to Protestantism, and on the first Advent Sunday in 1567, the first Protestant worship service was held in the cathedral.

The largest bell, the &quot;Maxima&quot; with 10 tons in the south tower, fell down and was destroyed in 1540.

Heinrich Compenius built 1604/05 his famous main organ with the &quot;Golden Chick&quot;.

In 1631, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) Magdeburg was raided, and only a small group of 4000 citizens survived the murdering, raping, and looting (known as the sack of Magdeburg) by seeking refuge in the cathedral. The head priest, Reinhard Bakes, begged on his knees for the lives of his people before the conqueror Johan t&#x27;Serclaes, Count of Tilly. The cathedral survived the fires in the city, and was dedicated again to the Catholic religion. However, as Tilly&#x27;s catholic forces left Magdeburg, the cathedral was completely looted, and its colorful windows were shot out. Twenty thousand people of Magdeburg died during the war, and at the end of the war Magdeburg had a population of only 400. Magdeburg became part of Brandenburg, and was transformed into a large fortress.
In 1806, Magdeburg was given to Napoleon, and the cathedral was used for storage, and also as a horse barn and sheep pen. The occupation ended in 1814, and the cathedral changed in the ownership of the Prussian state. Between 1826 and 1834 Frederick William III of Prussia financed the much-needed repairs and reconstruction of the cathedral under the leadership from Karl Friedrich Schinkel. A new main organ IV/81 with mechanical key and stop action was built 1856 to 1861 by Adolf Reubke, 1865 a new division with 6 stops was added. The cathedral organist from 1847 to 1885 was August Gottfried Ritter. He designed the stoplist for the Reubke-Organ. The glass windows were all replaced in 1900.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In 1901 a steam heating was installed. It needed one railway car with coal to made a temperature from 57,2 °F = 14 °C in winter. Ernst Röver build a new main organ with pneumatic key and stop action, 3 manuals and 100 stops in 1906.

The frequent Allied bombings of World War II completely destroyed the windows of the cathedral. During the heaviest bomb attacks on January 16, 1945, some vaults were destroyed. In February or March 1945 one firebomb from a deep flying attack hit the cathedral on the west facade between the towers, destroying the facade and the Röver-organ. Fortunately, the fire brigades were able to extinguish the flames on the roof structures in time, so damage to the cathedral was only moderate. Also the steam heating was destroyed in WW II and to now not rebuilt. The cathedral was opened again in 1955, and a new organ with mechanical action and 37 stops from Alexander Schuke Orgelbau was installed over the &quot;Paradies door&quot; in 1969.

With the end of World War II and the establishment of the communist-led German Democratic Republic in 1949, Magdeburg fell under Soviet control and the ownership of the cathedral to the GDR. Communist leaders tried to suppress religion as a potential threat to communist doctrine, thus being active in church was a social disadvantage. The eradication of religion could not be accomplished, however, and weekly peace prayers were held in the cathedral beginning in 1983 in front of the Magdeburger Ehrenmal, a sculpture by Ernst Barlach. This led to the famous Monday demonstrations of 1989 (similar to those in Leipzig), which played a significant role in the German reunification process.

The cathedral is currently undergoing a reconstruction phase that began in 1983 under the East German Government. In 1990, a number of solar cells were installed on the roof, marking the first solar cell installation on a church in East Germany. The solar cells provide energy for use in the church, with excess energy being added to the regional power network. The maximum output was 418 watts. In 2004, a funding drive started in 1997 for a new main organ was completed, collecting €2.2 million. The new main organ was built by the firm of Alexander Schuke Orgelbau (Werder an der Havel) near Potsdam and was completed in May 2008 and dedicated on Trinity Sunday, May 18, 2008. Specs: ~36 tonnes, 4 manuals, 93 stops and 6193 pipes.

Barry Jordan of Port Elizabeth, South Africa was appointed as Organist and Choral director of the cathedral in August 1994.

The Magdeburger Ehrenmal (Monument) in the cathedral is once again the starting point of many Monday demonstrations, but this time the demonstrations are aimed against social reforms reducing government welfare. However, these demonstrations occur on a much smaller scale, so comparisons to the Monday demonstrations of 1989 are made mainly for publicity reasons.

In the next time the little Schuke-organ will be restored: New case and new facade pipes, new trumpets in the Great und the Pedal, and a new Vox Humana.

==== Bells ====
Many of the approximately 10 to 15 historic bells were used in the 16th and 17th centuries for the production of weapons. Today there are four historic ringing bells left in the cathedral:

1) the Susanne = Osanna, 8800 kg, tone e0, manufactured in 1702 by Johann Jacobi in Berlin,

2) the Apostolica, 4980 kg, tone b0, manufactured in 1690 by Jakob Wenzel in Magdeburg, it rings and also hits the full hours

3) the Dominica, 2362 kg, tone h0, manufactured in 1575 by Eckart Kucher in Magdeburg,

4) the Orate, 200 kg, tone e², manufacturing date and manufacturer unknown (13th century?)

The Schelle, 1500 kg, tone f1, manufactured in 1396, is only for the clock and hits the quarters of an hour.

The two largest bells and the Schelle are in the North tower, the Orate since 1994 in the spire. The &quot;Dominica&quot; was out of order since ≈2004, but it has been repaired in summer 2019, and now is awaiting installation together with the new &quot;Amemus&quot; in the North tower in the following years.

In the next years eight new bells from 440 kg to 14000 kg will be installed in both towers. The first new bells, the &quot;Amemus&quot; with 6525 kg (tone g0) for the North tower and the &quot;Benedicamus&quot; with 1300 kg (tone e1) for the South tower were manufactured in September and October 2022 by the Bell-manufacturer Bachert in Neunkirchen. The next five little bells for the south tower with the tones d1, f sharp1, g1, a1 and h1, made by Bachert, followed in 2023. The &quot;Credamus&quot; with 14 metric tons and the tone d0 will be installed at the former place of the &quot;Maxima&quot; (destroyed in 1540) in the South tower and will be the second heaviest ringing bell in Germany (after the Petersglocke in Cologne cathedral).

==Architecture==
The current cathedral was constructed over a period of 300 years starting from 1209, and the completion of the steeples took place only in 1520. As there were no previous examples of gothic architecture in Germany, and German craftsmen were still very unfamiliar with the style at the start of the construction. Hence they learned by doing, and their progress can be seen in small architectural changes over the construction periods, which started with the Sanctuary in the east side of the church near the river Elbe and ended with the top of the towers. This sanctuary shows a strong Romanesque architecture influence. Unlike most other Gothic cathedrals, Magdeburg Cathedral does not have flying buttresses supporting the walls.

The building has an inside length of 120 metres, and a height to the ceiling of 32 metres. The towers rise to 99.25 and 100.98 metres, and are among the highest church towers in eastern Germany. The layout of the cathedral consists of one nave and two aisles, with one transept crossing the nave and aisles. Each side of the transept has an entrance, the south entrance leading into the cloister. The ceiling in the nave is higher than in the aisles, allowing for clerestory windows to give light to the nave. There is a separate narthex (entrance area) in the west. The presbytery in the east is separated from the nave by a stone wall, serving the same function as a rood screen. The sanctuary and the apse follow the presbytery. The apse is also surrounded by an ambulatory. &quot;(See Cathedral diagram for details on cathedral layouts.)&quot;

A secondary building around a large non-rectangular cloister is connected to the south side of the cathedral. The cloister, whose south wall survived the fire of 1207 and is still from the original church, was parallel to the original church. Yet, the current church was constructed at a different angle, and hence the cloister is at an odd angle with the church.

=== The &quot;Cathedral Rock&quot; and the foundation ===

The ground around the Elbe river in Magdeburg is soft, and it is difficult to construct tall buildings, except for one large rock. Hence the cathedral was constructed on top of this rock, called the &quot;Domfelsen&quot; in German, which means &quot;Cathedral Rock&quot;. At low water levels, this rock is visible in the Elbe. As in old times low water meant a small harvest, this rock is also called &quot;Hungerfelsen&quot;, meaning &quot;starvation rock&quot;.

The traditional and popular story, in any case, the rock was not big enough for the complete cathedral, and on the west end only the north tower could be placed on a solid rock foundation, whereas the south tower stands on soft ground. is not correct. It is also false, that to reduce weight the south tower is therefore only an empty shell with no interior or stairs, and the three big bells, &quot;Susanne&quot; (e), &quot;Apostolica&quot; (b) and &quot;Dominica&quot; (b), are in the north tower with a solid rock foundation. The heaviest historic bell, the &quot;Maxima&quot; (weight = approximately 10 metric tons), was manufactured in 1468 and ringed in the south tower, but it falled down in the forties of the 16th century and was destroyed.

The &quot;Cathedral Rock&quot; is a rock formation between the Elbe in east and the &quot;Magdeburg Kulturhistorisches Museum&quot; in West. Some scientific drillings around and under the cathedral since 1935 showed, in the area under the cathedral the upper side of the rock is more than 10 metres under the cathedral floor. Scientists drilled after 1993 in the near of the &quot;Paradise door&quot; and detected the rock in an deep of 11,05 metres. The cathedral has neverwhere a direct contact with the rock. Various sands and sediments are between the cathedral-fundaments and the rock.

However, the south tower is slightly higher than the north tower, which is optically corrected by adding an ornamental cross on the north tower.

==Art==
Despite having lost much to plunderers, Magdeburg Cathedral is rich in art, ranging from antiquities to modern art. Highlights include:

*Marble porphyry and granite columns removed from buildings in Ravenna for use in the apse of the Ottonian basilica;
*The late-antique, porphyry baptismal font.
*The tomb of Otto I, the first Ottonian Holy Roman Emperor (962 - 973). When the tomb was opened in 1844, a skeleton and remains of clothes were found, but no grave goods, which were presumably stolen during the Thirty-Years War. The Latin inscription on the bronze plaque is modern.
*The (incomplete) sculpture of Saint Maurice, created around 1250, is the first realistic depiction of an ethnic African in central European art. It shows the same high degree of naturalism as the founder&#x27;s effigies of Naumburg Cathedral. The same sculptor carved the image of Saint Catherine.
*The sculpture known as The Royal Couple (&quot;Herrscherpaar&quot;), located in the sixteen-sided chapel, also dates from ) may represent Otto I and his consort, Edith.
*The sculptures of the five wise and the five foolish virgins (see The ten virgins from the List of Bible stories), also around 1250. This is the most remarkable piece of art in the cathedral. The five wise virgins are prepared and bring oil to a wedding, whereas the five foolish virgins are unprepared and bring no oil. Hence they have to go find oil and subsequently arrive late and cannot join the wedding anymore. The unknown artist masterfully expresses the emotions in the faces and the body languages of the girls, showing a much more realistic expression than what was common in art around that time. All figures are different, and have ethnic Slavic features. The sculptures are outside of the north entrance to the transept.
*The seats in the choir from 1363 are masterfully carved and show the life of Jesus. The unknown master also created the seats in the choir in Bremen&#x27;s Cathedral.
* by Ernst Barlach was ordered as a heroic war memorial, but due to his voluntary participation during World War I Barlach was against the war and showed the pain and suffering of the war instead. This created a great controversy, and the work was almost destroyed. The spot in front of this sculpture was also the starting point of the Monday demonstrations.
*The &quot;Lebensbaumkruzifix&quot; (literally: &quot;Tree of life cross&quot;) is a painted bronze sculpture from 1986 and expanded in 1988 that shows Jesus nailed to a tree instead of a cross. Jesus is attached to the tree only with his hands and feet, and is otherwise hanging freely. The sculpture was designed not only to be viewed from the front but from all sides. The tree is barren except for a small leaf of hope/life where the blood of Jesus drips on the tree. The artist, Prof. &quot;Jürgen Weber&quot;, wanted the sculpture to be the centerpiece near the altar, but the sculpture was placed on the south side of the transept against his wishes.
*The Magdeburg Ivories, 17 carved panels thought to be created for an unidentified object in Magdeburg Cathedral around the time of its dedication and now dispersed in museums across the world, a prime example of Ottonian art. 

=== Saint Maurice ===
It was not until the Middle Ages that the portrayal of blackness arose in art, evident in the sculpture of Saint Maurice in Magdeburg Cathedral. However, during this time, much of the portrayal of blackness in art was to emphasize social and racial hierarchy, so, by portraying blackness in sculpture, it was easier for viewers to understand that the use of different skin colors was to demonstrate &quot;the other.&quot; The attention to black facial structure to portray foreignness can be traced back to Hohenstaufen iconography and the Crusades, as there was a rising interest in black social standing during the period. This led to the emergence of black portrayals in art, particularly under Frederick II, who had black Muslims brought to Lucera, Apulia, to become his personal servants. Thus they became a large part of the art he commissioned. During Fredericks&#x27;s reign, due to his interest in the Hohenstaufen tradition, black people were depicted as servants, specifically intelligent guardians of the royal treasury, or in high court positions. Yet, rather than defining them through race, there was greater attention to detail in facial structure, which was used to indicate their foreignness. Looking at Saint Maurice, it is clear that he embodies the traits of the time, and the shift towards naturalism in sculpture during the Gothic period, as there is a focus on the portrayal of his distinctly black features. The statue of Saint Maurice changed the idea of black Africans in art from a violent and savage-like stereotype to that of a saint and martyr. The portrayal of Saint Maurice in a position of power is evident through his clothing, as he is dressed as a mighty knight, making it clear that he is not a servant. This sculpture not only represents blackness, but the importance of African ancestry as well, as this sculpture was one of the earliest representations of a black African in European art history. This statue thus became a model in the representation of blackness in medieval European sculpture.

<doc id="1018814" wikidata="Q1045105" url="?curid=1018814" title="Meta (prefix)">
<text>Meta (from the , &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;after&#x27; or &#x27;beyond&#x27;) is an adjective meaning &#x27;more comprehensive&#x27; or &#x27;transcending&#x27;.

In modern nomenclature, the prefix 
meta can also serve as a prefix meaning self-referential, as a field of study or endeavor (metatheory: theory about a theory; metamathematics: mathematical theories about mathematics; meta-axiomatics or meta-axiomaticity: axioms about axiomatic systems; metahumor: joking about the ways humor is expressed; etc.).

==Original Greek meaning==

In Greek, the prefix &quot;meta-&quot; is generally less esoteric than in English; Greek &quot;meta-&quot; is equivalent to the Latin words &quot;post-&quot; or &quot;ad-&quot;. The use of the prefix in this sense occurs occasionally in scientific English terms derived from Greek. For example, the term &quot;Metatheria&quot; (the name for the clade of marsupial mammals) uses the prefix &quot;meta-&quot; in the sense that the &quot;Metatheria&quot; occur on the tree of life adjacent to the &quot;Theria&quot; (the placental mammals).

==Epistemology==

In epistemology, and often in common use, the prefix &quot;meta-&quot; is used to mean &#x27;about (its own category)&#x27;. For example, metadata is data about data (who has produced them, when, what format the data are in and so on). In a database, metadata is also data about data stored in a data dictionary, describing information (data) about database tables such as the table name, table owner, details about columns, etc. – essentially describing the table. In psychology, metamemory refers to an individual&#x27;s knowledge about whether or not they would remember something if they concentrated on recalling it. The modern sense of &quot;an X about X&quot; has given rise to concepts like &quot;meta-cognition&quot; (cognition about cognition), &quot;meta-emotion&quot; (emotion about emotion), &quot;meta-discussion&quot; (discussion about discussion), &quot;meta-joke&quot; (joke about jokes), and &quot;metaprogramming&quot; (writing programs about writing programs). In a rule-based system, a is a rule governing the application of other rules.

&quot;Metagaming&quot;, accordingly, refers to games about games. However, it has a different meaning depending on the context. In role-playing games, this means that someone with a higher level of knowledge is playing; that is, that the player incorporates factors that are outside the actual framework of the game – the player has knowledge that was not acquired through experiencing the game, but through external sources. This type of metagaming is often frowned upon in many role-playing game communities because it impairs game balance and equality of opportunity. Metagaming can also refer to a game that is used to create or change the rules while playing a game. One can play this type of metagame and choose which rules apply during the game itself, potentially changing the level of difficulty. Such metagames include campaign role-playing games like &quot;Halo 3&quot;. Complex card or board games, e.g. poker or chess, are also often referred to as metagames. According to Nigel Howard, this type of metagame is defined as a decision-making process that is derived from the analysis of possible outcomes in relation to external variables that change a problem.

==Abstraction and self-reference==
Any subject can be said to have a &quot;metatheory&quot;, a theoretical consideration of its properties – such as its s, s, , and utility – on a higher level of abstraction. In linguistics, grammar is considered to be a metalanguage: a language operating on a higher level to describe properties of the plain language, and not itself.

==Etymology==
The prefix comes from the Greek preposition and prefix &quot;meta-&quot; (μετα-), from μετά, which typically means &quot;after&quot;, &quot;beside&quot;, &quot;with&quot; or &quot;among&quot;. Other meanings include &quot;beyond&quot;, &quot;adjacent&quot; and &quot;self&quot;, and it is also used in the forms μετ- before vowels and μεθ- &quot;meth-&quot; before aspirated vowels.

The earliest form of the word &quot;meta&quot; is the Mycenaean Greek &quot;me-ta&quot;, written in Linear B syllabic script. The Greek preposition is cognate with the Old English preposition &quot;with&quot;, still found as a prefix in &quot;midwife&quot;. Its use in English is the result of back-formation from the word &quot;metaphysics&quot;. In origin &quot;Metaphysics&quot; was just the title of one of the principal works of Aristotle; it was so named (by Andronicus of Rhodes) because in the customary ordering of the works of Aristotle it was the book following &quot;Physics&quot;; it thus meant nothing more than &quot;[the book that comes] after [the book entitled] &quot;Physics&quot;&quot;. However, even Latin writers misinterpreted this as entailing metaphysics constituted &quot;the science of what is beyond the physical&quot;. Nonetheless, Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot; enunciates considerations of a nature above physical reality, which one can examine through certain philosophy – for example, such a thing as an unmoved mover. The use of the prefix was later extended to other contexts, based on the understanding of metaphysics as meaning &quot;the science of what is beyond the physical&quot;.

==Early use in English==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites uses of the &quot;meta-&quot; prefix as &quot;beyond, about&quot; (such as meta-economics and meta-philosophy) going back to 1917. However, these formations are parallel to the original &quot;metaphysics&quot; and &quot;metaphysical&quot;, that is, as a prefix to general nouns (fields of study) or adjectives. Going by the &quot;OED&quot; citations, it began being used with specific nouns in connection with mathematical logic sometime before 1929. (In 1920 David Hilbert proposed a research project in what was called &quot;metamathematics.&quot;)

A notable early citation is W. V. O. Quine&#x27;s 1937 use of the word &quot;metatheorem&quot;, where meta- has the modern meaning of &quot;an X about X&quot;. 

Douglas Hofstadter, in his 1979 book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot; (and in the 1985 sequel, &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot;), popularized this meaning of the term. The book, which deals with self-reference and strange loops, and touches on Quine and his work, was influential in many computer-related subcultures and may be responsible for the popularity of the prefix, for its use as a solo term, and for the many recent coinages which use it. Hofstadter uses meta as a stand-alone word, as an adjective, and as a directional preposition (&quot;going meta,&quot; a term he coins for the old rhetorical trick of taking a debate or analysis to another level of abstraction, as when somebody says &quot;This debate isn&#x27;t going anywhere&quot;). This book may also be responsible for the association of &quot;meta&quot; with strange loops, as opposed to just abstraction. According to Hofstadter, it is about self-reference, which means a sentence, idea or formula refers to itself. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary describes it as &quot;showing or suggesting an explicit awareness of itself or oneself as a member of its category: cleverly self-referential&quot;. The sentence &quot;This sentence contains thirty-six letters,&quot; and the sentence which embeds it, are examples of &quot;metasentences&quot; referencing themselves in this way. As maintained in the book Gödel, Escher, Bach, a strange loop is given if different logical statements or theories are put together in contradiction, thus distorting the meaning and generating logical paradoxes. One example is the liar paradox, a paradox in philosophy or logic that arises when a sentence claims its own falsehood (or untruth); for instance: &quot;This sentence is not true.&quot; Until the beginning of the 20th century, this kind of paradox was a considerable problem for a philosophical theory of truth. Alfred Tarski solved this difficulty by proving that such paradoxes do not exist with a consistent separation of object language and metalanguage. &quot;For every formalized language, a formally correct and factually applicable definition of the true statement can be constructed in the metalanguage with the sole help of expressions of a general-logical character, expressions of the language itself and of terms from the morphology of the language, but on the condition that the metalanguage is of a higher order than the language that is the subject of the investigation.&quot;

== &quot;Meta&quot; in gaming ==

&quot;Metagaming&quot; is a general term describing an approach to playing a game as optimally as possible within its current rules. The shorthand &quot;meta&quot; has been backronymed as &quot;Most Effective Tactics Available&quot; to tersely explain the concept.

<doc id="1018819" wikidata="Q545678" url="?curid=1018819" title="George Odlum">
<text>George William Odlum (24 June 1934 – 28 September 2003) was a Saint Lucian left-wing politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Born in Castries, Odlum studied at Bristol University and Oxford University in the United Kingdom before returning to Saint Lucia as Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Trade. After working for the Commonwealth Secretariat and the West Indies Associated States, he formed the Saint Lucia Forum, a left-wing pressure group. This group merged with the Saint Lucia Labour Party in time for the 1974 elections; although the Party did not win, the progress they made allowed them to take power in 1979, with Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister.

Although a secret agreement originally stated that Odlum would take power after six months, his support for Cuba and similar left-wing nations led to American pressure to keep him out. After months of negotiations, Odlum was dismissed as Deputy Prime Minister, and the ensuing government weakness and infighting led to its defeat in the 1982 election. In opposition, Odlum was made Ambassador to the United Nations, resigning in 1996. When the Labour Party came to power again a year later, he became Foreign Minister, overseeing the establishment of stronger relations with both Cuba and China. Amidst controversy over his alleged alliance with the opposition, Odlum resigned in 2001. Never again returning to power, he died on 28 September 2003 following a battle with pancreatic cancer.

Odlum&#x27;s legacy is controversial: while noted as a skilled orator who cared deeply for Saint Lucia&#x27;s working class, his idealism, support for controversial figures such as Muammar Gaddafi and departure from two Labour administrations were noted as factors which harmed him and others around him. Despite this, his funeral saw widespread grieving, with Ralph Gonsalves, the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, describing him simply as a &quot;giant of a man&quot;.

==Early life==
Odlum was born on 24 June 1934 in Castries, the son of a barber. He studied economics at Bristol University, becoming the first Afro-Caribbean head of the University of Bristol Union before moving to Magdalen College, Oxford in 1959, where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics and was one of the few Afro-Caribbean students to attend. At university, Odlum acted, played both football and cricket, and became noted as a successful debater. After graduating from Oxford he returned to St Lucia in 1961, becoming a Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Trade. He moved back to the United Kingdom in 1964 to work as an economist in the Commonwealth Secretariat, leaving 3 years later. Returning to St Lucia again, he became Executive Secretary to the Council of Ministers of the West Indies Associated States.

==Career==
During the early 1960s, St Lucia and the other West Indies Associated States were British colonies, with a limited degree of self-rule. In St Lucia, the Saint Lucia Labour Party was considered the traditional party for &quot;political and constitutional advance&quot; but, despite this, it lost the general election in 1964 to the United Workers Party, a right-wing party led by John Compton that continued to rule until 1979. In response Odlum, a socialist, founded the Saint Lucia Forum, a pressure group that discussed &quot;the socialist and black cultural ideas which were beginning to challenge the Caribbean status quo&quot;. This was part of a group of Forums established in 1970 following secret talks with other left-wing Caribbean intellectuals, including Maurice Bishop. In 1972 Odlum left his job with the Council of Ministers to form the St Lucia Action Movement, which later merged with a weakened Labour Party in time for the 1974 general election.

Odlum&#x27;s faction of the Labour Party did most of the work in the election, building their power base among the banana-producing small farmers, with Odlum leading frequent strikes in an attempt to improve working conditions. His work in the 1974 election, along with his &quot;good looks and charisma&quot;, yielded a safe seat in Castries, which he allowed his brother to run for. Odlum instead chose to campaign for a rural seat held by the United Workers Party, which he lost by a small margin. Despite the Labour Party still being in opposition in Saint Lucia, socialism and left-wing politics were on the rise in the Caribbean as a whole and, during his time out of Parliament, Odlum was the public face of socialism in the region.

Saint Lucia gained full independence in 1979. Immediately beforehand, Odlum organised large protests in front of international news cameras, further cementing his role in the region&#x27;s communist and socialist movement. Three weeks after independence, the nearby country of Grenada saw the overthrow of its government by communists revolutionaries led by Maurice Bishop. When the United Workers Party called a general election in Saint Lucia three weeks later, Compton&#x27;s government fell – Odlum was returned to Parliament and the Labour Party, led by Allan Louisy, came to power.

===Deputy Prime Minister===
Odlum&#x27;s prominent role within the party led to his immediate appointment as Deputy Prime Minister, with the portfolios of foreign affairs and trade and industry. He publicly supported the Grenadian revolutionaries, who were constructing a new airport with Cuban support. Ronald Reagan alleged that this was to be used as a launching point for Soviet aircraft, and Odlum&#x27;s support for it worried both the Americans (due to their concerns about the purposes of the new facility) and his fellow communists, who saw him as a &quot;loose cannon&quot; and thought that his continuing public championing of it would further draw American attention.

Louisy had become Prime Minister thanks to a secret agreement with Odlum that he would resign, allowing Odlum to take over, within 6 months. When the time came Louisy refused, backed by the Americans, who wanted to keep Odlum out of office at all costs. This saw Odlum turn against his own government and even vote against the budget. A second proposal that Louisy resign was rejected on 30 December 1980, with the power struggle continuing despite his agreement to hand over some of his portfolios. The dispute continued into 1981, with Odlum attracting controversy by announcing on 3 March that he had not ignored the possibility of his grouping within the Labour Party splitting and joining the United Workers Party.

The result was the 1981 dismissal of Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister and the resignation of Louisy. Louisy was succeeded not by Odlum, but by Winston Cenac, who himself resigned eight months later on 16 January 1982. Cenac was succeeded by Michael Pilgrim in an attempt by moderates in the Labour Party to avoid the possibility of Odlum leading the country. By this point Odlum had left the party, forming the Progressive Labour Party (PLP). Pilgrim&#x27;s government also collapsed, necessitating an early general election in 1982 in which the Labour Party was left with only 3 of the 17 seats, returning the United Workers Party to government and seeing Odlum dismissed from Parliament. His Progressive Labour Party won only a single seat.

===Ambassador and Foreign Minister===
Now outside Parliament, Odlum maintained his presence in the public eye through meetings and the work of his newspaper, &quot;The Crusader&quot;. His revenge over the Labour Party finally occurred during the 1987 general election, when the PLP split the vote and denied his old allies victory. In 1995 he accepted the position of Ambassador to the United Nations from Compton, his old enemy, holding it for only a year. When Compton resigned in 1996, Odlum chose to stand for election against his successor and lost the contest.

After again allying with the Labour Party in 1997, Odlum was returned to Parliament, receiving appointment as Foreign Minister in the government of Kenny Anthony. In this position, he oversaw the improvement of diplomatic relations with Cuba, announcing that a consulate would be established there and spearheading the signing of a joint Cuban-Saint Lucian trading agreement to oversee improvements in the agricultural and healthcare sectors. Odlum&#x27;s ministry also saw the diplomatic recognition of China in 1997, following month-long negotiations and the offer of several million dollars worth of aid to Saint Lucia. Taiwan responded to the announcement by breaking off relations, stating that the government&#x27;s move to recognise China had harmed Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;national interests and dignity&quot;. After diplomatic relations were officially established, Odlum visited China between 5 and 12 September.

Odlum resigned in 2001 after a series of controversies. His fellow ministers accused him of conspiring against the government and attempting to have it overthrown and replaced with a new administration. Odlum, on the other hand, argued that ruling members of the Labour Party had been making efforts to remove him and that the &quot;dastardly act&quot; of cutting away a significant portion of his constituency in a boundary change was what had forced him over the edge. His resignation came immediately before a letter of dismissal arrived at his house.

Odlum formed the National Alliance party to contest the 2001 elections, but the party failed to win any seats.

==Retirement and death==
Odlum attracted controversy in November 2002 when he spoke at the funeral service for Antiguan politician Tim Hector. His speech censured the attendees for what he perceived as mourning Hector in death while failing to support him in life, asking &quot;were you there when the ballot process was contaminated to declare him a loser? Were you there?&quot;. His speech was criticised by Vere Bird, Jr., the Antiguan Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries, who called Odlum&#x27;s words &quot;strident and ill-informed reflections&quot;.

Following a long fight against cancer, spending most of the last year of his life in and out of hospital, Odlum died on 28 September 2003 in Tapion Hospital, Castries, aged 69. The body lay in state on 5 October, where it was viewed by Pearlette Louisy, Kenny Anthony, and members of the Cabinet. Odlum&#x27;s funeral was held on 6 October, with a 30-vehicle procession travelling from Vieux Fort to Castries; it was led by a pair of police outriders and a coach carrying the coffin, draped in the national flag. St Lucian citizens were reported to be openly weeping at Odlum&#x27;s death. The funeral itself was held in a park, due to no church in Castries being large enough to hold the number of mourners. During the service, sections of his most famous speeches were broadcast from loudspeakers. James Fletcher, a Cabinet Secretary, had previously announced that all flags would be flown at half-mast for the day as a tribute.

Edwin Carrington, the Secretary-General of the Caribbean Community, stated that Odlum &quot;served his country, St Lucia, with distinction&quot; and was &quot;charismatic, eloquent and a consummate master of communication, both in speaking and writing...one of the region&#x27;s leading and most persistent exponents on the debilitating effects of the erosion of trade preferences for the region&#x27;s banana industry on the livelihood of the people&quot;. Other tributes came from Ralph Gonsalves, the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, who described Odlum as &quot;one of the region&#x27;s finest political orators, who was persuasive, eloquent and was able to command attention universally, not only in his native capital city Castries but also at the United Nations, in Geneva, Cape Town or in London&quot;.

In 2004, on the anniversary of his death, a series of activities were organised in memory of Odlum. These included the dedication of a tomb at the Choc Cemetery and a service at the Mount of Prayer in Coubaril that was attended by his family and close friends.

==Legacy==
Odlum, known simply as &quot;Brother George&quot;, had a controversial legacy. He was noted as one of the region&#x27;s greatest orators, able to command attention not only in Saint Lucia itself, but at the United Nations and on the world stage. Supporters praised his connection with the working class, and his fight for better pay and conditions in the agricultural sector.

At the same time, both critics and supporters point towards awkward elements of his personality and career. Gonsalves, at his funeral, noted that &quot;the strictures of bureaucratic systems he found difficult to be contained within&quot;, while his obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; described him as a man &quot;with more flamboyance than substance&quot;. His resignation from the two Labour administrations, as well as his alliances with the UWP and other factions, were noted as contradictions which would require historical debate and assessment. His support of figures such as Fidel Castro and Muammar Gaddafi was also noted as controversial, with his relentless left-wing approach to politics being identified as damaging both to others and to the causes he championed.

She explores different musical styles, with the albums &quot;Absolute Ego&quot; and &quot;Material&quot; displaying electronica influences. &quot;Absolute Ego&quot; was produced by ex-Denki Groove keyboardist, Yoshinori Sunahara and &quot;The Other Side of Absolute Ego&quot; album contains remixes by Tricky, DJ Krush, and Silent Poets.

In 2003, after a two-year hiatus, she enlisted the help of the avant-garde audio-visual performance group &quot;&quot; for her quieter, more delicate album, &quot;Irony&quot;. AllMusic described &quot;Irony&quot; as &quot;one of the most beautiful albums to come out of Japan in 2003&quot;, with the music compared to an &quot;airy lullaby&quot;.

<text>Likouala is a department of the Republic of the Congo in the northern part of the country. It borders the departments of Cuvette and Sangha, and internationally, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. The region has an area of 66,044 km² and an estimated population of almost 360,000. The chief town is Impfondo. Principal cities and towns include Epena and Dongou.

==History==
The earliest inhabitants of the region were the Aka people, a Pygmy tribe. During the Bantu expansion, they were pushed into the forests by newcomers.

Historically, this department was cut off from part of Lobaye, an area of the Central African Republic.

Between 1984 and 2002 the population of Likouala Department more than tripled, due in large part to inflows of refugees from the Central African Republic, Rwanda, and the DRC. During this period, refugees made up more than half of the population, mostly concentrated in Impfondo and Betou.

== Administrative divisions ==
Likouala Department is divided into seven districts:

=== Districts ===
# Impfondo District
# Epena District
# Dongou District
# Bétou District
# Bouanéla District
# Enyellé District
# Liranga District

==Geography==
Likouala is almost covered with dense and often flooded forests of lakes and very full of fish ponds. Its ground is argillaceous and sandy by places. The north of the department belongs to the mountainous Massif Oubanguien. The shallow Lac Tele is 5 km across and circular in shape.

===Climate===
Likouala has a tropical climate. The dry season is from March to July, the remainder of the year being dominated by the rainy season. The variations in temperatures are in general important (24° to 25°C).

===Demography===
The populations of Likouala would have come from North, the South, the East and the West. The Pygmies are regarded as the first occupants of this ground. The department counts many Rwandan, Central African refugees today and of Congo-Kinshasa.

===Forestry===
Six forest units of installation (UFA) are in the course of exploitation by several companies, of which Processing industry of the wood of Likouala (ITBL) and Likouala-Timber. Likouala currently occupies the first place in the production of wood of Congo.

===Rivers and fisheries===
The department has an important hydraulic network. The principal rivers are Oubangui, Likouala-aux-herbes, Libenga and Motaba. Fishing is practised in these rivers in an artisanal way. According to FAO, its halieutic potential is evaluated with 100.000 tons per annum.

==Agriculture==
Agriculture is of traditional type. 
The principal food crops are the manioc, the banana, the taros; as well as products of gathering. One also produces the coffee, the cocoa and the palm oil. The crop year of last year yielded 1500 tons of cocoa. This production is falling because of the irregularity of the marketing of the products and the closing of the principal company which ensured the marketing of the cocoa in the department, Congo Otto-Export.

===Transport===
Geographic insulation is a handicap. Transport is very limited; the river port and the airport are the only access routes.

===Districts===
The department counts seven districts. The administrations are badly equipped and lack executives and personnel. Each of the seven districts corresponds to the basins of the region&#x27;s principal rivers. The districts of Liranga, Impfondo and Bétou comprised the villages located on right bank of the rivers Congo and Oubangui. The district of Dongou gathers the villages of the basin of Motaba. The district of Enyellé corresponds to the basin of Libenga and its confluence with Oubangui, to the border with the Central African Republic. The basin of Likouala-aux-herbes is divided by the district of Epena to the north and that of Bouanela in the south.

===Towns and cities===
The regional capital is Impfondo. Other towns include Ancien Sandjala, Boyelle, Dongou, Ibenga, Kitadi, Mabelou, Makasa, Makengo, Mongouala, and Motaba.

==Wildlife and conservation==
The region is undergoing a campaign to minimise hunting and reduce the impact of logging due to the establishment of nature reserves in the region.

The forest of Likouala abounds in animal species such as elephants, gorillas and chimpanzees. Likouala is home to, among other animals, the dwarf crocodile &quot;Osteolaemus tetraspis osborni&quot;.
==Mythological creatures==
Reports of a surviving sauropod called the Mokele Mbembe or n&#x27;yamala emanate from here.

Kavan was born in London as the son of a Czechoslovak diplomat, Pavel Kavan, and a British teacher, Rosemary Kavanová. Kavan moved back to Czechoslovakia with his parents as a child. His father was then arrested in a Communist Party purge and sentenced to 25 years in prison in a show trial in the 1950s. He was eventually released, but died in 1960 aged 46. Kavan&#x27;s mother later wrote a memoir, &quot;Love and Freedom&quot;. Kavan was one of the student leaders of the Prague Spring movement in 1968. When the movement was crushed by the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia, Kavan emigrated to the United Kingdom, the country of his birth, where he was a member of the Labour Party from 1972 to 1990.

Kavan is member of the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD). He was the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic from 1998 to 2002 and one of the deputy prime ministers from 1999 to 2002. He was a member of the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly from 1990 to 1992, member of the Senate of the Czech Republic from 1996 to 2000, and a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 2002 to 2006. He was elected President of the United Nations General Assembly and acted in this office from 2002 to 2003.

Before returning to former Czechoslovakia after the fall of the Communist government, Kavan spent 20 years in exile in the UK. While in exile he was the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Palach Press&quot;, a press agency. He was also editor of the &quot;East European Reporter&quot; and vice-president of the &quot;East European Cultural Foundation&quot;, both organizations having been founded by him. In 1991, back in Czechoslovakia, Kavan was wrongly accused of collaboration with the Czechoslovak secret service (StB) in the years 1969–1970. He was totally cleared of the charges by a Prague Municipal Court in 1994 and finally, after a renewed process, by a Court of Appeals in January 1996.

He received several honorary degrees, including Honorary Fellow of the London School of Economics, Honorary Professor of Human Rights, Adelphi University of New York, and a number of human rights awards including &quot;Companion of Honour&quot; (UK), &quot;International Order of Merit&quot; (UK), and &quot;Presidential Roll of Honor&quot; (USA).

Kavan was educated at the Charles University in Prague, the London School of Economics and the University of Reading. He is divorced and has four children.

<doc id="1018844" wikidata="Q353208" url="?curid=1018844" title="Aulus Didius Gallus Fabricius Veiento">
<text>Aulus Didius Gallus Fabricius Veiento was a Roman senator who played a major role in the courts of several Roman emperors during the first century AD. For his usefulness, Veiento was rewarded with the office of suffect consul three times in a period when three consulates were very rare for non-members of the Imperial family. 

Modern authorities have interpreted the nature of Veiento&#x27;s role in different ways. Older writers, following the insinuations of Cassius Dio and Pliny the Younger, tended to ascribe to Veiento a malevolent role. For example, Ronald Syme summarized his career in this sentence: &quot;Veiento began as a dealer in petty patronage, and he ended as a merchant of honor.&quot; William C. McDermott has since provided a more balanced evaluation of this figure. This has led more recent writers to evaluate him as &quot;one of the most interesting of his Domitian&#x27;s senatorial &quot;amici&quot;, frequently but erroneously classified as an informer during the so-called reign of terror.&quot;

== Life ==
His name suggests that Veiento was related to Aulus Didius Gallus, suffect consul of AD 39 and governor of Roman Britain. Some experts, such as Edmund Groag and Mario Torelli, thought that Veiento was the son or grandson of the governor of Britain. Olli Salomies has shown that it is more likely that Veiento was adopted by Didius Gallus at some point before Veiento became praetor.

Jones speculates that it was while he was with Didius Gallus that he first met the future emperors, &quot;for Domitian&#x27;s father and brother commanded two of Claudius&#x27;s legions in the British invasions.&quot;

=== Career under Nero ===
An action Veiento took while praetor is his first certain appearance in history. According to Dio Cassius, the emperor Nero&#x27;s favor of charioteers and horsekeepers had led them to make unreasonable demands. In response, Veiento replaced them with chariots drawn by trained dogs. This led Brian W. Jones to describe him as &quot;one of the earliest known strike-breakers.&quot;

However, the year Veiento was praetor is not fixed. S. J. de Laet proposed 41; McDermott believed he was praetor in 54; Jones in 1971 pointed out that &quot;there is nothing to prevent its being dated to around 60, to some time towards the end of the &quot;Quinquennium Neronis&quot;&quot;, although in a later publication admitted that 54 was &quot;possible&quot;. If Veiento reached the rank of praetor at the legal age of 30, and we accept McDermott&#x27;s date of 54 as when he held it, then we can deduce Veiento was born around the year AD 24.

His next appearance in history is in 62, when he was tried and exiled. Tacitus tells the story:

A similar accusation caused the downfall of Fabricius Veiento. He had composed many libels on senators and pontiffs in a work to which he gave the title of &quot;Codicils.&quot; Tullius Geminus, the prosecutor, further stated that he had habitually trafficked in the emperor&#x27;s favours and in the right of promotion. This was Nero&#x27;s reason for himself undertaking the trial, and having convicted Veiento, he banished him from Italy, and ordered the burning of his books, which, while it was dangerous to procure them, were anxiously sought and much read. Soon full freedom for their possession caused their oblivion.

McDermott notes, &quot;At first glance this seems to be denigration of Veiento, but a closer look at the passage and its context reveals Veiento in a very different light.&quot; McDermott points out the context of this passage — the preceding chapters narrate the recrudescence of charges under the &quot;Lex Julia maiestatis&quot;, or treason — suggests the motivation of this prosecution was not Veiento&#x27;s &quot;Codicils&quot;, instead an excuse to confiscate his property. McDermott also notes that what Tacitus says here is not that Veiento sold &quot;the emperor&#x27;s favours and . . . the right of promotion&quot;, but that Tullius Geminus accused Veiento of this. &quot;Such fictitious additions to the central charge of &quot;maiestas laesa&quot; were common,&quot; McDermott reminds us. Veiento was more the victim of court intrigue than the agent of it.

=== Career under Vespasian ===
Obviously Veiento returned from exile following the suicide of Nero in 68. He found favor with Vespasian through means unknown, but it resulted in his first suffect consulship. The date of his consulship may be as early as Vespasian&#x27;s reign when he first became &quot;amicus Caesaris&quot; and a member of the &quot;consilium principis&quot;. He was clearly favored by Vespasian&#x27;s son Titus, for his second suffect consulship was in 80.

Here Veiento&#x27;s career appears to be anomalous, for there is no certain record of a &quot;cursus honorum&quot;. McDermott identifies him as the subject of a fragmentary inscription found at Arles, and his restoration of this inscription, which he admits is speculative in places, shows he was governor of three provinces (one of which was either Asia or Africa), as well as legate of an unknown legion — which would supply Veiento with a conventional career. Although Gallivan accepts the identification, other experts have yet to accept the provinces McDermott proposes for Veiento. In a response to McDermott&#x27;s paper, Brian Jones asserted &quot;there is no evidence to suggest that Quintus Vibius Crispus could not have held the offices which the inscription mentions.&quot; Further, Werner Eck offers a different restoration of the first line and argues that the inscription pertains to Marcus Pompeius Silvanus Staberius Flavianus.
Veiento&#x27;s career in the Roman priesthood is far better documented. A votive inscription of Trajanic date recording Veiento&#x27;s satisfaction of a vow to the goddess Nemetona in Moguntiacum (Mainz) attests to the priesthoods he held. These offices are listed as follows: &quot;Quindecimviri sacris faciundis&quot;, one of the four most prestigious ancient Roman priesthoods; &quot;Sodales Augustales&quot;; &quot;Sodales Flaviales&quot;; and &quot;Sodales Titialis&quot;. McDermott dates his membership in the &quot;Quindecimviri&quot; &quot;possibly under Nero before his exile in 62. He may even have become a member while his adoptive father was still alive.&quot; When he became &quot;Sodales Augustales&quot; and &quot;Sodales Titialis&quot; is not known. Entrance to the &quot;Sodales Flaviales&quot; obviously should be dated soon after Vespasian&#x27;s death.

Not only may this explain his dominance in Domitian&#x27;s reign, for the emperor is known to have been interested in the minutiae of religion, but McDermott explains it may explain the point of Veiento&#x27;s &quot;Codicils&quot; as an attack on the &quot;levity and inattention to rituals&quot; of his peers.

=== Career under Domitian ===
More details have survived about Veiento&#x27;s role in Domitian&#x27;s reign. Both a fragment of Statius&#x27; &quot;De bello Germanico&quot; and Juvenal&#x27;s Satire IV show that Veiento, with Lucius Junius Quintus Vibius Crispus, the elderly Acilius Glabrio, the blind Lucius Valerius Catullus Messalinus, and Veiento were four of Domitian&#x27;s most important advisors. Jones agrees in part with this evaluation, but argues that these &quot;amici&quot; were &quot;summoned to court only when he needed their advice.&quot; Those who had real power were Domitian&#x27;s own appointees: the urban prefect Plotius Pegasus, praetorian prefects like Lucius Laberius Maximus, the &quot;a cubiculo&quot;, and the &quot;a rationibus&quot;.

There is also evidence that Veiento accompanied Domitian on his Dacian campaign against the Chatti. Jones explains the context of the bronze tablet found at Moguntiacum due to his presence as Domitian&#x27;s &quot;comes&quot;, and speculates that Veiento may have been sent to the commanders there to explain Domitian&#x27;s strategy, that &quot;must have seemed close to cowardice to most of them&quot; yet was as effective as the Fabian strategy against Hannibal.

Lastly, it was under Domitian when Veiento was appointed consul a third time, which experts believe was in 83.

=== Career under Nerva ===
Veiento evidently survived the assassination of Domitian without loss of rank or property, for he next appears in history at a banquet hosted by the emperor Nerva during the first year of his reign (AD 97). Pliny the Younger recounts how Veiento had been invited to the same dinner as Junius Mauricus, who had been exiled due to the efforts of a &quot;delator&quot; or informer. The blind Lucius Valerius Catullus Messalinus, who had been a notorious &quot;delator&quot; during his lifetime, was mentioned, and the emperor mused, &quot;If he had gone on living, what do you think would have become of him?&quot; Junius Mauricus replied, &quot;He would be dining with us.&quot; Pliny elsewhere in his letter makes it clear the comment was directed at Veiento.

The other incident recorded by Pliny is when Veiento, joined with four other ex-consuls and senators to oppose Pliny&#x27;s motion to prosecute another &quot;delator&quot;, Publicius Certus, who had brought down Helvidius Priscus in 93. Despite the fact Pliny was almost alone in pursuing the matter, through his eloquence he convinced the Senate to approve the prosecution, despite a final plea against legal actions from Veiento. While the emperor Nerva failed to act on the motion to prosecute, Certus was passed over in consideration for a consulship, and in any event fell ill and died soon after this session of the Senate.

These two anecdotes have led many writers — such as Syme above — to infer that Veiento himself was an informer who accused many prominent men of crimes in order to seize their wealth; as McDermott points out, all these passages prove is that the Younger Pliny greatly disliked Veiento. McDermott notes that Tacitus, who was a member of the &quot;Quindecimviri sacris faciundis&quot; like Veiento, and either knew the man well, or knew of him, did not consider Veiento a &quot;delator&quot;. When offering a list of &quot;delatores&quot; active under Domitian, Tacitus names Mettius Carus, the blind Catullus Messalinus, and Baebius Massa, but not Veiento.

Veiento&#x27;s last recorded act is on the Senate floor in 97, pleading leniency for Publicius Certus. How much longer he lived is unknown: assuming our above calculation of AD 24 for his birthdate is correct, then Veiento was about 73 at the time of his last appearance. McDermott mentions an allusion in Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Panegyric&quot; to the emperor Trajan (delivered 100) to a man sitting in the Senate who had been consul three times, and wonders if it was Veiento; based on our calculations, this is plausible for he would have been 76 years old at the time.

== Family ==
From the bronze tablet found at Moguntiacum, we know the name of Veiento&#x27;s wife, Attica. Nothing certain is known of her. Juvenal makes a puzzling allusion to Eppia, the wife of a senator, who deserts her husband and family and follows a gladiator to Egypt; the senator might be Veiento. &quot;Is Eppia the wife of Veiento whose name was Attica (both names are dactyls), or is Veiento merely a type of &quot;senex&quot;?&quot; McDermott asks. He cannot determine whether the senator is actually the three-time consul, and if so, whether Eppia is a cover name for Attica, or perhaps the name of a second wife.

<text>Pool () is a department of the Republic of the Congo in the southeastern part of the country. It borders the departments of Bouenza, Lékoumou, and Plateaux. Internationally, it borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It also surrounds the commune district of the national capital, Brazzaville.

The regional capital is Kinkala. Principal towns include Boko, Kindamba and Mindouli. In the early 2000s, the Pool region was the home of a low-level insurgency led by Pasteur Ntumi. The inhabitants of this department are the Kongo, the Téké and the Native population (Pygmies).

The region is named after the Pool Malebo (formerly Stanley Pool), a particularly wide stretch of the Congo River here.

== Administrative divisions ==
Pool Department is divided into thirteen districts:

# Kinkala District
# Boko District
# Mindouli District
# Kindamba District
# Goma Tsé-Tsé District
# Mayama District
# Ngabé District
# Mbanza–Ndounga District
# Louingui District
# Loumo District
# Ignié District
# Vindza District
# Kimba District

<text>The Perseus Arm is one of two major spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy. The second major arm is called the Scutum–Centaurus Arm. The Perseus Arm begins from the distal end of the long Milky Way central bar. Previously thought to be 13,000 light-years away, it is now thought to lie 6,400 light years from the Solar System.

==Overview==
The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms and a number of minor arms or spurs. The Perseus Spiral Arm, with a radius of approximately 10.7 kiloparsecs, is located between the minor Cygnus and Carina–Sagittarius Arms. It is named after the Perseus constellation in the direction of which it is seen from Earth.

Recently, scientists in two large radio astronomy projects, the Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy (BeSSeL) Survey and the Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA), have made great efforts over about 20 years to measure the trigonometric parallaxes toward about 200 water vapor () and methanol () masers in massive star-forming regions in the Milky Way. They have employed these parallax measurements to delineate the forms of spiral arms from the Galactic longitude 2 to 240 degrees and extended the spiral arm traces into the portion of the Milky Way seen from the Southern Hemisphere using tangencies along some arms based on carbon monoxide emission. The image clearly presents the Milky Way as a barred spiral galaxy with fairly symmetric four major arms and some extra arm segments and spurs.

The Perseus Arm is one of the four major arms. The arm is the length of more than 60,000 lr and the width of about 1,000 lr and the spiral extension in the pitch angle near 9 degree.

There is speculation that the local spur known as the Orion–Cygnus Arm, which includes the Solar System and Earth and is located inside of the Perseus Arm, or is a branch of it, but this is unconfirmed.

The Perseus Arm contains the Double Cluster and a number of Messier objects:
*The Crab Nebula (M1)
*Open Cluster M36
*Open Cluster M37
*Open Cluster M38
*Open Cluster M52
*Open Cluster M103.

<text>The Scutum–Centaurus Arm, also known as Scutum-Crux arm, is a long, diffuse curving streamer of stars, gas and dust that spirals outward from the proximate end of the Milky Way&#x27;s central bar. The Milky Way has been posited since the 1950s to have four spiral arms; numerous studies contest or nuance this number. In 2008, observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope failed to show the expected density of red clump giants in the direction of the Sagittarius and Norma arms. In January 2014, a 12-year study into the distribution and lifespan of massive stars and a 2013-reporting study of the distribution of masers and open clusters both found corroboratory, though would not state irrefutable, evidence for four principal spiral arms.

The Scutum–Centaurus Arm lies between the minor Carina–Sagittarius Arm and the minor Norma Arm. The Scutum–Centaurus Arm starts near the core as the &quot;Scutum Arm&quot;, then gradually turns into the &quot;Centaurus Arm&quot;.

The region where the Scutum–Centaurus Arm connects to the bar of the galaxy is rich in star-forming regions and open clusters. In 2006 a large cluster of new stars containing 14 red supergiant stars was discovered there and named RSGC1. In 2007 a cluster of approximately 50,000 newly formed stars named RSGC2 was located only a few hundred light years from RSGC1. It is thought to be less than 20 million years old and contains 26 red supergiant stars, the largest grouping of such stars known. Other clusters in this region include RSGC3 and Alicante 8.

<text>Lékoumou (can also be written as Lekumu) is a department of the Republic of the Congo in the southern part of the country. It borders the departments of Bouenza, Niari, Plateaux, Pool, and the nation of Gabon. The regional capital is Sibiti. Principal cities and towns include Komono and Zanaga.

== Administrative divisions ==
Lékoumou Department is divided into five districts:

=== Districts ===
# Sibiti District
# Komono District
# Zanaga District
# Bambama District
# Mayéyé District

== Economy ==

Subsistence farming, carried out by small producers (cassava, peanuts, tarots, plantain, squash, sorrel, ginger, artisanal palm oil), and arboriculture (safoutiers, mango trees, bananas) are the main agricultural activities. The timber industry is an important activity. The Lékoumou contains iron deposits, the most important of which is that of Zanaga. Its exploitation by a partnership between the South African Zanaga Iron Ore Company and the Swiss group Glencore Xstrata, is subject to the rise in world iron prices.

The region offers tourist wealth oriented towards the discovery of the country, the forest, the villages and their products. A liana bridge, located towards Bambama, near the village of Simonbondo, on the Gabonese border, is famous for the choice of natural materials and their assembly, making it possible to cross 74 m. without intermediate support

<doc id="1018861" wikidata="Q1934237" url="?curid=1018861" title="The Serpent's Egg (album)">
<text>The Serpent&#x27;s Egg is the fourth studio album by the Australian band Dead Can Dance, released on 24 October 1988 by record label 4AD.

== Background ==

The album was the last produced while Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard were a romantic couple. A majority of the album was recorded in a multi-storey apartment block in the Isle of Dogs, London.

Perry discussed the album&#x27;s title: &quot;In a lot of aerial photographs of the Earth, if you look upon it as a giant organism—a macrocosmos—you can see that the nature of the life force, water, travels in a serpentine way&quot;.

== Track listing ==


==Reception ==
In a retrospective review, AllMusic said, &quot;Perry and Gerrard continued to experiment and improve with &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Egg&quot;, as much a leap forward as &quot;Spleen and Ideal&quot; was some years previously&quot;, heaping particular praise on the album opener &quot;The Host of Seraphim&quot;, which it called &quot;so jaw-droppingly good that almost the only reaction is sheer awe&quot;.

== Legacy ==
* Electronic music duo The Chemical Brothers used a reversed sample of &quot;Song of Sophia&quot; in &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; in 1992, later also included on the album &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; in 1995.
* Orkidea sampled &quot;The Host of Seraphim&quot; in his 1999 single &quot;Unity&quot;.
* Rapper G Herbo sampled &quot;The Host of Seraphim&quot; on his song &quot;4 Minutes of Hell, Part 3&quot; from his debut mixtape, &quot;Welcome to Fazoland&quot;.
* Experimental act Ulver covered &quot;In the Kingdom of the Blind the One-Eyed Are Kings&quot; for the Dead Can Dance tribute album &quot;Tribute to Dead Can Dance: The Lotus Eaters&quot;, released in 2004.
* French rapper Keny Arkana sampled &quot;The Host Of Seraphim&quot; on her song &quot;Je Passe Le Salut&quot;, from her album &quot;L&#x27;Esquisse Vol. 2&quot; released in 2011.
* &quot;In the Kingdom of the Blind the One-Eyed Are Kings&quot; was also covered by death metal act Cattle Decapitation as a bonus track on their 2019 album &quot;Death Atlas&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;The Host of Seraphim&quot; was featured in the 1992 non-narrative documentary film &quot;Baraka&quot; (and was included in the film&#x27;s ), the theatrical trailers for the 2003 film &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; and the 2006 film &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;, in the final scenes of the 2007 film &quot;The Mist&quot;, in the fire scene of the 2010 film &quot;Legend of the guardians&quot;, &quot;How to get away with murder&quot; (season 3 episode 15 and season 6 episode 9), in the 2018 film &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, and the 2002 film &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot; starring John Malkovich.

A short excerpt of &quot;Ullyses&quot; was also used as background music in the BBC Horizon episode #30.7 &quot;Hunt For The Doomsday Asteroid&quot; in February 1994, originally broadcast ahead of the predicted impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with the planet Jupiter in July that same year.

&quot;Severance&quot; was used in the &quot;Victims of Circumstance&quot; episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.

<text>Astrology and astronomy were archaically treated together (), but gradually distinguished through the Late Middle Ages into the Age of Reason. Developments in 17th century philosophy resulted in astrology and astronomy operating as independent pursuits by the 18th century.

Whereas the academic discipline of astronomy studies observable phenomena beyond the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the pseudoscience of astrology uses the apparent positions of celestial objects as the basis for divination.

==Overview==

In pre-modern times, most cultures did not make a clear distinction between the two disciplines, putting them both together as one. In ancient Babylonia, famed for its astrology, there were not separate roles for the astronomer as predictor of celestial phenomena, and the astrologer as their interpreter; both functions were performed by the same person. In ancient Greece, pre-Socratic thinkers such as Anaximander, Xenophanes, Anaximenes, and Heraclides speculated about the nature and substance of the stars and planets. Astronomers such as Eudoxus (contemporary with Plato) observed planetary motions and cycles, and created a geocentric cosmological model that would be accepted by Aristotle. This model generally lasted until Ptolemy, who added epicycles to explain the retrograde motion of Mars. (Around 250 BC, Aristarchus of Samos postulated a proto-heliocentric theory, which would not be reconsidered for nearly two millennia (Copernicus), as Aristotle&#x27;s geocentric model continued to be favored.) The Platonic school promoted the study of astronomy as a part of philosophy because the motions of the heavens demonstrate an orderly and harmonious cosmos. In the third century BC, Babylonian astrology began to make its presence felt in Greece. Astrology was criticized by Hellenistic philosophers such as the Academic Skeptic Carneades and Middle Stoic Panaetius. However, the notions of the Great Year (when all the planets complete a full cycle and return to their relative positions) and eternal recurrence were Stoic doctrines that made divination and fatalism possible.

In the Hellenistic world, the Greek words &#x27;astrologia&#x27; and &#x27;astronomia&#x27; were often used interchangeably, but they were conceptually not the same. Plato taught about &#x27;astronomia&#x27; and stipulated that planetary phenomena should be described by a geometrical model. The first solution was proposed by Eudoxus. Aristotle favored a physical approach and adopted the word &#x27;astrologia&#x27;. Eccentrics and epicycles came to be thought of as useful fictions. For a more general public, the distinguishing principle was not evident and either word was acceptable. For the Babylonian horoscopic practice, the words specifically used were &#x27;apotelesma&#x27; and &#x27;katarche&#x27;, but otherwise it was subsumed under the aristotelian term &#x27;astrologia&#x27;.

In his compilatory work Etymologiae, Isidore of Seville noted explicitly the difference between the terms astronomy and astrology (Etymologiae, III, xxvii) and the same distinction appeared later in the texts of Arabian writers. Isidore identified the two strands entangled in the astrological discipline and called them &quot;astrologia naturalis&quot; and &quot;astrologia superstitiosa&quot;.

Astrology was widely accepted in medieval Europe as astrological texts from Hellenistic and Arabic astrologers were translated into Latin. In the late Middle Ages, its acceptance or rejection often depended on its reception in the royal courts of Europe. Not until the time of Francis Bacon was astrology rejected as a part of scholastic metaphysics rather than empirical observation. A more definitive split between astrology and astronomy in the West took place gradually in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when astrology was increasingly thought of as an occult science or superstition by the intellectual elite. Because of their lengthy shared history, it sometimes happens that the two are confused with one another even today. Many contemporary astrologers, however, do not claim that astrology is a science, but think of it as a form of divination like the I-Ching, an art, or a part of a spiritual belief structure (influenced by trends such as Neoplatonism, Neopaganism, Theosophy, and Hinduism).

==Distinguishing characteristics==

The primary goal of astronomy is to understand the physics of the universe. Astrologers use astronomical calculations for the positions of celestial bodies along the ecliptic and attempt to correlate celestial events (astrological aspects, sign positions) with earthly events and human affairs. Astronomers consistently use the scientific method, naturalistic presuppositions and abstract mathematical reasoning to investigate or explain phenomena in the universe. Astrologers use mystical or religious reasoning as well as traditional folklore, symbolism and superstition blended with mathematical predictions to explain phenomena in the universe. The scientific method is not consistently used by astrologers.

Astrologers practice their discipline geocentrically and they consider the universe to be harmonious, changeless and static, while astronomers have employed the scientific method to infer that the universe is without a center and is dynamic, expanding outward per the Big Bang theory.

Astrologers believe that the position of the stars and planets determine an individual&#x27;s personality and future. Astronomers study the actual stars and planets, but have found no evidence supporting astrological theories. Psychologists study personality, and while there are many theories of personality, no mainstream theories in that field are based on astrology. (The Myers-Briggs personality typology, based on the works of Carl Jung, has four major categories that correspond to the astrological elements of fire, air, earth, and water. This theory of personality is used by career counselors and life coaches but not by psychologists.)

Both astrologers and astronomers see Earth as being an integral part of the universe, that Earth and the universe are interconnected as one &quot;cosmos&quot; (not as being separate and distinct from each other). However, astrologers philosophically and mystically portray the cosmos as having a supernatural, metaphysical and divine essence that actively influences world events and the personal lives of people. Astronomers, as members of the scientific community, cannot use in their scientific articles explanations that are not derived from empirically reproducible conditions, irrespective of their personal convictions.

== Historical divergence ==

For a long time the funding from astrology supported some astronomical research, which was in turn used to make more accurate ephemerides for use in astrology. In Medieval Europe the word &quot;Astronomia&quot; was often used to encompass both disciplines as this included the study of astronomy and astrology jointly and without a real distinction; this was one of the original Seven Liberal Arts. Kings and other rulers generally employed court astrologers to aid them in the decision making in their kingdoms, thereby funding astronomical research. University medical students were taught astrology as it was generally used in medical practice.

Astronomy and astrology diverged over the course of the 17th through 19th centuries. Copernicus did not practice astrology (nor empirical astronomy; his work was theoretical), but the most important astronomers before Isaac Newton were astrologers by profession—Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo Galilei.

Also relevant here was the development of better timekeeping instruments, initially for aid in navigation; improved timekeeping made it possible to make more exact astrological predictions—predictions which could be tested, and which consistently proved to be false. By the end of the 18th century, astronomy was one of the major sciences of the Enlightenment model, using the recently codified scientific method, and was altogether distinct from astrology.

== Astrology and Zodiac Signs in the Modern Age ==
Astrology is considered by many philosophers and astronomers to be a false representation of the universe that individuals may use to associate the movement of the celestial bodies to their own ideas of human life and spirituality. Although many scholars consider astrology to be a pseudoscience, those that believe in zodiac signs and their meanings will argue the opposite, and these followers will support their claims with explanations for how and why the universe is connected to the human condition.

The most popular and well-known form of astrology is seen in horoscopes that people are exposed to through social media, popular news outlets, and digital media. The horoscopes allow people interested in astrology and zodiac signs to associate planets like Mars to human emotions such as drive and courage, and further increase the notion that these planets and their motions have an effect on their daily lives. Although astrology was considered factual predictions in ancient science, in modern times it is used as a spiritual belief system for many people. Ancient forms of astrology often combined with astronomy, but eventually split into separate paths during the time of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo.

Zodiac signs in modern times are constructed from constellations seen across the earth, and they are used to associate human emotions and tendencies with the stars and heavenly bodies. In some ways, astrology has become somewhat of a pseudo-religion, due to the emphasis put on the meanings of constellations and how they relate to each individual. One may &quot;judge&quot; another person based on their zodiac sign, simply because there are unique listed traits carried by each sign, which reflect on the person who it refers to.

The signs that are attributed to individuals are based on the time of year that each individual was born in. For example, people born between about 20 April and 20 May will carry the zodiac sign of Taurus, and those born between about 23 July and 22 August carry the Leo sign. Despite the many individuals that consider zodiac astrology to be factual, many consider the horoscope meanings to be false and simply participate in this modern astrology for enjoyment. Lastly, zodiac signs and astrology in the modern era are very different from the astrology of the ancient world. The minimal technology, knowledge, and expertise of the ancient world allowed for the combination of astrology and astronomy to become the generally accepted explanation for the universe and its impact on human lives. Whereas in current times, astrology and astronomy are extremely different.

Zodiac signs and horoscopes are a product of cultural developments (such as the internet) that allow for easy access to information on the horoscopes through social media, tabloids and news outlets that benefit from promoting these aspects of astrology. Many individuals that are interested in horoscopes are not aware that the signs and their respective dates are inaccurate, and do not have any basis in science. Due to the &quot;trendy&quot; nature of zodiac signs and their popularity, it is widely recognized as part of global culture.

* Scorpio is not visible through the full period. Instead, the constellation Ophiuchus is visible during this time and so is a proposed 13th zodiac sign.

<text>Dębica County () is a unit of territorial administration and local government (powiat) in Subcarpathian Voivodeship, south-eastern Poland. It was created on 1 January 1999 as a result of the Polish local government reforms passed in 1998. Its administrative seat and largest town is Dębica, which lies west of the regional capital Rzeszów. The only other towns in the county are Pilzno, lying south-west of Dębica, and Brzostek, south of Dębica.

The county covers an area of . As of 2019 its total population is 135,348, out of which the population of Dębica is 45,634, that of Pilzno is 4,912, that of Brzostek is 2,752, and the rural population is 82,050.

==Neighbouring counties==
Dębica County is bordered by Mielec County to the north, Ropczyce-Sędziszów County to the east, Strzyżów County to the south-east, Jasło County to the south, and Tarnów County and Dąbrowa County to the west.

==Administrative division==
The county is subdivided into seven gminas (one urban, two urban-rural and four rural). These are listed in the following table, in descending order of population.

==Transport==
Debica is the county&#x27;s only rail junction, from which lines emerge in three directions – eastwards to Rzeszow, westwards to Tarnow and northwards to Mielec. The west–east line, which goes from Wrocław via Debica, to Przemyśl, is electrified and is regarded as one of the most important rail connections in Poland. The line to Mielec, which goes further northwards to Tarnobrzeg and Sandomierz, is of secondary importance and is not electrified.

The county is conveniently located along the longest route in Europe, E40. Also, in Pilzno, the E40 road crosses with Polish national main road number 73, which goes from Kielce to Jasło.

<text>Sir Andrew William Dilnot, (born 19 June 1960) is a British economist and broadcaster. He was director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies from 1991 to 2002, and principal of St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford from 2002 to 2012, and Warden of Nuffield College, Oxford from 2012 to 2024. He served as Chair of the UK Statistics Authority from April 2012 until March 2017.

==Early life and education==
Dilnot attended Olchfa School, Swansea, a state comprehensive school. He also attended Maidstone Grammar School. He studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford.

==Career==
Dilnot was director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies from 1991 to 2002.

Dilnot was a presenter on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s programme about statistics &quot;More or Less&quot;. Many of the items on the programme deal with the misuse and fabrication of statistics. Dilnot and Michael Blastland wrote &quot;The Tiger That Isn&#x27;t&quot;, which was based on &quot;More or Less&quot;.

Dilnot became principal of St Hugh&#x27;s College in 2002, then the only head of house at an Oxford college educated at a comprehensive school. He became a Pro Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University in 2005.

On 16 March 2011, it was announced that &quot;with very mixed emotions&quot; Dilnot was to leave St Hugh&#x27;s College in September 2012 to become warden of Nuffield College, Oxford, &quot;which will allow me to spend much more time doing economics again.&quot; He retired in 2024.

In 2011, the government nominated Dilnot to be Chair of the UK Statistics Authority. Parliament formally endorsed the appointment on 13 December 2011. Andrew Dilnot is no longer chair of the authority, having stood down in 2017.

In 2019, Dilnot became chair of the Health Foundation&#x27;s oversight board for the REAL Centre (formerly Health and Social Care Sustainability Research Centre), which was set up to help health and social care policymakers consider long-term implications of their funding, design and delivery decisions.

==Commission on Funding of Care and Support==
In June 2010, Dilnot was asked by the government to chair the Commission on Funding of Care and Support. He took a sabbatical from St Hugh&#x27;s College from March to July 2011.

The commission published its report in July 2011. The commission&#x27;s primary recommendation was to limit individuals&#x27; contribution to social care costs to £35,000, after which the state would pay. Currently, individuals who do not fit means-tested criteria can be liable for unlimited costs.

The commission&#x27;s report was welcomed by Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, and both David Cameron and Ed Miliband called for cross-party talks on the issue.

==Honours==
Dilnot was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2000 Birthday Honours and knighted in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to Economics and Economic Policy.

He is an Honorary Fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, Queen Mary University of London, the Swansea Institute of Higher Education and the Institute of Actuaries, and holds honorary doctorates from City University and the Open University.

==Interests==
Dilnot has taken up the Northumbrian smallpipes as an adult learner.

<doc id="1018874" wikidata="Q997850" url="?curid=1018874" title="First Daughter (2004 film)">
<text>First Daughter is a 2004 American romantic comedy-drama film released by 20th Century Fox. It stars Katie Holmes as Samantha MacKenzie, daughter of the President of the United States, who enrolls at college and develops a relationship with another student (Marc Blucas). The film follows Samantha as she experiences a new sense of freedom during her time away from the White House, and the advantages and disadvantages of her college life. It co-stars Michael Keaton as the President of the United States and Amerie as Samantha&#x27;s roommate, Mia Thompson.

The film was directed by Forest Whitaker, written by Jessica Bendinger and Kate Kondell from a story by Bendinger and Jerry O&#x27;Connell, and produced by John Davis. The film languished in &quot;development hell&quot; for five years, finally being completed and released eight months after the similar &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot; (2004). The film was a commercial failure upon its release, and received primarily negative reviews.

==Plot==
Samantha MacKenzie is the only child of U.S. President John MacKenzie. Due to her father&#x27;s political career, she has been in the public eye her entire life and spent most of her high school years in the White House. Having to deal with a lack of privacy and public scrutiny for the most ridiculous things, Sam has had a sheltered existence and her father has trouble giving her more freedom yet is too busy to spend time with her.

Though her mother Melanie is supportive, she still stands by her husband&#x27;s decisions, leaving Sam feeling restricted from having a normal life. Accompanied by Secret Service agents everywhere she goes, and with her father running for re-election, Sam finally believes she has the chance to break out of her cocoon when she is allowed to attend college in California.

There, Sam ends up sharing a dorm room with boy-crazed Mia Thompson, who is hesitant at first to room with the first daughter, but eventually warms to her. After her Secret Service agents tackle a student brandishing a water gun at a pool party and hastily evacuate her from the premises, she insists that her detail be reduced to just two agents, to which her father begrudgingly agrees. Settling into some semblance of normalcy, she meets and becomes interested in fellow student James Lansome, her resident advisor.

James helps her avoid the paparazzi, escape her security team, and experience life as a normal girl. They discuss their deepest thoughts and wishes, and Sam tells him that although she is never alone, she is often lonely. Her dream has always been to drive an old Volkswagen off to college, with no babysitters or parents.

To thank James and Mia for their tolerance of her complicated world, Sam flies them home to D.C. to attend a ball, with the dresses delivered to her personally by Vera Wang. Outside the ball, a protest causes her security team to evacuate her again, when she discovers that James is actually an agent and has been protecting her all along.

Feeling heartbroken and betrayed, Sam tries to readjust to college life, but an attempt to make James jealous only results in her drunken photo splashed across tabloid articles. She returns home to help her father on the last stretch of his campaign, while James is disciplined for failure to act in a manner becoming of an agent. Sam asks her father to make sure James&#x27;s career is not ruined by their romance, to which he agrees.

The President wins re-election and dances with Sam at his inauguration ball, referencing something she told him in his speech and acknowledging she is now a grown woman and worthy of his respect. She is surprised and pleased to see that James is in attendance, having been reassigned to the presidential detail. They dance, and he gives her keys to an old Volkswagen (her dream car) and encourages her to go &quot;break some rules.&quot;

The film ends with Sam driving off in her car, heading back to college and the narrator telling us that she will be back in the spring, and reunite with James.

==Cast==

In addition, making cameo appearances as themselves, are Vera Wang, Joan Rivers, Melissa Rivers and Jay Leno. Opening and closing narration is provided by the film&#x27;s director, Forest Whitaker.

==Production==
The film began development in March 1999, when actor Jerry O&#x27;Connell sold a screenplay he had written to Regency Enterprises for a six-figure sum, with O&#x27;Connell also intending to star in the film. Originally to shoot in the summer of that year, the project was pushed back to the spring of 2000 (under the direction of Brian Robbins) to allow O&#x27;Connell to film &quot;Mission to Mars,&quot; and then Rob Thomas was hired to rewrite the script; O&#x27;Connell later received a &quot;story by&quot; credit for the film from the Writers Guild of America. For unknown reasons, the film was not produced at that time, though the film&#x27;s original producer, Mike Karz, did receive a producer credit on the final print of the film.

The filming began on June 2, 2003 on a budget of $30 million, and continued into July. The film was shot on location in Southern California. For the opening scene, where Samantha descends a red-carpeted stairway, the lobby of the Los Angeles Theatre in Los Angeles is used, while the auditorium of the building is used for a scene where Samantha and James go to see a movie. On-campus scenes were shot at UCLA, and the Huntington Library in San Marino stood in for the exterior of the building in the first scene.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received primarily negative reviews. 

Reviewer Mike McGranaghan pointed out that the film was very similar to that of the concurrently-made film &quot;Chasing Liberty,&quot; which coincidentally had the working title &quot;First Daughter,&quot; and which also involved a plot where the President&#x27;s daughter tried to experience life away from the White House.

Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a negative review and wrote it &quot;Plays more like a nightmare than a dream, and an exceedingly unnerving one at that. Sam isn&#x27;t just a prisoner of her parents&#x27; ambitions; like nearly everyone else in this film, she&#x27;s a zombie, sleepwalking through life while Rome burns.&quot; Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film, &quot;One hackneyed, inauthentic, predictable scene after another.&quot;

Writing for the Newhouse News Service, Stephen Whitty described the film as being &quot;crammed full of threadbare fairy-tale imagery&quot; and that &quot;the plot has as much energy as the old Gephardt campaign&quot;.

===Box office===
The film was a box-office bomb. Given a wide release on 2,260 screens, it opened in fifth place at the box office, but fell out of the Top 10 by its third weekend; it was reduced to fewer than 200 screens by its fifth week. Overall, &quot;First Daughter&quot; grossed $9.1million in the United States and Canada, and $1.5million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $10.6million, against a budget of $30million.

<text>The Norma Arm is a minor spiral arm of the Milky Way extending from and around its central hub region. The inner portion of the Arm is called the &quot;Norma Arm&quot; in narrow meaning. The outer end of it is identified either with the Cygnus Arm (not to be confused with local and minor Orion-Cygnus Arm), which lies outside the Perseus Arm, or the Outer Arm, which is located farther away from the center of the Galaxy than the Cygnus Arm. The Norma Arm begins from the Galactic Center, and extends outward to a radius of . It is named for the Norma constellation, through which the Arm as seen from Earth passes.

Like many other galaxies of similar type, the Milky Way consists of a large mass of stars shaped into the form of a relatively flat disc by gravity. The disc is rotating, with the dense central body of stars moving at greater speeds than those toward the rim of the disc. As a result, the pattern of stars within the Galaxy as viewed from directly above or below the disc has formed into a spiral.

Because of localised gravitational variations, the spiral pattern has itself formed several distinct &#x27;spiral arms&#x27;, where particularly large numbers of stars can be found.

<text>Olofström, previously Holje by, is a locality in Blekinge County, Sweden with 7,327 inhabitants in 2010.
in 1967, the market town of Olofström was merged with the villages Kyrkhult and Jämshög to create Olofström Municipality. Olofström is the seat of Olofström Municipality.
The increased use of cars in the 1950s and 1960s was the great boost for the municipality. Today the automobile industry, dominated by Volvo Cars, is the largest employer in Olofström.

== Geography ==
Immediately west of Olofström lies , a nature reserve covering of land and water, making it one of the largest protected areas in Blekinge. It was established in 1972 for its recreational value and it has since been expanded. It features hiking trails, rest areas, and accessibility-adapted facilities, including a trail around the small lake Blåsegylet. The lake Halen, which is partly included in the reserve, is popular for swimming and canoeing and is connected to a larger lake system. The area is also rich in biodiversity, with old-growth forests and habitats for a variety of bird species, including ospreys and loons.

Both the Skåneleden and hiking trails traverse the nature reserve and the surrounding nature, connecting Olofström to Kyrkhult in the north, Näsum and Sölvesborg to the south, and Osby to the west.

==Olofström Church== 
Olofström church (&quot;Olofströms kyrka&quot;) belongs to Jämshög&#x27;s parish in the Diocese of Lund. The original building is a chapel built in 1933. A rebuild was completed in 1962 under the guidance of architects Hanna and Roy Victorson in Karlshamn. The entrance hall and the parish hall&#x27;s northwest wing were built in 1986 under the direction of architectural firm K.E. Dudzik.
==Education==
The gymnasium, Nordenbergsskolan, accommodates one of the few orienteering schools in Sweden, as well as the only archery school in Sweden.

==Sports==

Olofström is home to football club , floorball club Olofströms IBK and ice hockey club Olofströms IK.

<text>Karlskrona (, , ) is a locality and the seat of Karlskrona Municipality, Blekinge County, Sweden with a population of 66,675 in 2018. It is also the capital of Blekinge County. Karlskrona is known as Sweden&#x27;s only baroque city and is host to Sweden&#x27;s largest naval base and the headquarters of the Swedish Coast Guard.

Historically, the city has been home to a German minority, thus enabling the formation of a German Congregational church. It also counted Jewish people in its population.

In 1998, parts of the city, including the Karlskrona Naval Base, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==

Under Danish rule, the island on which Karlskrona was built, Trossö, was used chiefly for farming and grazing. During the 16th century, it was owned by the farmer Offe Månsson. A couple of kilometers away on the mainland there was another, older town called &quot;Lyckeby&quot; or &quot;Lyckå&quot; (today a city district of Karlskrona). In 1599, King Christian IV of Denmark founded a new town, Kristianopel, a little further away. Lyckeby lost its town privileges which were transferred to the new town, and Lyckeby Castle was torn down.

At the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 during the Second Northern War, Blekinge fell under Swedish rule. In the subsequent years, the Swedish government developed plans to relocate most of the Royal Swedish Navy from the Stockholm area to a more southerly location. At the time Sweden was the dominant military power in the Baltic Sea region, but needed a better strategic location for its navy, as the Swedish fleet tended to get stuck in the ice during winter while located close to Stockholm. It was therefore decided to move it to an ice-free location in the newly conquered province, which also offered a very strategic position against Denmark, and with short sailing distances to Sweden&#x27;s German and Baltic provinces.
It was decided to base most of the kingdom&#x27;s fleet on Trossö where a new naval base and city was to be constructed. The location was strategically advantageous on an island in the archipelago with control over the link to the mainland and surrounded by islets where fortifications were erected to protect the naval base. Until 1679, the island and the nearby islets were owned by the farmer Vittus Andersson; he was now forced to sell his properties to the Swedish crown. The same year work on relocating the navy from the Stockholm area to Trossö begun.

The city itself was founded on 10 August 1680. The city&#x27;s name means &quot;Karl&#x27;s Crown&quot; in honour of King Karl XI of Sweden, the name being inspired by the name of the older city of Landskrona in Scania. The nearby town of Ronneby was dissolved as a town and its population forced to move to Karlskrona which benefited from several years of customs freedom. Shipbuilders for the shipyards of the new naval base were brought in from Ostrobothnia and Stockholm.

In 1682, bridges were built that connected the city center with the mainland. The first city plan, drawn up in 1683 by Erik Dahlbergh, Hans Wachtmeister and Carl Magnus Stuart, shows Karlskrona as a pure fortress. The 1694 plan by Erik Dahlberg, which was later followed, also provided space for urban development. The city grew quickly and by 1750 Karlskrona had about 10,000 inhabitants. It was then one of the biggest cities in the country and soon became the kingdom&#x27;s third largest city, after Riga and Stockholm. Most of the baroque buildings from this era are still standing, which is why the city centre is architecturally uniform.

The shipyard in Karlskrona was established almost at the same time as the city. It was a necessity because of the heavy losses the Swedish navy had suffered in 1659. In 1711, the shipyard was Sweden&#x27;s largest industrial employer with 1,100 workers. The oldest dock, the Polhem dock, is cut in the cliff itself and is still in use. It got its name from Christopher Polhem (&quot;The Swedish da Vinci&quot;, a scientist with several inventions still in use). There is also a historical rope making factory, Repslagarbanan.

Karlskrona developed rapidly, but in the early 18th century stagnation occurred due to war and plagues. 1701 — 1711 died about 7,000 people when the plague struck the city. In 1741 and 1789, the city was again hit by plagues, each claiming 6,000 lives.

When Karlskrona, as a military-closed port city, slowly withered away in step with the Swedish great power, the growth slowed, with the city losing much of its former glory, but it has nevertheless retained its position as a strong naval base. That Karlskrona was intended as a future capital of a great power is noticeable mainly in its central parts where Stortorget follows the ideals of the time for what Europe&#x27;s great power cities would look like. With its large open piazza where the church, town hall and state administration are located in the outer edges of the square, it follows the baroque pattern. The number of churches and state administration castles also shows the city&#x27;s intended task. The large military area and the shipyard show that Karlskrona, as the kingdom&#x27;s southern gate, was long considered a very important city to defend. Even today, operations are conducted at Karlskronavarvet. Karlskrona was thus intended to take over Stockholm&#x27;s place as the kingdom&#x27;s capital, but these plans were never realized.

During the years 1910 — 1949, there was electric tram traffic from Amiralitetsgatan in the south to Bergåsa in the north.

The city has kept its street structure since its foundation. Since the streets all follow a grid pattern the winds can blow freely from the sea right into the heart of the city.

Parts of the city (mainly the Naval Port) have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In October 1981 the Whiskey-class Soviet submarine &quot;S-363&quot; (known as &quot;U137&quot; in Sweden) ran aground in the archipelago near Sturkö just outside Karlskrona. The media characterized it as the &quot;Whiskey on the Rocks&quot; affair. The incident caused a temporary rise in tensions between Sweden and the Soviet Union. While the submarine&#x27;s grounding was inadvertent, and likely the result of inebriation among the crew, the submarine almost certainly was engaged in an unspecified covert mission at the time.

==Geography==
The city of Karlskrona is spread over 30 islands in the eastern part of Blekinge archipelago, Trossö being the main one. Other populated mentionable islands are Saltö, Sturkö, Hästö, Långö and Aspö. The islet of Stumholmen was formerly property of the Navy and today it houses the National Naval Museum (Marinmuseum). Outside the city lies the archipelago of Karlskrona, the most southern of the Swedish archipelagos. Several islands are connected to the city by ferries.

=== Climate ===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Karlskrona has a four season warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;). Barely fulfilling the precipitation criteria, the climate can best be classified as a hybrid between Oceanic and Cold semi-arid (Cfb/BSk) with dry-spring/early-summers and wet winters.

Due to its location in the rain shadow of the South Swedish highlands, Karlskrona has one of the driest and sunniest climates in all of Sweden. Only rivaled by island locales. The precipitation pattern of a drying summer, can easily be found elsewhere in North American locales such as Skagway, Soldotna or even inland Flagstaff. In comparison with other well-known warm-summer Mediterranean areas such as the Pacific Northwest or Northwestern Iberia, Karlskrona has a relatively dry climate with annual sunshine hours matching – or even exceeding – famous cities such as Seattle or A Coruña. Tourists often flock to the city during summer for guaranteed summer sunshine. Summer sunshine-values is in direct competition with traditionally Mediterranean cities such as Rome, Nice, Lisbon or even Madrid. Humidity however, remains high throughout the entire year, partly due to the constant winds blowing in from the sea. Long lasting snow cover is uncommon. Snow usually melts within the first few days of falling.

Thanks to its coastal position on the south coast of Sweden right by the Baltic Sea, Karlskrona experiences relatively speaking mild weather year round with a strong seasonal lag. Spring begins during March and is often accompanied by a sunny and drying weather. Drought-like conditions is not unheard of. For instance did March 2022 experience as little as 1mm of rain. This precipitation pattern continues well into early-summer passing through April where precipitation generally reaches its minimum. Summer days are often gloriously sunny affairs and starts during May and extends into September with daytime highs pleasantly hovering around 20°C. Around the summer solstice, westerly winds begin picking up resulting in sporadic rain-showers lasting throughout summer. In accordance with Karlskrona’s poleward location, day time hours quickly dwindle during October resulting in grey overcast skies lasting until the end of February. Even so, autumn is often mild with temperatures significantly warmer than further inland. This mild weather often extends well into the winter months with December lows exceeding freezing. January and February is often coldest time of the year with plenty of precipitation and chilly damp winds. Thanks to mild winter temperatures, Karlskrona lies gardening-zone 1. According to the USDA hardiness zones in zone 8b (9a 2010-present). However, lack of summer heat creates unfavorable environments for heat-demanding plants. A pattern seen across large areas of Northwestern Europe. 



==Culture and heritages==
The most important day in Karlskrona is the day before midsummer&#x27;s eve. On that day a big fair takes place and attracts tens of thousands to visit Karlskrona. The fair is called &quot;Lövmarknaden&quot; (The Leaf Fair) and is very popular among the locals.

The main square of Karlskrona is the biggest in Scandinavia.

Every year in late July/early August a popular festival called &quot;The Sail&quot; takes place in the harbor of Karlskrona. Usually it is a place where families go to have something to eat and drink, and perhaps watch the sailing boats lined up at the pier. During the sail, the sea scouts of Karlskrona will row a boat carrying torches along the docks while playing the national anthems for the visiting ships.

Lately The Sail has been replaced with a festival called Skärgårdsfest.

The old architecture together with the naval installations comprise the major tourist attractions of Karlskrona. The city has a pleasant atmosphere and is one of the highlights of south-east Sweden.
=== Architectural Heritage ===
Karlskrona has preserved its buildings and its layout virtually intact since its foundation.

When the city was founded in 1680, it was primarily thought of as a military city, with many defenses and fortifications exploiting the particular topography of the city. Some fortifications were located on the main island (Trossö) such as the Bastion Aurora, built at the beginning of the 18th century, but much of it was located on the nearby islands (Ljungskär, Mjölnareholmen, Godnatt, Koholmen and Kurrholmen) or more distant, such as the islands closing the bay, with in particular the important fortress of Kungsholmen and its circular port.

But the civil part of the city was also carefully planned. It has a rectangular grid plan, with however some diagonal streets, created because of the relief of the city center. Nicodème Tessin l&#x27;Ancien was responsible for the design of the buildings, and he gave the city a very uniform baroque style.

The central building of the city is the Fredrikskyrkan church, built in the 1690s, On the main square, which is also the highest point of the island. Several other churches are located in the city, such as the Church of the Holy Trinity, built for the Germans of the city in 1709, or the Amiralitetskyrkan, consecrated in 1685

In front of the Amiralitetskyrkan church is the statue of Rosenbom, made famous by the children&#x27;s book of Selma Lagerlöf, &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Nils&quot;, in which the statue tells the story of the church. The man is seen holding some text in Swedish. The English translation of that text is &quot;I humbly beg of you, even though my voice may be weak, come and put a penny in but first lift my hat. Blessed are those that care for the poor.&quot; (The last sentence being adapted from the Bible.) Nearby, there is paper with the translation of that text, the translated languages are English, German, Polish, Danish, Norwegian, and Finnish. The English translation is written by Gorge Hopkins. Near the church is also the Admiralstorn Tower, dating from 1699, originally used to indicate the time for the shipyard workers but used since 1909 as the church tower

Finally, the city has some more recent buildings, such as the model room, having hosted between 1780 and 1920 models of boats, Now transferred to the Marine Museum, or the town hall built after the fire of 1790. Finally, the county residence (Länsresidenset) built between 1909 and 1911.

=== Museums ===

The most visited museum of the city is the Naval Museum, with around 250,000 visitors a year. About half of those visitors are Swedish, the other half from other countries. The Naval Museum is Sweden&#x27;s national museum for the history of the Swedish Navy. Along with exhibitions, the museum contains object collections, a drawings archive, photographic archive and a library. The museum is also involved in research.

The present museum building on Stumholmen in Karlskrona was opened in 1997 by the present king Carl XVI Gustaf. Before that the museum lay in the former cadet barracks in the naval harbour, Örlogshamnen, and until 1963 was known as the Shipyard Museum (Varvsmuseet).

The museum is based on the &quot;model room&quot; created in 1752 by King Adolf Frederick of Sweden, in which several boat models were stored in order to test different types of structures. Nowadays, these models still form the core of the museum&#x27;s collection, but the museum also traces the history of the Royal Swedish Navy.

The city is also home to the Blekinge Museum, with visitors in 2008.

==Economy==
Some of the biggest employers in Karlskrona are Telenor Sverige, Ericsson, NKT A/S and Roxtec. The city has an overall strong presence in information technology based industries.

==Transport==
The city is positioned at the south east corner of Sweden with excellent connections to the other side of the Baltic Sea. There is a ferry line to Gdynia in Poland transporting both goods and passengers provided by the ferry operator Stena Line.

Most of the islands of Karlskrona are connected by roads. One of the bigger populated Islands Aspö is connected with a small road ferry. Boats also travel between the archipelago&#x27;s various islands during the summer months.
=== Truck transport===
The city is close to the European Highway 22, connected by a small section of highway, part of the national road 28. The E22 connects the main cities of southern Sweden such as Malmö, Lund, Kristianstad, then climbs along the east coast towards Kalmar and Norrköping. The national road 28 connects the Karlstad to Emmaboda.

=== Rail transport ===
The city being one of the most important in Sweden, with in particular a large shipyard, the need for railway was great. The city received its first railway line in 1874, connecting it to Växjö, which itself was connected since 1865 to the main line Södra stambanan. The line then came to the north of the city center of Karlskrona. The shipyard, further south, was connected in 1888, thanks to an underground line of 2 km, but the line closed in 1990. This line is now part of the Kust till Kust banan, linking Göteborg and Kalmar. The town received a new railway line in 1889 when the future Blekinge kustbana, linking Kristianstad to Karlskrona, was built.

=== Maritime transport ===
There is a regular ferry service from Karlskrona to Gdynia in Poland, operated by Stena Line, with an average of two return trips per day. This line carries nearly 500,000 people a year. The port of Karlskrona also serves the archipelago of Blekinge.

=== Air transport ===
The nearest airport to the city is Ronneby Airport, near Ronneby, with scheduled flights to Stockholm (Bromma and Arlanda). 191,168 people transited through this airport in 2009.

==Religion==

There are three important churches in Karlskrona. Fredrikskyrkan (The Frederick church) was designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, who was influenced by Italian architecture. The foundation of that church was laid in 1720, and it was inaugurated in 1744. It differs from usual Swedish churches in its orange color, adornment and its two towers despite not being a bishop&#x27;s church.

Trefaldighetskyrkan (Church of Holy Trinity), also called &quot;The German Church&quot;, was built between 1697 and 1709, following Tessin&#x27;s drawings. It is likewise located at the market square in the centre core. The dome-shaped roof also takes its influence from Italian architecture and is rarely seen on Swedish churches.

Karlskrona Admiralty Church (Amiralitetskyrkan) was built in 1685 in red-painted wood and is one of Sweden&#x27;s largest wooden churches. Outside the church there is a well-known statue called Rosenbom.

<text>Sölvesborg is a locality and the seat of Sölvesborg Municipality in Blekinge County, Sweden with 10,024 inhabitants in 2013.

Sölvesborg is, despite its small population, for historical reasons normally still referred to as a &quot;city&quot;. Statistics Sweden, however, only counts localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants as cities.

==History of the city==

As the water from the Baltic Ice Lake withdrew, the land around present-day Sölvesborg became accessible to settlers from what today is Denmark. The first people to settle were farmers; remains of their presence have been found in the area dating back to the Stone Age, mostly in the area around Gammalstorp, Siretorp and Istaby. The hill in the east, marking the border towards Karlshamn called Ryssberget, was a direct creation of the glacial movements. On the western side of the hill, the different times of ice withdrawal are clearly noticeable. The old, now drained lake of Vesan was also a product of the ice age.

The port town of Sölvesborg was founded in the 12th century, between the mountain Ryssberget and the bay to the east (Sölvesborgsviken), but the city itself has grown up around the church, the monastery and later on the castle. The oldest part of the church of Saint Nicholas is from the 12th century. In the 14th century, the church formed part of a Carmelite convent. In 1564 Sölvesborg took over the city charter of Elleholm.

At about the same time as the church was built, the castle took shape. The oldest part are slightly younger than the church, and although the earliest days are not well documented, it is supposed that it was originally merely a fortress. The castle came to be extended - both its height as well as the area it covered during the years.

The city was granted its charter in 1445 by the Scandinavian king Christopher of Bavaria.

The history of Sölvesborg is marked by its location on the main road connecting the then Danish districts of Skåne and Blekinge, therefore a fortress was built as Sölvesborg was the main city in the province of Sölvesborg (called Sölvesborgs län).

The origin of the name Sölvesborg is unclear, but is believed to come from the founder of the castle, Sölfwitz or Sölvitz. The name thus means the castle (Borg) of Sölfwitz. Others claim that the mentioned Sölve might be the Norse Viking King Sölve or Salve. Sølv means silver in Danish.

During the Middle Ages and well into the 16th century, Sölvesborg marked a strategic city in the west, together with the easternmost city - Kristianopel. During its heyday, the city came to host many of the ruling Danes when they came to visit the town. One notable character to inherit the Sölvesborg castle, was Sören Norby, which he was granted after his leaving Sweden, as he had fallen out of favour with the Swedish king, Gustav Vasa.
With the Danish king Christian IV, change came to be. The old town west to Sölvesborg, Vä, was burnt down during the wars with Sweden and Christian wanted to replace it with a new one – Christianstad (the city of Christian). In order to accomplish this, the trade privileges for Vä and Sölvesborg were withdrawn and given to Kristianstad. The city thus became less important and subsequently fell behind. Some minor production, such as a Faience factory between 1773 and 1798 made no major impressions.

The castle was abandoned after the Danish defeat to the Swedes at the battle of Knäred in 1637. Rather than letting the Swedes seize the castle, the foreman of the castle decided that it should be burnt. Today, nothing but ruins remain, but the old castle in Bäckaskog is of the same age and of similar construction.

The now defunct city privileges were not restored until in 1841, by the Swedish king Carl XIV.

==Industries==
In the 18th century, a porcelain factory was established in 1773 by Baron Erik Gabriel Sparre. The porcelain produced here is referred to as faience, and the production was spread around Sweden. The factory remained for only a few decades and production was cancelled in 1790. In 1901, a glass factory was established. In order to provide the factory with sand, a train line was built after a private initiative, to Olofström and Älmhult. The glass factory closed in 1982. 
A shipping dock was opened in 1892 and remained in the city until 1982.

Today, little of the old, traditional industries remain. Instead, the city relies on work commuters and small scale industries, as well as tourism. Outside the city, the fishing industry, especially in the harbour towns of Djupekås, Hällevik and Nogersund are important employers. In Norje a chicken production is in place as an important local industry. Also the neighbouring paper mills of Mörrum (Södra Cell) and Nymölla are notable.

==Transport and connections==
Sölvesborg got its first railroad connections in the late 19th century, firstly to Karlshamn and Kristianstad and later on extended to Karlskrona in the east. This today is the only remaining railroad connection and is now connecting Karlskrona in the east with Malmö and Copenhagen in the west.

In 1910 the railroad connections were extended to Listerlandet, the countryside surrounding Sölvesborg and connecting the town to the neighbouring municipality of Mjällby and ending in Hörvik. This railroad continued to run up until the 1950s.

Private investments saw to it that a new railroad was built between Sölvesborg and Älmhult (city of IKEA) (the Sölvesborg-Olofström-Elmhult-Järnväg and on this route the first and longest natural tunnel, and also the only railway tunnel in Scania, came to place of its time near Barnakälla. Today, only half of the railroad remains and only industrial traffic between Olofström and Älmhult.

The major road connection is the E22 (E66 up until 1994). Between 1993 and 1999 Sölvesborg and Wolgast in Germany had hover boat traffic during the summer months (May to August).


Sölvesborg still retains its picturesque street structure, unlike many other Swedish cities. Even after a near total fire in 1801, when the entire city except the church burnt down, it was decided to retain it instead of adapting a grid pattern.

==Sights==
Apart from the aforementioned Ryssberget, the countryside villages outside of Sölvesborg are very scenic. In July, the village of Krokås hosts the day of eel fishing (&quot;Ålafiskets dag&quot;).

In central Sölvesborg, the twin hills of &quot;Kanehall&quot; and &quot;Vitehall&quot;, which up until the 18th century were magnificent lookout points, are still worth a visit as they are located in the beech tree forest, one of Europe&#x27;s largest coherent beech tree forest. Today, visitors need to go further upp &quot;Ryssberget&quot; to get the same view, as the trees have grown tall. Before reaching &quot;Kanehall&quot; and &quot;Vitehall&quot;, the houses on &quot;Norregatan&quot; should be passed. These houses reflect the old town and was, when the houses were built, an outskirt of the town referred to as the &quot;Fattigstaden&quot; or The Poor people&#x27;s town. The town centre itself is a good example of the medieval town planning of Swedish and Danish towns.

Other notable visits include the Nicolai Church, whose oldest part stem from the 12th century and the runestones in and outside the church. The best preserved runestone is the stone located inside the church. The Museum and Gallery, located in the harbour in old warehouses are worth a visit. The museum reflects the history of the city, from the early settlements to the early 20th Century. The Gallery shows local artists mainly.

In 1985, SR International - Radio Sweden established a powerful medium-wave radio transmission facility at Sölvesborg. Broadcasting international programming to a large area of Europe, its twin antenna towers, located some from the town of Sölvesborg itself, are notable local landmarks.

During the summer period, a visit to one of the many beaches is well worth. Notable beaches are Sandviken, Tredenborg and Hällevik.

Sölvesborg is the start of the Skåneleden&#x27;s SL1 trail and its oldest section. The trail leads hikers from the town center up onto Ryssberget, where they can experience the tranquility of old-growth beech forests and panoramic views of Listerlandet.

<text>In printing and typography, hot metal typesetting (also called mechanical typesetting, hot lead typesetting, hot metal, and hot type) is a technology for typesetting text in letterpress printing. This method injects molten type metal into a mold that has the shape of one or more glyphs. The resulting sorts or slugs are later used to press ink onto paper. Normally the typecasting machine would be controlled by a keyboard or by a paper tape.

It was the standard technology used for mass-market printing from the late nineteenth century until the arrival of phototypesetting and then electronic processes in the 1950s to 1980s.

==History==
Hot metal typesetting was developed in the late nineteenth century as a development of conventional cast metal type. The technology had several advantages: it reduced labour since type sorts did not need to be slotted into position manually, and each casting created crisp new type for each printing job. In the case of Linotype machines, each line was cast as a robust continuous block (hence &quot;line o&#x27;type&quot;) which was useful for rapid newspaper printing.

== Types of typesetting ==
Two different approaches to mechanising typesetting were independently developed in the late 19th century. One, known as the Monotype composition caster system, produced texts with the aid of perforated paper-ribbons. Each character was cast separately. These machines could produce texts also in &quot;large-composition&quot; up to 24 point.

The Super-caster, another machine produced by Monotype, was similar in function to the Thompson, Barth, pivotal and others casters but designed to produce single type (including even larger sizes) for hand setting.

The other approach was to cast complete lines as one slug, usually comprising a whole line of text.

Of this system there were at least five manufacturers:

* Linotype
* Intertype Corporation
* the Typograph, produced in Germany
* Ludlow Typograph
* The Monoline, a very basic machine

The Linotype and similar Intertype machines came out with paper tape and electronic automation near the end of their lifecycles, which allowed for the news wire services to send breaking news to remote newspaper offices for prompt setting into late editions.

While the other machines were operated by (non-QWERTY) keyboards, in the Ludlow Typograph the matrices for each line were assembled in a stick by hand. This machine was able to cast display body sizes that other mechanical composition systems were unable to produce. In this way headings could be produced to complement text produced on other machines. It also used the same alloy as Linotype machines, so was a useful adjunct to page makeup for newspapers as, when a print run was completed, all the metal could be remelted at once, without having to be separated or the type from the headings redistributed back into case.

The success of these machines lay in different fields. The Monotype caster was more popular for bookwork that required the ability to make manual corrections and edits while the slug casting systems found success in newspaper production, where speed of production and &#x27;make ready&#x27; for print was essential.

Another essential difference between Monotype and the &quot;slug&quot;-producing machines is that a Monotype machine functions with a minimal set of matrices. Each character needs one matrix. Linecasters cannot function this way, and these systems need quite large magazines of matrices to be able to set a complete line of text with the usual character repetitions. Indeed, the nominal 90-channel magazine of a linecaster really has 91 total channels, with the first two channels allocated to the lower case &#x27;e&#x27;, and with these matrices being alternately selected from channel 0 or channel 1, for alternate lines of cast type.

Additionally, Monotype &quot;must&quot; use a punched paper tape, and the &quot;reading frame&quot; is always backwards (right-to-left) in order to achieve justification, as justification is not an inherent capability of the machine (however, &quot;flush left&quot; &quot;is&quot; an inherent capability). Whereas Linotype &quot;may&quot; use a punched paper tape, although this option is seldom-used outside of daily newspapers, and whether a tape is used, or not, the &quot;reading frame&quot; is always forwards (left-to-right), with justification being an inherent capability of the machine (and, &quot;flush right&quot;, &quot;centered&quot; and &quot;flush left&quot; may be very easily accommodated manually, or automatically using a &quot;quadder&quot; attachment).

=== Linotype ===

The key feature of the Linotype is the use of molds which circulate through the machine in its various stages of operation. One type is a space band (a special two-part sliding wedge) and the other is a letter matrix made of brass. The matrices are stored in one or more magazines on top of the machine (providing the operator with a choice of fonts; these can also be exchanged with other extra magazines as desired) while the space bands are stored in a box closer to the keyboard.

Once a key is pressed, the matrix passes through what is known as the ‘assembler front’, down past a rotating fiber reinforced wheel (known as the star wheel) and into the ‘assembling elevator’ which serves the same purpose as the hand compositor&#x27;s stick. When the space band key near the keyboard is pressed, one of the space bands drops out of the box and almost directly into the assembling elevator. The assembling elevator (or more commonly just the ‘assembler’) is adjustable for different lengths of line (in picas).

Once the line approaches its correct length, the operator is made aware of this by a bell or other indicator. If the line is ‘loose’ or too short, there is too much ‘white space’ for the space band wedges to fill out the line, and the matrices could possibly turn sidewise or fail to seal against each other as the machine prepares for the casting operation. If the line is ‘tight’ or too long, the elevator carrying the matrices and space bands will not seat properly in front of the mold slot. Both the Linotype and Intertype machines have two important safeties that act during the casting operation – the ‘pump stop’, which comes into play on loose lines, and the ‘vise automatic&#x27;, which comes into play on tight lines. Both scenarios, if not stopped by these safety features, usually result in a “squirt” of molten type metal, encasing the matrices and the elevator in metal in the process. Not only is it time-consuming to clean up after a squirt, a tight line usually has not come down far enough to mate with the slots on the mold face, resulting in damage to the matrices. Therefore, it is considered very poor form for an operator (or the machinist who cared for the machine) to permit this to happen.

When the line is assembled to the correct length, the operator presses down on a lever which raises the assembling elevator up into the delivery channel and starts the automatic casting cycle. The delivery channel transfers the matrices out of the assembler and into the first elevator. The first elevator then descends to a position in front of the mold, and if the elevator has not descended fully by the time the machine starts the process of aligning the matrices (most often caused by a ‘tight’ line), the first of the two safeties, the vise automatic, brings the machine to a full stop before the supporting lugs on the matrices are crushed by the mold. Once the matrices are in proper position, two actions take place in sequence: the matrices are aligned vertically and face-wise while a bar rises from below to force the movable sleeves on the space bands upwards to cause them to fill out the line to the exact width of the mold. If the justification bar has made a full cycle and the line is still not fully justified, the second safety, the pump stop, prevents the plunger in the metal pot from going down. The space bands were an important feature of this machine, providing automatic justification of each line by equally adjusting the white space between each word. Since the type used was proportional and not fixed in width, solving this justification problem mechanically was very important. Some later models had a feature that permitted the lines to be cast with the alignment to either left, right or centered. Operators running earlier models would use special ‘blank’ matrices (in four sizes) to manually create the proper amount of whitespace beyond the space bands’ range.

With the matrices aligned and the space bands set to the correct measure, the machine then ‘locks up’ the line with great force and the plunger injects the molten type metal into the space created by the mold cavity and the assembled line. The machine then separates the mold disk (carrying the freshly cast slug), the metal pot, and the first elevator. The mold disk then turns to present the line at the ejecting position, in the process passing by a knife that trims the base of the slug to type height (0.918″ on US machines). The slug is then forced through an adjustable pair of knives to trim the slug to the proper body height before sliding down into a ‘galley’ of finished lines next to the operator. Depending on the model of machine, the mold disk could have four (standard), six, or two molds, giving the operator his choice of line lengths and body sizes.

As the mold disk is turning, the first elevator simultaneously rises to its upper position and the space bands and matrices are vertically aligned in preparation for the second transfer. The matrices have a series of teeth in a V-shaped notch on top, and as the transfer is completed, the matrices slide onto the second elevator bar which carries the matrices by these V-shaped notches. The space bands, having no such notches, remain in the second transfer channel and are soon gathered by two levers and pushed back into the space band box. While the space bands are being pushed into their box, the second elevator continues rising towards the distributing mechanism at the top of the machine, which returns the molds to their proper places in the magazine. At the top of the machine, a lever (the distributor shifter) moves left to get in position to push the incoming line of matrices off the second elevator and into the distributor box. This mechanism feeds the matrices at precise intervals such that they travel between three rotating screws. Each matrix is carried along a notched bar between the three screws until the notches on the bar and matrix match, whereupon the matrix drops down into its proper channel in the magazine.

It was a source of pride for trained operators to boast of being able to ‘hang’ a line – to keep a line waiting in the delivery channel while the machine was casting the previous line and the operator was composing the next one.

The metal pot was kept filled by the operator tossing in small ingots of type metal every few lines, or later, by mechanical feeders that carry large ingots of type metal (and which often carried two ‘pigs’ at a time to be consumed in turn, the operator hanging a fresh one when one was consumed). These feeders are actuated by various methods (by cam, either elevator, or distributor shifter), but the result is the same – the ingots are fed little by little into the pot, keeping it filled to the correct level.

From time to time, the slug galley is transferred to the composing table to be set in the form, and once the press run is completed and the slugs removed from the form, they are tossed into the ‘hell box’ for remelting into new ingots. At intervals the lead is remelted and the oxidized metal (dross) skimmed off. As part of this process, ‘plus metal’ is added in the form of small ingots to replenish that portion of the alloyed metals that was lost by the formation of dross (by oxidization of the metal in the machine&#x27;s pot or during the remelting stage). The type metal is poured into ingot molds – small molds for manually feeding the metal pots or larger molds for the metal feeders. (In the latter case, special attention must be given the ‘eye’ end as it has to support the weight of the entire ingot. Failure often results in it dropping into the pot and splashing molten metal everywhere.)

Funded largely by the Ridder newspaper interests, the Intertype Corporation developed ( 1914) a compatible version of the Linotype machine when the patents ran out and it became quite popular as well. This led to a long-lasting legal fight by the Mergenthaler Linotype Company (who eventually lost).

Various methods were used to power the Linotype / Intertype machines, the most common being a fractional horsepower motor, one wired for single-phase 60 Hz alternating current eventually becoming the default offering. To accommodate the customers&#x27; requirements, motors were also built to be powered from direct current, 25 Hz AC, or 50 Hz AC circuits. Also, motors wound for various polyphase circuits (two-phase, 3-phase, wye, delta, etc.) were made available for the customers as well. In a few cases, where electricity was not available, it was possible to drive the machine by a belt connected to a line shaft.

Initially, the metal pot was heated by gas (whether natural or &#x27;manufactured&#x27;), but an electric pot was later developed and which became a standard option. As with the motors, the control machinery for the metal pot heaters was produced in a variety of voltages and in direct or alternating current versions. For locations with access to neither gas or electricity, the gas-fired pot could be fitted with a burner kit to allow the use of kerosene or other &#x27;white gas&#x27; fuels.

Thus, regardless of the power sources available (within reason), it was possible to install a Linotype (or Intertype) machine in almost any newspaper office, whether in a remote mountain community or a downtown office in an urban metropolis.

=== Typograph and Monoline ===
These machines were bought out by Linotype, to minimize competition.

=== Ludlow ===
A manual linecasting solution known as the Ludlow Typograph also met with success because it was able to cast display type sizes that other mechanical composition systems were unable to produce.

The Ludlow consisted of a very heavy metal table with a flat top about waist high and a depressed slot into which a &quot;stick&quot; was inserted. Underneath was a pot of molten type metal and a plunger. The stick was used to hand compose the lines of type, typically headlines in 18 point or larger with 72 point commonly being available, but the machine could cast type from 4pt to 600pt without a mould change. This was from brass matrix stored in cases on either side of the Ludlow. The cases were not the traditional &quot;California Job Cases&quot; used to set body type, but simpler alphabetically arranged wooden or metal cases, each one containing a given font in a specific size and style such as bold face, italic or condensed. The metal type cabinets were built with inclined drawers for easy access to the matrices.

After a line of type was assembled into the stick a special blocking slug was inserted to seal the end. Then the stick was placed mold side down into the slot on the table, a clamp locked down to securely hold the stick and the Ludlow activated. The plunger would snap down into the pot with considerable force, injecting molten type metal into the mold at a high speed to ensure the mold was filled before the metal solidified. If the stick was not properly filled out or mounted firmly, or the special terminating block was forgotten, a dreaded &quot;splash&quot; would result, often encasing the operator&#x27;s toes in molten lead and leaving a mess that needed to be peeled off the Ludlow surfaces. Operators were encouraged to wear heavy boots with steel toes and be quick at removing one. It was also not uncommon for some of the type metal to be projected up onto the ceiling, no matter the height. As with the Linotype / Intertype machines, the Ludlow machines were often fitted with metal feeders to keep the pot filled to optimum level.

Towards the end of its life as a common backshop type setter, the Ludlow was often joined by the &quot;Super Surfacer&quot; a specially designed surface plane that would smooth the surface of the freshly cast type and ensure it was exactly type high. A Ludlow slug was just the letters overhanging a central spine about 12 points wide (T-shaped viewed from the end). It needed to be bolstered by Elrod slugs on either side for support. The number of slugs above and below the central spine could adjust the white space above and below the type making it a very flexible system for large type.

The Elrod was a machine used to cast rules and spacing material (leading) of a specific width: 1, , 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, or 36 point. This was used extensively in page layout and line spacing, that is, adjusting the white space between paragraphs and any other area when small bits of white space were needed. Large areas of white space were created by wooden or later metal blocks called &#x27;furniture&#x27;. Smaller odd areas were filled with square or rectangular blocks in various point sizes called quads.

All these line-casting machines used various alloys near the eutectic point and which typically consisted of approximately 4% tin and 12% antimony and the balance being lead. These alloys were proportioned such that the type metal would solidify as rapidly as possible at the lowest possible freezing point.

=== Monotype ===

The Monotype System took a different direction in hot metal typesetting, with the ability of the Composition Caster to cast loose type using a paper tape-operated automatic casting machine. The paper tape would be first generated on a keyboard and then used to cast the type; the tape could be stored for future casting for subsequent editions. This was a popular system for book work. Text was produced completely aligned, with all spaces in each line exactly the same width. Corrections and complex work could be done on the text by hand after the bulk of the text had been set by machine. The Super Caster and Orphan Annie were used to cast fonts of loose type for hand setting as well as spacing material and patterned rules.

This type was most times made of an alloy (8-10% tin, 15-20% antimony) slightly harder than the line casting alloys but was not as hard as the foundry type used for hand setting of loose letters. This allowed reasonable print runs or conversion to stereotypes for longer print runs. But these machines could produce type with all possible alloys, when needed.

The used type, like the slugs from line casters, was re-melted when no longer needed. Each time remelting caused some loss of tin and antimony, through oxidation. This loss needed to be monitored and compensated.

The Monotype Corporation survived the demise of the hot metal typesetting era by selling digital type.

== Transition ==
Towards the end of its life, hot metal composition in newspapers was kept alive by the proof press. As each page was set and locked up, it was moved on a turtle (a rolling table with an accurately flat steel surface) to the manual proof press, where it was hand inked and a single very high quality proof was pulled. This proof could then be photographed and converted to a negative.

Black paper was inserted before the proof was photographed for each of the photos on the final page to create clear windows in the negative. The separately made halftones would be taped into these clear windows on the negative. This negative could then be used to expose the photosensitized printing plate for an offset press. In this way the heavy investment in hot metal typesetting could be adapted to the newer offset technology during a transition period.

Another synergy and transition mechanism was using paper tapes made for TTS systems (linotype) and monotype tapes directly by the photo typesetter system.

These tapes could be read and processed by many, maybe most optical setting systems. This allows avoiding actual use of metal, while preserving some of the value and investment in the &quot;typesetting&quot; and communication side of hot metal. Such systems were widely used in the later years of hot metal, and optical typesetting systems kept supporting and further developing TTS standard, alongside similar systems for most of the optical typesetting era.

== Comparison to successors ==
The nature of text printed via the hot-metal method is notably different from that produced by the phototypesetting processes that followed it. As the lead type used to print (letterpress) a page had been directly formed from the type matrix, a good fidelity to the original was achieved. Phototypesetting suffered (at least in its early days) from many problems relating to optical distortion and misalignment. These disappointing results were a thorn in the sides of many authors and readers (especially of complex or mathematical texts that had many small sub- and superscripts). A desire to re-create the aesthetic qualities of hot lead spurred Donald Knuth to create one of the first general-purpose digital typesetting programs, TeX.

Although not technically typesetting, stereotyping (electrotype or nickeltype) could be used to cast a reproduction of an entire typeset page (or pages imposed in a ) using a mold made with an impression using &quot;flong&quot; (similar to papier-mâché). The ensuing casting could be made curved for use on a rotary press or flat for the slower flat-bed presses. This technique was often used in newspaper production.

<text>Castle Stalker () is a four-storey tower house or keep in the Scottish county of Argyll. It is set on a tidal islet on Loch Laich, an inlet off Loch Linnhe. It is about north-east of Port Appin and is visible from the A828 road about midway between Oban and Glen Coe. The islet is accessible with difficulty from the shore at low tide. The name &quot;Stalker&quot; comes from the Gaelic &quot;Stalcaire&quot;, meaning &quot;hunter&quot; or &quot;falconer&quot;. The island castle is one of the best preserved medieval tower houses to survive in western Scotland and is a Category A listed building. It stands in the Lynn of Lorn National Scenic Area.

==History==
The original castle was a small fort built around 1320 by Clan MacDougall, who were then Lords of Lorn. Around 1388 the Stewarts took over the Lordship of Lorn, and it is believed that they built the castle in its present form around the 1440s. The Stewarts&#x27; relative King James IV of Scotland visited the castle, and a drunken bet around 1620 resulted in the castle passing to Clan Campbell. After the castle changed hands between these clans a couple of times, the Campbells finally abandoned it about 1840 when it lost its roof. In 1908 the castle was bought by Charles Stewart of Achara, who carried out basic conservation work. In 1965 Lt. Col. D. R. Stewart Allward acquired the castle and over about ten years fully restored it. Castle Stalker remains in private ownership and is open to the public at selected times during the summer.

For the 2011 census the island on which the castle stands was classified by the National Records of Scotland as an inhabited island that &quot;had no usual residents at the time of either the 2001 or 2011 censuses.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Castle Stalker has been used as a location for the filming of multiple works including:
* &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (as &quot;The Castle Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh&quot;)
* &quot;Sense8&quot; (as the estate of the &quot;Old Man of Hoy&quot;)
* &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, &quot;Loch Henry&quot;

Castle Stalker is the inspiration for Castle Keep in the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Boggart&quot;.

<doc id="1018922" wikidata="Q383685" url="?curid=1018922" title="Johnston (typeface)">
<text>Johnston (or Johnston Sans) is a sans-serif typeface designed by and named after Edward Johnston. The typeface was commissioned in 1913 by Frank Pick, commercial manager of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (also known as &#x27;The Underground Group&#x27;), as part of his plan to strengthen the company&#x27;s corporate identity. Johnston was originally created for printing (with a planned height of 1 inch or 2.5 cm), but it rapidly became used for the enamel station signs of the Underground system as well.

It has been the corporate font of public transport in London since the foundation of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, and of predecessor companies since its introduction in 1916, making its use one of the world&#x27;s longest-lasting examples of corporate branding. It was a copyrighted property of the LPTB&#x27;s successor, Transport for London, until Public Domain Day 2015 (Johnston died in 1944).

Johnston&#x27;s work originated the genre of the humanist sans-serif typeface, typefaces that are sans-serif but take inspiration from traditional serif fonts and Roman inscriptions. His student Eric Gill, who worked on the development of the typeface, later used it as a model for his own Gill Sans, released from 1928. As a corporate font, Johnston was not available for public licensing until recently, and as such Gill Sans has become more widely used.

==Features==
The capitals of the typeface are based on Roman square capitals such as those on the Column of Trajan, and the lower-case on traditional serif fonts. Johnston greatly admired Roman capitals, writing that they &quot;held the supreme place among letters for readableness and beauty. They are the best forms for the grandest and most important inscriptions.&quot; Justin Howes, author of the leading work on the Johnston Sans design, &quot;Johnston&#x27;s Underground Type&quot;, has highlighted the similarity of the design to the eighteenth-century Caslon type designed by William Caslon in particular, noting that Johnston had worked on a book printed using this typeface shortly before starting work on his design and reproduced their structure in a textbook.

Johnston&#x27;s alphabet marked a break with the kinds of sans serif then popular, now normally known as grotesques, which tended to have squarer shapes inspired by signwriting and Didone type of the period. Some aspects of the alphabet are geometric: the letter O is a nearly perfect circle and the &#x27;M&#x27;, unlike Roman capitals (but like Caslon) straight-sided. As with most serif fonts, the &#x27;g&#x27; is a &#x27;two-storey&#x27; design. The &#x27;l&#x27; copies the curl of the &#x27;t&#x27; and produces a rather wide letter compared to most sans-serif fonts. The lower case i and j have diagonally-placed square dots or tittles, a motif that in some digitisations is repeated in the full stop, commas, apostrophes and other punctuation marks.

Johnston&#x27;s design process considered a variety of eccentricities, such as a capital-form &#x27;q&#x27; in the lower-case and a single-storey &#x27;a&#x27; like that later seen on Futura, before ultimately discarding them in favour of a clean, simplified design. However, many early versions of Johnston&#x27;s &quot;alphabet&quot; included a Garamond-style W formed of two crossed &#x27;V&#x27;s, and some early renderings as hand-lettering showed variation.

Unlike many sans-serifs of the period, Johnston&#x27;s design (while not slender) is not particularly bold. Gill would later write of his admiration for how Johnston had &quot;redeemed&quot; the sans-serif from its &quot;nineteenth-century corruption&quot; of extreme boldness.
As an alphabet intended for signage, Johnston was designed without any italics. Any italic design seen is therefore an invention of a later designer, intended to match Johnston&#x27;s design. Different designers have chosen different approaches to achieve this: some offering a &#x27;true&#x27; italic, others an oblique in which the letters are simply slanted, and some declining to offer one, perhaps concluding that an italic is inappropriate to the purpose of the original design. An official version of the typeface in italics was commissioned by London Transport from Berthold Wolpe in 1973.

==History==

Johnston had become interested in sans-serif letters some years before the commission: although best known as a calligrapher, he had written and worked also on custom lettering, and in his 1906 textbook &quot;Writing and Illuminating and Lettering&quot; had noted &quot;It is quite possible to make a beautiful and characteristic alphabet of equal-stroke letters, on the lines of the so-called &#x27;block letter&#x27; &quot;[the sans-serif letters of contemporary trade]&quot; but properly proportioned and finished.&quot; He had also written in spring 1913 that new books should &quot;bear some living mark of the time in which we live.&quot; Johnston had previously unsuccessfully attempted to enter type design, a trade which at the time normally made designs in-house. Howes wrote that Johnston&#x27;s font was &quot;the first typeface to have been designed for day-to-day use by a leading artist-craftsman.&quot;

Pick specified to Johnston that he wanted a typeface that would ensure that the Underground Group&#x27;s posters would not be mistaken for advertisements; it should have &quot;the bold simplicity of the authentic lettering of the finest periods&quot; and belong &quot;unmistakably to the twentieth century&quot;. Pick considered a sans-serif best suited to transport use, concluding that the Column of Trajan capitals were not suited to reproduction on flat surfaces.

In 1933, The Underground Group was absorbed by the London Passenger Transport Board and the typeface was adopted as part of the London Transport brand. As early as 1937, the LPTB mentioned it as a package promoting the system&#x27;s billboards to advertisers as an example of its commitment to stylish design, along with its commission of art from Feliks Topolski. Johnston&#x27;s drawings survive in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Johnston&#x27;s original design came with two weights, ordinary and bold, while condensed letters soon followed for use on buses to show routes and destinations. Heavy does not contain lower-case letters. Johnston also worked on other lettering and branding for the Underground system, most famously the &#x27;bar and circle&#x27; roundel that the Underground continues to use (refined from earlier designs where the roundel was solid red) .

The font family was called a variety of names in its early years, such as Underground or Johnston&#x27;s Railway Type, before later being generally called simply Johnston. (A similar problem exists with Gill Sans, which was at first often referred to by other names such as its order number, Series 238, Gill Sans-serif, or Monotype Sans-serif.)

===New Johnston===


Johnston was originally printed using wood type for large signs and metal type for print. London Transport often did not use Johnston for general small printing, with many documents such as bus timetables using other typefaces such as Gill Sans and Granby. By the 1970s, as cold type was becoming the norm for printing, Johnston had become difficult for printers to use. Signs and posters of the period started to use other, more easily sourced typefaces such as Helvetica, Univers and News Gothic. To maintain London Transport&#x27;s old corporate identity, Johnston was rendered into cold type.

Rather than simply producing a phototype of the original design, Johnston was redesigned in 1979 by Eiichi Kono at Banks &amp; Miles to produce New Johnston. The new family comes in eight members: Light, Medium, Bold weights with corresponding Italics, Medium Condensed and Bold Condensed (the old family had only two weights: Regular and Bold, and the latter had no lowercase letters). After all precisely hand-drawn letters (nearly 1,000) were completed and sent to AlphaType for digitisation in the US in 1981–82, New Johnston finally became ready for Linotron photo-typesetting machine, and first appeared in London&#x27;s Underground stations in 1983. It is the official typeface exclusively used by Transport for London and The Mayor of London ever since. 

The New Johnston Medium as the new standard is slightly heavier or bolder than the original Johnston Regular (or sometimes confusingly called Medium) and lighter than the original Bold, and has a larger x-height, made suitable for main text setting as well as large display sizes. The average x-height of the New Johnston is roughly 7% larger than the original as the limit for keeping the original Johnston flavour, which was fundamental. The larger x-height allowed larger counters, and type size (size of x-height in particular) and weight are reciprocal factors for legibility, but enlarging x-height can affect style and appearance. Since the original Johnston weights, Regular and Bold, were maintained as closely as possible, inevitably New Johnston Medium appears very close to Light and Bold. This is the whole point of this particular solution because New Johnston Medium works as the one-fits-all standard font for virtually every application from large type sizes for posters and signs to minute type sizes for pocket map maintaining much improved legibility. Punctuation marks are matched the diamond tittle, differing from Johnston&#x27;s original design, enhancing the identity of London Transport.

In 1990–1992 Banks and Miles, in partnership with Signus Limited digitised the first PostScript Type 1 fonts for the then London Transport under the auspices of the corporate design manager, Roger Hughes. Hughes and Jeremy Rewse-Davies, LT&#x27;s design director, also commissioned New Johnston Book, a special weight with distinctive modifications to allow better representation on low-resolution laser printers. The New Johnston Book weight was designed specifically for high volume publications and its usage was intended to be restricted to sizes below 12pt. In 2002 the typeface was digitised on behalf of Transport for London by Agfa Monotype Corporation, with the addition of two further weights, Book and Book Bold, as well as corresponding italic variants. The revised font family – not commercially available – is known as &#x27;New Johnston TfL&#x27;. In the early stages of digitisation, there was the chronic problem in letter-spacing, which seems to be solved more or less by now.

A further change occurred in 2008 when Transport for London removed the serif from the numeral &#x27;1&#x27; and also altered the &#x27;4&#x27;, in both cases reverting them to their original appearance. 
New Johnston&#x27;s numerals are originally designed to fit for setting tabular matters, which was requested by TfL.

As a proprietary typeface (one of the first ever), Johnston did not become commercially available in metal type. However, capitalising on the popularity of the design style after Gill Sans had become popular, the typefounders Stephenson Blake, who cast the Johnston metal type, created a similar but not identical design, Granby for sale. According to Mike Ashworth of Transport for London, London Transport itself made some use of Granby by the 1960s due to the limited availability of Johnston metal type. It also used Gill Sans for printed ephemera, such as timetables.

===Johnston Delf Smith===

This variant was commissioned by Frank Pick as a wedge-serif variation of the organisation&#x27;s standard sans-serif Johnston face and was designed by Percy Delf Smith, a former pupil of Edward Johnston; Johnston had considered a wedge-serif design during the early stages of the commission. The typeface was originally used for the headquarters building at 55 Broadway, SW1, It can only be seen on some signs at Sudbury Town on the Piccadilly line.

In early 2007, a digitisation of the typeface was developed by Transport for London under the name Johnston Delf Smith for its own use on historic signs. It is the property of TfL.
Designer Matthieu Cortat has released an unrelated implementation of the design commercially, under the name Petit Serif.

=== Johnston 100 ===

A new version, known as Johnston 100, was commissioned by Transport for London from Monotype in 2016 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the introduction of the typeface. It includes two new weights, &#x27;Hairline&#x27; and &#x27;Thin&#x27;, for digital use, as well as symbols such as the hash character codice_1. Several characters have been changed, such as the restoration of the diagonal bowl on the lowercase &#x27;g&#x27; which was lost in New Johnston. The font is designed to reflect Johnston&#x27;s original intentions, and to be closer to the original version of the Johnston typeface.

==Non-TfL digitisations==

Several digitisations of the Johnston type exist.

===ITC Johnston===
International Typeface Corporation released a variant in 1999 called ITC Johnston. It originally included three font weights like New Johnston; however, it does not include the hooked 1 and uses side-pointed 4.

In November 2002, the typeface was rereleased in OpenType format, which also expanded the font family to include italic fonts (resembling those of Gill Sans) in all weights. OpenType features include alternates, case forms, small caps (romans only), old style figure. Separate small caps (romans only) and old style figure faces were also released for each weight in TrueType and PostScript formats, for a total of fifteen typefaces.

===P22 Underground===
In 1997, London Transport Museum licensed the original Johnston typeface exclusively to P22 Type Foundry, available commercially, first under the name of Johnston Underground and then in an expanded version called Underground Pro. P22&#x27;s design is not based on New Johnston, having principally the goal of digitising and expanding on the original Johnston designs.
The full Underground Pro Set contains nineteen Pro OpenType fonts and 58 Basic OpenType fonts, covering extended Latin, Greek, Cyrillic character sets. Weights are expanded to six: Thin, Light, Book, Medium, Demi, Heavy. Underground, Underground CY, Underground GR support extended Latin, Cyrillic, Greek characters respectively. The Latin sub-family contains medium weight Titling fonts, which feature underscored and/or overscored Latin small letters. Pro fonts include extensive OpenType features, including eleven stylistic sets with stylistic alternates inspired by early signs, Johnston&#x27;s calligraphy and draft designs for Johnston and geometric sans designs such as Futura. Following the lead of Johnston&#x27;s original, P22 decided not to offer an italic.

The original Johnston Underground digitisation included Regular, Bold, and Extras weights, with the Extra containing only ornamental symbols.
===Railway Sans===
Railway Sans is an open-source interpretation of Johnston&#x27;s original (regular weight) by Justin Howes and Greg Fleming. It includes a number of alternate glyphs such as a Garamond-inspired &quot;W&quot; (used on old signs at West Brompton station), ligatures and a characteristic arrow design.

===Paddington===
Paddington is a basic public domain digitisation by Stephen Moye, including italic, bold, and small caps designs.

==Usages==
Its use has included the Tube map (sometimes hand-lettered), nameplates and general station signing, as well as much of the printed material issued by the Underground Group and its successors; also by the nationalised British Road Services in the immediate post-war era.

It was used for wayfinding signs at the London 2012 Summer Olympics and Summer Paralympics, including venues outside London. It was also used for the signs that accompanied the parade of nations during the opening ceremony.

<text>www.tism.wanker.com is the fourth studio album by Australian alternative rock group TISM (This Is Serious Mum), released in June 1998. The album peaked at number 26 on the ARIA charts.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998, the album was nominated for the ARIA Award for Best Independent Release.

The title references an internet URL which, at the time of release, was a subdomain (of wanker.com) provided by a friendly person overseas who had registered wanker.com, as TISM were not able to obtain their preferred domain, wanker.com.au, due to Australian domain regulations. However, the web hosting fees were not paid, subsequently it was taken down by the hosting ISP several months after launch and has not been available since.

Early editions of the CD featured a CD-ROM component. The program asks the user whether they want to continue – repeatedly. Eventually, it responds &quot;OK then. Downloading virus.&quot; No virus is actually downloaded.

In October 2009, the album was released to iTunes for digital download, with nine bonus tracks from the band&#x27;s 1996 gospel demo session &quot;No Penis, No God&quot; as bonus tracks. On 16 April 2024, &quot;No Penis, No God&quot; was released on limited-edition bootleg-style LP, with five unreleased bonus tracks from the sessions.

On 12 October 2022, the album was announced for a November reissue on CD and blue vinyl, with the CD containing five of the six actual songs from the original 1998 bonus CD, &quot;Att: Shock Records Faulty Pressing Do Not Manufacture&quot; (the rest of the tracks were poems and recordings of the band talking amongst each other), plus &quot;Drop the Tude&quot;, a B-side to the &quot;I Might Be a Cunt, but I&#x27;m Not a Fucking Cunt&quot; single.

In May 2023, the band released a seven-disc box set called the Wanker Box, celebrating the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary. This features the original 12-track album, the six bonus songs included on the 2022 CD reissue, plus 12 songs from the rare &quot;Att: Shock Records Faulty Pressing Do Not Manufacture&quot; compilation (originally included as a bonus disc with the 1998 CD release), mixes and B-sides and more than a dozen previously unreleased tracks. The riff to &quot;Choose Lose&quot;, one of the unreleased tracks from the boxset, would later be used for the band&#x27;s 2024 single &quot;Death to Art&quot;, while the lyrics were later rewritten and used as the basis for the unreleased song &quot;Sickie&quot;, which was only performed live in 1998 and 1999.

==Singles==
* &quot;Yob&quot; was released in November 1997 as the album&#x27;s lead single. This song details the &quot;ingredients&quot; which go into making up a &quot;yobbo&quot;.
*&quot;I Might Be a Cunt, but I&#x27;m Not a Fucking Cunt&quot; was released in April 1998 as the album&#x27;s second single. The song peaked at number 90 on the ARIA charts. The song and its accompanying music video of a couple having sex was banned by the SBS, ABC&#x27;s rage, and Triple J due to its content; however, it was played quite frequently by Melbourne independent broadcaster 3RRR on the Breakfasters show. Bruce Ruxton, the head of the Victorian Branch of the Australian RSL, wrote a letter of complaint to Shock Records asking for TISM to be fired from the label, and describing the song as &quot;...Dropping [Australia&#x27;s standards] through the floor into the proverbial sewer&quot;. Ron Hitler Barassi of TISM responded to criticism in an interview saying &quot;I actually like the song, the thing that disappoints me about some of the reaction to the song is people&#x27;s reaction was confined to &#x27;oh how naughty, oh those naughty boys TISM have said a naughty word, fuck, and another naughty word, cunt, and oh that&#x27;s so naughty&#x27; and I must admit, I was sort of, and I shouldn&#x27;t have, I was disappointed with that reaction ... We were attempting to use the common dialect of people in the street, to sum up a term, have a good pisstake. It&#x27;s more than just naughtiness. That&#x27;s very profound isn&#x27;t it?&quot;
*&quot;Whatareya?&quot; was released in July 1998 as the album&#x27;s third single. The song peaked at number 66 on the ARIA charts.
*&quot;Thunderbirds Are Coming Out&quot; was released in October 1998 as the fourth and final single from the album.

==Reception==
Jonathan Lewis from &quot;AllMusic&quot; said &quot;&quot;www.tism.wanker.com&quot; was a misbegotten attempt to recreate the success of its predecessor, but it fails on most counts. &quot;Machiavelli&quot; was a funny album: tasteless, yet tongue-in-cheek enough to charm listeners. &quot;www.tism.wanker.com&quot;, however, was simply offensive. The humour was forced, the lyrics less clever than on previous outings and the music was becoming stale.&quot; Lewis said &quot;Highlights were few and far between, although &#x27;Thunderbirds Are Coming Out&#x27; was a standout.&quot; In July 1998 issue of &quot;Beat Magazine&quot;, Bronius Zumerius in is 7/10 review of the album, said the dance element explored in their previous album &quot;Machiavelli and the Four Seasons&quot; continues as the band &quot;grasp at current dance trends with some precision&quot;, along with the social commentary of tracks like &quot;Whatareya?&quot;, &quot;Denial Works for Me&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s Gonna Be Sex Tonite&quot;, mingling with the tongue in cheek tracks like &quot;Been Caught Wankin&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Yob&quot; and &quot;I Might Be A Cunt, But I&#x27;m Not A Fucking Cunt&quot;, &quot;with fist in the air, lunatic dancing, screaming, lung bursting effect.&quot; He concludes the review of the album saying it&#x27;s &quot;not their most exemplary material, but enough chortles are to be had to validate its existence.&quot;

==Track listings==


===&quot;Att: Shock Records Faulty Pressing Do Not Manufacture&quot;===
Initial pressings of the album were shipped with a bonus disc. The CD in question looks like a blank CDR, with texta writing that reads &quot;Att: SHOCK RECORDS FAULTY PRESSING DO NOT MANUFACTURE&quot;; thinking it was serious, some retail chains actually returned boxes of the &quot;fake&quot; CDs unopened. In reality, it featured six outtakes from the &quot;wanker.com&quot; sessions and several poems, bookended by low-quality audio recordings of Hitler-Barassi and Flaubert discussing various topics whilst watching a pornographic film.

The &quot;conversation&quot; tracks have never been given an official title. For the iTunes re-release, these tracks were appended to the start/end of the titled tracks. The titles were available on TISM&#x27;s website at the time.

&quot;The Last Australian Guitar Hero&quot;, &quot;Kate - Fischer of Men&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Be Happier if I Wasn&#x27;t More Depressed&quot; were released as B-sides to singles.

On 29 April 2023, the conversation tracks were released for free on the group&#x27;s Bandcamp page.

<doc id="1018942" wikidata="Q652187" url="?curid=1018942" title="Mayor of St. Louis">
<text>The Mayor of St. Louis is the chief executive officer of St. Louis&#x27;s city government. The mayor has a duty to enforce city ordinances and the power to either approve or veto city ordinances passed by the Board of Aldermen. The current mayor is Tishaura Jones, who took office on April 20, 2021.

Forty-seven people have held the office, four of whom — William Carr Lane, John Fletcher Darby, John Wimer, and John How — served non-consecutive terms. Lane, the city&#x27;s first mayor, served the most terms: eight one-year terms plus the unexpired term of Darby. Francis Slay is the longest-serving mayor, having served four 4-year terms. The second-longest-serving mayor was Henry Kiel, who served 12 years and nine days over three terms in office. Two others — Raymond Tucker and Vincent C. Schoemehl — also served three terms, but seven fewer days. The shortest-serving mayor was Arthur Barret, who died 11 days after taking office. The first female mayor was Lyda Krewson, who served from 2017 to 2021.

==Duties and powers==

The mayor has an office in the St. Louis City Hall

St. Louis was incorporated as a city on December 9, 1822, four months after Missouri was admitted as a state to the Union. In accordance with its new charter, the city changed its governance to a mayor-council format and elected its first mayor, William Carr Lane, on April 7, 1823.

==Elections==
The mayor is elected for four years during the general municipal election, which is held every two years on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in April. The candidates are selected through a combined approval voting primary, with the top two advancing to the general. The mayor is usually sworn during the first session of the Board of Aldermen two weeks after the election.

Under the original city charter, the mayor was elected to a one-year term. Terms became two years under the 1859 city charter. The mayor&#x27;s office was extended to its present four-year term after passage of the Charter and Scheme in 1876 which separated the City of St. Louis from St. Louis County.

==Succession==
If the office of mayor becomes vacant through death, resignation, recall, or removal by the board of aldermen, the president of the board of aldermen becomes mayor until a special mayoral election can be held; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the mayor, the president only acts out the duties of mayor. Should both offices be vacant, the vice-president of the board of aldermen becomes mayor.

Five people have acted as mayor: Wilson Primm following the resignation of John Darby; Ferdinand W. Cronenbold following the resignation of Chauncey Filley; Herman Rechtien following the death of Arthur Barret; George W. Allen following the resignation of David Francis; and Aloys P. Kaufmann following the death of William Becker.

==List of mayors==


===Notes===

* A. 47 people have served as mayor, four twice; the table includes these non-consecutive terms as well.
* B. The fractional terms of some mayors are not to be understood absolutely literally; rather, they are meant to show single terms during which multiple mayors served, due to resignations, deaths and the like.
* C. Samuel Merry was elected mayor of St. Louis in April 1833; however, his eligibility was questioned by the City Council as he was a federal officer—United States Receiver of Public Moneys in St. Louis. Merry filed suit to force the council&#x27;s compliance and in October 1833, he was ruled ineligible by the Missouri Supreme Court. Johnston was elected mayor in a special mayoral election held a month later on November 9. Page continued to serve as mayor until the case was settled and Johnston elected.
* D. Darby resigned from office. William Carr Lane was later elected to fill the vacancy.
* E. As president of the Board of Aldermen, Primm acted as mayor following the resignation of Darby.
* F. Oliver Filley&#x27;s second term was the first mayoral term to last 2 years.
* G. Daniel G. Taylor was the candidate of a one-time coalition of traditional Missouri Democrats, pro-slavery activists, and secessionists calling itself the &quot;Union Anti-Black Republican&quot; ticket. The coalition was suspicious of the Abolitionist platform of the Republican party, and argued that St. Louis should not be governed by &quot;Black Abolitionists&quot; who would support newly elected President Lincoln in acting, including the use of military force, to prevent secession of southern states. Mayor Taylor worked in concert with Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson, until Jackson fled the state capitol to establish a Confederate aligned state government-in-exile. Mayor Taylor then cooperated with the new conservative-Unionist Governor, Hamilton Gamble.
* H. Chauncey Filley resigned after serving one year of his two-year term as mayor due to poor health.
* I. As president of the Board of Common Council, Cronenbold acted as mayor following the resignation of Chauncey Filley.
* J. Died in office.
* K. Barret became suddenly ill and died after only 11 days in office.
* L. As president of the City Council, Rechtin acted as mayor following the death of Arthur Barret.
* M. Henry Overstolz was declared defeated by James Britton in the 1875 election, but contested the election and was seated as mayor nine months later after a recount of the ballots.
* N. Per the new city charter of 1876, Overstolz became the first mayor of St. Louis elected to a four-year term.
* O. Resigned from office to become Governor of Missouri.
* P. As president of the City Council, Allen acted as mayor following the resignation of David Francis.
* Q. As president of the Board of Aldermen, Kaufmann became mayor following the death of William Becker. He was later elected mayor, in a special mayoral election in November 1944, to fill Becker&#x27;s unexpired term.

<doc id="1018946" wikidata="Q1189783" url="?curid=1018946" title="Nicotine replacement therapy">
<text>Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a medically approved way to treat people with tobacco use disorder by taking nicotine through means other than tobacco. It is used to help with quitting smoking or stopping chewing tobacco. It increases the chance of quitting tobacco smoking by about 55%. Often it is used along with other behavioral techniques. NRT has also been used to treat ulcerative colitis. Types of NRT include the adhesive patch, chewing gum, lozenges, nose spray, and inhaler. The use of multiple types of NRT at a time may increase effectiveness.
Common side effects depend on the formulation of nicotine. Common side effects with the gum include nausea, hiccups, and irritation of the mouth. Common side effects with the patch include skin irritation and a dry mouth while the inhaler commonly results in a cough, runny nose, or headaches. Serious risks include nicotine poisoning and continued addiction. They do not appear to increase the risk of heart attacks. There are possible harms to the baby if used during pregnancy. Nicotine replacement therapy works by reducing cravings caused by nicotine addiction.
They were first approved for use in 1984, in the United States. Nicotine replacement products are on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. They are available as generic medications.

==Medical uses==


Nicotine replacement therapy, in the form of gum, patches, nasal spray, inhaler and lozenges all improve the ability of people trying to quit tobacco products. Nicotine replacement therapy is as effective as medications, such as bupropion, in helping people quit smoking for at least six months. All forms of nicotine replacement therapy, including nicotine gum, patches, nasal spray, inhalers, and lozenges, have similar success rates in terms of helping people stop smoking. However, the likelihood that someone will stick to a certain treatment varies, with compliance being the highest with nicotine patches, followed by nicotine gum, inhalers, and nasal sprays. Using a few different nicotine replacement methods in combination may improve success rates in stopping tobacco use. Additionally, using nicotine replacement with counseling has been proven to improve tobacco abstinence rates. These other strategies include: creating a plan to quit and utilizing quit programs, a quit phone line, or app that provides tips and inspiration to help quit.

Using nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking should be considered for people who are severely dependent on nicotine. People who are severely dependent include those who smoke: more than one pack per day, within five minutes of awakening, while ill, when they wake up in the middle of the night, to ease withdrawal signs and symptoms.

Nicotine replacement products are most beneficial for heavy smokers who smoke more than 15 cigarettes per day. There are not enough studies to show whether NRT helps those who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day.

===Effectiveness===
Evaluation of NRT in real-world studies produces more modest outcomes than efficacy studies conducted by industry-funded trials. The National Health Service (NHS) in England has a smoking cessation service based on pharmacotherapy in combination with counseling support. An Action on Smoking and Health (UK) (ASH) report claims that the average cost per life-year gained for every smoker successfully treated by these services is less than £1,000 (below the NICE guidelines of £20,000 per QALY (quality-adjusted life year). However, the investment in NHS stop smoking services is relatively low. A comparison with treatment costs for illicit drug users shows that £585 million is committed for 350,000 problem drug users compared to £56 million for 9 million users of tobacco. This is £6.20 for each smoker, compared to £1,670 per illegal drug user.

The claims for high efficacy and cost-effectiveness of NRT have not been substantiated in real-world effectiveness studies. Pierce and Gilpin (2002) stated their conclusion as follows: &quot;Since becoming available over the counter, NRT appears no longer effective in increasing long-term successful cessation&quot; (p. 1260). Efficacy studies, which are conducted using randomized controlled trials, do not transfer very well to real-world effectiveness. Bauld, Bell, McCullough, Richardson and Greaves (2009) reviewed 20 studies on the effectiveness of intensive NHS treatments for smoking cessation published between 1990 and 2007. Quit rates showed a dramatic decrease between 4-weeks and one year. A quit rate of 53% at four weeks fell to only 15% at one year. Younger smokers, females, pregnant smokers and more deprived smokers had lower quit rates than other groups.

The efficacy for each of the formulations alone (lozenges, nasal spray, gum, and transdermal patch) to aid in smoking cessation is equal. Efficacy increases 15% to 36% with combining treatments such as gum and lozenges. Higher doses increase the chance of stopping smoking for a period of six months and more. For patches, the most efficient doses were 25 mg worn over 16 hours or 21 mg worn over 24 hours. The evidence suggests that 4 mg nicotine gum leads to higher quit rates compared with 2 mg in heavy smokers.

==Toxicity==
&quot;N&quot;-Nitrosonornicotine, a strong carcinogen present in unburned tobacco and cigarette smoke, has been found in the urine of some users of oral NRT products. Nicotine patches is an alternative.

==Side effects==

Some side effects are caused by the nicotine, and are common to NRT products. Other common side effects depend on the formulation of nicotine. Common side effects with the gum include nausea, hiccups, and irritation of the mouth. Common side effects with the patch include skin irritation and a dry mouth while the inhaler commonly results in a cough, runny nose, or headaches. To minimize local skin reactions from the patch, the application site should be moved daily. The nicotine patch can also cause strange dreams if worn while asleep. Nasal sprays commonly cause nasal irritation, watering eyes, and coughing.

Serious risks include nicotine poisoning, which includes symptoms like visual disturbances, hyper-salivation, nausea, and vomiting; and continued addiction to nicotine products. Avoiding smoking and other products with nicotine are recommended since it may lead to nicotine overdose. Although overdose is rare, it can be problematic, especially in children and pets. The symptoms of nicotine overdose include headache, pale skin and mouth, belly pain, weakness, diarrhea, tremors or seizures, agitation, confusion, restlessness, high or low blood pressure, fast or irregular heartbeat, fast breathing, and cold sweats.

Limited evidence exists regarding long-term NRT use.

==Safety==

===Pregnancy===
Nicotine is not safe to use in any amount during pregnancy. Nicotine crosses the placenta and is found in the breast milk of mothers who smoke as well as mothers who inhale passive smoke. There are possible harms to the baby if NRT is used during pregnancy. Thus, pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding should also consult a physician before initiating NRT. The gum, lozenge, and nasal spray are pregnancy category C. The transdermal patch is pregnancy category D. The transdermal patch is considered less safe for the fetus because it delivers continuous nicotine exposure, as opposed to the gum or lozenge, which delivers intermittent and thus lower nicotine exposure.

Strong evidence suggests that nicotine cannot be regarded as a safe substance of cigarette use. Nicotine itself could be at least partly responsible for many of the adverse after birth health results related to cigarette use while the mother was pregnant. There is evidence that nicotine negatively affects fetal brain development and pregnancy outcomes. There is also risk of stillbirth and pre-term birth. Nicotine use will probably harm fetal neurological development. Risks to the child later in life from nicotine exposure during pregnancy include type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility. Nicotine exposure during pregnancy can result in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and learning disabilities in the child. It also puts the child at increased risk for nicotine addiction in the future.

Pregnant women should consider behavioral therapy before NRT is considered.

===Youth===
In people under the age of eighteen, a physician is often consulted before starting NRT. The evidence suggests that exposure to nicotine between the ages of 10 and 25 years causes lasting harm to the brain and cognitive ability. Evidence is unclear whether adolescents gain benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy or smoking cessation over the long-term as of 2017. Most tobacco users are under-eighteens when they start, and almost no-one over the age of 25 starts using.

===Cardiovascular conditions===
While there is no evidence that NRT can increase the risk of heart attacks, individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or recent heart attacks should consult a physician before initiating NRT.

Smoking is known to cause cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Cigarette smoking is the cause of 20% of all cardiovascular deaths in the United States, which is the leading cause of mortality.

=== Other conditions ===
Nicotine replacement therapies should be used cautiously in individuals with the following conditions: severe reactive airway diseases (for nasal spray), chronic nasal disorders such as sinusitis, polyps, rhinitis, or allergy (for nasal spray), diabetes (insulin-dependent), gastrointestinal diseases such as esophagitis, active gastric or peptic ulcer disease, liver problems, hyperthyroidism,pheochromocytoma, phenylketonuria (for lozenges), renal problems, and skin conditions such as psoriasis or dermatitis (for the transdermal patch).

==Mechanism of action==

Nicotine replacement therapy works by reducing cravings due to nicotine addiction. Smoking cigarettes releases high doses of nicotine to the brain in a matter of seconds as opposed to low doses released over a period of minutes to hours by the various forms of nicotine replacement therapy. Nicotine from NRT does not reach as high a concentration in the blood as does nicotine from smoke inhalation due to different absorption methods. NRT relies on systemic venous absorption, whereas nicotine from cigarettes reaches the arterial system. Nicotine replacement products vary in the time it takes for the nicotine to enter the body and the total time nicotine stays in the body. The more quickly a dose of nicotine is delivered and absorbed, the higher the addiction risk. It is possible to become dependent on some NRTs.

Nicotine patches are applied to the skin and continuously administer a stable dose of nicotine slowly over 16–24 hours. Nicotine gum, nicotine sprays, nicotine toothpicks, nicotine sublingual tablets, and nicotine lozenges administer nicotine orally with quicker nicotine uptake into the body but lasting a shorter amount of time. Nicotine inhalers are metered-dose inhalers that administer nicotine through the lungs and mucous membranes of the throat quickly, lasting for a short amount of time. For example, blood nicotine levels are the highest 5–10 minutes after using the nicotine nasal spray, 20 minutes after using a nicotine inhaler or chewing nicotine gum, and 2–4 hours after using a nicotine patch.

==Society and culture==
NRT products were first approved for use in the United States in 1984. Nicotine replacement products are on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.. They are available as generic medication.

=== Formulations ===


The nicotine patch is a once-daily, longer-acting form of NRT. An advantage of the nicotine patch is its simple compliance; it does not require active use throughout the day. The gum, lozenge, sublingual tablet, oral inhaler, oral spray, and nasal spray are acutely dosed products, providing the user with the benefit and ability of self-titrating based on cravings.

Brand names include Commit Lozenge, Nicoderm, Nicogum, Nicorette, Nicotex, Nicotinell, and Thrive. NRT products contain similar pharmaceutical grade nicotine as is used in e-cigarettes.

=== Medicines ===
In 2015, the United States Public Health Service listed seven agents for the stopping of tobacco, which included five nicotine replacement treatments (nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays) and two oral medications (bupropion and varenicline). Other NRT options are available, including nicotine mouth sprays and sublingual tablets.

===Dosing===
The dose of nicotine replacement therapy products is generally based on if the user is considered a heavy, average, or light smoker.

A cigarette delivers an average of 1 mg to 3 mg of the nicotine contained in it. NRT products typically aim to parallel this, but the amount of nicotine absorbed by the user is less than the original dose.

Nicotine nasal sprays are formulated in doses of lowest strength, available in 0.5 mg and 1 mg strengths.

Nicotine lozenges deliver doses as low as 1 mg up to 4 mg. It is not chewed as the gum would be, and dissolves in approximately 30 minutes. This formulation may be preferred by those individuals who do not find gum chewing to be acceptable.

Nicotine gum is available in doses of 2 mg and 4 mg. Using 4 mg nicotine gum versus 2 mg gum increases the likelihood of successful smoking cessation. When using the gum, acidic beverages like soda, coffee, or beer should be avoided fifteen minutes prior and during use because they can impede proper absorption of nicotine.

Nicotine inhalers come in 10 mg and 15 mg cartridge strengths and typically deliver around 4 mg in one dose. The inhaler may be preferred in individuals who want to satisfy the hand-to-mouth ritual that smoking provides.

Transdermal patches deliver between 5 mg and 52.5 mg of nicotine, which results in plasma levels similar to that of heavy smokers. Combining nicotine patch treatment with a faster nicotine-delivery means, like nicotine gum or spray, improves the likelihood of successful treatment.

===Not approved as NRTs===

Some smokeless consumer products available can function as alternative nicotine delivery systems (ANDS) but they have not received FDA approval as smoking-cessation therapy aids that are safe and effective.

Snus and nasal snuff also allow for nicotine administration outside of tobacco smoking. Nicotine pouches are described as similar to or a tobacco-free variant of snus. They are pre-portioned and are held in the user&#x27;s lip or cheek allowing for sublingual or buccal delivery of flavors and high doses of nicotine. The small pouches are not like chewing tobacco, as the user does not need to spit since the contents of the pouches stay inside during use. Swedish pouches have been available on the American consumer market since at least 2016 but their popularity and controversy surged in 2019 and 2020. In the US and UK concerns have been raised that nicotine pouches are seemingly too similar to banned snus products, is aimed at teenagers, further complicating the youth vaping trend, falling into the hands of adolescents easily, and are discrete enough to easily pass for regular gums or lozenges.

Nicotine infused toothpicks are another product that has been available in the United States since at least 2013. They can have a total nicotine delivery that is comparable to that of nicotine gum. Nicotine toothpicks generally are infused with food-grade flavorings and 1–3 mg of nicotine, which is similar to that of other oral-delivery nicotine products and some cigarettes. In spite of these similarities, as of 2018 they have been a subject of controversy. Online retailers have been under scrutiny for allowing their products to be too easily purchased by youth. Various news outlets and school districts have expressed the concern that these products have a high appeal to minors wanting to experiment with nicotine due to; the multitude of sweet flavors offered, ease &amp; speed of use, seeming innocuous, and having a discreet nature. In 2015, NRT sales fell for the first time since 2008 while sales for e-cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) continued to increase at a substantial rate. The evidence is that UK smokers are trying to quit with e-cigarettes rather than NRT methods.

E-cigarettes are often, although not always, designed to look and feel like cigarettes. They have been marketed as less harmful alternatives to cigarettes, but very few are as yet approved as NRTs in any jurisdiction. Some electronic cigarettes have coarsely adjustable nicotine levels. Some healthcare groups have hesitated to recommend e-cigarettes for quitting smoking, because of limited evidence of effectiveness and safety. However, more recent review show the opposite, possibly because of newer types of e‐cigarettes have better nicotine delivery than older one.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a list of additional tobacco products they are seeking to regulate, including electronic cigarettes. Most approved NRT products have been approved for over 20 years, however the FDA has also approved nicotine inhalers as a form of NRT.

Future approaches of NRT could include nicotine preloading, a true pulmonary inhaler, and nicotine vaccines. Nicotine preloading, otherwise known as pre-cessation or pre-quitting NRT, has found that using the patch for a few weeks before the quit date produces significantly higher quit rates than if it was started on the quit day. The true pulmonary inhaler would deliver nicotine to the lungs in a manner that more resembles cigarette smoking, which would provide better relief of background cravings as well as acute cravings. Nicotine vaccines are under investigation as a method to treat tobacco dependence through priming the body to mount an immune response against nicotine.

<doc id="1018948" wikidata="Q688712" url="?curid=1018948" title="Dow Jones Transportation Average">
<text>The Dow Jones Transportation Average, (DJTA, also called the &quot;Dow Jones Transports&quot;), [[ticker symbol|index ticker symbol]] DJT is a U.S. stock market index from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices of the transportation sector, and is the most widely recognized gauge of the American transportation sector. It is the oldest stock index still in use, being in use longer than its better-known relative, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).

==Components==
The index is a running average of the stock prices of twenty transportation corporations, with each stock&#x27;s price weighted to adjust for stock splits and other factors. As a result, it can change at any time the markets are open. The figure mentioned in news reports is usually the figure derived from the prices at the close of the market for the day.

Changes in the index&#x27;s composition are rare, and generally occur only after corporate acquisitions or other dramatic shifts in a component&#x27;s core business. Should such an event require that one component be replaced, the entire index is reviewed.

, the index consists of the following 20 companies:

Alaska Air Group replaced AMR Corporation on December 2, 2011, after AMR corp. filed for bankruptcy protection.

Effective October 30, 2012, Kirby Corp. replaced Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.

Effective October 1, 2014, Avis Budget Group Inc. replaced GATX Corporation.

On October 15, 2015, American Airlines Group replaced Con-way.

Effective December 14, 2021, Old Dominion Freight Line replaced Kansas City Southern.

Effective February 26, 2024, Uber replaced JetBlue Airways. The index change was prompted by JetBlue’s low weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point caused by its low share price.

==History==

The average was created on July 3, 1884, by Charles Dow, co-founder of Dow Jones &amp; Company, as part of the &quot;Customer&#x27;s Afternoon Letter&quot;. At its inception, it consisted of eleven transportation companies—nine railroads and two non-rail companies:
*Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway
*Chicago and North Western Railway
*Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad
*Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway
*Louisville and Nashville Railroad
*Missouri Pacific Railway
*New York Central Railroad
*Northern Pacific Railroad preferred stock
*Pacific Mail Steamship Company (not a railroad)
*Union Pacific Railway
*Western Union (not a railroad)

As a result of the dominating presence of railroads, the Transportation Average was often referred to as &quot;rails&quot; in financial discussions in the early and middle part of the 20th century.

==Use in Dow theory==

The Transportation Average is an important factor in Dow theory.

==Price history==

In 1964, the index first broke 200, slightly over where it was in 1929.

In 1983, the index first broke 500. In 1987, the index broke 1000. It closed at 2146.89 on March 9, 2009, having a low coincident with some other indices; this was a bit above its low of 1942.19 on March 11, 2003.

The index broke above the mid-5000s to begin a run of record highs on January 15, 2013, at a time when the better-known Industrials stood about 5% below all-time highs achieved more than five years earlier. By May, the Industrials and all other major indexes except the NASDAQ group were making all-time highs, including the Transports, which reached new closing and intraday records above the 6,500 level. On October 24, 2013, the Transports closed at 7,022.79, for its first close above 7,000 points. It closed the year at a record high of 7,400.57. On May 27, 2014, it first closed above 8,000 points. The index closed above 9000 on November 10, 2014. At the close of 2014, the index hit 9139.92. At the close of 2015, the index hit 7508.71, a loss of 17.85% on the year.

== Annual returns ==
The following table shows the price return of the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which was calculated back to 1924.

== Record values ==

== Investing ==
There is no fund that tracks this index. There are funds that have a similar behavior, such as iShares Transportation Average ETF ().

<text>This is a list of convexity topics, by Wikipedia page.
* Alpha blending - the process of combining a translucent foreground color with a background color, thereby producing a new blended color. This is a convex combination of two colors allowing for transparency effects in computer graphics.
* Barycentric coordinates - a coordinate system in which the location of a point of a simplex (a triangle, tetrahedron, etc.) is specified as the center of mass, or barycenter, of masses placed at its vertices. The coordinates are non-negative for points in the convex hull.
* Borsuk&#x27;s conjecture - a conjecture about the number of pieces required to cover a body with a larger diameter. Solved by Hadwiger for the case of smooth convex bodies.
* Bond convexity - a measure of the non-linear relationship between price and yield duration of a bond to changes in interest rates, the second derivative of the price of the bond with respect to interest rates. A basic form of convexity in finance.
* Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem (convex hull) - If a point &quot;x&quot; of R&quot;d&quot; lies in the convex hull of a set &quot;P&quot;, there is a subset of &quot;P&quot; with &quot;d&quot;+1 or fewer points such that &quot;x&quot; lies in its convex hull.
* Choquet theory - an area of functional analysis and convex analysis concerned with measures with support on the extreme points of a convex set &quot;C&quot;. Roughly speaking, all vectors of &quot;C&quot; should appear as &quot;averages&quot; of extreme points.
* Complex convexity — extends the notion of convexity to complex numbers.
* Convex analysis - the branch of mathematics devoted to the study of properties of convex functions and convex sets, often with applications in convex minimization.
* Convex combination - a linear combination of points where all coefficients are non-negative and sum to 1. All convex combinations are within the convex hull of the given points.
* &quot;Convex and Concave&quot; - a print by Escher in which many of the structure&#x27;s features can be seen as both convex shapes and concave impressions.
* Convex body - a compact convex set in a Euclidean space whose interior is non-empty.
* Convex conjugate - a dual of a real functional in a vector space. Can be interpreted as an encoding of the convex hull of the function&#x27;s epigraph in terms of its supporting hyperplanes.
* Convex curve - a plane curve that lies entirely on one side of each of its supporting lines. The interior of a closed convex curve is a convex set.

* Convex function - a function in which the line segment between any two points on the graph of the function lies above the graph.
** Closed convex function - a convex function all of whose sublevel sets are closed sets.
** Proper convex function - a convex function whose effective domain is nonempty and it never attains minus infinity.
** Concave function - the negative of a convex function.
* Convex geometry - the branch of geometry studying convex sets, mainly in Euclidean space. Contains three sub-branches: general convexity, polytopes and polyhedra, and discrete geometry.
* Convex hull (aka &quot;convex envelope&quot;) - the smallest convex set that contains a given set of points in Euclidean space.
* Convex lens - a lens in which one or two sides is curved or bowed outwards. Light passing through the lens is converged (or focused) to a spot behind the lens.
* Convex optimization - a subfield of optimization, studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. The convexity property can make optimization in some sense &quot;easier&quot; than the general case - for example, any local minimum must be a global minimum.
* Convex polygon - a 2-dimensional polygon whose interior is a convex set in the Euclidean plane.
* Convex polytope - an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional polytope which is also a convex set in the Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space.
* Convex set - a set in Euclidean space in which contains every segment between every two of its points.
* Convexity (finance) - refers to non-linearities in a financial model. When the price of an underlying variable changes, the price of an output does not change linearly, but depends on the higher-order derivatives of the modeling function. Geometrically, the model is no longer flat but curved, and the degree of curvature is called the convexity.
* Duality (optimization)
* Epigraph (mathematics) - for a function &quot;f&quot; : Rn→R, the set of points lying on or above its graph
* Extreme point - for a convex set &quot;S&quot; in a real vector space, a point in S which does not lie in any open line segment joining two points of &quot;S&quot;.
* Fenchel conjugate
* Fenchel&#x27;s inequality
* Fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces, generalise the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. They have applications, for example, to the proof of existence theorems for partial differential equations
* Four vertex theorem - every convex curve has at least 4 vertices.
* Gift wrapping algorithm - an algorithm for computing the convex hull of a given set of points
* Graham scan - a method of finding the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane with time complexity O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;)
* Hadwiger conjecture (combinatorial geometry) - any convex body in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space can be covered by 2&quot;n&quot; or fewer smaller bodies homothetic with the original body.
* Hadwiger&#x27;s theorem - a theorem that characterizes the valuations on convex bodies in R&quot;n&quot;.
* Helly&#x27;s theorem
* Hyperplane - a subspace whose dimension is one less than that of its ambient space
* Indifference curve
* Infimal convolute
* Interval (mathematics) - a set of real numbers with the property that any number that lies between two numbers in the set is also included in the set
* Jarvis march
* Jensen&#x27;s inequality - relates the value of a convex function of an integral to the integral of the convex function
* John ellipsoid - &quot;E&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) associated to a convex body &quot;K&quot; in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot; is the ellipsoid of maximal &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume contained within &quot;K&quot;.
* Lagrange multiplier - a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints
* Legendre transformation - an involutive transformation on the real-valued convex functions of one real variable
* Locally convex topological vector space - example of topological vector spaces (TVS) that generalize normed spaces
* Macbeath regions 
* Mahler volume - a dimensionless quantity that is associated with a centrally symmetric convex body
* Minkowski&#x27;s theorem - any convex set in formula_1 which is symmetric with respect to the origin and with volume greater than 2&quot;n&quot; d(&quot;L&quot;) contains a non-zero lattice point
* Mixed volume
* Mixture density
* Newton polygon - a tool for understanding the behaviour of polynomials over local fields
* Radon&#x27;s theorem - on convex sets, that any set of &quot;d&quot; + 2 points in R&quot;d&quot; can be partitioned into two disjoint sets whose convex hulls intersect
* Separating axis theorem
* Shapley–Folkman lemma - a result in convex geometry with applications in mathematical economics that describes the Minkowski addition of sets in a vector space
* Shephard&#x27;s problem - a geometrical question
* Simplex - a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions
** Simplex method - a popular algorithm for linear programming
* Subdifferential - generalization of the derivative to functions which are not differentiable
* Supporting hyperplane - a hyperplane meeting certain conditions
** Supporting hyperplane theorem - that defines a supporting hyperplane</text><links>

<text>Horatio Balch Hackett (December 27, 1808 – November 2, 1875), American biblical scholar, was born in Salisbury, Massachusetts. His father, Richard Hackett, was a ship-builder who died when Horatio was only five years old. Hence, Horatio and his brothers were raised mostly by their mother, Martha née Balch.

He was educated at Phillips Academy and at Amherst College, where he graduated as valedictorian in 1830, and at Andover Theological Seminary, where he graduated in 1834. He was adjunct professor of Latin and Greek Languages and Literature at Brown University in 1835-1838 and professor of Hebrew Literature there in 1838-1839.

He was ordained to the Baptist ministry in 1839—he had become a Baptist at Andover as the result of preparing a paper on baptism in the New Testament and the Fathers—and in 1839-1868 he was professor of Biblical literature and interpretation in Newton Theological Institution where his most important work was the introduction of the modern German methods of Biblical criticism, which he had learned from Moses Stuart at Andover and with which he made himself more familiar in Germany (especially under Tholuck at Halle) in 1841.

He traveled in Egypt and Palestine in 1852, and then in 1857 published a book on his observations and experiences entitled Illustrations of Scripture: A Tour Through the Holy Land.

In 1858-1859 he traveled around Greece, becoming proficient in modern Greek. From 1870 until his death in Rochester, New York, he was professor of Biblical literature and New Testament exegesis in the Rochester Theological Seminary. He was a great teacher but a greater critical and exegetical scholar.

<text>, nicknamed Zenjo (全女: 全 meaning &quot;All&quot;, 女 meaning &quot;Woman&quot;) was a &quot;joshi puroresu&quot; (women&#x27;s professional wrestling) promotion established in 1968 by Takashi Matsunaga and his brothers. The group held their first card on June 4 of that year. For close to 33 years it had a TV program on Fuji TV called &quot;Women&#x27;s Professional Wrestling&quot;.

== History ==

The All Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling Corporation, established in 1968, was the successor to the &quot;All Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling Association&quot;, which had been formed in August 1955, to oversee the plethora of women&#x27;s wrestling promotions that had sprung up in Japan following a tour in November, 1954, by Mildred Burke and her World Women&#x27;s Wrestling Association (WWWA). These promotions included the &quot;All Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling Federation&quot;, and the &quot;All Japan Women&#x27;s Wrestling Club&quot;, started in 1948, which was the first women&#x27;s wrestling promotion in Japan. For a time the Club pushed female wrestling as a legitimate sport, booking sporting arenas.

By the mid-1960s, the association had fallen apart, due to infighting between the member promotions, and female wrestling was relegated back to being a sideshow act in strip-tease theaters. In 1967, another attempt to organize the sport of women&#x27;s professional wrestling was made with a new All Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling Association. This time the Fabulous Moolah, the NWA Women&#x27;s Champion, came across from the United States and traded her title with Yukiko Tomoe, to lend legitimacy to the promotion. The new Association broke up later that year. Finally, in 1968, Takashi Matsunaga, who had been the promoter for All Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling Federation, formed the All Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling Corporation (AJW) with his brothers Kenji, Kunimatsu and Toshikuni. The promotion held its first card on June 4, 1968, and got a television deal with Fuji TV in the same year.

In the fall of 1970, AJW, which had been contesting the American Girls&#x27; Wrestling Association Championship since the previous year, hosted Marie Vagnone, new holder of Mildred Burke&#x27;s WWWA World Single Championship which had been revived in a WWWA tournament earlier that year in Los Angeles. On October 15, 1970, in Tokyo, Vagnone lost the WWWA title to Aiko Kyo, and AJW had a new world championship singles belt. The next year, AJW acquired the WWWA World Tag Team Championship as well, when Jumbo Miyamoto and Aiko Kyo were made the first champions on June 30, 1971.

During the early 1970s, AJW&#x27;s championship booking was dominated by the traditional trading between a Japanese face and a foreign (usually North American) heel. The tag belt, for example, was traded fifty-six times between 1971 and 1975, each time between a Japanese team and an American team. This pattern began to change in 1975 with the new stardom of Mach Fumiake and the Beauty Pair (Jackie Sato and Maki Ueda). On March 19, 1975, Mach Fumiake won the WWWA Championship from Jumbo Miyamoto, breaking the pattern in the singles division. After that, only three non-Japanese women ever won the belt, the Canadian Monster Ripper, on July 31, 1979, and March 15, 1980, the Mexican La Galactica, on May 7, 1983, and the American Amazing Kong, on June 4, 2004.

On July 6, 1980, the promotion had enough popularity to run more shows throughout the country, which resulted in AJW splitting into two teams. Team A featured wrestlers such as Jackie Sato, Jaguar Yokota and Mimi Hagiwara while Team B featured Nancy Kumi, Lucy Kayama and Chino Sato. This lasted until June 1981.

During the 1980s, AJW continued to feature extraordinarily talented and popular female wrestlers, including Wrestling Observer Newsletter (WON) Hall of Famers, Bull Nakano, Jaguar Yokota, Devil Masami, Dump Matsumoto, and the Crush Gals (Chigusa Nagayo and Lioness Asuka). The feud between the pop culture sensations, the Crush Gals, and the heel stable, Gokuaku Domei, led by Matsumoto, was possibly the most popular angle in all of Japanese wrestling during the 1980s, bringing very high ratings to AJW&#x27;s weekly television program which caused the show be aired during prime-time. This also resulted in record numbers of girls wanting to become wrestlers with the 1984 auditions having 2,000 candidates.

Up until 1986, AJW had been the only major women&#x27;s wrestling (&quot;joshi puroresu&quot; or simply &quot;joshi&quot;) promotion in Japan. Then, on August 17, 1986, Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling (JWP) was started, by former AJW stars Jackie Sato and Nancy Kumi, as well as boxer Rumi Kazama and others. As All Japan Women&#x27;s popularity cooled off after the Crush Gals retired, the promotion&#x27;s television show was moved to midnight.

While AJW remained the top promotion through the early 1990s, due to talent including Akira Hokuto, Aja Kong, Manami Toyota and Kyoko Inoue, the number of &quot;joshi puroresu&quot; promotions kept increasing, with Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling and JWP forming in 1992 after the collapse of Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling. This created an unprecedented era of co-operation between the various companies which resulted in many inter-promotional shows including Big Egg Wrestling Universe, the first ever all women&#x27;s show at the Tokyo Dome. Competition increased again as Gaea Japan formed in 1995 and JDStar formed in 1996 with both promotions having former All Japan Women&#x27;s stars including Chigusa Nagayo, Akira Hokuto, Lioness Asuka and Jaguar Yokota.

1997 would prove to be a nightmare year for All Japan Women as the owners of All Japan Women&#x27;s went bankrupt after losing money in real estate, the stock market and other business ventures. Due to this, they lost 14 wrestlers from July to September 1997. Kyoko Inoue, Etsuko Mita, Mima Shimoda, Chaparita Asari, Yoshiko Tamura and others left to form NEO Japan Ladies Pro-Wrestling. Toshiyo Yamada left for Gaea Japan. Aja Kong, Mariko Yoshida, Reggie Bennett, Yumi Fukawa and Rie Tamada left to form Arsion. In October 1997, the promotion&#x27;s building which held the AJW office, the wrestler dormitories, the training area, the garage (where small events were sometimes held) and a restaurant where the younger wrestlers worked was handed over to creditors. In October, they also lost their television show on Fuji TV which they later regained in July 1998.

In 2002, AJW lost its television spot again and the promotion closed its doors in April 2005 after 37 years, making it the longest-running promotion in Japan up to that time (Men&#x27;s promotions New Japan Pro Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling have since reached 50 years as of 2022).

Promotion company Tajima Kikaku re-established &quot;New&quot; AJW in 2006, however they only acquired the rights to the promotion&#x27;s name and logo from the Matsunaga family, not the titles. The talent was mostly borrowed from JWP Project and the cards were sporadic. In 2012 the &quot;New&quot; AJW stopped promoting cards.

== Events ==
The most notable annual events in AJW were the &quot;Japan Grand Prix&quot; and &quot;Tag League the Best&quot;. The &quot;Japan Grand Prix&quot; was held each summer, from 1985 to 2004, and was a tournament to determine the number one contender for the WWWA World Single Championship, similar to the G1 Climax or Champion Carnival seen in the men&#x27;s promotions New Japan Pro-Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling, respectively. &quot;Tag League the Best&quot; was held each fall, also from 1985 to 2004, and was a tag team tournament.

AJW also held several regular annual events during the 1990s. The first was &quot;Wrestlemarinpiad&quot;, which was held in the fall or spring from 1989 to 1997, and for the last time in 2000. Also prominent was &quot;Wrestling Queendom&quot;, held from 1993 to 1997, the first held in November and the rest in the end of March.

<text>Paul Franklin Crouch /kraʊtʃ/ (March 30, 1934 – November 30, 2013) was an American televangelist. Crouch and his wife, Jan, founded the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) in 1973; the company has been described as &quot;the world’s largest religious television network.&quot;

==Biography==
Crouch was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, the third son of oft-traveling Assemblies of God missionaries, Andrew F. Crouch (January 7, 1889 – June 1, 1941) and wife, the former Sara Swingle (September 26, 1891 – September 29, 1976). Crouch had two older brothers, the Rev. Philip Crouch (1918–2005), and John Mark Crouch (1923–1991). Crouch, whose father died when he was seven years old, was mainly raised by his mother with the help of his grandparents. He soon became interested in amateur radio and announced he would use such technology to send the Gospel around the world. He graduated from the Central Bible College (Assemblies of God) in Springfield, Missouri in 1955 with a degree in theology.

Crouch also received three honorary doctorates: a Doctor of Litterarum (D.Litt.) on May 29, 1981, from the California Graduate School of Theology, Glendale, California; a Doctor of Divinity on May 29, 1983, from the American Christian Theological Seminary, Anaheim, California; and a Doctor of Laws degree on May 5, 1985, from Oral Roberts University, Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Crouch and Janice Bethany met in 1957 and were married in Missouri. They have two sons, Paul Crouch, Jr. and Matthew Crouch.

===Early broadcasting career===
Crouch began his career in broadcasting by helping to build an educational AM station (KCBI) on campus while a student at Central Bible Institute and Seminary. In 1957 he became a radio announcer at KRSD in Rapid City, South Dakota, and progressed rapidly to program director. Shortly thereafter he was promoted to manager of sister station KRSD-TV, the NBC affiliate in Rapid City.

In 1961, he was appointed by the general council of the Assemblies of God to organize and operate their newly formed Department of Television and Film Production in Burbank, California, a position he held for four years. Crouch was responsible for the ongoing production of films focusing largely on foreign missions and foreign missionary works, as well as the Assemblies of God&#x27;s large inventory of audiovisual materials and children&#x27;s teaching aids.

From 1965 to 1970 Crouch was general manager of KREL radio in Corona, California. In 1966, he purchased a minority stock interest in KREL. During his time at KREL, he successfully completed the station&#x27;s application for an increase in power to 5,000 watts.

After leaving KREL in 1970, Crouch was invited to serve as general manager for KHOF-FM and KHOF-TV in San Bernardino, California.

===Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) history===

Crouch left KHOF in 1973 and with his wife, Jan, founded the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) along with Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker (the Bakkers left in 1975). In 1974, TBN purchased its first TV station, KLXA-TV (now KTBN-TV). Since then, TBN has grown to become the United States&#x27; largest Christian television network, and the third largest group owner of broadcast TV stations in the U.S., with CBS, FOX, and NBC holding fourth, fifth and sixth place, according to TV News Check&#x27;s annual listing of the Top 30 Station Groups. Forbes.com indicated that Paul F. Crouch had compensation of $402,244 in the Fiscal Year ending on 12/31/08.

TBN is viewed globally on 70 satellites and over 18,000 TV and cable affiliates. TBN is also seen on the web globally. TBN is carried on over 287 television stations in the U.S. and on thousands of other cable television and satellite systems around the world in over 75 countries, where their programming is translated into over eleven languages. He was also executive producer for such Christian films as &quot;China Cry&quot; (1990), &quot;The Omega Code&quot; (1999), &quot;&quot; (2001), &quot;&quot; (2001), and &quot;Time Changer&quot; (2002).

In the U.S., TBN&#x27;s coverage grew through agreements with national cable operators. TBN is viewed via major cable and satellite companies such as Comcast, Cox, Time Warner, Verizon FIOS, DirecTV, AT&amp;T, Dish Network, and Charter.

In addition to TBN, Crouch and his wife developed and oversaw operations for TBN&#x27;s affiliated television networks: Smile of a Child – children&#x27;s channel, JCTV – youth network, The Church Channel, TBN Enlace USA – Spanish language network, TBNE-Italian, The Healing Channel – Arabic language network, TBN-Russia, TBN Nejat TV – Persian-language channel, and TBN-HD, TBN&#x27;s new high definition network.

===Death===
Crouch died at his home in Orange, California, on November 30, 2013, after 10 years with degenerative heart disease.

==Criticisms and controversies==
In 2000, Crouch was sued for $40 million by author Sylvia Fleener, who accused Crouch of plagiarism in his popular end-times novel (and subsequent movie), &quot;The Omega Code&quot;. Fleener&#x27;s lawsuit alleged that the movie&#x27;s plot was taken from her own novel, &quot;The Omega Syndrome&quot;. A former Crouch personal assistant, Kelly Whitmore, revealed that she had encountered a loose-leaf binder in Jan Crouch&#x27;s luggage that the Crouches referred to as &quot;the End Times project&quot; and that he often called it &quot;The Omega&quot; but said he disliked the working title, &quot;especially the word &#x27;Syndrome&#x27;. After the defendant&#x27;s motion for summary judgment failed the case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.

In September 2004, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that in 1998 Crouch paid Enoch Lonnie Ford, a former employee, a $425,000 formal settlement to end a wrongful termination lawsuit. The paper also reported that Ford had alleged a sexual relationship between the two men. TBN officials denied the allegations. On March 15, 2005, Ford appeared at the taping of the ION Television show &quot;Lie Detector&quot;. The show&#x27;s producers decided not to air the show, and the outcome of the lie detector test was never released.

A May 2012 &quot;New York Times&quot; article reported on the personal spending of Paul and Jan Crouch, including &quot;his-and-her mansions one street apart in a gated community&quot; in Newport Beach, California. Paul Crouch received $400,000 in executive salary as president and his wife $365,000 as first vice president of TBN. Brittany Koper, a granddaughter of the Crouches who had authority over finances, claimed that TBN appeared to have violated the IRS ban on &quot;excess compensation&quot; by nonprofit organizations.

<text>Janice Wendell Crouch () (née Bethany; May 14, 1938 – May 31, 2016) was an American religious broadcaster. Crouch and her husband, Paul, founded the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) in 1973.

==Early life and ministry==
Crouch was the daughter of Reverend and Mrs. Edgar W. Bethany, and grew up in Columbus, Georgia. Her father served as an Assemblies of God pastor, and was the founding president of Southeastern University (Florida). While attending Evangel College in Springfield, Missouri, Crouch met Paul F. Crouch. They married in 1957, and have two sons, Paul Jr. and Matthew. Jan Crouch also loved children and was well known in the early days of TBN for a child&#x27;s puppet (a little pink girl in a dress) she called Babushka.

==TBN==

===Founding===
In 1973, Paul and Jan Crouch co-founded Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) along with Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker (the Bakkers left in 1975). In 1974, TBN purchased its first TV station, KLXA-TV (channel 40, now KTBN-TV) in Southern California, and began distribution through cable systems in 1978. Under the Crouch family, TBN grew to become the United States&#x27; largest Christian television network, offering 24-hour commercial-free programming, and TBN is currently the third-largest over-the-air station group in the United States (measured as percentage of homes reached), with CBS, Fox, and NBC holding the 4th, 5th and 6th place, according to TV News Check&#x27;s annual listing of the Top 30 station groups.

===Growth of TBN===
Since its founding, Crouch served as TBN&#x27;s vice president and director of network programming, as well as the director of programming for TBN&#x27;s affiliated networks, such as the Smile of a Child children&#x27;s channel, the JUCE TV youth network, The Church Channel, the TBN Enlace USA Spanish language network, and others. She was also the President and manager of The Holy Land Experience theme park in Orlando, Florida. Jan Crouch and her husband Paul Crouch, senior also signed off on Matt Crouch (TBN) and his wife Laurie—now in charge at TBN, i.e. PTL (&quot;Praise the Lord&quot;) their signature &amp; original show, as now becoming rather the primary hosts, as well as &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot;— to have produced over 4 plus major motion pictures, along with other associated and film entertainment groups to make namely Faith-based movies like &#x27;End Times&#x27; films &quot;The Omega Code&quot; (1999) and its sequel &quot;Megiddo: The Omega Code 2&quot; (2001).

==Lawsuits==

In March 2012, Crouch was accused by her granddaughter, a former employee and chief finance director of the network (a registered charity), of misappropriating network funds to spend on a lavish lifestyle. Expenditures included expensive homes, private jets, massive custom wigs, numerous face lifts and breast augmentations and a $100,000 air conditioned mobile home solely for her dogs. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Crouch, for nearly two years, rented adjoining rooms for herself and her two Maltese dogs at the deluxe Loews Portofino Bay Hotel while she was building the Holy Land Experience theme park in Orlando, Florida. The suit includes allegations that Jan had an affair with a Holy Land Experience employee.

Also in 2012, another of Crouch&#x27;s granddaughters sued TBN, alleging that she had been molested and raped by a TBN employee at the age of 13. She alleged that Jan Crouch screamed at her and blamed her for the assault. The employee was subsequently fired but was never reported to authorities. Crouch&#x27;s lawyers said the network was attempting to cover it up to prevent a scandal, but a spokesperson for the network said they acted on what her mother had told them to do. In 2017, a year after Crouch&#x27;s death, a jury awarded the granddaughter $2 million in damages for past and future &quot;mental suffering.&quot;

==Illness and death==
Crouch suffered a massive stroke on May 25, 2016, and was hospitalized. She died in Orlando, Florida, on May 31, 2016, at age 78.

==Awards and honors==
* 1990: Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Oral Roberts University
* Golden Angel Award – Excellence in Media
* Two-time Parents Television Council Entertainment Seal of Approval recipient (for TBN and Smile of a Child).

<text>Gernikako Arbola (&#x27;the Tree of Gernika&#x27; in Basque) is an oak tree that symbolizes traditional freedoms for the Biscayan people, and by extension for the Basque people as a whole.
It is located in Guernica, Biscay, Basque Country, Spain.
The Lords of Biscay (including kings of Castile and Carlist pretenders to the throne) swore to respect the Biscayan liberties under it, and the modern Lehendakari of the Basque Country swears his charge there.

==Dynasty==
In the Middle Ages, representatives of the villages of Biscay would hold assemblies under local big trees. As time passed, the role of separate assemblies was superseded by the Guernica Assembly in 1512, and its oak would acquire a symbolic meaning, with actual assemblies being held in a purpose-built hermitage-house (the current building dates from 1833). It was the Spanish regent Maria Christina accompanied by her infant daughter Queen Isabella II the last Spanish monarch to swear an oath to the &quot;charters&quot; under the iconic oak in 1839.

The known specimens form a dynasty:
* &quot;the father&quot;, planted in the 14th century, lasted 450 years
* the &quot;old tree&quot; (1742–1892), re-planted in 1811. The trunk now is held in a templet in the surrounding garden.
* the third (1858–2004), re-planted in 1860, survived the Bombing of Guernica in 1937 but had to be replaced because of a fungus. The gardeners of the Biscayan government keep several spare trees grown from the tree&#x27;s acorns.

The Tree of Gernika came to prominence during the First and Third Carlist Wars as a symbol of Basque liberties, whose renown and appreciation spread among the Basque diaspora world over during the late 19th century and mid-20th century thanks to the popularity of Jose Maria Iparragirre&#x27;s namesake anthem. Maria Cristina of Savoy, regent during her daughter Isabel&#x27;s minority in the First Carlist War, swore the Basque charters under the Oak in 1839.

The tree&#x27;s significance is illustrated by an event which occurred shortly after the Guernica bombings. When the Francoist troops took the town, the Tercio of Begoña, formed by Carlist volunteers from Biscay, put an armed guard around the tree to protect it against their Falangist allies, who had wanted to fell this symbol of Basque nationalism.
On 26 June 1950, Xavier of Bourbon-Parma, Carlist claimant to the Spanish throne during Franco&#x27;s dictatorial regime, swore the Basque charters in the Oak of Guernica.

An oak tree is depicted on the heraldic arms of Biscay and subsequently on the arms of many of the towns of Biscay. An oak leaf logo is used by the local government of Biscay. The logo of the Basque nationalist party Eusko Alkartasuna has one half red and the other green, the colors of the Basque flag. An old version of the logo of the Basque nationalist youth organisation Jarrai also display oak leaves. The Basque authorities present descendants of the tree as a symbol of friendship to Basque diaspora groups and related cities.

<text>Redcliffe is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, located in the City of Belmont local government area.

The boundaries of the suburb are determined by the Great Eastern Highway, Tonkin Highway and Epsom Avenue, Belmont, and the grounds of the Perth Airport which lie on the eastern edge of the suburb.

The story of its name is ambiguous: while some claim it was named after steep red clay deposits that lined the banks of the Swan River when settlers first arrived, others claim that it was named after the ancestral home of an early settler. The suburb was once a single property near modern-day Water Street and the main house, &quot;Nulsen Haven&quot; still stands today. The local primary school was built in 1908 and at this time, Redcliffe had been transformed from one property into many small farms after being subdivided in 1897.

Modern Redcliffe is a mix of residential, semi-industrial and retail buildings. It is 18 minutes from the Perth central business district and a short walk from the Swan River.

== Transport ==
Redcliffe was previously only served by Transperth bus routes 39 between its terminus on Grand Parade and Elizabeth Quay bus station, and the high frequency route 935 between Perth Airport and Kings Park via the Belmont Forum shopping centre and Perth City, along with several other routes operating along the Great Eastern Highway.

In October 2022, the Redcliffe railway station opened as part of the Airport line. The station provides a rail link to High Wycombe to the east via Perth Airport, and Claremont station to the west via Perth. It also resulted in changes for bus routes in the area. Route 935 was changed to terminate at Redcliffe station instead of Perth Airport, while also operating a more direct route along Stanton Road instead of Johnson Street and Treffone Street. Route 39 was extended to operate to the railway station, serving the aforementioned streets instead of the 935. A new high frequency route, the 940, travels directly to the Perth CBD via the Great Eastern Highway along the north part of the suburb. Route 293 travels to High Wycombe railway station and provided a connection between Stanton Road and Great Eastern Highway via Epsom Avenue. Other services to the Redcliffe station include the 290 and 291, which connect to Midland railway station, and the 292, which operates as a circular route to the Perth Airport Terminals 3 &amp; 4 from Redcliffe Station to replace routes which previously travelled to the Airport such as the 935. This route is usually operated by buses equipped with luggage racks for passenger convenience.

===Bus===
Redcliffe is served by these Transperth bus routes:

<text>Max Pruss (13 September 1891 – 28 November 1960) was the captain of the Zeppelin LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot; on its last voyage and a surviving crew member of the disaster.

==Biography==
Max Pruss was born in 1891 in Sgonn, East Prussia (now Zgon, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland). He joined the German Navy in 1906 and completed airship training during World War I, serving as an elevatorman on the German Zeppelins. Pruss became part of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; crew in 1936 on the third flight to Rio de Janeiro. During his career, he flew 171 times over the Atlantic. The final flight of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; was May 3–6, 1937, and it was Pruss&#x27; first flight as commanding Captain of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;. According to &quot;Airships.net&quot; he was a member of the NSDAP. He died at age 69.

==&quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster==

Pruss was commander of the airship during the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster of 6 May 1937. This was his first time commanding a trip to Lakehurst. Pruss and several crew members rode the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; down to the ground as it burned, then ordered everybody out. He carried radio operator Willy Speck out of the wreckage, then looked for survivors until rescuers were forced to restrain him. Pruss suffered extensive burns and had to be taken out by ambulance to Paul Kimball Hospital in Lakewood. The burns were so severe that he was given last rites, but although his face was disfigured for the rest of his life, his condition improved over the next few months. Pruss was unable to testify at investigative committees, but officially he was not held responsible.

Pruss, along with other airship crewmen, maintained that the disaster was caused by sabotage, and dismissed the possibility that it was sparked by lightning or static electricity. Although Master Zeppelin Captain Hugo Eckener did not rule out other causes, he criticized Pruss&#x27; decision to carry out the landing in poor weather conditions, expressing his belief that sharp turns ordered by Pruss during the landing approach may have caused gas to leak, which could have been ignited by static electricity. Pruss insisted that such turns were normal procedure, and that the stern heaviness experienced during the approach was normal due to rainwater being displaced at the tail. It has been suggested that Pruss maintained his belief of sabotage because of guilt or to maintain his own credibility and that of the airship business.

==After the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;==
Pruss returned to Germany around October 1937, where he served as commandant of Frankfurt Airport as World War II broke out. By this time he was already urging the modernization of Germany&#x27;s remaining Zeppelin fleet, and during a 1940 visit by Hermann Göring to Frankfurt Airport this was the subject of an alleged quarrel between Pruss and Göring. In the 1950s Pruss tried to raise money for new Zeppelin construction, citing the comfort and luxury of this mode of transportation. He died in 1960 of pneumonia after a stomach operation. Pruss did not see his dream realized, as his death was over 30 years before the construction of a new airship at the Friedrichshafen complex by Zeppelin Neue Technologie (NT).

==Portrayals==
In the 1975 film, &quot;The Hindenburg&quot;, Pruss was portrayed by Charles Durning. This portrayal is inaccurate because Pruss is portrayed as ignoring the advice of the 2nd Captain Ernst Lehmann, who only traveled as an observer, saying &quot;I&#x27;ll do the worrying on this trip&quot;. In the docudrama &quot;&quot; he was portrayed by Albert Welling. In the 2011 RTL television movie he is portrayed by Jürgen Schornagel.

The &quot;Hindenburg&quot; is featured in the series &quot;Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction&quot; as the setting of a story in which a married couple ride on the airship while recounting to friends of theirs how years ago they escaped certain death when they missed a trip on the doomed Passenger Liner &quot;RMS Lusitania&quot;.

In the pilot episode of the TV series &quot;Timeless&quot; Pruss was featured but not mentioned by name.

<doc id="1018994" wikidata="Q2865024" url="?curid=1018994" title="Arthur Boyd">
<text>Arthur Merric Bloomfield Boyd (24 July 1920 – 24 April 1999) was a leading Australian painter of the middle to late 20th century. Boyd&#x27;s work ranges from impressionist renderings of Australian landscape to starkly expressionist figuration, and many canvases feature both. Several famous works set Biblical stories against the Australian landscape, such as &quot;The Expulsion&quot; (1947–48), now at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Having a strong social conscience, Boyd&#x27;s work deals with humanitarian issues and universal themes of love, loss and shame.

Boyd was a member of the Antipodeans, a group of Melbourne painters that also included Clifton Pugh, David Boyd, John Brack, Robert Dickerson, John Perceval and Charles Blackman.

The Boyd family line of successive and connective artists includes painters, sculptors, architects and other arts professionals, commencing with Boyd&#x27;s grandmother Emma Minnie Boyd and her husband Arthur Merric Boyd, Boyd&#x27;s father Merric and mother Doris; &#x27;She was the backbone of the family&#x27; recalls Boyd &quot;without her, the entire family would have fallen apart&quot;, uncle Penleigh Boyd (and his son, Arthur&#x27;s cousin, Robin), uncle Martin Boyd, and siblings Guy, David and Lucy. His other sister Mary Boyd, married first John Perceval, and then later Sidney Nolan, both artists. Boyd&#x27;s wife, Yvonne Boyd (&quot;née&quot; Lennie) is also a painter; as are their children Jamie, Polly, and Lucy.

In 1993, Arthur and Yvonne Boyd gave family properties comprising at Bundanon on the Shoalhaven River to the people of Australia. Held in trust, Boyd later donated further property, artwork, and the copyright to all of his work.

==Early years and background==
Boyd was born at Murrumbeena, Victoria, the son of Doris Boyd and her husband Merric, both potters and painters. Boyd&#x27;s sisters Lucy and Mary were both artists as well as both of Boyd&#x27;s younger brothers; David was a painter, and Guy a sculptor. After leaving school aged 14 years, Boyd briefly attended night classes at the National Gallery School in Melbourne where Jewish immigrant artist Yosl Bergner introduced Boyd to writers such as Dostoyevsky and Kafka and influenced his humanitarian values and social conscience. Boyd later spent some time living on the Mornington Peninsula at Rosebud with his grandfather, the landscape painter Arthur Merric Boyd, a primary guide to the formation of his talent. Early paintings were portraits and of seascapes of Port Phillip created while he was an adolescent, living in the suburbs of Melbourne. He moved to the inner city where he was influenced by his contact with European refugees. Reflecting this move in the late 1930s, his work moved into a distinct period of depictions of fanciful characters in urban settings.

==Career==
===Military service===
Boyd (Service number V101720) was 20 when conscripted to serve in the militia from 12 May 1941 until 25 March 1944. Initially serving with the 2nd Cavalry Division, which later became the 2nd Armoured Division (Australia), Boyd was transferred to the 4th Division (Australia) for full time service, and then Army Headquarters Cartography Company. Boyd predominantly served in the Bendigo area as a cartographer. Boyd&#x27;s expressionistic wartime paintings included images of disabled people and those considered unfit to serve. These works have been described as depicting &quot;the dispossessed and the outcast&quot;.
===Artistic career===
Following the war, Boyd, together with John Perceval founded a workshop at Murrumbeena and turned to pottery, a medium he associated with his father. Later came ceramic painting and sculpture. Although Boyd was the closest of friends with Albert Tucker, Joy Hester and Sidney Nolan and the art patrons John and Sunday Reed, the modernist Heide Circle and its hierarchical structure did not beckon him overtly as his position in the Boyd family gave him the fullest identity in itself.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Boyd traveled to Victoria&#x27;s Wimmera country and to Central Australia including Alice Springs and his work turned towards landscape paintings. During this period, perhaps his best-known work comes from his &quot;Love, Marriage and Death of a Half-Caste Bride&quot; series of 31 paintings, also known as &quot;The Bride&quot;, that imagined an Aboriginal person of mixed descent as a neglected outsider. First exhibited in Melbourne in April 1958, the series met a mixed reaction, as it did later that year in Adelaide and Sydney. Following the 1999 acquisition of &quot;Reflected Bride 1&quot; by the National Gallery of Australia, the gallery&#x27;s director Brian Kennedy commented in 2002:

In 1956, Boyd&#x27;s ceramic sculpture &#x27;Olympic Pylon&#x27; was installed in the forecourt of the Melbourne Olympic Swimming Pool.

===Relocates to Europe===
Boyd represented Australia with Arthur Streeton at the Venice Biennale in 1958, where his &quot;Bride&quot; series was well received.

He was affiliated with the Antipodeans, a group of painters founded in 1959 and supported by Australian art historian Bernard Smith, who tried to promote figurative art when abstract painting and sculpture was dominant. The group exhibited at the Whitechapel gallery in London. In 1959 Boyd and his family moved to London, where he remained until 1971. In London, he started receiving commissions for ballet and opera set designs, and, after taking up etching and returning to ceramic painting, in 1966 he began the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; series in response to the Vietnam War as a statement of the human condition. While in London, Boyd entered another distinct period with his works themed around the idea of metamorphosis.

He produced several series of works, including a collection of fifteen biblical paintings based on the teaching of his mother, Doris. Later he produced a tempera series about large areas of sky and land, called the Wimmera series.

===Return to Australia===
The recipient of a Creative Arts Fellowship from the Australian National University, in 1971 Boyd and his family returned to Australia as one of Australia&#x27;s most highly regarded artists. In 1975, Boyd donated several thousand works including pastels, sculptures, ceramics, etchings, tapestries, paintings and drawings to the National Gallery of Australia.

In 1978, Arthur and Yvonne Boyd purchased properties and settled permanently at Bundanon on the Shoalhaven River. The following year, ABC TV and BBC TV co-produced the television documentary film, &quot;A Man of Two Worlds&quot;, based on Boyd&#x27;s life and work. During the latter part of Boyd&#x27;s painting career, his landscape works were based on the Shoalhaven River. At first encounter, Boyd was a little overwhelmed to paint the area; he found the scenery rugged and wild, vastly different from the landscapes he knew. But over the years, painting scenes of the Shoalhaven River and the surrounding bushland, he befriended the formidable landscape. This resulted in a significant series of paintings that are not simply landscapes but rather, a fusion of Boyd&#x27;s European and Australian backgrounds.

&quot;His &quot;Australian scapegoat&quot; paintings of the 1980s explored constructions of Australian identity in the lead up to the bicentenary of the arrival of the First Fleet in 1988. With their violent imagery and aggressive colouring they draw on archetypes of Australian military history to suggest the futility of war. In addition to painting, Boyd worked prolifically in ceramics, designed sets for the theatre, and provided illustrations for the poems of Australian poet Peter Porter.&quot;Boyd donated a villa in Tuscany to the Australia Council for an artist-in-residence program in 1982. In 1984, he was commissioned to design a tapestry based on the painting &quot;Untitled (Shoalhaven Landscape)&quot; for the Great Hall at the new Parliament House in Canberra. The work is one of the world&#x27;s largest tapestries. Yet Boyd could not find the strength to fight for the retention of the lower rectangle ablated by the building consultants. This tapestry was produced in the Victorian Tapestry Workshop, Melbourne. He also produced sixteen canvasses for the foyer of the Victorian Arts Centre in the same year.

Boyd again represented Australia at the 1988 Venice Biennale with eight major works; and at the 2000 Venice Biennale. Boyd was commissioned to paint &quot;Earth and Fire&quot; for the cover of the 28 November 1988 &quot;Time&quot; magazine special issue dealing with environmental conservation in Australia.

===Final years===
A major retrospective of Boyd&#x27;s work was exhibited at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1993.

In 1997 for the first time Boyd exhibited together with the six members of his artistic dynasty under one roof; with brothers David and Guy, son Jamie, and nieces Lenore and Tessa Perceval. The exhibition entitled the &quot;Best of Boyd&quot; comprised 80 paintings and 40 bronze sculptures. The exhibition was held in Galeria Aniela Fine Art Gallery and Sculpture Park, NSW. Documentary reviews were shown on the ABC TV Australian National News, 18 May 1997 and the ABC TV &quot;Sunday Afternoon&quot;, June 1997. 
Boyd died in 1999 at 78 years of age, and was buried at Brighton General Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Yvonne, their son Jamie, and daughters Polly and Lucy.

==Bundanon Trust==
In 1993 the Australian Government accepted the gift of Bundanon, valued at the time at A$20 million. The property owned by Arthur and Yvonne Boyd was given to the people of Australia. Located approximately west of Nowra, the gift was entrusted to the Bundanon Trust, along with further gifts by Boyd, including copyright of all of his artwork, and several thousand works of art from five generations of Boyds, and other Australian artists. These properties provide an environment that promotes visual arts, writing, music and other performing arts, and the promotion of education and research in the arts.

==Technique==
Boyd was a master at manipulating elements to express himself. He developed new techniques when he was still a teenager and later changed technique depending on his preferred style, media, location and what he was depicting.

He would often use loose strokes of thickly coated brushes. He applied paint with his fingers and palm because it is quicker, while the body contact directly connected him with the painting. He believed this allowed for a greater sense of freedom and pleasure from the act of painting.

==Honours and awards==
Boyd was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 1 January 1970 for services to art. On 26 January 1979, Boyd was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for service to the visual arts. In recognition of his service to the visual arts and to the development of Australian artists and crafts people, Boyd was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia on 8 June 1992.

In 1995, the Prime Minister announced Boyd as Australian of the Year for his contribution to Australian art and his generosity to the Australian people.

Australia Post honoured Boyd in 1998 with a series of postage stamps produced with his photo and examples of his work.

<doc id="1018998" wikidata="Q125743874" url="?curid=1018998" title="General Leo">
<text>more commonly referred to as General Leo, is a character introduced in the 1994 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; by Square Enix. An honorable soldier in the game&#x27;s Gestahlian Empire that refused the magical energy infusion given to his compatriots, he appears in the first half of the game helping to ensure his Emperor&#x27;s expansionist goals and is betrayed in the end. He has since appeared in other games related to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, including &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia&quot;, where he is voiced by Masashi Sugawara.

Despite being a temporarily playable character, Leo was well received for his characterization and charisma, with players trying to find ways to revive him or make him a fully playable character. He was additionally seen as a contrasting element to the game&#x27;s final villain, Kefka, representing hope for a better world in light of the latter&#x27;s representation of despair. His role as a catalyst for the story&#x27;s progression has also been analyzed, and how it shaped both how Kefka was perceived but also the resolve of the protagonists to oppose the Empire. His appearance meanwhile has been read by the former staff of &quot;1UP.com&quot; to be racially coded as a black person, and they considered him one of the first examples of a black character in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise.

==Appearances==
General Leo Christophe is introduced in the 1994 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. He is one of the three top generals of the game&#x27;s antagonist Gestahlian Empire, the others being fellow characters Celes Chere and Kefka Palazzo. He has the unique ability Shock, which creates a large area of effect explosion. Unlike his compatriots, he refused to be infused with magical energy, and instead relies on his own talent. He is first seen at the Empire&#x27;s siege of the kingdom of Doma. Not wanting to see men on either side needlessly killed, he refuses an all out attack against Doma. Kefka on the other hand sees this as weakness and argues with him, and when Leo is called back to the Empire on urgent business, Kefka poisons the kingdom&#x27;s water supply, killing almost everyone inside and ending the conflict.

Later in the game he appears when the Empire offers peace to help find the home of the Espers, a race of magical beings. Attempting to atone for the Empire&#x27;s past crimes against the protagonists, he joins with them as they travel to the town of Thamasa to open the gate to the Esper&#x27;s domain. However, they discover it was a ruse by the Emperor, as Kefka and his soldiers arrive to capture the Espers for their magical energy and attack the town. Enraged, Leo attacks and defeats Kefka, only to discover it was an illusion as he is stabbed in the back by the real Kefka and killed. After the attack, the survivors bury his body, and the protagonists resolve to stop the Kefka and the Empire.

In other games, he appears as a playable character in both &quot;Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy Record Keeper&quot;. He is additionally a playable character in &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia&quot;, where he is voiced by Masashi Sugawara. Set after the events of &quot;VI&quot;, he reflects on his death and past with the Empire, now that he has no ruler to follow. Outside of video games, cards representing Leo have been produced for the &quot;Final Fantasy Trading Card Game&quot;.

==Conception and design==
&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was developed with the mindset that none of the playable cast was the protagonist, and that each of them were equally the &quot;main character&quot;. The cast of characters were selected from submissions from across the development team. Once the cast was selected, each individual would write their character&#x27;s story, with Yoshinori Kitase balancing the plot as things developed. The character was originally intended to be a full party member, but the idea was cut during development.

Standing 188 cm (6 ft 2 in) tall, artist Yoshitaka Amano was commissioned to design the characters from the brief outlines provided. Given full creative freedom, Amano wanted to make &quot;real&quot; and &quot;alive&quot; characters, though with consideration for their representation in-game as small computer sprites. Said graphics were designed by Nomura, who drew the chibi artwork of the characters, and Kazuko Shibuya, who designed the in-game sprites. His appearance is as a tall, dark skinned man with a yellow mohawk, prominent yellow lips, and a green military uniform with yellow and orange highlights.

==Critical reception==
Since his debut, the character was positively received. &quot;Dengeki Online&quot;″s Kawachi expressed how much he enjoyed Leo as a character, finding him very charismatic and expecting he would be a full party member in the game. However, Leo&#x27;s sacrifice took him by surprise, and as much as he enjoyed using the character briefly, he felt it served as a powerful motivator for the game&#x27;s story due to how it encouraged Terra and the other protagonists&#x27; resolve to overthrow the Empire. Meanwhile the staff of &quot;Futabanet Manga Plus&quot;, in a retrospective, cited him as one of the franchise&#x27;s poignant examples of self-sacrifice. They further praised how much humanity his character demonstrated in the story, and how much it left a lasting impact on players. Leo&#x27;s portrayal and role as a temporary party member lead to players trying to figure out how to revive him or make him a permanent companion, resulting in players trying to glitch the game to keep him alive and usable beyond the sequence.

In a podcast discussion examining the characters of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; for &quot;RPGFan&quot;, journalist Michael Sollosi compared Leo&#x27;s character to Kefka&#x27;s, describing him as an &quot;extremely likable soldier&quot; trying to make the world a better place and atone for the Empire&#x27;s actions, while Kefka revels in them. He saw Leo as representing a recurring theme of &quot;hope&quot; in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, in his context the hope for a better unified world. Through this scope, Kefka&#x27;s killing of him in a brutal manner represented despair killing hope for Sollosi, elevating both his character but also the heroes as a last light of hope against Kefka. Fellow writer Alana Hagues liked his conflicted character of being honorable while serving the game&#x27;s villain, and expressed confusion as to why the Empire would back Kefka over him in their ambitions. In later podcasts discussing the game, the staff of &quot;RPGFan&quot; further analyzed his character, noting that he was an important element of Terra accepting her nature, but also served as a more humanizing aspect of the Empire, giving some faith to the player that they may be able to reform.

Sebastian Deken in his book examining &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and its themes cited Leo&#x27;s death as a turning point in how players perceived Kefka as a character. While previously he was portrayed more comedic and bumbling personality, killing Leo made him &quot;irredeemable&quot;, and any &quot;comic relief or lighthearted mischief—or humanity—is excised&quot; from Kefka&#x27;s character afterwards. Most notability too Leo&#x27;s death is the last use of Kefka&#x27;s more melancholic theme, an aspect that Deken felt reflected the end of the comedic aspect and his character&#x27;s shift to full villainy in the eyes of the audience.

Leo&#x27;s appearance has also been of some discussion. Kawachi upon controlling the character and seeing his portrait admitted they were shocked, moreso than by his death. He had expected a more handsome character due to how Leo acted, and joked &quot;you could say that it taught me that a man is not a face. A man&#x27;s charm isn&#x27;t his appearance!&quot; Meanwhile, the former staff of &quot;1UP.com&quot; in their &quot;Retronauts&quot; podcast read him to be racially coded as black due to his skin tone and prominent lips, which would have made him in their eyes one of the first instances of a black character in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise.

<text>In mathematics, a Dirac measure assigns a size to a set based solely on whether it contains a fixed element &quot;x&quot; or not. It is one way of formalizing the idea of the Dirac delta function, an important tool in physics and other technical fields.

==Definition==
A Dirac measure is a measure on a set (with any -algebra of subsets of ) defined for a given and any (measurable) set by
:formula_1
where is the indicator function of .

The Dirac measure is a probability measure, and in terms of probability it represents the almost sure outcome in the sample space . We can also say that the measure is a single atom at ; however, treating the Dirac measure as an atomic measure is not correct when we consider the sequential definition of Dirac delta, as the limit of a delta sequence. The Dirac measures are the extreme points of the convex set of probability measures on .

The name is a back-formation from the Dirac delta function; considered as a Schwartz distribution, for example on the real line, measures can be taken to be a special kind of distribution. The identity
:formula_2
which, in the form
:formula_3
is often taken to be part of the definition of the &quot;delta function&quot;, holds as a theorem of Lebesgue integration.

==Properties of the Dirac measure==
Let denote the Dirac measure centred on some fixed point in some measurable space .
* is a probability measure, and hence a finite measure.

Suppose that is a topological space and that is at least as fine as the Borel -algebra on .
* is a strictly positive measure if and only if the topology is such that lies within every non-empty open set, e.g. in the case of the trivial topology .
* Since is probability measure, it is also a locally finite measure.
* If is a Hausdorff topological space with its Borel -algebra, then satisfies the condition to be an inner regular measure, since singleton sets such as are always compact. Hence, is also a Radon measure.
* Assuming that the topology is fine enough that is closed, which is the case in most applications, the support of is . (Otherwise, is the closure of in .) Furthermore, is the only probability measure whose support is .
* If is -dimensional Euclidean space with its usual -algebra and -dimensional Lebesgue measure , then is a singular measure with respect to : simply decompose as and and observe that .
* The Dirac measure is a sigma-finite measure.

==Generalizations==
A discrete measure is similar to the Dirac measure, except that it is concentrated at countably many points instead of a single point. More formally, a measure on the real line is called a discrete measure (in respect to the Lebesgue measure) if its support is at most a countable set.

<text>Marpa [[Lotsawa|Lotsāwa]] (, 1012–1097), sometimes known fully as Marpa Chökyi Lodrö (Wylie: mar pa chos kyi blo gros) or commonly as Marpa the Translator (Marpa Lotsāwa), was a Tibetan Buddhist teacher credited with the transmission of many Vajrayana teachings from India, including the teachings and lineages of Mahamudra. Due to this, the Kagyu lineage, which he founded, is often called Marpa Kagyu in his honour.

Although some accounts relate that the Mahasiddha Naropa was the personal teacher of Marpa, other accounts suggest that Marpa held Naropa&#x27;s lineage through intermediary disciples only. Either way, Marpa was a personal student of the Mahasiddha Maitripa and of the dakini Niguma.

==Biography==
Born as Marpa Chökyi Lodrö, in Lhodrak Chukhyer in the southern part of Tibet, to an affluent family, he began studying at a young age but was wild and untamed compared to other children. Marpa first received instruction for three years at Mangkhar with Drokmi Shakya Yeshe and mastered Sanskrit. He decided to travel to India to study with renowned Indian Buddhist masters. His first trip to Nepal and India was in the company of Nyo Lōtsawa, whom he attended as a servant. Marpa returned home to Lhodrak and converted his entire inheritance into gold to fund his travel expenses and to make offerings to teachers.

Marpa journeyed first to Nepal where he studied with Paindapa and Chitherpa, two famous students of Naropa. Paindapa later accompanied Marpa to Pullahari, near Nalanda University, where Naropa taught. Marpa spent twelve years studying with Naropa and other great Indian gurus, most prominently Maitripada. After twelve years he set forth on his journey back to Tibet to teach and continue his dharma activities.

Marpa was to travel to India twice more and Nepal three more times and studied with Naropa and other great teachers including Maitripa. He is said to have stayed in the cave at Phugtal Monastery. On his third visit to India, Naropa, who was engaged in tantric practices, proved difficult to find. However eventually Marpa found him and received the final teachings and instructions from Naropa. It was then that Naropa prophesied that a family lineage would not continue for Marpa, but that his lineage would be carried on by his disciples. Marpa now had received the full transmission, so Naropa formally declared Marpa to be his successor although he had other major disciples including Paindapa, Chitherpa, Shri Shantibhadra or Kukuripa, and Maitripa.

Upon his return to Tibet, Marpa spent many years translating Buddhist scriptures and made a major contribution to the transmission of the complete buddhadharma to Tibet. Marpa continued to practice and give teachings and transmissions to many students in Tibet. After his second visit to India Milarepa became his disciple. After the death of Marpa&#x27;s son, Darma Dode, Milarepa inherited his lineage in full. Marpa lived with his wife Dakmema and their sons in Lhodrak in the southern part of Tibet. Marpa is said to have founded Stongdey Monastery in Zanskar in 1052 CE.

Marpa&#x27;s lineage emphasized the paired systems of the &quot;Six Teachings of Naropa&quot; and the &quot;Great Seal&quot; (Mahamudra). The &quot;Six Teachings of Naropa&quot; included refining techniques of lucid dreaming.

<text>Spaarndam () is a village in the province of North Holland, the Netherlands, on the Spaarne river and the IJ lake. The oldest part of the village, on the western side of the Spaarne, belongs to the municipality of Haarlem; the newer part on the eastern side is a part of the municipality of Haarlemmermeer. The village is built around a dam in the river, which is also the division line of the two municipalities.

Spaarndam was created around a dam where the river Spaarne flows into the IJ. This dam was built here by count Floris V of Holland in 1285. The village collected tolls at this dam, and people made their living from fishing. From 1812 to 1927, the western part of Spaarndam was an independent municipality.

The village has some tourism, and many people commute to Amsterdam and Haarlem.

Spaarndam has always been strongly connected to water. Besides the river and the fishing, it is also famous because of a story within the 1865 American novel, &quot;Hans Brinker or the Silver Skates&quot;, about a Dutch boy, &quot;The Hero of Haarlem,&quot; who stuck his finger in a dike to prevent the town from flooding. The story became a popular legend in America, and in 1950 the local tourist bureau put a statue of this character in Spaarndam.

<text>Baker McKenzie is one of the largest international law firms, headquartered in Chicago. Founded in 1949 under the name Baker &amp; McKenzie, it has 68 offices in 46 countries and employs 4,558 attorneys.

== History ==
Co-founding partner Russell Baker, who had graduated from the University of Chicago Law School, opened his first practice, Baker &amp; Simpson, in Chicago in 1925. The firm provided legal services to the growing Mexican American community in Chicago, which would set a foundation for its global reach.

In 1949 Baker was joined by John McKenzie, a graduate from Loyola University Chicago School of Law, who helped further establish the international practice.

Baker McKenzie became an international firm beginning in 1955, when a lawyer in Venezuela contacted Baker McKenzie about opening a joint venture office in Caracas. Russell Baker&#x27;s son, Donald, moved to Caracas to launch the satellite office. Within the next three years, offices were opened in Washington, D.C., Amsterdam, Brussels, Zürich, New York and São Paulo. By 1978, Baker McKenzie had 26 offices in 20 countries. By 1990, the firm operated 49 offices on six continents, employing around 1500 attorneys, and generating $400 million in revenues.

In 1999, Christine Lagarde, the Paris managing partner and an antitrust and labor lawyer, was elected chair of the global executive committee, the first woman to lead Baker McKenzie or any major international law firm; she was chair for five years. She later became France&#x27;s Minister of Finance and managing director of the International Monetary Fund.

In 2001, the firm employed 3,000 attorneys and garnered $1 billion in revenues. In 2005, 70 partners, and other legal staff, from the New York office of disbanding international firm Coudert Brothers joined Baker McKenzie.

In October 2006, Unilever chose the firm to manage its global trademark portfolio, the largest in the world, with over 160,000 registrations, marking the first time a multinational company outsourced its trademark management to a law firm on such a large scale. 

In July 2013, co-founding partner Russell Baker was named one of &quot;American Lawyer&quot;&#x27;s top 50 innovators for pioneering ideas and initiatives that changed the world of BigLaw.

In August 2014, Baker McKenzie revealed it was the first law firm to break through the $2.5bn revenues barrier since the financial crisis, and that it was also the largest firm in the world by headcount.

The firm&#x27;s global chair, from 2016, until his death in April 2019, was former London managing partner Paul Rawlinson, who was the 15th chair, and the first British chair of the firm. Rawlinson had succeeded Eduardo C. Leite who was chair of Baker McKenzie from 2010 to 2016. In September 2019 the Firm announced that Milton Cheng had been elected as the global chair for four years, commenced October 2019.

In September 2022, after 40 years of existence in the UAE, Baker McKenzie announced to swiftly separate from its Emirati partner, Habib Al Mulla. The law firm raised a concern regarding the homophobic Twitter posts by Mulla, whose firm merged with Baker McKenzie in 2013. Mulla sparked controversy when he described homosexuality as &quot;ugly&quot; in his tweets. Baker McKenzie&#x27;s head of investigations Borys Dackiw was temporarily appointed to lead. The law firm said it wanted to &quot;ensure an inclusive work environment for all&quot;.

==Size and structure==

Baker McKenzie is the largest law firm in the United States by headcount. , it was the second largest law firm by headcount and third by revenue. 

For 2015-2022, Reuters ranked the firm first by number of cross-border deals and for the eleventh year in a row the firm was ranked first for deals with emerging market involvement, by both number of announced and completed number of deals.

Baker McKenzie is organized as a Swiss Verein which allows regional profit pools and their related tax, accounting, and partner compensation systems to remain separate while allowing strategy, branding, information technology and other core functions to be shared between the constituent partnerships. Baker McKenzie is the only Verein that used to be a single partnership, while all of the other Vereins were created by firms merging.

==Notable matters and transactions==
In 2006, Baker McKenzie wrote the amicus brief of the Council of Parent Attorneys &amp; Advocates (COPAA) in support of the petition for a Writ of Certiorari in &quot;Winkelman v. Parma City School District&quot;, and later, COPAA&#x27;s amicus brief on the merits. It argued that parents have the right to represent themselves in court to enforce their IDEA rights and protect their children&#x27;s access to free appropriate public education. This led to a unanimous Supreme Court decision in June 2007 granting parents the right to proceed without counsel on behalf of children with disabilities.

In December 2009, Baker McKenzie won a landmark tax case against the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for Symantec Corporation. The IRS had claimed that the Veritas Software Corporation, which Symantec had subsequently acquired in 2005, owed over $1 billion in back taxes, penalties, and interest as a result of Veritas&#x27; non-U.S. operations. Symantec took the case to the U.S. Tax Court where Baker &amp; McKenzie argued that the IRS position was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. In an opinion by Judge Maurice Foley, the court decided in favor of Symantec.

Baker McKenzie represented Microsoft in &quot;Microsoft Corporation v. Internal Revenue Service&quot;

In 2012, Baker McKenzie helped overturn Paul Chambers&#x27; conviction under the Communications Act of 2003 (the Twitter Joke Trial) for tweeting a &quot;message of a menacing character.&quot; Chambers, an accountant, had tweeted a &quot;silly joke&quot; about &quot;blowing up the Robin Hood airport in South Yorkshire.&quot; The team advising on his appeal was led by Preiskel &amp; Co&#x27;s David Allen Green, John Cooper QC of 25 Bedford Row, and Sarah Przybylska of 2 Hare Court. The Baker McKenzie team, which acted on the case pro bono from 2010, included partners Harry Small, Tom Cassels and Ben Allgrove.

Baker McKenzie is currently representing Facebook Inc. in its dispute with the IRS over the value of assets the company transferred to its Irish holding company. Lawyers with the U.S. Department of Justice asked for a court order forcing Facebook to provide information to the IRS related to agreements between the company and the holding company, Facebook Ireland Holdings.

== Controversies ==
In 1986, Geoffrey Bowers, then a New York attorney, filed a complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights, charging that he had been fired from his job at the Manhattan branch of Baker McKenzie law firm after AIDS-related lesions appeared on his face. The firm maintained that he was fired purely for his performance. Two months after testifying at a hearing on the complaint, he died at age 33. The case was resolved in his favor in late December when Baker McKenzie was ordered to pay $500,000 to Bowers&#x27; estate. It was one of the first AIDS discrimination cases to go to a public hearing. Baker McKenzie appealed but subsequently withdrew the appeal after they negotiated a confidential settlement in 1995 with Bowers&#x27; family forbidding parties from ever discussing the case or the terms of the agreement. These events were one inspiration for the film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington (the script of which was derived from numerous sources). 

In 1994, in a seminal case, a legal secretary, Rena Weeks, successfully sued the law firm for sexual harassment. The trial court ordered the law firm to pay $6.9 million in punitive damages, making it one of the largest damage awards in history for this type of action. On May 4, 1998, the California Court of Appeal for the First District upheld the trial court&#x27;s judgment in full, and the Supreme Court of California denied review. A subsequent dispute among Weeks&#x27; victorious attorneys as to the division of fees among them (she had signed a contingent fee agreement for 40% of her recovery) did reach the Supreme Court of California in 2002; the court held that the later-associated co-counsel could not recover the full amount he sought because Weeks&#x27; attorneys had not obtained her consent to an agreement to split fees among co-counsel from different firms as required by California court rules. Martin R. Greenstein, the partner whose actions resulted in Weeks&#x27; successful lawsuit, was given a public reproval by the State Bar of California on March 26, 1998, and for obvious reasons, is no longer with Baker McKenzie (the Court of Appeal decision noted that he was terminated by the firm in August 1993).

=== Tax avoidance ===
In 2021, the law firm was listed in the Pandora Papers after the law firm conducted offshoring activities for organizations outside of the United States. One of the actions includes setting up shell companies in Cyprus for RJR Nabisco (which has split up), creating a tax shelter for Nike, as well as moving Facebook&#x27;s tax headquarters to Ireland, allowing these companies to avoid taxes. Baker McKenzie&#x27;s clients include Malaysian fugitive Jho Low.

Baker McKenzie has boasted about helping to set up tax-free zones in the UAE, which critics say encourage illicit activity. Baker McKenzie has lobbied against legislation to curb offshore tax avoidance by big companies and lobbied against legislation that would increase due diligence for foreign customers of American banks.

According to the ICIJ, Baker McKenzie is &quot;an architect of the modern tax avoidance system.&quot; The company has helped fraudsters, corrupt officials and elites in authoritarian regimes avoid taxes and hide wealth through the use of shell companies, trusts and complex structures in tax havens. The Pandora Papers mentioned Baker McKenzie more than any other major U.S. law firm – the leaks alone revealed that Baker McKenzie was involved in setting up more than 440 offshore companies registered in tax havens.

=== Russia ===
Baker McKenzie has described itself as the &quot;go-to firm for Russia&#x27;s largest companies and major foreign investors.&quot;

Baker McKenzie has represented Russian state-owned companies Gazprom, Sberbank, VTB Bank, VEB.RF and Sviaz Bank, and the arms-manufacturer Rostec.

In 2016, Baker McKenzie worked for Rostec in selling shares in a Mongolian copper mine. The sale triggered a corruption investigation. In 2021, Baker McKenzie advised the Russian Ministry of Finance on a $1.8 billion bond deal.

In October 2021, the Pandora Papers leaks revealed that company represented at least six sanctioned Russian companies. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the company initially did not sever ties with Russian state-owned companies, but said it was &quot;reviewing and adjusting our Russia-related operations and client work&quot; to adjust to sanctions. In late March 2022, the company said it was leaving Russia.

<doc id="1019023" wikidata="Q1051307" url="?curid=1019023" title="Yassa">
<text>The Yassa (alternatively &quot;Yasa&quot;, &quot;Yasaq&quot;, &quot;Jazag&quot; or &quot;Zasag&quot;; ) was the oral law code of the Mongols, gradually built up through the reign of Genghis Khan. It was the &quot;de facto&quot; law of the Mongol Empire, even though the &quot;law&quot; was kept secret and never made public. The Yassa seems to have its origin in wartime decrees, which were later codified and expanded to include cultural and lifestyle conventions. By keeping the Yassa secret, the decrees could be modified and used selectively. It is believed that the Yassa was supervised by Genghis Khan himself and his adopted son Shigi Qutuqu, then the high judge (in ) of the Mongol Empire. Genghis Khan appointed his second son, Chagatai (later Chagatai Khan), to oversee the laws&#x27; execution.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;yasa&quot; (or &quot;Yassa&quot;) exists in both Mongolic and Turkic languages. It is believed that the word derives from the Proto-Mongolian verb *&quot;jasa-&quot; (Modern ), which means &quot;to set in order&quot;. The Turkic verb &quot;yasa-&quot;, which means &quot;to govern; to create&quot;, was probably borrowed from Mongolian.

In the earliest text in Mongolian, the Secret History of the Mongols, the word &quot;yassa&quot; seems to refer specifically to authoritative (military) decrees. &quot;Čerig žasa-&quot; () - roughly equivalent to modern - is a phrase commonly found in the &quot;Secret History&quot; that means &quot;to set the soldiers in order&quot;, in the sense of rallying the soldiers before a battle. In modern Mongolian, the verb &quot;zasaglakh&quot; () means &quot;to govern&quot;.

Another word, which is sometimes equated with &quot;yassa&quot;, is &quot;yosun&quot; (Modern ). This term refers, broadly, to rules deriving from tradition, including for example rules of etiquette. Early chroniclers from Europe and the Middle East oftentimes did not clearly distinguish between the two terms - sometimes for ideological reasons - resulting in sources that often contain a mixture of laws and customs.

===Historical and current use===

&quot;Jasagh&quot; during the Qing dynasty referred to native provincial governors in Mongolia. The local office (the Lifan Yuan) served as their court of the first instance, and included secretaries and other officials.

The supreme executive body of the present-day Mongolian government is called the &quot;Zasgiin gazar (&quot;), which means &quot;the place of &quot;Zasag&quot;&quot;, i.e. &quot;the place of order&quot;.

==History==

===Date and textual history===
According to some scholars, the Yassa was proclaimed by Genghis Khan at the kurultai of 1206, when he officially assumed the title of Genghis Khan. In the &quot;Secret History&quot;, Genghis Khan tells his adopted son Shigi Qutuqu to create a register of jurisprudence, which implies the existence of such a document:&quot;Furthermore, writing in a blue-script register all decisions about the distribution and about the judicial matters of the entire population, make it into a book. Until the offspring of my offspring, let no one alter any of the blue writing that Šigi Qutuqu, after deciding in accordance with me, shall make into a book with white paper. Anyone who alters it shall be guilty and liable to punishment.&quot;

The Yassa may have later been written down in the Uyghur script, preserved in secret archives and known only to and read only by the royal family. Juvyani, in the &quot;Tarikh-i Jahangushay&quot;, writes of the role of the &quot;yasas&quot; during a kurultai (a military council):These rolls are called the &quot;Great book of the Yasas&quot; and are kept in the treasury of the chief princes. Whenever a khan ascends the throne, or a great army is mobilized, or the princes assemble and begin [to consult together] concerning affairs of state and the administration thereof, they produce these rolls and model their actions thereon;The Yasa decrees were thought to be comprehensive and specific, but no Mongolian scroll or codex has been found. There are records of excerpts among many chronicles including those of al-Maqrizi, Vardan Areveltsi, and Ibn Battuta. The first of these may have relied on the work of Ata-Malik Juvayni, an Ilkhanate official. Moreover, copies may have been discovered in Korea as well. 

In the end, the absence of any physical document is historically problematic. Historians are left with secondary sources, conjecture and speculation, which describe much of the content of the overview. Historical certainty about the Yassa is weak compared to the much older Code of Hammurabi (18th century BCE) or the Edicts of Ashoka (3rd century BCE). The latter was carved for all to see on stone plinths, 12 to 15 m high, which were located throughout Ashoka&#x27;s empire (now India, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan).

===Among the successors of Genghis Khan===

Ögedei Khan, the third son of Genghis Khan and the second Great Khan, proclaimed the Great Yassa as an integral body of precedents at his coronation at the kurultai of 1229. He confirmed the continuing validity of his father&#x27;s commands and ordinances, and added his own. Ögedei codified rules of dress, as well as the conduct of the kurultais. His two immediate successors followed the tradition of proclaiming the Yassa at their coronation.

The Mongols who lived in various parts of the empire began to add laws that were needed in their areas.

===Present-day influence===
In the modern Turkish language (as used presently in Turkey), the word for &quot;law&quot; is &quot;yasa&quot;, and the adjective &quot;legal&quot; is &quot;yasal&quot;. The word for a constitution, including the Constitution of Turkey, is &quot;Anayasa&quot; (&quot;mother-law&quot;).

==Overview of contents==
The contents of the Yassa are not known from one single document, but scholars have reconstructed their contents from numerous sources relating to them. Among these, of particular interest are of course the &quot;Secret History&quot;, but also the &quot;Tarikh-i Jahangushay&quot; of Juvyani, and other works by contemporaries. Most detailed non-Mongolian sources don&#x27;t distinguish clearly between legal decrees (&quot;yassa&quot;) and customs (&quot;yosun&quot;).

=== Contents according to the &quot;Secret History&quot; ===
In the &quot;Secret History&quot;, Genghis Khan tells Shigi Qutuqu, his adopted son, to create a blue-script book, which may be one of the books that formed the basis for what was later understood as the Yassa. In this book, as Genghis tells Shigi Qutuqu, the following items should be collected:&quot;[all] decisions about the distribution and about the judicial matters of the entire population&quot;According to David Morgan, this amounts to: (1) &quot;Matters pertaining to [the] division (...) of spoils and property&quot;; and (2) &quot;Matters pertaining to trials&quot;. Elsewhere in the &quot;Secret History&quot;, individual decrees of Genghis Khan are mentioned, but to what extent these should be understood as permanent laws is not always clear.

=== Contents according to the &quot;Tarikh-i Jahangushay&quot; ===
In the &quot;Tarikh-i Jahangushay&quot;, a work by the Ilkhanate official Ata-Malik Juvyani, there appears one chapter dedicated to commenting on the &quot;yassas.&quot; This chapter is by no means comprehensive, as stated by the author himself:There are many other &quot;[yassas]&quot; to record each of which would delay us too long; we have therefore limited ourselves to the mention of the above.However, some of the organisational matters discussed by Juvyani match pretty well with the brief statement in the &quot;Secret History&quot; about the contents of Shigi Qutuqu&#x27;s blue-script book. He mentions both matters of tax, provisions and the divvying up of spoils, as well punishable offences, most of which appear to apply specifically to the peasantry that made up the army.

On the one hand, for example, he states that there is a requirement to share food with travelers, a rule of selling women from other families, and a duty to maintain provisions for the &quot;ǰamči&quot;&#x27;s (post stations). On the other hand, he paints a picture of strict army dicipline, mentioning a ban on defection for soldiers, with the alleged punishment being summary public execution of the defector, and severe punishment for whoever offers shelter to the defector.

Throughout the rest of the work, Juvyani also mentions individual &quot;yassas&quot;, sometimes specifically ascribing them to Genghis Khan or his successors, and sometimes without further specification.

=== Further conjectured laws ===
The exoteric aspect of Yassa outlined laws for various members of the Mongol community such as soldiers, officers and doctors. The Yassa aimed at three things: obedience to Genghis Khan, a binding together of the nomad clans and the merciless punishment of wrongdoing. It concerned itself with people, not property. Unless a man confessed, he was not judged guilty. The purpose of many decrees was probably to eliminate social and economic disputes among the Mongols and future allied peoples. Among the rules were the ban on cattle raiding. It represented a day-to-day set of rules for people under Mongol control that was strictly enforced. 

The Yassa also addressed and reflected Mongol cultural and lifestyle norms. Death via decapitation was the most common punishment unless the offender was of noble blood, when the offender would be killed by way of back-breaking, without shedding blood. Even minor offences were punishable by death. For example, a soldier would be put to death if he did not pick up something that fell from the person in front of him. Those favored by the Khan were often given preferential treatment within the system of law and were allowed several chances before they were punished.

As Genghis Khan had set up an institution that ensured complete religious freedom, people under his rule were free to worship as they pleased if the laws of the Yassa were observed.

<text>Marine Corps Air Station New River is a United States Marine Corps helicopter and tilt-rotor base in Jacksonville, North Carolina, in the eastern part of the state. In 1972, the airfield was named McCutcheon Field for General Keith B. McCutcheon, one of the fathers of Marine Corps helicopter aviation. Near Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, it shares some facilities with Camp Geiger.

==History==
The base was originally 29 parcels of land, a simple stretch of tobacco farm that was purchased for $64,502 in 1941. Officials at Camp Lejeune investigated the area in search of an existing airfield for hosting aircraft in support of amphibious operations. Capt. Barnett Robinson, a member of Marine Glider Group 71, concluded in his search that the farmland would suit the Marine Corps’ needs.

The location was placed under the command of Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and received its first squadron, VMSB-331 from Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point on 9 March 1943. On 1 June, VMSB-331 was divided in half to create VMSB-332. However, both squadrons were soon after relocated to Bogue Field. From mid-1943 through August 1944, Marine bombing squadrons VMB-433, VMB-443 and VMB-612 operating the land-based PBJ Mitchell bomber were stationed there. On 26 April 1944, the area of land around New River and Peterfield Point, named after the original owner of the farmland that was part of the government purchase, was commissioned Marine Corps Auxiliary Airfield Camp Lejeune. This delineated the airfield from Camp Lejeune, and marks its official birth as a separate Marine Corps installation. Over the next few years, paratrooper Marines, glider troops and air delivery personnel were trained in King Air hangar, the Stations’ first hangar, which was transported from Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina.

As World War II came to an end, MCAAF Camp Lejeune was closed and reverted to caretaker status as an outlying airfield of MCAS Cherry Point. This did not last long, however, as in 1951 the installation was reactivated and became Marine Corps Air Facility Peterfield Point, Camp Lejeune. Only one year later the name was changed again, this time to Marine Corps Air Facility New River. July 1954 marked the arrival of the first operational Marine Aircraft Group, MAG-26, which was transferred from MCAS Cherry Point.

The area faced another major name change in 1968, where it was recommissioned as Marine Corps Air Station (Helicopter) New River, marking its growth from a small training area to a major operational airfield.

In 2015, MCAS New River hosted the Global Rallycross racing series on Independence Day weekend. The race weekend was expanded to two rounds in 2016, but did not return for the 2017 season.

In January 2022, HMH-461 became the first operational unit in the Marine Corps to replace its CH-53E Super Stallion with the upgraded CH-53K King Stallion.

==MV-22 Osprey==
The Air Station was the first Marine Corps base with the new MV-22 Osprey. It has the ability to fly like a plane, and take off and land like a helicopter. The MV-22 has replaced all of the CH-46E Sea Knights on the east coast with the exception of HMX-1 and HMM-774. Currently there are seven operational Osprey squadrons, VMM-261, VMM-263, VMM-162, VMM-365, VMM-266, VMM-264 and VMMT-204.

<text>The Communist Party of Trinidad and Tobago was a pro-Albanian Marxist–Leninist political party in Trinidad and Tobago. The party was founded in 1979. One source claims it was founded by Hardial Bains, the leader of Communist Party of Canada (Marxist–Leninist). CPTT published &quot;Class Struggle&quot;. 

Many of the members of this party renounced their hardline communist stances by the end of the 1980s, coinciding with the Fall of the Soviet Union. Former members Michael Als and Wade Mark were involved in party politics in the late 1990s. Wade Mark is a member of the executive of the United National Congress. Michael Als was a UNC candidate for the 2000 election.

<text>A half marathon is a road running event of —half the distance of a marathon. It is common for a half marathon event to be held concurrently with a marathon or a 5K race, using almost the same course with a late start, an early finish, or shortcuts. If finisher medals are awarded, the medal or ribbon may differ from those for the full marathon. The half marathon is also known as a 21K, 21.1K, or 13.1 miles, although these values are rounded and not formally correct.

A half marathon world record is officially recognised by World Athletics. The men&#x27;s world record time, pending ratification, is 56:42, set by Jacob Kiplimo of Uganda in February 2025 in Barcelona, Spain. The women&#x27;s world record, in a mixed-gender race, is 1:02:52, set by Letesenbet Gidey of Ethiopia in October 2021 in Valencia, Spain. In a female-only race, the women&#x27;s world record is 1:05:16, set by Peres Jepchirchir of Kenya in October 2020.

Participation in half marathons has grown steadily since 2003, partly because it is a challenging distance, but does not require the same level of training that a marathon does. In 2008, &quot;Running USA&quot; reported that the half marathon is the fastest-growing type of race.

== History ==
The concept of the half-marathon emerged in the 1960s. The first half marathon was the Route du Vin Half Marathon founded in 1961. Although the race was technically not the official current distance until it was standardized in 1995. The event grew in popularity leading to the eventual establishment of the World Athletics Road Running Championships in 1992, originally titled the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships.

<doc id="1019036" wikidata="Q547845" url="?curid=1019036" title="Sorcerer (role-playing game)">
<text>Sorcerer is an occult-themed indie role-playing game written by Ron Edwards and published through Adept Press. The game focuses on sorcerers who summon, bind, and interact with demons, powerful non-human entities who work with and against the sorcerer.

==Setting==
The game has no definite default setting beyond a few guidelines. Examples of these guidelines include the unknown nature and origins of demons and authorities who do not believe in the supernatural. The rule examples, however, assume a modern fantasy world which to mundane people resembles our own.

== System ==

===Humanity===
Play focuses on a particular theme defined by each group as &quot;Humanity&quot;. Players make conscious decisions throughout play to commit their characters towards actions that support or negate Humanity, often risking it in the process of acquiring or utilizing the power of demons. Through doing so, players are making strong thematic statements about the issue defined by Humanity. 
===Bang===
A &quot;bang&quot; is a situation that requires a choice from the player as to how the character will respond to the situation. The choice will often be thematically relevant, based on the Humanity definition and earlier events in the game. For a bang to be effective, the game master shouldn&#x27;t force a specific choice, and the player doing nothing should also have consequences.

The game master should prepare a number of bangs for each session in what Edwards calls a bandoleer of bangs, but be prepared to alter them on the fly or discard them if necessary. A bang doesn&#x27;t have to be initiated by the game master; another player or even the player himself could identify a bang situation that requires a choice.

The term was introduced by Edwards in the Sorcerer book.

===Conflict Resolution===

Conflict resolution is handled with opposed rolls in dice pools. These dice can be any size, but must be uniform (that is, you only play with ten-sided dice, or six-sided dice, etc., but never mix them.) During conflict, each opposing force rolls their dice pool. The single highest die result wins, where ties are removed from the pool before looking at the next highest result. After a winner is established, the other dice are compared to determine the degree of success: the winner receives one &#x27;Victory&#x27; for each die that shows a higher value than the highest of the loser&#x27;s dice.

# Player 1 rolls 10, 10, 5, 3 and Player 2 rolls 10, 9, 4, 4. Here Player 1 wins with 1 Victory.
# Player 1 rolls 7, 6, 5, 2 and Player 2 rolls 3, 2, 1. Here Player 1 wins with 3 Victories. 
# Player 1 rolls 10, 4, 4, 2 and Player 2 rolls 10, 7, 5, 4. The 10s cancel and Player 2 wins with 2 Victory (because Player 2 did not gain a Victory from their 4).
# Player 1 rolls 10, 6, 4, 4 and Player 2 rolls 3, 2, 2, 1. Player 1 wins with 4 Victories.

The number of victories determine how close the contest was: a single victory means a close win, and four or more victories is total domination. If the player receives Victories equal to their number of dice, it is considered a Total Victory. That character should receive some sort of additional advantage.

== Publication history ==
Ron Edwards began working on &quot;Sorcerer&quot; while he was a biology instructor at the University of Florida, working on his PhD and writing his dissertation about on evolutionary theory. He submitted his role-playing game to an existing publisher, who agreed to publish it and sent Edwards a standard contract, which gave the publisher control over artwork and marketing, as well as the right to revise the game later if the author does not want to revise it, and to terminate the contract whenever they decide. Edwards found the proposed contract unacceptable — inspired by indie comic creator Dave Sim, he believed that creators should be able to control their works. He self-published &quot;Sorcerer&quot; in 1996, sending it to anyone who asked for a copy and asking for $5 in return if they liked the game, and soon afterward he produced an ashcan of &quot;Sorcerer&quot; to sell at conventions. He continued to playtest and produced a fully rewritten version of the game that he began selling in PDF form after acquiring the sorcerer-rpg.com domain. He also produced two PDF supplements – &quot;Sorcerer &amp; Sword&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Soul&quot; (2000) – and also licensed Concept Syndicate in early 2000 to put &quot;Sorcerer&quot; for sale on a CD-ROM. After seeing &quot;Obsidian: The Age of Justice&quot;, an independently published RPG, at GenCon 33 Edwards decided he could publish his own RPG while retaining ownership. Edwards re-published &quot;Sorcerer&quot; through his own company Adept Press as a 128-page hardcover book in 2001. Ron Edwards and &quot;Sorcerer&quot; were subsequently awarded the second annual Diana Jones Award for &quot;excellence in gaming&quot; in 2002.

==Reception==
In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;If a player&#x27;s interests lie outside of testing the extreme of personal desire, or if a player has no inclination to fall into a cycle of resisting then succumbing to temptation, then &quot;Sorcerer&quot; will most likely disappoint — not because it is intense or transgressive (though it can be) but because there is literally nothing else to do in the game. It aims for, and delivers, a singular experience.&quot;

==Awards==
&quot;Sorcerer&quot; won the second annual Diana Jones Award for &quot;excellence in gaming&quot; in 2002.

===Mini-supplements===

A mini-supplement can include rule tweaks, new setting information other variations of the basic Sorcerer concept.

<text>The United Nations General Assembly declared 2004 as the International Year to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and its Abolition (having welcomed the fact that UNESCO had proclaimed it as such earlier).

The General Assembly resolution in its entirety (of which this declaration was a single paragraph) was voted against by the Israel, Palau and the United States, with Australia and Canada abstaining.

The United Nations International Years, beginning with the World Refugee Year in 1959/1960, are designated in order to focus world attention on important issues. The proclamation of an international year to commemorate the struggle against slavery and its abolition marked the bicentenary of the proclamation of the first black state, Haiti, as well as the reunion of the peoples of Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean and Europe.

Among the initiatives that marked the commemorative year was a virtual exhibition, Lest We Forget: The Triumph over Slavery, created by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and New York Public Library.

Another effort that was launched during the year was a research and information programme, Forgotten Slaves. The programme was implemented by the French Marine Archaeology Group (GRAN) with the support of UNESCO. It was inspired by the wreck of the slave ship &quot;l&#x27;Utile&quot; off the shores of the Tromelin Island in the Indian Ocean in 1761 and was intended to be part of an information campaign to raise awareness of both the history of slavery and modern forms of slavery.

<doc id="1019051" wikidata="Q3042442" url="?curid=1019051" title="List of compositions by Franz Schubert by genre">
<text>Franz Schubert (31 January 1797 – 19 November 1828) was an extremely prolific Austrian composer. He composed some 1500 works (or, when collections, cycles and variants are grouped, some thousand compositions). The largest group are the lieder for piano and solo voice (over six hundred), and nearly as many piano pieces. Schubert also composed some 150 part songs, some 40 liturgical compositions (including several masses) and around 20 stage works like operas and incidental music. His orchestral output includes thirteen symphonies (seven completed) and several overtures. Schubert&#x27;s chamber music includes over 20 string quartets, and several quintets, trios and duos.

This article constitutes a complete list of Schubert&#x27;s known works organized by their genre. The complete output is divided in eight series, and in principle follows the order established by the Neue Schubert-Ausgabe printed edition. The works found in each series are ordered ascendingly according to Deutsch numbers, the information of which attempts to reflect the most current information regarding Schubert&#x27;s catalogue.

* Title – the title of the work
* Incipit – the first line(s) of text, as pertaining to vocal works
* Scoring – the instrumentation and/or vocal forces required for the work
* Informal Title – any additional names by which the work is known, when applicable
* Former Deutsch Number – information on Deutsch numbers that have been reassigned, when applicable
* Date – the known or assumed date of composition, when available; or date of publication
* Opus Number – the opus number of the original publication of the work, when applicable
* Setting – the order of setting as it pertains to vocal works that have numerous settings of the same text

<doc id="1019052" wikidata="Q5059490" url="?curid=1019052" title="Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing">
<text>The Johns Hopkins University Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) has worked with scientists, since 1981, to find new methods to replace the use of laboratory animals in experiments, reduce the number of animals tested, and refine necessary tests to eliminate pain and distress (the Three Rs as described in Russell and Burch&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Humane Experimental Technique&quot;). CAAT is an academic, science-based center affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

CAAT promotes humane science by supporting the creation, development, validation, and use of alternatives to animals in research, product safety testing, and education. It is not an activist group; rather, it seeks to effect change by working with scientists in industry, government, and academia to find new ways to replace animals with non-animal methods, reduce the numbers of animals necessary, or refine methods to make them less painful or stressful to the animals involved. CAAT has offered grants since 1993 that fund development of non-animal in-vitro test methods that may replace the use of laboratory animals in certain tests.

Starting in 2013, CAAT has co-sponsored an annual symposium with the Animal Welfare Information Center (National Agricultural Library, USDA) and the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (NIH) on the Three Rs. The first six symposia focused on the social housing of laboratory animals, since it has been shown that housing social species with other animals of their kind improves animal welfare. The most recent symposium, &quot;7th Annual 3Rs Symposium: Practical Solutions and Success Stories,&quot; occurred virtually on June 4-5, 2020 and addressed topics throughout the spectrum of the Three Rs, including using brain organoids to study infectious diseases such as COVID-19 or Zika, using Grimace Scales to access animal pain, positive reinforcement training of lab animals, and using guidelines such as ARRIVE and PREPARE to design experiments that use fewer animals.
