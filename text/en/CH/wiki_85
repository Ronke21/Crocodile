<text>Afrodisiac is the fourth studio album by American singer Brandy. It was first released on June 25, 2004, by Atlantic Records. The album was recorded primarily in Los Angeles between spring 2003 and early 2004, following several major changes in Brandy&#x27;s personal and professional life. After giving birth to her daughter and the demise of her relationship with Big Bert, Brandy&#x27;s team was given an overhaul, including changes in production, management, and A&amp;R. The album marked a departure from her previous work, with Brandy collaborating with producer Timbaland and songwriter Candice Nelson on the majority of the album&#x27;s composition.

With many of their new relationships being the result of broken ones, Brandy and Timbaland were inspired to experiment with a number of sounds and influences to create a unique, individualized sound that was distinct from other R&amp;B music. The result was an organic, mellow contemporary R&amp;B album that experimented with the New York-based illbient style, which infuses eccentric hip-hop breakbeats, ambient soundscapes, and the unorthodox sampling of indie rock and various film scores. Brandy also continued to experiment with her singing, opting to use more technical applications of counterpoint and multi-track recording toward her vocal arrangements. An autobiographical album, the songs feature intimate lyrics which discuss the singer&#x27;s personal struggles with codependency, monogamy, misplaced loyalty, and professional anxiety.

Upon release, &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; was critically acclaimed for its mature lyrics, Brandy&#x27;s vocalizing, and its overall experimental sound. The album debuted at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 131,700 copies in its first week; it was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; was nominated for several awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album. The album spawned three singles, including &quot;Talk About Our Love&quot; featuring Kanye West, which reached the top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; along with &quot;Who Is She 2 U&quot; and &quot;Afrodisiac&quot;. Since its release, the album has been retrospectively called a predecessor to alternative R&amp;B, having been cited as an influence by artists such as Rihanna and Solange.

==Background==
In February 2002, Brandy released her third studio album &quot;Full Moon&quot;, which was preceded by the lead single &quot;What About Us?&quot;, a worldwide top-ten hit. However, the album&#x27;s title track failed to chart or sell noticeably outside the United States and the United Kingdom, where it managed to enter the top twenty. During the production of &quot;Full Moon&quot;, she became involved romantically with producer Robert &quot;Big Bert&quot; Smith. The couple began a relationship during the summer of 2001, but their relationship did not become known until February 2002, the same month Brandy revealed that she was expecting her first child. However, a year after the birth of their daughter Sy&#x27;rai Iman Smith on June 16, 2002, Brandy and Smith officially announced their separation. It was not until 2004 that Smith revealed that the pair had never been legally wed, but that they had only portrayed the notion of nuptials to preserve the singer&#x27;s public image. By the following year, Brandy had begun a relationship with NBA guard Quentin Richardson. The couple soon became engaged in July 2004 but she eventually ended their 15-month engagement in October 2005.

==Recording and production==
Following the birth of her daughter Sy&#x27;rai in June 2002, Brandy soon entered recording studios to begin work on her then-untitled fourth album with producer Mike City and companion Robert &quot;Big Bert&quot; Smith. As she envisioned the longplayer to sound &quot;much rawer&quot; and more &quot;street&quot; than its 2002 predecessor &quot;Full Moon&quot;, Smith quickly emerged as the album&#x27;s executive producer and A&amp;R, replacing longtime contributor and mentor Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins, who Brandy felt was not going in the same direction creatively after all. About parting ways with Jerkins whose Darkchild team took production credits on her last two albums, she commented that &quot;Darkchild created a sound with me and gave it to everybody. I didn&#x27;t like that [...] I needed to change my sound and I wanted to explore my versatility, my creativity and my art.&quot; The couple eventually finished a number of demo recordings and at least four full songs until late November 2002, including &quot;Ryde or Die&quot; and Sy&#x27;rai-inspired &quot;Sunshine.&quot; Although Smith expected the album to be released by spring 2003 at one time or another, him and Brandy ended their relationship in mid-2003, resulting in the album&#x27;s delay and several personnel changes.
Brandy eventually decided to scrap most of the project, and instead enlisted Timbaland, with whom the couple had previously worked on Kiley Dean&#x27;s shelved album &quot;Simple Girl&quot;, as the album&#x27;s main contributors. Impressed by Timbaland&#x27;s input, Brandy rediscovered the musical affection, she had missed on &quot;Full Moon&quot; and its technical priority. &quot;I made the change because I needed to evolve. I needed to explore my talent and versatility and see if I had another side to me, another sound,&quot; she said about collaborating. &quot;I wanted to do my own thing, and I&#x27;ve always wanted to work with Timbaland [...] and see how my voice would sound over his tracks. It was an edgier Brandy, a sassier sound, but still with a lot of heart and a lot of passion.&quot; With the help of Timbaland protégés such as Candice Nelson, Steve &quot;Static&quot; Garrett, and co-producer Walter Millsap III the pair worked on what was tentatively titled &quot;B-Rocka&quot;—a nickname actually given to her by Jerkins—and originally planned for a Christmas 2003 release. Their first collaboration, 1990s tribute &quot;Turn It Up,&quot; was leaked onto the internet in autumn 2003, and soon released as a promotional buzz track.

Having concluded additional recording sessions with Warryn Campbell, Theron Feemster and Organized Noise, in November 2003, Atlantic Records announced that Brandy was putting the finishing touches on her still-untitled album, at that time scheduled for a release on March 2, 2004, and she would shoot a music video for the &quot;hyper, bass-heavy&quot; banger &quot;Black Pepper&quot; during the second week of December. However, plans for the single fell through as the Timbaland-produced track was scrapped in favor of a new record: &quot;Talk About Our Love,&quot; produced by rapper Kanye West. Both the single and album cut &quot;Where You Wanna Be&quot; were eleventh-hour additions to the album, commissioned by West&#x27;s manager Geroid Roberson, one of the executive producers on &quot;Afrodisiac&quot;, who encouraged Brandy to attempt further studio sessions with West. On her decision to work with West, she commented: &quot;Kanye put the finishing touches on the record. The two tracks we did were just what I needed to tie the whole thing together.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;It&#x27;s about passion. It&#x27;s romantic, and that&#x27;s where I am in my life right now,&quot; Brandy noted during promotional touring in 2004, a time when she was engaged to New York Knicks guard Quentin Richardson. &quot;I&#x27;m not &quot;trying&quot; to be edgy, sassy, romantic, vulnerable or whatever emotions come across, I really am all that&quot;, she said. While not a concept record, &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; features several consistent motifs throughout. It contains several lyrical references to 1990s hip hop and R&amp;B culture figures, including Brandy herself, Timbaland and longtime partner Missy Elliott, her peers Aaliyah and Monica, American music video program &quot;Video Soul&quot; and its host Donnie Simpson, hip-hop group Kid n&#x27; Play and their 1990 film &quot;House Party&quot;, sketch comedy television series &quot;In Living Color&quot;, and Tony! Toni! Toné!&#x27;s studio album &quot;House of Music&quot; (1996). Throughout the album, English rock band Coldplay is used in both lyrical and musical concepts. In a 2013 interview, songwriter Candice Nelson discussed that coincidentally, she, Timbaland, and Brandy had all been privately listening to Coldplay&#x27;s studio album &quot;Parachutes&quot; (2000).
The general theme of anxiety runs through majority of the songs, with a lyrical focus on being critical of close personal and long-term professional relationships. She references her relationship with Robert Smith (&quot;Who I Am&quot;, &quot;I Tried&quot;, &quot;Focus&quot;), then-fiancé Quentin Richardson (&quot;Where You Wanna Be&quot;, &quot;Say You Will&quot;), friends (&quot;Sadiddy&quot;), family (&quot;Necessary&quot;), career (&quot;Should I Go&quot;), and herself (&quot;Come As You Are&quot;, &quot;Finally&quot;). The line &quot;&#x27;Cause I don&#x27;t wanna sound familiar, want a guaranteed single, not an album filler&quot; from &quot;Turn It Up&quot; levels indirect criticism at creative differences with former main producer Jerkins and Atlantic Records staff. On ending track &quot;Should I Go,&quot; which interpolates Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;Clocks&quot;, she openly talks about contemplating stepping away from the music business, admitting that she&#x27;s trying to figure out where she fits in today.

Although Brandy received a sole writing credit on album cut &quot;Finally&quot; only, she noted &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; the most honest effort of her career yet based on its deeply autobiographical content, commenting: &quot;Everything I do has something to do with what I&#x27;ve gone through in my life [and] I definitely wanted to incorporate that in my art. It makes it more real when you add what&#x27;s been going on in your life in your music. I&#x27;ve grown and I&#x27;ve gone through some things in my life, and I celebrate that, I honor that.&quot; Songwriter Nelson spoke further, saying, &quot;[throughout this album] my thought was &#x27;what&#x27;s going on in her mind?&#x27; I wanted to observe her more than talk to her. First of all, I was starstruck, so I wanted to just watch her, and write from that. She was kind of shocked by what I would write. [Then] I was amazed, because she would take what I wrote and make this rainbow of sounds. She&#x27;s so brilliant.&quot; Soundwise, her collaborator Timbaland spoke of their work on the album in his memoir &quot;The Emperor of Sound&quot; (2015). In the book, he says: &quot;I always wanted to work with Brandy. She sings like a hummingbird,&quot; adding: &quot;She really trusted me and wanted to do whatever I wanted to do. I make something and then play it for her, and she&#x27;d go crazy. Then she&#x27;d go arrange her vocals and play it for me, and I&#x27;d go crazy. That&#x27;s how we worked.&quot;
Opening track &quot;Who I Am&quot;, the album&#x27;s only contribution by Warryn &quot;Baby Dubb&quot; Campbell, was an eleventh-hour addition to the album&#x27;s final track listing. Built around a pirouetting keyboard melody, the song discusses Brandy&#x27;s rocky relationship with Smith as well as her public image in open letter form. Second track &quot;Afrodisiac&quot;, the album&#x27;s title track and second international single, was generally well received by critics, and enjoyed moderate success throughout Asia and Europe. Depicting a woman&#x27;s aphrodisiac affection with a man, it combines elements of pop and dance music, incorporating elements of fellow Timbaland-production &quot;Are You That Somebody?&quot; as performed by Aaliyah. Brandy has declared the song her favorite cut on the record. Alongside &quot;Afrodisiac&quot;, third track &quot;Who Is She 2 U&quot; was one of the first songs the singer worked on with Timbaland and his crew. Based around true events, the song describes a woman who is suspicious about her mate&#x27;s awkward behavior around a seemingly unfamiliar woman. The dramatic up-tempo incorporates chamber pop string melodies and go-go drum programming. An unofficial but prominent duet version of the track featuring vocals by fellow R&amp;B singer Usher was released on various mixtapes in late 2004.

Lead single &quot;Talk About Our Love&quot;, the result of additional recording sessions with rapper Kanye West and violinist Miri Ben-Ari, was not composed until late into the production of the album and describes the pressures of other people meddling into relationships. Iron Maiden-sampling &quot;I Tried&quot; is a downbeat midtempo track and ode to British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It talks about the singer listening to Coldplay&#x27;s song &quot;Sparks&quot; as she regrets playing the fool for an unfaithful ex-lover. Considered to be released as a single at times, it drew comparisons to Justin Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; in style and music. &quot;Where You Wanna Be&quot;, another West production, features a bridge by rapper T.I. and deals with a woman&#x27;s lover not getting his priorities in order as she is requesting him to make a decision between his friends, his career choices, and her. Brandy chronicles her ups and downs on mid-tempo track &quot;Focus,&quot; the album&#x27;s seventh track, on which she struggles not to let an old habit back in her life. The &quot;ambient soul&quot; song, which Brandy ranked among her favorite tracks on the album, consists of stuttering synths and instrumentation from heavy bass and an electric guitar. Eight track &quot;Sadiddy&quot; is built around a hand-clap-laden synth beat and one of the few up-tempo tracks on the album. It talks about Brandy not being &quot;seddity&quot; and the consequences of going against her.

Ninth track &quot;Turn It Up&quot; is one of several songs that reference Aaliyah. A 1990s tribute cut that combines elements of old school hip hop with Timbaland&#x27;s beatboxing instrumentals, the song was the first full-length release preceding the album as a promotional buzz track in fall 2003. Although the song was not released commercially, it appeared on several charts, reaching number two on the Deutsche Urban Charts in Germany. The tenth song, &quot;Necessary&quot;, written by Cee Lo Green, discusses Brandy&#x27;s desire for her hard work to matter to loved ones, and features a syncopated, skipping beat. Eleventh track, the soulful and minimalistic &quot;Say You Will&quot; saw a woman ready to settle down, and urging her mate to join her in a domestic life. &quot;How I Feel&quot;, a serene, smoky ballad, features Brandy warning her mate that his busy life was slowly pushing her away. The song was blend of the adult-oriented urban pop of her former albums, and the more ambient, bluesy work she was dabbling with. &quot;Should I Go&quot;, based upon Coldplay&#x27;s song &quot;Clocks&quot;, is built on percussive beats, syncopated handclaps and a piano riff. Lyrically, Brandy as the protagonist openly talks about contemplating stepping away from the music business, admitting that she&#x27;s trying to figure out where she fits in today.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Afrodisiac&quot; was released in the United States on June 29, 2004 by Atlantic Records; its limited edition with three bonus tracks was released exclusively in France on October 18 by East West Records. Promotion for &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; first began with a massive media event in Montego Bay, Jamaica, where the album was previewed to a hand-picked list of journalists at a press launch held in the Royal Pavilion of the Half Moon Hotel. Promotional touring for the album started on May 23, 2004 with a series major national television appearances, highlighted by performances on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on July 13, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show as part of their outdoor &quot;Toyota Concert Series&quot; on July 16, and ABC&#x27;s &quot;The View&quot; on July 19. Brandy also performed on both CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and the syndicated &quot;On-Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot; on July 14. Outside the United States, she made appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Anke Late Night&quot;, where she performed a rendition of Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;One Moment in Time&quot; in the form of a coffee commercial.

Additionally, Brandy was seen in a host of special programming airing on music television networks BET, MTV, VH1, and Fuse. The album&#x27;s arrival in stores was celebrated with an appearance as a presenter at the 2004 BET Awards, preceded by a special live performance on &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot;. On July 1, she headed to New York City for appearances on MTV&#x27;s &quot;TRL&quot; and Fuse&#x27;s &quot;Daily Download&quot;. In addition, tracks from &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; were streamed over one million times via MTV.com&#x27;s &quot;The Leak&quot; in the week preceding the album&#x27;s release. Online, Brandy was introduced as the LAUNCHcast &quot;Artist of the Month&quot; for July 2004. The promotion included exclusive interviews and performances as well as contests to win live video chats with her. The &quot;Talk About Our Love&quot; online campaign kicked off with an AOL &quot;First Listen&quot; premiere, and Brandy was AOL&#x27;s &quot;Artist of the Month&quot; for June 2004. Her Sessions@AOL performance debuted on the service in July.

==Singles==
Excluding the buzz track &quot;Turn It Up&quot; released in November 2003, &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; produced three official singles. &quot;Talk About Our Love&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on March 28, 2004. While the song was critically appreciated, it achieved limited commercial success worldwide—peaking only at number 36 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100— though managing to reach the top ten on the UK Singles Chart and the US Hot Singles Sales.

In North America, &quot;Who Is She 2 U&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second and final single. Suffering from low airplay, the song never made it out of the lower half of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and emerged as one of Brandy&#x27;s lowest-charting singles, peaking at number 85. In March 2005, the song also received a limited release in Europe to promote the release of her first greatest hits album &quot;The Best of Brandy&quot; (2005), but failed to chart or sell noticeably, reaching only number 50 on the UK Singles Chart.

Outside the United States, the title track served as the album&#x27;s second single. Released to greater success than &quot;Talk About Our Love&quot; in almost all the countries it was released in, the song reached number eleven in the United Kingdom and made it to top thirty in France and Ireland. Plans for a fourth single, including contender &quot;I Tried&quot;, failed to materialize.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Afrodisiac&quot; became her best-received album at the time of its release, averaging 73 out of 100 among averaged reviews on Metacritic. Andy Kellman of AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars and praised it as &quot;Brandy&#x27;s fourth consecutive durable showing, [...] stocked with a number of spectacular—and emotionally resonant—singles that wind up making for her most accomplished set yet.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album an A− rating, calling it &quot;Brandy&#x27;s meatiest album to date,&quot; and ranked it sixth on his personal year-end top ten list. He found special approval for Timbaland, &quot;who produced most of the disc, turns up the bass, the volume, and the tension whenever he can, bolstering her less-than-commanding, down-pillow-soft voice.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer James Hunter, like both Kellman and Browne, compared the album to &quot;Janet Jackson at her best: She&#x27;s a pop star, but she&#x27;s making the most of her big studio budgets and is following her muse.&quot; He described the set as &quot;mainstream soul with eccentric details and shadings&quot; and gave the album four stars out of five.

&quot;Vibe&quot; writer Laura Checkoway gave &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; three and a half out of five stars and noted it as &quot;a far cry from the pleasing pubescent fluff of her formative years&quot;, and although she felt that &quot;Brandy&#x27;s sultry alto drowns on some songs&quot;, she acknowledged that &quot;while Brandy&#x27;s musical liaison with Timbaland is what some people might call a match made in heaven, it&#x27;s her crazy, sexy, cool revival that&#x27;s the true bliss of this fourth coming.&quot; Steve Jones from &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the album a three out of four stars rating, and commented: &quot;Timbaland provides her with plenty of funk-infused beats to groove to [and] while a few of the tracks are a bit pedestrian, Brandy is still seductive more often that not.&quot; Ben Sisario, who wrote for &quot;Blender&quot; and gave the album three out of five stars, summed the album as &quot;an episode of her growing-pains TV show &quot;Moesha&quot;: This week, our honey-voiced heroine sheds her girlishness, sexing up to become &#x27;a woman, a passionate woman&#x27;,&quot; referring to its lyrical makeover. He called non-Timbaland productions like &quot;Talk About Our Love&quot; and &quot;Say You Will&quot; the highlights of the album. In 2012, amid the release of Norwood&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Two Eleven&quot;, Noah Berlatsky of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; called &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; &quot;the best album of Brandy&#x27;s career and one of the greatest R&amp;B albums of the last 25 years.&quot;

==Accolades==
=== Year-end rankings ===
&quot;Afrodisiac&quot; was named the fourth best album of 2004 by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;. The publication&#x27;s editor Sal Cinquemani called it &quot;a devastating yet confident break-up album [and] extraordinarily personal, often heart-wrenching R&amp;B record.&quot; David Browne from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the album sixth on his &quot;Best of 2004 Music&quot; top ten list and remarked that &quot;Brandy remains the queen of the R&amp;B murmur but the producers, especially the ever-inventive Timbaland, compensate with dramatic, rumbly, off-kilter beats and tones that add gravitas to this rueful ex-teen star. Everything — the rhythms, the mopey songs, Brandy&#x27;s delivery — simmers, but ferociously.&quot; The album finished eighth on Nekesa Mumbi Moody&#x27;s &quot;10 best albums&quot; list for Associated Press. She wrote that &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; &quot;was surely [Brandy&#x27;s] best. From the tell-all, autobiographical themes to the hypnotic beats, this album captures your attention from the first note and refuses to be ignored.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; within their &quot;Top 50 Records of 2004&quot; list, and dubbed it &quot;not only her best but also the year&#x27;s outstanding R&amp;B disc.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Afrodisiac&quot; debuted at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200—behind Lloyd Banks&#x27; &quot;The Hunger for More&quot; and Usher&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot;—and at number four on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, selling 131,700 copies in its first week. Though sales soon declined and the album fell short off the upper half of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in its eighth week, it was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000 copies, including actual sales of 417,000 copies.

Internationally, &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; failed to reach the top thirty on all of the charts it appeared on except for Japan and Switzerland, where it managed to debut at numbers ten and 26, respectively. In the United Kingdom, the album was awarded a silver certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on September 24, 2004, for selling 60,000 copies.

==Impact and legacy==
Despite its critical success, the album was largely seen as a commercial disappointment compared to Brandy&#x27;s previous studio albums, due to the less-than-expected performance of its singles and the album itself. Both Brandy and Timbaland later expressed frustration with the album, citing label interference with the creative process, politics, and mismanagement for the album&#x27;s performance. After failing to properly secure a joint-headlining tour with Usher, Brandy asked for and received an unconditional release from Atlantic Records in October 2004, citing her wish &quot;to move on&quot; as the main reason for her decision. Completing her contract with the label, a greatest hits album titled &quot;The Best of Brandy&quot; was released in March 2005. Released without any new material, it reached the top thirty in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, where the collection was appreciated by contemporary critics who noted the creativity of Brandy&#x27;s back catalog. Andy Kellman of AllMusic expressed: &quot;This set, unlike so many other anthologies from her contemporaries, hardly confirms dwindling creativity or popularity.&quot; Thereupon, she reportedly began shopping a new record deal under the auspices of Knockout Entertainment, her brother Ray J&#x27;s vanity label.

Although not initially receiving public and commercial praise until years after its release, the album is widely revered by critics, musicians, audiences. Serving as an inspiration for other artists, &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; has been credited as one of a precursors to the PBR&amp;B subgenre. In a 2014 music and fashion conversation with NPR, singer and model Solange discussed the album, saying &quot;Brandy is really the foundation of a lot of this very innovative, progressive, experimental R&amp;B. Brandy really influenced a lot of that. Frank Ocean will say it. Miguel will say it.&quot; Barbadian singer Rihanna revealed in an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that her third studio album &quot;Good Girl Gone Bad&quot; (2007) was primarily influenced by &quot;Afrodisiac&quot;, stating: &quot;Brandy&#x27;s album really helped to inspire, because that album I listen to all day, all night when I was in the studio [...] I really admired that every song was a great song.&quot; Rock musician John Frusciante, guitarist of the rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, mentioned that Brandy and the album were the &quot;main inspiration&quot; behind the guitar work on the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; Grammy Award-winning album &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; (2006). In 2008, singer Beyoncé chose the album cut &quot;Focus&quot; for her personal music playlist on iTunes, citing her love for the lyrics, as well as Brandy&#x27;s voice and vocal arrangements. Hip hop producer Hit-Boy has often lauded the album as an influence on his work via his social media outlets. Singer Nivea interpolated the song &quot;I Tried&quot; on her song &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (2010).

<text>Vergangenheitsbewältigung (, &quot;struggle of overcoming the past&quot; or &quot;work of coping with the past&quot;) is a German compound noun describing processes that since the later 20th century have become key in the study of post-1945 German literature, society, and culture.

The German Duden lexicon defines &quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot; as &quot;public debate within a country on a problematic period of its recent history—in Germany on National Socialism, in particular&quot;—where &quot;problematic&quot; refers to traumatic events that raise sensitive questions of collective culpability. In Germany, the word originally referred to anger and remorse about the war crimes of the Wehrmacht, the Holocaust, and related events of the early and mid-20th century, including World War II. In the sense of a quest for a new German identity, the word can refer to the psychological process of denazification.

After the reunification of 1990 (the accession of the former German Democratic Republic into the current Federal Republic of Germany) and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, &quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot; also referred to coming to terms with East German Communism.

==Historical development==
&quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot; describes the attempt to analyze, digest and learn to live with the past, in particular the Holocaust. The focus on learning is much in the spirit of philosopher George Santayana&#x27;s oft-quoted observation that &quot;those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it&quot;. It is a technical term also used in English that was coined after 1945 in West Germany, relating specifically to the atrocities committed in Nazi Germany, and to both historical and contemporary concerns about the extensive degree to which Nazism compromised and many German cultural, religious, and political institutions. The term therefore deals at once with the concrete responsibility of the German state (West Germany assumed the legal obligations of the &quot;Reich&quot;) and of individual Germans for what took place &quot;under Hitler&quot;, and with questions about the roots of legitimacy in a society whose development of the Enlightenment collapsed in the face of Nazi ideology.

===After denazification===
Historically, &quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot; often is seen as the logical &quot;next step&quot; after a denazification drive under both the Allied Occupation and by the Christian Democratic Union government of Konrad Adenauer, and began in the late 1950s and early 1960s, roughly the period in which the work of the &quot;Wiederaufbau&quot; (reconstruction) became less absorbing and urgent. Having replaced the institutions and power structures of Nazism, the aim of liberal Germans was to deal with the guilt of recent history. &quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot; is marked by learning from the past in ways such as honestly admitting that such a past did indeed exist, attempting to remedy as far as possible the wrongs committed, and attempting to move on from that past.

===Religion and education===
The German churches, of which only a minority played a significant role in the resistance to Nazism, have led the way in this process. They have notably developed a unique German postwar theology of repentance. At the regular mass church rallies, the Lutheran Kirchentag and the Catholic &quot;Katholikentag&quot;, for example, have developed this theme as a leitmotiv of Christian youth.

&quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot; has been expressed by the society through its schools, where in most German states the centrally-written provides each child with repeated lessons on different aspects of Nazism in German history, politics and religion classes from the fifth grade onwards, related to their maturity. Associated school trips may have destinations of concentration camps. Jewish Holocaust survivors are often invited to schools as guest speakers, though the passage of time limits these opportunities as their generation has aged.

===Philosophy===
In philosophy, Theodor Adorno&#x27;s writings include the lecture &quot;Was bedeutet: Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit?&quot; (&quot;What is meant by &#x27;working through the past&#x27;?&quot;), a subject related to his thinking of &quot;after Auschwitz&quot; in his later work. He delivered the lecture on 9 November 1959 at a conference on education held in Wiesbaden. Writing in the context of a new wave of antisemitic attacks against synagogues and Jewish community institutions occurring in West Germany at that time, Adorno rejected the contemporary catch phrase &quot;working through the past&quot; as misleading. He argued that it masked a denial, rather than signifying the kind of critical self-reflection that Freudian theory called for in order to &quot;come to terms&quot; with the past.

Adorno&#x27;s lecture is often seen as consisting in part of a variably implicit and explicit critique of the work of Martin Heidegger, whose formal ties to the Nazi Party are well known. Heidegger had attempted to provide a historical conception of Germania as a philosophical notion of German origin and destiny (later he would speak of &quot;the West&quot;). Alexander García Düttmann&#x27;s &quot;Das Gedächtnis des Denkens. Versuch über Heidegger und Adorno&quot; (&quot;The Memory of Thought: An Essay on Heidegger and Adorno&quot;, translated by Nicholas Walker) attempts to treat the philosophical value of these seemingly opposed and certainly incompatible terms &quot;Auschwitz&quot; and &quot;Germania&quot; in the philosophy of both men.

===Culture===
In the cultural sphere, the term &quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot; is associated with a movement in German literature whose notable authors include Günter Grass and Siegfried Lenz. Lenz&#x27;s novel &quot;Deutschstunde&quot; and Grass&#x27;s &quot;Danziger Trilogie&quot; both deal with childhoods under Nazism.

The erection of public monuments to Holocaust victims has been a tangible commemoration of Germany&#x27;s &quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot;. Concentration camps, such as Dachau, Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen and Flossenbürg, are open to visitors as memorials and museums. Most towns have plaques on walls marking the spots where particular atrocities took place.

When the seat of government was moved from Bonn to Berlin in 1999, an extensive &quot;Holocaust memorial&quot;, designed by architect Peter Eisenman, was planned as part of the extensive development of new official buildings in the district of Berlin-Mitte; it was opened on 10 May 2005. The informal name of this memorial, the &quot;Holocaust-Mahnmal,&quot; is significant. It does not translate easily: &quot;Holocaust Cenotaph&quot; would be one sense, but the noun &quot;Mahnmal,&quot; which is distinct from the term &quot;Denkmal&quot; (typically used to translate &quot;memorial&quot;) carries the sense of &quot;admonition&quot;, &quot;urging&quot;, &quot;appeal&quot;, or &quot;warning&quot;, rather than &quot;remembrance&quot; as such. The work is formally known as &quot;Das Denkmal für die ermordeten Juden Europas&quot; (English translation, &quot;The Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe&quot;). Some controversy attaches to it precisely because of this formal name and its exclusive emphasis on Jewish victims. As Eisenman acknowledged at the opening ceremony, &quot;It is clear that we won&#x27;t have solved all the problemsarchitecture is not a panacea for evilnor will we have satisfied all those present today, but this cannot have been our intention.&quot;

==Actions of other European countries==

In Austria, ongoing arguments about the nature and significance of the Anschluss, and unresolved disputes about legal expressions of obligation and liability, have led to very different concerns, and to a far less institutionalized response by the government. Since the late 20th century, observers and analysts have expressed concerns about the ascent of &quot;Haiderism&quot;.

Poland has maintained a museum, archive, and research institute at Oświęcim () ever since a 2 July 1947 act of the Polish Parliament. In the same year, Czechoslovakia established what was known as the &quot;National Suffering Memorial&quot; and later as the Terezín memorial in Terezín, Czech Republic. This site during the Holocaust was known as the concentration camp of Theresienstadt. In the context of varying degrees of Communist orthodoxy in both countries during the period of Soviet domination of Eastern Europe through much of the late 20th century, historical research into the Holocaust was politicized to varying degrees. Marxist doctrines of class struggle were often overlaid onto generally received histories, which tended to exclude both acts of collaboration and antisemitism in these nations.

The advance of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, &quot;Aktion Reinhardt&quot;, and many other significant events in the Holocaust occurred in German-occupied Europe, outside the present-day borders of the Federal Republic. The history of the memorials and archives which have been erected at these sites in eastern Europe is associated with the Communist regimes that ruled these areas for more than four decades after World War II. The Nazis promoted an idea of an expansive German nation extending into territories where ethnic Germans had previously settled. They invaded and controlled much of Central and Eastern Europe, unleashing violence against various Slavic groups, as well as Jews, Communists, prisoners of war, etc. After the war, the eastern European nations expelled German settlers as well as long settled ethnic Germans (the &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;) as a reaction to Nazi Germany&#x27;s attempt to claim the eastern lands on behalf of ethnic Germans.

==Analogous processes elsewhere==

In some of its aspects, &quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung&quot; can be compared to the attempts of other democratic countries to raise consciousness and come to terms with earlier periods of governmental and insurgency abuses, such as the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which investigated human rights abuses by both the National Party Government in South Africa under apartheid and by senior members of the African National Congress including Winnie Mandela and by the ANC&#x27;s paramilitary wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe.

Comparisons have been made with the Soviet process of &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot;, though this was less focused on the past than achieving a level of open criticism necessary for progressive reform to take place. 

It was widely assumed during this time that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union would maintain its monopoly on power. American journalist David Remnick has argued that once Memorial was founded by former Soviet dissidents in 1987 and began independently researching and publicizing accurate historical information about Soviet war crimes and the location of mass graves containing the victims of the Red Terror, Stalinism, and the Gulag; the clock began ticking on the continued survival of the Communist system.

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the continuing efforts in nations of eastern Europe and the independent states of the former Soviet Union to research and publicize the Communist and Stalinist past, as well as its countless human rights abuses, is sometimes referred to as a post-communist equivalent to &quot;Vergangenheitsbewältigung.&quot;

The well-documented history of Japanese war crimes, both before and during World War II is something the then-future Emperor Naruhito expressed his concerns about in February 2015, regarding how accurately such events are remembered in 21st century Japan.

<doc id="1036971" wikidata="Q7544617" url="?curid=1036971" title="Smile (musical)">
<text>Smile is a musical with music by Marvin Hamlisch and book and lyrics by Howard Ashman. It was originally produced on Broadway in 1986. The musical is based loosely on the 1975 comedy film of the same title, from a screenplay by Jerry Belson.

==Original film==
The original 1975 film was directed by Michael Ritchie with a screenplay by Jerry Belson. It starred Barbara Feldon as Brenda DiCarlo, Nicholas Pryor as Andy DiCarlo (Brenda&#x27;s husband in the film), Bruce Dern as Big Bob Freelander, Geoffrey Lewis as Wilson Shears, Joan Prather as Robin Gibson, Annette O&#x27;Toole as Doria Hudson, Melanie Griffith as Karen Love, and choreographer Michael Kidd as Tommy French. The movie was filmed on location in Santa Rosa, California with the pageant festivities at Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Auditorium.

==Production and premiere==
The original production opened on Broadway on November 24, 1986 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre and closed on January 3, 1987 after 48 performances. It was directed by Howard Ashman with musical staging by Mary Kyte. It received a Tony Award nomination for Best Book of a Musical as well as Drama Desk Award nominations for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical (Michael O&#x27;Gorman) and Outstanding Costume Design (William Ivey Long).

&quot;Smile&quot; is considered a &quot;lost&quot; musical because no official cast recording was ever made. However, there does exist a demo CD by Broadway Original cast for Samuel French Publishing, which is a primary source for groups performing the show. Because of that, demos by original cast are audible at their merchandizing site, but they have never been released publicly. Some of the songs from the show, &quot;Disneyland,&quot; &quot;Smile,&quot; and &quot;In Our Hands,&quot; received their first recordings on Bruce Kimmel&#x27;s &quot;Unsung Musicals&quot; album, released by Varèse Sarabande. &quot;Disneyland&quot; was sung by Jodi Benson, who originated it in the show. On a subsequent volume &quot;Maria&#x27;s Song&quot; was also recorded. In November 2008, the record label PS Classics rectified this loss, releasing the album &quot;Howard Sings Ashman&quot;. The second disc is comprised completely of songs from &quot;Smile&quot;, sung by Ashman and Marvin Hamlisch, with Hamlisch at the piano. They also put a transcript of a taped conversation between Ashman, Hamlisch and Bob Fosse discussing the development of the musical on their website.

==Subsequent activity==
After the Broadway production of &quot;Smile&quot; flopped, Ashman and Hamlisch revised the show for stock productions. Book changes include the change of Shawn&#x27;s roommate from Connie-Sue to Maria, and the addition of some material for Bob. The score was further revised, gaining a completely re-structured opening number (though retaining most of the original melody and words), a new song for Brenda (&quot;Very Best Week of Your Lives&quot;) that completely replaced the Orientation Sequence musically, a new song for Bob (&quot;Bob&#x27;s Song&quot;), a new number for the winner of the pageant (&quot;There Goes the Girl&quot;) and a completely new melody and lyric set for Robin&#x27;s letters home and a slight decrease in the time given to them. The ending was also re-worked giving Bob a significant musical section new to the revised version.

Many of the small lyric changes to the licensed version actually originated before the Broadway production. When reading Lincoln Center&#x27;s photocopy of the Broadway rehearsal script to &quot;Smile&quot;, many of the licensed lyrics are printed but scratched out and replaced with what was sung at the Lunt-Fontanne, handwritten.

An hour-long recording of the licensed version was made for Samuel French (the licensing agent) to distribute to groups interested in performing &quot;Smile&quot;. It uses many of the original Broadway cast, including Marsha Waterbury, Jodi Benson, Anne Marie Bobby, Tia Riebling and Dick Patterson. Director and author Howard Ashman played the role of Big Bob in Jeff McCarthy&#x27;s absence. This recording is often referred to incorrectly as an unreleased cast recording when it is in fact a demo.

A private &quot;industry&quot; reading was scheduled for November 19, 2010, reflecting the revisions.

A production of &quot;Smile&quot; was presented by Awkward Stage Productions in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Awkward Stage&#x27;s production featured all the adult characters being played by puppets (a la &quot;Avenue Q&quot; style puppetry). Awkward Stage Productions&#x27; version of &quot;Smile&quot; was presented at the Firehall Arts Centre as part of the Vancouver International Fringe Festival September 8–18 2011, as well as at the Norman Rothstein Theatre in Vancouver, October 26–30, 2011.

The &quot;Smile&quot; reunion concert was presented at 54 Below, New York City, New York, on September 22, 2014. The concert featured Jodi Benson, Mana Allen, Anne Bobby, Cheryl-Ann Rossi, and other original Broadway casts.

==Summary==
&quot;Smile&quot; chronicles the backstage troubles of the fictional 1985 California Young American Miss beauty pageant held in Santa Rosa, California. The main characters include Robin Gibson and Doria Hudson, two contestants who befriend and help each other throughout the week; Brenda DiCarlo Freelander, an ex-Young American Miss second-runner-up coordinating the pageant; and Brenda&#x27;s husband Big Bob, an RV salesman trying to help her through the week.

==Story==
Synopsis follows the plot of the revised licensed version.

===Act 1===
The show opens with Dale Wilson Shears, chairman of the fictitious Young American Miss Foundation, explaining to the audience the qualities of an ideal Young American Miss. The contestants begin to enter and, throughout the course of the song, prepare for their journey to the pageant in Santa Rosa, waving goodbye as the number ends. (&quot;Typical High School Senior&quot;). In Santa Rosa, pageant coordinator Brenda Dicarlo Freelander and head judge Big Bob Freelander are photographed for a Jaycee newsletter. Brenda receives a letter that Wilson Shears himself will be attending the pageant. When the girls arrive, Brenda gives them an orientation presentation of what to expect during the upcoming week (&quot;The Very Best Week of Your Lives&quot;). The audience learns that Brenda is a former Young American Miss herself. The story then switches over to the dorms, where two sets of roommates, Maria and Shawn and Doria and Robin, are getting ready for bed. Doria, an experienced contestant, talks about her passion for pageants with Robin while the latter writes a postcard to her mother (&quot;Dear Mom #1&quot;). When Robin is finished, Doria relates the memory of her first pageant, a television broadcast of the Miss Anaheim pageant in Disneyland, and sings of her dream to someday go there in person (&quot;Disneyland&quot;).

The next morning, Little Bob is caught staring at the pageant applications by his father. Oblivious to Little Bob&#x27;s less-than-wholesome interest in the girls, Big Bob praises him for taking an interest in the pageant. The girls enter and begin to learn a difficult dance routine under famed choreographer Tommy French (&quot;Shine&quot;). During the song, several girls break away from the dance and give short speeches to Social Clubs, the local sponsors of the event. The girls exit and Brenda vows that she will stay cool under the watchful eye of Wilson Shears and the national foundation, unlike her own Young American Miss finals eighteen years ago.

Robin, who has no experience in pageants, is worn out and wants to leave (&quot;Dear Mom #2&quot;). Meanwhile, Shawn has become angry over the attention Mexican-American Maria is garnering from the judges and sponsors. Shawn voices her wishes to get Maria out of the competition to Valerie, another contestant. The scene shifts to Big Bob in a meeting with the other judges. He asks them to look beyond the appearance of the girls and look into their hearts, and how nobody does this. (&quot;Bob&#x27;s Song&quot;). Late that night, Little Bob and his friend Freddy are seen sneaking around the building where the pageant will be held. Their plan, to sell nude photos of the girls to local kids, is revealed. The scene changes to the next morning, as the girls complain of various ailments brought on by the intense dance workouts, a lack of sleep, and the subpar food as Brenda passes out the day&#x27;s schedule (&quot;Nerves&quot;). Private interviews with the judges are held. Robin, who is fatherless but refuses to play for sympathy, panics and runs out of the room when asked about her family. The girls, led by Tommy, rehearse for the upcoming Preliminary Night competition. However, the rehearsal is abruptly cut short when Tommy and Brenda argue over a large ramp extending into the audience. Although featured in Tommy&#x27;s plans, the ramp made unusable many seats that had already been sold. Brenda offers to deduct the cost of the seats from Tommy&#x27;s check, which prompts him to strike the ramp. When the girls try to rehearse without it, one of the contestants falls. Seeing Brenda&#x27;s lack of sympathy, Tommy tells her to deduct the money and proceed with the ramp. Preliminary night begins and the girls compete in three categories: Vim and Vigor, Scholastic Achievement, and Creative Talent. (&quot;Young and American&quot;). Sandra-Kay Macaffee, Robin Gibson, and Maria Gonzales win respectively in each category.

The girls return to the dorms and Doria, who believes she has no chance of winning the competition now, begins to pass on her knowledge of pageantry. The girls begin to sing of their anxiety for the pageant the next night, later joined by Brenda and Big Bob (&quot;Until Tomorrow Night&quot;). Shawn catches Little Bob and Freddy taking pictures of her in the shower and, though initially angry, strikes up a deal with them. The song ends in state of high anticipation.

===Act 2===
In the dressing room just before the pageant Robin writes a third letter to her mother (&quot;Dear Mom #3&quot;). The girls anxiously sing of the pageant as they make their final preparations and are introduced to the event&#x27;s MC, radio and television personality Ted Farley (&quot;Opening Act 2&quot;). The girls, preparations complete, exit. The &quot;pageant&quot; opens with Ted Farley greeting the audience and introducing the previous year&#x27;s winner, Joanne Marshall. The two dance briefly and the girls enter, carrying parasols (&quot;Smile&quot;). As they sing, each girl gets a chance to open her parasol and perform a brief quip. When Robin&#x27;s turn comes, her parasol breaks and she runs offstage. Encouraged by Tommy French, she runs on and ad-libs a quip before the dance moves on. The girls continue their dance as a slideshow of their photographs appear on a large screen. Each girl has a chance to pose in front of her photograph, concluding with Maria. However, to Maria&#x27;s shock and horror, the photo she sees is not a posed glamour shot, but a nude photo taken in the shower. Maria runs off and the action switches backstage. As Ted continues the show, Brenda attempts to persuade Maria to go back on stage and perform. Maria refuses and leaves.

Dale Wilson-Shears confronts Brenda about the catastrophe on stage as the girls perform an (off-stage) number (&quot;Get The Girls&quot;). After realizing that Maria was a finalist in the competition, she crosses her name off of the list and marches onto the pageant stage. After she gives an impassioned defense of the pageant and its honor, Ted announces the four finalists: Shawn, Sandra-Kay, Robin, and Doria. The girls sing as Ted introduces the finalists (&quot;We Wish We Were You&quot;). Backstage, Bob informs Brenda that the judges do not want to pick a winner in light of what happened. He and Brenda fight and Brenda fires Bob. The four finalists then give their final remarks before the winner is announced. (&quot;In Our Hands&quot;). Robin finally reveals to the judges that she is fatherless, and Big Bob finds out that his son is the one who took that picture. Ted and Joanne announce the first runner-up of the pageant, Doria Hudson. After a brief moment, the winner is announced as Sandra-Kay, Bakerfield&#x27;s Young American Miss. Ted sings as Sandra-Kay walks the runway (&quot;There Goes The Girl&quot;)

Wilson Shears congratulates Brenda on saving the pageant and offers her a spot on the National Committee. Brenda tries to reconcile with Bob, but to no avail. Bob, alone on stage, wonders how he can reconcile with his family. In their dorm room, Doria tries to convince Robin to join her in the Miss Sunbelt Pageant. Robin ultimately decides to go home to find her own destiny. When she sees that Robin has left without her, Doria takes a winner&#x27;s stance in her runner-up tiara and roses, once again singing of Disneyland, the only place she can feel loved and accepted (&quot;Finale&quot;)

<doc id="1036972" wikidata="Q3258211" url="?curid=1036972" title="Moret Law">
<text>The Moret Law was a form of freedom of wombs, which was implemented by Spain in Cuba and Puerto Rico, and named after Segismundo Moret who was Spain&#x27;s Minister of Overseas Territories at the time. This law implemented the abolition of slavery incrementally in Spain&#x27;s Caribbean colonies. It drew from older Later American manumission traditions such as the way favorite slaves have been previously liberated under certain conditions. 

== History ==
Latin America was one of the last holdouts of slavery in the Americas but after the United States Civil War in 1865, international pressure forced Spain to end slavery. Slavery was never formally abolished in Spain itself, but had gradually declined into insignificance there by the early-mid nineteenth century. The Moret Law was approved in Spain on July 4, 1870 for application in Cuba and later Puerto Rico, with other colonies following. This development was mainly attributed to the efforts of Moret, Roman Baldorioty de Castro, Luis Padial, and Julio Vizcarrondo. Spain also passed the law with the desire to preempt the independence movement in the colonies. 

The law granted freedom to children born to enslaved mothers after September 18, 1868, a date chosen to honor of the liberal revolution that swept Spain in 1869. The Moret Law was made to not only grant a free womb for enslaved women, but it was also made to ensure that children were not separated from their mothers if they were under 14 years old. The women use the Moret Law for their benefits and to help influence other enslaved women in the neighborhoods where they reside. It also freed slaves who served in the Spanish army (particularly those who fought in the Ten Years&#x27; War in Cuba), slaves over 60 years old (along with slaves who turned 60 thereafter), and slaves who were owned by the Spanish government. The Spanish government compensated slave owners 125 pesetas for each slave emancipated under the Moret Law. Slavery was abolished for Puerto Rico (but not for Cuba) in 1873 and finally, without exceptions, in 1886.

== Trivia ==
English rock band Radiohead named their 1993 debut album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, after the first call on this album (apparently having heard it on a bootleg tape), well before release of this material on CD.

California Punk band Nofx released a live album called &quot;&quot;I Heard They Suck Live!!&quot;,&quot; in which the guitar player (El Hefe), impersonates a part of &quot;Sol&#x27;s Warts&quot; in between songs.

<text>Grande-Terre Island ( ; or ) is the name of the eastern-half of Guadeloupe proper, in the Lesser Antilles. It is separated from the other half of Guadeloupe island, Basse-Terre, by a narrow sea channel called &quot;Rivière Salée&quot; (in English, Salt River). Pointe de la Grande Vigie, in Grande-Terre, is the northernmost point of Guadeloupe island. To the east lies La Désirade, and to the south lies Marie Galante.

Despite its name, Grande-Terre (literally &quot;Large Land&quot; in French) is smaller than Basse-Terre Island. It was called like that, in contrast with the much smaller Petite Terre Islands (&quot;Small Land&quot; Islands), two very small islands located about 10 km south-east of the Grande-Terre (see map to the left).

Grande-Terre&#x27;s indented coastline is surrounded by coral reefs and the island itself is a limestone plateau. Its surface is a series of rolling hills, white sand beaches and cliffs. The island&#x27;s beaches consist of both white and black sands, as well as beaches of golden sand. Of the two islands, Grande-Terre is home to the majority of Guadeloupe&#x27;s farmlands and tourist resorts.
The island has a land area of 586.68 km2. At the 2006 census the population of Grande-Terre was 197,603 inhabitants living in 10 communes (municipalities). The population density was 337 inhabitants per km2 (872 inh. per sq. miles). The most populated communes are, in descending order of population, Les Abymes (part of the Pointe-à-Pitre urban area), Le Gosier (part of the Pointe-à-Pitre urban area), Pointe-à-Pitre (part of the Pointe-à-Pitre urban area), Le Moule, Sainte-Anne, and Morne-à-l&#x27;Eau.

==History==
Historically, Grande-Terre Island was called &quot;cibuqueira&quot;, (&quot;Gum tree island&quot;, in the Caribbean language) and the island of Basse-Terre, &quot;Caloucaera&quot; (Karukera), a word meaning &quot;the island of beautiful waters&quot; in the Caribbean language.

<text>.cx is the country code top-level domain for Christmas Island administered by the Christmas Island Internet Administration, through the Christmas Island Domain Administration Limited. 

== Management ==
The Christmas Island Internet Administration is a community-owned non-profit company which also provides Internet service to the island&#x27;s residents. 

.cx is a member of the Council of Country Code Administrators, a group of country-code domains making use of common registry and/or dispute resolution services.

== History ==
The top-level domain was formerly administered by Planet Three Limited, a company with offices in the United Kingdom and Australia, which went bankrupt and ceased operations, voluntarily transferring management to the Christmas Island Internet Administration (called Dot CX Limited at the time). 

The local (shire) government of Christmas Island endorsed the transfer, but the Commonwealth of Australia (which has international authority over Christmas Island as an external territory) did not immediately approve it. 

Australia has since published a memorandum of understanding which recognises the Christmas Island Internet Administration as the legitimate manager of .cx.

== Controversy ==
The domain achieved a certain degree of notoriety when it was used for the shock site goatse.cx, to the point the Christmas Island Internet Administration was forced to take down the website following complaints by Christmas Islanders.

<text>Martin Böttcher (17 June 1927 – 20 April 2019) was a German composer, arranger and conductor.

==The beginning==
Böttcher (on foreign records and articles often written &quot;Bottcher&quot; or &quot;Boettcher&quot;, the latter being the correct transliteration of the German umlaut &quot;ö&quot;) began taking piano lessons at an early age. But his first passion was flying, and he wanted to become a test pilot. Not yet seventeen years old, he got his military training in the German Luftwaffe. However, due to lack of fuel, he never went into action.

As a prisoner of war, Böttcher managed to get hold of a guitar and taught himself to play it. Following his release from captivity, he went to Hamburg. There he started his musical career with the then &quot;Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk&quot;, in the dance and entertainment orchestra which had been newly founded by &quot;Willi Steiner&quot;, and which was held in high esteem in England.

He also gained important experience as an arranger for film composers, among them Michael Jary and Hans-Martin Majewski, for whom he arranged part of the music for &quot;Love &#x27;47&quot;.

==Early years==
In 1950, Böttcher, who liked to work on new sounds, recorded the first &quot;trick guitar&quot; pieces in Germany in the style of Les Paul. In 1954, Böttcher left the music stand and turned to manuscript paper. His talent did not escape the attention of the German film industry, which was just gaining new momentum at that time.

Thanks to film producer Artur Brauner, Böttcher made his cinematic debut in 1955, composing the music for the military satire &quot;The Captain and His Hero&quot;. His second film score turned out to be a milestone in German film history. &quot;Teenage Wolfpack&quot; directed by Georg Tressler and starring Horst Buchholz, met with tremendous success. &quot;Mr. Martin&#x27;s Band&quot; comprised the top German jazz musicians, among them Horst Fischer, Fatty George, Bill Grah, Ernst Mosch and Hans &#x27;James&#x27; Last.

Böttcher also composed for Hans Albers and for Heinz Rühmann&#x27;s &#x27;Father Brown&#x27; movies. &quot;Max the Pickpocket&quot; (1962) contained the track &quot;Hawaii Tattoo&quot; (recorded by &quot;The Waikikis&quot;), which Böttcher had written under the pseudonym of &quot;Michael Thomas&quot;. Within a short time, this theme became famous all over the world, and even received attention in the American &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

==The hit writer==

Martin Böttcher found his greatest success in the 1960s composing the score for ten of the Karl May films, the first being &quot;Der Schatz im Silbersee&quot; with the famous &quot;Old-Shatterhand-Melodie&quot;. The films starred, among many others, American actor Lex Barker and British actor Stewart Granger. The audience was enthusiastic about the wistful melodies, the fanfare-like music accompanying attacks, and the cheerful hillbilly tunes. Martin Böttcher&#x27;s main themes from these films reached top positions in the German charts and sold thousands of records. The music for the Winnetou films is a landmark in German film music history. The success of these films, accompanied by Böttcher&#x27;s music, made possible the &quot;Spaghetti Westerns&quot; with the music of Ennio Morricone.

With the German film industry declining at the end of the 1960s Martin Böttcher increasingly focused on working for German TV, which benefited from his talents in many films and series produced for TV.

In the 1970s Martin Böttcher wrote a number of successful scores, among them music for the TV series &quot;Sonderdezernat K1&quot; and numerous episodes of &quot;Der Alte&quot; and &quot;Derrick&quot;, which are also known outside Germany. He again came in contact with the works of Karl May when he wrote the score for the 26-episode series &quot;Kara Ben Nemsi Effendi&quot;. The writer of &quot;Der Illegale&quot; (a TV mini-series), Henry Kolarz, said, &quot;Even if I spoilt it, Böttcher&#x27;s music is much too good for everything to go wrong.&quot;

Throughout the following years Martin Böttcher composed yet more evergreen themes for TV-series, such as &quot;It can&#x27;t always be caviar&quot; (1977), &quot;Schöne Ferien &quot; (&quot;Beautiful holidays&quot;) or &quot;Forsthaus Falkenau&quot;. In the 1990s, among others, &quot;Air Albatros&quot; took off - a very special project for the composer, as he could pay a musical tribute to his passion for flying. And when Pierre Brice mounted his horse again as Winnetou for the ZDF television station, he was, of course, accompanied by a score by Martin Böttcher.

Even the Americans became aware of him as an arranger and orchestra director. When they heard his renditions of the world-famous themes &quot;Tara&#x27;s Theme&quot; and &quot;Theme from &#x27;A Summerplace&#x27;&quot;, Martin Böttcher was made an honorary member of the Max Steiner Society.

In 1998, the composer once more conquered the German charts. A band from Cologne, the &quot;Superboys&quot;, scored a hit with a vocal version of the &quot;Winnetou-Melodie&quot; from the second &quot;Winnetou&quot; film. Their song &quot;Ich wünscht&#x27; du wärst bei mir&quot; (&quot;Wish U Were Here&quot;) even reached the top of the ZDF television charts. Another cover version by the Czech group Těžkej Pokondr called &quot;Vinetu&quot; even received double-platinum in their country in March 2000.

The &quot;master of tunes&quot; was honoured in a very special way in 2002: as a jury member (Europäischer Förderpreis - a European talent award) Martin Böttcher represented Germany at that year&#x27;s &quot;European Biennale for Film Music&quot; in Bonn.

<text>Set and setting, when referring to a psychedelic drug experience or the use of other psychoactive substances, means one&#x27;s mindset (shortened to &quot;set&quot;) and the physical and social environment (the &quot;setting&quot;) in which the user has the experience. Set and setting are factors that can condition the effects of psychoactive substances: &quot;Set&quot; refers to the mental state a person brings to the experience, like thoughts, mood and expectations; &quot;setting&quot; to the physical and social environment. This is especially relevant for psychedelic experiences in either a therapeutic or recreational context.

== History ==
According to the 2018 book &quot;How to Change Your Mind&quot; by Michael Pollan, the concept of set and setting was observed by the &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot; of LSD, Al Hubbard, visiting mushroom ceremonies in Mexico. The terms were used at least as early as 1958 by Ludwig von Bertalanffy and popularized by Timothy Leary in 1961, and became widely accepted by researchers in psychedelic therapy. Norman Zinberg also extensively discussed this in &quot;Drug, Set, and Setting: The Basis for Controlled Intoxicant Use&quot; (1984).

Due to the importance of setting in early psychedelic therapy, Hubbard introduced a &quot;treatment space decorated to feel more like a home than a hospital&quot;, which came to be known as a &quot;Hubbard Room&quot;. 
In 1966, Timothy Leary conducted a series of experiments with dimethyltryptamine (DMT) with controlled set and setting. The aim was to see whether DMT, which had then been mostly thought of as a terror-inducing drug, could produce pleasant experiences under a supportive set and setting. It was found that it could.

Set and setting has also been investigated from a religious perspective.

The concept of set and setting has more recently been extended beyond psychedelics. Zinberg &quot;sought to integrate the ideas of set and setting into a theory of harm reduction which examined not only psychedelic use but also drugs such as alcohol, cocaine, and heroin&quot; and, more recently, the concept has been used to understand the circumstances of opioid overdoses.

== Practice ==
Social support networks have shown to be particularly important in the outcome of the psychedelic experience. They are able to control or guide the course of the experience, both consciously and subconsciously. Stress, fear, a disagreeable material, social, and cultural environment, including situations of racism or discrimination, may result in an unpleasant experience (bad trip). Conversely, a relaxed, curious person in a warm, comfortable and safe place is more likely to have a pleasant experience.

Research has shown that a curated music playlist can be part of a favourable setting. Set and setting are critical in the design of psychiatric facilities and modalities of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies.

<text>Citizenship in ancient Rome () was a privileged political and legal status afforded to free individuals with respect to laws, property, and governance. Citizenship in ancient Rome was complex and based upon many different laws, traditions, and cultural practices. There existed several different types of citizenship, determined by one&#x27;s gender, class, and political affiliations, and the exact duties or expectations of a citizen varied throughout the history of the Roman Empire.

== History ==
The oldest document currently available that details the rights of citizenship is the Twelve Tables, ratified 449 BC. Much of the text of the Tables only exists in fragments, but during the time of Ancient Rome the Tables would be displayed in full in the Roman Forum for all to see. The Tables detail the rights of citizens in dealing with court proceedings, property, inheritance, death, and (in the case of women) public behavior. Under the Roman Republic, the government conducted a census every five years in Rome to keep a record of citizens and their households. As the Roman Empire spread so did the practice of conducting a census.

Roman citizens were expected to perform some duties (&quot;munera publica&quot;) to the state in order to retain their rights as citizens. Failure to perform citizenship duties could result in the loss of privileges, as seen during the Second Punic War when men who refused military service lost their right to vote and were forced out of their voting tribes. Women were exempt from direct taxation and military service. Anyone living in any province of Rome was required to register with the census. The exact extent of civic duties varied throughout the centuries.

Much of Roman law involving the rights and functions of citizenship revolved around legal precedents. Documents from Roman writer Valerius Maximus indicate that Roman women were in later centuries able to mingle freely about the Forum and to bring in concerns on their own volition, providing they acted in a manner that was becoming of their family and station.

Much of our basis for understanding Roman law comes from the &quot;Digest&quot; of Emperor Justinian. The &quot;Digest&quot; contained court rulings by juries and their interpretations of Roman law and preserved the writings of Roman legal authors. 

=== The Edict of Caracalla ===

The Edict of Caracalla (officially the Constitutio Antoniniana in Latin: &quot;Constitution [or Edict] of Antoninus&quot;) was an edict issued in AD 212 by the Roman Emperor Caracalla, which declared that all free men in the Roman Empire were to be given full Roman citizenship and all free women in the Empire were given the same rights as Roman women, with the exception of the &quot;dediticii&quot;, people who had become subject to Rome through surrender in war, and freed slaves. Before the edict of Caracalla generalized Roman citizenship to many provinces of the empire, civitas (Roman citizenship) was very exclused and it was first extended a significant number of inhabitants of the Province of Africa Preconsularis and Numidia, they were given Roman citizenship following the Punic Wars, such as the case of Iomnium and others

By the century previous to Caracalla, Roman citizenship had already lost much of its exclusiveness and become more available between the inhabitants throughout the different provinces of the Roman Empire and between nobles such as kings of client countries. Before the Edict, however, a significant number of provincials were non-Roman citizens and held instead the Latin rights.

The Bible&#x27;s Book of Acts indicates that Paul the Apostle was a Roman citizen by birth – though not clearly specifying which class of citizenship – a fact which had considerable bearing on Paul&#x27;s career and on the religion of Christianity.

== Types of citizenship ==

Citizenship in Rome could be acquired through various means. To be born as a citizen required that both parents be free citizens of Rome. Another method was via the completion of a public service, such as serving in the non-Roman auxiliary forces. Cities could acquire citizenship through the implementation of the Latin law, wherein people of a provincial city of the empire could elect people to public office and therefore give the elected official citizenship.

The legal classes varied over time, however the following classes of legal status existed at various times within the Roman state:

===Cives Romani===
The &quot;cives Romani&quot; were full Roman citizens, who enjoyed full legal protection under Roman law. &quot;Cives Romani&quot; were sub-divided into two classes:

* The &quot;non optimo iure&quot; who held the &quot;ius commercii&quot; and &quot;ius conubii&quot; (rights of property and marriage)
* The &quot;optimo iure&quot;, who held these rights as well as the &quot;ius suffragii&quot; and &quot;ius honorum&quot; (the additional rights to vote and to hold office).

===Latini===

The &quot;Latini&quot; were a class of citizens who held the Latin rights (&quot;ius Latii&quot;), or the rights of &quot;ius commercii&quot; and &quot;ius migrationis&quot; (the right to migrate), but not the &quot;ius conubii&quot;. The term &quot;Latini&quot; originally referred to the Latins, citizens of the Latin League who came under Roman control at the close of the Latin War, but eventually became a legal description rather than a national or ethnic one. The Latin rights status could be assigned to different classes of citizens, such as freedmen, &quot;cives Romani&quot; convicted of crime, or colonial settlers.

===Socii===
Under Roman law, citizens of another state that was allied to Rome via treaty were assigned the status of &quot;socii&quot;. &quot;Socii&quot; (also known as &quot;foederati&quot;) could obtain certain legal rights of under Roman law in exchange for agreed upon levels of military service, i.e., the Roman magistrates had the right to levy soldier from such states into the Roman legions. However, &quot;foederati&quot; states that had at one time been conquered by Rome were exempt from payment of tribute to Rome due to their treaty status.

Growing dissatisfaction with the rights afforded to the &quot;socii&quot; and with the growing manpower demands of the legions (due to the protracted Jugurthine War and the Cimbrian War) led eventually to the Social War of 91–87 BC in which the Italian allies revolted against Rome.

The Lex Julia (in full the &quot;Lex Iulia de Civitate Latinis Danda&quot;), passed in 90 BC, granted the rights of the &quot;cives Romani&quot; to all &quot;Latini&quot; and &quot;socii&quot; states that had not participated in the Social War, or who were willing to cease hostilities immediately. This was extended to all the Italian &quot;socii&quot; states when the war ended (except for Gallia Cisalpina), effectively eliminating &quot;socii&quot; and &quot;Latini&quot; as legal and citizenship definitions.

===Provinciales===
&quot;Provinciales&quot; were those people who fell under Roman influence, or control, but who lacked even the rights of the &quot;foederati&quot;, essentially having only the rights of the &quot;ius gentium&quot; (rules and laws common to nations under Rome&#x27;s rule).

===Peregrini===
A &quot;peregrinus&quot; (plural &quot;peregrini&quot;) was originally any person who was not a full Roman citizen, that is someone who was not a member of the &quot;cives Romani&quot;. With the expansion of Roman law to include more gradations of legal status, this term became less used, but the term &quot;peregrini&quot; included those of the &quot;Latini&quot;, &quot;socii&quot;, and &quot;provinciales&quot;, as well as those subjects of foreign states.

=== Citizenship for different social classes ===
Individuals belonging to a specific social class in Rome had modified versions of citizenship.
* Roman women had a limited form of citizenship. They were not allowed to vote or stand for civil or public office. The rich might participate in public life by funding building projects or sponsoring religious ceremonies and other events. Women had the right to own property, to engage in business, and to obtain a divorce, but their legal rights varied over time. Marriages were an important form of political alliance during the Republic. Roman women mostly remained under the guardianship of their father (&quot;pater familias&quot;) or their closest male agnate.
* Client state citizens and allies &quot;(socii)&quot; of Rome could receive a limited form of Roman citizenship such as the Latin rights. Such citizens could not vote or be elected in Roman elections.
* Freedmen were former slaves who had gained their freedom. They were not automatically given citizenship and lacked some privileges such as running for executive magistracies. The children of freedmen and women were born as free citizens; for example, the father of the poet Horace was a freedman.
* Slaves were considered property and lacked legal personhood. Over time, they acquired a few protections under Roman law. Some slaves were freed by manumission for services rendered, or through a testamentary provision when their master died. Once free, they faced few barriers, beyond normal social stigma, to participating in Roman society. The principle that a person could become a citizen by law rather than birth was enshrined in Roman mythology; when Romulus defeated the Sabines in battle, he promised the war captives that were in Rome they could become citizens.

==Rights==

Roman citizens enjoyed a variety of specific privileges within Roman society. Male citizens had the rights to vote (&quot;ius suffragi&quot;) and hold civic office (&quot;ius honorum,&quot; only available to the aristocracy). They also possessed &quot;ius vitae necisque,&quot; &quot;the right of life and death.&quot; The male head of a Roman family (&quot;pater familias&quot;) had the right to legally execute any of his children at any age, although it appears that this was mostly reserved in deciding to raise newborn children.

More general rights included: the rights to property (&quot;ius census&quot;), to enter into contracts (&quot;ius commercii&quot;), &quot;ius provocationis,&quot; the right to appeal court decisions, the right to sue and to be sued, to have a legal trial, and the right of immunity from some taxes and other legal obligations, especially local rules and regulations.
With regards to the Roman family, Roman citizens possessed the right of &quot;ius conubii,&quot; defined as the right to a lawful marriage in which children from the union would also be Roman citizens. Earlier Roman sources indicate that Roman women could forfeit their individual rights as citizens when entering into a &quot;manus&quot; marriage. In a &quot;manus&quot; marriage, a woman would lose any properties or possessions she owned herself and they would be given to her husband, or his &quot;pater familias&quot;. &quot;Manus&quot; marriages had largely stopped by the time of Augustus and women instead remained under the protection of their &quot;pater familias.&quot; Upon his death, both the men and women under the protection of the &quot;pater familias&quot; would be considered &quot;sui iuris&quot; and be legally independent, able to inherit and own property without the approval of their &quot;pater familias.&quot; Roman woman however would enter into a &quot;tutela&quot;, or guardianship. A woman&#x27;s tutor functioned similarly to a &quot;pater familias&quot;, but he did not control the property or possessions of a woman and was generally only needed to give his permission when a woman wanted to perform certain legal actions, such as freeing her slaves.

Officially, one required Roman citizenship status to enrol in the Roman legions, but this requirement was sometimes overlooked and exceptions could be made. Citizen soldiers could be beaten by the centurions and senior officers for reasons related to discipline. Non-citizens joined the and gained citizenship through service.

Following the early 2nd-century BC Porcian Laws, a Roman citizen could not be tortured or whipped and could commute sentences of death to voluntary exile, unless he was found guilty of treason. If accused of treason, a Roman citizen had the right to be tried in Rome, and even if sentenced to death, no Roman citizen could be sentenced to crucifixion.

&quot;Ius gentium&quot; was the legal recognition, developed in the 3rd century BC, of the growing international scope of Roman affairs, and the need for Roman law to deal with situations between Roman citizens and foreign persons. The &quot;ius gentium&quot; was therefore a Roman legal codification of the widely accepted international law of the time, and was based on the highly developed commercial law of the Greek city-states and of other maritime powers. The rights afforded by the &quot;ius gentium&quot; were considered to be held by all persons; it is thus a concept of human rights rather than rights attached to citizenship.

&quot;Ius migrationis&quot; was the right to preserve one&#x27;s level of citizenship upon relocation to a polis of comparable status. For example, members of the &quot;cives Romani&quot; maintained their full &quot;civitas&quot; when they migrated to a Roman colony with full rights under the law: a &quot;colonia civium Romanorum&quot;. &quot;Latins&quot; also had this right, and maintained their &quot;ius Latii&quot; if they relocated to a different Latin state or Latin colony (&quot;Latina colonia&quot;). This right did &quot;not&quot; preserve one&#x27;s level of citizenship should one relocate to a colony of &quot;lesser&quot; legal status; full Roman citizens relocating to a &quot;Latina colonia&quot; were reduced to the level of the &quot;ius Latii&quot;, and such a migration and reduction in status had to be a voluntary act.

==Romanization and citizenship==

Roman citizenship was also used as a tool of foreign policy and control. Colonies and political allies would be granted a &quot;minor&quot; form of Roman citizenship, there being several graduated levels of citizenship and legal rights (the Latin rights was one of them). The promise of improved status within the Roman &quot;sphere of influence&quot; and the rivalry with one&#x27;s neighbours for status, kept the focus of many of Rome&#x27;s neighbours and allies centered on the &quot;status quo&quot; of Roman culture, rather than trying to subvert or overthrow Rome&#x27;s influence.

The granting of citizenship to allies and the conquered was a vital step in the process of Romanization. This step was one of the most effective political tools and (at that point in history) original political ideas.

Previously, Alexander the Great had tried to &quot;mingle&quot; his Greeks with the Persians, Egyptians, Syrians, etc. in order to assimilate the people of the conquered Persian Empire, but after his death this policy was largely ignored by his successors.

The idea was not to assimilate, but to turn a defeated and potentially rebellious enemy (or their sons) into Roman citizens. Instead of having to wait for the unavoidable revolt of a conquered people (a tribe or a city-state) like Sparta and the conquered Helots, Rome tried to make those under its rule feel that they had a stake in the system. The ability of non-Roman born individuals to gain Roman citizenship also provided increased stability for those under Roman rule, and the system of sub-division within the different types of citizenship allowed for Roman rulers to work cooperatively with local elites in the provinces.

=== &quot;Romanitas&quot;, Roman nationalism, and its extinction ===
With the settlement of Romanization and the passing of generations, a new unifying feeling began to emerge within Roman territory, the &quot;Romanitas&quot; or &quot;Roman way of life&quot;, the once tribal feeling that had divided Europe began to disappear (although never completely) and blend in with the new wedge patriotism imported from Rome with which to be able to ascend at all levels.

The &quot;Romanitas&quot;, &quot;Romanity&quot; or &quot;Romanism&quot; would last until the last years of unity of the &quot;pars occidentalis&quot;, a moment in which the old tribalisms and the proto-feudalism of Celtic origins, until then dormant, would re-emerge, mixing with the new ethnic groups of Germanic origin. This being observed in the writings of Gregory of Tours, who does not use the dichotomy Gallo-Roman-Frankish, but uses the name of each of the gens of that time existing in Gaul (arverni, turoni, lemovici, turnacenses, bituriges, franci, etc.), considering himself a Arverni and not a Gallo-Roman; being the relations between the natives and the Franks seen not as Romans against barbarians, as is popularly believed, but as in the case of Gregory, a relationship of coexistence between Arverni and Franks (Franci) as equals.

It must also be remembered that Clovis I was born in Gaul, so according to the Edict of Caracalla that made him a Roman citizen by birth, in addition to being recognized by the emperor Anastasius I Dicorus as consul of Gaul, so his position of power was reinforced, in addition to being considered by his Gallo-Roman subjects as a legitimate viceroy of Rome; understanding that the &quot;Romanitas&quot; did not disappear in such an abrupt way, observed its effects centuries later with Charlemagne and the &quot;Translatio imperii&quot;.

<text>State Route 504 (SR 504, designated as the Spirit Lake Memorial Highway) is a state highway in southwestern Washington state in the United States. It travels along the North Fork Toutle River to the Mount St. Helens area, serving as the main access to the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. The highway begins at an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) and SR 411 in Castle Rock and terminates at the Johnston Ridge Observatory near Spirit Lake.

The Cowlitz County government built the Spirit Lake Highway in 1903 and paved it in the early 1930s before it was transferred to state control, becoming Secondary State Highway 1R (SSH 1R) in 1937. SSH 1R initially ended at the boundary of Columbia National Forest (now Gifford Pinchot National Forest), but was extended in 1961 to the timberline of the mountain. It was renumbered to SR 504 in 1964 and remained popular with loggers and tourists, requiring bridges and sections to be rebuilt.

A major section of SR 504 was destroyed in the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens and its subsequent lahar on the North Fork Toutle River. The state government rebuilt most of the highway from 1988 to 1997, relocating it further north and connecting to new interpretive centers at Coldwater Ridge and Johnston Ridge. A part of the old alignment near the Toutle River Sediment Dam is signed as a spur route. Continued volcanic activity at Mount St. Helens, particularly in the mid-2000s, has resulted in closures and evacuations along the highway at various times.

==Route description==
SR 504 begins as an extension of Huntington Avenue at an interchange with I-5 northeast of Castle Rock. The street continues southwest into downtown Castle Rock as SR 411 and I-5 Business. SR 504 travels northeasterly through a small commercial area before ascending into the hills above Salmon Creek, passing several farms and wineries along the way. The highway follows a minor stream heading southeast into the wetlands around Silver Lake, where the Mount St. Helens visitor center and Seaquest State Park lie. SR 504 continues along the north side of the lake and passes through the town of Toutle at the confluence of the Toutle River&#x27;s two forks.

The highway crosses over the river on the Coal Bank Bridge and continues along the north side of the North Fork Toutle River, following the narrow valley to the east of Beigle Mountain. Near the Riverdale Raceway, SR 504 intersects the east end of SR 505, which provides connections to I-5 and Toledo. The highway continues northeast into Kid Valley, home to camping sites and a few homes, and follows the south side of the narrower valley as the river meanders north and south around various mountains. At a third crossing of the river, SR 504 intersects a short spur route on Sediment Dam Road that leads to a viewpoint overlooking the Toutle River Sediment Dam. The highway continues along the northeast side of the earthen dam and its reservoir, climbing uphill and running through cuts in the cliffs.

Further southeast along the river, SR 504 passes the privately owned Eco Park resort, a youth camp, and a heliport near the Hoffstadt Bluffs Viewpoint. The highway then crosses over Hoffstadt Creek on a steel truss bridge that sits above the valley floor; it is the longest of 13 bridges on SR 504. The bridge also marks the western extent of the &quot;blast zone,&quot; where trees were felled during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, located away. The area has large forests of young fir, pine, and cottonwood trees planted by Weyerhaeuser in the 1980s as part of a regeneration and restoration project. The company also operates the Charles W. Bingham Forest Learning Center, a museum that overlooks the North Fork Toutle River and also includes a rest area.

SR 504 continues further into the mountains, crossing Bear Creek and traveling around Elk Rock to a viewpoint on its southeast side. From the Elk Rock area, the highway forms the northern boundary of the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument and encounters more mountainous terrain that results in several hairpin turns between other scenic viewpoints. After crossing several branches of Maratta Creek, SR 504 reaches a partial cloverleaf interchange with an access road that serves the Coldwater Science and Learning Center, a visitor center that overlooks the mountain and open from autumn to spring. The highway heads west before completing a hairpin turn to travel south around the end of Coldwater Lake. Beyond milepost 45, SR 504 is closed during the winter months due to hazardous conditions for drivers and potential avalanches. It typically reopens in time for the May 18 anniversary of the 1980 eruption.

The highway continues into the National Volcanic Monument and turns east before reaching the border between Cowlitz and Skamania counties. SR 504 follows South Coldwater Creek upstream through a narrow valley to its headwaters near Spirit Lake, passing several trailheads, and turns west to continue its ascent. The treeless landscape is home to winter herds of Rocky Mountain elk and deer. The highway turns east once again near the Loowit Viewpoint and reaches the Johnston Ridge Observatory, the volcano&#x27;s main visitor center open from spring to autumn and situated at an elevation of . SR 504 terminates downhill from the observatory at its parking lot, located north of the Mount St. Helens crater.

SR 504 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on state highways to measure traffic volume in terms of annual average daily traffic. Average traffic volumes on the highway in 2016 ranged from a minimum of 500 vehicles near Coldwater Lake to a maximum of 14,000 vehicles at the I-5 interchange in Castle Rock. SR 504 is the main route for a majority of the 3 million annual visitors to the Mount St. Helens area. It is designated by the state government as the Spirit Lake Memorial Highway, a state scenic byway, and a National Forest Scenic Byway by the United States Forest Service.

==History==

===Early history and state acquisition===

The Spirit Lake Highway was completed in 1903 by the Cowlitz County government, connecting Castle Rock to the shore of Spirit Lake by following the North Fork Toutle River. The highway was initially unpaved and characterized as rough and narrow, and several sections were improved or bypassed in the 1910s. It was added to the state highway system in 1937 as Secondary State Highway 1R (SSH 1R), terminating at the western boundary of the Columbia National Forest near Spirit Lake. The state government paved sections of the highway in the late 1930s and early 1940s, with only a short section at the east end remaining unpaved by 1944. The remaining section of the highway within Columbia National Forest was improved and paved by the federal Bureau of Public Roads in the late 1930s for $1.2 million (equivalent to $ in dollars).

Expanded logging and a planned ski resort on Mount St. Helens hastened the construction of a modern highway linking Spirit Lake to the timberline on the mountain&#x27;s northern slopes in the 1950s. Despite support from the state government, the Forest Service, and Bureau of Public Roads, the highway project was put on hold for several years due to funding shortfalls. The state legislature approved funds for the extension of SSH 1R into the national forest, which began in late 1959. The SSH 1R designation was extended onto the new timberline highway, which opened to traffic on September 29, 1962.

During the 1964 state highway renumbering, SSH 1R was designated SR 504 under the modern &quot;sign route&quot; (now state route) system. The state highway department completed construction of a new bridge over the Toutle River at Kid Valley in November 1965, replacing a narrower truss bridge. By the 1970s, several new campgrounds, trailheads, and recreation areas had been established along the highway by the Forest Service and logging companies like Weyerhauser to serve tourists visiting the Mount St. Helens area. A major flood in December 1977 left eight sections of the highway washed out and only passable by one lane of traffic until repairs were completed the following year.

===1980 eruption and rebuilding===
In March 1980, Mount St. Helens was struck by an earthquake swarm that indicated potential eruptive activity for the volcano, which had been dormant for over a century. The Forest Service established a roadblock on SR 504 approximately west of Spirit Lake on March 28 because of potential avalanche risks. In the following days, the roadblock was moved to west of the lake and later west as the risk of an imminent eruption grew. Many local residents and sightseers violated the roadblock, which was planned to be moved further west by an order from Governor Dixy Lee Ray to take effect on May 19. An exception was made on May 17, allowing for the retrieval of belongings from various buildings during a four-hour period that was monitored by local authorities in case of a mass evacuation.

On May 18, 1980, the north face of Mount St. Helens slid away and triggered a massive eruption that created a lahar that devastated the North Fork Toutle River. The lahar destroyed about of SR 504, including seven of the highway&#x27;s eight major bridges, leaving only the Kid Valley bridge standing because of its sufficient clearance. The remaining section between Toutle and Kid Valley was buried in up to of sediment, but was able to re-open by September with temporary Bailey bridges and other structures. Several vehicles on the highway were swept away by the lahar, including those carrying some of the eruption&#x27;s 57 victims.

The highway was closed beyond the town of Toutle, controlled by a roadblock and an existing turnaround loop installed by Weyerhaeuser. Access to Kid Valley was restored by early September using a temporary Bailey bridge over the Toutle River. The highway was extended to the debris and sediment dam and Weyerhaeuser&#x27;s Camp Baker site in 1987 at a cost of $11 million (equivalent to $ in dollars). In 1982, the federal government designated the area around the volcano as the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument and the state government designated SR 504 as the Spirit Lake Memorial Highway to honor the victims of the eruption. A visitor center was also opened at Silver Lake in 1987 to serve the growing number of tourists to the area, but the highway would remain closed beyond the sediment dam.

Preliminary plans for a replacement for the highway to serve the north side of Mount St. Helens were approved by the state government in 1986. The highway would include of new road built at a higher elevation between Kid Valley and the newly formed Coldwater Lake, crossing over various creeks with ten major bridges. The project&#x27;s $118 million cost (equivalent to $ in dollars) was paid from emergency funds from the Federal Highway Administration. Construction of the new highway and its scenic viewpoints began in 1988 and the first section to the Coldwater Ridge visitor center was completed on October 16, 1992. The expected influx of tourists and their potential impact on the recovering habitat around the volcano alarmed scientists looking to preserve areas for sensitive research. After finding that elk herds were leaving areas with improved highway access, the Forest Service established restricted zones within the national monument that prohibited off-trail hiking, pets, fires, and camping.

Two additional visitor centers, Weyerhaeuser&#x27;s Forest Learning Center and the former Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center, opened in 1995 at milepost 33 and 1996 at milepost 27, respectively. In May 1997, SR 504 was extended to its current terminus at the newly opened Johnston Ridge Observatory, named for volcanologist David A. Johnston. Construction of the extension included underground blasting to compact soil and provide one of the highway&#x27;s bridges with a stable foundation. It replaced an original plan to build a forest road that would be used by shuttle buses between Coldwater Ridge and the Johnston Ridge facility.

===21st century===

A long-proposed extension of SR 504 to the eastern side of the Mount St. Helens area gained traction in the early 2000s, sparking outcry from scientists and environmentalists. The route, connecting Coldwater Lake to the existing Forest Highway 99 near Windy Ridge and beyond to Forest Highway 25, was supported by officials from Cowlitz and Lewis counties as a tourist draw and a potential evacuation route. WSDOT studied several options for the proposed highway, which enjoyed mixed public support, and estimated a cost of $18.5 million to construct one option and $44 million for another (equivalent to $ and $, respectively, in dollars). The proposed highway was rejected by state legislators due to its cost, despite attempts at salvaging the cheaper proposal by converting it into a toll road.

From 2004 until 2006, increased volcanic activity at Mount St. Helens caused a surge in tourist traffic on SR 504, along with periodic shutdowns of the Johnston Ridge section. An evacuation of the area was ordered in early October 2004 due to seismic activity, indicating a possible buildup of magma, forcing 2,500 visitors to leave the Coldwater and Johnston centers for several days. The evacuation was later cancelled and other restrictions were relaxed after steam eruptions diffused pressure inside the volcano. A minor mudslide in March 2007 blocked a section of SR 504 near Kid Valley and was removed after a week-long cleanup by WSDOT crews.

A mudslide and debris flow, known as the 2023 South Coldwater Slide, occurred on May 14, 2023, destroying the Spirit Lake Outlet Bridge and severing SR 504 northeast of Johnston Ridge Observatory at milepost 49. Twelve people were airlifted from the area beyond the mudslide; the observatory&#x27;s seasonal reopening was postponed and the highway east of Coldwater Lake was closed to all traffic. WSDOT contractors cleared debris over the highway by July and created a temporary gravel road to access Johnston Ridge for vehicle retrieval and to prepare for reopening in 2024, but the interim roadway was washed out in November due to a collapsed culvert caused by heavy rainfall and erosion unrelated to the earlier landslide. WSDOT announced in early 2024 that because of the costs and difficulties in making repairs to the bypass, based on a limited construction window due to weather and elevation as well as the steepness of the terrain, the highway and access to the observatory was to remain closed until 2026. The closure timeline was revised by WSDOT to April 2027, with construction to rebuild the route not slated until April 2026.

==Major intersections==


==Spur route==
SR 504 has a short spur route east of Kid Valley that runs along Sediment Dam Road. It follows a section of the former highway and terminates near the Toutle River Sediment Dam at a viewpoint and WSDOT maintenance facility An average of 50 vehicles use the road on a daily basis, according to annual daily traffic data measured by WSDOT in 2016.

<doc id="1037021" wikidata="Q261009" url="?curid=1037021" title="Ashes of the Wake">
<text>Ashes of the Wake is the fourth studio album and first major-label release by American heavy metal band Lamb of God, released in 2004 via Epic Records. The album debuted at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 35,000 copies in its first week and was rated by &quot;Guitar World&quot; as the 49th greatest Guitar Album of all Time. This album also was rated by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; as the 5th greatest Metal Album of The 21st Century. The album was inspired by the events that took place during the war in Iraq with songs such as &quot;Ashes of the Wake&quot; (which includes snippets of former Marine Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey in an interview after his return from the Iraq War), &quot;Now You&#x27;ve Got Something to Die For&quot;, &quot;One Gun&quot; and &quot;The Faded Line&quot;. The quote at the beginning of &quot;Omerta&quot; is a paraphrase of the Sicilian Mafia&#x27;s code of silence. As of August 2010, &quot;Ashes of the Wake&quot; has sold 398,000 copies in the United States. Ten years after its release, as of 2014, sales have topped 400,000 copies sold and is Lamb of God’s best-selling record. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in February 2016.

==Releases==
The first pressing came with a bonus disc titled &quot;Pure American Metal&quot;, including songs taken from the band&#x27;s previous albums (&quot;Burn the Priest&quot;, &quot;New American Gospel&quot; and &quot;As the Palaces Burn&quot;), a live recording of the song &quot;Black Label&quot; from DVD &quot;Terror and Hubris&quot;, as well as a pre-production demo of the song &quot;Laid to Rest&quot;.

The Japanese edition included a bonus song &quot;Another Nail for Your Coffin&quot; which was released worldwide in 2010 in a three-CD box set called &quot;&quot;. The song was later included on the 15th anniversary edition of the album.

A DualDisc version was released in the United States. The DVD side contained the album in LPCM 2.0, and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, as well as various video clips, including the promo videos for &quot;Now You&#x27;ve Got Something to Die For&quot; (intended to promote the &quot;Killadelphia&quot; release) and &quot;Laid to Rest&quot;, a short on the New England Metalfest, a &quot;Meet the Band&quot; and a clip from the &quot;Terror and Hubris&quot; DVD. A production error in the 5.1 mix of &quot;Break You&quot; causes the vocals to be displaced throughout the track, and pitch shift high and low throughout the song. This error is also in the Dolby Atmos mix on Apple Music. 

==Reception==
The album was generally well received; Blabbermouth.net gave it a 7 rating. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic gave it a 4 out of 5 star rating. He praised Blythe&#x27;s vocals, saying they became, &quot;Lamb of God&#x27;s threshold of pain conduit.&quot;

He is one of only five men to have won both Olympic and World golds in the event, along with Reuben Kosgei, Brimin Kipruto, Conseslus Kipruto and Soufiane El Bakkali. He and El Bakkali are the only multiple gold medalists in both. He is the only athlete to have won four world championships in the steeplechase (which he won consecutively). He is one of only three athletes to have won two Olympic titles in the event; the other two being Volmari Iso-Hollo and Soufiane El Bakkali.

==Biography==
Born in Matira, which is near Kapsowar, Marakwet District, Kemboi graduated from Kapsowar Boys Secondary School in 1999. He did not take up athletics until after he left school, but was spotted by Paul Ereng and won the African Junior Championships in 2001 despite falling.

Kemboi became African Junior Champion in 2001 and then in 2002, he finished second at the Commonwealth Games behind compatriot Stephen Cherono. The same year Kemboi was originally fourth at the African Championships in Athletics, but was later awarded bronze after the winner Moroccan Brahim Boulami received a doping suspension.

At the 2003 World Championships, Kemboi had a gruelling battle with former teammate Saif Saeed Shaheen (formerly Stephen Cherono) who represented his new country Qatar, before Shaheen pulled away from the exhausted Kemboi to win by less than a second. Kemboi won the gold medal at the 2003 All-Africa Games.

In the absence of Shaheen – the Kenyan Olympic Committee refused to waive the three-year eligibility delay for established athletes who switch nationalities – Kemboi rose to a main favourite status at the Athens Olympics. The race went very much according to form, with the three Kenyans Kemboi, Brimin Kipruto and Paul Kipsiele Koech pushing the pace from the second lap and soon leaving the rest of the field behind and Kemboi winning a gold medal 0.3 seconds ahead of Kipruto in a Kenyan sweep.

In August 2005 he won a silver medal at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics again behind Shaheen, and in March 2006 he won the 2006 Commonwealth Games. He finished second at the 2006 African Championships in Athletics, but was disqualified for improper hurdling. At the 2007 World Championships in Athletics he won his third successive silver medal, this time losing to Kipruto.

Kemboi represented Kenya at the 2008 Beijing Olympics but managed only seventh – his worst performance on the global stage. He rebounded with a win at the 2009 World Championships (his first world championship gold medal) after three successive silvers and took silver at the 2010 African Championships the following year behind 2008 bronze medalist Richard Mateelong.

He took to the road races of Italy in August 2010, beating Peter Kimeli to the tape to win the Corribianco race in Bianco, then taking the honours at the 8.5-kilometre Amatrice-Configno.

He won the gold medal at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics in Daegu, South Korea.

Kemboi won the gold medal for Kenya in the 3000m Steeplechase in London 2012. Kemboi won in a time of eight minutes 18.56 seconds.

In 2013, Kemboi added his third straight gold medal at the World Championships. In 2015, he took his fourth successive title at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics. This was his seventh World medal, setting a record for any athlete, which would subsequently be surpassed by Chinese shot putter Gong Lijao in 2023.

On 17 August 2016, he won a bronze medal for Kenya in the 3000m Steeplechase in the Rio Olympics 2016. He then announced his retirement after the win. Kemboi was later that day disqualified for stepping outside of the track. An investigation into the incident was instigated when the French Olympic team complained that the runner had stepped out of the track after his final water jump during the race. The bronze medal was subsequently awarded to French runner Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad. He announced his retirement immediately following the Olympic race, but rescinded that decision after learning of his disqualification. He made one final attempt, making the finals at the 2017 World Championships, where he finished a disappointing 11th place.

==Personal life==
Kemboi is managed by Enrico Dionisi. Since 2002 he has owned a farm near Moi&#x27;s Bridge, Trans-Nzoia District. He is married to Jane Kemboi with two sons. Since 2009 he has been coached by Moses Kiptanui, who is also his neighbour.

His participation in the 2012 Olympics was initially put in doubt when he was charged with assault in June 2012, after a woman claimed he stabbed her after she refused his sexual advances.

<doc id="1037026" wikidata="Q1004283" url="?curid=1037026" title="Khanaqin">
<text>Khanaqin (; ) is the central city of Khanaqin District in Diyala Governorate, Iraq, near the Iranian border (8 km) on the Alwand tributary of the Diyala River. The town is populated by Kurds who speak the Southern Kurdish dialect. Khanaqin is situated on the main road which Shia pilgrims use when visiting holy Islamic cities. The city is rich in oil, and the first Iraqi oil refinery and oil pipeline was built nearby in 1927. The main tribes of Khanaqin include Kalhor, Feyli, Zand, Malekshahi Suramiri, Arkavazi and Zangana.

The city experienced Arabization during the Saddam era, but this has been substantially reversed after the fall of the regime in 2003 and remains disputed.

== History ==
In the early 11th century, the city was under the Banu Uqayl and later the Annazids until Ibrahim Inal captured the city around 1045.

Khanaqin was part of Baban until the 1850s.

The population of Khanaqin in the mid-19th century was small with only fifty Muslim and five Jewish households, with a significant Kurdish tribal population around the town. It had three mosques and three caravanserais. Khanaqin was a mere caravan station for caravans carrying Shia pilgrims before the Treaty of Erzurum in 1847 which made it a more significant frontier town between the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Iran. An immigration office was established just after the signing of the treaty to manage the growing pilgrimage. A customs house would later be established as well.

During the Persian Campaign, the Ottomans were attacked in Khanaqin on 3 June 1916 by Russian forces led by Nikolai Baratov but managed to push back the Russian cavalry. While the Ottomans lost about 300 men, the Russian casualties were greater. However, the Russians succeeded in capturing the town in April 1917 due to Ottoman weakness and the collapse of the Iranian government. Russia received support from the Kurdish tribes and allowed them to govern the area. Nonetheless, the Russian forces had to withdraw from the area in June 1917 due to the Russian Revolution which allowed the Ottomans to retake the town. The United Kingdom captured the city in December 1917 during their Mesopotamian campaign. After the capture, Britain approached the regional Kurdish tribes including Bajalan leader Mustafa Pasha Bajalan to consolidate their control. Khanaqin District was established in 1921.

Khanaqin saw no fighting during World War II but became an important base for Commonwealth forces and a field hospital was constructed in the town. Many Polish prisoners of war, who escaped Russia and attempted to link up with Commonwealth forces in Khanaqin, arrived at the town in September 1942. They would remain in the town but many perished and a cemetery was built in the town for them. Maintenance of the Khanaqin War Cemetery was later abandoned and a memorial was built in Baghdad. In 2020, the cemetery was damaged by &#x27;extremists&#x27;.

The town experienced shelling by Iran during Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s and its people were displaced. Peshmerga captured the town in March 1991 during the uprisings in Iraq and again in April 2003 during the U.S. invasion of Iraq. In the December 2005 parliamentary election, the Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan won the city with 99.4%. In the same year, locals protested and wanted Khanaqin to be a part of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region under PUK rule.

In September 2008, Peshmerga withdrew from the city allowing Iraqi police to control the city. The town experienced protests against the shuffle. As part of a compromise, Kurdistan Region was allowed to administer the city with Asayish presence, but Peshmerga would ultimately enter the city again in September 2011. Peshmerga withdrew from the city again in October 2017 which made the city witness frequent security breaches.

==Climate==
Khanaqin has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;) with extremely hot, dry summers and mild to cool, slightly wet, winters.
== Demographics ==
===Ethnicity===
In 1947, out of the 25,700 people in the town, 20,560 (80%) were Kurds. In the 1957 census, Kurds constituted 74.6% of the population, while Arabs were 23.7% and the Turkmen population stood at 1.6%. In 1965, the numbers stood at 72.1%, 26.2% and 1.7% for Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen, respectively.

During the 1970s, the Arabization efforts by Iraq intensified, and the 1977 census showed that the Arab population had become 47.5% of the population, while Kurds were 45% and Turkmens, 6.1%. In 1987, the Arab population stood at 49.5%, the Kurdish population at 45.8% and the Turkmen population at 4.7%. In 1997, Arabs were 54.7% of the population, while Kurds were 39.4% and Turkmen were 5.8%.

The Arabization of Khanaqin was almost entirely reversed after 2003 by the PUK. Khanaqin mayor Muhammad Amin Hassan Hussein stated in 2014 that the Arab population fell to 1% in 2003.

===Religion===
The majority of Khanaqin are Shia Muslims but a significant Sunni Muslim minority also exists. In 2020, one Christian remained in the city, as well as some Yarsans.

==Alwand Bridge==
Alwand Bridge is located in the center of Khanaqin and on the Alwand River. The Sassanids founded this bridge, which during the Sassanid era was 150 meters wide and 6 meters tall.

The current version of the bridge was built in 1860 by Dowlatshah, the former governor of Kermanshah. He went to Khanaqin in 1855 on his way to visit the Shia holy sites in Karbala and Najaf, but that year he faced a severe flood and decided to spend his travel expenses in addition to the additional costs of building a bridge in Khanaqin. He brought a number of architects from Isfahan to Khanaqin and the bridge was built using walnut wood imported from Iran.

== Jewish community ==
Khanaqin had a Jewish community until the early 1950s when they were forced to migrate to Israel. In the middle of the 19th century, about 20 Jewish families lived in the town. This number increased to 700 individuals shortly after. The languages spoken by the community was Mlahso Aramaic. By the 1920s, the community was introduced to Zionism and most would leave for Israel after the community leader was arrested in August 1949.

<text>Harwich Redoubt is a circular fort built in 1808 to defend the port of Harwich, Essex from Napoleonic invasion. The Harwich Society opens it to the public.

== Construction ==
The Redoubt was built between 1808 and 1810 to protect the port of Harwich against the threat of Napoleonic invasion. It was part of the scheme proposed in 1805 that included the construction of 55 Martello Towers on the East Anglian coast, although 29 were actually built. Although similar in design to the earlier Dymchurch Redoubt and Eastbourne Redoubt, Harwich Redoubt differed in being designed to mount ten, rather than eleven guns.

The redoubt was built on a hilltop just outside the town, giving an unrestricted field of fire across the estuaries of the River Stour and the River Orwell which form the entrance to the harbour, and allowed interlocking fire with the guns of Landguard Fort on the opposite shore. The construction was supervised by Major Alexander Bryce of the Royal Engineers at an estimated cost of £32,000.

==Description==
Harwich Redoubt is built mainly from brick with stone details, and is circular in shape, about in diameter, with a central parade ground across. The ground floor consists of 18 casemates or vaulted chambers radiating from the parade ground. These casemates were used as barrack accommodation, stores, ablutions and latrines, and a cookhouse. Two of them form the magazine and shell store; hoists lifted ammunition from the lower level to the gun emplacements, which are on a terreplein or gun platform formed by the roof of the casemates, which has ten embrasures for cannon. The ditch is some wide and deep, with a brick counterscarp wall set a little lower than the level of the parapet of the gun platform so as to protect the scarp wall from enemy fire.

== Military service ==

Originally armed with ten 24-pounder cannon, the Redoubt was remodelled in order to accommodate increasingly heavy guns, as technology and the perceived threat changed. In 1861–2, work was carried out to accommodate 68-pounder cannon, and the emplacements were strengthened (by adding granite facing) to withstand improved enemy artillery. Only a decade later in 1872, three of the emplacements were altered to take enormous 12 ton RML (rifled muzzle loading) guns. In 1903, three emplacements received 12-pounder QF (quick firing) guns.

Despite this ongoing modernisation, the Redoubt never fired a shot in anger. It is also probable that its strategic importance declined towards the end of the 19th century with the construction of the more powerful Beacon Hill Battery just to the south. In the 1920s the area around the Redoubt - previously kept clear to provide fields of fire - was bought by the Town Council. This land is used for allotments. The Redoubt itself was allowed to fall into disrepair.

The Redoubt was briefly taken back into military service during World War II, when it was used as an anti-aircraft site and it also served as a detention centre for British troops awaiting trial. Examples of the graffiti left by the soldiers can still be seen in some of the rooms.

Following World War II the Redoubt was used by the British Civil Defence organisation, who used it until they were disbanded. That was the end of the Redoubt&#x27;s military service.

== Restoration ==
Following a listing as an Ancient Monument, the restoration of the Harwich Redoubt began in July 1969 and has continued until the present day. When restoration began, one of the 9-inch 12 ton RML guns was discovered buried in the (dry) moat - it had been pushed in when it became obsolete, as they were too large and solidly constructed to be broken up for scrap.

Currently open as a museum, the Redoubt is the largest ancient monument in the UK being restored by a voluntary group. In addition to some of the original guns that armed the Redoubt, including the 9-inch RML, there are a number of other guns on display. Around the parade ground on the lower level, the various rooms are either fitted out in reconstruction of how they might have looked, or are used as display rooms for other exhibitions. Exhibitions include a large number of replica firearms. Battle re-enactments and other events are held during the summer months.

<doc id="1037030" wikidata="Q5162428" url="?curid=1037030" title="Sheila on 7">
<text>Sheila on 7 is an alternative rock band from Yogyakarta, Indonesia. They have changed their lineup several times since their formation on 6 May 1996. Their first lineup consisted of Akhdiyat Duta Modjo (also known as Duta, vocals), Saktia &quot;Sakti&quot; Ari Seno (guitar), Eross Candra (guitar), Adam Muhammad Subarkah (bass), and Anton Widiastanto (drums). Anton left the group in 2004, while Sakti left in 2006, leaving their current lineup as it is, but with Brian Kresna Putro replacing Anton in the drums until his departure in 2022.

Their self titled debut album &quot;Sheila on 7&quot; was ranked #33 by &quot;Rolling Stone Indonesia&quot; on &quot;The 150 Greatest Indonesian Albums of All Time&quot;. The magazine also listed the songs &quot;Dan&quot; (#29) and &quot;Melompat Lebih Tinggi&quot; (#147) on &quot;The 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time&quot;.

Sheila on 7 is the first ever band in Indonesia with their first 3 albums sold more than 1 million copies in Indonesia only, with &quot;Kisah Klasik Untuk Masa Depan&quot; ranked #8 and Sheila on 7 ranked #13 on the list of Indonesian all time best selling albums. &quot;Kisah Klasik Untuk Masa Depan&quot; charted at #1 on Hits Albums of the World on &quot;Billboard&quot; Malaysia. By now, Sheila on 7 has sold estimated more than 8 million copies album in Indonesia.

== History ==

The band came from an earlier incarnation called &quot; W.H.Y Gank &quot; which was headed by Adam and Sakti. Both members had invited Duta - who had been performing with Adam at as a singer and acoustic guitar duo at their neighbourhood 17 August celebrations - to join their band practice to be a vocalist. A year after &quot;W.H.Y Gank&quot; was formed, the band met Eross (who then became their lead guitarist and leader the band). The four of them decided to form a new band, and while at their first studio jamming session Eross introduced the band to Anton. The band was given the name &quot;Sheilagank&quot; - &quot;Sheila&quot; being the name of a female friend both Adam and Eross knew of - with the official formation date being 6 May 1996. Sheilagank performed in numerous band festivals organised by high schools for about 2 years until the middle of 1998, when they got their first recording contract with the Sony Music Entertainment Indonesia label. The members changed their band name to &quot;Sheila On 7&quot;: the &quot;on 7&quot; referring to the seven-note solfège, while &quot;Sheilagank&quot; became the name of their fanbase.

Sheila On 7 since its beginning in the Indonesian music scene has made a lot of achievements, including being the only Indonesian band that is able to sell physical albums for more than one million copies, three albums in a row. Through the success of the debut album Sheila On 7 (1999), followed by two other albums that exploded in the market, Kisah Klasik Untuk Masa Depan (2000) and 07 Des (2002). In 2003, they released their first film soundtrack Ost. 30 Hari Mencari Cinta which succeeded sold over 600.000 copies and followed by their fourth studio album Pejantan Tangguh in 2004, although not as successful as the first three albums where sales reached millions, this album was able to sell more than 450,000 copies. Because of that success, they also have loyal listeners in neighboring countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei.

On 18 October 2004, Anton was dismissed from the band management due to disciplinary issues while Brian filled Anton&#x27;s position. Brian performed with Sheila On 7 in different promo tours for the album &quot;Pejantan Tangguh&quot;. &quot;The Very Best of Sheila On 7: Jalan Terus&quot; (2005) album became the first studio recording release after the drummer replacement.

In 2006, Sakti left the band amidst recording &quot;507&quot; as he was to continue his studies in Pakistan and this did not gel with their schedule. It was during this time that Brian was promoted as their permanent drummer until 2022.

On 26 January 2018, Sheila on 7 released their first single entitled &quot;Film Favorit&quot; under their own label named 507 Records. It also be their first time to involves music directors for working on their song. &quot;Film Favorit&quot; itself is a song created by guitarist Eross, which inspired the story of a close friend who has not managed to find a life partner.

On November 25, 2024, they released their latest single titled &quot;Memori Baik,&quot; featuring Aishameglio, the daughter of Duta.

== Musical style ==
Their musical style is deemed difficult to determine though it is still in the pop rock genre, but it is clear that they are believed to play a &quot;Sheila music&quot;, where ideas or creations for their songs emerge spontaneously, hence the simple lyrics and musical concepts. Sheila on 7 tend to compose upbeat and optimistic songs that reflect the bliss of being teenagers and young adults.

<text>Pokhara ( ) is a metropolitan city located in central Nepal, which serves as the capital of Gandaki Province and is declared as the tourism capital of Nepal. It is the second most populous city of the nation after Kathmandu, with 599,504 inhabitants living in 120,594 households as of 2021. It is the country&#x27;s largest metropolitan city in terms of area. The city also serves as the headquarters of Kaski District. Pokhara is located west of the capital, Kathmandu. The city is on the shore of Phewa Lake, and sits at an average elevation of approximately 822 m above sea level. The Annapurna Range, with three out of the ten highest peaks in the world—Dhaulagiri, Annapurna I and Manaslu—is within aerial range from the valley.

In 2024, Pokhara was declared as the tourism capital of Nepal, being a base for trekkers undertaking the Annapurna Circuit through the Annapurna Conservation Area region of the Annapurna ranges in the Himalayas. The city is also home to many of the elite Gurkha soldiers, soldiers native to South Asia of Nepalese nationality recruited for the British Army, Nepalese Army, Indian Army, Gurkha Contingent Singapore, Gurkha Reserve Unit Brunei, UN peacekeeping forces and in war zones around the world.

== Etymology ==
The Nepali word &quot;Pokhari&quot; (, ) means &quot;pond&quot;. &quot;pokhara&quot; is a variant of &quot;Pokhari&quot; as the city has numerous ponds.

== History ==
By radiocarbon dating and investigating the alluvial deposits of Pokhara Valley, researchers have found that there were at least three large medieval earthquakes in 1000, 1255, and 1344 AD. Up to 9 cubic kilometres of conglomerates, massive mud and silt show indications of one or several megafloods that emanated from the Sabche Cirque in the Annapurna range.

Pokhara lies on an important old trading route between China and India. In the 17th century, it was part of the Kingdom of Kaski which was one of the Chaubisi rajya (24 Kingdoms of Nepal, चौबिसे राज्य) ruled by a branch of the Shah dynasty. Many of the hills around Pokhara have medieval ruins from that time. In 1786, Prithvi Narayan Shah, the last ruler of the Gorkha Kingdom and first monarch of the Kingdom of Nepal, added Pokhara to his kingdom. It had by then become an important trading place on the routes from Kathmandu to Jumla and from India to Tibet.

The first settlement of the valley is theorized to have taken place when the first King of Kaski, Kulamandan Shah Khad (also called Bichitra Khan and Jagati Khan), made Batulechaur in the northern side of the valley his winter capital during the mid 14th century. The people settled here included Parajuli Brahmins, who were asked to look after the Bindhyabasini temple and were given some land in that locality as Birta. Dhobi Gauda was the first market center developed in Pokhara valley before the last King of Kaski brought sixteen families of Newars from Kathmandu (Bhaktapur) to develop the present-day market (i.e., old market) in the 1770s. Prior to that people were settled in the peripheral hills.

Pokhara was envisioned as a commercial center by the King of Kaski in the mid 18th century A.D. when Newars of Bhaktapur migrated to Pokhara, upon being invited by the king, and settled near main business locations such as Bindhyabasini temple, Nalakomukh and Bhairab Tole. Most of Pokhara, at the time, was largely inhabited by Khas (Brahmin, Chhetri and Dalits), Gurungs, Magars and Thakuri. 

At present, the Khas, Gurung (Tamu) and Magar form the dominant community of Pokhara. There is also a sizeable Newari population in the city. Batulechaur in the far north of Pokhara is home to the &quot;Gandharvas&quot; &quot;or Gaaineys&quot; (the tribe of the musicians).

The nearby hills around Pokhara are covered by Gurung villages with few places belonging to the Khas community. Magar communities are also present mostly in the southern outlying hills. A Newar community is almost non-existent in the villages of outlying hills outside the Pokhara city limits.

From 1959 to 1962, approximately 300,000 exiles entered Nepal from neighboring Tibet following its annexation by China. Most of the Tibetan exiles then sought asylum in Dharamshala and other Tibetan exile communities in India. According to UNHCR, since 1989, approximately 2500 Tibetans cross the border into Nepal each year, many of whom arrive in Pokhara typically as a transit to Tibetan exile communities in India. About 50,000–60,000 Tibetan exiles reside in Nepal, and approximately 20,000 of the exiled Tibetans live in one of the 12 consolidated camps, eight in Kathmandu and four in and around Pokhara. The four Tibetan settlements in Pokhara are Jampaling, Paljorling, Tashi Ling, and Tashi Palkhel. These camps have evolved into well-built settlements, each with a gompa (Buddhist monastery), chorten and its particular architecture, and Tibetans have become a visible minority in the city.

Until the end of the 1960s, the town was only accessible by foot and it was considered even more a mystical place than Kathmandu. The first road was completed in 1968 (Siddhartha Highway) after which tourism set in and the city grew rapidly. The area along the Phewa lake, called Lakeside, has developed into one of the major tourism hubs of Nepal.

== Geography ==

Due to the high population density and the frequency of natural disasters, western Nepal is considered one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world. Pokhara is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquakes and floods because the Seti Gandaki River flows through the city. For example, the strongest earthquakes in the region include those of 2015 in Nepal.

Pokhara is in the northwestern corner of the Pokhara Valley, which is a widening of the Seti Gandaki valley that lies in the region (&quot;Pahad&quot;) of the Himalayas. In this region, the mountains rise very quickly, and within , the elevation rises from . As a result of this sharp rise in altitude the area of Pokhara has one of the highest precipitation rates in the country (3,350 mm/year or 131 inches/year in the valley to 5600 mm/year or 222 inches/year in Lumle). Even within the city, there is a noticeable difference in rainfall between the south and the north: The northern part at the foothills of the mountains experiences a proportionally higher amount of precipitation.
The Seti Gandaki is the main river flowing through the city. The Seti Gandaki (White Gandaki) and its tributaries have created several gorges and canyons in and around Pokhara that give intriguingly long sections of terrace features to the city and surrounding areas. These long sections of terraces are interrupted by gorges that are hundreds of metres deep. The Seti gorge runs through Pokhara from north to south and then west to east; at places, these gorges are only a few metres wide. In the north and south, the canyons are wider.

In the south, the city borders Phewa Tal (or Phewa Lake) (4.4 km2) at an elevation of about above sea level, while north of Pokhara, the village of Lumle at touches the base of the Annapurna mountain range. Pokhara, the city of lakes, is the second-largest city of Nepal after Kathmandu. Three peaks (Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, Manaslu) can be seen from the city. The Machhapuchchhre (&quot;Fishtail&quot;) with an elevation of is the closest to the city.

The porous underground of the Pokhara valley favors the formation of caves and several caves can be found within city limits and neighboring cities as well. In the south of the city, a tributary of the Seti Gandaki River flowing out of the Phewa Lake disappears at &quot;Patale Chhango&quot; (पाताले छाँगो, Nepali for Hell&#x27;s Falls, also called Davis Falls, after someone who supposedly fell in) into an underground gorge, to reappear further south.

=== Climate ===
The city has a humid subtropical climate; however, the elevation keeps temperatures moderate. Temperatures in summer average between 25 and 35 °C; in winter around −2 to 15 °C. Pokhara and nearby areas receive a high amount of precipitation. Lumle, from Pokhara city center, receives the highest amount of rainfall (&gt; 5600 mm/year or 222 inches/year) in the country. Snowfall is not observed in the valley, but surrounding hills experience occasional snowfall in the winter. Summers are humid and mild; most precipitation occurs during the monsoon season (June–September). Winter and spring skies are generally clear and sunny.
The highest temperature ever recorded in Pokhara was on 4 May 2013, while the lowest temperature ever recorded was on 13 January 2012.

An effect of urbanization is seen in high real estate prices, among the highest in the country. The major contributors to the economy of Pokhara are manufacturing and service sector including tourism; agriculture and the foreign and domestic remittances. Tourism, service sector and manufacturing contributes approximately 58% to the economy, remittances about 20% and agriculture nearly 16%.

== Hydroelectric power plants ==
Pokhara has a number of hydroelectric power plants.

* Fewa Hydropower Station
* Seti Hydropower Station
* Bijayapur-I Small Hydropower Project
* Bijaypur Khola-2 Hydropower Project (under Construction)

==Temples, Biharas and churches==
There are numerous temples, gumbas (Buddhist monasteries) and churches in and around Pokhara valley. Many temples serve as combined places of worship for Hindus and Buddhists. Some of the popular temples, gumbas and churches are:

* Tal Barahi Temple (located on the island in the middle of Phewa Lake)
* Bindhyabasini temple
* World peace pagoda

* Bhadrakali Temple
*Matepani Gumba
* Akala Devi Temple
* Nepal Christiya Ramghat Church, established in 1952 A.D. (2009 BS), the first-ever church in Nepal

==Location==

The municipality of Pokhara spans from north to south and from east to west but, unlike the capital Kathmandu, it is quite loosely built up and still has much green space. Nepal The gorge through which the river flows is crossed at five places: K.I. Singh Pool, Mahendrapul and Prithvi Highway Pool from north to south of the city. The floor of the valley is plain, resembles Terai due to its gravel-like surface, and has slanted orientation from northwest to southeast. The city is surrounded by the hills overlooking the entire valley.

Phewa Lake was slightly enlarged by damming which poses a risk of silting up due to the inflow during the monsoon. The outflowing water is partially used for hydropower generation at Fewa Hydropower Station. The dam collapsed in 1974 which resulted in draining of its water and exposing the land leading to illegal land encroachment; since then the dam has been rebuilt. The power plant is about below at the bottom of the Phusre Khola gorge. Water from Phewa is diverted for irrigation into the southern Pokhara valley. The eastern Pokhara Valley receives irrigation water through a canal running from a reservoir by the Seti in the north of the city. Some parts of Phewa lake are used as commercial cage fisheries. The lake is currently being encroached upon by invasive water hyacinth (जलकुम्भी झार).

In 2017, Pokhara Lekhnath Metropolitan City became Nepal&#x27;s largest metropolitan city by area, occupying —which means the city is nine times larger than Kathmandu, 18 times larger than Lalitpur and 2.5 times larger than Bharatpur.

Pokhara is known to be a popular tourist destination for visitors from all over the world. Every year, many people visit the location in order to travel to the Annapurna range and famous religious place muktinath. The tourist district is along the north shore of the Phewa lake (Baidam, Lakeside, and Damside). It is mainly made up of small shops, non-star tourist hotels, restaurants, and bars. Most upscale and starred hotels are on the southern shore of the Phewa Lake and southeastern fringes of the city where there are more open lands and unhindered view of the surrounding mountains. Most of the tourists visiting Pokhara trek to the Annapurna Base Camp and Mustang. To the east of the Pokhara valley, there are seven smaller lakes such as Begnas Lake, Rupa Lake, Khaste lake, Maidi lake, Neureni lake, Dipang lake. Begnas Lake is known for its fishery projects.

== Tourism ==

After the occupation of Tibet by China in 1950 and the Indo-China war in 1962, the old trading route to India from Tibet through Pokhara became defunct. Today only a few caravans from Mustang arrive in Bagar.

In recent decades, Pokhara has become a major tourist destination: it is considered the tourism capital of Nepal, mainly for adventure tourism and the base for the famous Annapurna Circuit trek. Thus, a major contribution to the local economy is made by the tourism and hospitalities industry. Tourism is the primary source of income for local people and the city. There are two 5-star hotels and approximately 305 other hotels that includes one 4-star, five 3-star, fifteen 2-star and non-star hotels in the city.

The city promotes two major hilltops as viewpoints to see the city and surrounding panorama: World Peace Pagoda, built-in 1996 A.D. across the southern shore of Phewa Lake and Sarangkot, which is northwest of the city. In February 2004, International Mountain Museum (IMM) was opened for public in Ratopahiro to boost the city&#x27;s tourism. Other museums are Pokhara Regional Museum; an ethnographic museum; Annapurna Natural History Museum which houses preserved specimens of flora and fauna, and contains a particularly extensive collection of the butterflies, found in the Western and Annapurna Conservation Area region of Nepal; and Gurkha Museum featuring the history of the Gurkha soldiers.

== Music ==
The universal instruments used in Nepalese music include the &quot;madal&quot; (small leather drum), &quot;bansuri&quot; (bamboo flute), and &quot;saarangi&quot;. These instruments are prominent features of the traditional folk music (&quot;lok gít&quot; or lok geet) in Pokhara, which is actually the western (Gandaki, Dhaulagiri and Lumbini) branch of Nepali &quot;lok geet&quot;. Some examples of music of this region are &quot;Resham Firiri&quot; (रेशम फिरिरी) and &quot;Khyalee Tune&quot; (ख्याली धुन).

The &quot;lok geet&quot; started airing in Radio Nepal during the 1950s and artists such as Jhalakman Gandharva, Dharma Raj Thapa are considered pioneers in bringing the &quot;lok git&quot; into mass media. During early and late 1990s, bands from Pokhara like Nepathya started their very successful fusion of western rock and pop with traditional folk music. Since then several other musical groups in Nepal have adopted the &quot;lok&quot;-pop/rock style producing dozens of albums every year.

Another important part of cultural music of western Nepal, and hence Pokhara, is the &quot;Panché Baaja&quot; (पञ्चे बाजा), a traditional musical band performed generally during marriage ceremonies by the &quot;damaai&quot; musicians.

The musical culture in Pokhara is quite dynamic and in recent years, Western rock and roll, pop, rap and hip-hop are becoming increasingly popular with frequently held musical concerts; however, the traditional &quot;lok&quot; and modern (semi-classical) Nepali music are predominantly favored by the general population. More musical concerts are held in Pokhara than in any other city in the country.

==Media and communications==

There are 19 privately owned local FM stations in the Pokhara valley. An additional 4 FM stations from Kathmandu have their relay broadcast stations in Pokhara. There are six community radio stations and five television stations.

Approximately 14 national daily newspapers in Nepali are published in the city, along with several other weekly and monthly news magazines. All major national newspapers published in Kathmandu have distributions in Pokhara. A number of online news portals are also updated from Pokhara, as well as some entertainment-based websites. Popular technology based web-magazine TechSansar also started in Pokhara.

Pokhara has got 4G network of Nepal Telecom, Smart Cell and Ncell. The majority of the people in the city access internet through mobiles, numerous cyber cafes, and local wireless ISPs. Most tourist restaurants and hotels also provide WiFi services.

<doc id="1037034" wikidata="Q2276851" url="?curid=1037034" title="Shane Leslie">
<text>Sir John Randolph Leslie, 3rd Baronet (24 September 1885 – 14 August 1971), commonly known as Sir Shane Leslie, was an Anglo-Irish diplomat and writer. He was a first cousin of Sir Winston Churchill. In 1908, Leslie became a Roman Catholic and supported Irish Home Rule.

==Childhood and education==

Leslie was born in Glaslough, County Monaghan, into a wealthy Anglo-Irish landowning family (49,968 acres). His father was Sir John Leslie, 2nd Baronet, and his mother, Leonie Jerome, was the sister of Winston Churchill&#x27;s mother, Jennie. Both were daughters of Leonard W. Jerome. His ancestor, the Right Reverend John Leslie, Bishop of the Isles, moved from Scotland to Ireland in 1633 when he was made Bishop of Raphoe in County Donegal and was made Bishop of Clogher in 1661. Bishop Leslie was a vocal opponent of Oliver Cromwell.

Together with his brother Norman, Leslie&#x27;s early education began at home where a German governess, Clara Woelke, was their first teacher. As children the brothers had more contact with servants than they had with their parents. Leslie&#x27;s own daughter, Anita, said that &quot;In my parents&#x27; view schools performed the same functions that kennels did for dogs. They were places where pets could be conveniently deposited while their owners travelled.&quot;

Leslie was educated at Ludgrove School, then Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge University he became a Roman Catholic and a supporter of Irish Home Rule. He adopted an anglicised Irish variant of his name (&quot;Shane&quot;). Not overly impressed by Eton, as a lower boy he and his roommates occupied &quot;an old battered warren betwixt the chapel cemetery and Wise&#x27;s horse yard ... [T]he food was wretched and tasteless ... As for thrashings which tyrannised rather than disciplined our house, they were excessive. Bullying was endemic and Irish boys were ridiculed, especially on St Patrick&#x27;s Day.&quot;

Leslie refused to send his own sons to Eton. They were educated at Roman Catholic Benedictine schools: Jack at Downside School and Desmond at Ampleforth College.

==Adult life==
In the January 1910 general election Leslie stood as the Irish Parliamentary Party candidate for the Londonderry City division, losing by just 57 votes. In the second general election later that year he was again narrowly defeated by the Unionist candidate.

Before World War I, Leslie travelled extensively and in 1912 he married Marjorie Ide, the youngest daughter of Henry Clay Ide, then United States ambassador to Spain and former Governor-General of the Philippines. His parents and other family members moved temporarily to London at the outbreak of war.

During the war he was in a British Ambulance Corps, until invalided out; he was then sent to Washington, D.C. to help the British Ambassador, Sir Cecil Spring Rice, soften Irish-American hostility towards England and obtain American intervention in the war in the aftermath of the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin and the execution of its leaders. But he also looked to Ireland for inspiration when writing and edited a literary magazine that contained much Irish verse. He became a supporter of the ideals of Irish nationalism, although not physical force republicanism.

In the 1918 election the Irish Parliamentary Party lost massively to Sinn Féin, putting an end to Shane Leslie&#x27;s political career, but as the first cousin of Winston Churchill he remained a primary witness to much that was said and done outside the official record during the negotiation of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. Disappointed, he felt unwanted in Ireland and abandoned by the British. Like many members of the landed gentry from the 1880s who were obliged to turn to other occupations, he could no longer rely on income from landholdings.

He wrote extensively, in a wide range of styles, in verse, prose, and polemic, over several decades. His writings include &quot;The End of a Chapter&quot; (1916), while hospitalised during the Great War, &quot;The Oppidan&quot; (1922), a roman à clef about his life and contemporaries at Eton, an edition of the &quot;Letters of Herbert Cardinal Vaughan to Lady Herbert of Lea&quot; (1942), and a biography &quot;Mrs Fitzherbert: a life chiefly from unpublished sources&quot; (1939), together with an edition of her letters (with Maria Anne Fitzherbert), &quot;The letters of Mrs Fitzherbert and connected papers; being the second volume of the life of Mrs. Fitzherbert&quot; (1944). He also wrote &quot;Mark Sykes: His Life and Letters&quot; (1923), a biography of the English traveller, Conservative Party politician and diplomatic advisor. He advised budding novelist Scott Fitzgerald on the title of his 1st novel, they shared correspondence with the future Mnsg William A Hemmick who was Fitzgerald&#x27;s teacher at the now shut Newman School.

A passionate advocate of reforestation, he found the business of running an estate uncreative and boring, and transferred the estate entailed to him to his eldest son, John Norman Leslie, who succeeded as the 4th Baronet. He transferred St Patrick&#x27;s Purgatory on Lough Derg to the Roman Catholic Bishop of Clogher, Eugene O&#x27;Callaghan.

The wealth of the Leslies had waned by the 1930s following the Wall Street crash of 1929 and a farm that was loss making. In his unpublished memoirs, he wrote &quot;a gentleman&#x27;s standing in his world was signalled by his list of clubs and it was worth paying hundreds of pounds in subs&quot;. They continued to maintain their lifestyle, involving attendance at the London season and the entertainment of distinguished visitors, including Anthony Eden at Glaslough. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939 he joined the Home Guard. He spent the remainder of his life between Glaslough and London.

==Family==
He was the elder son of Sir John Leslie, 2nd Baronet, and Leonie Blanche Jerome. He married, firstly, Marjorie Ide, daughter of General Henry Clay Ide, on 11 June 1912 and had two sons and one daughter:

*Anita Theodosia Moira Rodzianko King (21 November 1914 – 5 November 1985), novelist and biographer; was married (secondly) to Commander Bill King, World War II submarine commander and yachtsman; had two children; friend of Hazel Lavery who was reputedly a paramour of Michael Collins.
*Sir John Norman Ide Leslie, 4th Baronet (6 December 1916 – 18 April 2016), popularly known as &quot;Sir Jack Leslie&quot;, never married or sired children.
*Desmond Arthur Peter Leslie (29 June 1921 – 21 February 2001).

His first wife Marjorie died on 8 February 1951. On 30 May 1958 at the Catholic Church of St Peter &amp; Edward, Westminster, Shane Leslie (72) married Mrs Iris Carola Frazer (55), who was the daughter of Charles Miskin Laing and Etheldreda Janet Laing.

He died at 15b Palmeira Court, Hove, Sussex on 14 April 1971, aged 85 and a requiem mass was held for him in Westminster Cathedral on 12 October 1971.

<text>Ashampstead is a small village and civil parish in the rural area between Reading, Newbury and Streatley in Berkshire, England. The parish population is about 400, occupying some 150 dwellings.

==History==
The village was called &quot;Esshamstede&quot; in the 13th and 14th centuries. The Church of England parish church of Saint Clement dates from the 12th century. It has 13th century frescoes and a 15th-century wooden bell turret. It is believed the frescoes may have been painted by monks from the nearby Reading Abbey. The only remaining bell dates from 1662.

==Notable People==
* The composer Henry Balfour Gardiner bought Field House, Ashampstead Green in 1909, moved in after alterations in 1911, and stayed until 1930. Many musicians, including Bax, Delius, Percy Grainger, Holst and Peter Warlock visited him there. The orchestral piece &quot;A Berkshire Idyll&quot; was completed there on 28 July, 1913.

<doc id="1037041" wikidata="Q4875953" url="?curid=1037041" title="Beacon Hill Battery">
<text>Beacon Hill Battery (also known as Beacon Hill Fort) is a late-19th and 20th century coastal fortification that was built to defend the port of Harwich, Essex. It is a scheduled ancient monument.

==Prior military use of the site==

Beacon Hill is a promontory on the Harwich peninsula, about one kilometre south of the town. It overlooks the estuaries of the Stour and Orwell rivers on the approach to the harbour, which has been an important civil and naval port since the Middle Ages.

===Tudor blockhouse: House-upon-the-Hill===
The first fortification built on the site was one of three blockhouses, constructed at Harwich during the reign of Henry VIII, following his visit to the town in 1543. These were Device Forts, built at Tower House, Middle House and the House-upon-the-Hill. They were abandoned within ten years, only to be briefly revived in 1588, owing to the threat posed by the Spanish Armada. By 1625 the site had again fallen into disrepair and Harwich was considered to be defenceless. The site of the actual blockhouse was destroyed by erosion.

===Napoleonic Wars===
A nearby site was chosen for Harwich Barracks. These were built in 1803. The original occupants were the West Essex Regiment and the Royal Buckinghamshire Militia. On the promontory itself, an earthen artillery battery of five 24-pounder guns was constructed in 1812, intended to supplement the larger Harwich Redoubt, which had been completed to the north in 1810 and was armed with ten 24-pounders. By 1822, the battery had been lost to erosion, and a replacement planned in 1839 was not built.

==Beacon Hill Battery==
In 1887, renewed fear of a French invasion prompted the Secretary of State for War, Edward Stanhope, to chair a committee on the &quot;Fortifications and Armaments of Military and Mercantile Ports&quot;. One of the results of the committee&#x27;s report was the ordering of a new artillery battery at Beacon Hill in September 1888; work had been completed by May 1892. The battery was built to an innovative design; an artificial mound in the centre of the promontory served to conceal the underground magazines, shelters and ancillary buildings, while creating a natural-looking profile against which, the lighter weapons at the foot of the mound would be difficult to see. The rear of the work was protected by a defensive perimeter built to a new design called the Twydall Profile, consisting of an earthen rampart, fronted by a glacis sloping down to a shallow ditch that concealed a steel palisade fence.

The battery was powerfully armed with a single BL 10-inch gun and a single BL 6-inch gun on a hydro-pneumatic disappearing mountings, together with two QF 4.7-inch guns. In 1894, a former practice battery sited near the tip of the headland and dating from 1871 was rebuilt to mount four RML 64-pounder guns on traversing carriages for close defence. Two QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns were added in 1898.

By the turn of the 20th century, concern had shifted from France to Germany, and the battery&#x27;s armament was the subject of several upgrades. In 1898, a depression range finder and telephone system were installed. In 1901, a further BL 6-inch gun was added to the north of the battery. In 1903, the original guns were replaced with three of the latest BL 6-inch Mk VII guns, but retaining the two old 4.7-inch guns. During the First World War, Harwich was an important destroyer base; improvements to the battery included two QF 1-pounder pom-pom anti-aircraft guns.

The fort remained operational in the inter-war period, although the 4.7-inch guns were finally retired. Plans to modernise the battery had not been started before the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1940, a new emplacement, known as &quot;Cornwallis Battery&quot; was constructed for two rapid-firing QF 6-pounder 10 cwt guns on a twin-barrelled mounting, intended to counter fast attack craft, which also included a new magazine, shelters and a prominent three-storey battery observation post (BOP). The 6-inch guns were partially enclosed by concrete casemates to protect the crews from air attack. In April 1941, a hexagonal tower was built 100 yards north of Beacon Hill. This housed a Type 287 Radio Direction Finding (RDF) array, used to monitor the observation mine field installed across the harbour entrance. It remained in use until December 1943. The tower still retains its original array with replacement &#x27;pig trough&#x27; reflectors. Ground defences were improved by the addition of pillboxes, trenches and searchlight emplacements. Overlooking the breakwater, a concrete blockhouse housed an Extended Defence Officer (EXDO) post, from where naval officers could electrically detonate sea mines in the estuary.

==Decommissioning and subsequent restoration==
The fort was finally decommissioned in 1956 on the dissolution of coast artillery in the United Kingdom.

In early 2018, part of Beacon Hill Battery was bought by Paul Valentine and Barry Sharp as part of a restoration project.

<text>Bath Side Battery was built in 1811 to cover the anchorage of the port of Harwich, Essex, England, as part of the same complex as the Redoubt, armed with 3 × 24-pdr (11 kg) cannon. The battery was allowed to decay, and after 1990 excavations is marked out on the ground in front of the Anchor pub, Stour Road. This Public House has since been demolished. As of April 2019, the land is still unused, with future plans as yet unknown.

<doc id="1037059" wikidata="Q247700" url="?curid=1037059" title="Plane (esotericism)">
<text>In esoteric cosmology, a plane is conceived as a subtle state, level, or region of reality, each plane corresponding to some type, kind, or category of being.

The concept may be found in religious and esoteric teachings which propound the idea of a whole series of subtle planes or worlds or dimensions which, from a center, interpenetrate themselves and the physical planet in which we live, the solar systems, and all the physical structures of the universe. This interpenetration of planes culminates in the universe itself as a physical structured, dynamic and evolutive expression emanated through a series of steadily denser stages, becoming progressively more material and embodied.

The emanation is conceived, according to esoteric teachings, to have originated, at the dawn of the universe&#x27;s manifestation, in &quot;The Supreme Being&quot; who sent out—from the unmanifested &quot;Absolute&quot; beyond comprehension—the dynamic force of creative energy, as &quot;sound-vibration&quot; (&quot;the Word&quot;), into the abyss of space. Alternatively, it states that this dynamic force is being sent forth, through the ages, framing all things that constitute and inhabit the universe.

==Origins of the concept==
The original source of the word &quot;plane&quot; in this context is the late Neoplatonist Proclus, who refers to &quot;to platos&quot;, &quot;breadth&quot;, which was the equivalent of the 19th-century theosophical use. An example is the phrase &quot;en to psychiko platei&quot;.

==Esoteric conceptions==
In the late 19th century, the metaphysical term &quot;planes&quot; was popularised by the theosophy of H. P. Blavatsky, who in &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; and other writings propounded a complex cosmology consisting of seven planes and subplanes, based on a synthesis of Eastern and Western ideas. The planes in Theosophy were further systematized in the writings of Annie Besant and C. W. Leadbeater.

From theosophy the term made its way to later esoteric systems such as that of Alice Bailey. Max Theon used the word &quot;States&quot; (French &quot;Etat&quot;) rather than &quot;Planes&quot;, in his cosmic philosophy, but the meaning is the same.

In the early 20th century, Max Heindel presented in &quot;The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception&quot; a cosmology related to the scheme of evolution in general and the evolution of the Solar System and the Earth in particular, according to the Rosicrucians. He establishes, through the conceptions presented, a bridge between modern science (currently starting research into the subtler &quot;etheric&quot; plane of existence behind the physical) and religion, in order that this last one may be able to address man&#x27;s &quot;inner&quot; questions raised by scientific advancement.

==The planes==
Many occult, psychic, metaphysical, mystical, and esoteric teachings assert that at least four separate planes of existence exist; however, these differing occult and metaphysical schools often label the planes of existence with differing terminologies. These planes of existence often tend to overlap with each other heavily in both description and conception (especially between schools), and can roughly be delineated into &quot;physical&quot;, &quot;mental&quot;, &quot;spiritual&quot;, or &quot;transcendent&quot; categories.

Do note that the listing of planes below is based mostly on Theosophy. Other religions might structure their planes significantly differently.

===Physical plane===
The physical plane, physical world, or physical universe, in emanationist metaphysics taught in Neoplatonism, Hermeticism, Hinduism and Theosophy, refers to the visible reality of space and time, energy and matter: the physical universe in occultism and esoteric cosmology is the lowest or densest of a series of planes of existence.

According to Theosophists, after the material plane is the etheric plane and both of these planes are connected to make up the first (physical) plane. Theosophy also teaches that when the physical body dies the etheric body is left behind and the soul forms into an astral body on the astral plane.

The psychical researcher F. W. H. Myers proposed the existence of a &quot;metetherial world&quot;, which he wrote to be a world of images lying beyond the physical world. He wrote that apparitions have a real existence in the metetherial world which he described as a dream-like world.

===Astral plane===

The astral plane, also called the astral world, is where consciousness goes after physical death. According to occult philosophy, all people possess an astral body. The astral plane (also known as the astral world) was postulated by classical (particularly neoplatonic), medieval, oriental, and esoteric philosophies and mystery religions. It is the world of the planetary spheres, crossed by the soul in its astral body on the way to being born and after death, and generally said to be populated by angels, spirits, or other non-physical beings.

In the late 19th and early 20th century the term was popularised by Theosophy and neo-Rosicrucianism. According to occult teachings the astral plane can be visited consciously through astral projection, meditation, and mantra, near-death experience, lucid dreaming, or other means. Individuals that are trained in the use of the astral vehicle can separate their consciousness in the astral vehicle from the physical body at will.

The Theosophist author Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa wrote: &quot;When a person dies, they become fully conscious in the astral body. After a certain time, the astral body disintegrates, and the person then becomes conscious on the mental plane.&quot;

Occultist George Arundale wrote:

In the astral world exist temporarily all those physical entities, men and animals, for whom sleep involves a separation of the physical body for a time from the higher bodies. While we &quot;sleep&quot;, we live in our astral bodies, either fully conscious and active, or partly conscious and semi-dormant, as the case may be, according to our evolutionary growth; when we &quot;wake&quot;, the physical and the higher bodies are interlocked again, and we cease to be inhabitants of the astral world.

Some writers have asserted the astral plane can be reached by dreaming. Sylvan Muldoon and psychical researcher Hereward Carrington in their book &quot;The Projection of the Astral Body&quot; (1929) wrote:

When you are dreaming you are not really in the same world as when you are conscious – in the physical – although the two worlds merge into one another. While dreaming, you really are in the astral plane, and usually your astral body is in the zone of quietude.

In his book &quot;&quot;, Paramhansa Yogananda provides details about the astral planes learned from his resurrected guru Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri. Yogananda reveals that nearly all individuals enter the astral planes after death. There they work out the seeds of past karma through astral incarnations, or (if their karma requires) they return to earthly incarnations for further refinement. Once an individual has attained the meditative state of nirvikalpa samadhi in an earthy or astral incarnation, the soul may progress upward to the &quot;illumined astral planet&quot; of Hiranyaloka. After this transitional stage, the soul may then move upward to the more subtle causal spheres where many incarnations allow them to further refine until final unification.

Astral projection author Robert Bruce describes the astral as seven planes that take the form of planar surfaces when approached from a distance, separated by immense coloured &quot;buffer zones&quot;. These planes are endlessly repeating ruled Cartesian coordinate system grids, tiled with a single signature pattern that is different for each plane. Higher planes have bright, colourful patterns, whereas lower planes appear far duller. Every detail of these patterns acts as a consistent portal to a different kingdom inside the plane, which itself comprises many separate realms. Bruce notes that the astral may also be entered by means of long tubes that bear visual similarity to these planes, and conjectures that the grids and tubes are in fact the same structures approached from a different perceptual angle.

===Mental plane===
Charles Webster Leadbeater wrote:

In the mental world one formulates a thought and it is instantly transmitted to the mind of another without any expression in the form of words. Therefore on that plane language does not matter in the least; but helpers working in the astral world, who have not yet the power to use the mental vehicle.

Annie Besant wrote that &quot;The mental plane, as its name implies, is that which belongs to consciousness working as thought; not of the mind as it works through the brain, but as it works through its own world, unencumbered with physical spirit-matter.&quot;

A detailed description of the mental plane, along with the mental body, is provided by Arthur E. Powell, who has compiled information in the works of Besant and Leadbeater in a series of books on each of the subtle bodies.

===Causal plane===

According to Hindu occultism the mental plane consists of two divisions, the lower division is known as heaven (&quot;Svargaloka&quot;) and the upper division is known as the causal plane (&quot;Maharloka&quot;).

Sivaya Subramuniyaswami wrote:

The causal plane is the world of light and blessedness, the highest of heavenly regions, extolled in the scriptures of all faiths. It is the foundation of existence, the source of visions, the point of conception, the apex of creation. The causal plane is the abode of Lord Siva and his entourage of Mahadevas and other highly evolved souls who exist in their own self-effulgent form—radiant bodies of centillions of quantum light particles.

Sri Aurobindo developed a very different concept of the mental plane, through his own synthesis of Vedanta (including the Taittiriya Upanishad), Tantra, Theosophy, and Max Théon ideas (which he received via The Mother, who was Theon&#x27;s student in occultism for two years). In this cosmology, there are seven cosmic planes, three lower, corresponding to relative existence (the Physical, Vital, and Mental), and four higher, representing infinite divine reality (&quot;Life Divine&quot; bk. 1 ch. 27) The Aurobindonian Mind or Mental Plane constitutes a large zone of being from the mental vital to the overmental divine region (&quot;Letters on Yoga&quot;, Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984), but as with the later Theosophical concept it constitutes an objective reality of sheer mind or thought.

===Buddhic plane===

The buddhic plane is described as a realm of pure consciousness. According to Theosophy the buddhic plane exists to develop buddhic consciousness which means to become unselfish and solve any problems with the ego. Charles Leadbeater wrote that in the buddhic plane man casts off the delusion of the self and enters a realization of unity.

Annie Besant defined the buddhic plane as Persistent, conscious, spiritual awareness. This is the full consciousness of the buddhic or intuitional level. This is the perceptive consciousness which is the outstanding characteristic of the Hierarchy. The life focus of the man shifts to the buddhic plane. This is the fourth or middle state of consciousness.

Sri Aurobindo calls the level above the mental plane the supermind.

===Spiritual plane===

George Winslow Plummer wrote that the spiritual plane is split into many sub-planes (such as the &quot;Atmic plane&quot;) and that on these planes live spiritual being who are more advanced in development and status than ordinary man.

===Divine plane===
According to some occult teachings, all souls are born on the divine plane and then descend down through the lower planes; however souls will work their way back to the divine plane. Joshua David Stone describes the plane as complete unity with God. Rosicrucianism teaches that the divine plane is where Jesus dwelt in Christ consciousness.

==The Summerland==

The Summerland is the name given by Theosophists, Spiritualists, Wiccans, and some earth-based contemporary pagan religions to their conceptualization of existence on a plane in an afterlife.

Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) inspired Andrew Jackson Davis (1826–1910), in his major work &quot;The Great Harmonia&quot; to say that Summerland is the pinnacle of spiritual achievement in the afterlife; that is, it is the highest level, or &quot;sphere&quot;, of the afterlife we can hope to enter. The common portrayal of the Summerland is as a place of rest for souls after or between their earthly incarnations. The Summerland is also envisioned as a place for recollection and reunion with deceased loved ones.

As the name suggests, it is often imagined as a place of beauty and peace, where everything people hold close to their hearts is preserved in its fullest beauty for eternity. It is envisioned as containing wide (possibly eternal) fields of rolling green hills and lush grass. In Theosophy, the term &quot;Summerland&quot; is used without the definite article &quot;the&quot;. Summerland, also called the Astral plane Heaven, is depicted as where souls who have been good in their previous lives go between incarnations. Those who have been bad go to Hell, which is believed to be located below the surface of the Earth and is on the astral plane and is composed of the densest astral matter; the Spiritual Hierarchy functioning within Earth functions on the etheric plane below the surface of the Earth.

Theosophists also believe there is another higher level of heaven called Devachan, also called the Mental plane Heaven, which some but not all souls reach between incarnations—only those souls that are more highly developed spiritually reach this level, those souls that are at the first, second, and third levels of initiation. Devachan is several miles (around 10 km) higher above the surface of Earth than Summerland..

==Inhabitants of the various planes==
Occult writers such as Geoffrey Hodson, Mellie Uyldert, and Dora van Gelder attempted to classify different spiritual beings into a hierarchy based on their assumed place and function on the planes of existence.

Charles Webster Leadbeater fundamentally described and incorporated his comprehension of intangible beings for Theosophy. Along with him there are various planes intertwined with the quotidian human world and are all inhabited by multitudes of entities. Each plane is purported as composed of discrete density of &quot;astral or ethereal matter&quot; and frequently the denizens of a plane have no discernment of other ones. Other Theosophical writers such as Alice Bailey, a contemporary of Leadbeater, also gave continuousness to Theosophical concepts of ethereal beings and her works had a great impact over New Age movement. She puts the nature spirits and devas as ethereal beings immersed in macro divisions of an interwoven threefold universe, usually they belong to the etheric, astral, or mental planes. The ethereal entities of the four kingdoms, Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, are forces of nature.

The Dutch writer and clairvoyant Mellie Uyldert characterized the semblance and behavior of ethereal entities on the etheric plane, which, she said, hover above plants and transfer energy for vitalizing the plant, then nourishing themselves on rays of sunlight. She depicted them as asexual gender, and composed of &quot;etheric&quot; matter.
They fly three meters over the ground, some have wings like butterflies while others only have a small face and an aura waving graciously. Some are huge while others may have the size of one inch.

<doc id="1037062" wikidata="Q4397549" url="?curid=1037062" title="Rhombomere">
<text>In the vertebrate embryo, a rhombomere is a transiently divided segment of the developing neural tube, within the hindbrain region (a neuromere) in the area that will eventually become the rhombencephalon. The rhombomeres appear as a series of slightly constricted swellings in the neural tube, caudal to the cephalic flexure. In human embryonic development, the rhombomeres are present by day 29.

==Function==
In the early developmental stages of the neural tube, segmentation of the neuroepithelium occurs. This segmentation turns into a series of neuromeres. Each segment is called a rhombomere. Every rhombomere develops its own set of ganglia and nerves. Later on in development, rhombomeres form the rhombocephalon, which forms the hindbrain in vertebrates. Each rhombomere expresses its own unique set of genes, which has been shown to influence postnatal rhythmic behaviors, such as respiration, mastication, and walking. In mice, it was shown that the patterning of the neural tube into rhombomeric segments may regulate spatial and temporal appearance of the central pattern generator. Rhombomeres are considered self-governing developmental units, with certain aspects of the rhombomere phenotype being determined at the time of formation. Each rhombomere expresses a unique combination of transcription factors, and so each rhombomeric domain has its own distinct molecular cues that could, theoretically, establish rhombomere-specific patterns of neuronal differentiation. Some of these neuronal populations have been identified in some species. Many of the mature hindbrain nuclei can occupy either one or several rhombomere-derived regions. Vestibular nuclei have been shown to span all the rhombomeres, some correlating with the boundaries of the rhombomeres. Using phosphorylated retrograde labeling, it has been shown that vestibulospinal groups correspond mostly to single rhombomeres rather than over several rhombomeric regions. It has also been shown that the vestibule-ocular groups can either relate to single or multiple rhombomeres, as long as the rhombomeres are closely related. The conclusion drawn was that segmentation of the hindbrain contributes to the way axons project within the vestibular complex. Finally, vestibulospinal neurons have been shown to differentiate in three neighboring rhombomeres, specifically r4, r5, and r6. While vestibule-ocular neurons differentiate across seven, the least differentiated in f4. The method of this differentiate is still unknown, with many types of proteins involved in both the migration, expression of proteins, and for neuron growth and apoptosis. The types of receptors, as well, can vary their activity to be cell-specific.

Rhombomeres determine the pattern of the following maturation of the rhombencephalon into its final parts. The final parts are defined as the pons, cerebellum and medulla.

Cells that form the boundaries of the rhombomere bulges proliferate much faster than those in the middle. It is very difficult for cells to cross from one rhombomere to another, so cells tend to stay within one rhombomere. Each rhombomere eventually gives rise to one or more vestibular neuron types. However, it is not necessarily dependent on segmentation. The motor nerves form depending on rhombomeric patterns, but each nerve can come from either one rhombomere or a pair of rhombomeres that are neighbors. Furthermore, the correct development of the various pharyngeal arches is believed to depend on interactions with specific rhombomeres. With these mechanisms, neural crest cells, for instance, from each rhombomere give rise to different ganglia, or clusters of neurons. Many of these rhombomeres have been mapped to an extent in species other than human. For example, r2 has been shown to give rise to the trigeminal ganglion, while r4 has been shown to give rise to the geniculate ganglion as well as spiral and Scarpa&#x27;s ganglia. r5 and r6 gives rise to the abducens nerve, and the lower part of r6 and the upper part of r7 gives rise to the petrosal ganglion. Finally, the border of r7 that is not in contact with r6 gives rise to the jugular/nodose ganglia. These mappings, however, cannot be applied cross species.

Studies have shown that the number of neurons in the hindbrain increase as a species evolves. For example, a mouse has more neurons than a slug, but a chimp has more neurons than a mouse. One can assume that part of this comes from having to adapt to an increase in the size of the species. Also, in some species, the rhombomeres are obviously segmented and stay this way for an extended period of time. In other species, the segmentation eventually disappears. For example, rhombomeres are detectable by light microscopy in Swiss/Webster strain of mice for up to embryonic day (E)10.5, but they disappear at E11.5. Many rhombomeres, if compared across species, do not form into the same things. For example, r2 and r3 have been mapped to the trigeminal motoneurons in many species. However, not all species have this correlation.

Each rhombomere has its own set of receptors, and the same receptors can cause different actions. For example, one study showed that there are proteins called Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 that affect ventral hindbrain development, and are also required for motoneuron development and correct neural patterning in the hindbrain. However, how important are they and what their specific roles are was unclear. By mutating the proteins Gli2 and Gli3, which were especially studied, it was found that Gli2 and Gli3 contain both activation and repression domains, while Gli1 only had activation domains, which were entirely transcriptional. Gli2 was also found to be a stronger activator while Gli3 was a strong repressor. Gli2 and Gli3 had overlapping functions that concerned the patterning of the ventral spinal cord which was important for correct organization and formation of the motoneurons. This was shown when mutation of the Gli3 protein showed only a slight decrease in expression of Olig2, while when the Gli2 protein was mutated, the expression of Olig2 was not detected. Olig2 is normally expressed in the ventral area of the neural tube. Mutations in the Gli2 protein causes more severe damage in the ventral patterning of the hindbrain than that of the spinal cord. This shows that Gli2 performs different functions in the hindbrain that Gli3 is unable to substitute. Gli2 and Gli3 in a developing hindbrain also have distinct functions in the Shh (sonic hedgehog) signal transduction. This is caused by differential modulation of gene expression that is specific to each rhombomere. Finally, studies have shown that in rhombomere 4, the ventral patterning is less affected by the mutation of Gli2. This shows that this particular rhombomere has different requirements for Gli proteins.

The Hox gene also has been shown to play a part in the formation of the cranial motor nerves. The fate of a rhombomere has been shown to be affected by differential expression of the Hox gene. With mutations in the Hox gene, the cranial motor nerves formed in different locations than normal or simply did not form altogether. One possibility for this was that the Hox gene was somehow involved in regionalization within the neural tube, and that expression of this particular gene correlated with the amount of migration that occurred. However, no correlation could be found. Many studies showed small amounts of correlation, but there were equal amounts showing a complete lack of correlation. The amount of correlation that occurred was not enough to draw a concrete conclusion from. This, however, could have happened because studies have only drawn data points from a limited window of time. Another possibility for this lack of correlation is that most studies were based on in situ hybridization, which only maps the location of transcripts rather than proteins. A third possibility is that studies focused on rhombomeres as landmarks, and therefore correlated expression domains to these. While studies were unable to show a relationship between closely related neurons from the rhombomeres and Hox gene expression, the Hox gene is still an important factor when it comes to specification of the neuronal phenotype. The Hox gene was expressed rostrocaudally in the same sequence that was physically within the chromosome and its transcription was regulated by retinoic acid. The Hox gene has been identified in all vertebrates, and the number of Hox genes expressed increases as the vertebrate species diverge farther away from the invertebrate species. Certain neuron groups relate to Hox gene expression. At the r4 level, Hoxb1 is suspected to bestow rhombomere 4 cell identity.

Rhombomeres have also been shown to be able to affect the position that reticulospinal and branchiomotor neurons grow in. Each rhombomere can cause a repeated pattern of rhombomere-specific neurons, including reticulospinal neurons, many of which share properties such as mediolateral location. Reticulospinal neurons also occupy different areas in rhombomeres in different species. It was found in one study that reticular neurons in the lamprey hindbrain, which included isthmic, bulbar, and Mauthner cells, developed in conserved rhombomere-specific positions, similar to those in the zebrafish. In different species, however, reticulospinal neurons occupy different areas in rhombomeres. The trigeminal and facial motor nuclei were also shown to not correlate well with the rhombomere boundaries in the lamprey.

Several studies have shown that the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is secreted from the midbrain-rhombomere 1 boundary. These proteins instruct cell behavior in the surrounding neuroectoderm. However, the mechanism behind the integration of the signal and the actions that follow remains unclear. Studies have shown that the FGF receptors, or FGFRs act partially redundantly to support cell survival in the dorsal ectoderm, promote r1 tissue identity, and regulate the production of ventral neuronal populations, including the midbrain dopaminergic neurons. In mice, while mutations of the fgfr2 and fgfr3 did not interfere with the development of the midbrain and r1, mutation of fgfr1 caused midbrain and r1 defects.

Studies have shown that the earliest serotonergic neurons were started in the anterior rhombomeres. The most dorsal group of neurons originated from rhombomere 1, and the posterior raphe—which forms from the rhombomeres—is believed to derive from the posterior rhombomeres at a slightly later stage of embryonic development.

Rhombomeres also lead to the creation of vestibular projection neurons, which are probably produced relatively early in the developmental stages of the brain stem.

In the rhombomeres, members of the T-box transcription factor family, have been linked to the proper development of migrating cells. While the hindbrain is developing, trigeminal cell bodies have been shown to migrate dorsolaterally within rhombomeres 2 and 3, while facial cells move dorsolaterally into r5 near the pial surface. Neurons that form the facial nucleus are produced in r4, but move along the anteroposterior axis of the hindbrain into r6, after which they move dorsolaterally. The vestibuloacoustic neurons are also produced in r4. However, they have a unique migration pattern, where their cell bodies cross the midline to the contralateral side. From this one can conclude that multiple subclasses of motor neurons are produced in specific locations in the developing hindbrain. All of them are related by the expression of Tbx20. Motor neurons produced in the hindbrain have Tbx20 selectively expressed. In Tbx20 mutations, the patterning of the regions of the rhombomeres and motor neurons were normal when they were conditional mutations and the neurons were post-mitotic. Tbx20 mutants pre-mitotic showed many cell migration deficiencies, including abnormal dorsolateral migration of the trigeminal cells, arrested tangential migration of the facial neurons, and a lack of transmedian migration of vestibuloacoustic cells. However, hindbrain motor neurons lacking Tbx20 retained the ability to extend neurites into the periphery. The complete elimination of Tbx20 does not cause trigeminal and facial neurons to switch to hypoglossal neurons. Facial neurons have been shown to migrate tangentially from r4 to r6, while trigeminal neurons that are produced in r2 migrate dorsolaterally non-radially. Vestibuloacoustic cells migrate along the midline at r4 contralaterally in the hindbrain. Tbx20 seems to have context-dependent transcriptional activity. This means that it is able to control different cell migration programs specific to different types of cells. It must be able to regulate these patterns by different means.

While many studies have been done on rhombomeres where rhombomeres are grafted cross species, imprecision can occur. One possible source is damage to the rhombomere during the removal, transportation, or grafting process. Another possible source is the mixture of the cells from different species after the rhombomeres have been grafted on, which could lead to the contamination of one rhombomeric region with another, most likely from the neighboring rhombomeres.

<doc id="1037063" wikidata="Q1098435" url="?curid=1037063" title="It's a Shame About Ray">
<text>It&#x27;s a Shame About Ray is the fifth album by American alternative rock band the Lemonheads, released on June 2, 1992. The album was produced by the Robb Brothers. At the time of principal recording, the band consisted of Evan Dando (lead vocals, guitar), Juliana Hatfield (bass, backing vocals) and David Ryan (drums). Though not originally on the album, the band&#x27;s cover of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; was added to the album in later pressings after it had become a major worldwide radio hit, and it features a later lineup of the band with Nic Dalton on bass.

== History ==
The title track was inspired by a quote that band leader Evan Dando had seen in a Sydney newspaper in reference to a kid called Ray who kept getting kicked out of every school he went to. 

The album became an international hit for the band, reaching #31 in the UK Top 100 as well as #5 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. The song was later included at #138 on &quot;Pitchfork&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Top 200 Tracks of the 90s&quot; list. The music video features Johnny Depp.

Actress Polly Noonan and her car appear on the cover of the album.

===Rereleases===
After its initial release, the album was reissued with a cover of the song &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, written by Paul Simon and originally recorded by Simon &amp; Garfunkel. The Lemonheads&#x27; version was recorded to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the release of the film &quot;The Graduate.&quot; The band recorded the song in Berlin while on tour, with Nic Dalton on bass guitar. It was released as a single. Also, the song &quot;My Drug Buddy&quot; was later truncated to just &quot;Buddy,&quot; but was later restored.

The album was reissued by Rhino in 2008 as a collector&#x27;s edition that includes several demo versions of album tracks, the B-side song &quot;Shaky Ground&quot; and a DVD containing the previously released (on VHS) &quot;Two Weeks in Australia&quot;.

===Notable performances===
The Lemonheads toured Australia in late 2010, playing the album in its entirety along with songs from their other albums.

The band performed the entire album at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire on September 14–15, 2005, as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties–curated Don&#x27;t Look Back concert series, with &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; missing from the setlist.

The band performed the album in its entirety while opening for certain dates of Jawbreaker&#x27;s 2022 spring tour.

<text>The New Forest pony is one of the recognised mountain and moorland or native pony breeds of the British Isles. Height varies from around ; ponies of all heights should be strong, workmanlike, and of a good riding type. They are valued for hardiness, strength, and sure-footedness.

The breed is indigenous to the New Forest in Hampshire in southern England. DNA studies have shown ancient shared ancestry with the Celtic-type Asturcón and Pottok ponies. Many breeds have contributed to the foundation bloodstock of the New Forest pony, but today only ponies whose parents are both registered as purebred in the approved section of the stud book may be registered as purebred. The New Forest pony can be ridden by children and adults, can be driven in harness, and competes successfully against larger horses in horse show competition.

All ponies grazing on the New Forest are owned by New Forest commoners – people who have &quot;rights of common of pasture&quot; over the Forest lands. An annual marking fee is paid for each animal turned out to graze. The population of ponies on the Forest has fluctuated in response to varying demand for young stock. Numbers fell to fewer than six hundred in 1945, but have since risen steadily, and thousands now run loose in semi-feral conditions. The welfare of ponies grazing on the Forest is monitored by five Agisters, employees of the Verderers of the New Forest. Each Agister takes responsibility for a different area of the Forest. The ponies are gathered annually in a series of drifts, to be checked for health, wormed, and tail-marked; each pony&#x27;s tail is trimmed to the pattern of the Agister responsible for that pony. Purebred New Forest stallions approved by the Breed Society and by the New Forest Verderers run out on the Forest with the mares for a short period each year. Many of the foals bred on the Forest are sold through the Beaulieu Road pony sales, which are held several times each year.

== Characteristics ==
Standards for the breed are stipulated by the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society. The maximum height allowed is . Although there is no minimum height standard, in practice New Forest ponies are seldom less than . In shows, they normally are classed in two sections: competition height A, and under; and competition height B, over . New Forest ponies should be of riding type, workmanlike, and strong in conformation, with a sloping shoulder and powerful hindquarters; the body should be deep, and the legs straight with strong, flat bone, and hard, rounded hooves. Larger ponies, although narrow enough in the barrel for small children to ride comfortably, are also capable of carrying adults. Smaller ponies may not be suitable for heavier riders, but they often have more show quality. The New Forest pony has free, even gaits, active and straight, but not exaggerated, and is noted for sure-footedness, agility, and speed.

The ponies are most commonly bay, chestnut, or grey. Few coat colours are excluded: piebald, skewbald, and blue-eyed cream are not allowed; palomino and very light chestnut are only accepted by the stud book as geldings and mares. Blue eyes are never accepted. White markings on the head and lower legs are allowed, unless they appear behind the head, above the point of the hock in the hind leg, or above the metacarpal bone at the bend in the knee in the foreleg. Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the purebred section of the stud book, but are recorded in the appendix, known as the X-register. The offspring of these animals may not be registered as purebred New Forest ponies, as the stud book is closed and only the offspring of purebred-approved registered ponies may be registered as purebred.

New Forest ponies have a gentle temperament and a reputation for intelligence, strength, and versatility. On the whole, they are a sturdy and hardy breed. The one known hereditary genetic disorder found in the breed is congenital myotonia, a muscular condition also found in humans, dogs, cats, and goats. It was identified in the Netherlands in 2009, after a clinically affected foal was presented to the Equine Clinic of Utrecht University. DNA sequencing revealed that the affected foal was homozygous for a missense mutation in the gene encoding CLCN1, a protein which regulates the excitability of the skeletal muscle. The mutated allele was found in both the foal&#x27;s parents, its siblings, and two other related animals, none of whom exhibited any clinical signs. The researchers concluded that the condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, whereby both parents have to contribute the mutated allele for a physically affected foal to be produced with that phenotype. The study suggested that the mutation was of relatively recent origin: the founder of the mutated gene, as all the ponies who tested positive for the mutation are direct descendants of this stallion. The probable founder stallion has been identified as Kantje&#x27;s Ronaldo; testing is now underway to identify which of his offspring carry the mutated gene. All carriers will be removed from the breeding section of the New Forest Pony Breeding &amp; Cattle Society&#x27;s stud book, and all New Forest stallions licensed in the UK also will be tested, whether or not they descend from Kantje&#x27;s Ronaldo, to cover the possibility that the mutated gene may have appeared earlier in the pedigree, although it is believed that the mutated gene has now been eradicated from the British breeding stock. All breeding stock imported to the UK also will be tested.

== History ==

Ponies have grazed in the area of the New Forest for many thousands of years, predating the last Ice Age. Spear damage on a horse shoulder bone discovered at Eartham Pit, Boxgrove (about from the heart of the modern New Forest), dated 500,000 BC, demonstrates that early humans were hunting horses in the area at that time, and the remains of a large Ice Age hunting camp have been found close to Ringwood (on the western border of the modern New Forest). Evidence from the skeletal remains of ponies from the Bronze Age suggests that they resembled the modern Exmoor pony. Horse bones excavated from Iron Age ritual burial sites at Danebury (about from the heart of the modern New Forest), indicate that the animals were approximately  – a height similar to that of some of the smaller New Forest ponies of today.

William the Conqueror, who claimed the New Forest as a royal hunting ground, shipped more than two thousand horses across the English Channel when he invaded England in 1066. The earliest written record of horses in the New Forest dates back to that time, when rights of common of pasture were granted to the area&#x27;s inhabitants. A popular tradition linking the ancestry of the New Forest pony to Spanish horses said to have swum ashore from wrecked ships at the time of the Spanish Armada has, according to the New Forest National Park Authority, &quot;long been accepted as a myth&quot;, however, the offspring of Forest mares, probably bred at the Royal Stud in Lyndhurst, were exported in 1507 for use in the Renaissance wars. A genetic study in 1998 suggested that the New Forest pony has ancient shared ancestry with two endangered Spanish Celtic-type pony breeds, the Asturcón and Pottok.

The most notable stallion in the early history of the breed was a Thoroughbred named Marske, the sire of Eclipse, and a great-grandson of the Darley Arabian. Marske was sold to a Ringwood farmer for 20 guineas on the death of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, and was used to breed with &quot;country mares&quot; in the 1760s.

In the 1850s and 1860s, the quality of the ponies was noted to be declining, a result of poor choice of breeding stallions, and the introduction of Arab to improve the breed was recommended. The census of stock of 1875 reported just under three thousand ponies grazing the Forest, and by 1884 the number had dropped to 2,250. Profits from the sale of young ponies affected the number of mares that commoners bred in subsequent years. The drop in numbers on the Forest may have been a consequence of introducing Arab blood to the breed in the 1870s, resulting in fewer animals suitable for use as pit ponies, or to the increase in the profits from running dairy cattle instead of ponies. The Arab blood may have reduced the ponies&#x27; natural landrace hardiness to thrive on the open Forest over winter. Numbers of ponies on the Forest also declined as a result of demand for more refined-looking ponies for riding and driving work prior to the introduction of motor vehicles. Later, the Second World War drove up the demand for, and thus, the market value of, young animals for horse meat.
Founded in 1891, the Society for the improvement of New Forest Ponies organised a stallion show and offered financial incentives to encourage owners of good stallions to run them on the Forest. In 1905 the Burley and District NF Pony Breeding and Cattle Society was set up to start the stud book and organise the Breed Show; the two societies merged in 1937 to form the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society. Overall numbers of livestock grazing the Forest, including ponies, tended to decline in the early twentieth century; in 1945 there were just 571 ponies depastured. By 1956 the number of ponies of all breeds on the Forest had more than doubled to 1,341. Twenty years later pony numbers were up to 3,589, rising to 4,112 in 1994, before dipping back below four thousand until 2005. As of 2011, there were 4,604 ponies grazing on the New Forest.

In 2014, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST) conservation charity watch-listed the New Forest pony in its &quot;minority breed&quot; category, given the presence of less than 3,000 breeding females in the forest. Over the course of five years, the number of foals born each year had dropped by two-thirds (from 1,563 to just 423 in 2013) – a change attributed by The New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society to a declining market, and by the New Forest Verderers to steps that had been taken to improve the quality rather than the quantity of foals.

For a variety of reasons, including normal trade in the area and attempts to improve the breed, Arabian, Thoroughbred, Welsh pony, and Hackney blood had been added to ponies in the New Forest. Over time, however, the better-quality ponies were sold off, leaving the poorer-quality and less hardy animals as the Forest breeding stock. To address this situation, as well as to increase the stock&#x27;s hardiness and restore native type, in the early twentieth century animals from other British native mountain and moorland pony breeds such as the Fell, Dales, Highland, Dartmoor, and Exmoor were introduced to the Forest. This practice ended in 1930, and since that time, only purebred New Forest stallions may be turned out. The New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society has been publishing the stud book since 1960. New Forest ponies have been exported to many parts of the world, including Canada, the U.S., Europe, and Australia, and many countries now have their own breed societies and stud books.

== Uses ==

In the past, smaller ponies were used as pit ponies. Today the New Forest pony and related crossbreeds are still the &quot;working pony of choice&quot; for local farmers and commoners, as their sure-footedness, agility, and sound sense will carry them (and their rider) safely across the varied and occasionally hazardous terrain of the open Forest, sometimes at great speed, during the autumn drifts. New Forest ponies also are used today for gymkhanas, show jumping, cross-country, dressage, driving, and eventing.

The ponies can carry adults and in many cases compete on equal terms with larger equines while doing so. For example, in 2010, the New Forest Pony Enthusiasts Club (NFPEC), a registered riding club whose members compete only on purebred registered New Forest ponies, won the Quadrille competition at the London International Horse Show at Olympia. This was a significant win, as the British Riding Clubs Quadrille is a national competition, with only four teams from the whole of Britain selected to compete at the National Final.
== Ponies on the New Forest ==
The ponies grazing the New Forest are considered to be iconic. They, together with the cattle, donkeys, pigs, and sheep owned by commoners&#x27; (local people with common grazing rights), are called &quot;the architects of the Forest&quot;: it is the grazing and browsing of the commoners&#x27; animals over a thousand years which created the New Forest ecosystem as it is today.

The cattle and ponies living on the New Forest are not completely feral, but are owned by commoners, who pay an annual fee for each animal turned out. The animals are looked after by their owners and by the Agisters employed by the Verderers of the New Forest. The Verderers are a statutory body with ancient roots, who share management of the forest with the Forestry Commission and National park authority. Approximately 80 per cent of the animals depastured on the New Forest are owned by just 10 per cent of the commoning families.

Ponies living full-time on the New Forest are almost all mares, although there are also a few geldings. For much of the year the ponies live in small groups, usually consisting of an older mare, her daughters, and their foals, all keeping to a discrete area of the Forest called a &quot;haunt.&quot; Under New Forest regulations, mares and geldings may be of any breed. Although the ponies are predominantly New Foresters, other breeds such as Shetlands and their crossbred descendants may be found in some areas.

Stallions must be registered New Foresters, and are not allowed to run free all year round on the Forest. They normally are turned out only for a limited period in the spring and summer, when they gather several groups of mares and youngstock into larger herds and defend them against other stallions. A small number (usually fewer than 50) are turned out, generally between May and August. This ensures that foals are born neither too early (before the spring grass is coming through), nor too late (as the colder weather is setting in and the grazing and browsing on the Forest is dying back) in the following year.

Colts are assessed as two-year-olds by the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society for suitability to be kept as stallions; any animal failing the assessment must be gelded. Once approved, every spring (usually in March), the stallions must pass the Verderers&#x27; assessment before they are permitted onto the Forest to breed. The stallion scheme resulted in a reduction of genetic diversity in the ponies running out on the New Forest, and to counteract this and preserve the hardiness of Forest-run ponies, the Verderers introduced the Bloodline Diversity Project, which will use hardy Forest-run mares, mostly over eleven years old, bred to stallions that have not been run out on the Forest, or closely related to those that have.
Drifts to gather the animals are carried out in autumn. Most colts and some fillies are removed, along with any animals considered too &quot;poor&quot; to remain on the Forest over the winter. The remaining fillies are branded with their owner&#x27;s mark, and many animals are wormed. Many owners choose to remove a number of animals from the Forest for the winter, turning them out again the following spring. Animals surplus to their owner&#x27;s requirements often are sold at the Beaulieu Road Pony Sales, run by the New Forest Livestock Society. Tail hair of the ponies is trimmed, and cut into a recognisable pattern to show that the pony&#x27;s grazing fees have been paid for the year. Each Agister has his own &quot;tail-mark&quot;, indicating the area of the Forest where the owner lives. The Agisters keep a constant watch over the condition of the Forest-running stock, and an animal may be &quot;ordered off&quot; the Forest at any time. The rest of the year, the lives of the ponies are relatively unhindered unless they need veterinary attention or additional feeding, when they are usually taken off the Forest.

The open nature of the New Forest means that ponies are able to wander onto roads. The ponies actually have right of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars in an effort to reduce traffic fatalities, but despite this, many ponies, along with commoners&#x27; cattle, pigs, and donkeys are killed or injured in road traffic accidents every year. Human interaction with ponies is also a problem; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them, which can create dietary problems and sickness (e.g. colic) and cause the ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food.

New Forest ponies are raced in an annual point to point meeting in the Forest, usually on Boxing Day, finishing at a different place each year. The races do not have a fixed course, but instead are run across the open Forest, so competitors choose their own routes around obstructions such as inclosures (forestry plantations), fenced paddocks, and bogs. Riders with a detailed knowledge of the Forest are thus at an advantage. The location of the meeting place is given to competitors on the previous evening, and the starting point of the race is revealed once riders have arrived at the meeting point.

<text>Harvey Lonsdale Elmes (10 February 1814 – 26 November 1847) was an English architect, the designer of St George&#x27;s Hall, Liverpool.

==Life==
The son of the architect, James Elmes, he was born in Chichester. After serving some time in his father&#x27;s office, and under a surveyor at Bedford and an architect (Henry Goodridge) at Bath, Elmes became partner with his father in 1835.

One of the first buildings Elmes designed was 10-12 Queen Anne&#x27;s Gate, Westminster, London, for Charles Pearson, the City Solicitor. In July, 1839, he was successful among 86 competitors for a design for St George&#x27;s Hall, Liverpool. The foundation stone of this building had been laid on 28 June 1838, but, Elmes being successful in a competition for the Assize Courts in the same city, it was finally decided to include the hall and courts in a single building. Consequently, Elmes prepared a fresh design, and construction work commenced in 1841. He superintended its progress until 1847, when because of failing health, he was compelled to delegate his duties to John Weightman (City Surveyor) and Robert Rawlinson (Structural Engineer) and leave for Jamaica, where he died of consumption on 26 November 1847. Charles Robert Cockerell took over supervision of the project in 1851.

<text>Frank Laurence Lucas (28 December 1894 – 1 June 1967) was an English classical scholar, literary critic, poet, novelist, playwright, political polemicist, Fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and intelligence officer at Bletchley Park during World War II.

He is now best remembered for his scathing 1923 review of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, and for his book &quot;Style&quot; (1955; revised 1962), an acclaimed guide to recognising and writing good prose. His &quot;Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle&#x27;s &#x27;Poetics&#x27;&quot; (1927, substantially revised 1957) was for over fifty years a standard introduction. His most important contribution to scholarship was his four-volume old-spelling &quot;Complete Works of John Webster&quot; (1927), the first collected edition of the Jacobean dramatist since that of Hazlitt the Younger (1857), itself an inferior copy of Dyce (1830). Eliot called Lucas &quot;the perfect annotator&quot;, and subsequent Webster scholars have been indebted to him, notably the editors of the new Cambridge Webster (1995–2019).

Lucas is also remembered for his anti-fascist campaign in the 1930s, and for his wartime work at Bletchley Park, for which he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

==Life==

===Early life and the War===
F. L. (&quot;Peter&quot;) Lucas grew up in Blackheath and was educated at Colfe&#x27;s (1902–1909), where his father F. W. Lucas (1860–1931) was headmaster, and from 1910 at Rugby, where he was tutored by the Sophocles scholar Robert Whitelaw (1843–1917) in his last year before retirement. He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1913 to read for the Classical Tripos, adding the Pitt Scholarship and Porson Prize in 1914. In January 1914 he was elected Apostle – the last Apostle elected before the War – coming under the influence of G. E. Moore. Believing Cambridge threatened with the fate of Louvain, he volunteered, aged 19, in October 1914 and was commissioned in November, serving from 1915 as second lieutenant in the 7th Battalion The Royal West Kent Regiment in France. From August 1915 he was in the Somme trenches opposite Fricourt and Mametz; he was wounded by shrapnel in May 1916. &quot;One simply gapes at the gigantic capriciousness of things,&quot; he wrote to John Maynard Keynes in October of that year, &quot;waiting our own turn to disappear in the Cyclops&#x27; maw.&quot; He returned to the front as lieutenant in January 1917, went into battle near Grandcourt on 17 February in the Ancre Offensive, was mentioned in despatches on 22 February, and was gassed on 4 March. In all he spent seventeen months in war-hospitals. By September 1917 he felt that the cause of honour and justice had been lost in the lust of Victory (&quot;We were too ready to go on fighting without offering terms&quot;). Passed fit for garrison duty at Chatham (3rd Battalion Royal West Kent HQ), he sought the help of fellow-Apostle Keynes to return to France, and from August 1918 to the Armistice he was Staff lieutenant in the Intelligence Corps (Third Army HQ), examining German prisoners near Bapaume and Le Quesnoy. His life hung in the balance in November 1918 shortly after the Armistice, when his lung wounds reopened in the influenza pandemic. He returned to Cambridge in January 1919. Fell-walking in the Lake District &quot;on Easter morning [1919] on Kidsty Pike, between Hawes Water and Hayes Water, a blinding spring sun on snowy ridge beyond ridge, from Fairfield to Blucathra, brought a moment of such ecstatic intoxication that, were I a mystic, I should have called it a mystical experience.&quot;

===Career===
Resuming his undergraduate studies, Lucas won a Chancellor&#x27;s Medal for Classics and the Browne Medal (1920), and revived meetings of the Apostles, suspended since 1914, becoming Society Secretary and contributing nineteen papers. He was elected to a Fellowship at King&#x27;s College in 1920 before he had completed his degree, Keynes paying for him to holiday in Greece with Sebastian Sprott on the eve of his Tripos. He took a starred first and began his career as a Classics lecturer in October 1920. In the spring of 1921 he spent three months in Greece as a student of the British School at Athens, locating the site of the Battle of Pharsalus in Thessaly (see Pharsalus below). Back in Cambridge he switched that year to teaching for the English Tripos (instituted in 1919). He was a member of the Cambridge University English Faculty from 1921 to 1939 and from 1945 to 1962, and a university Reader in English from 1947 to 1962. At the invitation of Desmond MacCarthy, literary editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Lucas reviewed poetry and criticism for that journal from 1922 to 1926, having begun his career as reviewer with the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; in 1920–21, its last year. Early reviews and essays were collected in his &quot;Authors Dead and Living&quot; (1926). Among them was a review of Housman&#x27;s &quot;Last Poems&quot; (1922) that, unusually, met with the approval of the poet himself. His move from Classics to English and his edition of Webster (1927) were inspired in large part by J. T. Sheppard&#x27;s March 1920 Marlowe Society production of &quot;The White Devil&quot;, which made a powerful impression on him: &quot;What could make the Cambridge production of &quot;The White Devil&quot; in 1920 seem, to at least two who saw it then without preconceptions, the most staggering performance they had ever known?&quot; he asked in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. (The production had been swift-moving, in the Elizabethan manner, with minimal scenery and with emphasis on &quot;beautiful poetry beautifully spoken&quot;.) &quot;[Lucas] has been lucky in finding a writer [Webster] who takes his standpoint,&quot; T. E. Lawrence remarked, &quot;and sums up life rather in his fashion.&quot; Lucas&#x27; preference, however, lay with Comparative Literature, and after Webster he turned to his &quot;Studies French and English&quot; (1934; revised 1950) (he was &quot;Membre Correspondant Honoraire de L&#x27;Institut Littéraire et Artistique de France&quot;), and later to studies of Scandinavian literature. He served as committee member for the Cambridge Greek Play (1921–33) and continued to write on Greek and Latin literature. As part-time Librarian at King&#x27;s (1922–36) he accessioned the donated papers of Rupert Brooke. His students at King&#x27;s included George Rylands, John Hayward, F. E. Halliday, H. C. A. &quot;Tom&quot; Gaunt, Alan Clutton-Brock, Julian Bell, Winton Dean and Desmond Flower. By Cambridge English students in general he was known as &quot;F. L.&quot;. 
Following the publication of his Webster, scholars turned to him for editorial advice: he helped in the preparation of Hayward&#x27;s Nonesuch &quot;Donne&quot; (1929), Housman&#x27;s &quot;More Poems&quot; (1936), Theodore Redpath&#x27;s &quot;Songs and Sonets of John Donne&quot; (1956), and Ingram and Redpath&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot; (1964). He also performed an editorial and advisory role for Christopher Sandford at the Golden Cockerel Press, where he introduced Victor Scholderer&#x27;s New Hellenic typeface (1937). Four of his verse translations from Greek and Latin, with engravings by John Buckland Wright, were published in collectors&#x27; editions by the Golden Cockerel Press and Folio Society. In the middle years of his career he was in demand as an invitation lecturer, giving seven BBC wireless talks in 1930, on Dorothy Osborne and on the Victorian Poets, delivering the 1933 Warton Lecture on English Poetry to the British Academy, lecturing at the Royal Institution on Classicism and Romanticism (1935) and at the Royal Society of Literature on travel writing (1937), and, as part of a British Council drive to counter Soviet propaganda, lecturing in German on European literature to packed halls at the British Information Centre in West Berlin in October 1948 during the Berlin Blockade.

In later years Lucas won acclaim for his translations from the classics (see Verse translation below) and for his book &quot;Style&quot; (1955). He also turned encyclopedist, contributing articles on &#x27;Poetry&#x27;, &#x27;Epic&#x27;, &#x27;Lyric&#x27;, &#x27;Ode&#x27;, &#x27;Elegy&#x27; and &#x27;Pastoral&#x27; to the 15-volume 1950 &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot;, among others, and serving on the editorial board of the Encyclopædia Britannica&#x27;s &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; series (1952). As he told Nikos Kazantzakis, who visited him in Cambridge after the War, &quot;Je ne lis plus; je relis&quot; [:I no longer read; I reread].

===Personal life===
From February 1921 to 1929 Lucas was married to the novelist E. B. C. Jones (1893–1966), known as &quot;Topsy&quot; to her friends. She was the sister-in-law of his former supervisor at Trinity, Donald Robertson; he got to know her after reading and admiring her first novel, &quot;Quiet Interior&quot; (1920). Jones dedicated two novels to Lucas and based two characters on him – Hugh Sexton, gassed in the War, in &quot;The Singing Captives&quot; (1922), and Oliver in &quot;The Wedgwood Medallion&quot; (1923), a Cambridge classics graduate now studying the Elizabethan drama. Lucas based the character Margaret Osborne in &quot;The River Flows&quot; (1926) on her – a semi-autobiographical first novel that shifts some of his experiences of 1919–1920 to 1913–1915. The character Hugh Fawcett (&quot;the best brain in the Foreign Office&quot; but not much use as a matchmaker) was based on Keynes. Through the Apostles Lucas was associated with the Bloomsbury Group, Virginia Woolf describing him to Ottoline Morrell as &quot;pure Cambridge: clean as a breadknife, and as sharp&quot;. To Lucas, interviewed in 1958, Bloomsbury had seemed &quot;a jungle&quot;:

The society of Virginia and Leonard Woolf, Duncan Grant, Clive and Vanessa Bell, and Lytton Strachey was far from being in the ordinary sense a happy family. They were intensely and rudely critical of each other. They were the sort of people who would read letters addressed to others. They tormented each other with endless love affairs. In real crises they could be generous, but in ordinary affairs of life they were anything but kind ... Dickinson and Forster were not really Bloomsbury. They were soft-hearted and kind. Bloomsbury was certainly not that.
Jones&#x27;s admiration for George Rylands undermined the marriage by 1927. After affairs with Dora Carrington (d. 1932) and Shelagh Clutton-Brock (d. 1936), in December 1932 Lucas married the 21-year-old Girton Classics graduate and sculptor Prudence Wilkinson (1911–1944). His travel writings, accounts of their long walks through landscapes with literary associations, date from the years of his second marriage (1932–1939): &quot;From Olympus to the Styx&quot; (1934), a book on their 1933 walking tour of Greece (one of five journeys he made to that country); &#x27;Iceland&#x27;, a travelogue on their 1934 journey to the saga sites, included in the original edition of his &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Romantic Ideal&quot; (1936); and journal-entries on their visits to Norway, Ireland, Scotland and France. In these years they were frequent visitors to the home in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence of Marie Mauron, whose Provençal stories Lucas translated. &quot;From Olympus to the Styx&quot; argues for the return of the Elgin Marbles:
Considering what was to come, the much-abused &#x27;theft&#x27; of the sculptures from the Acropolis by Lord Elgin was an undoubted blessing, though it was carelessly carried out, especially in removing the Caryatid from the Erechtheum; it would none the less be a graceful act for England to return them now to Athens.
Prudence Lucas, as well as sharing these interests, designed the costumes and sets for the first production (1938) of his Icelandic tragedy &quot;The Lovers of Gudrun&quot; (1935). Her nervous breakdown in 1938 is touched on in Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Journal Under the Terror, 1938&quot; (1939); Lucas sought help from, among others, Wilhelm Stekel, whom he met in London in 1939, but the rift proved irreparable. The emphasis on psychology in his post-war books – &quot;Literature and Psychology&quot; (1951), &quot;Style&quot; (1955), &quot;The Search for Good Sense&quot; (1958), &quot;The Art of Living&quot; (1959), the essay on &#x27;Happiness&#x27; in &quot;The Greatest Problem&quot; (1960), &quot;The Drama of Ibsen and Strindberg&quot; (1962) – reflects an interest shared with his third wife (1940–1967), the Swedish psychologist Elna Kallenberg (1906–2003), whom he married in 1940 – &quot;the stranger who came to me from beyond the sea when I most needed her&quot; (Elna Kallenberg, a friend of Hilda Stekel, had flown from Sweden, with special permission from the Home Office, to join him in late 1939). They had two children, Signe and Sigurd.

Lucas returned time and again in his books to the theme of happiness, and in 1960 summed up his thoughts on happiness thus:Vitality of mind and body; the activity to employ and maintain them; the zest and curiosity that they can animate; freedom to travel widely in nature and art, in countries of the world and countries of the mind; human affections; and the gift of gaiety – these seem to me, then, the main causes of happiness. I am surprised to find how few and simple they are.

Lucas lived at 7 Camden Place, Cambridge, from 1921 to 1925; at 20 West Road, Cambridge from 1925 to 1939; at High Mead, Great Brickhill from 1939 to 1945; and again at 20 West Road, Cambridge, from 1945 until his death in 1967. The dissident Czech academic Otakar Vočadlo (1895–1974), Lucas&#x27;s Prague correspondent in 1938–39 (see Appeasement below) and a concentration camp survivor, celebrated his restoration, during the Prague Spring of 1968, to his Chair of English at Prague, by giving a course of lectures on Webster in memory of Lucas, whose support for the Czech cause in 1938–39 had not been forgotten.

D. W. Lucas, the classical scholar (1905–85), Fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, University Director of Studies in Classics, and Perceval Maitland Laurence Reader in Classics, was F. L. Lucas&#x27;s brother.

==Literary criticism==

===Approach===
Except in reviews of work by contemporaries, Lucas adopted the historical and biographical approach to criticism and examined the views of earlier critics, whose dogmatism he was swift to rebut. He increasingly linked his studies to developments in psychology, notably in &quot;Literature and Psychology&quot; (1951). &quot;The real &#x27;unwritten laws&#x27;,&quot; he observed, &quot;seem to me those of human psychology.&quot; Centrally, he discussed the writer&#x27;s psychology as revealed through style. &quot;Even science,&quot; he noted, &quot;has invented no pickle for embalming a man like &quot;style&quot;.&quot;

The poets to whom he returned most often in publications were Tennyson (1930, 1932, 1947, 1957) and Housman (1926, 1933, 1936, 1960), but he ranged widely over Classical, European and English literature. Conscious that books can influence for good or ill, he admired authors he saw as defenders of sanity and good sense – men like Montaigne and Montesquieu – or as compassionate realists, like Homer in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Euripides, Hardy, Ibsen and Chekhov. &quot;Life is &#x27;indivisible&#x27;,&quot; he wrote.
:&quot;A public tends to get the literature it deserves: a literature, to get the public it deserves. The values men pursue in each, affect the other. They turn in a vicious, or a virtuous, circle. Only a fine society could have bred Homer: and he left it finer for hearing him.&quot;
His criticism, while acknowledging that morality is historically relative, was thus values-based. &quot;Writers can make men &quot;feel&quot;, not merely see, the values that endure.&quot; Believing that too many modern writers encouraged men and women to flee to unreason, decadence and barbarism, he condemned the &quot;trahisons des clercs&quot; of the twentieth century, and used his lectures and writing to campaign for a responsible use of intellectual freedom. &quot;One may question whether real civilisation is so safely afloat,&quot; he wrote in his last published letter (1966), &quot;that we can afford to use our pens for boring holes in the bottom of it.&quot; The writer or artist serving up &quot;slapdash nightmares out of his Unconscious&quot;, &quot;in an age morbidly avid of uncivilised irreticence&quot;, not only exhibited his own neuroses, but fed neurosis in others. Literary critics, too, had to take more responsibility. &quot;Much cant gets talked,&quot; he noted of the Structuralists, &quot;by critics who care more for the form and organisation of a work than for its spirit, its content, its supreme moments.&quot; The serious note in his criticism was counterbalanced by wit and urbanity, by lively anecdote and quotation, and by a gift for startling imagery and epigram.

What Lucas wrote about Housman&#x27;s &quot;Name and Nature of Poetry&quot; in 1933 (though he contested some of its ideas) sums up what he himself aspired to as a literary critic: &quot;… the kind of critical writing that best justifies itself before the brevity of life; that itself adds new data to our experience as well as arguing about the old; that happily combines, in a word, philosophy with autobiography, psychology with a touch of poetry – of the &#x27;poetic&#x27; imagination. It can make acceptable even common sense. There are sentences here which recall the clear-cut Doric strength of the &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot; ...&quot;

His Cambridge colleague T. R. Henn noted that Lucas&#x27;s approach and style were influenced by the Strachey of &quot;Books and Characters&quot; (1922).

===Controversy===
Lucas&#x27;s impatience with the &quot;obscurantism&quot; and coterie-appeal of much modern poetry made him in the interwar years one of the foremost opponents of the new schools. &quot;As for &#x27;profundity&#x27;,&quot; he wrote, &quot;it is not uncommonly found also in dry wells; which may likewise contain little but obscurity and rubbish.&quot; He opposed also what he saw as the narrow dogmatism of the New Critics, those &quot;tight-lipped Calvins of art&quot;, as he called them, of &quot;Criterion&quot; and &quot;Scrutiny&quot;. Discussions of I. A. Richards&#x27;s criticism appear in his essay &#x27;English Literature&#x27; in the volume &quot;University Studies: Cambridge 1933&quot; and in Chapter 4 of his &quot;Decline and Fall of the Romantic Ideal&quot; (1936), and of Eliot&#x27;s in the 1929 essay &#x27;Modern Criticism&#x27;, reprinted in his &quot;Studies French and English&quot; (1934). An anonymous &quot;New Statesman&quot; review (29 December 1928) of Eliot&#x27;s criticism, however, to which F. R. Leavis replied apparently believing it was by Lucas, and which Leavis&#x27;s biographer says &quot;was certainly by Lucas&quot;, was in fact by Richard Ellis Roberts. Lucas had stopped reviewing for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 1926 and never reviewed anonymously. His critique of Q. D. Leavis&#x27;s &quot;Fiction and the Reading Public&quot; (1932) in &quot;University Studies: Cambridge 1933&quot; was described by F. R. Leavis&#x27;s biographer as &quot;improper&quot;: &quot;senior academics do not use quasi-official publications to attack graduate students&quot;. (The volume, though printed by the University Press, was not published there; its editor stressed that the contributions were &quot;unofficial&quot; glimpses into the &quot;intense mental activity&quot; of each Cambridge department; and published theses are not normally considered exempt from criticism.)

===Lucas and Eliot===
Lucas&#x27;s 1923 review of &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, much reprinted in the decades since his death, was omitted from his &quot;Authors Dead and Living&quot; (1926), a collection of &quot;New Statesman&quot; pieces, probably because he had ended by saying the poem should be left to sink. Remarks elsewhere confirm that he had not changed his opinion. Described by F. W. Bateson as &quot;brilliantly wrong-headed&quot;, the review is better known today than it was during Lucas&#x27;s lifetime. His only other comment on the poem occurs in his essay &#x27;English Literature&#x27; in the volume &quot;University Studies: Cambridge 1933&quot;, where he contested I. A. Richards&#x27; view of it in &quot;Science and Poetry&quot; (1926): &quot;&quot;The Waste Land&quot; is praised [by Richards] for its &#x27;complete severence&#x27; from &quot;all&quot; beliefs, when it is really a yearning cry for them, and at its close some sort of faith is so clearly impending that it has been praised by others as a great religious poem (such are the triumphs of obscurity).&quot; &quot;The Letters of T. S. Eliot&quot; includes correspondence between Eliot and Lucas from the mid-1920s but no reference to the review. Historians of &quot;The New Statesman&quot; have regretted that Desmond MacCarthy invited Lucas to review modern poetry, one of them declaring Lucas &quot;a disastrous choice&quot; for a &quot;Waste Land&quot; review. (Disastrous, that is, for the journal&#x27;s avant-garde image.) After 1923, though attacking obscurantism in general terms, Lucas largely ignored Eliot&#x27;s poetry, aside from a retrospective dig in 1942 at &#x27;The Hollow Men&#x27; (&quot;hollow men whimpering under prickly pear trees, conceited still amid their grovellings because a prickly pear remains an exotic and highly intellectual plant&quot;) and at &#x27;Sweeney among the Nightingales&#x27; (&quot;the nightingales of Aeschylus now exhibit to a ravished public their &#x27;droppings&#x27;; for to the sewer all things are sewer&quot;). On the later Eliot he was silent. He had no time for mystical poetry, regarding religion as an aberration of the human mind.

In 1928 Lucas had been stung by Eliot&#x27;s review in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; criticising aspects of the Introduction to his &quot;Webster&quot;. He replied vigorously in the same journal, only to find Eliot extending his criticisms in another review in &quot;The Criterion&quot;. Lucas counter-attacked in his 1929 essay &#x27;Modern Criticism&#x27;, ridiculing Eliot&#x27;s literary-critical &quot;obiter dicta&quot; and oracular tone. In later editions of his essays, Eliot made minor changes or added clarifications to sentences Lucas had ridiculed, and praised the textual and historical scholarship of the 1927 &quot;Webster&quot;. Lucas left the Introduction out of his 1958 revised editions of the two major plays, but demand for the unabridged 1927 &quot;Webster&quot; continued, and it was reprinted on both sides of the Atlantic in 1966.

===Reputation===
Lucas&#x27;s standing as a literary critic was probably at its highest in the 1930s. &quot;In three respects,&quot; wrote the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; in 1934, &quot;Lucas rises pre-eminent from the crowd of contemporary critics: in his care for style, for dignity and grace in his method of presentment: in his learning in the literature of several languages: and in the balance, the sanity of his judgment.&quot; Post-war, reviewers were often more hostile. Many post-war reviews amounted to reprisals by the Leavisite camp: &quot;There is an air of breezy Bloomsbury superficiality and cultural omniscience about this book that is distressing,&quot; wrote one. &quot;His is the type of over-cultivated fuddy-duddy mind that has done – and is doing – great damage to our whole culture in general and to literary appreciation in particular.&quot; Probably because, psychoanalytic literary criticism aside, Lucas scorned most new trends – he described the critical theory of the 1950s as &quot;largely pseudo-scientific bubble-blowing&quot; – his criticism has long been out of fashion and is mostly out of print. 
&quot;The literary world has passed on,&quot; wrote L. P. Wilkinson, &quot;but that does not mean that what supervened was better; and just because of his uncompromising brilliance the whirligig of time may bring in his criticism again. His &quot;Style&quot; (1955) has a permanent value in any case, unaffected by trends.&quot; His two earliest books, &quot;Seneca and Elizabethan Tragedy&quot; (1922) (his Fellowship dissertation) and &quot;Euripides and His Influence&quot; (1923), not yet superseded in similar concise form, continue to be reprinted. The editors of the new Cambridge Webster (1995–2007) praise &quot;his customary accuracy and astuteness&quot; in matters of dating, authorship, and textual scholarship. &quot;With its voluminous and marvellously wide-ranging notes,&quot; writes D. C. Gunby, &quot;Lucas&#x27;s four-volume, old-spelling edition remains essential reading for those who love scholarship and, more, love the plays of John Webster&quot;.

==Verse translation==

Lucas dedicated much of his time to making classical (mainly Greek) poetry accessible through verse translations. His companion volumes &quot;Greek Poetry for Everyman&quot; (1951) and &quot;Greek Drama for Everyman&quot; (1954) contain some 20,000 lines. No single translator had attempted before to bring together in homogeneous volumes so much of the best of Greek poetry from Homer to the 6th century A.D., with the introductions and notes needed by the non-classicist. The translations were praised for their grace and fidelity – &quot;the sense and the imagery are minutely reproduced&quot; – and were hailed by the press as Cambridge&#x27;s single-handed answer to the [collaborative] &quot;Oxford Book of Greek Verse in Translation&quot;. Reviewers of the first volume, &quot;Greek Poetry&quot;, generally preferred his translations of lyric, Alexandrian and later poetry to the 7,000 rhymed lines from Homer, which were omitted from the second edition (Everyman Library, 1966). Of the second volume, &quot;Greek Drama&quot;, a reviewer wrote: &quot;Lucas makes the plays deceptively easy to read and appreciate by smoothing away the austerities and complexities of the Greek – qualities which some modernists conscientiously preserve or even exaggerate.&quot; &quot;His translations have no striking originality of style,&quot; commented A. H. Coxon, &quot;but they are accurate, graceful, and dignified, and they have the merit of not veiling the Greek, so that for long stretches the poetic quality of the original shines through.&quot; The translation of &quot;Hippolytus&quot; remains in print in the Penguin selection, &quot;Eight Great Tragedies&quot;, ed. Sylvan Barnet. Lucas&#x27;s 1960 essay &#x27;Translation&#x27; sets out his guiding principles on the subject.

==Original writing==

===Novels===

Of Lucas&#x27;s novels the best received was &quot;Cécile&quot; (1930), a tale of love, society and politics in the France of 1775–1776. Lucas dedicated the book to T. E. Lawrence, a friend and admirer. He wrote two further historical novels, &quot;Doctor Dido&quot; (1938), set in Cambridge in 1792–1812, and &quot;The English Agent: A Tale of the Peninsular War&quot; (1969), set in Spain in 1808; and a novella, &quot;The Woman Clothed with the Sun&quot; (1937), on the Buchanites of the 1780s–90s. The three novels focus on a love-affair between an Englishman and a Frenchwoman (Lucas was a self-confessed &quot;gallomane&quot;); the Scots novella takes the form of an account, written by a Scottish minister in middle age, of his youthful bewitchment by Elspeth Buchan and of his curious sojourn among the Buchanites. A theme common to all four is the tension between fragile 18th-century rationalism and, in varying forms, Romantic &quot;enthusiasm&quot; and unreason. For his semi-autobiographical first novel, &quot;The River Flows&quot; (1926), see Personal Life above.

===Poems===
As a poet Lucas was a polished ironist. Early collections (&quot;Time and Memory&quot;, 1929, &quot;Marionettes&quot;, 1930, &quot;Poems, 1935&quot;) were mostly personal lyrics or satires, but he came to specialise in dramatic monologues and narrative poems based on historical episodes &quot;that seem lastingly alive&quot; (&quot;Messene Redeemed&quot;, 1940; &quot;From Many Times and Lands&quot;, 1953). His First World War poems, including &quot;Morituri&quot; – August 1915, on the road from Morlancourt&#x27; (1935) and (below) &#x27; &quot;The Night is Chilly but not Dark&quot; &#x27; (1935), offer a retrospect of his experiences at the front.

:On nights when the moon creeps shrouded up the sky
:And hedge and holt lie glimmering ghostly grey,
:A voice still whispers in me, far away –
:&quot;A good night, this, for wiring&quot; – and suddenly
:There rises from the dead that shadowy hell,
:The barbed-wire rasps, uncoiling through my hand,
:The flares dance flickering over no-man&#x27;s-land,
:A dull machine-gun raps from La Boisselle.
:Then fades the phantom, and once more I know
:Our spider-webs of wire are rust by now,
:Our battlefields reconquered by the plough,
:And hands that worked with mine, dust long ago.

The inclusion of &#x27;Beleaguered Cities&#x27; (1929) in various mid-twentieth century anthologies of English verse made it probably Lucas&#x27;s best-known poem. Others that have gained currency through anthologies include &#x27;The Destined Hour&#x27; (1953), a re-telling in verse of the old &#x27;appointment in Samarra&#x27; fable, and &#x27;Spain 1809&#x27;, the story of a village woman&#x27;s courage during the French occupation in the Peninsular War. The romantic lyric, &#x27;Her answer, in after years&#x27; (1935), is a nostalgic look back at his travels. His most ambitious poem was &quot;Ariadne&quot; (1932), an epic re-working, in the light of modern psychology, of the Labyrinth myth, with the Minotaur a sadistic Minos in a bull-mask. Extracts from the poem were read on the BBC Home Service in 1934.

===Plays===
Lucas&#x27;s most successful play was the thriller &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot; (1935), set in Cornwall in the mid-1930s (Westminster Theatre, February–March 1938, 29 performances, with Cathleen Nesbitt, Cecil Trouncer and Alan Napier among the cast). One of Paul Scofield&#x27;s earliest roles was in the Birmingham Rep&#x27;s revival of the play in March–April 1945. Lucas&#x27;s radio play &quot;The Siren&quot; was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme in 1948, with Catherine Lacey, Frith Banbury and Deryck Guyler in the cast; a second production followed on the Home Service in 1949, with Cathleen Nesbitt and Hugh Burden. The play dramatises George Sand&#x27;s amorous escapades in Paris and Italy with Alfred de Musset and Dr. Pietro Pagello – the subject of the 1999 film &quot;Les Enfants du Siècle&quot;. His political drama &quot;The Bear Dances: A Play in Three Acts&quot; was the first dramatisation of the Soviets on London&#x27;s West-end stage (Garrick Theatre, 1932, with Elena Miramova, Abraham Sofaer and Olga Lindo). This play, though it closed early in London, was revived by various repertory theatres in the North of England in the later 1930s. It was an attempt at ideological disinfectant, written at a time when Cambridge University (in Lucas&#x27;s words) &quot;grew full of very green young men going very Red&quot;.

==History, politics and society==

===Pharsalus===
Outside literature, Lucas is remembered for his solution to one of the more contentious problems of ancient topography. His &quot;north-bank&quot; thesis on the location of the Battle of Pharsalus (48 B.C.), based on his 1921 solo field-trip to Thessaly and on a re-examination of the sources, dismissed a dozen previous theories and is now widely accepted by historians. John D. Morgan in his definitive &#x27;Palae-pharsalus – the Battle and the Town&#x27; writes: &quot;My reconstruction is similar to Lucas&#x27;s, and in fact I borrow one of his alternatives for the line of the Pompeian retreat. Lucas&#x27;s theory has been subjected to many criticisms, but has remained essentially unshaken.&quot;

===Appeasement===

In the 1930s Lucas was widely known for his political letters to the British Press with their outspoken attacks on the policy that came to be known as appeasement. Following the inaction of the League over Manchuria, he called repeatedly for &quot;a League within the League&quot;, of nations pledged to uphold international law and oppose aggression. &quot;Since the War,&quot; he wrote in 1933, &quot;British policy has been shuffling, timid, ignoble.&quot; Having read &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; in the unexpurgated original and taken its threats as a statement of intent, he urged in September 1933 that Nazi Germany be prevented from re-arming. &quot;Versailles was monstrous&quot;, he wrote in &quot;The Week-end Review&quot;,
:&quot;but one thing surely comes first: Germany must not be allowed to re-arm. How prevent it? By an international police-force? It would be ideal. Unfortunately it does not exist. The French have urged it. We in our muddle-headedness want neither it nor the alternative – war. Are we prepared to see France do its work instead and take action in Germany? – or are we going to sit sanctimoniously on the fence, disapproving, but secretly relieved? I devoutly hope the first. Germany must not re-arm; even if the French had to invade it once every five years, that would be better than the alternative.&quot;
This letter struck some readers as &quot;brutal&quot;, and marked him as a hard-liner. The pro-appeasement &quot;Times&quot; refused to publish him after 1935 (he described the Editor&#x27;s office as &quot;an annexe of the German embassy&quot;); and when he condemned the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the democracies&#x27; inadequate response, he received abusive and threatening replies from Fascists, including one from Ezra Pound (he put Pound&#x27;s letter on display at the Cambridge Anti-Fascist Exhibition). In the years following he varied his arguments, but not their message. A hatred of war, he urged in 1936, &quot;can be no reason for being false to ourselves, in the name of an aimless amiability that cries &#x27;peace&#x27; where there is none.&quot; By 1937 the emphasis was on the dishonesty of British policy: &quot;We have not kept agreements we made; we have made agreements we should not; we have tried to cheat our way to security, and now the security proves a cheat. We have forgotten the wisdom which says that since we cannot foresee where any road will lead in the end, we should stick to the straight and honest one.&quot; Despite the prevailing pacifism of the time – and he exchanged views with &quot;passive pacifists&quot; in the correspondence-columns – such sentiments struck a chord. &quot;This is the voice of the England I love,&quot; wrote a correspondent from Prague in 1938, &quot;and for whose soul I was trembling when I heard about the welcome given Mr Chamberlain on his return from Munich.&quot;
As well as letters to the press (some forty in all, most to &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; – see Political letters below) his campaign included satires, articles, books, public speaking, fund-raising for the Red Cross, petitions to Parliament, meetings with émigrés like Haile Selassie and Stefan Zweig, and help for refugees. In these activities he was inspired by the example of &quot;that grand old man&quot; H. W. Nevinson, &quot;one of the most striking personalities I have ever known&quot;, &quot;whose long life has been given to Liberty&quot;. He dedicated his 1938 book &quot;The Delights of Dictatorship&quot; to Nevinson, by then a friend.

Believing that future readers would be interested in what it had been like to live through such times, Lucas kept and published in mid-1939 a
diary for 1938, &quot;Journal Under the Terror, 1938&quot;. (The &quot;high source&quot; he refers to in &quot;Journal&quot; was probably Harold Nicolson.) &quot;Journal&quot; is notable for its candid remarks on pro-Nazi and pro-appeasement figures in the British Establishment. Of Chamberlain at Munich he wrote (30 September):
:&quot;Even if what he did were the right thing to do, this was not the way to do it.&quot; &quot;The surrender &quot;might&quot; have been necessary: the cant was not. Any statesman with a sense of honour would at least have stilled that hysterical cheering and said: &quot;My friends, for the present, we are out of danger. But remember that others, who trusted in us, are not. This is a day for relief, perhaps; but for sorrow also; for shame, not for revelling.&quot; But this Chamberlain comes home beaming as fatuously as some country-cousin whom a couple of card-sharpers in the train have just allowed to win sixpence, to encourage him.&quot;

The outcome he feared was an Anglo-German peace agreement – an accord between Nazis and the British Establishment: &quot;One day a little note from Berchtesgaden will appoint Lord Londonderry to 10 Downing Street. And that will settle everything.&quot; Though he welcomed the Government&#x27;s about-turn on appeasement in March 1939, he doubted the genuineness of the conversion. &quot;The noble lords of our Fifth Column still go marching on.&quot; 
The Nazis had noted Lucas&#x27;s letters. In August 1939 he received a reply from Goebbels, advising him to heed public opinion. As a leading anti-fascist campaigner, he was placed by the Nazis on their &quot;Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.&quot; [:&quot;Special Search List G.B.&quot;] of Britons to be arrested and liquidated.

===Bletchley Park===

A brilliant linguist with infantry and Intelligence Corps experience from 1914 to 1918, proven anti-fascist credentials and a scepticism about the Soviet Union, Lucas was one of the first academics recruited by the Foreign Office – on 3 September 1939 – to Bletchley Park. He was one of the original four members of Hut 3, whose organisation he set up, and from March to July 1942, when the Hut was run by committee, acting head. He remained a central figure there, working throughout the war on the Enigma decodes as translator, intelligence-analyst and (from July 1942) head of the Research Section, &quot;3G&quot; [:Hut 3 General Intelligence], on the busy 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. shift. His main activities in &quot;3G&quot; were cracking Axis covernames and covernumbers in decodes, analysing German &quot;proformas&quot; (supplies and ammunition returns), and writing general intelligence papers.

Among the intelligence-reports he produced was a study of Hitler&#x27;s intentions in the east in May 1941, which contrasted with the Foreign Office view that the Germans were just &quot;building up pressure [on the U.S.S.R.] to extract more raw materials&quot;. &quot;It becomes harder than ever to doubt,&quot; Lucas wrote,
:&quot;that the object of these large movements of the German Army and Air Force is Russia. From rail movements towards Moldavia in the south to ship movements towards Varanger fjord in the far north there is everywhere the same eastward trend. Either the purpose is blackmail or it is war. No doubt Hitler would prefer a bloodless surrender. But the quiet move, for instance, of a prisoner-of-war cage to Tarnow looks more like business than bluff.&quot;

Other Lucas papers ranged from practical suggestions, such as the proposal that the Salonica-Athens railway be cut in the Oeta gorges viaducts (carried out in Operation Harling), to psychological overviews later in the war, like &#x27;Hitler as seen by Source&#x27; [:through decodes] and &#x27;German Morale as seen by Source&#x27; (his old special subject from 1918 Intelligence Corps days).
He also wrote confidential Special Reports for the Bletchley Park Director-General, one on Second Front rumours in German signals, and another, with Peter Calvocoressi, in late 1944 on Ultra and the failure of Allied intelligence to foresee the German counter-offensive through the Ardennes in December 1944. Lucas and Calvocoressi concluded &quot;the costly reverse might have been avoided if Ultra had been more carefully considered&quot;. For its part, Hut 3 had grown &quot;shy of going beyond its job of amending and explaining German messages&quot;, believing that &quot;drawing broad conclusions was for the intelligence staff at SHAEF, who had information from all sources&quot;, including aerial reconnaissance. E. J. N. Rose, head Air Adviser in Hut 3, read the paper at the time and described it in 1998 as &quot;an extremely good report&quot; that &quot;showed the failure of intelligence at SHAEF and at the Air Ministry&quot;. The report is not known to have survived. It was probably the &quot;Top Secret [intelligence] digest&quot;, a post-mortem on that failure, referred to by General Strong (1968), &quot;both record-copies of which were destroyed&quot;. (A report by &quot;C&quot;, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, &quot;On indications of German December 1944 counter-offensive in Ardennes, derived from ULTRA material, submitted to DMI by C&quot;, issued 28 December 1944, &quot;is&quot; held in the UK National Archives as file HW 13/45; Calvocoressi, however, who knew Bennett&#x27;s 1979 book and General Strong&#x27;s claim, stated in 2001 that the Lucas-Calvocoressi report was &quot;not&quot;.) Lucas and Calvocoressi &quot;expected heads to roll at Eisenhower&#x27;s HQ, but they did no more than wobble&quot;.

The most &quot;exciting&quot; work he did at Bletchley Park, he recalled, was handling operational signals on Axis convoys to North Africa from July 1941 and deducing convoys&#x27; routes using decrypts, maps, pins and pieces of string. The high standards of accuracy and clarity that prevailed in Hut 3, his chief maintained, were &quot;largely due to [Lucas&#x27;s] being such a stickler&quot; for them.

In out-of-hut hours Major Lucas was Officer Commanding the Bletchley Park Home Guard, a &quot;rabble of egg-heads&quot; that he turned, contrary to stereotype, into an efficient unit that outwitted the local regular forces in military exercises. He arranged the digging of defence positions to give code-breakers time to destroy papers should Bletchley Park come under attack. From June 1945 to the end of the War he was head of the Hut 3 History Section, compiling a &#x27;History of Hut 3&#x27;, now documents HW3/119 and HW3/120 in the National Archives. He was awarded the OBE in 1946 for his wartime work.

===Demographics===
In later years Lucas took up the cause of population-control, &quot;a problem not talked about nearly enough&quot;, discussing the dangers of world overpopulation in &quot;The Greatest Problem&quot; (1960). Having laid out the statistics to 1959 and future projections, he argued that the &quot;reckless proliferation&quot; of &quot;homo sapiens&quot;, as well as impoverishing the world by environmental damage and species-extinctions, would be damaging to the individual and to society:
:&quot;The finest human qualities are endangered, because the size of populations increases, and ought to be diminished; the size of states increases, and ought to be diminished; the size of cities increases, and ought to be diminished. Vast communities lead to small individuals; and the real worth of any community lies in the worth of its individuals... The individual comes to feel himself a mere drop in the ocean; and feeling impotent, he grows irresponsible... Vast democracies cannot keep the virtues of democracy.&quot;

If population-growth went unchecked, he felt, &quot;the damage to national efficiency might drive governments to act more intelligently&quot;; but better would be &quot;a concentrated drive for population-planning, despite the formidable practical, scientific and psychological obstacles&quot;. &quot;Far more, however,&quot; he added, &quot;depends on the individual and his power to realise his own plight. Hence the need for constant and frank discussion, instead of leaving the subject, as now, in a conspiracy of uneasy silence; and the need for patient and tireless propaganda against man&#x27;s reckless propagation.&quot;
He singled out the Vatican for particular criticism. &quot;Common sense percolates,&quot; he had written in 1934, &quot;despite the Roman Church; which with its half-cynical sense of reality will doubtless end by swallowing the inevitable, as with Copernicus and Darwin, and evolve some doctrine of Immaculate Contraception.&quot; He later pointed out the illogicality of the doctrine declaring it lawful to juggle with the calendar but otherwise unlawful to practise contraception.

He was not optimistic about post-war immigration to the UK, believing that in the modern world overbreeding was not solved by migration, which in turn could bring new social problems. &quot;Persons of liberal principles are shocked if one views this influx with misgiving. But the advantages are far from certain. Principles, however liberal, are no substitute for common sense.&quot;

In &quot;Literature and Psychology&quot; (1951) he had conjectured that the end of civilisation might come, not from war or famine, but from a decay of man&#x27;s intelligence and self-control under the strain of a too artificial way of life. His only science-fiction story, &#x27;Last Act&#x27; (1937), set in a not-too-distant future, had depicted the beginning of the end for &quot;the desolator, Man&quot;, in an overpopulated, over-technological, and rapidly overheating biosphere.

<text>The Doobie Brothers is the debut studio album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers. The album was recorded at Pacific Recorders in San Mateo, California and released on April 30, 1971, by Warner Bros. Records. It is their only official studio album with all tracks featuring original bass player Dave Shogren, who left during the recording of their second album.

The first single from the album, &quot;Nobody,&quot; failed to chart, as did the album itself. The single was re-released in October 1974 with a slightly edited length of 3:27 after the group had become a highly successful touring and recording act, peaking at #58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Nobody&quot; was later re-recorded for the group&#x27;s 2010 album, &quot;World Gone Crazy&quot;.

<doc id="1037109" wikidata="Q1545606" url="?curid=1037109" title="Lutz jump">
<text>The Lutz is a figure skating jump, named after Alois Lutz, an Austrian skater who performed it in 1913. It is a toepick-assisted jump with an entrance from a back outside edge and landing on the back outside edge of the opposite foot. It is the second-most difficult jump in figure skating and &quot;probably the second-most famous jump after the Axel&quot;.

==History==
The Lutz jump is named after figure skater Alois Lutz from Vienna, Austria, who first performed it in 1913. In competitions, points are awarded based on the number of rotations completed during the jump. The base value of a successful single Lutz is 0.60 points, a double Lutz is 2.10 points, a triple Lutz is 5.90 points, a quadruple Lutz is 11.50 points, and a quintuple Lutz is 14 points.

===Firsts===

==Execution==

The International Skating Union (ISU) defines the Lutz jump as &quot;a toe-pick assisted jump with an entrance from a back outside edge and landing on the back outside edge of the opposite foot&quot;. Skaters tend to go into it with a long, diagonal take-off into one of the corners of the rink. It is a difficult jump because it is counter-rotational, which means that the skater sets it up by twisting in one way and jumping in the other. Many skaters &quot;cheat&quot; the jump because they are not strong enough to maintain the counter-rotational edge, resulting in taking off from the wrong edge. A &quot;cheated&quot; Lutz jump without an outside edge is called a &quot;flutz&quot;.

<text>&quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle Is the Hand That Rules the World&quot; is a poem by William Ross Wallace that praises motherhood as the preeminent force for change in the world. The poem was first published in 1865 under the title &quot;What Rules the World&quot;. Although the poem itself is now largely forgotten, the poem&#x27;s refrain became a commonly quoted proverb.

<text>Shotley Battery was built in 1865 on the Shotley Peninsula to guard the port of Felixstowe, within HMS &quot;Ganges&quot; Naval Training school, on the same site as an existing Martello Tower.

== History ==
It was built with seven sides using brick and earth. It was surrounded with a dry ditch and had three magazines. Originally armed with 14 68-pounder guns, these were replaced 14 7-inch RML guns. It was modified with two positions for 10-inch Rifled Muzzle Loading (RML) guns in 1891. These were used until 1901.

The battery was then disarmed and transferred to the Admiralty in 1904 as part of a shore training establishment HMS Ganges. It has suffered much damage since HMS &quot;Ganges&quot; closed in 1976 and became a police training centre which has in turn closed.

<doc id="1037116" wikidata="Q660535" url="?curid=1037116" title="Bagnor">
<text>Bagnor is a village close to the town of Newbury in the English county of Berkshire and situated on the banks of the River Lambourn. At the 2011 census the population was included in the civil parish of Speen. It is best known as the home of the Watermill Theatre.

==Geography==
Bagnor is located in West Berkshire. It is near the villages of Speen, Donnington, Boxford, and Winterbourne, as well as the hamlet of Honey Bottom. Donnington Castle, a significant site in the history of the First English Civil War, lies less than a mile to the east.

==History==
Bagnor was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Bagenore&quot;.
&quot;Humphrey the Chamberlain holds Bagenore from the King. Wulfeva held it freehold from King Edward. Then it answered for 4 hides; now 1 hide. Land for 3 ploughs: In hardship 1 (plough) 3 villagers and 3 smallholders with 2 ploughs. 1 slave: a water mill at 20s meadow 22 acres: woodland at 4 pigs&quot;.
The Blackbird public house has stood in the village since the 17th century.

===Bagnor Manor===
Bagnor Manor is a country house standing near the centre of the village. The house in its current form dates from the 17th century. At the time of Domesday Book, the manor house and its estate had been held for the Crown. Ownership was later transferred to Henry de Bagenore, who sold the property to Poughley Priory and convent in 1232. The transfer was agreed in return for a yearly payment of 8 marks, food and clothing for Henry&#x27;s two sons, and an agreement that the Prior would find a suitor for his youngest daughter, Celestria.

The priory was dissolved in c.1524 and its lands seized by Henry VIII. The manor house was granted to Wolsey College, later Christ Church, Oxford in 1531. Bagnor Manor was later transferred to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster in return for lands in St. James&#x27;s Park. They built the present Grade II listed building in the 17th century, but the estate did not pass into private ownership until 1871, when it was purchased by the wealthy Grove family from Donnington. Until 2007 it was home to the art collector and property developer Peter Palumbo, who installed many artworks in the house and grounds. It is now a private residence.

==Local government==
Bagnor forms part of the civil parish of Speen, which is itself part of the district administered by the unitary authority of West Berkshire.

==Watermill Theatre==


The Watermill Theatre is a privately owned repertory theatre that has operated since 1967. It is a converted watermill with gardens beside the River Lambourn, and seats 220 people. It retains many of its original architectural features including the waterwheel, which can be viewed through a glass screen on entering the auditorium. Many successful actors have begun their careers at the Watermill Theatre, most notably Sean Bean, Bill Nighy and David Suchet. It is one of only five theatres to have been awarded a National Touring remit by Arts Council England, and previous productions have subsequently moved to Broadway and the West End.

==Rack Marsh==
Rack Marsh is a small local nature reserve in the village which is managed by BBOWT. As part of the Kennet and Lambourn floodplain it is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It was the scene of protests during the construction of the Newbury bypass which passes to the east of the village. This was partly due to the presence on the reserve of the rare Desmoulin&#x27;s whorl snail.

==Notable residents==
A number of notable individuals have lived in the village or its immediate surroundings. They include:
* Jill Fraser MBE, theatre owner and director, who was artistic director of the Watermill Theatre from 1981 to 2006.
* Lord Hanson, industrialist, who lived on the outskirts of the village.
* Jack Hargreaves, television presenter and author, who bought and converted Brook House on the Winterbourne in 1948, moving on to Lymington in 1960.
* Sir Michael Hordern, actor best known for his performances of Shakespeare, and as the voice of Paddington Bear in the eponymous BBC television series.
* George Melly, jazz musician and writer
* Peter Palumbo, property developer and art collector, who lived in Bagnor Manor.

<text>Hiunchuli () is a peak situated in the Annapurna massif of the Gandaki Province in north-central Nepal. The mountain is an extension of the Annapurna South. Between this peak and the Machapuchare is a narrow section of the Modi Khola valley that constitutes the sole access to the Annapurna Sanctuary.

Hiunchuli was first climbed in October 1971 by an expedition led by the U.S. Peace Corps volunteer Craig Anderson. The mountain is classified as a trekking peak by the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA), but it is considered one of the more difficult trekking peaks to climb due to route finding difficulties and dangers from rock fall and seracs. A climbing permit from the NMA costs US$350 for a team of up to four members.

<text>The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is a 1992 American thriller film directed by Curtis Hanson and written by Amanda Silver. The film stars Annabella Sciorra, Rebecca De Mornay, Matt McCoy, Ernie Hudson, Julianne Moore and Madeline Zima. The plot follows the pregnant wife of a Seattle obstetrician who dies by suicide after he is accused of sexual misconduct by some of his patients. The shock leads the wife to miscarry, after which she poses as a nanny for one of her late husband&#x27;s accusers and slowly begins to infiltrate the family. The film&#x27;s title is taken from the 1865 poem by William Ross Wallace and there are several nods to the 1879 comic opera &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;.

&quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on January 10, 1992, by Hollywood Pictures. The film was a box office success, grossing approximately US$140 million worldwide against a budget of $11.9 million, subsequently becoming one of the year&#x27;s most profitable films. In the home video market, it became the top rental in July 1992, and was the seventh-most rented film of 1992 in the United States. In 1993, &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; was remade into a Bollywood film, titled &quot;Khal-Naaikaa&quot;.

==Plot==
In Seattle, housewife Claire Bartel is happily married and pregnant with her second child. At a routine check-up, she is sexually molested by her new obstetrician, Dr. Victor Mott. Traumatized, she tells her husband Michael, who encourages her to report Dr. Mott to the state medical board. Her accusation prompts four more women to come forward about Dr. Mott assaulting them, and multiple charges are prepared against him. Dr. Mott dies by suicide to avoid being arrested. Lawyers tell Dr. Mott&#x27;s pregnant widow that her husband&#x27;s assets have been frozen because of the lawsuits. They also reveal that he voided his life insurance contract through his suicide, and she will lose her luxurious home. Overcome with stress, Mrs. Mott goes into pre-term labor, loses her baby, and undergoes an emergency hysterectomy. While recovering, she sees a news story identifying Claire as the first woman who came forward with the allegations against her husband.

Six months later, Claire has given birth to a boy, Joey, and has built her own personal greenhouse. She and Michael have also hired an intellectually disabled handyman named Solomon to help with repairs and improvements around their home; Solomon also bonds with their young daughter Emma. Looking for a nanny, Claire hires Peyton Flanders for the job. Unbeknownst to the Bartels, Peyton is really Mrs. Mott, who uses her new job to undermine Claire in her household. She is out for revenge against Claire for reporting her husband in spite of his behavior, as her husband was her only chance to have children. She frequently breastfeeds Joey in secret; this causes him to stop taking Claire&#x27;s milk. Mrs. Mott tries to turn Claire&#x27;s daughter Emma against her and secretly destroys Michael&#x27;s office proposal. One day, Solomon discovers Mrs. Mott breastfeeding Joey. To prevent him from exposing her, Mrs. Mott suggests to Claire that Solomon might be molesting Emma. Mrs. Mott plants a pair of Emma&#x27;s underwear in Solomon&#x27;s toolbox, leading Claire to fire him, to Emma&#x27;s disappointment and causing her to distance herself from her mother as Mrs. Mott had planned. Unbeknownst to the family except for Emma, Solomon keeps a watchful eye over the Bartels. 

Knowing that Claire&#x27;s close friend Marlene had been Michael&#x27;s ex-girlfriend before he married Claire, Mrs. Mott suggests to Michael that he arrange a surprise birthday party for Claire, leading Marlene and Michael to meet in secret. Claire vocally accuses Michael of having an affair with Marlene, only to find the party-goers, including a hurt and humiliated Marlene, waiting in the next room.

A now wary Claire begins to suspect &quot;Peyton&#x27;s&quot; hand in all of these incidents and suggests to Michael that they should take a family vacation without &quot;Peyton&quot;. Mrs. Mott overhears this and boobytraps the greenhouse for Claire. Claire doesn’t go into the greenhouse immediately, but goes into town to pick up some seedlings first. Marlene, who is a real estate agent, discovers Mrs. Mott&#x27;s identity after the Mott&#x27;s home is listed for sale. When she confronts &quot;Peyton&quot; about her real identity and asks for Claire, Mrs. Mott tricks her into going into the greenhouse, where she springs the boobytrap and is killed by the falling glass ceiling. Knowing that Claire suffers from asthma, Mrs. Mott empties all of her inhalers. When Claire returns and finds Marlene&#x27;s bloodied body, she has an asthma attack and is briefly hospitalized. Michael is left distraught over Marlene&#x27;s death and his wife&#x27;s condition; Mrs. Mott attempts to seduce him, but he rejects her. When Claire returns from the hospital, she visits Marlene&#x27;s office and finally uncovers the truth about Mrs. Mott after visiting the Motts&#x27; house and meeting the real estate agent. She returns home and punches Mrs. Mott in the face while revealing the truth to Michael. They fire &quot;Peyton&quot; and order her to leave immediately without packing her belongings, and Michael tells Claire to get the kids so they can head to a hotel for safety.

Mrs. Mott breaks into the house and hits Michael with a shovel in the basement, knocking him down the stairs and breaking his legs. She then attempts to fulfill her true goal: taking the kids for herself. However, after seeing Mrs. Mott assault Claire, Emma outsmarts Mrs. Mott and locks her in the nursery, declaring that Mrs. Mott will never be her mother. Mrs. Mott escapes and finds Solomon in the attic, aiding the kids&#x27; escape. She attempts to kill Claire, but stops after Claire appears to be having another asthma attack, prompting Mrs. Mott to mock her. As she tries to take Joey, Claire gets up, having faked her asthma attack, and viciously attacks a stunned Mrs. Mott, and Solomon distracts her long enough for Claire to push her out of the window, fatally impaling her on the picket fence. Touched at how Solomon risked his life to protect her family, Claire welcomes him back, and they all leave the attic to help Michael as the police and paramedics arrive.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; originated as Amanda Silver&#x27;s film school thesis.

In August 1990, it was reported Interscope Communications was preparing the film for Hollywood Pictures. By October 1990 Curtis Hanson was on board to direct.
Filming began on April 15, 1991, after being rescheduled from February 22. The film shoot was delayed due to the casting of the female leads. The setting and location was originally meant to be in Atlanta, Georgia, but was filmed in Tacoma and Seattle in Washington.

===Filming locations===

Filming locations were Issaquah, Washington; Seattle, Washington (Mott&#x27;s residence at 2502 37th Ave W in Seattle); and the Bartels&#x27; residence at 808 N. Yakima Ave. Tacoma, Washington.

==Release and reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; opened on January 10, 1992, and grossed $7.7 million in its opening weekend, bringing &quot;Hook&quot; down to #2 at the US box office from its four-week stay at #1. The film lasted at #1 for four consecutive weeks, then was upended by &quot;Medicine Man&quot;, which was also released by Hollywood Pictures. By the end of its run, the film earned a total of $88 million in the United States and Canada and $52 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $140 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; has an approval rating of 66% based on 53 reviews. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Thanks largely to Rebecca De Mornay&#x27;s delightfully villainous turn in the central role, &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; is an entertaining -- albeit rather silly -- domestic thriller.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 64% based on reviews from 26 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Gene Siskel stated that he &quot;had trouble accepting the premise of this picture because of the casual way in which the nanny is hired in an early scene by the mother,&quot; citing that the premise is unrealistic. However, he gave praise to Julianne Moore&#x27;s character, saying, &quot;much more believable, is the supporting character of the mother&#x27;s best friend&quot; and that &quot;the friend is a terrific character, it&#x27;s too bad she doesn&#x27;t have more scenes in the picture.&quot; He mentioned that his &quot;biggest objection to &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; is to its scenes with the children in jeopardy or psychic pain.&quot; Siskel finally remarked that &quot;there are some fun thrills in &quot;The Hand that Rocks the Cradle&quot; to be sure, but I found a lot of it distasteful, too.&quot; Roger Ebert had a higher opinion of the film, stating that he &quot;found this film worked&quot; and that &quot;It touches on a fear and that&#x27;s why it appeals to us.&quot; Ebert praised De Mornay&#x27;s performance in the film, saying, &quot;she does, I think, a very good job, a very, very sound job of being the villainess in this film and I think it&#x27;s an effective performance&quot; and that he found the scenes of the children &quot;very interesting because I saw them as a portrait of the evil of that woman.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of the film that &quot;&quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; is meant to scare audiences more or less in the way that the patrons of the early nickelodeons were frightened when they saw the image of a train rushing at them. Audiences aren&#x27;t asked to think, only to react&quot; and that &quot;&quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; proves again that not thinking isn&#x27;t especially easy even today. Though Mr. Hanson is a slick movie maker, he is not an especially persuasive one here. Don&#x27;t be gulled by those who would compare &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; to &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, which features three strong characters who, in one way or another, are ready to answer for their actions.&quot; He added that &quot;Mr. Hanson creates the occasionally effective shock effect to satisfy those who want to squeal in mock fright. More often the devices he uses are such tired tricks as the crosscutting between two sets of simultaneous, often innocent, actions to create the illusion of suspense that can&#x27;t be sustained.&quot; Rebecca Hawkes of &quot;Telegraph&quot; gave the film a rating a 3 stars out of 5 and said that &quot;It’s a tense, viscerally unsettling moment, that helps make the film into something more than just a fun, formulaic thriller&quot;, while Sue Heal of &quot;The Radio Times&quot; rated the film 4 stars out of 5, stating that &quot;This is pure unbridled hokum, of course, but extremely effective until the last 30 minutes, when the plot rapidly self-destructs.&quot;

&quot;Washington Post&quot; reviewer Rita Kempley criticized the movie, arguing that it is anti-feminist.

In 2006, the film was included in Bravo&#x27;s special &quot;30 Even Scarier Movie Moments&quot;, placing at #24.

===Accolades===
At the 19th Saturn Awards it was nominated for Best Horror Film, Best Actress (Rebecca De Mornay), and Best Supporting Actress (Julianne Moore). At the 1992 MTV Movie Awards Rebecca De Mornay&#x27;s performance won the award for Best Villain and was nominated for Best Female Performance.

On September 4, 2012 Disney/Buena Vista released the film on Blu-ray disc with the same theatrical trailer as the previous releases.
The film was presented in its original widescreen aspect ratio, approximately 1.85:1.

<doc id="1037122" wikidata="Q1063884" url="?curid=1037122" title="Portugal during World War I">
<text>The Kingdom of Portugal had been allied with England since 1373, and thus the Republic of Portugal was an ally of the United Kingdom. However, Portugal remained neutral from the start of World War I in 1914 until early 1916. In that time there were many hostile engagements with Germany. Portugal wanted to meet British requests for aid and protect its colonies in Africa, causing clashes with German troops in the south of Portuguese Angola, which bordered German South West Africa, in 1914 and 1915 (see German campaign in Angola). 

Tensions between Germany and Portugal also arose as a result of German U-boat warfare, which sought to blockade the United Kingdom, at the time the most important market for Portuguese products. Ultimately this led to the confiscation of German ships interned in Portuguese ports in 1916, to which Germany reacted by declaring war on 9 March 1916. In total, from 1916 to 1918, about 91 Portuguese ships were sunk and 5 damaged by German U-boats, causing at least 170 casualties. 

About 12,000 Portuguese troops died during World War I, including Africans who served in its armed forces on the colonial front. Civilian deaths by some estimates exceeded 220,000: 82,000 caused by food shortages and 138,000 by the Spanish flu.

==1914==

* July: The German and British Empires entered into secret negotiations over a possible dismemberment of Portuguese Angola; in such a case, most of the land would fall into the hands of the Germans. An &quot;Angola-Bund&quot; (&quot;Angola League&quot; to promote a German takeover) had been founded in 1912.
* August to September: Skirmishes occurred between German and Portuguese colonial troops in Africa, and the Germans instigated tribal revolts.
** Maziua raid (24 August): A small German force attacked a Portuguese outpost at Maziua in Portuguese Mozambique, resulting in the first Portuguese casualties of World War I. The German central government accepted full responsibility, and offered an official apology.
* September: The Portuguese government sent reinforcements to the southern border of Angola. After war broke out, the border between German South West Africa and Angola remained open. The Germans hoped to supply food and possibly even arms through it. However, the Portuguese colonial government was hostile and tried to stop all trade. A few German nationals in Angola were interned.
* October: 1,600 troops arrive in Portuguese Angola and 1,527 troops arrived in Mozambique from Portugal, transported by British ships.

==1915==
* November: 1,527 troops arrived in Mozambique, commanded by Moura Mendes. The second force was tasked with recapturing the Kionga Triangle from the Germans.

==1916==
When Portugal complied with a British request to confiscate German ships interned in Portuguese ports, Germany reacted by declaring war on Portugal, thus forcing the Portuguese into the war.

* February 23: Following a British request, the commander of the Portuguese Navy division in Lisbon seized 36 German and Austro-Hungarian ships in Lisbon. On each ship a Portuguese crew was put aboard, and the flag of Portugal was raised. The Prime Minister of Portugal, Afonso Costa, denied that this was an act of war, and the Portuguese Ambassador in Berlin was instructed to assure the German government that Portugal would respect the rights of German shipowners. Portugal stated that it had requisitioned the ships &quot;in the public interest&quot;, for the &quot;necessities of the nation&#x27;s economic situation&quot;. Portugal had not confiscated the ships, and they would be converted for &quot;transport and other purposes&quot;. An explosive device was discovered in the boiler room of the Norddeutscher Lloyd ship &quot;Bülow&quot;, which was designed to detonate if the ship were moved. The Portuguese prevented it from being detonated, but her machinery was damaged.

* February 25: In other Portuguese ports there were another 80 German and Austro-Hungarian ships, adding up to a total tonnage of more than . On 25 February Portugal seized eight German ships in São Vicente, Cape Verde, and announced that it intended to requisition German and Austro-Hungarian ships in other ports in Portugal and in the Portuguese Empire.
* February 28: a German diplomatic note to Portugal protested that the seizure of the ships violated German treaty rights.
* March 3: By this date Portugal had seized all German ships in Mormugão in Goa.
* March 9: Germany declared war on Portugal. The Portuguese government started to organise the participation of its troops on the Western Front. Shortly afterward, Portugal began closing its consulates in the Ottoman Empire. (The Ottomans had no representation in Portugal.)
* March 15: Austria-Hungary declared war on Portugal.
* June 9: Finance Minister Afonso Costa took part in an Allied Economic Conference in which the Allies decided that Germany must return the territories of Alsace-Lorraine to France (occupied since 1871) and Kionga in Mozambique to Portugal (occupied since 1894) as a condition for peace.
* July 15: The British government formally invited Portugal to take part in the military operations of the Allies.
* July 22: The Portuguese Expeditionary Corps (&quot;Corpo Expedicionário Português, CEP&quot;), with 30,000 soldiers, was established in Tancos, Portugal, under the command of General Norton de Matos.
* August 7: The Portuguese Parliament accepted the participation of Portugal in the war, following the invitation of the British government. The Portuguese war effort reached 55,000 infantry soldiers, plus 1,000 artillerymen, to be sent to France, 4,000 soldiers per month, to man of battlefront. Only the first two divisions reached France. At the same time, Portugal fielded forces in its African colonies: in Mozambique to defend the colony from German colonial forces, and in the south of Angola against native unrest instigated by the Germans.
* December 3: , captained by Max Valentiner, entered Funchal harbour in Madeira and torpedoed and sank three ships: CS &quot;Dacia&quot; (), () and &quot;Surprise&quot; (). The commander of the French gunboat &quot;Surprise&quot; and 34 of her crew (7 Portuguese) were killed in the attack. &quot;Dacia&quot;, a British cable layer, which had previously undertaken war work off the coast of Casablanca and Dakar, was in the process of diverting the German South American cable into Brest, France. After the attack, the Germans bombarded Funchal for two hours from a range of about . Batteries on Madeira returned fire and eventually force the Germans to withdraw.
* December 26: The French government asked Portugal to send artillery crews to France to operate 20 to 30 heavy artillery batteries.

==1917==

* A few Portuguese troops were sent to the New Forest in Britain, to help with a timber shortage in collaboration with the Canadian Forestry Corps. The stone chimney of their cookhouse is preserved as a monument to them, known as the Portuguese Fireplace.
* January 3: A convention with Britain regulated Portuguese participation in the Western Front. Portuguese troops of the CEP were to be integrated in the BEF (British Expeditionary Force).
* January 7: The Independent Heavy Artillery Corps (&quot;Corpo de Artilharia Pesada Independente&quot;, CAPI) was created to respond to the French request for artillery crews. Under the Portuguese Superior Command, this unit was to operate 25 heavy artillery batteries.
* February 2: The first Portuguese troops arrived at the port of Brest in Brittany, France.
* February 23: The second contingent of the CEP leaves for France.
* April 4: The Portuguese troops arrive at the front. The first Portuguese casualty was Private António Gonçalves Curado, killed in action.
* May 30: The First Infantry Brigade of the CEP First Division occupied a sector at the battle front.
* June 4: Germans attacked the sector defended by the First Brigade.
* June 16: Second Infantry Brigade occupied another sector on the battle front.
* July 4: bombarded Ponta Delgada, Azores and killed four people. United States Navy collier responded with 3-inch gunfire, causing &quot;U-155&quot; to withdraw.
* July 10: CEP First Division assumed responsibility of its part of the Portuguese sector on the battle front. It was subordinated to the XI Corps of the British Army under the command of General Richard Haking. CEP Third Infantry Brigade occupied a sector on the front.
* September 23: The Fourth Brigade, known as the Brigade of Minho (&quot;Brigada do Minho&quot;), part of the Second Division, reached the front.
* October 17: The first Portuguese CAPI artillery soldiers, representing Portugal&#x27;s direct support to the French war effort, arrived in France. They were designated by the French as the &quot;Corps d&#x27;artillerie lourde portugais&quot; (CALP).
* November 5: Portuguese command assumed responsibility for its sector in the front. Until then, it had been under the command of General Henry Horne&#x27;s British First Army.
* Late 1917: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s German colonial force entered Mozambique from nearby German East Africa after a series of long-running battles with numerically superior British forces. 
* December 12: two German U-boats, and (captained by Max Valentiner), again bombarded Funchal. The attack lasted about 30 minutes, and forty and shells were fired. There were three fatalities and 17 wounded, and a number of houses and Santa Clara Church were hit.
* December 17: &quot;U-156&quot; stopped and scuttled the Portuguese ship &quot;Açoriano&quot; (a wooden three-masted schooner) southeast of the Azores.
* December 26: &quot;U-157&quot; (captained by Max Valentiner) sank the Portuguese ship &quot;Lidia&quot; in the Azores.

==1918==

* February 17: &quot;SM U-157&quot; (captained by Max Valentiner) sank the Portuguese ship &quot;Estrella de Bissao&quot; off the coast of South Africa.
* March 16: The Portuguese artillery batteries entered action.
* March 27: A German offensive prevented Portuguese soldiers from being released from combat. As a third Portuguese Division was never sent to France, the Portuguese Army received no reinforcements at all. Portuguese soldiers had to serve in the battle front for long periods, and were thus among the most exhausted men in the front.
* April 6: The conditions of the Portuguese soldiers became so difficult that the British finally decided to release them. The CEP was supposed to be reorganised, the First Division going to the rear as a reserve force and the Second Division becoming part of the Eleventh Corps of the British Army, under General Haking&#x27;s command. Haking visited the Portuguese troops and decided to send the Second Division to the rear from April 9, but it never happened. The Germans attacked the British lines, forcing them to retreat about . Instead of being released, Portuguese troops had to fight off the German offensive on their sector.

* April 9: The Battle of La Lys, as it became known in Portugal, or Operation Georgette or the Battle of Estaires to the British, started with a heavy artillery barrage from the Germans, followed by a German offensive with intensive use of poison gas. The German Sixth Army deployed eight divisions (about 100,000 men), supported by intensive artillery fire. Against the force, the Portuguese had 20,000 soldiers and 88 guns. As a result, the Second Division was decimated in the battle. The CEP lost 327 officers and 7,098 soldiers, about 35 percent of its effective fighting capacity. The survivors were sent to the rear, some of the units being integrated into the British Army later on.

During this battle, one of the most courageous acts in Portuguese military history was perpetrated, as Private Aníbal Milhais (also known as &quot;Soldado Milhões&quot; [&quot;A Soldier as good as a million others&quot; in his commanding officer&#x27;s words]) defended the retreating Allied forces with nothing but his machine gun, allowing them to fall back and regroup. He defeated two German regiments and forced the remaining German forces to go around him. They found it impossible to defeat what they believed to be a heavily armed post. Once he ran out of bullets, he escaped the battlefield. He got lost along the way, and had nothing to eat for three days but the sweet almonds his family had sent him from Portugal. Lost and exhausted, he rescued a British major from drowning in a swamp. The major led him to the Allied camp, and told of Milhais&#x27;s deeds.
* July: General Tomás António Garcia Rosado was appointed as the new Commanding Chief of the remaining CEP.
* July: The German force under General Lettow-Vorbeck captured Namacurra in Portuguese East Africa and seized important arms and supplies. Similar smaller successes against Portuguese outposts had already helped resupply his force.
* July 4: CEP First Division was subordinated to the British Fifth Army commanded by General William Birdwood.
* August 25: General Garcia Rosado assumed command of the CEP in France. &quot;U-157&quot; sank the Portuguese ship &quot;Gloria&quot;, from Porto Santo Island, Madeira.
* September 22: &quot;U-157&quot; sank the Portuguese ship &quot;Gaia&quot; near the Azores.
* October 14: In the action of 14 October 1918, commanded by Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière sank the Portuguese patrol boat NRP &quot;Augusto Castilho&quot; commanded by Carvalho Araújo, after several hours of fighting.
* November 11: Germany accepted the armistice proposed by the Allies. The war ended.

The war caused Portugal 8,145 dead, 13,751 wounded and 12,318 prisoners or missing. At sea, 96 Portuguese ships were sunk (100,193 tons) and 5 Portuguese ships damaged (7,485 tons) by German submarines.

==After the war==

===1919===
* January 19: Professor Egas Moniz led he Portuguese delegation at the Peace Conference in Versailles, France. In the Treaty of Versailles, Germany ceded the port of Kionga, associated with German East Africa (now mainland Tanzania), to Portugal. This was the only territory gained by Portugal for taking part in World War I on the side of the victorious Allies.

===1921===

* November 19: Charles I, the last emperor of Austria-Hungary, went into exile on the Portuguese island of Madeira, where he remained until his death on April 1, 1922. In 1917 he had secretly tried to enter peace negotiations with France. Although his foreign minister Ottokar Czernin was interested in negotiating only a general peace that would include Germany as well, Charles himself, in negotiations with the French with his brother-in-law Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, an officer in the Belgian army, as an intermediary, went much farther in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace. When news of the overture leaked in April 1918, Charles denied involvement until French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau published letters signed by Charles. That led to Czernin&#x27;s resignation and forced Austria-Hungary into an even more dependent position with respect to its German ally. Determined to prevent a restoration attempt, the Council of Allied Powers agreed on Madeira as a place of exile for the former emperor because it was isolated in the Atlantic and easily guarded.

<text>:&quot;This is about the architect. For his father, see John Foster, Sr.&quot;

John Foster, Junior (1786 – 21 August 1846) was an English architect born and based in Liverpool. In succession to his father, he was Surveyor to the Corporation of Liverpool (1824–1835). His buildings were generally in the Greek Revival style and he mainly worked on public buildings and Anglican churches.

==Biography==
John Foster Sr. married Ann Dutton on 18 September 1781 in St George&#x27;s Church, Liverpool. John Foster Jr. is the second of eight sons born to the couple in 1786 in Liverpool. Foster studied under Jeffry Wyatt in Lower Brook Street, London, whose uncle James Wyatt had worked with John Sr. on Liverpool Town Hall. 

John Jr. displayed three designs at Royal Academy of Arts, in 1805 a design for a Mausoleum, in 1806 a design for a National Museum and in 1807 a Public Library or National Gallery. During 1810-11 he travelled extensively through southern Europe and the Mediterranean studying classical architecture and accompanied C. R. Cockerell and the German archaeologists Haller and Linckh during their excavation of the temples at Aegina and Bassae. In 1816 John Jr. returned to Liverpool and joined the family building firm. He succeeded his father, John Foster, Sr., as senior surveyor to the Corporation of Liverpool in 1824, and held that post until the Municipal Reform Act 1835. His own designs included The Oratory, St. John&#x27;s Market, Liverpool Necropolis (converted into a park in 1914), St James Cemetery, alterations and additions to Knowsley Hall, the grandstand at Aintree Racecourse and the Church of St. Andrew&#x27;s in Rodney Street, converted in the early 21st century to student accommodation. The second Royal Infirmary and the public baths have both been demolished, as has the enormous, domed Custom House, which suffered extensive fire damage during the Second World War. He is often attributed as the architect for numbers 2–10 Gambier Terrace, Liverpool.

He was living in Hamilton Square, Birkenhead when he died in 1846 and was buried the cemetery, St James, he designed.

<text>Crownhill Fort is a Royal Commission Fort built in the 1860s in Crownhill as part of Lord Palmerston&#x27;s ring of land defences for Plymouth. Restored by the Landmark Trust, it is now home to several small businesses, museums, exhibitions and a holiday apartment sleeping up to eight people. The Fort is open to the public on the last Friday of each month and hosts tours for local schools and societies at other times.

==History of the fort==

Crownhill Fort was designed by Captain Edmund Frederick Du Cane as one of Lord Palmerston&#x27;s last forts and was the largest of the forts of Plymouth&#x27;s North Eastern defences, whose purpose was to defend the Royal Dockyard at Devonport from the possibility of a French attack, under the leadership of Napoleon III.

Construction began in April 1863, with Crownhill Fort being at the cutting edge of fortress design, although it does conform to the standard polygonal design of its contemporaries. It was built 400 metres in front of the defensive line, now incorporated into the east-west Crownhill Road, in an exposed position on a natural outcrop. Crownhill Fort is designed for all round defence, with each of its seven sides having massive ramparts and being surrounded by a deep ditch. All sides were also protected by gunfire, with the fort having around 350 built-in rifle loopholes. It was designed for an armament of 32 guns on the ramparts and 6 mortars sited in two mortar pits to the south west and north west of the Parade Ground. A year later, in 1864, Russian commander General Todleben was shown the building works, and he complimented them. 

In 1866, after a strike, George Baker, the building contractor, went bankrupt and so the work was finished by the Royal Engineers who would become Crownhill Fort&#x27;s first occupants. The total cost of the construction was £76,409; a large sum at the time, but much less costly than other Palmerston forts.

In 1881, the Director of Artillery and Stores recommended that two forts, Fort Widley in Portsmouth and Crownhill Fort, be armed with complete peacetime armaments. None of the original armament survives but The Landmark Trust has reinstated several artillery pieces similar to those that would have occupied Forts of this kind.

Due to continual advancement in weaponry and warfare many Victorian forts were abandoned by the army. Crownhill Fort remained an MOD site until 1986 and was instead used by many different infantry regiments as HQ Plymouth Garrison.

In the First World War, Crownhill Fort was used as a recruitment and transport centre for troops being sent to the fronts in Turkey and Africa. It was then used as a de-mobilisation depot before becoming a base for the newly created Royal Signals Corps.

The last time Crownhill Fort was armed was during the Second World War, when anti-aircraft guns were positioned in the fort. Following the war, in the 1950s, it had a Gun Operations Room built on the parade ground, incorporating part of the Officers barrack. It then continued as a home for the 59 Independent Commando Squadron Royal Engineers until 1983, despatching 647 troops and 1,897 tonnes of war material during the Falklands War. The fort was purchased 3 years later by the Landmark Trust who have restored Crownhill Fort as the best preserved example of Palmerston&#x27;s forts. In completing this task, Landmark Trust have received much assistance from grant aid courtesy of the European Committee, English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund.

==Structure of Crownhill Fort==
The basic shape of Crownhill Fort is a heptagon, incorporating many advanced Victorian fort design ideas. 

===The ditch===
The fort is surrounded by a dry ditch hewn from the bedrock and flanked by caponiers. 200 000 tonnes of material had to be moved to create the ditch, which is 30 ft deep and 30 ft wide .

===The caponiers===
Crownhill Fort has six three-storey caponiers. The first floor was for infantrymen, the second was for gun casements each housing Smooth-Bore Breech-Loading guns and the third connects with the &quot;Chemin de Ronde&quot;, the parapeted walkway circling the fort. The north caponier is a full caponier because it points in two directions. The other five caponiers are demi-caponiers because they face in one direction only.

==Crownhill Fort&#x27;s guns==

Crownhill Fort is famous for its collection of artillery. The cannon are maintained in working order and are fired on event days to recreate the sounds and atmosphere of a working fortress. In total, the fort has emplacements for 17 guns on its ramparts (including 5 Haxo casements and 2 Moncrieff pits) and 15 in its caponiers. Some of the guns that can be found at Crownhill Fort include:
* a replica Moncrieff Counterweight Disappearing Gun, one of only two working examples – the carriage uses a unique counterweight system to rise above the parapet to fire and then descend in a controlled manner, powered by the recoil.
* two 13-inch Mortars, on loan from the Royal Armouries, which were designed to fire 200-pound explosive shells. It is believed that they were used in the Crimean War, against Russia
* two 32 Pounder smooth-bore breech-loading guns from the 1880s, designed to fire case shot 
* four replica 32-pounder smooth-bore breech-loading guns dating from 1997
* two replica Armstrong 7-inch rifled breechloaders. These guns were first issued to the Navy in 1858, but were found to be not powerful enough, and so were sent instead to be mounted on the ramparts of land fortifications, such as Crownhill Fort. 
* two muzzle-loading 32-pounder guns, which were rescued from Tregantle Fort in Cornwall, where they were being used as bollards. 
* a muzzle loading 2-pound cannon, from the 1790s
* a carronade made by the foundry Bailey, Pegg and Co Ltd, from Staffordshire that points towards the countermining gallery.

==The Fort today==
Today Crownhill Fort is home to several small businesses and a holiday apartment. The Fort is open to the public on the last Friday of each month from January to November and by appointment for schools and groups at most other times. Visitors can see museum displays, watch demonstrations of Victorian firepower and take guided tours in the labyrinth of underground rooms and passages.

In the past few years The Landmark Trust has been able to carry out various improvement works at the Fort. 
*In 2010 a large number of mature trees were felled on the rampart and extracted by helicopter. Left unchecked these trees would have damaged the structures under the rampart. 
*2014 saw the end of a three-year project to clear self-seeded saplings on the counterscarp walls. This project has seen logging horses employed to allow the timber to be extracted and processed.
*Work to clear the Victorian Storm Drains to help alleviate flooding on the lower decks of the structure was completed in 2017.
*In 2018 work was undertaken outside the Fort to restore several concrete fence posts added in the 1920s and replace their wiring.
*Work on the Royal Artillery Store is due to begin in September 2018 to bring this derelict building back in to use as a workshop.

<doc id="1037135" wikidata="Q870517" url="?curid=1037135" title="Odrysian kingdom">
<text>The Odrysian kingdom (; Ancient Greek: ) was an ancient Thracian state that thrived between the early 5th century BC and the early 3rd / late 1st century BC. Located in present-day Bulgaria, southeastern Romania (Northern Dobruja), northern Greece and European Turkey, it was a tribal amalgam dominated by the Odrysians that was the first large political entity to develop in the eastern Balkans. Before the foundation of Seuthopolis in the late 4th century it had no fixed capital.

The Odrysian kingdom was founded by king Teres I, exploiting the collapse of the Persian presence in Europe due to failed invasion of Greece in 480–79. Teres and his son Sitalces pursued a policy of expansion, making the kingdom one of the most powerful of its time. Throughout much of its early history it remained an ally of Athens and even joined the Peloponnesian War on its side. By 400 BC the state showed first signs of fatigue, although the skilled Cotys I initiated a brief renaissance that lasted until his murder in 360 BC.

Afterwards the kingdom disintegrated: southern and central Thrace were divided among three Odrysian kings, while the northeast came under the dominion of the kingdom of the Getae. The three Odrysian kingdoms were eventually conquered by the rising kingdom of Macedon under Philip II in 340 BC. A much smaller Odrysian state was revived in around 330 BC by Seuthes III, who founded a new capital named Seuthopolis that functioned until the second quarter of the 3rd century BC. After that there is little conclusive evidence for the persistence of an Odrysian state, with the exception of a dubious Odrysian king fighting in the Third Macedonian War named Cotys. The Odrysian kingdom was attacked by the Roman Republic in the late 1st century BC, when the Odrysian heartlands eventually became known as the Sapaean kingdom, a client state of the Roman Republic, which was finally abolished and converted into a Roman province of Thracia in 45-46 AD.

== History ==
=== Background ===
====Thrace and its early history====

Since the ancient Thracians lacked an indigenous writing tradition, the most important sources for the reconstruction of their history are archaeological remains, coins as well as accounts of ancient Greek historians. Said historians considered the Thracians to be a numerous people and their country, Thrace, to be of barely comprehensible size, so large that Andron of Halicarnassus (4th century BC) thought of it as a continent of its own. While the boundaries of Thrace fluctuated throughout history, Thrace can be divided in a northern and a southern half, which were also culturally different. The border between the two halves has been identified as the Haemus Mountains or the Danube slightly further north. Southern Thrace covered the fertile valley between the Haemus and the Rhodopes, the Strandzha and the shores of the Propontis and the Aegean and Black Seas. The western boundary was marked by the Strymon and the upper Morava. Northern Thrace was defined by the Danube, the Carpathians and the adjacent western tip of the Pontic–Caspian steppe, thus enclosing parts of the territory now comprising modern Romania, Moldova, Serbia and Ukraine. Thrace also extended into what is now northwestern Turkey both west and east (Bithynia, Mysia) of the Propontis.

Thracians had already settled in the 2nd millennium BCE, and were featured in the epics of Homer. Occasional references to them appear in the following centuries, although it was not until the 5th century when Greek literature developed an interest in discussing non-Greeks more extensively. In the 7th and 6th centuries, much of the Thracian coast was settled by Greek colonists who founded numerous towns, like Thasos, Byzantion or Odessos. The political history of the Thracian tribes of this age is virtually unknown, although it is recorded that in the late 6th century, Athenian settlers interacted with a &quot;king of Thrace&quot; (and possible predecessor of the Odrysian kings?) residing north of the Chersonese peninsula. The absence of imported artefacts confirms that inland Thrace north of the Rhodopes remained largely isolated from the Aegean trade until the late 6th century.

====Persian Thrace====

In around 513 BC, an army of the mighty Persian dynasty of the Achaemenids crossed the Bosphorus, after already having subdued the Thracians of Bithynia thirty years earlier. King Darius I&#x27;s goal was a punitive expedition against the Scythians at the northern shores of the Black Sea. Most eastern Thracian tribes submitted peacefully, except of the Getae, who were defeated. More expeditions under the generals Megabazus and Mardonius as well as king Xerxes I followed, even though they only managed to secure the Aegean coast.

It seems most likely that the Achaemenids did not establish a satrapy (provincial administration) in Thrace, even though the historian Herodotus claimed that the subdued regions had to pay taxes. As a matter of fact, there is no evidence for important administrative centers. Instead, Persian authority was merely exercised through a couple of garrisoned forts, most importantly those of Doriskos and Eion. Hence, the vast majority of Thrace remained unaffected by the Persian presence. After the failed invasion of Greece in 480-79, the Persian foothold in Europe collapsed. By around 450, Persian authority in Europe, including Thrace, had vanished entirely.

=== Foundation and early years ( 480–431 BC) ===
====Early tribal kingdom====

Although the Persian presence in Thrace was short-lived, it probably stimulated trade and first state formations among the Thracians. Mintings of Thracian coins started around 500 and may be an indicator for a variety of early tribal kingdoms. It has been suggested that the Odrysian kingdom might have had its origins in this period, even though the name of the Odrysians is notably absent from the numismatic evidence. The Odrysians eventually stepped into the light of history in the aftermath of the Persian failure in Greece, when they were mentioned by Herodotus, but without any further details. The Odrysians had their core territory in the valleys of the Hebros river and its tributaries Tonzos and Arda. Like other Thracian polities, the Odrysian tribal kingdom attempted to fill the vacuum left by the Persian retreat.

====Expansion under Teres I====

The first known Odrysian king was the expansionist Teres I, who is claimed by Thucydides to have been the first Odrysian king altogether. Writing in the late 5th century BC, he wrote that Teres &quot;was the first powerful king of the Odrysae&quot; and that he &quot;was the first founder of the great Odrysian empire, which he extended over a large part of Thrace, although many of the Thracian tribes are still independent.&quot; Said independent tribes consisted of Thracians living along parts of the Aegean coast and in parts of the Rhodope mountains and as well as the powerful Triballi around the Haemus.

Teres most likely came to dominate central Thrace soon after 480 BC. Building his realm on a privileged warrior aristocracy, he and his son Sitalces expanded the realm from the Danube in the north to the outskirts of Abdera at the Aegean Sea. He also expanded to eastern Thrace, although he suffered a setback at the hands of the Thynoi. In the north-east, he cemented the position of his realm by allying himself with the kingdom of Scythia under king Ariapeithes, who married Teres&#x27; daughter. In conclusion, the Odrysians were the first to supersede the Thracian tribal system and establish a large state in the eastern Balkans.

Around the middle of the 5th century, when Sitalces had not yet succeeded his father, the Odrysians intervened in a Scythian civil war, seemingly on the side of the dethroned king Scylas against Octamasadas, who was a son of Ariapeithes and Teres&#x27; sister. When the two armies met at the Danube, however, Sitalces simply agreed to hand over Scylas (who was killed on the spot) for an unnamed brother of his who resided among the Scythians. Another important event may have happened further east, in the Bosporan Kingdom, when a Thracian named Spartokos seized power in around 438. It is not unlikely that he was of Odrysian descent and that his takeover was instigated by the Odrysian royal house, although this must remain speculation.

====The early Odrysian elite in archaeology====

Archaeological evidence confirms that by the middle of the 5th century BC, a new and powerful elite had emerged that accumulated a wealth of precious artifacts of both local and regional origin. Burial practices were changing after the Persian withdrawal and a new type of elite burial emerged in central Thrace in the form of tombs with ashlar masonry, sometimes with stone sarcophagi. The tomb of Rouets from the late 5th century even contained traces of wall paintings. The earliest of these new elite tombs can be found in the necropolis of Duvanli, with the oldest tombs dating to the mid-5th century. Their inventory is exceptional not only by contemporary Thracian, but even Mediterranean standards. According to the archaeologist Tonkova they contained &quot;splendid sets of head and body ornaments, consisting of numerous hoop or boat-shaped earrings, pendants for earrings, a necklace, a torque, bracelets, finger-rings, 
chains with pendants and fibulae, and pectorals.&quot; Most Thracian elite tombs have been identified as warrior burials as they contained weapons and gold pectorals. Two burials from Svetitsa (second half of the 5th century BC) and Dalakova (early 4th century BC) also contained finely crafted and rather impressive gold funeral masks.

===The Odrysians and the Peloponnesian war (431–404 BC)===

====Sitalces and his alliance with Athens====

Teres, who is claimed to have lived 92 years, had died by the outbreak of the Peloponnesian war in 431. His successor was his son Sitalces, whose reign is mostly known thanks to the account of Thucydides. Before the war he is known to have campaigned against the Paeonians in the west, subjugating some of the tribes living along the upper reaches of the Strymon. Now, his influence extended over much of Bulgaria, Greek and Turkish Thrace and also parts of southeastern Romania: from the Strymon and Iskar rivers in the west to the Black Sea and the Propontis in the east as well as the Haemus and the mouth of the Danube (which was ruled by the tributary Getae) in the north. According to Thucydides, the Odrysian state was &quot;very powerful, and in revenue and general prosperity exceeded all the nations of Europe which lie between the Ionian Sea and the Euxine [Black Sea].&quot;

In the south, much of coastal Thrace had passed under the rule of Athens, making them direct neighbours of the Odrysians. The Athenians had already taken some interest in the Thracian interior before 431, but it was in said year when they concluded an alliance with Sitalces against Perdiccas II of Macedon in the west. This pact was cemented by a dynastic marriage, as Sitalces would marry the sister of the Athenian ambassador, Nymphodoros of Abdera. Sitalces&#x27; son Sadokos was sent to Athens and was granted the Athenian citizenship. Sitalces, apparently an experienced leader with political acumen, would prove his commitment to the alliance in the next year, when he arrested a Peloponnesian embassy that tried to persuade him to join the Spartan side and handed it over to Athens.

At the turn of the year 428, Sitalces raised a massive, multi-ethnic army to march against Macedon and insurgents on the Chalkidiki peninsula. His army consisted of a variety of Thracians (some, like those of the Rhodopes, were independent, but joined nonetheless), Getae and some Paeonians. While Sitalces managed to subjugate some of the Thracian tribes of the lower Strymon, his invasion of eastern Macedon and the Chalkidiki was less successful, as his opponents avoided open combat and simply hid behind their walls. The Odrysian army had not the means to storm them, plus winter was approaching and food supplies were running out. Furthermore, the Athenian force that was promised to them never arrived, perhaps because Athens feared the might of the unleashed Thracian kingdom. After failed negotiations with Perdiccas II, Sitalces retreated back home. Thus, after only 30 days the Odrysian invasion had come to an end.

====Seuthes I====

Sitalces was succeeded in 424 by his nephew Seuthes I after the former was killed while campaigning against the Triballi, who resided north of the western Haemus. Throughout his reign, the Odrysians did not intervene in coastal Thrace, which had now become a contested battlefield between Athens and Sparta. Athens for its part began to make heavy use of Thracian mercenaries acting as light skirmishers, the peltasts. Due to their success the Greeks soon began to raise peltast units of their own. Still, the Athenians eventually lost the Peleponnesian war and, for a few years at least, much of their influence in the northern Aegean. Seuthes I was eventually succeeded by Amadocus I, also known as Medokos, in around 410 or 405 BC.

===First signs of decay and brief revival under Cotys I (404–360 BC)===

====The civil wars between Amadocus I and Seuthes II====

By the turn of the 4th century the Odrysian kingdom showed its tendency towards fragmentation. Two rulers are known by 405: Amadocus I and Seuthes II. The historian Diodorus Siculus even called both of them &quot;kings of the Thracians&quot;, although this is most likely a misunderstanding: by 405 Seuthes II still considered Amadocus I as his suzerein. Amadocus was the son of a previous king Sitalces, while Seuthes II was the son of a Thracian chieftain named Maisades. Maisades was a descendant of king Teres, making Seuthes II and Amadocus I distant relatives. There was also an autonomous Odrysian prince in the western hinterlands of Byzantium named Teres.

Initially raised at the court of Amadocus, Seuthes was sent to eastern Thrace several years before 405. By 405 he had managed to consolidate his position over a realm stretching from Apollonia Pontica over the Strandzha to parts of the northern Propontis coast. In 400 BC he hired Greek mercenaries under Xenophon to expand his dominion at the cost of Teres and other rebels, forcing them to reacknowledge the authority of Amadocus. Due to lacking funds they left his service already after two months. Seuthes II eventually rose against Amadocus, although little is known about this insurrection. In 389 the Athenian general Thrasybulus mediated between the two parties, resulting in Seuthes II, whom Xenophon called &quot;ruler of the coast region&quot;, recognizing Amadocus&#x27; authority again.

Amadocus, who had defied Seuthes&#x27; insurrection probably due to his own popularity, died soon after 389. His successor was Hebryzelmis, about whom very little is known, but who, like Amadocus, sought the good will of Athens. Seuthes II on the other hand allied with Sparta. An Athenian inscription from the year 386/5 confirms that Hebryzelmis sent a delegation to Athens to legitimize his rule and/or gain an ally against Seuthes. However, the Athenians had little interest in another war in the region and thus limited themselves to kind words. Meanwhile, Seuthes had risen yet again against the crown. This second war went badly, as he seemingly lost all of his domains before reconquering them thanks to a mercenary army led by Iphicrates. Iphicrates subsequently married the daughter of Seuthes&#x27; son, Cotys I.

====Renaissance under Cotys I====

Cotys I succeeded Seuthes II in 383. The historian Michael Zahrnt described Cotys as &quot;the right man to strengthen the run-down Odrysian realm, vigorous, and an artful diplomat [...].&quot; Indeed, it was under him that the kingdom reached its greatest might and became a considerable political factor in the nascent Hellenistic world. He was also the only Odrysian king whose character was excessively discussed by ancient scholars, although primarily in a rather unfavourable way. While virtually nothing is known about the early years of his rule it is clear that he, together with his son-in-law Iphicrates, managed to conquer the domains of the deceased Hebryzelmis, thus uniting the Odrysian realm under his rule. In 375 he faced an invasion of the Triballi, who devastated the western parts of the realm while marching towards Abdera at the coast.

Cotys eventually set his eyes on the strategic Chersonese and the Hellespont, challenging the Athenian hegemony in the region. The Athenians were more than ready to fight for the control of the Hellespont, as it was vital for Athens&#x27; grain supply from the northern Black Sea region. An early invasion in 367 failed, but in 363/2 Cotys was more successful and repeatedly defeated several Athenian generals. Thus, the Chersonese and the Hellespont had come under direct Odrysian rule. This achievement, however, proved shortlived: much to Athens relief, Cotys I was eventually murdered in 360/59.

===Disintegration and conquest by Macedon (360–340 BC)===
====The three kingdoms====

The death of Cotys, almost contemporary to the coronation of the talented Philip II of Macedon, marked the beginning of the kingdom&#x27;s downfall. The Odrysian state was divided among three competing kings: Cersebleptes, the son of Cotys, ruled the eastern parts beyond the lower Hebros and Tonzos; Amadocus II, perhaps a son of Amadocus I, ruled central Thrace between Maroneia and the Meritsa; Berisades controlled the western part from Maroneia in the east to the Styrmon in the west.

Cersebleptes was the most ambitious of the three. He continued his father&#x27;s war against Athens for the Chersonese, while also striving to reunite the Odrysian kingdom. His attempts proved futile, for Amadocus II and Berisades, who received support from Athens, resisted his attacks. In 357 he was forced to accept a peace treaty that sealed the division of the Odrysian state. An inscription from Athens describes said treaty. First, Cersebleptes had to cease his hostilities in the Cheresonese. Second, all three kings and Athens agreed to share their tributes received from the Greek colonies along the Aegean and the Hellespont. Third, the kings promised to enter an alliance with Athens and both sides had to provide each other with military support if tributary Greek colonies revolted. Cersebleptes, however, soon quit that treaty and continued his war in the Chersonese.

====Conquest by Philip II====


As early as 359, the year of his coronation, Philip II of Macedon I contacted a &quot;Thracian king&quot; to persuade him to not harbour a Macedonian pretender to the throne. This king is probably to be identified with the western Odrysian king Berisades. A year later he unified Macedon and subjugated the Paeonians to the northeast. In these early years he did not bother much with Thrace yet, as he regarded the infighting Odrysian kingdoms as no threat for his rule. A first push into the kingdom of Berisades and his successor Cetriporis occurred in 357/6, when he conquered Amphipolis and Crenides. The latter was made into a garrison town called Philippi that was to serve as a launch pad for future invasions into the interior. Cetriporis allied himself with the kings of Paeonia and Illyria, but Philip II defeated them one by one. Cetriporis was allowed to keep his kingdom, at least for a few more years.

Cersebleptes continued his attempts to unite the Odrysian kingdoms: in 353/4 he and Philip discussed the invasion of the kingdom of Amadocus II and the Athenian domains in Thrace, while around a year later he marched against the kingdom of Cetriporis. Meanwhile, Athens feared a possible alliance between Philip and Cersebleptes and decided to make an example by conquering the town of Sestos and eradicating its population. Intimidated, Cersebleptes renounced his claims on much of the Chersonese and allied with Athens. This was unacceptable for Philip, who allied with Amadocus II and marched against Cersebleptes. After besieging him in his residence in Heraion Teichos in 351, he forced the Thracian king to surrender and took his son as a hostage. Around this time, Philip also abolished Cetriporis&#x27; kingdom and deposed Amadocus II in favour of Teres II.

After these events, the Thracian front remained peaceful until 347 or early 346, when the Athenians again attempted to strengthen their presence in Thrace, which they probably did at the request of Cersebleptes. Macedon expelled the Athenian garrisons and defeated the Odrysians, preventing yet again a Thraco-Athenian alliance against him. As a result of this campaign Philip also put the Aeagean coast as far east as Acontisma (not the banks of the Nestos river as often assumed) under direct Macedonian administration.

A few years later Cersebleptes allied with Teres II and invaded the Chersonese, which was now under Macedon&#x27;s protection. After asking the Persian king Artaxerxes III to cut the support of the Ionian towns for Cersebleptes, Philip finally felt confident enough to begin his most ambitious project so far: the conquest of inland Thrace in the form of a large campaign that would last from 342 to 340. Few details are known about this campaign. It seems to have started in May or June, when Philip&#x27;s army penetrated the interior by marching upstream the Martisa river. The Odrysians resisted valiantly and confronted the Macedonians in many battles. Philip faced several setbacks and even seems to have lost at least one battle. By the spring of 341, fighting was still raging and Philip was forced to call in reinforcements. Although detailed evidence is lacking he finally managed to improve his situation and defeated Cersebleptes and Teres at some point between the second half of 341 and the first half of 340.

====Rise of the Getic kingdom====
The Getae, a northern Thracian people located between the northeastern foothills of the Haemus range and the lower Danube and the Black Sea, had been part of the Odrysian realm since Teres I, even though it is not clear how tightly they were actually incorporated into the state. When and how the Getae became independent is not discussed in the available sources. Perhaps they became independent during the rule of Cotys I or after his death in 360. Rich funeral treasures from the second half of the 4th century, like those of Agighiol, Peretu or Borovo, attest to the increasing wealth of the Getic elite. Several artefacts seem to have originated in the Odrysian kingdom and may well have been prestige gifts.

By the middle of the 4th century there existed a Getic kingdom that was to thrive for a century. The Getic capital was Helis, which has been identified with the archaeological site of Sboryanovo, which was founded in the 330s or early 320s and housed around 10.000 inhabitants. It seems that the Getae also became active in Muntenia north of the Danube, a region that would come to constitute a part of the &quot;Dacia&quot; of imperial Roman historiography. The first Getic king to appear in the sources was Cothelas, who married his daughter Meda to Philip II, thus concluding an alliance between the two states. This probably happened during or shortly after Philip&#x27;s conquest of the Odrysians. The kingdom survived two wars with Lysimachus and the Celtic invasion in around 280, but eventually disintegrated a few decades later. Helis/Sboryanovo was completely destroyed by an earthquake in the middle of the 3rd century.

===The rebellion of Seuthes and the kingdom of Seuthopolis ( 330 – second quarter of the 3rd century BC)===
====Macedonian Thrace====

The conquest of the Odrysian kingdoms doubled the size of the domains ruled by Philip II, even though inland Thrace was not transformed into a Macedonian province, but was put under the loose control of a &quot;Strategos&quot;. Local Thracian rulers who seemed trustworthy were allowed to rule on Macedonian behalf, granted that they would pay a tithe and provide troops. Such troops, generally called &quot;Thracians&quot; or &quot;Odrysians&quot;, participated in the Macedonian conquest of Persia under Philip&#x27;s successor Alexander the Great and were probably commanded by Odrysian noblemen. Philip founded several towns in Thrace to ease Macedonian rule, most prominently Cabyle and Philippopolis. The situation south of the Haemus remained largely stable for the next few years, albeit even here, Macedon never managed to impose its rule over all Thracian tribes. Macedon&#x27;s rule was precarious and a potential Odrysian upstarter could count on the support of much of the disgruntled population.

====Seuthes III and the Odrysian revival====

With Alexander&#x27;s absence in Asia, the &quot;Strategoi&quot; of Thrace engaged in rebellions and failed expeditions against the Getae, greatly unsettling the country in the process. At the end of the 330s or in the mid-320s (the dating is not entirely clear), a certain Seuthes, later known as Seuthes III, instigated a Thracian rebellion. He seems to have been an Odrysian and may have been associated with the royal house of Cersebleptes, although his social background must remain speculation.

After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323, one of his bodyguards named Lysimachus was appointed as the satrap of Thrace. Soon after his arrival he faced off with Seuthes, who had rallied much of Thrace around his banner. Seuthes&#x27; goal seems to have been the revival of an independent Odrysian state. A battle ensued between him and Lysimachus, which Lysimachus barely and by no means decisively won. Both sides prepared for a second conflict, but the primary source for this event, Diodorus Siculus, provides no details on its outcome.

In any case, both parties eventually reached a settlement, restricting Seuthes to the interior and Lysimachus to the coastal regions of the Aegean and Black Sea. There is no evidence for Lysimachus vassalizing Seuthes. Thrace north of the Rhodopes probably remained outside of Lysimachus&#x27; reach, as he may have regarded its pacification not worth the money and manpower. In 313 Seuthes allied with revolting Greek towns on the western shore of the Black Sea, but Lysimachus defeated this alliance. It is possible that to guarantee the peace between the two opponents, Seuthes married a daughter of Lysimachus named Berenice. Afterwards, there is no evidence for another confrontation between the two.

Seuthes was keen to establish a Hellenistic kingdom, although he avoided to label himself as king on his coins. Probably after the death of Alexander in 323, Seuthes founded a town at the Tonzos river, near modern Kazanlak. He named it after himself: Seuthopolis. The town was primarily based on contemporary Macedonian foundations and showed heavy Greek influences. Seuthopolis probably acted as the capital of Seuthes&#x27; kingdom. The size and power of this kingdom should not be overestimated, as its influence was most likely limited to the hinterland of Seuthopolis, in particular the valley between the Rhodopes in the south to the Haemus in the north and the Syrmus in the west to the upper Tonzos in the east. Thus, his realm only covered the northwestern fringes of the former Odrysian empire. Seuthes also only issued bronze coins, which were insufficient to challenge the Macedonian economic hegemony and its royal mintings in more precious metals.

====Fall of Seuthopolis====

It is unknown when Seuthes III died, with estimations ranging from the end of the 4th century to the 280s. Coins minted in his name include overstruck coins of Cassander (died 297) and Lysimachus (died 281), implying that his coins were produced until the early years of the 3rd century BC. Seuthes was symbolically buried in the tumulus of Golyama Kosmatka, without his actual corpse. It may well be that he had been killed in battle, perhaps fighting against Lysimachus or with him as an ally.

A long inscription from Seuthopolis attests to the decline of the fortunes of the town and the trouble in Seuthes&#x27; household. It mentions the wife of Seuthes, Berenice, and their four (probably underage) sons Hebryzelmis, Teres, Satocos and Satalas. The document was issued in the name of Berenice and includes the phrase &quot;when Seuthes was in good health&quot;, which implies that by the time of writing, he was either dead or dying and that Berenice had taken the rule. The inscription describes negotiations between Berenice and Spartokos, the ruler of Cabyle, a town once founded by Philip II. Indeed, Cabyle had not remained a Macedonian fort for long, but began to mint coins and developed into a city-state with considerable influence. Spartokos is known from several coins minted after 281 where he is addressed as king (&quot;basileus&quot;).

Although not mentioned in the Seuthopolis inscription and known only from a few coins and an inscription in a grave from Kazanlak, Seuthes seemed to have another son named Roigos, who eventually became king. The fate of Seuthes&#x27; dynasty remains enigmatic. Other Thracian monarchs recorded in sources from the 3rd century, like Cotys or Scostocus, can not be proved to have been Odrysian, even if they are often labelled as such by modern authors.

The end of Seuthopolis is a matter of debate, but it is clear that the town was destroyed still in the first half of the 3rd century. According to some scholars it was conquered by the Celts in the 270s. The Celts were ravaging much of the Balkan Peninsula since the early 270s and also led numerous incursions into Thrace. In  278 and led by Comontorius, they eventually founded a kingdom in eastern Thrace centered around Tylis. A newer theory proposes the destruction of the town in the 250s, based on a revamped dating of pottery, numismatic evidence and the presence of several Celtic artefacts. The archaeological evidence also shows the employment of siege artillery, which is unlikely to have been utilized by Celts. It may therefore be that Seuthopolis was not destroyed by the Celts, but by the Seleucid king Antiochus II, who campaigned in the Thracian interior in around 252.

===The Odrysians after 250 BC===
Most modern historians believe that the Odrysian kingdom continued to exist throughout the Hellenistic and the early Imperial period, when it became a Roman vassal state. However, the evidence for this assumption is in fact very slim. Throughout the remainder of the 3rd century, Thrace remained fragmented into various political entities. In the interior ruled various badly known Thracian dynasts. In the east was the kingdom of Tylis, a Celtic-dominated predator state which existence was based on blackmailing tribute and that was eventually destroyed by a Thracian revolt or attack soon after 220. In the southeast and based at the town of Lysimachia, the Seleucids established themselves under Antiochus II (r. 261–246), who relied on allied Thracian dynasts to expand his influence deep into the interior. After his death in 246 the Seleucid presence was replaced by that of the Ptolemies, who established a satrapy in coastal Thrace. An Odrysian kingdom, however, is not described in the sources.

In the last years of the 3rd century, Macedonia under king Philip V began a renewed expansion to the east, exploiting the weakness of the Ptolemies after the death of Ptolemy IV. While Philip&#x27;s initial focus was on coastal Thrace, he also led a campaign into the interior. Temporarily losing his Thracian holdings after the end of the Second Macedonian War in 197, he reconquered most of them a decade later, while again campaigning in the Thracian interior. In 184 or 183 he pushed into the plains of the upper Hebros, defeated the Odrysians and other local tribes and conquered Philipopolis, although the Odrysians reconquered the town soon afterwards. It may be noteworthy that no Odrysian king is mentioned. While in 181, Philip was still climbing the Haemus in northern Thrace, his Thracian empire collapsed with his death two years later.

Between 171 and 168, Philip&#x27;s heir Perseus engaged the Roman Republic in the Third Macedonian War. Perseus&#x27; most trusted ally in this war was the Thracian king Cotys, whom the historian Polybius calls an Odrysian. He fought in the battles of Callinicus and Pydna, but eventually became a Roman ally after the war. Perhaps he is identical with the Cotys mentioned by the historian Strabo. However, his Odrysian background has been doubted, as the account of Polybius, the only remaining source (minus Livy, who relied on Polybius), called him an Odrysian only once, while also calling the Getic king Dromichaetes an Odrysian. It may thus be likely that Polybius used &quot;Odrysian&quot; as a synonym for &quot;Thracian&quot;. Furthermore, after the war Cotys was described as being active in the hinterland of Abdera at the Aegean coast, implying that he was rather a Sapaean king, who are known to have resided in the Rhodopes. His identity must remain uncertain. It is a fact, however, that Cotys was the last king in the sources to be explicitly labelled an &quot;Odrysian&quot;. There is also no evidence that Odrysians had any affiliations with the royal houses of the Sapaeans and Asti of the 1st century BC.

By the middle of the 1st century BC, the Romans dominated coastal Thrace, while the most important Thracian tribes were the Sapaeans and the Asti.
The Romans decided not to implement an administration in the Thracian interior, but instead relied on indirect influence via a large, Hellenized client kingdom resembling the Odrysian kingdom of old. Probably soon after the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, the Romans abolished the Asti dynasty and established the Sapaeans in Bizye, the capital of the former. The Sapaeans of Bizye created a large kingdom loyal to Rome and even expanded into the interior. Little is known about how the Sapaeans administered this region, although they made Philippopolis a royal residence. In 21 AD king Rhoemetalces II took refuge in Philippopolis when he was confronted with a rebellion, among them Odrysians. While the historian Tacitus described them as powerful, their uprising failed due to their bad coordination. The Romans eventually dissolved the Sapaean kingdom in 45/6 and turned it into the province of Thracia.

==Kingship and the nature of Odrysian rule==

Although covering almost a third of the entire Balkan peninsula at its peak, the Odrysian kingdom is unlikely to have had state-like institutions before the reign of Seuthes III. In general, the Odrysian kingship was heavily influenced by the Persian court, while also bearing many similarities to the one practiced in Macedon. Unlike in the contemporary Greek city-states, the Odrysian kings needed to legitimize their rule by military prowess, religion and gifts. The royal gift exchange, a practice originally adopted from the Persian court, was especially important for legitimation. Thucydides noted that the total tribute of 400 talents of gold and silver generated under king Seuthes I was distributed among Seuthes as well as the &quot;chief men and nobles of the Odrysae&quot;. Several inscribed silver vessels mention king Cotys I and Cersebleptes and were most likely gifts or tribute. While the king received valuable gifts like gold, silver, textiles or horses, he was also expected to distribute gifts like artefacts, women or land to earn the loyalty and achieve the expansion of his military retinue. Such systems are inevitably unstable, royal authority would always remain rather fluid.

Due to the fragmentary nature of the remaining sources, the royal court and the administration of the kingdom must remain largely obscure. It can be assumed that, as in early Macedon, the Odrysian kings formed the heart of the realm and controlled the policy and the minting of coins, appointed loyal deputies and commanded the troops on the battlefield. The realm was essentially the king&#x27;s estate. Below the king was an elite of horse warriors and administrators deriving not only from the royal court, but also from rival tribes. Thucydides called said local rulers &quot;paradynasteuontes&quot;, meaning &quot;those who share power&quot;. A similar elite class loyal only to the king, the &quot;hetairoi&quot;, could also be found in Macedon. The Odrysian kingdom appears to have been rather decentralized, consisting of many different regional elites vying for power. Their rule over their subjects, who lived in scattered hamlets, was very loose and exercised mainly through raiding and demanding tribute.

There is no evidence that the early Odrysian kings had a fixed capital. Instead, they probably maintained a mobile court, moving throughout the kingdom and residing in fortified residences. These small fortified places, which the Greeks called , were the backbones of the Thracian aristocracy in a society that did not build towns or cities. This changed somewhat in the late 4th century, when Seuthes III founded Seuthopolis, marking the establishment of early state-like institutions which were probably inspired by those of Hellenistic Macedon. Seuthopolis&#x27; size always remained quite small, housing not more than 1.000 inhabitants. It is very likely that it was the home of the kingdom&#x27;s aristocracy, while the common population continued to live outside the city walls, still practicing the agro-pastoral subsistence economy of old.

==Army==


When Sitalces&#x27; army invaded Macedon he supposedly fielded an army numbering 150.000 men, which is likely an inflated number. Around 100 years later, when Seuthes III confronted Lysimachus, the numbers had shrunk to 28.000 men. A considerable part of these armies were horsemen. Of Sitalces&#x27; army, every third warrior was a horseman, who were provided by the Odrysians and the Getae, while the army of Seuthes III had 8.000 riders, probably all Odrysians. The majority of Sitalces&#x27; infantry was described as being of rather low quality and was certainly composed of ill-organized levies. It therefore appears that warfare remained a heroic pursuit worthy only of the aristocracy, while military training for the commoners was considered unfitting. Despite this, the Thracian infantry made a great impression on the Greeks, who hired them as mercenaries. Meanwhile, the Odrysian kings made use of Greek mercenary commanders like Xenophon or Iphicrates, while Greek towns inside Thrace were defended by the colonists themselves.

Initially, the Odrysian army was divided into light infantry and light cavalry. The infantry used bows, slings, spears, swords, axes and light crescent-shaped shields called &quot;pelte&quot;, giving these warriors their name: &quot;peltasts&quot;. Round and oval shields were, however, also utilized. A weapon primarily found in the western and central Rhodoes was the Rhomphaia. Except of slings, the cavalry used the same weapons as the infantry. In the later 5th century the Thracian cavalry began to adopt armour. The employed helmets were of the Chalcidian, Phrygian / Thracian and Corinthian types, of which the Chalcidian type seems to have been the most popular. The earliest torso armour was a type of primitive muscle cuirass of cylindrical form that had long fallen out of use elsewhere. Leather and linen armour was also worn. In the 4th century scale armour became popular, while greaves were also adopted at that time. Finally, there is also evidence that the Thracians employed siege artillery, in particular catapults.

== Culture ==
Odrysian crafts and metalworking were largely a product of Persian influence. Thracians as Dacians and Illyrians all decorated themselves with status-enhancing tattoos. Thracian warfare was affected also by Celts and the Triballi had adopted Celtic equipment. Thracian clothing is regarded for its quality and texture and was made up of hemp, flax or wool. Their clothing resembled that of the Scythians including jackets with coloured edges, pointed shoes and the Getai tribe were so similar to the Scythians that they were often confused with them. The nobility and some soldiers wore caps. There was a mutual influence between the Greeks and the Thracians. Greek customs and fashions contributed to the recasting of east Balkan society. Among the nobility Greek fashions in dress, ornament and military equipment were popular. Unlike the Greeks, the Thracians often wore trousers. Thracian kings were influenced by Hellenization. Greek as a lingua franca had been spoken at least by some members of the royal household in the fifth century BC and became the language of administrators; the Greek alphabet was adopted as the new Thracian script.

== Archaeology ==
Residences and temples of the Odrysian kingdom have been found, particularly around Starosel in the Sredna Gora mountains. Archaeologists have uncovered the northeastern wall of the Thracian kings&#x27; residence, 13 m in length and preserved up to 2 m in height. They also found the names of Cleobulus and Anaxandros, Philip II of Macedon&#x27;s generals who led the assault on the Odrysian kingdom.

== List of Odrysian kings ==
The list below includes the known Odrysian kings of Thrace, but much of it is conjectural, based on incomplete sources, and the varying interpretation of ongoing numismatic and archaeological discoveries. Various other Thracian kings (some of them possibly non-Odrysian) are included as well. Odrysian kings, though called Kings of Thrace, never exercised sovereignty over all of Thrace. Control varied according to tribal relationships. Odrysian kings (names are presented in Greek or Latin forms):
* Teres I, son of ? Odryses, (480/450–430 BC)
* Sparatocus, son of Teres I (c. 465?-by 431 BC)
* Sitalces, son of Teres I (by 431–424 BC)
* Seuthes I, son of Sparatocus (424–396 BC)
* Maesades, father of Seuthes II, &quot;local ruler in eastern Thrace&quot;
* Teres II, &quot;local ruler in eastern Thrace&quot;
* Metocus (= ? Amadocus I), son of ? Sitalces
* Amadocus I, son of ? Metocus (unless identical to him) or of Sitalces (410–390 BC)
* Seuthes II, son of Maesades, descendant of Teres I, &quot;king in southern districts&quot; (405–391 BC)
* Hebryzelmis, son or brother of ? Seuthes I (390–384 BC)
* Cotys I, son of ? Seuthes I or Seuthes II (384–359 BC)
* Cersobleptes, son of Cotys I, &quot;king in eastern Thrace&quot; (359-341 BC)
* Berisades, rival of Cersobleptes, &quot;king in western Thrace in Strimos&quot; (359–352 BC)
* Amadocus II, rival of Cersobleptes, &quot;king in central Thrace in Chersonese &amp; Maroneia&quot; (359–351 BC)
* Cetriporis, son of Berisades, &quot;king in western Thrace in Strimos&quot; (358–347 BC)
* Teres III, son of ? Amadocus II, &quot;king in central Thrace in Chersonese &amp; Maroneia&quot; (351–342 BC)
* Seuthes III, rebel against Macedonian rule (by 324–after 312)
* Roigos, son of Seuthes (III?) (early 3rd century BC ?)
* The survival of a specifically &quot;Odrysian&quot; state beyond the early 3rd century BC is considered debatable.
* Cotys IV, son of Seuthes V (by 171-after 166 BC), last king described explicitly as Odrysian in the sources.

==Odrysian Kings: a possible family tree==









* Seuthes II maybe father of Cotys I
* Teres II/ΙΙΙ maybe father of Seuthes III
* Cersoblepres maybe father of Seuthes III
* Roigos, son of Seuthes III, maybe king Roigos, son of Seuthes IV
* Raizdos maybe identical to Roigos

<text>Peter Joseph Vermes (; born November 21, 1966) is an American professional soccer coach and former player. He is currently the head coach of Sporting Kansas City in Major League Soccer.

Entering the 2023 MLS season, Vermes is currently the longest-tenured head coach in MLS and has won four major trophies as a manager, the second most of all active coaches in MLS.

As a player, Vermes spent several seasons playing in Hungary, the Netherlands, before establishing himself as a defender in Major League Soccer, playing for MetroStars, Colorado Rapids and the Kansas City Wizards.
Vermes was also a regular member of the United States national team throughout the 1990s, and represented his country at the 1988 Summer Olympics, the 1990 FIFA World Cup and the 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

On April 4, 2013, Vermes was elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

==Youth and college==
Vermes was born in Willingboro, New Jersey. He grew up in Delran Township, New Jersey and played high school soccer at Delran High School. He graduated in 1984, having scored 109 goals. In 1999, he was named by &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; as one of the top ten New Jersey high school soccer players of the 1980s.

Vermes played his first year in college on the men&#x27;s soccer team at Loyola College in Maryland under head coach Bill Sento. Vermes then transferred and played three years of college soccer at Rutgers University, from 1985 to 1987. In his final season, Vermes scored 21 goals and 10 assists for the team, finishing a first-team All-American, as well as runner-up for the National Player of the Year Award. During that season, Vermes led Rutgers to their first victory in the NCAA Tournament in 26 years, scoring the winning goal in a contest against Seton Hall University.

==Playing career==
===Professional===
After graduating, Vermes went to Europe, where he played with Rába ETO FC of Hungary in 1989 and Volendam of the Dutch Eredivisie in 1990. In May 1991, Vermes returned to the United States and played three games, scoring a single goal against the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the American Professional Soccer League. He then moved to Spain where he played for Spanish Second Division club Figueres from 1991 to 1995.

Like many American players, Vermes returned to the United States to join the recently founded domestic league Major League Soccer. In January 1995, he signed with the new league that would not begin league play until 1996. Therefore, MLS loaned Vermes to the New York Fever of the USISL where he played 25 games, scoring 16 goals in the 1995 season. In 1996, Vermes was drafted by the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in the third round of the MLS Inaugural Draft (29th overall) and captained the team in its first season. Although he played the most minutes of any MetroStar that year, the MetroStars traded Vermes on February 3, 1997, to the Colorado Rapids for Kerry Zavagnin. Vermes would play three years for the Rapids before being traded again, this time to the Kansas City Wizards with Matt McKeon for Scott Vermillion and a player allocation.

With the Wizards, Vermes helped the Wizards finish the season first in the league with a 16–7–9 record, having allowed only 29 goals in 32 games, and eventually winning the MLS Cup. Vermes was recognized as the MLS Defender of the Year, while his teammate Tony Meola won both the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year and MLS MVP awards. Vermes played two more seasons with the Wizards, struggling with injuries but playing every game he was healthy for, before announcing his retirement at the end of the 2002 season.

===International===
Vermes received his first cap May 14, 1988, against Colombia, and would in all receive 66 caps for the team, playing in the 1988 Olympics, the 1990 World Cup and the 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup. In the 1990 World Cup, he nearly bagged a goal against Italy with a shot against Italian goalkeeper Walter Zenga. After seeing his playing time wane with the team in late 1993 and early 1994, Vermes was one of the final cuts from the 1994 U.S. World Cup team. He later said he thought that his outspoken comments had doomed him politically. A forward early in his career, his performance in defense in MLS led to his comeback to the National team in that position after years of absence, but he was cut again from the U.S. roster in January 1998.

Vermes was named the 1988 U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year and U.S. Olympic Player of the Year.

In 1989, he scored six goals for the U.S. Futsal team, which took third place, at the FIFA Futsal World Championship in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. He ended his futsal career with 11 caps and 7 goals.

==Coaching career==

===Kansas City===

Vermes was appointed as the technical Director for the Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer in November 2006.

He was named interim coach of the Wizards on August 4, 2009, one day after predecessor Curt Onalfo was fired by the team. The team was in sixth place in the MLS Eastern Conference with a 5–6–7 record. Vermes would lead to the Wizards to a 3–7–2 record down the stretch.
Following the season, the Wizards removed the interim tag from his title.

In 2012, Vermes won his first piece of silverware as a head coach, leading the renamed Sporting Kansas City (changed from the Kansas City Wizards in 2010) to a penalty shootout win over three-time defending champions Seattle Sounders FC to win the 2012 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. The following year, Vermes led the club to the MLS Cup, where they beat Real Salt Lake, also in a penalty shoot-out. This makes him the only person to ever win the MLS Cup as both a player and a coach with the same team.

Vermes won his third trophy as Sporting KC coach when his side won the 2015 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup by defeating the Philadelphia Union on penalties at Talen Energy Stadium. Two years later, Vermes added the 2017 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup to his trophy haul when Sporting KC beat the New York Red Bulls 2–1 at Children&#x27;s Mercy Park.

On August 4, 2018, Vermes coached his 302nd regular-season match – a 1–0 victory over the Houston Dynamo – becoming the all-time leader in games coached with one club in MLS history.

On October 3, 2020, Vermes won his 150th regular-season match, with a 2–1 victory over the Houston Dynamo, becoming only the 5th coach in MLS history to do so.

In February 2023, Vermes signed a five-year extension with Sporting Kansas City through the 2028 MLS season.

===Other coaching and activities===
Vermes worked as a broadcaster for the San Jose Earthquakes. Vermes serves as the technical Director of Coaching for the Blue Valley Soccer Club in Overland Park, Kansas, and was an assistant coach for the U.S. Under-20 National Team.

==Personal life==

Vermes&#x27;s parents immigrated to the United States from Hungary as refugees during the 1956 revolution. His father, Michael, was a professional footballer for Budapest Honvéd FC and operated an indoor soccer training center in New Jersey after immigrating. Peter has two brothers and one sister.

Peter married his wife Susan, who he met in high school, in 1990. The couple have two children.

Vermes was arrested for a suspected DUI on August 24, 2010, by police in Gardner, Kansas. He accepted one year of probation and the charge was dropped. The incident was mocked by Philadelphia Union supporters during a match in September 2010, with the Sons of Ben singing the entire folk song &quot;99 Bottles of Beer&quot; during the team&#x27;s match against Kansas City.

<text>Kingda Ka was a hydraulically-launched steel roller coaster located at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey, United States. Manufactured by Intamin and designed by Werner Stengel, Kingda Ka opened as the in the world on May 21, 2005, surpassing Top Thrill Dragster. Both were made with similar designs, although Kingda Ka&#x27;s layout added an airtime hill on the return portion of the track. It was also the second strata coaster ever built, exceeding in height. 

The ride featured a hydraulic launch mechanism which accelerated the train to in 3.5 seconds. Although its speed record was broken in 2010 by Formula Rossa at Ferrari World, Kingda Ka remained the tallest in the world throughout its operational lifetime with a tower element.

On November 14, 2024, following months of rumors and speculation regarding the future of the attraction, Six Flags Great Adventure announced the permanent closure of Kingda Ka. Demolition of the ride began in January 2025 and concluded the following month with the implosion of the main tower.

==History==
On September 29, 2004, it was announced that Kingda Ka would be added to the Six Flags Great Adventure amusement park in 2005. This announcement occurred at an event held for roller coaster enthusiasts and the media. The event revealed the park&#x27;s goal to build &quot;the tallest and fastest roller coaster on earth&quot;, reaching and accelerating up to in 3.5 seconds. The ride would be part of the Golden Kingdom, an themed area being developed at Six Flags Great Adventure. Six Flags CEO Kieran Burke said: &quot;This is the first step in a process of really transforming Six Flags Great Adventure from the largest regional theme park in the world to a true regional destination.&quot;
Intamin subcontracted Stakotra to assist with construction. On January 13, 2005, workers completed Kingda Ka&#x27;s tower with a topping out ceremony. For the ceremony, one 50-story crane was used to hoist two workers to the top of the ride; another crane lifted a steel beam, with an American flag, to the ride&#x27;s pinnacle. The ride was still under construction when the park opened for the season in March 2005. The attraction was originally scheduled to open on April 23, 2005, but its opening was delayed to May 21, as the park stated that more time was needed to complete testing. A media event was held two days prior on May 19, 2005.

Upon its opening, Kingda Ka became the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world, taking both world records from Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point. Intamin designed both Kingda Ka and Top Thrill Dragster, and the two share a similar design and layout that differs primarily by the theme and the additional hill featured on Kingda Ka. Both rides were built by Stakotra and installed by Martin &amp; Vleminckx. Though Kingda Ka was popular among both the general public and roller coaster enthusiasts, its use of relatively new technology meant that Six Flags Great Adventure had to hire a dedicated maintenance team for the ride. Because of maintenance issues, the ride was closed for almost two months during its first season, and it was closed for an additional three weeks at the beginning of the 2006 season. Kingda Ka continued to be the world&#x27;s fastest coaster until Formula Rossa at Ferrari World opened in November 2010. 

On August 29, 2013, Six Flags Great Adventure officially announced for the 2014 season. The new attraction was attached to the Kingda Ka coaster. The drop tower features three gondolas integrated into the existing structure which was also built by Intamin. Kingda Ka closed at the start of the 2014 season in order to construct Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom on to Kingda Ka. Kingda Ka reopened on weekends on Memorial Day Weekend and fully reopened when Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom was completed on July 4, 2014.

In late 2024, rumors began circulating that Kingda Ka was slated to be closed permanently. The closure was initially speculated to occur after the 2025 season, but as the end of the season approached, a 2024 closure became increasingly prevalent among the rumors. With the park making no acknowledgement of the rumors, and the last day of seasonal operations being November 10, many fans of the ride visited the park on the days prior, assuming that the ride would not reopen. On November 14, 2024, Six Flags Great Adventure confirmed that the ride had permanently closed. Kingda Ka is to be removed to make way for a new &quot;multi-record breaking launched roller coaster&quot; with an anticipated opening in 2026. Along with Kingda Ka, the park would also close , Green Lantern, the Parachute Drop ride, and Twister (a HUSS Top Spin flat ride), to make room for the new attraction.

===Demolition===
On December 18, 2024, about a month after the official closure announcement, the park applied to the local government for a work permit; the comment on the permit states &quot;[demolition] of Kingda Ka / Zumanjaro ride.&quot; Later that month, the park sent out a project bid notice for &quot;demolition and controlled implosion&quot; of the ride. Demolition of Kingda Ka began on January 20, 2025, with the removal of track pieces and supports. The main tower, which was the last remaining part of the ride, was imploded on February 28, 2025 at 6:50 am.

==Ride experience==

===Queue===
Kingda Ka originally featured a detailed and elaborate queue line that ran between the launch and brakes of the coaster. Guests would enter the ride, then walk down a narrow pathway where they would eventually cross under the launch track. A themed tunnel was built where guests crossed under the launch to ensure safety. Guests would then enter a series of three switchbacks, with the third being underneath a permanent structure. This structure featured poles with detailed carvings of animals to help immerse guests into the Golden Kingdom. Following this final series of switchbacks, guests would approach the station, where the line would divide in two to equally fill both sides of Kingda Ka&#x27;s station. This queue was designed to handle the large crowds the park was anticipating Kingda Ka would draw. After an incident in the ride&#x27;s opening year that occurred right where guests crossed under the launch, the decision was made to not use this queue to ensure guest safety. From that point forward, the overflow queue would be used as the permanent queue. Parts of the original queue are still visible from Kingda Ka&#x27;s station.

Guests passed under the jungle-themed entrance sign and entered the queue line, which was surrounded by bamboo, which augments the jungle-themed music that played in the background. Along the way, there were safety and warning signs about the ride. Following a long straight section, guests turned left and headed into a switchback section. Guests walked through some curved paths before entering the station.

===Layout===
After the train had been locked and checked, it moved slowly out of the station to the launch area, then passed through a switch track which allowed four trains on two tracks to load simultaneously. When the signal was given to launch, the train rolled back slightly so that the catch car could latch on to the middle car, and the brakes retracted on the launch track. As the brake fins were retracting, a recording announced: &quot;Arms down, head back, hold on!&quot; The train was launched approximately five seconds later.

When the train was in position, the hydraulic launch mechanism accelerated it from in 3.5 seconds. The hydraulic launch motor was capable of producing 20,800 peak horsepower (15.5 MW). At the end of the launch track, the train climbed the main tower (top hat) and rolled 90 degrees to the right before reaching a height of . It then descended straight down through a 270-degree, clockwise spiral. It climbed the second hill of , producing a moment of weightlessness before being smoothly brought to a stop by the magnetic brakes; it then made a left-hand U-turn and entered the station. The ride lasted 28 seconds from the start of the launch. The track measured about long.

===Trains and station===
Kingda Ka&#x27;s four trains were color-coded for easy identification (green, dark blue, teal, and orange) and were numbered; the four colors were also used for the seats and restraints. Each train seated 18 people (two per row). The rear car had one row, while the rest had two. The rear row of each car was positioned higher than its front row for better visibility. Kingda Ka&#x27;s over-the-shoulder restraint system consisted of a thick, rigid lap bar and two flexible over-the-shoulder restraints.

Kingda Ka&#x27;s station had two parallel tracks with switch tracks at the entrance and exit. Each of the station&#x27;s tracks is designed to accommodate two trains, so each of the four trains could be operated from its own station. Because all of Kingda Ka&#x27;s trains were mechanically identical and able to load and unload at each of the four individual station bays, the original plan was for all trains to operate at the same time, and for each train to load and unload at its own station. Trains on one side would be loaded while trains on the other side would be launched with an employee directing riders in line to a particular side, where they could then choose to sit anywhere within the train.

===Theme===
Kingda Ka was located in the jungle-themed area of the park known as The Golden Kingdom. The ride portrayed a mythical Bengal tiger named after one that was housed in the nearby Temple of the Tiger attraction, an interactive exhibit that was closed in 2010.

===Rollbacks===

A train may have occasionally experienced a rollback following a launch. A rollback occurs when the train fails to make it over the top of the tower and descends back down the side it was launched. Kingda Ka included retractable magnetic brakes on its launch track to prevent a train from rolling back all the way into the loading station (and potentially colliding with the next about-to-be-launched train).

==Incidents==
On June 8, 2005, a bolt failed inside a trough through which the launch cable travels. This caused the liner to come loose, creating friction on the cable and preventing the train from accelerating to the correct speed. The cable rubbing against the trough caused sparks and shards of metal to fly out from the bottom of the train. The ride was closed for almost two months following the incident. Damage occurred to the launch cable, which was frayed and required replacement, including minor damage to seals and brake fins. The incident caused stress on a number of fins, and Six Flags did not have enough replacement fins. Extra brake fins were ordered, and the ride had to undergo thorough testing following the repair. Kingda Ka reopened on August 4.

Kingda Ka was struck by lightning in May 2009 and suffered serious damage. The ride was closed for three months for repairs and reopened on August 21, 2009.

On August 27, 2011, Kingda Ka suffered unspecified damage shortly before Hurricane Irene, and Six Flags Great Adventure did not open. It is unknown whether additional damage occurred due to the storm, but the coaster was damaged to the extent that it could not run before Irene. Kingda Ka remained closed until the start of the 2012 operating season on April 5.

Shortly before 5:00p.m. on July 26, 2012, a young boy was sent to the hospital after suffering minor injuries from being struck by a bird during normal operation. The ride resumed normal operation shortly after the incident.

In 2019, a guest sued Six Flags and Intamin in U.S. federal court, claiming that tall riders could be subjected to &quot;extreme speed and torqueing forces&quot; and that the harnesses could also cause injuries. According to the guest, he had suffered multiple back injuries after riding Kingda Ka in 2017. This guest was tall, three inches below the ride&#x27;s posted height limit of . Both Six Flags and Intamin filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was partially granted and partially denied in 2020.

<text>Wahome Mutahi (24 October 1954 – 22 July 2003) was a humourist from Kenya. He was popularly known as &quot;Whispers&quot; after the name of the column he wrote for &quot;The Daily Nation&quot; from 1982 to 2003, offering a satirical view of the trials and tribulations of Kenyan life.

==Beginnings==
Mutahi was equally well known in theatre where he wrote and acted in English- and Kikuyu-language plays that caricatured Kenya&#x27;s society and politics using his company &quot;Igiza Productions&quot;. There is a memorial bust of him at the Kenya National Theatre. Outside of Kenya, he wrote humour columns for Ugandan publications &quot;The Monitor&quot; and &quot;Lugambo&quot;.

Among his books are &quot;Three Days on the Cross&quot; which won the Jomo Kenyatta Prize for Literature (1992), &quot;Jail Bugs&quot;, &quot;Doomsday&quot;, and &quot;How To Be a Kenyan&quot;, based on his newspaper columns. Others include &quot;The Miracle Merchants, Mr Canta, Hassan the Genie, The Ghost of Garba Tula&quot; and &quot;Just Wait and See&quot;.

==Arrest==
In 1986 Mutahi was arrested with his brother Njuguna Mutahi and detained in the infamous Nyayo House torture chambers in Nairobi. He was charged with sedition and alleged association with the underground Mwakenya Movement and later transferred to Kamiti Maximum Security Prison. They were both released after fifteen months without ever being brought to trial. His imprisonment inspired him to write &quot;Three Days on the Cross&quot; and &quot;Jail bugs&quot;.

==Health==
In early 2003 Mutahi underwent what was supposed to be a routine, minor and painless operation at the Thika District Hospital to remove a lipoma from his back. He had been assured by a surgeon friend, who had offered to do the operation, that the procedure would take less than 15 minutes. Possibly because of a blunder by the anaesthesiologist, he went into a coma from which he never awoke. His family was waiting for his condition to improve before they could fly him to London for corrective neurosurgery.

==Death==
Mutahi died on 22 July 2003 at the Kenyatta National Hospital after 137 days in a coma. All his life he expressed his solidarity with the average Kenyan through his refrain: &quot;I am neither too foolish nor too clever.&quot;

==Legacy==

By the time Whispers died, he had grown into a formidable art form. In the mainstream press, both &quot;The Standard&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot; have attempted to &quot;reincarnate&quot; Whispers through surrogate writers. Benson Riungu reintroduced &quot;Benson&#x27;s World&quot;, written along the lines of Whispers in the &quot;Sunday Standard&quot; after Mutahi&#x27;s death. The &quot;Sunday Nation&quot; tried the &quot;Whispers&quot; column with a new writer but it never worked. However, the style of expression developed over the years by Mutahi in Whispers is still best expressed in politics through humour, satire and the use of certain widely diffused iconographic imagery. In 2009, the &quot;Sunday Nation&quot; introduced another humour column, Staffroom Diary, written by a Mwalimu Andrew — which is today widely regarded as the best humour writing in Kenya after Whispers. It is a humorous story about the experiences of Mwalimu Andrew, a Primary school teacher in rural Kenya. The teacher also studies at Kenyatta University which enables him to write on humour both in the village and in town. Mwalimu Andrew style is a little different from Whispers&#x27; in the sense that his anecdotes are stories that lead from one episode to another, all of them humorous. The column is very popular especially among teachers countrywide and is also published in &quot;Citizen&quot; newspaper, Tanzania. It is not yet known who writes Staffroom Diary, nor is it clear whether he is indeed a primary school teacher or a creative writer – but is seen as the best replacement of Whispers.

His family has started the Wahome Mutahi memorial trust to further his work especially humour and theatre. In addition, the Kenya Publishers Association started the bi-annual Wahome Mutahi award for literature, in his honour in 2005.

A book analysing Wahome Mutahi&#x27;s works titled &quot;Wahome Mutahi&#x27;s World&quot; was published and edited by Herve Maupeuand Patrick Mutahi.

<text>Kunabi Sena is a political party in based in Thane District in the Mid-North Konkan or Maharashtra Konkan in Maharashtra state.

The Kunabi Sena advocates for the interests of the Kunabi community, a developing caste. It is allied with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), with whom they have coordinated peasant struggles for land and water rights. Together with CPI(M) they have protested constructions of GAIL&#x27;s gas pipeline through Thane.

The party has also demanded the formation of a Konkan state, consisting of the Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg Districts.

The founding president of the Kunabi Sena is Vishwanath Patil.

The party is now part of the ruling alliance of Thane District Zilla Parishad (County government) in an alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party and the Shiv Sena; these latter two represent hardline Maharashtrian interests and are opposed to a separate Konkan State.

<doc id="1037148" wikidata="Q1895063" url="?curid=1037148" title="Toe loop jump">
<text>The toe loop jump is the simplest jump in the sport of figure skating. It was invented in the 1920s by American professional figure skater Bruce Mapes. The toe loop is accomplished by skating forward on the inside edge of the blade; the skater then switches to a backward-facing position before their takeoff, which is accomplished from a back outside edge with assistance from the toe pick on the other foot. The jump is exited on the same back outside edge as it was taken off from. It is often added to more difficult jumps during combinations and is the most common second jump performed in combinations. It is also the most commonly attempted jump.

==History==

The toe loop jump is the simplest of the six jumps in the sport of figure skating. It was invented in the 1920s by American professional figure skater Bruce Mapes, who might have also invented the flip jump. In competitions, the base value of a single toe loop is 0.40; the base value of a double toe loop is 1.30; the base value of a triple toe loop is 4.20; the base value of a quadruple toe loop is 9.50, and the base value for a quintuple toe loop is 14. 

===Firsts===

==Technique==
The toe loop is considered the simplest jump because not only do skaters use their toe-picks to execute it, their hips are already facing the direction in which they will rotate. The toe loop is the easier jump to add multiple rotations to because the toe-assisted takeoff adds power to the jump and because a skater can turn their body toward the assisting foot at takeoff, which slightly reduces the rotation needed in the air. It is often added to more difficult jumps during combinations and is the most common second jump performed in combinations. It is also the most commonly attempted jump, as well as &quot;the most commonly cheated on take off jump&quot;, or a jump in which the first rotation starts on the ice rather than in the air. Adding a toe loop to combination jumps does not increase the difficulty of skaters&#x27; short or free skating programs.

According to figure skating researcher Deborah King and her colleagues, the toe loop jump can be divided into four key events and three phases. The key events are: the toe-pick, or the moment the skater places their toepick into the ice; the take-off, or the last contact they make with the ice; the jump&#x27;s maximum height; and the landing, or the moment the skater returns to the ice. The three phases are: the approach, which begins when the skater initiates the three turn entering into the jump and ends when they initiate the toe-pick; propulsion, which begins at the toe-pick and ends at take-off; and flight, which begins at take-off and ends at landing.

A skater initiates the toe loop with a forward approach on the inside edge of the blade, then switches to a backward-facing position before its takeoff, which is accomplished from a back outside edge and with assistance from the toepick of the other foot. The jump is exited from the back outside edge of the same foot.

The skater approaches the back outside edge of their skate from the landing of a previous jump when done in combination, from the back outside edge exiting from a forward three turn initiated on the inside edge, or from a forward three turn initiated on the outside edge and exited on the inside edge followed by a change of foot. After completing the three turn, the skater reaches their free leg behind them and slightly outside the direction they are traveling, much like a pole-vaulter; this is the opposite foot they will use to land. Then they place the toepick in the ice with the free leg, and they jump while pulling the take-off leg back and around and reaching forward and around with the arm and shoulder on the same side as the take-off leg, thus achieving the rotation. They draw their arms into the body for the desired number of rotations. They should face forward, with their free leg approximately parallel to their take-off foot and with their arms as close to their body as possible, which results in keeping their arms and legs close to their bodies and remain in tight rotating positions at the moment of take-off, helping them attain faster rotational velocities in the air.

King and her colleagues, when they studied quadruple toe loop jumps at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, counted 71 attempted quadruple toe loop jumps or quadruple toe-loop combination jumps. Of those, there were 33 quadruple toe loops performed not in combination with other jumps, 13 of which were landed cleanly, without a fall, without the skater touching a hand down on the ice, or without stepping out of the landing onto the other foot. They also found that &quot;the most significant aspect&quot; for completing toe loop jumps was the ability to increase rotational velocity while in the air. King also found that skaters who performed quadruple toe loops began to rotate their shoulders earlier than in triples, so that by the time they completed their toe-pick, their hips and shoulders were more aligned about their longitudinal axes. As a result, their hips and shoulders turned more uniformly during the propulsion phase of the jump. Vertical take-off velocity, however, was higher for both quadruple and triple toe loops, resulting in &quot;higher jumps and more time in the air to complete the extra revolution for the quadruple toe-loop&quot;.

<text>Fort Bovisand is a fort in Devon, England near the beach of Bovisand. It was built as a result of the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom which reported in 1860. It is located on the mainland to defend the entrance of Plymouth Sound, at the narrows opposite the east end of Plymouth Breakwater. The fort is beside Bovisand harbour.

==History==

In 1816, a stone jetty and slip were built for boats from sailing warships anchored in Plymouth Sound to collect fresh water from the nearby reservoir.

In 1845, the first fort at the site, named Staddon Height Battery, was started. It still exists in the upper part of the present fort.

Work started on the main part of the fort in 1861. Originally intended to have two stories of casemates like Fort Picklecombe, the design was altered during construction to a single storey of 23 granite casemates with armoured shields. It was designed by Major (later Maj Gen) Whitworth Porter , and was built by George Baker and Company. The casemates were arranged in an arc and initially housed 22 9-inch Rifled Muzzle Loaders (RMLs) and one 10-inch RML gun, with accommodation for 180 men. Underground there are large deep tunnels to store artillery ammunition safe from enemy gunfire. It was completed in 1869.

By 1880, the armament included 14 10-inch and nine 9-inch RML guns. By 1893 it mounted 14 10 inch Rifled Muzzle Loading Guns, eight 9-inch Rifled Muzzle Loading (RML) guns and six 6 Pounder Quick Firing (QF) guns. In 1898 Six 12-pounder quick-firing guns were installed. By the early 1900s the original armament was obsolete and was removed.

In 1942, the remaining four 12-pounders were replaced by two twin 6-pounders, to combat E-boats.
A three-storey observation tower to direct the fire of these was built at the same time. The following year a Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft gun was installed.

On the dissolution of coast artillery in 1956, the Ministry of Defence abandoned the fort. In 1970, a lease was granted and the fort was converted into a national commercial diving school and scuba diving centre.

About the mid-1970s to at least the early 1990s, the fort at the top of the headland (above the coastal path) was used as a schools outdoor activity centre. The upper fort&#x27;s magazine and various other buildings were converted to be used as basic bunk houses, kitchen and dining area. The cottage was used as a toilet and shower block and a lounge and staff accommodation.

By 2000, the main leaseholder — Fort Bovisand Underwater Centre — had liquidated, but other diving services continued trading. Months of argument continued about the status of the leases and viability of existing businesses based there.

In December 2000, Plymouth Ocean Projects Ltd. went into receivership. As a result, the owners (the Ministry of Defence) decided it was no longer possible to keep the site functioning, and the remaining diving and other firms trading there ceased operations.

In mid 2004, after these businesses failed, the site was bought from the Public Receiver by Powder Creek Ltd (now known as Fort Bovisand Developments Ltd), and company majority owned by Greg Dyke, ex-Director General of the BBC, with the aim of saving the site and bringing it back to life.

By late 2004, Fort Bovisand was home to Discovery Divers.

In 2011, after examining a number of options, the Fort Bovisand Trust was formed (a registered charitable body) to take forward proposals for a heritage attraction and a bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund. Proposals were for a mixed scheme of the heritage centre, diving business, and some residential units.

In 2013, the Fort Bovisand Trust gained award of a development grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to progress plans for a heritage visitor attraction and learning centre.

The visitor attraction proposal was unfortunately unsuccessful in receiving a full delivery grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund - being beaten to first place by the Concorde Museum at Filton, Bristol. However, both Historic England and South Hams District Council remained keen to see the site saved and brought back into use, and, working with the developers, subsequently granted approval for additional residential units along with catering and commercial units.

Preparation works and additional surveying operations were conducted in 2019, with works to stabilise the cliffs and the access road, in order to secure access to the fort and also to the adjacent private residences, carried out during 2020.

Work to deliver the first stage of the new development commenced in early 2021 and should be completed in late 2023.

<text>Gonzaga College High School is a private Catholic college-preparatory high school for boys in Washington, D.C. Founded by the Jesuits in 1821 as the Washington Seminary, Gonzaga is named in honor of Aloysius Gonzaga, an Italian saint from the 16th century. Gonzaga is the oldest boys&#x27; high school in Washington, D.C.

==History==

Gonzaga was officially founded by Anthony Kohlmann, a Jesuit, in 1821, though there is some evidence the school began a few years earlier. It is the oldest educational facility in the original federal city of Washington and was at first called Washington Seminary, operating under the charter of Georgetown College (now Georgetown University), which was becoming too crowded for its space at the time. Gonzaga&#x27;s original location was on land offered to the Society of Jesus by William Matthews on F Street near 10th Street, N.W., in a building adjoining Saint Patrick&#x27;s Church. The purpose of this school was to train seminarians, but soon after opening, it began admitting lay students. The school was immediately popular among Catholic families and was well enough known in its early years to attract the attention of President John Quincy Adams, who visited the school to test the boys&#x27; Latin and Greek. However, there were financial problems that caused the Jesuits to withdraw in 1827: their order prohibited the charging of tuition at a day school for youth. It continued to be run by laity until the Jesuits returned some twenty years later (with the ordinance regarding tuition changed); President Zachary Taylor presided at the commencement exercises in 1849.

In 1858, Gonzaga was granted its own charter by Congress as a college empowered to confer degrees in the arts and sciences, which accounts for its name (Gonzaga College) to this day. Although some students did receive bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the 19th century, Gonzaga no longer confers degrees, other than honorary doctorates presented to commencement speakers or other notable guests. In 1871, the school moved to a building (now called Kohlmann Hall) in a neighborhood called Swampoodle located just north of the U.S. Capitol. It was located on the same block as St. Aloysius Church – built in 1859 and now on the U.S. Register of Historic Buildings with a high Roman Catholic population surrounding it. Enrollment declined owing to the distance of the new neighborhood from the center, but the Jesuits persevered and by the end of the 19th century the school was once again flourishing. A theater was built in 1896 and a large new classroom building (previously the Main Building and now called Dooley Hall) was opened in 1912.

John Gabriel Smith, Gonzaga&#x27;s first African-American graduate, entered the school in 1951. He wanted to prepare to be a priest and none of the schools for black children offered the necessary prerequisites, including Latin. When he decided to try out for the varsity football team, the school was unable to schedule games against public schools, which were still segregated at the time. He was ultimately prevented from playing by an injury. He graduated in 1954.

The curriculum of Gonzaga from its founding until the late 20th century was at once rigorously classical and emphatically Catholic. Mastery of Latin and deep involvement in the Catholic religion were at its core. Standards were high, and many hopeful boys who lacked the necessary qualities for success were denied admittance. To this day, Gonzaga admits approximately one third of applicants.

Gonzaga benefited greatly from the fact that the row houses built in Swampoodle were largely occupied by Irish Catholics from the late 19th century on. Although Gonzaga always drew students from other parts of the city as well, the departure of the Swampoodle Irish for the suburbs in the mid-20th century, and more especially their replacement by poorer non-Catholics, brought on another period of difficulties. A decline in enrollment and the great inner-city riot of 1968 led some to suggest that Gonzaga should be closed, or moved to a more affluent area. However, the Jesuits once again persisted and the school survived. In the last years of the 20th century Gonzaga expanded, adding several new buildings and a large playing field and field house. By 2007 Gonzaga had regained its former status and a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial referred to it as &quot;the premier Catholic high school of Washington.&quot;

==St. Aloysius==
St. Aloysius is a parish church physically attached to Gonzaga through the entrance building Dooley Hall. The church was built in 1859. It is used for Masses, concerts, some school assemblies, and graduation. The large painting above the altar is the work of Constantino Brumidi, famous for painting the frescoes on the interior of the United States Capitol dome.

==Athletics==

Gonzaga&#x27;s athletic teams are called the Eagles. Gonzaga fields seventeen different varsity teams, most of which compete in the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference.

The Gonzaga lacrosse team has won the WCAC Boys&#x27; Lacrosse championship 14 times, most recently in 2024. They have finished ranked #1 in the year end rankings of The Washington Post five separate times.
The Gonzaga soccer team won four consecutive WCAC championships from 2007 to 2010, and is consistently one of the best teams in the Washington area. They added additional championships in 2012, 2016, and 2017, beating national powerhouse DeMatha Catholic in each.

Gonzaga rugby has won 12 consecutive Potomac Rugby Union Championships and finished the 2010 season ranked #2 in the nation. In the middle of the 2011 season, Gonzaga beat the #1 ranked team in the nation and rival, Xavier, and became the #1 team in the nation. During the 2011 National Championship in Salt Lake City, Utah, Gonzaga finished 3rd. The Eagles won the High School Rugby National Championship in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2018. In 2023, Eye St Rugby won their 5th National Championship, and received the newly named Lee Kelly Memorial Cup, named in honor of long time Gonzaga coach Lee Kelly. 

The Gonzaga crew team won the Stotesbury Cup Regatta on the Schuylkill River, Philadelphia in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Runner up years include: 2009, 2017, 2018, and 2023.

Out of the past 17 seasons (2000-2016) Gonzaga Cross Country has finished in first, second, or third place in the WCAC Championship race every time. The team won the WCAC championship in 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012. Additionally, in 2010 the Gonzaga Cross Country team won the &quot;triple crown&quot; with first-place finishes in the WCAC Championship, the MD/DC Private/Independent Schools Championship, and the Jesuit Championship. The Eagles XC squad has won the Jesuit Championships in 1987, 2002, 2009, 2010, and 2016. The team also added their first victory at the DC State Championships during the 2016 season. 2016 marked another milestone for Gonzaga Cross Country. The JV Boys team managed to complete the &quot;triple crown&quot;, winning the JV WCAC Championship, the JV MD/DC Private/Independent Schools Championship, and the JV Jesuit Championship.

Varsity 2 hockey won their respective Mid Atlantic Prep Hockey League (MAPHL) “A” league in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Varsity 1 hockey won their “AA” division in 2017 and 2018. Gonzaga is the first school in MAPHL history to have a back-to-back sweep of both divisions in two consecutive years. In the 2018–2019 season, Varsity 1 defeated Spaulding 5–1 to win their third straight MAPHL AA championship, a huge accomplishment for a team with two freshman goalies that year.

Buchanan Field is the home field for football and lacrosse and also serves as the practice facility for rugby, soccer and track and field. The Carmody Center hosts basketball and select wrestling matches. Old Gym is the wrestling home match site. The Fort Dupont Ice Arena hosts ice hockey games. Gravelly Point is the home grounds for rugby matches and Long Bridge Park is the home facility for soccer games. The game and practice venue for baseball is located at the Washington Nationals Youth Academy.

<text>A whispering gallery is usually a circular, hemispherical, elliptical or ellipsoidal enclosure, often beneath a dome or a vault, in which whispers can be heard clearly in other parts of the gallery. Such galleries can also be set up using two parabolic dishes. Sometimes the phenomenon is detected in caves.

== Theory ==

A whispering gallery is most simply constructed in the form of a circular wall, and allows whispered communication from any part of the internal side of the circumference to any other part. The sound is carried by waves, known as whispering-gallery waves, that travel around the circumference clinging to the walls, an effect that was discovered in the whispering gallery of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. The extent to which the sound travels at St Paul&#x27;s can also be judged by clapping in the gallery, which produces four echoes. Other historical examples are the Gol Gumbaz mausoleum in Bijapur, India and the Echo Wall of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. A hemispherical enclosure will also guide whispering gallery waves. The waves carry the words so that others will be able to hear them from the opposite side of the gallery.

The gallery may also be in the form of an ellipse or ellipsoid, with an accessible point at each focus. In this case, when a visitor stands at one focus and whispers, the line of sound emanating from this focus reflects directly to the focus at the other end of the gallery, where the whispers may be heard. In a similar way, two large concave parabolic dishes, serving as acoustic mirrors, may be erected facing each other in a room or outdoors to serve as a whispering gallery, a common feature of science museums. Egg-shaped galleries, such as the Golghar Granary at Bankipore, and irregularly shaped smooth-walled galleries in the form of caves, such as the Ear of Dionysius in Syracuse, also exist.

== Examples ==
=== India ===

* The Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur, India.
* The Golghar Granary in Bankipore, India.
* The Victoria Memorial in Kolkata.

=== United Kingdom ===

* St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London is the place where whispering-gallery waves were first discovered by Lord Rayleigh .
* Gloucester Cathedral has a whispering gallery.
* The Berkeley Wetherspoons Bristol has a whispering gallery.

=== United States ===

* Grand Central Terminal in New York City: a landing amid the Oyster Bar ramps, in front of the Oyster Bar restaurant 
* Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol.
* Salt Lake Tabernacle in Salt Lake City, Utah
* Centennial fountain in front of Green Library at Stanford University in California
* Gates Circle, Buffalo, New York
* The Whispering Arch in St. Louis Union Station
* Charles Stover Bench, Central Park, New York, New York 
* Waldo Hutchins Bench, Central Park, New York, New York

=== Other parts of the world ===

* The Echo Wall in the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.
* Basilica of St. John Lateran, Rome.
* The Salle des Caryatides in the Louvre, Paris, France.
* Ear of Dionysius cave in Syracuse, Sicily.
* Banco dos Namorados (Lovers&#x27; bench) in Santiago de Compostela, Spain.

== In science ==

The term &quot;whispering gallery&quot; has been borrowed in the physical sciences to describe other forms of whispering-gallery waves such as light or matter waves.

<doc id="1037183" wikidata="Q7653383" url="?curid=1037183" title="Swampoodle (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>Swampoodle was a neighborhood in Washington, D.C. on the border of Northwest and Northeast in the second half of 19th and early 20th century. This neighborhood is no longer known as Swampoodle and has been replaced in large part by NoMa.

==Geography==

A geographic approximation can only be evaluated as it was never clearly defined. Originally, the northeastern part of Washington, D.C. above Judiciary Square was known as &quot;English Hill&quot; from E Street NE/NW on the South and 4th Street NW on the west all the way to Boundary Road. It was a rural area with almost no buildings and gravel sidewalks. This original settlement contracted to the area bordered by 4th Street NW, 1st NW, E Street NE/NW, H Street NE/NW. &quot;Swampoodle&quot; was the name of a smaller settlement along H Street between North Capitol Street and 1st NE but extended to take a big part of &quot;English Hill&quot;.

Later on, its borders contracted to K Street NE to the North, G Street NE to the South, 2nd Street NW to the West, and 2nd Street NE to the East. Through the center of it ran the principal branch of Tiber Creek running between North Capitol Street and 1st Street NE.

The origin of the name &quot;Swampoodle&quot; is believed to come from a newspaper reporter covering the ground-breaking of the Roman Catholic St. Aloysius Church in 1857, who referred to the land at the site at the intersection of North Capitol and I Street as containing numerous swamps and puddles that often occurred when Tiber Creek overflowed its banks.

==History==
Swampoodle developed during the second half of the 19th century, providing a place of refuge for emigrants following the Great Famine of Ireland that devastated Ireland between 1845 and 1849.

The area east of North Capitol Street remained undeveloped until the 1870s. The development of west of North Capitol started developing in the 1850s with two major construction projects. In 1856, the first Government Printing Office building was built on the southeastern corner of Square 624 and the following year, H Street was grated and graveled between New Jersey Avenue and North Capitol.

In 1859, St. Aloysius Catholic Church is built at 19 I Street NE on square 622. It catered to the Roman Catholic Irish population of Swampoodle. Gonzaga College High School moved to the same square in 1871.

By the early 20th century, most of the Irish American population had left the neighborhood. They were replaced by Greeks and Italians immigrants and some African-Americans.

The neighborhood gained a reputation for being a lawless shantytown, where crime, prostitution, drunkenness were rife during and after the Civil War. At the core of the district was Jackson Alley located next to the Government Printing Office Building, between G and H Streets and crossing North Capitol Street. It was a considered a virtual no-go area for the police and new recruits were often sent there for their training. The problem was more with the younger generation than the older folks. Gangs of young men known as &quot;poodles&quot; were the main cause of concern. But it was also a place to find work for its inhabitants. For a very long time, Jackson Alley was inhabited by &quot;tinkers&quot; or &quot;tinners&quot; because they were tinworkers.

The area was known for overcrowding and outbreaks of malaria, typhoid, and dysentery. But Swampoodle was a thriving community, whose Irish construction workers helped build Washington, D.C. As Swampoodle was then on the edge of the city, many of the residents kept goats and cows, sometimes in livestock pens among the alleys dividing their modest houses. Until the 1880s, the north side of K Street was not built and the only things there were swamps, pasters, and the railway track. This almost rural lifestyle continued until about 1907, when Washington Union Station was built.

In the 1870s, Tiber Creek was channeled underground along North Capitol Street. From Florida Ave to M Street, the sewer was 20 feet in diameter and grew to 30 feet for the section below M Street. Due to the elevation of the ground level, many found themselves with one level under the level of the street.

===Swampoodle Grounds===
Swampoodle Grounds, a stadium with a capacity of approximately 6,000, was the home of the Washington Statesmen baseball team from 1886 to 1889. It was located on a block bounded by North Capitol Street NE and tracks (west); F Street NE (south); Delaware Avenue NE (east); and G Street NE (north). The McDowell and Sons plant, seen in the background of the ballpark photo behind right field, was listed in city directories as the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and North Capitol Street.

==The end of Swampoodle==

The demise of Swampoodle as a community and neighborhood began with the construction of Union Station in 1907. The plan involved the demolition of over 10 blocks of residential houses in the core of Swampoodle. Over 100 houses were demolished to make way for the massive station and the rail yard. Squares 714 through 720 were razed. As part of the plan, the remainder of Tiber Creek was covered up in a tunnel and the low-lying land in the area was filed in. The section of Delaware Avenue between Florida Avenue (Previously known as Boundary Road) and Massachusetts Avenue was buried under the railway tracks with the exception of a small section between L Street and M Street NE.

This major project physically divided the neighborhood and led to many of the 1,600 former residents moving to other parts of the city. Rezoning led to increased heavy industry in the area, making it unattractive for residential use.

The identity of Swampoodle died away and by the post-World War II period, even the name Swampoodle was largely forgotten.

==Present==
Today, the area is occupied primarily by office complexes, rail yards serving Union Station, the Government Publishing Office and Gonzaga College High School, a legacy of its original settlers. It is surrounded by some of the original dwellings, particularly in the Near Northeast section to the east of Delaware Avenue. Jackson Alley is no longer known as such. On the west side of North Capitol Street, it is under the Government Printing Office Building. On the east side of North Capitol, it is now known as G Place NE.

The neighborhood got some press after a play about it, &quot;Swampoodle&quot; by Tom Swift, debuted in 2011. It was produced by Solas Nua with support from the Ireland-based Performance Corporation to help combat stereotypes about the Irish. It consists of colorful, disparate stories about life in the predominantly Irish neighborhood.
Since 2007, the neighborhood has been included in the rebranded &quot;NoMa&quot; which stands for &quot;North of Massachusetts Avenue.&quot; It is served by the NoMa – Gallaudet University Metro station and Union Station.

The Capitol Hill Restoration Society (CHRS) has begun walking tours of four square blocks of the neighborhood that remains today between F and H Streets NE and 2nd and 4th Streets NE. CHRS is proposing to expand the Capitol Hill Historic District to include these blocks as part of their Beyond the Boundaries initiative.

===Swampoodle Park===
The name &quot;Swampoodle&quot; has lost its negative connotation in the local community. As a result, a park at the intersection of 3rd Street NE and L Street NE, a block from the border of the old neighborhood, was named Swampoodle Park in 2018 in honor of the historic neighborhood. The announcement was made on December 13, 2017 after an online survey was conducted asking the community to vote for one of three possible names, the other two options being Old City Corner and 3rd and L Park. A bill codifying the name was introduced on April 9, 2018, and sponsored by Council Member Charles Allen (D) and Chairman Phil Mendelson (D). Resolution R22-0478 effective from April 10, 2018 passed on April 20, 2018 by 12 votes. Council Member Elissa Silverman (I) did not vote.

The park officially opened November 17, 2018.

==References to Swampoodle==
In an article published in the &quot;Washington Herald&quot; on April 13, 1919, Capt. J. Walter Mitchell talks about the 1860s and 1870s Humphrey and Juenemann&#x27;s Pleasure Garden (also known as Mount Vernon Lager Beer Brewery and Pleasure Garden). It was a gathering place on Capitol Hill between 4th, 5th, E and F Street NE where various events took place including picnics with dances which could lead to both fights and frolics. These picnics were apparently known as &quot;Swampoodle Walks&quot; probably due to the rough nature of the events and the fights.

<doc id="1037184" wikidata="Q5497851" url="?curid=1037184" title="Frederick Gibberd">
<text>Sir Frederick Ernest Gibberd CBE (7 January 1908 – 9 January 1984) was an English architect, town planner and landscape designer. He is particularly known for his work in Harlow, Essex, and for the BISF house, a design for a prefabricated council house that was widely adopted in post-war Britain.

==Biography==
Gibberd was born in Coventry, the eldest of the five children of a local tailor, and was educated at the city&#x27;s King Henry VIII School. In 1925 he was articled to a firm of architects in Birmingham and studied architecture under William Bidlake at the Birmingham School of Art, where his roommate was F. R. S. Yorke.

A good friend of Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe, Gibberd&#x27;s work was also influenced by Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, and F. R. S. Yorke. He set up in practice in 1930, designing Pullman Court, Streatham Hill, London (1934–36), a housing development which launched his career. With the success of this scheme, Gibberd became established as the &#x27;flat&#x27; architect (referring to blocks of flats) and went on to build several other schemes, including Park Court, Sydenham and Ellington Court, Southgate (both 1936), continuing to practise until the outbreak of the Second World War.

Gibberd and Yorke collaborated on a number of publications, including the influential book &quot;The Modern Flat&quot;, which was published in 1937 and featured the then newly completed Pullman Court and Park Court, as well as many other European examples. Gibberd also designed the BISF house, a prefabricated form of council housing sponsored by the British Iron and Steel Federation and widely adopted by local authorities in Britain in the postwar years.

Gibberd was consultant architect-planner for the Harlow new town development and spent the rest of his life living in the town he had designed. His most notable works there include The Lawn, Britain&#x27;s first modern-style point block, consisting of nine storeys arranged in a butterfly design on an area of open ground surrounded by oak trees; a trompe-l&#x27;oeil pair of curved terraces facing a cricket green at Orchard Croft, which won a British Housing Award in 1951; the pioneering broken-silhouette flats in Morley Grove; and much of the housing in Mark Hall neighbourhood, which is in its entirety a conservation area. The Harvey Centre lacks architectural distinction, but is notable as an early British example of a large purpose-built indoor shopping mall. His similarly pioneering Sports Centre has been demolished, as has the original town hall. The Water Gardens, although listed by English Heritage, have been spoilt by the abutment of a car park and shopping centre. The garden of his own house at Marsh Lane (Gibberd Garden), on the outskirts of Harlow, a mixture of formal and informal design, contains architectural elements salvaged from his reconstruction of Coutts Bank in London.

A further achievement by Gibberd in planning Harlow is his incorporation of works by many leading architects of the postwar years, such as FRS Yorke, Powell &amp; Moya, Graham Dawbarn, John Poulson, Maxwell Fry &amp; Jane Drew, Michael Neylan, William Crabtree, Leonard Manasseh, ECP Monson, Gerard Goalen, Gerald Lacoste, Richard Sheppard and H. T. Cadbury-Brown. A substantial collection of public sculptures is visible around the town, including works by Henry Moore, Elisabeth Frink, Auguste Rodin and Barbara Hepworth.

Gibberd wrote &quot;Harlow: The story of a New Town&quot; in collaboration with Len White and Ben Hyde Harvey. In 1953 he published &quot;Town Design&quot; a book on the forms, processes, and history of the subject.

== Personal life ==
He married first Dorothy Phillips, with whom he had one son and two daughters. She died in 1970. He then married Mrs Patricia Fox-Edwards on 30 March 1972. They remained married until his death.

<text>:&quot;The term Persian powder can also refer to a type of dry snow in the Zagros Mountains.&quot;

Persian powder is an insecticide powder with natural pyrethrin as the active agent. It is also known as Persian pellitory, insect powder and internationally as pyrethrum.

==Biological pest control==
Persian powder is a green pesticide that has been used for centuries for the biological pest extermination of household insects, garden pests, and agricultural pests. It may first have been exported from Persia to Ancient Rome. 

Pyrethrin and pyrethroids are used indoors, in gardens and the horticulture industry, and in agriculture. 

It is produced from the powdered flowers of certain species of pyrethrum, plants in the genera &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; and &quot;Tanacetum&quot;. In more recent times it has had formulations with brand names such as Zacherlin.

===Synthetic forms===

Pyrethroids are synthetic insecticides based on natural pyrethrum (pyrethrins), such as permethrin. 

A common formulation of pyrethrin is in preparations containing the synthetic chemical piperonyl butoxide: this has the effect of enhancing the toxicity to insects and speeding the effects when compared with pyrethrins used alone. These formulations are known as &quot;synergized pyrethrins&quot;.

In the novel Anna Karenina, the character Kitty used Persian powder to sanitize beds in an unclean hotel.

<doc id="1037202" wikidata="Q5367730" url="?curid=1037202" title="Elspeth Huxley">
<text>Elspeth Joscelin Huxley CBE (née Grant; 23 July 1907 – 10 January 1997) was an English writer, journalist, broadcaster, magistrate, environmentalist, farmer, and government adviser. She wrote over 40 books, including her best-known lyrical books, &quot;The Flame Trees of Thika&quot; and &quot;The Mottled Lizard&quot;, based on her youth in a coffee farm in British Kenya. Her husband, Gervas Huxley, was a grandson of Thomas Henry Huxley and a cousin of Aldous Huxley.

==Early life and education==
Nellie and Major Josceline Grant, Elspeth&#x27;s parents, arrived in Thika in what was then British East Africa in 1912, to start a life as coffee farmers in colonial Kenya. Elspeth, aged six, arrived in December 1913, complete with governess and maid. Her upbringing was unconventional; she was &quot;almost treated as a parcel, being passed from hand to hand&quot;. Huxley&#x27;s 1959 book &quot;The Flame Trees of Thika&quot; explores how unprepared for rustic life the early British settlers really were. It was adapted into a television miniseries in 1981. Elspeth was educated at a whites-only school in Nairobi.

She left Africa in 1925, earning a degree in agriculture at Reading University in England and studying at Cornell University in upstate New York. She returned to Africa periodically.

==Career==
Huxley was appointed Assistant Press Officer to the Empire Marketing Board in 1929. She resigned her post in 1932 and travelled widely. Huxley started writing soon after her marriage; her first book, &quot;White Man&#x27;s Country: Lord Delamere and the making of Kenya&quot; about the famous white settler, was published in 1935.

Huxley&#x27;s 1939 book &quot;Red Strangers&quot; describes life among the Kikuyu of Kenya around the time of the arrival of the first European settlers. The manuscript was sent first to the publisher Macmillan, but Harold Macmillan, then working for the family firm, agreed to publish it only with considerable cuts, including a graphic description of female circumcision. Huxley refused, and the book was published by Chatto &amp; Windus. Huxley remembered: &quot;It was indeed a happy day for me when our future Prime Minister couldn&#x27;t take clitoridectomy.&quot; The book was republished by Penguin Books in 1999 and again by Penguin Classics in 2000; Richard Dawkins played an important role in getting the book republished, and wrote a preface to the new edition.

Her final tally of 42 books included the ten works of fiction and 29 non-fiction books, as well as thousands of pamphlets and articles.

During the Second World War, Huxley was a broadcaster for the BBC.

In 1960, Huxley was appointed an independent member of the Advisory Commission for the Review of the Constitution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (the Monckton Commission). Although she was initially an advocate of continued colonial rule, she later called for the independence of African nations.

In the 1960s, she served as a correspondent for the &quot;National Review&quot; magazine.

Huxley was a friend of Joy Adamson, the author of &quot;Born Free&quot;, and is mentioned in the biography of Joy and George Adamson entitled &quot;The Great Safari&quot;. Huxley wrote the foreword to Joy&#x27;s autobiography &quot;The Searching Spirit&quot;.

==Personal life==
She married Gervas Huxley, the son of doctor Henry Huxley (1865–1946) in 1931. They had one son, Charles, who was born in February 1944.

==Death and legacy==
Huxley died on 10 January 1997 aged 89, in a nursing home at Tetbury in Gloucestershire, England.

A collection of twelve boxes of photographs, prints, negatives, contact prints and slides is held at Bristol Archives in the British Empire and Commonwealth Collection. Most of the photographs were taken by Huxley, with the rest collected by her. The collection covers Huxley&#x27;s whole career (1896-1981) and subject matter includes Kenyan safari landscapes and local people (specifically the Kikuyu people), the Mau Mau uprising, white settlers, Edwardian Mombasa, and a transcript of an oral history interview taken by the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum (Ref. 1995/076). Other collections related to Huxley can be found at the Bodleian Library and Cambridge University Library Department of Manuscripts and University Archives.

Christine S. Nicholls wrote &quot;Elspeth Huxley: A Biography&quot;, published by Harper Collins in 2002.

<doc id="1037206" wikidata="Q2450837" url="?curid=1037206" title="Palnatoke">
<text>Palnatoke or Palnatoki, sometimes written Palna-Toki or Palna Toki (Old Norse: or ), was a legendary Danish hero and chieftain of the island of Fyn. According to the &quot;Jómsvíkinga saga&quot;, Palnatoki founded the brotherhood of Jomsvikings and established its laws.

According to the Jómsvíkinga saga, he was the son of Palner Tokesen and his wife Ingeborg who was the daughter of the Geatish earl Ottar Jarl. Palnatoke raised king Harald Bluetooth&#x27;s son Sweyn Forkbeard and was a staunch supporter of the old pagan faith. Harald Bluetooth had allowed Christian missionaries from the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen missionary in Denmark and the king himself was baptized once between 960 and 965. Palnatoke convinced Sweyn to wage war on his father. In the mid-980s, Sweyn revolted against his father and seized the throne. Harald was driven into exile and died shortly afterwards. According to some accounts, Palnatoki himself slew Harald. In addition to religious motives, he may have been taking revenge for the death of his grandfather, Jarl Ottar, who was killed when Harald invaded Götaland.

Saxo Grammaticus relates how Palnatoke (Toko) was forced by King Harald to use a single arrow to shoot an apple from his own son&#x27;s head as the boy ran downhill. The legendary motif of the great archer forced to shoot an apple from his son&#x27;s head appears among other Germanic nations, as the story of Egil in the &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot;, William of Cloudesley in an English ballad, Hemming Wolf in Holstein, Puncher in an Upper Rhenish legend in &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, and most famously William Tell in Switzerland.

The name has been interpreted in two different ways. The first is as an alternate Old Norse patronymic meaning &quot;Palni&#x27;s (or Palnir&#x27;s) (son) Tóki&quot;. The other is as a nickname meaning &quot;Shaft-Toki&quot; or &quot;Toki the Archer&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Palnatoki was the subject of works by two influential Danish authors of the early nineteenth century. Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger wrote a tragedy called &quot;Palnatoke&quot; in 1809. N. F. S. Grundtvig wrote a tale called &quot;Palnatoke&quot; in 1804 and in 1809–11 a two-volume work of poetic drama, &quot;Optrin af Kæmpelivets Undergang i Nord&quot; (&quot;Episode of the Downfall of the Fighting Life in the North&quot;), which deals with Palnatoki and Sigurð and was intended as part of a massive poetic work projected to consist of dramatised historic episodes and retellings of sagas spanning a thousand years from the coming of Odin and &quot;Asatru&quot; to Scandinavia through the legends of the Völsungs and Nibelungs until the fall of the Jomsborg with Palnetoki&#x27;s death, and the victory of Christianity.

<text>Kerry Zavagnin (; born July 2, 1974) is an American former professional soccer player who is an assistant coach with Sporting Kansas City. A defensive midfielder, he spent most of his career with Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer. He made 21 appearances for the United States national team.

==Career==

===Early career===
Zavagnin went to and played soccer for Detroit Catholic Central High School.

He played his college soccer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1992 to 1995, where he registered 22 goals and 24 assists in 76 games. Upon graduating, Zavagnin joined the Raleigh Flyers of the USISL, one of the two major outdoor second divisions in US soccer, for their 1996 season.

===Professional career===
Zavagnin was born in Plymouth, Michigan. After one year with the Flyers, he was drafted 21st overall with the first pick of the third round in the 1997 MLS Supplemental Draft by the Colorado Rapids. Before playing a single game for the Rapids, however, Kerry was traded to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, in exchange for Peter Vermes. Zavagnin played 1743 minutes for the Metros in 1997 and 1998, and did not acquit himself well, playing himself out of MLS. In 1997, the MetroStars sent him on loan to the Long Island Rough Riders of the USISL.

Zavagnin joined the Lehigh Valley Steam of the A-League for the 1999 season. After one season in the A-League, Zavagnin returned to MLS after being drafted 30th overall in the 2000 MLS SuperDraft by the Kansas City Wizards. Zavagnin quickly established himself with the Wizards, playing 2743 minutes at midfield for a team that would both go on to win the MLS Cup, and was one of the best defensive teams in the league&#x27;s history. Zavagnin remained an important contributor to the Wizards for the next six years, playing a quiet defensive role, and establishing himself as one of the better, though also one of the least recognized, midfielders in the league.

In 2004, Zavagnin began to be recognized among the league&#x27;s elite. He won a lot of praise for running the Wizards midfield, and was named to the MLS Best XI. In eight years in the league, Zavagnin scored five goals and added 20 assists in regular season play.

Zavagnin received 21 caps for the U.S. national team, making his debut October 25, 2000, against US arch-rival Mexico.

In August, 2008, Zavagnin announced that he would retire at the end of the season.

<text>Michael Jason LaRue (born March 19, 1974) is a former Major League Baseball catcher who played for the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals and St. Louis Cardinals.

==Biography==
A native of Bulverde, Texas, after being selected in the fifth round of the 1995 Major League Baseball Draft out of Dallas Baptist University, LaRue debuted with Cincinnati on June 15, 1999, and became Cincinnati&#x27;s starting catcher in 2001. 2005 was his best overall season with 14 HR, 60 RBI, and .260 batting average.
LaRue agreed to a two-year, $9.1 million contract with the Cincinnati Reds on December 20, 2005. On November 20, 2006, LaRue was traded to the Kansas City Royals for a player to be named later. Since a player could not be agreed upon, the Royals opted to send the Reds cash considerations in the amount of one dollar.

On Mother&#x27;s Day, May 14, 2006, LaRue was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation. He was also one of a handful of players to hit a home run with a pink bat.

On November 19, 2007, he signed a one-year contract with the St. Louis Cardinals as the backup to Yadier Molina. During the season, he was used primarily for his defensive ability as his hitting stats had dwindled. LaRue re-signed with the Cardinals following the 2008 season for one year.

LaRue returned to the Cardinals for 2010, his third season with the team. On August 10, 2010, he suffered a concussion caused by a kick to the head by the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; Johnny Cueto, during a bench-clearing brawl. On August 19, LaRue was placed on the 60-day disabled list, ending his season.

The concussion was initially thought to be slight, but LaRue experienced severe post-concussion symptoms. On September 18, LaRue announced his retirement from Major League Baseball. He told the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; that his symptoms were so severe that he&#x27;d been ordered to go back to his home in San Antonio, where he lived during the offseason because he was in no condition to be left alone. He could not drive or cook for himself for a time, could not watch television or even ride in a car as a passenger with his eyes open. He&#x27;d suffered close to 20 concussions dating to his days as a high school football and baseball player, and doctors told him that as a catcher he was vulnerable to a concussion that was at least as severe as the one he&#x27;d suffered in the brawl.

LaRue was known throughout his career to be a defensive specialist. In 2001, he led the major leagues with a 61% caught-stealing percentage, and he has a career 39% caught-stealing percentage.

==Personal==
LaRue lives in Blanco, Texas, with his wife Heather, and three sons: Tyler, Dylan, and Brayden. He has a brother, Shaun LaRue and two sisters, Tricia Maynard and Brooke Albert.

<doc id="1037221" wikidata="Q418945" url="?curid=1037221" title="Fructooligosaccharide">
<text>Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) also sometimes called oligofructose or oligofructan, are oligosaccharide fructans, used as an alternative sweetener. FOS exhibits sweetness levels between 30 and 50 percent of sugar in commercially prepared syrups. It occurs naturally, and its commercial use emerged in the 1980s in response to demand for healthier and calorie-reduced foods.

==Chemistry==
Two different classes of fructooligosaccharide (FOS) mixtures are produced commercially, based on inulin degradation or transfructosylation processes.

FOS can be produced by degradation of inulin, or polyfructose, a polymer of -fructose residues linked by β(2→1) bonds with a terminal α(1→2) linked -glucose. The degree of polymerization of inulin ranges from 10 to 60. Inulin can be degraded enzymatically or chemically to a mixture of oligosaccharides with the general structure Glu–Frun (abbrev. GFn) and Frum (Fm), with n and m ranging from 1 to 7. This process also occurs to some extent in nature, and these oligosaccharides may be found in a large number of plants, especially in Jerusalem artichoke, chicory and the blue agave plant. The main components of commercial products are kestose (GF2), nystose (GF3), fructosylnystose (GF4), bifurcose (GF3), inulobiose (F2), inulotriose (F3), and inulotetraose (F4).

The second class of FOS is prepared by the transfructosylation action of a β-fructosidase of &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; or &quot;Aspergillus &quot; on sucrose. The resulting mixture has the general formula of GFn, with n ranging from 1 to 5. Contrary to the inulin-derived FOS, not only is there β(1→2) binding but other linkages do occur, however, in limited numbers.

Because of the configuration of their glycosidic bonds, fructooligosaccharides resist hydrolysis by salivary and intestinal digestive enzymes. In the colon they are fermented by anaerobic bacteria. In other words, they have a lower caloric value, while contributing to the dietary fiber fraction of the diet. Fructooligosaccharides are more soluble than inulins and are, therefore, sometimes used as an additive to yogurt and other (dairy) products. Fructooligosaccharides are used specially in combination with high-intensity artificial sweeteners, whose sweetness profile and aftertaste it improves.

== Food sources ==
FOS is extracted from the blue agave plant as well as fruits and vegetables such as bananas, onions, chicory root, garlic, asparagus, jícama, and leeks. Some grains and cereals, such as wheat and barley, also contain FOS. The Jerusalem artichoke and its relative yacón together with the blue agave plant have been found to have the highest concentrations of FOS of cultured plants.

== Health benefits ==
FOS has been a popular sweetener in Japan and Korea for many years, even before 1990, when the Japanese government installed a &quot;Functionalized Food Study Committee&quot; of 22 experts to start to regulate &quot;special nutrition foods or functional foods&quot; that contain the categories of fortified foods (e.g., vitamin-fortified wheat flour), and is now becoming increasingly popular in Western cultures for its prebiotic effects. FOS serves as a substrate for microflora in the large intestine, increasing the overall gastrointestinal tract health. It has also been proposed as a supplement for treating yeast infections.

Several studies have found that FOS and inulin promote calcium absorption in both the animal and the human gut. The intestinal microflora in the lower gut can ferment FOS, which results in a reduced pH. Calcium is more soluble in acid, and, therefore, more of it comes out of food and is available to move from the gut into the bloodstream.

In a randomized controlled trial involving 36 twin pairs aged 60 and above, participants were given either a prebiotic (3.375 mg inulin and 3.488 mg FOS) or a placebo daily for 12 weeks along with resistance exercise and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation. The trial, conducted remotely, showed that the prebiotic supplement led to changes in the gut microbiome, specifically increasing Bifidobacterium abundance. While there was no significant difference in chair rise time between the prebiotic and placebo groups, the prebiotic did improve cognition. The study suggests that simple gut microbiome interventions could enhance cognitive function in the elderly.

FOS can be considered a small dietary fibre with (like all types of fibre) low caloric value. The fermentation of FOS results in the production of gases and short chain fatty acids. The latter provide some energy to the body.

==Side-effects==
All inulin-type prebiotics, including FOS, are generally thought to stimulate the growth of &quot;Bifidobacteria&quot; species. Bifidobacteria are considered beneficial bacteria. This effect has not been uniformly found in all studies, either for bifidobacteria or for other gut organisms. FOS are also fermented by numerous bacterial species in the intestine, including &quot;Klebsiella&quot;, &quot;E. coli&quot; and many &quot;Clostridium&quot; species, which can be pathogenic in the gut. These species are responsible mainly for the gas formation (hydrogen and carbon dioxide), which results after ingestion of FOS. Studies have shown that up to 20 grams/day is well tolerated.

== Regulation==

===US FDA regulation===
FOS is classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

===NZ FSANZ regulation===
The Food Safety Authority warned parents of babies that a major European baby-formula brand made in New Zealand does not comply with local regulations (because it contains fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)), and urged them to stop using it.

===EU regulation===
FOS use has been approved in the European Union; allowing addition of FOS in restricted amounts to baby formula (for babies up to 6 months) and follow-on formula (for babies between 6 and 12 months). Infant and follow-on formula products containing FOS have been sold in the EU since 1999.

===Canadian regulations===
FOS is currently not approved for use in baby formula.

<text>WPZE (102.5 FM) is a commercial Christian radio station licensed to Mableton, Georgia, and serving Metro Georgia. It is owned by Urban One and airs an urban gospel radio format. Studios and offices are at Centennial Tower in Downtown Atlanta.

The effective radiated power (ERP) is 3,000 watts, making it a Class A FM station. The transmitter is in Southwest Atlanta, off Fairburn Road SW, near I-285.

==History==
===New Mableton Broadcasting Corp.===
The station is the result of Docket 80-90, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) plan to allow more stations on the air by reducing the required spacings. During the mid-1980s, it was decided that one of these new stations would be assigned to the west-northwest side of metro Atlanta. Several applicants requested the new allotment be assigned to one of four cities: Mableton, Lithia Springs, Douglasville, and Forest Park. The frequency already belonged to WGHR in Marietta, the student radio station at what is now Southern Polytechnic State University. However the forced downgrade to second-class status left the class D station vulnerable. It applied for the new allotment and to have it reserved to Marietta and as noncommercial but the FCC refused this, leaving WGHR with no chance of upgrading. The remaining contenders applied in 1988, and had a lengthy battle in court. After many years of legal wrangling over the frequency, the station came on the air in 2001, forcing WGHR at SPSU to move to 100.7, and then off the air completely due to WWWQ&#x27;s move-in on 100.5.

The station on 102.5 was assigned the call sign WAWE on November 24, 1997 during its construction permit. The New Mableton Broadcasting Corporation had the FCC&#x27;s permission to construct the station.

===WAMJ &quot;Grown Folks Radio&quot;===
On June 27, 2001, the station was then assigned the call letters WAMJ just before it went on the air. The call sign was moved from 107.5 FM, which then upgraded to a Class C3 station and took on the call sign WJZZ-FM, adopting a Smooth Jazz format. The Urban AC format from then-&quot;Majic 107.5&quot;, which originated three years before, came along also, although the &quot;Majic&quot; nickname was never used throughout WAMJ&#x27;s tenure on 102.5, and took on a more oldies approach to R&amp;B. (Competitor WALR did this same tactic in 2003, but only because WFOX (now WSRV) was an experimental urban station for a few years.)

In April 2004, Radio One acquired the New Mableton Broadcast Corporation for approximately $35 million. Radio One operated 102.5 FM under a local marketing agreement (LMA) beginning in August 2001. Radio One then completed this acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2004, under the name ROA Licenses (Radio One Atlanta Licenses), which also owned WJZZ-FM, WPZE, and WHTA.

In October 2005, the station changed format to Urban Adult Contemporary with the addition of current R&amp;B and soul songs, but moved back to an older playlist several months later. The station was branded as &quot;Grown Folks Radio.&quot; When attempts to secure broadcasting rights to the popular syndicated &quot;Tom Joyner Morning Show&quot; failed, WAMJ began carrying &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot; in the mornings. It also carried syndicated talk programming including Al Sharpton program and Michael Baisden during the midday and afternoon hours. Evenings and weekends remained dedicated to music.

===WPZE &quot;Praise 102.5&quot;===
WPZE originated its current format in 2001 on 97.5 FM. On February 16, 2009, &quot;Praise 97.5&quot; and the WPZE call letters moved to 102.5 FM; in turn, the urban AC format moved to 107.5 FM. On the same date, 97.5 FM changed to a simulcast of 107.5 FM, using the call sign WUMJ. At this time, the WAMJ call sign was returned to 107.5 FM (formerly WJZZ-FM) to reunite with the &quot;Majic&quot; branding.

On May 8, 2017, Radio One changed its name to Urban One, to reflect its involvement in many forms of media including radio.

<doc id="1037237" wikidata="Q539269" url="?curid=1037237" title="Bad Boys II">
<text>Bad Boys II is a 2003 American action comedy film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and the sequel to the 1995 film &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, in addition to the second film in the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; film series. Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, Theresa Randle, and Joe Pantoliano reprise their roles from the previous film, and they are joined by new cast members include Jordi Mollà, Gabrielle Union, and Peter Stormare. The film follows detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey investigating the flow of illegal drugs going into Miami.

The film was released on July 18, 2003 by Sony Pictures Releasing under the Columbia Pictures label. It received generally negative reviews from critics; however, it performed well commercially, grossing $273 million worldwide, becoming the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2003. Two sequels, &quot;Bad Boys for Life&quot; and &quot;Bad Boys: Ride or Die&quot;, were released in 2020 and 2024, respectively.

==Plot==
Eight years after taking down Fouchet, Miami PD detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett are investigating drug trafficking of ecstasy in Miami. They infiltrate a Klan meeting, only to discover that they are buyers, not distributors. After a radio malfunction leads to a delayed arrival of the Miami Police&#x27;s Tactical Narcotics Team (TNT), Mike and Marcus end up in a shootout with the Klansmen. While covering Marcus, Mike inadvertently shoots him in the buttocks.

These antics reinforce Marcus&#x27; doubt about whether he should remain partners with Mike, who is secretly dating Syd, Marcus&#x27; younger sister. Marcus is waiting for the right time to tell Mike he is transferring out of the TNT Unit. Unbeknownst to both Marcus and Mike, Syd is working undercover for the DEA as a money launderer to a branch of the Russian mafia operating in Miami&#x27;s drug trade. They are distributors working with drug lord Hector Juan Carlos &quot;Johnny&quot; Tapia.

After laundering a large sum of money, Syd is intercepted by a Haitian Zoe Pound gang while she is transporting the money. Mike and Marcus, working on a tip from an informant, had been following the Haitians. This leads to an extensive gun battle and car chase through Miami and across the MacArthur Causeway, resulting in significant collateral damage. Mike and Marcus are reprimanded by Captain Howard, who is further miffed to find out the DEA is running an investigation in the city without consulting him first.

Mike and Marcus track down the Haitians, interrogate the leader, and learn from one of their video cameras that Tapia is using a local mortuary as a front for his operations. To gain more intel, the officers pose as pest exterminators responding to a rat infestation at Tapia&#x27;s Miami residence. Meanwhile, Tapia begins a mixed business-personal relationship with Syd, wherein he intends for her to launder all the money for his operation.

Later, Mike and Marcus infiltrate Tapia&#x27;s mortuary. Inside, they discover that Tapia is using cadavers and coffins to smuggle drugs and money in and out of the country. The evidence is sufficient for Captain Howard to authorize a raid on both Tapia&#x27;s residence and the mortuary, in collaboration with the DEA and the U.S. Coast Guard.

Nearly all of Tapia&#x27;s drug supply and money are confiscated in the raid, though Tapia flees to Cuba with Syd as a hostage, having found out about her being a DEA agent during the raid on Tapia&#x27;s home before he could be apprehended. Tapia uses Syd as a bargaining chip, demanding the return of his money in 48 hours. Mike and Marcus form a black-ops team with agents from the DEA, TNT, and Captain Howard&#x27;s contacts from the CIA to rescue Syd. The team is inserted by the Coast Guard a few miles off the coast of Cuba, where they rendezvous with fellow officer Vargas&#x27;s brother, Tito, who is head of the local Alpha 66 underground resistance there. He assists the teams with weapons, a tunnel network, and an accurate mapping of Tapia&#x27;s new mansion.

The team raids Tapia&#x27;s mansion, rescues Syd, and leaves a large explosive device that demolishes the mansion upon the team&#x27;s exfiltration. Marcus, Mike, Syd, and Tito steal a yellow Hummer H2 as they escape from Cuban military forces controlled by Tapia. Tapia survives and pursues the group, ultimately ending up outside of Guantanamo Bay. Not recognized as U.S. citizens, the Navy personnel on the base shoot at both Mike and Marcus as well as Tapia&#x27;s vehicles, prompting them to stop just as they enter a live minefield. Marcus kills Tapia while the latter holds Mike at gunpoint. Tapia&#x27;s body falls backward onto a mine, which obliterates his corpse.

Mike, Marcus, and Syd celebrate at a barbecue in Marcus&#x27; backyard with his family; Marcus has decided to remain partners with Mike.

==Production==
=== Development and writing ===
In August 1995, the Los Angeles Times reported that Producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson were planning to make a sequel to &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, with filming set to begin in 1996.

Writer/Director Tom Dey had re-written a previous draft, and was set to make his directorial debut on the film.

By 1997, plans were scrapped after Sony executives were dissatisfied with the script.

Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris turned down an offer to direct the film.

Cormac and Marianne Wibberley were asked by an executive at Jerry Bruckheimer Films to come in with an idea for the sequel, the duo wrote a first draft, pitched it, and Bruckheimer liked it.

In March 2002, it was reported that Ron Shelton was rewriting the script.

Jerry Stahl was hired and did a rewrite on Shelton&#x27;s script, initially brought on board for a week-long rewrite of the script, he wound up staying on for several weeks, Stahl would later claim that only snippets of his dialogue remain in the film.

John Lee Hancock was then hired by the studio and Bruckheimer to do a rewrite, Bay initially balked at Bruckheimer&#x27;s choice of Hancock, skeptical that the writer was right for an action movie, as Bruckheimer recalled: &quot;I reminded Michael that John was a director himself, so he knows a director’s problems and how to solve them&quot;. Hancock was tasked with making the script less simplistic, in addition to adding subplots, and more conflict, giving each protagonist a secret. Hancock left after three weeks to start production on &quot;The Alamo&quot;.

Judd Apatow was hired to do a rewrite on the script, with assistance from Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, according to Rogen, him and Goldberg were broke, so Apatow gave them a bit of money to help him on the script, they ended up contributing a few gags.

After Apatow&#x27;s rewrite, Brian Koppelman and David Levien were brought in towards the end of shooting to do punch up work on the characters; they worked on the script for a week.

Other writers, such as Ron Bass, Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, Larry Ferguson, George Gallo, Tony Gilroy, Dan Gordon, Brian Helgeland, Gregory Allen Howard, Todd Robinson, and Marshall Todd were brought in at various points throughout the developmental process to either write their own draft, or rewrite the script.

The final screenplay was credited to Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl, with story credit going to Shelton and the Wibberleys.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography took place between July and December 2002, mostly in Miami. The eastbound lanes for MacArthur Causeway were shut down in early August 2002 to allow filming. Filming also occupied one side of Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, while &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; was shot on the other side around the same time.

==Music==
==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Bad Boys II&quot; was a financial success. For its opening weekend, the film generated $46.5 million, making it the fourth-highest opening weekend for an R-rated film, behind &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, &quot;Hannibal&quot; and &quot;8 Mile&quot;. It managed to beat out &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; to reach the number one spot. Although &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; dropped into third place behind the latter film and &quot;Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over&quot; with a 52.6% decline, it still made $22 million while keeping above &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life&quot; and &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;. In the United Kingdom, it made $10 million, making it the country&#x27;s second-highest-grossing film released in October 2003, behind &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. The film made $138 million North America and $135 million in other territories, totaling $273 million worldwide against a budget of $130 million, almost twice the gross of the original film, and was the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2003.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; holds an approval rating 24% based on 186 reviews, with an average rating of 4.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Two and a half hours of explosions and witless banter.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale, same as the first film.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one out of a possible four stars, especially offended by one scene involving a teenage boy and the use of the N-Word, saying, &quot;The needless cruelty of this scene took me out of the movie and into the minds of its makers. What were they thinking? Have they so lost touch with human nature that they think audiences will like this scene?&quot; On an episode of &quot;At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;, film critic Richard Roeper named &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; the worst film of 2003.

James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; was even more negative about the film, rating it half a star out of four and stating: &quot;&quot;Bad Boys II&quot; isn&#x27;t just bad - it&#x27;s a catastrophic violation of every aspect of cinema that I as a film critic hold dear.&quot;

Among the more positive reviews was &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; critic Ellen A. Kim, who wrote that the film was &quot;mindlessly fun... If you like this type of movie, that is.&quot; The film was also praised by a few critics and viewers for its deftly handled action sequences and visual effects.

===Accolades===

At the 2004 MTV Movie Awards, the film was nominated for &quot;Best Action Sequence&quot; for the inter-coastal freeway pursuit and &quot;Best On-Screen Team&quot;, but lost to &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; and &quot;50 First Dates&quot;, respectively.

&quot;Bad Boys II&quot; was nominated at the 2nd Annual Visual Effects Society Awards (VES) for &quot;Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Motion Picture&quot;.

At the 2003 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film won the award for Worst Sequel. It was also nominated for Most Intrusive Musical Score, but lost to &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot;.

===Megan Fox&#x27;s cameo===
In retrospect there has been criticism of director Michael Bay for the then-15-year-old Megan Fox in a scene at a strip club as a dancer, covered in water and portrayed suggestively, Megan Fox in an interview had criticized Michael Bay for this &quot;At 15! I was in 10th grade. That&#x27;s kind of a microcosm of how Bay&#x27;s mind works&quot; in an interview, later on this caught some media attention and criticism.

Later on, Fox commented on the situation &quot;when it comes to my direct experiences with Michael, and Steven (Spielberg) for that matter, I was never assaulted or preyed upon in what I felt was a sexual manner. I&#x27;m thankful to all of you who are brave enough to speak out and I&#x27;m grateful to all of you who are taking it upon yourselves to support, uplift, and bring comfort to those who have been harmed by a violent and toxic societal paradigm.&quot;

==In other media==

===Video game===
A video game version of the film, known as &quot;Bad Boys: Miami Takedown&quot; in North America, was released in 2004 on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Windows. Originally planned for release in late 2003 (to tie in with the film&#x27;s DVD release), the game was pushed back several months. The game failed to deliver any sort of sales or critical acclaim due to poor development; it was given low ratings from many game websites.

==Sequel==

In June 2008, Bay stated that he may direct &quot;Bad Boys III&quot;, but that the greatest obstacle to the potential sequel would be the cost, as he and Will Smith demand some of the highest salaries in the film industry. By August 2009, Columbia Pictures had hired Peter Craig to write the script for &quot;Bad Boys III&quot;. In February 2011, Martin Lawrence reiterated that the film was in development. In June 2014, Bruckheimer announced that screenwriter David Guggenheim was working on the storyline for the sequel. Two months later, Lawrence said a script had been written and parts had been cast. By June 2015, director Joe Carnahan was in early talks to write and possibly direct the film. Two months later, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that &quot;Bad Boys III&quot; would be released on February 17, 2017, and that additional sequel, &quot;Bad Boys IV&quot;, is scheduled for release on July 3, 2019. On March 5, 2016, the film was pushed to June 2, 2017. Producers planned to begin production in early 2017. On August 11, 2016, the film was pushed back once again to January 12, 2018, to avoid box office competition with the upcoming DC Comics film &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, and retitled &quot;Bad Boys for Life&quot;. Lawrence revealed on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; that filming may start in March 2017. On February 6, 2017, it was announced that the film&#x27;s release date has been delayed for the third time, to November 9, 2018. On March 7, 2017, Carnahan left the movie due to scheduling conflicts. In August 2017, Sony removed the third film from their release schedule and later in the month Lawrence said the film would not be happening.

In February 2018, it was reported that a sequel film was again being planned and will be directed by Belgian directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, after development on &quot;Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F&quot; stalled, with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith reprising their roles. Joe Pantoliano also reprised his role as Captain Howard. Filming began in January 2019.

==Television series==
In October 2017, a spin-off television series centered on Gabrielle Union&#x27;s character, was announced to be in development by Brandon Margolis and Brandon Sonnier. Later that month NBC ordered the pilot episode of the series.
By March 2018, Jessica Alba was cast as the co-star with Gabrielle Union. In addition to Union, John Salley will also reprise his role as Fletcher, a computer hacker who helps Mike and Marcus in the film series. The following month, the title of the series was revealed as &quot;LA&#x27;s Finest&quot;, with Jerry Bruckheimer serving as executive producer for the series. Later that month, NBC passed on the pilot, and the show was shopped around to other networks. NBC&#x27;s boss, Bob Greenblatt, said: “These are all tough calls. We did have an embarrassment of riches. And when we laid out the schedule and the calendar all season...it was a show that didn’t fit in the grand scheme of it.”

That same month, it was revealed that Sony Pictures Television, was negotiating with Charter Communications about picking up the series. By June 2018, Canada&#x27;s Bell Media picked it up for 13 episodes. Charter gave its series order on June 26, intent on making it Spectrum&#x27;s first original series.

== Home media ==
&quot;Bad Boys II&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on December 9, 2003, by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment. A Blu-ray release followed on November 10, 2015. &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; was included in a two film collection that includes the first film which was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on September 4, 2018.

<text>David Testo (born August 7, 1981) is an American retired soccer player who, after his playing career ended in 2011, became the first male American professional player of that sport to come out as gay. Testo played professionally from 2003 to 2011, including two years in with the Columbus Crew from 2004 to 2005. He began his career with the Richmond Kickers, and also played for the Vancouver Whitecaps and Montreal Impact before he was released by the Impact in 2011. He played collegiately for South Carolina and North Carolina.

==Career==

===College===
After a standout prep career at Asheville, North Carolina&#x27;s TC Roberson High School, where he was named the North Carolina state player of the year in 1998, Testo played his first and second years of college soccer at the University of South Carolina, where he registered six goals and 11 assists in 33 games. After his sophomore season, Testo moved to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he emerged as a major force, helping lead the Tar Heels to an NCAA Championship his junior season. Testo was named to the All-ACC second team both his seasons at UNC, after scoring 11 goals and six assists as a junior, and seven goals and nine assists as a senior.

===Professional===

Upon graduating from college, Testo went undrafted in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft despite his experience with the youth U.S. national teams. Testo signed with the Richmond Kickers, with whom he made an immediate impact, playing in 28 games and scoring six goals. For his performance, Testo was named the A-League&#x27;s 2003 Rookie of the Year.

After his performance in the A-League, he joined the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer. Due to many injuries, Testo was sidelined; however, he received more action in 2005. After ending that season with a goal and multiple assists, Testo was released. He then signed with the Vancouver Whitecaps.

He was named Newcomer of the Year and was second in team scoring (seven goals, seven assists) behind Joey Gjertsen (13 goals, seven assists) while playing both as a striker and in his preferred midfield positions equally well. Testo assisted on both Whitecaps goals scored in the final five minutes of OT in the USL semifinal match on September 24 when the Caps defeated Montreal 2–0 to earn a spot in the USL championship game against Rochester on September 30.

The Whitecaps became the first team in USL history to win a championship game on the road as they withstood a fifteen-minute all-out attack by the Rhinos to start the game and then dominated their hosts to win 3–0 before 10,000 partisan and rain-soaked fans. The &#x27;Caps scored 11 goals and only surrendered one (on a free kick) in five playoff games and one OT period. Vancouver&#x27;s second goal in this game was a result of Testo&#x27;s pass to Gjertsen who one-timed it to a charging Tony Donatelli; Tony held on for an interminable two seconds before powering it home to the back of the net. Testo earned an assist on the final goal with a pass to Matondo who scored easily to end all doubt. Testo started celebrating by running into the stands to hug his mother who had come up from North Carolina to join a small but vocal contingent of Whitecaps supporters.

Testo was traded to the Montreal Impact on July 26, 2007, along with Joey Gjertsen for Alen Marcina, and Zé Roberto. He recorded his first goal for Montreal on August 1, 2007, against Carolina Railhawks. During the 2008 USL season Testo played in 20 matches for the Impact, and scored one goal against Miami FC on July 18, 2008. In the 2008 Canadian Championship he appeared in all four matches for the Impact, and scored a goal in 2–0 victory over the Vancouver Whitecaps. He helped the Impact qualify for the first time for the CONCACAF Champions League by winning the Canadian Championship. During the club&#x27;s playoff run Testo scored in the quarterfinal match against Portland Timbers.

During the 2009 USL season Testo contributed by helping the Impact clinch a playoff spot under new head coach Marc Dos Santos. He recorded his first playoff goal in the quarterfinal match against Charleston Battery. The match resulted in 2–1 victory for the Impact, and allowing the Impact to advance to the finals by winning their second match on aggregate. Montreal would advance on to the finals where their opponents would end up being the Vancouver Whitecaps, thus marking the first time in USL history where the final match would consist of two Canadian clubs. In the final Testo helped the Impact win the series 6–3 on aggregate. The victory gave the Impact their third USL Championship and also the victory marked Testo&#x27;s second USL Championship. On October 6, 2009, Testo received the Giuseppe-Saputo Trophy, presented to the Impact&#x27;s Most Valuable Player during the team&#x27;s 2009 awards banquet. On November 30, 2009, Testo signed a new two-year deal with the club.

Testo was released by Montreal on October 12, 2011.

In 2019, he appeared in &quot;Standing on the Line&quot;, a documentary film about homophobia in sports by Paul-Émile d&#x27;Entremont.

==Personal life==
In an interview on French Canadian public broadcaster Radio Canada that was aired on November 10, 2011, Testo announced he was gay and that his family, friends, teammates, and team management were aware of his sexuality. Testo became the first American professional soccer player to come out as gay.

Testo is a member of the advisory board for You Can Play, a campaign dedicated to fighting homophobia in sports.

<doc id="1037251" wikidata="Q1143659" url="?curid=1037251" title="Nippon Ichi Software">
<text>is a Japanese video game developer and publisher. The company was founded in 1991 and has developed several role-playing video games, most notably the &quot;Disgaea&quot; and &quot;Marl Kingdom&quot; series. Its mascot is the penguin-like &quot;Disgaea&quot; character Prinny.

NIS America, a localization and global publishing branch of the company, was founded in 2003. It originally focused solely on the North American market until being expanded to include Europe and other regions in 2007 and has also published anime.

==History==
Nippon Ichi Software was founded in September 1991 in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, as an entertainment software company. It was relocated and reincorporated on July 12, 1993. The company has made several acquisitions, mergers, and forming new subsidiaries. In the early 2010s, the company formed Nippon Ichi Software Asia Pte. Ltd and Nippon Ichi Software Vietnam Co., Ltd. In 2016, NIS merged with System Prisma Corporation and acquired developer FOG Inc. In 2012, the company was awarded the Guinness World Record for being the company that released the most strategy RPGs.

The company has developed a number of traditional role-playing video games. Many characters from previous games make their way into later games as secret characters, even though their respective games may not be directly connected. Their flagship franchise, &quot;Disgaea&quot;, takes place in the same universe.

===Games===
===Nippon Ichi Indie Spirits===
Nippon Ichi Indie Spirits, a label under which the company localises non-Japanese indie games for the Japanese market, was formed on December 28, 2016. The label&#x27;s first games, &quot;Nidhogg&quot;, &quot;Back to Bed&quot;, and &quot;Emily Wants to Play&quot;, were released in February 2017. All games that are published through this program are only released digitally.

==NIS America==
NIS America, a localization and global publishing branch of Nippon Ichi Software, was founded on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, it originally focused solely on the North American market until being expanded to include Europe and other regions in 2007. The branch was the result of the company&#x27;s wish to focus on international publication of their works in the United States, given the increased popularity of their games outside of Japan. Prior to 2003, NIS games were released in English by contracted publishers. Some of the company&#x27;s more well-known releases include entries in the &quot;Atelier&quot;, &quot;Ys&quot;, and &quot;Trails&quot; series, among others.

His art style has been described as &quot;crazy and bizarre&quot; and features everything from demon children, to freaky pigs in royal clothing. His signature character, Pleinair, has appeared in Disgaea and Phantom Brave.

<doc id="1037259" wikidata="Q256886" url="?curid=1037259" title="Lemovii">
<text>The Lemovii were a Germanic tribe, only once named by Tacitus in the late 1st century. He noted that they lived near the Rugii and both lived east of the Gutones, who are lived in the delta of the Vistula river. All three of these peoples they had short swords and round shields.

The Oksywie culture is associated with parts of the Rugii and Lemovii. Also, the Plöwen group () of the Uecker-Randow region is associated with the Lemovii.

The archaeological Dębczyn group might comprise the remnants of the Lemovii, probably identical with Widsith&#x27;s Glommas, who are believed to have been the neighbors of the Rugii, a tribe dwelling at the Baltic Sea coast in today&#x27;s Pomerania region before the migration period. Both &quot;Lemovii&quot; and &quot;Glommas&quot; translate to &quot;the barking&quot;. Germanic sagas report a battle on the isle of Hiddensee between king Hetel (Hethin, Heodin of the Glommas) and Rugian king Hagen, following the abduction of Hagen&#x27;s daughter Hilde by Hetel. Yet, there are also other hypotheses about the location of the Lemovii, and that their identification as Glommas, though probable, is not certain.

The Lemovii have also been equated with Jordanes&#x27; Turcilingi, together with the Rugii with Ptolemy&#x27;s Rhoutikleioi, also with Ptolemy&#x27;s Leuonoi and with the Leonas of the Widsith.

<doc id="1037263" wikidata="Q1677074" url="?curid=1037263" title="Jack Jewsbury">
<text>Jack Jewsbury (born April 13, 1981) is a retired American soccer player who played primarily as a midfielder. Upon his retirement in 2016, Jewsbury was one of ten players to have appeared in more than 350 matches in Major League Soccer.

==Career==
===Youth and college===
Jewsbury was born in Joplin, Missouri. He attended Kickapoo High School in Springfield, Missouri, where he scored a state record 59 goals in his senior season and 124 goals in his four-year high school career. He was named First-team All-Midwest Region, All-State, All-District, All-Ozark Conference and conference Player of the Year as a senior, and was a three-time All-District and All-State selection, before having his #21 jersey retired.

Jewsbury played five years of college soccer at Saint Louis University, finishing his career tied for tenth on the school&#x27;s all-time scoring list with 101 points. Jewsbury was twice named first team All-Conference USA, winning the Conference Player of the Year award as a sophomore. During his college years, he also played with Kansas City Brass in the Premier Development League.

===Professional===
====Kansas City Wizards====
Jewsbury was drafted 43rd overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by the Kansas City Wizards, and signed to a developmental contract. As a rookie, Jewsbury struggled for playing time, appearing for only 61 minutes all season. In July and August 2003, the Wizards sent Jewsbury on loan to the Syracuse Salty Dogs of the USL A-League. In his second year, however, Jewsbury played much more, becoming a significant utility player for the Wizards. That year he helped the club capture the 2004 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup and the Western Conference title. He continued to progress with the club and soon became a very influential player for Kansas City. In eight years with the club, the central midfielder would appear in 195 league matches and score 14 goals.

====Portland Timbers====
Jewsbury was traded to the Portland Timbers for allocation money on March 1, 2011. Jewsbury was given the captain&#x27;s armband, becoming the expansion side&#x27;s first captain in MLS. Jewsbury was named to the 2011 MLS All-Star Game, finishing the season with career highs in both goals and assists. In the 2012 season, Jewsbury scored the winning goal as Portland defeated the Vancouver Whitecaps to win the Cascadia Cup trophy. As his playing time declined, Jewsbury was named &quot;club captain&quot; as other players took over the role of on-field captain. Jewsbury appeared in all of the Timbers&#x27; playoff games during his tenure with the club, including the Timbers&#x27; victory in MLS Cup 2015.

====Retirement====
Jewsbury announced his retirement in September 2016, during the annual &quot;Stand Together&quot; community outreach banquet hosted by the Timbers and the Portland Thorns. Several players, including long-time teammate Darlington Nagbe, expressed their appreciation of Jewsbury.

After retiring, Jewsbury was hired by the Timbers in a non-playing capacity as Director of Business Development.

<text>Stanley F. &quot;Stan&quot; Lombardo (alias Hae Kwang; born June 19, 1943) is an American Classicist, and former professor of Classics at the University of Kansas.

He is best known for his translations of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (published by the Hackett Publishing Company). The style of his translations is a more vernacular one, emphasizing conversational English rather than the formal tone of some older American English translations of classical verse. Lombardo designs his translations to be performed orally, as they were in ancient Greece. He also performs the poems, and has recorded them as audio books. In performance he also likes to play the drums, much like Ezra Pound.

==Biography==
Of Italian ancestry, Lombardo is a native of New Orleans. He has a BA from Loyola University in New Orleans, an MA from Tulane University, and a PhD from the University of Texas (1976). In 1976 he joined the faculty at the University of Kansas, where he served as department chair for fifteen years and taught Greek and Latin at all levels, as well as general courses on Greek literature and culture. He was appointed University of Kansas Honors Program director in 2004.

Lombardo is a Zen master in the Kwan Um School of Zen. Along with his wife, Judith Roitman, who is a retired professor of mathematics at the 
University of Kansas and a published poet, he was a founding member of the Kansas Zen Center.

<doc id="1037273" wikidata="Q847613" url="?curid=1037273" title="Wenceslas Square">
<text>Wenceslas Square (Czech: , colloquially &quot;Václavák&quot; ) is one of the main city squares and the centre of the business and cultural communities in the New Town of Prague, Czech Republic. Many historical events occurred there, and it is a traditional setting for demonstrations, celebrations, and other public gatherings. It is also the place with the busiest pedestrian traffic in the whole country. The square is named after Saint Wenceslas, the patron saint of Bohemia. It is part of the historic centre of Prague, a World Heritage Site.

Formerly known as Koňský trh (&quot;Horse Market&quot;), for its periodic accommodation of horse markets during the Middle Ages, it was renamed Svatováclavské náměstí (English: &quot;Saint Wenceslas square&quot;) in 1848 on the proposal of Karel Havlíček Borovský.

==Features==


Less a square than a boulevard, Wenceslas Square has the shape of a very long (750 m, total area 45,000 m2) rectangle, in a northwest–southeast direction. The street slopes upward to the southeast side. At that end, the street is dominated by the grand neoclassical Czech National Museum. The northwest end runs up against the border between the New Town and the Old Town.

==History==
In 1348, Bohemian King Charles IV founded the New Town of Prague. The plan included several open areas for markets, of which the second largest was the &quot;Koňský trh&quot;, or Horse Market (the largest was the Charles Square). At the southeastern end of the market was the Horse Gate, one of the gates in the walls of the New Town.

The Statue of Saint Wenceslas formerly stood in the middle of Wenceslas Square, near Grandhotel Evropa, it was moved to Vyšehrad in 1879. During the Czech National Revival movement in the Czech lands of Austria-Hungary in the 19th century, a more noble name for the street was requested. At this time the square was renamed and new Statue of Saint Wenceslas was built in 1912.

On 28 October 1918, Alois Jirásek read the Czechoslovak declaration of independence in front of the Saint Wenceslas statue.

During the 1938 May Crisis, the square was the site of massive demonstrations against Nazi Germany&#x27;s demands for the Sudetenland and the appeasement policies of the First Czechoslovak Republic&#x27;s allies the United Kingdom and France. Under the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the Nazi occupation force used the street for mass demonstrations. During the Prague Uprising in 1945, a few buildings near the National Museum were destroyed. They were later replaced by department stores.

On 16 January 1969, student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Wenceslas Square to protest the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.

On 28 March 1969, the Czechoslovak national ice hockey team defeated the USSR team for the second time in that year&#x27;s Ice Hockey World Championships. As the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was still under Soviet occupation, the victory induced great celebrations. An estimated 150,000 people gathered on Wenceslas Square, and skirmishes with police developed. A group of provocateurs then attacked the Prague office of the Soviet airline Aeroflot, located on the street. The vandalism served as a pretext for reprisals and the period of so-called normalization.

In 1989, during the Velvet Revolution, large demonstrations (with hundreds of thousands of people or more) were held here.

Wenceslas Square is lined by hotels, offices, retail stores, currency exchange booths and fast-food joints. Many strip clubs also operate around Wenceslas Square. Wenceslas Square is also a popular place to spend the New Year&#x27;s celebrations, another popular option are terraces near the river. The Christmas markets (&quot;Vánoční trhy&quot;) are held here every year from early December to the first week of January.

===Reconstruction===

A reconstruction of the Wenceslas Square has been underway since 2020. The lower part was completed in 2023. Construction of the new upper part (from Vodičkova street) is to begin in June 2024. It will include wider sidewalks, tram tracks, bicycle paths, new alleys and reduction of the space dedicated to motor traffic. Full completion is scheduled for summer 2027. The expected cost is 1.24 billion Czech crowns.

==Art and architecture==



The two obvious landmarks of Wenceslas Square are at the southeast, uphill end: the 1885–1891 National Museum Building, designed by Czech architect Josef Schulz, and the statue of Wenceslas.

Other significant buildings on the square include:
* Antonin Pfeiffer and Matěj Blecha&#x27;s &quot;Palác Koruna&quot; office building and shopping center, #1–2, 1912–1914, with architectural sculpture by Vojtěch Sucharda
* Ludvík Kysela&#x27;s &quot;Lindt Building&quot;, No. 4, an early work of architectural constructivism
* the BAŤA shoe store, No. 6, 1929
* Matěj Blecha and Emil Králíček&#x27;s &quot;Adam Pharmacy&quot;, No. 8, 1911–1913
* Jan Kotěra&#x27;s &quot;Peterka Building&quot;, No. 12, 1899–1900
* Pavel Janák&#x27;s &quot;Hotel Juliš&quot;, No. 22, 1926
* Alois Dryák&#x27;s &quot;Hotel Evropa&quot;, #25–27, 1872, 1905 redesign, with architectural sculptor Ladislav Šaloun
* Antonin Wiehl&#x27;s &quot;Wiehl House&quot;, No. 34, 1896
* the &quot;Melantrich Building&quot;, No. 36, 1914, where Alexander Dubček and Václav Havel appeared together on its balcony in November 1989, a major event of the Velvet Revolution
* &quot;Hotel Adria&quot;, No 26, reconstruction in 1912, in 1918 sold to František Tichý, Burian&#x27;s Theatre (1925–1928)

==Transport==
The Prague Metro&#x27;s line A runs underneath Wenceslas Square, and the Metro&#x27;s two busiest stations, Muzeum (lines A and C) and Můstek (lines A and B), have entrances on the street. Currently trams only cut across the square. Tram tracks running the length of the square were removed in 1980; a proposal to reintroduce the tram line has been approved, with construction beginning in 2024. Most of the street is open to automobile traffic, but the northwestern end has been pedestrianised since 2012.

==Literary references==

* A tavern in the square, &quot;the Golden Goose&quot;, is mentioned in Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;Amerika&quot;, as the place where the Manageress previously worked.

<text>Moazzam Begg (; born 5 July 1968 in Sparkhill, Birmingham) is a British Pakistani who was held in extrajudicial detention by the US government in the Bagram Theater Internment Facility and the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp, in Cuba, for nearly three years. Seized by Pakistani intelligence at his home in Pakistan in February 2002, he was transferred to the custody of US Army officers, who held him in the detention centre at Bagram, Afghanistan, before transferring him to Guantanamo Bay, where he was held until January 2005.

The US authorities held Begg as an enemy combatant, claiming Begg was an al-Qaeda member, who recruited for, and provided money for, al-Qaeda training camps, and himself trained there to fight US or allied troops. Begg acknowledged having spent time at two non-al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan in the early 1990s, as well as providing some financial support to fighters in Bosnia and Chechnya, but denies that he was ever involved in terrorism.

Begg says that he was abused by guards at Bagram, and saw two detainees beaten to death. Military coroners subsequently ruled that the two deaths were homicides, but US military spokesmen denied Begg&#x27;s story at the time. Later, a 2005 military investigation into reports of abuse at Bagram concluded that both deaths were caused by abuse by American guards.

Following a &quot;long public outcry&quot; in the UK over the detention of British nationals, in 2004, the UK government intervened on behalf of the British citizens being detained at Guantanamo Bay. President George W. Bush had Begg released without charge on 25 January 2005, despite Pentagon, CIA, and FBI objections. Begg and other British citizens who had been detained at Guantanamo later sued the British government for complicity in their alleged abuse and torture while in US custody. In November 2010, the British Government announced an out-of-court financial settlement with 16 detainees, including Begg.

After his release, Begg became a media commentator on issues pertaining to the US, UK and international anti-terror measures. He toured as a speaker about Guantanamo and other detention facilities. Begg co-authored a book, and has written newspaper and magazine articles. He was interviewed in &quot;Taxi to the Dark Side&quot; (2007), a documentary about the death in custody of an Afghan detainee and the mistreatment of prisoners held by Americans in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

In 2014, British police arrested Begg, alleging terrorist activities during the Syrian civil war. Charges were later withdrawn and he was released when the prosecution became aware that MI5 had known of, and consented to, his travel to Syria.

==Life before detention==

===Early life and education===
Moazzam Begg was born in Sparkhill in 1968, and grew up in Moseley, both suburbs of Birmingham. His father, Azmat Begg, was born in British India and lived in Pakistan before emigrating with his wife to Great Britain. Begg&#x27;s mother died when he was six, and his father initially worked in Britain as a bank manager. Begg holds dual UK–Pakistani citizenship.

Begg attended the Jewish King David School, Birmingham, from age 5 to 11, because his father thought it promoted good values. Begg later attended Moseley Secondary School. During secondary school, he became a member of the Lynx gang, a Birmingham street gang. The group was mostly Pakistani, but also included Algerian, Asian, Afro-Caribbean and Irish youths. The group was founded in the early 1970s to fight attacks by far right anti-immigrant groups. He said &quot;we did things that no good Muslim should,&quot; but stated he rarely did anything violent. He once appeared in court for taking part in a fight with skinheads.

Begg attended Solihull College, and later the University of Wolverhampton, where he studied Law for two years, which he did not enjoy and did not complete his degree.

===UK and travels to Islamic countries, 1993–98===
On a family holiday to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in his late teens, Begg became interested in Islam. In late 1993 he returned to Pakistan and crossed the Pakistani–Afghan border with some young Pakistanis near the city of Khost. Begg said he visited a camp where US-backed nationalist and Islamic rebels were training to fight the Soviet-backed Afghan government. The training camp was run by either the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance or a Pakistani group fighting for Kashmir. Begg later wrote of his time at the camp: &quot;I had met men who seemed to me exemplary in their faith and self-sacrifice, and seen a world that awed and inspired me&quot;. Begg says he did not participate in the training.

Inspired by the commitment of the &quot;mujahedeen,&quot; Begg said he travelled to Bosnia in the early 1990s to help the Muslims during the war. He said he was &quot;terribly affected by some of the stories ... of the atrocities taking place there&quot;. In 1994 he joined a charity that worked with Muslims in Bosnia. He states he &quot;very briefly&quot; joined the Bosnian Army Foreign Volunteer Force: &quot;In Bosnia, I did fight for a while. But I saw people horribly damaged, and I thought, This is not for me&quot;. Begg first met Khalil Deek in Bosnia.

Begg also tried to travel to Chechnya, in the early 1990s during its war with Russia. While he thought that &quot;fighting wasn&#x27;t out of the question,&quot; he says that he did not participate in the armed struggle, but did give financial support to the foreign fighters.

In 1994, Begg was arrested charged with conspiracy to defraud the Department of Social Security. His friend and fellow &quot;Lynx Gang&quot; member Syed Murad Meah Butt was also charged, pleaded guilty, and served 18 months in jail. The fraud charges against Begg were dropped for lack of evidence.

A search of his home by anti-terrorist police, at the time of the 1994 arrest, reportedly found night vision goggles, a flak jacket, and &quot;extremist Islamic literature&quot;. Other items found included a hand-held night vision lens. Begg insisted that the goggles and flak jacket were from his charity work in Bosnia and Chechnya and denied owning any &quot;extremist Islamic literature&quot; and noted the items seized were identical to those that many aid workers operating in conflict zones carry. His father said Begg had been collecting military paraphernalia as a hobby since childhood.

In 2005, after Begg&#x27;s detention at Guantanamo became public knowledge, the US Justice Department alleged he had &quot;received extensive training in al-Qaeda terrorist camps since 1993&quot;. Pentagon officials said that Begg trained at three terrorist camps associated with al-Qaeda. While at the training camps, he reportedly trained to use handguns, AK-47 rifles, and RPGs and to plan ambushes. The statement identified Begg as &quot;a member of al-Qaeda and affiliated organisations,&quot; who was &quot;engaged in hostilities against the United States and its coalition partners&quot; in Afghanistan and said he &quot;provided support to al-Qaeda terrorists, by providing shelter for their families while the al-Qaeda terrorists committed terrorist acts&quot;. Begg has denied all these charges, saying that he has &quot;never planned, aided or participated in any attacks against Westerners&quot;.

===Marriage and move to Pakistan===
In 1995, Begg married, and in early 1998, he and his new family moved to Peshawar, Pakistan. An American counterterrorism official claimed that the CIA and MI5 suspected Begg had worked with Khalil Deek, who also lived in Peshawar at that time, to create a CD-ROM terrorist manual. Begg said in interviews that he had met Deek in Bosnia and later collaborated with him on a business enterprise to sell traditional Pakistani clothing, but said he had never met Zubaydah. Pentagon officials said this conflicts with what he told interrogators.

Begg notes that he visited a second Afghan training camp, near Jalalabad, for two or three days during that time. He says it was run by Iraqi Kurds, not by al-Qaeda. They were training to use improvised incendiary grenades to fight Saddam Hussein. He donated a few hundred British pounds to that camp and a third training camp. A Pentagon spokesman said Begg spent five days in early 1998 at Derunta, an al-Qaeda-affiliated Afghan training camp. Defense Department officials said that Begg&#x27;s sworn statements state he trained at Derunta and two other Afghan camps. He denied saying that, but acknowledged signing some documents while in custody because he feared for his life.

===UK, 1998–2001===
Begg returned to Birmingham in 1998 and, along with Imran Khan, a former stockbroker, opened the &#x27;Maktabah Al Ansar&#x27; Islamic book and video shop, in Sparkhill, Birmingham. Police raided the shop the following year. In 1999, Begg&#x27;s bookstore commissioned and published a book by Dhiren Barot about Barot&#x27;s experiences in Kashmir, entitled &quot;The Army of Madinah in Kashmir.&quot;

In February 2000, police and MI5 officers investigating Islamic terrorism raided the bookshop, took away books, files and computers, questioned staff and arrested Begg under British anti-terrorism laws. Begg was released without charge. Begg&#x27;s father said the British government retrieved encrypted files from his son&#x27;s computer, and ordered Begg to open them, but Begg refused. A judge ruled that Begg could not be compelled to unlock the files.

Ruhal Ahmed was one of the so-called &#x27;Tipton Three,&#x27; young men from Tipton in Britain who were held as Guantanamo detainees. While incarcerated in Guantanamo, he is alleged to have told investigators that he had first become interested in jihad in summer 2000 after purchasing books on the subject from the Maktabah Al Ansar bookshop.

Begg&#x27;s home in the UK was raided by anti-terrorist police in the summer of 2001. They took his computer and some related materials, but he was not charged.

===Afghanistan and Pakistan, July 2001 – February 2002===
With his wife Zaynab and three young children, Begg moved to Kabul, Afghanistan, in late July 2001. At the time, the Taliban ruled Afghanistan. Begg considered it an economical place to bring up his family, and one where they would not be harassed for their race. He wrote in his autobiography that by 2001 the Taliban had made &quot;some modest progress — in social justice and upholding pure, old Islamic values forgotten in many Islamic countries&quot;. Begg has since criticised the Taliban for its human rights abuses.

He says that he moved to Kabul to build wells in northwest Afghanistan, where there had been a drought in 2000. He and others also intended to build a school for girls in Kabul. Begg says while still in the UK, he, and others, had raised money and had begun providing equipment for a school. He says he was in the process of starting the school, and intended to work in it as an aid worker. The Taliban regime opposed education for females and had not given him a licence for the school, but &quot;they didn&#x27;t try to stop us either&quot;, The Taliban, he says, &quot;were more receptive to Islamic volunteers&quot;, and that the repression of women was less intense in Kabul than in other places he saw. While in Afghanistan, he bought a handgun.

In his book &quot;Enemy Combatant&quot;, Begg recalls telling two US agents who visited him in Guantanamo Bay that: I wanted to live in an Islamic state–one that was free from the corruption and despotism of the rest of the Muslim world... I knew you wouldn&#x27;t understand. The Taliban were better than anything Afghanistan has had in the past 25 years.

Begg has also said &quot;before the Taliban, warlords abounded, there was no security, the opium trade was booming, children were being used as sex slaves. At least the Taliban provided security and were building roads, and as opposed to the warlords, they seemed honest&quot;.

Begg says that he &quot;had never even heard of Al Qaeda before 9/11&quot;, and although he knew about Osama bin Laden, he agreed with those who saw bin Laden&#x27;s conflict with the US as &quot;counterproductive for Muslims&quot;.

The Allied attack on Afghanistan began in October 2001, and, following the fall of the Taliban, a US Justice Department dossier on Begg alleges that he joined their retreat to the Tora Bora mountains. The Pentagon claims that he was &quot;prepared to fight in the front line against allied forces&quot;. He says that he and his family intended to evacuate to Islamabad in Pakistan for safety. Initially he became separated from his family in Afghanistan, he and several other men were guided over the mountains into western Pakistan, and he was reunited with his family in Pakistan by mid-November.
Derunta training camp, from Jalalabad, was captured in November 2001. In the camp was found, among other things, a photocopy of a wire transfer moving funds from the Habib Bank AG Zurich to a &#x27;Moazzam Begg&#x27; in Karachi. US and Pakistani officials did not know who this was. Begg maintains that he is unaware of such a transaction, and that no one has ever shown him the document.

In February 2002, Begg was seized at his rented home in Islamabad by, what Begg believes were, Pakistani agents working on behalf of the US. His family maintained it was a case of mistaken identity. Begg says the Pakistanis treated him well and that after several weeks, they transferred him to United States Army officers in Bagram, near Kabul.

==Detention by US, 2002–2005==

===Detention in Afghanistan===

Begg was held at Bagram Theater Internment Facility from February 2002 to February 2003. He says that while there he was hog-tied, kicked, punched, left in a room with a bag put over his head (even though he suffered from asthma), sworn at, denied access to a lawyer, and threatened with electric shocks, having his fingers broken, sexual abuse, and, with extraordinary rendition to Egypt or Syria if he did not sign confessions.
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman later said there was &quot;no credible evidence that Begg was ever abused by US forces&quot;, and US intelligence officials insisted Begg had exaggerated the harshness of his treatment, though Whitman declined to answer whether Begg&#x27;s abuse allegations had ever been investigated.

In July 2004, Begg wrote in a letter of &quot;threats of torture, actual torture, death threats, racial and religious abuse&quot;, &quot;cruel and unusual treatment&quot;, and that &quot;documents ... were signed under duress&quot;. He also wrote: &quot;This culminated, in my opinion, with the deaths of two fellow detainees, at the hands of US military personnel, to which I myself was partially witness&quot;. Begg claims that while at Bagram, he saw two other detainees (Dilawar and Habibullah) being beaten so badly that he believed the beatings caused their deaths.

At the time DoD denied Begg&#x27;s account and, despite military coroner&#x27;s having ruled the deaths as homicides, military spokesmen at that time attributed the deaths to natural causes. However a Department of Defense investigation, whose results were reported in May 2005, concluded that the deaths of Dilawar and Habibullah were wholly due to mistreatment by American soldiers. Begg wrote after his release that, he believed, one of the reasons he had continued to be detained was because he had been a witness to the two killings.

Guantanamo files leaked in 2011 revealed that, nine months after Begg&#x27;s capture, the Department of Defence had concluded that Begg was a &quot;confirmed member of al-Qaida,&quot; and that he had been an instructor at the Derunta training camp, as well as having attended the al-Badr and Harakat aI-Ansar training camps.

===Detention in Guantanamo Bay===
On 2 February 2003, Begg was transferred to United States military custody at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. A February 2003 editorial in &quot;Gulf News&quot; reported that Begg had written to his parents that he did not know what he was accused of and was beginning to feel hopeless and depressed. It also said that Begg had confessed to being part of a plot to spray the Palace of Westminster with anthrax, a plan which had &quot;caused hilarity&quot; among security experts because of its implausibility, but, the article claimed, detainees were not allowed access to a lawyer until they had confessed to a crime.

Begg was held in Guantanamo Bay for just under two years, the first almost 600 days of which were spent in solitary confinement. The US government considered Begg an enemy combatant, and claimed that he trained at al-Qaeda terrorist camps in Afghanistan. He was not charged with any crime and was not allowed to consult legal counsel for the majority of the time he spent there.

On 9 October 2003, a memo summarising a meeting between General Geoffrey Miller and his staff and Vincent Cassard of the International Committee of the Red Cross said that camp authorities did not permit them to have access to Begg, due to &quot;military necessity&quot;. .

In July 2004, Begg wrote a letter saying he was not tortured in Guantanamo, though the conditions were &quot;torturous&quot;. Late in 2004, Clive Stafford Smith (a British lawyer working in the US) visited Begg and said he heard &quot;credible and consistent evidence&quot; from Begg of torture, including the use of strappado.

Begg&#x27;s American lawyer, Gitanjali Gutierrez of the Center for Constitutional Rights, received a handwritten letter from him, dated 12 July 2004, addressed to the US Forces Administration at Guantanamo Bay. It was copied to Begg&#x27;s lawyers, and the US authorities agreed to declassify it. Its full text was passed to his British lawyer, Gareth Peirce. He insisted: &quot;I am a law-abiding citizen of the UK, and attest vehemently to my innocence, before God and the law, of any crime — though none has even been alleged&quot;.

===Alleged contacts with extremists===
==Release==
Following the United States Supreme Court decision in &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot; (2004), in which the court ruled that detainees had habeas corpus rights and could challenge their detention, the US government quickly developed a system of Combatant Status Review Tribunals, Administrative Review Boards, and military commissions to provide the detainees with an &quot;impartial tribunal&quot; for reviewing their cases. Detainees could not call defence lawyers, could not review the evidence against them, and had allegations made that were dependent on hearsay evidence. The British government protested about their citizens being subjected to the planned Guantanamo tribunals, because due process rights would be severely curtailed.

On 11 January 2005, the British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw announced that, after &quot;intensive and complex discussions&quot; between his government and the US, the remaining four British nationals in Guantanamo Bay would be returned &quot;within weeks&quot;. While they were still regarded as &quot;enemy combatants&quot; by the US government, it had brought no specific charges against them. &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;CNN&quot; reported that Bush had released Begg as a favour to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was being harshly criticised in the UK for his support of the Iraq war. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; claimed that the Bush administration has tried to make a gag order a condition of Begg&#x27;s release, but that this would not have been acceptable to the British public.

On 25 January 2005, Begg and the three other British detainees, Feroz Abbasi, Martin Mubanga and Richard Belmar, were flown to RAF Northolt in west London. On arrival they were arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 by officers from the Metropolitan Police and taken to Paddington Green Police Station for questioning by anti-terrorist officers. By 9.00pm on 26 January, all four had been released without charge.

==Post-release: January 2005–present==

===US claims of ties to terrorism===
Bush released Begg over the objections of the Pentagon, the CIA, and the FBI, overruling most of his senior national security advisers, who were concerned that Begg could be a dangerous terrorist. In 2006, the Pentagon still maintained that he was a terrorist.

After Begg&#x27;s release, Bryan Whitman, a Defense Department spokesman, said of Begg: &quot;He has strong, long-term ties to terrorism — as a sympathizer, as a recruiter, as a financier and as a combatant&quot;. Whitman quoted from a single-spaced eight-page confession that Begg had signed while incarcerated in Bagram: &quot;I was armed and prepared to fight alongside the Taliban and al-Qaeda against the U.S. and others, and eventually retreated to Tora Bora to flee from U.S. forces when our front lines collapsed&quot;.

Begg maintains the confession is false, and that he gave it while under duress. Whitman said Begg was trying to recant his confession and that Begg was now &quot;clearly lying&quot;, though Whitman declined to answer whether Begg&#x27;s abuse allegations had ever been investigated.

Former military interrogator Christopher Hogan said: &quot;He provided us with excellent information routinely ... I don&#x27;t think he was the mastermind of 9/11, but nor do I think he was just an innocent ... more of a romantic than some sort of ideologically steeled fighter&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in June 2006, &quot;of nearly 20 American military and intelligence officials who were interviewed about Begg, none thought he had been wrongly detained. But some said they doubted that he could be tied to any terrorist acts&quot;.

===Alleged contacts with extremists after release===
Begg gave a number of presentations to the Islamic Society at University College London in 2007, at a time that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was its president. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Begg took part in the &#x27;War on Terror Week&#x27; UCL presentations at Abdulmutallab&#x27;s invitation. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Abdulmutallab had helped to organise the week as president of the society and that an attendee had claimed that Abdulmutallab was seated &quot;very close [to Begg]&quot;. The Weekly Standard called Begg &quot;A jihadist&quot;, &quot;a masterful anti-American propagandist&quot; and &quot;a demonstrable fraud&quot;.

Begg said that he does not recall Abdulmutallab, and that he was told that the &#x27;War on Terror Week&#x27; UCL presentations were organised by Qasim Rafiq, a friend of Abdulmuttalab&#x27;s. He was told Abdulmutallab did not attend any of the lectures.

Begg interviewed American imam, and alleged al-Qaeda senior figure, Anwar al-Awlaki after al-Awlaki was released from jail in Yemen in 2007. Al-Awlaki was invited to address CAGE&#x27;s&#x27; Ramadan fundraising dinners in August 2008 at Wandsworth Civic Centre, South London (by videolink, as he was banned from entering the UK), and August 2009 at Kensington Town Hall.

===Passport refusal and confiscation===
In February 2005, British Home Secretary Charles Clarke refused to issue Begg a passport. He did so based on information obtained while Begg was in US custody. He said &quot;there are strong grounds for believing that, on leaving the UK, [Begg] would take part in activities against the United Kingdom or allied targets&quot;. Clarke used Royal prerogative to refuse the passport which had only been used 13 times since 1947 in this way – the previous time being in 1976.

A British passport was issued in 2009, but in 2013 it was confiscated at Heathrow airport upon Begg&#x27;s return from a trip to South Africa. The Home Office said that Begg had been assessed as having been involved in terrorist activity due to a trip to Syria the previous year. Begg claimed that the real reason for the confiscation was his campaign to prove UK and US complicity in the use of torture and rendition of suspects, and that he had been stopped for questioning almost every time he had travelled, even when returning from an official speaking invitation at the European Parliament.

In January 2022, Begg announced he was taking legal action for a judicial review of the British Home Secretary&#x27;s rejection of his application for a passport, which had been confiscated in 2013. In February 2022 VICE World News published an interview of Mr Begg in which refers to his continuing “harassment” by authorities.

===Public positions===
Since his release, Begg has stated he is against attacks such as 9/11 but that he supported those fighting against British soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2010, referring to Afghanistan, Begg said he completely supported the inalienable right of the people to fight &quot;foreign occupation&quot; . . . if resisting the occupation of Afghanistan was not only considered good but lionised [in the 1980s] by the British government and US . . . then nothing has changed other than interests.&quot;

He has worked as outreach director for the charitable organisation and advocacy group CAGE, (formerly &#x27;Cageprisoners&#x27;) to represent those detainees still held at Guantanamo, as well as to help those who have been released to get services and integrate into society. He has travelled on speaking tours, and worked to persuade governments to accept former detainees for resettlement. In 2010, Cynthia Stroum, then-U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg, commented &quot;Mr Begg is doing our work for us...&quot;, adding that Begg&#x27;s &quot;articulate, reasoned presentation makes for a convincing argument&quot;.

In December 2005, Begg made a video appeal to the Swords of Righteousness Brigade, the Iraqi kidnappers of four Western peace workers, asking for their release. There was an inter-faith effort calling for the men&#x27;s release. Abu Qatada, a detainee held in Britain also appealed for release of the men. In early March 2006, the body of the American hostage, Tom Fox, was found in Baghdad. A week-long military operation led by British forces secured the release of the remaining three hostages, one Briton and two Canadians, later that month.

In 2010, when CAGE had recently expanded its work to include the highlighting of the use of drone strikes for extrajudicial killings, Begg said that little had changed despite Barack Obama&#x27;s promises: &quot;We say that Bush was the president of torture, but Obama is the president of extra-judicial killing . . . while one used to extra-judicially detain people, the other has gone a step further and extra-judicially kills them&quot;. Speaking of Guantánamo, Begg said that recently released detainees had told him that conditions had improved slightly after Obama came to power, but none believed it would close: &quot;It is like a town now and every thing around it has continued to expand. It seems that this is a permanent facility and they intend to keep it as such&quot;.

Following the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, in which over 130 pupils and teachers were killed by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, Begg wrote a comment on Facebook which was reported in his home town&#x27;s main newspaper, the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;. Begg stated that &#x27;It is time to stop this cycle of uncontrolled rage and internecine violence that will only drive us to the pits of hell. Incessant calls for revenge each time need to be tempered with reflections on the consequences of what that means. There are no winners in this&#x27;.

====Speaker and activist====
As director of outreach for the prisoner rights organisation, CAGE, Begg has appeared in the media and around the country, lecturing on issues pertaining to the British Muslim community, such as imprisonment without trial, torture, anti-terror legislation and measures and community relations. He has appeared as a commentator on radio and television interviews and documentaries, including the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; and &quot;Newsnight&quot; shows, PBS&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, Al-Jazeera&#x27;s &quot;Prisoner 345&quot;, &quot;Taking Liberties&quot;, and &quot;Torturing Democracy&quot;, and National Geographic&#x27;s &quot;Guantanamo&#x27;s Secrets&quot;. He has authored pieces which have appeared in newspapers and magazines.

He has toured as a speaker about his time in detention facilities, calling the British response to terrorism racist, and disproportionate to anti-terror measures and legislation during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. In January 2009, Begg toured the UK with former Guantanamo guard Christopher Arendt, in the &quot;Two Sides, One Story&quot; tour.

Begg has campaigned against US wartime policy with human rights organisations such as Reprieve, Amnesty International, the Center for Constitutional Rights, PeaceMaker and Conflicts Forum.

In July 2015, Begg endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

===Book, 2006===

Begg co-authored a book released in March 2006 about his Guantanamo experiences, it was co-written with Victoria Brittain, a former associate foreign editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. It was published in Britain as &quot;Enemy Combatant: A British Muslim&#x27;s Journey To Guantanamo and Back&quot; (), and in the US as &quot;Enemy Combatant: My Imprisonment at Guantanamo, Bagram, and Kandahar&quot; (). In the US, the foreword was written by David Ignatius of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

The book received praise in Britain for Begg&#x27;s &quot;outstanding liberality of mind and evenhandedness toward his captors&quot;.

It received mixed reviews in the US, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described it as &quot;a fast-paced, harrowing narrative&quot;. &quot;Much of the Moazzam Begg story is consistent with other accounts of detention conditions in both Afghanistan and Guantanamo&quot;, said John Sifton, a New York-based official from Human Rights Watch, who interviewed former Guantanamo prisoners in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;some notable gaps in Mr. Begg&#x27;s memoir&quot;, such as not mentioning his arrest in 1994 for alleged fraud. &quot;U-T San Diego&quot; said: &quot;Begg has been less than forthcoming about his criminal past ... his cooperation with interrogators ... and his ties to terrorism&quot;.

Jonathan Raban, reviewing the book for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, wrote &quot; The gaps in his story — and they&#x27;re more frustrating than downright suspicious — cease at the moment when Begg enters captivity&quot;. Raban criticised some &quot;notably talentless&quot; dialogue writing, &quot;Perhaps Begg really did strike up a warm relationship with soldier Jennifer … but only in bad fiction do people speak this way&quot;. Finally concluding &quot;There can be no doubt about the reality of the predicament described by Moazzam Begg … the indiscriminate dragnet thrown out by the United States … brought in a catch that included many bystanders who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and whose single common denominator was that they were Muslims.&quot;

&quot;The Muslim News&quot; called it an &quot;open, honest and touching account&quot;. Begg earned the &quot;Published Writer Award&quot; for the book, at the annual Muslim Writers Awards in March 2008.

===Lawsuit against the British government===
In April 2008, Begg and seven other former Guantanamo detainees filed lawsuits in Britain&#x27;s High Court accusing the British Attorney General, Home and Foreign Secretaries, MI5 and MI6, of unlawful acts, negligence and complicity in their abduction, treatment and interrogation. At a 2009 court hearing, Government lawyers denied the charges, but stated that MI5 had interviewed some detainees and in some instances supplied questions that they wished prisoners to be asked.

In November 2010, the British Government announced that it had reached a financial settlement with 16 detainees, including Begg. The British Government said there was no evidence that British officials participated directly in the abuse of prisoners, however, in 2010, a Public inquiry was formed to investigate the matter. In 2013, an interim report by the Gibson Inquiry into British involvement in torture and rendition of detainees concluded that the British government and UK intelligence services had been involved in rendition and had interviewed suspects whom they knew were being mistreated. The public inquiry was then suspended and further investigation handed over to the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee.

===Guantanamo video game, 2009===
In 2009, Begg was an advisor, and was due to appear as himself, for the Scottish software company T-Enterprise in the development of a video game entitled , for Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 360. The game would have put the player in the place of the detainees.

The software company&#x27;s director said, &quot;We approached Moazzam because it&#x27;s very hard for us to know how to design the layout of the prison and he helped&quot;, and that neither US nor British soldiers would get killed in the game, only &quot;mercenaries&quot;. Begg said that, when first approached, he hesitated, &quot;I was worried that it might trivialise my experience&quot;, but that he would &quot;help to bring those issues to people who would not usually think about it&quot;. Although Begg had a financial stake in the game, he said that he had not received any money at that point. The software company said: &quot;We have had a lot of hate mail about this, mainly from America, saying things like &#x27;don&#x27;t dare put out a game that shows them killing our soldiers&#x27;&quot;.

Conservative pundits such as &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;″s Tom Joscelyn and radio host Rush Limbaugh reacted negatively to the game and Begg&#x27;s involvement. Ultimately, T-Enterprise did not complete the game due to US press coverage, which it described as &quot;inaccurate and ill informed speculation ... many conclusions were reached that have absolutely no foundation whatsoever&quot;.

===Amnesty International controversy, 2010===
In 2010, Gita Sahgal, then head of Amnesty&#x27;s gender unit, publicly condemned her organisation for its collaboration with Begg because of his association with CAGE. She said its &quot;Counter Terror With Justice&quot; campaign &quot;constitutes a threat to human rights&quot;. In an open letter to Amnesty&#x27;s leadership, she said: &quot;To be appearing on platforms with Britain&#x27;s most famous supporter of the Taliban, whom we treat as a human rights defender, is a gross error of judgment&quot;.

Begg filed a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission against &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; for publishing an accusation of links between Amnesty and the Taliban. Amnesty International posted a response to press coverage of the incident by Claudio Cordone, Amnesty Secretary General, pointing out that Amnesty&#x27;s work with Begg had &quot;focused exclusively on highlighting the human rights violations committed in Guantánamo Bay&quot;.

Begg says he later discussed the allegations with Sahgal, &quot;Because I advocate a negotiated settlement in Afghanistan, she portrayed me as the greatest supporter of the Taliban and therefore, by extension, a supporter of everything they have said in terms of rights of women and so forth. That&#x27;s not very clever, nor is it very honest&quot;.

==2014 arrests==
In February 2014, Begg was arrested by West Midlands Police on suspicion of attending a terrorist training camp and facilitating terrorism overseas. West Midlands Police said: &quot;This is an arrest, not a charge, and ... our naming does not imply any guilt&quot;. In July of the same year, Begg was charged by the same force with terrorist activities related to his alleged actions in the Syrian Civil War, including attending a terrorist training camp. While awaiting trial, he was held in Belmarsh, a British high-security prison.

In October 2014, shortly before his trial was due to start, Begg was released after the prosecution announced that they would be offering no evidence due to documents having come into their possession showing that MI5 had been aware of, and had consented to, Begg&#x27;s travels to Syria. West Midlands Police said &quot;new evidence had come to light&quot; and immediately following the verdict, its assistant chief constable said the police fully accepted that Moazzam Begg was an innocent man. A CPS spokesperson said &#x27;If we had been made aware of all of this information at the time of charging, we would not have charged&#x27;.

==Open letter to President Biden==

On 29 January 2021 the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; published an open letter from Begg, and six other Guantanamo detainees, to newly inaugurated American President Biden, appealing to him to close the detention camp.

==Documentary appearances==
*Begg was among those interviewed in the 2007 documentary &quot;Taxi to the Dark Side&quot; about the killing of an Afghan taxi driver at Bagram detention centre. The film, which was directed by American filmmaker Alex Gibney, won the 2007 Academy Award for &quot;Best Documentary Feature&quot;. The documentary was also shown as part of the international &quot;Why Democracy?&quot; documentary series.
*Begg is the subject of an extended interview in &quot;The Confession&quot; (2016), discussing his life prior to his incarceration in Guantánamo Bay, his incarceration, and subsequent life. It was given four stars by the &quot;Guardian&quot;, who described Begg&#x27;s &quot;principled, consistent testimony&quot; having a &quot;rare gravity and profound moral force&quot;. This documentary has also been shown in the BBC &quot;Storyville&quot; documentary series, under the title &quot;Moazzam Begg: Living the War on Terror&quot;.
*Begg is interviewed in the 2009 documentary &quot;Outside the Law: Stories from Guantanamo&quot;, co-directed by Andy Worthington and Polly Nash. The film focuses on the cases of Begg and other UK detainees with comments by lawyers Clive Stafford Smith, Gareth Peirce and Tom Wilner.

*In 2006, Begg was interviewed in the video &quot;21st Century CrUSAders&quot;, saying that the War on Terrorism is really akin to a war against Islam. According to Gareth Peirce, possession of this film has been offered in British courts as evidence of radicalisation.

===Representation in play===
*Begg, and his father Azmat, both feature as characters in a play written by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo, entitled &quot;Guantanamo: Honor Bound to Defend Freedom&quot;, which opened in 2004 at the Tricycle Theatre before transferring to the New Ambassadors Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. The play is based on the testimonies of detainees and others. A production was mounted at the Culture Project in New York. In 2006 the Tricycle presented performances of the play at the Houses of Parliament and on Washington&#x27;s Capitol Hill.
